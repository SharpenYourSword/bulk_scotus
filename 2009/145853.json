Friedman, Assistant Attorneys General, Boston, MA, for Respondent.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Massachusetts courts in this case admitted into evidence affidavits reporting the results of forensic analysis which showed that material seized by the police and connected to the defendant was cocaine. The question presented is whether those affidavits are \"testimonial,\" rendering the affiants \"witnesses\" subject to the defendant's right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In 2001, Boston police officers received a tip that a Kmart employee, Thomas Wright, was engaging in suspicious activity. The informant reported that Wright repeatedly received phone calls at work, after each of which he would be picked up in front of the store by a blue sedan, and would return to the store a short time later. The police set up surveillance in the Kmart parking lot and witnessed this precise sequence of events. When Wright got out of the car upon his return, one of the officers detained and searched him, finding four clear white plastic bags containing a substance resembling cocaine. The officer then signaled other officers on the scene to arrest the two men in the carone of whom was petitioner Luis Melendez-Diaz. The officers placed all three men in a police cruiser.</p>\n<p>During the short drive to the police station, the officers observed their passengers fidgeting and making furtive movements in the back of the car. After depositing the men at the station, they searched the police cruiser and found a plastic bag containing 19 smaller plastic bags hidden in the partition between the front and back seats. They submitted the seized evidence to a state laboratory required by law to conduct chemical analysis upon police request. Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 111, § 12 (West 2006).</p>\n<p>Melendez-Diaz was charged with distributing cocaine and with trafficking in cocaine in an amount between 14 and 28 grams. Ch. 94C, §§ 32A, 32E(b)(1). At trial, the prosecution placed into evidence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2531</span> the bags seized from Wright and from the police cruiser. It also submitted three \"certificates of analysis\" showing the results of the forensic analysis performed on the seized substances. The certificates reported the weight of the seized bags and stated that the bags \"[h]a[ve] been examined with the following results: The substance was found to contain: Cocaine.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a, 26a, 28a. The certificates were sworn to before a notary public by analysts at the State Laboratory Institute of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, as required under Massachusetts law. Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 111, § 13.</p>\n<p>Petitioner objected to the admission of the certificates, asserting that our Confrontation Clause decision in <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), required the analysts to testify in person. The objection was overruled, and the certificates were admitted pursuant to state law as \"prima facie evidence of the composition, quality, and the net weight of the narcotic ... analyzed.\" Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 111, § 13.</p>\n<p>The jury found Melendez-Diaz guilty. He appealed, contending, among other things, that admission of the certificates violated his Sixth Amendment right to be confronted with the witnesses against him. The Appeals Court of Massachusetts rejected the claim, affirmance order, 69 Mass.App.Ct. 1114, 870 N.E.2d 676, 2007 WL 2189152, *4, n. 3 (July 31, 2007), relying on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's decision in <i>Commonwealth v. Verde,</i> 444 Mass. 279, 283-285, 827 N.E.2d 701, 705-706 (2005), which held that the authors of certificates of forensic analysis are not subject to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment. The Supreme Judicial Court denied review. 449 Mass. 1113, 874 N.E.2d 407 (2007). We granted certiorari. 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1647, 170 L.Ed.2d 352 (2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the States via the Fourteenth Amendment, <i>Pointer v. Texas,</i> 380 U.S. 400, 403, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965), provides that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\" In <i>Crawford,</i> after reviewing the Clause's historical underpinnings, we held that it guarantees a defendant's right to confront those \"who `bear testimony'\" against him. 541 U.S., at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354. A witness's testimony against a defendant is thus inadmissible unless the witness appears at trial or, if the witness is unavailable, the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. <i>Id.,</i> at 54, 124 S.Ct. 1354.</p>\n<p>Our opinion described the class of testimonial statements covered by the Confrontation Clause as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Various formulations of this core class of testimonial statements exist: <i>ex parte</i> in-court testimony or its functional equivalentthat is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially; extrajudicial statements ... contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions; statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2532</span> There is little doubt that the documents at issue in this case fall within the \"core class of testimonial statements\" thus described. Our description of that category mentions affidavits twice. See also <i>White v. Illinois,</i> 502 U.S. 346, 365, 112 S.Ct. 736, 116 L.Ed.2d 848 (1992) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\"[T]he Confrontation Clause is implicated by extrajudicial statements only insofar as they are contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions\"). The documents at issue here, while denominated by Massachusetts law \"certificates,\" are quite plainly affidavits: \"declaration[s] of facts written down and sworn to by the declarant before an officer authorized to administer oaths.\" Black's Law Dictionary 62 (8th ed.2004). They are incontrovertibly a \"`solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.'\" <i>Crawford, supra,</i> at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (quoting 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828)). The fact in question is that the substance found in the possession of Melendez-Diaz and his codefendants was, as the prosecution claimed, cocainethe precise testimony the analysts would be expected to provide if called at trial. The \"certificates\" are functionally identical to live, in-court testimony, doing \"precisely what a witness does on direct examination.\" <i>Davis v. Washington,</i> 547 U.S. 813, 830, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006) (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p>Here, moreover, not only were the affidavits \"`made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial,'\" <i>Crawford, supra,</i> at 52, 124 S.Ct. 1354, but under Massachusetts law the <i>sole purpose</i> of the affidavits was to provide \"prima facie evidence of the composition, quality, and the net weight\" of the analyzed substance, Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 111, § 13. We can safely assume that the analysts were aware of the affidavits' evidentiary purpose, since that purposeas stated in the relevant state-law provisionwas reprinted on the affidavits themselves. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a, 27a, 29a.</p>\n<p>In short, under our decision in <i>Crawford</i> the analysts' affidavits were testimonial statements, and the analysts were \"witnesses\" for purposes of the Sixth Amendment. Absent a showing that the analysts were unavailable to testify at trial <i>and</i> that petitioner had a prior opportunity to cross-examine them, petitioner was entitled to \"`be confronted with'\" the analysts at trial. <i>Crawford, supra,</i> at 54, 124 S.Ct. 1354.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Respondent and the dissent advance a potpourri of analytic arguments in an effort <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2533</span> to avoid this rather straightforward application of our holding in <i>Crawford.</i> Before addressing them, however, we must assure the reader of the falsity of the dissent's opening alarum that we are \"sweep[ing] away an accepted rule governing the admission of scientific evidence\" that has been \"established for at least 90 years\" and \"extends across at least 35 States and six Federal Courts of Appeals.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2543 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).</p>\n<p>The vast majority of the state-court cases the dissent cites in support of this claim come not from the last 90 years, but from the last 30, and not surprisingly nearly all of them rely on our decision in <i>Ohio v. Roberts,</i> 448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), or its since-rejected theory that unconfronted testimony was admissible as long as it bore indicia of reliability, <i>id.,</i> at 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531. See <i>post,</i> at 2559.<sup>[2]</sup> As for the six Federal Courts of Appeals cases cited by the dissent, five of them postdated and expressly relied on <i>Roberts.</i> See <i>post,</i> at 2554-2555. The sixth predated <i>Roberts</i> but relied entirely on the same erroneous theory. See <i>Kay v. United States,</i> 255 F.2d 476, 480-481 (C.A.4 1958) (rejecting confrontation clause challenge \"where there is reasonable necessity for [the evidence] and where ... the evidence has those qualities of reliability and trustworthiness\").</p>\n<p>A review of cases that predate the <i>Roberts</i> era yields a mixed picture. As the dissent notes, three state supreme court decisions from the early 20th century denied confrontation with respect to certificates of analysis regarding a substance's alcohol content. See <i>post,</i> at 2554 (citing cases from Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Virginia). But other state courts in the same era reached the opposite conclusion. See <i>Torres v. State,</i> 113 Tex.Crim. 1, 18 S.W.2d 179, 180 (App.1929); <i>Volrich v. State,</i> No. 278, 1925 WL 2473 (Ohio App., Nov. 2, 1925). At least this much is entirely clear: In faithfully applying <i>Crawford</i> to the facts of this case, we are not overruling 90 years of settled jurisprudence. It is the dissent that seeks to overturn precedent by resurrecting <i>Roberts</i> a mere five years after it was rejected in <i>Crawford.</i></p>\n<p>We turn now to the various legal arguments raised by respondent and the dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Respondent first argues that the analysts are not subject to confrontation because they are not \"accusatory\" witnesses, in that they do not directly accuse petitioner of wrongdoing; rather, their testimony is inculpatory only when taken together with other evidence linking petitioner to the contraband. See Brief for Respondent 10. This finds no support in the text of the Sixth Amendment or in our case law.</p>\n<p>The Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right \"to be confronted with the witnesses <i>against him.</i>\" (Emphasis added.) To the extent the analysts were witnesses (a question resolved above), they certainly provided testimony <i>against</i> petitioner, proving one fact necessary for his convictionthat the substance he possessed was cocaine. The contrast between the text of the Confrontation Clause and the text of the adjacent Compulsory Process <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2534</span> Clause confirms this analysis. While the Confrontation Clause guarantees a defendant the right to be confronted with the witnesses \"against him,\" the Compulsory Process Clause guarantees a defendant the right to call witnesses \"in his favor.\" U.S. Const., Amdt. 6. The text of the Amendment contemplates two classes of witnessesthose against the defendant and those in his favor. The prosecution <i>must</i> produce the former;<sup>[3]</sup> the defendant <i>may</i> call the latter. Contrary to respondent's assertion, there is not a third category of witnesses, helpful to the prosecution, but somehow immune from confrontation.</p>\n<p>It is often, indeed perhaps usually, the case that an adverse witness's testimony, taken alone, will not suffice to convict. Yet respondent fails to cite a single case in which such testimony was admitted absent a defendant's opportunity to cross-examine.<sup>[4]</sup> Unsurprisingly, since such a holding would be contrary to longstanding case law. In <i>Kirby v. United States,</i> 174 U.S. 47, 19 S.Ct. 574, 43 L.Ed. 890 (1899), the Court considered Kirby's conviction for receiving stolen property, the evidence for which consisted, in part, of the records of conviction of three individuals who were found guilty of stealing the relevant property. <i>Id.,</i> at 53, 19 S.Ct. 574. Though this evidence proved only that the property was stolen, and not that Kirby received it, the Court nevertheless ruled that admission of the records violated Kirby's rights under the Confrontation Clause. <i>Id.,</i> at 55, 19 S.Ct. 574. See also <i>King v. Turner,</i> 1 Mood. 347, 168 Eng. Rep. 1298 (1832) (confession by one defendant to having stolen certain goods could not be used as evidence against another defendant accused of receiving the stolen property).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Respondent and the dissent argue that the analysts should not be subject to confrontation because they are not \"conventional\" (or \"typical\" or \"ordinary\") witnesses of the sort whose <i>ex parte</i> testimony was most notoriously used at the trial of Sir Walter Raleigh. <i>Post,</i> at 2550-2551; Brief for Respondent 28. It is true, as the Court recognized in <i>Crawford,</i> that <i>ex parte</i> examinations of the sort used at Raleigh's trial have \"long been thought a paradigmatic confrontation violation.\" 541 U.S., at 52, 124 S.Ct. 1354. But the paradigmatic case identifies the core of the right to confrontation, not its limits. The right to confrontation was not invented in response to the use of the <i>ex parte</i> examinations in <i>Raleigh's Case,</i> 2 How. St. Tr. 1 (1603). That use provoked such an outcry precisely because it flouted the deeply rooted common-law tradition \"of live testimony in court subject to adversarial testing.\" <i>Crawford, supra,</i> at 43, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (citing 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 373-374 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2535</span> (1768)). See also <i>Crawford, supra,</i> at 43-47, 124 S.Ct. 1354.</p>\n<p>In any case, the purported distinctions respondent and the dissent identify between this case and Sir Walter Raleigh's \"conventional\" accusers do not survive scrutiny. The dissent first contends that a \"conventional witness recalls events observed in the past, while an analyst's report contains near-contemporaneous observations of the test.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2551-2552. It is doubtful that the analyst's reports in this case could be characterized as reporting \"near-contemporaneous observations\"; the affidavits were completed almost a week after the tests were performed. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a-29a (the tests were performed on November 28, 2001, and the affidavits sworn on December 4, 2001). But regardless, the dissent misunderstands the role that \"near-contemporaneity\" has played in our case law. The dissent notes that that factor was given \"substantial weight\" in <i>Davis, post,</i> at 2551, but in fact that decision <i>disproves</i> the dissent's position. There the Court considered the admissibility of statements made to police officers responding to a report of a domestic disturbance. By the time officers arrived the assault had ended, but the victim's statementswritten and oralwere sufficiently close in time to the alleged assault that the trial court admitted her affidavit as a \"present sense impression.\" <i>Davis,</i> 547 U.S., at 820, 126 S.Ct. 2266 (internal quotation marks omitted). Though the witness's statements in <i>Davis</i> were \"near-contemporaneous\" to the events she reported, we nevertheless held that they could <i>not</i> be admitted absent an opportunity to confront the witness. <i>Id.,</i> at 830, 126 S.Ct. 2266.</p>\n<p>A second reason the dissent contends that the analysts are not \"conventional witnesses\" (and thus not subject to confrontation) is that they \"observe[d] neither the crime nor any human action related to it.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2552. The dissent provides no authority for this particular limitation of the type of witnesses subject to confrontation. Nor is it conceivable that all witnesses who fit this description would be outside the scope of the Confrontation Clause. For example, is a police officer's investigative report describing the crime scene admissible absent an opportunity to examine the officer? The dissent's novel exception from coverage of the Confrontation Clause would exempt all expert witnessesa hardly \"unconventional\" class of witnesses.</p>\n<p>A third respect in which the dissent asserts that the analysts are not \"conventional\" witnesses and thus not subject to confrontation is that their statements were not provided in response to interrogation. <i>Ibid.</i> See also Brief for Respondent 29. As we have explained, \"[t]he Framers were no more willing to exempt from cross-examination volunteered testimony or answers to open-ended questions than they were to exempt answers to detailed interrogation.\" <i>Davis, supra,</i> at 822-823, n. 1, 126 S.Ct. 2266. Respondent and the dissent cite no authority, and we are aware of none, holding that a person who volunteers his testimony is any less a \"`witness against' the defendant,\" Brief for Respondent 26, than one who is responding to interrogation. In any event, the analysts' affidavits in this case <i>were</i> presented in response to a police request. See Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 111, §§ 12-13. If an affidavit submitted in response to a police officer's request to \"write down what happened\" suffices to trigger the Sixth Amendment's protection (as it apparently does, see <i>Davis,</i> 547 U.S., at 819-820, 126 S.Ct. 2266; <i>id.,</i> at 840, n. 5, 126 S.Ct. 2266 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part)), then the analysts' testimony should be subject to confrontation as well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2536</span> C</h2>\n<p>Respondent claims that there is a difference, for Confrontation Clause purposes, between testimony recounting historical events, which is \"prone to distortion or manipulation,\" and the testimony at issue here, which is the \"resul[t] of neutral, scientific testing.\" Brief for Respondent 29. Relatedly, respondent and the dissent argue that confrontation of forensic analysts would be of little value because \"one would not reasonably expect a laboratory professional ... to feel quite differently about the results of his scientific test by having to look at the defendant.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 31 (internal quotation marks omitted); see <i>post,</i> at 2548-2549.</p>\n<p>This argument is little more than an invitation to return to our overruled decision in <i>Roberts,</i> 448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597, which held that evidence with \"particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\" was admissible notwithstanding the Confrontation Clause. <i>Id.,</i> at 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531. What we said in <i>Crawford</i> in response to that argument remains true:</p>\n<blockquote>\"To be sure, the Clause's ultimate goal is to ensure reliability of evidence, but it is a procedural rather than a substantive guarantee. It commands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination. ... Dispensing with confrontation because testimony is obviously reliable is akin to dispensing with jury trial because a defendant is obviously guilty. This is not what the Sixth Amendment prescribes.\" 541 U.S., at 61-62, 124 S.Ct. 1354.</blockquote>\n<p>Respondent and the dissent may be right that there are other waysand in some cases better waysto challenge or verify the results of a forensic test.<sup>[5]</sup> But the Constitution guarantees one way: confrontation. We do not have license to suspend the Confrontation Clause when a preferable trial strategy is available.</p>\n<p>Nor is it evident that what respondent calls \"neutral scientific testing\" is as neutral or as reliable as respondent suggests. Forensic evidence is not uniquely immune from the risk of manipulation. According to a recent study conducted under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences, \"[t]he majority of [laboratories producing forensic evidence] are administered by law enforcement agencies, such as police departments, where the laboratory administrator reports to the head of the agency.\" National Research Council of the National Academies, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward 6-1 (Prepublication Copy Feb. 2009) (hereinafter National Academy Report). And \"[b]ecause forensic scientists often are driven in their work by a need to answer a particular question related to the issues of a particular case, they sometimes face pressure to sacrifice appropriate methodology for the sake of expediency.\" <i>Id.,</i> at S-17. A forensic analyst responding to a request from a law enforcement official may feel pressureor have an incentiveto alter the evidence in a manner favorable to the prosecution.</p>\n<p>Confrontation is one means of assuring accurate forensic analysis. While it is true, as the dissent notes, that an honest analyst will not alter his testimony when forced to confront the defendant, <i>post,</i> at 2548, the same cannot be said of the fraudulent analyst. See Brief for National Innocence Network as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 15-17 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2537</span> (discussing cases of documented \"drylabbing\" where forensic analysts report results of tests that were never performed); National Academy Report 1-8 to 1-10 (discussing documented cases of fraud and error involving the use of forensic evidence). Like the eyewitness who has fabricated his account to the police, the analyst who provides false results may, under oath in open court, reconsider his false testimony. See <i>Coy v. Iowa,</i> 487 U.S. 1012, 1019, 108 S.Ct. 2798, 101 L.Ed.2d 857 (1988). And, of course, the prospect of confrontation will deter fraudulent analysis in the first place.</p>\n<p>Confrontation is designed to weed out not only the fraudulent analyst, but the incompetent one as well. Serious deficiencies have been found in the forensic evidence used in criminal trials. One commentator asserts that \"[t]he legal community now concedes, with varying degrees of urgency, that our system produces erroneous convictions based on discredited forensics.\" Metzger, Cheating the Constitution, 59 Vand. L.Rev. 475, 491 (2006). One study of cases in which exonerating evidence resulted in the overturning of criminal convictions concluded that invalid forensic testimony contributed to the convictions in 60% of the cases. Garrett &amp; Neufeld, Invalid Forensic Science Testimony and Wrongful Convictions, 95 Va. L.Rev. 1, 14 (2009). And the National Academy Report concluded:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<i>\"The forensic science system, encompassing both research and practice, has serious problems that can only be addressed by a national commitment to overhaul the current structure that supports the forensic science community in this country.\"</i> National Academy Report P-1 (emphasis in original).<sup>[6]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Like expert witnesses generally, an analyst's lack of proper training or deficiency in judgment may be disclosed in cross-examination.</p>\n<p>This case is illustrative. The affidavits submitted by the analysts contained only the bare-bones statement that \"[t]he substance was found to contain: Cocaine.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a, 26a, 28a. At the time of trial, petitioner did not know what tests the analysts performed, whether those tests were routine, and whether interpreting their results required the exercise of judgment or the use of skills that the analysts may not have possessed. While we still do not know the precise tests used by the analysts, we are told that the laboratories use \"methodology recommended by the Scientific Working Group for the Analysis of Seized Drugs,\" App. to Brief for Petitioner 1a-2a. At least some of that methodology requires the exercise of judgment and presents a risk of error that might be explored on cross-examination. See 2 P. Giannelli &amp; E. Imwinkelried, Scientific Evidence § 23.03[c], pp. 532-533, ch. 23A, p. 607 (4th ed.2007) (identifying four \"critical errors\" that analysts may commit in interpreting the results of the commonly used gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis); Shellow, The Application of <i>Daubert</i> to the Identification of Drugs, 2 Shepard's Expert &amp; Scientific Evidence Quarterly 593, 600 (1995) (noting that while spectrometers <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2538</span> may be equipped with computerized matching systems, \"forensic analysts in crime laboratories typically do not utilize this feature of the instrument, but rely exclusively on their subjective judgment\").</p>\n<p>The same is true of many of the other types of forensic evidence commonly used in criminal prosecutions. \"[T]here is wide variability across forensic science disciplines with regard to techniques, methodologies, reliability, types and numbers of potential errors, research, general acceptability, and published material.\" National Academy Report S-5. See also <i>id.,</i> at 5-9, 5-12, 5-17, 5-21 (discussing problems of subjectivity, bias, and unreliability of common forensic tests such as latent fingerprint analysis, pattern/impression analysis, and toolmark and firearms analysis). Contrary to respondent's and the dissent's suggestion, there is little reason to believe that confrontation will be useless in testing analysts' honesty, proficiency, and methodologythe features that are commonly the focus in the cross-examination of experts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>Respondent argues that the analysts' affidavits are admissible without confrontation because they are \"akin to the types of official and business records admissible at common law.\" Brief for Respondent 35. But the affidavits do not qualify as traditional official or business records, and even if they did, their authors would be subject to confrontation nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Documents kept in the regular course of business may ordinarily be admitted at trial despite their hearsay status. See Fed. Rule Evid. 803(6). But that is not the case if the regularly conducted business activity is the production of evidence for use at trial. Our decision in <i>Palmer v. Hoffman,</i> 318 U.S. 109, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943), made that distinction clear. There we held that an accident report provided by an employee of a railroad company did not qualify as a business record because, although kept in the regular course of the railroad's operations, it was \"calculated for use essentially in the court, not in the business.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 114, 63 S.Ct. 477.<sup>[7]</sup> The analysts' certificateslike police reports generated by law enforcement officialsdo not qualify as business or public records for precisely the same reason. See Rule 803(8) (defining public records as \"excluding, however, in criminal cases matters observed by police officers and other law enforcement personnel\").</p>\n<p>Respondent seeks to rebut this limitation by noting that at common law the results of a coroner's inquest were admissible without an opportunity for confrontation. But as we have previously noted, whatever the status of coroner's reports at common law in England, they were not accorded any special status in American practice. See <i>Crawford,</i> 541 U.S., at 47, n. 2, 124 S.Ct. 1354; <i>Giles v. California,</i> 554 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 2678, 2705-06, 171 L.Ed.2d 488 (2008) (BREYER, J., dissenting); EvidenceOfficial RecordsCoroner's Inquest, 65 U. Pa. L.Rev. 290 (1917).</p>\n<p>The dissent identifies a single class of evidence which, though prepared for use at trial, was traditionally admissible: a clerk's certificate authenticating an official recordor a copy thereoffor use as evidence. See <i>post,</i> at 2552-2553. But a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2539</span> clerk's authority in that regard was narrowly circumscribed. He was permitted \"to certify to the correctness of a copy of a record kept in his office,\" but had \"no authority to furnish, as evidence for the trial of a lawsuit, his interpretation of what the record contains or shows, or to certify to its substance or effect.\" <i>State v. Wilson,</i> 141 La. 404, 409, 75 So. 95, 97 (1917). See also <i>State v. Champion,</i> 116 N.C. 987, 21 S.E. 700, 700-701 (1895); 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 1678 (3d ed.1940). The dissent suggests that the fact that this exception was \"`narrowly circumscribed'\" makes no difference. See <i>post,</i> at 2553. To the contrary, it makes all the difference in the world. It shows that even the line of cases establishing the one narrow exception the dissent has been able to identify simultaneously vindicates the general rule applicable to the present case. A clerk could by affidavit <i>authenticate</i> or provide a copy of an otherwise admissible record, but could not do what the analysts did here: <i>create</i> a record for the sole purpose of providing evidence against a defendant.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Far more probative here are those cases in which the prosecution sought to admit into evidence a clerk's certificate attesting to the fact that the clerk had searched for a particular relevant record and failed to find it. Like the testimony of the analysts in this case, the clerk's statement would serve as substantive evidence against the defendant whose guilt depended on the nonexistence of the record for which the clerk searched. Although the clerk's certificate would qualify as an official record under respondent's definitionit was prepared by a public officer in the regular course of his official dutiesand although the clerk was certainly not a \"conventional witness\" under the dissent's approach, the clerk was nonetheless subject to confrontation. See <i>People v. Bromwich,</i> 200 N.Y. 385, 388-389, 93 N.E. 933, 934 (1911); <i>People v. Goodrode,</i> 132 Mich. 542, 547, 94 N.W. 14, 16 (1903); Wigmore, <i>supra,</i> § 1678.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Respondent also misunderstands the relationship between the business-and-official-records hearsay exceptions and the Confrontation Clause. As we stated in <i>Crawford:</i> \"Most of the hearsay exceptions covered statements that by their nature were not testimonialfor example, business records or statements in furtherance of a conspiracy.\" 541 U.S., at 56, 124 S.Ct. 1354. Business and public records are generally admissible absent confrontation not because they qualify under an exception to the hearsay rules, but becausehaving been created for the administration of an entity's affairs and not for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2540</span> the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at trialthey are not testimonial. Whether or not they qualify as business or official records, the analysts' statements hereprepared specifically for use at petitioner's trialwere testimony against petitioner, and the analysts were subject to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E</h2>\n<p>Respondent asserts that we should find no Confrontation Clause violation in this case because petitioner had the ability to subpoena the analysts. But that powerwhether pursuant to state law or the Compulsory Process Clauseis no substitute for the right of confrontation. Unlike the Confrontation Clause, those provisions are of no use to the defendant when the witness is unavailable or simply refuses to appear. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Davis,</i> 547 U.S., at 820, 126 S.Ct. 2266 (\"[The witness] was subpoenaed, but she did not appear at ... trial\"). Converting the prosecution's duty under the Confrontation Clause into the defendant's privilege under state law or the Compulsory Process Clause shifts the consequences of adverse-witness no-shows from the State to the accused. More fundamentally, the Confrontation Clause imposes a burden on the prosecution to present its witnesses, not on the defendant to bring those adverse witnesses into court. Its value to the defendant is not replaced by a system in which the prosecution presents its evidence via <i>ex parte</i> affidavits and waits for the defendant to subpoena the affiants if he chooses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F</h2>\n<p>Finally, respondent asks us to relax the requirements of the Confrontation Clause to accommodate the \"`necessities of trial and the adversary process.'\" Brief for Respondent 59. It is not clear whence we would derive the authority to do so. The Confrontation Clause may make the prosecution of criminals more burdensome, but that is equally true of the right to trial by jury and the privilege against self-incrimination. The Confrontation Clauselike those other constitutional provisionsis binding, and we may not disregard it at our convenience.</p>\n<p>We also doubt the accuracy of respondent's and the dissent's dire predictions. The dissent, respondent, and its <i>amici</i> highlight the substantial total number of controlled-substance analyses performed by state and federal laboratories in recent years. But only some of those tests are implicated in prosecutions, and only a small fraction of those cases actually proceed to trial. See Brief for Law Professors as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 7-8 (nearly 95% of convictions in state and federal courts are obtained via guilty plea).<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>Perhaps the best indication that the sky will not fall after today's decision is that it has not done so already. Many States have already adopted the constitutional rule we announce today,<sup>[11]</sup> while many others <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2541</span> permit the defendant to assert (or forfeit by silence) his Confrontation Clause right after receiving notice of the prosecution's intent to use a forensic analyst's report, <i>id.,</i> at 13-15 (cataloging such state laws). Despite these widespread practices, there is no evidence that the criminal justice system has ground to a halt in the States that, one way or another, empower a defendant to insist upon the analyst's appearance at trial. Indeed, in Massachusetts itself, a defendant may subpoena the analyst to appear at trial, see Brief for Respondent 57, and yet there is no indication that obstructionist defendants are abusing the privilege.</p>\n<p>The dissent finds this evidence \"far less reassuring than promised.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2557. But its doubts rest on two flawed premises. First, the dissent believes that those state statutes \"requiring the defendant to give early notice of his intent to confront the analyst,\" are \"burden-shifting statutes [that] may be invalidated by the Court's reasoning.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2554, 2557-2558. That is not so. In their simplest form, notice-and-demand statutes require the prosecution to provide notice to the defendant of its intent to use an analyst's report as evidence at trial, after which the defendant is given a period of time in which he may object to the admission of the evidence absent the analyst's appearance live at trial. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Ga.Code Ann. § 35-3-154.1 (2006); Tex.Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 38.41, § 4 (Vernon 2005); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 2925.51(C) (West 2006). Contrary to the dissent's perception, these statutes shift no burden whatever. The defendant <i>always</i> has the burden of raising his Confrontation Clause objection; notice-and-demand statutes simply govern the <i>time</i> within which he must do so. States are free to adopt procedural rules governing objections. See <i>Wainwright v. Sykes,</i> 433 U.S. 72, 86-87, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977). It is common to require a defendant to exercise his rights under the Compulsory Process Clause in advance of trial, announcing his intent to present certain witnesses. See Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 12.1(a), (e), 16(b)(1)(C); Comment: Alibi Notice Rules: The Preclusion Sanction as Procedural Default, 51 U. Chi. L.Rev. 254, 254-255, 281-285 (1984) (discussing and cataloguing State notice-of-alibi rules); <i>Taylor v. Illinois,</i> 484 U.S. 400, 411, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988); <i>Williams v. Florida,</i> 399 U.S. 78, 81-82, 90 S.Ct. 1893, 26 L.Ed.2d 446 (1970). There is no conceivable reason why he cannot similarly be compelled to exercise his Confrontation Clause rights before trial. See <i>Hinojos-Mendoza v. People,</i> 169 P.3d 662, 670 (Colo.2007) (discussing and approving Colorado's notice-and-demand provision). Today's decision will not disrupt criminal prosecutions in the many large States whose practice is already in accord with the Confrontation Clause.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2542</span> Second, the dissent notes that several of the state-court cases that have already adopted this rule did so pursuant to our decision in <i>Crawford,</i> and not \"independently... as a matter of state law.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2558. That may be so. But in assessing the likely practical effects of today's ruling, it is irrelevant <i>why</i> those courts adopted this rule; it matters only <i>that</i> they did so. It is true that many of these decisions are recent, but if the dissent's dire predictions were accurate, and given the large number of drug prosecutions at the state level, one would have expected immediate and dramatic results. The absence of such evidence is telling.</p>\n<p>But it is not surprising. Defense attorneys and their clients will often stipulate to the nature of the substance in the ordinary drug case. It is unlikely that defense counsel will insist on live testimony whose effect will be merely to highlight rather than cast doubt upon the forensic analysis. Nor will defense attorneys want to antagonize the judge or jury by wasting their time with the appearance of a witness whose testimony defense counsel does not intend to rebut in any fashion.<sup>[13]</sup> The <i>amicus</i> brief filed by District Attorneys in Support of the Commonwealth in the Massachusetts Supreme Court case upon which the Appeals Court here relied said that \"it is almost always the case that [analysts' certificates] are admitted without objection. Generally, defendants do not object to the admission of drug certificates most likely because there is no benefit to a defendant from such testimony.\" Brief for District Attorneys in Support of the Commonwealth in No. SJC-09320 (Mass.), p. 7 (footnote omitted). Given these strategic considerations, and in light of the experience in those States that already provide the same or similar protections to defendants, there is little reason to believe that our decision today will commence the parade of horribles respondent and the dissent predict.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>This case involves little more than the application of our holding in <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. The Sixth Amendment does not permit the prosecution to prove its case via <i>ex parte</i> out-of-court affidavits, and the admission of such evidence against Melendez-Diaz was error.<sup>[14]</sup> We therefore reverse the judgment of the Appeals Court of Massachusetts and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2543</span> Justice THOMAS, concurring.</p>\n<p>I write separately to note that I continue to adhere to my position that \"the Confrontation Clause is implicated by extrajudicial statements only insofar as they are contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions.\" <i>White v. Illinois,</i> 502 U.S. 346, 365, 112 S.Ct. 736, 116 L.Ed.2d 848 (1992) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see also <i>Giles v. California,</i> 554 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 2678, 2693, 171 L.Ed.2d 488 (2008) (concurring opinion) (characterizing statements within the scope of the Confrontation Clause to include those that are \"sufficiently formal to resemble the Marian examinations\" because they were Mirandized or custodial or \"accompanied by [a] similar indicia of formality\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>Davis v. Washington,</i> 547 U.S. 813, 836, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006) (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (reiterating that the Clause encompasses extrajudicial statements contained in the types of formalized materials listed in <i>White, supra,</i> at 365, 112 S.Ct. 736. I join the Court's opinion in this case because the documents at issue in this case \"are quite plainly affidavits,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2532. As such, they \"fall within the core class of testimonial statements\" governed by the Confrontation Clause. <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>Justice KENNEDY, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice BREYER, and Justice ALITO join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court sweeps away an accepted rule governing the admission of scientific evidence. Until today, scientific analysis could be introduced into evidence without testimony from the \"analyst\" who produced it. This rule has been established for at least 90 years. It extends across at least 35 States and six Federal Courts of Appeals. Yet the Court undoes it based on two recent opinions that say nothing about forensic analysts: <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), and <i>Davis v. Washington,</i> 547 U.S. 813, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006).</p>\n<p>It is remarkable that the Court so confidently disregards a century of jurisprudence. We learn now that we have misinterpreted the Confrontation Clause hardly an arcane or seldom-used provision of the Constitutionfor the first 218 years of its existence. The immediate systemic concern is that the Court makes no attempt to acknowledge the real differences between laboratory analysts who perform scientific tests and other, more conventional witnesses\"witnesses\" being the word the Framers used in the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p><i>Crawford</i> and <i>Davis</i> dealt with ordinary witnesseswomen who had seen, and in two cases been the victim of, the crime in question. Those cases stand for the proposition that formal statements made by a conventional witnessone who has personal knowledge of some aspect of the defendant's guiltmay not be admitted without the witness appearing at trial to meet the accused face to face. But <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Davis</i> do not sayindeed, could not have said, because the facts were not before the Courtthat anyone who makes a testimonial statement is a witness for purposes of the Confrontation Clause, even when that person has, in fact, witnessed nothing to give them personal knowledge of the defendant's guilt.</p>\n<p>Because <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Davis</i> concerned typical witnesses, the Court should have done the sensible thing and limited its holding to witnesses as so defined. Indeed, as Justice THOMAS warned in his opinion in <i>Davis,</i> the Court's approach has <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2544</span> become \"disconnected from history and unnecessary to prevent abuse.\" 547 U.S., at 838, 126 S.Ct. 2266. The Court's reliance on the word \"testimonial\" is of little help, of course, for that word does not appear in the text of the Clause.</p>\n<p>The Court dictates to the States, as a matter of constitutional law, an as-yet-undefined set of rules governing what kinds of evidence may be admitted without in-court testimony. Indeed, under today's opinion the States bear an even more onerous burden than they did before <i>Crawford.</i> Then, the States at least had the guidance of the hearsay rule and could rest assured that \"where the evidence f[ell] within a firmly rooted hearsay exception,\" the Confrontation Clause did not bar its admission. <i>Ohio v. Roberts,</i> 448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980) (overruled by <i>Crawford</i>). Now, without guidance from any established body of law, the States can only guess what future rules this Court will distill from the sparse constitutional text. See, <i>e.g., Mendez, Crawford v. Washington</i>: A Critique, 57 Stan. L.Rev. 569, 586-593 (2004) (discussing unanswered questions regarding testimonial statements).</p>\n<p>The Court's opinion suggests this will be a body of formalistic and wooden rules, divorced from precedent, common sense, and the underlying purpose of the Clause. Its ruling has vast potential to disrupt criminal procedures that already give ample protections against the misuse of scientific evidence. For these reasons, as more fully explained below, the Court's opinion elicits my respectful dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>The Court says that, before the results of a scientific test may be introduced into evidence, the defendant has the right to confront the \"analyst.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2531-2532. One must assume that this term, though it appears nowhere in the Confrontation Clause, nevertheless has some constitutional substance that now must be elaborated in future cases. There is no accepted definition of analyst, and there is no established precedent to define that term.</p>\n<p>Consider how many people play a role in a routine test for the presence of illegal drugs. One person prepares a sample of the drug, places it in a testing machine, and retrieves the machine's printoutoften, a graph showing the frequencies of radiation absorbed by the sample or the masses of the sample's molecular fragments. See 2 P. Giannelli &amp; E. Imwinkelried, Scientific Evidence § 23.03 (4th ed.2007) (describing common methods of identifying drugs, including infrared spectrophotometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, gas chromatography, and mass spectrometry). A second person interprets the graph the machine prints out perhaps by comparing that printout with published, standardized graphs of known drugs. <i>Ibid.</i> Meanwhile, a third person perhaps an independent contractorhas calibrated the machine and, having done so, has certified that the machine is in good working order. Finally, a fourth personperhaps the laboratory's director certifies that his subordinates followed established procedures.</p>\n<p>It is not at all evident which of these four persons is the analyst to be confronted under the rule the Court announces today. If all are witnesses who must appear for in-court confrontation, then the Court has, for all practical purposes, forbidden the use of scientific tests in criminal trials. As discussed further below, requiring even one of these individuals to testify threatens to disrupt if not end <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2545</span> many prosecutions where guilt is clear but a newly found formalism now holds sway. See Part I-C, <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p>It is possible to read the Court's opinion, however, to say that all four must testify. Each one has contributed to the test's result and has, at least in some respects, made a representation about the test. Person One represents that a pure sample, properly drawn, entered the machine and produced a particular printout. Person Two represents that the printout corresponds to a known drug. Person Three represents that the machine was properly calibrated at the time. Person Four represents that all the others performed their jobs in accord with established procedures.</p>\n<p>And each of the four has power to introduce error. A laboratory technician might adulterate the sample. The independent contractor might botch the machine's calibration. And so forth. The reasons for these errors may range from animus against the particular suspect or all criminal suspects to unintentional oversight; from gross negligence to good-faith mistake. It is no surprise that a plausible case can be made for deeming each person in the testing process an analyst under the Court's opinion.</p>\n<p>Consider the independent contractor who has calibrated the testing machine. At least in a routine case, where the machine's result appears unmistakable, that result's accuracy depends entirely on the machine's calibration. The calibration, in turn, can be proved only by the contractor's certification that he or she did the job properly. That certification appears to be a testimonial statement under the Court's definition: It is a formal, out-of-court statement, offered for the truth of the matter asserted, and made for the purpose of later prosecution. See <i>ante,</i> at 2531-2532. It is not clear, under the Court's ruling, why the independent contractor is not also an analyst.</p>\n<p>Consider the person who interprets the machine's printout. His or her interpretation may call for the exercise of professional judgment in close cases. See Giannelli &amp; Imwinkelried, <i>supra.</i> If we assume no person deliberately introduces error, this interpretive step is the one most likely to permit human error to affect the test's result. This exercise of judgment might make this participant an analyst. The Court implies as much. See <i>ante,</i> at 2536-2537.</p>\n<p>And we must yet consider the laboratory director who certifies the ultimate results. The director is arguably the most effective person to confront for revealing any ambiguity in findings, variations in procedures, or problems in the office, as he or she is most familiar with the standard procedures, the office's variations, and problems in prior cases or with particular analysts. The prosecution may seek to introduce his or her certification into evidence. The Court implies that only those statements that are actually entered into evidence require confrontation. See <i>ante,</i> at 2531-2532. This could mean that the director is also an analyst, even if his or her certification relies upon or restates work performed by subordinates.</p>\n<p>The Court offers no principles or historical precedent to determine which of these persons is the analyst. All contribute to the test result. And each is equally remote from the scene, has no personal stake in the outcome, does not even know the accused, and is concerned only with the performance of his or her role in conducting the test.</p>\n<p>It could be argued that the only analyst who must testify is the person who signed the certificate. Under this view, a laboratory could have one employee sign certificates and appear in court, which would <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2546</span> spare all the other analysts this burden. But the Court has already rejected this arrangement. The Court made clear in <i>Davis</i> that it will not permit the testimonial statement of one witness to enter into evidence through the in-court testimony of a second:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[W]e do not think it conceivable that the protections of the Confrontation Clause can readily be evaded by having a note-taking policeman [here, the laboratory employee who signs the certificate] <i>recite</i> the unsworn hearsay testimony of the declarant [here, the analyst who performs the actual test], instead of having the declarant sign a deposition. Indeed, if there is one point for which no caseEnglish or early American, state or federalcan be cited, that is it.\" 547 U.S., at 826, 126 S.Ct. 2266.</blockquote>\n<p>Under this logic, the Court's holding cannot be cabined to the person who signs the certificates. If the signatory is restating the testimonial statements of the true analysts whoever they might bethen those analysts, too, must testify in person.</p>\n<p>Today's decision demonstrates that even in the narrow category of scientific tests that identify a drug, the Court cannot define with any clarity who the analyst is. Outside this narrow category, the range of other scientific tests that may be affected by the Court's new confrontation right is staggering. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Comment, Toward a Definition of \"Testimonial\": How Autopsy Reports Do Not Embody the Qualities of a Testimonial Statement, 96 Cal. L.Rev. 1093, 1094, 1115 (2008) (noting that every court post-<i>Crawford</i> has held that autopsy reports are not testimonial, and warning that a contrary rule would \"effectively functio[n] as a statute of limitations for murder\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>It is difficult to confine at this point the damage the Court's holding will do in other contexts. Consider just twoestablishing the chain of custody and authenticating a copy of a document.</p>\n<p>It is the obligation of the prosecution to establish the chain of custody for evidence sent to testing laboratoriesthat is, to establish \"the identity and integrity of physical evidence by tracing its continuous whereabouts.\" 23 C.J. S., Criminal Law § 1142, p. 66 (2008). Meeting this obligation requires representationsthat one officer retrieved the evidence from the crime scene, that a second officer checked it into an evidence locker, that a third officer verified the locker's seal was intact, and so forth. The iron logic of which the Court is so enamored would seem to require in-court testimony from each human link in the chain of custody. That, of course, has never been the law. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Lott,</i> 854 F.2d 244, 250 (C.A.7 1988) (\"[G]aps in the chain [of custody] normally go to the weight of the evidence rather than its admissibility\"); 29A Am.Jur.2d, Evidence § 962, p. 269 (2009) (\"The fact that one of the persons in control of a fungible substance does not testify at trial does not, without more, make the substance or testimony relating to it inadmissible\"); C.J.S., <i>supra,</i> § 1142, at 67 (\"It is generally not necessary that every witness who handled the evidence testify\").</p>\n<p>It is no answer for the Court to say that \"[i]t is up to the prosecution to decide what steps in the chain of custody are so crucial as to require evidence.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2532, n. 1. The case itself determines which links in the chain are crucialnot the prosecution. In any number of cases, the crucial link in the chain will not be available to testify and so the evidence will be excluded for lack of a proper foundation.</p>\n<p>Consider another context in which the Court's holding may cause disruption: The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2547</span> long-accepted practice of authenticating copies of documents by means of a certificate from the document's custodian stating that the copy is accurate. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Fed. Rule Evid. 902(4) (in order to be self-authenticating, a copy of a public record must be \"certified as correct by the custodian\"); Rule 902(11) (business record must be \"accompanied by a written declaration of its custodian\"). Under one possible reading of the Court's opinion, recordkeepers will be required to testify. So far, courts have not read <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Davis</i> to impose this largely meaningless requirement. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Adefehinti,</i> 510 F.3d 319, 327-328 (C.A.D.C.2008) (certificates authenticating bank records may be admitted without confrontation); <i>United States v. Ellis,</i> 460 F.3d 920, 927 (C.A.7 2006) (certificate authenticating hospital records). But the breadth of the Court's ruling today, and its undefined scope, may well be such that these courts now must be deemed to have erred. The risk of that consequence ought to tell us that something is very wrong with the Court's analysis.</p>\n<p>Because the Court is driven by nothing more than a wooden application of the <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Davis</i> definition of \"testimonial,\" divorced from any guidance from history, precedent, or common sense, there is no way to predict the future applications of today's holding. Surely part of the justification for the Court's formalism must lie in its predictability. There is nothing predictable here, however, other than the uncertainty and disruption that now must ensue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>With no precedent to guide us, let us assume that the Court's analyst is the person who interprets the machine's printout. This result makes no sense. The Confrontation Clause is not designed, and does not serve, to detect errors in scientific tests. That should instead be done by conducting a new test. Or, if a new test is impossible, the defendant may call his own expert to explain to the jury the test's flaws and the dangers of relying on it. And if, in an extraordinary case, the particular analyst's testimony is necessary to the defense, then, of course, the defendant may subpoena the analyst. The Court frets that the defendant may be unable to do so \"when the [analyst] is unavailable or simply refuses to appear.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2540. But laboratory analysts are not difficult to locate or to compel. As discussed below, analysts already devote considerable time to appearing in court when subpoenaed to do so. See Part I-C, <i>infra;</i> see also Brief for State of Alabama et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 26-28. Neither the Court, petitioner, nor <i>amici</i> offer any reason to believe that defendants have trouble subpoenaing analysts in cases where the analysts' in-court testimony is necessary.</p>\n<p>The facts of this case illustrate the formalistic and pointless nature of the Court's reading of the Clause. Petitioner knew, well in advance of trial, that the Commonwealth would introduce the tests against him. The bags of cocaine were in court, available for him to test, and entered into evidence. Yet petitioner made no effort, before or during trial, to mount a defense against the analysts' results. Petitioner could have challenged the tests' reliability by seeking discovery concerning the testing methods used or the qualifications of the laboratory analysts. See Mass. Rule Crim. Proc. 14(a)(2) (2009). He did not do so. Petitioner could have sought to conduct his own test. See Rule 41. Again, he did not seek a test; indeed, he did not argue that the drug was not cocaine. Rather than dispute the authenticity of the samples tested or the accuracy of the tests performed, petitioner argued to the jury <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2548</span> that the prosecution had not shown that he had possessed or dealt in the drugs.</p>\n<p>Despite not having prepared a defense to the analysts' results, petitioner's counsel made what can only be described as a <i>pro forma</i> objection to admitting the results without in-court testimony, presumably from one particular analyst. Today the Court, by deciding that this objection should have been sustained, transforms the Confrontation Clause from a sensible procedural protection into a distortion of the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p>It is difficult to perceive how the Court's holding will advance the purposes of the Confrontation Clause. One purpose of confrontation is to impress upon witnesses the gravity of their conduct. See <i>Coy v. Iowa,</i> 487 U.S. 1012, 1019-1020, 108 S.Ct. 2798, 101 L.Ed.2d 857 (1988). A witness, when brought to face the person his or her words condemn, might refine, reformulate, reconsider, or even recant earlier statements. See <i>ibid.</i> A further purpose is to alleviate the danger of one-sided interrogations by adversarial government officials who might distort a witness's testimony. The Clause guards against this danger by bringing the interrogation into the more neutral and public forum of the courtroom. See <i>Maryland v. Craig,</i> 497 U.S. 836, 869-870, 110 S.Ct. 3157, 111 L.Ed.2d 666 (1990) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (discussing the \"value of the confrontation right in guarding against a child's distorted or coerced recollections\"); see also 96 Cal. L.Rev., <i>supra,</i> at 1120-1122 (\"During private law-enforcement questioning, police officers or prosecutors can exert pressure on the witness without a high risk of being discovered. Courtroom questioning, in contrast, is public and performed in front of the jury, judge and defendant. Pressure is therefore harder to exert in court\").</p>\n<p>But neither purpose is served by the rule the Court announces today. It is not plausible that a laboratory analyst will retract his or her prior conclusion upon catching sight of the defendant the result condemns. After all, the analyst is far removed from the particular defendant and, indeed, claims no personal knowledge of the defendant's guilt. And an analyst performs hundreds if not thousands of tests each year and will not remember a particular test or the link it had to the defendant.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that analysts are infallible. They are not. It may well be that if the State does not introduce the machine printout or the raw results of a laboratory analysis; if it does not call an expert to interpret a test, particularly if that test is complex or little known; if it does not establish the chain of custody and the reliability of the laboratory; then the State will have failed to meet its burden of proof. That result follows because the State must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, without relying on presumptions, unreliable hearsay, and the like. See <i>United States v. United States Gypsum Co.,</i> 438 U.S. 422, 446, 98 S.Ct. 2864, 57 L.Ed.2d 854 (1978) (refusing to permit a \"`conclusive presumption [of intent],'\" which \"`would effectively eliminate intent as an ingredient of the offense'\" (quoting <i>Morissette v. United States,</i> 342 U.S. 246, 274-275, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952)). The State must permit the defendant to challenge the analyst's result. See <i>Holmes v. South Carolina,</i> 547 U.S. 319, 331, 126 S.Ct. 1727, 164 L.Ed.2d 503 (2006) (affirming the defendant's right to \"have a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). The rules of evidence, including those governing reliability under hearsay principles and the latitude to be given expert witnesses; the rules against irrebutable presumptions; and the overriding principle that the prosecution must make <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2549</span> its case beyond a reasonable doubtall these are part of the protections for the accused. The States, however, have some latitude in determining how these rules should be defined.</p>\n<p>The Confrontation Clause addresses who must testify. It simply does not follow, however, that this clause, in lieu of the other rules set forth above, controls who the prosecution must call on every issue. Suppose, for instance, that the defense challenges the procedures for a secure chain of custody for evidence sent to a lab and then returned to the police. The defense has the right to call its own witnesses to show that the chain of custody is not secure. But that does not mean it can demand that, in the prosecution's case in chief, each person who is in the chain of custodyand who had an undoubted opportunity to taint or tamper with the evidencemust be called by the prosecution under the Confrontation Clause. And the same is true with lab technicians.</p>\n<p>The Confrontation Clause is simply not needed for these matters. Where, as here, the defendant does not even dispute the accuracy of the analyst's work, confrontation adds nothing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>For the sake of these negligible benefits, the Court threatens to disrupt forensic investigations across the country and to put prosecutions nationwide at risk of dismissal based on erratic, all-too-frequent instances when a particular laboratory technician, now invested by the Court's new constitutional designation as the analyst, simply does not or cannot appear.</p>\n<p>Consider first the costs today's decision imposes on criminal trials. Our own Court enjoys weeks, often months, of notice before cases are argued. We receive briefs well in advance. The argument itself is ordered. A busy trial court, by contrast, must consider not only attorneys' schedules but also those of witnesses and juries. Trial courts have huge caseloads to be processed within strict time limits. Some cases may unexpectedly plead out at the last minute; others, just as unexpectedly, may not. Some juries stay out longer than predicted; others must be reconstituted. An analyst cannot hope to be the trial court's top priority in scheduling. The analyst must instead face the prospect of waiting for days in a hallway outside the courtroom before being called to offer testimony that will consist of little more than a rote recital of the written report. See Part I-B, <i>supra.</i></p>\n<p>As matters stood before today's opinion, analysts already spent considerable time appearing as witnesses in those few cases where the defendant, unlike petitioner in this case, contested the analyst's result and subpoenaed the analyst. See Brief for Alabama et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 26-28 (testifying takes time); <i>ante,</i> at 2542 (before today's opinion, it was \"`almost always the case that analysts' certificates [we]re admitted without objection'\" in Massachusetts courts). By requiring analysts also to appear in the far greater number of cases where defendants do not dispute the analyst's result, the Court imposes enormous costs on the administration of justice.</p>\n<p>Setting aside, for a moment, all the other crimes for which scientific evidence is required, consider the costs the Court's ruling will impose on state drug prosecutions alone. In 2004, the most recent year for which data are available, drug possession and trafficking resulted in 362,850 felony convictions in state courts across the country. See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, M. Durose &amp; P. Langan, Felony Sentences in State Courts 2004, p. 2 (July 2007). Roughly 95% of those convictions were products of plea <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2550</span> bargains, see <i>id.,</i> at 1, which means that state courts saw more than 18,000 drug trials in a single year.</p>\n<p>The analysts responsible for testing the drugs at issue in those cases now bear a crushing burden. For example, the district attorney in Philadelphia prosecuted 25,000 drug crimes in 2007. Brief for National Dist. Attorneys Association et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 12-13. Assuming that number remains the same, and assuming that 95% of the cases end in a plea bargain, each of the city's 18 drug analysts, <i>ibid.,</i> will be required to testify in more than 69 trials next year. Cleveland's district attorney prosecuted 14,000 drug crimes in 2007. <i>Ibid.</i> Assuming that number holds, and that 95% of the cases end in a plea bargain, each of the city's 6 drug analysts (two of whom work only part time) must testify in 117 drug cases next year. <i>Id.,</i> at 13.</p>\n<p>The Federal Government may face even graver difficulties than the States because its operations are so widespread. For example, the FBI laboratory at Quantico, Virginia, supports federal, state, and local investigations across the country. Its 500 employees conduct over one million scientific tests each year. Dept. of Justice, FBI Laboratory 2007, Message from the FBI Laboratory Director, http://www.fbi.gov/ hq/lab/lab2007/labannual07.pdf (as visited June 22, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). The Court's decision means that before any of those million tests reaches a jury, at least one of the laboratory's analysts must board a plane, find his or her way to an unfamiliar courthouse, and sit there waiting to read aloud notes made months ago.</p>\n<p>The Court purchases its meddling with the Confrontation Clause at a dear price, a price not measured in taxpayer dollars alone. Guilty defendants will go free, on the most technical grounds, as a direct result of today's decision, adding nothing to the truth-finding process. The analyst will not always make it to the courthouse in time. He or she may be ill; may be out of the country; may be unable to travel because of inclement weather; or may at that very moment be waiting outside some other courtroom for another defendant to exercise the right the Court invents today. If for any reason the analyst cannot make it to the courthouse in time, then, the Court holds, the jury cannot learn of the analyst's findings (unless, by some unlikely turn of events, the defendant previously cross-examined the analyst). <i>Ante,</i> at 2531. The result, in many cases, will be that the prosecution cannot meet its burden of proof, and the guilty defendant goes free on a technicality that, because it results in an acquittal, cannot be reviewed on appeal.</p>\n<p>The Court's holding is a windfall to defendants, one that is unjustified by any demonstrated deficiency in trials, any well-understood historical requirement, or any established constitutional precedent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>All of the problems with today's decisionthe imprecise definition of \"analyst,\" the lack of any perceptible benefit, the heavy societal costswould be of no moment if the Constitution did, in fact, require the Court to rule as it does today. But the Constitution does not.</p>\n<p>The Court's fundamental mistake is to read the Confrontation Clause as referring to a kind of out-of-court statementnamely, a testimonial statementthat must be excluded from evidence. The Clause does not refer to kinds of statements. Nor does the Clause contain the word \"testimonial.\" The text, instead, refers to kinds of persons, namely, to \"witnesses against\" the defendant. Laboratory analysts are not \"witnesses against\" the defendant as those <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2551</span> words would have been understood at the framing. There is simply no authority for this proposition.</p>\n<p>Instead, the Clause refers to a conventional \"witness\"meaning one who witnesses (that is, perceives) an event that gives him or her personal knowledge of some aspect of the defendant's guilt. Both <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Davis</i> concerned just this kind of ordinary witnessand nothing in the Confrontation Clause's text, history, or precedent justifies the Court's decision to expand those cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Clause states: \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\" U.S. Const., Amdt. 6. Though there is \"virtually no evidence of what the drafters of the Confrontation Clause intended it to mean,\" <i>White v. Illinois,</i> 502 U.S. 346, 359, 112 S.Ct. 736, 116 L.Ed.2d 848 (1992) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), it is certain the Framers did not contemplate that an analyst who conducts a scientific test far removed from the crime would be considered a \"witnes[s] against\" the defendant.</p>\n<p>The Framers were concerned with a typical witnessone who perceived an event that gave rise to a personal belief in some aspect of the defendant's guilt. There is no evidence that the Framers understood the Clause to extend to unconventional witnesses. As discussed below, there is significant evidence to the contrary. See Part II-B, <i>infra.</i> In these circumstances, the historical evidence in support of the Court's position is \"`too meager ... to form a solid basis in history, preceding and contemporaneous with the framing of the Constitution.'\" <i>Boumediene v. Bush,</i> 553 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 2229, 2251, 171 L.Ed.2d 41 (2008) (quoting <i>Reid v. Covert,</i> 354 U.S. 1, 64, 77 S.Ct. 1222, 1 L.Ed.2d 1148 (1957) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in result)). The Court goes dangerously wrong when it bases its constitutional interpretation upon historical guesswork.</p>\n<p>The infamous treason trial of Sir Walter Raleigh provides excellent examples of the kinds of witnesses to whom the Confrontation Clause refers. <i>Raleigh's Case,</i> 2 How. St. Tr. 1 (1603); see <i>Crawford,</i> 541 U.S., at 44-45, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (Raleigh's trial informs our understanding of the Clause because it was, at the time of the framing, one of the \"most notorious instances\" of the abuse of witnesses' out-of-court statements); <i>ante,</i> at 2534 (same). Raleigh's accusers claimed to have heard Raleigh speak treason, so they were witnesses in the conventional sense. We should limit the Confrontation Clause to witnesses like those in Raleigh's trial.</p>\n<p>The Court today expands the Clause to include laboratory analysts, but analysts differ from ordinary witnesses in at least three significant ways. First, a conventional witness recalls events observed in the past, while an analyst's report contains near-contemporaneous observations of the test. An observation recorded at the time it is made is unlike the usual act of testifying. A typical witness must recall a previous event that he or she perceived just once, and thus may have misperceived or misremembered. But an analyst making a contemporaneous observation need not rely on memory; he or she instead reports the observations at the time they are made. We gave this consideration substantial weight in <i>Davis.</i> There, the \"primary purpose\" of the victim's 911 call was \"to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency,\" rather than \"to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\" 547 U.S., at 822, 827, 126 S.Ct. 2266. See <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2552</span> also <i>People v. Geier,</i> 41 Cal.4th 555, 605-609, 61 Cal.Rptr.3d 580, 161 P.3d 104, 139-141 (2007). The Court cites no authority for its holding that an observation recorded at the time it is made is an act of \"witness[ing]\" for purposes of the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p>Second, an analyst observes neither the crime nor any human action related to it. Often, the analyst does not know the defendant's identity, much less have personal knowledge of an aspect of the defendant's guilt. The analyst's distance from the crime and the defendant, in both space and time, suggests the analyst is not a witness against the defendant in the conventional sense.</p>\n<p>Third, a conventional witness responds to questions under interrogation. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Raleigh's Case, supra,</i> at 15-20. But laboratory tests are conducted according to scientific protocols; they are not dependent upon or controlled by interrogation of any sort. Put differently, out-of-court statements should only \"require confrontation if they are produced by, or with the involvement of, adversarial government officials responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\" 96 Cal. L.Rev., at 1118. There is no indication that the analysts herewho work for the State Laboratory Institute, a division of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health were adversarial to petitioner. Nor is there any evidence that adversarial officials played a role in formulating the analysts' certificates.</p>\n<p>Rather than acknowledge that it expands the Confrontation Clause beyond conventional witnesses, the Court relies on our recent opinions in <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Davis. Ante,</i> at 2531-2532. The Court assumes, with little analysis, that <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Davis</i> extended the Clause to any person who makes a \"testimonial\" statement. But the Court's confident tone cannot disguise the thinness of these two reeds. Neither <i>Crawford</i> nor <i>Davis</i> considered whether the Clause extends to persons far removed from the crime who have no connection to the defendant. Instead, those cases concerned conventional witnesses. <i>Davis, supra,</i> at 826-830, 126 S.Ct. 2266 (witnesses were victims of defendants' assaults); <i>Crawford, supra,</i> at 38, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (witness saw defendant stab victim).</p>\n<p>It is true that <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Davis</i> employed the term \"testimonial,\" and thereby suggested that any testimonial statement, by any person, no matter how distant from the defendant and the crime, is subject to the Confrontation Clause. But that suggestion was not part of the holding of <i>Crawford</i> or <i>Davis.</i> Those opinions used the adjective \"testimonial\" to avoid the awkward phrasing required by reusing the noun \"witness.\" The Court today transforms that turn of phrase into a new and sweeping legal rule, by holding that anyone who makes a formal statement for the purpose of later prosecutionno matter how removed from the crimemust be considered a \"witness against\" the defendant. <i>Ante,</i> at 2531-2532. The Court cites no authority to justify this expansive new interpretation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>No historical evidence supports the Court's conclusion that the Confrontation Clause was understood to extend beyond conventional witnesses to include analysts who conduct scientific tests far removed from the crime and the defendant. Indeed, what little evidence there is contradicts this interpretation.</p>\n<p>Though the Framers had no forensic scientists, they did use another kind of unconventional witnessthe copyist. A copyist's work may be as essential to a criminal prosecution as the forensic analyst's. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2553</span> To convict a man of bigamy, for example, the State often requires his marriage records. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Williams v. State,</i> 54 Ala. 131, 134, 135 (1875); <i>State v. Potter,</i> 52 Vt. 33, 38 (1879). But if the original records cannot be taken from the archive, the prosecution must rely on copies of those records, made for the purpose of introducing the copies into evidence at trial. See <i>ibid.</i> In that case, the copyist's honesty and diligence are just as important as the analyst's here. If the copyist falsifies a copy, or even misspells a name or transposes a date, those flaws could lead the jury to convict. Because so much depends on his or her honesty and diligence, the copyist often prepares an affidavit certifying that the copy is true and accurate.</p>\n<p>Such a certificate is beyond question a testimonial statement under the Court's definition: It is a formal out-of-court statement offered for the truth of two matters (the copyist's honesty and the copy's accuracy), and it is prepared for a criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p>During the Framers' era copyists' affidavits were accepted without hesitation by American courts. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Percheman,</i> 7 Pet. 51, 85, 8 L.Ed. 604 (1833) (opinion for the Court by Marshall, C. J.); see also Advisory Committee's Note on Fed. Rule Evid. 902(4), 28 U.S.C.App., p. 390 (\"The common law ... recognized the procedure of authenticating copies of public records by certificate\"); 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence §§ 1677, 1678 (J. Chadbourn rev.1974). And courts admitted copyists' affidavits in criminal as well as civil trials. See <i>Williams, supra</i><i>; </i><i>Potter, supra</i><i>.</i> This demonstrates that the framing generation, in contrast to the Court today, did not consider the Confrontation Clause to require in-court confrontation of unconventional authors of testimonial statements.</p>\n<p>The Court attempts to explain away this historical exception to its rule by noting that a copyist's authority is \"narrowly circumscribed.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2539. But the Court does not explain why that matters, nor, if it does matter, why laboratory analysts' authority should not also be deemed \"narrowly circumscribed\" so that they, too, may be excused from testifying. And drawing these fine distinctions cannot be squared with the Court's avowed allegiance to formalism. Determining whether a witness' authority is \"narrowly circumscribed\" has nothing to do with <i>Crawford</i>'s testimonial framework. It instead appears much closer to the pre-<i>Crawford</i> rule of <i>Ohio v. Roberts</i><i>,</i> under which a statement could be admitted without testimony if it \"bears adequate indicia of reliability.\" 448 U.S., at 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>In keeping with the traditional understanding of the Confrontation Clause, this Court in <i>Dowdell v. United States,</i> 221 U.S. 325, 31 S.Ct. 590, 55 L.Ed. 753 (1911), rejected a challenge to the use of certificates, sworn out by a clerk of court, a trial judge, and a court reporter, stating that defendants had been present at trial. Those certificates, like a copyist's certificate, met every requirement of the Court's current definition of \"testimonial.\" In rejecting the defendants' claim that use of the certificates violated the Confrontation Clause, the Court in <i>Dowdell</i> explained that the officials who executed the certificates \"were not witnesses against the accused\" because they \"were not asked to testify to facts concerning [the defendants'] guilt or innocence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 330, 31 S.Ct. 590. Indeed, as recently as <i>Davis,</i> the Court reaffirmed <i>Dowdell.</i> 547 U.S., at 825, 126 S.Ct. 2266.</p>\n<p>By insisting that every author of a testimonial statement appear for confrontation, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2554</span> on pain of excluding the statement from evidence, the Court does violence to the Framers' sensible, and limited, conception of the right to confront \"witnesses against\" the defendant.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>In addition to lacking support in historical practice or in this Court's precedent, the Court's decision is also contrary to authority extending over at least 90 years, 35 States, and six Federal Courts of Appeals.</p>\n<p>Almost 100 years ago three state supreme courts held that their state constitutions did not require analysts to testify in court. In a case much like this one, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld the admission of a certificate stating that the liquid seized from the defendant contained alcohol, even though the author of the certificate did not testify. <i>Commonwealth v. Slavski,</i> 245 Mass. 405, 413, 140 N.E. 465, 467 (1923). The highest courts in Connecticut and Virginia reached similar conclusions under their own constitutions. <i>State v. Torello,</i> 103 Conn. 511, 131 A. 429 (1925); <i>Bracey v. Commonwealth,</i> 119 Va. 867, 89 S.E. 144 (1916). Just two state courts appear to have read a state constitution to require a contrary result. <i>State v. Clark,</i> 290 Mont. 479, 484-489, 964 P.2d 766, 770-772 (1998) (laboratory drug report requires confrontation under Montana's Constitution, which is \"[u]nlike its federal counterpart\"); <i>State v. Birchfield,</i> 342 Or. 624, 157 P.3d 216 (2007), but see <i>id.,</i> at 631-632, 157 P.3d, at 220 (suggesting that a \"typical notice requirement\" would be lawful).</p>\n<p>As for the Federal Constitution, before <i>Crawford</i> the authority was stronger still: The Sixth Amendment does not require analysts to testify in court. All Federal Courts of Appeals to consider the issue agreed. <i>Sherman v. Scott,</i> 62 F.3d 136, 139-142 (C.A.5 1995); <i>Minner v. Kerby,</i> 30 F.3d 1311, 1313-1315 (C.A.10 1994); <i>United States v. Baker,</i> 855 F.2d 1353, 1359-1360 (C.A.8 1988); <i>Reardon v. Manson,</i> 806 F.2d 39 (C.A.2 1986); <i>Kay v. United States,</i> 255 F.2d 476, 480-481 (C.A.4 1958); see also <i>Manocchio v. Moran,</i> 919 F.2d 770, 777-782 (C.A.1 1990) (autopsy report stating cause of victim's death). Some 24 state courts, and the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, were in accord. See Appendix A, <i>infra.</i> (Some cases cited in the appendixes concern doctors, coroners, and calibrators rather than laboratory analysts, but their reasoning is much the same.) Eleven more state courts upheld burden-shifting statutes that reduce, if not eliminate, the right to confrontation by requiring the defendant to take affirmative steps prior to trial to summon the analyst. See <i>ibid.</i> Because these burden-shifting statutes may be invalidated by the Court's reasoning, these 11 decisions, too, appear contrary to today's opinion. See Part III-B, <i>infra.</i> Most of the remaining States, far from endorsing the Court's view, appear not to have addressed the question prior to <i>Crawford.</i> Against this weight of authority, the Court proffers just two cases from intermediate state courts of appeals. <i>Ante,</i> at 2533-2534.</p>\n<p>On a practical level, today's ruling would cause less disruption if the States' hearsay rules had already required analysts to testify. But few States require this. At least sixteen state courts have held that their evidentiary rules permit scientific test results, calibration certificates, and the observations of medical personnel to enter evidence without in-court testimony. See Appendix B, <i>infra.</i> The Federal Courts of Appeals have reached the same conclusion in applying the federal hearsay rule. <i>United States v. Garnett,</i> 122 F.3d 1016, 1018-1019 (C.A.11 1997) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>United States v. Gilbert,</i> 774 F.2d 962, 965 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2555</span> (C.A.9 1985) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>United States v. Ware,</i> 247 F.2d 698, 699-700 (C.A.7 1957); but see <i>United States v. Oates,</i> 560 F.2d 45, 82 (C.A.2 1977) (report prepared by law enforcement not admissible under public-records or business-records exceptions to federal hearsay rule).</p>\n<p>The modern trend in the state courts has been away from the Court's rule and toward the admission of scientific test results without testimonyperhaps because the States have recognized the increasing reliability of scientific testing. See Appendix B, <i>infra</i> (citing cases from three States overruling or limiting previous precedents that had adopted the Court's rule as a matter of state law). It appears that a mere six courts continue to interpret their States' hearsay laws to require analysts to testify. See <i>ibid.</i> And, of course, where courts have grounded their decisions in state law, rather than the Constitution, the legislatures in those States have had, until now, the power to abrogate the courts' interpretation if the costs were shown to outweigh the benefits. Today the Court strips that authority from the States by carving the minority view into the constitutional text.</p>\n<p>State legislatures, and not the Members of this Court, have the authority to shape the rules of evidence. The Court therefore errs when it relies in such great measure on the recent report of the National Academy of Sciences. <i>Ante,</i> at 2536-2537 (discussing National Research Council of the National Academies, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward (Prepublication Copy Feb. 2009)). That report is not directed to this Court, but rather to the elected representatives in Congress and the state legislatures, who, unlike Members of this Court, have the power and competence to determine whether scientific tests are unreliable and, if so, whether testimony is the proper solution to the problem.</p>\n<p>The Court rejects the well-established understandingextending across at least 90 years, 35 States and six Federal Courts of Appealsthat the Constitution does not require analysts to testify in court before their analysis may be introduced into evidence. The only authority on which the Court can rely is its own speculation on the meaning of the word \"testimonial,\" made in two recent opinions that said nothing about scientific analysis or scientific analysts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>In an attempt to show that the \"sky will not fall after today's decision,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2540, the Court makes three arguments, none of which withstands scrutiny.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In an unconvincing effort to play down the threat that today's new rule will disrupt or even end criminal prosecutions, the Court professes a hope that defense counsel will decline to raise what will soon be known as the <i>Melendez-Diaz</i> objection. <i>Ante,</i> at 2542. The Court bases this expectation on its understanding that defense attorneys surrender constitutional rights because the attorneys do not \"want to antagonize the judge or jury by wasting their time.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Court's reasoning is troubling on at least two levels. First, the Court's speculation rests on the apparent belief that our Nation's trial judges and jurors are unwilling to accept zealous advocacy and that, once \"antagonize[d]\" by it, will punish such advocates with adverse rulings. <i>Ibid.</i> The Court offers no support for this stunning slur on the integrity of the Nation's courts. It is commonplace for the defense to request, at the conclusion of the prosecution's opening case, a directed verdict of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2556</span> acquittal. If the prosecution has failed to prove an element of the crimeeven an element that is technical and rather obvious, such as movement of a car in interstate commercethen the case must be dismissed. Until today one would not have thought that judges should be angered at the defense for making such motions, nor that counsel has some sort of obligation to avoid being troublesome when the prosecution has not done all the law requires to prove its case.</p>\n<p>Second, even if the Court were right to expect trial judges to feel \"antagonize[d]\" by <i>Melendez-Diaz</i> objections and to then vent their anger by punishing the lawyer in some way, there is no authority to support the Court's suggestion that a lawyer may shirk his or her professional duties just to avoid judicial displeasure. There is good reason why the Court cites no authority for this suggestionit is contrary to what some of us, at least, have long understood to be defense counsel's duty to be a zealous advocate for every client. This Court has recognized the bedrock principle that a competent criminal defense lawyer must put the prosecution to its proof:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[T]he adversarial process protected by the Sixth Amendment requires that the accused have `counsel acting in the role of an advocate.' <i>Anders v. California,</i> 386 U.S. 738, 743, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). The right to the effective assistance of counsel is thus the right of the accused to require the prosecution's case to survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing. When a true adversarial criminal trial has been conducted ... the kind of testing envisioned by the Sixth Amendment has occurred. But if the process loses its character as a confrontation between adversaries, the constitutional guarantee is violated.\" <i>United States v. Cronic,</i> 466 U.S. 648, 656-657, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984) (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>See also ABA Model Code of Professional Responsibility, Canon 7-1, in ABA Compendium of Professional Responsibility Rules and Standards (2008) (\"The duty of a lawyer, both to his client and to the legal system, is to represent his client zealously within the bounds of the law ...\" (footnotes omitted)).</p>\n<p>The instant case demonstrates how zealous defense counsel will defend their clients. To convict, the prosecution must prove the substance is cocaine. Under the Court's new rule, apparently only an analyst's testimony suffices to prove that fact. (Of course there will also be a large universe of other crimes, ranging from homicide to robbery, where scientific evidence is necessary to prove an element.) In cases where scientific evidence is necessary to prove an element of the crime, the Court's rule requires the prosecution to call the person identified as the analyst; this requirement has become a new prosecutorial duty linked with proving the State's case beyond a reasonable doubt. Unless the Court is ashamed of its new rule, it is inexplicable that the Court seeks to limit its damage by hoping that defense counsel will be derelict in their duty to insist that the prosecution prove its case. That is simply not the way the adversarial system works.</p>\n<p>In any event, the Court's hope is sure to prove unfounded. The Court surmises that \"[i]t is unlikely that defense counsel will insist on live testimony whose effect will be merely to highlight rather than cast doubt upon the forensic analysis.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2542. This optimistic prediction misunderstands how criminal trials work. If the defense does not plan to challenge the test result, \"highlight[ing]\" that result through testimony does not harm the defense as the Court supposes. If the analyst cannot <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2557</span> reach the courtroom in time to testify, however, a <i>Melendez-Diaz</i> objection grants the defense a great windfall: The analyst's work cannot come into evidence. Given the prospect of such a windfall (which may, in and of itself, secure an acquittal) few zealous advocates will pledge, prior to trial, not to raise a <i>Melendez-Diaz</i> objection. Defense counsel will accept the risk that the jury may hear the analyst's live testimony, in exchange for the chance that the analyst fails to appear and the government's case collapses. And if, as here, the defense is not that the substance was harmless, but instead that the accused did not possess it, the testimony of the technician is a formalism that does not detract from the defense case.</p>\n<p>In further support of its unlikely hope, the Court relies on the Brief for Law Professors as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 7-8, which reports that nearly 95% of convictions are obtained via guilty plea and thus do not require in-court testimony from laboratory analysts. <i>Ante,</i> at 2540. What the Court does not consider is how its holding will alter these statistics. The defense bar today gains the formidable power to require the government to transport the analyst to the courtroom at the time of trial. Zealous counsel will insist upon concessions: a plea bargain, or a more lenient sentence in exchange for relinquishing this remarkable power.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>As further reassurance that the \"sky will not fall after today's decision,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2540, the Court notes that many States have enacted burden-shifting statutes that require the defendant to assert his Confrontation Clause right prior to trial or else \"forfeit\" it \"by silence.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The Court implies that by shifting the burden to the defendant to take affirmative steps to produce the analyst, these statutes reduce the burden on the prosecution.</p>\n<p>The Court holds that these burden-shifting statutes are valid because, in the Court's view, they \"shift no burden whatever.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2541. While this conclusion is welcome, the premise appears flawed. Even what the Court calls the \"simplest form\" of burden-shifting statutes do impose requirements on the defendant, who must make a formal demand, with proper service, well before trial. Some statutes impose more requirements, for instance by requiring defense counsel to subpoena the analyst, to show good cause for demanding the analyst's presence, or even to affirm under oath an intent to cross-examine the analyst. See generally Metzger, Cheating the Constitution, 59 Vand. L.Rev. 475, 481-485 (2006). In a future case, the Court may find that some of these more onerous burden-shifting statutes violate the Confrontation Clause because they \"impos[e] a burden ... on the defendant to bring ... adverse witnesses into court.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2540.</p>\n<p>The burden-shifting statutes thus provide little reassurance that this case will not impose a meaningless formalism across the board.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>In a further effort to support its assessment that today's decision will not cause disruption, the Court cites 10 decisions from States that, the Court asserts, \"have already adopted the constitutional rule we announce today.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2540, and n. 11. The Court assures us that \"there is no evidence that the criminal justice system has ground to a halt in the[se] States.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2540.</p>\n<p>On inspection, the citations prove far less reassuring than promised. Seven were decided by courts that considered themselves bound by <i>Crawford.</i> These <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2558</span> cases thus offer no support for the Court's assertion that the state jurists independently \"adopted\" the Court's interpretation as a matter of state law. Quite the contrary, the debate in those seven courts was over just how far this Court intended <i>Crawford</i> to sweep. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>State v. Belvin,</i> 986 So.2d 516, 526 (Fla.2008) (Wells, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\"I believe that the majority has extended the <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Davis</i> decisions beyond their intended reach\" (citations omitted)). The Court should correct these courts' overbroad reading of <i>Crawford,</i> not endorse it. Were the Court to do so, these seven jurisdictions might well change their position.</p>\n<p>Moreover, because these seven courts only \"adopted\" the Court's position in the wake of <i>Crawford,</i> their decisions are all quite recent. These States have not yet been subject to the widespread, adverse results of the formalism the Court mandates today.</p>\n<p>The citations also fail to reassure for a different reason. Five of the Court's 10 citationsincluding all 3 pre-<i>Crawford</i> casescome from States that have reduced the confrontation right. Four States have enacted a burden-shifting statute requiring the defendant to give early notice of his intent to confront the analyst. See Part III-B, <i>supra;</i> Colorado: <i>Hinojos-Mendoza v. People,</i> 169 P.3d 662, 668-671 (Colo.2007), Colo.Rev.Stat. § 16-3-309 (2008) (defendant must give notice 10 days before trial); Georgia: Compare <i>Miller v. State,</i> 266 Ga. 850, 854-855, 472 S.E.2d 74, 78-79 (1996) (striking down earlier notice statute requiring defendant to show good cause, prior to trial, to call the analyst), with Ga.Code Ann. § 35-3-154.1 (2006) (defendant must give notice 10 days before trial); Illinois: <i>People v. McClanahan,</i> 191 Ill.2d 127, 133-134, 246 Ill.Dec. 97, 729 N.E.2d 470, 474-475 (2000), Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 725, § 5/115-15 (2006) (defendant must give notice \"within 7 days\" of \"receipt of the report\"); Oregon: <i>State v. Birchfield,</i> 342 Or., at 631-632, 157 P.3d, at 220 (suggesting that a \"typical notice requirement\" would be lawful), see Ore.Rev. Stat. § 475.235 (2007) (defendant must give notice 15 days before trial). A fifth State, Mississippi, excuses the prosecution from producing the analyst who conducted the test, so long as it produces someone. Compare <i>Barnette v. State,</i> 481 So.2d 788, 792 (Miss.1985) (cited by the Court), with <i>McGowen v. State,</i> 859 So.2d 320, 339-340 (Miss.2003) (the Sixth Amendment does not require confrontation with the particular analyst who conducted the test). It is possible that neither Mississippi's practice nor the burden-shifting statutes can be reconciled with the Court's holding. See Part III-B, <i>supra.</i> The disruption caused by today's decision has yet to take place in these States.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Laboratory analysts who conduct routine scientific tests are not the kind of conventional witnesses to whom the Confrontation Clause refers.

While the dissent is correct that \"[i]t is the obligation of the prosecution to establish the chain of custody,\" <i>post,</i> at 2546, this does not mean that everyone who laid hands on the evidence must be called. As stated in the dissent's own quotation, <i>ibid.,</i> from <i>United States v. Lott,</i> 854 F.2d 244, 250 (C.A.7 1988), \"gaps in the chain [of custody] normally go to the weight of the evidence rather than its admissibility.\" It is up to the prosecution to decide what steps in the chain of custody are so crucial as to require evidence; but what testimony <i>is</i> introduced must (if the defendant objects) be introduced live. Additionally, documents prepared in the regular course of equipment maintenance may well qualify as nontestimonial records. See <i>infra,</i> at 2550-2551, 2552.</p>\n<p>[2]  The exception is a single pre-<i>Roberts</i> case that relied on longstanding Massachusetts precedent. See <i>Commonwealth v. Harvard,</i> 356 Mass. 452, 462, 253 N.E.2d 346, 352 (1969). Others are simply irrelevant, since they involved medical reports created for treatment purposes, which would not be testimonial under our decision today. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Baber v. State,</i> 775 So.2d 258, 258-259 (Fla. 2000); <i>State v. Garlick,</i> 313 Md. 209, 223-225, 545 A.2d 27, 34-35 (1988).</p>\n<p>[3]  The right to confrontation may, of course, be waived, including by failure to object to the offending evidence; and States may adopt procedural rules governing the exercise of such objections. See <i>infra,</i> at 2554.</p>\n<p>[4]  Respondent cites our decision in <i>Gray v. Maryland,</i> 523 U.S. 185, 118 S.Ct. 1151, 140 L.Ed.2d 294 (1998). That case did indeed distinguish between evidence that is \"incriminating on its face\" and evidence that \"bec[omes] incriminating... only when linked with evidence introduced later at trial,\" <i>id.,</i> at 191, 118 S.Ct. 1151 (internal quotation marks omitted). But it did so for the entirely different purpose of determining when a nontestifying codefendant's confession, redacted to remove all mention of the defendant, could be admitted into evidence with instruction for the jury not to consider the confession as evidence against the nonconfessor. The very premise of the case was that, without the limiting instruction even admission of a redacted confession containing evidence of the latter sort <i>would have</i> violated the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights. See <i>id.,</i> at 190-191, 118 S.Ct. 1151.</p>\n<p>[5]  Though surely not always. Some forensic analyses, such as autopsies and breathalyzer tests, cannot be repeated, and the specimens used for other analyses have often been lost or degraded.</p>\n<p>[6]  Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, <i>post,</i> at 2555, we do not \"rel[y] in such great measure\" on the deficiencies of crime-lab analysts shown by this report to resolve the constitutional question presented in this case. The analysts who swore the affidavits provided testimony against Melendez-Diaz, and they are therefore subject to confrontation; we would reach the same conclusion if all analysts always possessed the scientific acumen of Mme. Curie and the veracity of Mother Theresa. We discuss the report only to refute the suggestion that this category of evidence is uniquely reliable and that cross-examination of the analysts would be an empty formalism.</p>\n<p>[7]  The early common-law cases likewise involve records prepared for the administration of an entity's affairs, and not for use in litigation. See, <i>e.g., King v. Rhodes,</i> 1 Leach 24, 168 Eng. Rep. 115 (1742) (admitting into evidence ship's muster-book); <i>King v. Martin,</i> 2 Camp. 100, 101, 170 Eng. Rep. 1094, 1095 (1809) (vestry book); <i>King v. Aickles,</i> 1 Leach 390, 391-392, 168 Eng. Rep. 297, 298 (1785) (prison logbook).</p>\n<p>[8]  The dissent's reliance on our decision in <i>Dowdell v. United States,</i> 221 U.S. 325, 31 S.Ct. 590, 55 L.Ed. 753 (1911), see <i>post,</i> at 2553 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.), is similarly misplaced. As the opinion stated in <i>Dowdell</i>and as this Court noted in <i>Davis v. Washington,</i> 547 U.S. 813, 825, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006)the judge and clerk who made the statements at issue in <i>Dowdell</i> were not witnesses for purposes of the Confrontation Clause because their statements concerned only the conduct of defendants' prior trial, not any facts regarding defendants' guilt or innocence. 221 U.S., at 330-331, 31 S.Ct. 590.</p>\n<p>[9]  An earlier line of 19th century state-court cases also supports the notion that forensic analysts' certificates were not admitted into evidence as public or business records. See <i>Commonwealth v. Waite,</i> 93 Mass. 264, 266 (1865); <i>Shivers v. Newton,</i> 45 N.J.L. 469, 476 (Sup.Ct.1883); <i>State v. Campbell,</i> 64 N.H. 402, 403, 13 A. 585, 586 (1888). In all three cases, defendantswho were prosecuted for selling adulterated milkobjected to the admission of the state chemists' certificates of analysis. In all three cases, the objection was defeated because the chemist testified live at trial. That the prosecution came forward with live witnesses in all three cases suggests doubt as to the admissibility of the certificates without opportunity for cross-examination.</p>\n<p>[10]  The dissent provides some back-of-the-envelope calculations regarding the number of court appearances that will result from today's ruling. <i>Post,</i> at 2549-2550. Those numbers rely on various unfounded assumptions: that the prosecution will place into evidence a drug analysis certificate in every case; that the defendant will never stipulate to the nature of the controlled substance; that even where no such stipulation is made, every defendant will object to the evidence or otherwise demand the appearance of the analyst. These assumptions are wildly unrealistic, and, as discussed below, the figures they produce do not reflect what has in fact occurred in those jurisdictions that have already adopted the rule we announce today.</p>\n<p>[11]  <i>State v. Johnson,</i> 982 So. 2d 672, 680-681 (Fla.2008); <i>Hinojos-Mendoza v. People,</i> 169 P.3d 662, 666-667 (Colo.2007); <i>State v.

McClanahan,</i> 191 Ill.2d 127, 133-134, 246 Ill.Dec. 97, 729 N.E.2d 470, 474-475 (2000); <i>Miller v. State,</i> 266 Ga. 850, 854-855, 472 S.E.2d 74, 78-79 (1996); <i>Barnette v. State,</i> 481 So.2d 788, 792 (Miss.1985).</p>\n<p>[12]  As the dissent notes, <i>post,</i> at 2557, <i>some</i> state statutes, \"requir[e] defense counsel to subpoena the analyst, to show good cause for demanding the analyst's presence, or even to affirm under oath an intent to cross-examine the analyst.\" We have no occasion today to pass on the constitutionality of every variety of statute commonly given the notice-and-demand label. It suffices to say that what we have referred to as the \"simplest form [of] notice-and-demand statutes,\" <i>supra,</i> at 2541, is constitutional; that such provisions are in place in a number of States; and that in those States, and in other States that require confrontation without notice-and-demand, there is no indication that the dire consequences predicted by the dissent have materialized.</p>\n<p>[13]  Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, <i>post,</i> at 2555-2556, we do not cast aspersions on trial judges, who we trust will not be antagonized by good-faith requests for analysts' appearance at trial. Nor do we expect defense attorneys to refrain from zealous representation of their clients. We simply do not expect defense attorneys to believe that their clients' interests (or their own) are furthered by objections to analysts' reports whose conclusions counsel have no intention of challenging.</p>\n<p>[14]  We of course express no view as to whether the error was harmless. The Massachusetts Court of Appeals did not reach that question and we decline to address it in the first instance. Cf. <i>Coy v. Iowa,</i> 487 U.S. 1012, 1021-1022, 108 S.Ct. 2798, 101 L.Ed.2d 857 (1988). In connection with that determination, however, we disagree with the dissent's contention, <i>post,</i> at 2556, that \"only an analyst's testimony suffices to prove [the] fact\" that \"the substance is cocaine.\" Today's opinion, while insisting upon retention of the confrontation requirement, in no way alters the type of evidence (including circumstantial evidence) sufficient to sustain a conviction.</p>\n\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "<div>\n<center><b>129 S.Ct. 2527 (2009)</b></center>\n<center><h1>Luis E.

The question presented is whether those affidavits are \"testimonial,\" rendering the affiants \"witnesses\" subject to the defendant's right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In 2001, Boston police officers received a tip that a Kmart employee, Thomas Wright, was engaging in suspicious activity. The informant reported that Wright repeatedly received phone calls at work, after each of which he would be picked up in front of the store by a blue sedan, and would return to the store a short time later. The police set up surveillance in the Kmart parking lot and witnessed this precise sequence of events. When Wright got out of the car upon his return, one of the officers detained and searched him, finding four clear white plastic bags containing a substance resembling cocaine. The officer then signaled other officers on the scene to arrest the two men in the carone of whom was petitioner Luis Melendez-Diaz. The officers placed all three men in a police cruiser.</p>\n<p>During the short drive to the police station, the officers observed their passengers fidgeting and making furtive movements in the back of the car. After depositing the men at the station, they searched the police cruiser and found a plastic bag containing 19 smaller plastic bags hidden in the partition between the front and back seats. They submitted the seized evidence to a state laboratory required by law to conduct chemical analysis upon police request. Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 111, § 12 (West 2006).</p>\n<p>Melendez-Diaz was charged with distributing cocaine and with trafficking in cocaine in an amount between 14 and 28 grams. Ch. 94C, §§ 32A, 32E(b)(1). At trial, the prosecution placed into evidence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2531</span> the bags seized from Wright and from the police cruiser. It also submitted three \"certificates of analysis\" showing the results of the forensic analysis performed on the seized substances. The certificates reported the weight of the seized bags and stated that the bags \"[h]a[ve] been examined with the following results: The substance was found to contain: Cocaine.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a, 26a, 28a. The certificates were sworn to before a notary public by analysts at the State Laboratory Institute of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, as required under Massachusetts law. Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 111, § 13.</p>\n<p>Petitioner objected to the admission of the certificates, asserting that our Confrontation Clause decision in <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), required the analysts to testify in person. The objection was overruled, and the certificates were admitted pursuant to state law as \"prima facie evidence of the composition, quality, and the net weight of the narcotic ... analyzed.\" Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 111, § 13.</p>\n<p>The jury found Melendez-Diaz guilty. He appealed, contending, among other things, that admission of the certificates violated his Sixth Amendment right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.

A witness's testimony against a defendant is thus inadmissible unless the witness appears at trial or, if the witness is unavailable, the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. <i>Id.,</i> at 54, 124 S.Ct. 1354.</p>\n<p>Our opinion described the class of testimonial statements covered by the Confrontation Clause as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Various formulations of this core class of testimonial statements exist: <i>ex parte</i> in-court testimony or its functional equivalentthat is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially; extrajudicial statements ... contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions; statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2532</span> There is little doubt that the documents at issue in this case fall within the \"core class of testimonial statements\" thus described. Our description of that category mentions affidavits twice. See also <i>White v. Illinois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112678\"><a href=\"/opinion/112678/white-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></a></span>, 365, 112 S.Ct. 736, 116 L.Ed.2d 848 (1992) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\"[T]he Confrontation Clause is implicated by extrajudicial statements only insofar as they are contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions\"). The documents at issue here, while denominated by Massachusetts law \"certificates,\" are quite plainly affidavits: \"declaration[s] of facts written down and sworn to by the declarant before an officer authorized to administer oaths.\" Black's Law Dictionary 62 (8th ed.2004). They are incontrovertibly a \"`solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.'\" <i>Crawford, supra,</i> at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (quoting 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828)). The fact in question is that the substance found in the possession of Melendez-Diaz and his codefendants was, as the prosecution claimed, cocainethe precise testimony the analysts would be expected to provide if called at trial. The \"certificates\" are functionally identical to live, in-court testimony, doing \"precisely what a witness does on direct examination.\" <i>Davis v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145641\"><a href=\"/opinion/145641/davis-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">813</span></a></span>, 830, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006) (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p>Here, moreover, not only were the affidavits \"`made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial,'\" <i>Crawford, supra,</i> at 52, 124 S.Ct. 1354, but under Massachusetts law the <i>sole purpose</i> of the affidavits was to provide \"prima facie evidence of the composition, quality, and the net weight\" of the analyzed substance, Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 111, § 13. We can safely assume that the analysts were aware of the affidavits' evidentiary purpose, since that purposeas stated in the relevant state-law provisionwas reprinted on the affidavits themselves. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a, 27a, 29a.</p>\n<p>In short, under our decision in <i>Crawford</i> the analysts' affidavits were testimonial statements, and the analysts were \"witnesses\" for purposes of the Sixth Amendment. Absent a showing that the analysts were unavailable to testify at trial <i>and</i> that petitioner had a prior opportunity to cross-examine them, petitioner was entitled to \"`be confronted with'\" the analysts at trial. <i>Crawford, supra,</i> at 54, 124 S.Ct. 1354.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Respondent and the dissent advance a potpourri of analytic arguments in an effort <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2533</span> to avoid this rather straightforward application of our holding in <i>Crawford.</i> Before addressing them, however, we must assure the reader of the falsity of the dissent's opening alarum that we are \"sweep[ing] away an accepted rule governing the admission of scientific evidence\" that has been \"established for at least 90 years\" and \"extends across at least 35 States and six Federal Courts of Appeals.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2543 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).</p>\n<p>The vast majority of the state-court cases the dissent cites in support of this claim come not from the last 90 years, but from the last 30, and not surprisingly nearly all of them rely on our decision in <i>Ohio v. Roberts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110324\"><a href=\"/opinion/110324/ohio-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), or its since-rejected theory that unconfronted testimony was admissible as long as it bore indicia of reliability, <i>id.,</i> at 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531. See <i>post,</i> at 2559.<sup>[2]</sup> As for the six Federal Courts of Appeals cases cited by the dissent, five of them postdated and expressly relied on <i>Roberts.</i> See <i>post,</i> at 2554-2555. The sixth predated <i>Roberts</i> but relied entirely on the same erroneous theory. See <i>Kay v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"245163\"><a href=\"/opinion/245163/ernest-kay-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span>, 480-481 (C.A.4 1958) (rejecting confrontation clause challenge \"where there is reasonable necessity for [the evidence] and where ... the evidence has those qualities of reliability and trustworthiness\").</p>\n<p>A review of cases that predate the <i>Roberts</i> era yields a mixed picture. As the dissent notes, three state supreme court decisions from the early 20th century denied confrontation with respect to certificates of analysis regarding a substance's alcohol content. See <i>post,</i> at 2554 (citing cases from Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Virginia). But other state courts in the same era reached the opposite conclusion. See <i>Torres v. State,</i> 113 Tex.Crim. 1, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></span>, 180 (App.1929); <i>Volrich v. State,</i> No. 278, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1925</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2473</span></span> (Ohio App., Nov. 2, 1925). At least this much is entirely clear: In faithfully applying <i>Crawford</i> to the facts of this case, we are not overruling 90 years of settled jurisprudence. It is the dissent that seeks to overturn precedent by resurrecting <i>Roberts</i> a mere five years after it was rejected in <i>Crawford.</i></p>\n<p>We turn now to the various legal arguments raised by respondent and the dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Respondent first argues that the analysts are not subject to confrontation because they are not \"accusatory\" witnesses, in that they do not directly accuse petitioner of wrongdoing; rather, their testimony is inculpatory only when taken together with other evidence linking petitioner to the contraband. See Brief for Respondent 10. This finds no support in the text of the Sixth Amendment or in our case law.</p>\n<p>The Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right \"to be confronted with the witnesses <i>against him.</i>\" (Emphasis added.) To the extent the analysts were witnesses (a question resolved above), they certainly provided testimony <i>against</i> petitioner, proving one fact necessary for his convictionthat the substance he possessed was cocaine. The contrast between the text of the Confrontation Clause and the text of the adjacent Compulsory Process <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2534</span> Clause confirms this analysis. While the Confrontation Clause guarantees a defendant the right to be confronted with the witnesses \"against him,\" the Compulsory Process Clause guarantees a defendant the right to call witnesses \"in his favor.\" U.S. Const., Amdt. 6. The text of the Amendment contemplates two classes of witnessesthose against the defendant and those in his favor. The prosecution <i>must</i> produce the former;<sup>[3]</sup> the defendant <i>may</i> call the latter. Contrary to respondent's assertion, there is not a third category of witnesses, helpful to the prosecution, but somehow immune from confrontation.</p>\n<p>It is often, indeed perhaps usually, the case that an adverse witness's testimony, taken alone, will not suffice to convict. Yet respondent fails to cite a single case in which such testimony was admitted absent a defendant's opportunity to cross-examine.<sup>[4]</sup> Unsurprisingly, since such a holding would be contrary to longstanding case law. In <i>Kirby v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"95045\"><a href=\"/opinion/95045/kirby-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 19 S.Ct. 574, 43 L.Ed. 890 (1899), the Court considered Kirby's conviction for receiving stolen property, the evidence for which consisted, in part, of the records of conviction of three individuals who were found guilty of stealing the relevant property. <i>Id.,</i> at 53, 19 S.Ct. 574. Though this evidence proved only that the property was stolen, and not that Kirby received it, the Court nevertheless ruled that admission of the records violated Kirby's rights under the Confrontation Clause. <i>Id.,</i> at 55, 19 S.Ct. 574. See also <i>King v. Turner,</i> 1 Mood. 347, 168 Eng. Rep. 1298 (1832) (confession by one defendant to having stolen certain goods could not be used as evidence against another defendant accused of receiving the stolen property).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Respondent and the dissent argue that the analysts should not be subject to confrontation because they are not \"conventional\" (or \"typical\" or \"ordinary\") witnesses of the sort whose <i>ex parte</i> testimony was most notoriously used at the trial of Sir Walter Raleigh. <i>Post,</i> at 2550-2551; Brief for Respondent 28. It is true, as the Court recognized in <i>Crawford,</i> that <i>ex parte</i> examinations of the sort used at Raleigh's trial have \"long been thought a paradigmatic confrontation violation.\" 541 U.S., at 52, 124 S.Ct. 1354. But the paradigmatic case identifies the core of the right to confrontation, not its limits. The right to confrontation was not invented in response to the use of the <i>ex parte</i> examinations in <i>Raleigh's Case,</i> 2 How. St. Tr. 1 (1603). That use provoked such an outcry precisely because it flouted the deeply rooted common-law tradition \"of live testimony in court subject to adversarial testing.\" <i>Crawford, supra,</i> at 43, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (citing 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 373-374 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2535</span> (1768)). See also <i>Crawford, supra,</i> at 43-47, 124 S.Ct. 1354.</p>\n<p>In any case, the purported distinctions respondent and the dissent identify between this case and Sir Walter Raleigh's \"conventional\" accusers do not survive scrutiny. The dissent first contends that a \"conventional witness recalls events observed in the past, while an analyst's report contains near-contemporaneous observations of the test.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2551-2552. It is doubtful that the analyst's reports in this case could be characterized as reporting \"near-contemporaneous observations\"; the affidavits were completed almost a week after the tests were performed. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a-29a (the tests were performed on November 28, 2001, and the affidavits sworn on December 4, 2001). But regardless, the dissent misunderstands the role that \"near-contemporaneity\" has played in our case law. The dissent notes that that factor was given \"substantial weight\" in <i>Davis, post,</i> at 2551, but in fact that decision <i>disproves</i> the dissent's position. There the Court considered the admissibility of statements made to police officers responding to a report of a domestic disturbance. By the time officers arrived the assault had ended, but the victim's statementswritten and oralwere sufficiently close in time to the alleged assault that the trial court admitted her affidavit as a \"present sense impression.\" <i>Davis,</i> 547 U.S., at 820, 126 S.Ct. 2266 (internal quotation marks omitted). Though the witness's statements in <i>Davis</i> were \"near-contemporaneous\" to the events she reported, we nevertheless held that they could <i>not</i> be admitted absent an opportunity to confront the witness. <i>Id.,</i> at 830, 126 S.Ct. 2266.</p>\n<p>A second reason the dissent contends that the analysts are not \"conventional witnesses\" (and thus not subject to confrontation) is that they \"observe[d] neither the crime nor any human action related to it.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2552. The dissent provides no authority for this particular limitation of the type of witnesses subject to confrontation. Nor is it conceivable that all witnesses who fit this description would be outside the scope of the Confrontation Clause. For example, is a police officer's investigative report describing the crime scene admissible absent an opportunity to examine the officer? The dissent's novel exception from coverage of the Confrontation Clause would exempt all expert witnessesa hardly \"unconventional\" class of witnesses.</p>\n<p>A third respect in which the dissent asserts that the analysts are not \"conventional\" witnesses and thus not subject to confrontation is that their statements were not provided in response to interrogation. <i>Ibid.</i> See also Brief for Respondent 29. As we have explained, \"[t]he Framers were no more willing to exempt from cross-examination volunteered testimony or answers to open-ended questions than they were to exempt answers to detailed interrogation.\" <i>Davis, supra,</i> at 822-823, n. 1, 126 S.Ct. 2266. Respondent and the dissent cite no authority, and we are aware of none, holding that a person who volunteers his testimony is any less a \"`witness against' the defendant,\" Brief for Respondent 26, than one who is responding to interrogation. In any event, the analysts' affidavits in this case <i>were</i> presented in response to a police request. See Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 111, §§ 12-13. If an affidavit submitted in response to a police officer's request to \"write down what happened\" suffices to trigger the Sixth Amendment's protection (as it apparently does, see <i>Davis,</i> 547 U.S., at 819-820, 126 S.Ct. 2266; <i>id.,</i> at 840, n. 5, 126 S.Ct. 2266 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part)), then the analysts' testimony should be subject to confrontation as well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2536</span> C</h2>\n<p>Respondent claims that there is a difference, for Confrontation Clause purposes, between testimony recounting historical events, which is \"prone to distortion or manipulation,\" and the testimony at issue here, which is the \"resul[t] of neutral, scientific testing.\" Brief for Respondent 29. Relatedly, respondent and the dissent argue that confrontation of forensic analysts would be of little value because \"one would not reasonably expect a laboratory professional ... to feel quite differently about the results of his scientific test by having to look at the defendant.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 31 (internal quotation marks omitted); see <i>post,</i> at 2548-2549.</p>\n<p>This argument is little more than an invitation to return to our overruled decision in <i>Roberts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110324\"><a href=\"/opinion/110324/ohio-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597, which held that evidence with \"particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\" was admissible notwithstanding the Confrontation Clause. <i>Id.,</i> at 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531. What we said in <i>Crawford</i> in response to that argument remains true:</p>\n<blockquote>\"To be sure, the Clause's ultimate goal is to ensure reliability of evidence, but it is a procedural rather than a substantive guarantee. It commands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination. ... Dispensing with confrontation because testimony is obviously reliable is akin to dispensing with jury trial because a defendant is obviously guilty. This is not what the Sixth Amendment prescribes.\" 541 U.S., at 61-62, 124 S.Ct. 1354.</blockquote>\n<p>Respondent and the dissent may be right that there are other waysand in some cases better waysto challenge or verify the results of a forensic test.<sup>[5]</sup> But the Constitution guarantees one way: confrontation. We do not have license to suspend the Confrontation Clause when a preferable trial strategy is available.</p>\n<p>Nor is it evident that what respondent calls \"neutral scientific testing\" is as neutral or as reliable as respondent suggests. Forensic evidence is not uniquely immune from the risk of manipulation. According to a recent study conducted under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences, \"[t]he majority of [laboratories producing forensic evidence] are administered by law enforcement agencies, such as police departments, where the laboratory administrator reports to the head of the agency.\" National Research Council of the National Academies, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward 6-1 (Prepublication Copy Feb. 2009) (hereinafter National Academy Report). And \"[b]ecause forensic scientists often are driven in their work by a need to answer a particular question related to the issues of a particular case, they sometimes face pressure to sacrifice appropriate methodology for the sake of expediency.\" <i>Id.,</i> at S-17. A forensic analyst responding to a request from a law enforcement official may feel pressureor have an incentiveto alter the evidence in a manner favorable to the prosecution.</p>\n<p>Confrontation is one means of assuring accurate forensic analysis. While it is true, as the dissent notes, that an honest analyst will not alter his testimony when forced to confront the defendant, <i>post,</i> at 2548, the same cannot be said of the fraudulent analyst. See Brief for National Innocence Network as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 15-17 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2537</span> (discussing cases of documented \"drylabbing\" where forensic analysts report results of tests that were never performed); National Academy Report 1-8 to 1-10 (discussing documented cases of fraud and error involving the use of forensic evidence). Like the eyewitness who has fabricated his account to the police, the analyst who provides false results may, under oath in open court, reconsider his false testimony. See <i>Coy v. Iowa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112146\"><a href=\"/opinion/112146/coy-v-iowa/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1012</span></a></span>, 1019, 108 S.Ct. 2798, 101 L.Ed.2d 857 (1988). And, of course, the prospect of confrontation will deter fraudulent analysis in the first place.</p>\n<p>Confrontation is designed to weed out not only the fraudulent analyst, but the incompetent one as well. Serious deficiencies have been found in the forensic evidence used in criminal trials. One commentator asserts that \"[t]he legal community now concedes, with varying degrees of urgency, that our system produces erroneous convictions based on discredited forensics.\" Metzger, Cheating the Constitution, 59 Vand. L.Rev. 475, 491 (2006). One study of cases in which exonerating evidence resulted in the overturning of criminal convictions concluded that invalid forensic testimony contributed to the convictions in 60% of the cases. Garrett &amp; Neufeld, Invalid Forensic Science Testimony and Wrongful Convictions, 95 Va. L.Rev. 1, 14 (2009). And the National Academy Report concluded:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<i>\"The forensic science system, encompassing both research and practice, has serious problems that can only be addressed by a national commitment to overhaul the current structure that supports the forensic science community in this country.\"</i> National Academy Report P-1 (emphasis in original).<sup>[6]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Like expert witnesses generally, an analyst's lack of proper training or deficiency in judgment may be disclosed in cross-examination.</p>\n<p>This case is illustrative. The affidavits submitted by the analysts contained only the bare-bones statement that \"[t]he substance was found to contain: Cocaine.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a, 26a, 28a. At the time of trial, petitioner did not know what tests the analysts performed, whether those tests were routine, and whether interpreting their results required the exercise of judgment or the use of skills that the analysts may not have possessed. While we still do not know the precise tests used by the analysts, we are told that the laboratories use \"methodology recommended by the Scientific Working Group for the Analysis of Seized Drugs,\" App. to Brief for Petitioner 1a-2a. At least some of that methodology requires the exercise of judgment and presents a risk of error that might be explored on cross-examination. See 2 P. Giannelli &amp; E. Imwinkelried, Scientific Evidence § 23.03[c], pp. 532-533, ch. 23A, p. 607 (4th ed.2007) (identifying four \"critical errors\" that analysts may commit in interpreting the results of the commonly used gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis); Shellow, The Application of <i>Daubert</i> to the Identification of Drugs, 2 Shepard's Expert &amp; Scientific Evidence Quarterly 593, 600 (1995) (noting that while spectrometers <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2538</span> may be equipped with computerized matching systems, \"forensic analysts in crime laboratories typically do not utilize this feature of the instrument, but rely exclusively on their subjective judgment\").</p>\n<p>The same is true of many of the other types of forensic evidence commonly used in criminal prosecutions. \"[T]here is wide variability across forensic science disciplines with regard to techniques, methodologies, reliability, types and numbers of potential errors, research, general acceptability, and published material.\" National Academy Report S-5. See also <i>id.,</i> at 5-9, 5-12, 5-17, 5-21 (discussing problems of subjectivity, bias, and unreliability of common forensic tests such as latent fingerprint analysis, pattern/impression analysis, and toolmark and firearms analysis). Contrary to respondent's and the dissent's suggestion, there is little reason to believe that confrontation will be useless in testing analysts' honesty, proficiency, and methodologythe features that are commonly the focus in the cross-examination of experts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>Respondent argues that the analysts' affidavits are admissible without confrontation because they are \"akin to the types of official and business records admissible at common law.\" Brief for Respondent 35. But the affidavits do not qualify as traditional official or business records, and even if they did, their authors would be subject to confrontation nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Documents kept in the regular course of business may ordinarily be admitted at trial despite their hearsay status. See Fed. Rule Evid. 803(6). But that is not the case if the regularly conducted business activity is the production of evidence for use at trial. Our decision in <i>Palmer v. Hoffman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103772\"><a href=\"/opinion/103772/palmer-v-hoffman/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></a></span>, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943), made that distinction clear. There we held that an accident report provided by an employee of a railroad company did not qualify as a business record because, although kept in the regular course of the railroad's operations, it was \"calculated for use essentially in the court, not in the business.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 114, 63 S.Ct. 477.<sup>[7]</sup> The analysts' certificateslike police reports generated by law enforcement officialsdo not qualify as business or public records for precisely the same reason. See Rule 803(8) (defining public records as \"excluding, however, in criminal cases matters observed by police officers and other law enforcement personnel\").</p>\n<p>Respondent seeks to rebut this limitation by noting that at common law the results of a coroner's inquest were admissible without an opportunity for confrontation. But as we have previously noted, whatever the status of coroner's reports at common law in England, they were not accorded any special status in American practice. See <i>Crawford,</i> 541 U.S., at 47, n. 2, 124 S.Ct. 1354; <i>Giles v. California,</i> 554 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 2678, 2705-06, 171 L.Ed.2d 488 (2008) (BREYER, J., dissenting); EvidenceOfficial RecordsCoroner's Inquest, 65 U. Pa. L.Rev. 290 (1917).</p>\n<p>The dissent identifies a single class of evidence which, though prepared for use at trial, was traditionally admissible: a clerk's certificate authenticating an official recordor a copy thereoffor use as evidence. See <i>post,</i> at 2552-2553. But a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2539</span> clerk's authority in that regard was narrowly circumscribed. He was permitted \"to certify to the correctness of a copy of a record kept in his office,\" but had \"no authority to furnish, as evidence for the trial of a lawsuit, his interpretation of what the record contains or shows, or to certify to its substance or effect.\" <i>State v. Wilson,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">La.</span> <span class=\"page\">404</span></span>, 409, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So.</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></span>, 97 (1917). See also <i>State v. Champion,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">987</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">700</span></span>, 700-701 (1895); 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 1678 (3d ed.1940). The dissent suggests that the fact that this exception was \"`narrowly circumscribed'\" makes no difference. See <i>post,</i> at 2553. To the contrary, it makes all the difference in the world. It shows that even the line of cases establishing the one narrow exception the dissent has been able to identify simultaneously vindicates the general rule applicable to the present case. A clerk could by affidavit <i>authenticate</i> or provide a copy of an otherwise admissible record, but could not do what the analysts did here: <i>create</i> a record for the sole purpose of providing evidence against a defendant.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Far more probative here are those cases in which the prosecution sought to admit into evidence a clerk's certificate attesting to the fact that the clerk had searched for a particular relevant record and failed to find it. Like the testimony of the analysts in this case, the clerk's statement would serve as substantive evidence against the defendant whose guilt depended on the nonexistence of the record for which the clerk searched. Although the clerk's certificate would qualify as an official record under respondent's definitionit was prepared by a public officer in the regular course of his official dutiesand although the clerk was certainly not a \"conventional witness\" under the dissent's approach, the clerk was nonetheless subject to confrontation. See <i>People v. Bromwich,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></span>, 388-389, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">933</span></span>, 934 (1911); <i>People v.

As we stated in <i>Crawford:</i> \"Most of the hearsay exceptions covered statements that by their nature were not testimonialfor example, business records or statements in furtherance of a conspiracy.\" 541 U.S., at 56, 124 S.Ct. 1354. Business and public records are generally admissible absent confrontation not because they qualify under an exception to the hearsay rules, but becausehaving been created for the administration of an entity's affairs and not for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2540</span> the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at trialthey are not testimonial. Whether or not they qualify as business or official records, the analysts' statements hereprepared specifically for use at petitioner's trialwere testimony against petitioner, and the analysts were subject to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E</h2>\n<p>Respondent asserts that we should find no Confrontation Clause violation in this case because petitioner had the ability to subpoena the analysts. But that powerwhether pursuant to state law or the Compulsory Process Clauseis no substitute for the right of confrontation. Unlike the Confrontation Clause, those provisions are of no use to the defendant when the witness is unavailable or simply refuses to appear. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Davis,</i> 547 U.S., at 820, 126 S.Ct. 2266 (\"[The witness] was subpoenaed, but she did not appear at ... trial\"). Converting the prosecution's duty under the Confrontation Clause into the defendant's privilege under state law or the Compulsory Process Clause shifts the consequences of adverse-witness no-shows from the State to the accused. More fundamentally, the Confrontation Clause imposes a burden on the prosecution to present its witnesses, not on the defendant to bring those adverse witnesses into court. Its value to the defendant is not replaced by a system in which the prosecution presents its evidence via <i>ex parte</i> affidavits and waits for the defendant to subpoena the affiants if he chooses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F</h2>\n<p>Finally, respondent asks us to relax the requirements of the Confrontation Clause to accommodate the \"`necessities of trial and the adversary process.'\" Brief for Respondent 59. It is not clear whence we would derive the authority to do so. The Confrontation Clause may make the prosecution of criminals more burdensome, but that is equally true of the right to trial by jury and the privilege against self-incrimination. The Confrontation Clauselike those other constitutional provisionsis binding, and we may not disregard it at our convenience.</p>\n<p>We also doubt the accuracy of respondent's and the dissent's dire predictions. The dissent, respondent, and its <i>amici</i> highlight the substantial total number of controlled-substance analyses performed by state and federal laboratories in recent years. But only some of those tests are implicated in prosecutions, and only a small fraction of those cases actually proceed to trial. See Brief for Law Professors as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 7-8 (nearly 95% of convictions in state and federal courts are obtained via guilty plea).<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>Perhaps the best indication that the sky will not fall after today's decision is that it has not done so already. Many States have already adopted the constitutional rule we announce today,<sup>[11]</sup> while many others <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2541</span> permit the defendant to assert (or forfeit by silence) his Confrontation Clause right after receiving notice of the prosecution's intent to use a forensic analyst's report, <i>id.,</i> at 13-15 (cataloging such state laws). Despite these widespread practices, there is no evidence that the criminal justice system has ground to a halt in the States that, one way or another, empower a defendant to insist upon the analyst's appearance at trial. Indeed, in Massachusetts itself, a defendant may subpoena the analyst to appear at trial, see Brief for Respondent 57, and yet there is no indication that obstructionist defendants are abusing the privilege.</p>\n<p>The dissent finds this evidence \"far less reassuring than promised.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2557. But its doubts rest on two flawed premises. First, the dissent believes that those state statutes \"requiring the defendant to give early notice of his intent to confront the analyst,\" are \"burden-shifting statutes [that] may be invalidated by the Court's reasoning.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2554, 2557-2558. That is not so. In their simplest form, notice-and-demand statutes require the prosecution to provide notice to the defendant of its intent to use an analyst's report as evidence at trial, after which the defendant is given a period of time in which he may object to the admission of the evidence absent the analyst's appearance live at trial. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Ga.Code Ann. § 35-3-154.1 (2006); Tex.Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 38.41, § 4 (Vernon 2005); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 2925.51(C) (West 2006). Contrary to the dissent's perception, these statutes shift no burden whatever. The defendant <i>always</i> has the burden of raising his Confrontation Clause objection; notice-and-demand statutes simply govern the <i>time</i> within which he must do so. States are free to adopt procedural rules governing objections. See <i>Wainwright v. Sykes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109717\"><a href=\"/opinion/109717/wainwright-v-sykes/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span>, 86-87, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977). It is common to require a defendant to exercise his rights under the Compulsory Process Clause in advance of trial, announcing his intent to present certain witnesses. See Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 12.1(a), (e), 16(b)(1)(C); Comment: Alibi Notice Rules: The Preclusion Sanction as Procedural Default, 51 U. Chi. L.Rev. 254, 254-255, 281-285 (1984) (discussing and cataloguing State notice-of-alibi rules); <i>Taylor v. Illinois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111986\"><a href=\"/opinion/111986/taylor-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span>, 411, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988); <i>Williams v.

There is no conceivable reason why he cannot similarly be compelled to exercise his Confrontation Clause rights before trial. See <i>Hinojos-Mendoza v. People,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2625273\"><a href=\"/opinion/2625273/hinojos-mendoza-v-people/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span>, 670 (Colo.2007) (discussing and approving Colorado's notice-and-demand provision). Today's decision will not disrupt criminal prosecutions in the many large States whose practice is already in accord with the Confrontation Clause.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2542</span> Second, the dissent notes that several of the state-court cases that have already adopted this rule did so pursuant to our decision in <i>Crawford,</i> and not \"independently... as a matter of state law.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2558. That may be so. But in assessing the likely practical effects of today's ruling, it is irrelevant <i>why</i> those courts adopted this rule; it matters only <i>that</i> they did so. It is true that many of these decisions are recent, but if the dissent's dire predictions were accurate, and given the large number of drug prosecutions at the state level, one would have expected immediate and dramatic results. The absence of such evidence is telling.</p>\n<p>But it is not surprising. Defense attorneys and their clients will often stipulate to the nature of the substance in the ordinary drug case. It is unlikely that defense counsel will insist on live testimony whose effect will be merely to highlight rather than cast doubt upon the forensic analysis. Nor will defense attorneys want to antagonize the judge or jury by wasting their time with the appearance of a witness whose testimony defense counsel does not intend to rebut in any fashion.<sup>[13]</sup> The <i>amicus</i> brief filed by District Attorneys in Support of the Commonwealth in the Massachusetts Supreme Court case upon which the Appeals Court here relied said that \"it is almost always the case that [analysts' certificates] are admitted without objection. Generally, defendants do not object to the admission of drug certificates most likely because there is no benefit to a defendant from such testimony.\" Brief for District Attorneys in Support of the Commonwealth in No. SJC-09320 (Mass.), p. 7 (footnote omitted). Given these strategic considerations, and in light of the experience in those States that already provide the same or similar protections to defendants, there is little reason to believe that our decision today will commence the parade of horribles respondent and the dissent predict.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>This case involves little more than the application of our holding in <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. The Sixth Amendment does not permit the prosecution to prove its case via <i>ex parte</i> out-of-court affidavits, and the admission of such evidence against Melendez-Diaz was error.<sup>[14]</sup> We therefore reverse the judgment of the Appeals Court of Massachusetts and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2543</span> Justice THOMAS, concurring.</p>\n<p>I write separately to note that I continue to adhere to my position that \"the Confrontation Clause is implicated by extrajudicial statements only insofar as they are contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions.\" <i>White v.

I join the Court's opinion in this case because the documents at issue in this case \"are quite plainly affidavits,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2532. As such, they \"fall within the core class of testimonial statements\" governed by the Confrontation Clause. <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>Justice KENNEDY, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice BREYER, and Justice ALITO join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court sweeps away an accepted rule governing the admission of scientific evidence. Until today, scientific analysis could be introduced into evidence without testimony from the \"analyst\" who produced it. This rule has been established for at least 90 years. It extends across at least 35 States and six Federal Courts of Appeals. Yet the Court undoes it based on two recent opinions that say nothing about forensic analysts: <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), and <i>Davis v.

We learn now that we have misinterpreted the Confrontation Clause hardly an arcane or seldom-used provision of the Constitutionfor the first 218 years of its existence. The immediate systemic concern is that the Court makes no attempt to acknowledge the real differences between laboratory analysts who perform scientific tests and other, more conventional witnesses\"witnesses\" being the word the Framers used in the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p><i>Crawford</i> and <i>Davis</i> dealt with ordinary witnesseswomen who had seen, and in two cases been the victim of, the crime in question. Those cases stand for the proposition that formal statements made by a conventional witnessone who has personal knowledge of some aspect of the defendant's guiltmay not be admitted without the witness appearing at trial to meet the accused face to face. But <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Davis</i> do not sayindeed, could not have said, because the facts were not before the Courtthat anyone who makes a testimonial statement is a witness for purposes of the Confrontation Clause, even when that person has, in fact, witnessed nothing to give them personal knowledge of the defendant's guilt.</p>\n<p>Because <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Davis</i> concerned typical witnesses, the Court should have done the sensible thing and limited its holding to witnesses as so defined. Indeed, as Justice THOMAS warned in his opinion in <i>Davis,</i> the Court's approach has <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2544</span> become \"disconnected from history and unnecessary to prevent abuse.\" 547 U.S., at 838, 126 S.Ct. 2266. The Court's reliance on the word \"testimonial\" is of little help, of course, for that word does not appear in the text of the Clause.</p>\n<p>The Court dictates to the States, as a matter of constitutional law, an as-yet-undefined set of rules governing what kinds of evidence may be admitted without in-court testimony. Indeed, under today's opinion the States bear an even more onerous burden than they did before <i>Crawford.</i> Then, the States at least had the guidance of the hearsay rule and could rest assured that \"where the evidence f[ell] within a firmly rooted hearsay exception,\" the Confrontation Clause did not bar its admission. <i>Ohio v. Roberts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110324\"><a href=\"/opinion/110324/ohio-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980) (overruled by <i>Crawford</i>). Now, without guidance from any established body of law, the States can only guess what future rules this Court will distill from the sparse constitutional text. See, <i>e.g., Mendez, Crawford v. Washington</i>: A Critique, 57 Stan. L.Rev. 569, 586-593 (2004) (discussing unanswered questions regarding testimonial statements).</p>\n<p>The Court's opinion suggests this will be a body of formalistic and wooden rules, divorced from precedent, common sense, and the underlying purpose of the Clause. Its ruling has vast potential to disrupt criminal procedures that already give ample protections against the misuse of scientific evidence. For these reasons, as more fully explained below, the Court's opinion elicits my respectful dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>The Court says that, before the results of a scientific test may be introduced into evidence, the defendant has the right to confront the \"analyst.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2531-2532. One must assume that this term, though it appears nowhere in the Confrontation Clause, nevertheless has some constitutional substance that now must be elaborated in future cases. There is no accepted definition of analyst, and there is no established precedent to define that term.</p>\n<p>Consider how many people play a role in a routine test for the presence of illegal drugs. One person prepares a sample of the drug, places it in a testing machine, and retrieves the machine's printoutoften, a graph showing the frequencies of radiation absorbed by the sample or the masses of the sample's molecular fragments. See 2 P. Giannelli &amp; E. Imwinkelried, Scientific Evidence § 23.03 (4th ed.2007) (describing common methods of identifying drugs, including infrared spectrophotometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, gas chromatography, and mass spectrometry). A second person interprets the graph the machine prints out perhaps by comparing that printout with published, standardized graphs of known drugs. <i>Ibid.</i> Meanwhile, a third person perhaps an independent contractorhas calibrated the machine and, having done so, has certified that the machine is in good working order. Finally, a fourth personperhaps the laboratory's director certifies that his subordinates followed established procedures.</p>\n<p>It is not at all evident which of these four persons is the analyst to be confronted under the rule the Court announces today. If all are witnesses who must appear for in-court confrontation, then the Court has, for all practical purposes, forbidden the use of scientific tests in criminal trials. As discussed further below, requiring even one of these individuals to testify threatens to disrupt if not end <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2545</span> many prosecutions where guilt is clear but a newly found formalism now holds sway. See Part I-C, <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p>It is possible to read the Court's opinion, however, to say that all four must testify. Each one has contributed to the test's result and has, at least in some respects, made a representation about the test. Person One represents that a pure sample, properly drawn, entered the machine and produced a particular printout. Person Two represents that the printout corresponds to a known drug. Person Three represents that the machine was properly calibrated at the time. Person Four represents that all the others performed their jobs in accord with established procedures.</p>\n<p>And each of the four has power to introduce error. A laboratory technician might adulterate the sample. The independent contractor might botch the machine's calibration. And so forth. The reasons for these errors may range from animus against the particular suspect or all criminal suspects to unintentional oversight; from gross negligence to good-faith mistake. It is no surprise that a plausible case can be made for deeming each person in the testing process an analyst under the Court's opinion.</p>\n<p>Consider the independent contractor who has calibrated the testing machine. At least in a routine case, where the machine's result appears unmistakable, that result's accuracy depends entirely on the machine's calibration. The calibration, in turn, can be proved only by the contractor's certification that he or she did the job properly. That certification appears to be a testimonial statement under the Court's definition: It is a formal, out-of-court statement, offered for the truth of the matter asserted, and made for the purpose of later prosecution. See <i>ante,</i> at 2531-2532. It is not clear, under the Court's ruling, why the independent contractor is not also an analyst.</p>\n<p>Consider the person who interprets the machine's printout. His or her interpretation may call for the exercise of professional judgment in close cases. See Giannelli &amp; Imwinkelried, <i>supra.</i> If we assume no person deliberately introduces error, this interpretive step is the one most likely to permit human error to affect the test's result. This exercise of judgment might make this participant an analyst. The Court implies as much. See <i>ante,</i> at 2536-2537.</p>\n<p>And we must yet consider the laboratory director who certifies the ultimate results. The director is arguably the most effective person to confront for revealing any ambiguity in findings, variations in procedures, or problems in the office, as he or she is most familiar with the standard procedures, the office's variations, and problems in prior cases or with particular analysts. The prosecution may seek to introduce his or her certification into evidence. The Court implies that only those statements that are actually entered into evidence require confrontation. See <i>ante,</i> at 2531-2532. This could mean that the director is also an analyst, even if his or her certification relies upon or restates work performed by subordinates.</p>\n<p>The Court offers no principles or historical precedent to determine which of these persons is the analyst. All contribute to the test result. And each is equally remote from the scene, has no personal stake in the outcome, does not even know the accused, and is concerned only with the performance of his or her role in conducting the test.</p>\n<p>It could be argued that the only analyst who must testify is the person who signed the certificate. Under this view, a laboratory could have one employee sign certificates and appear in court, which would <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2546</span> spare all the other analysts this burden. But the Court has already rejected this arrangement. The Court made clear in <i>Davis</i> that it will not permit the testimonial statement of one witness to enter into evidence through the in-court testimony of a second:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[W]e do not think it conceivable that the protections of the Confrontation Clause can readily be evaded by having a note-taking policeman [here, the laboratory employee who signs the certificate] <i>recite</i> the unsworn hearsay testimony of the declarant [here, the analyst who performs the actual test], instead of having the declarant sign a deposition. Indeed, if there is one point for which no caseEnglish or early American, state or federalcan be cited, that is it.\" 547 U.S., at 826, 126 S.Ct. 2266.</blockquote>\n<p>Under this logic, the Court's holding cannot be cabined to the person who signs the certificates. If the signatory is restating the testimonial statements of the true analysts whoever they might bethen those analysts, too, must testify in person.</p>\n<p>Today's decision demonstrates that even in the narrow category of scientific tests that identify a drug, the Court cannot define with any clarity who the analyst is. Outside this narrow category, the range of other scientific tests that may be affected by the Court's new confrontation right is staggering. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Comment, Toward a Definition of \"Testimonial\": How Autopsy Reports Do Not Embody the Qualities of a Testimonial Statement, 96 Cal. L.Rev. 1093, 1094, 1115 (2008) (noting that every court post-<i>Crawford</i> has held that autopsy reports are not testimonial, and warning that a contrary rule would \"effectively functio[n] as a statute of limitations for murder\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>It is difficult to confine at this point the damage the Court's holding will do in other contexts. Consider just twoestablishing the chain of custody and authenticating a copy of a document.</p>\n<p>It is the obligation of the prosecution to establish the chain of custody for evidence sent to testing laboratoriesthat is, to establish \"the identity and integrity of physical evidence by tracing its continuous whereabouts.\" 23 C.J. S., Criminal Law § 1142, p. 66 (2008). Meeting this obligation requires representationsthat one officer retrieved the evidence from the crime scene, that a second officer checked it into an evidence locker, that a third officer verified the locker's seal was intact, and so forth. The iron logic of which the Court is so enamored would seem to require in-court testimony from each human link in the chain of custody. That, of course, has never been the law. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Lott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510148\"><a href=\"/opinion/510148/united-states-v-charles-t-lott/\"><span class=\"volume\">854</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span>, 250 (C.A.7 1988) (\"[G]aps in the chain [of custody] normally go to the weight of the evidence rather than its admissibility\"); 29A Am.Jur.2d, Evidence § 962, p. 269 (2009) (\"The fact that one of the persons in control of a fungible substance does not testify at trial does not, without more, make the substance or testimony relating to it inadmissible\"); C.J.S., <i>supra,</i> § 1142, at 67 (\"It is generally not necessary that every witness who handled the evidence testify\").</p>\n<p>It is no answer for the Court to say that \"[i]t is up to the prosecution to decide what steps in the chain of custody are so crucial as to require evidence.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2532, n. 1. The case itself determines which links in the chain are crucialnot the prosecution. In any number of cases, the crucial link in the chain will not be available to testify and so the evidence will be excluded for lack of a proper foundation.</p>\n<p>Consider another context in which the Court's holding may cause disruption: The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2547</span> long-accepted practice of authenticating copies of documents by means of a certificate from the document's custodian stating that the copy is accurate. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Fed. Rule Evid. 902(4) (in order to be self-authenticating, a copy of a public record must be \"certified as correct by the custodian\"); Rule 902(11) (business record must be \"accompanied by a written declaration of its custodian\"). Under one possible reading of the Court's opinion, recordkeepers will be required to testify. So far, courts have not read <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Davis</i> to impose this largely meaningless requirement. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Adefehinti,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2628357\"><a href=\"/opinion/2628357/state-v-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 327-328 (C.A.D.C.2008) (certificates authenticating bank records may be admitted without confrontation); <i>United States v. Ellis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795462\"><a href=\"/opinion/795462/united-states-v-brian-k-ellis/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">920</span></a></span>, 927 (C.A.7 2006) (certificate authenticating hospital records). But the breadth of the Court's ruling today, and its undefined scope, may well be such that these courts now must be deemed to have erred. The risk of that consequence ought to tell us that something is very wrong with the Court's analysis.</p>\n<p>Because the Court is driven by nothing more than a wooden application of the <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Davis</i> definition of \"testimonial,\" divorced from any guidance from history, precedent, or common sense, there is no way to predict the future applications of today's holding. Surely part of the justification for the Court's formalism must lie in its predictability. There is nothing predictable here, however, other than the uncertainty and disruption that now must ensue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>With no precedent to guide us, let us assume that the Court's analyst is the person who interprets the machine's printout. This result makes no sense. The Confrontation Clause is not designed, and does not serve, to detect errors in scientific tests. That should instead be done by conducting a new test. Or, if a new test is impossible, the defendant may call his own expert to explain to the jury the test's flaws and the dangers of relying on it. And if, in an extraordinary case, the particular analyst's testimony is necessary to the defense, then, of course, the defendant may subpoena the analyst. The Court frets that the defendant may be unable to do so \"when the [analyst] is unavailable or simply refuses to appear.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2540. But laboratory analysts are not difficult to locate or to compel. As discussed below, analysts already devote considerable time to appearing in court when subpoenaed to do so. See Part I-C, <i>infra;</i> see also Brief for State of Alabama et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 26-28. Neither the Court, petitioner, nor <i>amici</i> offer any reason to believe that defendants have trouble subpoenaing analysts in cases where the analysts' in-court testimony is necessary.</p>\n<p>The facts of this case illustrate the formalistic and pointless nature of the Court's reading of the Clause. Petitioner knew, well in advance of trial, that the Commonwealth would introduce the tests against him. The bags of cocaine were in court, available for him to test, and entered into evidence. Yet petitioner made no effort, before or during trial, to mount a defense against the analysts' results. Petitioner could have challenged the tests' reliability by seeking discovery concerning the testing methods used or the qualifications of the laboratory analysts. See Mass. Rule Crim. Proc. 14(a)(2) (2009). He did not do so. Petitioner could have sought to conduct his own test. See Rule 41. Again, he did not seek a test; indeed, he did not argue that the drug was not cocaine. Rather than dispute the authenticity of the samples tested or the accuracy of the tests performed, petitioner argued to the jury <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2548</span> that the prosecution had not shown that he had possessed or dealt in the drugs.</p>\n<p>Despite not having prepared a defense to the analysts' results, petitioner's counsel made what can only be described as a <i>pro forma</i> objection to admitting the results without in-court testimony, presumably from one particular analyst. Today the Court, by deciding that this objection should have been sustained, transforms the Confrontation Clause from a sensible procedural protection into a distortion of the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p>It is difficult to perceive how the Court's holding will advance the purposes of the Confrontation Clause. One purpose of confrontation is to impress upon witnesses the gravity of their conduct. See <i>Coy v. Iowa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112146\"><a href=\"/opinion/112146/coy-v-iowa/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1012</span></a></span>, 1019-1020, 108 S.Ct. 2798, 101 L.Ed.2d 857 (1988). A witness, when brought to face the person his or her words condemn, might refine, reformulate, reconsider, or even recant earlier statements. See <i>ibid.</i> A further purpose is to alleviate the danger of one-sided interrogations by adversarial government officials who might distort a witness's testimony. The Clause guards against this danger by bringing the interrogation into the more neutral and public forum of the courtroom. See <i>Maryland v. Craig,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112489\"><a href=\"/opinion/112489/maryland-v-craig/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span>, 869-870, 110 S.Ct. 3157, 111 L.Ed.2d 666 (1990) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (discussing the \"value of the confrontation right in guarding against a child's distorted or coerced recollections\"); see also 96 Cal. L.Rev., <i>supra,</i> at 1120-1122 (\"During private law-enforcement questioning, police officers or prosecutors can exert pressure on the witness without a high risk of being discovered. Courtroom questioning, in contrast, is public and performed in front of the jury, judge and defendant. Pressure is therefore harder to exert in court\").</p>\n<p>But neither purpose is served by the rule the Court announces today. It is not plausible that a laboratory analyst will retract his or her prior conclusion upon catching sight of the defendant the result condemns. After all, the analyst is far removed from the particular defendant and, indeed, claims no personal knowledge of the defendant's guilt. And an analyst performs hundreds if not thousands of tests each year and will not remember a particular test or the link it had to the defendant.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that analysts are infallible. They are not. It may well be that if the State does not introduce the machine printout or the raw results of a laboratory analysis; if it does not call an expert to interpret a test, particularly if that test is complex or little known; if it does not establish the chain of custody and the reliability of the laboratory; then the State will have failed to meet its burden of proof. That result follows because the State must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, without relying on presumptions, unreliable hearsay, and the like. See <i>United States v. United States Gypsum Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109931\"><a href=\"/opinion/109931/united-states-v-united-states-gypsum-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">422</span></a></span>, 446, 98 S.Ct. 2864, 57 L.Ed.2d 854 (1978) (refusing to permit a \"`conclusive presumption [of intent],'\" which \"`would effectively eliminate intent as an ingredient of the offense'\" (quoting <i>Morissette v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104952\"><a href=\"/opinion/104952/morissette-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></a></span>, 274-275, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952)). The State must permit the defendant to challenge the analyst's result. See <i>Holmes v. South Carolina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145659\"><a href=\"/opinion/145659/holmes-v-south-carolina/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 331, 126 S.Ct. 1727, 164 L.Ed.2d 503 (2006) (affirming the defendant's right to \"have a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). The rules of evidence, including those governing reliability under hearsay principles and the latitude to be given expert witnesses; the rules against irrebutable presumptions; and the overriding principle that the prosecution must make <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2549</span> its case beyond a reasonable doubtall these are part of the protections for the accused. The States, however, have some latitude in determining how these rules should be defined.</p>\n<p>The Confrontation Clause addresses who must testify. It simply does not follow, however, that this clause, in lieu of the other rules set forth above, controls who the prosecution must call on every issue. Suppose, for instance, that the defense challenges the procedures for a secure chain of custody for evidence sent to a lab and then returned to the police. The defense has the right to call its own witnesses to show that the chain of custody is not secure. But that does not mean it can demand that, in the prosecution's case in chief, each person who is in the chain of custodyand who had an undoubted opportunity to taint or tamper with the evidencemust be called by the prosecution under the Confrontation Clause. And the same is true with lab technicians.</p>\n<p>The Confrontation Clause is simply not needed for these matters. Where, as here, the defendant does not even dispute the accuracy of the analyst's work, confrontation adds nothing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>For the sake of these negligible benefits, the Court threatens to disrupt forensic investigations across the country and to put prosecutions nationwide at risk of dismissal based on erratic, all-too-frequent instances when a particular laboratory technician, now invested by the Court's new constitutional designation as the analyst, simply does not or cannot appear.</p>\n<p>Consider first the costs today's decision imposes on criminal trials. Our own Court enjoys weeks, often months, of notice before cases are argued. We receive briefs well in advance. The argument itself is ordered. A busy trial court, by contrast, must consider not only attorneys' schedules but also those of witnesses and juries. Trial courts have huge caseloads to be processed within strict time limits. Some cases may unexpectedly plead out at the last minute; others, just as unexpectedly, may not. Some juries stay out longer than predicted; others must be reconstituted. An analyst cannot hope to be the trial court's top priority in scheduling. The analyst must instead face the prospect of waiting for days in a hallway outside the courtroom before being called to offer testimony that will consist of little more than a rote recital of the written report. See Part I-B, <i>supra.</i></p>\n<p>As matters stood before today's opinion, analysts already spent considerable time appearing as witnesses in those few cases where the defendant, unlike petitioner in this case, contested the analyst's result and subpoenaed the analyst. See Brief for Alabama et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 26-28 (testifying takes time); <i>ante,</i> at 2542 (before today's opinion, it was \"`almost always the case that analysts' certificates [we]re admitted without objection'\" in Massachusetts courts). By requiring analysts also to appear in the far greater number of cases where defendants do not dispute the analyst's result, the Court imposes enormous costs on the administration of justice.</p>\n<p>Setting aside, for a moment, all the other crimes for which scientific evidence is required, consider the costs the Court's ruling will impose on state drug prosecutions alone. In 2004, the most recent year for which data are available, drug possession and trafficking resulted in 362,850 felony convictions in state courts across the country. See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, M. Durose &amp; P. Langan, Felony Sentences in State Courts 2004, p. 2 (July 2007). Roughly 95% of those convictions were products of plea <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2550</span> bargains, see <i>id.,</i> at 1, which means that state courts saw more than 18,000 drug trials in a single year.</p>\n<p>The analysts responsible for testing the drugs at issue in those cases now bear a crushing burden. For example, the district attorney in Philadelphia prosecuted 25,000 drug crimes in 2007. Brief for National Dist. Attorneys Association et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 12-13. Assuming that number remains the same, and assuming that 95% of the cases end in a plea bargain, each of the city's 18 drug analysts, <i>ibid.,</i> will be required to testify in more than 69 trials next year. Cleveland's district attorney prosecuted 14,000 drug crimes in 2007. <i>Ibid.</i> Assuming that number holds, and that 95% of the cases end in a plea bargain, each of the city's 6 drug analysts (two of whom work only part time) must testify in 117 drug cases next year. <i>Id.,</i> at 13.</p>\n<p>The Federal Government may face even graver difficulties than the States because its operations are so widespread. For example, the FBI laboratory at Quantico, Virginia, supports federal, state, and local investigations across the country. Its 500 employees conduct over one million scientific tests each year. Dept. of Justice, FBI Laboratory 2007, Message from the FBI Laboratory Director, http://www.fbi.gov/ hq/lab/lab2007/labannual07.pdf (as visited June 22, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). The Court's decision means that before any of those million tests reaches a jury, at least one of the laboratory's analysts must board a plane, find his or her way to an unfamiliar courthouse, and sit there waiting to read aloud notes made months ago.</p>\n<p>The Court purchases its meddling with the Confrontation Clause at a dear price, a price not measured in taxpayer dollars alone. Guilty defendants will go free, on the most technical grounds, as a direct result of today's decision, adding nothing to the truth-finding process. The analyst will not always make it to the courthouse in time. He or she may be ill; may be out of the country; may be unable to travel because of inclement weather; or may at that very moment be waiting outside some other courtroom for another defendant to exercise the right the Court invents today. If for any reason the analyst cannot make it to the courthouse in time, then, the Court holds, the jury cannot learn of the analyst's findings (unless, by some unlikely turn of events, the defendant previously cross-examined the analyst). <i>Ante,</i> at 2531. The result, in many cases, will be that the prosecution cannot meet its burden of proof, and the guilty defendant goes free on a technicality that, because it results in an acquittal, cannot be reviewed on appeal.</p>\n<p>The Court's holding is a windfall to defendants, one that is unjustified by any demonstrated deficiency in trials, any well-understood historical requirement, or any established constitutional precedent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>All of the problems with today's decisionthe imprecise definition of \"analyst,\" the lack of any perceptible benefit, the heavy societal costswould be of no moment if the Constitution did, in fact, require the Court to rule as it does today. But the Constitution does not.</p>\n<p>The Court's fundamental mistake is to read the Confrontation Clause as referring to a kind of out-of-court statementnamely, a testimonial statementthat must be excluded from evidence. The Clause does not refer to kinds of statements. Nor does the Clause contain the word \"testimonial.\" The text, instead, refers to kinds of persons, namely, to \"witnesses against\" the defendant. Laboratory analysts are not \"witnesses against\" the defendant as those <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2551</span> words would have been understood at the framing. There is simply no authority for this proposition.</p>\n<p>Instead, the Clause refers to a conventional \"witness\"meaning one who witnesses (that is, perceives) an event that gives him or her personal knowledge of some aspect of the defendant's guilt. Both <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Davis</i> concerned just this kind of ordinary witnessand nothing in the Confrontation Clause's text, history, or precedent justifies the Court's decision to expand those cases.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Clause states: \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\" U.S. Const., Amdt. 6. Though there is \"virtually no evidence of what the drafters of the Confrontation Clause intended it to mean,\" <i>White v. Illinois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112678\"><a href=\"/opinion/112678/white-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></a></span>, 359, 112 S.Ct. 736, 116 L.Ed.2d 848 (1992) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), it is certain the Framers did not contemplate that an analyst who conducts a scientific test far removed from the crime would be considered a \"witnes[s] against\" the defendant.</p>\n<p>The Framers were concerned with a typical witnessone who perceived an event that gave rise to a personal belief in some aspect of the defendant's guilt. There is no evidence that the Framers understood the Clause to extend to unconventional witnesses. As discussed below, there is significant evidence to the contrary. See Part II-B, <i>infra.</i> In these circumstances, the historical evidence in support of the Court's position is \"`too meager ... to form a solid basis in history, preceding and contemporaneous with the framing of the Constitution.'\" <i>Boumediene v. Bush,</i> 553 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 2229, 2251, 171 L.Ed.2d 41 (2008) (quoting <i>Reid v. Covert,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105525\"><a href=\"/opinion/105525/reid-v-covert/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 64, 77 S.Ct. 1222, 1 L.Ed.2d 1148 (1957) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in result)). The Court goes dangerously wrong when it bases its constitutional interpretation upon historical guesswork.</p>\n<p>The infamous treason trial of Sir Walter Raleigh provides excellent examples of the kinds of witnesses to whom the Confrontation Clause refers. <i>Raleigh's Case,</i> 2 How. St. Tr. 1 (1603); see <i>Crawford,</i> 541 U.S., at 44-45, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (Raleigh's trial informs our understanding of the Clause because it was, at the time of the framing, one of the \"most notorious instances\" of the abuse of witnesses' out-of-court statements); <i>ante,</i> at 2534 (same). Raleigh's accusers claimed to have heard Raleigh speak treason, so they were witnesses in the conventional sense. We should limit the Confrontation Clause to witnesses like those in Raleigh's trial.</p>\n<p>The Court today expands the Clause to include laboratory analysts, but analysts differ from ordinary witnesses in at least three significant ways. First, a conventional witness recalls events observed in the past, while an analyst's report contains near-contemporaneous observations of the test. An observation recorded at the time it is made is unlike the usual act of testifying. A typical witness must recall a previous event that he or she perceived just once, and thus may have misperceived or misremembered. But an analyst making a contemporaneous observation need not rely on memory; he or she instead reports the observations at the time they are made. We gave this consideration substantial weight in <i>Davis.</i> There, the \"primary purpose\" of the victim's 911 call was \"to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency,\" rather than \"to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\" 547 U.S., at 822, 827, 126 S.Ct. 2266. See <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2552</span> also <i>People v. Geier,</i> 41 Cal.4th 555, 605-609, 61 Cal.Rptr.3d 580, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2599781\"><a href=\"/opinion/2599781/people-v-geier/\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 139-141 (2007). The Court cites no authority for its holding that an observation recorded at the time it is made is an act of \"witness[ing]\" for purposes of the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p>Second, an analyst observes neither the crime nor any human action related to it. Often, the analyst does not know the defendant's identity, much less have personal knowledge of an aspect of the defendant's guilt. The analyst's distance from the crime and the defendant, in both space and time, suggests the analyst is not a witness against the defendant in the conventional sense.</p>\n<p>Third, a conventional witness responds to questions under interrogation. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Raleigh's Case, supra,</i> at 15-20. But laboratory tests are conducted according to scientific protocols; they are not dependent upon or controlled by interrogation of any sort. Put differently, out-of-court statements should only \"require confrontation if they are produced by, or with the involvement of, adversarial government officials responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\" 96 Cal. L.Rev., at 1118. There is no indication that the analysts herewho work for the State Laboratory Institute, a division of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health were adversarial to petitioner. Nor is there any evidence that adversarial officials played a role in formulating the analysts' certificates.</p>\n<p>Rather than acknowledge that it expands the Confrontation Clause beyond conventional witnesses, the Court relies on our recent opinions in <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Davis. Ante,</i> at 2531-2532. The Court assumes, with little analysis, that <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Davis</i> extended the Clause to any person who makes a \"testimonial\" statement. But the Court's confident tone cannot disguise the thinness of these two reeds. Neither <i>Crawford</i> nor <i>Davis</i> considered whether the Clause extends to persons far removed from the crime who have no connection to the defendant. Instead, those cases concerned conventional witnesses. <i>Davis, supra,</i> at 826-830, 126 S.Ct. 2266 (witnesses were victims of defendants' assaults); <i>Crawford, supra,</i> at 38, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (witness saw defendant stab victim).</p>\n<p>It is true that <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Davis</i> employed the term \"testimonial,\" and thereby suggested that any testimonial statement, by any person, no matter how distant from the defendant and the crime, is subject to the Confrontation Clause. But that suggestion was not part of the holding of <i>Crawford</i> or <i>Davis.</i> Those opinions used the adjective \"testimonial\" to avoid the awkward phrasing required by reusing the noun \"witness.\" The Court today transforms that turn of phrase into a new and sweeping legal rule, by holding that anyone who makes a formal statement for the purpose of later prosecutionno matter how removed from the crimemust be considered a \"witness against\" the defendant. <i>Ante,</i> at 2531-2532. The Court cites no authority to justify this expansive new interpretation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>No historical evidence supports the Court's conclusion that the Confrontation Clause was understood to extend beyond conventional witnesses to include analysts who conduct scientific tests far removed from the crime and the defendant. Indeed, what little evidence there is contradicts this interpretation.</p>\n<p>Though the Framers had no forensic scientists, they did use another kind of unconventional witnessthe copyist. A copyist's work may be as essential to a criminal prosecution as the forensic analyst's. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2553</span> To convict a man of bigamy, for example, the State often requires his marriage records. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Williams v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ala.</span> <span class=\"page\">131</span></span>, 134, 135 (1875); <i>State v. Potter,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Vt.</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></span>, 38 (1879). But if the original records cannot be taken from the archive, the prosecution must rely on copies of those records, made for the purpose of introducing the copies into evidence at trial. See <i>ibid.</i> In that case, the copyist's honesty and diligence are just as important as the analyst's here. If the copyist falsifies a copy, or even misspells a name or transposes a date, those flaws could lead the jury to convict. Because so much depends on his or her honesty and diligence, the copyist often prepares an affidavit certifying that the copy is true and accurate.</p>\n<p>Such a certificate is beyond question a testimonial statement under the Court's definition: It is a formal out-of-court statement offered for the truth of two matters (the copyist's honesty and the copy's accuracy), and it is prepared for a criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p>During the Framers' era copyists' affidavits were accepted without hesitation by American courts. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Percheman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85813\"><a href=\"/opinion/85813/united-states-v-percheman/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 85, 8 L.Ed. 604 (1833) (opinion for the Court by Marshall, C. J.); see also Advisory Committee's Note on Fed. Rule Evid. 902(4), 28 U.S.C.App., p. 390 (\"The common law ... recognized the procedure of authenticating copies of public records by certificate\"); 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence §§ 1677, 1678 (J. Chadbourn rev.1974). And courts admitted copyists' affidavits in criminal as well as civil trials. See <i>Williams, supra</i><i>; </i><i>Potter, supra</i><i>.</i> This demonstrates that the framing generation, in contrast to the Court today, did not consider the Confrontation Clause to require in-court confrontation of unconventional authors of testimonial statements.</p>\n<p>The Court attempts to explain away this historical exception to its rule by noting that a copyist's authority is \"narrowly circumscribed.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2539. But the Court does not explain why that matters, nor, if it does matter, why laboratory analysts' authority should not also be deemed \"narrowly circumscribed\" so that they, too, may be excused from testifying. And drawing these fine distinctions cannot be squared with the Court's avowed allegiance to formalism. Determining whether a witness' authority is \"narrowly circumscribed\" has nothing to do with <i>Crawford</i>'s testimonial framework. It instead appears much closer to the pre-<i>Crawford</i> rule of <i>Ohio v. Roberts</i><i>,</i> under which a statement could be admitted without testimony if it \"bears adequate indicia of reliability.\" 448 U.S., at 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>In keeping with the traditional understanding of the Confrontation Clause, this Court in <i>Dowdell v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97427\"><a href=\"/opinion/97427/dowdell-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span>, 31 S.Ct. 590, 55 L.Ed. 753 (1911), rejected a challenge to the use of certificates, sworn out by a clerk of court, a trial judge, and a court reporter, stating that defendants had been present at trial. Those certificates, like a copyist's certificate, met every requirement of the Court's current definition of \"testimonial.\" In rejecting the defendants' claim that use of the certificates violated the Confrontation Clause, the Court in <i>Dowdell</i> explained that the officials who executed the certificates \"were not witnesses against the accused\" because they \"were not asked to testify to facts concerning [the defendants'] guilt or innocence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 330, 31 S.Ct. 590. Indeed, as recently as <i>Davis,</i> the Court reaffirmed <i>Dowdell.</i> 547 U.S., at 825, 126 S.Ct. 2266.</p>\n<p>By insisting that every author of a testimonial statement appear for confrontation, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2554</span> on pain of excluding the statement from evidence, the Court does violence to the Framers' sensible, and limited, conception of the right to confront \"witnesses against\" the defendant.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>In addition to lacking support in historical practice or in this Court's precedent, the Court's decision is also contrary to authority extending over at least 90 years, 35 States, and six Federal Courts of Appeals.</p>\n<p>Almost 100 years ago three state supreme courts held that their state constitutions did not require analysts to testify in court. In a case much like this one, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld the admission of a certificate stating that the liquid seized from the defendant contained alcohol, even though the author of the certificate did not testify. <i>Commonwealth v. Slavski,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></span>, 413, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></span>, 467 (1923).

Some 24 state courts, and the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, were in accord. See Appendix A, <i>infra.</i> (Some cases cited in the appendixes concern doctors, coroners, and calibrators rather than laboratory analysts, but their reasoning is much the same.) Eleven more state courts upheld burden-shifting statutes that reduce, if not eliminate, the right to confrontation by requiring the defendant to take affirmative steps prior to trial to summon the analyst. See <i>ibid.</i> Because these burden-shifting statutes may be invalidated by the Court's reasoning, these 11 decisions, too, appear contrary to today's opinion. See Part III-B, <i>infra.</i> Most of the remaining States, far from endorsing the Court's view, appear not to have addressed the question prior to <i>Crawford.</i> Against this weight of authority, the Court proffers just two cases from intermediate state courts of appeals. <i>Ante,</i> at 2533-2534.</p>\n<p>On a practical level, today's ruling would cause less disruption if the States' hearsay rules had already required analysts to testify. But few States require this. At least sixteen state courts have held that their evidentiary rules permit scientific test results, calibration certificates, and the observations of medical personnel to enter evidence without in-court testimony. See Appendix B, <i>infra.</i> The Federal Courts of Appeals have reached the same conclusion in applying the federal hearsay rule. <i>United States v. Garnett,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"72090\"><a href=\"/opinion/72090/usa-v-garnett/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1016</span></a></span>, 1018-1019 (C.A.11 1997) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>United States v.

See Appendix B, <i>infra</i> (citing cases from three States overruling or limiting previous precedents that had adopted the Court's rule as a matter of state law). It appears that a mere six courts continue to interpret their States' hearsay laws to require analysts to testify. See <i>ibid.</i> And, of course, where courts have grounded their decisions in state law, rather than the Constitution, the legislatures in those States have had, until now, the power to abrogate the courts' interpretation if the costs were shown to outweigh the benefits. Today the Court strips that authority from the States by carving the minority view into the constitutional text.</p>\n<p>State legislatures, and not the Members of this Court, have the authority to shape the rules of evidence. The Court therefore errs when it relies in such great measure on the recent report of the National Academy of Sciences. <i>Ante,</i> at 2536-2537 (discussing National Research Council of the National Academies, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward (Prepublication Copy Feb. 2009)). That report is not directed to this Court, but rather to the elected representatives in Congress and the state legislatures, who, unlike Members of this Court, have the power and competence to determine whether scientific tests are unreliable and, if so, whether testimony is the proper solution to the problem.</p>\n<p>The Court rejects the well-established understandingextending across at least 90 years, 35 States and six Federal Courts of Appealsthat the Constitution does not require analysts to testify in court before their analysis may be introduced into evidence. The only authority on which the Court can rely is its own speculation on the meaning of the word \"testimonial,\" made in two recent opinions that said nothing about scientific analysis or scientific analysts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>In an attempt to show that the \"sky will not fall after today's decision,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2540, the Court makes three arguments, none of which withstands scrutiny.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In an unconvincing effort to play down the threat that today's new rule will disrupt or even end criminal prosecutions, the Court professes a hope that defense counsel will decline to raise what will soon be known as the <i>Melendez-Diaz</i> objection. <i>Ante,</i> at 2542. The Court bases this expectation on its understanding that defense attorneys surrender constitutional rights because the attorneys do not \"want to antagonize the judge or jury by wasting their time.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Court's reasoning is troubling on at least two levels. First, the Court's speculation rests on the apparent belief that our Nation's trial judges and jurors are unwilling to accept zealous advocacy and that, once \"antagonize[d]\" by it, will punish such advocates with adverse rulings. <i>Ibid.</i> The Court offers no support for this stunning slur on the integrity of the Nation's courts. It is commonplace for the defense to request, at the conclusion of the prosecution's opening case, a directed verdict of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2556</span> acquittal. If the prosecution has failed to prove an element of the crimeeven an element that is technical and rather obvious, such as movement of a car in interstate commercethen the case must be dismissed. Until today one would not have thought that judges should be angered at the defense for making such motions, nor that counsel has some sort of obligation to avoid being troublesome when the prosecution has not done all the law requires to prove its case.</p>\n<p>Second, even if the Court were right to expect trial judges to feel \"antagonize[d]\" by <i>Melendez-Diaz</i> objections and to then vent their anger by punishing the lawyer in some way, there is no authority to support the Court's suggestion that a lawyer may shirk his or her professional duties just to avoid judicial displeasure. There is good reason why the Court cites no authority for this suggestionit is contrary to what some of us, at least, have long understood to be defense counsel's duty to be a zealous advocate for every client. This Court has recognized the bedrock principle that a competent criminal defense lawyer must put the prosecution to its proof:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[T]he adversarial process protected by the Sixth Amendment requires that the accused have `counsel acting in the role of an advocate.' <i>Anders v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107423\"><a href=\"/opinion/107423/anders-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span>, 743, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). The right to the effective assistance of counsel is thus the right of the accused to require the prosecution's case to survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing. When a true adversarial criminal trial has been conducted ... the kind of testing envisioned by the Sixth Amendment has occurred. But if the process loses its character as a confrontation between adversaries, the constitutional guarantee is violated.\" <i>United States v. Cronic,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111169\"><a href=\"/opinion/111169/united-states-v-cronic/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">648</span></a></span>, 656-657, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984) (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>See also ABA Model Code of Professional Responsibility, Canon 7-1, in ABA Compendium of Professional Responsibility Rules and Standards (2008) (\"The duty of a lawyer, both to his client and to the legal system, is to represent his client zealously within the bounds of the law ...\" (footnotes omitted)).</p>\n<p>The instant case demonstrates how zealous defense counsel will defend their clients. To convict, the prosecution must prove the substance is cocaine. Under the Court's new rule, apparently only an analyst's testimony suffices to prove that fact. (Of course there will also be a large universe of other crimes, ranging from homicide to robbery, where scientific evidence is necessary to prove an element.) In cases where scientific evidence is necessary to prove an element of the crime, the Court's rule requires the prosecution to call the person identified as the analyst; this requirement has become a new prosecutorial duty linked with proving the State's case beyond a reasonable doubt. Unless the Court is ashamed of its new rule, it is inexplicable that the Court seeks to limit its damage by hoping that defense counsel will be derelict in their duty to insist that the prosecution prove its case. That is simply not the way the adversarial system works.</p>\n<p>In any event, the Court's hope is sure to prove unfounded. The Court surmises that \"[i]t is unlikely that defense counsel will insist on live testimony whose effect will be merely to highlight rather than cast doubt upon the forensic analysis.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2542. This optimistic prediction misunderstands how criminal trials work. If the defense does not plan to challenge the test result, \"highlight[ing]\" that result through testimony does not harm the defense as the Court supposes. If the analyst cannot <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2557</span> reach the courtroom in time to testify, however, a <i>Melendez-Diaz</i> objection grants the defense a great windfall: The analyst's work cannot come into evidence. Given the prospect of such a windfall (which may, in and of itself, secure an acquittal) few zealous advocates will pledge, prior to trial, not to raise a <i>Melendez-Diaz</i> objection. Defense counsel will accept the risk that the jury may hear the analyst's live testimony, in exchange for the chance that the analyst fails to appear and the government's case collapses. And if, as here, the defense is not that the substance was harmless, but instead that the accused did not possess it, the testimony of the technician is a formalism that does not detract from the defense case.</p>\n<p>In further support of its unlikely hope, the Court relies on the Brief for Law Professors as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 7-8, which reports that nearly 95% of convictions are obtained via guilty plea and thus do not require in-court testimony from laboratory analysts. <i>Ante,</i> at 2540. What the Court does not consider is how its holding will alter these statistics. The defense bar today gains the formidable power to require the government to transport the analyst to the courtroom at the time of trial. Zealous counsel will insist upon concessions: a plea bargain, or a more lenient sentence in exchange for relinquishing this remarkable power.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>As further reassurance that the \"sky will not fall after today's decision,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2540, the Court notes that many States have enacted burden-shifting statutes that require the defendant to assert his Confrontation Clause right prior to trial or else \"forfeit\" it \"by silence.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The Court implies that by shifting the burden to the defendant to take affirmative steps to produce the analyst, these statutes reduce the burden on the prosecution.</p>\n<p>The Court holds that these burden-shifting statutes are valid because, in the Court's view, they \"shift no burden whatever.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2541. While this conclusion is welcome, the premise appears flawed. Even what the Court calls the \"simplest form\" of burden-shifting statutes do impose requirements on the defendant, who must make a formal demand, with proper service, well before trial. Some statutes impose more requirements, for instance by requiring defense counsel to subpoena the analyst, to show good cause for demanding the analyst's presence, or even to affirm under oath an intent to cross-examine the analyst. See generally Metzger, Cheating the Constitution, 59 Vand. L.Rev. 475, 481-485 (2006). In a future case, the Court may find that some of these more onerous burden-shifting statutes violate the Confrontation Clause because they \"impos[e] a burden ... on the defendant to bring ... adverse witnesses into court.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2540.</p>\n<p>The burden-shifting statutes thus provide little reassurance that this case will not impose a meaningless formalism across the board.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>In a further effort to support its assessment that today's decision will not cause disruption, the Court cites 10 decisions from States that, the Court asserts, \"have already adopted the constitutional rule we announce today.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2540, and n. 11. The Court assures us that \"there is no evidence that the criminal justice system has ground to a halt in the[se] States.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2540.</p>\n<p>On inspection, the citations prove far less reassuring than promised. Seven were decided by courts that considered themselves bound by <i>Crawford.</i> These <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2558</span> cases thus offer no support for the Court's assertion that the state jurists independently \"adopted\" the Court's interpretation as a matter of state law. Quite the contrary, the debate in those seven courts was over just how far this Court intended <i>Crawford</i> to sweep. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>State v. Belvin,</i> 986 So.2d 516, 526 (Fla.2008) (Wells, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\"I believe that the majority has extended the <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Davis</i> decisions beyond their intended reach\" (citations omitted)). The Court should correct these courts' overbroad reading of <i>Crawford,</i> not endorse it. Were the Court to do so, these seven jurisdictions might well change their position.</p>\n<p>Moreover, because these seven courts only \"adopted\" the Court's position in the wake of <i>Crawford,</i> their decisions are all quite recent. These States have not yet been subject to the widespread, adverse results of the formalism the Court mandates today.</p>\n<p>The citations also fail to reassure for a different reason. Five of the Court's 10 citationsincluding all 3 pre-<i>Crawford</i> casescome from States that have reduced the confrontation right. Four States have enacted a burden-shifting statute requiring the defendant to give early notice of his intent to confront the analyst. See Part III-B, <i>supra;</i> Colorado: <i>Hinojos-Mendoza v. People,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2625273\"><a href=\"/opinion/2625273/hinojos-mendoza-v-people/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span>, 668-671 (Colo.2007), Colo.Rev.Stat. § 16-3-309 (2008) (defendant must give notice 10 days before trial); Georgia: Compare <i>Miller v.

McClanahan,</i> 191 Ill.2d 127, 133-134, 246 Ill.Dec. 97, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2124919\"><a href=\"/opinion/2124919/people-v-mcclanahan/\"><span class=\"volume\">729</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></a></span>, 474-475 (2000), Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 725, § 5/115-15 (2006) (defendant must give notice \"within 7 days\" of \"receipt of the report\"); Oregon: <i>State v. Birchfield,</i> 342 Or., at 631-632, 157 P.3d, at 220 (suggesting that a \"typical notice requirement\" would be lawful), see Ore.Rev. Stat. § 475.235 (2007) (defendant must give notice 15 days before trial). A fifth State, Mississippi, excuses the prosecution from producing the analyst who conducted the test, so long as it produces someone. Compare <i>Barnette v. State,</i> 481 So.2d 788, 792 (Miss.1985) (cited by the Court), with <i>McGowen v. State,</i> 859 So.2d 320, 339-340 (Miss.2003) (the Sixth Amendment does not require confrontation with the particular analyst who conducted the test). It is possible that neither Mississippi's practice nor the burden-shifting statutes can be reconciled with the Court's holding. See Part III-B, <i>supra.</i> The disruption caused by today's decision has yet to take place in these States.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Laboratory analysts who conduct routine scientific tests are not the kind of conventional witnesses to whom the Confrontation Clause refers.

While the dissent is correct that \"[i]t is the obligation of the prosecution to establish the chain of custody,\" <i>post,</i> at 2546, this does not mean that everyone who laid hands on the evidence must be called. As stated in the dissent's own quotation, <i>ibid.,</i> from <i>United States v. Lott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510148\"><a href=\"/opinion/510148/united-states-v-charles-t-lott/\"><span class=\"volume\">854</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span>, 250 (C.A.7 1988), \"gaps in the chain [of custody] normally go to the weight of the evidence rather than its admissibility.\" It is up to the prosecution to decide what steps in the chain of custody are so crucial as to require evidence; but what testimony <i>is</i> introduced must (if the defendant objects) be introduced live. Additionally, documents prepared in the regular course of equipment maintenance may well qualify as nontestimonial records. See <i>infra,</i> at 2550-2551, 2552.</p>\n<p>[2]  The exception is a single pre-<i>Roberts</i> case that relied on longstanding Massachusetts precedent. See <i>Commonwealth v. Harvard,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2240868\"><a href=\"/opinion/2240868/commonwealth-v-harvard/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span>, 462, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2240868\"><a href=\"/opinion/2240868/commonwealth-v-harvard/\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></a></span>, 352 (1969). Others are simply irrelevant, since they involved medical reports created for treatment purposes, which would not be testimonial under our decision today. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Baber v. State,</i> 775 So.2d 258, 258-259 (Fla. 2000); <i>State v. Garlick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1525314\"><a href=\"/opinion/1525314/state-v-garlick/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></a></span>, 223-225, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1525314\"><a href=\"/opinion/1525314/state-v-garlick/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 34-35 (1988).</p>\n<p>[3]  The right to confrontation may, of course, be waived, including by failure to object to the offending evidence; and States may adopt procedural rules governing the exercise of such objections. See <i>infra,</i> at 2554.</p>\n<p>[4]  Respondent cites our decision in <i>Gray v. Maryland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118184\"><a href=\"/opinion/118184/gray-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span>, 118 S.Ct. 1151, 140 L.Ed.2d 294 (1998). That case did indeed distinguish between evidence that is \"incriminating on its face\" and evidence that \"bec[omes] incriminating... only when linked with evidence introduced later at trial,\" <i>id.,</i> at 191, 118 S.Ct. 1151 (internal quotation marks omitted). But it did so for the entirely different purpose of determining when a nontestifying codefendant's confession, redacted to remove all mention of the defendant, could be admitted into evidence with instruction for the jury not to consider the confession as evidence against the nonconfessor. The very premise of the case was that, without the limiting instruction even admission of a redacted confession containing evidence of the latter sort <i>would have</i> violated the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights. See <i>id.,</i> at 190-191, 118 S.Ct. 1151.</p>\n<p>[5]  Though surely not always. Some forensic analyses, such as autopsies and breathalyzer tests, cannot be repeated, and the specimens used for other analyses have often been lost or degraded.</p>\n<p>[6]  Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, <i>post,</i> at 2555, we do not \"rel[y] in such great measure\" on the deficiencies of crime-lab analysts shown by this report to resolve the constitutional question presented in this case. The analysts who swore the affidavits provided testimony against Melendez-Diaz, and they are therefore subject to confrontation; we would reach the same conclusion if all analysts always possessed the scientific acumen of Mme. Curie and the veracity of Mother Theresa. We discuss the report only to refute the suggestion that this category of evidence is uniquely reliable and that cross-examination of the analysts would be an empty formalism.</p>\n<p>[7]  The early common-law cases likewise involve records prepared for the administration of an entity's affairs, and not for use in litigation. See, <i>e.g., King v. Rhodes,</i> 1 Leach 24, 168 Eng. Rep. 115 (1742) (admitting into evidence ship's muster-book); <i>King v. Martin,</i> 2 Camp. 100, 101, 170 Eng. Rep. 1094, 1095 (1809) (vestry book); <i>King v. Aickles,</i> 1 Leach 390, 391-392, 168 Eng. Rep. 297, 298 (1785) (prison logbook).</p>\n<p>[8]  The dissent's reliance on our decision in <i>Dowdell v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97427\"><a href=\"/opinion/97427/dowdell-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span>, 31 S.Ct. 590, 55 L.Ed. 753 (1911), see <i>post,</i> at 2553 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.), is similarly misplaced. As the opinion stated in <i>Dowdell</i>and as this Court noted in <i>Davis v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145641\"><a href=\"/opinion/145641/davis-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">813</span></a></span>, 825, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006)the judge and clerk who made the statements at issue in <i>Dowdell</i> were not witnesses for purposes of the Confrontation Clause because their statements concerned only the conduct of defendants' prior trial, not any facts regarding defendants' guilt or innocence. 221 U.S., at 330-331, 31 S.Ct. 590.</p>\n<p>[9]  An earlier line of 19th century state-court cases also supports the notion that forensic analysts' certificates were not admitted into evidence as public or business records. See <i>Commonwealth v. Waite,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></span>, 266 (1865); <i>Shivers v. Newton,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.L.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></span>, 476 (Sup.Ct.1883); <i>State v. Campbell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92211\"><a href=\"/opinion/92211/united-states-v-baker/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span>, 403, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">585</span></span>, 586 (1888). In all three cases, defendantswho were prosecuted for selling adulterated milkobjected to the admission of the state chemists' certificates of analysis. In all three cases, the objection was defeated because the chemist testified live at trial. That the prosecution came forward with live witnesses in all three cases suggests doubt as to the admissibility of the certificates without opportunity for cross-examination.</p>\n<p>[10]  The dissent provides some back-of-the-envelope calculations regarding the number of court appearances that will result from today's ruling. <i>Post,</i> at 2549-2550. Those numbers rely on various unfounded assumptions: that the prosecution will place into evidence a drug analysis certificate in every case; that the defendant will never stipulate to the nature of the controlled substance; that even where no such stipulation is made, every defendant will object to the evidence or otherwise demand the appearance of the analyst. These assumptions are wildly unrealistic, and, as discussed below, the figures they produce do not reflect what has in fact occurred in those jurisdictions that have already adopted the rule we announce today.</p>\n<p>[11]  <i>State v.

MASSACHUSETTS\n\n  CERTIORARI TO THE APPEALS COURT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n   No. 07–591.      Argued November 10, 2008—Decided June 25, 2009\nAt petitioner’s state-court drug trial, the prosecution introduced certifi\n  cates of state laboratory analysts stating that material seized by po\n  lice and connected to petitioner was cocaine of a certain quantity. As\n  required by Massachusetts law, the certificates were sworn to before\n  a notary public and were submitted as prima facie evidence of what\n  they asserted. Petitioner objected, asserting that Crawford v. Wash\n  ington, 541 U. S. 36, required the analysts to testify in person. The\n  trial court disagreed, the certificates were admitted, and petitioner\n  was convicted. The Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed, rejecting\n  petitioner’s claim that the certificates’ admission violated the Sixth\n  Amendment.\nHeld: The admission of the certificates violated petitioner’s Sixth\n Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him. Pp. 3–23.\n    (a) Under Crawford, a witness’s testimony against a defendant is\n inadmissible unless the witness appears at trial or, if the witness is\n unavailable, the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross\n examination. 541 U. S., at 54. The certificates here are affidavits,\n which fall within the “core class of testimonial statements” covered\n by the Confrontation Clause, id., at 51. They asserted that the sub\n stance found in petitioner’s possession was, as the prosecution\n claimed, cocaine of a certain weight—the precise testimony the ana\n lysts would be expected to provide if called at trial. Not only were the\n certificates made, as Crawford required for testimonial statements,\n “under circumstances which would lead an objective witness rea\n sonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a\n later trial,” id., at 52, but under the relevant Massachusetts law their\n sole purpose was to provide prima facie evidence of the substance’s\n composition, quality, and net weight. Petitioner was entitled to “be\n confronted with” the persons giving this testimony at trial. Id., at 54.\n2                MELENDEZ-DIAZ v. MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    Pp. 3–5.\n       (b) The arguments advanced to avoid this rather straightforward\n    application of Crawford are rejected. Respondent’s claim that the\n    analysts are not subject to confrontation because they are not “accu\n    satory” witnesses finds no support in the Sixth Amendment’s text or\n    in this Court’s case law. The affiants’ testimonial statements were\n    not “nearly contemporaneous” with their observations, nor, if they\n    had been, would that fact alter the statements’ testimonial character.\n    There is no support for the proposition that witnesses who testify re\n    garding facts other than those observed at the crime scene are ex\n    empt from confrontation. The absence of interrogation is irrelevant;\n    a witness who volunteers his testimony is no less a witness for Sixth\n    Amendment purposes. The affidavits do not qualify as traditional of\n    ficial or business records. The argument that the analysts should not\n    be subject to confrontation because their statements result from neu\n    tral scientific testing is little more than an invitation to return to the\n    since-overruled decision in Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56, 66, which\n    held that evidence with “particularized guarantees of trustworthi\n    ness” was admissible without confrontation. Petitioner’s power to\n    subpoena the analysts is no substitute for the right of confrontation.\n    Finally, the requirements of the Confrontation Clause may not be re\n    laxed because they make the prosecution’s task burdensome. In any\n    event, the practice in many States already accords with today’s deci\n    sion, and the serious disruption predicted by respondent and the dis\n    sent has not materialized.

MELENDEZ-DIAZ, PETITIONER v.\n\n                 MASSACHUSETTS \n\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE APPEALS COURT OF\n\n                   MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                                 [June 25, 2009] \n\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Massachusetts courts in this case admitted into\nevidence affidavits reporting the results of forensic analy\nsis which showed that material seized by the police and\nconnected to the defendant was cocaine. The question\npresented is whether those affidavits are “testimonial,”\nrendering the affiants “witnesses” subject to the defen\ndant’s right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment.\n                             I\n  In 2001, Boston police officers received a tip that a\nKmart employee, Thomas Wright, was engaging in suspi\ncious activity. The informant reported that Wright re\npeatedly received phone calls at work, after each of which\nhe would be picked up in front of the store by a blue sedan,\nand would return to the store a short time later. The\npolice set up surveillance in the Kmart parking lot and\nwitnessed this precise sequence of events. When Wright\ngot out of the car upon his return, one of the officers de\ntained and searched him, finding four clear white plastic\nbags containing a substance resembling cocaine. The\nofficer then signaled other officers on the scene to arrest\n2           MELENDEZ-DIAZ v. MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe two men in the car—one of whom was petitioner Luis\nMelendez-Diaz. The officers placed all three men in a\npolice cruiser.\n   During the short drive to the police station, the officers\nobserved their passengers fidgeting and making furtive\nmovements in the back of the car. After depositing the\nmen at the station, they searched the police cruiser and\nfound a plastic bag containing 19 smaller plastic bags\nhidden in the partition between the front and back seats.\nThey submitted the seized evidence to a state laboratory\nrequired by law to conduct chemical analysis upon police\nrequest. Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 111, §12 (West 2006).\n   Melendez-Diaz was charged with distributing cocaine\nand with trafficking in cocaine in an amount between 14\nand 28 grams. Ch. 94C, §§32A, 32E(b)(1). At trial, the\nprosecution placed into evidence the bags seized from\nWright and from the police cruiser. It also submitted\nthree “certificates of analysis” showing the results of the\nforensic analysis performed on the seized substances. The\ncertificates reported the weight of the seized bags and\nstated that the bags “[h]a[ve] been examined with the\nfollowing results: The substance was found to contain:\nCocaine.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a, 26a, 28a. The certifi\ncates were sworn to before a notary public by analysts at\nthe State Laboratory Institute of the Massachusetts De\npartment of Public Health, as required under Massachu\nsetts law. Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 111, §13.\n   Petitioner objected to the admission of the certificates,\nasserting that our Confrontation Clause decision in Craw\nford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36 (2004), required the\nanalysts to testify in person. The objection was overruled,\nand the certificates were admitted pursuant to state law\nas “prima facie evidence of the composition, quality, and\nthe net weight of the narcotic . . . analyzed.” Mass. Gen.\nLaws, ch. 111, §13.\n   The jury found Melendez-Diaz guilty. He appealed,\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

The Appeals\nCourt of Massachusetts rejected the claim, affirmance\norder, 69 Mass. App. 1114, 870 N. E. 2d 676, 2007 WL\n2189152, *4, n. 3 (July 31, 2007), relying on the Massa\nchusetts Supreme Judicial Court’s decision in Common\nwealth v. Verde, 444 Mass. 279, 283–285, 827 N. E. 2d 701,\n705–706 (2005), which held that the authors of certificates\nof forensic analysis are not subject to confrontation under\nthe Sixth Amendment. The Supreme Judicial Court de\nnied review. 449 Mass. 1113, 874 N. E. 2d 407 (2007). We\ngranted certiorari. 552 U. S. ___ (2008).\n                              II\n   The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitu\ntion, made applicable to the States via the Fourteenth\nAmendment, Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400, 403 (1965),\nprovides that “[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused\nshall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the wit\nnesses against him.” In Crawford, after reviewing the\nClause’s historical underpinnings, we held that it guaran\ntees a defendant’s right to confront those “who ‘bear testi\nmony’ ” against him. 541 U. S., at 51. A witness’s testi\nmony against a defendant is thus inadmissible unless the\nwitness appears at trial or, if the witness is unavailable,\nthe defendant had a prior opportunity for cross\nexamination. Id., at 54.\n   Our opinion described the class of testimonial state\nments covered by the Confrontation Clause as follows:\n       “Various formulations of this core class of testimo\n    nial statements exist: ex parte in-court testimony or\n    its functional equivalent—that is, material such as af\n    fidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that\n    the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar\n    pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably\n4           MELENDEZ-DIAZ v. MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    expect to be used prosecutorially; extrajudicial state\n    ments . . . contained in formalized testimonial materi\n    als, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or\n    confessions; statements that were made under cir\n    cumstances which would lead an objective witness\n    reasonably to believe that the statement would be\n    available for use at a later trial.” Id., at 51–52 (inter\n    nal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n   There is little doubt that the documents at issue in this\ncase fall within the “core class of testimonial statements”\nthus described. Our description of that category mentions\naffidavits twice. See also White v. Illinois, 502 U. S. 346,\n365 (1992) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment) (“[T]he Confrontation Clause is implicated by\nextrajudicial statements only insofar as they are contained\nin formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits,\ndepositions, prior testimony, or confessions”). The docu\nments at issue here, while denominated by Massachusetts\nlaw “certificates,” are quite plainly affidavits: “declara\ntion[s] of facts written down and sworn to by the declarant\nbefore an officer authorized to administer oaths.” Black’s\nLaw Dictionary 62 (8th ed. 2004). They are incontroverti\nbly a “ ‘solemn declaration or affirmation made for the\npurpose of establishing or proving some fact.’ ” Crawford,\nsupra, at 51 (quoting 2 N. Webster, An American Diction\nary of the English Language (1828)). The fact in question\nis that the substance found in the possession of Melendez-\nDiaz and his codefendants was, as the prosecution\nclaimed, cocaine—the precise testimony the analysts\nwould be expected to provide if called at trial. The “certifi\ncates” are functionally identical to live, in-court testimony,\ndoing “precisely what a witness does on direct examina\ntion.” Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 830 (2006)\n(emphasis deleted).\n   Here, moreover, not only were the affidavits “ ‘made\n                      Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                      5\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nunder circumstances which would lead an objective wit\nness reasonably to believe that the statement would be\navailable for use at a later trial,’ ” Crawford, supra, at 52,\nbut under Massachusetts law the sole purpose of the affi\ndavits was to provide “prima facie evidence of the composi\ntion, quality, and the net weight” of the analyzed sub\nstance, Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 111, §13. We can safely\nassume that the analysts were aware of the affidavits’\nevidentiary purpose, since that purpose—as stated in the\nrelevant state-law provision—was reprinted on the affida\nvits themselves. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a, 27a, 29a.\n   In short, under our decision in Crawford the analysts’\naffidavits were testimonial statements, and the analysts\nwere “witnesses” for purposes of the Sixth Amendment.\nAbsent a showing that the analysts were unavailable to\ntestify at trial and that petitioner had a prior opportunity\nto cross-examine them, petitioner was entitled to “ ‘be\nconfronted with’ ” the analysts at trial. Crawford, supra,\nat 54.1\n                        III\n  Respondent and the dissent advance a potpourri of\n——————\n  1 Contrary   to the dissent’s suggestion, post, at 3–4, 7 (opinion of KEN-\nNEDY,   J.), we do not hold, and it is not the case, that anyone whose\ntestimony may be relevant in establishing the chain of custody, authen\nticity of the sample, or accuracy of the testing device, must appear in\nperson as part of the prosecution’s case. While the dissent is correct\nthat “[i]t is the obligation of the prosecution to establish the chain of\ncustody,” post, at 7, this does not mean that everyone who laid hands on\nthe evidence must be called. As stated in the dissent’s own quotation,\nibid., from United States v. Lott, 854 F. 2d 244, 250 (CA7 1988), “gaps\nin the chain [of custody] normally go to the weight of the evidence\nrather than its admissibility.” It is up to the prosecution to decide what\nsteps in the chain of custody are so crucial as to require evidence; but\nwhat testimony is introduced must (if the defendant objects) be intro\nduced live. Additionally, documents prepared in the regular course of\nequipment maintenance may well qualify as nontestimonial records.\nSee infra, at 15–16, 18.\n6             MELENDEZ-DIAZ v. MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nanalytic arguments in an effort to avoid this rather\nstraightforward application of our holding in Crawford.\nBefore addressing them, however, we must assure the\nreader of the falsity of the dissent’s opening alarum that\nwe are “sweep[ing] away an accepted rule governing the\nadmission of scientific evidence” that has been “estab\nlished for at least 90 years” and “extends across at least 35\nStates and six Federal Courts of Appeals.” Post, at 1\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.).\n   The vast majority of the state-court cases the dissent\ncites in support of this claim come not from the last 90\nyears, but from the last 30, and not surprisingly nearly all\nof them rely on our decision in Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S.\n56 (1980), or its since-rejected theory that unconfronted\ntestimony was admissible as long as it bore indicia of\nreliability, id., at 66. See post, at 30.2 As for the six Fed\neral Courts of Appeals cases cited by the dissent, five of\nthem postdated and expressly relied on Roberts. See post,\nat 21–22. The sixth predated Roberts but relied entirely\non the same erroneous theory. See Kay v. United States,\n255 F. 2d 476, 480–481 (CA4 1958) (rejecting confronta\ntion clause challenge “where there is reasonable necessity\nfor [the evidence] and where . . . the evidence has those\nqualities of reliability and trustworthiness”).\n   A review of cases that predate the Roberts era yields a\nmixed picture. As the dissent notes, three state supreme\ncourt decisions from the early 20th century denied con\nfrontation with respect to certificates of analysis regarding\na substance’s alcohol content. See post, at 21 (citing cases\n——————\n   2 The exception is a single pre-Roberts case that relied on longstand\n\ning Massachusetts precedent. See Commonwealth v. Harvard, 356\nMass. 452, 462, 253 N. E. 2d 346, 352 (1969). Others are simply irrele\nvant, since they involved medical reports created for treatment pur\nposes, which would not be testimonial under our decision today. See,\ne.g., Baber v. State, 775 So. 2d 258, 258–259 (Fla. 2000); State v. Gar\nlick, 313 Md. 209, 223–225, 545 A. 2d 27, 34–35 (1998).\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Virginia). But\nother state courts in the same era reached the opposite\nconclusion. See Torres v. State, 18 S. W. 2d 179, 180 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 1929); Volrich v. State, No. 278, 1925 WL 2473\n(Ohio App., Nov. 2, 1925). At least this much is entirely\nclear: In faithfully applying Crawford to the facts of this\ncase, we are not overruling 90 years of settled jurispru\ndence. It is the dissent that seeks to overturn precedent\nby resurrecting Roberts a mere five years after it was\nrejected in Crawford.\n  We turn now to the various legal arguments raised by\nrespondent and the dissent.\n                             A\n   Respondent first argues that the analysts are not sub\nject to confrontation because they are not “accusatory”\nwitnesses, in that they do not directly accuse petitioner of\nwrongdoing; rather, their testimony is inculpatory only\nwhen taken together with other evidence linking peti\ntioner to the contraband. See Brief for Respondent 10.\nThis finds no support in the text of the Sixth Amendment\nor in our case law.\n   The Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right\n“to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” (Em\nphasis added.) To the extent the analysts were witnesses\n(a question resolved above), they certainly provided testi\nmony against petitioner, proving one fact necessary for his\nconviction—that the substance he possessed was cocaine.\nThe contrast between the text of the Confrontation Clause\nand the text of the adjacent Compulsory Process Clause\nconfirms this analysis. While the Confrontation Clause\nguarantees a defendant the right to be confronted with the\nwitnesses “against him,” the Compulsory Process Clause\nguarantees a defendant the right to call witnesses “in his\nfavor.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 6. The text of the Amendment\ncontemplates two classes of witnesses—those against the\n8              MELENDEZ-DIAZ v. MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndefendant and those in his favor. The prosecution must\nproduce the former;3 the defendant may call the latter.\nContrary to respondent’s assertion, there is not a third\ncategory of witnesses, helpful to the prosecution, but\nsomehow immune from confrontation.\n  It is often, indeed perhaps usually, the case that an\nadverse witness’s testimony, taken alone, will not suffice\nto convict. Yet respondent fails to cite a single case in\nwhich such testimony was admitted absent a defendant’s\nopportunity to cross-examine.4 Unsurprisingly, since such\na holding would be contrary to longstanding case law. In\nKirby v. United States, 174 U. S. 47 (1899), the Court\nconsidered Kirby’s conviction for receiving stolen property,\nthe evidence for which consisted, in part, of the records of\nconviction of three individuals who were found guilty of\nstealing the relevant property. Id., at 53. Though this\nevidence proved only that the property was stolen, and not\nthat Kirby received it, the Court nevertheless ruled that\nadmission of the records violated Kirby’s rights under the\nConfrontation Clause. Id., at 55. See also King v. Turner,\n1 Mood. 347, 168 Eng. Rep. 1298 (1832) (confession by one\ndefendant to having stolen certain goods could not be used\n——————\n    3 The right to confrontation may, of course, be waived, including by\n\nfailure to object to the offending evidence; and States may adopt proce\ndural rules governing the exercise of such objections. See infra, at 21.\n    4 Respondent cites our decision in Gray v. Maryland, 523 U. S. 185\n\n(1998). That case did indeed distinguish between evidence that is\n“incriminating on its face” and evidence that “bec[omes] incriminating\n. . . only when linked with evidence introduced later at trial, ” id., at\n191 (internal quotation marks omitted). But it did so for the entirely\ndifferent purpose of determining when a nontestifying codefendant’s\nconfession, redacted to remove all mention of the defendant, could be\nadmitted into evidence with instruction for the jury not to consider the\nconfession as evidence against the nonconfessor. The very premise of\nthe case was that, without the limiting instruction even admission of a\nredacted confession containing evidence of the latter sort would have\nviolated the defendant’s Sixth Amendment rights. See id., at 190–191.\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

Post, at 15–16; Brief for\nRespondent 28. It is true, as the Court recognized in\nCrawford, that ex parte examinations of the sort used at\nRaleigh’s trial have “long been thought a paradigmatic\nconfrontation violation.” 541 U. S., at 52. But the para\ndigmatic case identifies the core of the right to confronta\ntion, not its limits. The right to confrontation was not\ninvented in response to the use of the ex parte examina\ntions in Raleigh’s Case, 2 How. St. Tr. 1 (1603). That use\nprovoked such an outcry precisely because it flouted the\ndeeply rooted common-law tradition “of live testimony in\ncourt subject to adversarial testing.” Crawford, supra, at\n43 (citing 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of\nEngland 373–374 (1768)). See also Crawford, supra, at\n43–47.\n   In any case, the purported distinctions respondent and\nthe dissent identify between this case and Sir Walter\nRaleigh’s “conventional” accusers do not survive scrutiny.\nThe dissent first contends that a “conventional witness\nrecalls events observed in the past, while an analyst’s\nreport contains near-contemporaneous observations of the\ntest.” Post, at 16–17. It is doubtful that the analyst’s\nreports in this case could be characterized as reporting\n“near-contemporaneous observations”; the affidavits were\ncompleted almost a week after the tests were performed.\nSee App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a–29a (the tests were per\nformed on November 28, 2001, and the affidavits sworn on\nDecember 4, 2001). But regardless, the dissent misunder\n10          MELENDEZ-DIAZ v. MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstands the role that “near-contemporaneity” has played in\nour case law. The dissent notes that that factor was given\n“substantial weight” in Davis, post, at 17, but in fact that\ndecision disproves the dissent’s position. There the Court\nconsidered the admissibility of statements made to police\nofficers responding to a report of a domestic disturbance.\nBy the time officers arrived the assault had ended, but the\nvictim’s statements—written and oral—were sufficiently\nclose in time to the alleged assault that the trial court\nadmitted her affidavit as a “present sense impression.”\nDavis, 547 U. S., at 820 (internal quotation marks omit\nted). Though the witness’s statements in Davis were\n“near-contemporaneous” to the events she reported, we\nnevertheless held that they could not be admitted absent\nan opportunity to confront the witness. Id., at 830.\n  A second reason the dissent contends that the analysts\nare not “conventional witnesses” (and thus not subject to\nconfrontation) is that they “observe[d] neither the crime\nnor any human action related to it.” Post, at 17. The\ndissent provides no authority for this particular limitation\nof the type of witnesses subject to confrontation. Nor is it\nconceivable that all witnesses who fit this description\nwould be outside the scope of the Confrontation Clause.\nFor example, is a police officer’s investigative report de\nscribing the crime scene admissible absent an opportunity\nto examine the officer? The dissent’s novel exception from\ncoverage of the Confrontation Clause would exempt all\nexpert witnesses—a hardly “unconventional” class of\nwitnesses.\n  A third respect in which the dissent asserts that the\nanalysts are not “conventional” witnesses and thus not\nsubject to confrontation is that their statements were not\nprovided in response to interrogation. Ibid. See also Brief\nfor Respondent 29. As we have explained, “[t]he Framers\nwere no more willing to exempt from cross-examination\nvolunteered testimony or answers to open-ended questions\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthan they were to exempt answers to detailed interroga\ntion.” Davis, supra, at 822–823, n. 1. Respondent and the\ndissent cite no authority, and we are aware of none, hold\ning that a person who volunteers his testimony is any less\na “ ‘witness against’ the defendant,” Brief for Respondent\n26, than one who is responding to interrogation. In any\nevent, the analysts’ affidavits in this case were presented\nin response to a police request. See Mass. Gen. Laws, ch.\n111, §§12–13. If an affidavit submitted in response to a\npolice officer’s request to “write down what happened”\nsuffices to trigger the Sixth Amendment’s protection (as it\napparently does, see Davis, 547 U. S., at 819–820; id., at\n840, n. 5 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part)), then the analysts’ testimony should\nbe subject to confrontation as well.\n                                C\n  Respondent claims that there is a difference, for Con\nfrontation Clause purposes, between testimony recounting\nhistorical events, which is “prone to distortion or manipu\nlation,” and the testimony at issue here, which is the\n“resul[t] of neutral, scientific testing.” Brief for Respon\ndent 29. Relatedly, respondent and the dissent argue that\nconfrontation of forensic analysts would be of little value\nbecause “one would not reasonably expect a laboratory\nprofessional . . . to feel quite differently about the results\nof his scientific test by having to look at the defendant.”\nId., at 31 (internal quotation marks omitted); see post, at\n10–11.\n  This argument is little more than an invitation to return\nto our overruled decision in Roberts, 448 U. S. 56, which\nheld that evidence with “particularized guarantees of\ntrustworthiness” was admissible notwithstanding the\nConfrontation Clause. Id., at 66. What we said in Craw\nford in response to that argument remains true:\n    “To be sure, the Clause’s ultimate goal is to ensure re\n12            MELENDEZ-DIAZ v. MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n     liability of evidence, but it is a procedural rather than\n     a substantive guarantee. It commands, not that evi\n     dence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a\n     particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross\n     examination. . . . Dispensing with confrontation be\n     cause testimony is obviously reliable is akin to dis\n     pensing with jury trial because a defendant is obvi\n     ously guilty. This is not what the Sixth Amendment\n     prescribes.” 541 U. S., at 61–62.\nRespondent and the dissent may be right that there are\nother ways—and in some cases better ways—to challenge\nor verify the results of a forensic test.5 But the Constitu\ntion guarantees one way: confrontation. We do not have\nlicense to suspend the Confrontation Clause when a pref\nerable trial strategy is available.\n   Nor is it evident that what respondent calls “neutral\nscientific testing” is as neutral or as reliable as respondent\nsuggests. Forensic evidence is not uniquely immune from\nthe risk of manipulation. According to a recent study\nconducted under the auspices of the National Academy of\nSciences, “[t]he majority of [laboratories producing foren\nsic evidence] are administered by law enforcement agen\ncies, such as police departments, where the laboratory\nadministrator reports to the head of the agency.” National\nResearch Council of the National Academies, Strengthen\ning Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward\n6–1 (Prepublication Copy Feb. 2009) (hereinafter National\nAcademy Report). And “[b]ecause forensic scientists often\nare driven in their work by a need to answer a particular\nquestion related to the issues of a particular case, they\nsometimes face pressure to sacrifice appropriate method\nology for the sake of expediency.” Id., at S–17. A forensic\n——————\n  5 Though surely not always.

While it is true, as the dissent notes, that an\nhonest analyst will not alter his testimony when forced to\nconfront the defendant, post, at 10, the same cannot be\nsaid of the fraudulent analyst. See Brief for National\nInnocence Network as Amicus Curiae 15–17 (discussing\ncases of documented “drylabbing” where forensic analysts\nreport results of tests that were never performed); Na\ntional Academy Report 1–8 to 1–10 (discussing docu\nmented cases of fraud and error involving the use of foren\nsic evidence). Like the eyewitness who has fabricated his\naccount to the police, the analyst who provides false re\nsults may, under oath in open court, reconsider his false\ntestimony. See Coy v. Iowa, 487 U. S. 1012, 1019 (1988).\nAnd, of course, the prospect of confrontation will deter\nfraudulent analysis in the first place.\n   Confrontation is designed to weed out not only the\nfraudulent analyst, but the incompetent one as well.\nSerious deficiencies have been found in the forensic evi\ndence used in criminal trials. One commentator asserts\nthat “[t]he legal community now concedes, with varying\ndegrees of urgency, that our system produces erroneous\nconvictions based on discredited forensics.” Metzger,\nCheating the Constitution, 59 Vand. L. Rev. 475, 491\n(2006). One study of cases in which exonerating evidence\nresulted in the overturning of criminal convictions con\ncluded that invalid forensic testimony contributed to the\nconvictions in 60% of the cases. Garrett & Neufeld, Inva\nlid Forensic Science Testimony and Wrongful Convictions,\n95 Va. L. Rev. 1, 14 (2009). And the National Academy\nReport concluded:\n    “The forensic science system, encompassing both re\n14             MELENDEZ-DIAZ v. MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n     search and practice, has serious problems that can\n     only be addressed by a national commitment to over\n     haul the current structure that supports the forensic\n     science community in this country.” National Acad\n     emy Report P–1 (emphasis in original).6\nLike expert witnesses generally, an analyst’s lack of\nproper training or deficiency in judgment may be disclosed\nin cross-examination.\n   This case is illustrative. The affidavits submitted by the\nanalysts contained only the bare-bones statement that\n“[t]he substance was found to contain: Cocaine.” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 24a, 26a, 28a. At the time of trial, petitioner\ndid not know what tests the analysts performed, whether\nthose tests were routine, and whether interpreting their\nresults required the exercise of judgment or the use of\nskills that the analysts may not have possessed. While we\nstill do not know the precise tests used by the analysts, we\nare told that the laboratories use “methodology recom\nmended by the Scientific Working Group for the Analysis\nof Seized Drugs,” App. to Brief for Petitioner 1a–2a. At\nleast some of that methodology requires the exercise of\njudgment and presents a risk of error that might be ex\nplored on cross-examination. See 2 P.

Contrary to respondent’s and the\ndissent’s suggestion, there is little reason to believe that\nconfrontation will be useless in testing analysts’ honesty,\nproficiency, and methodology—the features that are com\nmonly the focus in the cross-examination of experts.\n                            D\n  Respondent argues that the analysts’ affidavits are\nadmissible without confrontation because they are “akin to\nthe types of official and business records admissible at\ncommon law.” Brief for Respondent 35. But the affidavits\ndo not qualify as traditional official or business records,\nand even if they did, their authors would be subject to\nconfrontation nonetheless.\n  Documents kept in the regular course of business may\nordinarily be admitted at trial despite their hearsay\nstatus.

MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nproduction of evidence for use at trial. Our decision in\nPalmer v. Hoffman, 318 U. S. 109 (1943), made that dis\ntinction clear. There we held that an accident report\nprovided by an employee of a railroad company did not\nqualify as a business record because, although kept in the\nregular course of the railroad’s operations, it was “calcu\nlated for use essentially in the court, not in the business.”\nId., at 114.7 The analysts’ certificates—like police reports\ngenerated by law enforcement officials—do not qualify as\nbusiness or public records for precisely the same reason.\nSee Rule 803(8) (defining public records as “excluding,\nhowever, in criminal cases matters observed by police\nofficers and other law enforcement personnel”).\n   Respondent seeks to rebut this limitation by noting that\nat common law the results of a coroner’s inquest were\nadmissible without an opportunity for confrontation. But\nas we have previously noted, whatever the status of coro\nner’s reports at common law in England, they were not\naccorded any special status in American practice. See\nCrawford, 541 U.

Rev. 290 (1917).\n   The dissent identifies a single class of evidence which,\nthough prepared for use at trial, was traditionally admis\nsible: a clerk’s certificate authenticating an official re\ncord—or a copy thereof—for use as evidence.

The\ndissent suggests that the fact that this exception was\n“ ‘narrowly circumscribed’ ” makes no difference. See post,\nat 20. To the contrary, it makes all the difference in the\nworld. It shows that even the line of cases establishing\nthe one narrow exception the dissent has been able to\nidentify simultaneously vindicates the general rule appli\ncable to the present case. A clerk could by affidavit au\nthenticate or provide a copy of an otherwise admissible\nrecord, but could not do what the analysts did here: create\na record for the sole purpose of providing evidence against\na defendant.8\n   Far more probative here are those cases in which the\nprosecution sought to admit into evidence a clerk’s certifi\ncate attesting to the fact that the clerk had searched for a\nparticular relevant record and failed to find it. Like the\ntestimony of the analysts in this case, the clerk’s state\nment would serve as substantive evidence against the\ndefendant whose guilt depended on the nonexistence of the\nrecord for which the clerk searched.

S. 813, 825 (2006)—the judge and\nclerk who made the statements at issue in Dowdell were not witnesses\nfor purposes of the Confrontation Clause because their statements\nconcerned only the conduct of defendants’ prior trial, not any facts\nregarding defendants’ guilt or innocence. 221 U.

MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe clerk was certainly not a “conventional witness” under\nthe dissent’s approach, the clerk was nonetheless subject\nto confrontation.

As we stated in Crawford:\n“Most of the hearsay exceptions covered statements that\nby their nature were not testimonial—for example, busi\nness records or statements in furtherance of a conspiracy.”\n541 U. S., at 56. Business and public records are generally\nadmissible absent confrontation not because they qualify\nunder an exception to the hearsay rules, but because—\nhaving been created for the administration of an entity’s\naffairs and not for the purpose of establishing or proving\nsome fact at trial—they are not testimonial. Whether or\nnot they qualify as business or official records, the ana\nlysts’ statements here—prepared specifically for use at\npetitioner’s trial—were testimony against petitioner, and\nthe analysts were subject to confrontation under the Sixth\nAmendment.\n                             E\n     Respondent asserts that we should find no Confronta\n——————\n  9 An  earlier line of 19th century state-court cases also supports the\nnotion that forensic analysts’ certificates were not admitted into evi\ndence as public or business records. See Commonwealth v. Waite, 93\nMass. 264, 266 (1865); Shivers v. Newton, 45 N. J. L. 469, 476 (Sup. Ct.\n1883); State v. Campbell, 64 N. H. 402, 403, 13 A. 585, 586 (1888). In\nall three cases, defendants—who were prosecuted for selling adulter\nated milk—objected to the admission of the state chemists’ certificates\nof analysis. In all three cases, the objection was defeated because the\nchemist testified live at trial. That the prosecution came forward with\nlive witnesses in all three cases suggests doubt as to the admissibility\nof the certificates without opportunity for cross-examination.\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

But that power—\nwhether pursuant to state law or the Compulsory Process\nClause—is no substitute for the right of confrontation.\nUnlike the Confrontation Clause, those provisions are of\nno use to the defendant when the witness is unavailable or\nsimply refuses to appear. See, e.g., Davis, 547 U. S., at\n820 (“[The witness] was subpoenaed, but she did not ap\npear at . . . trial”). Converting the prosecution’s duty\nunder the Confrontation Clause into the defendant’s privi\nlege under state law or the Compulsory Process Clause\nshifts the consequences of adverse-witness no-shows from\nthe State to the accused. More fundamentally, the Con\nfrontation Clause imposes a burden on the prosecution to\npresent its witnesses, not on the defendant to bring those\nadverse witnesses into court. Its value to the defendant is\nnot replaced by a system in which the prosecution pre\nsents its evidence via ex parte affidavits and waits for the\ndefendant to subpoena the affiants if he chooses.\n                              F\n   Finally, respondent asks us to relax the requirements of\nthe Confrontation Clause to accommodate the “ ‘necessities\nof trial and the adversary process.’ ” Brief for Respondent\n59. It is not clear whence we would derive the authority to\ndo so. The Confrontation Clause may make the prosecu\ntion of criminals more burdensome, but that is equally\ntrue of the right to trial by jury and the privilege against\nself-incrimination. The Confrontation Clause—like those\nother constitutional provisions—is binding, and we may\nnot disregard it at our convenience.\n   We also doubt the accuracy of respondent’s and the\ndissent’s dire predictions. The dissent, respondent, and its\namici highlight the substantial total number of controlled\nsubstance analyses performed by state and federal labora\ntories in recent years. But only some of those tests are\n20             MELENDEZ-DIAZ v.

Despite these widespread\npractices, there is no evidence that the criminal justice\nsystem has ground to a halt in the States that, one way or\nanother, empower a defendant to insist upon the analyst’s\nappearance at trial.

But its doubts rest on two flawed\npremises. First, the dissent believes that those state\nstatutes “requiring the defendant to give early notice of\nhis intent to confront the analyst,” are “burden-shifting\nstatutes [that] may be invalidated by the Court’s reason\ning.” Post, at 22, 28–29. That is not so. In their simplest\nform, notice-and-demand statutes require the prosecution\nto provide notice to the defendant of its intent to use an\nanalyst’s report as evidence at trial, after which the de\nfendant is given a period of time in which he may object to\nthe admission of the evidence absent the analyst’s appear\nance live at trial. See, e.g, Ga. Code Ann. §35–3–154.1\n(2006); Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 38.41, §4 (Vernon\n2005); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §2925.51(C) (West 2006).\nContrary to the dissent’s perception, these statutes shift\nno burden whatever. The defendant always has the bur\nden of raising his Confrontation Clause objection; notice\nand-demand statutes simply govern the time within which\nhe must do so. States are free to adopt procedural rules\ngoverning objections. See Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S.\n72, 86–87 (1977). It is common to require a defendant to\nexercise his rights under the Compulsory Process Clause\nin advance of trial, announcing his intent to present cer\ntain witnesses. See Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 12.1(a), (e),\n16(b)(1)(C); Comment: Alibi Notice Rules: The Preclusion\nSanction as Procedural Default, 51 U. Chi. L. Rev. 254,\n254–255, 281–285 (1984) (discussing and cataloguing\nState notice-of-alibi rules); Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U. S.\n400, 411 (1988); Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78, 81–82\n(1970). There is no conceivable reason why he cannot\nsimilarly be compelled to exercise his Confrontation\nClause rights before trial. See Hinojos-Mendoza v. People,\n169 P. 3d 662, 670 (Colo. 2007) (discussing and approving\nColorado’s notice-and-demand provision). Today’s decision\n22             MELENDEZ-DIAZ v. MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwill not disrupt criminal prosecutions in the many large\nStates whose practice is already in accord with the Con\nfrontation Clause.12\n   Second, the dissent notes that several of the state-court\ncases that have already adopted this rule did so pursuant\nto our decision in Crawford, and not “independently . . . as\na matter of state law.” Post, at 28. That may be so. But\nin assessing the likely practical effects of today’s ruling, it\nis irrelevant why those courts adopted this rule; it matters\nonly that they did so. It is true that many of these deci\nsions are recent, but if the dissent’s dire predictions were\naccurate, and given the large number of drug prosecutions\nat the state level, one would have expected immediate and\ndramatic results. The absence of such evidence is telling.\n   But it is not surprising. Defense attorneys and their\nclients will often stipulate to the nature of the substance\nin the ordinary drug case. It is unlikely that defense\ncounsel will insist on live testimony whose effect will be\nmerely to highlight rather than cast doubt upon the foren\nsic analysis. Nor will defense attorneys want to antago\nnize the judge or jury by wasting their time with the ap\npearance of a witness whose testimony defense counsel\ndoes not intend to rebut in any fashion.13 The amicus brief\n——————\n  12 As the dissent notes, post, at 27, some state statutes, “requir[e]\ndefense counsel to subpoena the analyst, to show good cause for de\nmanding the analyst’s presence, or even to affirm under oath an intent\nto cross-examine the analyst.” We have no occasion today to pass on\nthe constitutionality of every variety of statute commonly given the\nnotice-and-demand label. It suffices to say that what we have referred\nto as the “simplest form [of] notice-and-demand statutes,” supra, at 21,\nis constitutional; that such provisions are in place in a number of\nStates; and that in those States, and in other States that require\nconfrontation without notice-and-demand, there is no indication that\nthe dire consequences predicted by the dissent have materialized.\n  13 Contrary to the dissent’s suggestion, post, at 24–25, we do not cast\n\naspersions on trial judges, who we trust will not be antagonized by\ngood-faith requests for analysts’ appearance at trial. Nor do we expect\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

Washington, 541 U. S. 36. The\nSixth Amendment does not permit the prosecution to\nprove its case via ex parte out-of-court affidavits, and the\nadmission of such evidence against Melendez-Diaz was\nerror.14 We therefore reverse the judgment of the Appeals\nCourt of Massachusetts and remand the case for further\nproceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                      It is so ordered.\n——————\ndefense attorneys to refrain from zealous representation of their clients.\nWe simply do not expect defense attorneys to believe that their clients’\ninterests (or their own) are furthered by objections to analysts’ reports\nwhose conclusions counsel have no intention of challenging.\n   14 We of course express no view as to whether the error was harmless.\n\nThe Massachusetts Court of Appeals did not reach that question and\nwe decline to address it in the first instance. Cf. Coy v. Iowa, 487 U. S.\n1012, 1021–1022 (1988). In connection with that determination,\nhowever, we disagree with the dissent’s contention, post, at 25, that\n“only an analyst’s testimony suffices to prove [the] fact” that “the\nsubstance is cocaine.” Today’s opinion, while insisting upon retention\nof the confrontation requirement, in no way alters the type of evidence\n(including circumstantial evidence) sufficient to sustain a conviction.\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

Until today, scientific\nanalysis could be introduced into evidence without testi­\nmony from the “analyst” who produced it. This rule has\nbeen established for at least 90 years. It extends across at\nleast 35 States and six Federal Courts of Appeals. Yet the\nCourt undoes it based on two recent opinions that say\nnothing about forensic analysts: Crawford v. Washington,\n541 U. S. 36 (2004), and Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S.\n813 (2006).\n  It is remarkable that the Court so confidently disregards\na century of jurisprudence. We learn now that we have\nmisinterpreted the Confrontation Clause—hardly an\narcane or seldom-used provision of the Constitution—for\nthe first 218 years of its existence. The immediate sys­\ntemic concern is that the Court makes no attempt to ac­\nknowledge the real differences between laboratory ana­\nlysts who perform scientific tests and other, more\nconventional witnesses—“witnesses” being the word the\n2           MELENDEZ-DIAZ v. MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nFramers used in the Confrontation Clause.\n   Crawford and Davis dealt with ordinary witnesses—\nwomen who had seen, and in two cases been the victim of,\nthe crime in question. Those cases stand for the proposi­\ntion that formal statements made by a conventional wit­\nness—one who has personal knowledge of some aspect of\nthe defendant’s guilt—may not be admitted without the\nwitness appearing at trial to meet the accused face to face.\nBut Crawford and Davis do not say—indeed, could not\nhave said, because the facts were not before the Court—\nthat anyone who makes a testimonial statement is a wit­\nness for purposes of the Confrontation Clause, even when\nthat person has, in fact, witnessed nothing to give them\npersonal knowledge of the defendant’s guilt.\n   Because Crawford and Davis concerned typical wit­\nnesses, the Court should have done the sensible thing and\nlimited its holding to witnesses as so defined. Indeed, as\nJUSTICE THOMAS warned in his opinion in Davis, the\nCourt’s approach has become “disconnected from history\nand unnecessary to prevent abuse.” 547 U. S., at 838.\nThe Court’s reliance on the word “testimonial” is of little\nhelp, of course, for that word does not appear in the text of\nthe Clause.\n   The Court dictates to the States, as a matter of constitu­\ntional law, an as-yet-undefined set of rules governing what\nkinds of evidence may be admitted without in-court testi­\nmony. Indeed, under today’s opinion the States bear an\neven more onerous burden than they did before Crawford.\nThen, the States at least had the guidance of the hearsay\nrule and could rest assured that “where the evidence f[ell]\nwithin a firmly rooted hearsay exception,” the Confronta­\ntion Clause did not bar its admission. Ohio v. Roberts, 448\nU. S. 56, 66 (1980) (overruled by Crawford). Now, without\nguidance from any established body of law, the States can\nonly guess what future rules this Court will distill from\nthe sparse constitutional text. See, e.g., Méndez, Craw\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          3\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nford v. Washington: A Critique, 57 Stan. L. Rev. 569, 586–\n593 (2004) (discussing unanswered questions regarding\ntestimonial statements).\n  The Court’s opinion suggests this will be a body of for­\nmalistic and wooden rules, divorced from precedent, com­\nmon sense, and the underlying purpose of the Clause. Its\nruling has vast potential to disrupt criminal procedures\nthat already give ample protections against the misuse of\nscientific evidence. For these reasons, as more fully ex­\nplained below, the Court’s opinion elicits my respectful\ndissent.\n                             I\n                             A\n                             1\n   The Court says that, before the results of a scientific\ntest may be introduced into evidence, the defendant has\nthe right to confront the “analyst.” Ante, at 4–5. One\nmust assume that this term, though it appears nowhere in\nthe Confrontation Clause, nevertheless has some constitu­\ntional substance that now must be elaborated in future\ncases. There is no accepted definition of analyst, and\nthere is no established precedent to define that term.\n   Consider how many people play a role in a routine test\nfor the presence of illegal drugs. One person prepares a\nsample of the drug, places it in a testing machine, and\nretrieves the machine’s printout—often, a graph showing\nthe frequencies of radiation absorbed by the sample or the\nmasses of the sample’s molecular fragments. See 2 P.\nGiannelli & E. Imwinkelried, Scientific Evidence §23.03\n(4th ed. 2007) (describing common methods of identifying\ndrugs, including infrared spectrophotometry, nuclear\nmagnetic resonance, gas chromatography, and mass spec­\ntrometry). A second person interprets the graph the ma­\nchine prints out—perhaps by comparing that printout\nwith published, standardized graphs of known drugs.\n4           MELENDEZ-DIAZ v. MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nIbid. Meanwhile, a third person—perhaps an independent\ncontractor—has calibrated the machine and, having done\nso, has certified that the machine is in good working order.\nFinally, a fourth person—perhaps the laboratory’s direc­\ntor—certifies that his subordinates followed established\nprocedures.\n   It is not at all evident which of these four persons is the\nanalyst to be confronted under the rule the Court an­\nnounces today. If all are witnesses who must appear for\nin-court confrontation, then the Court has, for all practical\npurposes, forbidden the use of scientific tests in criminal\ntrials. As discussed further below, requiring even one of\nthese individuals to testify threatens to disrupt if not end\nmany prosecutions where guilt is clear but a newly found\nformalism now holds sway. See Part I–C, infra.\n   It is possible to read the Court’s opinion, however, to say\nthat all four must testify. Each one has contributed to the\ntest’s result and has, at least in some respects, made a\nrepresentation about the test. Person One represents that\na pure sample, properly drawn, entered the machine and\nproduced a particular printout. Person Two represents\nthat the printout corresponds to a known drug. Person\nThree represents that the machine was properly cali­\nbrated at the time. Person Four represents that all the\nothers performed their jobs in accord with established\nprocedures.\n   And each of the four has power to introduce error. A\nlaboratory technician might adulterate the sample. The\nindependent contractor might botch the machine’s calibra­\ntion. And so forth. The reasons for these errors may\nrange from animus against the particular suspect or all\ncriminal suspects to unintentional oversight; from gross\nnegligence to good-faith mistake. It is no surprise that a\nplausible case can be made for deeming each person in the\ntesting process an analyst under the Court’s opinion.\n   Consider the independent contractor who has calibrated\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nthe testing machine. At least in a routine case, where the\nmachine’s result appears unmistakable, that result’s\naccuracy depends entirely on the machine’s calibration.\nThe calibration, in turn, can be proved only by the contrac­\ntor’s certification that he or she did the job properly. That\ncertification appears to be a testimonial statement under\nthe Court’s definition: It is a formal, out-of-court state­\nment, offered for the truth of the matter asserted, and\nmade for the purpose of later prosecution. See ante, at 3–\n5. It is not clear, under the Court’s ruling, why the inde­\npendent contractor is not also an analyst.\n   Consider the person who interprets the machine’s print­\nout. His or her interpretation may call for the exercise of\nprofessional judgment in close cases. See Giannelli &\nImwinkelried, supra. If we assume no person deliberately\nintroduces error, this interpretive step is the one most\nlikely to permit human error to affect the test’s result.\nThis exercise of judgment might make this participant an\nanalyst. The Court implies as much. See ante, at 12–14.\n   And we must yet consider the laboratory director who\ncertifies the ultimate results. The director is arguably the\nmost effective person to confront for revealing any ambigu­\nity in findings, variations in procedures, or problems in\nthe office, as he or she is most familiar with the standard\nprocedures, the office’s variations, and problems in prior\ncases or with particular analysts. The prosecution may\nseek to introduce his or her certification into evidence.\nThe Court implies that only those statements that are\nactually entered into evidence require confrontation. See\nante, at 4–5. This could mean that the director is also an\nanalyst, even if his or her certification relies upon or re­\nstates work performed by subordinates.\n   The Court offers no principles or historical precedent to\ndetermine which of these persons is the analyst. All con­\ntribute to the test result. And each is equally remote from\nthe scene, has no personal stake in the outcome, does not\n6           MELENDEZ-DIAZ v. MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\neven know the accused, and is concerned only with the\nperformance of his or her role in conducting the test.\n   It could be argued that the only analyst who must tes­\ntify is the person who signed the certificate. Under this\nview, a laboratory could have one employee sign certifi­\ncates and appear in court, which would spare all the other\nanalysts this burden. But the Court has already rejected\nthis arrangement. The Court made clear in Davis that it\nwill not permit the testimonial statement of one witness to\nenter into evidence through the in-court testimony of a\nsecond:\n    “[W]e do not think it conceivable that the protections\n    of the Confrontation Clause can readily be evaded by\n    having a note-taking policeman [here, the laboratory\n    employee who signs the certificate] recite the unsworn\n    hearsay testimony of the declarant [here, the analyst\n    who performs the actual test], instead of having the\n    declarant sign a deposition. Indeed, if there is one\n    point for which no case—English or early American,\n    state or federal—can be cited, that is it.” 547 U. S., at\n    826.\nUnder this logic, the Court’s holding cannot be cabined to\nthe person who signs the certificates. If the signatory is\nrestating the testimonial statements of the true analysts—\nwhoever they might be—then those analysts, too, must\ntestify in person.\n   Today’s decision demonstrates that even in the narrow\ncategory of scientific tests that identify a drug, the Court\ncannot define with any clarity who the analyst is. Outside\nthis narrow category, the range of other scientific tests\nthat may be affected by the Court’s new confrontation\nright is staggering. See, e.g., Comment, Toward a Defini­\ntion of “Testimonial”: How Autopsy Reports Do Not Em­\nbody the Qualities of a Testimonial Statement, 96 Cal. L.\nRev. 1093, 1094, 1115 (2008) (noting that every court post­\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

Consider just\ntwo—establishing the chain of custody and authenticating\na copy of a document.\n   It is the obligation of the prosecution to establish the\nchain of custody for evidence sent to testing laboratories—\nthat is, to establish “the identity and integrity of physical\nevidence by tracing its continuous whereabouts.” 23\nC. J. S., Criminal Law §1142, p. 66 (2008). Meeting this\nobligation requires representations—that one officer re­\ntrieved the evidence from the crime scene, that a second\nofficer checked it into an evidence locker, that a third\nofficer verified the locker’s seal was intact, and so forth.\nThe iron logic of which the Court is so enamored would\nseem to require in-court testimony from each human link\nin the chain of custody. That, of course, has never been\nthe law. See, e.g., United States v. Lott, 854 F. 2d 244, 250\n(CA7 1988) (“[G]aps in the chain [of custody] normally go\nto the weight of the evidence rather than its admissibil­\nity”); 29A Am. Jur. 2d, Evidence §962, p. 269 (2009) (“The\nfact that one of the persons in control of a fungible sub­\nstance does not testify at trial does not, without more,\nmake the substance or testimony relating to it inadmissi­\nble”); C. J. S., supra, §1142, at 67 (“It is generally not\nnecessary that every witness who handled the evidence\ntestify”).\n   It is no answer for the Court to say that “[i]t is up to the\nprosecution to decide what steps in the chain of custody\nare so crucial as to require evidence.” Ante, at 5, n. 1. The\ncase itself determines which links in the chain are cru­\ncial—not the prosecution. In any number of cases, the\n8            MELENDEZ-DIAZ v. MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ncrucial link in the chain will not be available to testify\nand so the evidence will be excluded for lack of a proper\nfoundation.\n   Consider another context in which the Court’s holding\nmay cause disruption: The long-accepted practice of au­\nthenticating copies of documents by means of a certificate\nfrom the document’s custodian stating that the copy is\naccurate. See, e.g., Fed. Rule Evid. 902(4) (in order to be\nself-authenticating, a copy of a public record must be\n“certified as correct by the custodian”); Rule 902(11) (busi­\nness record must be “accompanied by a written declaration\nof its custodian”). Under one possible reading of the\nCourt’s opinion, recordkeepers will be required to testify.\nSo far, courts have not read Crawford and Davis to impose\nthis largely meaningless requirement. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Adefehinti, 510 F. 3d 319, 327–328 (CADC 2008)\n(certificates authenticating bank records may be admitted\nwithout confrontation); United States v. Ellis, 460 F. 3d\n920, 927 (CA7 2006) (certificate authenticating hospital\nrecords). But the breadth of the Court’s ruling today, and\nits undefined scope, may well be such that these courts\nnow must be deemed to have erred. The risk of that con­\nsequence ought to tell us that something is very wrong\nwith the Court’s analysis.\n   Because the Court is driven by nothing more than a\nwooden application of the Crawford and Davis definition\nof “testimonial,” divorced from any guidance from history,\nprecedent, or common sense, there is no way to predict the\nfuture applications of today’s holding. Surely part of the\njustification for the Court’s formalism must lie in its pre­\ndictability. There is nothing predictable here, however,\nother than the uncertainty and disruption that now must\nensue.\n                            B\n    With no precedent to guide us, let us assume that the\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nCourt’s analyst is the person who interprets the machine’s\nprintout. This result makes no sense. The Confrontation\nClause is not designed, and does not serve, to detect errors\nin scientific tests. That should instead be done by con­\nducting a new test. Or, if a new test is impossible, the\ndefendant may call his own expert to explain to the jury\nthe test’s flaws and the dangers of relying on it. And if, in\nan extraordinary case, the particular analyst’s testimony\nis necessary to the defense, then, of course, the defendant\nmay subpoena the analyst. The Court frets that the de­\nfendant may be unable to do so “when the [analyst] is\nunavailable or simply refuses to appear.” Ante, at 19. But\nlaboratory analysts are not difficult to locate or to compel.\nAs discussed below, analysts already devote considerable\ntime to appearing in court when subpoenaed to do so. See\nPart I–C, infra; see also Brief for State of Alabama et al.\nas Amici Curiae 26–28. Neither the Court, petitioner, nor\namici offer any reason to believe that defendants have\ntrouble subpoenaing analysts in cases where the analysts’\nin-court testimony is necessary.\n   The facts of this case illustrate the formalistic and\npointless nature of the Court’s reading of the Clause.\nPetitioner knew, well in advance of trial, that the Com­\nmonwealth would introduce the tests against him. The\nbags of cocaine were in court, available for him to test, and\nentered into evidence. Yet petitioner made no effort,\nbefore or during trial, to mount a defense against the\nanalysts’ results. Petitioner could have challenged the\ntests’ reliability by seeking discovery concerning the test­\ning methods used or the qualifications of the laboratory\nanalysts. See Mass. Rule Crim. Proc. 14(a)(2) (2009). He\ndid not do so. Petitioner could have sought to conduct his\nown test. See Rule 41. Again, he did not seek a test;\nindeed, he did not argue that the drug was not cocaine.\nRather than dispute the authenticity of the samples tested\nor the accuracy of the tests performed, petitioner argued to\n10          MELENDEZ-DIAZ v. MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nthe jury that the prosecution had not shown that he had\npossessed or dealt in the drugs.\n   Despite not having prepared a defense to the analysts’\nresults, petitioner’s counsel made what can only be de­\nscribed as a pro forma objection to admitting the results\nwithout in-court testimony, presumably from one particu­\nlar analyst. Today the Court, by deciding that this objec­\ntion should have been sustained, transforms the Confron­\ntation Clause from a sensible procedural protection into a\ndistortion of the criminal justice system.\n   It is difficult to perceive how the Court’s holding will\nadvance the purposes of the Confrontation Clause. One\npurpose of confrontation is to impress upon witnesses the\ngravity of their conduct. See Coy v. Iowa, 487 U. S. 1012,\n1019–1020 (1988). A witness, when brought to face the\nperson his or her words condemn, might refine, reformu­\nlate, reconsider, or even recant earlier statements. See\nibid. A further purpose is to alleviate the danger of one­\nsided interrogations by adversarial government officials\nwho might distort a witness’s testimony. The Clause\nguards against this danger by bringing the interrogation\ninto the more neutral and public forum of the courtroom.\nSee Maryland v. Craig, 497 U. S. 836, 869–870 (1990)\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting) (discussing the “value of the con­\nfrontation right in guarding against a child’s distorted or\ncoerced recollections”); see also 96 Cal. L. Rev., supra, at\n1120–1122 (“During private law-enforcement questioning,\npolice officers or prosecutors can exert pressure on the\nwitness without a high risk of being discovered. Court­\nroom questioning, in contrast, is public and performed in\nfront of the jury, judge and defendant. Pressure is there­\nfore harder to exert in court”).\n   But neither purpose is served by the rule the Court\nannounces today. It is not plausible that a laboratory\nanalyst will retract his or her prior conclusion upon catch­\ning sight of the defendant the result condemns. After all,\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

And an analyst performs hundreds if not\nthousands of tests each year and will not remember a\nparticular test or the link it had to the defendant.\n   This is not to say that analysts are infallible. They are\nnot. It may well be that if the State does not introduce the\nmachine printout or the raw results of a laboratory analy­\nsis; if it does not call an expert to interpret a test, particu­\nlarly if that test is complex or little known; if it does not\nestablish the chain of custody and the reliability of the\nlaboratory; then the State will have failed to meet its\nburden of proof. That result follows because the State\nmust prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, without\nrelying on presumptions, unreliable hearsay, and the like.\nSee United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U. S.\n422, 446 (1978) (refusing to permit a “ ‘conclusive pre­\nsumption [of intent],’ ” which “ ‘would effectively eliminate\nintent as an ingredient of the offense’ ” (quoting Morissette\nv. United States, 342 U. S. 246, 274–275 (1952)). The\nState must permit the defendant to challenge the analyst’s\nresult. See Holmes v. South Carolina, 547 U. S. 319, 331\n(2006) (affirming the defendant’s right to “have a mean­\ningful opportunity to present a complete defense” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). The rules of evidence, includ­\ning those governing reliability under hearsay principles\nand the latitude to be given expert witnesses; the rules\nagainst irrebutable presumptions; and the overriding\nprinciple that the prosecution must make its case beyond\na reasonable doubt—all these are part of the protections\nfor the accused. The States, however, have some latitude\nin determining how these rules should be defined.\n   The Confrontation Clause addresses who must testify.\nIt simply does not follow, however, that this clause, in lieu\nof the other rules set forth above, controls who the prose­\ncution must call on every issue. Suppose, for instance,\n12          MELENDEZ-DIAZ v. MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nthat the defense challenges the procedures for a secure\nchain of custody for evidence sent to a lab and then re­\nturned to the police. The defense has the right to call its\nown witnesses to show that the chain of custody is not\nsecure. But that does not mean it can demand that, in the\nprosecution’s case in chief, each person who is in the chain\nof custody—and who had an undoubted opportunity to\ntaint or tamper with the evidence—must be called by the\nprosecution under the Confrontation Clause. And the\nsame is true with lab technicians.\n  The Confrontation Clause is simply not needed for these\nmatters. Where, as here, the defendant does not even\ndispute the accuracy of the analyst’s work, confrontation\nadds nothing.\n                              C\n  For the sake of these negligible benefits, the Court\nthreatens to disrupt forensic investigations across the\ncountry and to put prosecutions nationwide at risk of\ndismissal based on erratic, all-too-frequent instances when\na particular laboratory technician, now invested by the\nCourt’s new constitutional designation as the analyst,\nsimply does not or cannot appear.\n  Consider first the costs today’s decision imposes on\ncriminal trials. Our own Court enjoys weeks, often\nmonths, of notice before cases are argued. We receive\nbriefs well in advance. The argument itself is ordered. A\nbusy trial court, by contrast, must consider not only attor­\nneys’ schedules but also those of witnesses and juries.\nTrial courts have huge caseloads to be processed within\nstrict time limits. Some cases may unexpectedly plead out\nat the last minute; others, just as unexpectedly, may not.\nSome juries stay out longer than predicted; others must be\nreconstituted. An analyst cannot hope to be the trial\ncourt’s top priority in scheduling. The analyst must in­\nstead face the prospect of waiting for days in a hallway\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           13\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\noutside the courtroom before being called to offer testi­\nmony that will consist of little more than a rote recital of\nthe written report. See Part I–B, supra.\n   As matters stood before today’s opinion, analysts al­\nready spent considerable time appearing as witnesses in\nthose few cases where the defendant, unlike petitioner in\nthis case, contested the analyst’s result and subpoenaed\nthe analyst. See Brief for Alabama et al. as Amici Curiae\n26–28 (testifying takes time); ante, at 23 (before today’s\nopinion, it was “ ‘almost always the case that analysts’\ncertificates [we]re admitted without objection’ ” in Massa­\nchusetts courts). By requiring analysts also to appear in\nthe far greater number of cases where defendants do not\ndispute the analyst’s result, the Court imposes enormous\ncosts on the administration of justice.\n  Setting aside, for a moment, all the other crimes for\nwhich scientific evidence is required, consider the costs the\nCourt’s ruling will impose on state drug prosecutions\nalone. In 2004, the most recent year for which data are\navailable, drug possession and trafficking resulted in\n362,850 felony convictions in state courts across the coun­\ntry. See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, M.\nDurose & P. Langan, Felony Sentences in State Courts\n2004, p. 2 (July 2007). Roughly 95% of those convictions\nwere products of plea bargains, see id., at 1, which means\nthat state courts saw more than 18,000 drug trials in a\nsingle year.\n   The analysts responsible for testing the drugs at issue\nin those cases now bear a crushing burden. For example,\nthe district attorney in Philadelphia prosecuted 25,000\ndrug crimes in 2007. Brief for National Dist. Attorneys\nAssociation et al. as Amici Curiae 12–13. Assuming that\nnumber remains the same, and assuming that 95% of the\ncases end in a plea bargain, each of the city’s 18 drug\nanalysts, ibid., will be required to testify in more than 69\ntrials next year. Cleveland’s district attorney prosecuted\n14          MELENDEZ-DIAZ v. MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n14,000 drug crimes in 2007. Ibid. Assuming that number\nholds, and that 95% of the cases end in a plea bargain,\neach of the city’s 6 drug analysts (two of whom work only\npart time) must testify in 117 drug cases next year. Id., at\n13.\n   The Federal Government may face even graver difficul­\nties than the States because its operations are so wide­\nspread. For example, the FBI laboratory at Quantico,\nVirginia, supports federal, state, and local investigations\nacross the country. Its 500 employees conduct over one\nmillion scientific tests each year. Dept. of Justice, FBI\nLaboratory 2007, Message from the FBI Laboratory Direc­\ntor, http://www.fbi.gov/hq/lab/lab2007/labannual07.pdf (as\nvisited June 22, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court’s\ncase file). The Court’s decision means that before any of\nthose million tests reaches a jury, at least one of the labo­\nratory’s analysts must board a plane, find his or her way\nto an unfamiliar courthouse, and sit there waiting to read\naloud notes made months ago.\n   The Court purchases its meddling with the Confronta­\ntion Clause at a dear price, a price not measured in tax­\npayer dollars alone. Guilty defendants will go free, on the\nmost technical grounds, as a direct result of today’s deci­\nsion, adding nothing to the truth-finding process. The\nanalyst will not always make it to the courthouse in time.\nHe or she may be ill; may be out of the country; may be\nunable to travel because of inclement weather; or may at\nthat very moment be waiting outside some other court­\nroom for another defendant to exercise the right the Court\ninvents today. If for any reason the analyst cannot make\nit to the courthouse in time, then, the Court holds, the jury\ncannot learn of the analyst’s findings (unless, by some\nunlikely turn of events, the defendant previously cross­\nexamined the analyst). Ante, at 3. The result, in many\ncases, will be that the prosecution cannot meet its burden\nof proof, and the guilty defendant goes free on a technical­\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

But the Constitution does not.\n  The Court’s fundamental mistake is to read the Con­\nfrontation Clause as referring to a kind of out-of-court\nstatement—namely, a testimonial statement—that must\nbe excluded from evidence. The Clause does not refer to\nkinds of statements. Nor does the Clause contain the\nword “testimonial.” The text, instead, refers to kinds of\npersons, namely, to “witnesses against” the defendant.\nLaboratory analysts are not “witnesses against” the de­\nfendant as those words would have been understood at the\nframing. There is simply no authority for this proposition.\n  Instead, the Clause refers to a conventional “witness”—\nmeaning one who witnesses (that is, perceives) an event\nthat gives him or her personal knowledge of some aspect of\nthe defendant’s guilt. Both Crawford and Davis concerned\njust this kind of ordinary witness—and nothing in the\nConfrontation Clause’s text, history, or precedent justifies\nthe Court’s decision to expand those cases.\n                             A\n  The Clause states: “In all criminal prosecutions, the\naccused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the\nwitnesses against him.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 6. Though\nthere is “virtually no evidence of what the drafters of the\nConfrontation Clause intended it to mean,” White v. Illi\n16          MELENDEZ-DIAZ v. MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nnois, 502 U. S. 346, 359 (1992) (THOMAS, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment), it is certain the Fram­\ners did not contemplate that an analyst who conducts a\nscientific test far removed from the crime would be consid­\nered a “witnes[s] against” the defendant.\n   The Framers were concerned with a typical witness—\none who perceived an event that gave rise to a personal\nbelief in some aspect of the defendant’s guilt. There is no\nevidence that the Framers understood the Clause to ex­\ntend to unconventional witnesses. As discussed below,\nthere is significant evidence to the contrary. See Part II–\nB, infra. In these circumstances, the historical evidence in\nsupport of the Court’s position is “ ‘too meager . . . to form\na solid basis in history, preceding and contemporaneous\nwith the framing of the Constitution.’ ” Boumediene v.\nBush, 553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 22) (quoting\nReid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 64 (1957) (Frankfurter, J.,\nconcurring in result)). The Court goes dangerously wrong\nwhen it bases its constitutional interpretation upon his­\ntorical guesswork.\n   The infamous treason trial of Sir Walter Raleigh pro­\nvides excellent examples of the kinds of witnesses to whom\nthe Confrontation Clause refers. Raleigh’s Case, 2 How.\nSt. Tr. 1 (1603); see Crawford, 541 U. S., at 44–45 (Ra­\nleigh’s trial informs our understanding of the Clause\nbecause it was, at the time of the framing, one of the “most\nnotorious instances” of the abuse of witnesses’ out-of-court\nstatements); ante, at 9 (same). Raleigh’s accusers claimed\nto have heard Raleigh speak treason, so they were wit­\nnesses in the conventional sense. We should limit the\nConfrontation Clause to witnesses like those in Raleigh’s\ntrial.\n   The Court today expands the Clause to include labora­\ntory analysts, but analysts differ from ordinary witnesses\nin at least three significant ways. First, a conventional\nwitness recalls events observed in the past, while an\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           17\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nanalyst’s report contains near-contemporaneous observa­\ntions of the test. An observation recorded at the time it is\nmade is unlike the usual act of testifying. A typical wit­\nness must recall a previous event that he or she perceived\njust once, and thus may have misperceived or misremem­\nbered. But an analyst making a contemporaneous obser­\nvation need not rely on memory; he or she instead reports\nthe observations at the time they are made. We gave this\nconsideration substantial weight in Davis. There, the\n“primary purpose” of the victim’s 911 call was “to enable\npolice assistance to meet an ongoing emergency,” rather\nthan “to establish or prove past events potentially relevant\nto later criminal prosecution.” 547 U. S., at 822, 827. See\nalso People v. Geier, 41 Cal. 4th 555, 605–609, 161 P. 3d\n104, 139–141 (2007). The Court cites no authority for its\nholding that an observation recorded at the time it is\nmade is an act of “witness[ing]” for purposes of the Con­\nfrontation Clause.\n   Second, an analyst observes neither the crime nor any\nhuman action related to it. Often, the analyst does not\nknow the defendant’s identity, much less have personal\nknowledge of an aspect of the defendant’s guilt. The ana­\nlyst’s distance from the crime and the defendant, in both\nspace and time, suggests the analyst is not a witness\nagainst the defendant in the conventional sense.\n   Third, a conventional witness responds to questions\nunder interrogation. See, e.g., Raleigh’s Case, supra, at\n15–20. But laboratory tests are conducted according to\nscientific protocols; they are not dependent upon or con­\ntrolled by interrogation of any sort. Put differently, out-of­\ncourt statements should only “require confrontation if they\nare produced by, or with the involvement of, adversarial\ngovernment officials responsible for investigating and\nprosecuting crime.” 96 Cal. L. Rev., at 1118. There is no\nindication that the analysts here—who work for the State\nLaboratory Institute, a division of the Massachusetts\n18          MELENDEZ-DIAZ v. MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nDepartment of Public Health—were adversarial to peti­\ntioner. Nor is there any evidence that adversarial officials\nplayed a role in formulating the analysts’ certificates.\n   Rather than acknowledge that it expands the Confron­\ntation Clause beyond conventional witnesses, the Court\nrelies on our recent opinions in Crawford and Davis. Ante,\nat 3–5. The Court assumes, with little analysis, that\nCrawford and Davis extended the Clause to any person\nwho makes a “testimonial” statement. But the Court’s\nconfident tone cannot disguise the thinness of these two\nreeds. Neither Crawford nor Davis considered whether\nthe Clause extends to persons far removed from the crime\nwho have no connection to the defendant. Instead, those\ncases concerned conventional witnesses. Davis, supra, at\n826–830 (witnesses were victims of defendants’ assaults);\nCrawford, supra, at 38 (witness saw defendant stab\nvictim).\n   It is true that Crawford and Davis employed the term\n“testimonial,” and thereby suggested that any testimonial\nstatement, by any person, no matter how distant from the\ndefendant and the crime, is subject to the Confrontation\nClause. But that suggestion was not part of the holding of\nCrawford or Davis. Those opinions used the adjective\n“testimonial” to avoid the awkward phrasing required by\nreusing the noun “witness.” The Court today transforms\nthat turn of phrase into a new and sweeping legal rule, by\nholding that anyone who makes a formal statement for the\npurpose of later prosecution—no matter how removed\nfrom the crime—must be considered a “witness against”\nthe defendant. Ante, at 3–5. The Court cites no authority\nto justify this expansive new interpretation.\n                           B\n  No historical evidence supports the Court’s conclusion\nthat the Confrontation Clause was understood to extend\nbeyond conventional witnesses to include analysts who\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           19\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nconduct scientific tests far removed from the crime and the\ndefendant. Indeed, what little evidence there is contra­\ndicts this interpretation.\n   Though the Framers had no forensic scientists, they did\nuse another kind of unconventional witness—the copyist.\nA copyist’s work may be as essential to a criminal prosecu­\ntion as the forensic analyst’s. To convict a man of bigamy,\nfor example, the State often requires his marriage records.\nSee, e.g., Williams v. State, 54 Ala. 131, 134, 135 (1875);\nState v. Potter, 52 Vt. 33, 38 (1879). But if the original\nrecords cannot be taken from the archive, the prosecution\nmust rely on copies of those records, made for the purpose\nof introducing the copies into evidence at trial. See ibid.\nIn that case, the copyist’s honesty and diligence are just as\nimportant as the analyst’s here. If the copyist falsifies a\ncopy, or even misspells a name or transposes a date, those\nflaws could lead the jury to convict. Because so much\ndepends on his or her honesty and diligence, the copyist\noften prepares an affidavit certifying that the copy is true\nand accurate.\n   Such a certificate is beyond question a testimonial\nstatement under the Court’s definition: It is a formal out­\nof-court statement offered for the truth of two matters (the\ncopyist’s honesty and the copy’s accuracy), and it is pre­\npared for a criminal prosecution.\n   During the Framers’ era copyists’ affidavits were ac­\ncepted without hesitation by American courts. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Percheman, 7 Pet. 51, 85 (1833) (opinion\nfor the Court by Marshall, C. J.); see also Advisory Com­\nmittee’s Note on Fed. Rule Evid. 902(4), 28 U. S. C. App.,\np. 390 (“The common law . . . recognized the procedure of\nauthenticating copies of public records by certificate”); 5 J.\nWigmore, Evidence §§1677, 1678 (J. Chadbourn rev.\n1974). And courts admitted copyists’ affidavits in criminal\nas well as civil trials. See Williams, supra; Potter, supra.\nThis demonstrates that the framing generation, in con­\n20          MELENDEZ-DIAZ v. MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ntrast to the Court today, did not consider the Confronta­\ntion Clause to require in-court confrontation of unconven­\ntional authors of testimonial statements.\n   The Court attempts to explain away this historical\nexception to its rule by noting that a copyist’s authority is\n“narrowly circumscribed.” Ante, at 16. But the Court does\nnot explain why that matters, nor, if it does matter, why\nlaboratory analysts’ authority should not also be deemed\n“narrowly circumscribed” so that they, too, may be excused\nfrom testifying. And drawing these fine distinctions can­\nnot be squared with the Court’s avowed allegiance to\nformalism. Determining whether a witness’ authority is\n“narrowly circumscribed” has nothing to do with Craw\nford’s testimonial framework. It instead appears much\ncloser to the pre-Crawford rule of Ohio v. Roberts, under\nwhich a statement could be admitted without testimony if\nit “bears adequate indicia of reliability.” 448 U. S., at 66\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   In keeping with the traditional understanding of the\nConfrontation Clause, this Court in Dowdell v. United\nStates, 221 U. S. 325 (1911), rejected a challenge to the\nuse of certificates, sworn out by a clerk of court, a trial\njudge, and a court reporter, stating that defendants had\nbeen present at trial. Those certificates, like a copyist’s\ncertificate, met every requirement of the Court’s current\ndefinition of “testimonial.” In rejecting the defendants’\nclaim that use of the certificates violated the Confronta­\ntion Clause, the Court in Dowdell explained that the\nofficials who executed the certificates “were not witnesses\nagainst the accused” because they “were not asked to\ntestify to facts concerning [the defendants’] guilt or inno­\ncence.” Id., at 330. Indeed, as recently as Davis, the\nCourt reaffirmed Dowdell. 547 U. S., at 825.\n   By insisting that every author of a testimonial state­\nment appear for confrontation, on pain of excluding the\nstatement from evidence, the Court does violence to the\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           21\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nFramers’ sensible, and limited, conception of the right to\nconfront “witnesses against” the defendant.\n                              C\n   In addition to lacking support in historical practice or in\nthis Court’s precedent, the Court’s decision is also con­\ntrary to authority extending over at least 90 years, 35\nStates, and six Federal Courts of Appeals.\n   Almost 100 years ago three state supreme courts held\nthat their state constitutions did not require analysts to\ntestify in court. In a case much like this one, the Massa­\nchusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld the admission of\na certificate stating that the liquid seized from the defen­\ndant contained alcohol, even though the author of the\ncertificate did not testify. Commonwealth v. Slavski, 245\nMass. 405, 413, 140 N. E. 465, 467 (1923). The highest\ncourts in Connecticut and Virginia reached similar conclu­\nsions under their own constitutions. State v. Torello, 103\nConn. 511, 131 A. 429 (1925); Bracey v. Commonwealth,\n119 Va. 867, 89 S. E. 144 (1916). Just two state courts\nappear to have read a state constitution to require a con­\ntrary result. State v. Clark, 290 Mont. 479, 484–489, 964\nP. 2d 766, 770–772 (1998) (laboratory drug report requires\nconfrontation under Montana’s Constitution, which is\n“[u]nlike its federal counterpart”); State v. Birchfield, 342\nOre. 624, 157 P. 3d 216 (2007), but see id., at 631–632, 157\nP. 3d, at 220 (suggesting that a “typical notice require­\nment” would be lawful).\n   As for the Federal Constitution, before Crawford the\nauthority was stronger still: The Sixth Amendment does\nnot require analysts to testify in court. All Federal Courts\nof Appeals to consider the issue agreed. Sherman v. Scott,\n62 F. 3d 136, 139–142 (CA5 1995); Minner v. Kerby, 30\nF. 3d 1311, 1313–1315 (CA10 1994); United States v.\nBaker, 855 F. 2d 1353, 1359–1360 (CA8 1988); Reardon v.\nManson, 806 F. 2d 39 (CA2 1986); Kay v.

MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n255 F. 2d 476, 480–481 (CA4 1958); see also Manocchio v.\nMoran, 919 F. 2d 770, 777–782 (CA1 1990) (autopsy report\nstating cause of victim’s death). Some 24 state courts, and\nthe Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, were in accord.\nSee Appendix A, infra. (Some cases cited in the appen­\ndixes concern doctors, coroners, and calibrators rather\nthan laboratory analysts, but their reasoning is much the\nsame.) Eleven more state courts upheld burden-shifting\nstatutes that reduce, if not eliminate, the right to confron­\ntation by requiring the defendant to take affirmative steps\nprior to trial to summon the analyst. See ibid. Because\nthese burden-shifting statutes may be invalidated by the\nCourt’s reasoning, these 11 decisions, too, appear contrary\nto today’s opinion. See Part III–B, infra. Most of the\nremaining States, far from endorsing the Court’s view,\nappear not to have addressed the question prior to Craw\nford. Against this weight of authority, the Court proffers\njust two cases from intermediate state courts of appeals.\nAnte, at 6–7.\n  On a practical level, today’s ruling would cause less\ndisruption if the States’ hearsay rules had already re­\nquired analysts to testify. But few States require this. At\nleast sixteen state courts have held that their evidentiary\nrules permit scientific test results, calibration certificates,\nand the observations of medical personnel to enter evi­\ndence without in-court testimony. See Appendix B, infra.\nThe Federal Courts of Appeals have reached the same\nconclusion in applying the federal hearsay rule. United\nStates v. Garnett, 122 F. 3d 1016, 1018–1019 (CA11 1997)\n(per curiam); United States v. Gilbert, 774 F. 2d 962, 965\n(CA9 1985) (per curiam); United States v.

See Appendix B, infra (citing cases from\nthree States overruling or limiting previous precedents\nthat had adopted the Court’s rule as a matter of state\nlaw). It appears that a mere six courts continue to inter­\npret their States’ hearsay laws to require analysts to\ntestify. See ibid. And, of course, where courts have\ngrounded their decisions in state law, rather than the\nConstitution, the legislatures in those States have had,\nuntil now, the power to abrogate the courts’ interpretation\nif the costs were shown to outweigh the benefits. Today\nthe Court strips that authority from the States by carving\nthe minority view into the constitutional text.\n   State legislatures, and not the Members of this Court,\nhave the authority to shape the rules of evidence. The\nCourt therefore errs when it relies in such great measure\non the recent report of the National Academy of Sciences.\nAnte, at 12–14 (discussing National Research Council of\nthe National Academies, Strengthening Forensic Science\nin the United States: A Path Forward (Prepublication\nCopy Feb. 2009)). That report is not directed to this\nCourt, but rather to the elected representatives in Con­\ngress and the state legislatures, who, unlike Members of\nthis Court, have the power and competence to determine\nwhether scientific tests are unreliable and, if so, whether\ntestimony is the proper solution to the problem.\n   The Court rejects the well-established understanding—\nextending across at least 90 years, 35 States and six Fed­\neral Courts of Appeals—that the Constitution does not\nrequire analysts to testify in court before their analysis\nmay be introduced into evidence. The only authority on\nwhich the Court can rely is its own speculation on the\nmeaning of the word “testimonial,” made in two recent\nopinions that said nothing about scientific analysis or\n24           MELENDEZ-DIAZ v. MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                       KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nscientific analysts.\n                             III\n  In an attempt to show that the “sky will not fall after\ntoday’s decision,” ante, at 20, the Court makes three ar­\nguments, none of which withstands scrutiny.\n                              A\n   In an unconvincing effort to play down the threat that\ntoday’s new rule will disrupt or even end criminal prosecu­\ntions, the Court professes a hope that defense counsel will\ndecline to raise what will soon be known as the Melendez-\nDiaz objection. Ante, at 22. The Court bases this expecta­\ntion on its understanding that defense attorneys surren­\nder constitutional rights because the attorneys do not\n“want to antagonize the judge or jury by wasting their\ntime.” Ibid.\n   The Court’s reasoning is troubling on at least two levels.\nFirst, the Court’s speculation rests on the apparent belief\nthat our Nation’s trial judges and jurors are unwilling to\naccept zealous advocacy and that, once “antagonize[d]” by\nit, will punish such advocates with adverse rulings. Ibid.\nThe Court offers no support for this stunning slur on the\nintegrity of the Nation’s courts. It is commonplace for the\ndefense to request, at the conclusion of the prosecution’s\nopening case, a directed verdict of acquittal. If the prose­\ncution has failed to prove an element of the crime—even\nan element that is technical and rather obvious, such as\nmovement of a car in interstate commerce—then the case\nmust be dismissed. Until today one would not have\nthought that judges should be angered at the defense for\nmaking such motions, nor that counsel has some sort of\nobligation to avoid being troublesome when the prosecu­\ntion has not done all the law requires to prove its case.\n   Second, even if the Court were right to expect trial\njudges to feel “antagonize[d]” by Melendez-Diaz objections\nand to then vent their anger by punishing the lawyer in\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          25\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nsome way, there is no authority to support the Court’s\nsuggestion that a lawyer may shirk his or her professional\nduties just to avoid judicial displeasure. There is good\nreason why the Court cites no authority for this sugges­\ntion—it is contrary to what some of us, at least, have long\nunderstood to be defense counsel’s duty to be a zealous\nadvocate for every client. This Court has recognized the\nbedrock principle that a competent criminal defense law­\nyer must put the prosecution to its proof:\n    “[T]he adversarial process protected by the Sixth\n    Amendment requires that the accused have ‘counsel\n    acting in the role of an advocate.’ Anders v. Califor\n    nia, 386 U. S. 738, 743 (1967). The right to the effec­\n    tive assistance of counsel is thus the right of the ac­\n    cused to require the prosecution’s case to survive the\n    crucible of meaningful adversarial testing. When a\n    true adversarial criminal trial has been conducted . . .\n    the kind of testing envisioned by the Sixth Amend­\n    ment has occurred. But if the process loses its charac­\n    ter as a confrontation between adversaries, the consti­\n    tutional guarantee is violated.” United States v.\n    Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 656–657 (1984) (footnotes\n    omitted).\nSee also ABA Model Code of Professional Responsibility,\nCanon 7–1, in ABA Compendium of Professional Respon­\nsibility Rules and Standards (2008) (“The duty of a lawyer,\nboth to his client and to the legal system, is to represent\nhis client zealously within the bounds of the law . . .”\n(footnotes omitted)).\n   The instant case demonstrates how zealous defense\ncounsel will defend their clients. To convict, the prosecu­\ntion must prove the substance is cocaine. Under the\nCourt’s new rule, apparently only an analyst’s testimony\nsuffices to prove that fact. (Of course there will also be a\nlarge universe of other crimes, ranging from homicide to\n26          MELENDEZ-DIAZ v. MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nrobbery, where scientific evidence is necessary to prove an\nelement.) In cases where scientific evidence is necessary\nto prove an element of the crime, the Court’s rule requires\nthe prosecution to call the person identified as the analyst;\nthis requirement has become a new prosecutorial duty\nlinked with proving the State’s case beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. Unless the Court is ashamed of its new rule, it is\ninexplicable that the Court seeks to limit its damage by\nhoping that defense counsel will be derelict in their duty\nto insist that the prosecution prove its case. That is sim­\nply not the way the adversarial system works.\n   In any event, the Court’s hope is sure to prove un­\nfounded. The Court surmises that “[i]t is unlikely that\ndefense counsel will insist on live testimony whose effect\nwill be merely to highlight rather than cast doubt upon\nthe forensic analysis.” Ante, at 22. This optimistic predic­\ntion misunderstands how criminal trials work. If the\ndefense does not plan to challenge the test result, “high­\nlight[ing]” that result through testimony does not harm\nthe defense as the Court supposes. If the analyst cannot\nreach the courtroom in time to testify, however, a\nMelendez-Diaz objection grants the defense a great wind­\nfall: The analyst’s work cannot come into evidence. Given\nthe prospect of such a windfall (which may, in and of itself,\nsecure an acquittal) few zealous advocates will pledge,\nprior to trial, not to raise a Melendez-Diaz objection.\nDefense counsel will accept the risk that the jury may\nhear the analyst’s live testimony, in exchange for the\nchance that the analyst fails to appear and the govern­\nment’s case collapses. And if, as here, the defense is not\nthat the substance was harmless, but instead that the\naccused did not possess it, the testimony of the technician\nis a formalism that does not detract from the defense case.\n   In further support of its unlikely hope, the Court relies\non the Brief for Law Professors as Amici Curiae 7–8,\nwhich reports that nearly 95% of convictions are obtained\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           27\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nvia guilty plea and thus do not require in-court testimony\nfrom laboratory analysts. Ante, at 20. What the Court\ndoes not consider is how its holding will alter these statis­\ntics. The defense bar today gains the formidable power to\nrequire the government to transport the analyst to the\ncourtroom at the time of trial. Zealous counsel will insist\nupon concessions: a plea bargain, or a more lenient sen­\ntence in exchange for relinquishing this remarkable\npower.\n                               B\n    As further reassurance that the “sky will not fall after\ntoday’s decision,” ante, at 20, the Court notes that many\nStates have enacted burden-shifting statutes that require\nthe defendant to assert his Confrontation Clause right\nprior to trial or else “forfeit” it “by silence.” Ibid. The\nCourt implies that by shifting the burden to the defendant\nto take affirmative steps to produce the analyst, these\nstatutes reduce the burden on the prosecution.\n    The Court holds that these burden-shifting statutes are\nvalid because, in the Court’s view, they “shift no burden\nwhatever.” Ante, at 21. While this conclusion is welcome,\nthe premise appears flawed. Even what the Court calls\nthe “simplest form” of burden-shifting statutes do impose\nrequirements on the defendant, who must make a formal\ndemand, with proper service, well before trial. Some\nstatutes impose more requirements, for instance by re­\nquiring defense counsel to subpoena the analyst, to show\ngood cause for demanding the analyst’s presence, or even\nto affirm under oath an intent to cross-examine the ana­\nlyst. See generally Metzger, Cheating the Constitution, 59\nVand. L. Rev. 475, 481–485 (2006). In a future case, the\nCourt may find that some of these more onerous burden­\nshifting statutes violate the Confrontation Clause because\nthey “impos[e] a burden . . . on the defendant to bring\n. . . adverse witnesses into court.” Ante, at 19.\n28           MELENDEZ-DIAZ v. MASSACHUSETTS\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n  The burden-shifting statutes thus provide little reassur­\nance that this case will not impose a meaningless formal­\nism across the board.\n                                C\n   In a further effort to support its assessment that today’s\ndecision will not cause disruption, the Court cites 10 deci­\nsions from States that, the Court asserts, “have already\nadopted the constitutional rule we announce today.” Ante,\nat 20, and n. 11. The Court assures us that “there is no\nevidence that the criminal justice system has ground to a\nhalt in the[se] States.” Ante, at 20.\n   On inspection, the citations prove far less reassuring\nthan promised. Seven were decided by courts that consid­\nered themselves bound by Crawford. These cases thus\noffer no support for the Court’s assertion that the state\njurists independently “adopted” the Court’s interpretation\nas a matter of state law. Quite the contrary, the debate in\nthose seven courts was over just how far this Court in­\ntended Crawford to sweep. See, e.g., State v. Belvin, 986\nSo. 2d 516, 526 (Fla. 2008) (Wells, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part) (“I believe that the majority has\nextended the Crawford and Davis decisions beyond their\nintended reach” (citations omitted)). The Court should\ncorrect these courts’ overbroad reading of Crawford, not\nendorse it. Were the Court to do so, these seven jurisdic­\ntions might well change their position.\n   Moreover, because these seven courts only “adopted” the\nCourt’s position in the wake of Crawford, their decisions\nare all quite recent. These States have not yet been sub­\nject to the widespread, adverse results of the formalism\nthe Court mandates today.\n    The citations also fail to reassure for a different reason.\nFive of the Court’s 10 citations—including all 3 pre-\nCrawford cases—come from States that have reduced the\nconfrontation right.

A fifth State, Mississippi,\nexcuses the prosecution from producing the analyst who\nconducted the test, so long as it produces someone. Com­\npare Barnette v.

Rather than endorse the minority\nview, those cases merely reaffirm the government’s burden\nto prove the authenticity of its evidence and the applicabil­\nity of an exception to the state hearsay rule. See, e.g.,\nState v. Fisher, 178 N. W. 2d 380 (Iowa 1970) (laboratory\ntest of victim’s bodily fluid inadmissible under business­\nrecords exception because the prosecution did not show\nthat it was kept in regular course of business); State v.\nFoster, 198 Kan. 52, 422 P. 2d 964 (1967) (no foundation\nlaid for introduction of blood-alcohol test because the\nprosecution did not show that the test was conducted in\nthe usual course of business); Moon v. State, 300 Md. 354,\n367–371, 478 A. 2d 695, 702–703 (1984) (blood alcohol test\ninadmissible because insufficient foundational evidence\nthat the test was conducted in a reliable manner); cf.\nDavis, 269 N.W. 2d, at 440 (laboratory test of victim’s\nbodily fluid admitted under business-records exception to\nstate hearsay rule); Garlick, 313 Md., at 215, n. 2, 223–\n225, 545 A. 2d, at 30, n. 2, 34 (laboratory test of defen­\ndant’s blood falls within “firmly rooted” hearsay excep­\ntion).\n   Three States once espoused the minority view but ap­\n                 Cite as: 557 U.
