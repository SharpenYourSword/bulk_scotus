Argued January 12, 2009—Decided June 22, 2009*\nIn reviving a closed Alaska gold mine using a “froth flotation” tech\n  nique, petitioner Coeur Alaska, Inc., plans to dispose of the resulting\n  waste material, a rock and water mixture called “slurry,” by pumping\n  it into a nearby lake and then discharging purified lake water into a\n  downstream creek. The Clean Water Act (CWA), inter alia, classifies\n  crushed rock as a “pollutant,” §352(6); forbids its discharge “[e]xcept\n  as in compliance” with the Act, §301(a); empowers the Army Corps of\n  Engineers (Corps) to “issue permits . . . for the discharge of . . . fill\n  material,” §404(a); and authorizes the Environmental Protection\n  Agency (EPA) to “issue a permit for the discharge of any pollutant,”\n  “[e]xcept as provided in [§404],” §402(a). The Corps and the EPA to\n  gether define “fill material” as any “material [that] has the effect of\n  . . . [c]hanging the bottom elevation” of water, including “slurry . . . or\n  similar mining-related materials.” 40 CFR §232.2. Coeur Alaska ob\n  tained a §404 permit for the slurry discharge from the Corps and a\n  §402 permit for the lake water discharge from the EPA.\n      Respondent environmental groups (collectively, SEACC) sued the\n  Corps and several of its officials under the Administrative Procedure\n  Act, arguing that the CWA §404 permit was not “in accordance with\n  law,” 5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A), because (1) Coeur Alaska should have\n  sought a CWA §402 permit from the EPA instead, just as it did for\n  the lake water discharge; and (2) the slurry discharge would violate\n  the “new source performance standard” the EPA had promulgated\n  under CWA §306(b), forbidding froth-flotation gold mines to dis\n——————\n  * Together with No. 07–990, Alaska v.

SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n                   CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                            Syllabus \n\n\n    charge “process wastewater,” which includes solid wastes, 40 CFR\n    §440.104(b)(1). Coeur Alaska and petitioner Alaska intervened as de\n    fendants. The District Court granted the defendants summary\n    judgment, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the proposed\n    slurry discharge would violate the EPA’s performance standard and\n    §306(e).\nHeld:\n    1. The Corps, not the EPA, has authority to permit the slurry dis\n charge. Pp. 9–13.\n       (a) By specifying that, “[e]xcept as provided in . . . [§404,]” the\n EPA “may . . . issue permit[s] for the discharge of any pollutant,”\n §402(a) forbids the EPA to issue permits for fill materials falling un\n der the Corps’ §404 authority. Even if there were ambiguity on this\n point, it would be resolved by the EPA’s own regulation providing\n that “[d]ischarges of . . . fill material . . . which are regulated under\n section 404” “do not require [EPA §402] permits.” 40 CFR §122.3.\n The agencies have interpreted this regulation to essentially restate\n §402’s text, ibid., and the EPA has confirmed that reading before this\n Court. Because it is not “plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the\n regulation,” the Court accepts the EPA’s interpretation as correct.\n Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461. Thus, the question whether the\n EPA is the proper agency to regulate the slurry discharge depends on\n whether the Corps has authority to do so. If so, the EPA may not\n regulate. Pp. 9–11.\n       (b) Because §404(a) empowers the Corps to “issue permits . . . for\n the discharge of . . . fill material,” and the agencies’ joint regulation\n defines “fill material” to include “slurry . . . or similar mining-related\n materials” having the “effect of . . . [c]hanging the bottom elevation”\n of water, 40 CFR §232.2, the slurry Coeur Alaska wishes to discharge\n into the lake falls well within the Corps’ §404 permitting authority,\n rather than the EPA’s §402 authority. The CWA gives no indication\n that Congress intended to burden industry with the confusing divi\n sion of permitting authority that SEACC’s contrary reading would\n create. Pp. 11–13.\n    2. The Corps acted in accordance with law in issuing the slurry dis\n charge permit to Coeur Alaska. Pp. 13–28.\n       (a) The CWA alone does not resolve these cases. Pp. 14–18.\n         (i) SEACC contends that because the EPA’s performance stan\n dard forbids even minute solid waste discharges, 40 CFR\n §440.104(b)(1), it also forbids Coeur Alaska’s slurry discharge, 30% of\n which is solid waste, into the lake. Thus, says SEACC, the slurry\n discharge is “unlawful” under CWA §306(e), which prohibits “any\n owner . . . of any new source to operate such source in violation of any\n standard of performance applicable to such source.” Pp. 14–16.\n                    Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                       3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n        (ii) Petitioners and the federal agencies counter that CWA\n§404 grants the Corps authority to determine whether to issue a\npermit allowing the slurry discharge without regard to the EPA’s\nnew source performance standard or §306(e)’s prohibition. Pp. 16–18.\n        (iii) The CWA is ambiguous on the question whether §306 ap\nplies to discharges of fill material regulated under §404. On the one\nhand, §306 provides that a discharge that violates an EPA new\nsource performance standard is “unlawful”—without an exception for\nfill material. On the other hand, §404 grants the Corps blanket au\nthority to permit the discharge of fill material—without mentioning\n§306. This tension indicates that Congress has not “directly spoken”\nto the “precise question” at issue. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural\nResources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842. P. 18.\n     (b) Although the agencies’ regulations construing the CWA are\nentitled to deference if they resolve the statutory ambiguity in a rea\nsonable manner, see Chevron, supra, at 842, the regulations bearing\non §§306 and 404, like the CWA itself, do not do so. For example,\neach of the two principal regulations seems to stand on its own with\nout reference to the other. The EPA’s performance standard contains\nno exception for fill material, and it forbids any discharge of “process\nwastewater,” including solid wastes. 40 CFR §440.104(b)(1). The\nagencies’ joint regulation defining fill material includes “slurry or . . .\nsimilar mining-related materials,” §232.2, but contains no exception\nfor slurry regulated by an EPA performance standard. Additional\nregulations noted by the parties offer no basis for reconciliation.\nPp. 18–20.\n     (c) In light of the ambiguities in the CWA and the pertinent regu\nlations, the Court turns to the agencies’ subsequent interpretation of\nthose regulations. Auer, supra, at 461. The question at issue is ad\ndressed and resolved in a reasonable and coherent way by the two\nagencies’ practice and policy, as recited in the EPA’s internal “Regas\nMemorandum” (Memorandum), which explains that the performance\nstandard applies only to the discharge of water from the lake into the\ndownstream creek, and not to the initial discharge of slurry into the\nlake. Though the Memorandum is not subject to sufficiently formal\nprocedures to merit full Chevron deference, the Court defers to it be\ncause it is not “plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regula\ntion[s],” Auer, supra, at 461. Five factors inform that conclusion: The\nMemorandum (1) confines its own scope to closed bodies of water like\nthe lake here, thereby preserving a role for the performance stan\ndards; (2) guards against the possibility of evasion of those standards;\n(3) employs the Corps’ expertise in evaluating the effects of fill mate\nrial on the aquatic environment; (4) does not allow toxic compounds\nto be discharged into navigable waters; and (5) reconciles §§306, 402,\n4           COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n                   CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                            Syllabus \n\n\n    and 404, and the regulations implementing them, better than any of\n    the parties’ alternatives. The Court agrees with the parties that a\n    two-permit regime is contrary to the statute and regulations. Pp. 20–\n    23.\n          (d) The Court rejects SEACC’s contention that the Regas Memo\n    randum is not entitled to deference because it contradicts the agen\n    cies’ published statements and prior practice. Though SEACC cites\n    three such statements, its arguments are not convincing. Pp. 23–28.\n            (i) Although a 1986 memorandum of agreement (MOA) be\n    tween the EPA and the Corps seeking to reconcile their then-differing\n    “fill material” definitions suggests, as SEACC asserts, that §402 will\n    “normally” apply to discharges of “suspended”—i.e., solid—pollutants,\n    that statement is not contrary to the Regas Memorandum, which ac\n    knowledges that the EPA retains authority under §402 to regulate\n    the discharge of suspended solids from the lake into downstream wa\n    ters. The MOA does not address the question presented by these\n    cases, and answered by the Regas Memorandum, and is, in fact, con\n    sistent with the agencies’ determination that the Corps regulates all\n    discharges of fill material and that §306 does not apply to these dis\n    charges. Pp. 23–25.\n            (ii) Despite SEACC’s assertion that the fill regulation’s pream\n    ble demonstrates that the fill rule was not intended to displace the\n    pre-existing froth-flotation gold mine performance standard, the pre\n    amble is consistent with the Regas Memorandum when it explicitly\n    notes that the EPA has “never sought to regulate fill material under\n    effluent guidelines,” 67 Fed. Reg. 31135. If a discharge does not qual\n    ify as fill, the EPA’s new source performance standard applies. If the\n    discharge qualifies as fill, the performance standard does not apply;\n    and there was no earlier agency practice or policy to the contrary.\n    Pp. 25–26.\n            (iii) Remarks made by the two agencies in promulgating the fill\n    regulation, which pledge that the EPA’s “previou[s] . . . determina\n    tion[s]” with regard to the application of performance standards “re\n    main vali[d],” are not conclusive of the question at issue. The Regas\n    Memorandum has followed this policy by applying the performance\n    standard to the discharge of water from the lake into the creek. The\n    remarks do not state that the EPA will apply such standards to dis\n    charges of fill material. Pp. 26–27.\n            (iv) While SEACC cites no instance in which the EPA has ap\n    plied a performance standard to a discharge of fill material, Coeur\n    Alaska cites two instances in which the Corps issued a §404 permit\n    authorizing a mine to discharge solid waste as fill material. These\n    permits illustrate that the agencies did not have a prior practice of\n    applying EPA performance standards to discharges of mining wastes\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

The first is whether\nthe Act gives authority to the United States Army Corps of\nEngineers, or instead to the Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA), to issue a permit for the discharge of min\ning waste, called slurry. The Corps of Engineers has\nissued a permit to petitioner Coeur Alaska, Inc. (Coeur\nAlaska), for a discharge of slurry into a lake in Southeast\nAlaska. The second question is whether, when the Corps\nissued that permit, the agency acted in accordance with\nlaw. We conclude that the Corps was the appropriate\nagency to issue the permit and that the permit is lawful.\n  With regard to the first question, §404(a) of the CWA\n2       COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n               CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\ngrants the Corps the power to “issue permits . . . for the\ndischarge of . . . fill material.” 86 Stat. 884; 33 U. S. C.\n§1344(a). But the EPA also has authority to issue permits\nfor the discharge of pollutants. Section 402 of the Act\ngrants the EPA authority to “issue a permit for the dis\ncharge of any pollutant” “[e]xcept as provided in” §404. 33\nU. S. C. §1342(a). We conclude that because the slurry\nCoeur Alaska wishes to discharge is defined by regulation\nas “fill material,” 40 CFR §232.2 (2008), Coeur Alaska\nproperly obtained its permit from the Corps of Engineers,\nunder §404, rather than from the EPA, under §402.\n   The second question is whether the Corps permit is\nlawful. Three environmental groups, respondents here,\nsued the Corps under the Administrative Procedure Act,\narguing that the issuance of the permit by the Corps was\n“not in accordance with law.” 5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A). The\nenvironmental groups are Southeast Alaska Conservation\nCouncil, Sierra Club, and Lynn Canal Conservation (col\nlectively, SEACC). The State of Alaska and Coeur Alaska\nare petitioners here.\n   SEACC argues that the permit from the Corps is unlaw\nful because the discharge of slurry would violate an EPA\nregulation promulgated under §306(b) of the CWA, 33\nU. S. C. §1316(b). The EPA regulation, which is called a\n“new source performance standard,” forbids mines like\nCoeur Alaska’s from discharging “process wastewater” into\nthe navigable waters. 40 CFR §440.104(b)(1). Coeur\nAlaska, the State of Alaska, and the federal agencies\nmaintain that the Corps permit is lawful nonetheless\nbecause the EPA’s performance standard does not apply to\ndischarges of fill material.\n   Reversing the judgment of the District Court, the Court\nof Appeals held that the EPA’s performance standard\napplies to this discharge so that the permit from the Corps\nis unlawful.\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   Petitioner Coeur Alaska plans to reopen the Kensington\nGold Mine, located some 45 miles north of Juneau, Alaska.\nThe mine has been closed since 1928, but Coeur Alaska\nseeks to make it profitable once more by using a technique\nknown as “froth flotation.” Coeur Alaska will churn the\nmine’s crushed rock in tanks of frothing water. Chemicals\nin the water will cause gold-bearing minerals to float to\nthe surface, where they will be skimmed off.\n   At issue is Coeur Alaska’s plan to dispose of the mixture\nof crushed rock and water left behind in the tanks. This\nmixture is called slurry. Some 30 percent of the slurry’s\nvolume is crushed rock, resembling wet sand, which is\ncalled tailings. The rest is water.\n   The standard way to dispose of slurry is to pump it into\na tailings pond. The slurry separates in the pond. Solid\ntailings sink to the bottom, and water on the surface\nreturns to the mine to be used again.\n   Rather than build a tailings pond, Coeur Alaska pro\nposes to use Lower Slate Lake, located some three miles\nfrom the mine in the Tongass National Forest. This lake\nis small—800 feet at its widest crossing, 2,000 feet at its\nlongest, and 23 acres in area. See App. 138a, 212a.\nThough small, the lake is 51 feet deep at its maximum.\nThe parties agree the lake is a navigable water of the\nUnited States and so is subject to the CWA. They also\nagree there can be no discharge into the lake except as the\nCWA and any lawful permit allow.\n   Over the life of the mine, Coeur Alaska intends to put\n4.5 million tons of tailings in the lake. This will raise the\nlakebed 50 feet—to what is now the lake’s surface—and\nwill increase the lake’s area from 23 to about 60 acres. Id.,\nat 361a (62 acres), 212a (56 acres). To contain this wider,\nshallower body of water, Coeur Alaska will dam the lake’s\ndownstream shore. The transformed lake will be isolated\n4        COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA\n                CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom other surface water. Creeks and stormwater runoff\nwill detour around it. Id., at 298a. Ultimately, lakewater\nwill be cleaned by purification systems and will flow from\nthe lake to a stream and thence onward. Id., at 309a–\n312a.\n                            B\n  Numerous state and federal agencies reviewed and\napproved Coeur Alaska’s plans. At issue here are actions\nby two of those agencies: the Corps of Engineers and the\nEPA.\n                               1\n  The CWA classifies crushed rock as a “pollutant.” 33\nU. S. C. §1362(6). On the one hand, the Act forbids Coeur\nAlaska’s discharge of crushed rock “[e]xcept as in compli\nance” with the Act. CWA §301(a), 33 U. S. C. §1311(a).\nSection 404(a) of the CWA, on the other hand, empowers\nthe Corps to authorize the discharge of “dredged or fill\nmaterial.” 33 U. S. C. §1344(a). The Corps and the EPA\nhave together defined “fill material” to mean any “mate\nrial [that] has the effect of . . . [c]hanging the bottom ele\nvation” of water. 40 CFR §232.2. The agencies have\nfurther defined the “discharge of fill material” to include\n“placement of . . . slurry, or tailings or similar mining\nrelated materials.” Ibid.\n  In these cases the Corps and the EPA agree that the\nslurry meets their regulatory definition of “fill material.”\nOn that premise the Corps evaluated the mine’s plan for a\n§404 permit. After considering the environmental factors\nrequired by §404(b), the Corp issued Coeur Alaska a per\nmit to pump the slurry into Lower Slate Lake. App. 340a–\n378a.\n  In granting the permit the Corps followed the steps set\nforth by §404. Section 404(b) requires the Corps to con\nsider the environmental consequences of every discharge it\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nallows. 33 U. S. C. §1344(b). The Corps must apply guide\nlines written by the EPA pursuant to §404(b). See ibid.;\n40 CFR pt. 230 (EPA guidelines). Applying those guide\nlines here, the Corps determined that Coeur Alaska’s plan\nto use Lower Slate Lake as a tailings pond was the “least\nenvironmentally damaging practicable” way to dispose of\nthe tailings. App. 366a. To conduct that analysis, the\nCorps compared the plan to the proposed alternatives.\n   The Corps determined that the environmental damage\ncaused by placing slurry in the lake will be temporary.\nAnd during that temporary disruption, Coeur Alaska will\ndivert waters around the lake through pipelines built for\nthis purpose. Id., at 298a. Coeur Alaska will also treat\nwater flowing from the lake into downstream waters,\npursuant to strict EPA criteria. Ibid.; see Part I–B–2,\ninfra. Though the slurry will at first destroy the lake’s\nsmall population of common fish, that population may\nlater be replaced. After mining operations are completed,\nCoeur Alaska will help “recla[im]” the lake by “[c]apping”\nthe tailings with about 4 inches of “native material.” App.\n361a; id., at 309a. The Corps concluded that\n    “[t]he reclamation of the lake will result in more\n    emergent wetlands/vegetated shallows with moderate\n    values for fish habitat, nutrient recycling, car\n    bon/detrital export and sediment/toxicant retention,\n    and high values for wildlife habitat.” Id., at 361a.\n   If the tailings did not go into the lake, they would be\nplaced on nearby wetlands. The resulting pile would rise\ntwice as high as the Pentagon and cover three times as\nmany acres. Reply Brief for Petitioner Coeur Alaska 27.\nIf it were chosen, that alternative would destroy dozens of\nacres of wetlands—a permanent loss. App. 365a–366a.\nOn the premise that when the mining ends the lake will\nbe at least as environmentally hospitable, if not more so,\nthan now, the Corps concluded that placing the tailings in\n6        COEUR ALASKA, INC. v.

S. C. §1344(c).\nAfter considering the Corps findings, the EPA did not veto\nthe Corps permit, even though, in its view, placing the\ntailings in the lake was not the “environmentally prefer\nable” means of disposing of them. App. 300a. By declining\nto exercise its veto, the EPA in effect deferred to the judg\nment of the Corps on this point.\n   The EPA’s involvement extended beyond the agency’s\nveto consideration. The EPA also issued a permit of its\nown—not for the discharge from the mine into the lake but\nfor the discharge from the lake into a downstream creek.\nId., at 287a–331a. Section 402 grants the EPA authority\nto “issue a permit for the discharge of any pollutant,”\n“[e]xcept as provided in [CWA §404].”             33 U. S. C.\n§1342(a). The EPA’s §402 permit authorizes Coeur Alaska\nto discharge water from Lower Slate Lake into the down\nstream creek, subject to strict water-quality limits that\nCoeur Alaska must regularly monitor. App. 303a–304a,\n309a.\n   The EPA’s authority to regulate this discharge comes\nfrom a regulation, termed a “new source performance\nstandard,” that it has promulgated under authority\ngranted to it by §306(b) of the CWA. Section 306(b) gives\nthe EPA authority to regulate the amount of pollutants\nthat certain categories of new sources may discharge into\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

Pursuant to this authority, the EPA in 1982\npromulgated a new source performance standard restrict\ning discharges from new froth-flotation gold mines like\nCoeur Alaska’s. The standard is stringent: It allows “no\ndischarge of process wastewater” from these mines. 40\nCFR §440.104(b)(1).\n   Applying that standard to the discharge of water from\nLower Slate Lake into the downstream creek, the EPA’s\n§402 permit sets strict limits on the amount of pollutants\nthe water may contain. The permit requires Coeur Alaska\nto treat the water using “reverse osmosis” to remove alu\nminum, suspended solids, and other pollutants. App.\n298a; id., at 304a. Coeur Alaska must monitor the water\nflowing from the lake to be sure that the pollutants are\nkept to low, specified minimums. Id., at 326a–330a.\n                               C\n  SEACC brought suit against the Corps of Engineers and\nvarious of its officials in the United States District Court\nfor the District of Alaska. The Corps permit was not in\naccordance with law, SEACC argued, for two reasons.\nFirst, in SEACC’s view, the permit was issued by the\nwrong agency—Coeur Alaska ought to have sought a §402\npermit from the EPA, just as the company did for the\ndischarge of water from the lake into the downstream\ncreek. See Part I–B–2, supra. Second, SEACC contended\nthat regardless of which agency issued the permit, the\ndischarge itself is unlawful because it will violate the EPA\nnew source performance standard for froth-flotation gold\nmines. (This is the same performance standard described\nabove, which the EPA has already applied to the discharge\nof water from the lake into the downstream creek. See\nibid.) SEACC argued that this performance standard also\napplies to the discharge of slurry into the lake. It con\ntended further that the performance standard is a binding\n8        COEUR ALASKA, INC. v.

Section 306(e) of the CWA makes\nit “unlawful” for Coeur Alaska to “operate” the mine “in\nviolation of” the EPA’s performance standard. 33 U. S. C.\n§1316(e).\n   Coeur Alaska and the State of Alaska intervened as\ndefendants. Both sides moved for summary judgment.\nThe District Court granted summary judgment in favor of\nthe defendants.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and\nordered the District Court to vacate the Corps of Engi\nneers’ permit. Southeast Alaska Conservation Council v.\nUnited States Army Corps of Engs., 486 F. 3d 638, 654–\n655 (2007). The court acknowledged that Coeur Alaska’s\nslurry “facially meets the Corps’ current regulatory defini\ntion of ‘fill material,’ ” id., at 644, because it would have\nthe effect of raising the lake’s bottom elevation. But the\ncourt also noted that the EPA’s new source performance\nstandard “prohibits discharges from froth-flotation mills.”\nIbid. The Court of Appeals concluded that “[b]oth of the\nregulations appear to apply in this case, yet they are at\nodds.” Ibid. To resolve the conflict, the court turned to\nwhat it viewed as “the plain language of the Clean Water\nAct.” Ibid. The court held that the EPA’s new source\nperformance standard “applies to discharges from the\nfroth-flotation mill at Coeur Alaska’s Kensington Gold\nMine into Lower Slate Lake.” Ibid.\n   In addition to the text of the CWA, the Court of Appeals\nalso relied on the agencies’ statements made when prom\nulgating their current and prior definitions of “fill mate\nrial.” These statements, in the Court of Appeals’ view,\ndemonstrated the agencies’ intent that the EPA’s new\nsource performance standard govern discharges like Coeur\nAlaska’s. Id., at 648–654.\n   The Court of Appeals concluded that Coeur Alaska\nrequired a §402 permit for its slurry discharge, that the\nCorps lacked authority to issue such a permit under §404,\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand that the proposed discharge was unlawful because it\nwould violate the EPA new source performance standard\nand §306(e).\n  The decision of the Court of Appeals in effect reallocated\nthe division of responsibility that the Corps and the EPA\nhad been following. The Court granted certiorari. 554\nU. S. ___ (2008). We now hold that the decision of the\nCourt of Appeals was incorrect.\n                            II\n  The question of which agency has authority to consider\nwhether to permit the slurry discharge is our beginning\ninquiry. We consider first the authority of the EPA and\nsecond the authority of the Corps. Our conclusion is that\nunder the CWA the Corps had authority to determine\nwhether Coeur Alaska was entitled to the permit govern\ning this discharge.\n                           A\n  Section 402 gives the EPA authority to issue “permit[s]\nfor the discharge of any pollutant,” with one important\nexception: The EPA may not issue permits for fill material\nthat fall under the Corps’ §404 permitting authority.\nSection 402(a) states:\n    “Except as provided in . . . [CWA §404, 33 U. S. C.\n    §1344], the Administrator may . . . issue a permit for\n    the discharge of any pollutant, . . . notwithstanding\n    [CWA §301(a), 33 U. S. C. §1311(a)], upon condition\n    that such discharge will meet either (A) all applicable\n    requirements under [CWA §301, 33 U. S. C. §1311(a);\n    CWA §302, 33 U. S. C. §1312; CWA §306, 33 U. S. C.\n    §1316; CWA §307, 33 U. S. C. §1317; CWA §308, 33\n    U. S. C. §1318; CWA §403, 33 U. S. C. §1343], or (B)\n    prior to the taking of necessary implementing actions\n    relating to all such requirements, such conditions as\n    the Administrator determines are necessary to carry\n10       COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n                CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n     out the provisions of this chapter.”       33 U. S. C.\n     §1342(a)(1) (emphasis added).\nSection 402 thus forbids the EPA from exercising permit\nting authority that is “provided [to the Corps] in” §404.\n   This is not to say the EPA has no role with respect to\nthe environmental consequences of fill. The EPA’s func\ntion is different, in regulating fill, from its function in\nregulating other pollutants, but the agency does exercise\nsome authority. Section 404 assigns the EPA two tasks in\nregard to fill material. First, the EPA must write guide\nlines for the Corps to follow in determining whether to\npermit a discharge of fill material. CWA §404(b); 33\nU. S. C. §1344(b). Second, the Act gives the EPA authority\nto “prohibit” any decision by the Corps to issue a permit\nfor a particular disposal site. CWA §404(c); 33 U. S. C.\n§1344(c). We, and the parties, refer to this as the EPA’s\npower to veto a permit.\n   The Act is best understood to provide that if the Corps\nhas authority to issue a permit for a discharge under §404,\nthen the EPA lacks authority to do so under §402.\n   Even if there were ambiguity on this point, the EPA’s\nown regulations would resolve it. Those regulations pro\nvide that “[d]ischarges of dredged or fill material into\nwaters of the United States which are regulated under\nsection 404 of CWA” “do not require [§402] permits” from\nthe EPA. 40 CFR §122.3.\n   In SEACC’s view, this regulation implies that some “fill\nmaterial” discharges are not regulated under §404—else,\nSEACC asks, why would the regulation lack a comma\nbefore the word “which,” and thereby imply that only a\nsubset of “discharges of . . . fill material” are “regulated\nunder section 404.” Ibid.\n   The agencies, however, have interpreted this regulation\notherwise. In the agencies’ view the regulation essentially\nrestates the text of §402, and forbids the EPA from issuing\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npermits for discharges that “are regulated under section\n404.” 40 CFR §122.3(b); cf. CWA §402(a) (“[e]xcept as\nprovided in . . . [§404], the Administrator may . . . issue a\npermit”). Before us, the EPA confirms this reading of the\nregulation. Brief for Federal Respondents 27. The\nagency’s interpretation is not “plainly erroneous or incon\nsistent with the regulation”; and so we accept it as correct.\nAuer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461 (1997) (internal quota\ntion marks omitted).\n   The question whether the EPA is the proper agency to\nregulate the slurry discharge thus depends on whether the\nCorps of Engineers has authority to do so. If the Corps\nhas authority to issue a permit, then the EPA may not do\nso. We turn to the Corps’ authority under §404.\n                               B\n  Section 404(a) gives the Corps power to “issue per\nmits . . . for the discharge of dredged or fill material.” 33\nU. S. C. §1344(a). As all parties concede, the slurry meets\nthe definition of fill material agreed upon by the agencies\nin a joint regulation promulgated in 2002. That regulation\ndefines “fill material” to mean any “material [that] has the\neffect of . . . [c]hanging the bottom elevation” of water—a\ndefinition that includes “slurry, or tailings or similar\nmining-related materials.” 40 CFR §232.2.\n  SEACC concedes that the slurry to be discharged meets\nthe regulation’s definition of fill material. Brief for Re\nspondent SEACC et al. 20. Its concession on this point is\nappropriate because slurry falls well within the central\nunderstanding of the term “fill,” as shown by the examples\ngiven by the regulation. See 40 CFR §232.2 (“Examples of\nsuch fill material include, but are not limited to: rock,\nsand, soil, clay . . . .”). The regulation further excludes\n“trash or garbage” from its definition. Ibid. SEACC ex\npresses a concern that Coeur Alaska’s interpretation of the\nstatute will lead to §404 permits authorizing the dis\n12       COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n                CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\ncharges of other solids that are now restricted by EPA\nstandards. Brief for Respondent SEACC et al. 44–45\n(listing, for example, “feces and uneaten feed,” “ litter, ”\nand waste produced in “battery manufacturing”). But\nthese extreme instances are not presented by the cases\nnow before us. If, in a future case, a discharger of one of\nthese solids were to seek a §404 permit, the dispositive\nquestion for the agencies would be whether the solid at\nissue—for instance, “feces and uneaten feed”—came\nwithin the regulation’s definition of “fill.” SEACC cites no\ninstance in which the agencies have so interpreted their\nfill regulation. If that instance did arise, and the agencies\nwere to interpret the fill regulation as SEACC fears, then\nSEACC could challenge that decision as an unlawful\ninterpretation of the fill regulation; or SEACC could claim\nthat the fill regulation as interpreted is an unreasonable\ninterpretation of §404. The difficulties are not presented\nhere, however, because the slurry meets the regulation’s\ndefinition of fill.\n   Rather than challenge the agencies’ decision to define\nthe slurry as fill, SEACC instead contends that §404\ncontains an implicit exception. According to SEACC, §404\ndoes not authorize the Corps to permit a discharge of fill\nmaterial if that material is subject to an EPA new source\nperformance standard.\n   But §404’s text does not limit its grant of power in this\nway. Instead, §404 refers to all “fill material” without\nqualification.      Nor do the EPA regulations support\nSEACC’s reading of §404. The EPA has enacted guide\nlines, pursuant to §404(b), to guide the Corps permitting\ndecision. 40 CFR pt. 230. Those guidelines do not strip\nthe Corps of power to issue permits for fill in cases where\nthe fill is also subject to an EPA new source performance\nstandard.\n   SEACC’s reading of §404 would create numerous diffi\nculties for the regulated industry. As the regulatory re\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngime stands now, a discharger must ask a simple ques\ntion—is the substance to be discharged fill material or\nnot? The fill regulation, 40 CFR §232.2, offers a clear\nanswer to that question; and under the agencies’ view,\nthat answer decides the matter—if the discharge is fill,\nthe discharger must seek a §404 permit from the Corps; if\nnot, only then must the discharger consider whether any\nEPA performance standard applies, so that the discharger\nrequires a §402 permit from the EPA.\n   Under SEACC’s interpretation, however, the discharger\nwould face a more difficult problem. The discharger would\nhave to ask—is the fill material also subject to one of the\nmany hundreds of EPA performance standards, so that\nthe permit must come from the EPA, not the Corps? The\nstatute gives no indication that Congress intended to\nburden industry with that confusing division of permit\nauthority.\n   The regulatory scheme discloses a defined, and worka\nble, line for determining whether the Corps or the EPA\nhas the permit authority. Under this framework, the\nCorps of Engineers, and not the EPA, has authority to\npermit Coeur Alaska’s discharge of the slurry.\n                            III\n  A second question remains: In issuing the permit did the\nCorps act in violation of a statutory mandate so that the\nissuance was “not in accordance with law”? 5 U. S. C.\n§706(2)(A). SEACC contends that the slurry discharge\nwill violate the EPA’s new source performance standard\nand that the Corps permit is made “unlawful” by CWA\n§306(e). Petitioners and the agencies argue that the per\nmit is lawful because the EPA performance standard, and\n§306(e), do not apply to fill material regulated by the\nCorps. In order to determine whether the Corps permit is\nlawful we must answer the question: Do EPA performance\nstandards, and §306(e), apply to discharges of fill mate\n14      COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n               CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nrial?\n   We address in turn the statutory text of the CWA, the\nagencies’ regulations construing it, and the EPA’s subse\nquent interpretation of those regulations. Because Con\ngress has not “directly spoken” to the “precise question” of\nwhether an EPA performance standard applies to dis\ncharges of fill material, the statute alone does not resolve\nthe case. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources De\nfense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842 (1984). We look\nfirst to the agency regulations, which are entitled to defer\nence if they resolve the ambiguity in a reasonable manner.\nIbid.; see United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 226–\n227 (2001). But the regulations, too, are ambiguous, so we\nnext turn to the agencies’ subsequent interpretation of\nthose regulations. Id., at 234–238; Auer, 519 U. S., at 461.\nIn an internal memorandum the EPA explained that its\nperformance standards do not apply to discharges of fill\nmaterial. That interpretation is not “plainly erroneous or\ninconsistent with the regulation[s],” and so we accept it as\ncorrect. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Though\nSEACC contends that the agencies’ interpretation is not\nentitled to deference because it contradicts the agencies’\npublished statements and prior practice, we disagree with\nSEACC’s reading of those statements and of the regula\ntory record.\n                            A\n  As for the statutory argument, SEACC claims the CWA\n§404 permit is unlawful because §306(e) forbids the slurry\ndischarge. Petitioners and the federal agencies, in con\ntrast, contend that §306(e) does not apply to the slurry\ndischarge.\n                           1\n  To address SEACC’s statutory argument, it is necessary\nto review the EPA’s responsibilities under the CWA. As\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnoted, §306 empowers the EPA to regulate the froth\nflotation gold mining industry. See 33 U. S. C. §1316(b).\nPursuant to this authority, EPA promulgated the new\nsource performance standard relied upon by SEACC. The\nstandard is stringent. If it were to apply here, it would\nallow “no discharge of process wastewater” from the mine.\n40 CFR §440.104(b)(1).\n   The term “process wastewater” includes solid waste. So\nthe regulation forbids not only pollutants that dissolve in\nwater but also solid pollutants suspended in water—what\nthe agency terms “total suspended solids,” or TSS. See\n§440.104(a) (limiting the amount of TSS from other kinds\nof mines); see also EPA Development Document for Efflu\nent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Ore\nMining and Dressing Point Source Category 157–158\n(Nov. 1982) (the amount of TSS in “wastewater” from\nfroth-flotation mines is “generally high”); id., at 175 (Table\nVI–6) (measuring the amounts of TSS in samples of froth\nflotation mines’ discharges); id., at 194 (stating an intent\nto “regulat[e]” TSS); id., at 402 (evaluating the costs of\nconstructing a “settling pond”); id., at 535 (concluding that\neven in mountainous regions, a froth-flotation mine will be\nable to construct a “tailings impoundment” to “provide a\ndisposal area for mill tailings”).\n   Were there any doubt about whether the EPA’s new\nsource performance standard forbade solids as well as\nsoluble pollutants, the agency’s action in these cases\nwould resolve it. Here, the EPA’s §402 permit authorizes\nCoeur Alaska to discharge water from Lower Slate Lake\ninto a downstream creek, provided the water meets the\nquality requirements set by the performance standard.\nThis demonstrates that the performance standard regu\nlates solid waste. The EPA’s permit not only restricts the\namount of total suspended solids, App. 327a (Table 3), but\nalso forbids the mine from allowing any “floating solids” to\nflow from the lake. Id., at 328a. No party disputes the\n16       COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n                CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nEPA’s authority to regulate these discharges of solid min\ning waste; and no party questions the validity of the EPA’s\nnew source performance standard when it is applicable.\n   When the performance standard applies to a point\nsource, §306(e) makes it “unlawful” for that point source to\nviolate it: “[I]t shall be unlawful for any owner or operator\nof any new source to operate such source in violation of\nany standard of performance applicable to such source.”\nCWA §306(e), 33 U. S. C. §1316(e).\n   SEACC argues that this provision, §306(e), forbids the\nmine from discharging slurry into Lower Slate Lake.\nSEACC contends the new source performance standard is,\nin the words of §306(e), “applicable to” the mine. Both the\ntext of the performance standard and the EPA’s applica\ntion of it to the discharge of mining waste from Lower\nSlate Lake demonstrate that the performance standard is\n“applicable to” Coeur Alaska’s mine in some circum\nstances. And so, SEACC reasons, it follows that because\nthe new source performance standard forbids even minute\ndischarges of solid waste, it also forbids the slurry dis\ncharge, 30% of which is solid waste.\n                              2\n  For their part, the State of Alaska and the federal agen\ncies claim that the Act is unambiguous in the opposite\ndirection. They rely on §404 of the Act. As explained\nabove, that section authorizes the Corps of Engineers to\ndetermine whether to issue a permit allowing the dis\ncharge of the slurry. Petitioners and the agencies argue\nthat §404 grants the Corps authority to do so without\nregard to the EPA’s new source performance standard or\nthe §306(e) prohibition discussed above.\n  Petitioners and the agencies make two statutory argu\nments based on §404’s silence in regard to §306. First,\nthey note that nothing in §404 requires the Corps to con\nsider the EPA’s new source performance standard or the\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n§306(e) prohibition. That silence advances the argument\nthat §404’s grant of authority to “issue permits” contra\ndicts §306(e)’s declaration that discharges in violation of\nnew source performance standards are “unlawful.”\n  Second, petitioners and the agencies point to §404(p),\nwhich protects §404 permitees from enforcement actions\nby the EPA or private citizens:\n    “Compliance with a permit issued pursuant to this\n    section . . . shall be deemed compliance, for purposes\n    of sections 1319 [CWA §309] and 1365 [CWA §505] of\n    this title, with sections 1311 [CWA §301], 1317 [CWA\n    §307], and 1343 [CWA §403] of this title.” 33 U. S. C.\n    §1344(p).\nHere again, their argument is that silence is significant.\nSection 404(p) protects the permitee from lawsuits alleg\ning violations of CWA §301 (which bars the discharge of\n“any pollutant” “except as in compliance” with the Act),\n§307 (which bars the discharge of “toxic pollutants”); and\n§403 (which bars discharges into the sea). But §404(p)\ndoes not in express terms protect the permitee from a\nlawsuit alleging a violation of §306(e) or of the EPA’s new\nsource performance standards. Section 404(p)’s silence\nregarding §306 is made even more significant because a\nparallel provision in §402 does protect a §402 permitee\nfrom an enforcement action alleging a violation of §306.\nCWA §402(k), 33 U. S. C. §1342(k).\n   In our view, Congress’ omission of §306 from §404, and\nits inclusion of §306 in §402(k), is evidence that Congress\ndid not intend §306(e) to apply to Corps §404 permits or to\ndischarges of fill material. If §306 did apply, then the\nCorps would be required to evaluate each permit applica\ntion for compliance with §306, and issue a permit only if it\nfound the discharge would comply with §306. But even if\nthat finding were made, it is not clear that the §404 per\nmitee would be protected from a suit seeking a judicial\n18      COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n               CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\ndetermination that the discharge violates §306.\n                               3\n  The CWA is ambiguous on the question whether §306\napplies to discharges of fill material regulated under §404.\nOn the one hand, §306 provides that a discharge that\nviolates an EPA new source performance standard is\n“unlawful”—without any exception for fill material. On\nthe other hand, §404 grants the Corps blanket authority to\npermit the discharge of fill material—without any mention\nof §306. This tension indicates that Congress has not\n“directly spoken” to the “precise question” of whether §306\napplies to discharges of fill material. Chevron, 467 U. S.,\nat 842.\n                             B\n  Before turning to how the agencies have resolved that\nquestion, we consider the formal regulations that bear on\n§§306 and 404. See Mead, 533 U. S., at 234–238. The\nregulations, like the statutes, do not address the question\nwhether §306, and the EPA new source performance stan\ndards promulgated under it, apply to §404 permits and the\ndischarges they authorize. There is no regulation, for\nexample, interpreting §306(e)’s text—“standard of per\nformance applicable to such source”—to mean that a\nperformance standard ceases to be “applicable” the mo\nment the discharge qualifies as fill material, which would\nresolve the cases in petitioners’ favor. Nor is there a\nregulation providing that the Corps, in deciding whether\nto grant a permit under §404, must deny that permit if the\ndischarge would violate §306(e), which would decide the\ncases for SEACC.\n  Rather than address the tension between §§306 and\n404, the regulations instead implement the statutory\nframework without elaboration on this point. Each of the\ntwo principal regulations, which have been mentioned\nabove, seems to stand on its own without reference to the\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nother. The EPA’s new source performance standard con\ntains no exception for fill material; and it forbids any\ndischarge of “process wastewater,” a term that includes\nsolid wastes. 40 CFR §440.104(b)(1); see Part III–A–1,\nsupra. The agencies’ joint regulation defining fill material\nis also unqualified. It includes “slurry, or tailings or simi\nlar mining-related materials” in its definition of a “dis\ncharge of fill material,” 40 CFR §232.2; and it contains no\nexception for slurry that is regulated by an EPA perform\nance standard.\n   The parties point to additional regulations, but these\nprovisions do not offer a clear basis of reconciliation. An\nEPA regulation, mentioned above, provides that\n“[d]ischarges of dredged or fill material into waters of the\nUnited States which are regulated under section 404 of\nCWA” “do not require [§402] permits” from the EPA.\n§122.3. As we have explained, however, this merely states\nthat a permit for this discharge cannot be issued by the\nEPA. See Part II, supra. The regulation does not answer\nthe question whether the EPA’s new source performance\nstandard, and §306(e), apply to a discharge regulated by\nthe Corps under §404.\n   The agencies also direct us to the §404(b) guidelines\nwritten by the EPA to guide the Corps permitting decision.\nSee 40 CFR pt. 230. The agencies note that these guide\nlines do not expressly require the Corps, in issuing a\npermit, to consider whether the discharge would violate\nEPA’s performance standards. Here we think failure to\nmention §306 or the EPA new source performance stan\ndards does offer some indication that these are not rele\nvant to the §404 permit, though the argument falls short\nof being conclusive. The Corps’ own regulations require\nthe agency to evaluate permit applications “for compliance\nwith applicable [EPA] effluent limitations.” 33 CFR\n§320.4(d) (2008). The regulations do not answer whether\nthe new source performance standard is “applicable” to a\n20       COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n                CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\ndischarge of fill material.\n                             C\n  The regulations do not give a definitive answer to the\nquestion whether §306 applies to discharges regulated by\nthe Corps under §404, but we do find that agency interpre\ntation and agency application of the regulations are in\nstructive and to the point. Auer, 519 U. S., at 461. The\nquestion is addressed and resolved in a reasonable and\ncoherent way by the practice and policy of the two agen\ncies, all as recited in a memorandum written in May 2004\nby Diane Regas, then the Director of the EPA’s Office of\nWetlands, Oceans and Watersheds, to Randy Smith, the\nDirector of the EPA’s regional Office of Water with re\nsponsibility over the mine. App. 141a–149a (Regas Memo\nrandum). The Memorandum, though not subject to suffi\nciently formal procedures to merit Chevron deference, see\nMead, supra, at 234–238, is entitled to a measure of defer\nence because it interprets the agencies’ own regulatory\nscheme. See Auer, supra, at 461.\n  The Regas Memorandum explains:\n     “As a result [of the fact that the discharge is regulated\n     under §404], the regulatory regime applicable to dis\n     charges under section 402, including effluent limita\n     tions guidelines and standards, such as those applica\n     ble to gold ore mining . . . do not apply to the\n     placement of tailings into the proposed impoundment\n     [of Lower Slate Lake]. See 40 CFR §122.3(b).” App.\n     144a–145a.\nThe regulation that the Memorandum cites—40 CFR\n§122.3—is one we considered above and found ambiguous.\nThat regulation provides: “[d]ischarges of dredged or fill\nmaterial into waters of the United States which are regu\nlated under section 404 of CWA” “do not require [§402]\npermits.” The Regas Memorandum takes an instructive\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpretive step when it explains that because the dis\ncharge “do[es] not require” an EPA permit, ibid., the\nEPA’s performance standard “do[es] not apply” to the\ndischarge. App. 145a. The Memorandum presents a\nreasonable interpretation of the regulatory regime. We\ndefer to the interpretation because it is not “plainly erro\nneous or inconsistent with the regulation[s].” Auer, supra,\nat 461 (internal quotation marks omitted). Five factors\ninform that conclusion.\n  First, the Memorandum preserves a role for the EPA’s\nperformance standard. It confines the Memorandum’s\nscope to closed bodies of water, like the lake here. App.\n142a–143a, n. 1. When slurry is discharged into a closed\nbody of water, the Memorandum explains, the EPA’s\nperformance standard retains an important role in regu\nlating the discharge into surrounding waters. The Memo\nrandum does not purport to invalidate the EPA’s perform\nance standard.\n  Second, the Memorandum acknowledges that this is not\nan instance in which the discharger attempts to evade the\nrequirements of the EPA’s performance standard. The\nKensington Mine is not, for example, a project that smug\ngles a discharge of EPA-regulated pollutants into a sepa\nrate discharge of Corps-regulated fill material. The in\nstant cases do not present a process or plan designed to\nmanipulate the outer boundaries of the definition of “fill\nmaterial” by labeling minute quantities of EPA-regulated\nsolids as fill. The Memorandum states that when a dis\ncharge has only an “incidental filling effect,” the EPA’s\nperformance standard continues to govern that discharge.\nId., at 145a.\n  Third, the Memorandum’s interpretation preserves the\nCorps’ authority to determine whether a discharge is in\nthe public interest. See 33 CFR §320.4(a)(1); 40 CFR\n§230.10. The Corps has significant expertise in making\nthis determination. Applying it, the Corps determined\n22      COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n               CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthat placing slurry in the lake will improve that body of\nwater by making it wider, shallower, and so more capable\nof sustaining aquatic life. The Corps determined, fur\nthermore, that the alternative—a heap of tailings larger\nthan the Pentagon placed upon wetlands—would cause\nmore harm to the environment. Because the Memoran\ndum preserves an important role for the Corps’ expertise,\nits conclusion that the EPA’s performance standard does\nnot apply is a reasonable one.\n   Fourth, the Regas Memorandum’s interpretation does\nnot allow toxic pollutants (as distinguished from other,\nless dangerous pollutants, such as slurry) to enter the\nnavigable waters. The EPA has regulated toxic pollutants\nunder a separate provision, §307 of the CWA, and the\nEPA’s §404(b) guidelines require the Corps to deny a §404\npermit for any discharge that would violate the EPA’s\n§307 toxic-effluent limitations. 40 CFR §230.10(b)(2).\n   Fifth, as a final reason to defer to the Regas Memoran\ndum, we find it a sensible and rational construction that\nreconciles §§306, 402, and 404, and the regulations im\nplementing them, which the alternatives put forward by\nthe parties do not. SEACC’s argument, that §402 applies\nto this discharge and not §404, is not consistent with the\nstatute and regulations, as already noted. See Part II,\nsupra.\n   The Court requested the parties to submit supplemental\nbriefs addressing whether the CWA contemplated that\nboth agencies would issue a permit for a discharge. 556\nU. S. ___ (2009). A two-permit regime would allow the\nEPA to apply its performance standard, while the Corps\ncould apply its §404(b) criteria. The parties agree, how\never, that a two-permit regime is contrary to the statute\nand the regulations. We conclude that this is correct. A\ntwo-permit regime would cause confusion, delay, expense,\nand uncertainty in the permitting process. In agreement\nwith all of the parties, we conclude that, when a permit is\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequired to discharge fill material, either a §402 or a §404\npermit is necessary. Here, we now hold, §404 applies, not\n§402. See Part II, supra.\n  The Regas Memorandum’s interpretation of the agen\ncies’ regulations is consistent with the regulatory scheme\nas a whole. The Memorandum preserves a role for the\nEPA’s performance standards; it guards against the possi\nbility of evasion of those standards; it employs the Corps’\nexpertise in evaluating the effects of fill material on the\naquatic environment; it does not allow toxic pollutants to\nbe discharged; and we have been offered no better way to\nharmonize the regulations. We defer to the EPA’s conclu\nsion that its performance standard does not apply to the\ninitial discharge of slurry into the lake but applies only to\nthe later discharge of water from the lake into the down\nstream creek.\n                            D\n   SEACC argues against deference to the Regas Memo\nrandum. In its view the Regas Memorandum is contrary\nto published agency statements and earlier agency prac\ntice. SEACC cites three agency statements: A 1986\n“memorandum of understanding” between the EPA and\nthe Corps regarding the definition of fill material; the\npreamble to the agencies’ current 2002 fill regulation; and\ncomments made by the agencies in promulgating the 2002\nfill regulation. These arguments are not convincing.\n                             1\n   In 1986, to reconcile their then-differing definitions of\n“fill material,” the EPA and the Corps issued a “memoran\ndum of agreement.” 51 Fed. Reg. 8871 (MOA). The\nmemorandum was not made subject to notice-and\ncomment procedures, but it was published in the Federal\nRegister. It defined the statutory term “fill material” until\nthe current definition took effect in 2002. Brief for Fed\n24       COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n                CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\neral Respondents 30–31, n. 8.\n  SEACC points to paragraph B(5) of the MOA, which\nreads:\n     “[A] pollutant (other than dredged material) will nor\n     mally be considered by EPA and the Corps to be sub\n     ject to section 402 if it is a discharge in liquid, semi\n     liquid, or suspended form or if it is a discharge of solid\n     material of a homogeneous nature normally associ\n     ated with single industry wastes . . . . These materials\n     include placer mining wastes, phosphate mining\n     wastes, titanium mining wastes, sand and gravel\n     wastes, fly ash, and drilling muds. As appropriate,\n     EPA and the Corps will identify additional such mate\n     rials.” 51 Fed. Reg. 8872.\nIt is true, as SEACC notes, that this passage suggests that\n§402 will “normally” apply to discharges of “suspended”—\ni.e., solid—pollutants. But that statement is not contrary\nto the Regas Memorandum, which acknowledges that the\nEPA retains authority under §402 to regulate the dis\ncharge of suspended solids from Lower Slate Lake into\ndownstream waters. This passage does not address the\nquestion presented by these cases, and answered by the\nRegas Memorandum, as to whether the EPA’s perform\nance standard applies when the discharge qualifies as fill\nmaterial. In fact, the MOA’s preamble suggests that when\na discharge qualifies as “fill material,” the Corps retains\nauthority to regulate it under §404:\n     “Discharges listed in the Corps definition of ‘discharge\n     of fill material,’ . . . remain subject to section 404 even\n     if they occur in association with discharges of wastes\n     meeting the criteria in the agreement for section 402\n     discharges.” Id., at 8871.\n  The MOA is quite consistent with the agencies’ determi\nnation that the Corps regulates all discharges of fill mate\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

Reg. 31129 (2002)\n(final rule). It cites the opening passages of the preamble,\nwhich state:\n    “[T]oday’s rule is generally consistent with current\n    agency practice and so it does not expand the types of\n    discharges that will be covered under section 404.”\n    Id., at 31133.\nIn SEACC’s view, this passage demonstrates that the fill\nrule was not intended to displace the pre-existing froth\nflotation gold mine performance standard, which has been\non the books since 1982.\n   The preamble goes on to say, in a section entitled “Efflu\nent Guideline Limitations and 402 Permits”:\n    “[W]e emphasize that today’s rule generally is in\n    tended to maintain our existing approach to regulat\n    ing pollutants under either section 402 or 404 of the\n    CWA. Effluent limitation guidelines and new source\n    performance standards (‘effluent guidelines’) promul\n    gated under section 304 and 306 of the CWA establish\n    limitations and standards for specified wastestreams\n    from industrial categories, and those limitations and\n    standards are incorporated into permits issued under\n    section 402 of the Act. EPA has never sought to regu\n    late fill material under effluent guidelines. Rather,\n    effluent guidelines restrict discharges of pollutants\n    from identified wastestreams based upon the pollut\n    ant reduction capabilities of available treatment tech\n    nologies. Recognizing that some discharges (such as\n    suspended or settleable solids) can have the associ\n    ated effect, over time, of raising the bottom elevation\n    of a water due to settling of waterborne pollutants, we\n26       COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n                CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n     do not consider such pollutants to be ‘fill material,’\n     and nothing in today’s rule changes that view. Nor\n     does today’s rule change any determination we have\n     made regarding discharges that are subject to an ef\n     fluent limitation guideline and standards, which will\n     continue to be regulated under section 402 of the\n     CWA. Similarly, this rule does not alter the manner\n     in which water quality standards currently apply un\n     der the section 402 or the section 404 programs.” Id.,\n     at 31135.\nAlthough the preamble asserts it does not change agency\npolicy with regard to EPA performance standards and\n§402 permitting decisions, it is explicit in noting that the\nEPA has “never sought to regulate fill material under\neffluent guidelines.” Ibid. The preamble, then, is consis\ntent with the Regas Memorandum. If a discharge does not\nqualify as fill material, the EPA’s new source performance\nstandard applies. If the discharge qualifies as fill, the\nperformance standard does not apply; and there was no\nearlier agency practice or policy to the contrary.\n                             3\n  SEACC also cites remarks made by the agencies in\nresponse to public comments on the proposed fill material\nregulation. App. 22a–127a. These remarks were incorpo\nrated by reference into the administrative record. 67 Fed.\nReg. 31131.\n  Responding to a question about whether “mine tailings”\nwould be “subject to section 404 regulation as opposed to\nsection 402” under the 2002 fill regulation, the agencies\nstated:\n     “Today’s final rule clarifies that any material that has\n     the effect of fill is regulated under section 404 and\n     further that the placement of ‘overburden, slurry, or\n     tailings or similar mining-related materials’ is consid\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          27\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    ered a discharge of fill material. Nevertheless, if EPA\n    has previously determined that certain materials are\n    subject to an [effluent limitation guideline] under spe\n    cific circumstances, then that determination remains\n    valid. Moreover, . . . permits issued pursuant to sec\n    tion 402 are intended to regulate process water and\n    provide effluent limits that are protective of receiving\n    water quality. This distinction provides the frame\n    work for today’s rule.” App. 48a.\nThis statement is not conclusive of the issue. SEACC\nnotes that this response, like the regulation’s preamble,\npledges that EPA’s “previou[s] . . . determination[s]” with\nregard to the application of performance standards “re\nmai[n] valid.” But, as noted above, the Regas Memoran\ndum has followed this policy by applying the EPA’s per\nformance standard to the discharge of water from the lake\ninto the downstream creek. The response does not state\nthat the EPA will apply its performance standards to\ndischarges of fill material.\n                             4\n   The agencies’ published statements indicate adherence\nto the EPA’s previous application and interpretation of its\nperformance standards. SEACC cannot show that the\nagencies have changed their interpretation or application\nof their regulations.\n   SEACC cites no instance in which the EPA has applied\none of its performance standards to a discharge of fill\nmaterial. By contrast, Coeur Alaska cites two instances in\nwhich the Corps issued a §404 permit authorizing a mine\nto discharge solid waste (tailings) as fill material. See\nBrief for Petitioner Coeur Alaska 40–42. SEACC objects\nthat those two §404 permits authorized discharges that\nused the tailings to construct useful structures—a dam in\none case, a tailings pond in another. Here, by contrast,\nSEACC contends that the primary purpose of the dis\n28      COEUR ALASKA, INC. v.

But that objection misses the point. The two §404\npermits cited by Coeur Alaska illustrate that the agencies\ndid not have a prior practice of applying EPA performance\nstandards to discharges of mining wastes that qualify as\nfill material.\n   SEACC has not demonstrated that the agencies have\nchanged their policy, and it cannot show that the Regas\nMemorandum is contrary to the agencies’ published\nstatements.\n                         *    *   *\n  We accord deference to the agencies’ reasonable decision\nto continue their prior practice.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and\nthese cases are remanded for further proceedings consis\ntent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

S. C. §1344(a), or as a “pollutant,” subject to §§402 and\n306, 33 U. S. C. §§1342(a), 1316(a). Within this zone, the\nlaw authorizes the environmental agencies to classify\nmaterial as the one or the other, so long as they act within\nthe bounds of relevant regulations, and provided that the\nclassification, considered in terms of the purposes of the\nstatutes and relevant regulations, is reasonable.\n  This approach reflects the difficulty of applying §§402\nand 306 literally to every new-source-related discharge of a\n“pollutant.” The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\napplies §306 new source “performance standards” to a\nwide variety of discharges, ranging, for example, from\n2        COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n                CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                   BREYER, J., concurring\n\n\nthose involved in the processing of apples into apple juice\nor apple cider, 40 CFR §407.10 (2008); to the manufactur\ning of cement, §411.10; to the production of fresh meat\ncuts by a meat cutter, §432.60; and to the manufacture of\npharmaceutical products by fermentation, §439.10. See\ngenerally 40 CFR pts. 405–471 (containing more than 800\npages of “new source performance” and effluent limitation\nregulations). At the same time the regulations for any one\npoint source often regulate numerous chemicals, minerals,\nand other substances produced by that point source; in the\ncase of fermentation products, for example, the regulations\nprovide performance standards for roughly 30 different\nchemicals. §439.15. These “standards of performance”\n“reflect the greatest degree of effluent reduction which the\nAdministrator determines to be achievable through appli\ncation of the best available demonstrated control technol\nogy . . . including, where practicable, a standard permit\nting no discharge of pollutants.” 33 U. S. C. §1316(a)(1).\n   To literally apply these performance standards so as to\nforbid the use of any of these substances as “fill,” even\nwhen, say, they constitute no more than trace elements in\ndirt, crushed rock, or sand that is clearly being used as\n“fill” to build a levee or to replace dirt removed from a lake\nbottom may prove unnecessarily strict, cf. §1362(6) (defin\ning “pollutant” to include “rock”), to the point that such\napplication would undermine the objective of §404, which\nforesees the use of “dredged or fill material” in certain\ncircumstances and with approval of the relevant agencies.\n§1344. At minimum, the EPA might reasonably read the\nstatute and the applicable regulations as allowing the use\nof such material, say crushed rock, as “fill” in some of\nthese situations. Cf. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural\nResources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842–844\n(1984); Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.

Post, at 7 (dissenting opinion).\n   Yet there are safeguards against that occurring. For\none thing, as the Court recognizes, see ante, at 11, it is not\nthe case that any material that has the “ ‘effect of . . .\n[c]hanging the bottom elevation’ ” of the body of water is\nautomatically subject to §404, not §402. The EPA has\nnever suggested that it would interpret the regulations so\nas to turn §404 into a loophole, permitting evasion of a\n“performance standard” simply because a polluter dis\ncharges enough pollutant to raise the bottom elevation of\nthe body of water. For another thing, even where a matter\nis determined reasonably to be “fill” and consequently falls\nwithin §404, the EPA can retain an important role in the\npermitting process. That is because the EPA may veto\nany §404 plan that it finds has an “unacceptable adverse\neffect on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and\nfishery areas . . . , wildlife, or recreational areas.”\n§1344(c). Finally, EPA’s decision not to apply §306, but to\nallow permitting to proceed under §404, must be a reason\nable decision; and court review will help assure that is so.\n5 U. S. C. §706.\n   In these cases, it seems to me that the EPA’s interpreta\ntion of the statute as permitting the EPA/Corps of Engi\nneers “fill” definition to apply to the cases at hand is rea\nsonable, hence lawful. Lower Slate Lake, located roughly\nthree miles from the Kensington Gold Mine, is 51 feet\ndeep, 800 feet wide, and 2,000 feet long; downstream from\nthe lake is Slate Creek. Faced with a difficult choice\nbetween creating a huge pile of slurry on nearby wetlands\nor using part of the lake as a storage facility for mine\ntailings, see App. 294a–298a; see also ante, at 5–8, the\n4        COEUR ALASKA, INC. v.

The\ntailings, the EPA recognized, would have the “immediate\neffect of filling the areas of water into which they are\ndischarged.” Ibid. But it would also treat any spillover of\nthe tailings, or chemicals from the tailings, into any\nnearby waterway, most particularly Slate Creek (running\nout of Slate Lake) as requiring a §402 permit. The EPA’s\n§306 “performance standard” would apply and that stan\ndard insists upon no discharge of process wastewater at\nall. Id., at 145a; see also 40 CFR §440.104(b). The EPA\nreached this result because it recognized that, even though\npollutants discharged into the creek might come “in the\nform of suspended and settleable solids,” such solids would\n“have, at most, an incidental filling effect.” App. 145a.\nThe EPA thereby sought to apply the distinction it had\npreviously recognized between discharges that have the\nimmediate effect of raising the bottom elevation of water,\nand those that only have the “associated effect, over time,\nof raising the bottom elevation of a water due to settling of\nwaterborne pollutants.” See 67 Fed. Reg. 31135 (2002)\n(concluding that §402 applies to the latter); see also Brief\nfor G. Tracy Mehan III as Amicus Curiae 22–23.\n   I cannot say whether the EPA’s compromise represents\nthe best overall environmental result; but I do believe it\namounts to the kind of detailed decision that the statutes\ndelegate authority to the EPA, not the courts, to make\n(subject to the bounds of reasonableness). I believe the\nCourt’s views are consistent with those I here express.\nAnd with that understanding, I join its opinion.\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natu\nral Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984).\nThe opinion purports to give this agency interpretation “a\nmeasure of deference” because it involves an interpretation\nof “the agencies’ own regulatory scheme,” and “ ‘the regu-\nlatory regime,’ ” ante, at 20 (citing Auer v. Robbins, 519\n2           COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n                   CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J. \n\n\nU. S. 452, 461 (1997)). Auer, however, stands only for the\nprinciple that we defer to an agency’s interpretation of its\nown ambiguous regulation. But it becomes obvious from\nthe ensuing discussion that the referenced “regulatory\nscheme,” and “regulatory regime” for which the Court\naccepts the agency interpretation includes not just the\nagencies’ own regulations but also (and indeed primarily)\nthe conformity of those regulations with the ambiguous\ngoverning statute, which is the primary dispute here.\n   Surely the Court is not adding to our already inscruta\nble opinion in United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218\n(2001), the irrational fillip that an agency position which\notherwise does not qualify for Chevron deference does\nreceive Chevron deference if it clarifies not just an am\nbiguous statute but also an ambiguous regulation. One\nmust conclude, then, that if today’s opinion is not accord\ning the agencies’ reasonable and authoritative interpreta\ntion of the Clean Water Act Chevron deference, it is ac\ncording some new type of deference—perhaps to be called\nin the future Coeur Alaska deference—which is identical\nto Chevron deference except for the name.\n   The Court’s deference to the EPA and the Corps of\nEngineers in today’s cases is eminently reasonable. It is\nquite impossible to achieve predictable (and relatively\nlitigation-free) administration of the vast body of complex\nlaws committed to the charge of executive agencies with\nout the assurance that reviewing courts will accept rea\nsonable and authoritative agency interpretation of am\nbiguous provisions. If we must not call that practice\nChevron deference, then we have to rechristen the rose.\nOf course the only reason a new name is required is our\nmisguided opinion in Mead, whose incomprehensible\ncriteria for Chevron deference have produced so much\nconfusion in the lower courts* that there has now appeared\n——————\n    * Compare, e.g., Kruse v.

The “tailings slurry” would contain concentrations of\naluminum, copper, lead, and mercury. Over the life of the\nmine, roughly 4.5 million tons of solid tailings would enter\nthe lake, raising the bottom elevation by 50 feet. It is\nundisputed that the discharge would kill all of the lake’s\nfish and nearly all of its other aquatic life.1\n   Coeur Alaska’s proposal is prohibited by the Environ\nmental Protection Agency (EPA) performance standard\n——————\n  1 Whether  aquatic life will eventually be able to inhabit the lake\nagain is uncertain. Compare ante, at 5, with App. 201a–202a; and\nSoutheast Alaska Conservation Council v. United States Army Corps of\nEngineers, 486 F. 3d 638, 642 (CA9 2007).\n2       COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n               CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                 GINSBURG, J., dissenting \n\n\nforbidding any discharge of process wastewater from new\n“froth-flotation” mills into waters of the United States.\nSee 40 CFR §440.104(b)(1) (2008). Section 306 of the\nClean Water Act directs EPA to promulgate such perform\nance standards, 33 U. S. C. §1316(a), and declares it\nunlawful for any discharger to violate them, §1316(e).\nOrdinarily, that would be the end of the inquiry.\n   Coeur Alaska contends, however, that its discharge is\nnot subject to EPA’s regulatory regime, but is governed,\ninstead, by the mutually exclusive permitting authority of\nthe Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps has authority,\nunder §404 of the Act, §1344(a), to issue permits for dis\ncharges of “dredged or fill material.” By regulation, a\ndischarge that has the effect of raising a water body’s\nbottom elevation qualifies as “fill material.” See 33 CFR\n§323.2(e) (2008). Discharges properly within the Corps’\npermitting authority, it is undisputed, are not subject to\nEPA performance standards. See ante, at 20; Brief for\nPetitioner Coeur Alaska 26; Brief for Respondent South\neast Alaska Conservation Council et al. 37.\n   The litigation before the Court thus presents a single\nquestion: Is a pollutant discharge prohibited under §306 of\nthe Act eligible for a §404 permit as a discharge of fill\nmaterial? In agreement with the Court of Appeals, I\nwould answer no. The statute’s text, structure, and pur\npose all mandate adherence to EPA pollution-control\nrequirements. A discharge covered by a performance\nstandard must be authorized, if at all, by EPA.\n                              I\n\n                             A\n\n  Congress enacted the Clean Water Act in 1972 “to re\nstore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological\nintegrity” of the waters of the United States. 33 U. S. C.\n§1251(a). “The use of any river, lake, stream or ocean as a\nwaste treatment system,” the Act’s drafters stated, “is\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

Congress\nannounced in the Act itself an ambitious objective: to\neliminate, by 1985, the discharge of all pollutants into the\nNation’s navigable waters. 33 U. S. C. §1251(a).\n   In service of its goals, Congress issued a core command:\n“[T]he discharge of any pollutant by any person shall be\nunlawful,” except in compliance with the Act’s terms.\n§1311(a). The Act’s substantive requirements—housed\nprimarily in Subchapter III, “Standards and Enforce\nment”—establish “a comprehensive regulatory program\nsupervised by an expert administrative agency,” EPA.\nMilwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U. S. 304, 317 (1981). See also\n33 U. S. C. §1251(d) (“Except as otherwise expressly pro\nvided . . . , the Administrator of [EPA] shall administer\nthis [Act].”).\n   The Act instructs EPA to establish various technology\nbased, increasingly stringent effluent limitations for cate\ngories of point sources. E.g., §§1311, 1314. These limita\ntions, formulated as restrictions “on quantities, rates, and\nconcentrations of chemical, physical, biological, and other\nconstituents,” §1362(11), were imposed to achieve national\nuniformity among categories of sources. See, e.g., E. I. du\nPont de Nemours & Co. v. Train, 430 U. S. 112, 129–130\n(1977). The limitations for a given discharge depend on\nthe type of pollutant and source at issue.2\n   Of key importance, new sources must meet stringent\n“standards of performance” adopted by EPA under §306.\nThat section makes it “unlawful for any . . . new source to\noperate . . . in violation of” an applicable performance\n——————\n  2 In addition, the Act requires States to institute comprehensive wa\n\nter quality standards for intrastate waters, subject to EPA approval.\nSee §1313. This program supplements the technology-based standards,\nserving to “prevent water quality from falling below acceptable levels”\neven when point sources comply with effluent limitations.

In line\nwith Congress’ aim “to insure . . .‘maximum feasible con\ntrol of new sources,’ ” du Pont, 430 U. S., at 138, the pre\nferred standard for a new source is one “ ‘permitting no\ndischarge of pollutants,’ ” id., at 137–138 (quoting 33\nU. S. C. §1316(a)(1) (emphasis added)). Moreover, new\nsources, unlike existing sources, are not eligible for EPA\ngranted variances from applicable limitations. 430 U. S.,\nat 138.3\n  In 1982, EPA promulgated new source performance\nstandards for facilities engaged in mining, including those\nusing a froth-flotation milling process. See Ore Mining\nand Dressing Point Source Category Effluent Limitations\nGuidelines and New Source Performance Standards, 47\nFed. Reg. 54598 (1982). Existing mills, the Agency found,\nwere already achieving zero discharge; it was therefore\npracticable, EPA concluded, for new mills to do as well.\nId., at 54602. Accordingly, under 40 CFR §440.104(b)(1),\nnew mines using the froth-flotation method, as Coeur\nAlaska proposes to do, may not discharge wastewater\ndirectly into waters of the United States.\n                             B\n  The nationwide pollution-control requirements just\ndescribed are implemented through the National Pollution\nDischarge Elimination System (NPDES), a permitting\nscheme set forth in §402 and administered by EPA and the\nStates. The NPDES is the linchpin of the Act, for it trans\nforms generally applicable effluent limitations into the\nindividual obligations of each discharger. EPA v. Califor\n——————\n   3 Even the provision allowing the President to exempt federal instal\n\nlations from compliance with the Act’s requirements—“if he determines\nit to be in the paramount interest of the United States to do so”—does\nnot extend to new source standards: “[N]o exemption may be granted\nfrom the requirements of section [306] or [307] of this [Act].” 33\nU.

S.\n200, 205 (1976). The discharge of a pollutant is generally\nprohibited unless the source has obtained a NPDES per\nmit. E.g., EPA v. National Crushed Stone Assn., 449 U. S.\n64, 71 (1980) (“Section 402 authorizes the establishment of\nthe [NPDES], under which every discharger of pollutants\nis required to obtain a permit.”).\n   The Act also establishes a separate permitting scheme,\nadministered by the Corps, for discharges of “dredged or\nfill material.” 33 U. S. C. §1344(a). Section 404 hews to\nthe Corps’ established expertise in matters of navigability\nand construction. The §404 program does not implement\nthe uniform, technology-based pollution-control standards\nset out, inter alia, in §306. Instead, §404 permits are\nsubject to regulatory guidelines based generally on the\nimpact of a discharge on the receiving environment. See\n§1344(b); ante, at 4–5.\n   As the above-described statutory background indicates,\nCoeur Alaska’s claim to a §404 permit carries weighty\nimplications. If eligible for that permit, Coeur Alaska can\nevade the exacting performance standard prescribed by\nEPA for froth-flotation mills. It may, instead, use Lower\nSlate Lake “as the settling pond and disposal site for the\ntailings.” App. 360a (Corps’ Record of Decision).\n                             II\n  Is a pollutant discharge prohibited under §306(e) eligi\nble to receive a §404 permit as a discharge of fill material?\nAll agree on preliminary matters. Only one agency, the\nCorps or EPA, can issue a permit for the discharge. See\nante, at 10, 22. Only EPA, through the NPDES program,\nissues permits that implement §306. See supra, at 2.\nFurther, §306(e) and EPA’s froth-flotation performance\nstandard, unless inapplicable here, bar Coeur Alaska’s\nproposed discharge. See ante, at 14–15.\n  No part of the statutory scheme, in my view, calls into\n6        COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA\n                CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n                  GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nquestion the governance of EPA’s performance standard.\nThe text of §306(e) states a clear proscription: “[I]t shall be\nunlawful for any owner or operator of any new source to\noperate such source in violation of any standard of per\nformance applicable to such source.” 33 U. S. C. §1316(e).\nUnder the standard of performance relevant here, “there\nshall be no discharge of process wastewater to navigable\nwaters from mills that use the froth-flotation process” for\nmining gold. 40 CFR §440.104(b)(1). The Act imposes\nthese requirements without qualification.\n   Section 404, stating that the Corps “may issue permits”\nfor the discharge of “dredged or fill material,” does not\ncreate an exception to §306(e)’s plain command. 33\nU. S. C. §1344(a). Cf. ante, at 12. Section 404 neither\nmentions §306 nor states a contrary requirement. The Act\ncan be home to both provisions, with no words added or\nomitted, so long as the category of “dredged or fill mate\nrial” eligible for a §404 permit is read in harmony with\n§306. Doing so yields a simple rule: Discharges governed\nby EPA performance standards are subject to EPA’s ad\nministration and receive permits under the NPDES, not\n§404.\n   This reading accords with the Act’s structure and objec\ntives. It retains, through the NPDES, uniform application\nof the Act’s core pollution-control requirements, and it\nrespects Congress’ special concern for new sources. Leav\ning pollution-related decisions to EPA, moreover, is consis\ntent with Congress’ delegation to that agency of primary\nresponsibility to administer the Act. Most fundamental,\nadhering to §306(e)’s instruction honors the overriding\nstatutory goal of eliminating water pollution, and Con\ngress’ particular rejection of the use of navigable waters as\nwaste disposal sites. See supra, at 2–3. See also 33\nU. S. C. §1324 (creating “clean lakes” program requiring\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

A\ndischarge of a pollutant, otherwise prohibited by firm\nstatutory command, becomes lawful if it contains suffi\ncient solid matter to raise the bottom of a water body,\ntransformed into a waste disposal facility. Whole catego\nries of regulated industries can thereby gain immunity\nfrom a variety of pollution-control standards. The loophole\nwould swallow not only standards governing mining ac\ntivities, see 40 CFR pt. 440 (effluent limitations and new\nsource performance standards for ore mining and dress\ning); id., pt. 434 (coal mining); id., pt. 436 (mineral min\ning), but also standards for dozens of other categories of\nregulated point sources, see, e.g., id., pt. 411 (cement\n——————\n  4 The   Court asserts that “numerous difficulties” will ensue if a dis\ncharge governed by a new source performance standard is ineligible for\na §404 permit. Ante, at 12. Namely, the Court notes, the discharger\nwill have to determine whether a performance standard applies to it.\nAnte, at 13. That is not only the usual inquiry under the Clean Water\nAct; it is one Coeur Alaska answered, without apparent difficulty, when\nit sought and obtained an EPA permit for the proposed discharge from\nthe lake into a downstream creek. See ante, at 6.\n   JUSTICE BREYER fears that “litera[l] appl[ication]” of performance\nstandards would interfere with efforts “to build a levee or to replace\ndirt removed from a lake bottom,” and thus “may prove unnecessarily\nstrict.” Ante, at 2 (concurring opinion). His concerns are imaginative,\nbut it is questionable whether they are real. Apple juice processors,\nmeatcutters, cement manufacturers, and pharmaceutical producers do\nnot ordinarily build levees—and it is almost inconceivable that they\nwould do so using the waste generated by their highly specific indus\ntrial processes. See, e.g., 40 CFR §411.10 (performance standard for\nparticular cement manufacturing process). Levee construction gener\nally is undertaken by developers or government, entities not subject to\nperformance standards for such a project. This litigation, furthermore,\ndoes not illustrate the “difficulty” JUSTICE BREYER perceives. See ante,\nat 1. Coeur Alaska does not seek to build a levee or return dirt to a\nlake; it simply wants to use Lower Slate Lake as a waste disposal site.\n8         COEUR ALASKA, INC. v.

Providing an escape\nhatch for polluters whose discharges contain solid matter,\nit bears noting, is particularly perverse; the Act specifi\ncally focuses on solids as harmful pollutants. See 33\nU.

American Trucking\nAssns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 467–468 (2001). Yet an altera\ntion of that kind is just what today’s decision imagines.\nCongress, as the Court reads the Act, silently upended, in\nan ancillary permitting provision, its painstaking pollu\ntion-control scheme. See ante, at 17. Congress did so, the\nCourt holds, notwithstanding the lawmakers’ stated effort\n“to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and bio\nlogical integrity” of the waters of the United States, 33\n——————\n  5 The “safeguards” JUSTICE BREYER identifies are hardly reassuring.\n\nSee ante, at 3 (concurring opinion). Given today’s decision, it is opti\nmistic to expect that EPA or the courts will act vigorously to prevent\nevasion of performance standards. Nor is EPA’s veto power under\n§404(c) of the Clean Water Act an adequate substitute for adherence to\n§306. That power—exercised only a dozen times over 36 years encom\npassing more than one million permit applications, see Brief for Ameri\ncan Rivers 14—hinges on a finding of “unacceptable adverse effect,” 33\nU. S. C. §1344(c). Destruction of nearly all aquatic life in a pristine\nlake apparently does not qualify as “unacceptable.” Reliance on ad hoc\nvetoes, moreover, undermines Congress’ aim to install uniform water\npollution regulation.\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

To say the least, I am persuaded, that\nis not how Congress intended the Clean Water Act to\noperate.\n   In sum, it is neither necessary nor proper to read the\nstatute as allowing mines to bypass EPA’s zero-discharge\nstandard by classifying slurry as “fill material.” The use\nof waters of the United States as “settling ponds” for\nharmful mining waste, the Court of Appeals correctly held,\nis antithetical to the text, structure, and purpose of the\nClean Water Act.\n                      *     *    *\n  For the reasons stated, I would affirm the judgment of\nthe Ninth Circuit.\n</pre>", "id": 145854, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2009/06/22/Coeur_Alaska_Inc._v._Southeast_Alaska_Conservation_Council.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2008                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued January 12, 2009—Decided June 22, 2009*\nIn reviving a closed Alaska gold mine using a “froth flotation” tech\n  nique, petitioner Coeur Alaska, Inc., plans to dispose of the resulting\n  waste material, a rock and water mixture called “slurry,” by pumping\n  it into a nearby lake and then discharging purified lake water into a\n  downstream creek. The Clean Water Act (CWA), inter alia, classifies\n  crushed rock as a “pollutant,” §352(6); forbids its discharge “[e]xcept\n  as in compliance” with the Act, §301(a); empowers the Army Corps of\n  Engineers (Corps) to “issue permits . . . for the discharge of . . . fill\n  material,” §404(a); and authorizes the Environmental Protection\n  Agency (EPA) to “issue a permit for the discharge of any pollutant,”\n  “[e]xcept as provided in [§404],” §402(a). The Corps and the EPA to\n  gether define “fill material” as any “material [that] has the effect of\n  . . . [c]hanging the bottom elevation” of water, including “slurry . . . or\n  similar mining-related materials.” 40 CFR §232.2. Coeur Alaska ob\n  tained a §404 permit for the slurry discharge from the Corps and a\n  §402 permit for the lake water discharge from the EPA.\n      Respondent environmental groups (collectively, SEACC) sued the\n  Corps and several of its officials under the Administrative Procedure\n  Act, arguing that the CWA §404 permit was not “in accordance with\n  law,” 5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A), because (1) Coeur Alaska should have\n  sought a CWA §402 permit from the EPA instead, just as it did for\n  the lake water discharge; and (2) the slurry discharge would violate\n  the “new source performance standard” the EPA had promulgated\n  under CWA §306(b), forbidding froth-flotation gold mines to dis\n——————\n  * Together with No. 07–990, Alaska v.

Coeur Alaska and petitioner Alaska intervened as de\n    fendants. The District Court granted the defendants summary\n    judgment, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the proposed\n    slurry discharge would violate the EPA’s performance standard and\n    §306(e).\nHeld:\n    1. The Corps, not the EPA, has authority to permit the slurry dis\n charge. Pp. 9–13.\n       (a) By specifying that, “[e]xcept as provided in . . . [§404,]” the\n EPA “may . . . issue permit[s] for the discharge of any pollutant,”\n §402(a) forbids the EPA to issue permits for fill materials falling un\n der the Corps’ §404 authority. Even if there were ambiguity on this\n point, it would be resolved by the EPA’s own regulation providing\n that “[d]ischarges of . . . fill material . . . which are regulated under\n section 404” “do not require [EPA §402] permits.” 40 CFR §122.3.\n The agencies have interpreted this regulation to essentially restate\n §402’s text, ibid., and the EPA has confirmed that reading before this\n Court. Because it is not “plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the\n regulation,” the Court accepts the EPA’s interpretation as correct.\n Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461. Thus, the question whether the\n EPA is the proper agency to regulate the slurry discharge depends on\n whether the Corps has authority to do so. If so, the EPA may not\n regulate. Pp. 9–11.\n       (b) Because §404(a) empowers the Corps to “issue permits . . . for\n the discharge of . . . fill material,” and the agencies’ joint regulation\n defines “fill material” to include “slurry . . . or similar mining-related\n materials” having the “effect of . . . [c]hanging the bottom elevation”\n of water, 40 CFR §232.2, the slurry Coeur Alaska wishes to discharge\n into the lake falls well within the Corps’ §404 permitting authority,\n rather than the EPA’s §402 authority. The CWA gives no indication\n that Congress intended to burden industry with the confusing divi\n sion of permitting authority that SEACC’s contrary reading would\n create. Pp. 11–13.\n    2. The Corps acted in accordance with law in issuing the slurry dis\n charge permit to Coeur Alaska. Pp. 13–28.\n       (a) The CWA alone does not resolve these cases. Pp. 14–18.\n         (i) SEACC contends that because the EPA’s performance stan\n dard forbids even minute solid waste discharges, 40 CFR\n §440.104(b)(1), it also forbids Coeur Alaska’s slurry discharge, 30% of\n which is solid waste, into the lake. Thus, says SEACC, the slurry\n discharge is “unlawful” under CWA §306(e), which prohibits “any\n owner . . . of any new source to operate such source in violation of any\n standard of performance applicable to such source.” Pp. 14–16.\n                    Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                       3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n        (ii) Petitioners and the federal agencies counter that CWA\n§404 grants the Corps authority to determine whether to issue a\npermit allowing the slurry discharge without regard to the EPA’s\nnew source performance standard or §306(e)’s prohibition. Pp. 16–18.\n        (iii) The CWA is ambiguous on the question whether §306 ap\nplies to discharges of fill material regulated under §404. On the one\nhand, §306 provides that a discharge that violates an EPA new\nsource performance standard is “unlawful”—without an exception for\nfill material. On the other hand, §404 grants the Corps blanket au\nthority to permit the discharge of fill material—without mentioning\n§306. This tension indicates that Congress has not “directly spoken”\nto the “precise question” at issue. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural\nResources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842. P. 18.\n     (b) Although the agencies’ regulations construing the CWA are\nentitled to deference if they resolve the statutory ambiguity in a rea\nsonable manner, see Chevron, supra, at 842, the regulations bearing\non §§306 and 404, like the CWA itself, do not do so. For example,\neach of the two principal regulations seems to stand on its own with\nout reference to the other. The EPA’s performance standard contains\nno exception for fill material, and it forbids any discharge of “process\nwastewater,” including solid wastes. 40 CFR §440.104(b)(1). The\nagencies’ joint regulation defining fill material includes “slurry or . . .\nsimilar mining-related materials,” §232.2, but contains no exception\nfor slurry regulated by an EPA performance standard. Additional\nregulations noted by the parties offer no basis for reconciliation.\nPp. 18–20.\n     (c) In light of the ambiguities in the CWA and the pertinent regu\nlations, the Court turns to the agencies’ subsequent interpretation of\nthose regulations. Auer, supra, at 461. The question at issue is ad\ndressed and resolved in a reasonable and coherent way by the two\nagencies’ practice and policy, as recited in the EPA’s internal “Regas\nMemorandum” (Memorandum), which explains that the performance\nstandard applies only to the discharge of water from the lake into the\ndownstream creek, and not to the initial discharge of slurry into the\nlake. Though the Memorandum is not subject to sufficiently formal\nprocedures to merit full Chevron deference, the Court defers to it be\ncause it is not “plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regula\ntion[s],” Auer, supra, at 461. Five factors inform that conclusion: The\nMemorandum (1) confines its own scope to closed bodies of water like\nthe lake here, thereby preserving a role for the performance stan\ndards; (2) guards against the possibility of evasion of those standards;\n(3) employs the Corps’ expertise in evaluating the effects of fill mate\nrial on the aquatic environment; (4) does not allow toxic compounds\nto be discharged into navigable waters; and (5) reconciles §§306, 402,\n4           COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n                   CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                            Syllabus \n\n\n    and 404, and the regulations implementing them, better than any of\n    the parties’ alternatives. The Court agrees with the parties that a\n    two-permit regime is contrary to the statute and regulations. Pp. 20–\n    23.\n          (d) The Court rejects SEACC’s contention that the Regas Memo\n    randum is not entitled to deference because it contradicts the agen\n    cies’ published statements and prior practice. Though SEACC cites\n    three such statements, its arguments are not convincing. Pp. 23–28.\n            (i) Although a 1986 memorandum of agreement (MOA) be\n    tween the EPA and the Corps seeking to reconcile their then-differing\n    “fill material” definitions suggests, as SEACC asserts, that §402 will\n    “normally” apply to discharges of “suspended”—i.e., solid—pollutants,\n    that statement is not contrary to the Regas Memorandum, which ac\n    knowledges that the EPA retains authority under §402 to regulate\n    the discharge of suspended solids from the lake into downstream wa\n    ters. The MOA does not address the question presented by these\n    cases, and answered by the Regas Memorandum, and is, in fact, con\n    sistent with the agencies’ determination that the Corps regulates all\n    discharges of fill material and that §306 does not apply to these dis\n    charges. Pp. 23–25.\n            (ii) Despite SEACC’s assertion that the fill regulation’s pream\n    ble demonstrates that the fill rule was not intended to displace the\n    pre-existing froth-flotation gold mine performance standard, the pre\n    amble is consistent with the Regas Memorandum when it explicitly\n    notes that the EPA has “never sought to regulate fill material under\n    effluent guidelines,” 67 Fed. Reg. 31135. If a discharge does not qual\n    ify as fill, the EPA’s new source performance standard applies. If the\n    discharge qualifies as fill, the performance standard does not apply;\n    and there was no earlier agency practice or policy to the contrary.\n    Pp. 25–26.\n            (iii) Remarks made by the two agencies in promulgating the fill\n    regulation, which pledge that the EPA’s “previou[s] . . . determina\n    tion[s]” with regard to the application of performance standards “re\n    main vali[d],” are not conclusive of the question at issue. The Regas\n    Memorandum has followed this policy by applying the performance\n    standard to the discharge of water from the lake into the creek. The\n    remarks do not state that the EPA will apply such standards to dis\n    charges of fill material. Pp. 26–27.\n            (iv) While SEACC cites no instance in which the EPA has ap\n    plied a performance standard to a discharge of fill material, Coeur\n    Alaska cites two instances in which the Corps issued a §404 permit\n    authorizing a mine to discharge solid waste as fill material. These\n    permits illustrate that the agencies did not have a prior practice of\n    applying EPA performance standards to discharges of mining wastes\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

The first is whether\nthe Act gives authority to the United States Army Corps of\nEngineers, or instead to the Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA), to issue a permit for the discharge of min\ning waste, called slurry. The Corps of Engineers has\nissued a permit to petitioner Coeur Alaska, Inc. (Coeur\nAlaska), for a discharge of slurry into a lake in Southeast\nAlaska. The second question is whether, when the Corps\nissued that permit, the agency acted in accordance with\nlaw. We conclude that the Corps was the appropriate\nagency to issue the permit and that the permit is lawful.\n  With regard to the first question, §404(a) of the CWA\n2       COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n               CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\ngrants the Corps the power to “issue permits . . . for the\ndischarge of . . . fill material.” 86 Stat. 884; 33 U. S. C.\n§1344(a). But the EPA also has authority to issue permits\nfor the discharge of pollutants. Section 402 of the Act\ngrants the EPA authority to “issue a permit for the dis\ncharge of any pollutant” “[e]xcept as provided in” §404. 33\nU. S. C. §1342(a). We conclude that because the slurry\nCoeur Alaska wishes to discharge is defined by regulation\nas “fill material,” 40 CFR §232.2 (2008), Coeur Alaska\nproperly obtained its permit from the Corps of Engineers,\nunder §404, rather than from the EPA, under §402.\n   The second question is whether the Corps permit is\nlawful. Three environmental groups, respondents here,\nsued the Corps under the Administrative Procedure Act,\narguing that the issuance of the permit by the Corps was\n“not in accordance with law.” 5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A). The\nenvironmental groups are Southeast Alaska Conservation\nCouncil, Sierra Club, and Lynn Canal Conservation (col\nlectively, SEACC). The State of Alaska and Coeur Alaska\nare petitioners here.\n   SEACC argues that the permit from the Corps is unlaw\nful because the discharge of slurry would violate an EPA\nregulation promulgated under §306(b) of the CWA, 33\nU. S. C. §1316(b). The EPA regulation, which is called a\n“new source performance standard,” forbids mines like\nCoeur Alaska’s from discharging “process wastewater” into\nthe navigable waters. 40 CFR §440.104(b)(1). Coeur\nAlaska, the State of Alaska, and the federal agencies\nmaintain that the Corps permit is lawful nonetheless\nbecause the EPA’s performance standard does not apply to\ndischarges of fill material.\n   Reversing the judgment of the District Court, the Court\nof Appeals held that the EPA’s performance standard\napplies to this discharge so that the permit from the Corps\nis unlawful.\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   Petitioner Coeur Alaska plans to reopen the Kensington\nGold Mine, located some 45 miles north of Juneau, Alaska.\nThe mine has been closed since 1928, but Coeur Alaska\nseeks to make it profitable once more by using a technique\nknown as “froth flotation.” Coeur Alaska will churn the\nmine’s crushed rock in tanks of frothing water. Chemicals\nin the water will cause gold-bearing minerals to float to\nthe surface, where they will be skimmed off.\n   At issue is Coeur Alaska’s plan to dispose of the mixture\nof crushed rock and water left behind in the tanks. This\nmixture is called slurry. Some 30 percent of the slurry’s\nvolume is crushed rock, resembling wet sand, which is\ncalled tailings. The rest is water.\n   The standard way to dispose of slurry is to pump it into\na tailings pond. The slurry separates in the pond. Solid\ntailings sink to the bottom, and water on the surface\nreturns to the mine to be used again.\n   Rather than build a tailings pond, Coeur Alaska pro\nposes to use Lower Slate Lake, located some three miles\nfrom the mine in the Tongass National Forest. This lake\nis small—800 feet at its widest crossing, 2,000 feet at its\nlongest, and 23 acres in area. See App. 138a, 212a.\nThough small, the lake is 51 feet deep at its maximum.\nThe parties agree the lake is a navigable water of the\nUnited States and so is subject to the CWA. They also\nagree there can be no discharge into the lake except as the\nCWA and any lawful permit allow.\n   Over the life of the mine, Coeur Alaska intends to put\n4.5 million tons of tailings in the lake. This will raise the\nlakebed 50 feet—to what is now the lake’s surface—and\nwill increase the lake’s area from 23 to about 60 acres. Id.,\nat 361a (62 acres), 212a (56 acres). To contain this wider,\nshallower body of water, Coeur Alaska will dam the lake’s\ndownstream shore. The transformed lake will be isolated\n4        COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA\n                CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom other surface water. Creeks and stormwater runoff\nwill detour around it. Id., at 298a. Ultimately, lakewater\nwill be cleaned by purification systems and will flow from\nthe lake to a stream and thence onward. Id., at 309a–\n312a.\n                            B\n  Numerous state and federal agencies reviewed and\napproved Coeur Alaska’s plans. At issue here are actions\nby two of those agencies: the Corps of Engineers and the\nEPA.\n                               1\n  The CWA classifies crushed rock as a “pollutant.” 33\nU. S. C. §1362(6). On the one hand, the Act forbids Coeur\nAlaska’s discharge of crushed rock “[e]xcept as in compli\nance” with the Act. CWA §301(a), 33 U. S. C. §1311(a).\nSection 404(a) of the CWA, on the other hand, empowers\nthe Corps to authorize the discharge of “dredged or fill\nmaterial.” 33 U. S. C. §1344(a). The Corps and the EPA\nhave together defined “fill material” to mean any “mate\nrial [that] has the effect of . . . [c]hanging the bottom ele\nvation” of water. 40 CFR §232.2. The agencies have\nfurther defined the “discharge of fill material” to include\n“placement of . . . slurry, or tailings or similar mining\nrelated materials.” Ibid.\n  In these cases the Corps and the EPA agree that the\nslurry meets their regulatory definition of “fill material.”\nOn that premise the Corps evaluated the mine’s plan for a\n§404 permit. After considering the environmental factors\nrequired by §404(b), the Corp issued Coeur Alaska a per\nmit to pump the slurry into Lower Slate Lake. App. 340a–\n378a.\n  In granting the permit the Corps followed the steps set\nforth by §404. Section 404(b) requires the Corps to con\nsider the environmental consequences of every discharge it\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nallows. 33 U. S. C. §1344(b). The Corps must apply guide\nlines written by the EPA pursuant to §404(b). See ibid.;\n40 CFR pt. 230 (EPA guidelines). Applying those guide\nlines here, the Corps determined that Coeur Alaska’s plan\nto use Lower Slate Lake as a tailings pond was the “least\nenvironmentally damaging practicable” way to dispose of\nthe tailings. App. 366a. To conduct that analysis, the\nCorps compared the plan to the proposed alternatives.\n   The Corps determined that the environmental damage\ncaused by placing slurry in the lake will be temporary.\nAnd during that temporary disruption, Coeur Alaska will\ndivert waters around the lake through pipelines built for\nthis purpose. Id., at 298a. Coeur Alaska will also treat\nwater flowing from the lake into downstream waters,\npursuant to strict EPA criteria. Ibid.; see Part I–B–2,\ninfra. Though the slurry will at first destroy the lake’s\nsmall population of common fish, that population may\nlater be replaced. After mining operations are completed,\nCoeur Alaska will help “recla[im]” the lake by “[c]apping”\nthe tailings with about 4 inches of “native material.” App.\n361a; id., at 309a. The Corps concluded that\n    “[t]he reclamation of the lake will result in more\n    emergent wetlands/vegetated shallows with moderate\n    values for fish habitat, nutrient recycling, car\n    bon/detrital export and sediment/toxicant retention,\n    and high values for wildlife habitat.” Id., at 361a.\n   If the tailings did not go into the lake, they would be\nplaced on nearby wetlands. The resulting pile would rise\ntwice as high as the Pentagon and cover three times as\nmany acres. Reply Brief for Petitioner Coeur Alaska 27.\nIf it were chosen, that alternative would destroy dozens of\nacres of wetlands—a permanent loss. App. 365a–366a.\nOn the premise that when the mining ends the lake will\nbe at least as environmentally hospitable, if not more so,\nthan now, the Corps concluded that placing the tailings in\n6        COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n                CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthe lake will cause less damage to the environment than\nstoring them above ground: The reclaimed lake will be\n“more valuable to the aquatic ecosystem than a perma\nnently filled wetland . . . that has lost all aquatic functions\nand values.” Id., at 361a; see also id., at 366a.\n                              2\n   The EPA had the statutory authority to veto the Corps\npermit, and prohibit the discharge, if it found the plan to\nhave “an unacceptable adverse effect on municipal water\nsupplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas . . . , wildlife, or\nrecreational areas.” CWA §404(c), 33 U. S. C. §1344(c).\nAfter considering the Corps findings, the EPA did not veto\nthe Corps permit, even though, in its view, placing the\ntailings in the lake was not the “environmentally prefer\nable” means of disposing of them. App. 300a. By declining\nto exercise its veto, the EPA in effect deferred to the judg\nment of the Corps on this point.\n   The EPA’s involvement extended beyond the agency’s\nveto consideration. The EPA also issued a permit of its\nown—not for the discharge from the mine into the lake but\nfor the discharge from the lake into a downstream creek.\nId., at 287a–331a. Section 402 grants the EPA authority\nto “issue a permit for the discharge of any pollutant,”\n“[e]xcept as provided in [CWA §404].”             33 U. S. C.\n§1342(a). The EPA’s §402 permit authorizes Coeur Alaska\nto discharge water from Lower Slate Lake into the down\nstream creek, subject to strict water-quality limits that\nCoeur Alaska must regularly monitor. App. 303a–304a,\n309a.\n   The EPA’s authority to regulate this discharge comes\nfrom a regulation, termed a “new source performance\nstandard,” that it has promulgated under authority\ngranted to it by §306(b) of the CWA. Section 306(b) gives\nthe EPA authority to regulate the amount of pollutants\nthat certain categories of new sources may discharge into\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe navigable waters of the United States. 33 U. S. C.\n§1316(b). Pursuant to this authority, the EPA in 1982\npromulgated a new source performance standard restrict\ning discharges from new froth-flotation gold mines like\nCoeur Alaska’s. The standard is stringent: It allows “no\ndischarge of process wastewater” from these mines. 40\nCFR §440.104(b)(1).\n   Applying that standard to the discharge of water from\nLower Slate Lake into the downstream creek, the EPA’s\n§402 permit sets strict limits on the amount of pollutants\nthe water may contain. The permit requires Coeur Alaska\nto treat the water using “reverse osmosis” to remove alu\nminum, suspended solids, and other pollutants. App.\n298a; id., at 304a. Coeur Alaska must monitor the water\nflowing from the lake to be sure that the pollutants are\nkept to low, specified minimums. Id., at 326a–330a.\n                               C\n  SEACC brought suit against the Corps of Engineers and\nvarious of its officials in the United States District Court\nfor the District of Alaska. The Corps permit was not in\naccordance with law, SEACC argued, for two reasons.\nFirst, in SEACC’s view, the permit was issued by the\nwrong agency—Coeur Alaska ought to have sought a §402\npermit from the EPA, just as the company did for the\ndischarge of water from the lake into the downstream\ncreek. See Part I–B–2, supra. Second, SEACC contended\nthat regardless of which agency issued the permit, the\ndischarge itself is unlawful because it will violate the EPA\nnew source performance standard for froth-flotation gold\nmines. (This is the same performance standard described\nabove, which the EPA has already applied to the discharge\nof water from the lake into the downstream creek. See\nibid.) SEACC argued that this performance standard also\napplies to the discharge of slurry into the lake. It con\ntended further that the performance standard is a binding\n8        COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n                CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nimplementation of §306. Section 306(e) of the CWA makes\nit “unlawful” for Coeur Alaska to “operate” the mine “in\nviolation of” the EPA’s performance standard. 33 U. S. C.\n§1316(e).\n   Coeur Alaska and the State of Alaska intervened as\ndefendants. Both sides moved for summary judgment.\nThe District Court granted summary judgment in favor of\nthe defendants.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and\nordered the District Court to vacate the Corps of Engi\nneers’ permit. Southeast Alaska Conservation Council v.\nUnited States Army Corps of Engs., 486 F. 3d 638, 654–\n655 (2007). The court acknowledged that Coeur Alaska’s\nslurry “facially meets the Corps’ current regulatory defini\ntion of ‘fill material,’ ” id., at 644, because it would have\nthe effect of raising the lake’s bottom elevation. But the\ncourt also noted that the EPA’s new source performance\nstandard “prohibits discharges from froth-flotation mills.”\nIbid. The Court of Appeals concluded that “[b]oth of the\nregulations appear to apply in this case, yet they are at\nodds.” Ibid. To resolve the conflict, the court turned to\nwhat it viewed as “the plain language of the Clean Water\nAct.” Ibid. The court held that the EPA’s new source\nperformance standard “applies to discharges from the\nfroth-flotation mill at Coeur Alaska’s Kensington Gold\nMine into Lower Slate Lake.” Ibid.\n   In addition to the text of the CWA, the Court of Appeals\nalso relied on the agencies’ statements made when prom\nulgating their current and prior definitions of “fill mate\nrial.” These statements, in the Court of Appeals’ view,\ndemonstrated the agencies’ intent that the EPA’s new\nsource performance standard govern discharges like Coeur\nAlaska’s. Id., at 648–654.\n   The Court of Appeals concluded that Coeur Alaska\nrequired a §402 permit for its slurry discharge, that the\nCorps lacked authority to issue such a permit under §404,\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand that the proposed discharge was unlawful because it\nwould violate the EPA new source performance standard\nand §306(e).\n  The decision of the Court of Appeals in effect reallocated\nthe division of responsibility that the Corps and the EPA\nhad been following. The Court granted certiorari. 554\nU. S. ___ (2008). We now hold that the decision of the\nCourt of Appeals was incorrect.\n                            II\n  The question of which agency has authority to consider\nwhether to permit the slurry discharge is our beginning\ninquiry. We consider first the authority of the EPA and\nsecond the authority of the Corps. Our conclusion is that\nunder the CWA the Corps had authority to determine\nwhether Coeur Alaska was entitled to the permit govern\ning this discharge.\n                           A\n  Section 402 gives the EPA authority to issue “permit[s]\nfor the discharge of any pollutant,” with one important\nexception: The EPA may not issue permits for fill material\nthat fall under the Corps’ §404 permitting authority.\nSection 402(a) states:\n    “Except as provided in . . . [CWA §404, 33 U. S. C.\n    §1344], the Administrator may . . . issue a permit for\n    the discharge of any pollutant, . . . notwithstanding\n    [CWA §301(a), 33 U. S. C. §1311(a)], upon condition\n    that such discharge will meet either (A) all applicable\n    requirements under [CWA §301, 33 U. S. C. §1311(a);\n    CWA §302, 33 U. S. C. §1312; CWA §306, 33 U. S. C.\n    §1316; CWA §307, 33 U. S. C. §1317; CWA §308, 33\n    U. S. C. §1318; CWA §403, 33 U. S. C. §1343], or (B)\n    prior to the taking of necessary implementing actions\n    relating to all such requirements, such conditions as\n    the Administrator determines are necessary to carry\n10       COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n                CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n     out the provisions of this chapter.”       33 U. S. C.\n     §1342(a)(1) (emphasis added).\nSection 402 thus forbids the EPA from exercising permit\nting authority that is “provided [to the Corps] in” §404.\n   This is not to say the EPA has no role with respect to\nthe environmental consequences of fill. The EPA’s func\ntion is different, in regulating fill, from its function in\nregulating other pollutants, but the agency does exercise\nsome authority. Section 404 assigns the EPA two tasks in\nregard to fill material. First, the EPA must write guide\nlines for the Corps to follow in determining whether to\npermit a discharge of fill material. CWA §404(b); 33\nU. S. C. §1344(b). Second, the Act gives the EPA authority\nto “prohibit” any decision by the Corps to issue a permit\nfor a particular disposal site. CWA §404(c); 33 U. S. C.\n§1344(c). We, and the parties, refer to this as the EPA’s\npower to veto a permit.\n   The Act is best understood to provide that if the Corps\nhas authority to issue a permit for a discharge under §404,\nthen the EPA lacks authority to do so under §402.\n   Even if there were ambiguity on this point, the EPA’s\nown regulations would resolve it. Those regulations pro\nvide that “[d]ischarges of dredged or fill material into\nwaters of the United States which are regulated under\nsection 404 of CWA” “do not require [§402] permits” from\nthe EPA. 40 CFR §122.3.\n   In SEACC’s view, this regulation implies that some “fill\nmaterial” discharges are not regulated under §404—else,\nSEACC asks, why would the regulation lack a comma\nbefore the word “which,” and thereby imply that only a\nsubset of “discharges of . . . fill material” are “regulated\nunder section 404.” Ibid.\n   The agencies, however, have interpreted this regulation\notherwise. In the agencies’ view the regulation essentially\nrestates the text of §402, and forbids the EPA from issuing\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npermits for discharges that “are regulated under section\n404.” 40 CFR §122.3(b); cf. CWA §402(a) (“[e]xcept as\nprovided in . . . [§404], the Administrator may . . . issue a\npermit”). Before us, the EPA confirms this reading of the\nregulation. Brief for Federal Respondents 27. The\nagency’s interpretation is not “plainly erroneous or incon\nsistent with the regulation”; and so we accept it as correct.\nAuer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461 (1997) (internal quota\ntion marks omitted).\n   The question whether the EPA is the proper agency to\nregulate the slurry discharge thus depends on whether the\nCorps of Engineers has authority to do so. If the Corps\nhas authority to issue a permit, then the EPA may not do\nso. We turn to the Corps’ authority under §404.\n                               B\n  Section 404(a) gives the Corps power to “issue per\nmits . . . for the discharge of dredged or fill material.” 33\nU. S. C. §1344(a). As all parties concede, the slurry meets\nthe definition of fill material agreed upon by the agencies\nin a joint regulation promulgated in 2002. That regulation\ndefines “fill material” to mean any “material [that] has the\neffect of . . . [c]hanging the bottom elevation” of water—a\ndefinition that includes “slurry, or tailings or similar\nmining-related materials.” 40 CFR §232.2.\n  SEACC concedes that the slurry to be discharged meets\nthe regulation’s definition of fill material. Brief for Re\nspondent SEACC et al. 20. Its concession on this point is\nappropriate because slurry falls well within the central\nunderstanding of the term “fill,” as shown by the examples\ngiven by the regulation. See 40 CFR §232.2 (“Examples of\nsuch fill material include, but are not limited to: rock,\nsand, soil, clay . . . .”). The regulation further excludes\n“trash or garbage” from its definition. Ibid. SEACC ex\npresses a concern that Coeur Alaska’s interpretation of the\nstatute will lead to §404 permits authorizing the dis\n12       COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n                CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\ncharges of other solids that are now restricted by EPA\nstandards. Brief for Respondent SEACC et al. 44–45\n(listing, for example, “feces and uneaten feed,” “ litter, ”\nand waste produced in “battery manufacturing”). But\nthese extreme instances are not presented by the cases\nnow before us. If, in a future case, a discharger of one of\nthese solids were to seek a §404 permit, the dispositive\nquestion for the agencies would be whether the solid at\nissue—for instance, “feces and uneaten feed”—came\nwithin the regulation’s definition of “fill.” SEACC cites no\ninstance in which the agencies have so interpreted their\nfill regulation. If that instance did arise, and the agencies\nwere to interpret the fill regulation as SEACC fears, then\nSEACC could challenge that decision as an unlawful\ninterpretation of the fill regulation; or SEACC could claim\nthat the fill regulation as interpreted is an unreasonable\ninterpretation of §404. The difficulties are not presented\nhere, however, because the slurry meets the regulation’s\ndefinition of fill.\n   Rather than challenge the agencies’ decision to define\nthe slurry as fill, SEACC instead contends that §404\ncontains an implicit exception. According to SEACC, §404\ndoes not authorize the Corps to permit a discharge of fill\nmaterial if that material is subject to an EPA new source\nperformance standard.\n   But §404’s text does not limit its grant of power in this\nway. Instead, §404 refers to all “fill material” without\nqualification.      Nor do the EPA regulations support\nSEACC’s reading of §404. The EPA has enacted guide\nlines, pursuant to §404(b), to guide the Corps permitting\ndecision. 40 CFR pt. 230. Those guidelines do not strip\nthe Corps of power to issue permits for fill in cases where\nthe fill is also subject to an EPA new source performance\nstandard.\n   SEACC’s reading of §404 would create numerous diffi\nculties for the regulated industry. As the regulatory re\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngime stands now, a discharger must ask a simple ques\ntion—is the substance to be discharged fill material or\nnot? The fill regulation, 40 CFR §232.2, offers a clear\nanswer to that question; and under the agencies’ view,\nthat answer decides the matter—if the discharge is fill,\nthe discharger must seek a §404 permit from the Corps; if\nnot, only then must the discharger consider whether any\nEPA performance standard applies, so that the discharger\nrequires a §402 permit from the EPA.\n   Under SEACC’s interpretation, however, the discharger\nwould face a more difficult problem. The discharger would\nhave to ask—is the fill material also subject to one of the\nmany hundreds of EPA performance standards, so that\nthe permit must come from the EPA, not the Corps? The\nstatute gives no indication that Congress intended to\nburden industry with that confusing division of permit\nauthority.\n   The regulatory scheme discloses a defined, and worka\nble, line for determining whether the Corps or the EPA\nhas the permit authority. Under this framework, the\nCorps of Engineers, and not the EPA, has authority to\npermit Coeur Alaska’s discharge of the slurry.\n                            III\n  A second question remains: In issuing the permit did the\nCorps act in violation of a statutory mandate so that the\nissuance was “not in accordance with law”? 5 U. S. C.\n§706(2)(A). SEACC contends that the slurry discharge\nwill violate the EPA’s new source performance standard\nand that the Corps permit is made “unlawful” by CWA\n§306(e). Petitioners and the agencies argue that the per\nmit is lawful because the EPA performance standard, and\n§306(e), do not apply to fill material regulated by the\nCorps. In order to determine whether the Corps permit is\nlawful we must answer the question: Do EPA performance\nstandards, and §306(e), apply to discharges of fill mate\n14      COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n               CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nrial?\n   We address in turn the statutory text of the CWA, the\nagencies’ regulations construing it, and the EPA’s subse\nquent interpretation of those regulations. Because Con\ngress has not “directly spoken” to the “precise question” of\nwhether an EPA performance standard applies to dis\ncharges of fill material, the statute alone does not resolve\nthe case. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources De\nfense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842 (1984). We look\nfirst to the agency regulations, which are entitled to defer\nence if they resolve the ambiguity in a reasonable manner.\nIbid.; see United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 226–\n227 (2001). But the regulations, too, are ambiguous, so we\nnext turn to the agencies’ subsequent interpretation of\nthose regulations. Id., at 234–238; Auer, 519 U. S., at 461.\nIn an internal memorandum the EPA explained that its\nperformance standards do not apply to discharges of fill\nmaterial. That interpretation is not “plainly erroneous or\ninconsistent with the regulation[s],” and so we accept it as\ncorrect. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Though\nSEACC contends that the agencies’ interpretation is not\nentitled to deference because it contradicts the agencies’\npublished statements and prior practice, we disagree with\nSEACC’s reading of those statements and of the regula\ntory record.\n                            A\n  As for the statutory argument, SEACC claims the CWA\n§404 permit is unlawful because §306(e) forbids the slurry\ndischarge. Petitioners and the federal agencies, in con\ntrast, contend that §306(e) does not apply to the slurry\ndischarge.\n                           1\n  To address SEACC’s statutory argument, it is necessary\nto review the EPA’s responsibilities under the CWA. As\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnoted, §306 empowers the EPA to regulate the froth\nflotation gold mining industry. See 33 U. S. C. §1316(b).\nPursuant to this authority, EPA promulgated the new\nsource performance standard relied upon by SEACC. The\nstandard is stringent. If it were to apply here, it would\nallow “no discharge of process wastewater” from the mine.\n40 CFR §440.104(b)(1).\n   The term “process wastewater” includes solid waste. So\nthe regulation forbids not only pollutants that dissolve in\nwater but also solid pollutants suspended in water—what\nthe agency terms “total suspended solids,” or TSS. See\n§440.104(a) (limiting the amount of TSS from other kinds\nof mines); see also EPA Development Document for Efflu\nent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Ore\nMining and Dressing Point Source Category 157–158\n(Nov. 1982) (the amount of TSS in “wastewater” from\nfroth-flotation mines is “generally high”); id., at 175 (Table\nVI–6) (measuring the amounts of TSS in samples of froth\nflotation mines’ discharges); id., at 194 (stating an intent\nto “regulat[e]” TSS); id., at 402 (evaluating the costs of\nconstructing a “settling pond”); id., at 535 (concluding that\neven in mountainous regions, a froth-flotation mine will be\nable to construct a “tailings impoundment” to “provide a\ndisposal area for mill tailings”).\n   Were there any doubt about whether the EPA’s new\nsource performance standard forbade solids as well as\nsoluble pollutants, the agency’s action in these cases\nwould resolve it. Here, the EPA’s §402 permit authorizes\nCoeur Alaska to discharge water from Lower Slate Lake\ninto a downstream creek, provided the water meets the\nquality requirements set by the performance standard.\nThis demonstrates that the performance standard regu\nlates solid waste. The EPA’s permit not only restricts the\namount of total suspended solids, App. 327a (Table 3), but\nalso forbids the mine from allowing any “floating solids” to\nflow from the lake. Id., at 328a. No party disputes the\n16       COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n                CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nEPA’s authority to regulate these discharges of solid min\ning waste; and no party questions the validity of the EPA’s\nnew source performance standard when it is applicable.\n   When the performance standard applies to a point\nsource, §306(e) makes it “unlawful” for that point source to\nviolate it: “[I]t shall be unlawful for any owner or operator\nof any new source to operate such source in violation of\nany standard of performance applicable to such source.”\nCWA §306(e), 33 U. S. C. §1316(e).\n   SEACC argues that this provision, §306(e), forbids the\nmine from discharging slurry into Lower Slate Lake.\nSEACC contends the new source performance standard is,\nin the words of §306(e), “applicable to” the mine. Both the\ntext of the performance standard and the EPA’s applica\ntion of it to the discharge of mining waste from Lower\nSlate Lake demonstrate that the performance standard is\n“applicable to” Coeur Alaska’s mine in some circum\nstances. And so, SEACC reasons, it follows that because\nthe new source performance standard forbids even minute\ndischarges of solid waste, it also forbids the slurry dis\ncharge, 30% of which is solid waste.\n                              2\n  For their part, the State of Alaska and the federal agen\ncies claim that the Act is unambiguous in the opposite\ndirection. They rely on §404 of the Act. As explained\nabove, that section authorizes the Corps of Engineers to\ndetermine whether to issue a permit allowing the dis\ncharge of the slurry. Petitioners and the agencies argue\nthat §404 grants the Corps authority to do so without\nregard to the EPA’s new source performance standard or\nthe §306(e) prohibition discussed above.\n  Petitioners and the agencies make two statutory argu\nments based on §404’s silence in regard to §306. First,\nthey note that nothing in §404 requires the Corps to con\nsider the EPA’s new source performance standard or the\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n§306(e) prohibition. That silence advances the argument\nthat §404’s grant of authority to “issue permits” contra\ndicts §306(e)’s declaration that discharges in violation of\nnew source performance standards are “unlawful.”\n  Second, petitioners and the agencies point to §404(p),\nwhich protects §404 permitees from enforcement actions\nby the EPA or private citizens:\n    “Compliance with a permit issued pursuant to this\n    section . . . shall be deemed compliance, for purposes\n    of sections 1319 [CWA §309] and 1365 [CWA §505] of\n    this title, with sections 1311 [CWA §301], 1317 [CWA\n    §307], and 1343 [CWA §403] of this title.” 33 U. S. C.\n    §1344(p).\nHere again, their argument is that silence is significant.\nSection 404(p) protects the permitee from lawsuits alleg\ning violations of CWA §301 (which bars the discharge of\n“any pollutant” “except as in compliance” with the Act),\n§307 (which bars the discharge of “toxic pollutants”); and\n§403 (which bars discharges into the sea). But §404(p)\ndoes not in express terms protect the permitee from a\nlawsuit alleging a violation of §306(e) or of the EPA’s new\nsource performance standards. Section 404(p)’s silence\nregarding §306 is made even more significant because a\nparallel provision in §402 does protect a §402 permitee\nfrom an enforcement action alleging a violation of §306.\nCWA §402(k), 33 U. S. C. §1342(k).\n   In our view, Congress’ omission of §306 from §404, and\nits inclusion of §306 in §402(k), is evidence that Congress\ndid not intend §306(e) to apply to Corps §404 permits or to\ndischarges of fill material. If §306 did apply, then the\nCorps would be required to evaluate each permit applica\ntion for compliance with §306, and issue a permit only if it\nfound the discharge would comply with §306. But even if\nthat finding were made, it is not clear that the §404 per\nmitee would be protected from a suit seeking a judicial\n18      COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n               CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\ndetermination that the discharge violates §306.\n                               3\n  The CWA is ambiguous on the question whether §306\napplies to discharges of fill material regulated under §404.\nOn the one hand, §306 provides that a discharge that\nviolates an EPA new source performance standard is\n“unlawful”—without any exception for fill material. On\nthe other hand, §404 grants the Corps blanket authority to\npermit the discharge of fill material—without any mention\nof §306. This tension indicates that Congress has not\n“directly spoken” to the “precise question” of whether §306\napplies to discharges of fill material. Chevron, 467 U. S.,\nat 842.\n                             B\n  Before turning to how the agencies have resolved that\nquestion, we consider the formal regulations that bear on\n§§306 and 404. See Mead, 533 U. S., at 234–238. The\nregulations, like the statutes, do not address the question\nwhether §306, and the EPA new source performance stan\ndards promulgated under it, apply to §404 permits and the\ndischarges they authorize. There is no regulation, for\nexample, interpreting §306(e)’s text—“standard of per\nformance applicable to such source”—to mean that a\nperformance standard ceases to be “applicable” the mo\nment the discharge qualifies as fill material, which would\nresolve the cases in petitioners’ favor. Nor is there a\nregulation providing that the Corps, in deciding whether\nto grant a permit under §404, must deny that permit if the\ndischarge would violate §306(e), which would decide the\ncases for SEACC.\n  Rather than address the tension between §§306 and\n404, the regulations instead implement the statutory\nframework without elaboration on this point. Each of the\ntwo principal regulations, which have been mentioned\nabove, seems to stand on its own without reference to the\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nother. The EPA’s new source performance standard con\ntains no exception for fill material; and it forbids any\ndischarge of “process wastewater,” a term that includes\nsolid wastes. 40 CFR §440.104(b)(1); see Part III–A–1,\nsupra. The agencies’ joint regulation defining fill material\nis also unqualified. It includes “slurry, or tailings or simi\nlar mining-related materials” in its definition of a “dis\ncharge of fill material,” 40 CFR §232.2; and it contains no\nexception for slurry that is regulated by an EPA perform\nance standard.\n   The parties point to additional regulations, but these\nprovisions do not offer a clear basis of reconciliation. An\nEPA regulation, mentioned above, provides that\n“[d]ischarges of dredged or fill material into waters of the\nUnited States which are regulated under section 404 of\nCWA” “do not require [§402] permits” from the EPA.\n§122.3. As we have explained, however, this merely states\nthat a permit for this discharge cannot be issued by the\nEPA. See Part II, supra. The regulation does not answer\nthe question whether the EPA’s new source performance\nstandard, and §306(e), apply to a discharge regulated by\nthe Corps under §404.\n   The agencies also direct us to the §404(b) guidelines\nwritten by the EPA to guide the Corps permitting decision.\nSee 40 CFR pt. 230. The agencies note that these guide\nlines do not expressly require the Corps, in issuing a\npermit, to consider whether the discharge would violate\nEPA’s performance standards. Here we think failure to\nmention §306 or the EPA new source performance stan\ndards does offer some indication that these are not rele\nvant to the §404 permit, though the argument falls short\nof being conclusive. The Corps’ own regulations require\nthe agency to evaluate permit applications “for compliance\nwith applicable [EPA] effluent limitations.” 33 CFR\n§320.4(d) (2008). The regulations do not answer whether\nthe new source performance standard is “applicable” to a\n20       COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n                CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\ndischarge of fill material.\n                             C\n  The regulations do not give a definitive answer to the\nquestion whether §306 applies to discharges regulated by\nthe Corps under §404, but we do find that agency interpre\ntation and agency application of the regulations are in\nstructive and to the point. Auer, 519 U. S., at 461. The\nquestion is addressed and resolved in a reasonable and\ncoherent way by the practice and policy of the two agen\ncies, all as recited in a memorandum written in May 2004\nby Diane Regas, then the Director of the EPA’s Office of\nWetlands, Oceans and Watersheds, to Randy Smith, the\nDirector of the EPA’s regional Office of Water with re\nsponsibility over the mine. App. 141a–149a (Regas Memo\nrandum). The Memorandum, though not subject to suffi\nciently formal procedures to merit Chevron deference, see\nMead, supra, at 234–238, is entitled to a measure of defer\nence because it interprets the agencies’ own regulatory\nscheme. See Auer, supra, at 461.\n  The Regas Memorandum explains:\n     “As a result [of the fact that the discharge is regulated\n     under §404], the regulatory regime applicable to dis\n     charges under section 402, including effluent limita\n     tions guidelines and standards, such as those applica\n     ble to gold ore mining . . . do not apply to the\n     placement of tailings into the proposed impoundment\n     [of Lower Slate Lake]. See 40 CFR §122.3(b).” App.\n     144a–145a.\nThe regulation that the Memorandum cites—40 CFR\n§122.3—is one we considered above and found ambiguous.\nThat regulation provides: “[d]ischarges of dredged or fill\nmaterial into waters of the United States which are regu\nlated under section 404 of CWA” “do not require [§402]\npermits.” The Regas Memorandum takes an instructive\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpretive step when it explains that because the dis\ncharge “do[es] not require” an EPA permit, ibid., the\nEPA’s performance standard “do[es] not apply” to the\ndischarge. App. 145a. The Memorandum presents a\nreasonable interpretation of the regulatory regime. We\ndefer to the interpretation because it is not “plainly erro\nneous or inconsistent with the regulation[s].” Auer, supra,\nat 461 (internal quotation marks omitted). Five factors\ninform that conclusion.\n  First, the Memorandum preserves a role for the EPA’s\nperformance standard. It confines the Memorandum’s\nscope to closed bodies of water, like the lake here. App.\n142a–143a, n. 1. When slurry is discharged into a closed\nbody of water, the Memorandum explains, the EPA’s\nperformance standard retains an important role in regu\nlating the discharge into surrounding waters. The Memo\nrandum does not purport to invalidate the EPA’s perform\nance standard.\n  Second, the Memorandum acknowledges that this is not\nan instance in which the discharger attempts to evade the\nrequirements of the EPA’s performance standard. The\nKensington Mine is not, for example, a project that smug\ngles a discharge of EPA-regulated pollutants into a sepa\nrate discharge of Corps-regulated fill material. The in\nstant cases do not present a process or plan designed to\nmanipulate the outer boundaries of the definition of “fill\nmaterial” by labeling minute quantities of EPA-regulated\nsolids as fill. The Memorandum states that when a dis\ncharge has only an “incidental filling effect,” the EPA’s\nperformance standard continues to govern that discharge.\nId., at 145a.\n  Third, the Memorandum’s interpretation preserves the\nCorps’ authority to determine whether a discharge is in\nthe public interest. See 33 CFR §320.4(a)(1); 40 CFR\n§230.10. The Corps has significant expertise in making\nthis determination. Applying it, the Corps determined\n22      COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n               CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthat placing slurry in the lake will improve that body of\nwater by making it wider, shallower, and so more capable\nof sustaining aquatic life. The Corps determined, fur\nthermore, that the alternative—a heap of tailings larger\nthan the Pentagon placed upon wetlands—would cause\nmore harm to the environment. Because the Memoran\ndum preserves an important role for the Corps’ expertise,\nits conclusion that the EPA’s performance standard does\nnot apply is a reasonable one.\n   Fourth, the Regas Memorandum’s interpretation does\nnot allow toxic pollutants (as distinguished from other,\nless dangerous pollutants, such as slurry) to enter the\nnavigable waters. The EPA has regulated toxic pollutants\nunder a separate provision, §307 of the CWA, and the\nEPA’s §404(b) guidelines require the Corps to deny a §404\npermit for any discharge that would violate the EPA’s\n§307 toxic-effluent limitations. 40 CFR §230.10(b)(2).\n   Fifth, as a final reason to defer to the Regas Memoran\ndum, we find it a sensible and rational construction that\nreconciles §§306, 402, and 404, and the regulations im\nplementing them, which the alternatives put forward by\nthe parties do not. SEACC’s argument, that §402 applies\nto this discharge and not §404, is not consistent with the\nstatute and regulations, as already noted. See Part II,\nsupra.\n   The Court requested the parties to submit supplemental\nbriefs addressing whether the CWA contemplated that\nboth agencies would issue a permit for a discharge. 556\nU. S. ___ (2009). A two-permit regime would allow the\nEPA to apply its performance standard, while the Corps\ncould apply its §404(b) criteria. The parties agree, how\never, that a two-permit regime is contrary to the statute\nand the regulations. We conclude that this is correct. A\ntwo-permit regime would cause confusion, delay, expense,\nand uncertainty in the permitting process. In agreement\nwith all of the parties, we conclude that, when a permit is\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequired to discharge fill material, either a §402 or a §404\npermit is necessary. Here, we now hold, §404 applies, not\n§402. See Part II, supra.\n  The Regas Memorandum’s interpretation of the agen\ncies’ regulations is consistent with the regulatory scheme\nas a whole. The Memorandum preserves a role for the\nEPA’s performance standards; it guards against the possi\nbility of evasion of those standards; it employs the Corps’\nexpertise in evaluating the effects of fill material on the\naquatic environment; it does not allow toxic pollutants to\nbe discharged; and we have been offered no better way to\nharmonize the regulations. We defer to the EPA’s conclu\nsion that its performance standard does not apply to the\ninitial discharge of slurry into the lake but applies only to\nthe later discharge of water from the lake into the down\nstream creek.\n                            D\n   SEACC argues against deference to the Regas Memo\nrandum. In its view the Regas Memorandum is contrary\nto published agency statements and earlier agency prac\ntice. SEACC cites three agency statements: A 1986\n“memorandum of understanding” between the EPA and\nthe Corps regarding the definition of fill material; the\npreamble to the agencies’ current 2002 fill regulation; and\ncomments made by the agencies in promulgating the 2002\nfill regulation. These arguments are not convincing.\n                             1\n   In 1986, to reconcile their then-differing definitions of\n“fill material,” the EPA and the Corps issued a “memoran\ndum of agreement.” 51 Fed. Reg. 8871 (MOA). The\nmemorandum was not made subject to notice-and\ncomment procedures, but it was published in the Federal\nRegister. It defined the statutory term “fill material” until\nthe current definition took effect in 2002. Brief for Fed\n24       COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n                CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\neral Respondents 30–31, n. 8.\n  SEACC points to paragraph B(5) of the MOA, which\nreads:\n     “[A] pollutant (other than dredged material) will nor\n     mally be considered by EPA and the Corps to be sub\n     ject to section 402 if it is a discharge in liquid, semi\n     liquid, or suspended form or if it is a discharge of solid\n     material of a homogeneous nature normally associ\n     ated with single industry wastes . . . . These materials\n     include placer mining wastes, phosphate mining\n     wastes, titanium mining wastes, sand and gravel\n     wastes, fly ash, and drilling muds. As appropriate,\n     EPA and the Corps will identify additional such mate\n     rials.” 51 Fed. Reg. 8872.\nIt is true, as SEACC notes, that this passage suggests that\n§402 will “normally” apply to discharges of “suspended”—\ni.e., solid—pollutants. But that statement is not contrary\nto the Regas Memorandum, which acknowledges that the\nEPA retains authority under §402 to regulate the dis\ncharge of suspended solids from Lower Slate Lake into\ndownstream waters. This passage does not address the\nquestion presented by these cases, and answered by the\nRegas Memorandum, as to whether the EPA’s perform\nance standard applies when the discharge qualifies as fill\nmaterial. In fact, the MOA’s preamble suggests that when\na discharge qualifies as “fill material,” the Corps retains\nauthority to regulate it under §404:\n     “Discharges listed in the Corps definition of ‘discharge\n     of fill material,’ . . . remain subject to section 404 even\n     if they occur in association with discharges of wastes\n     meeting the criteria in the agreement for section 402\n     discharges.” Id., at 8871.\n  The MOA is quite consistent with the agencies’ determi\nnation that the Corps regulates all discharges of fill mate\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           25\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrial and that §306 does not apply to these discharges.\n                               2\n   SEACC draws our attention to the preamble of the\ncurrent fill material regulation. 67 Fed. Reg. 31129 (2002)\n(final rule). It cites the opening passages of the preamble,\nwhich state:\n    “[T]oday’s rule is generally consistent with current\n    agency practice and so it does not expand the types of\n    discharges that will be covered under section 404.”\n    Id., at 31133.\nIn SEACC’s view, this passage demonstrates that the fill\nrule was not intended to displace the pre-existing froth\nflotation gold mine performance standard, which has been\non the books since 1982.\n   The preamble goes on to say, in a section entitled “Efflu\nent Guideline Limitations and 402 Permits”:\n    “[W]e emphasize that today’s rule generally is in\n    tended to maintain our existing approach to regulat\n    ing pollutants under either section 402 or 404 of the\n    CWA. Effluent limitation guidelines and new source\n    performance standards (‘effluent guidelines’) promul\n    gated under section 304 and 306 of the CWA establish\n    limitations and standards for specified wastestreams\n    from industrial categories, and those limitations and\n    standards are incorporated into permits issued under\n    section 402 of the Act. EPA has never sought to regu\n    late fill material under effluent guidelines. Rather,\n    effluent guidelines restrict discharges of pollutants\n    from identified wastestreams based upon the pollut\n    ant reduction capabilities of available treatment tech\n    nologies. Recognizing that some discharges (such as\n    suspended or settleable solids) can have the associ\n    ated effect, over time, of raising the bottom elevation\n    of a water due to settling of waterborne pollutants, we\n26       COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n                CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n     do not consider such pollutants to be ‘fill material,’\n     and nothing in today’s rule changes that view. Nor\n     does today’s rule change any determination we have\n     made regarding discharges that are subject to an ef\n     fluent limitation guideline and standards, which will\n     continue to be regulated under section 402 of the\n     CWA. Similarly, this rule does not alter the manner\n     in which water quality standards currently apply un\n     der the section 402 or the section 404 programs.” Id.,\n     at 31135.\nAlthough the preamble asserts it does not change agency\npolicy with regard to EPA performance standards and\n§402 permitting decisions, it is explicit in noting that the\nEPA has “never sought to regulate fill material under\neffluent guidelines.” Ibid. The preamble, then, is consis\ntent with the Regas Memorandum. If a discharge does not\nqualify as fill material, the EPA’s new source performance\nstandard applies. If the discharge qualifies as fill, the\nperformance standard does not apply; and there was no\nearlier agency practice or policy to the contrary.\n                             3\n  SEACC also cites remarks made by the agencies in\nresponse to public comments on the proposed fill material\nregulation. App. 22a–127a. These remarks were incorpo\nrated by reference into the administrative record. 67 Fed.\nReg. 31131.\n  Responding to a question about whether “mine tailings”\nwould be “subject to section 404 regulation as opposed to\nsection 402” under the 2002 fill regulation, the agencies\nstated:\n     “Today’s final rule clarifies that any material that has\n     the effect of fill is regulated under section 404 and\n     further that the placement of ‘overburden, slurry, or\n     tailings or similar mining-related materials’ is consid\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          27\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    ered a discharge of fill material. Nevertheless, if EPA\n    has previously determined that certain materials are\n    subject to an [effluent limitation guideline] under spe\n    cific circumstances, then that determination remains\n    valid. Moreover, . . . permits issued pursuant to sec\n    tion 402 are intended to regulate process water and\n    provide effluent limits that are protective of receiving\n    water quality. This distinction provides the frame\n    work for today’s rule.” App. 48a.\nThis statement is not conclusive of the issue. SEACC\nnotes that this response, like the regulation’s preamble,\npledges that EPA’s “previou[s] . . . determination[s]” with\nregard to the application of performance standards “re\nmai[n] valid.” But, as noted above, the Regas Memoran\ndum has followed this policy by applying the EPA’s per\nformance standard to the discharge of water from the lake\ninto the downstream creek. The response does not state\nthat the EPA will apply its performance standards to\ndischarges of fill material.\n                             4\n   The agencies’ published statements indicate adherence\nto the EPA’s previous application and interpretation of its\nperformance standards. SEACC cannot show that the\nagencies have changed their interpretation or application\nof their regulations.\n   SEACC cites no instance in which the EPA has applied\none of its performance standards to a discharge of fill\nmaterial. By contrast, Coeur Alaska cites two instances in\nwhich the Corps issued a §404 permit authorizing a mine\nto discharge solid waste (tailings) as fill material. See\nBrief for Petitioner Coeur Alaska 40–42. SEACC objects\nthat those two §404 permits authorized discharges that\nused the tailings to construct useful structures—a dam in\none case, a tailings pond in another. Here, by contrast,\nSEACC contends that the primary purpose of the dis\n28      COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n               CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\ncharge is to use a navigable water to dispose of waste.\nIbid. But that objection misses the point. The two §404\npermits cited by Coeur Alaska illustrate that the agencies\ndid not have a prior practice of applying EPA performance\nstandards to discharges of mining wastes that qualify as\nfill material.\n   SEACC has not demonstrated that the agencies have\nchanged their policy, and it cannot show that the Regas\nMemorandum is contrary to the agencies’ published\nstatements.\n                         *    *   *\n  We accord deference to the agencies’ reasonable decision\nto continue their prior practice.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and\nthese cases are remanded for further proceedings consis\ntent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

S. C. §1344(a), or as a “pollutant,” subject to §§402 and\n306, 33 U. S. C. §§1342(a), 1316(a). Within this zone, the\nlaw authorizes the environmental agencies to classify\nmaterial as the one or the other, so long as they act within\nthe bounds of relevant regulations, and provided that the\nclassification, considered in terms of the purposes of the\nstatutes and relevant regulations, is reasonable.\n  This approach reflects the difficulty of applying §§402\nand 306 literally to every new-source-related discharge of a\n“pollutant.” The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\napplies §306 new source “performance standards” to a\nwide variety of discharges, ranging, for example, from\n2        COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n                CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                   BREYER, J., concurring\n\n\nthose involved in the processing of apples into apple juice\nor apple cider, 40 CFR §407.10 (2008); to the manufactur\ning of cement, §411.10; to the production of fresh meat\ncuts by a meat cutter, §432.60; and to the manufacture of\npharmaceutical products by fermentation, §439.10. See\ngenerally 40 CFR pts. 405–471 (containing more than 800\npages of “new source performance” and effluent limitation\nregulations). At the same time the regulations for any one\npoint source often regulate numerous chemicals, minerals,\nand other substances produced by that point source; in the\ncase of fermentation products, for example, the regulations\nprovide performance standards for roughly 30 different\nchemicals. §439.15. These “standards of performance”\n“reflect the greatest degree of effluent reduction which the\nAdministrator determines to be achievable through appli\ncation of the best available demonstrated control technol\nogy . . . including, where practicable, a standard permit\nting no discharge of pollutants.” 33 U. S. C. §1316(a)(1).\n   To literally apply these performance standards so as to\nforbid the use of any of these substances as “fill,” even\nwhen, say, they constitute no more than trace elements in\ndirt, crushed rock, or sand that is clearly being used as\n“fill” to build a levee or to replace dirt removed from a lake\nbottom may prove unnecessarily strict, cf. §1362(6) (defin\ning “pollutant” to include “rock”), to the point that such\napplication would undermine the objective of §404, which\nforesees the use of “dredged or fill material” in certain\ncircumstances and with approval of the relevant agencies.\n§1344. At minimum, the EPA might reasonably read the\nstatute and the applicable regulations as allowing the use\nof such material, say crushed rock, as “fill” in some of\nthese situations. Cf. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural\nResources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842–844\n(1984); Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.

Post, at 7 (dissenting opinion).\n   Yet there are safeguards against that occurring. For\none thing, as the Court recognizes, see ante, at 11, it is not\nthe case that any material that has the “ ‘effect of . . .\n[c]hanging the bottom elevation’ ” of the body of water is\nautomatically subject to §404, not §402. The EPA has\nnever suggested that it would interpret the regulations so\nas to turn §404 into a loophole, permitting evasion of a\n“performance standard” simply because a polluter dis\ncharges enough pollutant to raise the bottom elevation of\nthe body of water. For another thing, even where a matter\nis determined reasonably to be “fill” and consequently falls\nwithin §404, the EPA can retain an important role in the\npermitting process. That is because the EPA may veto\nany §404 plan that it finds has an “unacceptable adverse\neffect on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and\nfishery areas . . . , wildlife, or recreational areas.”\n§1344(c). Finally, EPA’s decision not to apply §306, but to\nallow permitting to proceed under §404, must be a reason\nable decision; and court review will help assure that is so.\n5 U. S. C. §706.\n   In these cases, it seems to me that the EPA’s interpreta\ntion of the statute as permitting the EPA/Corps of Engi\nneers “fill” definition to apply to the cases at hand is rea\nsonable, hence lawful. Lower Slate Lake, located roughly\nthree miles from the Kensington Gold Mine, is 51 feet\ndeep, 800 feet wide, and 2,000 feet long; downstream from\nthe lake is Slate Creek. Faced with a difficult choice\nbetween creating a huge pile of slurry on nearby wetlands\nor using part of the lake as a storage facility for mine\ntailings, see App. 294a–298a; see also ante, at 5–8, the\n4        COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n                CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                   BREYER, J., concurring\n\n\nEPA arrived at a compromise. On the one hand, it would\ntreat mine tailings placed directly into the lake as “fill”\nunder the §404 permitting program. App. 144a. The\ntailings, the EPA recognized, would have the “immediate\neffect of filling the areas of water into which they are\ndischarged.” Ibid. But it would also treat any spillover of\nthe tailings, or chemicals from the tailings, into any\nnearby waterway, most particularly Slate Creek (running\nout of Slate Lake) as requiring a §402 permit. The EPA’s\n§306 “performance standard” would apply and that stan\ndard insists upon no discharge of process wastewater at\nall. Id., at 145a; see also 40 CFR §440.104(b). The EPA\nreached this result because it recognized that, even though\npollutants discharged into the creek might come “in the\nform of suspended and settleable solids,” such solids would\n“have, at most, an incidental filling effect.” App. 145a.\nThe EPA thereby sought to apply the distinction it had\npreviously recognized between discharges that have the\nimmediate effect of raising the bottom elevation of water,\nand those that only have the “associated effect, over time,\nof raising the bottom elevation of a water due to settling of\nwaterborne pollutants.” See 67 Fed. Reg. 31135 (2002)\n(concluding that §402 applies to the latter); see also Brief\nfor G. Tracy Mehan III as Amicus Curiae 22–23.\n   I cannot say whether the EPA’s compromise represents\nthe best overall environmental result; but I do believe it\namounts to the kind of detailed decision that the statutes\ndelegate authority to the EPA, not the courts, to make\n(subject to the bounds of reasonableness).

See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natu\nral Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984).\nThe opinion purports to give this agency interpretation “a\nmeasure of deference” because it involves an interpretation\nof “the agencies’ own regulatory scheme,” and “ ‘the regu-\nlatory regime,’ ” ante, at 20 (citing Auer v. Robbins, 519\n2           COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA \n\n                   CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J. \n\n\nU. S. 452, 461 (1997)). Auer, however, stands only for the\nprinciple that we defer to an agency’s interpretation of its\nown ambiguous regulation. But it becomes obvious from\nthe ensuing discussion that the referenced “regulatory\nscheme,” and “regulatory regime” for which the Court\naccepts the agency interpretation includes not just the\nagencies’ own regulations but also (and indeed primarily)\nthe conformity of those regulations with the ambiguous\ngoverning statute, which is the primary dispute here.\n   Surely the Court is not adding to our already inscruta\nble opinion in United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218\n(2001), the irrational fillip that an agency position which\notherwise does not qualify for Chevron deference does\nreceive Chevron deference if it clarifies not just an am\nbiguous statute but also an ambiguous regulation. One\nmust conclude, then, that if today’s opinion is not accord\ning the agencies’ reasonable and authoritative interpreta\ntion of the Clean Water Act Chevron deference, it is ac\ncording some new type of deference—perhaps to be called\nin the future Coeur Alaska deference—which is identical\nto Chevron deference except for the name.\n   The Court’s deference to the EPA and the Corps of\nEngineers in today’s cases is eminently reasonable. It is\nquite impossible to achieve predictable (and relatively\nlitigation-free) administration of the vast body of complex\nlaws committed to the charge of executive agencies with\nout the assurance that reviewing courts will accept rea\nsonable and authoritative agency interpretation of am\nbiguous provisions. If we must not call that practice\nChevron deference, then we have to rechristen the rose.\nOf course the only reason a new name is required is our\nmisguided opinion in Mead, whose incomprehensible\ncriteria for Chevron deference have produced so much\nconfusion in the lower courts* that there has now appeared\n——————\n    * Compare, e.g., Kruse v.

The “tailings slurry” would contain concentrations of\naluminum, copper, lead, and mercury. Over the life of the\nmine, roughly 4.5 million tons of solid tailings would enter\nthe lake, raising the bottom elevation by 50 feet. It is\nundisputed that the discharge would kill all of the lake’s\nfish and nearly all of its other aquatic life.1\n   Coeur Alaska’s proposal is prohibited by the Environ\nmental Protection Agency (EPA) performance standard\n——————\n  1 Whether  aquatic life will eventually be able to inhabit the lake\nagain is uncertain.

Section 306 of the\nClean Water Act directs EPA to promulgate such perform\nance standards, 33 U. S. C. §1316(a), and declares it\nunlawful for any discharger to violate them, §1316(e).\nOrdinarily, that would be the end of the inquiry.\n   Coeur Alaska contends, however, that its discharge is\nnot subject to EPA’s regulatory regime, but is governed,\ninstead, by the mutually exclusive permitting authority of\nthe Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps has authority,\nunder §404 of the Act, §1344(a), to issue permits for dis\ncharges of “dredged or fill material.” By regulation, a\ndischarge that has the effect of raising a water body’s\nbottom elevation qualifies as “fill material.” See 33 CFR\n§323.2(e) (2008). Discharges properly within the Corps’\npermitting authority, it is undisputed, are not subject to\nEPA performance standards. See ante, at 20; Brief for\nPetitioner Coeur Alaska 26; Brief for Respondent South\neast Alaska Conservation Council et al. 37.\n   The litigation before the Court thus presents a single\nquestion: Is a pollutant discharge prohibited under §306 of\nthe Act eligible for a §404 permit as a discharge of fill\nmaterial? In agreement with the Court of Appeals, I\nwould answer no. The statute’s text, structure, and pur\npose all mandate adherence to EPA pollution-control\nrequirements. A discharge covered by a performance\nstandard must be authorized, if at all, by EPA.\n                              I\n\n                             A\n\n  Congress enacted the Clean Water Act in 1972 “to re\nstore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological\nintegrity” of the waters of the United States. 33 U. S. C.\n§1251(a). “The use of any river, lake, stream or ocean as a\nwaste treatment system,” the Act’s drafters stated, “is\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

Congress\nannounced in the Act itself an ambitious objective: to\neliminate, by 1985, the discharge of all pollutants into the\nNation’s navigable waters. 33 U. S. C. §1251(a).\n   In service of its goals, Congress issued a core command:\n“[T]he discharge of any pollutant by any person shall be\nunlawful,” except in compliance with the Act’s terms.\n§1311(a). The Act’s substantive requirements—housed\nprimarily in Subchapter III, “Standards and Enforce\nment”—establish “a comprehensive regulatory program\nsupervised by an expert administrative agency,” EPA.\nMilwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U. S. 304, 317 (1981). See also\n33 U. S. C. §1251(d) (“Except as otherwise expressly pro\nvided . . . , the Administrator of [EPA] shall administer\nthis [Act].”).\n   The Act instructs EPA to establish various technology\nbased, increasingly stringent effluent limitations for cate\ngories of point sources. E.g., §§1311, 1314. These limita\ntions, formulated as restrictions “on quantities, rates, and\nconcentrations of chemical, physical, biological, and other\nconstituents,” §1362(11), were imposed to achieve national\nuniformity among categories of sources. See, e.g., E. I. du\nPont de Nemours & Co. v. Train, 430 U. S. 112, 129–130\n(1977). The limitations for a given discharge depend on\nthe type of pollutant and source at issue.2\n   Of key importance, new sources must meet stringent\n“standards of performance” adopted by EPA under §306.\nThat section makes it “unlawful for any . . . new source to\noperate . . . in violation of” an applicable performance\n——————\n  2 In addition, the Act requires States to institute comprehensive wa\n\nter quality standards for intrastate waters, subject to EPA approval.\nSee §1313. This program supplements the technology-based standards,\nserving to “prevent water quality from falling below acceptable levels”\neven when point sources comply with effluent limitations.

In line\nwith Congress’ aim “to insure . . .‘maximum feasible con\ntrol of new sources,’ ” du Pont, 430 U. S., at 138, the pre\nferred standard for a new source is one “ ‘permitting no\ndischarge of pollutants,’ ” id., at 137–138 (quoting 33\nU. S. C. §1316(a)(1) (emphasis added)). Moreover, new\nsources, unlike existing sources, are not eligible for EPA\ngranted variances from applicable limitations. 430 U. S.,\nat 138.3\n  In 1982, EPA promulgated new source performance\nstandards for facilities engaged in mining, including those\nusing a froth-flotation milling process. See Ore Mining\nand Dressing Point Source Category Effluent Limitations\nGuidelines and New Source Performance Standards, 47\nFed. Reg. 54598 (1982). Existing mills, the Agency found,\nwere already achieving zero discharge; it was therefore\npracticable, EPA concluded, for new mills to do as well.\nId., at 54602. Accordingly, under 40 CFR §440.104(b)(1),\nnew mines using the froth-flotation method, as Coeur\nAlaska proposes to do, may not discharge wastewater\ndirectly into waters of the United States.\n                             B\n  The nationwide pollution-control requirements just\ndescribed are implemented through the National Pollution\nDischarge Elimination System (NPDES), a permitting\nscheme set forth in §402 and administered by EPA and the\nStates. The NPDES is the linchpin of the Act, for it trans\nforms generally applicable effluent limitations into the\nindividual obligations of each discharger. EPA v. Califor\n——————\n   3 Even the provision allowing the President to exempt federal instal\n\nlations from compliance with the Act’s requirements—“if he determines\nit to be in the paramount interest of the United States to do so”—does\nnot extend to new source standards: “[N]o exemption may be granted\nfrom the requirements of section [306] or [307] of this [Act].” 33\nU.

S.\n200, 205 (1976). The discharge of a pollutant is generally\nprohibited unless the source has obtained a NPDES per\nmit. E.g., EPA v. National Crushed Stone Assn., 449 U. S.\n64, 71 (1980) (“Section 402 authorizes the establishment of\nthe [NPDES], under which every discharger of pollutants\nis required to obtain a permit.”).\n   The Act also establishes a separate permitting scheme,\nadministered by the Corps, for discharges of “dredged or\nfill material.” 33 U. S. C. §1344(a). Section 404 hews to\nthe Corps’ established expertise in matters of navigability\nand construction. The §404 program does not implement\nthe uniform, technology-based pollution-control standards\nset out, inter alia, in §306. Instead, §404 permits are\nsubject to regulatory guidelines based generally on the\nimpact of a discharge on the receiving environment. See\n§1344(b); ante, at 4–5.\n   As the above-described statutory background indicates,\nCoeur Alaska’s claim to a §404 permit carries weighty\nimplications. If eligible for that permit, Coeur Alaska can\nevade the exacting performance standard prescribed by\nEPA for froth-flotation mills. It may, instead, use Lower\nSlate Lake “as the settling pond and disposal site for the\ntailings.” App. 360a (Corps’ Record of Decision).\n                             II\n  Is a pollutant discharge prohibited under §306(e) eligi\nble to receive a §404 permit as a discharge of fill material?\nAll agree on preliminary matters. Only one agency, the\nCorps or EPA, can issue a permit for the discharge. See\nante, at 10, 22. Only EPA, through the NPDES program,\nissues permits that implement §306. See supra, at 2.\nFurther, §306(e) and EPA’s froth-flotation performance\nstandard, unless inapplicable here, bar Coeur Alaska’s\nproposed discharge. See ante, at 14–15.\n  No part of the statutory scheme, in my view, calls into\n6        COEUR ALASKA, INC. v. SOUTHEAST ALASKA\n                CONSERVATION COUNCIL\n                  GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nquestion the governance of EPA’s performance standard.\nThe text of §306(e) states a clear proscription: “[I]t shall be\nunlawful for any owner or operator of any new source to\noperate such source in violation of any standard of per\nformance applicable to such source.” 33 U. S. C. §1316(e).\nUnder the standard of performance relevant here, “there\nshall be no discharge of process wastewater to navigable\nwaters from mills that use the froth-flotation process” for\nmining gold. 40 CFR §440.104(b)(1). The Act imposes\nthese requirements without qualification.\n   Section 404, stating that the Corps “may issue permits”\nfor the discharge of “dredged or fill material,” does not\ncreate an exception to §306(e)’s plain command. 33\nU. S. C. §1344(a). Cf. ante, at 12. Section 404 neither\nmentions §306 nor states a contrary requirement. The Act\ncan be home to both provisions, with no words added or\nomitted, so long as the category of “dredged or fill mate\nrial” eligible for a §404 permit is read in harmony with\n§306. Doing so yields a simple rule: Discharges governed\nby EPA performance standards are subject to EPA’s ad\nministration and receive permits under the NPDES, not\n§404.\n   This reading accords with the Act’s structure and objec\ntives. It retains, through the NPDES, uniform application\nof the Act’s core pollution-control requirements, and it\nrespects Congress’ special concern for new sources. Leav\ning pollution-related decisions to EPA, moreover, is consis\ntent with Congress’ delegation to that agency of primary\nresponsibility to administer the Act. Most fundamental,\nadhering to §306(e)’s instruction honors the overriding\nstatutory goal of eliminating water pollution, and Con\ngress’ particular rejection of the use of navigable waters as\nwaste disposal sites. See supra, at 2–3. See also 33\nU. S. C. §1324 (creating “clean lakes” program requiring\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

A\ndischarge of a pollutant, otherwise prohibited by firm\nstatutory command, becomes lawful if it contains suffi\ncient solid matter to raise the bottom of a water body,\ntransformed into a waste disposal facility. Whole catego\nries of regulated industries can thereby gain immunity\nfrom a variety of pollution-control standards. The loophole\nwould swallow not only standards governing mining ac\ntivities, see 40 CFR pt. 440 (effluent limitations and new\nsource performance standards for ore mining and dress\ning); id., pt. 434 (coal mining); id., pt. 436 (mineral min\ning), but also standards for dozens of other categories of\nregulated point sources, see, e.g., id., pt. 411 (cement\n——————\n  4 The   Court asserts that “numerous difficulties” will ensue if a dis\ncharge governed by a new source performance standard is ineligible for\na §404 permit. Ante, at 12. Namely, the Court notes, the discharger\nwill have to determine whether a performance standard applies to it.\nAnte, at 13. That is not only the usual inquiry under the Clean Water\nAct; it is one Coeur Alaska answered, without apparent difficulty, when\nit sought and obtained an EPA permit for the proposed discharge from\nthe lake into a downstream creek. See ante, at 6.\n   JUSTICE BREYER fears that “litera[l] appl[ication]” of performance\nstandards would interfere with efforts “to build a levee or to replace\ndirt removed from a lake bottom,” and thus “may prove unnecessarily\nstrict.” Ante, at 2 (concurring opinion). His concerns are imaginative,\nbut it is questionable whether they are real. Apple juice processors,\nmeatcutters, cement manufacturers, and pharmaceutical producers do\nnot ordinarily build levees—and it is almost inconceivable that they\nwould do so using the waste generated by their highly specific indus\ntrial processes. See, e.g., 40 CFR §411.10 (performance standard for\nparticular cement manufacturing process). Levee construction gener\nally is undertaken by developers or government, entities not subject to\nperformance standards for such a project. This litigation, furthermore,\ndoes not illustrate the “difficulty” JUSTICE BREYER perceives. See ante,\nat 1. Coeur Alaska does not seek to build a levee or return dirt to a\nlake; it simply wants to use Lower Slate Lake as a waste disposal site.\n8         COEUR ALASKA, INC. v.

Providing an escape\nhatch for polluters whose discharges contain solid matter,\nit bears noting, is particularly perverse; the Act specifi\ncally focuses on solids as harmful pollutants. See 33\nU.

American Trucking\nAssns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 467–468 (2001). Yet an altera\ntion of that kind is just what today’s decision imagines.\nCongress, as the Court reads the Act, silently upended, in\nan ancillary permitting provision, its painstaking pollu\ntion-control scheme. See ante, at 17. Congress did so, the\nCourt holds, notwithstanding the lawmakers’ stated effort\n“to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and bio\nlogical integrity” of the waters of the United States, 33\n——————\n  5 The “safeguards” JUSTICE BREYER identifies are hardly reassuring.\n\nSee ante, at 3 (concurring opinion).

Nor is EPA’s veto power under\n§404(c) of the Clean Water Act an adequate substitute for adherence to\n§306. That power—exercised only a dozen times over 36 years encom\npassing more than one million permit applications, see Brief for Ameri\ncan Rivers 14—hinges on a finding of “unacceptable adverse effect,” 33\nU.
