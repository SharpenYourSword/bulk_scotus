A.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 08–305.      Argued April 28, 2009—Decided June 22, 2009\nAfter a private specialist diagnosed respondent with learning disabili\n  ties, his parents unilaterally removed him from petitioner public\n  school district (School District), enrolled him in a private academy,\n  and requested an administrative hearing on his eligibility for special\n  education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education\n  Act (IDEA), 20 U. S. C. §1400 et seq. The School District found re\n  spondent ineligible for such services and declined to offer him an in\n  dividualized education program (IEP). Concluding that the School\n  District had failed to provide respondent a “free appropriate public\n  education” as required by IDEA, §1412(a)(1)(A), and that respon\n  dent’s private-school placement was appropriate, the hearing officer\n  ordered the School District to reimburse his parents for his private\n  school tuition. The District Court set aside the award, holding that\n  the IDEA Amendments of 1997 (Amendments) categorically bar re\n  imbursement unless a child has “previously received special educa\n  tion or related services under the [school’s] authority.”\n  §1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). Reversing, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the\n  Amendments did not diminish the authority of courts to grant reim\n  bursement as “appropriate” relief pursuant to §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii). See\n  School Comm. of Burlington v. Department of Ed. of Mass., 471 U. S.\n  359, 370.\nHeld: IDEA authorizes reimbursement for private special-education\n services when a public school fails to provide a FAPE and the private\n school placement is appropriate, regardless of whether the child pre\n viously received special-education services through the public school.\n Pp. 6–17.\n    (a) This Court held in Burlington and Florence County School Dist.\n Four v. Carter, 510 U. S. 7, that §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) authorizes courts\n2                FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T. A.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    to reimburse parents for the cost of private-school tuition when a\n    school district fails to provide a child a FAPE and the private-school\n    placement is appropriate. That Burlington and Carter involved the\n    deficiency of a proposed IEP does not distinguish this case, nor does\n    the fact that the children in Burlington and Carter had previously re\n    ceived special-education services; the Court’s decision in those cases\n    depended on the Act’s language and purpose rather than the particu\n    lar facts involved. Thus, the reasoning of Burlington and Carter ap\n    plies unless the 1997 Amendments require a different result. Pp. 6–\n    8.\n       (b) The 1997 Amendments do not impose a categorical bar to reim\n    bursement. The Amendments made no change to the central purpose\n    of IDEA or the text of §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii). Because Congress is pre\n    sumed to be aware of, and to adopt, a judicial interpretation of a\n    statute when it reenacts that law without change, Lorillard v. Pons,\n    434 U. S. 575, 580, this Court will continue to read §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii)\n    to authorize reimbursement absent a clear indication that Congress\n    intended to repeal the provision or abrogate Burlington and Carter.\n    The School District’s argument that §1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) limits reim\n    bursement to children who have previously received public special\n    education services is unpersuasive for several reasons: It is not sup\n    ported by IDEA’s text, as the 1997 Amendments do not expressly\n    prohibit reimbursement in this case and the School District offers no\n    evidence that Congress intended to supersede Burlington and Carter;\n    it is at odds with IDEA’s remedial purpose of “ensur[ing] that all\n    children with disabilities have available to them a [FAPE] that em\n    phasizes special education . . . designed to meet their unique needs,”\n    §1400(d)(1)(A); and it would produce a rule bordering on the irra\n    tional by providing a remedy when a school offers a child inadequate\n    special-education services but leaving parents remediless when the\n    school unreasonably denies access to such services altogether. Pp. 8–\n    15.\n       (c) The School District’s argument that any conditions on accepting\n    IDEA funds must be stated unambiguously is clearly satisfied here,\n    as States have been on notice at least since Burlington that IDEA au\n    thorizes courts to order reimbursement. The School District’s claims\n    that respondent’s reading will impose a heavy financial burden on\n    public schools and encourage parents to enroll their children in pri\n    vate school without first trying to cooperate with public-school au\n    thorities are also unpersuasive in light of the restrictions on reim\n    bursement awards identified in Burlington and the fact that parents\n    unilaterally change their child’s placement at their own financial\n    risk.

S. C. §1400 et seq.,\nrequires States receiving federal funding to make a “free\nappropriate public education” (FAPE) available to all\nchildren with disabilities residing in the State,\n§1412(a)(1)(A). We have previously held that when a\npublic school fails to provide a FAPE and a child’s parents\nplace the child in an appropriate private school without\nthe school district’s consent, a court may require the dis\ntrict to reimburse the parents for the cost of the private\neducation. See School Comm. of Burlington v. Department\nof Ed. of Mass., 471 U. S. 359, 370 (1985). The question\npresented in this case is whether the IDEA Amendments\nof 1997 (Amendments), 111 Stat. 37, categorically prohibit\nreimbursement for private-education costs if a child has\nnot “previously received special education and related\nservices under the authority of a public agency.”\n§1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). We hold that the Amendments impose\nno such categorical bar.\n2           FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T. A. \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              I\n\n  Respondent T. A. attended public schools in the Forest\nGrove School District (School District or District) from the\ntime he was in kindergarten through the winter of his\njunior year of high school. From kindergarten through\neighth grade, respondent’s teachers observed that he had\ntrouble paying attention in class and completing his as\nsignments. When respondent entered high school, his\ndifficulties increased.\n  In December 2000, during respondent’s freshman year,\nhis mother contacted the school counselor to discuss re\nspondent’s problems with his schoolwork. At the end of\nthe school year, respondent was evaluated by a school\npsychologist.     After interviewing him, examining his\nschool records, and administering cognitive ability tests,\nthe psychologist concluded that respondent did not need\nfurther testing for any learning disabilities or other health\nimpairments, including attention deficit hyperactivity\ndisorder (ADHD). The psychologist and two other school\nofficials discussed the evaluation results with respondent’s\nmother in June 2001, and all agreed that respondent did\nnot qualify for special-education services. Respondent’s\nparents did not seek review of that decision, although the\nhearing examiner later found that the School District’s\nevaluation was legally inadequate because it failed to\naddress all areas of suspected disability, including ADHD.\n  With extensive help from his family, respondent com\npleted his sophomore year at Forest Grove High School,\nbut his problems worsened during his junior year. In\nFebruary 2003, respondent’s parents discussed with the\nSchool District the possibility of respondent completing\nhigh school through a partnership program with the local\ncommunity college. They also sought private professional\nadvice, and in March 2003 respondent was diagnosed with\nADHD and a number of disabilities related to learning and\nmemory. Advised by the private specialist that respon\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndent would do best in a structured, residential learning\nenvironment, respondent’s parents enrolled him at a\nprivate academy that focuses on educating children with\nspecial needs.\n  Four days after enrolling him in private school, respon\ndent’s parents hired a lawyer to ascertain their rights and\nto give the School District written notice of respondent’s\nprivate placement. A few weeks later, in April 2003,\nrespondent’s parents requested an administrative due\nprocess hearing regarding respondent’s eligibility for\nspecial-education services. In June 2003, the District\nengaged a school psychologist to assist in determining\nwhether respondent had a disability that significantly\ninterfered with his educational performance. Respon\ndent’s parents cooperated with the District during the\nevaluation process. In July 2003, a multidisciplinary team\nmet to discuss whether respondent satisfied IDEA’s dis\nability criteria and concluded that he did not because his\nADHD did not have a sufficiently significant adverse\nimpact on his educational performance. Because the\nSchool District maintained that respondent was not eligi\nble for special-education services and therefore declined to\nprovide an individualized education program (IEP),1 re\nspondent’s parents left him enrolled at the private acad\nemy for his senior year.\n  The administrative review process resumed in Septem\nber 2003. After considering the parties’ evidence, includ\ning the testimony of numerous experts, the hearing officer\nissued a decision in January 2004 finding that respon\ndent’s ADHD adversely affected his educational perform\nance and that the School District failed to meet its obliga\n\n——————\n  1 An IEP is an education plan tailored to a child’s unique needs that is\ndesigned by the school district in consultation with the child’s parents\nafter the child is identified as eligible for special-education services.\nSee 20 U. S. C. §§1412(a)(4), 1414(d).\n4                FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T. A.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntions under IDEA in not identifying respondent as a stu\ndent eligible for special-education services. Because the\nDistrict did not offer respondent a FAPE and his private\nschool placement was appropriate under IDEA, the hear\ning officer ordered the District to reimburse respondent’s\nparents for the cost of the private-school tuition.2\n   The School District sought judicial review pursuant to\n§1415(i)(2), arguing that the hearing officer erred in grant\ning reimbursement. The District Court accepted the\nhearing officer’s findings of fact but set aside the reim\nbursement award after finding that the 1997 Amendments\ncategorically bar reimbursement of private-school tuition\nfor students who have not “previously received special\neducation and related services under the authority of a\npublic agency.” §612(a)(10)(C)(ii), 111 Stat. 63, 20 U. S. C.\n§1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). The District Court further held that,\n“[e]ven assuming that tuition reimbursement may be\nordered in an extreme case for a student not receiving\nspecial education services, under general principles of\nequity where the need for special education was obvious to\nschool authorities,” the facts of this case do not support\nequitable relief. App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and\nremanded for further proceedings. The court first noted\nthat, prior to the 1997 Amendments, “IDEA was silent on\nthe subject of private school reimbursement, but courts\nhad granted such reimbursement as ‘appropriate’ relief\nunder principles of equity pursuant to 20 U. S. C.\n§1415(i)(2)(C).” 523 F. 3d 1078, 1085 (2008) (citing Bur\nlington, 471 U. S., at 370). It then held that the Amend\nments do not impose a categorical bar to reimbursement\n\n——————\n    2 Althoughit was respondent’s parents who initially sought reim\nbursement, when respondent reached the age of majority in 2003 his\nparents’ rights under IDEA transferred to him pursuant to Ore. Admin.\nRule 581–015–2325(1) (2008).\n                    Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                  5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen a parent unilaterally places in private school a child\nwho has not previously received special-education services\nthrough the public school. Rather, such students “are\neligible for reimbursement, to the same extent as before\nthe 1997 amendments, as ‘appropriate’ relief pursuant to\n§1415(i)(2)(C).” 523 F. 3d, at 1087–1088.\n   The Court of Appeals also rejected the District Court’s\nanalysis of the equities as resting on two legal errors.\nFirst, because it found that §1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) generally\nbars relief in these circumstances, the District Court\nwrongly stated that relief was appropriate only if the\nequities were sufficient to “ ‘override’ ” that statutory limi\ntation. The District Court also erred in asserting that\nreimbursement is limited to “ ‘extreme’ ” cases. Id., at 1088\n(emphasis deleted). The Court of Appeals therefore re\nmanded with instructions to reexamine the equities, in\ncluding the failure of respondent’s parents to notify the\nSchool District before removing respondent from public\nschool. In dissent, Judge Rymer stated her view that\nreimbursement is not available as an equitable remedy in\nthis case because respondent’s parents did not request an\nIEP before removing him from public school and respon\ndent’s right to a FAPE was therefore not at issue.\n   Because the Courts of Appeals that have considered this\nquestion have reached inconsistent results,3 we granted\ncertiorari to determine whether §1412(a)(10)(C) estab\nlishes a categorical bar to tuition reimbursement for stu\ndents who have not previously received special-education\nservices under the authority of a public education agency.\n——————\n  3 Compare Frank G. v. Board of Ed. of Hyde Park, 459 F. 3d 356, 376\n\n(CA2 2006) (holding that §1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) does not bar reimburse\nment for students who have not previously received public special\neducation services), and M.

Amy N., 358 F. 3d 150, 159–160 (CA1 2004) (finding\nreimbursement barred in those circumstances).\n6              FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T. A.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n555 U. S. ___ (2009).4\n                              II\n   Justice Rehnquist’s opinion for a unanimous Court in\nBurlington provides the pertinent background for our\nanalysis of the question presented. In that case, respon\ndent challenged the appropriateness of the IEP developed\nfor his child by public-school officials. The child had pre\nviously received special-education services through the\npublic school. While administrative review was pending,\nprivate specialists advised respondent that the child would\ndo best in a specialized private educational setting, and\nrespondent enrolled the child in private school without the\nschool district’s consent. The hearing officer concluded\nthat the IEP was not adequate to meet the child’s educa\ntional needs and that the school district therefore failed to\nprovide the child a FAPE. Finding also that the private\nschool placement was appropriate under IDEA, the hear\ning officer ordered the school district to reimburse respon\ndent for the cost of the private-school tuition.\n   We granted certiorari in Burlington to determine\nwhether IDEA authorizes reimbursement for the cost of\nprivate education when a parent or guardian unilaterally\nenrolls a child in private school because the public school\nhas proposed an inadequate IEP and thus failed to provide\na FAPE. The Act at that time made no express reference\nto the possibility of reimbursement, but it authorized a\ncourt to “grant such relief as the court determines is ap\npropriate.” §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii).5 In determining the scope\n——————\n    4 We previously granted certiorari to address this question in Board\nof Ed. of City School Dist. of New York v. Tom F., 552 U. S. 1 (2007), in\nwhich we affirmed without opinion the judgment of the Court of Ap\npeals for the Second Circuit by an equally divided vote.\n   5 At the time we decided Burlington, that provision was codified at\n\n§1415(e)(2). The 1997 Amendments renumbered the provision but did\nnot alter its text. For ease of reference, we refer to the provision by its\ncurrent section number, §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii).\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nof the relief authorized, we noted that “the ordinary mean\ning of these words confers broad discretion on the court”\nand that, absent any indication to the contrary, what relief\nis “appropriate” must be determined in light of the Act’s\nbroad purpose of providing children with disabilities a\nFAPE, including through publicly funded private-school\nplacements when necessary. 471 U. S., at 369. Accord\ningly, we held that the provision’s grant of authority in\ncludes “the power to order school authorities to reimburse\nparents for their expenditures on private special-education\nservices if the court ultimately determines that such place\nment, rather than a proposed IEP, is proper under the\nAct.” Ibid.\n   Our decision rested in part on the fact that administra\ntive and judicial review of a parent’s complaint often takes\nyears. We concluded that, having mandated that partici\npating States provide a FAPE for every student, Congress\ncould not have intended to require parents to either accept\nan inadequate public-school education pending adjudica\ntion of their claim or bear the cost of a private education if\nthe court ultimately determined that the private place\nment was proper under the Act. Id., at 370. Eight years\nlater, we unanimously reaffirmed the availability of reim\nbursement in Florence County School Dist. Four v. Carter,\n510 U. S. 7 (1993) (holding that reimbursement may be\nappropriate even when a child is placed in a private school\nthat has not been approved by the State).\n   The dispute giving rise to the present litigation differs\nfrom those in Burlington and Carter in that it concerns not\nthe adequacy of a proposed IEP but the School District’s\nfailure to provide an IEP at all. And, unlike respondent,\nthe children in those cases had previously received public\nspecial-education services. These differences are insignifi\ncant, however, because our analysis in the earlier cases\ndepended on the language and purpose of the Act and not\nthe particular facts involved. Moreover, when a child\n8             FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T. A.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nrequires special-education services, a school district’s\nfailure to propose an IEP of any kind is at least as serious\na violation of its responsibilities under IDEA as a failure\nto provide an adequate IEP. It is thus clear that the\nreasoning of Burlington and Carter applies equally to this\ncase. The only question is whether the 1997 Amendments\nrequire a different result.\n                             III\n   Congress enacted IDEA in 19706 to ensure that all\nchildren with disabilities are provided “ ‘a free appropriate\npublic education which emphasizes special education and\nrelated services designed to meet their unique needs [and]\nto assure that the rights of [such] children and their par\nents or guardians are protected.’ ” Burlington, 471 U. S.,\nat 367 (quoting 20 U. S. C. §1400(c) (1982 ed.), now codi\nfied as amended at §§1400(d)(1)(A), (B)). After examining\nthe States’ progress under IDEA, Congress found in 1997\nthat substantial gains had been made in the area of spe\ncial education but that more needed to be done to guaran\ntee children with disabilities adequate access to appropri\nate services. See S. Rep. No. 105–17, p. 5 (1997). The\n1997 Amendments were intended “to place greater em\nphasis on improving student performance and ensuring\nthat children with disabilities receive a quality public\neducation.” Id., at 3.\n   Consistent with that goal, the Amendments preserved\nthe Act’s purpose of providing a FAPE to all children with\ndisabilities. And they did not change the text of the provi\nsion we considered in Burlington, §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii), which\ngives courts broad authority to grant “appropriate” relief,\nincluding reimbursement for the cost of private special\n——————\n    6 Thelegislation was enacted as the Education of the Handicapped\nAct, title VI of Pub. L. 91–230, 84 Stat. 175, and was renamed the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1990, see §901(a)(3),\nPub. L. 101–476, 104 Stat. 1142.\n                   Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)              9\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\neducation when a school district fails to provide a FAPE.\n“Congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or\njudicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that inter\npretation when it re-enacts a statute without change.”\nLorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 580 (1978). Accordingly,\nabsent a clear expression elsewhere in the Amendments of\nCongress’ intent to repeal some portion of that provision or\nto abrogate our decisions in Burlington and Carter, we will\ncontinue to read §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) to authorize the relief\nrespondent seeks.\n  The School District and the dissent argue that one of the\nprovisions enacted by the Amendments, §1412(a)(10)(C),\neffects such a repeal. Section 1412(a)(10)(C) is entitled\n“Payment for education of children enrolled in private\nschools without consent of or referral by the public\nagency,” and it sets forth a number of principles applicable\nto public reimbursement for the costs of unilateral private\nschool placements. Section 1412(a)(10)(C)(i) states that\nIDEA “does not require a local educational agency to pay\nfor the cost of education . . . of a child with a disability at a\nprivate school or facility if that agency made a free appro\npriate public education available to the child” and his\nparents nevertheless elected to place him in a private\nschool. Section 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) then provides that a\n“court or hearing officer may require [a public] agency to\nreimburse the parents for the cost of [private-school]\nenrollment if the court or hearing officer finds that the\nagency had not made a free appropriate public education\navailable” and the child has “previously received special\neducation and related services under the authority of [the]\nagency.” Finally, §1412(a)(10)(C)(iii) discusses circum\nstances under which the “cost of reimbursement described\nin clause (ii) may be reduced or denied,” as when a parent\nfails to give 10 days’ notice before removing a child from\npublic school or refuses to make a child available for\nevaluation, and §1412(a)(10)(C)(iv) lists circumstances in\n10             FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T. A.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich a parent’s failure to give notice may or must be\nexcused.7\n   Looking primarily to clauses (i) and (ii), the School\nDistrict argues that Congress intended §1412(a)(10)(C) to\nprovide the exclusive source of authority for courts to\norder reimbursement when parents unilaterally enroll a\nchild in private school. According to the District, clause (i)\nprovides a safe harbor for school districts that provide a\nFAPE by foreclosing reimbursement in those circum\nstances. Clause (ii) then sets forth the circumstance in\nwhich reimbursement is appropriate—namely, when a\nschool district fails to provide a FAPE to a child who has\npreviously received special-education services through the\npublic school.      The District contends that because\n§1412(a)(10)(C) only discusses reimbursement for children\nwho have previously received special-education services\nthrough the public school, IDEA only authorizes reim\nbursement in that circumstance. The dissent agrees.\n   For several reasons, we find this argument unpersua\nsive. First, the School District’s reading of the Act is not\nsupported by its text and context, as the 1997 Amend\nments do not expressly prohibit reimbursement under the\ncircumstances of this case, and the District offers no evi\ndence that Congress intended to supersede our decisions\nin Burlington and Carter. Clause (i)’s safe harbor explic\nitly bars reimbursement only when a school district makes\na FAPE available by correctly identifying a child as having\na disability and proposing an IEP adequate to meet the\nchild’s needs. The clause says nothing about the availabil\nity of reimbursement when a school district fails to provide\na FAPE. Indeed, its statement that reimbursement is not\nauthorized when a school district provides a FAPE could\nbe read to indicate that reimbursement is authorized\n——————\n  7 The full text of §1412(a)(10)(C) is set forth in the Appendix, infra,\n\nat 18.\n                      Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen a school district does not fulfill that obligation.\n   Clause (ii) likewise does not support the District’s posi\ntion. Because that clause is phrased permissively, stating\nonly that courts “may require” reimbursement in those\ncircumstances, it does not foreclose reimbursement\nawards in other circumstances. Together with clauses (iii)\nand (iv), clause (ii) is best read as elaborating on the gen\neral rule that courts may order reimbursement when a\nschool district fails to provide a FAPE by listing factors\nthat may affect a reimbursement award in the common\nsituation in which a school district has provided a child\nwith some special-education services and the child’s par\nents believe those services are inadequate. Referring as\nthey do to students who have previously received special\neducation services through a public school, clauses (ii)\nthrough (iv) are premised on a history of cooperation and\ntogether encourage school districts and parents to con\ntinue to cooperate in developing and implementing an\nappropriate IEP before resorting to a unilateral private\nplacement.8 The clauses of §1412(a)(10)(C) are thus best\nread as elucidative rather than exhaustive. Cf. United\n——————\n   8 The dissent asserts that, under this reading of the Act, “Congress\n\nhas called for reducing reimbursement only for the most deserving . . .\nbut provided no mechanism to reduce reimbursement to the least\ndeserving.” Post, at 6 (opinion of SOUTER, J.). In addition to making\nunsubstantiated generalizations about the desert of parents whose\nchildren have been denied public special-education services, the dissent\ngrossly mischaracterizes our view of §1412(a)(10)(C). The fact that\nclause (iii) permits a court to reduce a reimbursement award when a\nparent whose child has previously received special-education services\nfails to give the school adequate notice of an intended private place\nment does not mean that it prohibits courts from similarly reducing the\namount of reimbursement when a parent whose child has not previ\nously received services fails to give such notice. Like clause (ii), clause\n(iii) provides guidance regarding the appropriateness of relief in a\ncommon factual scenario, and its instructions should not be understood\nto preclude courts and hearing officers from considering similar factors\nin other scenarios.\n12             FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T. A.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nStates v. Atlantic Research Corp., 551 U. S. 128, 137\n(2007) (noting that statutory language may “perfor[m] a\nsignificant function simply by clarifying” a provision’s\nmeaning).9\n  This reading of §1412(a)(10)(C) is necessary to avoid the\nconclusion that Congress abrogated sub silentio our deci\nsions in Burlington and Carter. In those cases, we con\nstrued §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) to authorize reimbursement when\na school district fails to provide a FAPE and a child’s\nprivate-school placement is appropriate, without regard to\nthe child’s prior receipt of services.10 It would take more\nthan Congress’ failure to comment on the category of cases\nin which a child has not previously received special\neducation services for us to conclude that the Amendments\nsubstantially superseded our decisions and in large part\n——————\n  9 In arguing that §1412(a)(10)(C) is the exclusive source of authority\nfor granting reimbursement awards to parents who unilaterally place a\nchild in private school, the dissent neglects to explain that provision’s\nfailure to limit the type of private-school placements for which parents\nmay be reimbursed. School Comm. of Burlington v. Department of Ed.\nof Mass. held that courts may grant reimbursement under\n§1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) only when a school district fails to provide a FAPE\nand the private-school placement is appropriate. See 471 U. S. 359,\n369 (1985); see Florence County School Dist. Four v. Carter, 510 U. S. 7,\n12–13 (1993). The latter requirement is essential to ensuring that\nreimbursement awards are granted only when such relief furthers the\npurposes of the Act. See Burlington, 471 U. S., at 369. That\n§1412(a)(10)(C) did not codify that requirement further indicates that\nCongress did not intend that provision to supplant §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) as\nthe sole authority on reimbursement awards but rather meant to\naugment the latter provision and our decisions construing it.\n  10 As discussed above, although the children in Burlington and Carter\n\nhad previously received special-education services in public school, our\ndecisions in no way depended on their prior receipt of services. Those\nholdings rested instead on the breadth of the authority conferred by\n§1415(i)(2)(C)(iii), the interest in providing relief consistent with the\nAct’s purpose, and the injustice that a contrary reading would produce,\nsee Burlington, 471 U. S., at 369–370; see also Carter, 510 U. S., at 12–\n14—considerations that were not altered by the 1997 Amendments.\n                      Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                     13\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nrepealed §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii). See Branch v. Smith, 538\nU. S. 254, 273 (2003) (“[A]bsent a clearly expressed con\ngressional intention, repeals by implication are not fa\nvored” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).11\nWe accordingly adopt the reading of §1412(a)(10)(C) that\nis consistent with those decisions.12\n   The School District’s reading of §1412(a)(10)(C) is also\nat odds with the general remedial purpose underlying\nIDEA and the 1997 Amendments. The express purpose of\nthe Act is to “ensure that all children with disabilities\nhave available to them a free appropriate public education\n——————\n   11 For the same reason, we reject the District’s argument that because\n\n§1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) authorizes “a court or a hearing officer” to award\nreimbursement for private-school tuition, whereas §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii)\nonly provides a general grant of remedial authority to “court[s],” the\nlatter section cannot be read to authorize hearing officers to award\nreimbursement. That argument ignores our decision in Burlington, 471\nU. S., at 363, 370, which interpreted §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) to authorize\nhearing officers as well as courts to award reimbursement notwith\nstanding the provision’s silence with regard to hearing officers. When\nCongress amended IDEA without altering the text of §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii),\nit implicitly adopted that construction of the statute. See Lorillard v.\nPons, 434 U. S. 575, 580–581 (1978).\n   12 Looking to the Amendments’ legislative history for support, the\n\nSchool District cites two House and Senate Reports that essentially\nrestate the text of §1412(a)(10)(C)(ii), H. R. Rep. No. 105–95, pp. 92–93\n(1997); S. Rep. No. 105–17, p. 13 (1997), and a floor statement by\nRepresentative Mike Castle, 143 Cong. Rec. 8013 (1997) (stating that\nthe “bill makes it harder for parents to unilaterally place a child in elite\nprivate schools at public taxpayer expense, lowering costs to local\nschool districts”). Those ambiguous references do not undermine the\nmeaning that we discern from the statute’s language and context.\n   Notably, the agency charged with implementing IDEA has adopted\nrespondent’s reading of the statute. In commentary to regulations\nimplementing the 1997 Amendments, the Department of Education\nstated that “hearing officers and courts retain their authority, recog\nnized in Burlington . . . to award ‘appropriate’ relief if a public agency\nhas failed to provide FAPE, including reimbursement . . . in instances\nin which the child has not yet received special education and related\nservices.” 64 Fed. Reg. 12602 (1999); see 71 Fed. Reg. 46599 (2006).\n14          FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T. A.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat emphasizes special education and related services\ndesigned to meet their unique needs,” §1400(d)(1)(A)—a\nfactor we took into account in construing the scope of\n§1415(i)(2)(C)(iii), see Burlington, 471 U. S., at 369. With\nout the remedy respondent seeks, a “child’s right to a free\nappropriate education . . . would be less than complete.”\nId., at 370. The District’s position similarly conflicts with\nIDEA’s “child find” requirement, pursuant to which States\nare obligated to “identif[y], locat[e], and evaluat[e]” “[a]ll\nchildren with disabilities residing in the State” to ensure\nthat they receive needed special-education services.\n§1412(a)(3)(A); see §1412(a)(10)(A)(ii). A reading of the\nAct that left parents without an adequate remedy when a\nschool district unreasonably failed to identify a child with\ndisabilities would not comport with Congress’ acknowl\nedgment of the paramount importance of properly identi\nfying each child eligible for services.\n  Indeed, by immunizing a school district’s refusal to find\na child eligible for special-education services no matter\nhow compelling the child’s need, the School District’s\ninterpretation of §1412(a)(10)(C) would produce a rule\nbordering on the irrational. It would be particularly\nstrange for the Act to provide a remedy, as all agree it\ndoes, when a school district offers a child inadequate\nspecial-education services but to leave parents without\nrelief in the more egregious situation in which the school\ndistrict unreasonably denies a child access to such services\naltogether. That IDEA affords parents substantial proce\ndural safeguards, including the right to challenge a school\ndistrict’s eligibility determination and obtain prospective\nrelief, see post, at 11, is no answer. We roundly rejected\nthat argument in Burlington, observing that the “review\nprocess is ponderous” and therefore inadequate to ensure\nthat a school’s failure to provide a FAPE is remedied with\nthe speed necessary to avoid detriment to the child’s edu\ncation. 471 U. S., at 370. Like Burlington, see ibid., this\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncase vividly demonstrates the problem of delay, as respon\ndent’s parents first sought a due process hearing in April\n2003, and the District Court issued its decision in May\n2005—almost a year after respondent graduated from\nhigh school. The dissent all but ignores these shortcom\nings of IDEA’s procedural safeguards.\n                              IV\n   The School District advances two additional arguments\nfor reading the Act to foreclose reimbursement in this\ncase. First, the District contends that because IDEA was\nan exercise of Congress’ authority under the Spending\nClause, U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 1, any conditions at\ntached to a State’s acceptance of funds must be stated\nunambiguously. See Pennhurst State School and Hospital\nv. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981). Applying that prin\nciple, we held in Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed.\nv. Murphy, 548 U. S. 291, 304 (2006), that IDEA’s fee\nshifting provision, §1415(i)(3)(B), does not authorize courts\nto award expert-services fees to prevailing parents in\nIDEA actions because the Act does not put States on\nnotice of the possibility of such awards. But Arlington is\nreadily distinguishable from this case. In accepting IDEA\nfunding, States expressly agree to provide a FAPE to all\nchildren with disabilities. See §1412(a)(1)(A). An order\nawarding reimbursement of private-education costs when\na school district fails to provide a FAPE merely requires\nthe district “to belatedly pay expenses that it should have\npaid all along.” Burlington, 471 U. S., at 370–371. And\nStates have in any event been on notice at least since our\ndecision in Burlington that IDEA authorizes courts to\norder reimbursement of the costs of private special\neducation services in appropriate circumstances. Penn\nhurst’s notice requirement is thus clearly satisfied.\n  Finally, the District urges that respondent’s reading of\nthe Act will impose a substantial financial burden on\n16          FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T. A.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npublic school districts and encourage parents to immedi\nately enroll their children in private school without first\nendeavoring to cooperate with the school district. The\ndissent echoes this concern. See post, at 10. For several\nreasons, those fears are unfounded. Parents “are entitled\nto reimbursement only if a federal court concludes both\nthat the public placement violated IDEA and the private\nschool placement was proper under the Act.” Carter, 510\nU. S., at 15. And even then courts retain discretion to\nreduce the amount of a reimbursement award if the equi\nties so warrant—for instance, if the parents failed to give\nthe school district adequate notice of their intent to enroll\nthe child in private school. In considering the equities,\ncourts should generally presume that public-school offi\ncials are properly performing their obligations under\nIDEA. See Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. 49, 62–63 (2005)\n(STEVENS, J., concurring). As a result of these criteria and\nthe fact that parents who “ ‘unilaterally change their\nchild’s placement during the pendency of review proceed\nings, without the consent of state or local school officials,\ndo so at their own financial risk,’ ” Carter, 510 U. S., at 15\n(quoting Burlington, 471 U. S., at 373–374), the incidence\nof private-school placement at public expense is quite\nsmall, see Brief for National Disability Rights Network\net al. as Amici Curiae 13–14.\n                               V\n   The IDEA Amendments of 1997 did not modify the text\nof §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii), and we do not read §1412(a)(10)(C) to\nalter that provision’s meaning. Consistent with our deci\nsions in Burlington and Carter, we conclude that IDEA\nauthorizes reimbursement for the cost of private special\neducation services when a school district fails to provide a\nFAPE and the private-school placement is appropriate,\nregardless of whether the child previously received special\neducation or related services through the public school.\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   When a court or hearing officer concludes that a school\ndistrict failed to provide a FAPE and the private place\nment was suitable, it must consider all relevant factors,\nincluding the notice provided by the parents and the\nschool district’s opportunities for evaluating the child, in\ndetermining whether reimbursement for some or all of the\ncost of the child’s private education is warranted. As the\nCourt of Appeals noted, the District Court did not properly\nconsider the equities in this case and will need to under\ntake that analysis on remand. Accordingly, the judgment\nof the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n18             FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T.

Department of Ed. of\nMass., 471 U. S. 359 (1985), held that the Education of the\nHandicapped Act, 84 Stat. 175, now known as the Indi\nviduals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U. S. C.\n§1400 et seq., authorized a district court to order reim\nbursement of private school tuition and expenses to par\nents who took their disabled child from public school\nbecause the school’s special education services did not\nmeet the child’s needs. We said that, for want of any\nspecific limitation, this remedy was within the general\nauthorization for courts to award “such relief as [they]\ndetermin[e] is appropriate.” §1415(e)(2) (1982 ed.) (now\ncodified at §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) (2006 ed.)). In 1997, however,\nCongress amended the IDEA with a number of provisions\nexplicitly addressing the issue of “[p]ayment for education\nof children enrolled in private schools without consent of\nor referral by the public agency.” §1412(a)(10)(C). These\namendments generally prohibit reimbursement if the\nschool district made a “free appropriate public education”\n(FAPE) available, §1412(a)(10)(C)(i), and if they are to\nhave any effect, there is no exception except by agreement,\n§1412(a)(10)(B), or for a student who previously received\n2            FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T.

The Court does not find the provision\nclear enough to affect the rule in Burlington, and it does\nnot believe Congress meant to limit public reimbursement\nfor unilaterally incurred private school tuition. But there\nis no authority for a heightened standard before Congress\ncan alter a prior judicial interpretation of a statute, and\nthe assessment of congressional policy aims falls short of\ntrumping what seems to me to be the clear limitation\nimposed by §1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).\n\n                                I\n   In Burlington, parents of a child with a learning dis\nability tried for over eight years to work out a satisfactory\nindividualized education plan (IEP) for their son. 471\nU. S., at 361–362. They eventually gave up and sent the\nboy to a private school for disabled children, id., at 362,\nand we took the ensuing case to decide whether the Edu\ncation of the Handicapped Act authorized courts to order\nreimbursement for private special education “if the court\nultimately determines that such placement, rather than a\nproposed IEP, is proper under the Act,” id., at 369. After\nnoting various sections that “emphasiz[e] the participation\nof the parents in developing the child’s [public] educa\ntional program,” id., at 368, we inferred that the Act au\nthorized reimbursement by providing that a district court\nshall “ ‘grant such relief as [it] determines is appropriate,’ ”\nid., at 369 (quoting what is now §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); altera\ntion in original). We emphasized that the Act did not\nspeak specifically to the issue of reimbursement, and held\nthat “[a]bsent other reference,” reimbursement for private\ntuition and expenses would be an “ ‘appropriate’ ” remedy\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

In\nshort, we read the general provision for ordering equitable\nremedies in §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) as authorizing a reim\nbursement order, in large part because Congress had not\nspoken more specifically to the issue.\n  But Congress did speak explicitly when it amended the\nIDEA in 1997. It first said that whenever the State or a\nlocal educational agency refers a student to private special\neducation, the bill is a public expense. See 20 U. S. C.\n§1412(a)(10)(B). It then included several clauses address\ning “[p]ayment for education of children enrolled in private\nschools without consent of or referral by the public\nagency.” §1412(a)(10)(C). The first contrasts with the\nprovision covering an agency referral:\n    “(i) In general\n    “. . . this subchapter does not require a local educa\n    tional agency to pay for the cost of education . . . of a\n    child with a disability at a private school or facility if\n    that agency made a free appropriate public education\n    available to the child and the parents elected to place\n    the child in such private school or facility.”\n    §1412(a)(10)(C).\nThe second clause covers the case in which the school\nauthority failed to make a FAPE available in its schools.\nIt does not, however, provide simply that the authority\nmust pay in this case, no matter what. Instead it provides\nthis:\n    “(ii) Reimbursement for private school placement\n      “If the parents of a child with a disability, who pre\n    viously received special education and related services\n    under the authority of a public agency, enroll the child\n    in a private elementary school or secondary school\n    without the consent of or referral by the public\n    agency, a court or a hearing officer may require the\n4                 FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v.

As the\nmajority suggests, ante, at 10–11, clause (i) could theoreti\ncally be understood to imply that reimbursement may be\nordered whenever a school district fails to provide a FAPE,\nand clause (ii) could be read as merely taking care to\nmention one of a variety of circumstances in which such\nreimbursement is permitted. But this is overstretching.\nWhen permissive language covers a special case, the natu\nral sense of it is taken to prohibit what it fails to author\nize. When a mother tells a boy that he may go out and\nplay after his homework is done, he knows what she\nmeans.\n   So does anyone who reads the authorization of a reim\nbursement order in the case of “a child with a disability,\nwho previously received special education and related\nservices under the authority of a public agency.”\n§1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).1 If the mother did not mean that the\n——————\n    1 Likewise,no one is unsure whether this Court’s Rule 18.6, which\nstates, “Within 30 days after the case is placed on this Court’s docket,\nthe appellee may file a motion to dismiss . . . ,” allows for a motion to\ndismiss after 30 days. See also Carlisle v. United States, 517 U. S. 416,\n431–32 (1996) (listing numerous examples of permissive statements,\nsuch as then Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 17(d)’s statement that\na subpoena “may be served” by a person “who is not less than 18 years\nof age,” that plainly carry a restrictive meaning).\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___\n(2009) (slip op., at 9) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nBut not on the Court’s reading, under which clause (ii)\ndoes nothing but describe a particular subset of cases\nsubject to remedial authority already given to courts by\n§1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) and recognized in Burlington: a court\nmay order reimbursement for a child who previously\nreceived special education related services, but it may do\nthis for any other child, too.2 But this is just not plausible,\nthe notion that Congress added a new provision to the\nIDEA entitled “Reimbursement for private school place\nment” that had no effect whatsoever on reimbursement for\nprivate school placement. I would read clause (i) as writ\nten on the assumption that the school authorities can be\nexpected to honor their obligations and as stating the\ngeneral rule that unilateral placement cannot be reim\nbursed. See §1412(a)(10)(C)(i) (“In general . . . ”). And I\nwould read clause (ii) as imposing a receipt of prior ser\n——————\n  2 The majority says that “clause (ii) is best read as elaborating on the\n\ngeneral rule that courts may order reimbursement when a school\ndistrict fails to provide a FAPE by listing factors that may affect a\nreimbursement award in the common situation in which a school\ndistrict has provided a child with some special-education services and\nthe child’s parents believe those services are inadequate.” Ante, at 11.\nBut this is just another way of reading the provision off the books. On\nthe majority’s reading, clause (ii) states only that a court may award\nreimbursement when (1) there is a previous receipt of special education\nservices and (2) a failure to provide a FAPE. Such a description of the\nmost common subset of a category already described may be called\nelaboration, but it still has no effect on the statutory scheme.\n6           FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T. A.\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nvices limit on any exceptions to that general rule when\nschool officials fall short of providing a FAPE. See\n§1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) (“Reimbursement for private school\nplacement . . . ”).\n   This reading can claim the virtue of avoiding a further\nanomaly. Section 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii), which limits other\nwise available reimbursement, is expressly directed to\n“[t]he cost of reimbursement described in clause (ii).” This\nmakes perfect sense under my reading. Since clause (ii) is\nnow the exclusive source of authority to order reimburse\nment, it is natural to refer to it in the clause setting out\nthe conditions for reducing or even denying reimburse\nment otherwise authorized. Yet, as T. A. and the Gov\nernment concede, Brief for Respondent 22; Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 4, 17, under the major\nity’s reading, Congress has called for reducing reimburse\nment only for the most deserving (parents described in\nclause (ii) who consult with the school district and give\npublic special education services a try before demanding\npayment for private education), but provided no mecha\nnism to reduce reimbursement to the least deserving\n(parents who have not given public placement a chance).\n   The Court responds to this point by doubling down.\nAccording to the majority, the criteria listed in clause (iii)\ncan justify a reduction not only of “reimbursement de\nscribed in clause (ii),” §1412(a)(10)(C)(iii), but can also do\nso for a reimbursement order authorized elsewhere as\nwell, ante, at 11 n. 8. That is, the majority avoids ascrib\ning perverse motives to Congress by concluding that in\nboth clause (ii) and clause (iii), Congress meant to add\nnothing to the statutory scheme. This simply leads back\nto the question of why Congress in §1412(a)(10)(C) would\nhave been so concerned with cases in which children had\nnot previously received special education services when,\non the majority’s reading, the prior receipt of services has\nno relevance whatsoever to the subject of that provision.\n                    Cite as: 557 U.

Ante, at 8–12. The majority refers to two distinct\nprinciples for support: first, statutes are to be read with a\npresumption against implied repeals, e.g., ante, at 12–13\n(citing Branch v. Smith, 538 U. S. 254, 273 (2003) (plural\nity opinion)), and second, congressional reenactment of\nstatutory text without change is deemed to ratify a prior\njudicial interpretation of it, e.g., ante, at 8–9 (citing Loril\nlard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 580 (1978)). I think neither\nprinciple is up to the task.\n   Section 1412(a)(10)(C) in no way repealed the provision\nwe considered in Burlington.3 The relief that “is appropri\nate” under §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) depends on the substantive\nprovisions of the IDEA as surely as if the provision author\n——————\n  3 The presumption against implied repeals would not justify reading\n\nthe later provision as useless even if it applied since, when two provi\nsions are irreconcilable, the presumption against implied repeals gives\nway to the later enactment. See Branch v. Smith, 538 U. S. 254, 273\n(2003) (plurality opinion).\n8             FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T. A.\n\n                        SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nized equitable relief “consistent with the provisions of this\nstatute.”4 When we applied §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) in Burling\nton, we expressly referred to those provisions and con\ncluded that, in the absence of a specific rule, “appropriate”\nrelief included the reimbursement sought. By introducing\nnew restrictions on reimbursement, the 1997 Amendments\nproduce a different conclusion about what relief is “appro\npriate.” But §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) remains in effect, just as it\nwould remain in effect if Congress had explicitly amended\nthe IDEA to prohibit reimbursement absent prior receipt\nof services.\n   As for the rule that reenactment incorporates prior\ninterpretation, the Court’s reliance on it to preserve Bur\nlington’s reading of §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) faces two hurdles.\nFirst, so far as I can tell, this maxim has never been used\nto impose a clear statement rule. If Congress does not\nsuggest otherwise, reenacted statutory language retains\nits old meaning; but when a new enactment includes\nlanguage undermining the prior reading, there is no pre\nsumption favoring the old, and the only course open is\nsimply to read the revised statute as a whole. This is so\nbecause there is no reason to distinguish between amend\nments that occur in a single clause (as if Congress had\nplaced all the changes in §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii)), and those that\ntake the form of a separate section (here, §1412(a)(10)(C)).\nIf Congress had added a caveat within §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii),\nor in an immediately neighboring provision, I assume the\nmajority would not approach it with skepticism on the\nground that it purported to modify a prior judicial inter\npretation.\n   Second, nothing in my reading of §1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) is\n\n——————\n    4 No\n       one, for example, would suggest that a court could grant reim\nbursement under §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) to parents of a nondisabled child,\nbut this is obvious only because we assume §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) is to be\nread in light of the substantive provisions of the statute.\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\ninconsistent with the holdings of Burlington and the other\nprior decision on the subject, Florence County School Dist.\nFour v. Carter, 510 U. S. 7 (1993). Our opinion in Burling\nton was expressly premised on there being no “other refer\nence” that would govern reimbursement for private tui\ntion, 471 U. S., at 369, and this all but invited Congress to\nprovide one. Congress’s provision of such a reference in\n1997 is, to say the very least, no reason for skepticism that\nCongress wished to alter the law on reimbursement. The\n1997 legislation, read my way, would not, however, alter\nthe result in either Burlington or Carter. In each case, the\nschool district had agreed that the child was disabled, the\nparents had cooperated with the district and tried out an\nIEP, and the only question was whether parents who later\nresorted to a private school could be reimbursed “ ‘if the\ncourt ultimately determines that such placement, rather\nthan a proposed IEP, is proper under the Act.’ ” Carter,\nsupra, at 12 (quoting Burlington, supra, at 369). In order\ning reimbursement, the Court in both Burlington and\nCarter emphasized that the parents took part in devising\nan IEP, 471 U. S., at 368; 510 U. S., at 12, and expressed\nconcern for parents who had sought an IEP before placing\ntheir child in private school, but received one that was\ninadequate, 471 U. S., at 370; 510 U. S., at 12. The result\nin each case would have been the same under my reading\nof the amended Act, both sets of parents being “parents of\na child with a disability, who previously received special\neducation and related services under the authority of a\npublic agency.” §1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). It is therefore too\nmuch to suggest that my reading of §1412(a)(10)(C)(ii)\nwould “abrogat[e] sub silentio our decisions in Burlington\nand Carter,” ante, at 12.\n   The majority argues that the policy concerns vindicated\nin Burlington and Carter justify reading those cases to\nauthorize a reimbursement authority going beyond their\nfacts, ante, at 7–8, and would hold reimbursement possible\n10          FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T. A.\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\neven for parents who, like those here, unilaterally resort\nto a private school without first establishing at the admin\nistrative or appellate level that the child is disabled, or\nengaging in a collaborative process with the school offi\ncials. But how broadly one should read Burlington and\nCarter is beside the point, Congress having explicitly\naddressed the subject with statutory language that pre\ncludes the Court’s result today.\n                               B\n   The Court also rejects the natural sense of\n§1412(a)(10)(C) as an interpretation that would be “at\nodds with the general remedial purpose underlying IDEA\nand the 1997 Amendments.” Ante, at 13. The majority\nthinks my reading would place the school authorities in\ntotal control of parents’ eligibility for reimbursement: just\nrefuse any request for special education or services in the\npublic school, and the prior service condition for eligibility\nunder clause (ii) can never be satisfied. Thus, as the\nmajority puts it, it would “borde[r] on the irrational” to\n“immuniz[e] a school district’s refusal to find a child eligi\nble for special-education services no matter how compel\nling the child’s need.” Ibid. I agree that any such scheme\nwould be pretty absurd, but there is no absurdity here.\nThe majority’s suggestion overlooks the terms of the IDEA\nprocess, the substantial procedures protecting a child’s\nsubstantive rights under the IDEA, and the significant\ncosts of its rule.\n   To start with the costs, special education can be im\nmensely expensive, amounting to tens of billions of dollars\nannually and as much as 20% of public schools’ general\noperating budgets. See Brief for Council of the Great City\nSchools as Amicus Curiae 22–23. The more private\nplacement there is, the higher the special education bill, a\nfact that lends urgency to the IDEA’s mandate of a col\nlaborative process in which an IEP is “developed jointly by\n                    Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                 11\n\n                        SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\na school official qualified in special education, the child’s\nteacher, the parents or guardian, and, where appropriate,\nthe child.” Burlington, supra, at 368.\n   The Act’s repeated emphasis on the need for cooperative\njoint action by school and parent does not, however, leave\nthe school in control if officials should wish to block effec\ntive (and expensive) action for the child’s benefit, for if the\ncollaborative approach breaks down, the IDEA provides\nfor quick review in a “due process hearing” of the parents’\nclaim that more services are needed to provide a FAPE\nthan the school is willing to give. See §1415(c)(2) (district\nmust respond to due process hearing complaint within 10\ndays and hearing officer must assess facial validity of\ncomplaint within 5 days); §1415(e) (mediation is available,\nprovided it does not delay due process hearing);\n§1415(f)(1)(B) (district must convene a meeting with par\nents within 15 days to attempt to resolve complaint); 34\nCFR §§300.510(b)(1)–(2) (2008) (if complaint is not re\nsolved, a hearing must be held within 30 days of complaint\nand a decision must be issued within 75 days of com\nplaint). Parents who remain dissatisfied after these first\ntwo levels of process may have a right of appeal to the\nstate educational agency and in any case may bring a\ncourt action in federal district court. See 20 U. S. C.\n§1415(i)(2). This scheme of administrative and judicial\nreview is the answer to the Court’s claim that reading the\nprior services condition as restrictive, not illustrative,\nimmunizes a school district’s intransigence, giving it an\neffective veto on reimbursement for private placement.5\n——————\n  5 The majority argues that we already rejected this process as inade\n\nquate in School Comm. of Burlington v. Department of Ed. of Mass., 471\nU. S. 359 (1985). Ante, at 14. That was before the enactment of\n§1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). The question in Burlington was whether the\nreimbursement there was an “appropriate” remedy under\n§1415(i)(2)(C)(iii). See 471 U. S., at 370. With no statement to the\ncontrary from Congress, the Court expressed concern over the possible\n12             FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T. A.\n\n                         SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\n  That said, the Court of course has a fair point that the\nprior services condition qualifies the remedial objective of\nthe statute, and pursuing appeals to get a satisfactory IEP\nwith special services worth accepting could be discourag\ning. The child who needs help does not stop needing it, or\nstop growing, while schools and parents argue back and\nforth. But we have to decide this case on the premise that\nmost such arguments will be carried on in good faith, and\neven on the assumption that disagreements about the\nadequacy of IEPs will impose some burdens on the Act’s\nintended beneficiaries, there is still a persuasive reason\nfor Congress to have written the statute to mandate just\nwhat my interpretation requires. Given the burden of\nprivate school placement, it makes good sense to require\nparents to try to devise a satisfactory alternative within\nthe public schools, by taking part in the collaborative\nprocess of developing an IEP that is the “modus operandi”\nof the IDEA. Burlington, 471 U. S., at 368. And if some\ntime, and some educational opportunity, is lost in conse\nquence, this only shows what we have realized before, that\nno policy is ever pursued to the ultimate, single-minded\nlimit, and that “[t]he IDEA obviously does not seek to\npromote [its] goals at the expense of all considerations,\nincluding fiscal considerations,” Arlington Central School\nDist.

But Congress\nprovided a statement to the contrary in 1997; the only reading that\ngives effect to §1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) is that reimbursement is not permit\nted absent prior placement, and the only question for the Court now is\nwhether Congress could have meant what it said.\n   6 See 143 Cong.

Argued April 28, 2009—Decided June 22, 2009\nAfter a private specialist diagnosed respondent with learning disabili\n  ties, his parents unilaterally removed him from petitioner public\n  school district (School District), enrolled him in a private academy,\n  and requested an administrative hearing on his eligibility for special\n  education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education\n  Act (IDEA), 20 U. S. C. §1400 et seq. The School District found re\n  spondent ineligible for such services and declined to offer him an in\n  dividualized education program (IEP). Concluding that the School\n  District had failed to provide respondent a “free appropriate public\n  education” as required by IDEA, §1412(a)(1)(A), and that respon\n  dent’s private-school placement was appropriate, the hearing officer\n  ordered the School District to reimburse his parents for his private\n  school tuition. The District Court set aside the award, holding that\n  the IDEA Amendments of 1997 (Amendments) categorically bar re\n  imbursement unless a child has “previously received special educa\n  tion or related services under the [school’s] authority.”\n  §1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). Reversing, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the\n  Amendments did not diminish the authority of courts to grant reim\n  bursement as “appropriate” relief pursuant to §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii). See\n  School Comm. of Burlington v. Department of Ed. of Mass., 471 U. S.\n  359, 370.\nHeld: IDEA authorizes reimbursement for private special-education\n services when a public school fails to provide a FAPE and the private\n school placement is appropriate, regardless of whether the child pre\n viously received special-education services through the public school.\n Pp. 6–17.\n    (a) This Court held in Burlington and Florence County School Dist.\n Four v. Carter, 510 U. S. 7, that §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) authorizes courts\n2                FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T.

That Burlington and Carter involved the\n    deficiency of a proposed IEP does not distinguish this case, nor does\n    the fact that the children in Burlington and Carter had previously re\n    ceived special-education services; the Court’s decision in those cases\n    depended on the Act’s language and purpose rather than the particu\n    lar facts involved. Thus, the reasoning of Burlington and Carter ap\n    plies unless the 1997 Amendments require a different result. Pp. 6–\n    8.\n       (b) The 1997 Amendments do not impose a categorical bar to reim\n    bursement. The Amendments made no change to the central purpose\n    of IDEA or the text of §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii). Because Congress is pre\n    sumed to be aware of, and to adopt, a judicial interpretation of a\n    statute when it reenacts that law without change, Lorillard v. Pons,\n    434 U. S. 575, 580, this Court will continue to read §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii)\n    to authorize reimbursement absent a clear indication that Congress\n    intended to repeal the provision or abrogate Burlington and Carter.\n    The School District’s argument that §1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) limits reim\n    bursement to children who have previously received public special\n    education services is unpersuasive for several reasons: It is not sup\n    ported by IDEA’s text, as the 1997 Amendments do not expressly\n    prohibit reimbursement in this case and the School District offers no\n    evidence that Congress intended to supersede Burlington and Carter;\n    it is at odds with IDEA’s remedial purpose of “ensur[ing] that all\n    children with disabilities have available to them a [FAPE] that em\n    phasizes special education . . . designed to meet their unique needs,”\n    §1400(d)(1)(A); and it would produce a rule bordering on the irra\n    tional by providing a remedy when a school offers a child inadequate\n    special-education services but leaving parents remediless when the\n    school unreasonably denies access to such services altogether.

S. C. §1400 et seq.,\nrequires States receiving federal funding to make a “free\nappropriate public education” (FAPE) available to all\nchildren with disabilities residing in the State,\n§1412(a)(1)(A). We have previously held that when a\npublic school fails to provide a FAPE and a child’s parents\nplace the child in an appropriate private school without\nthe school district’s consent, a court may require the dis\ntrict to reimburse the parents for the cost of the private\neducation. See School Comm. of Burlington v. Department\nof Ed. of Mass., 471 U. S. 359, 370 (1985). The question\npresented in this case is whether the IDEA Amendments\nof 1997 (Amendments), 111 Stat. 37, categorically prohibit\nreimbursement for private-education costs if a child has\nnot “previously received special education and related\nservices under the authority of a public agency.”\n§1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). We hold that the Amendments impose\nno such categorical bar.\n2           FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T. A. \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              I\n\n  Respondent T. A. attended public schools in the Forest\nGrove School District (School District or District) from the\ntime he was in kindergarten through the winter of his\njunior year of high school. From kindergarten through\neighth grade, respondent’s teachers observed that he had\ntrouble paying attention in class and completing his as\nsignments. When respondent entered high school, his\ndifficulties increased.\n  In December 2000, during respondent’s freshman year,\nhis mother contacted the school counselor to discuss re\nspondent’s problems with his schoolwork. At the end of\nthe school year, respondent was evaluated by a school\npsychologist.     After interviewing him, examining his\nschool records, and administering cognitive ability tests,\nthe psychologist concluded that respondent did not need\nfurther testing for any learning disabilities or other health\nimpairments, including attention deficit hyperactivity\ndisorder (ADHD). The psychologist and two other school\nofficials discussed the evaluation results with respondent’s\nmother in June 2001, and all agreed that respondent did\nnot qualify for special-education services. Respondent’s\nparents did not seek review of that decision, although the\nhearing examiner later found that the School District’s\nevaluation was legally inadequate because it failed to\naddress all areas of suspected disability, including ADHD.\n  With extensive help from his family, respondent com\npleted his sophomore year at Forest Grove High School,\nbut his problems worsened during his junior year. In\nFebruary 2003, respondent’s parents discussed with the\nSchool District the possibility of respondent completing\nhigh school through a partnership program with the local\ncommunity college. They also sought private professional\nadvice, and in March 2003 respondent was diagnosed with\nADHD and a number of disabilities related to learning and\nmemory. Advised by the private specialist that respon\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndent would do best in a structured, residential learning\nenvironment, respondent’s parents enrolled him at a\nprivate academy that focuses on educating children with\nspecial needs.\n  Four days after enrolling him in private school, respon\ndent’s parents hired a lawyer to ascertain their rights and\nto give the School District written notice of respondent’s\nprivate placement. A few weeks later, in April 2003,\nrespondent’s parents requested an administrative due\nprocess hearing regarding respondent’s eligibility for\nspecial-education services. In June 2003, the District\nengaged a school psychologist to assist in determining\nwhether respondent had a disability that significantly\ninterfered with his educational performance. Respon\ndent’s parents cooperated with the District during the\nevaluation process. In July 2003, a multidisciplinary team\nmet to discuss whether respondent satisfied IDEA’s dis\nability criteria and concluded that he did not because his\nADHD did not have a sufficiently significant adverse\nimpact on his educational performance. Because the\nSchool District maintained that respondent was not eligi\nble for special-education services and therefore declined to\nprovide an individualized education program (IEP),1 re\nspondent’s parents left him enrolled at the private acad\nemy for his senior year.\n  The administrative review process resumed in Septem\nber 2003. After considering the parties’ evidence, includ\ning the testimony of numerous experts, the hearing officer\nissued a decision in January 2004 finding that respon\ndent’s ADHD adversely affected his educational perform\nance and that the School District failed to meet its obliga\n\n——————\n  1 An IEP is an education plan tailored to a child’s unique needs that is\ndesigned by the school district in consultation with the child’s parents\nafter the child is identified as eligible for special-education services.\nSee 20 U. S. C. §§1412(a)(4), 1414(d).\n4                FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T. A.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntions under IDEA in not identifying respondent as a stu\ndent eligible for special-education services. Because the\nDistrict did not offer respondent a FAPE and his private\nschool placement was appropriate under IDEA, the hear\ning officer ordered the District to reimburse respondent’s\nparents for the cost of the private-school tuition.2\n   The School District sought judicial review pursuant to\n§1415(i)(2), arguing that the hearing officer erred in grant\ning reimbursement. The District Court accepted the\nhearing officer’s findings of fact but set aside the reim\nbursement award after finding that the 1997 Amendments\ncategorically bar reimbursement of private-school tuition\nfor students who have not “previously received special\neducation and related services under the authority of a\npublic agency.” §612(a)(10)(C)(ii), 111 Stat. 63, 20 U. S. C.\n§1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). The District Court further held that,\n“[e]ven assuming that tuition reimbursement may be\nordered in an extreme case for a student not receiving\nspecial education services, under general principles of\nequity where the need for special education was obvious to\nschool authorities,” the facts of this case do not support\nequitable relief. App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and\nremanded for further proceedings. The court first noted\nthat, prior to the 1997 Amendments, “IDEA was silent on\nthe subject of private school reimbursement, but courts\nhad granted such reimbursement as ‘appropriate’ relief\nunder principles of equity pursuant to 20 U. S. C.\n§1415(i)(2)(C).” 523 F. 3d 1078, 1085 (2008) (citing Bur\nlington, 471 U. S., at 370). It then held that the Amend\nments do not impose a categorical bar to reimbursement\n\n——————\n    2 Althoughit was respondent’s parents who initially sought reim\nbursement, when respondent reached the age of majority in 2003 his\nparents’ rights under IDEA transferred to him pursuant to Ore. Admin.\nRule 581–015–2325(1) (2008).\n                    Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                  5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen a parent unilaterally places in private school a child\nwho has not previously received special-education services\nthrough the public school. Rather, such students “are\neligible for reimbursement, to the same extent as before\nthe 1997 amendments, as ‘appropriate’ relief pursuant to\n§1415(i)(2)(C).” 523 F. 3d, at 1087–1088.\n   The Court of Appeals also rejected the District Court’s\nanalysis of the equities as resting on two legal errors.\nFirst, because it found that §1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) generally\nbars relief in these circumstances, the District Court\nwrongly stated that relief was appropriate only if the\nequities were sufficient to “ ‘override’ ” that statutory limi\ntation. The District Court also erred in asserting that\nreimbursement is limited to “ ‘extreme’ ” cases. Id., at 1088\n(emphasis deleted). The Court of Appeals therefore re\nmanded with instructions to reexamine the equities, in\ncluding the failure of respondent’s parents to notify the\nSchool District before removing respondent from public\nschool. In dissent, Judge Rymer stated her view that\nreimbursement is not available as an equitable remedy in\nthis case because respondent’s parents did not request an\nIEP before removing him from public school and respon\ndent’s right to a FAPE was therefore not at issue.\n   Because the Courts of Appeals that have considered this\nquestion have reached inconsistent results,3 we granted\ncertiorari to determine whether §1412(a)(10)(C) estab\nlishes a categorical bar to tuition reimbursement for stu\ndents who have not previously received special-education\nservices under the authority of a public education agency.\n——————\n  3 Compare Frank G. v. Board of Ed. of Hyde Park, 459 F. 3d 356, 376\n\n(CA2 2006) (holding that §1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) does not bar reimburse\nment for students who have not previously received public special\neducation services), and M.

A.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n555 U. S. ___ (2009).4\n                              II\n   Justice Rehnquist’s opinion for a unanimous Court in\nBurlington provides the pertinent background for our\nanalysis of the question presented. In that case, respon\ndent challenged the appropriateness of the IEP developed\nfor his child by public-school officials. The child had pre\nviously received special-education services through the\npublic school. While administrative review was pending,\nprivate specialists advised respondent that the child would\ndo best in a specialized private educational setting, and\nrespondent enrolled the child in private school without the\nschool district’s consent. The hearing officer concluded\nthat the IEP was not adequate to meet the child’s educa\ntional needs and that the school district therefore failed to\nprovide the child a FAPE. Finding also that the private\nschool placement was appropriate under IDEA, the hear\ning officer ordered the school district to reimburse respon\ndent for the cost of the private-school tuition.\n   We granted certiorari in Burlington to determine\nwhether IDEA authorizes reimbursement for the cost of\nprivate education when a parent or guardian unilaterally\nenrolls a child in private school because the public school\nhas proposed an inadequate IEP and thus failed to provide\na FAPE. The Act at that time made no express reference\nto the possibility of reimbursement, but it authorized a\ncourt to “grant such relief as the court determines is ap\npropriate.” §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii).5 In determining the scope\n——————\n    4 We previously granted certiorari to address this question in Board\nof Ed. of City School Dist. of New York v. Tom F., 552 U. S. 1 (2007), in\nwhich we affirmed without opinion the judgment of the Court of Ap\npeals for the Second Circuit by an equally divided vote.\n   5 At the time we decided Burlington, that provision was codified at\n\n§1415(e)(2). The 1997 Amendments renumbered the provision but did\nnot alter its text. For ease of reference, we refer to the provision by its\ncurrent section number, §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii).\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nof the relief authorized, we noted that “the ordinary mean\ning of these words confers broad discretion on the court”\nand that, absent any indication to the contrary, what relief\nis “appropriate” must be determined in light of the Act’s\nbroad purpose of providing children with disabilities a\nFAPE, including through publicly funded private-school\nplacements when necessary. 471 U. S., at 369. Accord\ningly, we held that the provision’s grant of authority in\ncludes “the power to order school authorities to reimburse\nparents for their expenditures on private special-education\nservices if the court ultimately determines that such place\nment, rather than a proposed IEP, is proper under the\nAct.” Ibid.\n   Our decision rested in part on the fact that administra\ntive and judicial review of a parent’s complaint often takes\nyears. We concluded that, having mandated that partici\npating States provide a FAPE for every student, Congress\ncould not have intended to require parents to either accept\nan inadequate public-school education pending adjudica\ntion of their claim or bear the cost of a private education if\nthe court ultimately determined that the private place\nment was proper under the Act. Id., at 370. Eight years\nlater, we unanimously reaffirmed the availability of reim\nbursement in Florence County School Dist. Four v. Carter,\n510 U. S. 7 (1993) (holding that reimbursement may be\nappropriate even when a child is placed in a private school\nthat has not been approved by the State).\n   The dispute giving rise to the present litigation differs\nfrom those in Burlington and Carter in that it concerns not\nthe adequacy of a proposed IEP but the School District’s\nfailure to provide an IEP at all. And, unlike respondent,\nthe children in those cases had previously received public\nspecial-education services. These differences are insignifi\ncant, however, because our analysis in the earlier cases\ndepended on the language and purpose of the Act and not\nthe particular facts involved. Moreover, when a child\n8             FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T. A.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nrequires special-education services, a school district’s\nfailure to propose an IEP of any kind is at least as serious\na violation of its responsibilities under IDEA as a failure\nto provide an adequate IEP. It is thus clear that the\nreasoning of Burlington and Carter applies equally to this\ncase. The only question is whether the 1997 Amendments\nrequire a different result.\n                             III\n   Congress enacted IDEA in 19706 to ensure that all\nchildren with disabilities are provided “ ‘a free appropriate\npublic education which emphasizes special education and\nrelated services designed to meet their unique needs [and]\nto assure that the rights of [such] children and their par\nents or guardians are protected.’ ” Burlington, 471 U. S.,\nat 367 (quoting 20 U. S. C. §1400(c) (1982 ed.), now codi\nfied as amended at §§1400(d)(1)(A), (B)). After examining\nthe States’ progress under IDEA, Congress found in 1997\nthat substantial gains had been made in the area of spe\ncial education but that more needed to be done to guaran\ntee children with disabilities adequate access to appropri\nate services. See S. Rep. No. 105–17, p. 5 (1997). The\n1997 Amendments were intended “to place greater em\nphasis on improving student performance and ensuring\nthat children with disabilities receive a quality public\neducation.” Id., at 3.\n   Consistent with that goal, the Amendments preserved\nthe Act’s purpose of providing a FAPE to all children with\ndisabilities. And they did not change the text of the provi\nsion we considered in Burlington, §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii), which\ngives courts broad authority to grant “appropriate” relief,\nincluding reimbursement for the cost of private special\n——————\n    6 Thelegislation was enacted as the Education of the Handicapped\nAct, title VI of Pub. L. 91–230, 84 Stat. 175, and was renamed the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1990, see §901(a)(3),\nPub. L. 101–476, 104 Stat. 1142.\n                   Cite as: 557 U.

Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 580 (1978). Accordingly,\nabsent a clear expression elsewhere in the Amendments of\nCongress’ intent to repeal some portion of that provision or\nto abrogate our decisions in Burlington and Carter, we will\ncontinue to read §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) to authorize the relief\nrespondent seeks.\n  The School District and the dissent argue that one of the\nprovisions enacted by the Amendments, §1412(a)(10)(C),\neffects such a repeal. Section 1412(a)(10)(C) is entitled\n“Payment for education of children enrolled in private\nschools without consent of or referral by the public\nagency,” and it sets forth a number of principles applicable\nto public reimbursement for the costs of unilateral private\nschool placements. Section 1412(a)(10)(C)(i) states that\nIDEA “does not require a local educational agency to pay\nfor the cost of education . . . of a child with a disability at a\nprivate school or facility if that agency made a free appro\npriate public education available to the child” and his\nparents nevertheless elected to place him in a private\nschool. Section 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) then provides that a\n“court or hearing officer may require [a public] agency to\nreimburse the parents for the cost of [private-school]\nenrollment if the court or hearing officer finds that the\nagency had not made a free appropriate public education\navailable” and the child has “previously received special\neducation and related services under the authority of [the]\nagency.” Finally, §1412(a)(10)(C)(iii) discusses circum\nstances under which the “cost of reimbursement described\nin clause (ii) may be reduced or denied,” as when a parent\nfails to give 10 days’ notice before removing a child from\npublic school or refuses to make a child available for\nevaluation, and §1412(a)(10)(C)(iv) lists circumstances in\n10             FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T. A.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich a parent’s failure to give notice may or must be\nexcused.7\n   Looking primarily to clauses (i) and (ii), the School\nDistrict argues that Congress intended §1412(a)(10)(C) to\nprovide the exclusive source of authority for courts to\norder reimbursement when parents unilaterally enroll a\nchild in private school. According to the District, clause (i)\nprovides a safe harbor for school districts that provide a\nFAPE by foreclosing reimbursement in those circum\nstances. Clause (ii) then sets forth the circumstance in\nwhich reimbursement is appropriate—namely, when a\nschool district fails to provide a FAPE to a child who has\npreviously received special-education services through the\npublic school.      The District contends that because\n§1412(a)(10)(C) only discusses reimbursement for children\nwho have previously received special-education services\nthrough the public school, IDEA only authorizes reim\nbursement in that circumstance. The dissent agrees.\n   For several reasons, we find this argument unpersua\nsive. First, the School District’s reading of the Act is not\nsupported by its text and context, as the 1997 Amend\nments do not expressly prohibit reimbursement under the\ncircumstances of this case, and the District offers no evi\ndence that Congress intended to supersede our decisions\nin Burlington and Carter. Clause (i)’s safe harbor explic\nitly bars reimbursement only when a school district makes\na FAPE available by correctly identifying a child as having\na disability and proposing an IEP adequate to meet the\nchild’s needs. The clause says nothing about the availabil\nity of reimbursement when a school district fails to provide\na FAPE. Indeed, its statement that reimbursement is not\nauthorized when a school district provides a FAPE could\nbe read to indicate that reimbursement is authorized\n——————\n  7 The full text of §1412(a)(10)(C) is set forth in the Appendix, infra,\n\nat 18.\n                      Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen a school district does not fulfill that obligation.\n   Clause (ii) likewise does not support the District’s posi\ntion. Because that clause is phrased permissively, stating\nonly that courts “may require” reimbursement in those\ncircumstances, it does not foreclose reimbursement\nawards in other circumstances. Together with clauses (iii)\nand (iv), clause (ii) is best read as elaborating on the gen\neral rule that courts may order reimbursement when a\nschool district fails to provide a FAPE by listing factors\nthat may affect a reimbursement award in the common\nsituation in which a school district has provided a child\nwith some special-education services and the child’s par\nents believe those services are inadequate. Referring as\nthey do to students who have previously received special\neducation services through a public school, clauses (ii)\nthrough (iv) are premised on a history of cooperation and\ntogether encourage school districts and parents to con\ntinue to cooperate in developing and implementing an\nappropriate IEP before resorting to a unilateral private\nplacement.8 The clauses of §1412(a)(10)(C) are thus best\nread as elucidative rather than exhaustive. Cf. United\n——————\n   8 The dissent asserts that, under this reading of the Act, “Congress\n\nhas called for reducing reimbursement only for the most deserving . . .\nbut provided no mechanism to reduce reimbursement to the least\ndeserving.” Post, at 6 (opinion of SOUTER, J.). In addition to making\nunsubstantiated generalizations about the desert of parents whose\nchildren have been denied public special-education services, the dissent\ngrossly mischaracterizes our view of §1412(a)(10)(C). The fact that\nclause (iii) permits a court to reduce a reimbursement award when a\nparent whose child has previously received special-education services\nfails to give the school adequate notice of an intended private place\nment does not mean that it prohibits courts from similarly reducing the\namount of reimbursement when a parent whose child has not previ\nously received services fails to give such notice. Like clause (ii), clause\n(iii) provides guidance regarding the appropriateness of relief in a\ncommon factual scenario, and its instructions should not be understood\nto preclude courts and hearing officers from considering similar factors\nin other scenarios.\n12             FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v.

S. 128, 137\n(2007) (noting that statutory language may “perfor[m] a\nsignificant function simply by clarifying” a provision’s\nmeaning).9\n  This reading of §1412(a)(10)(C) is necessary to avoid the\nconclusion that Congress abrogated sub silentio our deci\nsions in Burlington and Carter. In those cases, we con\nstrued §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) to authorize reimbursement when\na school district fails to provide a FAPE and a child’s\nprivate-school placement is appropriate, without regard to\nthe child’s prior receipt of services.10 It would take more\nthan Congress’ failure to comment on the category of cases\nin which a child has not previously received special\neducation services for us to conclude that the Amendments\nsubstantially superseded our decisions and in large part\n——————\n  9 In arguing that §1412(a)(10)(C) is the exclusive source of authority\nfor granting reimbursement awards to parents who unilaterally place a\nchild in private school, the dissent neglects to explain that provision’s\nfailure to limit the type of private-school placements for which parents\nmay be reimbursed. School Comm. of Burlington v. Department of Ed.\nof Mass. held that courts may grant reimbursement under\n§1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) only when a school district fails to provide a FAPE\nand the private-school placement is appropriate. See 471 U. S. 359,\n369 (1985); see Florence County School Dist. Four v. Carter, 510 U. S. 7,\n12–13 (1993). The latter requirement is essential to ensuring that\nreimbursement awards are granted only when such relief furthers the\npurposes of the Act. See Burlington, 471 U. S., at 369. That\n§1412(a)(10)(C) did not codify that requirement further indicates that\nCongress did not intend that provision to supplant §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) as\nthe sole authority on reimbursement awards but rather meant to\naugment the latter provision and our decisions construing it.\n  10 As discussed above, although the children in Burlington and Carter\n\nhad previously received special-education services in public school, our\ndecisions in no way depended on their prior receipt of services. Those\nholdings rested instead on the breadth of the authority conferred by\n§1415(i)(2)(C)(iii), the interest in providing relief consistent with the\nAct’s purpose, and the injustice that a contrary reading would produce,\nsee Burlington, 471 U. S., at 369–370; see also Carter, 510 U. S., at 12–\n14—considerations that were not altered by the 1997 Amendments.\n                      Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                     13\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nrepealed §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii). See Branch v. Smith, 538\nU. S. 254, 273 (2003) (“[A]bsent a clearly expressed con\ngressional intention, repeals by implication are not fa\nvored” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).11\nWe accordingly adopt the reading of §1412(a)(10)(C) that\nis consistent with those decisions.12\n   The School District’s reading of §1412(a)(10)(C) is also\nat odds with the general remedial purpose underlying\nIDEA and the 1997 Amendments. The express purpose of\nthe Act is to “ensure that all children with disabilities\nhave available to them a free appropriate public education\n——————\n   11 For the same reason, we reject the District’s argument that because\n\n§1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) authorizes “a court or a hearing officer” to award\nreimbursement for private-school tuition, whereas §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii)\nonly provides a general grant of remedial authority to “court[s],” the\nlatter section cannot be read to authorize hearing officers to award\nreimbursement. That argument ignores our decision in Burlington, 471\nU. S., at 363, 370, which interpreted §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) to authorize\nhearing officers as well as courts to award reimbursement notwith\nstanding the provision’s silence with regard to hearing officers. When\nCongress amended IDEA without altering the text of §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii),\nit implicitly adopted that construction of the statute. See Lorillard v.\nPons, 434 U. S. 575, 580–581 (1978).\n   12 Looking to the Amendments’ legislative history for support, the\n\nSchool District cites two House and Senate Reports that essentially\nrestate the text of §1412(a)(10)(C)(ii), H. R. Rep. No. 105–95, pp. 92–93\n(1997); S. Rep. No. 105–17, p. 13 (1997), and a floor statement by\nRepresentative Mike Castle, 143 Cong. Rec. 8013 (1997) (stating that\nthe “bill makes it harder for parents to unilaterally place a child in elite\nprivate schools at public taxpayer expense, lowering costs to local\nschool districts”). Those ambiguous references do not undermine the\nmeaning that we discern from the statute’s language and context.\n   Notably, the agency charged with implementing IDEA has adopted\nrespondent’s reading of the statute. In commentary to regulations\nimplementing the 1997 Amendments, the Department of Education\nstated that “hearing officers and courts retain their authority, recog\nnized in Burlington . . . to award ‘appropriate’ relief if a public agency\nhas failed to provide FAPE, including reimbursement . . . in instances\nin which the child has not yet received special education and related\nservices.” 64 Fed. Reg. 12602 (1999); see 71 Fed. Reg. 46599 (2006).\n14          FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T. A.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat emphasizes special education and related services\ndesigned to meet their unique needs,” §1400(d)(1)(A)—a\nfactor we took into account in construing the scope of\n§1415(i)(2)(C)(iii), see Burlington, 471 U. S., at 369. With\nout the remedy respondent seeks, a “child’s right to a free\nappropriate education . . . would be less than complete.”\nId., at 370. The District’s position similarly conflicts with\nIDEA’s “child find” requirement, pursuant to which States\nare obligated to “identif[y], locat[e], and evaluat[e]” “[a]ll\nchildren with disabilities residing in the State” to ensure\nthat they receive needed special-education services.\n§1412(a)(3)(A); see §1412(a)(10)(A)(ii). A reading of the\nAct that left parents without an adequate remedy when a\nschool district unreasonably failed to identify a child with\ndisabilities would not comport with Congress’ acknowl\nedgment of the paramount importance of properly identi\nfying each child eligible for services.\n  Indeed, by immunizing a school district’s refusal to find\na child eligible for special-education services no matter\nhow compelling the child’s need, the School District’s\ninterpretation of §1412(a)(10)(C) would produce a rule\nbordering on the irrational. It would be particularly\nstrange for the Act to provide a remedy, as all agree it\ndoes, when a school district offers a child inadequate\nspecial-education services but to leave parents without\nrelief in the more egregious situation in which the school\ndistrict unreasonably denies a child access to such services\naltogether. That IDEA affords parents substantial proce\ndural safeguards, including the right to challenge a school\ndistrict’s eligibility determination and obtain prospective\nrelief, see post, at 11, is no answer. We roundly rejected\nthat argument in Burlington, observing that the “review\nprocess is ponderous” and therefore inadequate to ensure\nthat a school’s failure to provide a FAPE is remedied with\nthe speed necessary to avoid detriment to the child’s edu\ncation. 471 U. S., at 370. Like Burlington, see ibid., this\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncase vividly demonstrates the problem of delay, as respon\ndent’s parents first sought a due process hearing in April\n2003, and the District Court issued its decision in May\n2005—almost a year after respondent graduated from\nhigh school. The dissent all but ignores these shortcom\nings of IDEA’s procedural safeguards.\n                              IV\n   The School District advances two additional arguments\nfor reading the Act to foreclose reimbursement in this\ncase. First, the District contends that because IDEA was\nan exercise of Congress’ authority under the Spending\nClause, U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 1, any conditions at\ntached to a State’s acceptance of funds must be stated\nunambiguously. See Pennhurst State School and Hospital\nv. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981). Applying that prin\nciple, we held in Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed.\nv. Murphy, 548 U. S. 291, 304 (2006), that IDEA’s fee\nshifting provision, §1415(i)(3)(B), does not authorize courts\nto award expert-services fees to prevailing parents in\nIDEA actions because the Act does not put States on\nnotice of the possibility of such awards. But Arlington is\nreadily distinguishable from this case. In accepting IDEA\nfunding, States expressly agree to provide a FAPE to all\nchildren with disabilities. See §1412(a)(1)(A). An order\nawarding reimbursement of private-education costs when\na school district fails to provide a FAPE merely requires\nthe district “to belatedly pay expenses that it should have\npaid all along.” Burlington, 471 U. S., at 370–371. And\nStates have in any event been on notice at least since our\ndecision in Burlington that IDEA authorizes courts to\norder reimbursement of the costs of private special\neducation services in appropriate circumstances. Penn\nhurst’s notice requirement is thus clearly satisfied.\n  Finally, the District urges that respondent’s reading of\nthe Act will impose a substantial financial burden on\n16          FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T. A.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npublic school districts and encourage parents to immedi\nately enroll their children in private school without first\nendeavoring to cooperate with the school district. The\ndissent echoes this concern. See post, at 10. For several\nreasons, those fears are unfounded. Parents “are entitled\nto reimbursement only if a federal court concludes both\nthat the public placement violated IDEA and the private\nschool placement was proper under the Act.” Carter, 510\nU. S., at 15. And even then courts retain discretion to\nreduce the amount of a reimbursement award if the equi\nties so warrant—for instance, if the parents failed to give\nthe school district adequate notice of their intent to enroll\nthe child in private school. In considering the equities,\ncourts should generally presume that public-school offi\ncials are properly performing their obligations under\nIDEA. See Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. 49, 62–63 (2005)\n(STEVENS, J., concurring). As a result of these criteria and\nthe fact that parents who “ ‘unilaterally change their\nchild’s placement during the pendency of review proceed\nings, without the consent of state or local school officials,\ndo so at their own financial risk,’ ” Carter, 510 U. S., at 15\n(quoting Burlington, 471 U. S., at 373–374), the incidence\nof private-school placement at public expense is quite\nsmall, see Brief for National Disability Rights Network\net al. as Amici Curiae 13–14.\n                               V\n   The IDEA Amendments of 1997 did not modify the text\nof §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii), and we do not read §1412(a)(10)(C) to\nalter that provision’s meaning. Consistent with our deci\nsions in Burlington and Carter, we conclude that IDEA\nauthorizes reimbursement for the cost of private special\neducation services when a school district fails to provide a\nFAPE and the private-school placement is appropriate,\nregardless of whether the child previously received special\neducation or related services through the public school.\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   When a court or hearing officer concludes that a school\ndistrict failed to provide a FAPE and the private place\nment was suitable, it must consider all relevant factors,\nincluding the notice provided by the parents and the\nschool district’s opportunities for evaluating the child, in\ndetermining whether reimbursement for some or all of the\ncost of the child’s private education is warranted. As the\nCourt of Appeals noted, the District Court did not properly\nconsider the equities in this case and will need to under\ntake that analysis on remand. Accordingly, the judgment\nof the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n18             FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T.

Department of Ed. of\nMass., 471 U. S. 359 (1985), held that the Education of the\nHandicapped Act, 84 Stat. 175, now known as the Indi\nviduals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U. S. C.\n§1400 et seq., authorized a district court to order reim\nbursement of private school tuition and expenses to par\nents who took their disabled child from public school\nbecause the school’s special education services did not\nmeet the child’s needs. We said that, for want of any\nspecific limitation, this remedy was within the general\nauthorization for courts to award “such relief as [they]\ndetermin[e] is appropriate.” §1415(e)(2) (1982 ed.) (now\ncodified at §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) (2006 ed.)). In 1997, however,\nCongress amended the IDEA with a number of provisions\nexplicitly addressing the issue of “[p]ayment for education\nof children enrolled in private schools without consent of\nor referral by the public agency.” §1412(a)(10)(C). These\namendments generally prohibit reimbursement if the\nschool district made a “free appropriate public education”\n(FAPE) available, §1412(a)(10)(C)(i), and if they are to\nhave any effect, there is no exception except by agreement,\n§1412(a)(10)(B), or for a student who previously received\n2            FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T. A.\n\n                      SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nspecial education services that were inadequate,\n§1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).\n   The majority says otherwise and holds that\n§1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) places no limit on reimbursements for\nprivate tuition. The Court does not find the provision\nclear enough to affect the rule in Burlington, and it does\nnot believe Congress meant to limit public reimbursement\nfor unilaterally incurred private school tuition. But there\nis no authority for a heightened standard before Congress\ncan alter a prior judicial interpretation of a statute, and\nthe assessment of congressional policy aims falls short of\ntrumping what seems to me to be the clear limitation\nimposed by §1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).\n\n                                I\n   In Burlington, parents of a child with a learning dis\nability tried for over eight years to work out a satisfactory\nindividualized education plan (IEP) for their son. 471\nU. S., at 361–362. They eventually gave up and sent the\nboy to a private school for disabled children, id., at 362,\nand we took the ensuing case to decide whether the Edu\ncation of the Handicapped Act authorized courts to order\nreimbursement for private special education “if the court\nultimately determines that such placement, rather than a\nproposed IEP, is proper under the Act,” id., at 369. After\nnoting various sections that “emphasiz[e] the participation\nof the parents in developing the child’s [public] educa\ntional program,” id., at 368, we inferred that the Act au\nthorized reimbursement by providing that a district court\nshall “ ‘grant such relief as [it] determines is appropriate,’ ”\nid., at 369 (quoting what is now §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); altera\ntion in original). We emphasized that the Act did not\nspeak specifically to the issue of reimbursement, and held\nthat “[a]bsent other reference,” reimbursement for private\ntuition and expenses would be an “ ‘appropriate’ ” remedy\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

In\nshort, we read the general provision for ordering equitable\nremedies in §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) as authorizing a reim\nbursement order, in large part because Congress had not\nspoken more specifically to the issue.\n  But Congress did speak explicitly when it amended the\nIDEA in 1997. It first said that whenever the State or a\nlocal educational agency refers a student to private special\neducation, the bill is a public expense. See 20 U. S. C.\n§1412(a)(10)(B). It then included several clauses address\ning “[p]ayment for education of children enrolled in private\nschools without consent of or referral by the public\nagency.” §1412(a)(10)(C). The first contrasts with the\nprovision covering an agency referral:\n    “(i) In general\n    “. . . this subchapter does not require a local educa\n    tional agency to pay for the cost of education . . . of a\n    child with a disability at a private school or facility if\n    that agency made a free appropriate public education\n    available to the child and the parents elected to place\n    the child in such private school or facility.”\n    §1412(a)(10)(C).\nThe second clause covers the case in which the school\nauthority failed to make a FAPE available in its schools.\nIt does not, however, provide simply that the authority\nmust pay in this case, no matter what. Instead it provides\nthis:\n    “(ii) Reimbursement for private school placement\n      “If the parents of a child with a disability, who pre\n    viously received special education and related services\n    under the authority of a public agency, enroll the child\n    in a private elementary school or secondary school\n    without the consent of or referral by the public\n    agency, a court or a hearing officer may require the\n4                 FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T.

As the\nmajority suggests, ante, at 10–11, clause (i) could theoreti\ncally be understood to imply that reimbursement may be\nordered whenever a school district fails to provide a FAPE,\nand clause (ii) could be read as merely taking care to\nmention one of a variety of circumstances in which such\nreimbursement is permitted. But this is overstretching.\nWhen permissive language covers a special case, the natu\nral sense of it is taken to prohibit what it fails to author\nize. When a mother tells a boy that he may go out and\nplay after his homework is done, he knows what she\nmeans.\n   So does anyone who reads the authorization of a reim\nbursement order in the case of “a child with a disability,\nwho previously received special education and related\nservices under the authority of a public agency.”\n§1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).1 If the mother did not mean that the\n——————\n    1 Likewise,no one is unsure whether this Court’s Rule 18.6, which\nstates, “Within 30 days after the case is placed on this Court’s docket,\nthe appellee may file a motion to dismiss . . . ,” allows for a motion to\ndismiss after 30 days. See also Carlisle v. United States, 517 U. S. 416,\n431–32 (1996) (listing numerous examples of permissive statements,\nsuch as then Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 17(d)’s statement that\na subpoena “may be served” by a person “who is not less than 18 years\nof age,” that plainly carry a restrictive meaning).\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

I would read clause (i) as writ\nten on the assumption that the school authorities can be\nexpected to honor their obligations and as stating the\ngeneral rule that unilateral placement cannot be reim\nbursed. See §1412(a)(10)(C)(i) (“In general . . . ”). And I\nwould read clause (ii) as imposing a receipt of prior ser\n——————\n  2 The majority says that “clause (ii) is best read as elaborating on the\n\ngeneral rule that courts may order reimbursement when a school\ndistrict fails to provide a FAPE by listing factors that may affect a\nreimbursement award in the common situation in which a school\ndistrict has provided a child with some special-education services and\nthe child’s parents believe those services are inadequate.” Ante, at 11.\nBut this is just another way of reading the provision off the books. On\nthe majority’s reading, clause (ii) states only that a court may award\nreimbursement when (1) there is a previous receipt of special education\nservices and (2) a failure to provide a FAPE. Such a description of the\nmost common subset of a category already described may be called\nelaboration, but it still has no effect on the statutory scheme.\n6           FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v.

See\n§1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) (“Reimbursement for private school\nplacement . . . ”).\n   This reading can claim the virtue of avoiding a further\nanomaly. Section 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii), which limits other\nwise available reimbursement, is expressly directed to\n“[t]he cost of reimbursement described in clause (ii).” This\nmakes perfect sense under my reading. Since clause (ii) is\nnow the exclusive source of authority to order reimburse\nment, it is natural to refer to it in the clause setting out\nthe conditions for reducing or even denying reimburse\nment otherwise authorized. Yet, as T. A. and the Gov\nernment concede, Brief for Respondent 22; Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 4, 17, under the major\nity’s reading, Congress has called for reducing reimburse\nment only for the most deserving (parents described in\nclause (ii) who consult with the school district and give\npublic special education services a try before demanding\npayment for private education), but provided no mecha\nnism to reduce reimbursement to the least deserving\n(parents who have not given public placement a chance).\n   The Court responds to this point by doubling down.\nAccording to the majority, the criteria listed in clause (iii)\ncan justify a reduction not only of “reimbursement de\nscribed in clause (ii),” §1412(a)(10)(C)(iii), but can also do\nso for a reimbursement order authorized elsewhere as\nwell, ante, at 11 n. 8. That is, the majority avoids ascrib\ning perverse motives to Congress by concluding that in\nboth clause (ii) and clause (iii), Congress meant to add\nnothing to the statutory scheme. This simply leads back\nto the question of why Congress in §1412(a)(10)(C) would\nhave been so concerned with cases in which children had\nnot previously received special education services when,\non the majority’s reading, the prior receipt of services has\nno relevance whatsoever to the subject of that provision.\n                    Cite as: 557 U.

Ante, at 8–12. The majority refers to two distinct\nprinciples for support: first, statutes are to be read with a\npresumption against implied repeals, e.g., ante, at 12–13\n(citing Branch v. Smith, 538 U. S. 254, 273 (2003) (plural\nity opinion)), and second, congressional reenactment of\nstatutory text without change is deemed to ratify a prior\njudicial interpretation of it, e.g., ante, at 8–9 (citing Loril\nlard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 580 (1978)). I think neither\nprinciple is up to the task.\n   Section 1412(a)(10)(C) in no way repealed the provision\nwe considered in Burlington.3 The relief that “is appropri\nate” under §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) depends on the substantive\nprovisions of the IDEA as surely as if the provision author\n——————\n  3 The presumption against implied repeals would not justify reading\n\nthe later provision as useless even if it applied since, when two provi\nsions are irreconcilable, the presumption against implied repeals gives\nway to the later enactment. See Branch v. Smith, 538 U. S. 254, 273\n(2003) (plurality opinion).\n8             FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T. A.\n\n                        SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nized equitable relief “consistent with the provisions of this\nstatute.”4 When we applied §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) in Burling\nton, we expressly referred to those provisions and con\ncluded that, in the absence of a specific rule, “appropriate”\nrelief included the reimbursement sought. By introducing\nnew restrictions on reimbursement, the 1997 Amendments\nproduce a different conclusion about what relief is “appro\npriate.” But §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) remains in effect, just as it\nwould remain in effect if Congress had explicitly amended\nthe IDEA to prohibit reimbursement absent prior receipt\nof services.\n   As for the rule that reenactment incorporates prior\ninterpretation, the Court’s reliance on it to preserve Bur\nlington’s reading of §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) faces two hurdles.\nFirst, so far as I can tell, this maxim has never been used\nto impose a clear statement rule. If Congress does not\nsuggest otherwise, reenacted statutory language retains\nits old meaning; but when a new enactment includes\nlanguage undermining the prior reading, there is no pre\nsumption favoring the old, and the only course open is\nsimply to read the revised statute as a whole. This is so\nbecause there is no reason to distinguish between amend\nments that occur in a single clause (as if Congress had\nplaced all the changes in §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii)), and those that\ntake the form of a separate section (here, §1412(a)(10)(C)).\nIf Congress had added a caveat within §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii),\nor in an immediately neighboring provision, I assume the\nmajority would not approach it with skepticism on the\nground that it purported to modify a prior judicial inter\npretation.\n   Second, nothing in my reading of §1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) is\n\n——————\n    4 No\n       one, for example, would suggest that a court could grant reim\nbursement under §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) to parents of a nondisabled child,\nbut this is obvious only because we assume §1415(i)(2)(C)(iii) is to be\nread in light of the substantive provisions of the statute.\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\ninconsistent with the holdings of Burlington and the other\nprior decision on the subject, Florence County School Dist.\nFour v. Carter, 510 U. S. 7 (1993). Our opinion in Burling\nton was expressly premised on there being no “other refer\nence” that would govern reimbursement for private tui\ntion, 471 U. S., at 369, and this all but invited Congress to\nprovide one. Congress’s provision of such a reference in\n1997 is, to say the very least, no reason for skepticism that\nCongress wished to alter the law on reimbursement. The\n1997 legislation, read my way, would not, however, alter\nthe result in either Burlington or Carter. In each case, the\nschool district had agreed that the child was disabled, the\nparents had cooperated with the district and tried out an\nIEP, and the only question was whether parents who later\nresorted to a private school could be reimbursed “ ‘if the\ncourt ultimately determines that such placement, rather\nthan a proposed IEP, is proper under the Act.’ ” Carter,\nsupra, at 12 (quoting Burlington, supra, at 369). In order\ning reimbursement, the Court in both Burlington and\nCarter emphasized that the parents took part in devising\nan IEP, 471 U. S., at 368; 510 U. S., at 12, and expressed\nconcern for parents who had sought an IEP before placing\ntheir child in private school, but received one that was\ninadequate, 471 U. S., at 370; 510 U. S., at 12. The result\nin each case would have been the same under my reading\nof the amended Act, both sets of parents being “parents of\na child with a disability, who previously received special\neducation and related services under the authority of a\npublic agency.” §1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). It is therefore too\nmuch to suggest that my reading of §1412(a)(10)(C)(ii)\nwould “abrogat[e] sub silentio our decisions in Burlington\nand Carter,” ante, at 12.\n   The majority argues that the policy concerns vindicated\nin Burlington and Carter justify reading those cases to\nauthorize a reimbursement authority going beyond their\nfacts, ante, at 7–8, and would hold reimbursement possible\n10          FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T. A.\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\neven for parents who, like those here, unilaterally resort\nto a private school without first establishing at the admin\nistrative or appellate level that the child is disabled, or\nengaging in a collaborative process with the school offi\ncials. But how broadly one should read Burlington and\nCarter is beside the point, Congress having explicitly\naddressed the subject with statutory language that pre\ncludes the Court’s result today.\n                               B\n   The Court also rejects the natural sense of\n§1412(a)(10)(C) as an interpretation that would be “at\nodds with the general remedial purpose underlying IDEA\nand the 1997 Amendments.” Ante, at 13. The majority\nthinks my reading would place the school authorities in\ntotal control of parents’ eligibility for reimbursement: just\nrefuse any request for special education or services in the\npublic school, and the prior service condition for eligibility\nunder clause (ii) can never be satisfied. Thus, as the\nmajority puts it, it would “borde[r] on the irrational” to\n“immuniz[e] a school district’s refusal to find a child eligi\nble for special-education services no matter how compel\nling the child’s need.” Ibid. I agree that any such scheme\nwould be pretty absurd, but there is no absurdity here.\nThe majority’s suggestion overlooks the terms of the IDEA\nprocess, the substantial procedures protecting a child’s\nsubstantive rights under the IDEA, and the significant\ncosts of its rule.\n   To start with the costs, special education can be im\nmensely expensive, amounting to tens of billions of dollars\nannually and as much as 20% of public schools’ general\noperating budgets. See Brief for Council of the Great City\nSchools as Amicus Curiae 22–23. The more private\nplacement there is, the higher the special education bill, a\nfact that lends urgency to the IDEA’s mandate of a col\nlaborative process in which an IEP is “developed jointly by\n                    Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                 11\n\n                        SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\na school official qualified in special education, the child’s\nteacher, the parents or guardian, and, where appropriate,\nthe child.” Burlington, supra, at 368.\n   The Act’s repeated emphasis on the need for cooperative\njoint action by school and parent does not, however, leave\nthe school in control if officials should wish to block effec\ntive (and expensive) action for the child’s benefit, for if the\ncollaborative approach breaks down, the IDEA provides\nfor quick review in a “due process hearing” of the parents’\nclaim that more services are needed to provide a FAPE\nthan the school is willing to give. See §1415(c)(2) (district\nmust respond to due process hearing complaint within 10\ndays and hearing officer must assess facial validity of\ncomplaint within 5 days); §1415(e) (mediation is available,\nprovided it does not delay due process hearing);\n§1415(f)(1)(B) (district must convene a meeting with par\nents within 15 days to attempt to resolve complaint); 34\nCFR §§300.510(b)(1)–(2) (2008) (if complaint is not re\nsolved, a hearing must be held within 30 days of complaint\nand a decision must be issued within 75 days of com\nplaint). Parents who remain dissatisfied after these first\ntwo levels of process may have a right of appeal to the\nstate educational agency and in any case may bring a\ncourt action in federal district court. See 20 U. S. C.\n§1415(i)(2). This scheme of administrative and judicial\nreview is the answer to the Court’s claim that reading the\nprior services condition as restrictive, not illustrative,\nimmunizes a school district’s intransigence, giving it an\neffective veto on reimbursement for private placement.5\n——————\n  5 The majority argues that we already rejected this process as inade\n\nquate in School Comm. of Burlington v. Department of Ed. of Mass., 471\nU. S. 359 (1985). Ante, at 14. That was before the enactment of\n§1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). The question in Burlington was whether the\nreimbursement there was an “appropriate” remedy under\n§1415(i)(2)(C)(iii). See 471 U. S., at 370. With no statement to the\ncontrary from Congress, the Court expressed concern over the possible\n12             FOREST GROVE SCHOOL DIST. v. T. A.\n\n                         SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\n  That said, the Court of course has a fair point that the\nprior services condition qualifies the remedial objective of\nthe statute, and pursuing appeals to get a satisfactory IEP\nwith special services worth accepting could be discourag\ning. The child who needs help does not stop needing it, or\nstop growing, while schools and parents argue back and\nforth. But we have to decide this case on the premise that\nmost such arguments will be carried on in good faith, and\neven on the assumption that disagreements about the\nadequacy of IEPs will impose some burdens on the Act’s\nintended beneficiaries, there is still a persuasive reason\nfor Congress to have written the statute to mandate just\nwhat my interpretation requires. Given the burden of\nprivate school placement, it makes good sense to require\nparents to try to devise a satisfactory alternative within\nthe public schools, by taking part in the collaborative\nprocess of developing an IEP that is the “modus operandi”\nof the IDEA. Burlington, 471 U. S., at 368. And if some\ntime, and some educational opportunity, is lost in conse\nquence, this only shows what we have realized before, that\nno policy is ever pursued to the ultimate, single-minded\nlimit, and that “[t]he IDEA obviously does not seek to\npromote [its] goals at the expense of all considerations,\nincluding fiscal considerations,” Arlington Central School\nDist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy, 548 U. S. 291, 303 (2006).6\n——————\nlength of the IDEA review process and surmised that Congress would\nhave intended for reimbursement to be authorized. Ibid. But Congress\nprovided a statement to the contrary in 1997; the only reading that\ngives effect to §1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) is that reimbursement is not permit\nted absent prior placement, and the only question for the Court now is\nwhether Congress could have meant what it said.\n   6 See 143 Cong.
