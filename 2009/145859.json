UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 08–67. Argued March 23, 2009—Decided June 18, 2009\nA federal indictment charged petitioner Yeager with securities and wire\n  fraud for allegedly misleading the public about the virtues of a fiber\n  optic telecommunications system offered by his employer, a subsidi\n  ary of Enron Corp., and with insider trading for selling his Enron\n  stock while in possession of material, nonpublic information about\n  the new system’s performance and value to Enron. The indictment\n  also charged petitioner with money laundering for conducting various\n  transactions with the proceeds of his stock sales. The jury acquitted\n  Yeager on the fraud counts but failed to reach a verdict on the in\n  sider-trading and money-laundering counts. After the Government\n  recharged him with some of the insider-trading and money\n  laundering counts, Yeager moved to dismiss the charges on the\n  ground that the jury, by acquitting him on the fraud counts, had nec\n  essarily decided that he did not possess material, nonpublic informa\n  tion about the project’s performance and value, and that the issue\n  preclusion component of the Double Jeopardy Clause therefore\n  barred a second trial for insider trading and money laundering. The\n  District Court denied the motion, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, rea\n  soning that the fact that the jury hung on the insider-trading and\n  money-laundering counts—as opposed to acquitting petitioner—cast\n  doubt on whether it had necessarily decided that petitioner did not\n  possess material, nonpublic information. This inconsistency between\n  the acquittals and the hung counts, the Fifth Circuit concluded,\n  meant that the Government could prosecute petitioner anew for in\n  sider trading and money laundering.\nHeld: An apparent inconsistency between a jury’s verdict of acquittal on\n some counts and its failure to return a verdict on other counts does\n not affect the acquittals’ preclusive force under the Double Jeopardy\n2                      YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    Clause. Pp. 6–15.\n       (a) This case is controlled by the reasoning in Ashe v. Swenson, 397\n    U. S. 436, where the Court squarely held that the Double Jeopardy\n    Clause precludes the Government from relitigating any issue that\n    was necessarily decided by a jury’s acquittal in a prior trial. For\n    double jeopardy purposes, the jury’s inability to reach a verdict on\n    Yeager’s insider-trading and money-laundering counts was a non\n    event that should be given no weight in the issue-preclusion analysis.\n    To identify what a jury necessarily determined at trial, courts should\n    scrutinize the jury’s decisions, not its failures to decide. A jury’s ver\n    dict of acquittal represents the community’s collective judgment re\n    garding all the evidence and arguments presented to it. Even if the\n    verdict is “based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation,” Fong\n    Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141, 143, its finality is unassailable,\n    see, e.g., Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497, 503. Thus, if the pos\n    session of insider information was a critical issue of ultimate fact in\n    all of the charges against Yeager, a jury verdict that necessarily de\n    cided that issue in his favor protects him from prosecution for any\n    charge for which that is an essential element. Pp. 6–12.\n       (b) Neither Richardson v. United States, 468 U. S. 317, nor United\n    States v. Powell, 469 U. S. 57, supports the Government’s argument\n    that it can retry Yeager for insider trading or money laundering.\n    Richardson’s conclusion that a jury’s “failure . . . to reach a verdict is\n    not an event which terminates jeopardy,” 468 U. S., at 325, did not\n    open the door to using a hung count to ignore the preclusive effect of\n    a jury’s acquittal, but was simply a rejection of the argument—\n    similar to the Government’s today—that a mistrial is an event of sig\n    nificance. Also rejected is the contention that an acquittal can never\n    preclude retrial on a hung count because it would impute irrational\n    ity to the jury in violation of Powell’s rule that issue preclusion is\n    “predicated on the assumption that the jury acted rationally,” 469\n    U. S., at 68. The Court’s refusal in Powell and in Dunn v. United\n    States, 284 U. S. 390, to impugn the legitimacy of jury verdicts that,\n    on their face, were logically inconsistent shows, a fortiori, that a po\n    tentially inconsistent hung count could not command a different re\n    sult. Pp. 12–14.\n       (c) The Government has argued that, even if hung counts cannot\n    enter the issue-preclusion analysis, Yeager has failed to show that\n    the jury’s acquittals necessarily resolved in his favor an issue of ulti\n    mate fact that must be proved to convict him of insider trading and\n    money laundering. Having granted certiorari on the assumption that\n    the Fifth Circuit ruled correctly that the acquittals meant the jury\n    found that Yeager did not have insider information that contradicted\n    what was presented to the public, this Court declines to engage in a\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

SCOTT YEAGER, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n                                 [June 18, 2009]\n\n  JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  In Dunn v. United States, 284 U. S. 390, 393 (1932), the\nCourt, speaking through Justice Holmes, held that a\nlogical inconsistency between a guilty verdict and a verdict\nof acquittal does not impugn the validity of either verdict.\nThe question presented in this case is whether an appar\nent inconsistency between a jury’s verdict of acquittal on\nsome counts and its failure to return a verdict on other\ncounts affects the preclusive force of the acquittals under\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. We\nhold that it does not.\n                            I\n   In 1997, Enron Corporation (Enron) acquired a tele\ncommunications business that it expanded and ultimately\nrenamed Enron Broadband Services (EBS). Petitioner F.\nScott Yeager served as Senior Vice President of Strategic\nDevelopment for EBS from October 1, 1998, until his\nemployment was terminated a few months before Enron\nfiled for bankruptcy on December 2, 2001. During his\ntenure, petitioner played an active role in EBS’s attempt\nto develop a nationwide fiber-optic telecommunications\nsystem called the Enron Intelligent Network (EIN).\n2                   YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  In the summer of 1999, Enron announced that EBS\nwould become a “ ‘core’ ” Enron business and a major part\nof its overall strategy. App. 11. Thereafter, Enron issued\npress releases touting the advanced capabilities of EIN\nand claiming that the project was “ ‘lit,’ ” or operational.\nId., at 10. On January 20, 2000, at the company’s annual\nequity analyst conference, petitioner and others allegedly\nmade false and misleading statements about the value\nand performance of the EIN project. On January 21, 2000,\nthe price of Enron stock rose from $54 to $67. The next\nday it reached $72. At that point petitioner sold more\nthan 100,000 shares of Enron stock that he had received\nas part of his compensation. During the next several\nmonths petitioner sold an additional 600,000 shares. All\ntold, petitioner’s stock sales generated more than $54\nmillion in proceeds and $19 million in personal profit. As\nfor the EIN project, its value turned out to be illusory.\nThe “intelligent” network showcased to the public in the\npress releases and at the analyst conference was riddled\nwith technological problems and never fully developed.\n  On November 5, 2004, a grand jury returned a “Fifth\nSuperseding Indictment” charging petitioner with 126\ncounts of five federal offenses: (1) conspiracy to commit\nsecurities and wire fraud; (2) securities fraud; (3) wire\nfraud; (4) insider trading; and (5) money laundering.1 The\nGovernment’s theory of prosecution was that petitioner—\nacting in concert with other Enron executives—\npurposefully deceived the public about the EIN project in\norder to inflate the value of Enron’s stock and, ultimately,\nto enrich himself.2 Id., at 6.\n——————\n  1 See 18 U. S. C. §371 (conspiracy to commit fraud against the United\n\nStates); 15 U. S. C. §78j(b) (1994 ed.), §78ff (2000 ed.), and 17 CFR\n§240.10b–5 (2004) (securities fraud); 18 U. S. C. §1343 (2000 ed.) (wire\nfraud); 15 U. S. C. §78j(b) (1994 ed.), §78ff (2000 ed.), and 17 CFR\n§240.10b–5–1 (insider trading); 18 U. S. C. §1957 (money laundering).\n  2 While petitioner was charged with 126 counts, the indictment in\n                    Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                 3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   Count 1 of the indictment described in some detail the\nalleged conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire\nfraud and included as overt acts the substantive offenses\ncharged in counts 2 through 6. Count 2, the securities\nfraud count, alleged that petitioner made false and mis\nleading statements at the January 20, 2000, analyst con\nference or that he failed to state facts necessary to prevent\nstatements made by others from being misleading. Counts\n3 through 6 alleged that petitioner and others committed\nfour acts of wire fraud when they issued four EBS-related\npress releases in 2000. Counts 27 through 46, the insider\ntrading counts, alleged that petitioner made 20 separate\nsales of Enron stock “while in the possession of material\nnon-public information regarding the technological capa\nbilities, value, revenue and business performance of\n[EBS].” Id., at 31. And counts 67 through 165, the money\nlaundering counts, described 99 financial transactions\ninvolving petitioner’s use of the proceeds of his sales of\nEnron stock, which the indictment characterized as\n“criminally derived property.” Id., at 37. To simplify our\ndiscussion, we shall refer to counts 1 through 6 as the\n“fraud counts” and the remaining counts as the “insider\ntrading counts.”\n   The trial lasted 13 weeks. After four days of delibera\ntions, the jury notified the court that it had reached\nagreement on some counts but had deadlocked on others.\nThe judge then gave the jury an Allen charge, see Allen v.\nUnited States, 164 U. S. 492, 501–502 (1896), urging the\njurors to reexamine the grounds for their opinions and to\ncontinue deliberations “until the end of the day” to achieve\na final verdict on all counts. Tr. 13724 (July 20, 2005).\nWhen the jury failed to break the deadlock, the court told\nthe jurors that it would “take their verdict” instead of\n—————— \n\ncluded 176 counts in all, covering conduct by executives purportedly\n\ninvolved in the alleged fraud. \n\n4                   YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nprolonging deliberations. Id., at 13725. The jury acquit\nted petitioner on the fraud counts but failed to reach a\nverdict on the insider trading counts. The court entered\njudgment on the acquittals and declared a mistrial on the\nhung counts.\n   On November 9, 2005, the Government obtained a new\nindictment against petitioner. This “Eighth Superseding\nIndictment” recharged petitioner with some, but not all, of\nthe insider trading counts on which the jury had previ\nously hung. App. 188. The new indictment refined the\nGovernment’s case: Whereas the earlier indictment had\nnamed multiple defendants, the new indictment dealt\nexclusively with petitioner. And instead of alleging facts\nimplicating a broader fraudulent scheme, the new indict\nment focused on petitioner’s knowledge of the EIN project\nand his failure to disclose that information to the public\nbefore selling his Enron stock.\n   Petitioner moved to dismiss all counts in the new in\ndictment on the ground that the acquittals on the fraud\ncounts precluded the Government from retrying him on\nthe insider trading counts.3 He argued that the jury’s\nacquittals had necessarily decided that he did not possess\nmaterial, nonpublic information about the performance of\nthe EIN project and its value to Enron. In petitioner’s\nview, because reprosecution for insider trading would\nrequire the Government to prove that critical fact, the\nissue-preclusion component of the Double Jeopardy Clause\nbarred a second trial of that issue and mandated dismissal\nof all of the insider trading counts.\n   The District Court denied the motion. After reviewing\nthe trial record, the court disagreed with petitioner’s\n\n——————\n    3 Petitioner\n              had also moved to dismiss the relevant counts in the ear\nlier indictment in response to the Government’s assertion that it could\nreprosecute petitioner for the previously hung counts under that\nindictment as well. See 521 F. 3d 367, 370, n. 4 (CA5 2008).\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nreading of what the jury necessarily decided. In the\ncourt’s telling, the jury likely concluded that petitioner\n“did not knowingly and willfully participate in the scheme\nto defraud described in the conspiracy, securities fraud,\nand wire fraud counts.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2315583\"><a href=\"/opinion/2315583/united-states-v-yeager/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 735 (SD Tex.\n2006). The court therefore concluded that the question\nwhether petitioner possessed insider information was not\nnecessarily resolved in the first trial and could be litigated\nanew in a second prosecution.\n  The Court of Appeals disagreed with the District Court’s\nanalysis of the record, but nevertheless affirmed. It rea\nsoned that petitioner “did not dispute” the Government’s\ntheory that he “helped shape the message” of the allegedly\nfraudulent presentations made at the analyst conference,\nand therefore rejected the District Court’s conclusion that\nthe jury had “acquitted [petitioner] on the groun[d] that he\ndid not participate in the fraud.” 521 F. 3d 367, 377 (CA5\n2008). Based on its independent review of the record, the\nCourt of Appeals instead concluded that “the jury must\nhave found when it acquitted [petitioner] that [he] did not\nhave any insider information that contradicted what was\npresented to the public.” Id., at 378. The court acknowl\nedged that this factual determination would normally\npreclude the Government from retrying petitioner for\ninsider trading or money laundering.\n  The court was nevertheless persuaded that a truly\nrational jury, having concluded that petitioner did not\nhave any insider information, would have acquitted him\non the insider trading counts. That the jury failed to\nacquit, and instead hung on those counts, was pivotal in\nthe court’s issue-preclusion analysis. Considering “the\nhung counts along with the acquittals,” the court found it\nimpossible “to decide with any certainty what the jury\nnecessarily determined.” Ibid. Relying on Circuit prece\ndent, United States v. Larkin, 605 F. 2d 1360 (1979), the\ncourt concluded that the conflict between the acquittals\n6                YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nand the hung counts barred the application of issue pre\nclusion in this case. 521 F. 3d, at 378–379.\n   Several courts have taken the contrary view and have\nheld that a jury’s failure to reach a verdict on some counts\nshould play no role in determining the preclusive effect of\nan acquittal. See United States v. Ohayon, 483 F. 3d 1281\n(CA11 2007); United States v. Romeo, 114 F. 3d 141 (CA9\n1997); United States v. Bailin, 977 F. 2d 270 (CA7 1992);\nUnited States v. Frazier, 880 F. 2d 878 (CA6 1989). Oth\ners have sided with the Court of Appeals. See United\nStates v. Howe, 538 F. 3d 820 (CA8 2008); United States v.\nAguilar-Aranceta, 957 F. 2d 18 (CA1 1992); United States\nv. White, 936 F. 2d 1326 (CADC 1991). We granted certio\nrari to resolve the conflict, 555 U. S. ___ (2008), and now\nreverse.\n                              II\n  The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment\nprovides: “[N]or shall any person be subject for the same\noffence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.”\n  While we have decided an exceptionally large number of\ncases interpreting this provision, see, e.g., United States v.\nDiFrancesco, 449 U. S. 117, 126–127 (1980) (collecting\ncases), most of our decisions have found more guidance in\nthe common-law ancestry of the Clause than in its brief\ntext. Thus, for example, while the risk of being fined or\nimprisoned implicates neither “life” nor “limb,” our early\ncases held that double jeopardy protection extends to\npunishments that are not “positively covered by the lan\nguage of [the] amendment.” Ex parte Lange, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88804\"><a href=\"/opinion/88804/ex-parte-lange/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n170 (1874). As we explained, “[i]t is very clearly the spirit\nof the instrument to prevent a second punishment under\njudicial proceedings for the same crime, so far as the\ncommon law gave that protection.” Ibid.\n  Our cases have recognized that the Clause embodies two\nvitally important interests. The first is the “deeply in\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngrained” principle that “the State with all its resources\nand power should not be allowed to make repeated at\ntempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense,\nthereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and\nordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of\nanxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibil\nity that even though innocent he may be found guilty.”\nGreen v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 187–188 (1957); see\nBenton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784, 795–795 (1969); Di-\nFrancesco, 449 U. S., at 127–128. The second interest is\nthe preservation of “the finality of judgments.” Crist v.\nBretz, 437 U. S. 28, 33 (1978).\n   The first interest is implicated whenever the State seeks\na second trial after its first attempt to obtain a conviction\nresults in a mistrial because the jury has failed to reach a\nverdict. In these circumstances, however, while the de\nfendant has an interest in avoiding multiple trials, the\nClause does not prevent the Government from seeking to\nreprosecute. Despite the argument’s textual appeal, we\nhave held that the second trial does not place the defen\ndant in jeopardy “twice.” Richardson v. United States, 468\nU. S. 317, 323 (1984); see 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the\nConstitution §1781, pp. 659–660 (1833). Instead, a jury’s\ninability to reach a decision is the kind of “manifest neces\nsity” that permits the declaration of a mistrial and the\ncontinuation of the initial jeopardy that commenced when\nthe jury was first impaneled. See Arizona v. Washington,\n434 U. S. 497, 505–506 (1978); United States v. Perez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85440\"><a href=\"/opinion/85440/united-states-v-perez/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 580 (1824). The “interest in giving the prose\ncution one complete opportunity to convict those who have\nviolated its laws” justifies treating the jury’s inability to\nreach a verdict as a nonevent that does not bar retrial.\nWashington, 434 U. S., at 509.\n   While the case before us involves a mistrial on the\ninsider trading counts, the question presented cannot be\nresolved by asking whether the Government should be\n8                YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngiven one complete opportunity to convict petitioner on\nthose charges. Rather, the case turns on the second inter\nest at the core of the Clause. We must determine whether\nthe interest in preserving the finality of the jury’s judg\nment on the fraud counts, including the jury’s finding that\npetitioner did not possess insider information, bars a\nretrial on the insider trading counts. This requires us to\nlook beyond the Clause’s prohibition on being put in jeop\nardy “twice”; the jury’s acquittals unquestionably termi\nnated petitioner’s jeopardy with respect to the issues\nfinally decided in those counts. The proper question,\nunder the Clause’s text, is whether it is appropriate to\ntreat the insider trading charges as the “same offence” as\nthe fraud charges. Our opinion in Ashe v. Swenson, 397\nU. S. 436 (1970), provides the basis for our answer.\n   In Ashe, we squarely held that the Double Jeopardy\nClause precludes the Government from relitigating any\nissue that was necessarily decided by a jury’s acquittal in\na prior trial. In that case, six poker players were robbed\nby a group of masked men. Ashe was charged with—and\nacquitted of—robbing Donald Knight, one of the six play\ners. The State sought to retry Ashe for the robbery of\nanother poker player only weeks after the first jury had\nacquitted him. The second prosecution was successful:\nFacing “substantially stronger” testimony from “witnesses\n[who] were for the most part the same,” id., at 439–440,\nAshe was convicted and sentenced to a 35-year prison\nterm. We concluded that the subsequent prosecution was\nconstitutionally prohibited. Because the only contested\nissue at the first trial was whether Ashe was one of the\nrobbers, we held that the jury’s verdict of acquittal collat\nerally estopped the State from trying him for robbing a\ndifferent player during the same criminal episode. Id., at\n446. We explained that “when an issue of ultimate fact\nhas once been determined by a valid and final judgment”\nof acquittal, it “cannot again be litigated” in a second trial\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfor a separate offense. Id., at 443.4 To decipher what a\njury has necessarily decided, we held that courts should\n“examine the record of a prior proceeding, taking into\naccount the pleadings, evidence, charge, and other rele\nvant matter, and conclude whether a rational jury could\nhave grounded its verdict upon an issue other than that\nwhich the defendant seeks to foreclose from considera\ntion.” Id., at 444 (internal quotation marks omitted). We\nexplained that the inquiry “must be set in a practical\nframe and viewed with an eye to all the circumstances of\nthe proceedings.” Ibid. (quoting Sealfon v. United States,\n332 U. S. 575, 579 (1948) (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n   Unlike Ashe, the case before us today entails a trial that\nincluded multiple counts rather than a trial for a single\noffense. And, while Ashe involved an acquittal for that\nsingle offense, this case involves an acquittal on some\ncounts and a mistrial declared on others. The reasoning in\nAshe is nevertheless controlling because, for double jeop\nardy purposes, the jury’s inability to reach a verdict on the\ninsider trading counts was a nonevent and the acquittals\non the fraud counts are entitled to the same effect as\nAshe’s acquittal.\n   As noted above, see supra, at 4, the Court of Appeals\nreasoned that the hung counts must be considered to\ndetermine what issues the jury decided in the first trial.\nViewed in isolation, the court explained, the acquittals on\n——————\n   4 Although the doctrine of collateral estoppel had developed in civil\n\nlitigation, we had already extended it to criminal proceedings when\nAshe was decided. The justification for this application was first offered\nby Justice Holmes, who observed that “[i]t cannot be that the safe\nguards of the person, so often and so rightly mentioned with solemn\nreverence, are less than those that protect from a liability in debt.”\nUnited States v. Oppenheimer, 242 U. S. 85, 87 (1916). Currently, the\nmore descriptive term “issue preclusion” is often used in lieu of “collat\neral estoppel.” See Restatement (Second) of Judgments §27 (1980).\n10               YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe fraud charges would preclude retrial because they\nappeared to support petitioner’s argument that the jury\ndecided he lacked insider information. 521 F. 3d, at 378.\nViewed alongside the hung counts, however, the acquittals\nappeared less decisive. The problem, as the court saw it,\nwas that, if “the jury found that [petitioner] did not have\ninsider information, then the jury, acting rationally, would\nalso have acquitted [him] of the insider trading counts.”\nIbid. The fact that the jury hung was a logical wrinkle\nthat made it impossible for the court “to decide with any\ncertainty what the jury necessarily determined.” Ibid.\nBecause petitioner failed to show what the jury decided,\nid., at 380, the court refused to find the Government\nprecluded from pursuing the hung counts in a new\nprosecution.\n   The Court of Appeals’ issue-preclusion analysis was in\nerror. A hung count is not a “relevant” part of the “record\nof [the] prior proceeding.” See Ashe, 397 U. S., at 444\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Because a jury speaks\nonly through its verdict, its failure to reach a verdict\ncannot—by negative implication—yield a piece of informa\ntion that helps put together the trial puzzle. A mistried\ncount is therefore nothing like the other forms of record\nmaterial that Ashe suggested should be part of the preclu\nsion inquiry. Ibid.; see also Black’s Law Dictionary 1301\n(8th ed. 2004) (defining “record” as the “official report of\nthe proceedings in a case, including the filed papers, ver\nbatim transcript of the trial or hearing (if any), and tangi\nble exhibits”). Unlike the pleadings, the jury charge, or\nthe evidence introduced by the parties, there is no way to\ndecipher what a hung count represents. Even in the usual\nsense of “relevance,” a hung count hardly “make[s] the\nexistence of any fact . . . more probable or less probable.”\nFed. Rule Evid. 401. A host of reasons—sharp disagree\nment, confusion about the issues, exhaustion after a long\ntrial, to name but a few—could work alone or in tandem to\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncause a jury to hang.5 To ascribe meaning to a hung count\nwould presume an ability to identify which factor was at\nplay in the jury room. But that is not reasoned analysis; it\nis guesswork.6 Such conjecture about possible reasons for\na jury’s failure to reach a decision should play no part in\nassessing the legal consequences of a unanimous verdict\nthat the jurors did return.\n   A contrary conclusion would require speculation into\nwhat transpired in the jury room. Courts properly avoid\nsuch explorations into the jury’s sovereign space, see\nUnited States v. Powell, 469 U. S. 57, 66 (1984); Fed. Rule\nEvid. 606(b), and for good reason. The jury’s deliberations\nare secret and not subject to outside examination. If there\nis to be an inquiry into what the jury decided, the “evi\ndence should be confined to the points in controversy on\nthe former trial, to the testimony given by the parties, and\nto the questions submitted to the jury for their considera\ntion.” Packet Co. v. Sickles, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 593 (1866); see\nalso Vaise v. Delaval, 99 Eng. Rep. 944 (K. B. 1785) (Lord\nMansfield, C. J.) (refusing to rely on juror affidavits to\nimpeach a verdict reached by a coin flip); J. Wigmore,\nEvidence §2349, pp. 681–690, and n. 2 (McNaughton rev.\ned. 1961 and Supp. 1991).\n   Accordingly, we hold that the consideration of hung\ncounts has no place in the issue-preclusion analysis.\n——————\n  5 Indeed, there were many indications that the jury in this case could\n\nhave been exhausted after the 13-week trial. See Reply Brief for\nPetitioner 9–10 (cataloging numerous “statements on the record [that]\nreveal the very real possibility that the jurors cut their deliberations\nshort out of exhaustion”).\n  6 It would also require too much of the defendant. To preclude retrial,\n\nhe must show that the jury necessarily decided an issue in his favor.\nYet, to borrow from the Court of Appeals, “[b]ecause it is impossible to\ndetermine why [a] jury hung,” 521 F. 3d, at 379, the defendant will\nhave to rebut all inferences about what may have motivated the jury to\nhang without the ability to seek conclusive proof. See Fed. Rule Evid.\n606(b). There is no reason to impose such a burden on a defendant.\n12                YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nIndeed, if it were relevant, the fact that petitioner has\nalready survived one trial should be a factor cutting in\nfavor of, rather than against, applying a double jeopardy\nbar. To identify what a jury necessarily determined at\ntrial, courts should scrutinize a jury’s decisions, not its\nfailures to decide. A jury’s verdict of acquittal represents\nthe community’s collective judgment regarding all the\nevidence and arguments presented to it. Even if the ver\ndict is “based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation,”\nFong Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141, 143 (1962) (per\ncuriam), its finality is unassailable. See, e.g., Washington,\n434 U. S., at 503; Sanabria v. United States, 437 U. S. 54,\n64 (1978). Thus, if the possession of insider information\nwas a critical issue of ultimate fact in all of the charges\nagainst petitioner, a jury verdict that necessarily decided\nthat issue in his favor protects him from prosecution for\nany charge for which that is an essential element.\n                             III\n    The Government relies heavily on two of our cases,\nRichardson v. United States, 468 U. S. 317, and United\nStates v. Powell, 469 U. S. 57, to argue that it is entitled to\nretry petitioner on the insider trading counts. Neither\nprecedent can bear the weight the Government places on\nit.\n    In Richardson, the defendant was indicted on three\ncounts of narcotics violations. The jury acquitted him on\none count but hung on the others. Richardson moved to\nbar retrial on the hung counts, insisting that reprosecu\ntion would place him twice in jeopardy for the same of\nfense. Unlike petitioner in this case, Richardson did not\nargue that retrial was barred because the jury’s verdict of\nacquittal meant that it necessarily decided an essential\nfact in his favor. He simply asserted that the hung counts,\nstanding alone, shielded him from reprosecution. We\ndisagreed and held that “the protection of the Double\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nJeopardy Clause by its terms applies only if there has\nbeen some event, such as an acquittal, which terminates\nthe original jeopardy.” 468 U. S., at 325. “[T]he failure of\nthe jury to reach a verdict,” we explained, “is not an event\nwhich terminates jeopardy.” Ibid. From this the Govern\nment extrapolates the altogether different principle that\nretrial is always permitted whenever a jury convicts on\nsome counts and hangs on others. Brief for United States\n23–24. But Richardson was not so broad. Rather, our\nconclusion was a rejection of the argument—similar to the\none the Government urges today—that a mistrial is an\nevent of significance. In so holding, we did not open the\ndoor to using a mistried count to ignore the preclusive\neffect of a jury’s acquittal.\n   The Government next contends that an acquittal can\nnever preclude retrial on a mistried count because it\nwould impute irrationality to the jury in violation of the\nrule articulated in Powell, 469 U. S. 57. In Powell, the\ndefendant was charged with various drug offenses. The\njury acquitted Powell of the substantive drug charges but\nconvicted her of using a telephone in “ ‘committing and in\ncausing and facilitating’ ” those same offenses. Id., at 59–\n60. Powell attacked the verdicts on appeal as irrationally\ninconsistent and urged the reversal of her convictions.\nShe insisted that “collateral estoppel should apply to\nverdicts rendered by a single jury, to preclude acceptance\nof a guilty verdict on a telephone facilitation count where\nthe jury acquits the defendant of the predicate felony.”\nId., at 64. We rejected this argument, reasoning that\nissue preclusion is “predicated on the assumption that the\njury acted rationally.” Id., at 68.\n   Arguing that a jury that acquits on some counts while\ninexplicably hanging on others is not rational, the Gov\nernment contends that issue preclusion is as inappropriate\nin this case as it was in Powell. There are two serious\nflaws in this line of reasoning. First, it takes Powell’s\n14                YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntreatment of inconsistent verdicts and imports it into an\nentirely different context involving both verdicts and\nseemingly inconsistent hung counts. But the situations\nare quite dissimilar. In Powell, respect for the jury’s\nverdicts counseled giving each verdict full effect, however\ninconsistent. As we explained, the jury’s verdict “brings to\nthe criminal process, in addition to the collective judgment\nof the community, an element of needed finality.” Id., at\n67. By comparison, hung counts have never been accorded\nrespect as a matter of law or history, and are not similar\nto jury verdicts in any relevant sense. By equating them,\nthe Government’s argument fails. Second, the Govern\nment’s reliance on Powell assumes that a mistried count\ncan, in context, be evidence of irrationality. But, as we\nexplained above, see supra, at 7–8, the fact that a jury\nhangs is evidence of nothing—other than, of course, that it\nhas failed to decide anything. By relying on hung counts\nto question the basis of the jury’s verdicts, the Govern\nment violates the very assumption of rationality it invokes\nfor support.\n  At bottom, the Government misreads our cases that\nhave rejected attempts to question the validity of a jury’s\nverdict. In Powell and, before that, in Dunn, 284 U. S.\n390, we were faced with jury verdicts that, on their face,\nwere logically inconsistent and yet we refused to impugn\nthe legitimacy of either verdict. In this case, there is\nmerely a suggestion that the jury may have acted irration\nally. And instead of resting that suggestion on a verdict,\nthe Government relies on a hung count, the thinnest reed\nof all. If the Court in Powell and Dunn declined to use a\nclearly inconsistent verdict to second-guess the soundness\nof another verdict, then, a fortiori, a potentially inconsis\ntent hung count could not command a different result.\n                              IV\n     One final matter requires discussion. The Government\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nargues that even if we conclude (as we do) that acquittals\ncan preclude retrial on counts on which the same jury\nhangs, we should nevertheless affirm the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals because petitioner failed to show that the\njury necessarily resolved in his favor an issue of ultimate\nfact that the Government must prove in order to convict\nhim of insider trading and money laundering. See Brief\nfor United States 41–45. Given the length and complexity\nof the proceedings, this factual dispute is understandable.\nThe District Court and Court of Appeals each read the\nrecord differently, disagreeing as to what the jury neces\nsarily decided in its acquittals. Compare 446 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 735 (“[T]he jury necessarily determined that Defendant\nYeager did not knowingly and willfully participate or\nagree to participate in a scheme to defraud in connection\nwith the alleged false statements or material omissions\nmade at the analyst conference and press releases”), with\n521 F. 3d, at 378 (“[T]he jury must have found when it\nacquitted Yeager that Yeager himself did not have any\ninsider information that contradicted what was presented\nto the public”). Our grant of certiorari was based on the\nassumption that the Court of Appeals’ interpretation of\nthe record was correct. We recognize the Government’s\nright, as the prevailing party in the Court of Appeals, to\n“defend its judgment on any ground properly raised below\nwhether or not that ground was relied upon, rejected, or\neven considered by the District Court or the Court of\nAppeals.” Washington v. Confederated Bands and Tribes\nof Yakima Nation, 439 U. S. 463, 476, n. 20 (1979). But\nwe decline to engage in a fact-intensive analysis of the\nvoluminous record, an undertaking unnecessary to the\nresolution of the narrow legal question we granted certio\nrari to answer. If it chooses, the Court of Appeals may\nrevisit its factual analysis in light of the Government’s\narguments before this Court.\n16              YEAGER v.

It is insufficient for the Court to say that, on\nremand, the Court of Appeals “may,” “[i]f it chooses,”\n“revisit its factual analysis.” Ante, at 15. The correct\ncourse would be to require the Court of Appeals to do so.\n   As JUSTICE ALITO explains, the judgments of acquittal\npreclude the Government from retrying petitioner on the\nissue of his possession of insider information if, and only\nif, “it would have been irrational for the jury to acquit\nwithout finding that fact.” Post, at 1; see Ashe v. Swenson,\n397 U.

Post, at 2. The District Court,\nwhich was the court most familiar with the record, found\nthat petitioner could not make this showing because a\nrational jury could have acquitted him of securities fraud\non a different basis—namely, that petitioner did not cause\nthe misleading statements to be made.

The Court today corrects that misreading\nof the Double Jeopardy Clause.

SCOTT YEAGER, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [June 18, 2009] \n\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS and\nJUSTICE ALITO join, dissenting.\n  The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment\nprovides that no person shall “be subject for the same\noffence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” The\nCourt today holds that this proscription, as interpreted in\nAshe v. Swenson, 397 U. S. 436 (1970), sometimes bars\nretrial of hung counts if the jury acquits on factually re\nlated counts. Because that result neither accords with the\noriginal meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause nor is\nrequired by the Court’s precedents, I dissent.\n                             I\n  Today’s opinion begins with the proclamation that this\nCourt has “found more guidance in the common-law ances\ntry of the [Double Jeopardy] Clause than its brief text.”\nAnte, at 6. Would that it were so. This case would be easy\nindeed if our cases had adhered to the Clause’s original\nmeaning. The English common-law pleas of auterfoits\nacquit and auterfoits convict, on which the Clause was\nbased, barred only repeated “prosecution for the same\nidentical act and crime.” 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries\non the Laws of England 330 (1769) (emphasis added). See\nalso Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508, 530–535 (1990)\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting). As described by Sir Matthew\nHale, “a man acquitted for stealing [a] horse” could be\n2                   YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nlater “arraigned and convict[ed] for stealing the saddle,\ntho both were done at the same time.” 2 Pleas of the\nCrown 246 (1736). Under the common-law pleas, the\njury’s acquittal of Yeager on the fraud counts would have\nposed no bar to further prosecution for the distinct crimes\nof insider trading and money laundering.\n   But that is water over the dam. In Ashe the Court\ndeparted from the original meaning of the Double Jeop\nardy Clause, holding that it precludes successive prosecu\ntions on distinct crimes when facts essential to conviction\nof the second crime have necessarily been resolved in the\ndefendant’s favor by a verdict of acquittal of the first\ncrime. 397 U. S., at 445–446.1 Even if I am to adhere to\nAshe on stare decisis grounds, cf. Grady, supra, at 528\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting), today’s holding is an illogical\nextension of that case. Ashe held only that the Clause\nsometimes bars successive prosecution of facts found\nduring “a prior proceeding.” 397 U. S., at 444. But today\nthe Court bars retrial on hung counts after what was not,\nunder this Court’s theory of “continuing jeopardy,” Jus\ntices of Boston Municipal Court v. Lydon, 466 U. S. 294,\n308 (1984), a prior proceeding but simply an earlier stage\nof the same proceeding.\n   As an historical matter, the common-law pleas could be\ninvoked only once “there ha[d] been a conviction or an\nacquittal—after a complete trial.” Crist v. Bretz, 437 U. S.\n——————\n    1 Because this case arises in federal court, the federal doctrine of\nissue preclusion might have prevented the Government from retrying\nYeager even without Ashe’s innovation. See United States v. Oppen\nheimer, 242 U. S. 85, 87 (1916). But the District Court held that the\njury in this case had not necessarily decided that Yeager lacked inside\ninformation (the fact that Yeager claims the Government is barred from\nrelitigating), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2315583\"><a href=\"/opinion/2315583/united-states-v-yeager/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

This Court has extended the protections of\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause by holding that jeopardy\nattaches earlier: at the time a jury is empanelled and\nsworn. Id., at 38. Although one might think that this\nearly attachment would mean that any second trial with a\nnew jury would constitute a second jeopardy, the Court\namended its innovation by holding that discharge of a\ndeadlocked jury does not “terminat[e] the original jeop\nardy,” Richardson v. United States, 468 U. S. 317, 325\n(1984). Under this continuing-jeopardy principle, retrial\nafter a jury has failed to reach a verdict is not a new trial\nbut part of the same proceeding.2\n  Today’s holding is inconsistent with this principle. It\ninterprets the Double Jeopardy Clause, for the first time,\nto have effect internally within a single prosecution, even\nthough the “ ‘criminal proceedings against [the] accused\nhave not run their full course.’ ” Lydon, supra, at 308\n(quoting Price v. Georgia, 398 U. S. 323, 326 (1970)). As a\nconceptual matter, it makes no sense to say that events\noccurring within a single prosecution can cause an accused\nto be “twice put in jeopardy.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. And\nour cases, until today, have acknowledged that. Ever\nsince Dunn v. United States, 284 U. S. 390, 393 (1932), we\nhave refused to set aside convictions that were inconsis\ntent with acquittals in the same trial; and we made clear\n——————\n  2 That the Government issued a new indictment after the mistrial in\n\nthis case does not alter the fact that, for double jeopardy purposes,\nretrial would have been part of the same, initial proceeding. As a\nmatter of practice, it seems that prosecutors and courts treat retrials\nafter mistrials as part of the same proceeding by filing superseding\nindictments under the original docket number. See, e.g., Superseding\nInformation in United States v. Pena, Case No. 8:03–cr–476–T–23EAJ\n(MD Fla., Feb. 17, 2005). The Court implies that the new indictment in\nthis case materially refined the charges, ante, at 4, but the only rele\nvant changes were dropping of the other defendants and elimination of\na few counts and related factual allegations. Compare App. 6–71 with\nApp. 188–200.\n4                 YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nin United States v. Powell, 469 U. S. 57, 64–65 (1984), that\nAshe does not mandate a different result. There is no\nreason to treat perceived inconsistencies between hung\ncounts and acquittals any differently.\n   Richardson accentuates the point. Under our cases, if\nan appellate court reverses a conviction for lack of consti\ntutionally sufficient evidence, that determination consti\ntutes an acquittal which, under the Double Jeopardy\nClause, precludes further prosecution. Burks v. United\nStates, 437 U. S. 1, 11 (1978). In Richardson, the defen\ndant sought to prevent retrial after a jury failed to reach a\nverdict, claiming that the case should not have gone to the\njury because the Government failed to present sufficient\nevidence. 468 U. S., at 322–323. The Court held that the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause was inapplicable because there\nhad not been an “event, such as an acquittal, which termi\nnate[d] the original jeopardy.” Id., at 325. I do not see\nwhy the Double Jeopardy Clause effect of a jury acquittal\non a different count should be any different from the Dou\nble Jeopardy Clause effect of the prosecution’s failure to\npresent a case sufficient to go to the jury on the same\ncount. In both cases, the predicate necessary for Double\nJeopardy Clause preclusion of a new prosecution exists: in\nthe former, the factual findings implicit in the jury’s ver\ndict of acquittal, in the latter, the State’s presentation of a\ncase so weak that it would have demanded a jury verdict\nof acquittal. In both cases, it seems to me, the Double\nJeopardy Clause cannot be invoked because the jeopardy\nwith respect to the retried count has not terminated.\n   The acquittals here did not, as the majority argues,\n“unquestionably terminat[e] [Yeager’s] jeopardy with\nrespect to the issues finally decided” in those counts. Ante,\nat 8 (emphasis added). Jeopardy is commenced and ter\nminated charge by charge, not issue by issue. And if the\nprosecution’s failure to present sufficient evidence at a\nfirst trial cannot prevent retrial on a hung count because\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)             5\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe retrial is considered part of the same proceeding, then\nthere is no basis for invoking Ashe to prevent retrial in the\npresent case. If a conviction can stand with a contradic\ntory acquittal when both are pronounced at the same trial,\nthere is no reason why an acquittal should prevent the\nState from pressing for a contradictory conviction in the\ncontinuation of the prosecution on the hung counts.\n                              II\n   The Court’s extension of Ashe to these circumstances\ncannot even be justified based on the rationales underly\ning that holding. Invoking issue preclusion to bar seriatim\nprosecutions has the salutary effect of preventing the\nGovernment from circumventing acquittals by forcing\ndefendants “to ‘run the gantlet’ a second time” on effec\ntively the same charges. 397 U. S., at 446. In cases where\nthe prosecution merely seeks to get “one full and fair\nopportunity to convict” on all charges brought in an initial\nindictment, Ohio v. Johnson, 467 U. S. 493, 502 (1984),\nthere is no risk of such gamesmanship. We have said that\n“where the State has made no effort to prosecute the\ncharges seriatim, the considerations of double jeopardy\nprotection implicit in the application of collateral estoppel\nare inapplicable.” Id., at 500, n. 9.\n   Moreover, barring retrial when a jury acquits on some\ncounts and hangs on others bears only a tenuous relation\nship to preserving the finality of “an issue of ultimate fact\n[actually] determined by a valid and final judgment.”\nAshe, supra, at 443. There is no clear, unanimous jury\nfinding here. In the unusual situation in which a factual\nfinding upon which an acquittal must have been based\nwould also logically require an acquittal on the hung\ncount, all that can be said for certain is that the conflicting\ndispositions are irrational—the result of “mistake, com\npromise, or lenity.” Powell, 469 U. S., at 65. It is at least\nas likely that the irrationality consisted of failing to make\n6                   YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe factual finding necessary to support the acquittal as it\nis that the irrationality consisted of failing to adhere to\nthat factual finding with respect to the hung count. While\nI agree that courts should avoid speculation as to why a\njury reached a particular result, ante, at 11, the Court’s\nopinion steps in the wrong direction by pretending that\nthe acquittals here mean something that they in all prob\nability do not.3 Powell, supra, at 69, concluded that “the\nbest course to take is simply to insulate jury verdicts” from\nreview on grounds of inconsistency. In my view the same\nconclusion applies to claims that inconsistency will arise\nfrom proceeding to conviction on hung counts.\n   The burdens created by the Court’s opinion today are\nlikely to be substantial. The Ashe inquiry will require\ncourts to “examine the record of a prior proceeding, taking\ninto account the pleadings, evidence, charge, and other\nrelevant matter, and conclude whether a rational jury\ncould have grounded its verdict upon an issue other than\nthat which the defendant seeks to foreclose from consid\neration.” 397 U. S., at 446 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). What is more, our holding in Abney v. United\nStates, 431 U. S. 651 (1977), ensures that every defendant\nin Yeager’s shoes will be entitled to an immediate inter\nlocutory appeal (and petition for certiorari) whenever his\nAshe claim is rejected by the trial court. Abney, supra, at\n662.\n                         *    *     *\n   Until today, this Court has consistently held that retrial\nafter a jury has been unable to reach a verdict is part of\nthe original prosecution and that there can be no second\n——————\n  3 The Court claims that a jury’s failure to reach a verdict is not rele\n\nvant evidence, ante, at 10, but its justifications for that statement are\nutterly unpersuasive.

SCOTT YEAGER, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n                        [June 18, 2009]\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA and JUSTICE\nTHOMAS join, dissenting.\n  I join JUSTICE SCALIA’s dissenting opinion. When a jury\nacquits on some counts but cannot reach agreement on\nothers, I do not think that the Double Jeopardy Clause\nprecludes retrial on the “hung” counts.\n  As a result of today’s decision, however, the law is now\nto the contrary, and I write separately to note that the\nCourt’s holding makes it imperative that the doctrine of\nissue preclusion be applied with the rigor prescribed in\nAshe v. Swenson, 397 U. S. 436 (1970). Loose application\nof the doctrine will lead to exceedingly complicated and\nprotracted litigation, both in the trial court and on appeal,\nand may produce unjust results.\n  Ashe made it clear that an acquittal on one charge\nprecludes a subsequent trial on a different charge only if\n“a rational jury” could not have acquitted on the first\ncharge without finding in the defendant’s favor on a fac\ntual issue that the prosecution would have to prove in\norder to convict in the later trial. Id., at 444. This is a\ndemanding standard. The second trial is not precluded\nsimply because it is unlikely—or even very unlikely—that\nthe original jury acquitted without finding the fact in\nquestion. Only if it would have been irrational for the jury\nto acquit without finding that fact is the subsequent trial\nbarred. And the defendant has the burden of showing that\n2                YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n“the issue whose relitigation he seeks to foreclose was\nactually decided in the first proceeding.” Dowling v.\nUnited States, 493 U. S. 342, 350 (1990).\n   The situation presented in a case like the one now be\nfore us—where the jury acquits on some counts but cannot\nreach a verdict on others—calls for special care in the\napplication of the Ashe standard. In such a situation, the\nconclusion that the not-guilty verdicts preclude retrial on\nthe hung counts necessarily means that the jury did not\nact rationally. But courts should begin with the presump\ntion that a jury’s actions can rationally be reconciled. In\nan analogous situation—where it is claimed that a verdict\nmust be set aside on the ground that the findings set out\nin a jury’s answers to special interrogatories are inconsis\ntent—“it is the duty of the courts to attempt to harmonize\nthe answers, if it is possible under a fair reading of them:\n‘Where there is a view of the case that makes the jury’s\nanswers to special interrogatories consistent, they must be\nresolved that way.’ ” Gallick v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co.,\n372 U. S. 108, 119 (1963) (quoting Atlantic & Gulf Steve\ndores, Inc. v. Ellerman Lines, Ltd., 369 U. S. 355, 364\n(1962)). A similar approach is appropriate here.\n   In the present case, there is reason to question whether\nthe Ashe standard was met. It is clear that the fraud\ncounts required proof of an element not necessary for\nconviction on the insider trading charge, namely, that\npetitioner “caused” material misstatements or omissions\nto be made at the January 20, 2000, analyst conference\nand in the press releases that formed the basis for the\nwire fraud counts. See App. 107 (jury instruction on count\ntwo (securities fraud)), 118 (jury instruction on counts\nthree through six (wire fraud)). And it is far from appar\nent that the jury’s not-guilty verdict on the fraud counts\ncould not have rationally been based on a determination\nthat this element—that petitioner caused the material\nmisstatements or omissions—was not proved beyond a\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nreasonable doubt.\n  The District Court Judge, who was of course familiar\nwith the trial evidence, analyzed this issue as follows:\n    “The theory of the defense, evident in closing argu\n    ment and the direct testimony of Defendant Yeager,\n    argued that Defendant Yeager did not participate in\n    the crafting of the statements in the press releases;\n    did not participate in the creation of slides or state\n    ments presented at the analysts conference; and did\n    not reach an agreement with any other person to\n    make false, misleading, or deceptive statements or\n    material omissions of fact.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 55a.\n   The record provides support for the District Court’s\nanalysis. In his summation, petitioner’s attorney argued\nthat “Scott Yeager had nothing to do with Counts 3 to 6\n[the securities and wire fraud counts].” 80 Tr. 13384.\nWith respect to the January 20, 2000, conference that\nprovided the basis for the securities fraud count, peti\ntioner’s attorney emphasized that his client “didn’t say\nanything.” Id., at 13365. Counsel reiterated that peti\ntioner “didn’t make a presentation. He didn’t make a\nstatement.” Ibid.; id., at 13394. Counsel’s summation on\nthis point summarized portions of petitioner’s trial testi\nmony in which he minimized his involvement in matters\nrelating to the conference. See 52 id., at 9932–9933,\n9938–9947, and 9953.\n   With respect to the press releases on which the wire\nfraud counts were based, petitioner’s attorney argued:\n“Scott Yeager had nothing to do with the press releases.”\n80 id., at 13384. “We didn’t make any press releases.” Id.,\nat 13394. “Show me the evidence. Show me where Scott\nparticipated in a press release.” Id., at 13406. Again,\ncounsel’s comments in summation tracked petitioner’s\ntestimony denying participation in the press releases. See\n52 id., at 9911, 9913; 80 id., at 13384.\n4                YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   The above portions of the record suggest that a rational\njury might have found that petitioner did not “cause” the\nmisstatements or omissions at the conference or in the\npress releases. In light of the length and complexity of the\ntrial record, I am not in a position to say with certainty\nthat the Ashe standard was not met in this case, but the\nbrief discussion of this question in the opinion of the Court\nof Appeals does not satisfactorily show that the District\nCourt’s analysis was incorrect. Concluding that the not\nguilty verdict on the securities fraud count could not have\nbeen based on a finding that respondent did not cause the\nmisstatements or omissions at the conference, the Court of\nAppeals stated that petitioner “did not dispute” that he\n“helped shape the message of the conference presenta\ntions.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a. But there is surely\ntension between that statement and the previously men\ntioned portions of petitioner’s trial testimony and the\ndefense summation.\n   Because the Court of Appeals held that Ashe does not\napply when a jury acquits on some counts and hangs on\nothers, that court’s analysis of the possible grounds for the\njury’s securities fraud verdict was not necessary to support\nthe court’s decision. Now that this Court has held that\nAshe does govern in this context, a reexamination of\nthe possible grounds for the fraud count acquittals is\nwarranted.\n</pre>", "id": 145859, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2009/06/18/Yeager_v._United_States.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2008                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 08–67. Argued March 23, 2009—Decided June 18, 2009\nA federal indictment charged petitioner Yeager with securities and wire\n  fraud for allegedly misleading the public about the virtues of a fiber\n  optic telecommunications system offered by his employer, a subsidi\n  ary of Enron Corp., and with insider trading for selling his Enron\n  stock while in possession of material, nonpublic information about\n  the new system’s performance and value to Enron. The indictment\n  also charged petitioner with money laundering for conducting various\n  transactions with the proceeds of his stock sales. The jury acquitted\n  Yeager on the fraud counts but failed to reach a verdict on the in\n  sider-trading and money-laundering counts. After the Government\n  recharged him with some of the insider-trading and money\n  laundering counts, Yeager moved to dismiss the charges on the\n  ground that the jury, by acquitting him on the fraud counts, had nec\n  essarily decided that he did not possess material, nonpublic informa\n  tion about the project’s performance and value, and that the issue\n  preclusion component of the Double Jeopardy Clause therefore\n  barred a second trial for insider trading and money laundering. The\n  District Court denied the motion, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, rea\n  soning that the fact that the jury hung on the insider-trading and\n  money-laundering counts—as opposed to acquitting petitioner—cast\n  doubt on whether it had necessarily decided that petitioner did not\n  possess material, nonpublic information. This inconsistency between\n  the acquittals and the hung counts, the Fifth Circuit concluded,\n  meant that the Government could prosecute petitioner anew for in\n  sider trading and money laundering.\nHeld: An apparent inconsistency between a jury’s verdict of acquittal on\n some counts and its failure to return a verdict on other counts does\n not affect the acquittals’ preclusive force under the Double Jeopardy\n2                      YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    Clause. Pp. 6–15.\n       (a) This case is controlled by the reasoning in Ashe v. Swenson, 397\n    U. S. 436, where the Court squarely held that the Double Jeopardy\n    Clause precludes the Government from relitigating any issue that\n    was necessarily decided by a jury’s acquittal in a prior trial. For\n    double jeopardy purposes, the jury’s inability to reach a verdict on\n    Yeager’s insider-trading and money-laundering counts was a non\n    event that should be given no weight in the issue-preclusion analysis.\n    To identify what a jury necessarily determined at trial, courts should\n    scrutinize the jury’s decisions, not its failures to decide. A jury’s ver\n    dict of acquittal represents the community’s collective judgment re\n    garding all the evidence and arguments presented to it. Even if the\n    verdict is “based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation,” Fong\n    Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141, 143, its finality is unassailable,\n    see, e.g., Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497, 503. Thus, if the pos\n    session of insider information was a critical issue of ultimate fact in\n    all of the charges against Yeager, a jury verdict that necessarily de\n    cided that issue in his favor protects him from prosecution for any\n    charge for which that is an essential element. Pp. 6–12.\n       (b) Neither Richardson v. United States, 468 U. S. 317, nor United\n    States v. Powell, 469 U. S. 57, supports the Government’s argument\n    that it can retry Yeager for insider trading or money laundering.\n    Richardson’s conclusion that a jury’s “failure . . . to reach a verdict is\n    not an event which terminates jeopardy,” 468 U. S., at 325, did not\n    open the door to using a hung count to ignore the preclusive effect of\n    a jury’s acquittal, but was simply a rejection of the argument—\n    similar to the Government’s today—that a mistrial is an event of sig\n    nificance. Also rejected is the contention that an acquittal can never\n    preclude retrial on a hung count because it would impute irrational\n    ity to the jury in violation of Powell’s rule that issue preclusion is\n    “predicated on the assumption that the jury acted rationally,” 469\n    U. S., at 68. The Court’s refusal in Powell and in Dunn v. United\n    States, 284 U. S. 390, to impugn the legitimacy of jury verdicts that,\n    on their face, were logically inconsistent shows, a fortiori, that a po\n    tentially inconsistent hung count could not command a different re\n    sult. Pp. 12–14.\n       (c) The Government has argued that, even if hung counts cannot\n    enter the issue-preclusion analysis, Yeager has failed to show that\n    the jury’s acquittals necessarily resolved in his favor an issue of ulti\n    mate fact that must be proved to convict him of insider trading and\n    money laundering. Having granted certiorari on the assumption that\n    the Fifth Circuit ruled correctly that the acquittals meant the jury\n    found that Yeager did not have insider information that contradicted\n    what was presented to the public, this Court declines to engage in a\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

SCOTT YEAGER, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n                                 [June 18, 2009]\n\n  JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  In Dunn v. United States, 284 U. S. 390, 393 (1932), the\nCourt, speaking through Justice Holmes, held that a\nlogical inconsistency between a guilty verdict and a verdict\nof acquittal does not impugn the validity of either verdict.\nThe question presented in this case is whether an appar\nent inconsistency between a jury’s verdict of acquittal on\nsome counts and its failure to return a verdict on other\ncounts affects the preclusive force of the acquittals under\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. We\nhold that it does not.\n                            I\n   In 1997, Enron Corporation (Enron) acquired a tele\ncommunications business that it expanded and ultimately\nrenamed Enron Broadband Services (EBS). Petitioner F.\nScott Yeager served as Senior Vice President of Strategic\nDevelopment for EBS from October 1, 1998, until his\nemployment was terminated a few months before Enron\nfiled for bankruptcy on December 2, 2001. During his\ntenure, petitioner played an active role in EBS’s attempt\nto develop a nationwide fiber-optic telecommunications\nsystem called the Enron Intelligent Network (EIN).\n2                   YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  In the summer of 1999, Enron announced that EBS\nwould become a “ ‘core’ ” Enron business and a major part\nof its overall strategy. App. 11. Thereafter, Enron issued\npress releases touting the advanced capabilities of EIN\nand claiming that the project was “ ‘lit,’ ” or operational.\nId., at 10. On January 20, 2000, at the company’s annual\nequity analyst conference, petitioner and others allegedly\nmade false and misleading statements about the value\nand performance of the EIN project. On January 21, 2000,\nthe price of Enron stock rose from $54 to $67. The next\nday it reached $72. At that point petitioner sold more\nthan 100,000 shares of Enron stock that he had received\nas part of his compensation. During the next several\nmonths petitioner sold an additional 600,000 shares. All\ntold, petitioner’s stock sales generated more than $54\nmillion in proceeds and $19 million in personal profit. As\nfor the EIN project, its value turned out to be illusory.\nThe “intelligent” network showcased to the public in the\npress releases and at the analyst conference was riddled\nwith technological problems and never fully developed.\n  On November 5, 2004, a grand jury returned a “Fifth\nSuperseding Indictment” charging petitioner with 126\ncounts of five federal offenses: (1) conspiracy to commit\nsecurities and wire fraud; (2) securities fraud; (3) wire\nfraud; (4) insider trading; and (5) money laundering.1 The\nGovernment’s theory of prosecution was that petitioner—\nacting in concert with other Enron executives—\npurposefully deceived the public about the EIN project in\norder to inflate the value of Enron’s stock and, ultimately,\nto enrich himself.2 Id., at 6.\n——————\n  1 See 18 U.

Count 2, the securities\nfraud count, alleged that petitioner made false and mis\nleading statements at the January 20, 2000, analyst con\nference or that he failed to state facts necessary to prevent\nstatements made by others from being misleading. Counts\n3 through 6 alleged that petitioner and others committed\nfour acts of wire fraud when they issued four EBS-related\npress releases in 2000. Counts 27 through 46, the insider\ntrading counts, alleged that petitioner made 20 separate\nsales of Enron stock “while in the possession of material\nnon-public information regarding the technological capa\nbilities, value, revenue and business performance of\n[EBS].” Id., at 31. And counts 67 through 165, the money\nlaundering counts, described 99 financial transactions\ninvolving petitioner’s use of the proceeds of his sales of\nEnron stock, which the indictment characterized as\n“criminally derived property.” Id., at 37. To simplify our\ndiscussion, we shall refer to counts 1 through 6 as the\n“fraud counts” and the remaining counts as the “insider\ntrading counts.”\n   The trial lasted 13 weeks. After four days of delibera\ntions, the jury notified the court that it had reached\nagreement on some counts but had deadlocked on others.\nThe judge then gave the jury an Allen charge, see Allen v.\nUnited States, 164 U. S. 492, 501–502 (1896), urging the\njurors to reexamine the grounds for their opinions and to\ncontinue deliberations “until the end of the day” to achieve\na final verdict on all counts. Tr. 13724 (July 20, 2005).\nWhen the jury failed to break the deadlock, the court told\nthe jurors that it would “take their verdict” instead of\n—————— \n\ncluded 176 counts in all, covering conduct by executives purportedly\n\ninvolved in the alleged fraud. \n\n4                   YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nprolonging deliberations. Id., at 13725. The jury acquit\nted petitioner on the fraud counts but failed to reach a\nverdict on the insider trading counts. The court entered\njudgment on the acquittals and declared a mistrial on the\nhung counts.\n   On November 9, 2005, the Government obtained a new\nindictment against petitioner. This “Eighth Superseding\nIndictment” recharged petitioner with some, but not all, of\nthe insider trading counts on which the jury had previ\nously hung. App. 188. The new indictment refined the\nGovernment’s case: Whereas the earlier indictment had\nnamed multiple defendants, the new indictment dealt\nexclusively with petitioner. And instead of alleging facts\nimplicating a broader fraudulent scheme, the new indict\nment focused on petitioner’s knowledge of the EIN project\nand his failure to disclose that information to the public\nbefore selling his Enron stock.\n   Petitioner moved to dismiss all counts in the new in\ndictment on the ground that the acquittals on the fraud\ncounts precluded the Government from retrying him on\nthe insider trading counts.3 He argued that the jury’s\nacquittals had necessarily decided that he did not possess\nmaterial, nonpublic information about the performance of\nthe EIN project and its value to Enron. In petitioner’s\nview, because reprosecution for insider trading would\nrequire the Government to prove that critical fact, the\nissue-preclusion component of the Double Jeopardy Clause\nbarred a second trial of that issue and mandated dismissal\nof all of the insider trading counts.\n   The District Court denied the motion. After reviewing\nthe trial record, the court disagreed with petitioner’s\n\n——————\n    3 Petitioner\n              had also moved to dismiss the relevant counts in the ear\nlier indictment in response to the Government’s assertion that it could\nreprosecute petitioner for the previously hung counts under that\nindictment as well. See 521 F. 3d 367, 370, n. 4 (CA5 2008).\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nreading of what the jury necessarily decided. In the\ncourt’s telling, the jury likely concluded that petitioner\n“did not knowingly and willfully participate in the scheme\nto defraud described in the conspiracy, securities fraud,\nand wire fraud counts.” 446 F. Supp. 2d 719, 735 (SD Tex.\n2006). The court therefore concluded that the question\nwhether petitioner possessed insider information was not\nnecessarily resolved in the first trial and could be litigated\nanew in a second prosecution.\n  The Court of Appeals disagreed with the District Court’s\nanalysis of the record, but nevertheless affirmed. It rea\nsoned that petitioner “did not dispute” the Government’s\ntheory that he “helped shape the message” of the allegedly\nfraudulent presentations made at the analyst conference,\nand therefore rejected the District Court’s conclusion that\nthe jury had “acquitted [petitioner] on the groun[d] that he\ndid not participate in the fraud.” 521 F. 3d 367, 377 (CA5\n2008). Based on its independent review of the record, the\nCourt of Appeals instead concluded that “the jury must\nhave found when it acquitted [petitioner] that [he] did not\nhave any insider information that contradicted what was\npresented to the public.” Id., at 378. The court acknowl\nedged that this factual determination would normally\npreclude the Government from retrying petitioner for\ninsider trading or money laundering.\n  The court was nevertheless persuaded that a truly\nrational jury, having concluded that petitioner did not\nhave any insider information, would have acquitted him\non the insider trading counts. That the jury failed to\nacquit, and instead hung on those counts, was pivotal in\nthe court’s issue-preclusion analysis. Considering “the\nhung counts along with the acquittals,” the court found it\nimpossible “to decide with any certainty what the jury\nnecessarily determined.” Ibid. Relying on Circuit prece\ndent, United States v. Larkin, 605 F. 2d 1360 (1979), the\ncourt concluded that the conflict between the acquittals\n6                YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nand the hung counts barred the application of issue pre\nclusion in this case. 521 F. 3d, at 378–379.\n   Several courts have taken the contrary view and have\nheld that a jury’s failure to reach a verdict on some counts\nshould play no role in determining the preclusive effect of\nan acquittal. See United States v. Ohayon, 483 F. 3d 1281\n(CA11 2007); United States v. Romeo, 114 F. 3d 141 (CA9\n1997); United States v. Bailin, 977 F. 2d 270 (CA7 1992);\nUnited States v. Frazier, 880 F. 2d 878 (CA6 1989). Oth\ners have sided with the Court of Appeals. See United\nStates v. Howe, 538 F. 3d 820 (CA8 2008); United States v.\nAguilar-Aranceta, 957 F. 2d 18 (CA1 1992); United States\nv. White, 936 F. 2d 1326 (CADC 1991). We granted certio\nrari to resolve the conflict, 555 U. S. ___ (2008), and now\nreverse.\n                              II\n  The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment\nprovides: “[N]or shall any person be subject for the same\noffence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.”\n  While we have decided an exceptionally large number of\ncases interpreting this provision, see, e.g., United States v.\nDiFrancesco, 449 U. S. 117, 126–127 (1980) (collecting\ncases), most of our decisions have found more guidance in\nthe common-law ancestry of the Clause than in its brief\ntext. Thus, for example, while the risk of being fined or\nimprisoned implicates neither “life” nor “limb,” our early\ncases held that double jeopardy protection extends to\npunishments that are not “positively covered by the lan\nguage of [the] amendment.” Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163,\n170 (1874). As we explained, “[i]t is very clearly the spirit\nof the instrument to prevent a second punishment under\njudicial proceedings for the same crime, so far as the\ncommon law gave that protection.” Ibid.\n  Our cases have recognized that the Clause embodies two\nvitally important interests. The first is the “deeply in\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngrained” principle that “the State with all its resources\nand power should not be allowed to make repeated at\ntempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense,\nthereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and\nordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of\nanxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibil\nity that even though innocent he may be found guilty.”\nGreen v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 187–188 (1957); see\nBenton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784, 795–795 (1969); Di-\nFrancesco, 449 U. S., at 127–128. The second interest is\nthe preservation of “the finality of judgments.” Crist v.\nBretz, 437 U. S. 28, 33 (1978).\n   The first interest is implicated whenever the State seeks\na second trial after its first attempt to obtain a conviction\nresults in a mistrial because the jury has failed to reach a\nverdict. In these circumstances, however, while the de\nfendant has an interest in avoiding multiple trials, the\nClause does not prevent the Government from seeking to\nreprosecute. Despite the argument’s textual appeal, we\nhave held that the second trial does not place the defen\ndant in jeopardy “twice.” Richardson v. United States, 468\nU. S. 317, 323 (1984); see 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the\nConstitution §1781, pp. 659–660 (1833). Instead, a jury’s\ninability to reach a decision is the kind of “manifest neces\nsity” that permits the declaration of a mistrial and the\ncontinuation of the initial jeopardy that commenced when\nthe jury was first impaneled. See Arizona v. Washington,\n434 U. S. 497, 505–506 (1978); United States v. Perez, 9\nWheat. 579, 580 (1824). The “interest in giving the prose\ncution one complete opportunity to convict those who have\nviolated its laws” justifies treating the jury’s inability to\nreach a verdict as a nonevent that does not bar retrial.\nWashington, 434 U. S., at 509.\n   While the case before us involves a mistrial on the\ninsider trading counts, the question presented cannot be\nresolved by asking whether the Government should be\n8                YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngiven one complete opportunity to convict petitioner on\nthose charges. Rather, the case turns on the second inter\nest at the core of the Clause. We must determine whether\nthe interest in preserving the finality of the jury’s judg\nment on the fraud counts, including the jury’s finding that\npetitioner did not possess insider information, bars a\nretrial on the insider trading counts. This requires us to\nlook beyond the Clause’s prohibition on being put in jeop\nardy “twice”; the jury’s acquittals unquestionably termi\nnated petitioner’s jeopardy with respect to the issues\nfinally decided in those counts. The proper question,\nunder the Clause’s text, is whether it is appropriate to\ntreat the insider trading charges as the “same offence” as\nthe fraud charges. Our opinion in Ashe v. Swenson, 397\nU. S. 436 (1970), provides the basis for our answer.\n   In Ashe, we squarely held that the Double Jeopardy\nClause precludes the Government from relitigating any\nissue that was necessarily decided by a jury’s acquittal in\na prior trial. In that case, six poker players were robbed\nby a group of masked men. Ashe was charged with—and\nacquitted of—robbing Donald Knight, one of the six play\ners. The State sought to retry Ashe for the robbery of\nanother poker player only weeks after the first jury had\nacquitted him. The second prosecution was successful:\nFacing “substantially stronger” testimony from “witnesses\n[who] were for the most part the same,” id., at 439–440,\nAshe was convicted and sentenced to a 35-year prison\nterm. We concluded that the subsequent prosecution was\nconstitutionally prohibited. Because the only contested\nissue at the first trial was whether Ashe was one of the\nrobbers, we held that the jury’s verdict of acquittal collat\nerally estopped the State from trying him for robbing a\ndifferent player during the same criminal episode. Id., at\n446. We explained that “when an issue of ultimate fact\nhas once been determined by a valid and final judgment”\nof acquittal, it “cannot again be litigated” in a second trial\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfor a separate offense. Id., at 443.4 To decipher what a\njury has necessarily decided, we held that courts should\n“examine the record of a prior proceeding, taking into\naccount the pleadings, evidence, charge, and other rele\nvant matter, and conclude whether a rational jury could\nhave grounded its verdict upon an issue other than that\nwhich the defendant seeks to foreclose from considera\ntion.” Id., at 444 (internal quotation marks omitted). We\nexplained that the inquiry “must be set in a practical\nframe and viewed with an eye to all the circumstances of\nthe proceedings.” Ibid. (quoting Sealfon v. United States,\n332 U. S. 575, 579 (1948) (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n   Unlike Ashe, the case before us today entails a trial that\nincluded multiple counts rather than a trial for a single\noffense. And, while Ashe involved an acquittal for that\nsingle offense, this case involves an acquittal on some\ncounts and a mistrial declared on others. The reasoning in\nAshe is nevertheless controlling because, for double jeop\nardy purposes, the jury’s inability to reach a verdict on the\ninsider trading counts was a nonevent and the acquittals\non the fraud counts are entitled to the same effect as\nAshe’s acquittal.\n   As noted above, see supra, at 4, the Court of Appeals\nreasoned that the hung counts must be considered to\ndetermine what issues the jury decided in the first trial.\nViewed in isolation, the court explained, the acquittals on\n——————\n   4 Although the doctrine of collateral estoppel had developed in civil\n\nlitigation, we had already extended it to criminal proceedings when\nAshe was decided. The justification for this application was first offered\nby Justice Holmes, who observed that “[i]t cannot be that the safe\nguards of the person, so often and so rightly mentioned with solemn\nreverence, are less than those that protect from a liability in debt.”\nUnited States v. Oppenheimer, 242 U. S. 85, 87 (1916). Currently, the\nmore descriptive term “issue preclusion” is often used in lieu of “collat\neral estoppel.” See Restatement (Second) of Judgments §27 (1980).\n10               YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe fraud charges would preclude retrial because they\nappeared to support petitioner’s argument that the jury\ndecided he lacked insider information. 521 F. 3d, at 378.\nViewed alongside the hung counts, however, the acquittals\nappeared less decisive. The problem, as the court saw it,\nwas that, if “the jury found that [petitioner] did not have\ninsider information, then the jury, acting rationally, would\nalso have acquitted [him] of the insider trading counts.”\nIbid. The fact that the jury hung was a logical wrinkle\nthat made it impossible for the court “to decide with any\ncertainty what the jury necessarily determined.” Ibid.\nBecause petitioner failed to show what the jury decided,\nid., at 380, the court refused to find the Government\nprecluded from pursuing the hung counts in a new\nprosecution.\n   The Court of Appeals’ issue-preclusion analysis was in\nerror. A hung count is not a “relevant” part of the “record\nof [the] prior proceeding.” See Ashe, 397 U. S., at 444\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Because a jury speaks\nonly through its verdict, its failure to reach a verdict\ncannot—by negative implication—yield a piece of informa\ntion that helps put together the trial puzzle. A mistried\ncount is therefore nothing like the other forms of record\nmaterial that Ashe suggested should be part of the preclu\nsion inquiry. Ibid.; see also Black’s Law Dictionary 1301\n(8th ed. 2004) (defining “record” as the “official report of\nthe proceedings in a case, including the filed papers, ver\nbatim transcript of the trial or hearing (if any), and tangi\nble exhibits”). Unlike the pleadings, the jury charge, or\nthe evidence introduced by the parties, there is no way to\ndecipher what a hung count represents. Even in the usual\nsense of “relevance,” a hung count hardly “make[s] the\nexistence of any fact . . . more probable or less probable.”\nFed. Rule Evid. 401. A host of reasons—sharp disagree\nment, confusion about the issues, exhaustion after a long\ntrial, to name but a few—could work alone or in tandem to\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncause a jury to hang.5 To ascribe meaning to a hung count\nwould presume an ability to identify which factor was at\nplay in the jury room. But that is not reasoned analysis; it\nis guesswork.6 Such conjecture about possible reasons for\na jury’s failure to reach a decision should play no part in\nassessing the legal consequences of a unanimous verdict\nthat the jurors did return.\n   A contrary conclusion would require speculation into\nwhat transpired in the jury room. Courts properly avoid\nsuch explorations into the jury’s sovereign space, see\nUnited States v. Powell, 469 U. S. 57, 66 (1984); Fed. Rule\nEvid. 606(b), and for good reason. The jury’s deliberations\nare secret and not subject to outside examination. If there\nis to be an inquiry into what the jury decided, the “evi\ndence should be confined to the points in controversy on\nthe former trial, to the testimony given by the parties, and\nto the questions submitted to the jury for their considera\ntion.” Packet Co. v. Sickles, 5 Wall. 580, 593 (1866); see\nalso Vaise v. Delaval, 99 Eng. Rep. 944 (K. B. 1785) (Lord\nMansfield, C. J.) (refusing to rely on juror affidavits to\nimpeach a verdict reached by a coin flip); J. Wigmore,\nEvidence §2349, pp. 681–690, and n. 2 (McNaughton rev.\ned. 1961 and Supp. 1991).\n   Accordingly, we hold that the consideration of hung\ncounts has no place in the issue-preclusion analysis.\n——————\n  5 Indeed, there were many indications that the jury in this case could\n\nhave been exhausted after the 13-week trial. See Reply Brief for\nPetitioner 9–10 (cataloging numerous “statements on the record [that]\nreveal the very real possibility that the jurors cut their deliberations\nshort out of exhaustion”).\n  6 It would also require too much of the defendant. To preclude retrial,\n\nhe must show that the jury necessarily decided an issue in his favor.\nYet, to borrow from the Court of Appeals, “[b]ecause it is impossible to\ndetermine why [a] jury hung,” 521 F. 3d, at 379, the defendant will\nhave to rebut all inferences about what may have motivated the jury to\nhang without the ability to seek conclusive proof. See Fed. Rule Evid.\n606(b). There is no reason to impose such a burden on a defendant.\n12                YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nIndeed, if it were relevant, the fact that petitioner has\nalready survived one trial should be a factor cutting in\nfavor of, rather than against, applying a double jeopardy\nbar. To identify what a jury necessarily determined at\ntrial, courts should scrutinize a jury’s decisions, not its\nfailures to decide. A jury’s verdict of acquittal represents\nthe community’s collective judgment regarding all the\nevidence and arguments presented to it. Even if the ver\ndict is “based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation,”\nFong Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141, 143 (1962) (per\ncuriam), its finality is unassailable. See, e.g., Washington,\n434 U. S., at 503; Sanabria v. United States, 437 U. S. 54,\n64 (1978). Thus, if the possession of insider information\nwas a critical issue of ultimate fact in all of the charges\nagainst petitioner, a jury verdict that necessarily decided\nthat issue in his favor protects him from prosecution for\nany charge for which that is an essential element.\n                             III\n    The Government relies heavily on two of our cases,\nRichardson v. United States, 468 U. S. 317, and United\nStates v. Powell, 469 U. S. 57, to argue that it is entitled to\nretry petitioner on the insider trading counts. Neither\nprecedent can bear the weight the Government places on\nit.\n    In Richardson, the defendant was indicted on three\ncounts of narcotics violations. The jury acquitted him on\none count but hung on the others. Richardson moved to\nbar retrial on the hung counts, insisting that reprosecu\ntion would place him twice in jeopardy for the same of\nfense. Unlike petitioner in this case, Richardson did not\nargue that retrial was barred because the jury’s verdict of\nacquittal meant that it necessarily decided an essential\nfact in his favor. He simply asserted that the hung counts,\nstanding alone, shielded him from reprosecution. We\ndisagreed and held that “the protection of the Double\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nJeopardy Clause by its terms applies only if there has\nbeen some event, such as an acquittal, which terminates\nthe original jeopardy.” 468 U. S., at 325. “[T]he failure of\nthe jury to reach a verdict,” we explained, “is not an event\nwhich terminates jeopardy.” Ibid. From this the Govern\nment extrapolates the altogether different principle that\nretrial is always permitted whenever a jury convicts on\nsome counts and hangs on others. Brief for United States\n23–24. But Richardson was not so broad. Rather, our\nconclusion was a rejection of the argument—similar to the\none the Government urges today—that a mistrial is an\nevent of significance. In so holding, we did not open the\ndoor to using a mistried count to ignore the preclusive\neffect of a jury’s acquittal.\n   The Government next contends that an acquittal can\nnever preclude retrial on a mistried count because it\nwould impute irrationality to the jury in violation of the\nrule articulated in Powell, 469 U. S. 57. In Powell, the\ndefendant was charged with various drug offenses. The\njury acquitted Powell of the substantive drug charges but\nconvicted her of using a telephone in “ ‘committing and in\ncausing and facilitating’ ” those same offenses. Id., at 59–\n60. Powell attacked the verdicts on appeal as irrationally\ninconsistent and urged the reversal of her convictions.\nShe insisted that “collateral estoppel should apply to\nverdicts rendered by a single jury, to preclude acceptance\nof a guilty verdict on a telephone facilitation count where\nthe jury acquits the defendant of the predicate felony.”\nId., at 64. We rejected this argument, reasoning that\nissue preclusion is “predicated on the assumption that the\njury acted rationally.” Id., at 68.\n   Arguing that a jury that acquits on some counts while\ninexplicably hanging on others is not rational, the Gov\nernment contends that issue preclusion is as inappropriate\nin this case as it was in Powell. There are two serious\nflaws in this line of reasoning. First, it takes Powell’s\n14                YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntreatment of inconsistent verdicts and imports it into an\nentirely different context involving both verdicts and\nseemingly inconsistent hung counts. But the situations\nare quite dissimilar. In Powell, respect for the jury’s\nverdicts counseled giving each verdict full effect, however\ninconsistent. As we explained, the jury’s verdict “brings to\nthe criminal process, in addition to the collective judgment\nof the community, an element of needed finality.” Id., at\n67. By comparison, hung counts have never been accorded\nrespect as a matter of law or history, and are not similar\nto jury verdicts in any relevant sense. By equating them,\nthe Government’s argument fails. Second, the Govern\nment’s reliance on Powell assumes that a mistried count\ncan, in context, be evidence of irrationality. But, as we\nexplained above, see supra, at 7–8, the fact that a jury\nhangs is evidence of nothing—other than, of course, that it\nhas failed to decide anything. By relying on hung counts\nto question the basis of the jury’s verdicts, the Govern\nment violates the very assumption of rationality it invokes\nfor support.\n  At bottom, the Government misreads our cases that\nhave rejected attempts to question the validity of a jury’s\nverdict. In Powell and, before that, in Dunn, 284 U. S.\n390, we were faced with jury verdicts that, on their face,\nwere logically inconsistent and yet we refused to impugn\nthe legitimacy of either verdict. In this case, there is\nmerely a suggestion that the jury may have acted irration\nally. And instead of resting that suggestion on a verdict,\nthe Government relies on a hung count, the thinnest reed\nof all. If the Court in Powell and Dunn declined to use a\nclearly inconsistent verdict to second-guess the soundness\nof another verdict, then, a fortiori, a potentially inconsis\ntent hung count could not command a different result.\n                              IV\n     One final matter requires discussion. The Government\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nargues that even if we conclude (as we do) that acquittals\ncan preclude retrial on counts on which the same jury\nhangs, we should nevertheless affirm the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals because petitioner failed to show that the\njury necessarily resolved in his favor an issue of ultimate\nfact that the Government must prove in order to convict\nhim of insider trading and money laundering. See Brief\nfor United States 41–45. Given the length and complexity\nof the proceedings, this factual dispute is understandable.\nThe District Court and Court of Appeals each read the\nrecord differently, disagreeing as to what the jury neces\nsarily decided in its acquittals. Compare 446 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 735 (“[T]he jury necessarily determined that Defendant\nYeager did not knowingly and willfully participate or\nagree to participate in a scheme to defraud in connection\nwith the alleged false statements or material omissions\nmade at the analyst conference and press releases”), with\n521 F. 3d, at 378 (“[T]he jury must have found when it\nacquitted Yeager that Yeager himself did not have any\ninsider information that contradicted what was presented\nto the public”).

It is insufficient for the Court to say that, on\nremand, the Court of Appeals “may,” “[i]f it chooses,”\n“revisit its factual analysis.” Ante, at 15. The correct\ncourse would be to require the Court of Appeals to do so.\n   As JUSTICE ALITO explains, the judgments of acquittal\npreclude the Government from retrying petitioner on the\nissue of his possession of insider information if, and only\nif, “it would have been irrational for the jury to acquit\nwithout finding that fact.” Post, at 1; see Ashe v. Swenson,\n397 U. S. 436, 444 (1970) (retrial not precluded if “a ra\ntional jury could have grounded its verdict upon an issue\nother than that which the defendant seeks to foreclose”).\n   For the reasons given by JUSTICE ALITO, there are\ngrounds here to question whether petitioner has met this\ndemanding standard. Post, at 2. The District Court,\nwhich was the court most familiar with the record, found\nthat petitioner could not make this showing because a\nrational jury could have acquitted him of securities fraud\non a different basis—namely, that petitioner did not cause\nthe misleading statements to be made.

The Court today corrects that misreading\nof the Double Jeopardy Clause. The question remains\nwhether the Clause permits petitioner’s retrial for the\nquite distinct reason JUSTICE ALITO describes.

SCOTT YEAGER, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [June 18, 2009] \n\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS and\nJUSTICE ALITO join, dissenting.\n  The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment\nprovides that no person shall “be subject for the same\noffence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” The\nCourt today holds that this proscription, as interpreted in\nAshe v. Swenson, 397 U. S. 436 (1970), sometimes bars\nretrial of hung counts if the jury acquits on factually re\nlated counts. Because that result neither accords with the\noriginal meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause nor is\nrequired by the Court’s precedents, I dissent.\n                             I\n  Today’s opinion begins with the proclamation that this\nCourt has “found more guidance in the common-law ances\ntry of the [Double Jeopardy] Clause than its brief text.”\nAnte, at 6. Would that it were so. This case would be easy\nindeed if our cases had adhered to the Clause’s original\nmeaning. The English common-law pleas of auterfoits\nacquit and auterfoits convict, on which the Clause was\nbased, barred only repeated “prosecution for the same\nidentical act and crime.” 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries\non the Laws of England 330 (1769) (emphasis added). See\nalso Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508, 530–535 (1990)\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting). As described by Sir Matthew\nHale, “a man acquitted for stealing [a] horse” could be\n2                   YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nlater “arraigned and convict[ed] for stealing the saddle,\ntho both were done at the same time.” 2 Pleas of the\nCrown 246 (1736). Under the common-law pleas, the\njury’s acquittal of Yeager on the fraud counts would have\nposed no bar to further prosecution for the distinct crimes\nof insider trading and money laundering.\n   But that is water over the dam. In Ashe the Court\ndeparted from the original meaning of the Double Jeop\nardy Clause, holding that it precludes successive prosecu\ntions on distinct crimes when facts essential to conviction\nof the second crime have necessarily been resolved in the\ndefendant’s favor by a verdict of acquittal of the first\ncrime. 397 U. S., at 445–446.1 Even if I am to adhere to\nAshe on stare decisis grounds, cf. Grady, supra, at 528\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting), today’s holding is an illogical\nextension of that case. Ashe held only that the Clause\nsometimes bars successive prosecution of facts found\nduring “a prior proceeding.” 397 U. S., at 444. But today\nthe Court bars retrial on hung counts after what was not,\nunder this Court’s theory of “continuing jeopardy,” Jus\ntices of Boston Municipal Court v. Lydon, 466 U. S. 294,\n308 (1984), a prior proceeding but simply an earlier stage\nof the same proceeding.\n   As an historical matter, the common-law pleas could be\ninvoked only once “there ha[d] been a conviction or an\nacquittal—after a complete trial.” Crist v. Bretz, 437 U. S.\n——————\n    1 Because this case arises in federal court, the federal doctrine of\nissue preclusion might have prevented the Government from retrying\nYeager even without Ashe’s innovation. See United States v. Oppen\nheimer, 242 U. S. 85, 87 (1916). But the District Court held that the\njury in this case had not necessarily decided that Yeager lacked inside\ninformation (the fact that Yeager claims the Government is barred from\nrelitigating), 446 F. Supp. 2d 719, 735 (SD Tex. 2006), and jurisdiction\nfor this interlocutory appeal of that holding comes by way of the collat\neral order doctrine, which encompasses claims of former jeopardy,\nAbney v. United States, 431 U. S. 651, 662 (1977). We have not ac\ncorded the same privilege to litigants asserting issue preclusion.\n                    Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                   3\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n28, 33 (1978). This Court has extended the protections of\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause by holding that jeopardy\nattaches earlier: at the time a jury is empanelled and\nsworn. Id., at 38. Although one might think that this\nearly attachment would mean that any second trial with a\nnew jury would constitute a second jeopardy, the Court\namended its innovation by holding that discharge of a\ndeadlocked jury does not “terminat[e] the original jeop\nardy,” Richardson v. United States, 468 U. S. 317, 325\n(1984). Under this continuing-jeopardy principle, retrial\nafter a jury has failed to reach a verdict is not a new trial\nbut part of the same proceeding.2\n  Today’s holding is inconsistent with this principle. It\ninterprets the Double Jeopardy Clause, for the first time,\nto have effect internally within a single prosecution, even\nthough the “ ‘criminal proceedings against [the] accused\nhave not run their full course.’ ” Lydon, supra, at 308\n(quoting Price v. Georgia, 398 U. S. 323, 326 (1970)). As a\nconceptual matter, it makes no sense to say that events\noccurring within a single prosecution can cause an accused\nto be “twice put in jeopardy.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. And\nour cases, until today, have acknowledged that. Ever\nsince Dunn v. United States, 284 U. S. 390, 393 (1932), we\nhave refused to set aside convictions that were inconsis\ntent with acquittals in the same trial; and we made clear\n——————\n  2 That the Government issued a new indictment after the mistrial in\n\nthis case does not alter the fact that, for double jeopardy purposes,\nretrial would have been part of the same, initial proceeding. As a\nmatter of practice, it seems that prosecutors and courts treat retrials\nafter mistrials as part of the same proceeding by filing superseding\nindictments under the original docket number. See, e.g., Superseding\nInformation in United States v. Pena, Case No. 8:03–cr–476–T–23EAJ\n(MD Fla., Feb. 17, 2005). The Court implies that the new indictment in\nthis case materially refined the charges, ante, at 4, but the only rele\nvant changes were dropping of the other defendants and elimination of\na few counts and related factual allegations. Compare App. 6–71 with\nApp. 188–200.\n4                 YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nin United States v. Powell, 469 U. S. 57, 64–65 (1984), that\nAshe does not mandate a different result. There is no\nreason to treat perceived inconsistencies between hung\ncounts and acquittals any differently.\n   Richardson accentuates the point. Under our cases, if\nan appellate court reverses a conviction for lack of consti\ntutionally sufficient evidence, that determination consti\ntutes an acquittal which, under the Double Jeopardy\nClause, precludes further prosecution. Burks v. United\nStates, 437 U. S. 1, 11 (1978). In Richardson, the defen\ndant sought to prevent retrial after a jury failed to reach a\nverdict, claiming that the case should not have gone to the\njury because the Government failed to present sufficient\nevidence. 468 U. S., at 322–323. The Court held that the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause was inapplicable because there\nhad not been an “event, such as an acquittal, which termi\nnate[d] the original jeopardy.” Id., at 325. I do not see\nwhy the Double Jeopardy Clause effect of a jury acquittal\non a different count should be any different from the Dou\nble Jeopardy Clause effect of the prosecution’s failure to\npresent a case sufficient to go to the jury on the same\ncount. In both cases, the predicate necessary for Double\nJeopardy Clause preclusion of a new prosecution exists: in\nthe former, the factual findings implicit in the jury’s ver\ndict of acquittal, in the latter, the State’s presentation of a\ncase so weak that it would have demanded a jury verdict\nof acquittal. In both cases, it seems to me, the Double\nJeopardy Clause cannot be invoked because the jeopardy\nwith respect to the retried count has not terminated.\n   The acquittals here did not, as the majority argues,\n“unquestionably terminat[e] [Yeager’s] jeopardy with\nrespect to the issues finally decided” in those counts. Ante,\nat 8 (emphasis added). Jeopardy is commenced and ter\nminated charge by charge, not issue by issue. And if the\nprosecution’s failure to present sufficient evidence at a\nfirst trial cannot prevent retrial on a hung count because\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)             5\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe retrial is considered part of the same proceeding, then\nthere is no basis for invoking Ashe to prevent retrial in the\npresent case. If a conviction can stand with a contradic\ntory acquittal when both are pronounced at the same trial,\nthere is no reason why an acquittal should prevent the\nState from pressing for a contradictory conviction in the\ncontinuation of the prosecution on the hung counts.\n                              II\n   The Court’s extension of Ashe to these circumstances\ncannot even be justified based on the rationales underly\ning that holding. Invoking issue preclusion to bar seriatim\nprosecutions has the salutary effect of preventing the\nGovernment from circumventing acquittals by forcing\ndefendants “to ‘run the gantlet’ a second time” on effec\ntively the same charges. 397 U. S., at 446. In cases where\nthe prosecution merely seeks to get “one full and fair\nopportunity to convict” on all charges brought in an initial\nindictment, Ohio v. Johnson, 467 U. S. 493, 502 (1984),\nthere is no risk of such gamesmanship. We have said that\n“where the State has made no effort to prosecute the\ncharges seriatim, the considerations of double jeopardy\nprotection implicit in the application of collateral estoppel\nare inapplicable.” Id., at 500, n. 9.\n   Moreover, barring retrial when a jury acquits on some\ncounts and hangs on others bears only a tenuous relation\nship to preserving the finality of “an issue of ultimate fact\n[actually] determined by a valid and final judgment.”\nAshe, supra, at 443. There is no clear, unanimous jury\nfinding here. In the unusual situation in which a factual\nfinding upon which an acquittal must have been based\nwould also logically require an acquittal on the hung\ncount, all that can be said for certain is that the conflicting\ndispositions are irrational—the result of “mistake, com\npromise, or lenity.” Powell, 469 U. S., at 65. It is at least\nas likely that the irrationality consisted of failing to make\n6                   YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe factual finding necessary to support the acquittal as it\nis that the irrationality consisted of failing to adhere to\nthat factual finding with respect to the hung count. While\nI agree that courts should avoid speculation as to why a\njury reached a particular result, ante, at 11, the Court’s\nopinion steps in the wrong direction by pretending that\nthe acquittals here mean something that they in all prob\nability do not.3 Powell, supra, at 69, concluded that “the\nbest course to take is simply to insulate jury verdicts” from\nreview on grounds of inconsistency. In my view the same\nconclusion applies to claims that inconsistency will arise\nfrom proceeding to conviction on hung counts.\n   The burdens created by the Court’s opinion today are\nlikely to be substantial. The Ashe inquiry will require\ncourts to “examine the record of a prior proceeding, taking\ninto account the pleadings, evidence, charge, and other\nrelevant matter, and conclude whether a rational jury\ncould have grounded its verdict upon an issue other than\nthat which the defendant seeks to foreclose from consid\neration.” 397 U. S., at 446 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). What is more, our holding in Abney v. United\nStates, 431 U. S. 651 (1977), ensures that every defendant\nin Yeager’s shoes will be entitled to an immediate inter\nlocutory appeal (and petition for certiorari) whenever his\nAshe claim is rejected by the trial court. Abney, supra, at\n662.\n                         *    *     *\n   Until today, this Court has consistently held that retrial\nafter a jury has been unable to reach a verdict is part of\nthe original prosecution and that there can be no second\n——————\n  3 The Court claims that a jury’s failure to reach a verdict is not rele\n\nvant evidence, ante, at 10, but its justifications for that statement are\nutterly unpersuasive. It is obvious that a failure to reach a verdict on\none count “make[s] the existence” of a factual finding on a necessary\npredicate for both counts substantially “less probable,” Fed.

SCOTT YEAGER, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n                        [June 18, 2009]\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA and JUSTICE\nTHOMAS join, dissenting.\n  I join JUSTICE SCALIA’s dissenting opinion. When a jury\nacquits on some counts but cannot reach agreement on\nothers, I do not think that the Double Jeopardy Clause\nprecludes retrial on the “hung” counts.\n  As a result of today’s decision, however, the law is now\nto the contrary, and I write separately to note that the\nCourt’s holding makes it imperative that the doctrine of\nissue preclusion be applied with the rigor prescribed in\nAshe v. Swenson, 397 U. S. 436 (1970). Loose application\nof the doctrine will lead to exceedingly complicated and\nprotracted litigation, both in the trial court and on appeal,\nand may produce unjust results.\n  Ashe made it clear that an acquittal on one charge\nprecludes a subsequent trial on a different charge only if\n“a rational jury” could not have acquitted on the first\ncharge without finding in the defendant’s favor on a fac\ntual issue that the prosecution would have to prove in\norder to convict in the later trial. Id., at 444. This is a\ndemanding standard. The second trial is not precluded\nsimply because it is unlikely—or even very unlikely—that\nthe original jury acquitted without finding the fact in\nquestion. Only if it would have been irrational for the jury\nto acquit without finding that fact is the subsequent trial\nbarred. And the defendant has the burden of showing that\n2                YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n“the issue whose relitigation he seeks to foreclose was\nactually decided in the first proceeding.” Dowling v.\nUnited States, 493 U. S. 342, 350 (1990).\n   The situation presented in a case like the one now be\nfore us—where the jury acquits on some counts but cannot\nreach a verdict on others—calls for special care in the\napplication of the Ashe standard. In such a situation, the\nconclusion that the not-guilty verdicts preclude retrial on\nthe hung counts necessarily means that the jury did not\nact rationally. But courts should begin with the presump\ntion that a jury’s actions can rationally be reconciled. In\nan analogous situation—where it is claimed that a verdict\nmust be set aside on the ground that the findings set out\nin a jury’s answers to special interrogatories are inconsis\ntent—“it is the duty of the courts to attempt to harmonize\nthe answers, if it is possible under a fair reading of them:\n‘Where there is a view of the case that makes the jury’s\nanswers to special interrogatories consistent, they must be\nresolved that way.’ ” Gallick v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co.,\n372 U. S. 108, 119 (1963) (quoting Atlantic & Gulf Steve\ndores, Inc. v. Ellerman Lines, Ltd., 369 U. S. 355, 364\n(1962)). A similar approach is appropriate here.\n   In the present case, there is reason to question whether\nthe Ashe standard was met. It is clear that the fraud\ncounts required proof of an element not necessary for\nconviction on the insider trading charge, namely, that\npetitioner “caused” material misstatements or omissions\nto be made at the January 20, 2000, analyst conference\nand in the press releases that formed the basis for the\nwire fraud counts. See App. 107 (jury instruction on count\ntwo (securities fraud)), 118 (jury instruction on counts\nthree through six (wire fraud)). And it is far from appar\nent that the jury’s not-guilty verdict on the fraud counts\ncould not have rationally been based on a determination\nthat this element—that petitioner caused the material\nmisstatements or omissions—was not proved beyond a\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nreasonable doubt.\n  The District Court Judge, who was of course familiar\nwith the trial evidence, analyzed this issue as follows:\n    “The theory of the defense, evident in closing argu\n    ment and the direct testimony of Defendant Yeager,\n    argued that Defendant Yeager did not participate in\n    the crafting of the statements in the press releases;\n    did not participate in the creation of slides or state\n    ments presented at the analysts conference; and did\n    not reach an agreement with any other person to\n    make false, misleading, or deceptive statements or\n    material omissions of fact.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 55a.\n   The record provides support for the District Court’s\nanalysis. In his summation, petitioner’s attorney argued\nthat “Scott Yeager had nothing to do with Counts 3 to 6\n[the securities and wire fraud counts].” 80 Tr. 13384.\nWith respect to the January 20, 2000, conference that\nprovided the basis for the securities fraud count, peti\ntioner’s attorney emphasized that his client “didn’t say\nanything.” Id., at 13365. Counsel reiterated that peti\ntioner “didn’t make a presentation. He didn’t make a\nstatement.” Ibid.; id., at 13394. Counsel’s summation on\nthis point summarized portions of petitioner’s trial testi\nmony in which he minimized his involvement in matters\nrelating to the conference. See 52 id., at 9932–9933,\n9938–9947, and 9953.\n   With respect to the press releases on which the wire\nfraud counts were based, petitioner’s attorney argued:\n“Scott Yeager had nothing to do with the press releases.”\n80 id., at 13384. “We didn’t make any press releases.” Id.,\nat 13394. “Show me the evidence. Show me where Scott\nparticipated in a press release.” Id., at 13406. Again,\ncounsel’s comments in summation tracked petitioner’s\ntestimony denying participation in the press releases. See\n52 id., at 9911, 9913; 80 id., at 13384.\n4                YEAGER v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   The above portions of the record suggest that a rational\njury might have found that petitioner did not “cause” the\nmisstatements or omissions at the conference or in the\npress releases. In light of the length and complexity of the\ntrial record, I am not in a position to say with certainty\nthat the Ashe standard was not met in this case, but the\nbrief discussion of this question in the opinion of the Court\nof Appeals does not satisfactorily show that the District\nCourt’s analysis was incorrect. Concluding that the not\nguilty verdict on the securities fraud count could not have\nbeen based on a finding that respondent did not cause the\nmisstatements or omissions at the conference, the Court of\nAppeals stated that petitioner “did not dispute” that he\n“helped shape the message of the conference presenta\ntions.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a. But there is surely\ntension between that statement and the previously men\ntioned portions of petitioner’s trial testimony and the\ndefense summation.\n   Because the Court of Appeals held that Ashe does not\napply when a jury acquits on some counts and hangs on\nothers, that court’s analysis of the possible grounds for the\njury’s securities fraud verdict was not necessary to support\nthe court’s decision. Now that this Court has held that\nAshe does govern in this context, a reexamination of\nthe possible grounds for the fraud count acquittals is\nwarranted.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145859/", "sha1": "4625a4c4d2128e71dd8aaa8a005885cf0a920e99", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-072", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:08:37"}
