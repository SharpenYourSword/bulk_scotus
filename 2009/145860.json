OSBORNE \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n        No. 08–6. Argued March 2, 2009—Decided June 18, 2009\nRespondent Osborne was convicted of sexual assault and other crimes\n  in state court. Years later, he filed this suit under 42 U. S. C. §1983,\n  claiming he had a due process right to access the evidence used\n  against him in order to subject it to DNA testing at his own expense.\n  The Federal District Court first dismissed his claim under Heck v.\n  Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477, holding that Osborne must proceed in ha\n  beas because he sought to set the stage for an attack on his convic\n  tion. The Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that §1983 was the\n  proper vehicle for Osborne’s claims. On remand, the District Court\n  granted Osborne summary judgment, concluding that he had a lim\n  ited constitutional right to the new testing under the unique and spe\n  cific facts presented, i.e., that such testing had been unavailable at\n  trial, that it could be accomplished at almost no cost to the State, and\n  that the results were likely to be material. The Ninth Circuit af\n  firmed, relying on the prosecutorial duty to disclose exculpatory evi\n  dence under, e.g., Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83.\nHeld: Assuming Osborne’s claims can be pursued using §1983, he has\n no constitutional right to obtain postconviction access to the State’s\n evidence for DNA testing. Pp. 8–21.\n    (a) DNA testing has an unparalleled ability both to exonerate the\n wrongly convicted and to identify the guilty. The availability of new\n DNA testing technologies, however, cannot mean that every criminal\n conviction, or even every criminal conviction involving biological evi\n dence, is suddenly in doubt. The task of establishing rules to harness\n DNA’s power to prove innocence without unnecessarily overthrowing\n the established criminal justice system belongs primarily to the legis\n lature. See Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 719. Forty-six\n2       DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL \n\n                      DIST. v. OSBORNE \n\n                           Syllabus \n\n\n    States and the Federal Government have already enacted statutes\n    dealing specifically with access to evidence for DNA testing. These\n    laws recognize the value of DNA testing but also the need for condi\n    tions on accessing the State’s evidence. Alaska is one of a handful of\n    States yet to enact specific DNA testing legislation, but Alaska courts\n    are addressing how to apply existing discovery and postconviction re\n    lief laws to this novel technology. Pp. 8–11.\n       (b) The Court assumes without deciding that the Ninth Circuit was\n    correct that Heck does not bar Osborne’s §1983 claim. That claim can\n    be rejected without resolving the proper application of Heck. Pp. 12–\n    13.\n       (c) The Ninth Circuit erred in finding a due process violation.\n    Pp. 13–21.\n          (i) While Osborne does have a liberty interest in pursuing the\n    postconviction relief granted by the State, the Ninth Circuit erred in\n    extending the Brady right of pretrial disclosure to the postconviction\n    context. Osborne has already been found guilty and therefore has\n    only a limited liberty interest in postconviction relief. See, e.g.,\n    Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390, 399. Instead of the Brady inquiry,\n    the question is whether consideration of Osborne’s claim within the\n    framework of the State’s postconviction relief procedures “offends\n    some [fundamental] principle of justice” or “transgresses any recog\n    nized principle of fundamental fairness in operation.” Medina v.\n    California, 505 U. S. 437, 446, 448. Federal courts may upset a\n    State’s postconviction relief procedures only if they are fundamen\n    tally inadequate to vindicate the substantive rights provided.\n       There is nothing inadequate about Alaska’s postconviction relief\n    procedures in general or its methods for applying those procedures to\n    persons seeking access to evidence for DNA testing. The State pro\n    vides a substantive right to be released on a sufficiently compelling\n    showing of new evidence that establishes innocence. It also provides\n    for discovery in postconviction proceedings, and has—through judi\n    cial decision—specified that such discovery is available to those seek\n    ing access to evidence for DNA testing. These procedures are similar\n    to those provided by federal law and the laws of other States, and\n    they satisfy due process. The same is true for Osborne’s reliance on a\n    claimed federal right to be released upon proof of “actual innocence.”\n    Even assuming such a right exists, which the Court has not decided\n    and does not decide, there is no due process problem, given the pro\n    cedures available to access evidence for DNA testing. Pp. 13–18.\n          (ii) The Court rejects Osborne’s invitation to recognize a free\n    standing, substantive due process right to DNA evidence untethered\n    from the liberty interests he hopes to vindicate with it. In the cir\n    cumstances of this case, there is no such right. Generally, the Court\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  is “reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process be\n  cause guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered\n  area are scarce and open-ended.” Collins v. Harker Heights, 503\n  U. S. 115, 125. There is no long history of a right of access to state\n  evidence for DNA testing that might prove innocence. “The mere\n  novelty of such a claim is reason enough to doubt that ‘substantive\n  due process’ sustains it.” Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 303. More\n  over, to suddenly constitutionalize this area would short-circuit what\n  has been a prompt and considered legislative response by Congress\n  and the States. It would shift to the Federal Judiciary responsibility\n  for devising rules governing DNA access and creating a new constitu\n  tional code of procedures to answer the myriad questions that would\n  arise. There is no reason to suppose that federal courts’ answers to\n  those questions will be any better than those of state courts and leg\n  islatures, and good reason to suspect the opposite.

It has\nthe potential to significantly improve both the criminal\njustice system and police investigative practices. The\nFederal Government and the States have recognized this,\nand have developed special approaches to ensure that this\nevidentiary tool can be effectively incorporated into estab\nlished criminal procedure—usually but not always\nthrough legislation.\n   Against this prompt and considered response, the re\nspondent, William Osborne, proposes a different approach:\nthe recognition of a freestanding and far-reaching consti\ntutional right of access to this new type of evidence. The\nnature of what he seeks is confirmed by his decision to file\nthis lawsuit in federal court under 42 U. S. C. §1983, not\nwithin the state criminal justice system. This approach\nwould take the development of rules and procedures in\nthis area out of the hands of legislatures and state courts\n2    DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                   DIST. v.

There is no reason to constitutionalize the\nissue in this way. Because the decision below would do\njust that, we reverse.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   This lawsuit arose out of a violent crime committed 16\nyears ago, which has resulted in a long string of litigation\nin the state and federal courts. On the evening of March\n22, 1993, two men driving through Anchorage, Alaska,\nsolicited sex from a female prostitute, K. G. She agreed to\nperform fellatio on both men for $100 and got in their car.\nThe three spent some time looking for a place to stop and\nended up in a deserted area near Earthquake Park. When\nK. G. demanded payment in advance, the two men pulled\nout a gun and forced her to perform fellatio on the driver\nwhile the passenger penetrated her vaginally, using a blue\ncondom she had brought. The passenger then ordered\nK. G. out of the car and told her to lie face-down in the\nsnow. Fearing for her life, she refused, and the two men\nchoked her and beat her with the gun. When K. G. tried\nto flee, the passenger beat her with a wooden axe handle\nand shot her in the head while she lay on the ground.\nThey kicked some snow on top of her and left her for dead.\n521 F. 3d 1118, 1122 (CA9 2008) (case below); Osborne v.\nState, 163 P. 3d 973, 975–976 (Alaska App. 2007) (Osborne\nII); App. 27, 42–44.\n   K. G. did not die; the bullet had only grazed her head.\nOnce the two men left, she found her way back to the road,\nand flagged down a passing car to take her home. Ulti\nmately, she received medical care and spoke to the police.\nAt the scene of the crime, the police recovered a spent\nshell casing, the axe handle, some of K. G.’s clothing\nstained with blood, and the blue condom. Jackson v.\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

In his car they discovered a\ngun (which matched the shell casing), as well as several\nitems K. G. had been carrying the night of the attack. Id.,\nat 116a, 118a–119a. The car also matched the description\nK. G. had given to the police. Jackson admitted that he\nhad been the driver during the rape and assault, and told\nthe police that William Osborne had been his passenger.\n521 F. 3d, at 1122–1123; 423 F. 3d 1050, 1051–1052 (CA9\n2005); Osborne v. State, 110 P. 3d 986, 990 (Alaska App.\n2005) (Osborne I). Other evidence also implicated Os\nborne. K. G. picked out his photograph (with some uncer\ntainty) and at trial she identified Osborne as her attacker.\nOther witnesses testified that shortly before the crime,\nOsborne had called Jackson from an arcade, and then\ndriven off with him. An axe handle similar to the one at\nthe scene of the crime was found in Osborne’s room on the\nmilitary base where he lived.\n   The State also performed DQ Alpha testing on sperm\nfound in the blue condom. DQ Alpha testing is a relatively\ninexact form of DNA testing that can clear some wrongly\naccused individuals, but generally cannot narrow the\nperpetrator down to less than 5% of the population. See\nDept. of Justice, National Comm’n on the Future of DNA\nEvidence, The Future of Forensic DNA Testing 17 (NCJ\n183697, 2000) (hereinafter Future of Forensic DNA Test\ning); Dept. of Justice, National Comm’n on the Future of\nDNA Evidence, Postconviction DNA Testing: Recommen\ndations for Handling Requests 27 (NCJ 177626, 1999)\n(hereinafter Postconviction DNA Testing). The semen\nfound on the condom had a genotype that matched a blood\nsample taken from Osborne, but not ones from Jackson,\nK. G., or a third suspect named James Hunter. Osborne is\n4    DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                   DIST. v.

In other words, the test\ning ruled out Jackson and Hunter as possible sources of\nthe semen, and also ruled out over 80% of other black\nindividuals. The State also examined some pubic hairs\nfound at the scene of the crime, which were not susceptible\nto DQ Alpha testing, but which state witnesses attested to\nbe similar to Osborne’s. App. to Pet. for Cert. 117a.\n                               B\n   Osborne and Jackson were convicted by an Alaska jury\nof kidnaping, assault, and sexual assault. They were\nacquitted of an additional count of sexual assault and of\nattempted murder. Finding it “ ‘nearly miraculous’ ” that\nK. G. had survived, the trial judge sentenced Osborne to\n26 years in prison, with 5 suspended. Id., at 128a. His\nconviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal. Id., at\n113a–130a.\n   Osborne then sought postconviction relief in Alaska\nstate court. He claimed that he had asked his attorney,\nSidney Billingslea, to seek more discriminating restric\ntion-fragment-length-polymorphism (RFLP) DNA testing\nduring trial, and argued that she was constitutionally\nineffective for not doing so.1 Billingslea testified that after\ninvestigation, she had concluded that further testing\nwould do more harm than good. She planned to mount a\ndefense of mistaken identity, and thought that the impre\ncision of the DQ Alpha test gave her “ ‘very good numbers\nin a mistaken identity, cross-racial identification case,\nwhere the victim was in the dark and had bad eyesight.’ ”\n——————\n  1 RFLP testing, unlike DQ Alpha testing, “has a high degree of dis\n\ncrimination,” although it is sometimes ineffective on small samples.\nPostconviction DNA Testing 26–27; Future of Forensic DNA Testing\n14–16. Billingslea testified that she had no memory of Osborne making\nsuch a request, but said she was “ ‘willing to accept’ ” that he had.\nOsborne I, 110 P. 3d 986, 990 (Alaska App. 2005).\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

DNA\ntest would have served to prove that Osborne committed\nthe alleged crimes.’ ” Ibid. The Alaska Court of Appeals\nconcluded that Billingslea’s decision had been strategic\nand rejected Osborne’s claim. Id., at 991–992.\n  In this proceeding, Osborne also sought the DNA testing\nthat Billingslea had failed to perform, relying on an\nAlaska postconviction statute, Alaska Stat. §12.72 (2008),\nand the State and Federal Constitutions. In two decisions,\nthe Alaska Court of Appeals concluded that Osborne had\nno right to the RFLP test. According to the court, §12.72\n“apparently” did not apply to DNA testing that had been\navailable at trial.2 Osborne I, 110 P. 3d, at 992–993. The\ncourt found no basis in our precedents for recognizing a\nfederal constitutional right to DNA evidence. Id., at 993.\nAfter a remand for further findings, the Alaska Court of\nAppeals concluded that Osborne could not claim a state\nconstitutional right either, because the other evidence of\nhis guilt was too strong and RFLP testing was not likely to\nbe conclusive. Osborne II, 163 P. 3d, at 979–981. Two of\nthe three judges wrote separately to say that “[i]f Osborne\ncould show that he were in fact innocent, it would be\nunconscionable to punish him,” and that doing so might\nviolate the Alaska Constitution. Id., at 984–985 (Mann\nheimer, J., concurring).\n  The court relied heavily on the fact that Osborne had\nconfessed to some of his crimes in a 2004 application for\nparole—in which it is a crime to lie. Id., at 978–979, 981\n(majority opinion) (citing Alaska Stat. §11.56.210 (2002)).\nIn this statement, Osborne acknowledged forcing K.

He repeated this\nconfession before the parole board. Despite this accep\ntance of responsibility, the board did not grant him discre\ntionary parole. App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a. In 2007, he was\nreleased on mandatory parole, but he has since been rear\nrested for another offense, and the State has petitioned to\nrevoke this parole. Brief for Petitioners 7, n. 3.\n   Meanwhile, Osborne had also been active in federal\ncourt, suing state officials under 42 U. S. C. §1983. He\nclaimed that the Due Process Clause and other constitu\ntional provisions gave him a constitutional right to access\nthe DNA evidence for what is known as short-tandem\nrepeat (STR) testing (at his own expense). App. 24. This\nform of testing is more discriminating than the DQ Alpha\nor RFLP methods available at the time of Osborne’s trial.3\nThe District Court first dismissed the claim under Heck v.\nHumphrey, 512 U. S. 477 (1994), holding it “inescapable”\nthat Osborne sought to “set the stage” for an attack on his\nconviction, and therefore “must proceed through a writ of\nhabeas corpus.” App. 207 (internal quotation marks omit\nted). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit reversed, concluding that §1983 was the proper\nvehicle for Osborne’s claims, while “express[ing] no opin\nion as to whether Osborne ha[d] been deprived of a feder\nally protected right.” 423 F. 3d, at 1056.\n   On cross-motions for summary judgment after remand,\n\n——————\n  3 STR testing is extremely discriminating, can be used on small sam\n\nples, and is “rapidly becoming the standard.” Future of Forensic DNA\nTesting 18, n. 9. Osborne also sought to subject the pubic hairs to\nmitochondrial DNA testing, a secondary testing method often used\nwhen a sample cannot be subjected to other tests. See Postconviction\nDNA Testing 28. He argues that “[a]ll of the same arguments that\nsupport access to the condom for STR testing support access to the\nhairs for mitochondrial testing as well,” Brief for Respondent 11, n. 4,\nand we treat the claim accordingly.\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

Supp.\n2d 1079, 1081 (2006). The court relied on several factors:\nthat the testing Osborne sought had been unavailable at\ntrial, that the testing could be accomplished at almost no\ncost to the State, and that the results were likely to be\nmaterial. Id., at 1081–1082. It therefore granted sum\nmary judgment in favor of Osborne.\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed, relying on the prosecuto\nrial duty to disclose exculpatory evidence recognized in\nPennsylvania v. Ritchie, 480 U. S. 39 (1987), and Brady v.\nMaryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). While acknowledging that\nour precedents “involved only the right to pre-trial disclo\nsure,” the court concluded that the Due Process Clause\nalso “extends the government’s duty to disclose (or the\ndefendant’s right of access) to post-conviction proceedings.”\n521 F. 3d, at 1128. Although Osborne’s trial and appeals\nwere over, the court noted that he had a “potentially vi\nable” state constitutional claim of “actual innocence,” id.,\nat 1130, and relied on the “well-established assumption”\nthat a similar claim arose under the Federal Constitution,\nid., at 1131; cf. Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390 (1993).\nThe court held that these potential claims extended some\nof the State’s Brady obligations to the postconviction\ncontext.\n   The court declined to decide the details of what showing\nmust be made to access the evidence because it found\n“Osborne’s case for disclosure . . . so strong on the facts”\nthat “[w]herever the bar is, he crosses it.” 521 F. 3d, at\n1134. While acknowledging that Osborne’s prior confes\nsions were “certainly relevant,” the court concluded that\nthey did not “necessarily trum[p] . . . the right to obtain\npost-conviction access to evidence” in light of the “emerg\ning reality of wrongful convictions based on false confes\nsions.” Id., at 1140.\n8    DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                   DIST. v.

Since its first use in crimi\nnal investigations in the mid-1980s, there have been\nseveral major advances in DNA technology, culminating in\nSTR technology. It is now often possible to determine\nwhether a biological tissue matches a suspect with near\ncertainty. While of course many criminal trials proceed\nwithout any forensic and scientific testing at all, there is\nno technology comparable to DNA testing for matching\ntissues when such evidence is at issue.

Where there is enough other incriminating\nevidence and an explanation for the DNA result, science\nalone cannot prove a prisoner innocent. See House v. Bell,\n547 U. S. 518, 540–548 (2006). The availability of tech\nnologies not available at trial cannot mean that every\ncriminal conviction, or even every criminal conviction\ninvolving biological evidence, is suddenly in doubt. The\ndilemma is how to harness DNA’s power to prove inno\ncence without unnecessarily overthrowing the established\nsystem of criminal justice.\n   That task belongs primarily to the legislature. “[T]he\nStates are currently engaged in serious, thoughtful ex\naminations,” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 719\n(1997), of how to ensure the fair and effective use of this\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntesting within the existing criminal justice framework.\nForty-six States have already enacted statutes dealing\nspecifically with access to DNA evidence. See generally\nBrief for State of California et al. as Amici Curiae 3–13;\nGarrett, Claiming Innocence, 92 Minn. L. Rev 1629, 1719\n(2008) (surveying state statutes); see also An Act to Im\nprove the Preservation and Accessibility of Biological\nEvidence, Mississippi S. 2709 (enacted March 16, 2009);\nAn Act to Provide for DNA Testing for Certain Inmates for\nthe Purposes of Determining Whether They May Have\nBeen Wrongfully Convicted, South Dakota H. 1166 (en\nacted March 11, 2009). The State of Alaska itself is con\nsidering joining them. See An Act Relating to Post\nconviction DNA Testing, H. 174, 26th Leg., 1st Sess.\n(2009) (proposed legislation similar to that enacted by the\nStates). The Federal Government has also passed the\nInnocence Protection Act of 2004, §411, 118 Stat. 2278,\ncodified in part at 18 U. S. C. §3600, which allows federal\nprisoners to move for court-ordered DNA testing under\ncertain specified conditions. That Act also grants money\nto States that enact comparable statutes, §413, 118 Stat.\n2285, note following 42 U. S. C. §14136, and as a conse\nquence has served as a model for some state legislation.\nAt oral argument, Osborne agreed that the federal statute\nis a model for how States ought to handle the issue. Tr. of\nOral Arg. 33, 38–39; see also Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 19–26 (defending constitutionality of Inno\ncence Protection Act).\n   These laws recognize the value of DNA evidence but also\nthe need for certain conditions on access to the State’s\nevidence. A requirement of demonstrating materiality is\ncommon, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §3600(a)(8), but it is not the only\none. The federal statute, for example, requires a sworn\nstatement that the applicant is innocent. §3600(a)(1).\nThis requirement is replicated in several state statutes.\nE.g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. §§1405(b)(1), (c)(1) (West Supp.\n10   DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                   DIST. v. OSBORNE\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n2009); Fla. Stat. §925.11(2)(a)(3) (2006); N. H. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. 651–D:2(I)(b) (2007); S. C. Code Ann. 17–28–40\n(Supp. 2008). States also impose a range of diligence\nrequirements. Several require the requested testing to\n“have been technologically impossible at trial.” Garrett,\nsupra, at 1681, and n. 242. Others deny testing to those\nwho declined testing at trial for tactical reasons. E.g.,\nUtah Code. Ann. §78B–9–301(4) (2008).\n   Alaska is one of a handful of States yet to enact legisla\ntion specifically addressing the issue of evidence requested\nfor DNA testing. But that does not mean that such evi\ndence is unavailable for those seeking to prove their inno\ncence. Instead, Alaska courts are addressing how to apply\nexisting laws for discovery and postconviction relief to this\nnovel technology. See Osborne I, 110 P. 3d, at 992–993;\nPatterson v. State, No. A–8814, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">573797</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *4\n(Alaska App., Mar. 8, 2006). The same is true with respect\nto other States that do not have DNA-specific statutes.\nE.g., Fagan v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1682169\"><a href=\"/opinion/1682169/fagan-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1159</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ala. Crim. App.\n2007). Cf. Mass. Rule Crim. Proc. 30(c)(4) (2009).\n   First, access to evidence is available under Alaska law\nfor those who seek to subject it to newly available DNA\ntesting that will prove them to be actually innocent.\nUnder the State’s general postconviction relief statute, a\nprisoner may challenge his conviction when “there exists\nevidence of material facts, not previously presented and\nheard by the court, that requires vacation of the conviction\nor sentence in the interest of justice.” Alaska Stat.\n§12.72.010(4) (2008). Such a claim is exempt from other\nwise applicable time limits if “newly discovered evidence,”\npursued with due diligence, “establishes by clear and\nconvincing evidence that the applicant is innocent.”\n§12.72.020(b)(2).\n   Both parties agree that under these provisions of §12.72,\n“a defendant is entitled to post-conviction relief if the\ndefendant presents newly discovered evidence that estab\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlishes by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant\nis innocent.” Osborne I, supra, at 992 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). If such a claim is brought, state law\npermits general discovery.          See Alaska Rule Crim.\nProc. 35.1(g). Alaska courts have explained that these\nprocedures are available to request DNA evidence for\nnewly available testing to establish actual innocence. See\nPatterson, supra, at *4 (“If Patterson had brought the\nDNA analysis request as part of his previous application\nfor [postconviction] relief . . . he would have been able to\nrequest production of evidence”).\n   In addition to this statutory procedure, the Alaska\nCourt of Appeals has invoked a widely accepted three-part\ntest to govern additional rights to DNA access under the\nState Constitution. Osborne II, 163 P. 3d, at 974–975.\nDrawing on the experience with DNA evidence of State\nSupreme Courts around the country, the Court of Appeals\nexplained that it was “reluctant to hold that Alaska law\noffers no remedy to defendants who could prove their\nfactual innocence.” Osborne I, 110 P. 3d, at 995; see id., at\n995, n. 27 (citing decisions from other state courts). It was\n“prepared to hold, however, that a defendant who seeks\npost-conviction DNA testing . . . must show (1) that the\nconviction rested primarily on eyewitness identification\nevidence, (2) that there was a demonstrable doubt con\ncerning the defendant’s identification as the perpetrator,\nand (3) that scientific testing would likely be conclusive on\nthis issue.” Id., at 995. Thus, the Alaska courts have\nsuggested that even those who do not get discovery under\nthe State’s criminal rules have available to them a safety\nvalve under the State Constitution.\n   This is the background against which the Federal Court\nof Appeals ordered the State to turn over the DNA evi\ndence in its possession, and it is our starting point in\nanalyzing Osborne’s constitutional claims.\n12   DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                   DIST. v. OSBORNE\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n                               III\n   The parties dispute whether Osborne has invoked the\nproper federal statute in bringing his claim. He sued\nunder the federal civil rights statute, 42 U. S. C. §1983,\nwhich gives a cause of action to those who challenge a\nState’s “deprivation of any rights . . . secured by the Con\nstitution.” The State insists that Osborne’s claim must be\nbrought under 28 U. S. C. §2254, which allows a prisoner\nto seek “a writ of habeas corpus . . . on the ground that he\nis in custody in violation of the Constitution.”\n   While Osborne’s claim falls within the literal terms of\n§1983, we have also recognized that §1983 must be read in\nharmony with the habeas statute. See Preiser v. Rodri\nguez, 411 U. S. 475, 500 (1973); Heck, 512 U. S., at 487.\n“Stripped to its essence,” the State says, “Osborne’s §1983\naction is nothing more than a request for evidence to\nsupport a hypothetical claim that he is actually inno\ncent. . . . [T]his hypothetical claim sounds at the core of\nhabeas corpus.” Brief for Petitioners 19.\n   Osborne responds that his claim does not sound in\nhabeas at all. Although invalidating his conviction is of\ncourse his ultimate goal, giving him the evidence he seeks\n“would not necessarily imply the invalidity of [his] con\nfinement.” Brief for Respondent 21. If he prevails, he\nwould receive only access to the DNA, and even if DNA\ntesting exonerates him, his conviction is not automatically\ninvalidated. He must bring an entirely separate suit or a\npetition for clemency to invalidate his conviction. If he\nwere proved innocent, the State might also release him on\nits own initiative, avoiding any need to pursue habeas at\nall.\n   Osborne also invokes our recent decision in Wilkinson v.\nDotson, 544 U. S. 74 (2005). There, we held that prisoners\nwho sought new hearings for parole eligibility and suit\nability need not proceed in habeas. We acknowledged that\nthe two plaintiffs “hope[d]” their suits would “help bring\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)             13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nabout earlier release,” id., at 78, but concluded that the\n§1983 suit would not accomplish that without further\nproceedings. “Because neither prisoner’s claim would\nnecessarily spell speedier release, neither l[ay] at the core\nof habeas corpus.” Id., at 82 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Every Court of Appeals to consider the question\nsince Dotson has decided that because access to DNA\nevidence similarly does not “necessarily spell speedier\nrelease,” ibid., it can be sought under §1983. See 423\nF. 3d, at 1055–1056; Savory v. Lyons, 469 F. 3d 667, 672\n(CA7 2006); McKithen v. Brown, 481 F. 3d 89, 103, and n.\n15 (CA2 2007). On the other hand, the State argues that\nDotson is distinguishable because the challenged proce\ndures in that case did not affect the ultimate “exercise of\ndiscretion by the parole board.” Brief for Petitioners 32.\nIt also maintains that Dotson does not set forth “the exclu\nsive test for whether a prisoner may proceed under §1983.”\nBrief for Petitioners 32.\n   While we granted certiorari on this question, our resolu\ntion of Osborne’s claims does not require us to resolve this\ndifficult issue. Accordingly, we will assume without decid\ning that the Court of Appeals was correct that Heck does\nnot bar Osborne’s §1983 claim. Even under this assump\ntion, it was wrong to find a due process violation.\n                               IV \n\n                                A\n\n   “No State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or\nproperty, without due process of law.” U. S. Const., Amdt.\n14, §1; accord Amdt. 5. This Clause imposes procedural\nlimitations on a State’s power to take away protected\nentitlements. See, e.g., Jones v. Flowers, 547 U. S. 220,\n226–239 (2006). Osborne argues that access to the State’s\nevidence is a “process” needed to vindicate his right to\nprove himself innocent and get out of jail. Process is not\nan end in itself, so a necessary premise of this argument is\n14   DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                   DIST. v. OSBORNE\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nthat he has an entitlement (what our precedents call a\n“liberty interest”) to prove his innocence even after a fair\ntrial has proved otherwise. We must first examine this\nasserted liberty interest to determine what process (if any)\nis due. See Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408\nU. S. 564, 570–571 (1972); Olim v. Wakinekona, 461 U. S.\n238, 250–251 (1983).\n   In identifying his potential liberty interest, Osborne\nfirst attempts to rely on the Governor’s constitutional\nauthority to “grant pardons, commutations, and re\nprieves.” Alaska Const., Art. III, §21. That claim can be\nreadily disposed of. We have held that noncapital defen\ndants do not have a liberty interest in traditional state\nexecutive clemency, to which no particular claimant is\nentitled as a matter of state law. Connecticut Bd. of Par\ndons v. Dumschat, 452 U. S. 458, 464 (1981). Osborne\ntherefore cannot challenge the constitutionality of any\nprocedures available to vindicate an interest in state\nclemency.\n   Osborne does, however, have a liberty interest in dem\nonstrating his innocence with new evidence under state\nlaw. As explained, Alaska law provides that those who\nuse “newly discovered evidence” to “establis[h] by clear\nand convincing evidence that [they are] innocent” may\nobtain “vacation of [their] conviction or sentence in the\ninterest of justice.”      Alaska Stat. §§12.72.020(b)(2),\n12.72.010(4). This “state-created right can, in some cir\ncumstances, beget yet other rights to procedures essential\nto the realization of the parent right.” Dumschat, supra,\nat 463; see also Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539, 556–\n558 (1974).\n   The Court of Appeals went too far, however, in conclud\ning that the Due Process Clause requires that certain\nfamiliar preconviction trial rights be extended to protect\nOsborne’s postconviction liberty interest. After identifying\nOsborne’s possible liberty interests, the court concluded\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the State had an obligation to comply with the princi\nples of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83. In that case, we\nheld that due process requires a prosecutor to disclose\nmaterial exculpatory evidence to the defendant before\ntrial. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that nothing in\nour precedents suggested that this disclosure obligation\ncontinued after the defendant was convicted and the case\nwas closed, 521 F. 3d, at 1128, but it relied on prior Ninth\nCircuit precedent applying “Brady as a post-conviction\nright,” id., at 1128–1129 (citing Thomas v. Goldsmith, 979\nF. 2d 746, 749–750 (1992)). Osborne does not claim that\nBrady controls this case, Brief for Respondent 39–40, and\nwith good reason.\n   A criminal defendant proved guilty after a fair trial does\nnot have the same liberty interests as a free man. At trial,\nthe defendant is presumed innocent and may demand that\nthe government prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.\nBut “[o]nce a defendant has been afforded a fair trial and\nconvicted of the offense for which he was charged, the\npresumption of innocence disappears.” Herrera v. Collins,\n506 U. S. 390, 399 (1993). “Given a valid conviction, the\ncriminal defendant has been constitutionally deprived of\nhis liberty.” Dumschat, supra, at 464 (internal quotation\nmarks and alterations omitted).\n   The State accordingly has more flexibility in deciding\nwhat procedures are needed in the context of postconvic\ntion relief. “[W]hen a State chooses to offer help to those\nseeking relief from convictions,” due process does not\n“dictat[e] the exact form such assistance must assume.”\nPennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551, 559 (1987). Os\nborne’s right to due process is not parallel to a trial right,\nbut rather must be analyzed in light of the fact that he has\nalready been found guilty at a fair trial, and has only a\nlimited interest in postconviction relief. Brady is the\nwrong framework.\n   Instead, the question is whether consideration of Os\n16   DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                   DIST. v. OSBORNE\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nborne’s claim within the framework of the State’s proce\ndures for postconviction relief “offends some principle of\njustice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our\npeople as to be ranked as fundamental,” or “transgresses\nany recognized principle of fundamental fairness in opera\ntion.” Medina v. California, 505 U. S. 437, 446, 448 (1992)\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see Herrera, supra, at\n407–408 (applying Medina to postconviction relief for\nactual innocence); Finley, supra, at 556 (postconviction\nrelief procedures are constitutional if they “compor[t] with\nfundamental fairness”). Federal courts may upset a\nState’s postconviction relief procedures only if they are\nfundamentally inadequate to vindicate the substantive\nrights provided.\n   We see nothing inadequate about the procedures Alaska\nhas provided to vindicate its state right to postconviction\nrelief in general, and nothing inadequate about how those\nprocedures apply to those who seek access to DNA evi\ndence. Alaska provides a substantive right to be released\non a sufficiently compelling showing of new evidence that\nestablishes innocence. It exempts such claims from oth\nerwise applicable time limits. The State provides for\ndiscovery in postconviction proceedings, and has—through\njudicial decision—specified that this discovery procedure\nis available to those seeking access to DNA evidence.\nPatterson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">573797</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4. These procedures are\nnot without limits. The evidence must indeed be newly\navailable to qualify under Alaska’s statute, must have\nbeen diligently pursued, and must also be sufficiently\nmaterial. These procedures are similar to those provided\nfor DNA evidence by federal law and the law of other\nStates, see, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §3600(a), and they are not\ninconsistent with the “traditions and conscience of our\npeople” or with “any recognized principle of fundamental\nfairness.” Medina, supra, at 446, 448 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   And there is more. While the Alaska courts have not\nhad occasion to conclusively decide the question, the\nAlaska Court of Appeals has suggested that the State\nConstitution provides an additional right of access to\nDNA. In expressing its “reluctan[ce] to hold that Alaska\nlaw offers no remedy” to those who belatedly seek DNA\ntesting, and in invoking the three-part test used by other\nstate courts, the court indicated that in an appropriate\ncase the State Constitution may provide a failsafe even for\nthose who cannot satisfy the statutory requirements under\ngeneral postconviction procedures. Osborne I, 110 P. 3d,\nat 995–996.\n   To the degree there is some uncertainty in the details of\nAlaska’s newly developing procedures for obtaining post\nconviction access to DNA, we can hardly fault the State for\nthat. Osborne has brought this §1983 action without ever\nusing these procedures in filing a state or federal habeas\nclaim relying on actual innocence. In other words, he has\nnot tried to use the process provided to him by the State or\nattempted to vindicate the liberty interest that is now the\ncenterpiece of his claim. When Osborne did request DNA\ntesting in state court, he sought RFLP testing that had\nbeen available at trial, not the STR testing he now seeks,\nand the state court relied on that fact in denying him\ntesting under Alaska law. Osborne I, supra, at 992 (“[T]he\nDNA testing that Osborne proposes to perform on this\nevidence existed at the time of Osborne’s trial”); Osborne\nII, 163 P. 3d, at 984 (Mannheimer, J., concurring) (“[T]he\nDNA testing [Osborne] proposes would not yield ‘new\nevidence’ for purposes of . . . [Alaska Stat. §12.72.010]”\nbecause it was “available at the time of Osborne’s trial”).\n   His attempt to sidestep state process through a new\nfederal lawsuit puts Osborne in a very awkward position.\nIf he simply seeks the DNA through the State’s discovery\nprocedures, he might well get it. If he does not, it may be\nfor a perfectly adequate reason, just as the federal statute\n18   DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                   DIST. v. OSBORNE\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nand all state statutes impose conditions and limits on\naccess to DNA evidence. It is difficult to criticize the\nState’s procedures when Osborne has not invoked them.\nThis is not to say that Osborne must exhaust state-law\nremedies. See Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla., 457 U. S.\n496, 500–501 (1982). But it is Osborne’s burden to dem\nonstrate the inadequacy of the state-law procedures avail\nable to him in state postconviction relief. Cf. Medina,\nsupra, at 453. These procedures are adequate on their\nface, and without trying them, Osborne can hardly com\nplain that they do not work in practice.\n  As a fallback, Osborne also obliquely relies on an as\nserted federal constitutional right to be released upon\nproof of “actual innocence.” Whether such a federal right\nexists is an open question. We have struggled with it over\nthe years, in some cases assuming, arguendo, that it exists\nwhile also noting the difficult questions such a right would\npose and the high standard any claimant would have to\nmeet. House, 547 U. S., at 554–555; Herrera, 506 U. S., at\n398–417; see also id., at 419–421 (O’Connor, J., concur\nring); id., at 427–428 (SCALIA, J., concurring); Friendly, Is\nInnocence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack on Criminal\nJudgments, 38 U. Chi. L. Rev. 142, 159, n. 87 (1970). In\nthis case too we can assume without deciding that such a\nclaim exists, because even if so there is no due process\nproblem. Osborne does not dispute that a federal actual\ninnocence claim (as opposed to a DNA access claim) would\nbe brought in habeas. Brief for Respondent 22–24. If such\na habeas claim is viable, federal procedural rules permit\ndiscovery “for good cause.” 28 U. S. C. §2254 Rule 6; Bracy\nv. Gramley, 520 U. S. 899, 908–909 (1997). Just as with\nstate law, Osborne cannot show that available discovery is\nfacially inadequate, and cannot show that it would be\narbitrarily denied to him.\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009) \n         19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              B\n\n   The Court of Appeals below relied only on procedural\ndue process, but Osborne seeks to defend the judgment on\nthe basis of substantive due process as well. He asks that\nwe recognize a freestanding right to DNA evidence\nuntethered from the liberty interests he hopes to vindicate\nwith it. We reject the invitation and conclude, in the\ncircumstances of this case, that there is no such substan\ntive due process right. “As a general matter, the Court\nhas always been reluctant to expand the concept of sub\nstantive due process because guideposts for responsible\ndecisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce and\nopen-ended.” Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125\n(1992). Osborne seeks access to state evidence so that he\ncan apply new DNA-testing technology that might prove\nhim innocent. There is no long history of such a right, and\n“[t]he mere novelty of such a claim is reason enough to\ndoubt that ‘substantive due process’ sustains it.” Reno v.\nFlores, 507 U. S. 292, 303 (1993).\n   And there are further reasons to doubt. The elected\ngovernments of the States are actively confronting the\nchallenges DNA technology poses to our criminal justice\nsystems and our traditional notions of finality, as well as\nthe opportunities it affords. To suddenly constitutionalize\nthis area would short-circuit what looks to be a prompt\nand considered legislative response. The first DNA testing\nstatutes were passed in 1994 and 1997. Act of Aug. 2,\n1994, ch. 737, 1994 N. Y. Laws 3709 (codified at N. Y.\nCrim. Proc. Law Ann. §440.30(1–a) (West)); Act of May 9,\n1997, Pub. Act No. 90–141, 1997 Ill. Laws 2461 (codified at\n725 Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 725, §5/116–3(a) (West)). In the\npast decade, 44 States and the Federal Government have\nfollowed suit, reflecting the increased availability of DNA\ntesting. As noted, Alaska itself is considering such legisla\ntion. See supra, at 9. “By extending constitutional protec\ntion to an asserted right or liberty interest, we, to a great\nextent, place the matter outside the arena of public debate\n20    DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                    DIST. v. OSBORNE\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nand legislative action. We must therefore exercise the\nutmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground\nin this field.” Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 720 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). “[J]udicial imposition of a\ncategorical remedy . . . might pretermit other responsible\nsolutions being considered in Congress and state legisla\ntures.” Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U. S. 1, 14 (1989)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment). If we extended\nsubstantive due process to this area, we would cast these\nstatutes into constitutional doubt and be forced to take\nover the issue of DNA access ourselves. We are reluctant\nto enlist the Federal Judiciary in creating a new constitu\ntional code of rules for handling DNA.4\n   Establishing a freestanding right to access DNA evi\ndence for testing would force us to act as policymakers,\nand our substantive-due-process rulemaking authority\nwould not only have to cover the right of access but a\nmyriad of other issues. We would soon have to decide if\nthere is a constitutional obligation to preserve forensic\nevidence that might later be tested. Cf. Arizona v.\nYoungblood, 488 U. S. 51, 56–58 (1988). If so, for how\nlong? Would it be different for different types of evidence?\nWould the State also have some obligation to gather such\nevidence in the first place? How much, and when? No\ndoubt there would be a miscellany of other minor direc\ntives. See, e.g., Harvey v. Horan, 285 F. 3d 298, 300–301\n(CA4 2002) (Wilkinson, C. J., concurring in denial of\nrehearing).\n——————\n  4 The  dissent asserts that our position “resembles” Justice Harlan’s\ndissent in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). Post, at 15–16,\nn. 10 (opinion of STEVENS, J.). Miranda devised rules to safeguard a\nconstitutional right the Court had already recognized. Indeed, the\nunderlying requirement at issue in that case that confessions be volun\ntary had “roots” going back centuries. Dickerson v. United States, 530\nU. S. 428, 432–433 (2000). In contrast, the asserted right to access\nDNA evidence is unrooted in history or tradition, and would thrust the\nFederal Judiciary into an area previously left to state courts and\nlegislatures.\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  In this case, the evidence has already been gathered and\npreserved, but if we extend substantive due process to this\narea, these questions would be before us in short order,\nand it is hard to imagine what tools federal courts would\nuse to answer them. At the end of the day, there is no\nreason to suppose that their answers to these questions\nwould be any better than those of state courts and legisla\ntures, and good reason to suspect the opposite. See\nCollins, supra, at 125; Glucksberg, supra, at 720.\n                         *     *    *\n   DNA evidence will undoubtedly lead to changes in the\ncriminal justice system. It has done so already. The\nquestion is whether further change will primarily be made\nby legislative revision and judicial interpretation of the\nexisting system, or whether the Federal Judiciary must\nleap ahead—revising (or even discarding) the system by\ncreating a new constitutional right and taking over re\nsponsibility for refining it.\n   Federal courts should not presume that state criminal\nprocedures will be inadequate to deal with technological\nchange. The criminal justice system has historically\naccommodated new types of evidence, and is a time-tested\nmeans of carrying out society’s interest in convicting the\nguilty while respecting individual rights. That system,\nlike any human endeavor, cannot be perfect. DNA evi\ndence shows that it has not been. But there is no basis for\nOsborne’s approach of assuming that because DNA has\nshown that these procedures are not flawless, DNA evi\ndence must be treated as categorically outside the process,\nrather than within it. That is precisely what his §1983\nsuit seeks to do, and that is the contention we reject.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

Defense\ncounsel explained that this decision was made based on\nfear that the testing would provide further evidence of\nrespondent’s guilt. After conviction, in an unsuccessful\nattempt to obtain parole, respondent confessed in detail to\nthe crime. Now, respondent claims that he has a federal\nconstitutional right to test the sample and that he can go\ndirectly to federal court to obtain this relief without giving\nthe Alaska courts a full opportunity to consider his claim.\n   I agree with the Court’s resolution of respondent’s con\nstitutional claim. In my view, that claim also fails for two\nindependent reasons beyond those given by the majority.\nFirst, a state prisoner asserting a federal constitutional\nright to perform such testing must file a petition for a writ\nof habeas corpus, not an action under 42 U. S. C. §1983, as\nrespondent did here, and thus must exhaust state reme\ndies, see 28 U. S. C. §2254(b)(1)(A). Second, even though\nrespondent did not exhaust his state remedies, his claim\nmay be rejected on the merits, see §2254(b)(2), because a\n2    DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                   DIST. v. OSBORNE\n                   ALITO, J., concurring\n\ndefendant who declines the opportunity to perform DNA\ntesting at trial for tactical reasons has no constitutional\nright to perform such testing after conviction.\n                              I\n   As our prior opinions illustrate, it is sometimes difficult\nto draw the line between claims that are properly brought\nin habeas and those that may be brought under 42 U. S. C.\n§1983. See Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475 (1973);\nHeck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477 (1994); Wilkinson v.\nDotson, 544 U. S. 74 (2005). But I think that this case\nfalls on the habeas side of the line.\n   We have long recognized the principles of federalism\nand comity at stake when state prisoners attempt to use\nthe federal courts to attack their final convictions. See,\ne.g., Darr v. Burford, 339 U. S. 200, 204 (1950); Braden v.\n30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky., 410 U. S. 484, 490–491\n(1973); Preiser, supra, at 491–492; Rose v. Lundy, 455\nU. S. 509, 518–519 (1982); Rhines v. Weber, 544 U. S. 269,\n273–274 (2005). We accordingly held that “ ‘it would be\nunseemly in our dual system of government for a federal\ndistrict court to upset a state court conviction without an\nopportunity to the state courts to correct a constitutional\nviolation.’ ” Lundy, supra, at 518 (quoting Darr, supra, at\n204). Congress subsequently codified Lundy’s exhaustion\nrequirement in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. §2254(b)(1)(A).\n   We also have long recognized the need to impose sharp\nlimits on state prisoners’ efforts to bypass state courts\nwith their discovery requests. See, e.g., Wainwright v.\nSykes, 433 U. S. 72, 87–90 (1977); Keeney v. Tamayo-\nReyes, 504 U. S. 1, 8–10 (1992); Williams v. Taylor, 529\nU. S. 420, 436 (2000). For example, we have held that\n“concerns of finality, comity, judicial economy, and chan\nneling the resolution of claims into the most appropriate\nforum” require a state prisoner to show “cause-and\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nprejudice” before asking a federal habeas court to hold an\nevidentiary hearing. Keeney, supra, at 8. That result\nreduces opportunities for “ ‘sandbagging’ on the part of\ndefense lawyers,” Sykes, supra, at 89, and it “reduces the\n‘inevitable friction’ that results when a federal habeas\ncourt ‘overturns either the factual or legal conclusions\nreached by the state-court system,’ ” Keeney, supra, at 9\n(quoting Sumner v. Mata, 449 U. S. 539, 550 (1981); brack\nets omitted). Congress subsequently codified Keeney’s\ncause-and-prejudice rule in AEDPA, 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(e)(2).\n   The rules set forth in our cases and codified in AEDPA\nwould mean very little if state prisoners could simply\nevade them through artful pleading. For example, I take\nit as common ground that a state prisoner’s claim under\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), must be brought\nin habeas because that claim, if proved, would invalidate\nthe judgment of conviction or sentence (and thus the\nlawfulness of the inmate’s confinement). See Heck, supra,\nat 481. But under respondent’s view, I see no reason why\na Brady claimant could not bypass the state courts and file\na §1983 claim in federal court, contending that he has a\ndue process right to search the State’s files for exculpatory\nevidence. Allowing such a maneuver would violate the\nprinciples embodied in Lundy, Keeney, and AEDPA.\n   Although respondent has now recharacterized his claim\nin an effort to escape the requirement of proceeding in\nhabeas, in his complaint he squarely alleged that the\nState “deprived [him] of access to exculpatory evidence in\nviolation of Brady[, supra], and the Due Process Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution.”\nApp. 37. That allegedly “exculpatory” evidence—which\nBrady defines as “evidence favorable to [the] accused” and\n“material either to guilt or to punishment,” 373 U. S., at\n87—would, by definition, undermine respondent’s “guilt”\nor “punishment” if his allegations are true. Such claims\n4       DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                      DIST. v. OSBORNE\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\nshould be brought in habeas, see Heck, supra, at 481, and\nrespondent cannot avoid that result by attempting to\nbring his claim under §1983, see Dotson, supra, at 92\n(KENNEDY, J., dissenting).1\n  It is no answer to say, as respondent does, that he sim\nply wants to use §1983 as a discovery tool to lay the foun\ndation for a future state postconviction application, a state\nclemency petition, or a request for relief by means of\n“prosecutorial consent.” See Brief for Respondent 23.\nSuch tactics implicate precisely the same federalism and\ncomity concerns that motivated our decisions (and Con\ngress’) to impose exhaustion requirements and discovery\nlimits in federal habeas proceedings. If a petitioner can\nevade the habeas statute’s exhaustion requirements in\nthis way, I see no reason why a state prisoner asserting an\nordinary Brady claim—i.e., a state prisoner who claims\nthat the prosecution failed to turn over exculpatory evi\ndence prior to trial—could not follow the same course.\n  What respondent seeks was accurately described in his\ncomplaint—the discovery of evidence that has a material\nbearing on his conviction. Such a claim falls within “the\ncore” of habeas. Preiser, supra, at 489. Recognition of a\nconstitutional right to postconviction scientific testing of\nevidence in the possession of the prosecution would repre\nsent an expansion of Brady and a broadening of the dis\ncovery rights now available to habeas petitioners. See 28\n——————\n    1 This\n         case is quite different from Dotson. In that case, two state\nprisoners filed §1983 actions challenging the constitutionality of Ohio’s\nparole procedures and seeking “a new parole hearing that may or may\nnot result in release, prescription of the composition of the hearing\npanel, and specification of the procedures to be followed.” 544 U. S., at\n86 (SCALIA, J., concurring). Regardless of whether such remedies fall\noutside the authority of federal habeas judges, compare id., at 86–87,\nwith id., at 88–92 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting), there is no question that\nthe relief respondent seeks in this case—“exculpatory” evidence that\ntends to prove his innocence—lies “within the core of habeas corpus,”\nPreiser v.

We have never previously held that\na state prisoner may seek discovery by means of a §1983\naction, and we should not take that step here. I would\nhold that respondent’s claim (like all other Brady claims)\nshould be brought in habeas.\n                              II\n   The principles of federalism, comity, and finality are not\nthe only ones at stake for the State in cases like this one.\nTo the contrary, DNA evidence creates special opportuni\nties, risks, and burdens that implicate important state\ninterests. Given those interests—and especially in light of\nthe rapidly evolving nature of DNA testing technology—\nthis is an area that should be (and is being) explored\n“through the workings of normal democratic processes in\nthe laboratories of the States.” Atkins, supra, at 326\n(Rehnquist, C.

First, DNA testing—\neven when performed with modern STR technology, and\neven when performed in perfect accordance with proto\ncols—often fails to provide “absolute proof” of anything.\nPost, at 12 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). As one scholar has\nobserved:\n    “[F]orensic DNA testing rarely occurs [under] idyllic\n    conditions. Crime scene DNA samples do not come\n    from a single source obtained in immaculate condi\n    tions; they are messy assortments of multiple un\n    known persons, often collected in the most difficult\n    conditions. The samples can be of poor quality due to\n    exposure to heat, light, moisture, or other degrading\n    elements. They can be of minimal or insufficient\n    quantity, especially as investigators push DNA test\n    ing to its limits and seek profiles from a few cells re\n    trieved from cigarette butts, envelopes, or soda cans.\n    And most importantly, forensic samples often consti\n    tute a mixture of multiple persons, such that it is not\n    clear whose profile is whose, or even how many pro\n    files are in the sample at all. All of these factors make\n    DNA testing in the forensic context far more subjec\n    tive than simply reporting test results . . . .” Murphy,\n    The Art in the Science of DNA: A Layperson’s Guide\n    to the Subjectivity Inherent in Forensic DNA Typing,\n    58 Emory L. J. 489, 497 (2008) (footnotes omitted).\nSee also R. Michaelis, R. Flanders, & P. Wulff, A Litiga\ntor’s Guide to DNA 341 (2008) (hereinafter Michaelis)\n(noting that even “STR analyses are plagued by issues of\nsuboptimal samples, equipment malfunctions and human\nerror, just as any other type of forensic DNA test”); Harvey\nv. Horan, 278 F. 3d 370, 383, n. 4 (CA4 2002) (King, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment) (noting\nthat the first STR DNA test performed under Virginia’s\n8    DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                   DIST. v. OSBORNE\n                   ALITO, J., concurring\n\npostconviction DNA access statute was inconclusive).\nSuch concerns apply with particular force where, as here,\nthe sample is minuscule, it may contain three or more\npersons’ DNA, and it may have degraded significantly\nduring the 24 or more hours it took police to recover it.\n   Second, the State has important interests in maintain\ning the integrity of its evidence, and the risks associated\nwith evidence contamination increase every time someone\nattempts to extract new DNA from a sample. According to\nProfessor John Butler—who is said to have written “the\ncanonical text on forensic DNA typing,” Murphy, supra, at\n493, n. 16—“[t]he extraction process is probably where the\nDNA sample is more susceptible to contamination in the\nlaboratory than at any other time in the forensic DNA\nanalysis process,” J. Butler, Forensic DNA Typing 42 (2d\ned. 2005).\n   Indeed, modern DNA testing technology is so powerful\nthat it actually increases the risks associated with mis\nhandling evidence. STR tests, for example, are so sensi\ntive that they can detect DNA transferred from person X\nto a towel (with which he wipes his face), from the towel to\nY (who subsequently wipes his face), and from Y’s face to a\nmurder weapon later wielded by Z (who can use STR\ntechnology to blame X for the murder). See Michaelis 62–\n64; Thompson, Ford, Doom, Raymer, & Krane, Evaluating\nForensic DNA Evidence: Essential Elements of a Compe\ntent Defense Review (Part 2), The Champion, May 2003,\npp. 25–26. Any test that is sensitive enough to pick up\nsuch trace amounts of DNA will be able to detect even the\nslightest, unintentional mishandling of evidence. See\nMichaelis 63 (cautioning against mishandling evidence\nbecause “two research groups have already demonstrated\nthe ability to obtain STR profiles from fingerprints on\npaper or evidence objects”). And that is to say nothing of\nthe intentional DNA-evidence-tampering scandals that\nhave surfaced in recent years. See, e.g., Murphy, The New\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nForensics: Criminal Justice, False Certainty, and the\nSecond Generation of Scientific Evidence, 95 Calif. L. Rev.\n721, 772–773 (2007) (collecting examples). It gives short\nshrift to such risks to suggest that anyone—including\nrespondent, who has twice confessed to his crime, has\nnever recanted, and passed up the opportunity for DNA\ntesting at trial—should be given a never-before-recognized\nconstitutional right to rummage through the State’s ge\nnetic-evidence locker.\n   Third, even if every test was guaranteed to provide a\nconclusive answer, and even if no one ever contaminated a\nDNA sample, that still would not justify disregarding the\nother costs associated with the DNA-access regime pro\nposed by respondent. As the Court notes, recognizing a\nprisoner’s freestanding right to access the State’s DNA\nevidence would raise numerous policy questions, not the\nleast of which is whether and to what extent the State is\nconstitutionally obligated to collect and preserve such\nevidence. See ante, at 20. But the policy problems do not\nend there.\n   Even without our creation and imposition of a manda\ntory-DNA-access regime, state crime labs are already\nresponsible for maintaining and controlling hundreds of\nthousands of new DNA samples every year. For example,\nin the year 2005, the State of North Carolina processed\nDNA samples in approximately 1,900 cases, while the\nState of Virginia processed twice as many. See Office of\nState Budget and Management, Cost Study of DNA Test\ning and Analysis As Directed by Session Law 2005–267,\nSection 15.8, pp. 5, 8 (Mar. 1, 2006) (hereinafter North\nCarolina Study), http://www.osbm.state.nc.us/files/pdf_\nfiles/3-1-2006FinalDNAReport.pdf (all Internet materials\nas visited June 16, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court’s\ncase file); see also id., at 8 (noting that the State of Iowa\nprocessed DNA samples in 1,500 cases in that year). Each\ncase often entails many separate DNA samples. See\n10   DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                   DIST. v. OSBORNE\n                   ALITO, J., concurring\n\nWisconsin Criminal Justice Study Commission, Position\nPaper: “Decreasing the Turnaround Time for DNA Test\ning,” p. 2 (hereinafter Wisconsin Study), http://www.wcjsc.\norg/WCJSC_Report_on_DNA_Backlog.pdf (“An average\ncase consists of 8 samples”). And these data—which are\nnow four years out of date—dramatically underestimate\nthe States’ current DNA-related caseloads, which expand\nat an average annual rate of around 24%. See Wisconsin\nDept. of Justice, Review of State Crime Lab Resources for\nDNA Analysis 6 (Feb. 12, 2007), http://www.doj.state.\nwi.us/news/files/dnaanalysisplan.pdf.\n  The resources required to process and analyze these\nhundreds of thousands of samples have created severe\nbacklogs in state crime labs across the country. For ex\nample, the State of Wisconsin reports that it receives\nroughly 17,600 DNA samples per year, but its labs can\nprocess only 9,600. Wisconsin Study 2. Similarly, the\nState of North Carolina reports that “[i]t is not unusual for\nthe [State] Crime Lab to have several thousand samples\nwaiting to be outsourced due to the federal procedures for\n[the State’s] grant. This is not unique to North Carolina\nbut a national issue.” North Carolina Study 9.\n  The procedures that the state labs use to handle these\nhundreds of thousands of DNA samples provide fertile\nground for litigation. For example, in Commonwealth v.\nDuarte, 56 Mass. App. 714, 723, 780 N. E. 2d 99, 106\n(2002), the defendant argued that “the use of a thermome\nter that may have been overdue for a standardization\ncheck rendered the DNA analysis unreliable and inadmis\nsible” in his trial for raping a 13-year-old girl. The court\nrejected that argument and held “that the status of the\nthermometer went to the weight of the evidence, and not\nto its admissibility,” id., at 724, 780 N. E. 2d, at 106, and\nthe court ultimately upheld Duarte’s conviction after\nreviewing the testimony of the deputy director of the\nlaboratory that the Commonwealth used for the DNA\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\ntests, see ibid. But the case nevertheless illustrates “that\nno detail of laboratory operation, no matter how minute, is\nexempt as a potential point on which a defense attorney\nwill question the DNA evidence.” Michaelis 68; see also\nid., at 68–69 (discussing the policy implications of Duarte).\n   My point in recounting the burdens that postconviction\nDNA testing imposes on the Federal Government and the\nStates is not to denigrate the importance of such testing.\nInstead, my point is that requests for postconviction DNA\ntesting are not cost free. The Federal Government and the\nStates have a substantial interest in the implementation\nof rules that regulate such testing in a way that harnesses\nthe unique power of DNA testing while also respecting the\nimportant governmental interests noted above. The Fed\neral Government and the States have moved expeditiously\nto enact rules that attempt to perform this role. And as\nthe Court holds, it would be most unwise for this Court,\nwielding the blunt instrument of due process, to interfere\nprematurely with these efforts.\n                              B\n   I see no reason for such intervention in the present case.\nWhen a criminal defendant, for tactical purposes, passes\nup the opportunity for DNA testing at trial, that defen\ndant, in my judgment, has no constitutional right to de\nmand to perform DNA testing after conviction. Recogni\ntion of such a right would allow defendants to play games\nwith the criminal justice system. A guilty defendant could\nforgo DNA testing at trial for fear that the results would\nconfirm his guilt, and in the hope that the other evidence\nwould be insufficient to persuade the jury to find him\nguilty. Then, after conviction, with nothing to lose, the\ndefendant could demand DNA testing in the hope that\nsome happy accident—for example, degradation or con\ntamination of the evidence—would provide the basis for\nseeking postconviction relief.

At trial, respondent’s\nlawyer made an explicit, tactical decision to forgo restric\ntion-fragment-length-polymorphism (RFLP) testing in\nfavor of less-reliable DQ Alpha testing. Having forgone\nmore accurate DNA testing once before, respondent’s\nreasons for seeking it now are suspect. It is true that the\nSTR testing respondent now seeks is even more advanced\nthan the RFLP testing he declined—but his counsel did\nnot decline RFLP testing because she thought it was not\ngood enough; she declined because she thought it was too\ngood.

See\nVermont v. Brillon, 556 U.

For example, the federal\nstatute provides that a prisoner’s declination of DNA testing at trial\nbars a request for postconviction testing only if the prisoner knowingly\nand voluntarily waived that right in a proceeding occurring after the\nenactment of the federal statute. 18 U. S. C. §3600(a)(3)(A)(i). But\nAlaska has specifically decided to retain the general rule regarding the\nauthority of defense counsel. See Osborne I, supra, at 991–992 (citing\nSimeon v. State, 90 P. 3d 181, 184 (Alaska App. 2004)).\n   5 JUSTICE STEVENS is quite wrong to suggest that the application of\n\nthis familiar principle in the present context somehow lessens the\nprosecution’s burden to prove a defendant’s guilt.

Rather, he claims that he has a right to obtain\nevidence that may be useful to him in a variety of postconviction\nproceedings. The principle that the prosecution must prove its case\nbeyond a reasonable doubt and the principle that a defendant has no\nobligation to prove his innocence are not implicated in any way by the\nissues in this case.\n14   DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                   DIST. v.

If not, Osborne has needlessly spent decades\nbehind bars while the true culprit has not been brought to\njustice. The DNA test Osborne seeks is a simple one, its\ncost modest, and its results uniquely precise. Yet for\nreasons the State has been unable or unwilling to articu­\nlate, it refuses to allow Osborne to test the evidence at his\nown expense and to thereby ascertain the truth once and\nfor all.\n   On two equally problematic grounds, the Court today\nblesses the State’s arbitrary denial of the evidence Os­\nborne seeks. First, while acknowledging that Osborne\nmay have a due process right to access the evidence under\nAlaska’s postconviction procedures, the Court concludes\nthat Osborne has not yet availed himself of all possible\navenues for relief in state court.1 As both a legal and\n——————\n 1 Because   the Court assumes arguendo that Osborne’s claim was\n2     DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL \n\n                     DIST. v.

More\ntroubling still, based on a fundamental mischaracteriza­\ntion of the right to liberty that Osborne seeks to vindicate,\nthe Court refuses to acknowledge “in the circumstances of\nthis case” any right to access the evidence that is grounded\nin the Due Process Clause itself. Because I am convinced\nthat Osborne has a constitutional right of access to the\nevidence he wishes to test and that, on the facts of this\ncase, he has made a sufficient showing of entitlement to\nthat evidence, I would affirm the decision of the Court of\nAppeals.\n                              I\n  The Fourteenth Amendment provides that “[n]o State\nshall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,\nwithout due process of law.” §1. Our cases have fre­\nquently recognized that protected liberty interests may\narise “from the Constitution itself, by reason of guarantees\nimplicit in the word ‘liberty,’ . . . or it may arise from an\nexpectation or interest created by state laws or policies.”\nWilkinson v. Austin, 545 U. S. 209, 221 (2005). Osborne\ncontends that he possesses a right to access DNA evidence\narising from both these sources.\n  Osborne first anchors his due process right in Alaska\nStat. §12.72.010(4) (2008). Under that provision, a person\nwho has been “convicted of, or sentenced for, a crime may\ninstitute a proceeding for post-conviction relief if the\nperson claims . . . that there exists evidence of material\n——————\nproperly brought under 42 U.

The problem is that\nthe newly discovered evidence he wishes to present cannot\nbe generated unless he is first able to access the State’s\nevidence—something he cannot do without the State’s\nconsent or a court order.\n  Although States are under no obligation to provide\nmechanisms for postconviction relief, when they choose to\ndo so, the procedures they employ must comport with the\ndemands of the Due Process Clause, see Evitts v. Lucey,\n469 U. S. 387, 393 (1985), by providing litigants with fair\nopportunity to assert their state-created rights. Osborne\ncontends that by denying him an opportunity to access the\nphysical evidence, the State has denied him meaningful\naccess to state postconviction relief, thereby violating his\nright to due process.\n  Although the majority readily agrees that Osborne has a\nprotected liberty interest in demonstrating his innocence\nwith new evidence under Alaska Stat. §12.72.010(4), see\nante, at 14, it rejects the Ninth Circuit’s conclusion that\nOsborne is constitutionally entitled to access the State’s\nevidence.

Under that standard, Alaska’s procedures for\nbringing a claim under §12.72.010(4) will not be found to\nviolate due process unless they “ ‘offen[d] some principle of\njustice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our\npeople as to be ranked as fundamental,’ or ‘transgres[s]\nany recognized principle of fundamental fairness in opera­\ntion.’ ” Ante, at 16 (quoting Medina, 505 U. S., at 446,\n448).3 After conducting a cursory review of the relevant\nstatutory text, the Court concludes that Alaska’s proce­\ndures are constitutional on their face.\n   While I agree that the statute is not facially deficient,\nthe state courts’ application of §12.72.010(4) raises serious\nquestions whether the State’s procedures are fundamen­\ntally unfair in their operation. As an initial matter, it is\nnot clear that Alaskan courts ordinarily permit litigants to\nutilize the state postconviction statute to obtain new\nevidence in the form of DNA tests. The majority assumes\nthat such discovery is possible based on a single, unpub­\nlished, nonprecedential decision from the Alaska Court of\nAppeals, see ante, at 16 (citing Patterson v. State, No. A–\n8814 (Mar. 8, 2006)), but the State concedes that no liti­\ngant yet has obtained evidence for such testing under the\nstatute.4\n   Of even greater concern is the manner in which the\nstate courts applied §12.72.010(4) to the facts of this case.\n——————\n  3 Osborne contends that the Court should assess the validity of the\n\nState’s procedures under the test set forth in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424\nU. S. 319 (1976), rather than the more exacting test adopted by Medina\nv. California, 505 U. S. 437 (1992). In my view, we need not decide\nwhich standard governs because the state court’s denial of access to the\nevidence Osborne seeks violates due process under either standard. See\nHarvey, 285 F. 3d, at 315 (Luttig, J).\n  4 The State explained at oral argument that such testing was ordered\n\nin the Patterson case, but by the time access was granted, the relevant\nevidence had been destroyed.

See Osborne v. State,\n110 P. 3d 986, 992 (2005) (Osborne I). In his arguments\nbefore the state trial court and his briefs to the Alaska\nCourt of Appeals, however, Osborne had plainly requested\nSTR DNA testing, a form of DNA testing not yet in use at\nthe time of his trial. See App. 171, 175; see also 521 F. 3d\n1118, 1123, n. 2 (CA9 2008). The state appellate court’s\nconclusion that the requested testing had been available\nat the time of trial was therefore clearly erroneous.5\nGiven these facts, the majority’s assertion that Osborne\n“attempt[ed] to sidestep state process” by failing “to use\nthe process provided to him by the State” is unwarranted.\nAnte, at 17.\n   The same holds true with respect to the majority’s sug­\ngestion that the Alaska Constitution might provide addi­\ntional protections to Osborne above and beyond those\nafforded under afforded under §12.72.010(4). In Osborne’s\nstate postconviction proceedings, the Alaska Court of\nAppeals held out the possibility that even when evidence\ndoes not meet the requirements of §12.72.010(4), the State\nConstitution might offer relief to a defendant who is able\nto make certain threshold showings. See Osborne I, 110\nP. 3d, at 995–996.

The first two reasons\nreduce to an evaluation of the strength of the prosecution’s\noriginal case—a consideration that carries little weight\nwhen balanced against evidence as powerfully dispositive\nas an exculpatory DNA test. The final reason offered by\nthe state court—that further testing would not be conclu­\nsive on the issue of Osborne’s guilt or innocence—is surely\na relevant factor in deciding whether to release evidence\nfor DNA testing. Nevertheless, the state court’s conclu­\nsion that such testing would not be conclusive in this case\nis indefensible, as evidenced by the State’s recent conces­\nsion on that point.

He was rebuffed at every\nturn. The manner in which the Alaska courts applied\nstate law in this case leaves me in grave doubt about the\nadequacy of the procedural protections afforded to liti­\ngants under Alaska Stat. §12.72.010(4), and provides\nstrong reason to doubt the majority’s flippant assertion\nthat if Osborne were “simply [to] see[k] the DNA through\nthe State’s discovery procedures, he might well get it.”\nAnte, at 17.

Murphy, 532 U. S. 223, 228–229 (2001)\n(“[I]ncarceration does not divest prisoners of all constitu­\ntional protections”). Our cases have recognized protected\ninterests in a variety of postconviction contexts, extending\nsubstantive constitutional protections to state prisoners on\nthe premise that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment requires States to respect certain fundamen­\ntal liberties in the postconviction context. See, e.g.,\nThornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U. S. 401, 407 (1989) (right to\nfree speech); Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 84 (1987)\n(right to marry); Cruz v. Beto, 405 U. S. 319, 322 (1972)\n(per curiam) (right to free exercise of religion); Lee v.\nWashington, 390 U. S. 333 (1968) (per curiam) (right to be\nfree of racial discrimination); Johnson v. Avery, 393 U. S.\n483 (1969) (right to petition government for redress of\ngrievances). It is therefore far too late in the day to ques­\ntion the basic proposition that convicted persons such as\nOsborne retain a constitutionally protected measure of\ninterest in liberty, including the fundamental liberty of\nfreedom from physical restraint.\n   Recognition of this right draws strength from the fact\nthat 46 States and the Federal Government have passed\nstatutes providing access to evidence for DNA testing, and\n3 additional states (including Alaska) provide similar\naccess through court-made rules alone, see Brief for State\nof California et al. as Amici Curiae 3–4, n. 1, and 2; ante,\nat 9. These legislative developments are consistent with\nrecent trends in legal ethics recognizing that prosecutors\nare obliged to disclose all forms of exculpatory evidence\nthat come into their possession following conviction. See,\ne.g., ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct 3.8(g)–(h)\n(2008); see also Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 427, n.\n25 (1976) (“[A]fter a conviction the prosecutor also is\nbound by the ethics of his office to inform the appropriate\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

The fact\nthat nearly all the States have now recognized some post­\nconviction right to DNA evidence makes it more, not less,\nappropriate to recognize a limited federal right to such\nevidence in cases where litigants are unfairly barred from\nobtaining relief in state court.\n   Insofar as it is process Osborne seeks, he is surely enti­\ntled to less than “the full panoply of rights,” that would be\ndue a criminal defendant prior to conviction, see Morrissey\nv. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471, 480 (1972). That does not mean,\nhowever, that our pretrial due process cases have no rele­\nvance in the postconviction context. In Brady v. Mary\nland, 373 U. S. 83, 87 (1963), we held that the State vio­\nlates due process when it suppresses “evidence favorable\nto an accused” that is “material either to guilt or to pun­\nishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the\nprosecution.” Although Brady does not directly provide for\na postconviction right to such evidence, the concerns with\nfundamental fairness that motivated our decision in that\ncase are equally present when convicted persons such as\nOsborne seek access to dispositive DNA evidence following\nconviction.\n   Recent scientific advances in DNA analysis have made\n“it literally possible to confirm guilt or innocence beyond\nany question whatsoever, at least in some categories of\ncases.” Harvey, 285 F. 3d, at 305 (Luttig, J.). As the\nCourt recognizes today, the powerful new evidence that\nmodern DNA testing can provide is “unlike anything\nknown before.” Ante, at 8. Discussing these important\nforensic developments in his oft-cited opinion in Harvey,\nJudge Luttig explained that although “no one would con­\ntend that fairness, in the constitutional sense, requires a\npost-conviction right of access or a right to disclosure\nanything approaching in scope that which is required pre­\ntrial,” in cases “where the government holds previously­\n10   DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                    DIST. v.

It does so “out of recognition\nof the same systemic interests in fairness and ultimate\ntruth.” Ibid.\n   Observing that the DNA evidence in this case would be\nso probative of Osborne’s guilt or innocence that it exceeds\nthe materiality standard that governs the disclosure of\nevidence under Brady, the Ninth Circuit granted Os­\nborne’s request for access to the State’s evidence. See 521\nF. 3d, at 1134. In doing so, the Court of Appeals recog­\nnized that Osborne possesses a narrow right of postconvic­\ntion access to biological evidence for DNA testing “where\n[such] evidence was used to secure his conviction, the DNA\ntesting is to be conducted using methods that were un­\navailable at the time of trial and are far more precise than\nthe methods that were then available, such methods are\ncapable of conclusively determining whether Osborne is\nthe source of the genetic material, the testing can be con­\nducted without cost or prejudice to the State, and the\nevidence is material to available forms of post-conviction\nrelief.” Id., at 1142. That conclusion does not merit\nreversal.\n   If the right Osborne seeks to vindicate is framed as\npurely substantive, the proper result is no less clear. “The\ntouchstone of due process is protection of the individual\nagainst arbitrary action of government,” Meachum, 427\nU. S., at 226 (internal quotation marks omitted); Wolff,\n418 U. S., at 558; County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523\nU. S. 833, 845–846 (1998). When government action is so\nlacking in justification that it “can properly be character­\nized as arbitrary, or conscience shocking, in a constitu­\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

In my view, the\nState’s refusal to provide Osborne with access to evidence\nfor DNA testing qualifies as arbitrary.\n   Throughout the course of state and federal litigation,\nthe State has failed to provide any concrete reason for\ndenying Osborne the DNA testing he seeks, and none is\napparent. Because Osborne has offered to pay for the\ntests, cost is not a factor. And as the State now concedes,\nthere is no reason to doubt that such testing would provide\nconclusive confirmation of Osborne’s guilt or revelation of\nhis innocence.7 In the courts below, the State refused to\nprovide an explanation for its refusal to permit testing of\nthe evidence, see Brief for Respondent 33, and in this\nCourt, its explanation has been, at best, unclear. Insofar\nas the State has articulated any reason at all, it appears to\nbe a generalized interest in protecting the finality of the\njudgment of conviction from any possible future attacks.\nSee Brief for Petitioners 18, 50.8\n——————\n  7 JUSTICE ALITO provides a detailed discussion of dangers such as\n\nlaboratory contamination and evidence tampering that may reduce the\nreliability not only of DNA evidence, but of any type of physical forensic\nevidence. Ante, at 3–10 (concurring opinion). While no form of testing\nis error proof in every case, the degree to which DNA evidence has\nbecome a foundational tool of law enforcement and prosecution is\nindicative of the general reliability and probative power of such testing.\nThe fact that errors may occur in the testing process is not a ground for\nrefusing such testing altogether—were it so, such evidence should be\nbanned at trial no less than in postconviction proceedings. More\nimportant still is the fact that the State now concedes there is no\nreason to doubt that if STR and mtDNA testing yielded exculpatory\nresults in this case, Osborne’s innocence would be established.\n  8 In his concurring opinion, JUSTICE ALITO suggests other reasons that\n\nmight motivate States to resist access to such evidence, including\nconcerns over DNA testing backlogs and manipulation by defendants.\nSee ante, at 8–10. Not only were these reasons not offered by the State\nof Alaska as grounds for its decision in this case, but they are not in\nthemselves compelling. While state resource constraints might justify\n12    DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                     DIST. v. OSBORNE\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   While we have long recognized that States have an\ninterest in securing the finality of their judgments, see,\ne.g., Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 179 (2001); Teague\nv. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 309 (1989) (plurality opinion);\nMcCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 491–492 (1991), finality\nis not a stand-alone value that trumps a State’s overriding\ninterest in ensuring that justice is done in its courts and\nsecured to its citizens. Indeed, when absolute proof of\ninnocence is readily at hand, a State should not shrink\nfrom the possibility that error may have occurred. Rather,\nour system of justice is strengthened by “recogniz[ing] the\nneed for, and imperative of, a safety valve in those rare\ninstances where objective proof that the convicted actually\ndid not commit the offense later becomes available\nthrough the progress of science.” Harvey, 285 F. 3d, at 306\n(Luttig, J.). DNA evidence has led to an extraordinary\nseries of exonerations, not only in cases where the trial\nevidence was weak, but also in cases where the convicted\n\n——————\ndelays in the testing of postconviction DNA evidence, they would not\njustify an outright ban on access to such evidence. And JUSTICE ALITO’s\nconcern that guilty defendants will “play games with the criminal\njustice system” with regard to the timing of their requests for DNA\nevidence is not only speculative, but gravely concerning. Ante, at 10. It\nbears remembering that criminal defendants are under no obligation to\nprove their innocence at trial; rather, the State bears the burden of\nproving their guilt. See Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U. S. 510 (1979);\nIn re Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970). Having no obligation to conduct\npretrial DNA testing, a defendant should not be bound by a decision to\nforgo such testing at trial, particularly when, as in this case, the choice\nwas made by counsel over the defendant’s strong objection. See Os\nborne I, 110 P. 3d, at 990-991. (JUSTICE ALITO suggests there is reason\nto doubt whether Osborne asked his counsel to perform DNA testing\nprior to trial, ante, at 12. That fact was not disputed in the state\ncourts, however. Although Osborne’s trial counsel averred that she “did\nnot have a present memory of Osborne’s desire to have [a more specific\ndiscriminatory] test of his DNA done,” she also averred that she was\n“willing to accept that he does\" and that she “would have disagreed\nwith him.” Id., at 990.)\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

When a person is convicted for a crime he\ndid not commit, the true culprit escapes punishment.\nDNA testing may lead to his identification. See Brief for\nCurrent and Former Prosecutors as Amici Curiae 16\n(noting that in more than one-third of all exonerations\nDNA testing identified the actual offender). Crime vic­\ntims, the law enforcement profession, and society at large\nshare a strong interest in identifying and apprehending\nthe actual perpetrators of vicious crimes, such as the rape\nand attempted murder that gave rise to this case.\n   The arbitrariness of the State’s conduct is highlighted\nby comparison to the private interests it denies. It seems\nto me obvious that if a wrongly convicted person were to\nproduce proof of his actual innocence, no state interest\nwould be sufficient to justify his continued punitive deten­\ntion. If such proof can be readily obtained without impos­\ning a significant burden on the State, a refusal to provide\naccess to such evidence is wholly unjustified.\n   In sum, an individual’s interest in his physical liberty is\none of constitutional significance. That interest would be\n——————\n  9 See generally Brief for Current and Former Prosecutors as Amici\nCuriae; Brief for Jeanette Popp et al. as Amici Curiae; see also Brief for\nIndividuals Exonerated by Postconviction DNA Testing as Amici Curiae\n1–20.

In this case, the\nState has suggested no countervailing interest that justi­\nfies its refusal to allow Osborne to test the evidence in its\npossession and has not provided any other nonarbitrary\nexplanation for its conduct. Consequently, I am left to\nconclude that the State’s failure to provide Osborne access\nto the evidence constitutes arbitrary action that offends\nbasic principles of due process. On that basis, I would\naffirm the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.\n                               III\n   The majority denies that Osborne possesses a cognizable\nsubstantive due process right “under the circumstances of\nthis case,” and offers two meager reasons for its decision.\nFirst, citing a general reluctance to “ ‘expand the concept\nof substantive due process,’ ” ante, at 19 (quoting Collins,\n503 U. S., at 125), the Court observes that there is no long\nhistory of postconviction access to DNA evidence. “ ‘The\nmere novelty of such a claim,’ ” the Court asserts, “ ‘is\nreason enough to doubt that “substantive due process”\nsustains it,’ ” ante, at 19 (quoting Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S.\n292, 303 (1993)). The flaw is in the framing. Of course\ncourts have not historically granted convicted persons\naccess to physical evidence for STR and mtDNA testing.\nBut, as discussed above, courts have recognized a residual\nsubstantive interest in both physical liberty and in free­\ndom from arbitrary government action. It is Osborne’s\ninterest in those well-established liberties that justifies\nthe Court of Appeals’ decision to grant him access to the\nState’s evidence for purposes of previously unavailable\nDNA testing.\n   The majority also asserts that this Court’s recognition of\na limited federal right of access to DNA evidence would be\nill advised because it would “short circuit what looks to be\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

Such a decision, the majority warns,\nwould embroil the Court in myriad policy questions best\nleft to other branches of government. Ante, at 19–20. The\nmajority’s arguments in this respect bear close resem­\nblance to the manner in which the Court once approached\nthe now-venerable right to counsel for indigent defen­\ndants. Before our decision in Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S.\n45 (1932), state law alone governed the manner in which\ncounsel was appointed for indigent defendants. “Efforts to\nimpose a minimum federal standard for the right to coun­\nsel in state courts routinely met the same refrain: ‘in the\nface of these widely varying state procedures,’ this Court\nrefused to impose the dictates of ‘due process’ onto the\nstates and ‘hold invalid all procedure not reaching that\nstandard.” Brief for Current and Former Prosecutors as\nAmici Curiae 28, n. 8 (quoting Bute v. Illinois, 333 U. S.\n640, 668 (1948)). When at last this Court recognized the\nSixth Amendment right to counsel for all indigent criminal\ndefendants in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963),\nour decision did not impede the ability of States to tailor\ntheir appointment processes to local needs, nor did it\nunnecessarily interfere with their sovereignty. It did,\nhowever, ensure that criminal defendants were provided\nwith the counsel to which they were constitutionally enti­\ntled.10 In the same way, a decision to recognize a limited\n\n——————\n  10 The majority’s position also resembles that taken by Justice Harlan\n\nin his dissent in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 523 (1966), in\nwhich he faulted the Court for its “ironic untimeliness.” He noted that\nthe Court’s decision came at time when scholars, politicians, and law\nenforcement officials were beginning to engage in a “massive reexami­\nnation of criminal law enforcement procedures on a scale never before\nwitnessed,” and predicted that the practical effect of the Court’s deci­\nsion would be to “handicap seriously” those sound efforts. Id., at 523–\n524. Yet time has vindicated the decision in Miranda. The Court’s\n16    DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                     DIST. v. OSBORNE\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nright of postconviction access to DNA testing would not\nprevent the States from creating procedures by which\nlitigants request and obtain such access; it would merely\nensure that States do so in a manner that is nonarbitrary.\n   While it is true that recent advances in DNA technology\nhave led to a nationwide reexamination of state and fed­\neral postconviction procedures authorizing the use of DNA\ntesting, it is highly unlikely that affirming the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals would significantly affect the use of\nDNA testing in any of the States that have already devel­\noped statutes and procedures for dealing with DNA evi­\ndence or would require the few States that have not yet\ndone so to postpone the enactment of appropriate legisla­\ntion.11 Indeed, a holding by this Court that the policy\n——————\nrefusal to grant Osborne access to critical DNA evidence rests on a\npractical judgment remarkably similar to Justice Harlan’s, and I find\nthe majority’s judgment today as profoundly incorrect as the Miranda\nminority’s was yesterday.\n   11 The United States and several States have voiced concern that the\n\nrecognition of a limited federal right of access to DNA evidence might\ncall into question reasonable limits placed on such access by federal and\nstate statutes. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 17–26;\nBrief for State of California et al. as Amici Curiae 1–16. For example,\nfederal law and several state statutes impose the requirement that an\napplicant seeking postconviction DNA testing execute an affidavit\nattesting to his innocence before any request will be performed. See,\ne.g., 18 U. S. C. §3600(a)(1); Fla. Stat. §925.11(2)(a)(3) (2009 Supp.).\nAffirming the judgment of the Ninth Circuit would not cast doubt on\nthe constitutionality of such a requirement, however, since Osborne\nwas never asked to execute such an affidavit as a precondition to\nobtaining access to the State’s evidence. Similarly, affirmance would\nnot call into question the legitimacy of other reasonable conditions\nStates may place on access to DNA testing, such as Alaska’s require­\nment that test results be capable of yielding a clear answer with respect\nto guilt or innocence. “[D]ue process is flexible,” Morrissey v. Brewer,\n408 U. S. 471, 481 (1972), and the manner in which it is provided may\nreasonably vary from State to State and case to case.

On the record before us, there is\nno reason to deny access to the evidence and there are\nmany reasons to provide it, not least of which is a funda­\nmental concern in ensuring that justice has been done in\nthis case.

I\nwould reserve judgment on the issue simply because there\nis no need to reach it; at a general level Alaska does not\ndeny a right to postconviction testing to prove innocence,\nand in any event, Osborne’s claim can be resolved by\nresort to the procedural due process requirement of an\neffective way to vindicate a liberty interest already recog­\nnized in state law, see Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U. S. 387, 393\n(1985).

Flo\nres, 507 U. S. 292, 318–319 (1993) (O’Connor, J., concur­\nring). Tradition is of course one serious consideration in\njudging whether a challenged rule or practice, or the\nfailure to provide a new one, should be seen as violating\nthe guarantee of substantive due process as being arbi­\ntrary, or as falling wholly outside the realm of reasonable\ngovernmental action. See Poe v. Ullman, 367 U. S. 497,\n542 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting). We recognize the\nvalue and lessons of continuity with the past, but as Jus­\ntice Harlan pointed out, society finds reasons to modify\nsome of its traditional practices, ibid., and the accumula­\ntion of new empirical knowledge can turn yesterday’s\nreasonable range of the government’s options into a due\nprocess anomaly over time.\n   As for determining the right moment for a court to\ndecide whether substantive due process requires recogni­\ntion of an individual right unsanctioned by tradition (or\nthe invalidation of traditional law), I certainly agree with\nthe Court that the beginning of wisdom is to go slow.\nSubstantive due process expresses the conception that the\nliberty it protects is a freedom from arbitrary government\naction, from restraints lacking any reasonable justification\nid., at 541,1 and a substantive due process claim requires\nattention to two closely related elements that call for great\ncare on the part of a court.

Just as attachment to the familiar and the limits of\nexperience affect the capacity of an individual to see the\npotential legitimacy of a moral position, the broader soci­\nety needs the chance to take part in the dialectic of public\nand political back and forth about a new liberty claim\n4    DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL \n\n                    DIST. v. OSBORNE \n\n                   SOUTER, J., dissenting \n\n\nbefore it makes sense to declare unsympathetic state or\nnational laws arbitrary to the point of being unconstitu­\ntional. The time required is a matter for judgment de­\npending on the issue involved, but the need for some time\nto pass before a court entertains a substantive due process\nclaim on the subject is not merely the requirement of\njudicial restraint as a general approach, but a doctrinal\ndemand to be satisfied before an allegedly lagging legal\nregime can be held to lie beyond the discretion of reason­\nable political judgment.\n   Despite my agreement with the Court on this impor­\ntance of timing, though, I do not think that the doctrinal\nrequirement necessarily stands in the way of any substan­\ntive due process consideration of a postconviction right to\nDNA testing, even as a right that is freestanding. Given\nthe pace at which DNA testing has come to be recognized\nas potentially dispositive in many cases with biological\nevidence, there is no obvious argument that considering\nDNA testing at a general level would subject wholly in­\ntransigent legal systems to substantive due process review\nprematurely. But, as I said, there is no such issue before\nus, for Alaska does not flatly deny access to evidence for\nDNA testing in postconviction cases.\n   In another case, a judgment about appropriate timing\nmight also be necessary on issues of substantive due proc­\ness at the more specific level of the State’s conditions for\nexercising the right to test. Several such limitations are\npotentially implicated, including the need of a claimant to\nshow that the test results would be material as potentially\nshowing innocence, and the requirement that the testing\nsought be capable of producing new evidence not available\nat trial. But although I assume that avoiding prematurity\nis as much a doctrinal consideration in assessing the\nconditions affecting a substantive right as it is when the\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                   5\n\n                        SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nsubstantive right itself is the subject of a general claim,2\nthere is no need here to resolve any timing issue that\nmight be raised by challenges to these details.\n  Osborne’s objection here is not only to the content of the\nState’s terms and conditions, but also to the adequacy of\nAlaska’s official machinery in applying them, and there is\nno reason to defer consideration of this due process claim:\ngiven the conditions Alaska has placed on the right it\nrecognizes, the due process guarantee requires the State\nto provide an effective procedure for proving entitlement\nto relief under that scheme, Evitts, 469 U. S., at 393, and\nthe State has failed. On this issue, Osborne is entitled to\nrelief. Alaska has presented no good reasons even on its\nown terms for denying Osborne the access to the evidence\nhe seeks, and the inexplicable failure of the State to pro­\nvide an effective procedure is enough to show a need for a\n§1983 remedy, and relief in this case. JUSTICE STEVENS\ndeals with this failure in Part I of his dissent, which I join,\nand I emphasize only two points here.\n  In effect, Alaska argues against finding any right to\nrelief in a federal §1983 action because the procedure the\nState provides is reasonable and adequate to vindicate the\npost-trial liberty interest in testing evidence that the State\nhas chosen to recognize.3 When I first considered the\n——————\n  2 It makes sense to approach these questions as governed by the same\n\nrequirement to allow time for adequate societal and legislative consid­\neration that substantive liberty interests should receive at a general\nlevel. As Judge Luttig has pointed out, there is no hermetic line\nbetween the substantive and the procedural in due process analysis,\nHarvey v. Horan, 285 F. 3d 298, 318–319 (CA4 2002), and in this case\none could argue back and forth about the better characterization of\nvarious state conditions as being one or the other.\n  3 Alaska does not argue that the State’s process for vindicating the\n\nright to test, however inadequate, defines the limit of the right it\nrecognizes, with a consequence that, by definition, the liberty interest\nrecognized by the State calls for no process for its vindication beyond\nwhat the State provides.\n6    DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL \n\n                    DIST. v. OSBORNE \n\n                   SOUTER, J., dissenting \n\n\nState’s position I thought Alaska’s two strongest points\nwere these: (1) that in Osborne’s state litigation he failed\nto request access for the purpose of a variety of postconvic­\ntion testing that could not have been done at time of trial\n(and thus sought no new evidence by his state-court peti­\ntion); and (2) that he failed to aver actual innocence (and\nthus failed to place his oath behind the assertion that the\nevidence sought would be material to his postconviction\nclaim). Denying him any relief under these circumstances,\nthe argument ran, did not indicate any inadequacy in the\nstate procedure that would justify resort to §1983 for\nproviding due process.\n   Yet the record shows that Osborne has been denied\naccess to the evidence even though he satisfied each of\nthese conditions. As for the requirement to claim testing\nby a method not available at trial, Osborne’s state-court\nappellate brief specifically mentioned his intent to conduct\nshort tandem repeat (STR) analysis, App. at 171, 175, and\nthe State points to no pleading, brief, or evidence that\nOsborne ever changed this request.\n   The State’s reliance on Osborne’s alleged failure to claim\nfactual innocence is equally untenable. While there is no\nquestion that after conviction and imprisonment he admit­\nted guilt under oath as a condition for becoming eligible\nfor parole, the record before us makes it equally apparent\nthat he claims innocence on oath now. His affidavit filed\nin support of his request for evidence under §1983 con­\ntained the statement, “I have always maintained my\ninnocence,” id., at 226, ¶2, followed by an explanation that\nhis admission of guilt was a necessary gimmick to obtain\nparole, id., at 227, ¶7. Since the State persists in main­\ntaining that Osborne is not entitled to test its evidence, it\nis apparently mere makeweight for the State to claim that\nhe is not entitled to §1983 relief because he failed to claim\ninnocence seriously and unequivocally.\n   This is not the first time the State has produced reasons\n                    Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                   7\n\n                        SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nfor opposing Osborne’s request that collapse upon inspec­\ntion. Arguing before the Ninth Circuit, the State main­\ntained that the DNA evidence Osborne sought was not\nmaterial; that is, it argued that a test excluding Osborne\nas the source of semen in the blue condom, found near the\nbloody snow and spent shell casing in the secluded area\nwhere the victim was raped by one man, would not “estab­\nlish that he was factually innocent” or even “undermine\nconfidence . . . in the verdict.” Reply of Appellant, in No.\n06-35875 (CA9 2008), p. 18; see also 521 F. 3d 1118, 1136\n(CA9 2008). Such an argument is patently untenable, and\nthe State now concedes that a favorable test could “conclu­\nsively establish Osborne’s innocence.” Reply to Brief in\nOpposition 8.\n   Standing alone, the inadequacy of each of the State’s\nreasons for denying Osborne access to the DNA evidence\nhe seeks would not make out a due process violation.4 But\ntaken as a whole the record convinces me that, while\nAlaska has created an entitlement of access to DNA evi­\ndence under conditions that are facially reasonable, the\nState has demonstrated a combination of inattentiveness\nand intransigence in applying those conditions that add up\nto procedural unfairness that violates the Due Process\nClause.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  4 This Court is not in a position to correct individual errors of the\n\nAlaska Court of Appeals or Alaska officials, as §1983 does not serve as\na mechanism to review specific, unfavorable state-law determinations.\n</pre>", "id": 145860, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2009/06/18/District_Attorneys_Office_for_Third_Judicial_Dist._v._Osborne.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2008                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued March 2, 2009—Decided June 18, 2009\nRespondent Osborne was convicted of sexual assault and other crimes\n  in state court. Years later, he filed this suit under 42 U. S. C. §1983,\n  claiming he had a due process right to access the evidence used\n  against him in order to subject it to DNA testing at his own expense.\n  The Federal District Court first dismissed his claim under Heck v.\n  Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477, holding that Osborne must proceed in ha\n  beas because he sought to set the stage for an attack on his convic\n  tion. The Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that §1983 was the\n  proper vehicle for Osborne’s claims. On remand, the District Court\n  granted Osborne summary judgment, concluding that he had a lim\n  ited constitutional right to the new testing under the unique and spe\n  cific facts presented, i.e., that such testing had been unavailable at\n  trial, that it could be accomplished at almost no cost to the State, and\n  that the results were likely to be material. The Ninth Circuit af\n  firmed, relying on the prosecutorial duty to disclose exculpatory evi\n  dence under, e.g., Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83.\nHeld: Assuming Osborne’s claims can be pursued using §1983, he has\n no constitutional right to obtain postconviction access to the State’s\n evidence for DNA testing. Pp. 8–21.\n    (a) DNA testing has an unparalleled ability both to exonerate the\n wrongly convicted and to identify the guilty. The availability of new\n DNA testing technologies, however, cannot mean that every criminal\n conviction, or even every criminal conviction involving biological evi\n dence, is suddenly in doubt. The task of establishing rules to harness\n DNA’s power to prove innocence without unnecessarily overthrowing\n the established criminal justice system belongs primarily to the legis\n lature. See Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 719. Forty-six\n2       DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL \n\n                      DIST. v. OSBORNE \n\n                           Syllabus \n\n\n    States and the Federal Government have already enacted statutes\n    dealing specifically with access to evidence for DNA testing. These\n    laws recognize the value of DNA testing but also the need for condi\n    tions on accessing the State’s evidence. Alaska is one of a handful of\n    States yet to enact specific DNA testing legislation, but Alaska courts\n    are addressing how to apply existing discovery and postconviction re\n    lief laws to this novel technology. Pp. 8–11.\n       (b) The Court assumes without deciding that the Ninth Circuit was\n    correct that Heck does not bar Osborne’s §1983 claim. That claim can\n    be rejected without resolving the proper application of Heck. Pp. 12–\n    13.\n       (c) The Ninth Circuit erred in finding a due process violation.\n    Pp. 13–21.\n          (i) While Osborne does have a liberty interest in pursuing the\n    postconviction relief granted by the State, the Ninth Circuit erred in\n    extending the Brady right of pretrial disclosure to the postconviction\n    context. Osborne has already been found guilty and therefore has\n    only a limited liberty interest in postconviction relief. See, e.g.,\n    Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390, 399. Instead of the Brady inquiry,\n    the question is whether consideration of Osborne’s claim within the\n    framework of the State’s postconviction relief procedures “offends\n    some [fundamental] principle of justice” or “transgresses any recog\n    nized principle of fundamental fairness in operation.” Medina v.\n    California, 505 U. S. 437, 446, 448. Federal courts may upset a\n    State’s postconviction relief procedures only if they are fundamen\n    tally inadequate to vindicate the substantive rights provided.\n       There is nothing inadequate about Alaska’s postconviction relief\n    procedures in general or its methods for applying those procedures to\n    persons seeking access to evidence for DNA testing. The State pro\n    vides a substantive right to be released on a sufficiently compelling\n    showing of new evidence that establishes innocence. It also provides\n    for discovery in postconviction proceedings, and has—through judi\n    cial decision—specified that such discovery is available to those seek\n    ing access to evidence for DNA testing. These procedures are similar\n    to those provided by federal law and the laws of other States, and\n    they satisfy due process. The same is true for Osborne’s reliance on a\n    claimed federal right to be released upon proof of “actual innocence.”\n    Even assuming such a right exists, which the Court has not decided\n    and does not decide, there is no due process problem, given the pro\n    cedures available to access evidence for DNA testing. Pp. 13–18.\n          (ii) The Court rejects Osborne’s invitation to recognize a free\n    standing, substantive due process right to DNA evidence untethered\n    from the liberty interests he hopes to vindicate with it. In the cir\n    cumstances of this case, there is no such right. Generally, the Court\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  is “reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process be\n  cause guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered\n  area are scarce and open-ended.” Collins v. Harker Heights, 503\n  U. S. 115, 125. There is no long history of a right of access to state\n  evidence for DNA testing that might prove innocence. “The mere\n  novelty of such a claim is reason enough to doubt that ‘substantive\n  due process’ sustains it.” Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 303. More\n  over, to suddenly constitutionalize this area would short-circuit what\n  has been a prompt and considered legislative response by Congress\n  and the States. It would shift to the Federal Judiciary responsibility\n  for devising rules governing DNA access and creating a new constitu\n  tional code of procedures to answer the myriad questions that would\n  arise. There is no reason to suppose that federal courts’ answers to\n  those questions will be any better than those of state courts and leg\n  islatures, and good reason to suspect the opposite.

It has\nthe potential to significantly improve both the criminal\njustice system and police investigative practices. The\nFederal Government and the States have recognized this,\nand have developed special approaches to ensure that this\nevidentiary tool can be effectively incorporated into estab\nlished criminal procedure—usually but not always\nthrough legislation.\n   Against this prompt and considered response, the re\nspondent, William Osborne, proposes a different approach:\nthe recognition of a freestanding and far-reaching consti\ntutional right of access to this new type of evidence. The\nnature of what he seeks is confirmed by his decision to file\nthis lawsuit in federal court under 42 U. S. C. §1983, not\nwithin the state criminal justice system. This approach\nwould take the development of rules and procedures in\nthis area out of the hands of legislatures and state courts\n2    DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                   DIST. v.

On the evening of March\n22, 1993, two men driving through Anchorage, Alaska,\nsolicited sex from a female prostitute, K. G. She agreed to\nperform fellatio on both men for $100 and got in their car.\nThe three spent some time looking for a place to stop and\nended up in a deserted area near Earthquake Park. When\nK. G. demanded payment in advance, the two men pulled\nout a gun and forced her to perform fellatio on the driver\nwhile the passenger penetrated her vaginally, using a blue\ncondom she had brought. The passenger then ordered\nK. G. out of the car and told her to lie face-down in the\nsnow. Fearing for her life, she refused, and the two men\nchoked her and beat her with the gun. When K. G. tried\nto flee, the passenger beat her with a wooden axe handle\nand shot her in the head while she lay on the ground.\nThey kicked some snow on top of her and left her for dead.\n521 F. 3d 1118, 1122 (CA9 2008) (case below); Osborne v.\nState, 163 P. 3d 973, 975–976 (Alaska App. 2007) (Osborne\nII); App. 27, 42–44.\n   K. G. did not die; the bullet had only grazed her head.\nOnce the two men left, she found her way back to the road,\nand flagged down a passing car to take her home. Ulti\nmately, she received medical care and spoke to the police.\nAt the scene of the crime, the police recovered a spent\nshell casing, the axe handle, some of K.

An axe handle similar to the one at\nthe scene of the crime was found in Osborne’s room on the\nmilitary base where he lived.\n   The State also performed DQ Alpha testing on sperm\nfound in the blue condom. DQ Alpha testing is a relatively\ninexact form of DNA testing that can clear some wrongly\naccused individuals, but generally cannot narrow the\nperpetrator down to less than 5% of the population.

In other words, the test\ning ruled out Jackson and Hunter as possible sources of\nthe semen, and also ruled out over 80% of other black\nindividuals. The State also examined some pubic hairs\nfound at the scene of the crime, which were not susceptible\nto DQ Alpha testing, but which state witnesses attested to\nbe similar to Osborne’s.

They were\nacquitted of an additional count of sexual assault and of\nattempted murder. Finding it “ ‘nearly miraculous’ ” that\nK. G. had survived, the trial judge sentenced Osborne to\n26 years in prison, with 5 suspended. Id., at 128a. His\nconviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal. Id., at\n113a–130a.\n   Osborne then sought postconviction relief in Alaska\nstate court. He claimed that he had asked his attorney,\nSidney Billingslea, to seek more discriminating restric\ntion-fragment-length-polymorphism (RFLP) DNA testing\nduring trial, and argued that she was constitutionally\nineffective for not doing so.1 Billingslea testified that after\ninvestigation, she had concluded that further testing\nwould do more harm than good. She planned to mount a\ndefense of mistaken identity, and thought that the impre\ncision of the DQ Alpha test gave her “ ‘very good numbers\nin a mistaken identity, cross-racial identification case,\nwhere the victim was in the dark and had bad eyesight.’ ”\n——————\n  1 RFLP testing, unlike DQ Alpha testing, “has a high degree of dis\n\ncrimination,” although it is sometimes ineffective on small samples.\nPostconviction DNA Testing 26–27; Future of Forensic DNA Testing\n14–16. Billingslea testified that she had no memory of Osborne making\nsuch a request, but said she was “ ‘willing to accept’ ” that he had.\nOsborne I, 110 P. 3d 986, 990 (Alaska App. 2005).\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

The Alaska Court of Appeals\nconcluded that Billingslea’s decision had been strategic\nand rejected Osborne’s claim. Id., at 991–992.\n  In this proceeding, Osborne also sought the DNA testing\nthat Billingslea had failed to perform, relying on an\nAlaska postconviction statute, Alaska Stat. §12.72 (2008),\nand the State and Federal Constitutions. In two decisions,\nthe Alaska Court of Appeals concluded that Osborne had\nno right to the RFLP test. According to the court, §12.72\n“apparently” did not apply to DNA testing that had been\navailable at trial.2 Osborne I, 110 P. 3d, at 992–993. The\ncourt found no basis in our precedents for recognizing a\nfederal constitutional right to DNA evidence. Id., at 993.\nAfter a remand for further findings, the Alaska Court of\nAppeals concluded that Osborne could not claim a state\nconstitutional right either, because the other evidence of\nhis guilt was too strong and RFLP testing was not likely to\nbe conclusive.

Two of\nthe three judges wrote separately to say that “[i]f Osborne\ncould show that he were in fact innocent, it would be\nunconscionable to punish him,” and that doing so might\nviolate the Alaska Constitution. Id., at 984–985 (Mann\nheimer, J., concurring).\n  The court relied heavily on the fact that Osborne had\nconfessed to some of his crimes in a 2004 application for\nparole—in which it is a crime to lie.

Brief for Petitioners 7, n. 3.\n   Meanwhile, Osborne had also been active in federal\ncourt, suing state officials under 42 U. S. C. §1983. He\nclaimed that the Due Process Clause and other constitu\ntional provisions gave him a constitutional right to access\nthe DNA evidence for what is known as short-tandem\nrepeat (STR) testing (at his own expense). App. 24. This\nform of testing is more discriminating than the DQ Alpha\nor RFLP methods available at the time of Osborne’s trial.3\nThe District Court first dismissed the claim under Heck v.\nHumphrey, 512 U. S. 477 (1994), holding it “inescapable”\nthat Osborne sought to “set the stage” for an attack on his\nconviction, and therefore “must proceed through a writ of\nhabeas corpus.” App. 207 (internal quotation marks omit\nted). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit reversed, concluding that §1983 was the proper\nvehicle for Osborne’s claims, while “express[ing] no opin\nion as to whether Osborne ha[d] been deprived of a feder\nally protected right.” 423 F. 3d, at 1056.\n   On cross-motions for summary judgment after remand,\n\n——————\n  3 STR testing is extremely discriminating, can be used on small sam\n\nples, and is “rapidly becoming the standard.” Future of Forensic DNA\nTesting 18, n. 9.

Supp.\n2d 1079, 1081 (2006). The court relied on several factors:\nthat the testing Osborne sought had been unavailable at\ntrial, that the testing could be accomplished at almost no\ncost to the State, and that the results were likely to be\nmaterial. Id., at 1081–1082. It therefore granted sum\nmary judgment in favor of Osborne.\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed, relying on the prosecuto\nrial duty to disclose exculpatory evidence recognized in\nPennsylvania v. Ritchie, 480 U. S. 39 (1987), and Brady v.\nMaryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). While acknowledging that\nour precedents “involved only the right to pre-trial disclo\nsure,” the court concluded that the Due Process Clause\nalso “extends the government’s duty to disclose (or the\ndefendant’s right of access) to post-conviction proceedings.”\n521 F. 3d, at 1128. Although Osborne’s trial and appeals\nwere over, the court noted that he had a “potentially vi\nable” state constitutional claim of “actual innocence,” id.,\nat 1130, and relied on the “well-established assumption”\nthat a similar claim arose under the Federal Constitution,\nid., at 1131; cf. Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390 (1993).\nThe court held that these potential claims extended some\nof the State’s Brady obligations to the postconviction\ncontext.\n   The court declined to decide the details of what showing\nmust be made to access the evidence because it found\n“Osborne’s case for disclosure . . . so strong on the facts”\nthat “[w]herever the bar is, he crosses it.” 521 F. 3d, at\n1134. While acknowledging that Osborne’s prior confes\nsions were “certainly relevant,” the court concluded that\nthey did not “necessarily trum[p] . . . the right to obtain\npost-conviction access to evidence” in light of the “emerg\ning reality of wrongful convictions based on false confes\nsions.” Id., at 1140.\n8    DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                   DIST. v. OSBORNE\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n   We granted certiorari to decide whether Osborne’s\nclaims could be pursued using §1983, and whether he has\na right under the Due Process Clause to obtain postconvic\ntion access to the State’s evidence for DNA testing. 555\nU.

Since its first use in crimi\nnal investigations in the mid-1980s, there have been\nseveral major advances in DNA technology, culminating in\nSTR technology. It is now often possible to determine\nwhether a biological tissue matches a suspect with near\ncertainty. While of course many criminal trials proceed\nwithout any forensic and scientific testing at all, there is\nno technology comparable to DNA testing for matching\ntissues when such evidence is at issue. Postconviction\nDNA Testing 1–2; Future of Forensic DNA Testing 13–14.\nDNA testing has exonerated wrongly convicted people, and\nhas confirmed the convictions of many others.\n   At the same time, DNA testing alone does not always\nresolve a case. Where there is enough other incriminating\nevidence and an explanation for the DNA result, science\nalone cannot prove a prisoner innocent. See House v. Bell,\n547 U. S. 518, 540–548 (2006). The availability of tech\nnologies not available at trial cannot mean that every\ncriminal conviction, or even every criminal conviction\ninvolving biological evidence, is suddenly in doubt. The\ndilemma is how to harness DNA’s power to prove inno\ncence without unnecessarily overthrowing the established\nsystem of criminal justice.\n   That task belongs primarily to the legislature. “[T]he\nStates are currently engaged in serious, thoughtful ex\naminations,” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 719\n(1997), of how to ensure the fair and effective use of this\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntesting within the existing criminal justice framework.\nForty-six States have already enacted statutes dealing\nspecifically with access to DNA evidence. See generally\nBrief for State of California et al. as Amici Curiae 3–13;\nGarrett, Claiming Innocence, 92 Minn. L. Rev 1629, 1719\n(2008) (surveying state statutes); see also An Act to Im\nprove the Preservation and Accessibility of Biological\nEvidence, Mississippi S. 2709 (enacted March 16, 2009);\nAn Act to Provide for DNA Testing for Certain Inmates for\nthe Purposes of Determining Whether They May Have\nBeen Wrongfully Convicted, South Dakota H. 1166 (en\nacted March 11, 2009). The State of Alaska itself is con\nsidering joining them. See An Act Relating to Post\nconviction DNA Testing, H. 174, 26th Leg., 1st Sess.\n(2009) (proposed legislation similar to that enacted by the\nStates). The Federal Government has also passed the\nInnocence Protection Act of 2004, §411, 118 Stat. 2278,\ncodified in part at 18 U. S. C. §3600, which allows federal\nprisoners to move for court-ordered DNA testing under\ncertain specified conditions. That Act also grants money\nto States that enact comparable statutes, §413, 118 Stat.\n2285, note following 42 U. S. C. §14136, and as a conse\nquence has served as a model for some state legislation.\nAt oral argument, Osborne agreed that the federal statute\nis a model for how States ought to handle the issue. Tr. of\nOral Arg. 33, 38–39; see also Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 19–26 (defending constitutionality of Inno\ncence Protection Act).\n   These laws recognize the value of DNA evidence but also\nthe need for certain conditions on access to the State’s\nevidence. A requirement of demonstrating materiality is\ncommon, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §3600(a)(8), but it is not the only\none. The federal statute, for example, requires a sworn\nstatement that the applicant is innocent. §3600(a)(1).\nThis requirement is replicated in several state statutes.\nE.g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. §§1405(b)(1), (c)(1) (West Supp.\n10   DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                   DIST. v. OSBORNE\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n2009); Fla. Stat. §925.11(2)(a)(3) (2006); N. H. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. 651–D:2(I)(b) (2007); S. C. Code Ann. 17–28–40\n(Supp. 2008). States also impose a range of diligence\nrequirements. Several require the requested testing to\n“have been technologically impossible at trial.” Garrett,\nsupra, at 1681, and n. 242. Others deny testing to those\nwho declined testing at trial for tactical reasons. E.g.,\nUtah Code. Ann. §78B–9–301(4) (2008).\n   Alaska is one of a handful of States yet to enact legisla\ntion specifically addressing the issue of evidence requested\nfor DNA testing. But that does not mean that such evi\ndence is unavailable for those seeking to prove their inno\ncence. Instead, Alaska courts are addressing how to apply\nexisting laws for discovery and postconviction relief to this\nnovel technology. See Osborne I, 110 P. 3d, at 992–993;\nPatterson v. State, No. A–8814, 2006 WL 573797, *4\n(Alaska App., Mar. 8, 2006). The same is true with respect\nto other States that do not have DNA-specific statutes.\nE.g., Fagan v. State, 957 So. 2d 1159 (Ala. Crim. App.\n2007). Cf. Mass. Rule Crim. Proc. 30(c)(4) (2009).\n   First, access to evidence is available under Alaska law\nfor those who seek to subject it to newly available DNA\ntesting that will prove them to be actually innocent.\nUnder the State’s general postconviction relief statute, a\nprisoner may challenge his conviction when “there exists\nevidence of material facts, not previously presented and\nheard by the court, that requires vacation of the conviction\nor sentence in the interest of justice.” Alaska Stat.\n§12.72.010(4) (2008). Such a claim is exempt from other\nwise applicable time limits if “newly discovered evidence,”\npursued with due diligence, “establishes by clear and\nconvincing evidence that the applicant is innocent.”\n§12.72.020(b)(2).\n   Both parties agree that under these provisions of §12.72,\n“a defendant is entitled to post-conviction relief if the\ndefendant presents newly discovered evidence that estab\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlishes by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant\nis innocent.” Osborne I, supra, at 992 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). If such a claim is brought, state law\npermits general discovery.          See Alaska Rule Crim.\nProc. 35.1(g). Alaska courts have explained that these\nprocedures are available to request DNA evidence for\nnewly available testing to establish actual innocence. See\nPatterson, supra, at *4 (“If Patterson had brought the\nDNA analysis request as part of his previous application\nfor [postconviction] relief . . . he would have been able to\nrequest production of evidence”).\n   In addition to this statutory procedure, the Alaska\nCourt of Appeals has invoked a widely accepted three-part\ntest to govern additional rights to DNA access under the\nState Constitution. Osborne II, 163 P. 3d, at 974–975.\nDrawing on the experience with DNA evidence of State\nSupreme Courts around the country, the Court of Appeals\nexplained that it was “reluctant to hold that Alaska law\noffers no remedy to defendants who could prove their\nfactual innocence.” Osborne I, 110 P. 3d, at 995; see id., at\n995, n. 27 (citing decisions from other state courts). It was\n“prepared to hold, however, that a defendant who seeks\npost-conviction DNA testing . . . must show (1) that the\nconviction rested primarily on eyewitness identification\nevidence, (2) that there was a demonstrable doubt con\ncerning the defendant’s identification as the perpetrator,\nand (3) that scientific testing would likely be conclusive on\nthis issue.” Id., at 995. Thus, the Alaska courts have\nsuggested that even those who do not get discovery under\nthe State’s criminal rules have available to them a safety\nvalve under the State Constitution.\n   This is the background against which the Federal Court\nof Appeals ordered the State to turn over the DNA evi\ndence in its possession, and it is our starting point in\nanalyzing Osborne’s constitutional claims.\n12   DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                   DIST. v. OSBORNE\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\n                               III\n   The parties dispute whether Osborne has invoked the\nproper federal statute in bringing his claim. He sued\nunder the federal civil rights statute, 42 U. S. C. §1983,\nwhich gives a cause of action to those who challenge a\nState’s “deprivation of any rights . . . secured by the Con\nstitution.” The State insists that Osborne’s claim must be\nbrought under 28 U. S. C. §2254, which allows a prisoner\nto seek “a writ of habeas corpus . . . on the ground that he\nis in custody in violation of the Constitution.”\n   While Osborne’s claim falls within the literal terms of\n§1983, we have also recognized that §1983 must be read in\nharmony with the habeas statute. See Preiser v. Rodri\nguez, 411 U. S. 475, 500 (1973); Heck, 512 U. S., at 487.\n“Stripped to its essence,” the State says, “Osborne’s §1983\naction is nothing more than a request for evidence to\nsupport a hypothetical claim that he is actually inno\ncent. . . . [T]his hypothetical claim sounds at the core of\nhabeas corpus.” Brief for Petitioners 19.\n   Osborne responds that his claim does not sound in\nhabeas at all. Although invalidating his conviction is of\ncourse his ultimate goal, giving him the evidence he seeks\n“would not necessarily imply the invalidity of [his] con\nfinement.” Brief for Respondent 21. If he prevails, he\nwould receive only access to the DNA, and even if DNA\ntesting exonerates him, his conviction is not automatically\ninvalidated. He must bring an entirely separate suit or a\npetition for clemency to invalidate his conviction. If he\nwere proved innocent, the State might also release him on\nits own initiative, avoiding any need to pursue habeas at\nall.\n   Osborne also invokes our recent decision in Wilkinson v.\nDotson, 544 U. S. 74 (2005). There, we held that prisoners\nwho sought new hearings for parole eligibility and suit\nability need not proceed in habeas. We acknowledged that\nthe two plaintiffs “hope[d]” their suits would “help bring\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)             13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nabout earlier release,” id., at 78, but concluded that the\n§1983 suit would not accomplish that without further\nproceedings. “Because neither prisoner’s claim would\nnecessarily spell speedier release, neither l[ay] at the core\nof habeas corpus.” Id., at 82 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Every Court of Appeals to consider the question\nsince Dotson has decided that because access to DNA\nevidence similarly does not “necessarily spell speedier\nrelease,” ibid., it can be sought under §1983. See 423\nF. 3d, at 1055–1056; Savory v. Lyons, 469 F. 3d 667, 672\n(CA7 2006); McKithen v. Brown, 481 F. 3d 89, 103, and n.\n15 (CA2 2007). On the other hand, the State argues that\nDotson is distinguishable because the challenged proce\ndures in that case did not affect the ultimate “exercise of\ndiscretion by the parole board.” Brief for Petitioners 32.\nIt also maintains that Dotson does not set forth “the exclu\nsive test for whether a prisoner may proceed under §1983.”\nBrief for Petitioners 32.\n   While we granted certiorari on this question, our resolu\ntion of Osborne’s claims does not require us to resolve this\ndifficult issue. Accordingly, we will assume without decid\ning that the Court of Appeals was correct that Heck does\nnot bar Osborne’s §1983 claim. Even under this assump\ntion, it was wrong to find a due process violation.\n                               IV \n\n                                A\n\n   “No State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or\nproperty, without due process of law.” U. S. Const., Amdt.\n14, §1; accord Amdt. 5. This Clause imposes procedural\nlimitations on a State’s power to take away protected\nentitlements. See, e.g., Jones v. Flowers, 547 U. S. 220,\n226–239 (2006). Osborne argues that access to the State’s\nevidence is a “process” needed to vindicate his right to\nprove himself innocent and get out of jail. Process is not\nan end in itself, so a necessary premise of this argument is\n14   DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                   DIST. v. OSBORNE\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nthat he has an entitlement (what our precedents call a\n“liberty interest”) to prove his innocence even after a fair\ntrial has proved otherwise. We must first examine this\nasserted liberty interest to determine what process (if any)\nis due. See Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408\nU. S. 564, 570–571 (1972); Olim v. Wakinekona, 461 U. S.\n238, 250–251 (1983).\n   In identifying his potential liberty interest, Osborne\nfirst attempts to rely on the Governor’s constitutional\nauthority to “grant pardons, commutations, and re\nprieves.” Alaska Const., Art. III, §21. That claim can be\nreadily disposed of. We have held that noncapital defen\ndants do not have a liberty interest in traditional state\nexecutive clemency, to which no particular claimant is\nentitled as a matter of state law. Connecticut Bd. of Par\ndons v. Dumschat, 452 U. S. 458, 464 (1981). Osborne\ntherefore cannot challenge the constitutionality of any\nprocedures available to vindicate an interest in state\nclemency.\n   Osborne does, however, have a liberty interest in dem\nonstrating his innocence with new evidence under state\nlaw. As explained, Alaska law provides that those who\nuse “newly discovered evidence” to “establis[h] by clear\nand convincing evidence that [they are] innocent” may\nobtain “vacation of [their] conviction or sentence in the\ninterest of justice.”      Alaska Stat. §§12.72.020(b)(2),\n12.72.010(4). This “state-created right can, in some cir\ncumstances, beget yet other rights to procedures essential\nto the realization of the parent right.” Dumschat, supra,\nat 463; see also Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539, 556–\n558 (1974).\n   The Court of Appeals went too far, however, in conclud\ning that the Due Process Clause requires that certain\nfamiliar preconviction trial rights be extended to protect\nOsborne’s postconviction liberty interest. After identifying\nOsborne’s possible liberty interests, the court concluded\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the State had an obligation to comply with the princi\nples of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83. In that case, we\nheld that due process requires a prosecutor to disclose\nmaterial exculpatory evidence to the defendant before\ntrial. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that nothing in\nour precedents suggested that this disclosure obligation\ncontinued after the defendant was convicted and the case\nwas closed, 521 F. 3d, at 1128, but it relied on prior Ninth\nCircuit precedent applying “Brady as a post-conviction\nright,” id., at 1128–1129 (citing Thomas v. Goldsmith, 979\nF. 2d 746, 749–750 (1992)). Osborne does not claim that\nBrady controls this case, Brief for Respondent 39–40, and\nwith good reason.\n   A criminal defendant proved guilty after a fair trial does\nnot have the same liberty interests as a free man. At trial,\nthe defendant is presumed innocent and may demand that\nthe government prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.\nBut “[o]nce a defendant has been afforded a fair trial and\nconvicted of the offense for which he was charged, the\npresumption of innocence disappears.” Herrera v. Collins,\n506 U. S. 390, 399 (1993). “Given a valid conviction, the\ncriminal defendant has been constitutionally deprived of\nhis liberty.” Dumschat, supra, at 464 (internal quotation\nmarks and alterations omitted).\n   The State accordingly has more flexibility in deciding\nwhat procedures are needed in the context of postconvic\ntion relief. “[W]hen a State chooses to offer help to those\nseeking relief from convictions,” due process does not\n“dictat[e] the exact form such assistance must assume.”\nPennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551, 559 (1987). Os\nborne’s right to due process is not parallel to a trial right,\nbut rather must be analyzed in light of the fact that he has\nalready been found guilty at a fair trial, and has only a\nlimited interest in postconviction relief. Brady is the\nwrong framework.\n   Instead, the question is whether consideration of Os\n16   DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                   DIST. v. OSBORNE\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nborne’s claim within the framework of the State’s proce\ndures for postconviction relief “offends some principle of\njustice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our\npeople as to be ranked as fundamental,” or “transgresses\nany recognized principle of fundamental fairness in opera\ntion.” Medina v. California, 505 U. S. 437, 446, 448 (1992)\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see Herrera, supra, at\n407–408 (applying Medina to postconviction relief for\nactual innocence); Finley, supra, at 556 (postconviction\nrelief procedures are constitutional if they “compor[t] with\nfundamental fairness”). Federal courts may upset a\nState’s postconviction relief procedures only if they are\nfundamentally inadequate to vindicate the substantive\nrights provided.\n   We see nothing inadequate about the procedures Alaska\nhas provided to vindicate its state right to postconviction\nrelief in general, and nothing inadequate about how those\nprocedures apply to those who seek access to DNA evi\ndence. Alaska provides a substantive right to be released\non a sufficiently compelling showing of new evidence that\nestablishes innocence. It exempts such claims from oth\nerwise applicable time limits. The State provides for\ndiscovery in postconviction proceedings, and has—through\njudicial decision—specified that this discovery procedure\nis available to those seeking access to DNA evidence.\nPatterson, 2006 WL 573797, at *4. These procedures are\nnot without limits. The evidence must indeed be newly\navailable to qualify under Alaska’s statute, must have\nbeen diligently pursued, and must also be sufficiently\nmaterial. These procedures are similar to those provided\nfor DNA evidence by federal law and the law of other\nStates, see, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §3600(a), and they are not\ninconsistent with the “traditions and conscience of our\npeople” or with “any recognized principle of fundamental\nfairness.” Medina, supra, at 446, 448 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   And there is more. While the Alaska courts have not\nhad occasion to conclusively decide the question, the\nAlaska Court of Appeals has suggested that the State\nConstitution provides an additional right of access to\nDNA. In expressing its “reluctan[ce] to hold that Alaska\nlaw offers no remedy” to those who belatedly seek DNA\ntesting, and in invoking the three-part test used by other\nstate courts, the court indicated that in an appropriate\ncase the State Constitution may provide a failsafe even for\nthose who cannot satisfy the statutory requirements under\ngeneral postconviction procedures. Osborne I, 110 P. 3d,\nat 995–996.\n   To the degree there is some uncertainty in the details of\nAlaska’s newly developing procedures for obtaining post\nconviction access to DNA, we can hardly fault the State for\nthat. Osborne has brought this §1983 action without ever\nusing these procedures in filing a state or federal habeas\nclaim relying on actual innocence. In other words, he has\nnot tried to use the process provided to him by the State or\nattempted to vindicate the liberty interest that is now the\ncenterpiece of his claim. When Osborne did request DNA\ntesting in state court, he sought RFLP testing that had\nbeen available at trial, not the STR testing he now seeks,\nand the state court relied on that fact in denying him\ntesting under Alaska law. Osborne I, supra, at 992 (“[T]he\nDNA testing that Osborne proposes to perform on this\nevidence existed at the time of Osborne’s trial”); Osborne\nII, 163 P. 3d, at 984 (Mannheimer, J., concurring) (“[T]he\nDNA testing [Osborne] proposes would not yield ‘new\nevidence’ for purposes of . . . [Alaska Stat. §12.72.010]”\nbecause it was “available at the time of Osborne’s trial”).\n   His attempt to sidestep state process through a new\nfederal lawsuit puts Osborne in a very awkward position.\nIf he simply seeks the DNA through the State’s discovery\nprocedures, he might well get it. If he does not, it may be\nfor a perfectly adequate reason, just as the federal statute\n18   DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                   DIST. v. OSBORNE\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nand all state statutes impose conditions and limits on\naccess to DNA evidence. It is difficult to criticize the\nState’s procedures when Osborne has not invoked them.\nThis is not to say that Osborne must exhaust state-law\nremedies. See Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla., 457 U. S.\n496, 500–501 (1982). But it is Osborne’s burden to dem\nonstrate the inadequacy of the state-law procedures avail\nable to him in state postconviction relief. Cf. Medina,\nsupra, at 453. These procedures are adequate on their\nface, and without trying them, Osborne can hardly com\nplain that they do not work in practice.\n  As a fallback, Osborne also obliquely relies on an as\nserted federal constitutional right to be released upon\nproof of “actual innocence.” Whether such a federal right\nexists is an open question. We have struggled with it over\nthe years, in some cases assuming, arguendo, that it exists\nwhile also noting the difficult questions such a right would\npose and the high standard any claimant would have to\nmeet. House, 547 U. S., at 554–555; Herrera, 506 U. S., at\n398–417; see also id., at 419–421 (O’Connor, J., concur\nring); id., at 427–428 (SCALIA, J., concurring); Friendly, Is\nInnocence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack on Criminal\nJudgments, 38 U. Chi. L. Rev. 142, 159, n. 87 (1970). In\nthis case too we can assume without deciding that such a\nclaim exists, because even if so there is no due process\nproblem. Osborne does not dispute that a federal actual\ninnocence claim (as opposed to a DNA access claim) would\nbe brought in habeas. Brief for Respondent 22–24. If such\na habeas claim is viable, federal procedural rules permit\ndiscovery “for good cause.” 28 U. S. C. §2254 Rule 6; Bracy\nv. Gramley, 520 U. S. 899, 908–909 (1997). Just as with\nstate law, Osborne cannot show that available discovery is\nfacially inadequate, and cannot show that it would be\narbitrarily denied to him.\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009) \n         19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              B\n\n   The Court of Appeals below relied only on procedural\ndue process, but Osborne seeks to defend the judgment on\nthe basis of substantive due process as well. He asks that\nwe recognize a freestanding right to DNA evidence\nuntethered from the liberty interests he hopes to vindicate\nwith it. We reject the invitation and conclude, in the\ncircumstances of this case, that there is no such substan\ntive due process right. “As a general matter, the Court\nhas always been reluctant to expand the concept of sub\nstantive due process because guideposts for responsible\ndecisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce and\nopen-ended.” Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125\n(1992). Osborne seeks access to state evidence so that he\ncan apply new DNA-testing technology that might prove\nhim innocent. There is no long history of such a right, and\n“[t]he mere novelty of such a claim is reason enough to\ndoubt that ‘substantive due process’ sustains it.” Reno v.\nFlores, 507 U. S. 292, 303 (1993).\n   And there are further reasons to doubt. The elected\ngovernments of the States are actively confronting the\nchallenges DNA technology poses to our criminal justice\nsystems and our traditional notions of finality, as well as\nthe opportunities it affords. To suddenly constitutionalize\nthis area would short-circuit what looks to be a prompt\nand considered legislative response. The first DNA testing\nstatutes were passed in 1994 and 1997. Act of Aug. 2,\n1994, ch. 737, 1994 N. Y. Laws 3709 (codified at N. Y.\nCrim. Proc. Law Ann. §440.30(1–a) (West)); Act of May 9,\n1997, Pub. Act No. 90–141, 1997 Ill. Laws 2461 (codified at\n725 Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 725, §5/116–3(a) (West)). In the\npast decade, 44 States and the Federal Government have\nfollowed suit, reflecting the increased availability of DNA\ntesting. As noted, Alaska itself is considering such legisla\ntion. See supra, at 9. “By extending constitutional protec\ntion to an asserted right or liberty interest, we, to a great\nextent, place the matter outside the arena of public debate\n20    DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                    DIST. v. OSBORNE\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nand legislative action. We must therefore exercise the\nutmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground\nin this field.” Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 720 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). “[J]udicial imposition of a\ncategorical remedy . . . might pretermit other responsible\nsolutions being considered in Congress and state legisla\ntures.” Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U. S. 1, 14 (1989)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment). If we extended\nsubstantive due process to this area, we would cast these\nstatutes into constitutional doubt and be forced to take\nover the issue of DNA access ourselves. We are reluctant\nto enlist the Federal Judiciary in creating a new constitu\ntional code of rules for handling DNA.4\n   Establishing a freestanding right to access DNA evi\ndence for testing would force us to act as policymakers,\nand our substantive-due-process rulemaking authority\nwould not only have to cover the right of access but a\nmyriad of other issues. We would soon have to decide if\nthere is a constitutional obligation to preserve forensic\nevidence that might later be tested. Cf. Arizona v.\nYoungblood, 488 U. S. 51, 56–58 (1988). If so, for how\nlong? Would it be different for different types of evidence?\nWould the State also have some obligation to gather such\nevidence in the first place? How much, and when? No\ndoubt there would be a miscellany of other minor direc\ntives. See, e.g., Harvey v. Horan, 285 F. 3d 298, 300–301\n(CA4 2002) (Wilkinson, C. J., concurring in denial of\nrehearing).\n——————\n  4 The  dissent asserts that our position “resembles” Justice Harlan’s\ndissent in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). Post, at 15–16,\nn. 10 (opinion of STEVENS, J.). Miranda devised rules to safeguard a\nconstitutional right the Court had already recognized. Indeed, the\nunderlying requirement at issue in that case that confessions be volun\ntary had “roots” going back centuries. Dickerson v. United States, 530\nU. S. 428, 432–433 (2000). In contrast, the asserted right to access\nDNA evidence is unrooted in history or tradition, and would thrust the\nFederal Judiciary into an area previously left to state courts and\nlegislatures.\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  In this case, the evidence has already been gathered and\npreserved, but if we extend substantive due process to this\narea, these questions would be before us in short order,\nand it is hard to imagine what tools federal courts would\nuse to answer them. At the end of the day, there is no\nreason to suppose that their answers to these questions\nwould be any better than those of state courts and legisla\ntures, and good reason to suspect the opposite. See\nCollins, supra, at 125; Glucksberg, supra, at 720.\n                         *     *    *\n   DNA evidence will undoubtedly lead to changes in the\ncriminal justice system. It has done so already. The\nquestion is whether further change will primarily be made\nby legislative revision and judicial interpretation of the\nexisting system, or whether the Federal Judiciary must\nleap ahead—revising (or even discarding) the system by\ncreating a new constitutional right and taking over re\nsponsibility for refining it.\n   Federal courts should not presume that state criminal\nprocedures will be inadequate to deal with technological\nchange. The criminal justice system has historically\naccommodated new types of evidence, and is a time-tested\nmeans of carrying out society’s interest in convicting the\nguilty while respecting individual rights. That system,\nlike any human endeavor, cannot be perfect. DNA evi\ndence shows that it has not been. But there is no basis for\nOsborne’s approach of assuming that because DNA has\nshown that these procedures are not flawless, DNA evi\ndence must be treated as categorically outside the process,\nrather than within it. That is precisely what his §1983\nsuit seeks to do, and that is the contention we reject.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

Defense\ncounsel explained that this decision was made based on\nfear that the testing would provide further evidence of\nrespondent’s guilt. After conviction, in an unsuccessful\nattempt to obtain parole, respondent confessed in detail to\nthe crime. Now, respondent claims that he has a federal\nconstitutional right to test the sample and that he can go\ndirectly to federal court to obtain this relief without giving\nthe Alaska courts a full opportunity to consider his claim.\n   I agree with the Court’s resolution of respondent’s con\nstitutional claim. In my view, that claim also fails for two\nindependent reasons beyond those given by the majority.\nFirst, a state prisoner asserting a federal constitutional\nright to perform such testing must file a petition for a writ\nof habeas corpus, not an action under 42 U. S. C. §1983, as\nrespondent did here, and thus must exhaust state reme\ndies, see 28 U. S. C. §2254(b)(1)(A). Second, even though\nrespondent did not exhaust his state remedies, his claim\nmay be rejected on the merits, see §2254(b)(2), because a\n2    DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                   DIST. v. OSBORNE\n                   ALITO, J., concurring\n\ndefendant who declines the opportunity to perform DNA\ntesting at trial for tactical reasons has no constitutional\nright to perform such testing after conviction.\n                              I\n   As our prior opinions illustrate, it is sometimes difficult\nto draw the line between claims that are properly brought\nin habeas and those that may be brought under 42 U. S. C.\n§1983. See Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475 (1973);\nHeck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477 (1994); Wilkinson v.\nDotson, 544 U. S. 74 (2005). But I think that this case\nfalls on the habeas side of the line.\n   We have long recognized the principles of federalism\nand comity at stake when state prisoners attempt to use\nthe federal courts to attack their final convictions. See,\ne.g., Darr v. Burford, 339 U. S. 200, 204 (1950); Braden v.\n30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky., 410 U. S. 484, 490–491\n(1973); Preiser, supra, at 491–492; Rose v. Lundy, 455\nU. S. 509, 518–519 (1982); Rhines v. Weber, 544 U. S. 269,\n273–274 (2005). We accordingly held that “ ‘it would be\nunseemly in our dual system of government for a federal\ndistrict court to upset a state court conviction without an\nopportunity to the state courts to correct a constitutional\nviolation.’ ” Lundy, supra, at 518 (quoting Darr, supra, at\n204). Congress subsequently codified Lundy’s exhaustion\nrequirement in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. §2254(b)(1)(A).\n   We also have long recognized the need to impose sharp\nlimits on state prisoners’ efforts to bypass state courts\nwith their discovery requests. See, e.g., Wainwright v.\nSykes, 433 U. S. 72, 87–90 (1977); Keeney v. Tamayo-\nReyes, 504 U. S. 1, 8–10 (1992); Williams v. Taylor, 529\nU. S. 420, 436 (2000). For example, we have held that\n“concerns of finality, comity, judicial economy, and chan\nneling the resolution of claims into the most appropriate\nforum” require a state prisoner to show “cause-and\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nprejudice” before asking a federal habeas court to hold an\nevidentiary hearing. Keeney, supra, at 8. That result\nreduces opportunities for “ ‘sandbagging’ on the part of\ndefense lawyers,” Sykes, supra, at 89, and it “reduces the\n‘inevitable friction’ that results when a federal habeas\ncourt ‘overturns either the factual or legal conclusions\nreached by the state-court system,’ ” Keeney, supra, at 9\n(quoting Sumner v. Mata, 449 U. S. 539, 550 (1981); brack\nets omitted). Congress subsequently codified Keeney’s\ncause-and-prejudice rule in AEDPA, 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(e)(2).\n   The rules set forth in our cases and codified in AEDPA\nwould mean very little if state prisoners could simply\nevade them through artful pleading. For example, I take\nit as common ground that a state prisoner’s claim under\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), must be brought\nin habeas because that claim, if proved, would invalidate\nthe judgment of conviction or sentence (and thus the\nlawfulness of the inmate’s confinement). See Heck, supra,\nat 481. But under respondent’s view, I see no reason why\na Brady claimant could not bypass the state courts and file\na §1983 claim in federal court, contending that he has a\ndue process right to search the State’s files for exculpatory\nevidence. Allowing such a maneuver would violate the\nprinciples embodied in Lundy, Keeney, and AEDPA.\n   Although respondent has now recharacterized his claim\nin an effort to escape the requirement of proceeding in\nhabeas, in his complaint he squarely alleged that the\nState “deprived [him] of access to exculpatory evidence in\nviolation of Brady[, supra], and the Due Process Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution.”\nApp. 37. That allegedly “exculpatory” evidence—which\nBrady defines as “evidence favorable to [the] accused” and\n“material either to guilt or to punishment,” 373 U. S., at\n87—would, by definition, undermine respondent’s “guilt”\nor “punishment” if his allegations are true. Such claims\n4       DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                      DIST. v. OSBORNE\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\nshould be brought in habeas, see Heck, supra, at 481, and\nrespondent cannot avoid that result by attempting to\nbring his claim under §1983, see Dotson, supra, at 92\n(KENNEDY, J., dissenting).1\n  It is no answer to say, as respondent does, that he sim\nply wants to use §1983 as a discovery tool to lay the foun\ndation for a future state postconviction application, a state\nclemency petition, or a request for relief by means of\n“prosecutorial consent.” See Brief for Respondent 23.\nSuch tactics implicate precisely the same federalism and\ncomity concerns that motivated our decisions (and Con\ngress’) to impose exhaustion requirements and discovery\nlimits in federal habeas proceedings. If a petitioner can\nevade the habeas statute’s exhaustion requirements in\nthis way, I see no reason why a state prisoner asserting an\nordinary Brady claim—i.e., a state prisoner who claims\nthat the prosecution failed to turn over exculpatory evi\ndence prior to trial—could not follow the same course.\n  What respondent seeks was accurately described in his\ncomplaint—the discovery of evidence that has a material\nbearing on his conviction. Such a claim falls within “the\ncore” of habeas. Preiser, supra, at 489. Recognition of a\nconstitutional right to postconviction scientific testing of\nevidence in the possession of the prosecution would repre\nsent an expansion of Brady and a broadening of the dis\ncovery rights now available to habeas petitioners. See 28\n——————\n    1 This\n         case is quite different from Dotson. In that case, two state\nprisoners filed §1983 actions challenging the constitutionality of Ohio’s\nparole procedures and seeking “a new parole hearing that may or may\nnot result in release, prescription of the composition of the hearing\npanel, and specification of the procedures to be followed.” 544 U. S., at\n86 (SCALIA, J., concurring). Regardless of whether such remedies fall\noutside the authority of federal habeas judges, compare id., at 86–87,\nwith id., at 88–92 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting), there is no question that\nthe relief respondent seeks in this case—“exculpatory” evidence that\ntends to prove his innocence—lies “within the core of habeas corpus,”\nPreiser v.

The pace of the legis\nlative response has been so fast that two States have enacted statutes\nwhile this case was sub judice: The Governor of South Dakota signed a\nDNA access law on March 11, 2009, see H. R. 1166, and the Governor of\nMississippi signed a DNA access law on March 16, 2009, see S. 2709.\nThe only States that do not have DNA-testing statutes are Alabama,\nAlaska, Massachusetts, and Oklahoma; and at least three of those\nStates have addressed the issue through judicial decisions. See Fagan\nv. State, 957 So. 2d 1159 (Ala. Crim. App. 2007); Osborne v. State, 110\nP. 3d 986, 995 (Alaska App. 2005) (Osborne I); Commonwealth v.\nDonald, 66 Mass. App. 1110, 848 N. E. 2d 447 (2006). Because the\nCourt relies on such evidence, JUSTICE STEVENS accuses it of “re\nsembl[ing]” Justice Harlan’s position in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S.\n436 (1966). See post, at 15, n. 10 (quoting 384 U. S., at 523–524 (dis\nsenting opinion)).

First, DNA testing—\neven when performed with modern STR technology, and\neven when performed in perfect accordance with proto\ncols—often fails to provide “absolute proof” of anything.\nPost, at 12 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). As one scholar has\nobserved:\n    “[F]orensic DNA testing rarely occurs [under] idyllic\n    conditions. Crime scene DNA samples do not come\n    from a single source obtained in immaculate condi\n    tions; they are messy assortments of multiple un\n    known persons, often collected in the most difficult\n    conditions. The samples can be of poor quality due to\n    exposure to heat, light, moisture, or other degrading\n    elements. They can be of minimal or insufficient\n    quantity, especially as investigators push DNA test\n    ing to its limits and seek profiles from a few cells re\n    trieved from cigarette butts, envelopes, or soda cans.\n    And most importantly, forensic samples often consti\n    tute a mixture of multiple persons, such that it is not\n    clear whose profile is whose, or even how many pro\n    files are in the sample at all. All of these factors make\n    DNA testing in the forensic context far more subjec\n    tive than simply reporting test results . . . .” Murphy,\n    The Art in the Science of DNA: A Layperson’s Guide\n    to the Subjectivity Inherent in Forensic DNA Typing,\n    58 Emory L. J. 489, 497 (2008) (footnotes omitted).\nSee also R. Michaelis, R. Flanders, & P. Wulff, A Litiga\ntor’s Guide to DNA 341 (2008) (hereinafter Michaelis)\n(noting that even “STR analyses are plagued by issues of\nsuboptimal samples, equipment malfunctions and human\nerror, just as any other type of forensic DNA test”); Harvey\nv. Horan, 278 F. 3d 370, 383, n. 4 (CA4 2002) (King, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment) (noting\nthat the first STR DNA test performed under Virginia’s\n8    DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                   DIST. v. OSBORNE\n                   ALITO, J., concurring\n\npostconviction DNA access statute was inconclusive).\nSuch concerns apply with particular force where, as here,\nthe sample is minuscule, it may contain three or more\npersons’ DNA, and it may have degraded significantly\nduring the 24 or more hours it took police to recover it.\n   Second, the State has important interests in maintain\ning the integrity of its evidence, and the risks associated\nwith evidence contamination increase every time someone\nattempts to extract new DNA from a sample. According to\nProfessor John Butler—who is said to have written “the\ncanonical text on forensic DNA typing,” Murphy, supra, at\n493, n. 16—“[t]he extraction process is probably where the\nDNA sample is more susceptible to contamination in the\nlaboratory than at any other time in the forensic DNA\nanalysis process,” J. Butler, Forensic DNA Typing 42 (2d\ned. 2005).\n   Indeed, modern DNA testing technology is so powerful\nthat it actually increases the risks associated with mis\nhandling evidence. STR tests, for example, are so sensi\ntive that they can detect DNA transferred from person X\nto a towel (with which he wipes his face), from the towel to\nY (who subsequently wipes his face), and from Y’s face to a\nmurder weapon later wielded by Z (who can use STR\ntechnology to blame X for the murder). See Michaelis 62–\n64; Thompson, Ford, Doom, Raymer, & Krane, Evaluating\nForensic DNA Evidence: Essential Elements of a Compe\ntent Defense Review (Part 2), The Champion, May 2003,\npp. 25–26. Any test that is sensitive enough to pick up\nsuch trace amounts of DNA will be able to detect even the\nslightest, unintentional mishandling of evidence. See\nMichaelis 63 (cautioning against mishandling evidence\nbecause “two research groups have already demonstrated\nthe ability to obtain STR profiles from fingerprints on\npaper or evidence objects”). And that is to say nothing of\nthe intentional DNA-evidence-tampering scandals that\nhave surfaced in recent years. See, e.g., Murphy, The New\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

Rev.\n721, 772–773 (2007) (collecting examples). It gives short\nshrift to such risks to suggest that anyone—including\nrespondent, who has twice confessed to his crime, has\nnever recanted, and passed up the opportunity for DNA\ntesting at trial—should be given a never-before-recognized\nconstitutional right to rummage through the State’s ge\nnetic-evidence locker.\n   Third, even if every test was guaranteed to provide a\nconclusive answer, and even if no one ever contaminated a\nDNA sample, that still would not justify disregarding the\nother costs associated with the DNA-access regime pro\nposed by respondent. As the Court notes, recognizing a\nprisoner’s freestanding right to access the State’s DNA\nevidence would raise numerous policy questions, not the\nleast of which is whether and to what extent the State is\nconstitutionally obligated to collect and preserve such\nevidence. See ante, at 20. But the policy problems do not\nend there.\n   Even without our creation and imposition of a manda\ntory-DNA-access regime, state crime labs are already\nresponsible for maintaining and controlling hundreds of\nthousands of new DNA samples every year. For example,\nin the year 2005, the State of North Carolina processed\nDNA samples in approximately 1,900 cases, while the\nState of Virginia processed twice as many. See Office of\nState Budget and Management, Cost Study of DNA Test\ning and Analysis As Directed by Session Law 2005–267,\nSection 15.8, pp. 5, 8 (Mar. 1, 2006) (hereinafter North\nCarolina Study), http://www.osbm.state.nc.us/files/pdf_\nfiles/3-1-2006FinalDNAReport.pdf (all Internet materials\nas visited June 16, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court’s\ncase file); see also id., at 8 (noting that the State of Iowa\nprocessed DNA samples in 1,500 cases in that year). Each\ncase often entails many separate DNA samples. See\n10   DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                   DIST. v. OSBORNE\n                   ALITO, J., concurring\n\nWisconsin Criminal Justice Study Commission, Position\nPaper: “Decreasing the Turnaround Time for DNA Test\ning,” p. 2 (hereinafter Wisconsin Study), http://www.wcjsc.\norg/WCJSC_Report_on_DNA_Backlog.pdf (“An average\ncase consists of 8 samples”). And these data—which are\nnow four years out of date—dramatically underestimate\nthe States’ current DNA-related caseloads, which expand\nat an average annual rate of around 24%. See Wisconsin\nDept. of Justice, Review of State Crime Lab Resources for\nDNA Analysis 6 (Feb. 12, 2007), http://www.doj.state.\nwi.us/news/files/dnaanalysisplan.pdf.\n  The resources required to process and analyze these\nhundreds of thousands of samples have created severe\nbacklogs in state crime labs across the country. For ex\nample, the State of Wisconsin reports that it receives\nroughly 17,600 DNA samples per year, but its labs can\nprocess only 9,600. Wisconsin Study 2. Similarly, the\nState of North Carolina reports that “[i]t is not unusual for\nthe [State] Crime Lab to have several thousand samples\nwaiting to be outsourced due to the federal procedures for\n[the State’s] grant. This is not unique to North Carolina\nbut a national issue.” North Carolina Study 9.\n  The procedures that the state labs use to handle these\nhundreds of thousands of DNA samples provide fertile\nground for litigation. For example, in Commonwealth v.\nDuarte, 56 Mass. App. 714, 723, 780 N. E. 2d 99, 106\n(2002), the defendant argued that “the use of a thermome\nter that may have been overdue for a standardization\ncheck rendered the DNA analysis unreliable and inadmis\nsible” in his trial for raping a 13-year-old girl. The court\nrejected that argument and held “that the status of the\nthermometer went to the weight of the evidence, and not\nto its admissibility,” id., at 724, 780 N. E. 2d, at 106, and\nthe court ultimately upheld Duarte’s conviction after\nreviewing the testimony of the deputy director of the\nlaboratory that the Commonwealth used for the DNA\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\ntests, see ibid. But the case nevertheless illustrates “that\nno detail of laboratory operation, no matter how minute, is\nexempt as a potential point on which a defense attorney\nwill question the DNA evidence.” Michaelis 68; see also\nid., at 68–69 (discussing the policy implications of Duarte).\n   My point in recounting the burdens that postconviction\nDNA testing imposes on the Federal Government and the\nStates is not to denigrate the importance of such testing.\nInstead, my point is that requests for postconviction DNA\ntesting are not cost free. The Federal Government and the\nStates have a substantial interest in the implementation\nof rules that regulate such testing in a way that harnesses\nthe unique power of DNA testing while also respecting the\nimportant governmental interests noted above. The Fed\neral Government and the States have moved expeditiously\nto enact rules that attempt to perform this role. And as\nthe Court holds, it would be most unwise for this Court,\nwielding the blunt instrument of due process, to interfere\nprematurely with these efforts.\n                              B\n   I see no reason for such intervention in the present case.\nWhen a criminal defendant, for tactical purposes, passes\nup the opportunity for DNA testing at trial, that defen\ndant, in my judgment, has no constitutional right to de\nmand to perform DNA testing after conviction. Recogni\ntion of such a right would allow defendants to play games\nwith the criminal justice system. A guilty defendant could\nforgo DNA testing at trial for fear that the results would\nconfirm his guilt, and in the hope that the other evidence\nwould be insufficient to persuade the jury to find him\nguilty. Then, after conviction, with nothing to lose, the\ndefendant could demand DNA testing in the hope that\nsome happy accident—for example, degradation or con\ntamination of the evidence—would provide the basis for\nseeking postconviction relief. Denying the opportunity for\n12    DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                    DIST. v.

At trial, respondent’s\nlawyer made an explicit, tactical decision to forgo restric\ntion-fragment-length-polymorphism (RFLP) testing in\nfavor of less-reliable DQ Alpha testing. Having forgone\nmore accurate DNA testing once before, respondent’s\nreasons for seeking it now are suspect. It is true that the\nSTR testing respondent now seeks is even more advanced\nthan the RFLP testing he declined—but his counsel did\nnot decline RFLP testing because she thought it was not\ngood enough; she declined because she thought it was too\ngood.

See\nVermont v. Brillon, 556 U.

For example, the federal\nstatute provides that a prisoner’s declination of DNA testing at trial\nbars a request for postconviction testing only if the prisoner knowingly\nand voluntarily waived that right in a proceeding occurring after the\nenactment of the federal statute. 18 U. S. C. §3600(a)(3)(A)(i). But\nAlaska has specifically decided to retain the general rule regarding the\nauthority of defense counsel. See Osborne I, supra, at 991–992 (citing\nSimeon v. State, 90 P. 3d 181, 184 (Alaska App. 2004)).\n   5 JUSTICE STEVENS is quite wrong to suggest that the application of\n\nthis familiar principle in the present context somehow lessens the\nprosecution’s burden to prove a defendant’s guilt. Post, at 12, n. 8\n(citing Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U. S. 510 (1979); In re Winship, 397\nU. S. 358 (1970)). Respondent is not challenging the sufficiency of the\nState’s evidence at trial. Rather, he claims that he has a right to obtain\nevidence that may be useful to him in a variety of postconviction\nproceedings. The principle that the prosecution must prove its case\nbeyond a reasonable doubt and the principle that a defendant has no\nobligation to prove his innocence are not implicated in any way by the\nissues in this case.\n14   DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                   DIST. v.

If not, Osborne has needlessly spent decades\nbehind bars while the true culprit has not been brought to\njustice. The DNA test Osborne seeks is a simple one, its\ncost modest, and its results uniquely precise. Yet for\nreasons the State has been unable or unwilling to articu­\nlate, it refuses to allow Osborne to test the evidence at his\nown expense and to thereby ascertain the truth once and\nfor all.\n   On two equally problematic grounds, the Court today\nblesses the State’s arbitrary denial of the evidence Os­\nborne seeks. First, while acknowledging that Osborne\nmay have a due process right to access the evidence under\nAlaska’s postconviction procedures, the Court concludes\nthat Osborne has not yet availed himself of all possible\navenues for relief in state court.1 As both a legal and\n——————\n 1 Because   the Court assumes arguendo that Osborne’s claim was\n2     DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL \n\n                     DIST. v.

More\ntroubling still, based on a fundamental mischaracteriza­\ntion of the right to liberty that Osborne seeks to vindicate,\nthe Court refuses to acknowledge “in the circumstances of\nthis case” any right to access the evidence that is grounded\nin the Due Process Clause itself. Because I am convinced\nthat Osborne has a constitutional right of access to the\nevidence he wishes to test and that, on the facts of this\ncase, he has made a sufficient showing of entitlement to\nthat evidence, I would affirm the decision of the Court of\nAppeals.\n                              I\n  The Fourteenth Amendment provides that “[n]o State\nshall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,\nwithout due process of law.” §1.

Austin, 545 U. S. 209, 221 (2005). Osborne\ncontends that he possesses a right to access DNA evidence\narising from both these sources.\n  Osborne first anchors his due process right in Alaska\nStat. §12.72.010(4) (2008).

The problem is that\nthe newly discovered evidence he wishes to present cannot\nbe generated unless he is first able to access the State’s\nevidence—something he cannot do without the State’s\nconsent or a court order.\n  Although States are under no obligation to provide\nmechanisms for postconviction relief, when they choose to\ndo so, the procedures they employ must comport with the\ndemands of the Due Process Clause, see Evitts v. Lucey,\n469 U. S. 387, 393 (1985), by providing litigants with fair\nopportunity to assert their state-created rights. Osborne\ncontends that by denying him an opportunity to access the\nphysical evidence, the State has denied him meaningful\naccess to state postconviction relief, thereby violating his\nright to due process.\n  Although the majority readily agrees that Osborne has a\nprotected liberty interest in demonstrating his innocence\nwith new evidence under Alaska Stat. §12.72.010(4), see\nante, at 14, it rejects the Ninth Circuit’s conclusion that\nOsborne is constitutionally entitled to access the State’s\nevidence.

Under that standard, Alaska’s procedures for\nbringing a claim under §12.72.010(4) will not be found to\nviolate due process unless they “ ‘offen[d] some principle of\njustice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our\npeople as to be ranked as fundamental,’ or ‘transgres[s]\nany recognized principle of fundamental fairness in opera­\ntion.’ ” Ante, at 16 (quoting Medina, 505 U. S., at 446,\n448).3 After conducting a cursory review of the relevant\nstatutory text, the Court concludes that Alaska’s proce­\ndures are constitutional on their face.\n   While I agree that the statute is not facially deficient,\nthe state courts’ application of §12.72.010(4) raises serious\nquestions whether the State’s procedures are fundamen­\ntally unfair in their operation. As an initial matter, it is\nnot clear that Alaskan courts ordinarily permit litigants to\nutilize the state postconviction statute to obtain new\nevidence in the form of DNA tests. The majority assumes\nthat such discovery is possible based on a single, unpub­\nlished, nonprecedential decision from the Alaska Court of\nAppeals, see ante, at 16 (citing Patterson v. State, No. A–\n8814 (Mar. 8, 2006)), but the State concedes that no liti­\ngant yet has obtained evidence for such testing under the\nstatute.4\n   Of even greater concern is the manner in which the\nstate courts applied §12.72.010(4) to the facts of this case.\n——————\n  3 Osborne contends that the Court should assess the validity of the\n\nState’s procedures under the test set forth in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424\nU. S. 319 (1976), rather than the more exacting test adopted by Medina\nv. California, 505 U. S. 437 (1992). In my view, we need not decide\nwhich standard governs because the state court’s denial of access to the\nevidence Osborne seeks violates due process under either standard. See\nHarvey, 285 F. 3d, at 315 (Luttig, J).\n  4 The State explained at oral argument that such testing was ordered\n\nin the Patterson case, but by the time access was granted, the relevant\nevidence had been destroyed.

See Osborne v. State,\n110 P. 3d 986, 992 (2005) (Osborne I). In his arguments\nbefore the state trial court and his briefs to the Alaska\nCourt of Appeals, however, Osborne had plainly requested\nSTR DNA testing, a form of DNA testing not yet in use at\nthe time of his trial.

The state appellate court’s\nconclusion that the requested testing had been available\nat the time of trial was therefore clearly erroneous.5\nGiven these facts, the majority’s assertion that Osborne\n“attempt[ed] to sidestep state process” by failing “to use\nthe process provided to him by the State” is unwarranted.\nAnte, at 17.\n   The same holds true with respect to the majority’s sug­\ngestion that the Alaska Constitution might provide addi­\ntional protections to Osborne above and beyond those\nafforded under afforded under §12.72.010(4). In Osborne’s\nstate postconviction proceedings, the Alaska Court of\nAppeals held out the possibility that even when evidence\ndoes not meet the requirements of §12.72.010(4), the State\nConstitution might offer relief to a defendant who is able\nto make certain threshold showings. See Osborne I, 110\nP. 3d, at 995–996. On remand from that decision, how­\never, the state trial court denied Osborne relief on the\nground that he failed to show that (1) his conviction rested\nprimarily on eyewitness identification; (2) there was a\ndemonstrable doubt concerning his identity as the perpe­\n——————\n  5 The majority avoids confronting this serious flaw in the state court’s\n\ndecision by treating its mistaken characterization of the nature of\nOsborne’s request as if it were binding.

The first two reasons\nreduce to an evaluation of the strength of the prosecution’s\noriginal case—a consideration that carries little weight\nwhen balanced against evidence as powerfully dispositive\nas an exculpatory DNA test. The final reason offered by\nthe state court—that further testing would not be conclu­\nsive on the issue of Osborne’s guilt or innocence—is surely\na relevant factor in deciding whether to release evidence\nfor DNA testing. Nevertheless, the state court’s conclu­\nsion that such testing would not be conclusive in this case\nis indefensible, as evidenced by the State’s recent conces­\nsion on that point. See also 521 F. 3d 1118, 1136–1139\n(CA9 2008) (detailing why the facts of this case do not\npermit an inference that any exonerating test result would\nbe less than conclusive).\n   Osborne made full use of available state procedures in\nhis efforts to secure access to evidence for DNA testing so\nthat he might avail himself of the postconviction relief\nafforded by the State of Alaska. He was rebuffed at every\nturn. The manner in which the Alaska courts applied\nstate law in this case leaves me in grave doubt about the\nadequacy of the procedural protections afforded to liti­\ngants under Alaska Stat. §12.72.010(4), and provides\nstrong reason to doubt the majority’s flippant assertion\nthat if Osborne were “simply [to] see[k] the DNA through\nthe State’s discovery procedures, he might well get it.”\nAnte, at 17.

Whether\nframed as a “substantive liberty interest . . . protected\nthrough a procedural due process right” to have evidence\nmade available for testing, or as a substantive due process\nright to be free of arbitrary government action, see Harvey\nv. Horan, 285 F. 3d 298, 315, 319 (CA4 2002) (Luttig, J.,\nrespecting denial of rehearing en banc),6 the result is the\nsame: On the record now before us, Osborne has estab­\nlished his entitlement to test the State’s evidence.\n   The liberty protected by the Due Process Clause is not a\ncreation of the Bill of Rights. Indeed, our Nation has long\nrecognized that the liberty safeguarded by the Constitu­\ntion has far deeper roots. See Declaration of Independence\n¶2 (holding it self-evident that “all men are. . . endowed by\ntheir Creator with certain unalienable Rights,” among\nwhich are “Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness”);\nsee also Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215, 230 (1976)\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting). The “most elemental” of the\nliberties protected by the Due Process Clause is “the inter­\nest in being free from physical detention by one’s own\ngovernment.” Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, 529\n(2004) (plurality opinion); see Foucha v. Louisiana, 504\nU. S. 71, 80 (1992) (“Freedom from bodily restraint has\nalways been at the core of the liberty protected by the Due\nProcess Clause”).\n   Although a valid criminal conviction justifies punitive\ndetention, it does not entirely eliminate the liberty inter­\nests of convicted persons.

Our cases have recognized protected\ninterests in a variety of postconviction contexts, extending\nsubstantive constitutional protections to state prisoners on\nthe premise that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment requires States to respect certain fundamen­\ntal liberties in the postconviction context. See, e.g.,\nThornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U. S. 401, 407 (1989) (right to\nfree speech); Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 84 (1987)\n(right to marry); Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.

S.\n483 (1969) (right to petition government for redress of\ngrievances). It is therefore far too late in the day to ques­\ntion the basic proposition that convicted persons such as\nOsborne retain a constitutionally protected measure of\ninterest in liberty, including the fundamental liberty of\nfreedom from physical restraint.\n   Recognition of this right draws strength from the fact\nthat 46 States and the Federal Government have passed\nstatutes providing access to evidence for DNA testing, and\n3 additional states (including Alaska) provide similar\naccess through court-made rules alone, see Brief for State\nof California et al. as Amici Curiae 3–4, n. 1, and 2; ante,\nat 9. These legislative developments are consistent with\nrecent trends in legal ethics recognizing that prosecutors\nare obliged to disclose all forms of exculpatory evidence\nthat come into their possession following conviction. See,\ne.g., ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct 3.8(g)–(h)\n(2008); see also Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.

The fact\nthat nearly all the States have now recognized some post­\nconviction right to DNA evidence makes it more, not less,\nappropriate to recognize a limited federal right to such\nevidence in cases where litigants are unfairly barred from\nobtaining relief in state court.\n   Insofar as it is process Osborne seeks, he is surely enti­\ntled to less than “the full panoply of rights,” that would be\ndue a criminal defendant prior to conviction, see Morrissey\nv. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471, 480 (1972). That does not mean,\nhowever, that our pretrial due process cases have no rele­\nvance in the postconviction context. In Brady v. Mary\nland, 373 U. S. 83, 87 (1963), we held that the State vio­\nlates due process when it suppresses “evidence favorable\nto an accused” that is “material either to guilt or to pun­\nishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the\nprosecution.” Although Brady does not directly provide for\na postconviction right to such evidence, the concerns with\nfundamental fairness that motivated our decision in that\ncase are equally present when convicted persons such as\nOsborne seek access to dispositive DNA evidence following\nconviction.\n   Recent scientific advances in DNA analysis have made\n“it literally possible to confirm guilt or innocence beyond\nany question whatsoever, at least in some categories of\ncases.” Harvey, 285 F. 3d, at 305 (Luttig, J.). As the\nCourt recognizes today, the powerful new evidence that\nmodern DNA testing can provide is “unlike anything\nknown before.” Ante, at 8. Discussing these important\nforensic developments in his oft-cited opinion in Harvey,\nJudge Luttig explained that although “no one would con­\ntend that fairness, in the constitutional sense, requires a\npost-conviction right of access or a right to disclosure\nanything approaching in scope that which is required pre­\ntrial,” in cases “where the government holds previously­\n10   DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                    DIST. v.

It does so “out of recognition\nof the same systemic interests in fairness and ultimate\ntruth.” Ibid.\n   Observing that the DNA evidence in this case would be\nso probative of Osborne’s guilt or innocence that it exceeds\nthe materiality standard that governs the disclosure of\nevidence under Brady, the Ninth Circuit granted Os­\nborne’s request for access to the State’s evidence. See 521\nF. 3d, at 1134. In doing so, the Court of Appeals recog­\nnized that Osborne possesses a narrow right of postconvic­\ntion access to biological evidence for DNA testing “where\n[such] evidence was used to secure his conviction, the DNA\ntesting is to be conducted using methods that were un­\navailable at the time of trial and are far more precise than\nthe methods that were then available, such methods are\ncapable of conclusively determining whether Osborne is\nthe source of the genetic material, the testing can be con­\nducted without cost or prejudice to the State, and the\nevidence is material to available forms of post-conviction\nrelief.” Id., at 1142. That conclusion does not merit\nreversal.\n   If the right Osborne seeks to vindicate is framed as\npurely substantive, the proper result is no less clear. “The\ntouchstone of due process is protection of the individual\nagainst arbitrary action of government,” Meachum, 427\nU. S., at 226 (internal quotation marks omitted); Wolff,\n418 U. S., at 558; County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523\nU. S. 833, 845–846 (1998).

In my view, the\nState’s refusal to provide Osborne with access to evidence\nfor DNA testing qualifies as arbitrary.\n   Throughout the course of state and federal litigation,\nthe State has failed to provide any concrete reason for\ndenying Osborne the DNA testing he seeks, and none is\napparent. Because Osborne has offered to pay for the\ntests, cost is not a factor. And as the State now concedes,\nthere is no reason to doubt that such testing would provide\nconclusive confirmation of Osborne’s guilt or revelation of\nhis innocence.7 In the courts below, the State refused to\nprovide an explanation for its refusal to permit testing of\nthe evidence, see Brief for Respondent 33, and in this\nCourt, its explanation has been, at best, unclear. Insofar\nas the State has articulated any reason at all, it appears to\nbe a generalized interest in protecting the finality of the\njudgment of conviction from any possible future attacks.\nSee Brief for Petitioners 18, 50.8\n——————\n  7 JUSTICE ALITO provides a detailed discussion of dangers such as\n\nlaboratory contamination and evidence tampering that may reduce the\nreliability not only of DNA evidence, but of any type of physical forensic\nevidence. Ante, at 3–10 (concurring opinion). While no form of testing\nis error proof in every case, the degree to which DNA evidence has\nbecome a foundational tool of law enforcement and prosecution is\nindicative of the general reliability and probative power of such testing.\nThe fact that errors may occur in the testing process is not a ground for\nrefusing such testing altogether—were it so, such evidence should be\nbanned at trial no less than in postconviction proceedings. More\nimportant still is the fact that the State now concedes there is no\nreason to doubt that if STR and mtDNA testing yielded exculpatory\nresults in this case, Osborne’s innocence would be established.\n  8 In his concurring opinion, JUSTICE ALITO suggests other reasons that\n\nmight motivate States to resist access to such evidence, including\nconcerns over DNA testing backlogs and manipulation by defendants.\nSee ante, at 8–10. Not only were these reasons not offered by the State\nof Alaska as grounds for its decision in this case, but they are not in\nthemselves compelling. While state resource constraints might justify\n12    DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                     DIST. v. OSBORNE\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   While we have long recognized that States have an\ninterest in securing the finality of their judgments, see,\ne.g., Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 179 (2001); Teague\nv. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 309 (1989) (plurality opinion);\nMcCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 491–492 (1991), finality\nis not a stand-alone value that trumps a State’s overriding\ninterest in ensuring that justice is done in its courts and\nsecured to its citizens. Indeed, when absolute proof of\ninnocence is readily at hand, a State should not shrink\nfrom the possibility that error may have occurred. Rather,\nour system of justice is strengthened by “recogniz[ing] the\nneed for, and imperative of, a safety valve in those rare\ninstances where objective proof that the convicted actually\ndid not commit the offense later becomes available\nthrough the progress of science.” Harvey, 285 F. 3d, at 306\n(Luttig, J.). DNA evidence has led to an extraordinary\nseries of exonerations, not only in cases where the trial\nevidence was weak, but also in cases where the convicted\n\n——————\ndelays in the testing of postconviction DNA evidence, they would not\njustify an outright ban on access to such evidence. And JUSTICE ALITO’s\nconcern that guilty defendants will “play games with the criminal\njustice system” with regard to the timing of their requests for DNA\nevidence is not only speculative, but gravely concerning. Ante, at 10. It\nbears remembering that criminal defendants are under no obligation to\nprove their innocence at trial; rather, the State bears the burden of\nproving their guilt. See Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U. S. 510 (1979);\nIn re Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970). Having no obligation to conduct\npretrial DNA testing, a defendant should not be bound by a decision to\nforgo such testing at trial, particularly when, as in this case, the choice\nwas made by counsel over the defendant’s strong objection. See Os\nborne I, 110 P. 3d, at 990-991. (JUSTICE ALITO suggests there is reason\nto doubt whether Osborne asked his counsel to perform DNA testing\nprior to trial, ante, at 12. That fact was not disputed in the state\ncourts, however. Although Osborne’s trial counsel averred that she “did\nnot have a present memory of Osborne’s desire to have [a more specific\ndiscriminatory] test of his DNA done,” she also averred that she was\n“willing to accept that he does\" and that she “would have disagreed\nwith him.” Id., at 990.)\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

When a person is convicted for a crime he\ndid not commit, the true culprit escapes punishment.\nDNA testing may lead to his identification. See Brief for\nCurrent and Former Prosecutors as Amici Curiae 16\n(noting that in more than one-third of all exonerations\nDNA testing identified the actual offender). Crime vic­\ntims, the law enforcement profession, and society at large\nshare a strong interest in identifying and apprehending\nthe actual perpetrators of vicious crimes, such as the rape\nand attempted murder that gave rise to this case.\n   The arbitrariness of the State’s conduct is highlighted\nby comparison to the private interests it denies. It seems\nto me obvious that if a wrongly convicted person were to\nproduce proof of his actual innocence, no state interest\nwould be sufficient to justify his continued punitive deten­\ntion. If such proof can be readily obtained without impos­\ning a significant burden on the State, a refusal to provide\naccess to such evidence is wholly unjustified.\n   In sum, an individual’s interest in his physical liberty is\none of constitutional significance.

In this case, the\nState has suggested no countervailing interest that justi­\nfies its refusal to allow Osborne to test the evidence in its\npossession and has not provided any other nonarbitrary\nexplanation for its conduct. Consequently, I am left to\nconclude that the State’s failure to provide Osborne access\nto the evidence constitutes arbitrary action that offends\nbasic principles of due process. On that basis, I would\naffirm the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.\n                               III\n   The majority denies that Osborne possesses a cognizable\nsubstantive due process right “under the circumstances of\nthis case,” and offers two meager reasons for its decision.\nFirst, citing a general reluctance to “ ‘expand the concept\nof substantive due process,’ ” ante, at 19 (quoting Collins,\n503 U. S., at 125), the Court observes that there is no long\nhistory of postconviction access to DNA evidence. “ ‘The\nmere novelty of such a claim,’ ” the Court asserts, “ ‘is\nreason enough to doubt that “substantive due process”\nsustains it,’ ” ante, at 19 (quoting Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S.\n292, 303 (1993)). The flaw is in the framing. Of course\ncourts have not historically granted convicted persons\naccess to physical evidence for STR and mtDNA testing.\nBut, as discussed above, courts have recognized a residual\nsubstantive interest in both physical liberty and in free­\ndom from arbitrary government action. It is Osborne’s\ninterest in those well-established liberties that justifies\nthe Court of Appeals’ decision to grant him access to the\nState’s evidence for purposes of previously unavailable\nDNA testing.\n   The majority also asserts that this Court’s recognition of\na limited federal right of access to DNA evidence would be\nill advised because it would “short circuit what looks to be\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

Such a decision, the majority warns,\nwould embroil the Court in myriad policy questions best\nleft to other branches of government. Ante, at 19–20. The\nmajority’s arguments in this respect bear close resem­\nblance to the manner in which the Court once approached\nthe now-venerable right to counsel for indigent defen­\ndants. Before our decision in Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S.\n45 (1932), state law alone governed the manner in which\ncounsel was appointed for indigent defendants. “Efforts to\nimpose a minimum federal standard for the right to coun­\nsel in state courts routinely met the same refrain: ‘in the\nface of these widely varying state procedures,’ this Court\nrefused to impose the dictates of ‘due process’ onto the\nstates and ‘hold invalid all procedure not reaching that\nstandard.” Brief for Current and Former Prosecutors as\nAmici Curiae 28, n. 8 (quoting Bute v. Illinois, 333 U. S.\n640, 668 (1948)). When at last this Court recognized the\nSixth Amendment right to counsel for all indigent criminal\ndefendants in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963),\nour decision did not impede the ability of States to tailor\ntheir appointment processes to local needs, nor did it\nunnecessarily interfere with their sovereignty. It did,\nhowever, ensure that criminal defendants were provided\nwith the counsel to which they were constitutionally enti­\ntled.10 In the same way, a decision to recognize a limited\n\n——————\n  10 The majority’s position also resembles that taken by Justice Harlan\n\nin his dissent in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 523 (1966), in\nwhich he faulted the Court for its “ironic untimeliness.” He noted that\nthe Court’s decision came at time when scholars, politicians, and law\nenforcement officials were beginning to engage in a “massive reexami­\nnation of criminal law enforcement procedures on a scale never before\nwitnessed,” and predicted that the practical effect of the Court’s deci­\nsion would be to “handicap seriously” those sound efforts. Id., at 523–\n524. Yet time has vindicated the decision in Miranda. The Court’s\n16    DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL\n                     DIST. v.

See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 17–26;\nBrief for State of California et al. as Amici Curiae 1–16. For example,\nfederal law and several state statutes impose the requirement that an\napplicant seeking postconviction DNA testing execute an affidavit\nattesting to his innocence before any request will be performed. See,\ne.g., 18 U. S. C. §3600(a)(1); Fla. Stat. §925.11(2)(a)(3) (2009 Supp.).\nAffirming the judgment of the Ninth Circuit would not cast doubt on\nthe constitutionality of such a requirement, however, since Osborne\nwas never asked to execute such an affidavit as a precondition to\nobtaining access to the State’s evidence. Similarly, affirmance would\nnot call into question the legitimacy of other reasonable conditions\nStates may place on access to DNA testing, such as Alaska’s require­\nment that test results be capable of yielding a clear answer with respect\nto guilt or innocence. “[D]ue process is flexible,” Morrissey v. Brewer,\n408 U. S. 471, 481 (1972), and the manner in which it is provided may\nreasonably vary from State to State and case to case.

I\nwould reserve judgment on the issue simply because there\nis no need to reach it; at a general level Alaska does not\ndeny a right to postconviction testing to prove innocence,\nand in any event, Osborne’s claim can be resolved by\nresort to the procedural due process requirement of an\neffective way to vindicate a liberty interest already recog­\nnized in state law, see Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U. S. 387, 393\n(1985). My choice to decide this case on that procedural\nground should not, therefore, be taken either as express­\ning skepticism that a new substantive right to test should\nbe cognizable in some circumstances, or as implying\nagreement with the Court that it would necessarily be\n2     DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL \n\n                     DIST. v.

Flo\nres, 507 U. S. 292, 318–319 (1993) (O’Connor, J., concur­\nring). Tradition is of course one serious consideration in\njudging whether a challenged rule or practice, or the\nfailure to provide a new one, should be seen as violating\nthe guarantee of substantive due process as being arbi­\ntrary, or as falling wholly outside the realm of reasonable\ngovernmental action. See Poe v. Ullman, 367 U. S. 497,\n542 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting). We recognize the\nvalue and lessons of continuity with the past, but as Jus­\ntice Harlan pointed out, society finds reasons to modify\nsome of its traditional practices, ibid., and the accumula­\ntion of new empirical knowledge can turn yesterday’s\nreasonable range of the government’s options into a due\nprocess anomaly over time.\n   As for determining the right moment for a court to\ndecide whether substantive due process requires recogni­\ntion of an individual right unsanctioned by tradition (or\nthe invalidation of traditional law), I certainly agree with\nthe Court that the beginning of wisdom is to go slow.\nSubstantive due process expresses the conception that the\nliberty it protects is a freedom from arbitrary government\naction, from restraints lacking any reasonable justification\nid., at 541,1 and a substantive due process claim requires\nattention to two closely related elements that call for great\ncare on the part of a court.

And it is just as essential to recog­\nnize how much time society needs in order to work\nthrough a given issue before it makes sense to ask\nwhether a law or practice on the subject is beyond the pale\nof reasonable choice, and subject to being struck down as\nviolating due process.\n  It goes without saying that the conception of the reason­\nable looks to the prevailing understanding of the broad\nsociety, not to individual notions that a judge may enter­\ntain for himself alone, id., at 542, 544, and in applying a\nnational constitution the society of reference is the nation.\nOn specific issues, widely shared understandings within\nthe national society can change as interests claimed under\nthe rubric of liberty evolve into recognition, see Griswold\nv. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965) (personal privacy);\nLawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558 (2003) (sexual intimacy),\nsee also Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.

We can change our own inherited views\njust so fast, and a person is not labeled a stick-in-the-mud\nfor refusing to endorse a new moral claim without having\nsome time to work through it intellectually and emotion­\nally. Just as attachment to the familiar and the limits of\nexperience affect the capacity of an individual to see the\npotential legitimacy of a moral position, the broader soci­\nety needs the chance to take part in the dialectic of public\nand political back and forth about a new liberty claim\n4    DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL \n\n                    DIST. v.

The time required is a matter for judgment de­\npending on the issue involved, but the need for some time\nto pass before a court entertains a substantive due process\nclaim on the subject is not merely the requirement of\njudicial restraint as a general approach, but a doctrinal\ndemand to be satisfied before an allegedly lagging legal\nregime can be held to lie beyond the discretion of reason­\nable political judgment.\n   Despite my agreement with the Court on this impor­\ntance of timing, though, I do not think that the doctrinal\nrequirement necessarily stands in the way of any substan­\ntive due process consideration of a postconviction right to\nDNA testing, even as a right that is freestanding. Given\nthe pace at which DNA testing has come to be recognized\nas potentially dispositive in many cases with biological\nevidence, there is no obvious argument that considering\nDNA testing at a general level would subject wholly in­\ntransigent legal systems to substantive due process review\nprematurely. But, as I said, there is no such issue before\nus, for Alaska does not flatly deny access to evidence for\nDNA testing in postconviction cases.\n   In another case, a judgment about appropriate timing\nmight also be necessary on issues of substantive due proc­\ness at the more specific level of the State’s conditions for\nexercising the right to test. Several such limitations are\npotentially implicated, including the need of a claimant to\nshow that the test results would be material as potentially\nshowing innocence, and the requirement that the testing\nsought be capable of producing new evidence not available\nat trial. But although I assume that avoiding prematurity\nis as much a doctrinal consideration in assessing the\nconditions affecting a substantive right as it is when the\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                   5\n\n                        SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nsubstantive right itself is the subject of a general claim,2\nthere is no need here to resolve any timing issue that\nmight be raised by challenges to these details.\n  Osborne’s objection here is not only to the content of the\nState’s terms and conditions, but also to the adequacy of\nAlaska’s official machinery in applying them, and there is\nno reason to defer consideration of this due process claim:\ngiven the conditions Alaska has placed on the right it\nrecognizes, the due process guarantee requires the State\nto provide an effective procedure for proving entitlement\nto relief under that scheme, Evitts, 469 U. S., at 393, and\nthe State has failed. On this issue, Osborne is entitled to\nrelief. Alaska has presented no good reasons even on its\nown terms for denying Osborne the access to the evidence\nhe seeks, and the inexplicable failure of the State to pro­\nvide an effective procedure is enough to show a need for a\n§1983 remedy, and relief in this case. JUSTICE STEVENS\ndeals with this failure in Part I of his dissent, which I join,\nand I emphasize only two points here.\n  In effect, Alaska argues against finding any right to\nrelief in a federal §1983 action because the procedure the\nState provides is reasonable and adequate to vindicate the\npost-trial liberty interest in testing evidence that the State\nhas chosen to recognize.3 When I first considered the\n——————\n  2 It makes sense to approach these questions as governed by the same\n\nrequirement to allow time for adequate societal and legislative consid­\neration that substantive liberty interests should receive at a general\nlevel. As Judge Luttig has pointed out, there is no hermetic line\nbetween the substantive and the procedural in due process analysis,\nHarvey v. Horan, 285 F. 3d 298, 318–319 (CA4 2002), and in this case\none could argue back and forth about the better characterization of\nvarious state conditions as being one or the other.\n  3 Alaska does not argue that the State’s process for vindicating the\n\nright to test, however inadequate, defines the limit of the right it\nrecognizes, with a consequence that, by definition, the liberty interest\nrecognized by the State calls for no process for its vindication beyond\nwhat the State provides.\n6    DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE FOR THIRD JUDICIAL \n\n                    DIST. v. OSBORNE \n\n                   SOUTER, J., dissenting \n\n\nState’s position I thought Alaska’s two strongest points\nwere these: (1) that in Osborne’s state litigation he failed\nto request access for the purpose of a variety of postconvic­\ntion testing that could not have been done at time of trial\n(and thus sought no new evidence by his state-court peti­\ntion); and (2) that he failed to aver actual innocence (and\nthus failed to place his oath behind the assertion that the\nevidence sought would be material to his postconviction\nclaim). Denying him any relief under these circumstances,\nthe argument ran, did not indicate any inadequacy in the\nstate procedure that would justify resort to §1983 for\nproviding due process.\n   Yet the record shows that Osborne has been denied\naccess to the evidence even though he satisfied each of\nthese conditions. As for the requirement to claim testing\nby a method not available at trial, Osborne’s state-court\nappellate brief specifically mentioned his intent to conduct\nshort tandem repeat (STR) analysis, App. at 171, 175, and\nthe State points to no pleading, brief, or evidence that\nOsborne ever changed this request.\n   The State’s reliance on Osborne’s alleged failure to claim\nfactual innocence is equally untenable. While there is no\nquestion that after conviction and imprisonment he admit­\nted guilt under oath as a condition for becoming eligible\nfor parole, the record before us makes it equally apparent\nthat he claims innocence on oath now. His affidavit filed\nin support of his request for evidence under §1983 con­\ntained the statement, “I have always maintained my\ninnocence,” id., at 226, ¶2, followed by an explanation that\nhis admission of guilt was a necessary gimmick to obtain\nparole, id., at 227, ¶7. Since the State persists in main­\ntaining that Osborne is not entitled to test its evidence, it\nis apparently mere makeweight for the State to claim that\nhe is not entitled to §1983 relief because he failed to claim\ninnocence seriously and unequivocally.\n   This is not the first time the State has produced reasons\n                    Cite as: 557 U.

Arguing before the Ninth Circuit, the State main­\ntained that the DNA evidence Osborne sought was not\nmaterial; that is, it argued that a test excluding Osborne\nas the source of semen in the blue condom, found near the\nbloody snow and spent shell casing in the secluded area\nwhere the victim was raped by one man, would not “estab­\nlish that he was factually innocent” or even “undermine\nconfidence . . . in the verdict.” Reply of Appellant, in No.\n06-35875 (CA9 2008), p. 18; see also 521 F. 3d 1118, 1136\n(CA9 2008). Such an argument is patently untenable, and\nthe State now concedes that a favorable test could “conclu­\nsively establish Osborne’s innocence.” Reply to Brief in\nOpposition 8.\n   Standing alone, the inadequacy of each of the State’s\nreasons for denying Osborne access to the DNA evidence\nhe seeks would not make out a due process violation.4 But\ntaken as a whole the record convinces me that, while\nAlaska has created an entitlement of access to DNA evi­\ndence under conditions that are facially reasonable, the\nState has demonstrated a combination of inattentiveness\nand intransigence in applying those conditions that add up\nto procedural unfairness that violates the Due Process\nClause.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  4 This Court is not in a position to correct individual errors of the\n\nAlaska Court of Appeals or Alaska officials, as §1983 does not serve as\na mechanism to review specific, unfavorable state-law determinations.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145860/", "sha1": "95801885ff37481f17301d430410fc31678419a9", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-071", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:08:37"}
