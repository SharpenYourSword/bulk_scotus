CITY OF VALDEZ, ALASKA\n\n         CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ALASKA\n\n       No. 08–310.      Argued April 1, 2009—Decided June 15, 2009\nA Valdez, Alaska, ordinance that imposes a personal property tax on\n  certain boats and vessels contains exceptions which, in effect, largely\n  limit its applicability to large oil tankers. Petitioner Polar Tankers,\n  Inc., whose vessels transport crude oil from the Port of Valdez to re\n  fineries in other States, challenged the ordinance in state court,\n  claiming (1) that the tax was unconstitutional under Art. I, §10, cl. 3,\n  which forbids a “State . . . without the Consent of Congress, [to] lay\n  any Duty of Tonnage,” and (2) that the tax’s value-allocation method\n  violated the Commerce and Due Process Clauses. The court rejected\n  the Tonnage Clause claim, but accepted the Commerce Clause and\n  Due Process Clause claim. On appeal, the State Supreme Court up\n  held the tax, finding that because it was a value-based property tax,\n  the tax was not a duty of tonnage. The State Supreme Court also\n  held the allocation method was fair and thus valid under the Com\n  merce and Due Process Clauses.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n182 P. 3d 614, reversed and remanded.\n    JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to\n  Parts I, II–A, and II–B–1, concluding that Valdez’s tax violates the\n  Tonnage Clause. Consequently, Polar Tankers’ alternative Com\n  merce Clause and Due Process Clause arguments need not be consid\n  ered. Pp. 3–8.\n    (a) This Court has consistently interpreted the language of the\n  Tonnage Clause in light of its purpose, which mirrors the intent of\n  other constitutional provisions that seek to restrain the States from\n  exercising the taxing power in a way that is injurious to the interests\n  of other States. The Clause seeks to prevent States from nullifying\n  Art. I, §10, cl. 2’s prohibition against import and export duties by tax\n  ing “the vessels transporting the merchandise.” Clyde Mallory Lines\n2              POLAR TANKERS, INC. v.

It also\n    reflects an effort to diminish a State’s ability to obtain tax advan\n    tages based on its favorable geographic position. Because the Clause\n    forbids a State to “do that indirectly which she is forbidden . . . to do\n    directly,” Passenger Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">283</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 458, the “prohibition against\n    tonnage duties has been deemed to embrace all taxes and duties re\n    gardless of their name or form, and even though not measured by the\n    tonnage of the vessel, which operate to impose a charge for the privi\n    lege of entering, trading in, or lying in a port,” Clyde Mallory Lines,\n    supra, at 265–266. Pp. 3–6.\n       (b) This case lies at the heart of what the Tonnage Clause forbids.\n    The ordinance seems designed to impose “a charge for the privilege of\n    entering, trading in, or lying in a port.” The tax applies almost ex\n    clusively to oil tankers, but to no other form of personal property. An\n    oil tanker can be subject to the tax based on a single entry into the\n    port. Moreover, the tax is closely correlated with cargo capacity.\n    Contrary to Valdez’s argument, the fact that the tax is designed to\n    raise revenue for general municipal services argues for, not against,\n    application of the Clause. Pp. 6–8.\n       JUSTICE BREYER, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE KENNEDY, and\n    JUSTICE GINSBURG, rejected, in Part II–B–2, Valdez’s claim that, under\n    State Tonnage Tax Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, its tax is “not within the pro\n    hibition of the Constitution,” because it is “levied . . . upon ships . . .\n    as property, based on a valuation of the same as property,” id., at 213\n    (emphasis deleted). This Court later made clear that the “prohibi\n    tion” against tonnage duties “comes into play” where vessels “are not\n    taxed in the same manner as the other property of the citizens,”\n    Transportation Co. v. Wheeling, 99 U. S. 273, 284. This qualification,\n    important in light of the Clause’s purpose, means that, in order to\n    fund services by taxing ships, a State must also impose similar taxes\n    upon other businesses. Valdez fails to satisfy this requirement. The\n    Court can find little, if any, other personal property that Valdez\n    taxes. Because its value-related property tax on mobile homes, trail\n    ers, and recreational vehicles applies only if they are “affixed” to a\n    particular site, it taxes those vehicles as a form of real, not personal,\n    property. Valdez also claims that its ship tax is simply another form\n    of a value-based tax on oil-related property provided by state law.\n    But Valdez’s tax, a purely a municipal tax, differs from the tax on\n    other oil-related property, which is primarily a state-level tax, in sev\n    eral ways. As a result of these differences, an ordinary oil-related\n    business finding the tax on its movable property too burdensome\n    must complain to the State, which is in charge of setting the manner\n    of assessment and valuation. At the same time, an oil tanker finding\n    its vessel tax too burdensome must complain to Valdez, for the State\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  has nothing to do with that tax’s rate, valuation, or assessment.\n  There is also no effective electorate-related check on Valdez’s vessel\n  taxing power comparable to the check available when a property tax\n  is more broadly imposed. Valdez’s property tax hits only ships; it is\n  not constrained by any need to treat ships and other business prop\n  erty alike. Thus, Valdez’s tax lacks the safeguards implied by this\n  Court’s statements that a property tax on ships escapes the Tonnage\n  Clause’s scope only when that tax is imposed upon ships “in the same\n  manner” as it is imposed on other forms of property. Pp. 8–13.\n     THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE THOMAS, agreed that Valdez’s\n  tax is unconstitutional, but concluded that the city’s argument that its\n  tax may be sustained as a property tax similar to ones the city imposes\n  on other property should be rejected because an unconstitutional tax on\n  maritime commerce does not become permissible when bundled with\n  taxes on other activities or property. Pp. 1–3.\n     JUSTICE ALITO agreed that Valdez’s tax is unconstitutional, but con\n  cluded that the tax is an unconstitutional duty of tonnage even if the\n  Tonnage Clause permits a true, evenhanded property tax to be ap\n  plied to vessels.

I,\n§10, cl. 3. The city of Valdez, Alaska, has enacted an\nordinance that imposes a personal property tax upon the\nvalue of large ships that travel to and from that city. We\nhold that the ordinance violates the Clause.\n                             I\n   In 1999, the city of Valdez, Alaska (City), adopted an\nordinance imposing a personal property tax upon “[b]oats\nand vessels of at least 95 feet in length” that regularly\ntravel to the City, are kept or used within the City, or\nwhich annually take on at least $1 million worth of cargo\nor engage in other business transactions of comparable\nvalue in the City. Valdez Ordinance No. 99–17 (1999)\n(codified as Valdez Municipal Code §3.12.020 (2008)). The\nordinance contains exceptions that, in effect, limit the\ntax’s applicability primarily to large oil tankers. Ibid.\n2         POLAR TANKERS, INC. v. CITY OF VALDEZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAnd the City applies the tax in accordance with a value­\nallocation system that adjusts the amount owed down­\nwards insofar as the tankers spend time in other ports.\nValdez, Alaska Resolution No. 00–15, App. to Pet. for Cert.\n53a–56a.\n    Polar Tankers, Inc., a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips,\nowns vessels that transport crude oil from a terminal in\nthe Port of Valdez (located at the southern end of the\nTrans Alaska Pipeline System) to refineries in California,\nHawaii, and Washington. In August 2000, Polar Tankers\nfiled a lawsuit in Alaska Superior Court challenging the\ntax as unconstitutional. Polar Tankers argued that the\ntax effectively imposed a fee on certain vessels for the\nprivilege of entering the port; hence it amounted to a\nconstitutionally forbidden “Duty of Tonnage.” It also\nargued that the tax calculation method (as applied to\nvessels with a tax situs elsewhere) violated the Commerce\nand Due Process Clauses by failing to take account of the\ntime a ship spent at sea or being serviced or repaired.\nPolar Tankers said that the method thereby overstated\nthe percentage of the ship’s total earning capacity rea­\nsonably allocated to time spent in the Port of Valdez.\n    The Alaska Superior Court rejected the Tonnage\nClause claim, but it accepted the Commerce Clause and\nDue Process Clause claim. And, for that reason, it held\nthe tax unconstitutional. On appeal, the Alaska Supreme\nCourt, rejecting both claims, upheld the tax. In respect to\nthe Tonnage Clause claim, the Supreme Court noted that\nValdez’s tax was a value-based property tax designed to\npay for “services available to all taxpayers in the city,”\nincluding Polar Tankers; and it concluded that “a charge\nbased on the value of property is not a duty of tonnage.”\n182 P. 3d 614, 623 (2008) (citing Transportation Co. v.\nWheeling, 99 U. S. 273 (1879)). In respect to the Com­\nmerce Clause and Due Process Clause claim, the Supreme\nCourt held that Valdez’s allocation method was fair, hence\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

We hold that Valdez’s tax is unconstitu­\ntional because it violates that Clause. And we conse­\nquently need not consider Polar Tankers’ alternative\nCommerce Clause and Due Process Clause argument.\n    When the Framers originally wrote the Tonnage\nClause, the words it uses, “Duty of Tonnage,” referred in\ncommercial parlance to “a duty” imposed upon a ship,\nwhich duty varies according to “the internal cubic capacity\nof a vessel,” i.e., its tons of carrying capacity. Clyde Mal\nlory Lines v. Alabama ex rel. State Docks Comm’n, 296\nU. S. 261, 265 (1935) (citing Inman S. S. Co. v. Tinker, 94\nU. S. 238, 243 (1877)); see also T. Cooley, Constitutional\nLimitations 596 (6th ed. 1890). Over a century ago, how­\never, this Court found that the Framers intended those\nwords to refer to more than “a duty” that sets a “certain\nrate on each ton” of capacity. Steamship Co. v. Portwar\ndens, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87884\"><a href=\"/opinion/87884/steamship-co-v-portwardens/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 34 (1867).\n   The Court over the course of many years has consis­\ntently interpreted the language of the Clause in light of its\npurpose, a purpose that mirrors the intent of other consti­\ntutional provisions which, like the Tonnage Clause itself,\nseek to “restrai[n] the states themselves from the exercise”\nof the taxing power “injuriously to the interests of each\nother.” J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the\nUnited States §497, p. 354 (1833) (abridged version).\nArticle I, §10, cl. 2, for example, forbids States to “lay any\nImposts or Duties on Imports or Exports.” It thereby\nseeks to prevent states with “convenient ports” from plac­\n4         POLAR TANKERS, INC. v.

Farrand rev. 1966) (reprinting James\nMadison, Preface to Debates in the Convention of 1787\nand letter from James Madison to Professor Davis, 1832).\nThe coastal States were not to “take advantage of their\nfavorable geographical position in order to exact a price for\nthe use of their ports from the consumers dwelling in less\nadvantageously situated parts of the country.” Youngs\ntown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers, 358 U. S. 534, 556–557\n(1959) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).\n   In writing the Tonnage Clause, the Framers recognized\nthat, if “the states had been left free to tax the privilege of\naccess by vessels to their harbors the prohibition against\nduties on imports and exports could have been nullified by\ntaxing the vessels transporting the merchandise.” Clyde\nMallory Lines, supra, at 265. And the Court has under­\nstood the Tonnage Clause as seeking to prevent that\nnullification. See Steamship Co., supra, at 34–35; see also\nPacket Co. v. Keokuk, 95 U. S. 80, 87 (1877); Gibbons v.\nOgden, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85412\"><a href=\"/opinion/85412/gibbons-appellant-v-ogden-respondent/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 202 (1824). It has also understood the\nClause as reflecting an effort to diminish a State’s ability\nto obtain certain geographical vessel-related tax advan­\ntages whether the vessel in question transports goods\nbetween States and foreign nations or, as here, only be­\ntween the States. Compare Inman, supra (invalidating a\nfee applied to ships engaged in foreign commerce), with\nSteamship Co., supra (invalidating a tax applied to ships\nengaged in interstate commerce).\n   Interpreting the Clause in light of its “intent,” id., at\n34, the Court has read its language as forbidding a State\nto “do that indirectly which she is forbidden . . . to do\ndirectly.” Passenger Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">283</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 458 (1849). Thus,\nthe Court has said that the Clause, which literally forbids\na State to “levy a duty or tax . . . graduated on the ton­\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnage,” must also forbid a State to “effect the same purpose\nby merely changing the ratio, and graduating it on the\nnumber of masts, or of mariners, the size and power of the\nsteam-engine, or the number of passengers which she\ncarries.” Id., at 458–459. A State cannot take what would\notherwise amount to a tax on the ship’s capacity and evade\nthe Clause by calling that tax “a charge on the owner or\nsupercargo,” thereby “justify[ing] this evasion of a great\nprinciple by producing a dictionary or a dictum to prove\nthat a ship-captain is not a vessel, nor a supercargo an\nimport.” Id., at 459.\n   The Court has consequently stated that the Tonnage\nClause prohibits, “not only a pro rata tax . . ., but any duty\non the ship, whether a fixed sum upon its whole tonnage,\nor a sum to be ascertained by comparing the amount of\ntonnage with the rate of duty.” Steamship Co., supra, at\n35. And, summarizing earlier cases while speaking for a\nunanimous Court, Justice Stone concluded that the “pro­\nhibition against tonnage duties has been deemed to em­\nbrace all taxes and duties regardless of their name or\nform, and even though not measured by the tonnage of the\nvessel, which operate to impose a charge for the privilege\nof entering, trading in, or lying in a port.” Clyde Mallory\nLines, supra, at 265–266.

See\npost, at 1–2 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in part and con­\ncurring in judgment). Such a radical proposition would\ntransform the Tonnage Clause from one that protects\nvessels, and their owners, from discrimination by seaboard\nStates, to one that gives vessels preferential treatment\nvis-à-vis all other property, and its owners, in a seaboard\nState. The Tonnage Clause cannot be read to give vessels\nsuch “preferential treatment.” Cf. Michelin Tire Corp. v.\nWages, 423 U. S. 276, 287 (1976) (noting, in a related\ncontext, that the Import-Export Clause “cannot be read to\naccord imported goods preferential treatment that permits\nescape from uniform taxes imposed without regard to\nforeign origin for services which the State supplies”). See\nalso infra this page and 7–11.\n                               B\n                               1\n   Does the tax before us impose “a charge for the privilege\nof entering, trading in, or lying in a port”? Certainly, the\nordinance that imposes the tax would seem designed to do\nso. It says that the tax applies to ships that travel to (and\nleave) the City’s port regularly for business purposes, that\nare kept in the City’s port, that take on more than $1\nmillion in cargo in that port, or that are involved in busi­\nness transactions in that amount there. In practice, the\ntax applied in its first year to 28 vessels, of which 24 were\noil tankers, 3 were tugboats, and 1 was a passenger cruise\nship. App. 53. The ordinance applies the tax to no other\nform of personal property. See Valdez Municipal Code\n§3.12.030(A)(2) (2008).\n    Moreover, the tax’s application and its amount depend\nupon the ship’s capacity. That is to say, the tax applies\nonly to large ships (those at least 95 feet in length), while\nexempting small ones. See §3.12.020(A)(1).\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    Nor can Valdez escape application of the Clause by\nclaiming that the ordinance imposes, not a duty or a tax,\nbut a fee or a charge for “services rendered” to a “vessel,”\nsuch as “pilotage,” “wharfage,” “medical inspection,” the\n“use of locks,” or the like. Clyde Mallory Lines, 296 U. S.,\nat 266; see also Inman, 94 U. S., at 243. To the contrary,\nthe ordinance creates a tax designed to raise revenue used\nfor general municipal services. See 182 P. 3d, at 623;\nValdez, Alaska Resolution No. 00–15, App. to Pet. for Cert.\n53a–56a. Tonnage Clause precedent makes clear that,\nwhere a tax otherwise qualifies as a duty of tonnage, a\ngeneral, revenue-raising purpose argues in favor of, not\nagainst, application of the Clause. See Steamship Co., 6\nWall., at 34.\n   This case lies at the heart of what the Tonnage Clause\nforbids. The ordinance applies almost exclusively to oil\ntankers. And a tax on the value of such vessels is closely\ncorrelated with cargo capacity. Because the imposition of\nthe tax depends on a factor related to tonnage and that\ntonnage-based tax is not for services provided to the ves­\nsel, it is unconstitutional.\n   The dissent contends that the tax does not operate as “a\ncharge for the privilege of entering, trading in, or lying in\na port,” Clyde Mallory Lines, supra, at 265–266—that is,\nas an impermissible tonnage duty—because Valdez levies\nits tax only upon vessels that meet a “tax situs” require­\nment. See post, at 6–7 (opinion of STEVENS, J.). But in\nthis case, the distinction the dissent draws between ton­\nnage duties and property taxes is a distinction without a\ndifference. That is because to establish a tax situs under\nthe tax challenged here, an oil tanker needs only to enter\nthe port and load oil worth more than $1 million. And, as\nPolar Tankers notes, oil tankers routinely carry millions of\nbarrels of oil at a time worth well in excess of $1 million.\nReply Brief for Petitioner 6.

No one claims that this basis for estab­\nlishing a tax situs is insufficient under the Constitution.\nAfter all, a nondomiciliary jurisdiction may constitution­\nally tax property when that property has a “substantial\nnexus” with that jurisdiction, and such a nexus is estab­\nlished when the taxpayer “avails itself of the substantial\nprivilege of carrying on business” in that jurisdiction. See\nJapan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434,\n441–445 (1979) (internal quotation marks omitted); Mobil\nOil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes of Vt., 445 U. S. 425,\n437 (1980) (same); Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U. S.\n298, 312 (1992). Here, the City identified the 28 vessels\nthat were subject to the tax in the year 2000. But the City\nfails to point to a single oil tanker, or any vessel greater\nthan 95 feet in length, that both entered the port and\nfailed to establish a tax situs. See App. 53. What else is\nneeded to show that a tax characterized as one on property\nmay nevertheless function as a “charge for the privilege of\nentering . . . a port”?\n\n                               2\n   Valdez does not deny that its tax operates much like a\nduty applied exclusively to ships. But, like the Alaska\nSupreme Court, it points to language in an earlier Court\nopinion explicitly stating that “[t]axes levied . . . upon\nships . . . as property, based on a valuation of the same as\nproperty, are not within the prohibition of the Constitu­\ntion.” State Tonnage Tax Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 213 (1871)\n(emphasis deleted); cf. 182 P. 3d, at 622, and n. 43. Valdez\nsays that its tax is just such a value-related tax on per­\nsonal property and consequently falls outside the scope of\nthe Clause. Brief for Respondent 16–23.\n   Our problem with this argument, however, is that the\nCourt later made clear that the Clause does not apply to\n“taxation” of vessels “as property in the same manner as\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

S., at 284 (em­\nphasis added).\n    Viewed in terms of the purpose of the Clause, this\nqualification is important. It means that, in order to fund\nservices by taxing ships, a State must also impose similar\ntaxes upon other businesses. And that fact may well\noperate as a check upon a State’s ability to impose a tax on\nships at rates that reflect an effort to take economic ad­\nvantage of the port’s geographically based position. After\nall, the presence of other businesses subject to the tax,\nparticularly businesses owned and operated by state\nresidents, threatens political concern and a potential\nballot-box issue, were rates, say, to get out of hand.

South Carolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell\nBrothers, Inc., 303 U. S. 177, 185, n. 2 (1938) (when state\naction affecting interstate commerce “is of such a charac­\nter that its burden falls principally upon those without the\nstate, legislative action is not likely to be subjected to\nthose political restraints which are normally exerted on\nlegislation where it affects adversely some interests within\nthe state”).\n    Moreover, and at the very least, a “same manner”\nrequirement helps to assure that a value-related property\ntax differs significantly from a graduated tax on a ship’s\ncapacity and that the former is not simply a redesignation\nof the latter. See Packet Co., 95 U. S., at 88 (“ ‘It is the\nthing and not the name that is to be considered’ ” (quoting\nCooley, supra, at 314)).\n    In our view, Valdez fails to satisfy this requirement. It\ndoes not tax vessels “in the same manner as other per­\nsonal property” of those who do business in Valdez.\n10        POLAR TANKERS, INC. v. CITY OF VALDEZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nWheeling, supra, at 284. We can find little, if any, other\npersonal property that it taxes. According to the State of\nAlaska, Valdez specifically exempts from property taxa­\ntion motor vehicles, aircraft, and other vehicles, as well as\nbusiness machinery. See Dept. of Community and Eco­\nnomic Development, Division of Community and Business\nDevelopment, Office of the State Assessor, Alaska Taxable\n2001, p. 20 (Jan. 2002), (Table 4), online at\nhttp://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/Taxable/AKTaxable2\n001.pdf (as visited June 10, 2009, and available in Clerk of\nCourt’s case file).\n    We concede, as Valdez points out, that a different\nValdez ordinance imposes what it characterizes as a\nvalue-based property tax on mobile homes, trailers, and\nrecreational vehicles. Valdez Municipal Code §3.12.022\n(2008); Brief for Respondent 24–25. But that same ordi­\nnance exempts those vehicles from its property tax unless\nthey are “affixed” to a particular site. Hence, whatever\nwords the City uses to describe the tax imposed on mobile\nhomes, trailers, and recreational vehicles, Valdez in fact\ntaxes those vehicles only when they constitute a form, not\nof personal property, but of real property (like a home).\nSee §3.12.022 (providing that “trailers and mobile homes”\nare “subject to taxation” when they are classified as “real\nproperty”).\n    Valdez also points to a separate City ordinance that\nimposes a tax “on all taxable property taxable under\nAlaska Statutes Chapter 43.56.” §3.28.010 (2008). The\nAlaska Statutes Chapter identifies as taxable “aircraft\nand motor vehicles” the operation of which “relates to” the\n“exploration for, production of, or pipeline transportation\nof gas or unrefined oil.” Alaska Stat. §43.56.210 (2008).\nValdez claims that its tax on ships is simply another form\nof this value-related tax on oil-related property.\n    Valdez did not make this claim in the lower courts,\nhowever. Nor does the State of Alaska (which has filed a\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

And, lacking precise infor­\nmation, we might ordinarily decline to consider this claim.\nSee, e.g., Clingman v. Beaver, 544 U. S. 581, 597–598\n(2005).\n    Nonetheless, the parties have argued the matter in\ntheir briefs here; and our deciding the matter now will\nreduce the likelihood of further litigation. We may make\nexceptions to our general approach to claims not raised\nbelow; and for these reasons we shall do so. See Granfi\nnanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, 39 (1989).\n    Addressing the claim on the basis of the briefs and\nwhat we have gleaned from publicly available sources, we\nnote that Valdez’s ship tax differs from the tax on other\noil-related property in several ways. The former is a\npurely municipal tax. The City imposes it; the City alone\ndetermines what property is subject to the tax; the City\nestablishes the rate of taxation; the City values the prop­\nerty; the City resolves evaluation disputes; the City issues\nassessment notices; the City collects the tax; and the City\n(as far as we can tell) keeps the revenue without any\nrestrictions. See Valdez Municipal Code §3.12.020(A)(1)\n(2008); §3.12.060; §3.12.020(B); §§3.12.090–3.12.100;\n§3.12.210(A) (2001); Valdez, Alaska Resolution No. 00–15,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 53a–56a.\n    The latter is primarily a state-level tax. The State\nimposes it. In fact, Valdez’s city manager characterized\nthe oil-property tax as involving “property taxed by the\nState . . . and [raising revenue] subsequently shared with\nthe City.” App. 46 (affidavit of Dave Dengel). In addition,\nthe State determines the type of property subject to the\ntax; the State forbids the municipality to exempt any\nproperty it designates as taxable; the State regulates the\nrate of taxation that may be applied to property it desig­\n12        POLAR TANKERS, INC. v.

See Alaska Stat. §43.56.010(b) (2008);\n§43.56.210(5)(A); 15 Alaska Admin. Code §56.010 (2009);\n§§56.015–56.040; Alaska Stat. §§29.45.080(b), (c) (2008);\n§43.56.010(c).\n   These differences matter. For one thing, they mean that\nany ordinary oil-related business, other than ships, that\nfinds the tax imposed upon its movable property too bur­\ndensome must complain to the State, not to the City, for it\nis the State that is in charge of setting the manner of\nassessment and valuation. At the same time, an oil\ntanker that finds the vessel tax too burdensome must\ncomplain to the City, not to the State, for the State has\nnothing to do with the rate, valuation, or assessment of\nthat particular tax.\n   For another thing, they mean that there is no effective\nelectorate-related check (comparable to the check avail­\nable where a property tax is more broadly imposed) upon\nthe City’s vessel-taxing power. The City’s property tax\nhits ships and only ships; it is not constrained by any need\nto treat ships and other business property alike. Taken\ntogether, these two considerations mean that Valdez’s\nproperty tax lacks the safeguards implied by this Court’s\nstatements that a property tax on ships escapes the scope\nof the Tonnage Clause only when that tax is imposed upon\nships “in the same manner” as it is imposed on other forms\nof property.\n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE contends that a State may never\nimpose a property tax on a vessel belonging to a citizen of\nanother State, even if that vessel is taxed in the “same\nmanner” as other personal property in the taxing state.\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nSee post, at 1–2 (opinion concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment). But, as THE CHIEF JUSTICE concedes, this\nCourt held in the State Tonnage Tax Cases and Wheeling\nthat vessels belonging to a State’s own citizens may be\nsubject to a property tax when the vessels are taxed in the\nsame manner as other personal property owned by citizens\nof that State. At the time those cases were decided, the\nhome port doctrine was still in effect, which meant that\nvessels were taxable solely by the owner’s domicile State.\nSince the State Tonnage Tax Cases and Wheeling, the\nhome port doctrine has been abandoned and States are\nnow permitted to tax vessels belonging to citizens of other\nStates that develop a tax situs in the nondomiciliary\nState, provided the tax is fairly apportioned. See, e.g., Ott\nv. Mississippi Valley Barge Line Co., 336 U. S. 169, 172–\n174 (1949); Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441\nU. S. 434, 442–443 (1979). Given this evolution in the law\ngoverning interstate taxation since our decisions in the\nState Tonnage Tax Cases and Wheeling, there is little\nreason to think that the ability of a State to tax vessels in\nthe “same manner” as other personal property applies only\nto vessels owned by citizens of the taxing State. In any\nevent, we need not decide this issue because it is clear that\nthe vessels subject to the City’s ordinance are not taxed in\nthe same manner as other personal property.\n\n\n   As far as we can tell, then, Valdez applies a value­\nbased personal property tax to ships and to no other prop­\nerty at all. It does so in order to obtain revenue for gen­\neral city purposes. The tax, no less than a similar duty,\nmay (depending upon rates) “ta[x] the consumption” of\nthose in other states. See 3 Records of the Federal Con­\nvention of 1787, at 519 (reprinting letter from James\nMadison to Professor Davis, 1832). It is consequently the\nkind of tax that the Tonnage Clause forbids Valdez to\n14       POLAR TANKERS, INC. v.

The plurality goes on, however, to reject the city’s\nargument that the tax may be sustained as a property tax\nsimilar to ones the city imposes on other property. The\nplurality rejects that argument on the ground that the city\nin fact does not impose similar taxes on other property.\nAnte, at 8–13. I would instead reject the argument on the\nground that it does not matter.\n   The Tonnage Clause applies to “any Duty of Tonnage,”\nregardless of how that duty compares to other commercial\ntaxes. U. S. Const., Art. I, §10, cl. 3. The free flow of\nmaritime commerce was so important to the Framers that\nthey grouped the prohibition on tonnage duties with bans\non keeping troops or ships of war, entering into compacts\nwith other States or foreign powers, and engaging in war.\nIbid. In light of the Framers’ goal to promote trade, and\nthe language of the Clause, I do not see how an unconsti\ntutional tax on maritime commerce becomes permissible\nwhen bundled with taxes on other activities or property.\nIf States wish to use their geographical position to tax\nnational maritime commerce, they must get Congress’s\n2         POLAR TANKERS, INC. v.

J.\n\nconsent—just as they must to engage in the other activi\nties prohibited by Clause 3.\n   The majority responds that nothing in the history of the\nClause, its purpose, or this Court’s interpretation of it\nsuggests that it bans all taxes on vessels using a port.\nAnte, at 5. The majority’s list of interpretive tools tellingly\nleaves out one—the words the Framers used. The Clause\nby its terms provides that “No State shall, without the\nConsent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage.” U. S.\nConst., Art. I., §10, cl. 3 (emphasis added). The majority\ncorrectly concludes that the Valdez tax is a tonnage duty,\nante, at 7, and that should be the end of the matter.\n   The majority also objects that this approach would give\nvessels “preferential treatment,” when the Clause only\nprotects vessels from discrimination. Ante, at 6. But the\nClause says nothing about discrimination, and it should\nhardly come as a surprise that a constitutional ban on\ntonnage duties would give preferential treatment to ves\nsels. Such protection reflects the high value the Framers\nplaced on the free flow of maritime commerce.

See ante, at 12–13; post,\nat 3, n. 1 (dissenting opinion). I disagree.

In contrast, the Tonnage Clause forbids only\ntonnage duties, and would permit Valdez to impose other\ntaxes on visiting ships—for example, “a reasonable charge\nfor” the service of “policing of a harbor.” Clyde Mallory\nLines v. Alabama ex rel. State Docks Comm’n, 296 U. S.\n261, 267, 266 (1935). The demise of the home port doc\ntrine is in no way inconsistent with reading the Tonnage\nClause, as written, to ban all tonnage duties. See Japan\nLine, supra, at 439, n. 3 (rejecting home port doctrine\nwhile expressly not reaching Tonnage Clause argument).\n   In any case, because the Court has determined that\nValdez’s tax is unlike other municipal taxes, it does not\ndecide whether a tonnage duty would be unconstitutional\nwhen other similar property is taxed. See ante, at 13;\npost, at 1 (ALITO, J., concurring in part and concurring in\nthe judgment). Whatever other taxes the city might im\npose, this tax “operate[s] to impose a charge for the privi\nlege of entering . . . or lying in” the port of Valdez, and is a\nduty of tonnage for that reason.

See Pullman’s Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania,\n141 U. S. 18, 23–24 (1891). That doctrine has since “yielded to a rule of\nfair apportionment among the States,” permitting any jurisdiction with\nwhich a ship has had sufficient contacts to establish a tax situs to levy\na property tax on the ship in proportion to the ship’s contacts with the\njurisdiction. See Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S.\n434, 442–443 (1979); see also Standard Oil Co. v. Peck, 342 U. S. 382,\n383 (1952). We have roundly rejected the doctrine in cases involving\nships moving in interstate operations along the inland waters. See\nibid. And in the context of ocean-going ships, we have referred to the\ndoctrine as “ ‘anachronistic’ ” and all but “ ‘abandoned,’ ” noting that “to\nrehabilitate the ‘home port doctrine’ as a tool of Commerce Clause\nanalysis would be somewhat odd.” Japan Line, 441 U. S., at 443. In\nlight of these developments, it is odd indeed that THE CHIEF JUSTICE\nendeavors to distinguish Transportation Co. v. Wheeling, 99 U. S. 273\n(1879), and the State Tonnage Tax Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1871), as\n“apply[ing] only to taxation of property owned by citizens of the State.”\nSee ante, at 2 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\n4           POLAR TANKERS, INC. v. CITY OF VALDEZ\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nvalue. When a State levies a property tax on ships, the\nprohibition of the Tonnage Clause comes into play only if\nthe ships are “not taxed in the same manner as the other\nproperty of the citizens, or where the tax is imposed upon\nthe vessel as an instrument of commerce, without refer\nence to the value as property.” Wheeling, 99 U. S., at 284.\nAlthough the meaning of Wheeling’s “same manner” lan\nguage is not immediately apparent, the remainder of the\nopinion emphasizes the importance of the method by\nwhich the tax on the petitioner’s ships was calculated—\ni.e., “based on a valuation of the same as property”—\nrather than the city’s taxation of other property in the\njurisdiction. Id., at 279; see id., at 284.\n   Our decision in the State Tonnage Tax Cases is to the\nsame effect, as we held that taxes levied on ships “as\nproperty, based on a valuation of the same as property, are\nnot within the prohibition of the Constitution,” but if\nStates tax ships “by a tonnage duty, or indirectly by im\nposing the tax upon the master or crew, they assume a\njurisdiction which they do not possess.” 12 Wall., at 213,\n214 (emphasis in original). Indeed, each of the taxes\nchallenged in that case was invalidated because it was\n“levied on the steamboats wholly irrespective of the value\nof the vessels as property, and solely and exclusively on\nthe basis of their cubical contents.” Id., at 217; see id., at\n224 (holding the tax unconstitutional because “the amount\nof the tax depends upon the carrying capacity of the\nsteamboat and not upon her value as property”).2 Thus, in\n——————\n    2 The\n        Court seems to conflate these methods of calculating taxes on\nships, as it asserts that “a tax on the value of such vessels is closely\ncorrelated with cargo capacity” and concludes that the tax in this case\n“depends on a factor related to tonnage.” Ante, at 7; see also ante, at 1\n(opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). This is contrary to our longstanding recog\nnition that a ship’s capacity is not a proxy for its value: “[T]he experi\nence of every one shows that a small steamer, new and well built, may\nbe of much greater value than a large one, badly built or in need of\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

It is undisputed that\npetitioner’s ships “are taxed based on their value, and only\nthose [ships] that have acquired a taxable situs in Valdez\nare taxed.” 182 P. 3d 614, 622 (Alaska 2008). Accord\ningly, I would uphold the Alaska Supreme Court’s decision\nsustaining the tax against petitioner’s Tonnage Clause\nchallenge.\n   The plurality reaches the opposite conclusion because it\nreads Wheeling’s “same manner” language to impose a\ndifferent limitation on the States’ power to tax ships.\nAccording to the plurality, “in order to fund services by\ntaxing ships, a State must also impose similar taxes upon\nother businesses.” Ante, at 9. As discussed above, Wheel\ning and the State Tonnage Cases are better read to require\nthat property taxes on ships be assessed based on the\nvalue of the ship rather than its tonnage. But even if the\n“same manner” requirement did not clearly refer to the\nmethod of calculating the tax, the phrase could not bear\nthe weight the plurality places on it. And there is no other\nsupport in our cases or in the text of the Tonnage Clause\nfor a rule that conditions a State’s exercise of its admitted\nauthority to levy property taxes on ships upon its decision\nalso to tax other property within its jurisdiction.\n   Under the plurality’s reading, the same tax could be a\n“Duty of Tonnage” in one instance and not in another\ndepending on taxing decisions wholly outside the Clause’s\nreach. Far from being compelled by our earlier cases, this\nrule is in tension with our decisions noting the substantial\nflexibility States must be afforded in making taxing deci\nsions and cautioning courts not to “subject the essential\n—————— \n\nextensive repairs.” State Tonnage Tax Cases, 12 Wall., at 224. \n\n6         POLAR TANKERS, INC. v. CITY OF VALDEZ\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ntaxing power of the State to an intolerable supervision.”\nOhio Oil Co. v. Conway, 281 U. S. 146, 159 (1930). That\ntension is compounded by the inevitable difficulty States\nwill have in navigating the new rule, as the plurality does\nnot suggest at what point a State can be satisfied that it\nhas taxed enough other property that it may also tax ships\nwithout violating the Clause’s prohibitions.\n   In support of its understanding of the “same manner”\nrequirement, the plurality asserts that the rule “helps to\nassure that a value-related property tax differs signifi\ncantly from a graduated tax on a ship’s capacity and that\nthe former is not simply a redesignation of the latter.”\nAnte, at 9. But our cases provide such assurance without\nresort to the plurality’s strained reading. Because States\nand their political subdivisions only have authority to tax\nproperty that has established a tax situs in the jurisdic\ntion, they cannot levy such taxes on ships merely for the\nprivilege of entering or leaving the port; much more sub\nstantial contact with the jurisdiction is required. See\nValdez Municipal Code §3.12.020(C) (2008); Central R. Co.\nof Pa. v. Pennsylvania, 370 U. S. 607, 614–615 (1962).\nAnd it is that contact, rather than entry into the port, that\nprovides the basis for taxing the ships. The tax situs\nrequirement thus ensures that a State cannot avoid the\nproscriptions of the Tonnage Clause by redesignating a\nduty charged for the privilege of entering the port as an\nad valorem tax.\n   The facts of this case illustrate the point. Most of peti\ntioner’s ships spend 40-to-50 days per year in the Port of\nValdez. See App. 32–45. “[A]s a group the tankers form a\ncontinuous presence in the city.” 182 P. 3d, at 623. The\nships’ prolonged physical presence and extensive commer\ncial activities in the city have a substantial impact on the\ncity’s resources. On average, the ships’ presence adds 550\npeople to the population of Valdez, increasing the city’s\ntotal population by 10%. Those people, as well as the\n                      Cite as: 557 U.

Ibid. As the Alaska Supreme\nCourt concluded, the challenged tax is therefore a legiti\nmate property tax levied to support the ships’ use of the\ncity’s services. See ibid.\n                                II\n    Even if the Tonnage Clause were properly understood to\npermit a jurisdiction to levy a tax on ships only when\nother property in the jurisdiction is also taxed, I would\nuphold the challenged tax. Although the tax applies only\nto ships, see Valdez Municipal Code §3.12.020, other\nproperty in the city is also subject to taxation.\n    First, §3.12.022 imposes a value-based property tax on\ntrailers, mobile homes, and recreational vehicles that are\naffixed to a site and connected to utilities. The plurality\nmakes much of the requirement that the property be\n“ ‘affixed’ ” to a particular site, concluding that “Valdez in\nfact taxes those vehicles only when they constitute a form,\nnot of personal property, but of real property.” Ante, at 10.\nBut the taxability of property pursuant to §3.12.022 is\ndetermined in much the same way as the taxability of\nships. “A trailer or mobile home is conclusively presumed\nto be affixed to the land” and may therefore be taxed if “it\nhas remained at a fixed site for more than ninety days.”\n§3.12.022(C). Similarly, a ship owner can establish a tax\nsitus in Valdez and thus be subject to taxation if it is “kept\nor used within the city for any ninety days or more.”\n§3.12.020(C)(2)(c).3 In both cases, the provision serves to\nimpose a tax on property that has developed substantial\ncontacts with the city. The plurality is thus wrong to\n——————\n  3A ship can also establish a tax situs in Valdez if it is usually kept or\nused within the city, travels to or within the city along regular routes,\nor is necessary to the conduct of substantial business in the city.\n§3.12.020(C)(2).\n8            POLAR TANKERS, INC. v. CITY OF VALDEZ\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nconclude that ships have been singled out for taxation.\n   Valdez also “levie[s] a tax” on all property taxable under\nAlaska Statutes Chapter 43.56 at the same rate that\napplies to other property taxed by the city. Valdez Mu\nnicipal Code §3.28.010.4 The tax is imposed on property\nused “primarily in the exploration for, production of, or\npipeline transportation of gas or unrefined oil,” including\nmachinery, equipment, pumping stations, powerplants,\naircraft and motor vehicles, and docks and other port\nfacilities. See Alaska Stat. §§43.56.010, 43.56.210(5)(A)\n(2008). For several reasons, this tax is more significant\nthan the plurality acknowledges. First, contrary to the\nplurality’s view, the tax appears to be a municipal tax.\nValdez Municipal Code §3.28.010 states that the tax “is\nhereby levied” on “property taxable under Alaska Statutes\nChapter 43.56,” which in turn states that “[a] municipality\nmay levy” such taxes, §43.56.010(b). The terms of these\nprovisions indicate that the city has exercised its express\nauthority to levy such taxes. Given the myriad types of\nproperty taxable under those provisions and the require\nment of Valdez Municipal Code §3.28.010 that the prop\nerty be taxed “at the rate of taxation that applies to other\nproperty taxed by the city,” it seems clear that petitioner’s\nships are taxed in the “same manner” as other property\neven as the plurality uses that term.\n   My view of the case would be the same even if the tax on\nproperty used in oil production were imposed by the State\nitself, as the plurality assumes.          Whether the oil\nproduction tax and the challenged tax are levied by the\nsame unit of government has no relevance to the question\nwhether the latter violates the Constitution. The restric\ntion imposed by the Tonnage Clause is a command to the\n——————\n  4 As the plurality notes, ante, at 10–11, Valdez did not raise this issue\n\nin state court, and the parties have provided only limited briefing on\nthe issue.\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           9\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nStates limiting their inherent taxing authority as sover\neigns. The States’ political subdivisions have no such\ninherent power and can levy taxes only to the extent\nauthorized by the State. See 16 E. McQuillin, Law of\nMunicipal Corporations §44.05, pp. 19–24 (rev. 3d ed.\n2003); see also Wiggins Ferry, 107 U. S., at 375 (noting\n“[t]he power of [a State] to authorize any city within her\nlimits to impose a license tax” on ferries). Indeed, this\naspect of the relationship between States and their politi\ncal subdivisions is reflected in Alaska Stat. §43.56.010(b),\nwhich authorizes municipalities to levy certain taxes and\nprevents them from exempting particular property from\ntaxation. Because the city’s power to levy taxes derives\nfrom the State, whether the city or the State levies the tax\non oil-production property is constitutionally irrelevant.\n   Finally, it bears mention that the result in this particu\nlar case does nothing to further the interests the Tonnage\nClause was intended to protect. As the Court acknowl\nedges, ante, at 4, the central purpose of the Clause is “to\nprevent the seaboard States, possessed of important ports\nof entry, from levying taxes on goods flowing through their\nports to inland States,” Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v.\nBowers, 358 U. S. 534, 556 (1959) (Frankfurter, J., dis\nsenting in part). Port Valdez is at the southern terminus\nof the Trans Alaska Pipeline System, which carries oil\nextracted from Alaska’s North Slope to Port Valdez where\nit is loaded onto oil tankers belonging to petitioner and\nothers for transport to refineries in other States. Taxes\nimposed on ships exporting that oil have the same effect\non commerce in oil as do taxes on oil-production property\nor the oil itself, and Alaska’s authority to impose taxes on\noil and oil-production property is undisputed. From an\neconomic or political point of view, there is no difference\nbetween Alaska’s geographical control over the area in\nwhich the oil is produced and the port from which it is\nexported. Accordingly, no federal interest is served by\n10        POLAR TANKERS, INC. v.

Were\nthat not the case, the challenged tax would still be permis\nsible because Valdez also taxes mobile homes, trailers, and\na wide variety of property used in producing oil. Because\nthe tax in my view does not run afoul of the prohibitions of\nthe Tonnage Clause, I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 145862, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2009/06/15/Polar_Tankers_Inc._v._City_of_Valdez.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2008                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued April 1, 2009—Decided June 15, 2009\nA Valdez, Alaska, ordinance that imposes a personal property tax on\n  certain boats and vessels contains exceptions which, in effect, largely\n  limit its applicability to large oil tankers. Petitioner Polar Tankers,\n  Inc., whose vessels transport crude oil from the Port of Valdez to re\n  fineries in other States, challenged the ordinance in state court,\n  claiming (1) that the tax was unconstitutional under Art. I, §10, cl. 3,\n  which forbids a “State . . . without the Consent of Congress, [to] lay\n  any Duty of Tonnage,” and (2) that the tax’s value-allocation method\n  violated the Commerce and Due Process Clauses. The court rejected\n  the Tonnage Clause claim, but accepted the Commerce Clause and\n  Due Process Clause claim. On appeal, the State Supreme Court up\n  held the tax, finding that because it was a value-based property tax,\n  the tax was not a duty of tonnage. The State Supreme Court also\n  held the allocation method was fair and thus valid under the Com\n  merce and Due Process Clauses.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n182 P. 3d 614, reversed and remanded.\n    JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to\n  Parts I, II–A, and II–B–1, concluding that Valdez’s tax violates the\n  Tonnage Clause. Consequently, Polar Tankers’ alternative Com\n  merce Clause and Due Process Clause arguments need not be consid\n  ered. Pp. 3–8.\n    (a) This Court has consistently interpreted the language of the\n  Tonnage Clause in light of its purpose, which mirrors the intent of\n  other constitutional provisions that seek to restrain the States from\n  exercising the taxing power in a way that is injurious to the interests\n  of other States. The Clause seeks to prevent States from nullifying\n  Art. I, §10, cl. 2’s prohibition against import and export duties by tax\n  ing “the vessels transporting the merchandise.” Clyde Mallory Lines\n2              POLAR TANKERS, INC. v.

It also\n    reflects an effort to diminish a State’s ability to obtain tax advan\n    tages based on its favorable geographic position. Because the Clause\n    forbids a State to “do that indirectly which she is forbidden . . . to do\n    directly,” Passenger Cases, 7 How. 283, 458, the “prohibition against\n    tonnage duties has been deemed to embrace all taxes and duties re\n    gardless of their name or form, and even though not measured by the\n    tonnage of the vessel, which operate to impose a charge for the privi\n    lege of entering, trading in, or lying in a port,” Clyde Mallory Lines,\n    supra, at 265–266. Pp. 3–6.\n       (b) This case lies at the heart of what the Tonnage Clause forbids.\n    The ordinance seems designed to impose “a charge for the privilege of\n    entering, trading in, or lying in a port.” The tax applies almost ex\n    clusively to oil tankers, but to no other form of personal property. An\n    oil tanker can be subject to the tax based on a single entry into the\n    port. Moreover, the tax is closely correlated with cargo capacity.\n    Contrary to Valdez’s argument, the fact that the tax is designed to\n    raise revenue for general municipal services argues for, not against,\n    application of the Clause. Pp. 6–8.\n       JUSTICE BREYER, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE KENNEDY, and\n    JUSTICE GINSBURG, rejected, in Part II–B–2, Valdez’s claim that, under\n    State Tonnage Tax Cases, 12 Wall. 204, its tax is “not within the pro\n    hibition of the Constitution,” because it is “levied . . . upon ships . . .\n    as property, based on a valuation of the same as property,” id., at 213\n    (emphasis deleted). This Court later made clear that the “prohibi\n    tion” against tonnage duties “comes into play” where vessels “are not\n    taxed in the same manner as the other property of the citizens,”\n    Transportation Co. v. Wheeling, 99 U. S. 273, 284. This qualification,\n    important in light of the Clause’s purpose, means that, in order to\n    fund services by taxing ships, a State must also impose similar taxes\n    upon other businesses. Valdez fails to satisfy this requirement. The\n    Court can find little, if any, other personal property that Valdez\n    taxes. Because its value-related property tax on mobile homes, trail\n    ers, and recreational vehicles applies only if they are “affixed” to a\n    particular site, it taxes those vehicles as a form of real, not personal,\n    property. Valdez also claims that its ship tax is simply another form\n    of a value-based tax on oil-related property provided by state law.\n    But Valdez’s tax, a purely a municipal tax, differs from the tax on\n    other oil-related property, which is primarily a state-level tax, in sev\n    eral ways. As a result of these differences, an ordinary oil-related\n    business finding the tax on its movable property too burdensome\n    must complain to the State, which is in charge of setting the manner\n    of assessment and valuation. At the same time, an oil tanker finding\n    its vessel tax too burdensome must complain to Valdez, for the State\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  has nothing to do with that tax’s rate, valuation, or assessment.\n  There is also no effective electorate-related check on Valdez’s vessel\n  taxing power comparable to the check available when a property tax\n  is more broadly imposed. Valdez’s property tax hits only ships; it is\n  not constrained by any need to treat ships and other business prop\n  erty alike. Thus, Valdez’s tax lacks the safeguards implied by this\n  Court’s statements that a property tax on ships escapes the Tonnage\n  Clause’s scope only when that tax is imposed upon ships “in the same\n  manner” as it is imposed on other forms of property. Pp. 8–13.\n     THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE THOMAS, agreed that Valdez’s\n  tax is unconstitutional, but concluded that the city’s argument that its\n  tax may be sustained as a property tax similar to ones the city imposes\n  on other property should be rejected because an unconstitutional tax on\n  maritime commerce does not become permissible when bundled with\n  taxes on other activities or property. Pp. 1–3.\n     JUSTICE ALITO agreed that Valdez’s tax is unconstitutional, but con\n  cluded that the tax is an unconstitutional duty of tonnage even if the\n  Tonnage Clause permits a true, evenhanded property tax to be ap\n  plied to vessels.

I,\n§10, cl. 3. The city of Valdez, Alaska, has enacted an\nordinance that imposes a personal property tax upon the\nvalue of large ships that travel to and from that city. We\nhold that the ordinance violates the Clause.\n                             I\n   In 1999, the city of Valdez, Alaska (City), adopted an\nordinance imposing a personal property tax upon “[b]oats\nand vessels of at least 95 feet in length” that regularly\ntravel to the City, are kept or used within the City, or\nwhich annually take on at least $1 million worth of cargo\nor engage in other business transactions of comparable\nvalue in the City. Valdez Ordinance No. 99–17 (1999)\n(codified as Valdez Municipal Code §3.12.020 (2008)). The\nordinance contains exceptions that, in effect, limit the\ntax’s applicability primarily to large oil tankers. Ibid.\n2         POLAR TANKERS, INC. v. CITY OF VALDEZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAnd the City applies the tax in accordance with a value­\nallocation system that adjusts the amount owed down­\nwards insofar as the tankers spend time in other ports.\nValdez, Alaska Resolution No. 00–15, App. to Pet. for Cert.\n53a–56a.\n    Polar Tankers, Inc., a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips,\nowns vessels that transport crude oil from a terminal in\nthe Port of Valdez (located at the southern end of the\nTrans Alaska Pipeline System) to refineries in California,\nHawaii, and Washington. In August 2000, Polar Tankers\nfiled a lawsuit in Alaska Superior Court challenging the\ntax as unconstitutional. Polar Tankers argued that the\ntax effectively imposed a fee on certain vessels for the\nprivilege of entering the port; hence it amounted to a\nconstitutionally forbidden “Duty of Tonnage.” It also\nargued that the tax calculation method (as applied to\nvessels with a tax situs elsewhere) violated the Commerce\nand Due Process Clauses by failing to take account of the\ntime a ship spent at sea or being serviced or repaired.\nPolar Tankers said that the method thereby overstated\nthe percentage of the ship’s total earning capacity rea­\nsonably allocated to time spent in the Port of Valdez.\n    The Alaska Superior Court rejected the Tonnage\nClause claim, but it accepted the Commerce Clause and\nDue Process Clause claim. And, for that reason, it held\nthe tax unconstitutional. On appeal, the Alaska Supreme\nCourt, rejecting both claims, upheld the tax. In respect to\nthe Tonnage Clause claim, the Supreme Court noted that\nValdez’s tax was a value-based property tax designed to\npay for “services available to all taxpayers in the city,”\nincluding Polar Tankers; and it concluded that “a charge\nbased on the value of property is not a duty of tonnage.”\n182 P. 3d 614, 623 (2008) (citing Transportation Co. v.\nWheeling, 99 U. S. 273 (1879)). In respect to the Com­\nmerce Clause and Due Process Clause claim, the Supreme\nCourt held that Valdez’s allocation method was fair, hence\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

And we granted its petition in\norder to do so.\n                                 II \n\n                                 A\n\n   We begin, and end, with Polar Tankers’ Tonnage\nClause claim. We hold that Valdez’s tax is unconstitu­\ntional because it violates that Clause. And we conse­\nquently need not consider Polar Tankers’ alternative\nCommerce Clause and Due Process Clause argument.\n    When the Framers originally wrote the Tonnage\nClause, the words it uses, “Duty of Tonnage,” referred in\ncommercial parlance to “a duty” imposed upon a ship,\nwhich duty varies according to “the internal cubic capacity\nof a vessel,” i.e., its tons of carrying capacity. Clyde Mal\nlory Lines v. Alabama ex rel. State Docks Comm’n, 296\nU. S. 261, 265 (1935) (citing Inman S. S. Co. v. Tinker, 94\nU. S. 238, 243 (1877)); see also T. Cooley, Constitutional\nLimitations 596 (6th ed. 1890). Over a century ago, how­\never, this Court found that the Framers intended those\nwords to refer to more than “a duty” that sets a “certain\nrate on each ton” of capacity. Steamship Co. v. Portwar\ndens, 6 Wall. 31, 34 (1867).\n   The Court over the course of many years has consis­\ntently interpreted the language of the Clause in light of its\npurpose, a purpose that mirrors the intent of other consti­\ntutional provisions which, like the Tonnage Clause itself,\nseek to “restrai[n] the states themselves from the exercise”\nof the taxing power “injuriously to the interests of each\nother.” J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the\nUnited States §497, p. 354 (1833) (abridged version).\nArticle I, §10, cl. 2, for example, forbids States to “lay any\nImposts or Duties on Imports or Exports.” It thereby\nseeks to prevent states with “convenient ports” from plac­\n4         POLAR TANKERS, INC. v. CITY OF VALDEZ\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning other States at an economic disadvantage by laying\nlevies that would “ta[x] the consumption of their\nneighbours.” 3 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787,\npp. 542, 519 (M. Farrand rev. 1966) (reprinting James\nMadison, Preface to Debates in the Convention of 1787\nand letter from James Madison to Professor Davis, 1832).\nThe coastal States were not to “take advantage of their\nfavorable geographical position in order to exact a price for\nthe use of their ports from the consumers dwelling in less\nadvantageously situated parts of the country.” Youngs\ntown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers, 358 U. S. 534, 556–557\n(1959) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).\n   In writing the Tonnage Clause, the Framers recognized\nthat, if “the states had been left free to tax the privilege of\naccess by vessels to their harbors the prohibition against\nduties on imports and exports could have been nullified by\ntaxing the vessels transporting the merchandise.” Clyde\nMallory Lines, supra, at 265. And the Court has under­\nstood the Tonnage Clause as seeking to prevent that\nnullification. See Steamship Co., supra, at 34–35; see also\nPacket Co. v. Keokuk, 95 U. S. 80, 87 (1877); Gibbons v.\nOgden, 9 Wheat. 1, 202 (1824). It has also understood the\nClause as reflecting an effort to diminish a State’s ability\nto obtain certain geographical vessel-related tax advan­\ntages whether the vessel in question transports goods\nbetween States and foreign nations or, as here, only be­\ntween the States. Compare Inman, supra (invalidating a\nfee applied to ships engaged in foreign commerce), with\nSteamship Co., supra (invalidating a tax applied to ships\nengaged in interstate commerce).\n   Interpreting the Clause in light of its “intent,” id., at\n34, the Court has read its language as forbidding a State\nto “do that indirectly which she is forbidden . . . to do\ndirectly.” Passenger Cases, 7 How. 283, 458 (1849). Thus,\nthe Court has said that the Clause, which literally forbids\na State to “levy a duty or tax . . . graduated on the ton­\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnage,” must also forbid a State to “effect the same purpose\nby merely changing the ratio, and graduating it on the\nnumber of masts, or of mariners, the size and power of the\nsteam-engine, or the number of passengers which she\ncarries.” Id., at 458–459. A State cannot take what would\notherwise amount to a tax on the ship’s capacity and evade\nthe Clause by calling that tax “a charge on the owner or\nsupercargo,” thereby “justify[ing] this evasion of a great\nprinciple by producing a dictionary or a dictum to prove\nthat a ship-captain is not a vessel, nor a supercargo an\nimport.” Id., at 459.\n   The Court has consequently stated that the Tonnage\nClause prohibits, “not only a pro rata tax . . ., but any duty\non the ship, whether a fixed sum upon its whole tonnage,\nor a sum to be ascertained by comparing the amount of\ntonnage with the rate of duty.” Steamship Co., supra, at\n35. And, summarizing earlier cases while speaking for a\nunanimous Court, Justice Stone concluded that the “pro­\nhibition against tonnage duties has been deemed to em­\nbrace all taxes and duties regardless of their name or\nform, and even though not measured by the tonnage of the\nvessel, which operate to impose a charge for the privilege\nof entering, trading in, or lying in a port.” Clyde Mallory\nLines, supra, at 265–266. Cf. Cannon v. New Orleans, 20\nWall. 577 (1874) (invalidating a tax imposed on ships\nentering a port, which tax was graduated based on the\nships’ capacity and length of stay); Inman, supra (invali­\ndating a fee imposed on ships of a certain capacity that\nentered a port); Steamship Co., supra (invalidating a flat\ntax imposed on every ship that entered a port, regardless\nof the ship’s capacity).\n   Although the Clause forbids all charges, whatever their\nform, that impose “a charge for the privilege of entering,\ntrading in, or lying in a port,” nothing in the history of the\nadoption of the Clause, the purpose of the Clause, or this\nCourt’s interpretation of the Clause suggests that it oper­\n6         POLAR TANKERS, INC. v. CITY OF VALDEZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nates as a ban on any and all taxes which fall on vessels\nthat use a State’s port, harbor, or other waterways. See\npost, at 1–2 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in part and con­\ncurring in judgment). Such a radical proposition would\ntransform the Tonnage Clause from one that protects\nvessels, and their owners, from discrimination by seaboard\nStates, to one that gives vessels preferential treatment\nvis-à-vis all other property, and its owners, in a seaboard\nState. The Tonnage Clause cannot be read to give vessels\nsuch “preferential treatment.” Cf. Michelin Tire Corp. v.\nWages, 423 U. S. 276, 287 (1976) (noting, in a related\ncontext, that the Import-Export Clause “cannot be read to\naccord imported goods preferential treatment that permits\nescape from uniform taxes imposed without regard to\nforeign origin for services which the State supplies”). See\nalso infra this page and 7–11.\n                               B\n                               1\n   Does the tax before us impose “a charge for the privilege\nof entering, trading in, or lying in a port”? Certainly, the\nordinance that imposes the tax would seem designed to do\nso. It says that the tax applies to ships that travel to (and\nleave) the City’s port regularly for business purposes, that\nare kept in the City’s port, that take on more than $1\nmillion in cargo in that port, or that are involved in busi­\nness transactions in that amount there. In practice, the\ntax applied in its first year to 28 vessels, of which 24 were\noil tankers, 3 were tugboats, and 1 was a passenger cruise\nship. App. 53. The ordinance applies the tax to no other\nform of personal property. See Valdez Municipal Code\n§3.12.030(A)(2) (2008).\n    Moreover, the tax’s application and its amount depend\nupon the ship’s capacity. That is to say, the tax applies\nonly to large ships (those at least 95 feet in length), while\nexempting small ones. See §3.12.020(A)(1).\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    Nor can Valdez escape application of the Clause by\nclaiming that the ordinance imposes, not a duty or a tax,\nbut a fee or a charge for “services rendered” to a “vessel,”\nsuch as “pilotage,” “wharfage,” “medical inspection,” the\n“use of locks,” or the like. Clyde Mallory Lines, 296 U. S.,\nat 266; see also Inman, 94 U. S., at 243. To the contrary,\nthe ordinance creates a tax designed to raise revenue used\nfor general municipal services. See 182 P. 3d, at 623;\nValdez, Alaska Resolution No. 00–15, App. to Pet. for Cert.\n53a–56a. Tonnage Clause precedent makes clear that,\nwhere a tax otherwise qualifies as a duty of tonnage, a\ngeneral, revenue-raising purpose argues in favor of, not\nagainst, application of the Clause. See Steamship Co., 6\nWall., at 34.\n   This case lies at the heart of what the Tonnage Clause\nforbids. The ordinance applies almost exclusively to oil\ntankers. And a tax on the value of such vessels is closely\ncorrelated with cargo capacity. Because the imposition of\nthe tax depends on a factor related to tonnage and that\ntonnage-based tax is not for services provided to the ves­\nsel, it is unconstitutional.\n   The dissent contends that the tax does not operate as “a\ncharge for the privilege of entering, trading in, or lying in\na port,” Clyde Mallory Lines, supra, at 265–266—that is,\nas an impermissible tonnage duty—because Valdez levies\nits tax only upon vessels that meet a “tax situs” require­\nment. See post, at 6–7 (opinion of STEVENS, J.). But in\nthis case, the distinction the dissent draws between ton­\nnage duties and property taxes is a distinction without a\ndifference. That is because to establish a tax situs under\nthe tax challenged here, an oil tanker needs only to enter\nthe port and load oil worth more than $1 million. And, as\nPolar Tankers notes, oil tankers routinely carry millions of\nbarrels of oil at a time worth well in excess of $1 million.\nReply Brief for Petitioner 6. Thus, by virtue of a single\nentry into the port, “trading” once in that port, or “lying”\n8         POLAR TANKERS, INC. v. CITY OF VALDEZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nonce in that port, a tanker automatically establishes a tax\nsitus in Valdez. No one claims that this basis for estab­\nlishing a tax situs is insufficient under the Constitution.\nAfter all, a nondomiciliary jurisdiction may constitution­\nally tax property when that property has a “substantial\nnexus” with that jurisdiction, and such a nexus is estab­\nlished when the taxpayer “avails itself of the substantial\nprivilege of carrying on business” in that jurisdiction. See\nJapan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434,\n441–445 (1979) (internal quotation marks omitted); Mobil\nOil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes of Vt., 445 U. S. 425,\n437 (1980) (same); Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U. S.\n298, 312 (1992). Here, the City identified the 28 vessels\nthat were subject to the tax in the year 2000. But the City\nfails to point to a single oil tanker, or any vessel greater\nthan 95 feet in length, that both entered the port and\nfailed to establish a tax situs. See App. 53. What else is\nneeded to show that a tax characterized as one on property\nmay nevertheless function as a “charge for the privilege of\nentering . . . a port”?\n\n                               2\n   Valdez does not deny that its tax operates much like a\nduty applied exclusively to ships. But, like the Alaska\nSupreme Court, it points to language in an earlier Court\nopinion explicitly stating that “[t]axes levied . . . upon\nships . . . as property, based on a valuation of the same as\nproperty, are not within the prohibition of the Constitu­\ntion.” State Tonnage Tax Cases, 12 Wall. 204, 213 (1871)\n(emphasis deleted); cf. 182 P. 3d, at 622, and n. 43. Valdez\nsays that its tax is just such a value-related tax on per­\nsonal property and consequently falls outside the scope of\nthe Clause. Brief for Respondent 16–23.\n   Our problem with this argument, however, is that the\nCourt later made clear that the Clause does not apply to\n“taxation” of vessels “as property in the same manner as\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nother personal property owned by citizens of the State.”\n“[W]here” vessels “are not taxed in the same manner as\nthe other property of the citizens,” however, the “prohibi­\ntion . . . comes into play.” Wheeling, 99 U. S., at 284 (em­\nphasis added).\n    Viewed in terms of the purpose of the Clause, this\nqualification is important. It means that, in order to fund\nservices by taxing ships, a State must also impose similar\ntaxes upon other businesses. And that fact may well\noperate as a check upon a State’s ability to impose a tax on\nships at rates that reflect an effort to take economic ad­\nvantage of the port’s geographically based position. After\nall, the presence of other businesses subject to the tax,\nparticularly businesses owned and operated by state\nresidents, threatens political concern and a potential\nballot-box issue, were rates, say, to get out of hand. See\nCooley v. Board of Wardens of Port of Philadelphia ex rel.\nSoc. for Relief of Distressed Pilots, 12 How. 299, 315\n(1852); cf. South Carolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell\nBrothers, Inc., 303 U. S. 177, 185, n. 2 (1938) (when state\naction affecting interstate commerce “is of such a charac­\nter that its burden falls principally upon those without the\nstate, legislative action is not likely to be subjected to\nthose political restraints which are normally exerted on\nlegislation where it affects adversely some interests within\nthe state”).\n    Moreover, and at the very least, a “same manner”\nrequirement helps to assure that a value-related property\ntax differs significantly from a graduated tax on a ship’s\ncapacity and that the former is not simply a redesignation\nof the latter. See Packet Co., 95 U. S., at 88 (“ ‘It is the\nthing and not the name that is to be considered’ ” (quoting\nCooley, supra, at 314)).\n    In our view, Valdez fails to satisfy this requirement. It\ndoes not tax vessels “in the same manner as other per­\nsonal property” of those who do business in Valdez.\n10        POLAR TANKERS, INC. v. CITY OF VALDEZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nWheeling, supra, at 284. We can find little, if any, other\npersonal property that it taxes. According to the State of\nAlaska, Valdez specifically exempts from property taxa­\ntion motor vehicles, aircraft, and other vehicles, as well as\nbusiness machinery. See Dept. of Community and Eco­\nnomic Development, Division of Community and Business\nDevelopment, Office of the State Assessor, Alaska Taxable\n2001, p. 20 (Jan. 2002), (Table 4), online at\nhttp://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/Taxable/AKTaxable2\n001.pdf (as visited June 10, 2009, and available in Clerk of\nCourt’s case file).\n    We concede, as Valdez points out, that a different\nValdez ordinance imposes what it characterizes as a\nvalue-based property tax on mobile homes, trailers, and\nrecreational vehicles. Valdez Municipal Code §3.12.022\n(2008); Brief for Respondent 24–25. But that same ordi­\nnance exempts those vehicles from its property tax unless\nthey are “affixed” to a particular site. Hence, whatever\nwords the City uses to describe the tax imposed on mobile\nhomes, trailers, and recreational vehicles, Valdez in fact\ntaxes those vehicles only when they constitute a form, not\nof personal property, but of real property (like a home).\nSee §3.12.022 (providing that “trailers and mobile homes”\nare “subject to taxation” when they are classified as “real\nproperty”).\n    Valdez also points to a separate City ordinance that\nimposes a tax “on all taxable property taxable under\nAlaska Statutes Chapter 43.56.” §3.28.010 (2008). The\nAlaska Statutes Chapter identifies as taxable “aircraft\nand motor vehicles” the operation of which “relates to” the\n“exploration for, production of, or pipeline transportation\nof gas or unrefined oil.” Alaska Stat. §43.56.210 (2008).\nValdez claims that its tax on ships is simply another form\nof this value-related tax on oil-related property.\n    Valdez did not make this claim in the lower courts,\nhowever. Nor does the State of Alaska (which has filed a\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nbrief in support of Valdez) support this particular claim.\nBrief for State of Alaska et al. as Amici Curiae 32–33.\nThus, we lack the State’s explanation of just how the tax\non oil-related vehicles works. And, lacking precise infor­\nmation, we might ordinarily decline to consider this claim.\nSee, e.g., Clingman v. Beaver, 544 U. S. 581, 597–598\n(2005).\n    Nonetheless, the parties have argued the matter in\ntheir briefs here; and our deciding the matter now will\nreduce the likelihood of further litigation. We may make\nexceptions to our general approach to claims not raised\nbelow; and for these reasons we shall do so. See Granfi\nnanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, 39 (1989).\n    Addressing the claim on the basis of the briefs and\nwhat we have gleaned from publicly available sources, we\nnote that Valdez’s ship tax differs from the tax on other\noil-related property in several ways. The former is a\npurely municipal tax. The City imposes it; the City alone\ndetermines what property is subject to the tax; the City\nestablishes the rate of taxation; the City values the prop­\nerty; the City resolves evaluation disputes; the City issues\nassessment notices; the City collects the tax; and the City\n(as far as we can tell) keeps the revenue without any\nrestrictions. See Valdez Municipal Code §3.12.020(A)(1)\n(2008); §3.12.060; §3.12.020(B); §§3.12.090–3.12.100;\n§3.12.210(A) (2001); Valdez, Alaska Resolution No. 00–15,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 53a–56a.\n    The latter is primarily a state-level tax. The State\nimposes it. In fact, Valdez’s city manager characterized\nthe oil-property tax as involving “property taxed by the\nState . . . and [raising revenue] subsequently shared with\nthe City.” App. 46 (affidavit of Dave Dengel). In addition,\nthe State determines the type of property subject to the\ntax; the State forbids the municipality to exempt any\nproperty it designates as taxable; the State regulates the\nrate of taxation that may be applied to property it desig­\n12        POLAR TANKERS, INC. v. CITY OF VALDEZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nnates as taxable; the State issues assessment notices; the\nState resolves evaluation disputes; and the State, while\npermitting the municipality to set the precise tax rate and\nto collect the tax, imposes certain kinds of limits upon the\namount of the resulting revenue that the municipality\nmay raise that, in effect, provide a check against excessive\nrates.       See Alaska Stat. §43.56.010(b) (2008);\n§43.56.210(5)(A); 15 Alaska Admin. Code §56.010 (2009);\n§§56.015–56.040; Alaska Stat. §§29.45.080(b), (c) (2008);\n§43.56.010(c).\n   These differences matter. For one thing, they mean that\nany ordinary oil-related business, other than ships, that\nfinds the tax imposed upon its movable property too bur­\ndensome must complain to the State, not to the City, for it\nis the State that is in charge of setting the manner of\nassessment and valuation. At the same time, an oil\ntanker that finds the vessel tax too burdensome must\ncomplain to the City, not to the State, for the State has\nnothing to do with the rate, valuation, or assessment of\nthat particular tax.\n   For another thing, they mean that there is no effective\nelectorate-related check (comparable to the check avail­\nable where a property tax is more broadly imposed) upon\nthe City’s vessel-taxing power. The City’s property tax\nhits ships and only ships; it is not constrained by any need\nto treat ships and other business property alike. Taken\ntogether, these two considerations mean that Valdez’s\nproperty tax lacks the safeguards implied by this Court’s\nstatements that a property tax on ships escapes the scope\nof the Tonnage Clause only when that tax is imposed upon\nships “in the same manner” as it is imposed on other forms\nof property.\n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE contends that a State may never\nimpose a property tax on a vessel belonging to a citizen of\nanother State, even if that vessel is taxed in the “same\nmanner” as other personal property in the taxing state.\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

But, as THE CHIEF JUSTICE concedes, this\nCourt held in the State Tonnage Tax Cases and Wheeling\nthat vessels belonging to a State’s own citizens may be\nsubject to a property tax when the vessels are taxed in the\nsame manner as other personal property owned by citizens\nof that State. At the time those cases were decided, the\nhome port doctrine was still in effect, which meant that\nvessels were taxable solely by the owner’s domicile State.\nSince the State Tonnage Tax Cases and Wheeling, the\nhome port doctrine has been abandoned and States are\nnow permitted to tax vessels belonging to citizens of other\nStates that develop a tax situs in the nondomiciliary\nState, provided the tax is fairly apportioned. See, e.g., Ott\nv. Mississippi Valley Barge Line Co., 336 U. S. 169, 172–\n174 (1949); Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441\nU. S. 434, 442–443 (1979). Given this evolution in the law\ngoverning interstate taxation since our decisions in the\nState Tonnage Tax Cases and Wheeling, there is little\nreason to think that the ability of a State to tax vessels in\nthe “same manner” as other personal property applies only\nto vessels owned by citizens of the taxing State. In any\nevent, we need not decide this issue because it is clear that\nthe vessels subject to the City’s ordinance are not taxed in\nthe same manner as other personal property.\n\n\n   As far as we can tell, then, Valdez applies a value­\nbased personal property tax to ships and to no other prop­\nerty at all. It does so in order to obtain revenue for gen­\neral city purposes. The tax, no less than a similar duty,\nmay (depending upon rates) “ta[x] the consumption” of\nthose in other states. See 3 Records of the Federal Con­\nvention of 1787, at 519 (reprinting letter from James\nMadison to Professor Davis, 1832).

The plurality goes on, however, to reject the city’s\nargument that the tax may be sustained as a property tax\nsimilar to ones the city imposes on other property. The\nplurality rejects that argument on the ground that the city\nin fact does not impose similar taxes on other property.\nAnte, at 8–13. I would instead reject the argument on the\nground that it does not matter.\n   The Tonnage Clause applies to “any Duty of Tonnage,”\nregardless of how that duty compares to other commercial\ntaxes. U. S. Const., Art. I, §10, cl. 3. The free flow of\nmaritime commerce was so important to the Framers that\nthey grouped the prohibition on tonnage duties with bans\non keeping troops or ships of war, entering into compacts\nwith other States or foreign powers, and engaging in war.\nIbid. In light of the Framers’ goal to promote trade, and\nthe language of the Clause, I do not see how an unconsti\ntutional tax on maritime commerce becomes permissible\nwhen bundled with taxes on other activities or property.\nIf States wish to use their geographical position to tax\nnational maritime commerce, they must get Congress’s\n2         POLAR TANKERS, INC. v. CITY OF VALDEZ\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nconsent—just as they must to engage in the other activi\nties prohibited by Clause 3.\n   The majority responds that nothing in the history of the\nClause, its purpose, or this Court’s interpretation of it\nsuggests that it bans all taxes on vessels using a port.\nAnte, at 5. The majority’s list of interpretive tools tellingly\nleaves out one—the words the Framers used. The Clause\nby its terms provides that “No State shall, without the\nConsent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage.” U. S.\nConst., Art. I., §10, cl. 3 (emphasis added). The majority\ncorrectly concludes that the Valdez tax is a tonnage duty,\nante, at 7, and that should be the end of the matter.\n   The majority also objects that this approach would give\nvessels “preferential treatment,” when the Clause only\nprotects vessels from discrimination. Ante, at 6. But the\nClause says nothing about discrimination, and it should\nhardly come as a surprise that a constitutional ban on\ntonnage duties would give preferential treatment to ves\nsels. Such protection reflects the high value the Framers\nplaced on the free flow of maritime commerce. See State\nTonnage Tax Cases, 12 Wall. 204, 214 (1871) (“Prior to the\nadoption of the Constitution the States . . . levied duties on\nimports and exports and duties of tonnage, and it was the\nembarrassments growing out of such regulations and\nconflicting obligations which mainly led to the abandon\nment of the Confederation and to the more perfect union\nunder the present Constitution”).\n   The plurality appears to be driven to its tax-comparison\nanalysis only in responding to the city’s contention that\nthe tax is exempt from the Tonnage Clause under the\nState Tonnage Tax Cases, supra, and Transportation Co. v.\nWheeling, 99 U. S. 273 (1879). Neither of those cases has\nany bearing here.

We have never held that the\nTonnage Clause allows such property taxes to be imposed\non visiting ships. Doing so would allow easy evasion of the\nimportant principles of the Clause.\n   Both the plurality and JUSTICE STEVENS suggest that\nthe evolution of the “home port doctrine” sheds light on\nhow to read the Tonnage Clause. See ante, at 12–13; post,\nat 3, n. 1 (dissenting opinion). I disagree. Under the home\nport doctrine, Polar Tankers “could not be taxed in [Val\ndez] at all,” even if the tax were not a tonnage duty. Ja\npan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434, 442\n(1979); Hays v. Pacific Mail S. S. Co., 17 How. 596, 599\n(1855). In contrast, the Tonnage Clause forbids only\ntonnage duties, and would permit Valdez to impose other\ntaxes on visiting ships—for example, “a reasonable charge\nfor” the service of “policing of a harbor.” Clyde Mallory\nLines v. Alabama ex rel. State Docks Comm’n, 296 U. S.\n261, 267, 266 (1935). The demise of the home port doc\ntrine is in no way inconsistent with reading the Tonnage\nClause, as written, to ban all tonnage duties. See Japan\nLine, supra, at 439, n. 3 (rejecting home port doctrine\nwhile expressly not reaching Tonnage Clause argument).\n   In any case, because the Court has determined that\nValdez’s tax is unlike other municipal taxes, it does not\ndecide whether a tonnage duty would be unconstitutional\nwhen other similar property is taxed. See ante, at 13;\npost, at 1 (ALITO, J., concurring in part and concurring in\nthe judgment). Whatever other taxes the city might im\npose, this tax “operate[s] to impose a charge for the privi\nlege of entering . . . or lying in” the port of Valdez, and is a\nduty of tonnage for that reason. Clyde Mallory, supra, at\n265–266. I therefore concur in the judgment.\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

S. Const., Art. I, §10, cl. 3. As the Court asserts,\nthe purpose of the Clause is to prevent States with conven\nient ports from abusing the privileges their natural posi\ntion affords. See ante, at 3–4. Thus, the pertinent inquiry\nin determining whether an exaction violates the Clause’s\nprohibitions is whether the charge is “ ‘in its essence a\ncontribution claimed for the privilege of arriving and\ndeparting from a port.’ ” Transportation Co. v. Wheeling,\n99 U. S. 273, 283–284 (1879) (quoting Cannon v. New\nOrleans, 20 Wall. 577, 581 (1874)); see Clyde Mallory\nLines v. Alabama ex rel. State Docks Comm’n, 296 U. S.\n261, 265–266 (1935). In applying that principle, we have\nbeen cognizant of its limits.\n   By its terms, the Tonnage Clause prohibits States from\nimposing a duty on ships based on their internal cubic\ncapacity, see id., at 265, and it similarly prohibits charges\n2         POLAR TANKERS, INC. v.

By contrast, charges levied for other purposes\nare outside the Clause’s reach. This Court has often ap\nproved charges for services rendered to ships to ensure\ntheir safe and convenient use of a port. See Clyde Mallory,\n296 U. S., at 266–267. And the federal interest in protect\ning access to the ports generally does not prevent States\nfrom charging shipowners those taxes and fees that the\nStates are also authorized to levy on other property. See\nWiggins Ferry Co. v. East St. Louis, 107 U. S. 365, 375,\n376 (1883) (upholding a “license tax” “laid upon the busi\nness of keeping a ferry”); Wheeling, 99 U. S., at 279 (up\nholding a property tax on ships).\n   More than a century ago, we noted that it was “too well\nsettled to admit of question that taxes levied by a State,\nupon ships or vessels owned by the citizens of the State, as\nproperty, based on a valuation of the same as property, to\nthe extent of such ownership, are not within the prohibi\ntion of the Constitution.” Ibid. Just as “[d]raymen may be\ncompelled to pay a license tax on every dray owned by\nthem, hackmen on every hack, [and] tavernkeepers on\ntheir taverns in proportion to the number of the rooms\nwhich they keep for the accommodation of guests,” so too\ncan a State charge the operator of a ferry a “tax upon the\nboats which he employs.” Wiggins Ferry, 107 U. S., at 375.\n“[V]essels of all kinds are liable to taxation as property in\nthe same manner as other personal property owned by\ncitizens of the State.” Wheeling, 99 U. S., at 284; State\nTonnage Tax Cases, 12 Wall. 204, 212–213 (1871).\n   From Wheeling and the State Tonnage Tax Cases, two\nprinciples emerge regarding the circumstances under\nwhich States may levy property taxes on ships. First, the\n                      Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                      3\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nState seeking to levy the tax must show that the ship has\nsufficient contacts with the jurisdiction to establish a tax\nsitus there. In our earlier cases, the existence of the situs\nwas determined by the citizenship of the ship’s owner, see\nWheeling, 99 U. S., at 279; State Tonnage Tax Cases, 12\nWall., at 213, but a tax situs can also be created by a\nproperty’s substantial contacts with a jurisdiction.1 The\nrequirement of a tax situs serves to distinguish property\ntaxes from fees charged for the privilege of entering a port,\nwhich the Court has consistently found to violate the\nprohibition against duties of tonnage. See, e.g., Cannon,\n20 Wall., at 581 (holding unconstitutional “a tax upon\nevery vessel which stops” in the city’s jurisdictional wa\nters); Steamship Co. v. Portwardens, 6 Wall. 31, 33 (1867)\n(invalidating a tax imposed “upon every ship entering the\nport” and “collected upon every entry”).\n   Our cases also require that property taxes on ships, as\nwith other property, be calculated based on the ship’s\n\n——————\n   1 Previously, courts followed the common-law “home port” doctrine,\n\npursuant to which a ship could be taxed only by the State in which its\nowner was domiciled. See Pullman’s Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania,\n141 U. S. 18, 23–24 (1891). That doctrine has since “yielded to a rule of\nfair apportionment among the States,” permitting any jurisdiction with\nwhich a ship has had sufficient contacts to establish a tax situs to levy\na property tax on the ship in proportion to the ship’s contacts with the\njurisdiction. See Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S.\n434, 442–443 (1979); see also Standard Oil Co. v. Peck, 342 U. S. 382,\n383 (1952). We have roundly rejected the doctrine in cases involving\nships moving in interstate operations along the inland waters. See\nibid. And in the context of ocean-going ships, we have referred to the\ndoctrine as “ ‘anachronistic’ ” and all but “ ‘abandoned,’ ” noting that “to\nrehabilitate the ‘home port doctrine’ as a tool of Commerce Clause\nanalysis would be somewhat odd.” Japan Line, 441 U. S., at 443. In\nlight of these developments, it is odd indeed that THE CHIEF JUSTICE\nendeavors to distinguish Transportation Co. v. Wheeling, 99 U. S. 273\n(1879), and the State Tonnage Tax Cases, 12 Wall. 204 (1871), as\n“apply[ing] only to taxation of property owned by citizens of the State.”\nSee ante, at 2 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\n4           POLAR TANKERS, INC. v. CITY OF VALDEZ\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nvalue. When a State levies a property tax on ships, the\nprohibition of the Tonnage Clause comes into play only if\nthe ships are “not taxed in the same manner as the other\nproperty of the citizens, or where the tax is imposed upon\nthe vessel as an instrument of commerce, without refer\nence to the value as property.” Wheeling, 99 U. S., at 284.\nAlthough the meaning of Wheeling’s “same manner” lan\nguage is not immediately apparent, the remainder of the\nopinion emphasizes the importance of the method by\nwhich the tax on the petitioner’s ships was calculated—\ni.e., “based on a valuation of the same as property”—\nrather than the city’s taxation of other property in the\njurisdiction. Id., at 279; see id., at 284.\n   Our decision in the State Tonnage Tax Cases is to the\nsame effect, as we held that taxes levied on ships “as\nproperty, based on a valuation of the same as property, are\nnot within the prohibition of the Constitution,” but if\nStates tax ships “by a tonnage duty, or indirectly by im\nposing the tax upon the master or crew, they assume a\njurisdiction which they do not possess.” 12 Wall., at 213,\n214 (emphasis in original). Indeed, each of the taxes\nchallenged in that case was invalidated because it was\n“levied on the steamboats wholly irrespective of the value\nof the vessels as property, and solely and exclusively on\nthe basis of their cubical contents.” Id., at 217; see id., at\n224 (holding the tax unconstitutional because “the amount\nof the tax depends upon the carrying capacity of the\nsteamboat and not upon her value as property”).2 Thus, in\n——————\n    2 The\n        Court seems to conflate these methods of calculating taxes on\nships, as it asserts that “a tax on the value of such vessels is closely\ncorrelated with cargo capacity” and concludes that the tax in this case\n“depends on a factor related to tonnage.” Ante, at 7; see also ante, at 1\n(opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). This is contrary to our longstanding recog\nnition that a ship’s capacity is not a proxy for its value: “[T]he experi\nence of every one shows that a small steamer, new and well built, may\nbe of much greater value than a large one, badly built or in need of\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                5\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nboth Wheeling and the State Tonnage Tax Cases, the\nmethod by which the challenged tax was calculated was\nessential to the Court’s determination of its validity.\n   The tax in this case has both of the critical characteris\ntics of a legitimate property tax. It is undisputed that\npetitioner’s ships “are taxed based on their value, and only\nthose [ships] that have acquired a taxable situs in Valdez\nare taxed.” 182 P. 3d 614, 622 (Alaska 2008). Accord\ningly, I would uphold the Alaska Supreme Court’s decision\nsustaining the tax against petitioner’s Tonnage Clause\nchallenge.\n   The plurality reaches the opposite conclusion because it\nreads Wheeling’s “same manner” language to impose a\ndifferent limitation on the States’ power to tax ships.\nAccording to the plurality, “in order to fund services by\ntaxing ships, a State must also impose similar taxes upon\nother businesses.” Ante, at 9. As discussed above, Wheel\ning and the State Tonnage Cases are better read to require\nthat property taxes on ships be assessed based on the\nvalue of the ship rather than its tonnage. But even if the\n“same manner” requirement did not clearly refer to the\nmethod of calculating the tax, the phrase could not bear\nthe weight the plurality places on it. And there is no other\nsupport in our cases or in the text of the Tonnage Clause\nfor a rule that conditions a State’s exercise of its admitted\nauthority to levy property taxes on ships upon its decision\nalso to tax other property within its jurisdiction.\n   Under the plurality’s reading, the same tax could be a\n“Duty of Tonnage” in one instance and not in another\ndepending on taxing decisions wholly outside the Clause’s\nreach. Far from being compelled by our earlier cases, this\nrule is in tension with our decisions noting the substantial\nflexibility States must be afforded in making taxing deci\nsions and cautioning courts not to “subject the essential\n—————— \n\nextensive repairs.” State Tonnage Tax Cases, 12 Wall., at 224. \n\n6         POLAR TANKERS, INC. v. CITY OF VALDEZ\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ntaxing power of the State to an intolerable supervision.”\nOhio Oil Co. v. Conway, 281 U. S. 146, 159 (1930). That\ntension is compounded by the inevitable difficulty States\nwill have in navigating the new rule, as the plurality does\nnot suggest at what point a State can be satisfied that it\nhas taxed enough other property that it may also tax ships\nwithout violating the Clause’s prohibitions.\n   In support of its understanding of the “same manner”\nrequirement, the plurality asserts that the rule “helps to\nassure that a value-related property tax differs signifi\ncantly from a graduated tax on a ship’s capacity and that\nthe former is not simply a redesignation of the latter.”\nAnte, at 9. But our cases provide such assurance without\nresort to the plurality’s strained reading. Because States\nand their political subdivisions only have authority to tax\nproperty that has established a tax situs in the jurisdic\ntion, they cannot levy such taxes on ships merely for the\nprivilege of entering or leaving the port; much more sub\nstantial contact with the jurisdiction is required. See\nValdez Municipal Code §3.12.020(C) (2008); Central R. Co.\nof Pa. v. Pennsylvania, 370 U. S. 607, 614–615 (1962).\nAnd it is that contact, rather than entry into the port, that\nprovides the basis for taxing the ships. The tax situs\nrequirement thus ensures that a State cannot avoid the\nproscriptions of the Tonnage Clause by redesignating a\nduty charged for the privilege of entering the port as an\nad valorem tax.\n   The facts of this case illustrate the point. Most of peti\ntioner’s ships spend 40-to-50 days per year in the Port of\nValdez. See App. 32–45. “[A]s a group the tankers form a\ncontinuous presence in the city.” 182 P. 3d, at 623. The\nships’ prolonged physical presence and extensive commer\ncial activities in the city have a substantial impact on the\ncity’s resources. On average, the ships’ presence adds 550\npeople to the population of Valdez, increasing the city’s\ntotal population by 10%. Those people, as well as the\n                      Cite as: 557 U.

Ibid. As the Alaska Supreme\nCourt concluded, the challenged tax is therefore a legiti\nmate property tax levied to support the ships’ use of the\ncity’s services. See ibid.\n                                II\n    Even if the Tonnage Clause were properly understood to\npermit a jurisdiction to levy a tax on ships only when\nother property in the jurisdiction is also taxed, I would\nuphold the challenged tax. Although the tax applies only\nto ships, see Valdez Municipal Code §3.12.020, other\nproperty in the city is also subject to taxation.\n    First, §3.12.022 imposes a value-based property tax on\ntrailers, mobile homes, and recreational vehicles that are\naffixed to a site and connected to utilities. The plurality\nmakes much of the requirement that the property be\n“ ‘affixed’ ” to a particular site, concluding that “Valdez in\nfact taxes those vehicles only when they constitute a form,\nnot of personal property, but of real property.” Ante, at 10.\nBut the taxability of property pursuant to §3.12.022 is\ndetermined in much the same way as the taxability of\nships. “A trailer or mobile home is conclusively presumed\nto be affixed to the land” and may therefore be taxed if “it\nhas remained at a fixed site for more than ninety days.”\n§3.12.022(C). Similarly, a ship owner can establish a tax\nsitus in Valdez and thus be subject to taxation if it is “kept\nor used within the city for any ninety days or more.”\n§3.12.020(C)(2)(c).3 In both cases, the provision serves to\nimpose a tax on property that has developed substantial\ncontacts with the city. The plurality is thus wrong to\n——————\n  3A ship can also establish a tax situs in Valdez if it is usually kept or\nused within the city, travels to or within the city along regular routes,\nor is necessary to the conduct of substantial business in the city.\n§3.12.020(C)(2).\n8            POLAR TANKERS, INC. v. CITY OF VALDEZ\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nconclude that ships have been singled out for taxation.\n   Valdez also “levie[s] a tax” on all property taxable under\nAlaska Statutes Chapter 43.56 at the same rate that\napplies to other property taxed by the city. Valdez Mu\nnicipal Code §3.28.010.4 The tax is imposed on property\nused “primarily in the exploration for, production of, or\npipeline transportation of gas or unrefined oil,” including\nmachinery, equipment, pumping stations, powerplants,\naircraft and motor vehicles, and docks and other port\nfacilities. See Alaska Stat. §§43.56.010, 43.56.210(5)(A)\n(2008). For several reasons, this tax is more significant\nthan the plurality acknowledges. First, contrary to the\nplurality’s view, the tax appears to be a municipal tax.\nValdez Municipal Code §3.28.010 states that the tax “is\nhereby levied” on “property taxable under Alaska Statutes\nChapter 43.56,” which in turn states that “[a] municipality\nmay levy” such taxes, §43.56.010(b). The terms of these\nprovisions indicate that the city has exercised its express\nauthority to levy such taxes. Given the myriad types of\nproperty taxable under those provisions and the require\nment of Valdez Municipal Code §3.28.010 that the prop\nerty be taxed “at the rate of taxation that applies to other\nproperty taxed by the city,” it seems clear that petitioner’s\nships are taxed in the “same manner” as other property\neven as the plurality uses that term.\n   My view of the case would be the same even if the tax on\nproperty used in oil production were imposed by the State\nitself, as the plurality assumes.          Whether the oil\nproduction tax and the challenged tax are levied by the\nsame unit of government has no relevance to the question\nwhether the latter violates the Constitution. The restric\ntion imposed by the Tonnage Clause is a command to the\n——————\n  4 As the plurality notes, ante, at 10–11, Valdez did not raise this issue\n\nin state court, and the parties have provided only limited briefing on\nthe issue.\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           9\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nStates limiting their inherent taxing authority as sover\neigns. The States’ political subdivisions have no such\ninherent power and can levy taxes only to the extent\nauthorized by the State. See 16 E. McQuillin, Law of\nMunicipal Corporations §44.05, pp. 19–24 (rev. 3d ed.\n2003); see also Wiggins Ferry, 107 U. S., at 375 (noting\n“[t]he power of [a State] to authorize any city within her\nlimits to impose a license tax” on ferries). Indeed, this\naspect of the relationship between States and their politi\ncal subdivisions is reflected in Alaska Stat. §43.56.010(b),\nwhich authorizes municipalities to levy certain taxes and\nprevents them from exempting particular property from\ntaxation. Because the city’s power to levy taxes derives\nfrom the State, whether the city or the State levies the tax\non oil-production property is constitutionally irrelevant.\n   Finally, it bears mention that the result in this particu\nlar case does nothing to further the interests the Tonnage\nClause was intended to protect. As the Court acknowl\nedges, ante, at 4, the central purpose of the Clause is “to\nprevent the seaboard States, possessed of important ports\nof entry, from levying taxes on goods flowing through their\nports to inland States,” Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v.\nBowers, 358 U. S. 534, 556 (1959) (Frankfurter, J., dis\nsenting in part). Port Valdez is at the southern terminus\nof the Trans Alaska Pipeline System, which carries oil\nextracted from Alaska’s North Slope to Port Valdez where\nit is loaded onto oil tankers belonging to petitioner and\nothers for transport to refineries in other States. Taxes\nimposed on ships exporting that oil have the same effect\non commerce in oil as do taxes on oil-production property\nor the oil itself, and Alaska’s authority to impose taxes on\noil and oil-production property is undisputed. From an\neconomic or political point of view, there is no difference\nbetween Alaska’s geographical control over the area in\nwhich the oil is produced and the port from which it is\nexported. Accordingly, no federal interest is served by\n10        POLAR TANKERS, INC. v. CITY OF VALDEZ\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nprohibiting Alaska or its political subdivisions from taxing\nthe oil-bearing ships that are continually present in the\nState’s ports.\n                             III\n  The Tonnage Clause permits a State to levy a property\ntax on ships whether or not it taxes other property. Were\nthat not the case, the challenged tax would still be permis\nsible because Valdez also taxes mobile homes, trailers, and\na wide variety of property used in producing oil. Because\nthe tax in my view does not run afoul of the prohibitions of\nthe Tonnage Clause, I respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145862/", "sha1": "1acd805d45bf9955e77bc19a26b30c1fdfe522b4", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-069", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:08:42"}
