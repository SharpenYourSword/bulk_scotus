Argued April 20, 2009—Decided June 8, 2009*\nThe Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA) prohibits suits\n  against other countries in American courts, 28 U. S. C. §1604, with\n  certain exceptions.     One exception, §1605(a)(7) (now repealed),\n  stripped a foreign state of immunity in any suit arising from certain\n  acts of terrorism that occurred when the state was designated as a\n  sponsor of terrorism under §6(j) of the Export Administration Act of\n  1979 or §620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.\n     Iraq was designated as a sponsor of terrorism in 1990, but in 2003,\n  following the American-led invasion of Iraq, Congress enacted the\n  Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act (EWSAA),\n  §1503 of which included a proviso clause (the second in a series of\n  eight) authorizing the President to “make inapplicable with respect to\n  Iraq [§]620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or any other provi\n  sion of law that applies to countries that have supported terrorism.”\n  Although President Bush exercised that authority, the D. C. Circuit\n  held in its 2004 Acree decision that the EWSAA did not permit the\n  President to waive §1605(a)(7), and thereby restore Iraq’s sovereign\n  immunity, for claims arising from actions Iraq took while designated\n  as a sponsor of terrorism.\n     Thereafter, Congress repealed §1605(a)(7) in §1083(b)(1)(A)(iii) of\n  the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (NDAA)\n  and replaced it with a new, roughly similar exception, §1083(a). The\n  NDAA also declared that nothing in EWSAA “ever authorized, di\n  rectly or indirectly, the making inapplicable of any provision of [the\n  FSIA] or the removal of the jurisdiction of any court” (thus purport\n——————\n  * Together with No. 08–539, Republic of Iraq et al. v.

BEATY\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    ing to ratify Acree), §1083(c)(4); and authorized the President to\n    waive “any provision of this section with respect to Iraq” under cer\n    tain conditions, §1083(d). On the same day the President signed the\n    NDAA into law he also waived all of §1083’s provisions as to Iraq.\n      Respondents filed these suits against Iraq in early 2003, alleging\n    mistreatment by Iraqi officials during and after the 1991 Gulf War.\n    Under Acree, the courts below refused to dismiss either case on juris\n    dictional grounds. The D. C. Circuit also rejected Iraq’s alternative\n    argument that even if §1605(a)(7)’s application to it survived the\n    President’s EWSAA waiver, the provision was repealed by NDAA\n    §1083(b)(1)(A)(iii); and that the President had waived NDAA\n    §1083(a)’s new exception with respect to Iraq under his §1083(d) au\n    thority. The court held instead that it retained jurisdiction over\n    cases pending against Iraq when the NDAA was enacted.\nHeld: Iraq is no longer subject to suit in federal court. Pp. 6–17.\n    (a) The District Court lost jurisdiction over both suits in May 2003,\n when the President exercised his EWSAA authority to make\n §1605(a)(7) “inapplicable with respect to Iraq.” Pp. 6–13.\n       (i) Iraq’s (and the United States’) reading of EWSAA §1503’s sec\n ond proviso as sweeping in §1605(a)(7)’s terrorism exception to for\n eign sovereign immunity is straightforward. In the proviso’s terms,\n the exception is a “provision of law” (indisputably) that “applies to”\n (strips immunity from) “countries that have supported terrorism” (as\n designated pursuant to certain statutory provisions). Because he ex\n ercised his waiver authority with respect to “all” provisions of law en\n compassed by the second proviso, his actions made §1605(a)(7) “inap\n plicable” to Iraq. Pp. 6–7.\n       (ii) Acree’s resistance to the above construction was based on a\n sophisticated attempt to construe EWSAA §1503’s second proviso as\n limiting that section’s principal clause, which authorized suspension\n of “any provision of the Iraq Sanctions Act of 1990.” While a proviso’s\n “general office . . . is to except something from the enacting clause, or\n to qualify and restrain its generality,” United States v. Morrow, 266\n U. S. 531, 534, another recognized use is “to introduce independent\n legislation,” id., at 535, which was the function of the proviso here.\n In any event, §1605(a)(7) falls within the scope of the proviso even\n accepting the narrower interpretation adopted by the Acree decision.\n Pp. 7–11.\n       (iii) Respondents’ other objections to the straightforward inter\n pretation of EWSAA §1503’s proviso are rejected. Pp. 11–12.\n       (iv) Nothing in the NDAA changes the above analysis. Although\n NDAA §1083(c)(4) appears to ratify Acree, this Court need not decide\n whether such a ratification is effective because §1083(d)(1) author\n ized the President to “waive any provision of this section with respect\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  to Iraq,” and he waived “all” such provisions, including §1083(c)(4).\n  Pp. 12–13.\n     (b) The Court rejects the argument that §1605(a)(7)’s inapplicabil\n  ity does not bar claims arising from Iraq’s conduct prior to the Presi\n  dent’s waiver. In order to exercise jurisdiction over these cases, the\n  District Court had to “apply” §1605(a)(7) with respect to Iraq, but the\n  President’s waiver made that provision “inapplicable.” No retroactiv\n  ity problem is posed by this construction, if only because the primary\n  conduct by Iraq that forms the basis for these suits actually occurred\n  before §1605(a)(7)’s enactment. Pp. 13–16.\n     (c) Respondents also argue that EWSAA §1503’s sunset clause—\n  under which “the authorities contained in [that] section” expired in\n  2005—revived §1605(a)(7) and restored jurisdiction as of the sunset\n  date. But expiration of the §1503 authorities is not the same as can\n  cellation of the effect of the prior valid exercise of those authorities.\n  Pp. 16–17.\nNo. 07–1090, and No. 08–539, 529 F. 3d 1187, reversed.\n\n  SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n                        Cite as: 556 U.

S. C. §1605(a)(7).\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  Under the venerable principle of foreign sovereign im\nmunity, foreign states are ordinarily “immune from the\njurisdiction of the courts of the United States and of the\nStates,” §1604. See generally Schooner Exchange v.\nMcFaddon, 7 Cranch 116 (1812). But the statute embody\ning that principle—the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act\nof 1976 (FSIA), 28 U. S. C. §1602 et seq.—recognizes a\nnumber of exceptions; if any of these is applicable, the\nstate is subject to suit, and federal district courts have\n2                REPUBLIC OF IRAQ v. BEATY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\njurisdiction to adjudicate the claim. §1330(a); Verlinden\nB. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 489 (1983).\n   In 1996, Congress added to the list of statutory excep\ntions one for state sponsors of terrorism, which was codi\nfied at 28 U. S. C. §1605(a)(7). Subject to limitations not\nrelevant here, that exception stripped immunity in any\nsuit for money damages\n    “against a foreign state for personal injury or death\n    that was caused by an act of torture, extrajudicial kill\n    ing, aircraft sabotage, hostage taking, or the provision\n    of material support or resources . . . for such an act . . .\n    except that the court shall decline to hear a claim un\n    der this paragraph—\n      “(A) if the foreign state was not designated as a\n    state sponsor of terrorism under section 6(j) of the Ex\n    port Administration Act of 1979 (50 U. S. C. App.\n    2405(j)) or section 620A of the Foreign Assistance\n    Act of 1961 (22 U. S. C. 2371) at the time the act\n    occurred . . . .”\nIn brief, §1605(a)(7) stripped immunity from a foreign\nstate for claims arising from particular acts, if those acts\nwere taken at a time when the state was designated as a\nsponsor of terrorism.\n                              B\n  In September 1990, Acting Secretary of State Lawrence\nEagleburger formally designated Iraq, pursuant to §6(j) of\nthe Export Administration Act of 1979, as redesignated\nand amended, 99 Stat. 135, 50 U. S. C. App. §2405(j), as “a\ncountry which has repeatedly provided support for acts of\ninternational terrorism,” 55 Fed. Reg. 37793. Over a\ndecade later, in March 2003, the United States and a\ncoalition of allies initiated military action against that\ncountry. In a matter of weeks, the regime of Iraqi dictator\nSaddam Hussein collapsed and coalition forces occupied\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nBaghdad. American attention soon shifted from combat\noperations to the longer term project of rebuilding Iraq,\nwith the ultimate goal of creating a stable ally in the\nregion.\n  Toward that end, Congress enacted in April 2003 the\nEmergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act\n(EWSAA), 117 Stat. 559. Section 1503 of that Act author\nized the President to “make inapplicable with respect to\nIraq section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or\nany other provision of law that applies to countries that\nhave supported terrorism.” Id., at 579. President George\nW. Bush exercised that authority to its fullest extent in\nMay 2003, declaring “inapplicable with respect to Iraq\nsection 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 . . . and\nany other provision of law that applies to countries that\nhave supported terrorism.” 68 Fed. Reg. 26459.\n  Shortly thereafter, the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the District of Columbia Circuit had occasion to con\nsider whether that Presidential action had the effect of\nrendering inapplicable to Iraq the terrorism exception to\nforeign sovereign immunity. The Court concluded in a\ndivided panel decision that the President’s EWSAA au\nthority did not permit him to waive §1605(a)(7), and\nthereby restore sovereign immunity to Iraq, for claims\narising from acts it had taken while designated as a spon\nsor of terror. Acree v. Republic of Iraq, 370 F. 3d 41, 48\n(2004). Because Iraq succeeded in having the claims\nagainst it dismissed on other grounds, id., at 59–60, it\ncould not seek certiorari to challenge the D. C. Circuit’s\ninterpretation of the EWSAA.\n                           C\n  There is yet another legislative enactment, and yet\nanother corresponding executive waiver, that bear on the\nquestion presented. The National Defense Authorization\nAct for Fiscal Year 2008 (NDAA), 122 Stat. 3, was passed\n4               REPUBLIC OF IRAQ v. BEATY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin January 2008. That Act (1) repealed the FSIA’s terror\nism exception, §1083(b)(1)(A)(iii); (2) replaced it with a\nnew, roughly similar exception, §1083(a); (3) declared that\nnothing in §1503 of the EWSAA had “ever authorized,\ndirectly or indirectly, the making inapplicable of any\nprovision of chapter 97 of title 28, United States Code, or\nthe removal of the jurisdiction of any court of the United\nStates” (thus purporting to ratify the Court of Appeals’\nAcree decision), §1083(c)(4), 122 Stat. 343; and (4) author\nized the President to waive “any provision of this section\nwith respect to Iraq” so long as he made certain findings\nand so notified Congress within 30 days, §1083(d), id., at\n343–344.\n  The last provision was added to the NDAA after the\nPresident vetoed an earlier version of the bill, which did\nnot include the waiver authority. The President’s veto\nmessage said that the bill “would imperil billions of dollars\nof Iraqi assets at a crucial juncture in that nation’s recon\nstruction efforts.” Memorandum to the House of Repre\nsentatives Returning Without Approval the “National\nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008,” 43\nWeekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 1641 (2007). Only when Con\ngress added the waiver authority to the NDAA did the\nPresident agree to approve it; and on the same day he\nsigned it into law he also officially waived “all provisions\nof section 1083 of the Act with respect to Iraq,” 73 Fed.\nReg. 6571 (2008).\n                             II\n  We consider today two cases that have been navigating\ntheir way through the lower courts against the backdrop of\nthe above-described congressional, military, Presidential,\nand judicial actions. Respondents in the Simon case are\nAmerican nationals (and relatives of those nationals) who\nallege that they were captured and cruelly mistreated by\nIraqi officials during the 1991 Gulf War.

Each set of respondents filed\nsuit in early 2003 against Iraq in the United States Dis\ntrict Court for the District of Columbia, alleging violations\nof local, federal, and international law.\n   Respondents invoked the terrorism exception to foreign\nsovereign immunity, and given Acree’s holding that the\nPresident had not rendered that statutory provision inap\nplicable to Iraq, the District Court refused to dismiss\neither case on jurisdictional grounds. In Beaty, after the\nDistrict Court denied Iraq’s motion to dismiss, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2487394\"><a href=\"/opinion/2487394/beaty-v-republic-of-iraq/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 524–529 (1985). In Simon, the\nDistrict Court determined that the claims were time\nbarred and dismissed on that alternative basis, Vine v.\nRepublic of Iraq, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2420414\"><a href=\"/opinion/2420414/vine-v-republic-of-iraq/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 25 (2006), after\nwhich the Simon respondents appealed.\n   In the Beaty appeal, Iraq (supported by the United\nStates as amicus) requested that the Court of Appeals for\nthe District of Columbia Circuit reconsider Acree’s holding\nen banc. The Court denied that request over the dissent of\nJudges Brown and Kavanaugh, and a panel then summa\nrily affirmed in an unpublished order the District Court’s\ndenial of Iraq’s motion to dismiss. No. 07–7057 (Nov. 21,\n2007) (per curiam), App. to Pet. for Cert. 1a–2a.\n   While the Simon appeal was still pending, Congress\nenacted the NDAA, and the Court of Appeals requested\nsupplemental briefing addressing the impact of that legis\nlation on the court’s jurisdiction. Iraq contended, as an\nalternative argument to its position that Acree was\nwrongly decided, that even if 28 U. S. C. §1605(a)(7)’s\napplication to Iraq survived the President’s EWSAA\nwaiver, the provision was repealed by §1083(b)(1)(A)(iii) of\n6               REPUBLIC OF IRAQ v. BEATY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe NDAA, 122 Stat. 341; and that the new terrorism\nexception to sovereign immunity—which was created by\nthe NDAA and codified at 28 U. S. C. A. §1605A (July\n2008 Supp.)—was waived by the President with respect to\nIraq pursuant to his NDAA authority.\n  The Court of Appeals rejected that argument, holding\ninstead, based on a close reading of the statutory text, that\n“the NDAA leaves intact our jurisdiction over cases . . .\nthat were pending against Iraq when the Congress en\nacted the NDAA.” 529 F. 3d 1187, 1194 (2008). The panel\nthen reversed the District Court’s determination that the\nSimon respondents’ claims were untimely, id., at 1195–\n1196, and rebuffed Iraq’s request for dismissal under the\npolitical question doctrine, id., at 1196–1198.\n  Iraq sought this Court’s review of both cases, asking us\nto determine whether under current law it remains sub\nject to suit in the federal courts. We granted certiorari,\n555 U. S. ___ (2009), and consolidated the cases.\n                            III \n\n                             A\n\n  Section 1503 of the EWSAA consists of a principal\nclause, followed by eight separate proviso clauses. The\ndispute in these cases concerns the second of the provisos.\nThe principal clause and that proviso read:\n    “The President may suspend the application of any\n    provision of the Iraq Sanctions Act of 1990: . . . Pro\n    vided further, That the President may make inappli\n    cable with respect to Iraq section 620A of the Foreign\n    Assistance Act of 1961 or any other provision of law\n    that applies to countries that have supported terror\n    ism . . . .” 117 Stat. 579.\nIraq and the United States both read the quoted proviso’s\nresidual clause as sweeping in the terrorism exception to\nforeign sovereign immunity. Certainly that reading is, as\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\neven the Acree Court acknowledged, “straightforward.”\n370 F. 3d, at 52.\n   Title 28 U. S. C. §1605(a)(7)’s exception to sovereign\nimmunity for state sponsors of terrorism stripped jurisdic\ntional immunity from a country unless “the foreign state\nwas not designated as a state sponsor of terrorism.” This\nis a “provision of law” (indisputably) that “applies to”\n(strips immunity from) “countries that have supported\nterrorism” (as designated pursuant to certain statutory\nprovisions). Of course the word “any” (in the phrase “any\nother provision of law”) has an “expansive meaning,”\nUnited States v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, 5 (1997), giving us\nno warrant to limit the class of provisions of law that the\nPresident may waive. Because the President exercised his\nauthority with respect to “all” provisions of law encom\npassed by the second proviso, his actions made §1605(a)(7)\n“inapplicable” to Iraq.\n   To a layperson, the notion of the President’s suspending\nthe operation of a valid law might seem strange. But the\npractice is well established, at least in the sphere of for\neign affairs. See United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export\nCorp., 299 U. S. 304, 322–324 (1936) (canvassing prece\ndents from as early as the “inception of the national gov\nernment”). The granting of Presidential waiver authority\nis particularly apt with respect to congressional elimina\ntion of foreign sovereign immunity, since the granting or\ndenial of that immunity was historically the case-by-case\nprerogative of the Executive Branch. See, e.g., Ex parte\nPeru, 318 U. S. 578, 586–590 (1943). It is entirely unre\nmarkable that Congress, having taken upon itself in the\nFSIA to “free the Government” from the diplomatic pres\nsures engendered by the case-by-case approach, Verlinden,\n461 U. S., at 488, would nonetheless think it prudent to\nafford the President some flexibility in unique circum\nstances such as these.\n8               REPUBLIC OF IRAQ v. BEATY \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              B\n\n   The Court of Appeals in Acree resisted the above con\nstruction, primarily on the ground that the relevant text is\nfound in a proviso. We have said that, at least presump\ntively, the “grammatical and logical scope [of a proviso] is\nconfined to the subject-matter of the principal clause.”\nUnited States v. Morrow, 266 U. S. 531, 534–535 (1925).\nUsing that proposition as a guide, the Acree panel strove\nmightily to construe the proviso as somehow restricting\nthe principal clause of EWSAA §1503, which authorized\nthe President to suspend “any provision of the Iraq Sanc\ntions Act of 1990,” 117 Stat. 579.\n   In the Court of Appeals’ view, the second proviso related\nto that subsection of the Iraq Sanctions Act (referred to in\nthe principal provision) which dictated that certain enu\nmerated statutory provisions, including §620A of the\nForeign Assistance Act of 1961 and “all other provisions of\nlaw that impose sanctions against a country which has\nrepeatedly provided support for acts of international ter\nrorism,” shall be fully enforced against Iraq. §586F(c), 104\nStat. 2051 (emphasis added). The panel understood the\nsecond EWSAA proviso as doing nothing more than clari\nfying that the authority granted by the principal clause (to\nsuspend any part of the Iraq Sanctions Act) included the\npower to make inapplicable to Iraq the various independ\nent provisions of law that §586F(c) of the Iraq Sanctions\nAct instructed to be enforced against Iraq—which might\notherwise continue to apply of their own force even with\nout the Iraq Sanctions Act. However, the residual clause\nof §586F(c) encompasses only provisions that “impose\nsanctions”; and, in the Court of Appeals’ view, that ex\ncludes §1605(a)(7), which is a rule going instead to the\njurisdiction of the federal courts. Thus, the EWSAA pro\nviso swept only as broadly as §586F(c), and therefore did\nnot permit the President to waive the FSIA terrorism\nexception.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   This is a highly sophisticated effort to construe the\nproviso as a limitation upon the principal clause. Ulti\nmately, however, we think that effort neither necessary\nnor successful. It is true that the “general office of a pro\nviso is to except something from the enacting clause, or to\nqualify and restrain its generality.” Morrow, supra, at\n534. But its general (and perhaps appropriate) office is\nnot, alas, its exclusive use. Use of a proviso “to state a\ngeneral, independent rule,” Alaska v. United States, 545\nU. S. 75, 106 (2005), may be lazy drafting, but is hardly a\nnovelty. See, e.g., McDonald v. United States, 279 U. S.\n12, 21 (1929). Morrow itself came with the caveat that a\nproviso is sometimes used “to introduce independent\nlegislation.” 266 U. S., at 535. We think that was its\noffice here. The principal clause granted the President a\npower; the second proviso purported to grant him an\nadditional power. It was not, on any fair reading, an\nexception to, qualification of, or restraint on the principal\npower.\n   Contrasting the second EWSAA proviso to some of the\nother provisos illustrates the point. For example, the first\nproviso cautioned that “nothing in this section shall affect\nthe applicability of the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation\nAct of 1992,” 117 Stat. 579, and the third forbade the\nexport of certain military equipment “under the authority\nof this section.” Ibid. Both of these plainly sought to\ndefine and limit the authority granted by the principal\nclause. The fourth proviso, however, mandated that “sec\ntion 307 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 shall not\napply with respect to programs of international organiza\ntions for Iraq,” ibid., and it is impossible to see how that\nself-executing suspension of a distinct statute in any way\ncabined or clarified the principal clause’s authorization to\nsuspend the Iraq Sanctions Act.\n   There are other indications that the second proviso’s\nwaiver authority was not limited to the statutory provi\n10              REPUBLIC OF IRAQ v. BEATY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsions embraced by §586F(c) of the Iraq Sanctions Act. If\nthat is all it was meant to accomplish, why would Con\ngress not simply have tracked §586F(c)’s residual clause?\nInstead of restricting the President’s authority to statutes\nthat “impose sanctions” on sponsors of terror, the EWSAA\nextended it to any statute that “applies” to such states.\nThat is undoubtedly a broader class.\n   Even if the best reading of the EWSAA proviso were\nthat it encompassed only statutes that impose sanctions or\nprohibit assistance to state sponsors of terrorism, see\nAcree, 370 F. 3d, at 54, we would disagree with the Court\nof Appeals’ conclusion that the FSIA exception is not such\na law. Allowing lawsuits to proceed certainly has the\nextra benefit of facilitating the compensation of injured\nvictims, but the fact that §1605(a)(7) targeted only foreign\nstates designated as sponsors of terrorism suggests that\nthe law was intended as a sanction, to punish and deter\nundesirable conduct. Stripping the immunity that foreign\nsovereigns ordinarily enjoy is as much a sanction as elimi\nnating bilateral assistance or prohibiting export of muni\ntions (both of which are explicitly mandated by §586F(c) of\nthe Iraq Sanctions Act). The application of this sanction\naffects the jurisdiction of the federal courts, but that fact\nalone does not deprive it of its character as a sanction.\n   It may well be that when Congress enacted the EWSAA\nit did not have specifically in mind the terrorism exception\nto sovereign immunity. The Court of Appeals evidently\nfound that to be of some importance. Id., at 56 (noting\nthere is “no reference in the legislative history to the\nFSIA”). But the whole value of a generally phrased resid\nual clause, like the one used in the second proviso, is that\nit serves as a catchall for matters not specifically contem\nplated—known unknowns, in the happy phrase coined by\nSecretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Pieces of Intelli\ngence: The Existential Poetry of Donald H. Rumsfeld 2 (H.\nSeely comp. 2003). If Congress wanted to limit the waiver\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

Certainly the exposure of Iraq to\nbillions of dollars in damages could be thought to jeopard\nize the statute’s goal of speedy reconstruction of that\ncountry. At least the President thought so. And in the\n“vast external realm, with its important, complicated,\ndelicate and manifold problems,” Curtiss-Wright Export\nCorp., 299 U. S., at 319, courts ought to be especially wary\nof overriding apparent statutory text supported by execu\ntive interpretation in favor of speculation about a law’s\ntrue purpose.1\n                              C\n  Respondents advance two other objections to the\nstraightforward interpretation of the EWSAA proviso.\nFirst, in a less compelling variant of the D. C. Circuit’s\napproach, the Simon respondents argue that “section 620A\nof the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or any other provi\nsion of law that applies to countries that have supported\nterrorism” means section 620A of the Foreign Assistance\nAct or any other provision of law cited therein. The provi\nsion would thus allow the President to make inapplicable\nto Iraq the statutes that §620A precludes from being used\nto provide support to terror-sponsoring nations. Not to\nput too fine a point upon it, that is an absurd reading, not\n\n——————\n   1 The eighth proviso of EWSAA §1503 says that absent further con\n\ngressional action, “the authorities contained in this section shall expire\non September 30, 2004.” 117 Stat. 579. The Court of Appeals ex\npressed doubt that Congress would have wanted federal-court jurisdic\ntion to disappear for a year and then suddenly return. Acree v. Repub\nlic of Iraq, 370 F. 3d 41, 56–57 (CADC 2004). Our analysis of the\nsunset provision, see Part V, infra, disposes of that concern.\n12              REPUBLIC OF IRAQ v. BEATY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nonly textually but in the result it produces: It would mean\nthat the effect of the EWSAA was to permit the President\nto exclude Iraq from, rather than include it within, such\nbeneficent legislation as the Food for Peace Act of 1966, 7\nU. S. C. §1691 et seq.\n   Both respondents also invoke the canon against implied\nrepeals, TVA v. Hill, 437 U. S. 153, 190 (1978), but that\ncanon has no force here. Iraq’s construction of the statute\nneither rests on implication nor effects a repeal. The\nEWSAA proviso expressly allowed the President to render\ncertain statutes inapplicable; the only question is its\nscope. And it did not repeal anything, but merely granted\nthe President authority to waive the application of par\nticular statutes to a single foreign nation. Cf. Clinton v.\nCity of New York, 524 U. S. 417, 443–445 (1998).\n                               D\n   We must consider whether anything in the subsequent\nNDAA legislation changes the above analysis. In particu\nlar, §1083(c)(4) of that statute specifically says that\n“[n]othing in section 1503 of the [EWSAA] has ever au\nthorized, directly or indirectly, the making inapplicable of\nany provision of chapter 97 of title 28, United States Code,\nor the removal of the jurisdiction of any court of the\nUnited States.” 122 Stat. 343. This looks like a ratifica\ntion by Congress of the conclusion reached in the Acree\ndecision.\n   Is such a ratification effective? The NDAA is not subse\nquent legislative history, as Iraq claims, cf. Sullivan v.\nFinkelstein, 496 U. S. 617, 632 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concur\nring in part); rather, it is binding law, approved by the\nLegislature and signed by the President. Subsequent\nlegislation can of course alter the meaning of an existing\nlaw for the future; and it can even alter the past operation\nof an existing law (constitutional objections aside) if it\nmakes that retroactive operation clear. Landgraf v. USI\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nFilm Products, 511 U. S. 244, 267–268 (1994). To tell the\ntruth, however, we are unaware of any case dealing with\nthe retroactive amendment of a law that had already\nexpired, as the EWSAA had here. And it is doubtful\nwhether Congress can retroactively claw back power it has\ngiven to the Executive, invalidating Presidential action\nthat was valid when it was taken. Thankfully, however,\nwe need not explore these difficulties here.\n  In §1083(d)(1) of the NDAA, the President was given\nauthority to “waive any provision of this section with\nrespect to Iraq.” 122 Stat. 343. The President proceeded\nto waive “all” provisions of that section as to Iraq, includ\ning (presumably) §1083(c)(4). 73 Fed. Reg. 6571. The Act\ncan therefore add nothing to our analysis of the EWSAA.\nRespondent Beaty objects that the President cannot waive\na fact. But neither can Congress legislate a fact. Section\n1083(c)(4) could change our interpretation of the disputed\nEWSAA language only if it has some substantive effect,\nchanging what would otherwise be the law. And if the\nPresident’s waiver does anything, it eliminates any sub\nstantive effect that the NDAA would otherwise have on\ncases to which Iraq is a party.2\n                           IV\n  Having concluded that the President did render 28\nU. S. C. §1605(a)(7) “inapplicable with respect to Iraq,”\nand that such action was within his assigned powers, we\nconsider respondents’ argument that the inapplicability of\n——————\n  2 Respondents contend that the NDAA waiver is irrelevant because\n\nthe President’s veto of the initial version of the bill—which did not\ninclude the waiver authority—was defective. We need not inquire into\nthat point, since Congress (evidently thinking the veto effective) en\nacted a new bill that was identical in all material respects but for the\naddition of presidential waiver authority. Since that authority would\nbe nugatory, and the rest of the new law utterly redundant, if a law\nresulting from the former bill remained in effect, that law would have\nbeen effectively repealed.\n14              REPUBLIC OF IRAQ v. BEATY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe provision does not bar their claims, since they arise\nfrom Iraq’s conduct prior to the President’s waiver. Any\nother interpretation, they say, would cause the law to\noperate in a disfavored retroactive fashion.\n  This argument proceeds as follows: The FSIA exception\nbecomes “applicable” to a foreign state when that foreign\nstate is designated as a sponsor of terrorism. In parallel\nfashion, rendering the exception “inapplicable” should be\nequivalent to removing the state’s designation. And under\n§1605(a)(7), jurisdiction turned on the foreign state’s\ndesignation “at the time the act [giving rise to the claim]\noccurred.” On this reading, the President’s waiver meant\nonly that Iraq could not be sued pursuant to §1605(a)(7)\nfor any future conduct, even though it technically re\nmained designated as a state sponsor of terrorism.\n  Respondents support this interpretation with a policy\nargument and a canon of construction. First, why would\nCongress have sought to give Iraq better treatment than\nany other state that saw the error of its ways, reformed its\nbehavior, and was accordingly removed from the list of\nterror-sponsoring regimes? See Acree, 370 F. 3d, at 56\n(calling such a result “perplexing”). Providing immunity\nfor future acts is one thing, but wiping the slate clean is\nquite another. Second, this Court has often applied a\npresumption that, absent clear indication to the contrary,\nstatutory amendments do not apply to pending cases.\nLandgraf, supra, at 280. A narrow reading of “inapplica\nble” would better comport with that presumption.\n  As a textual matter, the proffered definition of “inappli\ncable” is unpersuasive. If a provision of law is “inapplica\nble” then it cannot be applied; to “apply” a statute is “[t]o\nput [it] to use.” Webster’s New International Dictionary\n131 (2d ed. 1954). When the District Court exercised\njurisdiction over these cases against Iraq, it surely was\nputting §1605(a)(7) to use with respect to that country.\nWithout the application of that provision, there was no\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbasis for subject-matter jurisdiction. 28 U. S. C. §§1604,\n1330(a). If Congress had wanted to authorize the Presi\ndent merely to cancel Iraq’s designation as a state sponsor\nof terrorism, then Congress could have done so.\n   As a policy matter, moreover, we do not find that result\nparticularly “perplexing.” As then-Judge Roberts ex\nplained in his separate opinion in Acree, Congress in 2003\n“for the first time confronted the prospect that a friendly\nsuccessor government would, in its infancy, be vulnerable\nunder Section 1605(a)(7) to crushing liability for the ac\ntions of its renounced predecessor.” 370 F. 3d, at 61 (opin\nion concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (em\nphasis in original). The Government was at the time\nspending considerable sums of money to rebuild Iraq, see\nRogers, Congress Gives Initial Approval for War Funding,\nAirline Aid, Wall Street Journal, Apr. 4, 2003, p. A10.\nWhat would seem perplexing is converting a billion-dollar\nreconstruction project into a compensation scheme for a\nfew of Saddam’s victims.\n   As for the judicial presumption against retroactivity,\nthat does not induce us to read the EWSAA proviso more\nnarrowly. Laws that merely alter the rules of foreign\nsovereign immunity, rather than modify substantive\nrights, are not operating retroactively when applied to\npending cases. Foreign sovereign immunity “reflects\ncurrent political realities and relationships,” and its avail\nability (or lack thereof) generally is not something on\nwhich parties can rely “in shaping their primary conduct.”\nRepublic of Austria v. Altmann, 541 U. S. 677, 696 (2004);\nsee also id., at 703 (SCALIA, J., concurring).\n   In any event, the primary conduct by Iraq that forms\nthe basis for these suits actually occurred prior to the\nenactment of the FSIA terrorism exception in 1996. See\nSaudi Arabia v. Nelson, 507 U. S. 349, 351 (1993). That\nis, Iraq was immune from suit at the time it is alleged to\nhave harmed respondents. The President’s elimination of\n16                 REPUBLIC OF IRAQ v. BEATY\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nIraq’s later subjection to suit could hardly have deprived\nrespondents of any expectation they held at the time of\ntheir injury that they would be able to sue Iraq in United\nStates courts.\n                             V\n  Accordingly, the District Court lost jurisdiction over\nboth suits in May 2003, when the President exercised his\nauthority to make §1605(a)(7) inapplicable with respect to\nIraq. At that point, immunity kicked back in and the\ncases ought to have been dismissed, “the only function\nremaining to the court [being] that of announcing the fact\nand dismissing the cause.” Ex parte McCardle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88034\"><a href=\"/opinion/88034/ex-parte-mccardle/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 514 (1869).\n  In respondents’ view, that is not fatal to their claims.\nThey point to the eighth proviso in §1503 of the EWSAA:\n     “Provided further, That the authorities contained in\n     this section shall expire on September 30, 2004, or on\n     the date of enactment of a subsequent Act authorizing\n     assistance for Iraq and that specifically amends, re\n     peals or otherwise makes inapplicable the authorities\n     of this section, whichever occurs first.” 117 Stat. 579.\nThe effect of this provision, they contend, is that the\nEWSAA waiver expired in 2005,3 and that when it did so\n§1605(a)(7) was revived, immunity was again stripped,\nand jurisdiction was restored. If that is true, then at the\nvery least they ought to be permitted to refile their suits\nand claim equitable tolling for the period between 2005\nand the present, during which time they understandably\nrelied on Acree’s holding.\n  The premise, however, is flawed. It is true that the\n“authorities contained in” §1503 of the EWSAA expired,\nbut expiration of the authorities (viz., the President’s\n——————\n  3 The sunset date was extended by one year in a later bill. 108–106,\n\n§2204(2), 117 Stat. 1230.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

As Iraq points out, Congress\nhas in other statutes provided explicitly that both the\nauthorities granted and the effects of their exercise sunset\non a particular date. E.g., 19 U. S. C. §2432(c)(3) (“A\nwaiver with respect to any country shall terminate on the\nday after the waiver authority granted by this subsection\nceases to be effective with respect to such country”). The\nEWSAA contains no such language.\n   We think the better reading of the eighth EWSAA pro\nviso (the sunset clause) is that the powers granted by the\nsection could be exercised only for a limited time, but that\nactions taken by the President pursuant to those powers\n(e.g., suspension of the Iraq Sanctions Act) would not lapse\non the sunset date. If it were otherwise, then the Iraq\nSanctions Act—which has never been repealed, and which\nimposes a whole host of restrictions on relations with\nIraq—would have returned to force in September 2005.\nNobody believes that is so.\n                        *    *     *\n  When the President exercised his authority to make\ninapplicable with respect to Iraq all provisions of law that\napply to countries that have supported terrorism, the\nexception to foreign sovereign immunity for state sponsors\nof terrorism became inoperative as against Iraq. As a\nresult, the courts below lacked jurisdiction; we therefore\nneed not reach Iraq’s alternative argument that the NDAA\nsubsequently stripped jurisdiction over the cases.

Argued April 20, 2009—Decided June 8, 2009*\nThe Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA) prohibits suits\n  against other countries in American courts, 28 U. S. C. §1604, with\n  certain exceptions.     One exception, §1605(a)(7) (now repealed),\n  stripped a foreign state of immunity in any suit arising from certain\n  acts of terrorism that occurred when the state was designated as a\n  sponsor of terrorism under §6(j) of the Export Administration Act of\n  1979 or §620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.\n     Iraq was designated as a sponsor of terrorism in 1990, but in 2003,\n  following the American-led invasion of Iraq, Congress enacted the\n  Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act (EWSAA),\n  §1503 of which included a proviso clause (the second in a series of\n  eight) authorizing the President to “make inapplicable with respect to\n  Iraq [§]620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or any other provi\n  sion of law that applies to countries that have supported terrorism.”\n  Although President Bush exercised that authority, the D.

On the same day the President signed the\n    NDAA into law he also waived all of §1083’s provisions as to Iraq.\n      Respondents filed these suits against Iraq in early 2003, alleging\n    mistreatment by Iraqi officials during and after the 1991 Gulf War.\n    Under Acree, the courts below refused to dismiss either case on juris\n    dictional grounds. The D. C. Circuit also rejected Iraq’s alternative\n    argument that even if §1605(a)(7)’s application to it survived the\n    President’s EWSAA waiver, the provision was repealed by NDAA\n    §1083(b)(1)(A)(iii); and that the President had waived NDAA\n    §1083(a)’s new exception with respect to Iraq under his §1083(d) au\n    thority. The court held instead that it retained jurisdiction over\n    cases pending against Iraq when the NDAA was enacted.\nHeld: Iraq is no longer subject to suit in federal court. Pp. 6–17.\n    (a) The District Court lost jurisdiction over both suits in May 2003,\n when the President exercised his EWSAA authority to make\n §1605(a)(7) “inapplicable with respect to Iraq.” Pp. 6–13.\n       (i) Iraq’s (and the United States’) reading of EWSAA §1503’s sec\n ond proviso as sweeping in §1605(a)(7)’s terrorism exception to for\n eign sovereign immunity is straightforward. In the proviso’s terms,\n the exception is a “provision of law” (indisputably) that “applies to”\n (strips immunity from) “countries that have supported terrorism” (as\n designated pursuant to certain statutory provisions). Because he ex\n ercised his waiver authority with respect to “all” provisions of law en\n compassed by the second proviso, his actions made §1605(a)(7) “inap\n plicable” to Iraq. Pp. 6–7.\n       (ii) Acree’s resistance to the above construction was based on a\n sophisticated attempt to construe EWSAA §1503’s second proviso as\n limiting that section’s principal clause, which authorized suspension\n of “any provision of the Iraq Sanctions Act of 1990.” While a proviso’s\n “general office . . . is to except something from the enacting clause, or\n to qualify and restrain its generality,” United States v.

S. 531, 534, another recognized use is “to introduce independent\n legislation,” id., at 535, which was the function of the proviso here.\n In any event, §1605(a)(7) falls within the scope of the proviso even\n accepting the narrower interpretation adopted by the Acree decision.\n Pp. 7–11.\n       (iii) Respondents’ other objections to the straightforward inter\n pretation of EWSAA §1503’s proviso are rejected. Pp. 11–12.\n       (iv) Nothing in the NDAA changes the above analysis. Although\n NDAA §1083(c)(4) appears to ratify Acree, this Court need not decide\n whether such a ratification is effective because §1083(d)(1) author\n ized the President to “waive any provision of this section with respect\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  to Iraq,” and he waived “all” such provisions, including §1083(c)(4).\n  Pp. 12–13.\n     (b) The Court rejects the argument that §1605(a)(7)’s inapplicabil\n  ity does not bar claims arising from Iraq’s conduct prior to the Presi\n  dent’s waiver. In order to exercise jurisdiction over these cases, the\n  District Court had to “apply” §1605(a)(7) with respect to Iraq, but the\n  President’s waiver made that provision “inapplicable.” No retroactiv\n  ity problem is posed by this construction, if only because the primary\n  conduct by Iraq that forms the basis for these suits actually occurred\n  before §1605(a)(7)’s enactment. Pp. 13–16.\n     (c) Respondents also argue that EWSAA §1503’s sunset clause—\n  under which “the authorities contained in [that] section” expired in\n  2005—revived §1605(a)(7) and restored jurisdiction as of the sunset\n  date. But expiration of the §1503 authorities is not the same as can\n  cellation of the effect of the prior valid exercise of those authorities.\n  Pp. 16–17.\nNo. 07–1090, and No. 08–539, 529 F. 3d 1187, reversed.\n\n  SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n                        Cite as: 556 U.

C. §1605(a)(7).\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  Under the venerable principle of foreign sovereign im\nmunity, foreign states are ordinarily “immune from the\njurisdiction of the courts of the United States and of the\nStates,” §1604. See generally Schooner Exchange v.\nMcFaddon, 7 Cranch 116 (1812). But the statute embody\ning that principle—the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act\nof 1976 (FSIA), 28 U. S. C. §1602 et seq.—recognizes a\nnumber of exceptions; if any of these is applicable, the\nstate is subject to suit, and federal district courts have\n2                REPUBLIC OF IRAQ v.

S. 480, 489 (1983).\n   In 1996, Congress added to the list of statutory excep\ntions one for state sponsors of terrorism, which was codi\nfied at 28 U. S. C. §1605(a)(7). Subject to limitations not\nrelevant here, that exception stripped immunity in any\nsuit for money damages\n    “against a foreign state for personal injury or death\n    that was caused by an act of torture, extrajudicial kill\n    ing, aircraft sabotage, hostage taking, or the provision\n    of material support or resources . . . for such an act . . .\n    except that the court shall decline to hear a claim un\n    der this paragraph—\n      “(A) if the foreign state was not designated as a\n    state sponsor of terrorism under section 6(j) of the Ex\n    port Administration Act of 1979 (50 U. S. C. App.\n    2405(j)) or section 620A of the Foreign Assistance\n    Act of 1961 (22 U. S. C. 2371) at the time the act\n    occurred . . . .”\nIn brief, §1605(a)(7) stripped immunity from a foreign\nstate for claims arising from particular acts, if those acts\nwere taken at a time when the state was designated as a\nsponsor of terrorism.\n                              B\n  In September 1990, Acting Secretary of State Lawrence\nEagleburger formally designated Iraq, pursuant to §6(j) of\nthe Export Administration Act of 1979, as redesignated\nand amended, 99 Stat. 135, 50 U. S. C. App. §2405(j), as “a\ncountry which has repeatedly provided support for acts of\ninternational terrorism,” 55 Fed. Reg. 37793. Over a\ndecade later, in March 2003, the United States and a\ncoalition of allies initiated military action against that\ncountry. In a matter of weeks, the regime of Iraqi dictator\nSaddam Hussein collapsed and coalition forces occupied\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nBaghdad. American attention soon shifted from combat\noperations to the longer term project of rebuilding Iraq,\nwith the ultimate goal of creating a stable ally in the\nregion.\n  Toward that end, Congress enacted in April 2003 the\nEmergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act\n(EWSAA), 117 Stat. 559. Section 1503 of that Act author\nized the President to “make inapplicable with respect to\nIraq section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or\nany other provision of law that applies to countries that\nhave supported terrorism.” Id., at 579. President George\nW. Bush exercised that authority to its fullest extent in\nMay 2003, declaring “inapplicable with respect to Iraq\nsection 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 . . . and\nany other provision of law that applies to countries that\nhave supported terrorism.” 68 Fed. Reg. 26459.\n  Shortly thereafter, the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the District of Columbia Circuit had occasion to con\nsider whether that Presidential action had the effect of\nrendering inapplicable to Iraq the terrorism exception to\nforeign sovereign immunity. The Court concluded in a\ndivided panel decision that the President’s EWSAA au\nthority did not permit him to waive §1605(a)(7), and\nthereby restore sovereign immunity to Iraq, for claims\narising from acts it had taken while designated as a spon\nsor of terror. Acree v. Republic of Iraq, 370 F. 3d 41, 48\n(2004). Because Iraq succeeded in having the claims\nagainst it dismissed on other grounds, id., at 59–60, it\ncould not seek certiorari to challenge the D. C. Circuit’s\ninterpretation of the EWSAA.\n                           C\n  There is yet another legislative enactment, and yet\nanother corresponding executive waiver, that bear on the\nquestion presented. The National Defense Authorization\nAct for Fiscal Year 2008 (NDAA), 122 Stat. 3, was passed\n4               REPUBLIC OF IRAQ v. BEATY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin January 2008. That Act (1) repealed the FSIA’s terror\nism exception, §1083(b)(1)(A)(iii); (2) replaced it with a\nnew, roughly similar exception, §1083(a); (3) declared that\nnothing in §1503 of the EWSAA had “ever authorized,\ndirectly or indirectly, the making inapplicable of any\nprovision of chapter 97 of title 28, United States Code, or\nthe removal of the jurisdiction of any court of the United\nStates” (thus purporting to ratify the Court of Appeals’\nAcree decision), §1083(c)(4), 122 Stat. 343; and (4) author\nized the President to waive “any provision of this section\nwith respect to Iraq” so long as he made certain findings\nand so notified Congress within 30 days, §1083(d), id., at\n343–344.\n  The last provision was added to the NDAA after the\nPresident vetoed an earlier version of the bill, which did\nnot include the waiver authority. The President’s veto\nmessage said that the bill “would imperil billions of dollars\nof Iraqi assets at a crucial juncture in that nation’s recon\nstruction efforts.” Memorandum to the House of Repre\nsentatives Returning Without Approval the “National\nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008,” 43\nWeekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 1641 (2007). Only when Con\ngress added the waiver authority to the NDAA did the\nPresident agree to approve it; and on the same day he\nsigned it into law he also officially waived “all provisions\nof section 1083 of the Act with respect to Iraq,” 73 Fed.\nReg. 6571 (2008).\n                             II\n  We consider today two cases that have been navigating\ntheir way through the lower courts against the backdrop of\nthe above-described congressional, military, Presidential,\nand judicial actions. Respondents in the Simon case are\nAmerican nationals (and relatives of those nationals) who\nallege that they were captured and cruelly mistreated by\nIraqi officials during the 1991 Gulf War. The Beaty re\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nspondents are the children of two other Americans, Ken\nneth Beaty and William Barloon, who are alleged to have\nbeen similarly abused by the regime of Saddam Hussein in\nthe aftermath of that war. Each set of respondents filed\nsuit in early 2003 against Iraq in the United States Dis\ntrict Court for the District of Columbia, alleging violations\nof local, federal, and international law.\n   Respondents invoked the terrorism exception to foreign\nsovereign immunity, and given Acree’s holding that the\nPresident had not rendered that statutory provision inap\nplicable to Iraq, the District Court refused to dismiss\neither case on jurisdictional grounds. In Beaty, after the\nDistrict Court denied Iraq’s motion to dismiss, 480\nF. Supp. 2d 60, 70 (2007), Iraq invoked the collateral order\ndoctrine to support an interlocutory appeal. See Mitchell\nv. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 524–529 (1985). In Simon, the\nDistrict Court determined that the claims were time\nbarred and dismissed on that alternative basis, Vine v.\nRepublic of Iraq, 459 F. Supp. 2d 10, 25 (2006), after\nwhich the Simon respondents appealed.\n   In the Beaty appeal, Iraq (supported by the United\nStates as amicus) requested that the Court of Appeals for\nthe District of Columbia Circuit reconsider Acree’s holding\nen banc. The Court denied that request over the dissent of\nJudges Brown and Kavanaugh, and a panel then summa\nrily affirmed in an unpublished order the District Court’s\ndenial of Iraq’s motion to dismiss. No. 07–7057 (Nov. 21,\n2007) (per curiam), App. to Pet. for Cert. 1a–2a.\n   While the Simon appeal was still pending, Congress\nenacted the NDAA, and the Court of Appeals requested\nsupplemental briefing addressing the impact of that legis\nlation on the court’s jurisdiction. Iraq contended, as an\nalternative argument to its position that Acree was\nwrongly decided, that even if 28 U. S. C. §1605(a)(7)’s\napplication to Iraq survived the President’s EWSAA\nwaiver, the provision was repealed by §1083(b)(1)(A)(iii) of\n6               REPUBLIC OF IRAQ v. BEATY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe NDAA, 122 Stat. 341; and that the new terrorism\nexception to sovereign immunity—which was created by\nthe NDAA and codified at 28 U. S. C. A. §1605A (July\n2008 Supp.)—was waived by the President with respect to\nIraq pursuant to his NDAA authority.\n  The Court of Appeals rejected that argument, holding\ninstead, based on a close reading of the statutory text, that\n“the NDAA leaves intact our jurisdiction over cases . . .\nthat were pending against Iraq when the Congress en\nacted the NDAA.” 529 F. 3d 1187, 1194 (2008). The panel\nthen reversed the District Court’s determination that the\nSimon respondents’ claims were untimely, id., at 1195–\n1196, and rebuffed Iraq’s request for dismissal under the\npolitical question doctrine, id., at 1196–1198.\n  Iraq sought this Court’s review of both cases, asking us\nto determine whether under current law it remains sub\nject to suit in the federal courts. We granted certiorari,\n555 U. S. ___ (2009), and consolidated the cases.\n                            III \n\n                             A\n\n  Section 1503 of the EWSAA consists of a principal\nclause, followed by eight separate proviso clauses. The\ndispute in these cases concerns the second of the provisos.\nThe principal clause and that proviso read:\n    “The President may suspend the application of any\n    provision of the Iraq Sanctions Act of 1990: . . . Pro\n    vided further, That the President may make inappli\n    cable with respect to Iraq section 620A of the Foreign\n    Assistance Act of 1961 or any other provision of law\n    that applies to countries that have supported terror\n    ism . . . .” 117 Stat. 579.\nIraq and the United States both read the quoted proviso’s\nresidual clause as sweeping in the terrorism exception to\nforeign sovereign immunity. Certainly that reading is, as\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\neven the Acree Court acknowledged, “straightforward.”\n370 F. 3d, at 52.\n   Title 28 U. S. C. §1605(a)(7)’s exception to sovereign\nimmunity for state sponsors of terrorism stripped jurisdic\ntional immunity from a country unless “the foreign state\nwas not designated as a state sponsor of terrorism.” This\nis a “provision of law” (indisputably) that “applies to”\n(strips immunity from) “countries that have supported\nterrorism” (as designated pursuant to certain statutory\nprovisions). Of course the word “any” (in the phrase “any\nother provision of law”) has an “expansive meaning,”\nUnited States v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, 5 (1997), giving us\nno warrant to limit the class of provisions of law that the\nPresident may waive. Because the President exercised his\nauthority with respect to “all” provisions of law encom\npassed by the second proviso, his actions made §1605(a)(7)\n“inapplicable” to Iraq.\n   To a layperson, the notion of the President’s suspending\nthe operation of a valid law might seem strange. But the\npractice is well established, at least in the sphere of for\neign affairs. See United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export\nCorp., 299 U. S. 304, 322–324 (1936) (canvassing prece\ndents from as early as the “inception of the national gov\nernment”). The granting of Presidential waiver authority\nis particularly apt with respect to congressional elimina\ntion of foreign sovereign immunity, since the granting or\ndenial of that immunity was historically the case-by-case\nprerogative of the Executive Branch. See, e.g., Ex parte\nPeru, 318 U. S. 578, 586–590 (1943). It is entirely unre\nmarkable that Congress, having taken upon itself in the\nFSIA to “free the Government” from the diplomatic pres\nsures engendered by the case-by-case approach, Verlinden,\n461 U. S., at 488, would nonetheless think it prudent to\nafford the President some flexibility in unique circum\nstances such as these.\n8               REPUBLIC OF IRAQ v. BEATY \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              B\n\n   The Court of Appeals in Acree resisted the above con\nstruction, primarily on the ground that the relevant text is\nfound in a proviso. We have said that, at least presump\ntively, the “grammatical and logical scope [of a proviso] is\nconfined to the subject-matter of the principal clause.”\nUnited States v. Morrow, 266 U. S. 531, 534–535 (1925).\nUsing that proposition as a guide, the Acree panel strove\nmightily to construe the proviso as somehow restricting\nthe principal clause of EWSAA §1503, which authorized\nthe President to suspend “any provision of the Iraq Sanc\ntions Act of 1990,” 117 Stat. 579.\n   In the Court of Appeals’ view, the second proviso related\nto that subsection of the Iraq Sanctions Act (referred to in\nthe principal provision) which dictated that certain enu\nmerated statutory provisions, including §620A of the\nForeign Assistance Act of 1961 and “all other provisions of\nlaw that impose sanctions against a country which has\nrepeatedly provided support for acts of international ter\nrorism,” shall be fully enforced against Iraq. §586F(c), 104\nStat. 2051 (emphasis added). The panel understood the\nsecond EWSAA proviso as doing nothing more than clari\nfying that the authority granted by the principal clause (to\nsuspend any part of the Iraq Sanctions Act) included the\npower to make inapplicable to Iraq the various independ\nent provisions of law that §586F(c) of the Iraq Sanctions\nAct instructed to be enforced against Iraq—which might\notherwise continue to apply of their own force even with\nout the Iraq Sanctions Act. However, the residual clause\nof §586F(c) encompasses only provisions that “impose\nsanctions”; and, in the Court of Appeals’ view, that ex\ncludes §1605(a)(7), which is a rule going instead to the\njurisdiction of the federal courts. Thus, the EWSAA pro\nviso swept only as broadly as §586F(c), and therefore did\nnot permit the President to waive the FSIA terrorism\nexception.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   This is a highly sophisticated effort to construe the\nproviso as a limitation upon the principal clause. Ulti\nmately, however, we think that effort neither necessary\nnor successful. It is true that the “general office of a pro\nviso is to except something from the enacting clause, or to\nqualify and restrain its generality.” Morrow, supra, at\n534. But its general (and perhaps appropriate) office is\nnot, alas, its exclusive use. Use of a proviso “to state a\ngeneral, independent rule,” Alaska v. United States, 545\nU. S. 75, 106 (2005), may be lazy drafting, but is hardly a\nnovelty. See, e.g., McDonald v. United States, 279 U. S.\n12, 21 (1929). Morrow itself came with the caveat that a\nproviso is sometimes used “to introduce independent\nlegislation.” 266 U. S., at 535. We think that was its\noffice here. The principal clause granted the President a\npower; the second proviso purported to grant him an\nadditional power. It was not, on any fair reading, an\nexception to, qualification of, or restraint on the principal\npower.\n   Contrasting the second EWSAA proviso to some of the\nother provisos illustrates the point. For example, the first\nproviso cautioned that “nothing in this section shall affect\nthe applicability of the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation\nAct of 1992,” 117 Stat. 579, and the third forbade the\nexport of certain military equipment “under the authority\nof this section.” Ibid. Both of these plainly sought to\ndefine and limit the authority granted by the principal\nclause. The fourth proviso, however, mandated that “sec\ntion 307 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 shall not\napply with respect to programs of international organiza\ntions for Iraq,” ibid., and it is impossible to see how that\nself-executing suspension of a distinct statute in any way\ncabined or clarified the principal clause’s authorization to\nsuspend the Iraq Sanctions Act.\n   There are other indications that the second proviso’s\nwaiver authority was not limited to the statutory provi\n10              REPUBLIC OF IRAQ v. BEATY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsions embraced by §586F(c) of the Iraq Sanctions Act. If\nthat is all it was meant to accomplish, why would Con\ngress not simply have tracked §586F(c)’s residual clause?\nInstead of restricting the President’s authority to statutes\nthat “impose sanctions” on sponsors of terror, the EWSAA\nextended it to any statute that “applies” to such states.\nThat is undoubtedly a broader class.\n   Even if the best reading of the EWSAA proviso were\nthat it encompassed only statutes that impose sanctions or\nprohibit assistance to state sponsors of terrorism, see\nAcree, 370 F. 3d, at 54, we would disagree with the Court\nof Appeals’ conclusion that the FSIA exception is not such\na law. Allowing lawsuits to proceed certainly has the\nextra benefit of facilitating the compensation of injured\nvictims, but the fact that §1605(a)(7) targeted only foreign\nstates designated as sponsors of terrorism suggests that\nthe law was intended as a sanction, to punish and deter\nundesirable conduct. Stripping the immunity that foreign\nsovereigns ordinarily enjoy is as much a sanction as elimi\nnating bilateral assistance or prohibiting export of muni\ntions (both of which are explicitly mandated by §586F(c) of\nthe Iraq Sanctions Act). The application of this sanction\naffects the jurisdiction of the federal courts, but that fact\nalone does not deprive it of its character as a sanction.\n   It may well be that when Congress enacted the EWSAA\nit did not have specifically in mind the terrorism exception\nto sovereign immunity. The Court of Appeals evidently\nfound that to be of some importance. Id., at 56 (noting\nthere is “no reference in the legislative history to the\nFSIA”). But the whole value of a generally phrased resid\nual clause, like the one used in the second proviso, is that\nit serves as a catchall for matters not specifically contem\nplated—known unknowns, in the happy phrase coined by\nSecretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.

Certainly the exposure of Iraq to\nbillions of dollars in damages could be thought to jeopard\nize the statute’s goal of speedy reconstruction of that\ncountry. At least the President thought so. And in the\n“vast external realm, with its important, complicated,\ndelicate and manifold problems,” Curtiss-Wright Export\nCorp., 299 U. S., at 319, courts ought to be especially wary\nof overriding apparent statutory text supported by execu\ntive interpretation in favor of speculation about a law’s\ntrue purpose.1\n                              C\n  Respondents advance two other objections to the\nstraightforward interpretation of the EWSAA proviso.\nFirst, in a less compelling variant of the D. C. Circuit’s\napproach, the Simon respondents argue that “section 620A\nof the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or any other provi\nsion of law that applies to countries that have supported\nterrorism” means section 620A of the Foreign Assistance\nAct or any other provision of law cited therein. The provi\nsion would thus allow the President to make inapplicable\nto Iraq the statutes that §620A precludes from being used\nto provide support to terror-sponsoring nations. Not to\nput too fine a point upon it, that is an absurd reading, not\n\n——————\n   1 The eighth proviso of EWSAA §1503 says that absent further con\n\ngressional action, “the authorities contained in this section shall expire\non September 30, 2004.” 117 Stat. 579.

BEATY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nonly textually but in the result it produces: It would mean\nthat the effect of the EWSAA was to permit the President\nto exclude Iraq from, rather than include it within, such\nbeneficent legislation as the Food for Peace Act of 1966, 7\nU. S. C. §1691 et seq.\n   Both respondents also invoke the canon against implied\nrepeals, TVA v. Hill, 437 U. S. 153, 190 (1978), but that\ncanon has no force here. Iraq’s construction of the statute\nneither rests on implication nor effects a repeal. The\nEWSAA proviso expressly allowed the President to render\ncertain statutes inapplicable; the only question is its\nscope. And it did not repeal anything, but merely granted\nthe President authority to waive the application of par\nticular statutes to a single foreign nation. Cf. Clinton v.\nCity of New York, 524 U. S. 417, 443–445 (1998).\n                               D\n   We must consider whether anything in the subsequent\nNDAA legislation changes the above analysis. In particu\nlar, §1083(c)(4) of that statute specifically says that\n“[n]othing in section 1503 of the [EWSAA] has ever au\nthorized, directly or indirectly, the making inapplicable of\nany provision of chapter 97 of title 28, United States Code,\nor the removal of the jurisdiction of any court of the\nUnited States.” 122 Stat. 343. This looks like a ratifica\ntion by Congress of the conclusion reached in the Acree\ndecision.\n   Is such a ratification effective? The NDAA is not subse\nquent legislative history, as Iraq claims, cf. Sullivan v.\nFinkelstein, 496 U. S. 617, 632 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concur\nring in part); rather, it is binding law, approved by the\nLegislature and signed by the President. Subsequent\nlegislation can of course alter the meaning of an existing\nlaw for the future; and it can even alter the past operation\nof an existing law (constitutional objections aside) if it\nmakes that retroactive operation clear. Landgraf v. USI\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nFilm Products, 511 U. S. 244, 267–268 (1994). To tell the\ntruth, however, we are unaware of any case dealing with\nthe retroactive amendment of a law that had already\nexpired, as the EWSAA had here. And it is doubtful\nwhether Congress can retroactively claw back power it has\ngiven to the Executive, invalidating Presidential action\nthat was valid when it was taken. Thankfully, however,\nwe need not explore these difficulties here.\n  In §1083(d)(1) of the NDAA, the President was given\nauthority to “waive any provision of this section with\nrespect to Iraq.” 122 Stat. 343. The President proceeded\nto waive “all” provisions of that section as to Iraq, includ\ning (presumably) §1083(c)(4). 73 Fed. Reg. 6571. The Act\ncan therefore add nothing to our analysis of the EWSAA.\nRespondent Beaty objects that the President cannot waive\na fact. But neither can Congress legislate a fact. Section\n1083(c)(4) could change our interpretation of the disputed\nEWSAA language only if it has some substantive effect,\nchanging what would otherwise be the law. And if the\nPresident’s waiver does anything, it eliminates any sub\nstantive effect that the NDAA would otherwise have on\ncases to which Iraq is a party.2\n                           IV\n  Having concluded that the President did render 28\nU. S. C. §1605(a)(7) “inapplicable with respect to Iraq,”\nand that such action was within his assigned powers, we\nconsider respondents’ argument that the inapplicability of\n——————\n  2 Respondents contend that the NDAA waiver is irrelevant because\n\nthe President’s veto of the initial version of the bill—which did not\ninclude the waiver authority—was defective. We need not inquire into\nthat point, since Congress (evidently thinking the veto effective) en\nacted a new bill that was identical in all material respects but for the\naddition of presidential waiver authority. Since that authority would\nbe nugatory, and the rest of the new law utterly redundant, if a law\nresulting from the former bill remained in effect, that law would have\nbeen effectively repealed.\n14              REPUBLIC OF IRAQ v. BEATY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe provision does not bar their claims, since they arise\nfrom Iraq’s conduct prior to the President’s waiver. Any\nother interpretation, they say, would cause the law to\noperate in a disfavored retroactive fashion.\n  This argument proceeds as follows: The FSIA exception\nbecomes “applicable” to a foreign state when that foreign\nstate is designated as a sponsor of terrorism. In parallel\nfashion, rendering the exception “inapplicable” should be\nequivalent to removing the state’s designation. And under\n§1605(a)(7), jurisdiction turned on the foreign state’s\ndesignation “at the time the act [giving rise to the claim]\noccurred.” On this reading, the President’s waiver meant\nonly that Iraq could not be sued pursuant to §1605(a)(7)\nfor any future conduct, even though it technically re\nmained designated as a state sponsor of terrorism.\n  Respondents support this interpretation with a policy\nargument and a canon of construction. First, why would\nCongress have sought to give Iraq better treatment than\nany other state that saw the error of its ways, reformed its\nbehavior, and was accordingly removed from the list of\nterror-sponsoring regimes? See Acree, 370 F. 3d, at 56\n(calling such a result “perplexing”). Providing immunity\nfor future acts is one thing, but wiping the slate clean is\nquite another. Second, this Court has often applied a\npresumption that, absent clear indication to the contrary,\nstatutory amendments do not apply to pending cases.\nLandgraf, supra, at 280. A narrow reading of “inapplica\nble” would better comport with that presumption.\n  As a textual matter, the proffered definition of “inappli\ncable” is unpersuasive. If a provision of law is “inapplica\nble” then it cannot be applied; to “apply” a statute is “[t]o\nput [it] to use.” Webster’s New International Dictionary\n131 (2d ed. 1954). When the District Court exercised\njurisdiction over these cases against Iraq, it surely was\nputting §1605(a)(7) to use with respect to that country.\nWithout the application of that provision, there was no\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbasis for subject-matter jurisdiction. 28 U. S. C. §§1604,\n1330(a). If Congress had wanted to authorize the Presi\ndent merely to cancel Iraq’s designation as a state sponsor\nof terrorism, then Congress could have done so.\n   As a policy matter, moreover, we do not find that result\nparticularly “perplexing.” As then-Judge Roberts ex\nplained in his separate opinion in Acree, Congress in 2003\n“for the first time confronted the prospect that a friendly\nsuccessor government would, in its infancy, be vulnerable\nunder Section 1605(a)(7) to crushing liability for the ac\ntions of its renounced predecessor.” 370 F. 3d, at 61 (opin\nion concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (em\nphasis in original). The Government was at the time\nspending considerable sums of money to rebuild Iraq, see\nRogers, Congress Gives Initial Approval for War Funding,\nAirline Aid, Wall Street Journal, Apr. 4, 2003, p. A10.\nWhat would seem perplexing is converting a billion-dollar\nreconstruction project into a compensation scheme for a\nfew of Saddam’s victims.\n   As for the judicial presumption against retroactivity,\nthat does not induce us to read the EWSAA proviso more\nnarrowly. Laws that merely alter the rules of foreign\nsovereign immunity, rather than modify substantive\nrights, are not operating retroactively when applied to\npending cases. Foreign sovereign immunity “reflects\ncurrent political realities and relationships,” and its avail\nability (or lack thereof) generally is not something on\nwhich parties can rely “in shaping their primary conduct.”\nRepublic of Austria v. Altmann, 541 U. S. 677, 696 (2004);\nsee also id., at 703 (SCALIA, J., concurring).\n   In any event, the primary conduct by Iraq that forms\nthe basis for these suits actually occurred prior to the\nenactment of the FSIA terrorism exception in 1996. See\nSaudi Arabia v. Nelson, 507 U. S. 349, 351 (1993). That\nis, Iraq was immune from suit at the time it is alleged to\nhave harmed respondents. The President’s elimination of\n16                 REPUBLIC OF IRAQ v. BEATY\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nIraq’s later subjection to suit could hardly have deprived\nrespondents of any expectation they held at the time of\ntheir injury that they would be able to sue Iraq in United\nStates courts.\n                             V\n  Accordingly, the District Court lost jurisdiction over\nboth suits in May 2003, when the President exercised his\nauthority to make §1605(a)(7) inapplicable with respect to\nIraq. At that point, immunity kicked back in and the\ncases ought to have been dismissed, “the only function\nremaining to the court [being] that of announcing the fact\nand dismissing the cause.” Ex parte McCardle, 7 Wall.\n506, 514 (1869).\n  In respondents’ view, that is not fatal to their claims.\nThey point to the eighth proviso in §1503 of the EWSAA:\n     “Provided further, That the authorities contained in\n     this section shall expire on September 30, 2004, or on\n     the date of enactment of a subsequent Act authorizing\n     assistance for Iraq and that specifically amends, re\n     peals or otherwise makes inapplicable the authorities\n     of this section, whichever occurs first.” 117 Stat. 579.\nThe effect of this provision, they contend, is that the\nEWSAA waiver expired in 2005,3 and that when it did so\n§1605(a)(7) was revived, immunity was again stripped,\nand jurisdiction was restored. If that is true, then at the\nvery least they ought to be permitted to refile their suits\nand claim equitable tolling for the period between 2005\nand the present, during which time they understandably\nrelied on Acree’s holding.\n  The premise, however, is flawed. It is true that the\n“authorities contained in” §1503 of the EWSAA expired,\nbut expiration of the authorities (viz., the President’s\n——————\n  3 The sunset date was extended by one year in a later bill. 108–106,\n\n§2204(2), 117 Stat. 1230.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                 17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npowers to suspend and make inapplicable certain laws) is\nnot the same as cancellation of the effect of the President’s\nprior valid exercise of those authorities (viz., the restora\ntion of sovereign immunity). As Iraq points out, Congress\nhas in other statutes provided explicitly that both the\nauthorities granted and the effects of their exercise sunset\non a particular date. E.g., 19 U. S. C. §2432(c)(3) (“A\nwaiver with respect to any country shall terminate on the\nday after the waiver authority granted by this subsection\nceases to be effective with respect to such country”). The\nEWSAA contains no such language.\n   We think the better reading of the eighth EWSAA pro\nviso (the sunset clause) is that the powers granted by the\nsection could be exercised only for a limited time, but that\nactions taken by the President pursuant to those powers\n(e.g., suspension of the Iraq Sanctions Act) would not lapse\non the sunset date. If it were otherwise, then the Iraq\nSanctions Act—which has never been repealed, and which\nimposes a whole host of restrictions on relations with\nIraq—would have returned to force in September 2005.\nNobody believes that is so.\n                        *    *     *\n  When the President exercised his authority to make\ninapplicable with respect to Iraq all provisions of law that\napply to countries that have supported terrorism, the\nexception to foreign sovereign immunity for state sponsors\nof terrorism became inoperative as against Iraq. As a\nresult, the courts below lacked jurisdiction; we therefore\nneed not reach Iraq’s alternative argument that the NDAA\nsubsequently stripped jurisdiction over the cases. The\njudgments of the Court of Appeals are reversed.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145868/", "sha1": "9cbc704b282024d331385e56209a084106a24e37", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-063", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:08:45"}
