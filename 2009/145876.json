UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 08–108.      Argued February 25, 2009—Decided May 4, 2009\nA federal statute forbidding “[a]ggravated identity theft” imposes a\n mandatory consecutive 2-year prison term on an individual convicted\n of certain predicate crimes if, during (or in relation to) the commis\n sion of those other crimes, the offender “knowingly . . . uses, without\n lawful authority, a means of identification of another person.” 18\n U. S. C. §1028A(a)(1) (emphasis added). After petitioner Flores-\n Figueroa, a Mexican citizen, gave his employer counterfeit Social Se\n curity and alien registration cards containing his name but other\n people’s identification numbers, he was arrested and charged with\n two immigration offenses and aggravated identity theft. Flores\n moved for acquittal on the latter charge, claiming that the Govern\n ment could not prove that he knew that the documents’ numbers\n were assigned to other people. The District Court agreed with the\n Government that the word “knowingly” in §1028A(a)(1) does not mod\n ify the statute’s last three words, “of another person,” and, after trial,\n found Flores guilty on all counts. The Eighth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Section §1028(a)(1) requires the Government to show that the\n defendant knew that the means of identification at issue belonged to\n another person. As a matter of ordinary English grammar, “know\n ingly” is naturally read as applying to all the subsequently listed\n elements of the crime. Where a transitive verb has an object, listen\n ers in most contexts assume that an adverb (such as “knowingly”)\n that modifies the verb tells the listener how the subject performed\n the entire action, including the object. The Government does not\n provide a single example of a sentence that, when used in typical\n fashion, would lead the hearer to a contrary understanding. And\n courts ordinarily interpret criminal statutes consistently with the or\n dinary English usage. See, e.g., Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S.\n2               FLORES-FIGUEROA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    419. The Government argues that this position is incorrect because it\n    would either require the same language to be interpreted differently\n    in a neighboring provision or would render the language in that pro\n    vision superfluous. This argument fails for two reasons. Finally, the\n    Government’s arguments based on the statute’s purpose and on the\n    practical problems of enforcing it are not sufficient to overcome the\n    ordinary meaning, in English or through ordinary interpretive prac\n    tice, of Congress’ words.

S. C. §1028A(a)(1) (emphasis\nadded). The question is whether the statute requires the\nGovernment to show that the defendant knew that the\n“means of identification” he or she unlawfully transferred,\npossessed, or used, in fact, belonged to “another person.”\nWe conclude that it does.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n  The statutory provision in question references a set of\npredicate crimes, including, for example, theft of govern\nment property, fraud, or engaging in various unlawful\nactivities related to passports, visas, and immigration.\n§1028A(c). It then provides that if any person who com\nmits any of those other crimes (in doing so) “knowingly\n2           FLORES-FIGUEROA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntransfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a\nmeans of identification of another person,” the judge must\nadd two years’ imprisonment to the offender’s underlying\nsentence. §1028A(a)(1). All parties agree that the provi\nsion applies only where the offender knows that he is\ntransferring, possessing, or using something. And the\nGovernment reluctantly concedes that the offender likely\nmust know that he is transferring, possessing, or using\nthat something without lawful authority. But they do not\nagree whether the provision requires that a defendant also\nknow that the something he has unlawfully transferred is,\nfor example, a real ID belonging to another person rather\nthan, say, a fake ID (i.e., a group of numbers that does not\ncorrespond to any real Social Security number).\n  Petitioner Ignacio Flores-Figueroa argues that the\nstatute requires that the Government prove that he knew\nthat the “means of identification” belonged to someone\nelse, i.e., was “a means of identification of another person.”\nThe Government argues that the statute does not impose\nthis particular knowledge requirement. The Government\nconcedes that the statute uses the word “knowingly,” but\nthat word, the Government claims, does not modify the\nstatute’s last phrase (“a means of identification of another\nperson”) or, at the least, it does not modify the last three\nwords of that phrase (“of another person”).\n                              B\n  The facts of this case illustrate the legal problem. Igna\ncio Flores-Figueroa is a citizen of Mexico. In 2000, to\nsecure employment, Flores gave his employer a false\nname, birth date, and Social Security number, along with\na counterfeit alien registration card. The Social Security\nnumber and the number on the alien registration card\nwere not those of a real person. In 2006, Flores presented\nhis employer with new counterfeit Social Security and\nalien registration cards; these cards (unlike Flores’ old\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nalien registration card) used his real name. But this time\nthe numbers on both cards were in fact numbers assigned\nto other people.\n   Flores’ employer reported his request to U. S. Immigra\ntion and Customs Enforcement. Customs discovered that\nthe numbers on Flores’ new documents belonged to other\npeople. The United States then charged Flores with two\npredicate crimes, namely, entering the United States\nwithout inspection, 8 U. S. C. §1325(a), and misusing\nimmigration documents, 18 U. S. C. §1546(a). And it\ncharged him with aggravated identity theft, 18 U. S. C.\n§1028A(a)(1), the crime at issue here.\n   Flores moved for a judgment of acquittal on the “aggra\nvated identity theft” counts. He claimed that the Govern\nment could not prove that he knew that the numbers on\nthe counterfeit documents were numbers assigned to other\npeople. The Government replied that it need not prove\nthat knowledge, and the District Court accepted the Gov\nernment’s argument. After a bench trial, the court found\nFlores guilty of the predicate crimes and aggravated iden\ntity theft. The Court of Appeals upheld the District\nCourt’s determination. 274 Fed. Appx. 501 (CA8 2008)\n(per curiam). And we granted certiorari to consider the\n“knowledge” issue—a matter about which the Circuits\nhave disagreed. Compare United States v. Godin, 534\nF. 3d 51 (CA1 2008) (knowledge requirement applies to “of\nanother person”); United States v. Miranda-Lopez, 532\nF. 3d 1034 (CA9 2008) (same); United States v. Villanueva-\nSotelo, 515 F. 3d 1234 (CADC 2008) (same), with United\nStates v. Mendoza-Gonzalez, 520 F. 3d 912 (CA8 2008)\n(knowledge requirement does not apply to “of another\nperson”); United States v. Hurtado, 508 F. 3d 603 (CA11\n2007) (per curiam) (same); United States v. Montejo, 442\nF. 3d 213 (CA4 2006) (same).\n4           FLORES-FIGUEROA v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              II \n\n   There are strong textual reasons for rejecting the Gov\nernment’s position. As a matter of ordinary English\ngrammar, it seems natural to read the statute’s word\n“knowingly” as applying to all the subsequently listed\nelements of the crime. The Government cannot easily\nclaim that the word “knowingly” applies only to the stat\nutes first four words, or even its first seven. It makes\nlittle sense to read the provision’s language as heavily\npenalizing a person who “transfers, possesses, or uses,\nwithout lawful authority” a something, but does not know,\nat the very least, that the “something” (perhaps inside a\nbox) is a “means of identification.” Would we apply a\nstatute that makes it unlawful “knowingly to possess\ndrugs” to a person who steals a passenger’s bag without\nknowing that the bag has drugs inside?\n   The Government claims more forcefully that the word\n“knowingly” applies to all but the statute’s last three\nwords, i.e., “of another person.” The statute, the Govern\nment says, does not require a prosecutor to show that the\ndefendant knows that the means of identification the\ndefendant has unlawfully used in fact belongs to another\nperson. But how are we to square this reading with the\nstatute’s language?\n   In ordinary English, where a transitive verb has an\nobject, listeners in most contexts assume that an adverb\n(such as knowingly) that modifies the transitive verb tells\nthe listener how the subject performed the entire action,\nincluding the object as set forth in the sentence. Thus, if a\nbank official says, “Smith knowingly transferred the funds\nto his brother’s account,” we would normally understand\nthe bank official’s statement as telling us that Smith knew\nthe account was his brother’s. Nor would it matter if the\nbank official said “Smith knowingly transferred the funds\nto the account of his brother.” In either instance, if the\nbank official later told us that Smith did not know the\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\naccount belonged to Smith’s brother, we should be\nsurprised.\n   Of course, a statement that does not use the word\n“knowingly” may be unclear about just what Smith knows.\nSuppose Smith mails his bank draft to Tegucigalpa, which\n(perhaps unbeknownst to Smith) is the capital of Hondu\nras. If the bank official says, “Smith sent a bank draft to\nthe capital of Honduras,” he has expressed next to nothing\nabout Smith’s knowledge of that geographic identity. But\nif the official were to say, “Smith knowingly sent a bank\ndraft to the capital of Honduras,” then the official has\nsuggested that Smith knows his geography.\n   Similar examples abound. If a child knowingly takes a\ntoy that belongs to his sibling, we assume that the child\nnot only knows that he is taking something, but that he\nalso knows that what he is taking is a toy and that the toy\nbelongs to his sibling. If we say that someone knowingly\nate a sandwich with cheese, we normally assume that the\nperson knew both that he was eating a sandwich and that\nit contained cheese. Or consider the Government’s own\nexample, “ ‘John knowingly discarded the homework of his\nsister.’ ” Brief for United States 9. The Government\nrightly points out that this sentence “does not necessarily”\nimply that John knew whom the homework belonged to.\nIbid. (emphasis added). But that is what the sentence, as\nordinarily used, does imply.\n   At the same time, dissimilar examples are not easy to\nfind. The Government says that “knowingly” modifies\nonly the verbs in the statute, while remaining indifferent\nto the subject’s knowledge of at least part of the transitive\nverb’s object. In certain contexts, a listener might under\nstand the word “knowingly” to be used in that way. But\nthe Government has not provided us with a single exam\nple of a sentence that, when used in typical fashion, would\nlead the hearer to believe that the word “knowingly” modi\nfies only a transitive verb without the full object, i.e., that\n6           FLORES-FIGUEROA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nit leaves the hearer gravely uncertain about the subject’s\nstate of mind in respect to the full object of the transitive\nverb in the sentence. The likely reason is that such sen\ntences typically involve special contexts or themselves\nprovide a more detailed explanation of background cir\ncumstances that call for such a reading. As JUSTICE ALITO\nnotes, the inquiry into a sentence’s meaning is a contex\ntual one. See post, at 3 (opinion concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment). No special context is present\nhere. See infra, at 8–10.\n   The manner in which the courts ordinarily interpret\ncriminal statutes is fully consistent with this ordinary\nEnglish usage. That is to say courts ordinarily read a\nphrase in a criminal statute that introduces the elements\nof a crime with the word “knowingly” as applying that\nword to each element. United States v. X-Citement Video,\nInc., 513 U. S. 64, 79 (1994) (STEVENS, J., concurring). For\nexample, in Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S. 419\n(1985), this Court interpreted a federal food stamp statute\nthat said, “ ‘whoever knowingly uses, transfers, acquires,\nalters, or possesses coupons or authorization cards in any\nmanner not authorized by [law]’ ” is subject to imprison\nment. Id., at 420, n. 1. The question was whether the\nword “knowingly” applied to the phrase “in any manner\nnot authorized by [law].” Id., at 423. The Court held that\nit did, id., at 433, despite the legal cliche “ignorance of the\nlaw is no excuse.”\n   More recently, we had to interpret a statute that penal\nizes “[a]ny person who—(1) knowingly transports or ships\nusing any means or facility of interstate or foreign com\nmerce by any means including by computer or mails, any\nvisual depiction, if—(A) the producing of such visual depic\ntion involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually\nexplicit conduct.” 18 U. S. C. §2252(a)(1)(A); X-Citement\nVideo, supra. In issue was whether the term “knowingly”\nin paragraph (1) modified the phrase “the use of a minor”\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin subparagraph (A). Id., at 69. The language in issue in\nX-Citement Video (like the language in Liparota) was more\nambiguous than the language here not only because the\nphrase “the use of a minor” was not the direct object of the\nverbs modified by “knowingly,” but also because it ap\npeared in a different subsection. 513 U. S., at 68–69.\nMoreover, the fact that many sex crimes involving minors\ndo not ordinarily require that a perpetrator know that his\nvictim is a minor supported the Government’s position.\nNonetheless, we again found that the intent element\napplied to “the use of a minor.” Id., at 72, and n. 2. Again\nthe Government, while pointing to what it believes are\nspecial features of each of these cases, provides us with no\nconvincing counterexample, although there may be such\nstatutory instances.\n   The Government correctly points out that in these cases\nmore was at issue than proper use of the English lan\nguage. But if more is at issue here, what is it? The Gov\nernment makes a further textual argument, a complex\nargument based upon a related provision of the statute.\nThat provision applies “[a]ggravated identity theft” where\nthe predicate crime is terrorism. See §1028A(a)(2). The\nprovision uses the same language as the provision before\nus up to the end, where it adds the words “or a false iden\ntification document.” Thus, it penalizes anyone who\n“knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful\nauthority, a means of identification of another person or a\nfalse identification document.” §1028A(a)(2).\n   The Government’s argument has four steps. Step One:\nWe should not interpret a statute in a manner that makes\nsome of its language superfluous. See, e.g., TRW Inc. v.\nAndrews, 534 U. S. 19, 31 (2001). Step Two: A person who\nknows that he is transferring, possessing, or using a\n“ ‘means of identification’ ” “ ‘without lawful authority,’ ”\nmust know that the document either (a) belongs “ ‘to an\nother person’ ” or (b) is a “ ‘false identification document’ ”\n8          FLORES-FIGUEROA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbecause “ ‘there are no other choices.’ ” Brief for United\nStates 14 (emphasis added). Step Three: Requiring the\noffender to know that the “means of identification” belongs\nto another person would consequently be superfluous in\nthis terrorism provision. Step Four: We should not inter\npret the same phrase (“of another person”) in the two\nrelated sections differently.\n   If we understand the argument correctly, it seems to\nsuffer two serious flaws. If the two listed circumstances\n(where the ID belongs to another person; where the ID is\nfalse) are the only two circumstances possibly present\nwhen a defendant (in this particular context) unlawfully\nuses a “means of identification,” then why list them at all?\nWhy not just stop after criminalizing the knowing unlaw\nful use of a “means of identification”? (Why specify that\nCongress does not mean the statute to cover, say, the use\nof dog tags?) The fact is, however, that the Government’s\nreasoning at Step Two is faulty. The two listed circum\nstances are not the only two circumstances possibly pre\nsent when a defendant unlawfully uses a “means of identi\nfication.” One could, for example, verbally provide a seller\nor an employer with a made-up Social Security number,\nnot an “identification document,” and the number verbally\ntransmitted to the seller or employer might, or might not,\nturn out to belong to another person. The word “know\ningly” applied to the “other person” requirement (even in a\nstatute that similarly penalizes use of a “false identifica\ntion document”) would not be surplus.\n   The Government also considers the statute’s purpose to\nbe a circumstance showing that the linguistic context here\nis special. It describes that purpose as “provid[ing] en\nhanced protection for individuals whose identifying infor\nmation is used to facilitate the commission of crimes.” Id.,\nat 5. And it points out that without the knowledge re\nquirement, potential offenders will take great care to avoid\nwrongly using IDs that belong to others, thereby enhanc\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning the protection that the statute offers.\n   The question, however, is whether Congress intended to\nachieve this enhanced protection by permitting conviction\nof those who do not know the ID they unlawfully use refers\nto a real person, i.e., those who do not intend to cause this\nfurther harm. And, in respect to this latter point, the\nstatute’s history (outside of the statute’s language) is\ninconclusive.\n   On the one hand, some statements in the legislative\nhistory offer the Government a degree of support. The\nrelevant House Report refers, for example, both to “iden\ntity theft” (use of an ID belonging to someone else) and to\n“identity fraud” (use of a false ID), often without distin\nguishing between the two. See, e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 108–\n528, p. 25 (2004) (statement of Rep. Coble). And, in equat\ning fraud and theft, Congress might have meant the stat\nute to cover both—at least where the fraud takes the form\nof using an ID that (without the offender’s knowledge)\nbelongs to someone else.\n   On the other hand, Congress separated the fraud crime\nfrom the theft crime in the statute itself. The title of one\nprovision (not here at issue) is “Fraud and related activity\nin connection with identification documents, authentica\ntion features, and information.” 18 U. S. C. §1028. The\ntitle of another provision (the provision here at issue) uses\nthe words “identity theft.” §1028A (emphasis added).\nMoreover, the examples of theft that Congress gives in the\nlegislative history all involve instances where the offender\nwould know that what he has taken identifies a different\nreal person. H. R. Rep. No. 108–528, at 4–5 (identifying as\nexamples of “identity theft” “ ‘dumpster diving,’ ” “access\ning information that was originally collected for an author\nized purpose,” “hack[ing] into computers,” and “steal[ing]\npaperwork likely to contain personal information”).\n   Finally, and perhaps of greatest practical importance,\nthere is the difficulty in many circumstances of proving\n10         FLORES-FIGUEROA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant has the neces\nsary knowledge. Take an instance in which an alien who\nunlawfully entered the United States gives an employer\nidentification documents that in fact belong to others.\nHow is the Government to prove that the defendant knew\nthat this was so? The Government may be able to show\nthat such a defendant knew the papers were not his. But\nperhaps the defendant did not care whether the papers (1)\nwere real papers belonging to another person or (2) were\nsimply counterfeit papers. The difficulties of proof along\nwith the defendant’s necessary guilt of a predicate crime\nand the defendant’s necessary knowledge that he has\nacted “without lawful authority,” make it reasonable, in\nthe Government’s view, to read the statute’s language as\ndispensing with the knowledge requirement.\n   We do not find this argument sufficient, however, to\nturn the tide in the Government’s favor. For one thing, in\nthe classic case of identity theft, intent is generally not\ndifficult to prove. For example, where a defendant has\nused another person’s identification information to get\naccess to that person’s bank account, the Government can\nprove knowledge with little difficulty. The same is true\nwhen the defendant has gone through someone else’s trash\nto find discarded credit card and bank statements, or\npretends to be from the victim’s bank and requests per\nsonal identifying information. Indeed, the examples of\nidentity theft in the legislative history (dumpster diving,\ncomputer hacking, and the like) are all examples of the\ntypes of classic identity theft where intent should be rela\ntively easy to prove, and there will be no practical en\nforcement problem. For another thing, to the extent that\nCongress may have been concerned about criminalizing\nthe conduct of a broader class of individuals, the concerns\nabout practical enforceability are insufficient to outweigh\nthe clarity of the text. Similar interpretations that we\nhave given other similarly phrased statutes also created\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npractical enforcement problems. See, e.g., X-Citement\nVideo, 513 U. S. 64; Liparota, 471 U. S. 419. But had\nCongress placed conclusive weight upon practical en\nforcement, the statute would likely not read the way it\nnow reads. Instead, Congress used the word “knowingly”\nfollowed by a list of offense elements. And we cannot find\nindications in statements of its purpose or in the practical\nproblems of enforcement sufficient to overcome the ordi\nnary meaning, in English or through ordinary interpretive\npractice, of the words that it wrote.\n   We conclude that §1028A(a)(1) requires the Government\nto show that the defendant knew that the means of identi\nfication at issue belonged to another person. The judg\nment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

S. C. §1028A(a)(1), the Government must\nprove that he “knew that the ‘means of identification’ he\n. . . unlawfully transferred, possessed, or used, in fact,\nbelonged to ‘another person.’ ” Ante, at 1. “Knowingly” is\nnot limited to the statute’s verbs, ante, at 4. Even the\nGovernment must concede that. See United States v.\nVillanueva-Sotelo, 515 F. 3d 1234, 1237 (CADC 2008)\n(“According to the government, this text is unambiguous:\nthe statute’s knowledge requirement extends only so far as\n‘means of identification’ ”). But once it is understood to\nmodify the object of those verbs, there is no reason to\nbelieve it does not extend to the phrase which limits that\nobject (“of another person”). Ordinary English usage\nsupports this reading, as the Court’s numerous sample\nsentences amply demonstrate. See ante, at 4–5.\n    But the Court is not content to stop at the statute’s text,\nand I do not join that further portion of the Court’s opin\nion. First, the Court relies in part on the principle that\n“courts ordinarily read a phrase in a criminal statute that\nintroduces the elements of a crime with the word ‘know\n2          FLORES-FIGUEROA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\ningly’ as applying that word to each element.” Ante, at 6.\nIf that is meant purely as a description of what most cases\ndo, it is perhaps true, and perhaps not. I have not can\nvassed all the cases and am hence agnostic. If it is meant,\nhowever, as a normative description of what courts should\nordinarily do when interpreting such statutes—and the\nreference to JUSTICE STEVENS’ concurring opinion in\nUnited States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U. S. 64, 79\n(1994), suggests as much—then I surely do not agree. The\nstructure of the text in X-Citement Video plainly separated\nthe “use of a minor” element from the “knowingly” re\nquirement, wherefore I thought (and think) that case was\nwrongly decided. See id., at 80–81 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\nIt is one thing to infer the common-law tradition of a mens\nrea requirement where Congress has not addressed the\nmental element of a crime. See Staples v. United States,\n511 U. S. 600, 605 (1994); United States v. United States\nGypsum Co., 438 U. S. 422, 437–438 (1978). It is some\nthing else to expand a mens rea requirement that the\nstatutory text has carefully limited.\n   I likewise cannot join the Court’s discussion of the (as\nusual, inconclusive) legislative history. Ante, at 9. Rely\ning on the statement of a single Member of Congress or an\nunvoted-upon (and for all we know unread) Committee\nReport to expand a statute beyond the limits its text sug\ngests is always a dubious enterprise. And consulting those\nincunabula with an eye to making criminal what the text\nwould otherwise permit is even more suspect. See United\nStates v. R. L. C., 503 U. S. 291, 307–309 (1992) (SCALIA,\nJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). In\ndeed, it is not unlike the practice of Caligula, who report\nedly “wrote his laws in a very small character, and hung\nthem up upon high pillars, the more effectually to ensnare\nthe people,” 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws\nof England 46 (1765).\n   The statute’s text is clear, and I would reverse the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals on that ground alone.\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

The Court says that\n“[i]n ordinary English, where a transitive verb has an\nobject, listeners in most contexts assume that an adverb\n(such as knowingly) that modifies the transitive verb tells\nthe listener how the subject performed the entire action,\nincluding the object as set forth in the sentence.” Ante, at\n4. The Court adds that counterexamples are “not easy to\nfind,” ante, at 5, and I suspect that the Court’s opinion will\nbe cited for the proposition that the mens rea of a federal\ncriminal statute nearly always applies to every element of\nthe offense.\n   I think that the Court’s point about ordinary English\nusage is overstated. Examples of sentences that do not\nconform to the Court’s rule are not hard to imagine. For\nexample: “The mugger knowingly assaulted two people in\nthe park—an employee of company X and a jogger from\ntown Y.” A person hearing this sentence would not likely\nassume that the mugger knew about the first victim’s\nemployer or the second victim’s home town. What matters\nin this example, and the Court’s, is context.\n2           FLORES-FIGUEROA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n   More to the point, ordinary writers do not often con\nstruct the particular kind of sentence at issue here, i.e., a\ncomplex sentence in which it is important to determine\nfrom the sentence itself whether the adverb denoting the\nactor’s intent applies to every characteristic of the sen\ntence’s direct object. Such sentences are a staple of crimi\nnal codes, but in ordinary speech, a different formulation\nis almost always used when the speaker wants to be clear\non the point. For example, a speaker might say: “Flores-\nFigueroa used a Social Security number that he knew\nbelonged to someone else” or “Flores-Figueroa used a\nSocial Security number that just happened to belong to a\nreal person.” But it is difficult to say with the confidence\nthe Court conveys that there is an “ordinary” understand\ning of the usage of the phrase at issue in this case.\n   In interpreting a criminal statute such as the one before\nus, I think it is fair to begin with a general presumption\nthat the specified mens rea applies to all the elements of\nan offense, but it must be recognized that there are in\nstances in which context may well rebut that presumption.\nFor example, 18 U. S. C. §2423(a) makes it unlawful to\n“knowingly transpor[t] an individual who has not attained\nthe age of 18 years in interstate or foreign commerce . . .\nwith intent that the individual engage in prostitution, or\nin any sexual activity for which any person can be charged\nwith a criminal offense.” The Courts of Appeals have\nuniformly held that a defendant need not know the vic\ntim’s age to be guilty under this statute. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Griffith, 284 F. 3d 338, 350–351 (CA2 2002);\nUnited States v. Taylor, 239 F. 3d 994, 997 (CA9 2001); cf.\nUnited States v. Chin, 981 F. 2d 1275, 1280 (CADC 1992)\n(Ginsburg, J.) (holding that 21 U. S. C. §861(a)(1), which\nmakes it unlawful to “knowingly and intentionally . . .\nemploy, hire, use, persuade, induce, entice, or coerce, a\nperson under eighteen years of age to violate” drug laws,\ndoes not require the defendant to have knowledge of the\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nminor’s age). Similarly, 8 U. S. C. §1327 makes it unlaw\nful to “knowingly ai[d] or assis[t] any alien inadmissible\nunder section 1182(a)(2) (insofar as an alien inadmissible\nunder such section has been convicted of an aggravated\nfelony) . . . to enter the United States.” The Courts of\nAppeals have held that the term “knowingly” in this con\ntext does not require the defendant to know that the alien\nhad been convicted of an aggravated felony. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Flores-Garcia, 198 F. 3d 1119, 1121–1123\n(CA9 2000); United States v. Figueroa, 165 F. 3d 111, 118–\n119 (CA2 1998).\n   In the present case, however, the Government has not\npointed to contextual features that warrant interpreting\n18 U. S. C. §1028A(a)(1) in a similar way. Indeed, the\nGovernment’s interpretation leads to exceedingly odd\nresults. Under that interpretation, if a defendant uses a\nmade-up Social Security number without having any\nreason to know whether it belongs to a real person, the\ndefendant’s liability under §1028A(a)(1) depends on\nchance: If it turns out that the number belongs to a real\nperson, two years will be added to the defendant’s sen\ntence, but if the defendant is lucky and the number does\nnot belong to another person, the statute is not violated.\n   I therefore concur in the judgment and join the opinion\nof the Court except insofar as it may be read to adopt an\ninflexible rule of construction that can rarely be overcome\nby contextual features pointing to a contrary reading.\n</pre>", "id": 145876, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2009/05/04/Flores-Figueroa_v._United_States.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2008                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued February 25, 2009—Decided May 4, 2009\nA federal statute forbidding “[a]ggravated identity theft” imposes a\n mandatory consecutive 2-year prison term on an individual convicted\n of certain predicate crimes if, during (or in relation to) the commis\n sion of those other crimes, the offender “knowingly . . . uses, without\n lawful authority, a means of identification of another person.” 18\n U. S. C. §1028A(a)(1) (emphasis added). After petitioner Flores-\n Figueroa, a Mexican citizen, gave his employer counterfeit Social Se\n curity and alien registration cards containing his name but other\n people’s identification numbers, he was arrested and charged with\n two immigration offenses and aggravated identity theft. Flores\n moved for acquittal on the latter charge, claiming that the Govern\n ment could not prove that he knew that the documents’ numbers\n were assigned to other people. The District Court agreed with the\n Government that the word “knowingly” in §1028A(a)(1) does not mod\n ify the statute’s last three words, “of another person,” and, after trial,\n found Flores guilty on all counts. The Eighth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Section §1028(a)(1) requires the Government to show that the\n defendant knew that the means of identification at issue belonged to\n another person. As a matter of ordinary English grammar, “know\n ingly” is naturally read as applying to all the subsequently listed\n elements of the crime. Where a transitive verb has an object, listen\n ers in most contexts assume that an adverb (such as “knowingly”)\n that modifies the verb tells the listener how the subject performed\n the entire action, including the object. The Government does not\n provide a single example of a sentence that, when used in typical\n fashion, would lead the hearer to a contrary understanding. And\n courts ordinarily interpret criminal statutes consistently with the or\n dinary English usage. See, e.g., Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S.\n2               FLORES-FIGUEROA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    419. The Government argues that this position is incorrect because it\n    would either require the same language to be interpreted differently\n    in a neighboring provision or would render the language in that pro\n    vision superfluous. This argument fails for two reasons. Finally, the\n    Government’s arguments based on the statute’s purpose and on the\n    practical problems of enforcing it are not sufficient to overcome the\n    ordinary meaning, in English or through ordinary interpretive prac\n    tice, of Congress’ words.

S. C. §1028A(a)(1) (emphasis\nadded). The question is whether the statute requires the\nGovernment to show that the defendant knew that the\n“means of identification” he or she unlawfully transferred,\npossessed, or used, in fact, belonged to “another person.”\nWe conclude that it does.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n  The statutory provision in question references a set of\npredicate crimes, including, for example, theft of govern\nment property, fraud, or engaging in various unlawful\nactivities related to passports, visas, and immigration.\n§1028A(c). It then provides that if any person who com\nmits any of those other crimes (in doing so) “knowingly\n2           FLORES-FIGUEROA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntransfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a\nmeans of identification of another person,” the judge must\nadd two years’ imprisonment to the offender’s underlying\nsentence. §1028A(a)(1). All parties agree that the provi\nsion applies only where the offender knows that he is\ntransferring, possessing, or using something. And the\nGovernment reluctantly concedes that the offender likely\nmust know that he is transferring, possessing, or using\nthat something without lawful authority. But they do not\nagree whether the provision requires that a defendant also\nknow that the something he has unlawfully transferred is,\nfor example, a real ID belonging to another person rather\nthan, say, a fake ID (i.e., a group of numbers that does not\ncorrespond to any real Social Security number).\n  Petitioner Ignacio Flores-Figueroa argues that the\nstatute requires that the Government prove that he knew\nthat the “means of identification” belonged to someone\nelse, i.e., was “a means of identification of another person.”\nThe Government argues that the statute does not impose\nthis particular knowledge requirement. The Government\nconcedes that the statute uses the word “knowingly,” but\nthat word, the Government claims, does not modify the\nstatute’s last phrase (“a means of identification of another\nperson”) or, at the least, it does not modify the last three\nwords of that phrase (“of another person”).\n                              B\n  The facts of this case illustrate the legal problem. Igna\ncio Flores-Figueroa is a citizen of Mexico. In 2000, to\nsecure employment, Flores gave his employer a false\nname, birth date, and Social Security number, along with\na counterfeit alien registration card. The Social Security\nnumber and the number on the alien registration card\nwere not those of a real person. In 2006, Flores presented\nhis employer with new counterfeit Social Security and\nalien registration cards; these cards (unlike Flores’ old\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nalien registration card) used his real name. But this time\nthe numbers on both cards were in fact numbers assigned\nto other people.\n   Flores’ employer reported his request to U. S. Immigra\ntion and Customs Enforcement. Customs discovered that\nthe numbers on Flores’ new documents belonged to other\npeople. The United States then charged Flores with two\npredicate crimes, namely, entering the United States\nwithout inspection, 8 U. S. C. §1325(a), and misusing\nimmigration documents, 18 U. S. C. §1546(a). And it\ncharged him with aggravated identity theft, 18 U. S. C.\n§1028A(a)(1), the crime at issue here.\n   Flores moved for a judgment of acquittal on the “aggra\nvated identity theft” counts. He claimed that the Govern\nment could not prove that he knew that the numbers on\nthe counterfeit documents were numbers assigned to other\npeople. The Government replied that it need not prove\nthat knowledge, and the District Court accepted the Gov\nernment’s argument. After a bench trial, the court found\nFlores guilty of the predicate crimes and aggravated iden\ntity theft. The Court of Appeals upheld the District\nCourt’s determination. 274 Fed. Appx. 501 (CA8 2008)\n(per curiam). And we granted certiorari to consider the\n“knowledge” issue—a matter about which the Circuits\nhave disagreed. Compare United States v. Godin, 534\nF. 3d 51 (CA1 2008) (knowledge requirement applies to “of\nanother person”); United States v. Miranda-Lopez, 532\nF. 3d 1034 (CA9 2008) (same); United States v. Villanueva-\nSotelo, 515 F. 3d 1234 (CADC 2008) (same), with United\nStates v. Mendoza-Gonzalez, 520 F. 3d 912 (CA8 2008)\n(knowledge requirement does not apply to “of another\nperson”); United States v. Hurtado, 508 F. 3d 603 (CA11\n2007) (per curiam) (same); United States v. Montejo, 442\nF. 3d 213 (CA4 2006) (same).\n4           FLORES-FIGUEROA v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              II \n\n   There are strong textual reasons for rejecting the Gov\nernment’s position. As a matter of ordinary English\ngrammar, it seems natural to read the statute’s word\n“knowingly” as applying to all the subsequently listed\nelements of the crime. The Government cannot easily\nclaim that the word “knowingly” applies only to the stat\nutes first four words, or even its first seven. It makes\nlittle sense to read the provision’s language as heavily\npenalizing a person who “transfers, possesses, or uses,\nwithout lawful authority” a something, but does not know,\nat the very least, that the “something” (perhaps inside a\nbox) is a “means of identification.” Would we apply a\nstatute that makes it unlawful “knowingly to possess\ndrugs” to a person who steals a passenger’s bag without\nknowing that the bag has drugs inside?\n   The Government claims more forcefully that the word\n“knowingly” applies to all but the statute’s last three\nwords, i.e., “of another person.” The statute, the Govern\nment says, does not require a prosecutor to show that the\ndefendant knows that the means of identification the\ndefendant has unlawfully used in fact belongs to another\nperson. But how are we to square this reading with the\nstatute’s language?\n   In ordinary English, where a transitive verb has an\nobject, listeners in most contexts assume that an adverb\n(such as knowingly) that modifies the transitive verb tells\nthe listener how the subject performed the entire action,\nincluding the object as set forth in the sentence. Thus, if a\nbank official says, “Smith knowingly transferred the funds\nto his brother’s account,” we would normally understand\nthe bank official’s statement as telling us that Smith knew\nthe account was his brother’s. Nor would it matter if the\nbank official said “Smith knowingly transferred the funds\nto the account of his brother.” In either instance, if the\nbank official later told us that Smith did not know the\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\naccount belonged to Smith’s brother, we should be\nsurprised.\n   Of course, a statement that does not use the word\n“knowingly” may be unclear about just what Smith knows.\nSuppose Smith mails his bank draft to Tegucigalpa, which\n(perhaps unbeknownst to Smith) is the capital of Hondu\nras. If the bank official says, “Smith sent a bank draft to\nthe capital of Honduras,” he has expressed next to nothing\nabout Smith’s knowledge of that geographic identity. But\nif the official were to say, “Smith knowingly sent a bank\ndraft to the capital of Honduras,” then the official has\nsuggested that Smith knows his geography.\n   Similar examples abound. If a child knowingly takes a\ntoy that belongs to his sibling, we assume that the child\nnot only knows that he is taking something, but that he\nalso knows that what he is taking is a toy and that the toy\nbelongs to his sibling. If we say that someone knowingly\nate a sandwich with cheese, we normally assume that the\nperson knew both that he was eating a sandwich and that\nit contained cheese. Or consider the Government’s own\nexample, “ ‘John knowingly discarded the homework of his\nsister.’ ” Brief for United States 9. The Government\nrightly points out that this sentence “does not necessarily”\nimply that John knew whom the homework belonged to.\nIbid. (emphasis added). But that is what the sentence, as\nordinarily used, does imply.\n   At the same time, dissimilar examples are not easy to\nfind. The Government says that “knowingly” modifies\nonly the verbs in the statute, while remaining indifferent\nto the subject’s knowledge of at least part of the transitive\nverb’s object. In certain contexts, a listener might under\nstand the word “knowingly” to be used in that way. But\nthe Government has not provided us with a single exam\nple of a sentence that, when used in typical fashion, would\nlead the hearer to believe that the word “knowingly” modi\nfies only a transitive verb without the full object, i.e., that\n6           FLORES-FIGUEROA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nit leaves the hearer gravely uncertain about the subject’s\nstate of mind in respect to the full object of the transitive\nverb in the sentence. The likely reason is that such sen\ntences typically involve special contexts or themselves\nprovide a more detailed explanation of background cir\ncumstances that call for such a reading. As JUSTICE ALITO\nnotes, the inquiry into a sentence’s meaning is a contex\ntual one. See post, at 3 (opinion concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment). No special context is present\nhere. See infra, at 8–10.\n   The manner in which the courts ordinarily interpret\ncriminal statutes is fully consistent with this ordinary\nEnglish usage. That is to say courts ordinarily read a\nphrase in a criminal statute that introduces the elements\nof a crime with the word “knowingly” as applying that\nword to each element. United States v. X-Citement Video,\nInc., 513 U. S. 64, 79 (1994) (STEVENS, J., concurring). For\nexample, in Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S. 419\n(1985), this Court interpreted a federal food stamp statute\nthat said, “ ‘whoever knowingly uses, transfers, acquires,\nalters, or possesses coupons or authorization cards in any\nmanner not authorized by [law]’ ” is subject to imprison\nment. Id., at 420, n. 1. The question was whether the\nword “knowingly” applied to the phrase “in any manner\nnot authorized by [law].” Id., at 423. The Court held that\nit did, id., at 433, despite the legal cliche “ignorance of the\nlaw is no excuse.”\n   More recently, we had to interpret a statute that penal\nizes “[a]ny person who—(1) knowingly transports or ships\nusing any means or facility of interstate or foreign com\nmerce by any means including by computer or mails, any\nvisual depiction, if—(A) the producing of such visual depic\ntion involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually\nexplicit conduct.” 18 U. S. C. §2252(a)(1)(A); X-Citement\nVideo, supra. In issue was whether the term “knowingly”\nin paragraph (1) modified the phrase “the use of a minor”\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin subparagraph (A). Id., at 69. The language in issue in\nX-Citement Video (like the language in Liparota) was more\nambiguous than the language here not only because the\nphrase “the use of a minor” was not the direct object of the\nverbs modified by “knowingly,” but also because it ap\npeared in a different subsection. 513 U. S., at 68–69.\nMoreover, the fact that many sex crimes involving minors\ndo not ordinarily require that a perpetrator know that his\nvictim is a minor supported the Government’s position.\nNonetheless, we again found that the intent element\napplied to “the use of a minor.” Id., at 72, and n. 2. Again\nthe Government, while pointing to what it believes are\nspecial features of each of these cases, provides us with no\nconvincing counterexample, although there may be such\nstatutory instances.\n   The Government correctly points out that in these cases\nmore was at issue than proper use of the English lan\nguage. But if more is at issue here, what is it? The Gov\nernment makes a further textual argument, a complex\nargument based upon a related provision of the statute.\nThat provision applies “[a]ggravated identity theft” where\nthe predicate crime is terrorism. See §1028A(a)(2). The\nprovision uses the same language as the provision before\nus up to the end, where it adds the words “or a false iden\ntification document.” Thus, it penalizes anyone who\n“knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful\nauthority, a means of identification of another person or a\nfalse identification document.” §1028A(a)(2).\n   The Government’s argument has four steps. Step One:\nWe should not interpret a statute in a manner that makes\nsome of its language superfluous. See, e.g., TRW Inc. v.\nAndrews, 534 U. S. 19, 31 (2001). Step Two: A person who\nknows that he is transferring, possessing, or using a\n“ ‘means of identification’ ” “ ‘without lawful authority,’ ”\nmust know that the document either (a) belongs “ ‘to an\nother person’ ” or (b) is a “ ‘false identification document’ ”\n8          FLORES-FIGUEROA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbecause “ ‘there are no other choices.’ ” Brief for United\nStates 14 (emphasis added). Step Three: Requiring the\noffender to know that the “means of identification” belongs\nto another person would consequently be superfluous in\nthis terrorism provision. Step Four: We should not inter\npret the same phrase (“of another person”) in the two\nrelated sections differently.\n   If we understand the argument correctly, it seems to\nsuffer two serious flaws. If the two listed circumstances\n(where the ID belongs to another person; where the ID is\nfalse) are the only two circumstances possibly present\nwhen a defendant (in this particular context) unlawfully\nuses a “means of identification,” then why list them at all?\nWhy not just stop after criminalizing the knowing unlaw\nful use of a “means of identification”? (Why specify that\nCongress does not mean the statute to cover, say, the use\nof dog tags?) The fact is, however, that the Government’s\nreasoning at Step Two is faulty. The two listed circum\nstances are not the only two circumstances possibly pre\nsent when a defendant unlawfully uses a “means of identi\nfication.” One could, for example, verbally provide a seller\nor an employer with a made-up Social Security number,\nnot an “identification document,” and the number verbally\ntransmitted to the seller or employer might, or might not,\nturn out to belong to another person. The word “know\ningly” applied to the “other person” requirement (even in a\nstatute that similarly penalizes use of a “false identifica\ntion document”) would not be surplus.\n   The Government also considers the statute’s purpose to\nbe a circumstance showing that the linguistic context here\nis special. It describes that purpose as “provid[ing] en\nhanced protection for individuals whose identifying infor\nmation is used to facilitate the commission of crimes.” Id.,\nat 5. And it points out that without the knowledge re\nquirement, potential offenders will take great care to avoid\nwrongly using IDs that belong to others, thereby enhanc\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning the protection that the statute offers.\n   The question, however, is whether Congress intended to\nachieve this enhanced protection by permitting conviction\nof those who do not know the ID they unlawfully use refers\nto a real person, i.e., those who do not intend to cause this\nfurther harm. And, in respect to this latter point, the\nstatute’s history (outside of the statute’s language) is\ninconclusive.\n   On the one hand, some statements in the legislative\nhistory offer the Government a degree of support. The\nrelevant House Report refers, for example, both to “iden\ntity theft” (use of an ID belonging to someone else) and to\n“identity fraud” (use of a false ID), often without distin\nguishing between the two. See, e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 108–\n528, p. 25 (2004) (statement of Rep. Coble). And, in equat\ning fraud and theft, Congress might have meant the stat\nute to cover both—at least where the fraud takes the form\nof using an ID that (without the offender’s knowledge)\nbelongs to someone else.\n   On the other hand, Congress separated the fraud crime\nfrom the theft crime in the statute itself. The title of one\nprovision (not here at issue) is “Fraud and related activity\nin connection with identification documents, authentica\ntion features, and information.” 18 U. S. C. §1028. The\ntitle of another provision (the provision here at issue) uses\nthe words “identity theft.” §1028A (emphasis added).\nMoreover, the examples of theft that Congress gives in the\nlegislative history all involve instances where the offender\nwould know that what he has taken identifies a different\nreal person. H. R. Rep. No. 108–528, at 4–5 (identifying as\nexamples of “identity theft” “ ‘dumpster diving,’ ” “access\ning information that was originally collected for an author\nized purpose,” “hack[ing] into computers,” and “steal[ing]\npaperwork likely to contain personal information”).\n   Finally, and perhaps of greatest practical importance,\nthere is the difficulty in many circumstances of proving\n10         FLORES-FIGUEROA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant has the neces\nsary knowledge. Take an instance in which an alien who\nunlawfully entered the United States gives an employer\nidentification documents that in fact belong to others.\nHow is the Government to prove that the defendant knew\nthat this was so? The Government may be able to show\nthat such a defendant knew the papers were not his. But\nperhaps the defendant did not care whether the papers (1)\nwere real papers belonging to another person or (2) were\nsimply counterfeit papers. The difficulties of proof along\nwith the defendant’s necessary guilt of a predicate crime\nand the defendant’s necessary knowledge that he has\nacted “without lawful authority,” make it reasonable, in\nthe Government’s view, to read the statute’s language as\ndispensing with the knowledge requirement.\n   We do not find this argument sufficient, however, to\nturn the tide in the Government’s favor. For one thing, in\nthe classic case of identity theft, intent is generally not\ndifficult to prove. For example, where a defendant has\nused another person’s identification information to get\naccess to that person’s bank account, the Government can\nprove knowledge with little difficulty. The same is true\nwhen the defendant has gone through someone else’s trash\nto find discarded credit card and bank statements, or\npretends to be from the victim’s bank and requests per\nsonal identifying information. Indeed, the examples of\nidentity theft in the legislative history (dumpster diving,\ncomputer hacking, and the like) are all examples of the\ntypes of classic identity theft where intent should be rela\ntively easy to prove, and there will be no practical en\nforcement problem. For another thing, to the extent that\nCongress may have been concerned about criminalizing\nthe conduct of a broader class of individuals, the concerns\nabout practical enforceability are insufficient to outweigh\nthe clarity of the text. Similar interpretations that we\nhave given other similarly phrased statutes also created\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npractical enforcement problems. See, e.g., X-Citement\nVideo, 513 U. S. 64; Liparota, 471 U. S. 419. But had\nCongress placed conclusive weight upon practical en\nforcement, the statute would likely not read the way it\nnow reads. Instead, Congress used the word “knowingly”\nfollowed by a list of offense elements. And we cannot find\nindications in statements of its purpose or in the practical\nproblems of enforcement sufficient to overcome the ordi\nnary meaning, in English or through ordinary interpretive\npractice, of the words that it wrote.\n   We conclude that §1028A(a)(1) requires the Government\nto show that the defendant knew that the means of identi\nfication at issue belonged to another person. The judg\nment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

S. C. §1028A(a)(1), the Government must\nprove that he “knew that the ‘means of identification’ he\n. . . unlawfully transferred, possessed, or used, in fact,\nbelonged to ‘another person.’ ” Ante, at 1. “Knowingly” is\nnot limited to the statute’s verbs, ante, at 4. Even the\nGovernment must concede that. See United States v.\nVillanueva-Sotelo, 515 F. 3d 1234, 1237 (CADC 2008)\n(“According to the government, this text is unambiguous:\nthe statute’s knowledge requirement extends only so far as\n‘means of identification’ ”). But once it is understood to\nmodify the object of those verbs, there is no reason to\nbelieve it does not extend to the phrase which limits that\nobject (“of another person”). Ordinary English usage\nsupports this reading, as the Court’s numerous sample\nsentences amply demonstrate. See ante, at 4–5.\n    But the Court is not content to stop at the statute’s text,\nand I do not join that further portion of the Court’s opin\nion. First, the Court relies in part on the principle that\n“courts ordinarily read a phrase in a criminal statute that\nintroduces the elements of a crime with the word ‘know\n2          FLORES-FIGUEROA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\ningly’ as applying that word to each element.” Ante, at 6.\nIf that is meant purely as a description of what most cases\ndo, it is perhaps true, and perhaps not. I have not can\nvassed all the cases and am hence agnostic. If it is meant,\nhowever, as a normative description of what courts should\nordinarily do when interpreting such statutes—and the\nreference to JUSTICE STEVENS’ concurring opinion in\nUnited States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U. S. 64, 79\n(1994), suggests as much—then I surely do not agree. The\nstructure of the text in X-Citement Video plainly separated\nthe “use of a minor” element from the “knowingly” re\nquirement, wherefore I thought (and think) that case was\nwrongly decided. See id., at 80–81 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\nIt is one thing to infer the common-law tradition of a mens\nrea requirement where Congress has not addressed the\nmental element of a crime. See Staples v. United States,\n511 U. S. 600, 605 (1994); United States v. United States\nGypsum Co., 438 U. S. 422, 437–438 (1978). It is some\nthing else to expand a mens rea requirement that the\nstatutory text has carefully limited.\n   I likewise cannot join the Court’s discussion of the (as\nusual, inconclusive) legislative history. Ante, at 9. Rely\ning on the statement of a single Member of Congress or an\nunvoted-upon (and for all we know unread) Committee\nReport to expand a statute beyond the limits its text sug\ngests is always a dubious enterprise. And consulting those\nincunabula with an eye to making criminal what the text\nwould otherwise permit is even more suspect. See United\nStates v. R. L. C., 503 U. S. 291, 307–309 (1992) (SCALIA,\nJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). In\ndeed, it is not unlike the practice of Caligula, who report\nedly “wrote his laws in a very small character, and hung\nthem up upon high pillars, the more effectually to ensnare\nthe people,” 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws\nof England 46 (1765).\n   The statute’s text is clear, and I would reverse the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals on that ground alone.\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

The Court says that\n“[i]n ordinary English, where a transitive verb has an\nobject, listeners in most contexts assume that an adverb\n(such as knowingly) that modifies the transitive verb tells\nthe listener how the subject performed the entire action,\nincluding the object as set forth in the sentence.” Ante, at\n4. The Court adds that counterexamples are “not easy to\nfind,” ante, at 5, and I suspect that the Court’s opinion will\nbe cited for the proposition that the mens rea of a federal\ncriminal statute nearly always applies to every element of\nthe offense.\n   I think that the Court’s point about ordinary English\nusage is overstated. Examples of sentences that do not\nconform to the Court’s rule are not hard to imagine. For\nexample: “The mugger knowingly assaulted two people in\nthe park—an employee of company X and a jogger from\ntown Y.” A person hearing this sentence would not likely\nassume that the mugger knew about the first victim’s\nemployer or the second victim’s home town. What matters\nin this example, and the Court’s, is context.\n2           FLORES-FIGUEROA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n   More to the point, ordinary writers do not often con\nstruct the particular kind of sentence at issue here, i.e., a\ncomplex sentence in which it is important to determine\nfrom the sentence itself whether the adverb denoting the\nactor’s intent applies to every characteristic of the sen\ntence’s direct object. Such sentences are a staple of crimi\nnal codes, but in ordinary speech, a different formulation\nis almost always used when the speaker wants to be clear\non the point. For example, a speaker might say: “Flores-\nFigueroa used a Social Security number that he knew\nbelonged to someone else” or “Flores-Figueroa used a\nSocial Security number that just happened to belong to a\nreal person.” But it is difficult to say with the confidence\nthe Court conveys that there is an “ordinary” understand\ning of the usage of the phrase at issue in this case.\n   In interpreting a criminal statute such as the one before\nus, I think it is fair to begin with a general presumption\nthat the specified mens rea applies to all the elements of\nan offense, but it must be recognized that there are in\nstances in which context may well rebut that presumption.\nFor example, 18 U. S. C. §2423(a) makes it unlawful to\n“knowingly transpor[t] an individual who has not attained\nthe age of 18 years in interstate or foreign commerce . . .\nwith intent that the individual engage in prostitution, or\nin any sexual activity for which any person can be charged\nwith a criminal offense.” The Courts of Appeals have\nuniformly held that a defendant need not know the vic\ntim’s age to be guilty under this statute. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Griffith, 284 F. 3d 338, 350–351 (CA2 2002);\nUnited States v. Taylor, 239 F. 3d 994, 997 (CA9 2001); cf.\nUnited States v. Chin, 981 F. 2d 1275, 1280 (CADC 1992)\n(Ginsburg, J.) (holding that 21 U. S. C. §861(a)(1), which\nmakes it unlawful to “knowingly and intentionally . . .\nemploy, hire, use, persuade, induce, entice, or coerce, a\nperson under eighteen years of age to violate” drug laws,\ndoes not require the defendant to have knowledge of the\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nminor’s age). Similarly, 8 U. S. C. §1327 makes it unlaw\nful to “knowingly ai[d] or assis[t] any alien inadmissible\nunder section 1182(a)(2) (insofar as an alien inadmissible\nunder such section has been convicted of an aggravated\nfelony) . . . to enter the United States.” The Courts of\nAppeals have held that the term “knowingly” in this con\ntext does not require the defendant to know that the alien\nhad been convicted of an aggravated felony. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Flores-Garcia, 198 F. 3d 1119, 1121–1123\n(CA9 2000); United States v. Figueroa, 165 F. 3d 111, 118–\n119 (CA2 1998).\n   In the present case, however, the Government has not\npointed to contextual features that warrant interpreting\n18 U. S. C. §1028A(a)(1) in a similar way. Indeed, the\nGovernment’s interpretation leads to exceedingly odd\nresults. Under that interpretation, if a defendant uses a\nmade-up Social Security number without having any\nreason to know whether it belongs to a real person, the\ndefendant’s liability under §1028A(a)(1) depends on\nchance: If it turns out that the number belongs to a real\nperson, two years will be added to the defendant’s sen\ntence, but if the defendant is lucky and the number does\nnot belong to another person, the statute is not violated.\n   I therefore concur in the judgment and join the opinion\nof the Court except insofar as it may be read to adopt an\ninflexible rule of construction that can rarely be overcome\nby contextual features pointing to a contrary reading.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145876/", "sha1": "258601526183466294d60c4db70e8cd2ec9955e7", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-055", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:08:52"}
