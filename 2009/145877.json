Argued February 24, 2009—Decided May 4, 2009\nRespondents filed a state-court suit alleging that petitioner had vio\n  lated state and federal law in connection with a patent dispute. After\n  removing the case to Federal District Court under 28 U. S. C.\n  §1441(c), which allows removal if the case includes at least one claim\n  over which the federal court has original jurisdiction, petitioner\n  moved to dismiss the suit’s only federal claim, which arose under the\n  Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Agree\n  ing that respondents had failed to state a RICO claim upon which re\n  lief could be granted, the District Court dismissed the claim; declined\n  to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state-law\n  claims under §1367(c)(3), which allows such a course if the court “has\n  dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction”; and re\n  manded the case to state court. The Federal Circuit dismissed peti\n  tioner’s appeal, finding that the remand order could be colorably\n  characterized as based on a “lack of subject matter jurisdiction” over\n  the state-law claims, §1447(c), and was therefore “not reviewable on\n  appeal,” §1447(d).\nHeld: A district court’s order remanding a case to state court after de\n clining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims is\n not a remand for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction for which appel\n late review is barred by §§1447(c) and (d). With respect to supple\n mental jurisdiction, a federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction\n over specified state-law claims, see §§1367(a), (c), and its decision\n whether to exercise that jurisdiction after dismissing every claim\n over which it had original jurisdiction is purely discretionary, see,\n e.g., Osborn v. Haley, 549 U. S. 225, 245. It is undisputed that when\n this case was removed, the District Court had original jurisdiction\n2          CARLSBAD TECHNOLOGY, INC. v.

On dismissing the RICO claim, the\n    court retained its statutory supplemental jurisdiction over the state\n    law claims. Its decision not to exercise that statutory authority was\n    not based on a jurisdictional defect, but on its discretionary choice.\n    See Chicago v. International College of Surgeons, 522 U.

HIF\n             BIO, INC., ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n                                  [May 4, 2009]\n\n  JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  In this case, we decide whether a federal court of ap\npeals has jurisdiction to review a district court’s order that\nremands a case to state court after declining to exercise\nsupplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims under 28\nU. S. C. §1367(c). The Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit held that appellate review of such an order is\nbarred by §1447(d) because it viewed the remand order in\nthis case as resting on the District Court’s lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction over the state-law claims. We disagree\nand reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n                              I\n   In 2005, respondents filed a complaint against peti\ntioner and others in California state court, alleging that\npetitioner had violated state and federal law in connection\nwith a patent dispute. Petitioner removed the case to the\nUnited States District Court for the Central District of\nCalifornia pursuant to §1441(c), which allows removal of\nan “entire case” when it includes at least one claim over\nwhich the federal district court has original jurisdiction.\nPetitioner then filed a motion to dismiss the only federal\n2       CARLSBAD TECHNOLOGY, INC. v. HIF BIO, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nclaim in the lawsuit, which arose under the Racketeer\nInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18\nU. S. C. §§1961–1968, for failure to adequately allege a\npattern of racketeering. HIF Bio, Inc. v. Yung Shin\nPharmaceuticals Indus. Co., 508 F. 3d 659, 662 (CA Fed.\n2007). The District Court agreed that respondents had\nfailed to state a RICO claim upon which relief could be\ngranted and dismissed the claim pursuant to Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The District Court also de\nclined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the re\nmaining state-law claims pursuant to 28 U. S. C.\n§1367(c)(3), which provides that a district court “may\ndecline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim”\nif “the district court has dismissed all claims over which it\nhas original jurisdiction.” The District Court then re\nmanded the case to state court as authorized by this\nCourt’s decision in Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484\nU. S. 343 (1988).\n   Petitioner appealed to the United States Court of Ap\npeals for the Federal Circuit, arguing that the District\nCourt should have exercised supplemental jurisdiction\nover the state-law claims because they implicate federal\npatent-law rights. 508 F. 3d, at 663. The Court of Ap\npeals dismissed the appeal, finding that the remand order\ncould “be colorably characterized as a remand based on\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction” and, therefore, could\nnot be reviewed under §§1447(c) and (d), which provide in\npart that remands for “lack of subject matter jurisdiction”\nare “not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.” See id., at\n667.\n   This Court has not yet decided whether a district court’s\norder remanding a case to state court after declining to\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction is a remand for lack of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction for which appellate review is\nbarred by §§1447(c) and (d). See Powerex Corp. v. Reliant\nEnergy Services, Inc., 551 U. S. 224, 235, n. 4 (2007) (“We\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

We granted certiorari to resolve this question,\n555 U. S. ___ (2008), and now hold that such remand\norders are not based on a lack of subject-matter jurisdic\ntion. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals and remand for further proceedings.\n                             II\n  Appellate review of remand orders is limited by 28\nU. S. C. §1447(d), which states:\n       “An order remanding a case to the State court from\n     which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or\n     otherwise, except that an order remanding a case to\n     the State court from which it was removed pursuant\n     to section 1443 of this title shall be reviewable by ap\n     peal or otherwise.”\nThis Court has consistently held that §1447(d) must be\nread in pari materia with §1447(c), thus limiting the\nremands barred from appellate review by §1447(d) to\nthose that are based on a ground specified in §1447(c).\nSee Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U. S.\n336, 345–346 (1976); see also Powerex, supra, at 229;\nQuackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U. S. 706, 711–712\n(1996); Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca, 516 U.

See Tr. of Oral Arg. 16, 22; cf. South Central Bell Telephone\nCo. v. Alabama, 526 U. S. 160, 171 (1999). We also note that the\nparties in Powerex, Quackenbush, and Things Remembered did not ask\nfor Thermtron to be overruled.\n4       CARLSBAD TECHNOLOGY, INC. v. HIF BIO, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlack of “subject matter jurisdiction.” §1447(c) (providing,\nin relevant part, that “[i]f at any time before final judg\nment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter\njurisdiction, the case shall be remanded”). The question\npresented in this case is whether the District Court’s\nremand order, which rested on its decision declining to\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction over respondents’ state\nlaw claims, is a remand based on a “lack of subject matter\njurisdiction” for purposes of §§1447(c) and (d). It is not.\n   “Subject matter jurisdiction defines the court’s authority\nto hear a given type of case,” United States v. Morton, 467\nU. S. 822, 828 (1984); it represents “the extent to which a\ncourt can rule on the conduct of persons or the status of\nthings.” Black’s Law Dictionary 870 (8th ed. 2004). This\nCourt’s precedent makes clear that whether a court has\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over a claim is distinct from\nwhether a court chooses to exercise that jurisdiction. See,\ne.g., Quackenbush, supra, at 712 (holding that an absten\ntion-based remand is not a remand for “lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction” for purposes of §§1447(c) and (d));\nAnkenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U. S. 689, 704 (1992) (ques\ntioning whether, “even though subject matter jurisdiction\nmight be proper, sufficient grounds exist to warrant ab\nstention from the exercise of that jurisdiction”); Iowa Mut.\nIns. Co. v. LaPlante, 480 U. S. 9, 16, n. 8 (1987) (referring\nto exhaustion requirement as “a matter of comity” that\ndoes “not deprive the federal courts of subject-matter\njurisdiction” but does “rende[r] it appropriate for\nthe federal courts to decline jurisdiction in certain\ncircumstances”).\n   With respect to supplemental jurisdiction in particular,\na federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction over speci\nfied state-law claims, which it may (or may not) choose to\nexercise. See §§1367(a), (c). A district court’s decision\nwhether to exercise that jurisdiction after dismissing\nevery claim over which it had original jurisdiction is\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)              5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npurely discretionary. See §1367(c) (“The district courts\nmay decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a\nclaim . . . if . . . the district court has dismissed all claims\nover which it has original jurisdiction” (emphasis added));\nOsborn v. Haley, 549 U. S. 225, 245 (2007) (“Even if only\nstate-law claims remained after resolution of the federal\nquestion, the District Court would have discretion, consis\ntent with Article III, to retain jurisdiction”); Arbaugh v. Y\n& H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 514 (2006) (“[W]hen a court\ngrants a motion to dismiss for failure to state a federal\nclaim, the court generally retains discretion to exercise\nsupplemental jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §1367,\nover pendent state-law claims”); see also 13D C. Wright,\nA. Miller, E. Cooper, & R. Freer, Federal Practice and\nProcedure §3567.3, pp. 428–432 (3d ed. 2008) (“Once it has\ndismissed the claims that invoked original bases of subject\nmatter jurisdiction, all that remains before the federal\ncourt are state-law claims. . . . The district court retains\ndiscretion to exercise supplemental jurisdiction [over\nthem]”). As a result, “the [district] court’s exercise of its\ndiscretion under §1367(c) is not a jurisdictional matter.\nThus, the court’s determination may be reviewed for abuse\nof discretion, but may not be raised at any time as a juris\ndictional defect.” 16 J. Moore et al., Moore’s Federal Prac\ntice §106.05[4], p. 106–27 (3d ed. 2009).\n   It is undisputed that when this case was removed to\nfederal court, the District Court had original jurisdiction\nover the federal RICO claim pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §1331\nand supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims\nbecause they were “so related to claims in the action\nwithin such original jurisdiction that they form[ed] part of\nthe same case or controversy under Article III of the\nUnited States Constitution.” §1367(a). Upon dismissal of\nthe federal claim, the District Court retained its statutory\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims. Its\ndecision declining to exercise that statutory authority was\n6       CARLSBAD TECHNOLOGY, INC. v. HIF BIO, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot based on a jurisdictional defect but on its discretionary\nchoice not to hear the claims despite its subject-matter\njurisdiction over them. See Chicago v. International Col\nlege of Surgeons, 522 U. S. 156, 173 (1997) (“Depending on\na host of factors, then—including the circumstances of the\nparticular case, the nature of the state law claims, the\ncharacter of the governing state law, and the relationship\nbetween the state and federal claims—district courts may\ndecline to exercise jurisdiction over supplemental state\nlaw claims”). The remand order, therefore, is not based on\na “lack of subject matter jurisdiction” for purposes of the\nbar to appellate review created by §§1447(c) and (d).\n   The Court of Appeals held to the contrary based on its\nconclusion that “every §1367(c) remand necessarily in\nvolves a predicate finding that the claims at issue lack an\nindependent basis of subject matter jurisdiction.” 508 F.\n3d, at 667. But, as explained above, §§1367(a) and (c)\nprovide a basis for subject-matter jurisdiction over any\nproperly removed state claim. See Osborn, supra, at 245;\nArbaugh, supra, at 514. We thus disagree with the Court\nof Appeals that the remand at issue here “can be colorably\ncharacterized as a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.” 508\nF. 3d, at 667.\n                        *     *   *\n  When a district court remands claims to a state court\nafter declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, the\nremand order is not based on a lack of subject-matter\njurisdiction for purposes of §§1447(c) and (d). The judg\nment of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Hermansdorfer, 423 U. S. 336 (1976).\nAnte, at 3–6.* As the Court notes, neither party has asked\nus to reconsider Thermtron, and we thus have no occasion\nto revisit that decision here, see ante, at 3, n.\n  I write separately, though, to note that our decision in\nThermtron was questionable in its day and is ripe for\nreconsideration in the appropriate case. Title 28 U. S. C.\n§1447(d) states that “[a]n order remanding a case to the\nState court from which it was removed is not reviewable\non appeal or otherwise.” The statute provides a single\nexception—not remotely implicated in this case—for cer\ntain civil rights cases removed under §1443. See §1447(d).\nAs then-Justice Rehnquist understatingly observed in his\nThermtron dissent, it would not be “unreasonabl[e] [to]\nbeliev[e] that 28 U. S. C. §1447(d) means what it says,”\n423 U. S., at 354; and what it says is no appellate review\n——————\n  *Contrary to JUSTICE BREYER’s suggestion, this case does not involve\nreading another “exceptio[n]” into 28 U. S. C. §1447(d)’s language. See\npost, at 2 (concurring opinion). Not, that is, if you think Thermtron was\nrightly decided. Unlike Osborn v. Haley, 549 U. S. 225 (2007), this case\nsimply involves applying Thermtron’s in pari materia reading of\n§1447(d) to the facts of this case.\n2       CARLSBAD TECHNOLOGY, INC. v. HIF BIO, INC.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nof remand orders. See also Osborn v. Haley, 549 U. S. 225,\n263 (2007) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Since the District\nCourt’s order in this case “remand[ed] a case to the State\ncourt from which it was removed,” it should be—in the\nwords of §1447(d)—“not reviewable on appeal or other\nwise.” Q. E. D.\n   Over the years, the Court has replaced the statute’s\nclear bar on appellate review with a hodgepodge of juris\ndictional rules that have no evident basis even in common\nsense. Under our decisions, there is no appellate jurisdic\ntion to review remands for lack of subject-matter jurisdic\ntion, see Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Services, Inc.,\n551 U. S. 224, 232 (2007), though with exception, see\nOsborn v. Haley, supra, at 243–244; there is jurisdiction to\nreview remands of supplemental state-law claims, and\nother remands based on abstention, see Quackenbush v.\nAllstate Ins. Co., 517 U. S. 706, 711–712 (1996), though\npresumably no jurisdiction to review remands based on\nthe “defects” referenced in §1447(c).

HIF\n             BIO, INC., ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n                         [May 4, 2009]\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER joins,\nconcurring.\n   I join the Court’s opinion. I write separately to note an\nanomaly about the way 28 U. S. C. §1447 works. In this\ncase, we consider a District Court’s decision not to retain\non its docket a case that once contained federal law issues\nbut now contains only state law issues. All agree that the\nlaw grants the District Court broad discretion to deter\nmine whether it should keep such cases on its docket, that\na decision to do so (or not to do so) rarely involves major\nlegal questions, and that (even if wrong) a district court\ndecision of this kind will not often have major adverse\nconsequences. We now hold that §1447 permits appellate\ncourts to review a district court decision of this kind, even\nif only for abuse of discretion.\n   Contrast today’s decision with our decision two Terms\nago in Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Services, Inc., 551\nU. S. 224 (2007). In that case, we considered a District\nCourt’s decision to remand a case in which a Canadian\nprovince-owned power company had sought removal—a\nmatter that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976\nspecifically authorizes federal judges (in certain instances)\nto decide. See §§1441(d); 1603(a). The case presented a\ndifficult legal question involving the commercial activities\nof a foreign sovereign; and the District Court’s decision (if\n2       CARLSBAD TECHNOLOGY, INC. v. HIF BIO, INC.\n\n                    BREYER, J., concurring\n\nwrong) had potentially serious adverse consequences,\nnamely preventing a sovereign power from obtaining the\nfederal trial to which the law (in its view) entitled it. We\nnonetheless held that §1447 forbids appellate courts from\nreviewing a district court decision of this kind. Id., at\n238–239.\n  Thus, we have held that §1447 permits review of a\ndistrict court decision in an instance where that decision is\nunlikely to be wrong and where a wrong decision is\nunlikely to work serious harm. And we have held that\n§1447 forbids review of a district court decision in an\ninstance where that decision may well be wrong and\nwhere a wrong decision could work considerable harm.\nUnless the circumstances I describe are unusual, some\nthing is wrong. And the fact that we have read other\nexceptions in the statute’s absolute-sounding language\nsuggests that such circumstances are not all that unusual.\nSee Osborn v. Haley, 549 U. S. 225, 240–244 (2007);\nThermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U. S. 336,\n350–352 (1976).\n  Consequently, while joining the majority, I suggest that\nexperts in this area of the law reexamine the matter with\nan eye toward determining whether statutory revision is\nappropriate.\n</pre>", "id": 145877, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2009/05/04/Carlsbad_Technology_Inc._v._HIF_Bio_Inc..pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2008                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued February 24, 2009—Decided May 4, 2009\nRespondents filed a state-court suit alleging that petitioner had vio\n  lated state and federal law in connection with a patent dispute. After\n  removing the case to Federal District Court under 28 U. S. C.\n  §1441(c), which allows removal if the case includes at least one claim\n  over which the federal court has original jurisdiction, petitioner\n  moved to dismiss the suit’s only federal claim, which arose under the\n  Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Agree\n  ing that respondents had failed to state a RICO claim upon which re\n  lief could be granted, the District Court dismissed the claim; declined\n  to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state-law\n  claims under §1367(c)(3), which allows such a course if the court “has\n  dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction”; and re\n  manded the case to state court. The Federal Circuit dismissed peti\n  tioner’s appeal, finding that the remand order could be colorably\n  characterized as based on a “lack of subject matter jurisdiction” over\n  the state-law claims, §1447(c), and was therefore “not reviewable on\n  appeal,” §1447(d).\nHeld: A district court’s order remanding a case to state court after de\n clining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims is\n not a remand for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction for which appel\n late review is barred by §§1447(c) and (d). With respect to supple\n mental jurisdiction, a federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction\n over specified state-law claims, see §§1367(a), (c), and its decision\n whether to exercise that jurisdiction after dismissing every claim\n over which it had original jurisdiction is purely discretionary, see,\n e.g., Osborn v. Haley, 549 U. S. 225, 245. It is undisputed that when\n this case was removed, the District Court had original jurisdiction\n2          CARLSBAD TECHNOLOGY, INC. v.

On dismissing the RICO claim, the\n    court retained its statutory supplemental jurisdiction over the state\n    law claims. Its decision not to exercise that statutory authority was\n    not based on a jurisdictional defect, but on its discretionary choice.\n    See Chicago v. International College of Surgeons, 522 U.

S. C. §1367(c). The Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit held that appellate review of such an order is\nbarred by §1447(d) because it viewed the remand order in\nthis case as resting on the District Court’s lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction over the state-law claims. We disagree\nand reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n                              I\n   In 2005, respondents filed a complaint against peti\ntioner and others in California state court, alleging that\npetitioner had violated state and federal law in connection\nwith a patent dispute. Petitioner removed the case to the\nUnited States District Court for the Central District of\nCalifornia pursuant to §1441(c), which allows removal of\nan “entire case” when it includes at least one claim over\nwhich the federal district court has original jurisdiction.\nPetitioner then filed a motion to dismiss the only federal\n2       CARLSBAD TECHNOLOGY, INC. v. HIF BIO, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nclaim in the lawsuit, which arose under the Racketeer\nInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18\nU. S. C. §§1961–1968, for failure to adequately allege a\npattern of racketeering. HIF Bio, Inc. v. Yung Shin\nPharmaceuticals Indus. Co., 508 F. 3d 659, 662 (CA Fed.\n2007). The District Court agreed that respondents had\nfailed to state a RICO claim upon which relief could be\ngranted and dismissed the claim pursuant to Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The District Court also de\nclined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the re\nmaining state-law claims pursuant to 28 U. S. C.\n§1367(c)(3), which provides that a district court “may\ndecline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim”\nif “the district court has dismissed all claims over which it\nhas original jurisdiction.” The District Court then re\nmanded the case to state court as authorized by this\nCourt’s decision in Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484\nU. S. 343 (1988).\n   Petitioner appealed to the United States Court of Ap\npeals for the Federal Circuit, arguing that the District\nCourt should have exercised supplemental jurisdiction\nover the state-law claims because they implicate federal\npatent-law rights. 508 F. 3d, at 663. The Court of Ap\npeals dismissed the appeal, finding that the remand order\ncould “be colorably characterized as a remand based on\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction” and, therefore, could\nnot be reviewed under §§1447(c) and (d), which provide in\npart that remands for “lack of subject matter jurisdiction”\nare “not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.” See id., at\n667.\n   This Court has not yet decided whether a district court’s\norder remanding a case to state court after declining to\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction is a remand for lack of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction for which appellate review is\nbarred by §§1447(c) and (d). See Powerex Corp. v. Reliant\nEnergy Services, Inc., 551 U. S. 224, 235, n. 4 (2007) (“We\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

We granted certiorari to resolve this question,\n555 U. S. ___ (2008), and now hold that such remand\norders are not based on a lack of subject-matter jurisdic\ntion. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals and remand for further proceedings.\n                             II\n  Appellate review of remand orders is limited by 28\nU. S. C. §1447(d), which states:\n       “An order remanding a case to the State court from\n     which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or\n     otherwise, except that an order remanding a case to\n     the State court from which it was removed pursuant\n     to section 1443 of this title shall be reviewable by ap\n     peal or otherwise.”\nThis Court has consistently held that §1447(d) must be\nread in pari materia with §1447(c), thus limiting the\nremands barred from appellate review by §1447(d) to\nthose that are based on a ground specified in §1447(c).\nSee Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U. S.\n336, 345–346 (1976); see also Powerex, supra, at 229;\nQuackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U. S. 706, 711–712\n(1996); Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca, 516 U.

See Tr. of Oral Arg. 16, 22; cf. South Central Bell Telephone\nCo. v. Alabama, 526 U. S. 160, 171 (1999). We also note that the\nparties in Powerex, Quackenbush, and Things Remembered did not ask\nfor Thermtron to be overruled.\n4       CARLSBAD TECHNOLOGY, INC. v. HIF BIO, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlack of “subject matter jurisdiction.” §1447(c) (providing,\nin relevant part, that “[i]f at any time before final judg\nment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter\njurisdiction, the case shall be remanded”). The question\npresented in this case is whether the District Court’s\nremand order, which rested on its decision declining to\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction over respondents’ state\nlaw claims, is a remand based on a “lack of subject matter\njurisdiction” for purposes of §§1447(c) and (d). It is not.\n   “Subject matter jurisdiction defines the court’s authority\nto hear a given type of case,” United States v. Morton, 467\nU. S. 822, 828 (1984); it represents “the extent to which a\ncourt can rule on the conduct of persons or the status of\nthings.” Black’s Law Dictionary 870 (8th ed. 2004). This\nCourt’s precedent makes clear that whether a court has\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over a claim is distinct from\nwhether a court chooses to exercise that jurisdiction. See,\ne.g., Quackenbush, supra, at 712 (holding that an absten\ntion-based remand is not a remand for “lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction” for purposes of §§1447(c) and (d));\nAnkenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U. S. 689, 704 (1992) (ques\ntioning whether, “even though subject matter jurisdiction\nmight be proper, sufficient grounds exist to warrant ab\nstention from the exercise of that jurisdiction”); Iowa Mut.\nIns. Co. v. LaPlante, 480 U. S. 9, 16, n. 8 (1987) (referring\nto exhaustion requirement as “a matter of comity” that\ndoes “not deprive the federal courts of subject-matter\njurisdiction” but does “rende[r] it appropriate for\nthe federal courts to decline jurisdiction in certain\ncircumstances”).\n   With respect to supplemental jurisdiction in particular,\na federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction over speci\nfied state-law claims, which it may (or may not) choose to\nexercise. See §§1367(a), (c). A district court’s decision\nwhether to exercise that jurisdiction after dismissing\nevery claim over which it had original jurisdiction is\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

See §1367(c) (“The district courts\nmay decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a\nclaim . . . if . . . the district court has dismissed all claims\nover which it has original jurisdiction” (emphasis added));\nOsborn v. Haley, 549 U. S. 225, 245 (2007) (“Even if only\nstate-law claims remained after resolution of the federal\nquestion, the District Court would have discretion, consis\ntent with Article III, to retain jurisdiction”); Arbaugh v. Y\n& H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 514 (2006) (“[W]hen a court\ngrants a motion to dismiss for failure to state a federal\nclaim, the court generally retains discretion to exercise\nsupplemental jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §1367,\nover pendent state-law claims”); see also 13D C. Wright,\nA. Miller, E. Cooper, & R. Freer, Federal Practice and\nProcedure §3567.3, pp. 428–432 (3d ed. 2008) (“Once it has\ndismissed the claims that invoked original bases of subject\nmatter jurisdiction, all that remains before the federal\ncourt are state-law claims. . . . The district court retains\ndiscretion to exercise supplemental jurisdiction [over\nthem]”). As a result, “the [district] court’s exercise of its\ndiscretion under §1367(c) is not a jurisdictional matter.\nThus, the court’s determination may be reviewed for abuse\nof discretion, but may not be raised at any time as a juris\ndictional defect.” 16 J. Moore et al., Moore’s Federal Prac\ntice §106.05[4], p. 106–27 (3d ed. 2009).\n   It is undisputed that when this case was removed to\nfederal court, the District Court had original jurisdiction\nover the federal RICO claim pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §1331\nand supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims\nbecause they were “so related to claims in the action\nwithin such original jurisdiction that they form[ed] part of\nthe same case or controversy under Article III of the\nUnited States Constitution.” §1367(a). Upon dismissal of\nthe federal claim, the District Court retained its statutory\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims. Its\ndecision declining to exercise that statutory authority was\n6       CARLSBAD TECHNOLOGY, INC. v. HIF BIO, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot based on a jurisdictional defect but on its discretionary\nchoice not to hear the claims despite its subject-matter\njurisdiction over them. See Chicago v. International Col\nlege of Surgeons, 522 U. S. 156, 173 (1997) (“Depending on\na host of factors, then—including the circumstances of the\nparticular case, the nature of the state law claims, the\ncharacter of the governing state law, and the relationship\nbetween the state and federal claims—district courts may\ndecline to exercise jurisdiction over supplemental state\nlaw claims”). The remand order, therefore, is not based on\na “lack of subject matter jurisdiction” for purposes of the\nbar to appellate review created by §§1447(c) and (d).\n   The Court of Appeals held to the contrary based on its\nconclusion that “every §1367(c) remand necessarily in\nvolves a predicate finding that the claims at issue lack an\nindependent basis of subject matter jurisdiction.” 508 F.\n3d, at 667. But, as explained above, §§1367(a) and (c)\nprovide a basis for subject-matter jurisdiction over any\nproperly removed state claim. See Osborn, supra, at 245;\nArbaugh, supra, at 514. We thus disagree with the Court\nof Appeals that the remand at issue here “can be colorably\ncharacterized as a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.” 508\nF. 3d, at 667.\n                        *     *   *\n  When a district court remands claims to a state court\nafter declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, the\nremand order is not based on a lack of subject-matter\njurisdiction for purposes of §§1447(c) and (d).

See §1447(d).\nAs then-Justice Rehnquist understatingly observed in his\nThermtron dissent, it would not be “unreasonabl[e] [to]\nbeliev[e] that 28 U. S. C. §1447(d) means what it says,”\n423 U. S., at 354; and what it says is no appellate review\n——————\n  *Contrary to JUSTICE BREYER’s suggestion, this case does not involve\nreading another “exceptio[n]” into 28 U. S. C. §1447(d)’s language. See\npost, at 2 (concurring opinion). Not, that is, if you think Thermtron was\nrightly decided. Unlike Osborn v. Haley, 549 U. S. 225 (2007), this case\nsimply involves applying Thermtron’s in pari materia reading of\n§1447(d) to the facts of this case.\n2       CARLSBAD TECHNOLOGY, INC. v. HIF BIO, INC.\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nof remand orders. See also Osborn v. Haley, 549 U. S. 225,\n263 (2007) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Since the District\nCourt’s order in this case “remand[ed] a case to the State\ncourt from which it was removed,” it should be—in the\nwords of §1447(d)—“not reviewable on appeal or other\nwise.” Q. E. D.\n   Over the years, the Court has replaced the statute’s\nclear bar on appellate review with a hodgepodge of juris\ndictional rules that have no evident basis even in common\nsense. Under our decisions, there is no appellate jurisdic\ntion to review remands for lack of subject-matter jurisdic\ntion, see Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Services, Inc.,\n551 U. S. 224, 232 (2007), though with exception, see\nOsborn v. Haley, supra, at 243–244; there is jurisdiction to\nreview remands of supplemental state-law claims, and\nother remands based on abstention, see Quackenbush v.\nAllstate Ins. Co., 517 U. S. 706, 711–712 (1996), though\npresumably no jurisdiction to review remands based on\nthe “defects” referenced in §1447(c). See also post, at 2\n(BREYER, J., concurring) (discussing similar anomalies). If\nthis muddle represents a welcome departure from the\nliteral text, see ante, at 2 (STEVENS, J., concurring), the\nworld is mad.\n   This mess—entirely of our own making—does not in my\nview require expert reexamination of this area of the law,\nsee post, at 2 (BREYER, J., concurring). It requires only the\nreconsideration of our decision in Thermtron—and a wel\ncome return to the Court’s focus on congressionally en\nacted text.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

HIF\n             BIO, INC., ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n                         [May 4, 2009]\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER joins,\nconcurring.\n   I join the Court’s opinion. I write separately to note an\nanomaly about the way 28 U. S. C. §1447 works. In this\ncase, we consider a District Court’s decision not to retain\non its docket a case that once contained federal law issues\nbut now contains only state law issues. All agree that the\nlaw grants the District Court broad discretion to deter\nmine whether it should keep such cases on its docket, that\na decision to do so (or not to do so) rarely involves major\nlegal questions, and that (even if wrong) a district court\ndecision of this kind will not often have major adverse\nconsequences. We now hold that §1447 permits appellate\ncourts to review a district court decision of this kind, even\nif only for abuse of discretion.\n   Contrast today’s decision with our decision two Terms\nago in Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Services, Inc., 551\nU. S. 224 (2007). In that case, we considered a District\nCourt’s decision to remand a case in which a Canadian\nprovince-owned power company had sought removal—a\nmatter that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976\nspecifically authorizes federal judges (in certain instances)\nto decide. See §§1441(d); 1603(a). The case presented a\ndifficult legal question involving the commercial activities\nof a foreign sovereign; and the District Court’s decision (if\n2       CARLSBAD TECHNOLOGY, INC. v. HIF BIO, INC.\n\n                    BREYER, J., concurring\n\nwrong) had potentially serious adverse consequences,\nnamely preventing a sovereign power from obtaining the\nfederal trial to which the law (in its view) entitled it. We\nnonetheless held that §1447 forbids appellate courts from\nreviewing a district court decision of this kind. Id., at\n238–239.\n  Thus, we have held that §1447 permits review of a\ndistrict court decision in an instance where that decision is\nunlikely to be wrong and where a wrong decision is\nunlikely to work serious harm. And we have held that\n§1447 forbids review of a district court decision in an\ninstance where that decision may well be wrong and\nwhere a wrong decision could work considerable harm.\nUnless the circumstances I describe are unusual, some\nthing is wrong. And the fact that we have read other\nexceptions in the statute’s absolute-sounding language\nsuggests that such circumstances are not all that unusual.\nSee Osborn v. Haley, 549 U. S. 225, 240–244 (2007);\nThermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U. S. 336,\n350–352 (1976).\n  Consequently, while joining the majority, I suggest that\nexperts in this area of the law reexamine the matter with\nan eye toward determining whether statutory revision is\nappropriate.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145877/", "sha1": "6faced32ee08de1905320c4154e60b8993e92f79", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-054", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:08:52"}
