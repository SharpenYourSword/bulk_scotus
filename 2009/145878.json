CARLISLE ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n        No. 08–146.     Argued March 3, 2009—Decided May 4, 2009\nAfter consulting with petitioners, respondents Wayne Carlisle, James\n  Bushman, and Gary Strassel used a shelter to minimize taxes from\n  the sale of their company. Limited liability corporations created by\n  Carlisle, Bushman, and Strassel (also respondents) entered into in\n  vestment-management agreements with Bricolage Capital, LLC, that\n  provided for arbitration of disputes. After the Internal Revenue Ser\n  vice found the tax shelter illegal, respondents filed a diversity suit\n  against petitioners. Claiming that equitable estoppel required re\n  spondents to arbitrate their claims per the agreements with Brico\n  lage, petitioners invoked §3 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9\n  U. S. C. §3, which entitles litigants to stay an action that is “referable\n  to arbitration under an agreement in writing.” Section 16(a)(1)(A) of\n  the FAA allows an appeal from “an order . . . refusing a stay of any\n  action under section 3.” The District Court denied petitioners’ stay\n  motions, and the Sixth Circuit dismissed their interlocutory appeal\n  for want of jurisdiction.\nHeld:\n    1. The Sixth Circuit had jurisdiction to review the denial of peti\n tioners’ requests for a §3 stay. By its clear and unambiguous terms,\n §16(a)(1)(A) entitles any litigant asking for a §3 stay to an immediate\n appeal from that motion’s denial—regardless of whether the litigant\n is in fact eligible for a stay. Jurisdiction over the appeal “must be de\n termined by focusing upon the category of order appealed from,\n rather than upon the strength of the grounds for reversing the order,”\n Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U. S. 299, 311. The statute unambiguously\n makes the underlying merits irrelevant, for even a request’s utter\n frivolousness cannot turn a denial into something other than “an or\n der . . . refusing a stay of any action under section 3,” §16(a)(1)(A).\n2                ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP v. CARLISLE\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Pp. 3–5.\n       2. A litigant who was not a party to the arbitration agreement may\n    invoke §3 if the relevant state contract law allows him to enforce the\n    agreement. Neither FAA §2—the substantive mandate making writ\n    ten arbitration agreements “valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save\n    upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of a\n    contract”—nor §3 purports to alter state contract law regarding the\n    scope of agreements. Accordingly, whenever the relevant state law\n    would make a contract to arbitrate a particular dispute enforceable\n    by a nonsignatory, that signatory is entitled to request and obtain a\n    stay under §3 because that dispute is “referable to arbitration under\n    an agreement in writing.” Because traditional state-law principles\n    allow enforcement of contracts by (or against) nonparties through,\n    e.g., assumption or third-party beneficiary theories, the Sixth Circuit\n    erred in holding that §3 relief is categorically not available to nonsig\n    natories. Questions as to the nature and scope of the applicable state\n    contract law in the present case have not been briefed here and can\n    be addressed on remand.

S. C. §3. Section 16(a)(1)(A), in turn, allows an ap\npeal from “an order . . . refusing a stay of any action under\nsection 3.” We address in this case whether appellate\ncourts have jurisdiction under §16(a) to review denials of\nstays requested by litigants who were not parties to the\nrelevant arbitration agreement, and whether §3 can ever\nmandate a stay in such circumstances.\n                            I\n  Respondents Wayne Carlisle, James Bushman, and\nGary Strassel set out to minimize their taxes from the\n1999 sale of their construction-equipment company. Ar\nthur Andersen LLP, a firm that had long served as their\ncompany’s accountant, auditor, and tax adviser, intro\nduced them to Bricolage Capital, LLC, which in turn\nreferred them for legal advice to Curtis, Mallet-Prevost,\nColt & Mosle, LLP. According to respondents, these ad\nvisers recommended a “leveraged option strategy” tax\n2             ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP v. CARLISLE\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nshelter designed to create illusory losses through foreign\ncurrency-exchange options. As a part of the scheme,\nrespondents invested in various stock warrants through\nnewly created limited liability corporations (LLCs), which\nare also respondents in this case. The respondent LLCs\nentered into investment-management agreements with\nBricolage, specifying that “[a]ny controversy arising out of\nor relating to this Agreement or the br[ea]ch thereof, shall\nbe settled by arbitration conducted in New York, New\nYork, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration\nRules of the American Arbitration Association.” App. 80–\n81, 99–100, 118–119.\n  As with all that seems too good to be true, a controversy\ndid indeed arise. The warrants respondents purchased\nturned out to be almost entirely worthless, and the Inter\nnal Revenue Service (IRS) determined in August 2000 that\nthe “leveraged option strategy” scheme was an illegal tax\nshelter. The IRS initially offered conditional amnesty to\ntaxpayers who had used such arrangements, but petition\ners failed to inform respondents of that option. Respon\ndents ultimately entered into a settlement program in\nwhich they paid the IRS all taxes, penalties, and interest\nowed.\n  Respondents filed this diversity suit in the Eastern\nDistrict of Kentucky against Bricolage, Arthur Andersen\nand others1 (all except Bricolage and its employees here\ninafter referred to as petitioners), alleging fraud, civil\nconspiracy, malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, and\n——————\n    1 Also\n         named in the suit were two employees of Bricolage (Andrew\nBeer and Samyak Veera); Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle, LLP;\nWilliam Bricker (the lawyer respondents worked with at the law firm);\nPrism Connectivity Ventures, LLC (the entity from whom the worthless\nwarrants were purchased); Integrated Capital Associates, Inc. (a prior\nowner of the worthless warrants who had also been a client of the law\nfirm); and Intercontinental Pacific Group, Inc. (a firm with the same\nprincipals as Integrated Capital Associates).\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

Petitioners moved to stay the action, invoking\n§3 of the FAA and arguing that the principles of equitable\nestoppel demanded that respondents arbitrate their claims\nunder their investment agreements with Bricolage.2 The\nDistrict Court denied the motions.\n  Petitioners filed an interlocutory appeal, which the\nCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit dismissed for want\nof jurisdiction. Carlisle v. Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt &\nMosle, LLP, 521 F. 3d 597, 602 (2008). We granted certio\nrari, 555 U. S. ___ (2008).\n                                  II\n    Ordinarily, courts of appeals have jurisdiction only over\n“final decisions” of district courts. 28 U. S. C. §1291. The\nFAA, however, makes an exception to that finality re\nquirement, providing that “an appeal may be taken from\n. . . an order . . . refusing a stay of any action under section\n3 of this title.” 9 U. S. C. §16(a)(1)(A). By that provision’s\nclear and unambiguous terms, any litigant who asks for a\nstay under §3 is entitled to an immediate appeal from\ndenial of that motion—regardless of whether the litigant\nis in fact eligible for a stay. Because each petitioner in\nthis case explicitly asked for a stay pursuant to §3, App.\n52, 54, 63, 65, the Sixth Circuit had jurisdiction to review\nthe District Court’s denial.\n    The courts that have declined jurisdiction over §3 ap\npeals of the sort at issue here have done so by conflating\nthe jurisdictional question with the merits of the appeal.\nThey reason that because stay motions premised on equi\ntable estoppel seek to expand (rather than simply vindi\ncate) agreements, they are not cognizable under §§3 and 4,\nand therefore the relevant motions are not actually “un\nder” those provisions. See, in addition to the opinion\n——————\n  2 Bricolage also moved for a stay under §3, but it filed for bankruptcy\n\nwhile its motion was pending, and the District Court denied the motion\nas moot.\n4              ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP v. CARLISLE\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nbelow, 521 F. 3d, at 602, DSMC Inc. v. Convera Corp., 349\nF. 3d 679, 682–685 (CADC 2003); In re Universal Serv.\nFund Tel. Billing Practice Litigation v. Sprint Communi\ncations Co., 428 F. 3d 940, 944–945 (CA10 2005). The\ndissent makes this step explicit, by reading the appellate\njurisdictional provision of §16 as “calling for a look\nthrough” to the substantive provisions of §3. Post, at 2.\nJurisdiction over the appeal, however, “must be deter\nmined by focusing upon the category of order appealed\nfrom, rather than upon the strength of the grounds for\nreversing the order.” Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U. S. 299,\n311 (1996).3 The jurisdictional statute here unambigu\nously makes the underlying merits irrelevant, for even\nutter frivolousness of the underlying request for a §3 stay\ncannot turn a denial into something other than “an order\n. . . refusing a stay of any action under section 3.” 9\nU. S. C. §16(a).\n    Respondents argue that this reading of §16(a) will pro\nduce a long parade of horribles, enmeshing courts in fact\nintensive jurisdictional inquiries and permitting frivolous\ninterlocutory appeals. Even if these objections could\n——————\n   3 Federal courts lack subject-matter jurisdiction when an asserted\n\nfederal claim is “ ‘so insubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by prior\ndecisions of this Court, or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to\ninvolve a federal controversy.’ ” Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Envi\nronment, 523 U. S. 83, 89 (1998) (quoting Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y.\nv. County of Oneida, 414 U. S. 661, 666 (1974)). Respondents have not\nrelied upon this line of cases as an alternative rationale for rejection of\njurisdiction, and there are good reasons for treating subject-matter\njurisdiction differently, in that respect, from the appellate jurisdiction\nhere conferred. A frivolous federal claim, if sufficient to confer jurisdic\ntion, would give the court power to hear related state-law claims, see 28\nU. S. C. §1367; no such collateral consequences are at issue here. And\nwhile an insubstantial federal claim can be said not to “aris[e] under\nthe Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States,” §1331, insub\nstantiality of the merits can hardly convert a judge’s “order . . . refusing\na stay” into an “order . . . refusing” something else. But we need not\nresolve this question today.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsurmount the plain language of the statute, we would not\nbe persuaded. Determination of whether §3 was invoked\nin a denied stay request is immeasurably more simple and\nless factbound than the threshold determination respon\ndents would replace it with: whether the litigant was a\nparty to the contract (an especially difficult question when\nthe written agreement is not signed). It is more appropri\nate to grapple with that merits question after the court\nhas accepted jurisdiction over the case. Second, there are\nways of minimizing the impact of abusive appeals. Appel\nlate courts can streamline the disposition of meritless\nclaims and even authorize the district court’s retention of\njurisdiction when an appeal is certified as frivolous. See\nBehrens, supra, at 310–311. And, of course, those inclined\nto file dilatory appeals must be given pause by courts’\nauthority to “award just damages and single or double\ncosts to the appellee” whenever an appeal is “frivolous.”\nFed. Rule App. Proc. 38.\n                            III\n   Even if the Court of Appeals were correct that it had no\njurisdiction over meritless appeals, its ground for finding\nthis appeal meritless was in error. We take the trouble to\naddress that alternative ground, since if the Court of\nAppeals is correct on the merits point we will have\nawarded petitioners a remarkably hollow victory. We\nconsider, therefore, the Sixth Circuit’s underlying deter\nmination that those who are not parties to a written arbi\ntration agreement are categorically ineligible for relief.\n   Section 2—the FAA’s substantive mandate—makes\nwritten arbitration agreements “valid, irrevocable, and\nenforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in\nequity for the revocation of a contract.” That provision\ncreates substantive federal law regarding the enforceabil\nity of arbitration agreements, requiring courts “to place\nsuch agreements upon the same footing as other con\n6              ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP v. CARLISLE\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntracts.” Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trus\ntees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 478\n(1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). Section 3, in\nturn, allows litigants already in federal court to invoke\nagreements made enforceable by §2. That provision re\nquires the court, “on application of one of the parties,”4 to\nstay the action if it involves an “issue referable to arbitra\ntion under an agreement in writing.” 9 U. S. C. §3.\n   Neither provision purports to alter background princi\nples of state contract law regarding the scope of agree\nments (including the question of who is bound by them).\nIndeed §2 explicitly retains an external body of law gov\nerning revocation (such grounds “as exist at law or in\nequity”).5 And we think §3 adds no substantive restriction\nto §2’s enforceability mandate. “[S]tate law,” therefore, is\napplicable to determine which contracts are binding under\n§2 and enforceable under §3 “if that law arose to govern\nissues concerning the validity, revocability, and enforce\nability of contracts generally.” Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S.\n483, 493, n. 9 (1987). See also First Options of Chicago,\nInc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 944 (1995). Because “tradi\n——————\n  4 Respondents do not contest that the term “parties” in §3 refers to\n\nparties to the litigation rather than parties to the contract. The adja\ncent provision, which explicitly refers to the “subject matter of a suit\narising out of the controversy between the parties,” 9 U. S. C. §4,\nunambiguously refers to adversaries in the action, and “identical words\nand phrases within the same statute should normally be given the\nsame meaning,” Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Services, Inc., 551\nU. S. 224, 232 (2007). Even without benefit of that canon, we would not\nbe disposed to believe that the statute allows a party to the contract\nwho is not a party to the litigation to apply for a stay of the proceeding.\n  5 We have said many times that federal law requires that “questions\n\nof arbitrability . . . be addressed with a healthy regard for the federal\npolicy favoring arbitration.” Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v.\nMercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24–25 (1983). Whatever the mean\ning of this vague prescription, it cannot possibly require the disregard\nof state law permitting arbitration by or against nonparties to the\nwritten arbitration agreement.\n                      Cite as: 556 U.

Lord, Williston on Contracts\n§57:19, p. 183 (4th ed. 2001), the Sixth Circuit’s holding\nthat nonparties to a contract are categorically barred from\n§3 relief was error.\n   Respondents argue that, as a matter of federal law,\nclaims to arbitration by nonparties are not “referable to\narbitration under an agreement in writing,” 9 U. S. C. §3\n(emphasis added), because they “seek to bind a signatory\nto an arbitral obligation beyond that signatory’s strictly\ncontractual obligation to arbitrate,” Brief for Respondents\n26. Perhaps that would be true if §3 mandated stays only\nfor disputes between parties to a written arbitration\nagreement. But that is not what the statute says. It says\nthat stays are required if the claims are “referable to\narbitration under an agreement in writing.” If a written\narbitration provision is made enforceable against (or for\nthe benefit of) a third party under state contract law, the\nstatute’s terms are fulfilled.6\n   Respondents’ final fallback consists of reliance upon\ndicta in our opinions, such as the statement that “arbitra\ntion . . . is a way to resolve those disputes—but only those\ndisputes—that the parties have agreed to submit to arbi\ntration,” First Options, supra, at 943, and the statement\nthat “[i]t goes without saying that a contract cannot bind a\n——————\n  6 We  thus reject the dissent’s contention that contract law’s long\nstanding endorsement of third-party enforcement is “a weak premise\nfor inferring an intent to allow third parties to obtain a §3 stay,” post,\nat 2. It seems to us not weak at all, in light of the terms of the statute.\nThere is no doubt that, where state law permits it, a third-party claim\nis “referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing.” It is not\nour role to conform an unambiguous statute to what we think “Con\ngress probably intended,” post, at 2.\n8           ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP v.

The former statement pertained to issues parties\nagreed to arbitrate, and the latter referred to an entity\n(the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) which\nobviously had no third-party obligations under the con\ntract in question. Neither these nor any of our other cases\nhave presented for decision the question whether arbitra\ntion agreements that are otherwise enforceable by (or\nagainst) third parties trigger protection under the FAA.\n   Respondents may be correct in saying that courts’ appli\ncation of equitable estoppel to impose an arbitration\nagreement upon strangers to the contract has been\n“somewhat loose.” Brief for Respondents 27, n. 15. But\nwe need not decide here whether the relevant state con\ntract law recognizes equitable estoppel as a ground for\nenforcing contracts against third parties, what standard it\nwould apply, and whether petitioners would be entitled to\nrelief under it. These questions have not been briefed\nbefore us and can be addressed on remand. It suffices to\nsay that no federal law bars the State from allowing peti\ntioners to enforce the arbitration agreement against re\nspondents and that §3 would require a stay in this case if\nit did.\n                        *     *    *\n   We hold that the Sixth Circuit had jurisdiction to review\nthe denial of petitioners’ request for a §3 stay and that a\nlitigant who was not a party to the relevant arbitration\nagreement may invoke §3 if the relevant state contract\nlaw allows him to enforce the agreement.

The question is whether it opens the door to such an\nappeal at the behest of one who has not signed a written\narbitration agreement. Based on the longstanding con­\ngressional policy limiting interlocutory appeals, I think\nthe better reading of the statutory provisions disallows\nsuch an appeal, and I therefore respectfully dissent.\n   Section 16(a) of the FAA provides that “[a]n appeal may\nbe taken from . . . an order . . . refusing a stay of any ac­\ntion under section 3 of this title.” 9 U. S. C. §16(a). The\nCourt says that any litigant who asks for and is denied a\n§3 stay is entitled to an immediate appeal. Ante, at 3.\nThe majority’s assumption is that “under section 3” is\nmerely a labeling requirement, without substantive im­\nport, but this fails to read §16 in light of the “firm congres­\nsional policy against interlocutory or ‘piecemeal’ appeals.”\nAbney v. United States, 431 U.

Congress has, however, “recognized the\nneed of exceptions for interlocutory orders in certain types\nof proceedings where the damage of error unreviewed\nbefore the judgment is definitive and complete . . . has\nbeen deemed greater than the disruption caused by inter­\nmediate appeal.” Ibid.

Ward, & J.\nLucas, Moore’s Federal Practice ¶110.06 (2d ed. 1996), are\nextraordinary interruptions to the normal process of liti­\ngation and ought to be limited carefully.\n   An obvious way to limit the scope of such an extraordi­\nnary interruption would be to read the §16 requirement\nthat the stay have been denied “under section 3” as calling\nfor a look-through to the provisions of §3, and to read §3\nitself as offering a stay only to signatories of an arbitration\nagreement. It is perfectly true that in general a third­\nparty beneficiary can enforce a contract, but this is a weak\npremise for inferring an intent to allow third parties to\nobtain a §3 stay and take a §16 appeal. While it is horn­\nbook contract law that third parties may enforce contracts\nfor their benefit as a matter of course, interlocutory ap­\npeals are a matter of limited grace. Because it would\ntherefore seem strange to assume that Congress meant to\ngrant the right to appeal a §3 stay denial to anyone as\nperipheral to the core agreement as a nonsignatory, it\nfollows that Congress probably intended to limit those able\nto seek a §3 stay.\n   Asking whether a §3 movant is a signatory provides a\nbright-line rule with predictable results to aid courts in\ndetermining jurisdiction over §16 interlocutory appeals.\nAnd that rule has the further virtue of mitigating the risk\nof intentional delay by savvy parties who seek to frustrate\nlitigation by gaming the system. Why not move for a §3\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nstay? If granted, arbitration will be mandated, and if\ndenied, a lengthy appeal may wear down the opponent.\nThe majority contends, ante, at 5, that “there are ways of\nminimizing the impact of abusive appeals.” Yes, but the\nsanctions suggested apply to the frivolous, not to the far­\nfetched; and as the majority’s opinion concludes, such an\nattenuated claim of equitable estoppel as petitioners raise\nhere falls well short of the sanctionable.\n  Because petitioners were not parties to the written\narbitration agreement, I would hold they could not move\nto stay the District Court proceedings under §3, with the\nconsequence that the Court of Appeals would have no\njurisdiction under §16 to entertain their appeal. I would\naccordingly affirm the judgment of the Sixth Circuit.\n</pre>", "id": 145878, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2009/05/04/Arthur_Andersen_LLP_v._Carlisle.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2008                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued March 3, 2009—Decided May 4, 2009\nAfter consulting with petitioners, respondents Wayne Carlisle, James\n  Bushman, and Gary Strassel used a shelter to minimize taxes from\n  the sale of their company. Limited liability corporations created by\n  Carlisle, Bushman, and Strassel (also respondents) entered into in\n  vestment-management agreements with Bricolage Capital, LLC, that\n  provided for arbitration of disputes. After the Internal Revenue Ser\n  vice found the tax shelter illegal, respondents filed a diversity suit\n  against petitioners. Claiming that equitable estoppel required re\n  spondents to arbitrate their claims per the agreements with Brico\n  lage, petitioners invoked §3 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9\n  U. S. C. §3, which entitles litigants to stay an action that is “referable\n  to arbitration under an agreement in writing.” Section 16(a)(1)(A) of\n  the FAA allows an appeal from “an order . . . refusing a stay of any\n  action under section 3.” The District Court denied petitioners’ stay\n  motions, and the Sixth Circuit dismissed their interlocutory appeal\n  for want of jurisdiction.\nHeld:\n    1. The Sixth Circuit had jurisdiction to review the denial of peti\n tioners’ requests for a §3 stay. By its clear and unambiguous terms,\n §16(a)(1)(A) entitles any litigant asking for a §3 stay to an immediate\n appeal from that motion’s denial—regardless of whether the litigant\n is in fact eligible for a stay. Jurisdiction over the appeal “must be de\n termined by focusing upon the category of order appealed from,\n rather than upon the strength of the grounds for reversing the order,”\n Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U. S. 299, 311. The statute unambiguously\n makes the underlying merits irrelevant, for even a request’s utter\n frivolousness cannot turn a denial into something other than “an or\n der . . . refusing a stay of any action under section 3,” §16(a)(1)(A).\n2                ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP v.

A litigant who was not a party to the arbitration agreement may\n    invoke §3 if the relevant state contract law allows him to enforce the\n    agreement. Neither FAA §2—the substantive mandate making writ\n    ten arbitration agreements “valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save\n    upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of a\n    contract”—nor §3 purports to alter state contract law regarding the\n    scope of agreements. Accordingly, whenever the relevant state law\n    would make a contract to arbitrate a particular dispute enforceable\n    by a nonsignatory, that signatory is entitled to request and obtain a\n    stay under §3 because that dispute is “referable to arbitration under\n    an agreement in writing.” Because traditional state-law principles\n    allow enforcement of contracts by (or against) nonparties through,\n    e.g., assumption or third-party beneficiary theories, the Sixth Circuit\n    erred in holding that §3 relief is categorically not available to nonsig\n    natories.

S. C. §3. Section 16(a)(1)(A), in turn, allows an ap\npeal from “an order . . . refusing a stay of any action under\nsection 3.” We address in this case whether appellate\ncourts have jurisdiction under §16(a) to review denials of\nstays requested by litigants who were not parties to the\nrelevant arbitration agreement, and whether §3 can ever\nmandate a stay in such circumstances.\n                            I\n  Respondents Wayne Carlisle, James Bushman, and\nGary Strassel set out to minimize their taxes from the\n1999 sale of their construction-equipment company. Ar\nthur Andersen LLP, a firm that had long served as their\ncompany’s accountant, auditor, and tax adviser, intro\nduced them to Bricolage Capital, LLC, which in turn\nreferred them for legal advice to Curtis, Mallet-Prevost,\nColt & Mosle, LLP. According to respondents, these ad\nvisers recommended a “leveraged option strategy” tax\n2             ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP v. CARLISLE\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nshelter designed to create illusory losses through foreign\ncurrency-exchange options. As a part of the scheme,\nrespondents invested in various stock warrants through\nnewly created limited liability corporations (LLCs), which\nare also respondents in this case. The respondent LLCs\nentered into investment-management agreements with\nBricolage, specifying that “[a]ny controversy arising out of\nor relating to this Agreement or the br[ea]ch thereof, shall\nbe settled by arbitration conducted in New York, New\nYork, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration\nRules of the American Arbitration Association.” App. 80–\n81, 99–100, 118–119.\n  As with all that seems too good to be true, a controversy\ndid indeed arise. The warrants respondents purchased\nturned out to be almost entirely worthless, and the Inter\nnal Revenue Service (IRS) determined in August 2000 that\nthe “leveraged option strategy” scheme was an illegal tax\nshelter. The IRS initially offered conditional amnesty to\ntaxpayers who had used such arrangements, but petition\ners failed to inform respondents of that option. Respon\ndents ultimately entered into a settlement program in\nwhich they paid the IRS all taxes, penalties, and interest\nowed.\n  Respondents filed this diversity suit in the Eastern\nDistrict of Kentucky against Bricolage, Arthur Andersen\nand others1 (all except Bricolage and its employees here\ninafter referred to as petitioners), alleging fraud, civil\nconspiracy, malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, and\n——————\n    1 Also\n         named in the suit were two employees of Bricolage (Andrew\nBeer and Samyak Veera); Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle, LLP;\nWilliam Bricker (the lawyer respondents worked with at the law firm);\nPrism Connectivity Ventures, LLC (the entity from whom the worthless\nwarrants were purchased); Integrated Capital Associates, Inc. (a prior\nowner of the worthless warrants who had also been a client of the law\nfirm); and Intercontinental Pacific Group, Inc. (a firm with the same\nprincipals as Integrated Capital Associates).\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

Petitioners moved to stay the action, invoking\n§3 of the FAA and arguing that the principles of equitable\nestoppel demanded that respondents arbitrate their claims\nunder their investment agreements with Bricolage.2 The\nDistrict Court denied the motions.\n  Petitioners filed an interlocutory appeal, which the\nCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit dismissed for want\nof jurisdiction. Carlisle v. Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt &\nMosle, LLP, 521 F. 3d 597, 602 (2008). We granted certio\nrari, 555 U. S. ___ (2008).\n                                  II\n    Ordinarily, courts of appeals have jurisdiction only over\n“final decisions” of district courts. 28 U. S. C. §1291. The\nFAA, however, makes an exception to that finality re\nquirement, providing that “an appeal may be taken from\n. . . an order . . . refusing a stay of any action under section\n3 of this title.” 9 U. S. C. §16(a)(1)(A). By that provision’s\nclear and unambiguous terms, any litigant who asks for a\nstay under §3 is entitled to an immediate appeal from\ndenial of that motion—regardless of whether the litigant\nis in fact eligible for a stay. Because each petitioner in\nthis case explicitly asked for a stay pursuant to §3, App.\n52, 54, 63, 65, the Sixth Circuit had jurisdiction to review\nthe District Court’s denial.\n    The courts that have declined jurisdiction over §3 ap\npeals of the sort at issue here have done so by conflating\nthe jurisdictional question with the merits of the appeal.\nThey reason that because stay motions premised on equi\ntable estoppel seek to expand (rather than simply vindi\ncate) agreements, they are not cognizable under §§3 and 4,\nand therefore the relevant motions are not actually “un\nder” those provisions. See, in addition to the opinion\n——————\n  2 Bricolage also moved for a stay under §3, but it filed for bankruptcy\n\nwhile its motion was pending, and the District Court denied the motion\nas moot.\n4              ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP v. CARLISLE\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nbelow, 521 F. 3d, at 602, DSMC Inc. v. Convera Corp., 349\nF. 3d 679, 682–685 (CADC 2003); In re Universal Serv.\nFund Tel. Billing Practice Litigation v. Sprint Communi\ncations Co., 428 F. 3d 940, 944–945 (CA10 2005). The\ndissent makes this step explicit, by reading the appellate\njurisdictional provision of §16 as “calling for a look\nthrough” to the substantive provisions of §3. Post, at 2.\nJurisdiction over the appeal, however, “must be deter\nmined by focusing upon the category of order appealed\nfrom, rather than upon the strength of the grounds for\nreversing the order.” Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U. S. 299,\n311 (1996).3 The jurisdictional statute here unambigu\nously makes the underlying merits irrelevant, for even\nutter frivolousness of the underlying request for a §3 stay\ncannot turn a denial into something other than “an order\n. . . refusing a stay of any action under section 3.” 9\nU. S. C. §16(a).\n    Respondents argue that this reading of §16(a) will pro\nduce a long parade of horribles, enmeshing courts in fact\nintensive jurisdictional inquiries and permitting frivolous\ninterlocutory appeals. Even if these objections could\n——————\n   3 Federal courts lack subject-matter jurisdiction when an asserted\n\nfederal claim is “ ‘so insubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by prior\ndecisions of this Court, or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to\ninvolve a federal controversy.’ ” Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Envi\nronment, 523 U. S. 83, 89 (1998) (quoting Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y.\nv. County of Oneida, 414 U. S. 661, 666 (1974)). Respondents have not\nrelied upon this line of cases as an alternative rationale for rejection of\njurisdiction, and there are good reasons for treating subject-matter\njurisdiction differently, in that respect, from the appellate jurisdiction\nhere conferred. A frivolous federal claim, if sufficient to confer jurisdic\ntion, would give the court power to hear related state-law claims, see 28\nU. S. C. §1367; no such collateral consequences are at issue here. And\nwhile an insubstantial federal claim can be said not to “aris[e] under\nthe Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States,” §1331, insub\nstantiality of the merits can hardly convert a judge’s “order . . . refusing\na stay” into an “order . . . refusing” something else. But we need not\nresolve this question today.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsurmount the plain language of the statute, we would not\nbe persuaded. Determination of whether §3 was invoked\nin a denied stay request is immeasurably more simple and\nless factbound than the threshold determination respon\ndents would replace it with: whether the litigant was a\nparty to the contract (an especially difficult question when\nthe written agreement is not signed). It is more appropri\nate to grapple with that merits question after the court\nhas accepted jurisdiction over the case. Second, there are\nways of minimizing the impact of abusive appeals. Appel\nlate courts can streamline the disposition of meritless\nclaims and even authorize the district court’s retention of\njurisdiction when an appeal is certified as frivolous. See\nBehrens, supra, at 310–311. And, of course, those inclined\nto file dilatory appeals must be given pause by courts’\nauthority to “award just damages and single or double\ncosts to the appellee” whenever an appeal is “frivolous.”\nFed. Rule App. Proc. 38.\n                            III\n   Even if the Court of Appeals were correct that it had no\njurisdiction over meritless appeals, its ground for finding\nthis appeal meritless was in error. We take the trouble to\naddress that alternative ground, since if the Court of\nAppeals is correct on the merits point we will have\nawarded petitioners a remarkably hollow victory. We\nconsider, therefore, the Sixth Circuit’s underlying deter\nmination that those who are not parties to a written arbi\ntration agreement are categorically ineligible for relief.\n   Section 2—the FAA’s substantive mandate—makes\nwritten arbitration agreements “valid, irrevocable, and\nenforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in\nequity for the revocation of a contract.” That provision\ncreates substantive federal law regarding the enforceabil\nity of arbitration agreements, requiring courts “to place\nsuch agreements upon the same footing as other con\n6              ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP v. CARLISLE\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntracts.” Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trus\ntees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 478\n(1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). Section 3, in\nturn, allows litigants already in federal court to invoke\nagreements made enforceable by §2. That provision re\nquires the court, “on application of one of the parties,”4 to\nstay the action if it involves an “issue referable to arbitra\ntion under an agreement in writing.” 9 U. S. C. §3.\n   Neither provision purports to alter background princi\nples of state contract law regarding the scope of agree\nments (including the question of who is bound by them).\nIndeed §2 explicitly retains an external body of law gov\nerning revocation (such grounds “as exist at law or in\nequity”).5 And we think §3 adds no substantive restriction\nto §2’s enforceability mandate. “[S]tate law,” therefore, is\napplicable to determine which contracts are binding under\n§2 and enforceable under §3 “if that law arose to govern\nissues concerning the validity, revocability, and enforce\nability of contracts generally.” Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S.\n483, 493, n. 9 (1987). See also First Options of Chicago,\nInc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 944 (1995). Because “tradi\n——————\n  4 Respondents do not contest that the term “parties” in §3 refers to\n\nparties to the litigation rather than parties to the contract. The adja\ncent provision, which explicitly refers to the “subject matter of a suit\narising out of the controversy between the parties,” 9 U. S. C. §4,\nunambiguously refers to adversaries in the action, and “identical words\nand phrases within the same statute should normally be given the\nsame meaning,” Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Services, Inc., 551\nU. S. 224, 232 (2007). Even without benefit of that canon, we would not\nbe disposed to believe that the statute allows a party to the contract\nwho is not a party to the litigation to apply for a stay of the proceeding.\n  5 We have said many times that federal law requires that “questions\n\nof arbitrability . . . be addressed with a healthy regard for the federal\npolicy favoring arbitration.” Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v.\nMercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24–25 (1983). Whatever the mean\ning of this vague prescription, it cannot possibly require the disregard\nof state law permitting arbitration by or against nonparties to the\nwritten arbitration agreement.\n                      Cite as: 556 U.

S. C. §3\n(emphasis added), because they “seek to bind a signatory\nto an arbitral obligation beyond that signatory’s strictly\ncontractual obligation to arbitrate,” Brief for Respondents\n26. Perhaps that would be true if §3 mandated stays only\nfor disputes between parties to a written arbitration\nagreement. But that is not what the statute says. It says\nthat stays are required if the claims are “referable to\narbitration under an agreement in writing.” If a written\narbitration provision is made enforceable against (or for\nthe benefit of) a third party under state contract law, the\nstatute’s terms are fulfilled.6\n   Respondents’ final fallback consists of reliance upon\ndicta in our opinions, such as the statement that “arbitra\ntion . . . is a way to resolve those disputes—but only those\ndisputes—that the parties have agreed to submit to arbi\ntration,” First Options, supra, at 943, and the statement\nthat “[i]t goes without saying that a contract cannot bind a\n——————\n  6 We  thus reject the dissent’s contention that contract law’s long\nstanding endorsement of third-party enforcement is “a weak premise\nfor inferring an intent to allow third parties to obtain a §3 stay,” post,\nat 2. It seems to us not weak at all, in light of the terms of the statute.\nThere is no doubt that, where state law permits it, a third-party claim\nis “referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing.” It is not\nour role to conform an unambiguous statute to what we think “Con\ngress probably intended,” post, at 2.\n8           ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP v.

Neither these nor any of our other cases\nhave presented for decision the question whether arbitra\ntion agreements that are otherwise enforceable by (or\nagainst) third parties trigger protection under the FAA.\n   Respondents may be correct in saying that courts’ appli\ncation of equitable estoppel to impose an arbitration\nagreement upon strangers to the contract has been\n“somewhat loose.” Brief for Respondents 27, n. 15. But\nwe need not decide here whether the relevant state con\ntract law recognizes equitable estoppel as a ground for\nenforcing contracts against third parties, what standard it\nwould apply, and whether petitioners would be entitled to\nrelief under it. These questions have not been briefed\nbefore us and can be addressed on remand. It suffices to\nsay that no federal law bars the State from allowing peti\ntioners to enforce the arbitration agreement against re\nspondents and that §3 would require a stay in this case if\nit did.\n                        *     *    *\n   We hold that the Sixth Circuit had jurisdiction to review\nthe denial of petitioners’ request for a §3 stay and that a\nlitigant who was not a party to the relevant arbitration\nagreement may invoke §3 if the relevant state contract\nlaw allows him to enforce the agreement.

The question is whether it opens the door to such an\nappeal at the behest of one who has not signed a written\narbitration agreement. Based on the longstanding con­\ngressional policy limiting interlocutory appeals, I think\nthe better reading of the statutory provisions disallows\nsuch an appeal, and I therefore respectfully dissent.\n   Section 16(a) of the FAA provides that “[a]n appeal may\nbe taken from . . . an order . . . refusing a stay of any ac­\ntion under section 3 of this title.” 9 U.

Ante, at 3.\nThe majority’s assumption is that “under section 3” is\nmerely a labeling requirement, without substantive im­\nport, but this fails to read §16 in light of the “firm congres­\nsional policy against interlocutory or ‘piecemeal’ appeals.”\nAbney v. United States, 431 U. S. 651, 656 (1977).\n   The right of appeal is “a creature of statute,” ibid., and\nCongress has granted the Federal Courts of Appeals juris­\ndiction to review “final decisions,” 28 U. S. C. §1291. “This\ninsistence on finality and prohibition of piecemeal review\n2           ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP v. CARLISLE\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\ndiscourage undue litigiousness and leaden-footed admini­\nstration of justice.” DiBella v. United States, 369 U. S.\n121, 124 (1962). Congress has, however, “recognized the\nneed of exceptions for interlocutory orders in certain types\nof proceedings where the damage of error unreviewed\nbefore the judgment is definitive and complete . . . has\nbeen deemed greater than the disruption caused by inter­\nmediate appeal.” Ibid. Section 16 functions as one such\nexception, but departures from “the dominant rule in\nfederal appellate practice,” 9 J. Moore, B. Ward, & J.\nLucas, Moore’s Federal Practice ¶110.06 (2d ed. 1996), are\nextraordinary interruptions to the normal process of liti­\ngation and ought to be limited carefully.\n   An obvious way to limit the scope of such an extraordi­\nnary interruption would be to read the §16 requirement\nthat the stay have been denied “under section 3” as calling\nfor a look-through to the provisions of §3, and to read §3\nitself as offering a stay only to signatories of an arbitration\nagreement. It is perfectly true that in general a third­\nparty beneficiary can enforce a contract, but this is a weak\npremise for inferring an intent to allow third parties to\nobtain a §3 stay and take a §16 appeal. While it is horn­\nbook contract law that third parties may enforce contracts\nfor their benefit as a matter of course, interlocutory ap­\npeals are a matter of limited grace. Because it would\ntherefore seem strange to assume that Congress meant to\ngrant the right to appeal a §3 stay denial to anyone as\nperipheral to the core agreement as a nonsignatory, it\nfollows that Congress probably intended to limit those able\nto seek a §3 stay.\n   Asking whether a §3 movant is a signatory provides a\nbright-line rule with predictable results to aid courts in\ndetermining jurisdiction over §16 interlocutory appeals.\nAnd that rule has the further virtue of mitigating the risk\nof intentional delay by savvy parties who seek to frustrate\nlitigation by gaming the system. Why not move for a §3\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nstay? If granted, arbitration will be mandated, and if\ndenied, a lengthy appeal may wear down the opponent.\nThe majority contends, ante, at 5, that “there are ways of\nminimizing the impact of abusive appeals.” Yes, but the\nsanctions suggested apply to the frivolous, not to the far­\nfetched; and as the majority’s opinion concludes, such an\nattenuated claim of equitable estoppel as petitioners raise\nhere falls well short of the sanctionable.\n  Because petitioners were not parties to the written\narbitration agreement, I would hold they could not move\nto stay the District Court proceedings under §3, with the\nconsequence that the Court of Appeals would have no\njurisdiction under §16 to entertain their appeal. I would\naccordingly affirm the judgment of the Sixth Circuit.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145878/", "sha1": "7be35838d79eeb91a9b8451883052ecd1e8ac227", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-053", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:08:52"}
