VENTRIS\n\n         CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF KANSAS\n\n    No. 07–1356. Argued January 21, 2009—Decided April 29, 2009\nRespondent Donnie Ray Ventris and Rhonda Theel were charged with\n  murder and other crimes. Prior to trial, an informant planted in\n  Ventris’s cell heard him admit to shooting and robbing the victim, but\n  Ventris testified at trial that Theel committed the crimes. When the\n  State sought to call the informant to testify to his contradictory\n  statement, Ventris objected. The State conceded that Ventris’s Sixth\n  Amendment right to counsel had likely been violated, but argued that\n  the statement was admissible for impeachment purposes. The trial\n  court allowed the testimony. The jury convicted Ventris of aggra\n  vated burglary and aggravated robbery. Reversing, the Kansas Su\n  preme Court held that the informant’s statements were not admissi\n  ble for any reason, including impeachment.\nHeld: Ventris’s statement to the informant, concededly elicited in viola\n tion of the Sixth Amendment, was admissible to impeach his incon\n sistent testimony at trial. Pp. 3–7.\n    (a) Whether a confession that was not admissible in the prosecu\n tion’s case in chief nonetheless can be admitted for impeachment\n purposes depends on the nature of the constitutional guarantee vio\n lated. The Fifth Amendment guarantee against compelled self\n incrimination is violated by introducing a coerced confession at trial,\n whether by way of impeachment or otherwise. New Jersey v. Por\n tash, 440 U. S. 450, 458–459. But for the Fourth Amendment guar\n antee against unreasonable searches or seizures, where exclusion\n comes by way of deterrent sanction rather than to avoid violation of\n the substantive guarantee, admissibility is determined by an exclu\n sionary-rule balancing test. See Walder v. United States, 347 U. S.\n 62, 65. The same is true for violations of the Fifth and Sixth\n Amendment prophylactic rules forbidding certain pretrial police con\n duct. See, e.g., Harris v. New York, 401 U. S. 222, 225–226. The core\n2                          KANSAS v. VENTRIS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is a trial right, but the right\n    covers pretrial interrogations to ensure that police manipulation does\n    not deprive the defendant of “ ‘effective representation by counsel at\n    the only stage when legal aid and advice would help him.’ ” Massiah\n    v. United States, 377 U. S. 201, 204. This right to be free of uncoun\n    seled interrogation is infringed at the time of the interrogation, not\n    when it is admitted into evidence. It is that deprivation that de\n    mands the remedy of exclusion from the prosecution’s case in chief.\n    Pp. 3–6.\n       (b) The interests safeguarded by excluding tainted evidence for im\n    peachment purposes are “outweighed by the need to prevent perjury\n    and to assure the integrity of the trial process.” Stone v. Powell, 428\n    U. S. 465, 488. Once the defendant testifies inconsistently, denying\n    the prosecution “the traditional truth-testing devices of the adversary\n    process,” Harris, supra, at 225, is a high price to pay for vindicating\n    the right to counsel at the prior stage. On the other hand, preventing\n    impeachment use of statements taken in violation of Massiah would\n    add little appreciable deterrence for officers, who have an incentive to\n    comply with the Constitution, since statements lawfully obtained can\n    be used for all purposes, not simply impeachment. In every other\n    context, this Court has held that tainted evidence is admissible for\n    impeachment. See, e.g., Oregon v. Hass, 420 U. S. 714, 723.

DONNIE RAY VENTRIS\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                       KANSAS\n\n                                [April 29, 2009] \n\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  We address in this case the question whether a defen\ndant’s incriminating statement to a jailhouse informant,\nconcededly elicited in violation of Sixth Amendment stric\ntures, is admissible at trial to impeach the defendant’s\nconflicting statement.\n                             I\n  In the early hours of January 7, 2004, after two days of\nno sleep and some drug use, Rhonda Theel and respondent\nDonnie Ray Ventris reached an ill-conceived agreement to\nconfront Ernest Hicks in his home. The couple testified\nthat the aim of the visit was simply to investigate rumors\nthat Hicks abused children, but the couple may have been\ninspired by the potential for financial gain: Theel had\nrecently learned that Hicks carried large amounts of cash.\n  The encounter did not end well. One or both of the pair\nshot and killed Hicks with shots from a .38-caliber re\nvolver, and the companions drove off in Hicks’s truck with\napproximately $300 of his money and his cell phone. On\nreceiving a tip from two friends of the couple who had\nhelped transport them to Hicks’s home, officers arrested\nVentris and Theel and charged them with various crimes,\n2                    KANSAS v. VENTRIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nchief among them murder and aggravated robbery. The\nState dropped the murder charge against Theel in ex\nchange for her guilty plea to the robbery charge and her\ntestimony identifying Ventris as the shooter.\n   Prior to trial, officers planted an informant in Ventris’s\nholding cell, instructing him to “keep [his] ear open and\nlisten” for incriminating statements. App. 146. According\nto the informant, in response to his statement that Ventris\nappeared to have “something more serious weighing in on\nhis mind,” Ventris divulged that “[h]e’d shot this man in\nhis head and in his chest” and taken “his keys, his wallet,\nabout $350.00, and . . . a vehicle.” Id., at 154, 150.\n   At trial, Ventris took the stand and blamed the robbery\nand shooting entirely on Theel. The government sought to\ncall the informant, to testify to Ventris’s prior contradic\ntory statement; Ventris objected. The State conceded that\nthere was “probably a violation” of Ventris’s Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel but nonetheless argued that\nthe statement was admissible for impeachment purposes\nbecause the violation “doesn’t give the Defendant . . . a\nlicense to just get on the stand and lie.” Id., at 143. The\ntrial court agreed and allowed the informant’s testimony,\nbut instructed the jury to “consider with caution” all tes\ntimony given in exchange for benefits from the State. Id.,\nat 30. The jury ultimately acquitted Ventris of felony\nmurder and misdemeanor theft but returned a guilty\nverdict on the aggravated burglary and aggravated rob\nbery counts.\n   The Kansas Supreme Court reversed the conviction,\nholding that “[o]nce a criminal prosecution has com\nmenced, the defendant’s statements made to an under\ncover informant surreptitiously acting as an agent for the\nState are not admissible at trial for any reason, including\nthe impeachment of the defendant’s testimony.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">595</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 606, 176 P. 3d 920, 928 (2008).

S. ___\n(2008).\n                              II\n   The Sixth Amendment, applied to the States through\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, guarantees that “[i]n all\ncriminal prosecutions, the accused shall . . . have the\nAssistance of Counsel for his defence.” The core of this\nright has historically been, and remains today, “the oppor\ntunity for a defendant to consult with an attorney and to\nhave him investigate the case and prepare a defense for\ntrial.” Michigan v. Harvey, 494 U. S. 344, 348 (1990). We\nhave held, however, that the right extends to having\ncounsel present at various pretrial “critical” interactions\nbetween the defendant and the State, United States v.\nWade, 388 U. S. 218, 224 (1967), including the deliberate\nelicitation by law enforcement officers (and their agents) of\nstatements pertaining to the charge, Massiah v. United\nStates, 377 U. S. 201, 206 (1964). The State has conceded\nthroughout these proceedings that Ventris’s confession\nwas taken in violation of Massiah’s dictates and was\ntherefore not admissible in the prosecution’s case in chief.\nWithout affirming that this concession was necessary, see\nKuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U. S. 436, 459–460 (1986), we\naccept it as the law of the case. The only question we\nanswer today is whether the State must bear the addi\ntional consequence of inability to counter Ventris’s contra\ndictory testimony by placing the informant on the stand.\n                            A\n  Whether otherwise excluded evidence can be admitted\nfor purposes of impeachment depends upon the nature of\nthe constitutional guarantee that is violated. Sometimes\nthat explicitly mandates exclusion from trial, and some\ntimes it does not. The Fifth Amendment guarantees that\nno person shall be compelled to give evidence against\nhimself, and so is violated whenever a truly coerced con\n4                    KANSAS v. VENTRIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfession is introduced at trial, whether by way of impeach\nment or otherwise. New Jersey v. Portash, 440 U. S. 450,\n458–459 (1979). The Fourth Amendment, on the other\nhand, guarantees that no person shall be subjected to\nunreasonable searches or seizures, and says nothing about\nexcluding their fruits from evidence; exclusion comes by\nway of deterrent sanction rather than to avoid violation of\nthe substantive guarantee. Inadmissibility has not been\nautomatic, therefore, but we have instead applied an\nexclusionary-rule balancing test. See Walder v. United\nStates, 347 U. S. 62, 65 (1954). The same is true for viola\ntions of the Fifth and Sixth Amendment prophylactic rules\nforbidding certain pretrial police conduct. See Harris v.\nNew York, 401 U. S. 222, 225–226 (1971); Harvey, supra,\nat 348–350.\n    Respondent argues that the Sixth Amendment’s right to\ncounsel is a “right an accused is to enjoy a[t] trial.” Brief\nfor Respondent 11. The core of the right to counsel is\nindeed a trial right, ensuring that the prosecution’s case is\nsubjected to “the crucible of meaningful adversarial test\ning.” United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 656 (1984).\nSee also Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 57–58 (1932).\nBut our opinions under the Sixth Amendment, as under\nthe Fifth, have held that the right covers pretrial interro\ngations to ensure that police manipulation does not render\ncounsel entirely impotent—depriving the defendant of\n“ ‘effective representation by counsel at the only stage\nwhen legal aid and advice would help him.’ ” Massiah,\nsupra, at 204 (quoting Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315,\n326 (1959) (Douglas, J., concurring)). See also Miranda v.\nArizona, 384 U. S. 436, 468–469 (1966).\n    Our opinion in Massiah, to be sure, was equivocal on\nwhat precisely constituted the violation. It quoted various\nauthorities indicating that the violation occurred at the\nmoment of the postindictment interrogation because such\nquestioning “ ‘contravenes the basic dictates of fairness in\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe conduct of criminal causes.’ ” 377 U. S., at 205 (quot\ning People v. Waterman, 9 N. Y. 2d 561, 565, 175 N. E. 2d\n445, 448 (1961)). But the opinion later suggested that the\nviolation occurred only when the improperly obtained\nevidence was “used against [the defendant] at his trial.”\n377 U. S., at 206–207. That question was irrelevant to the\ndecision in Massiah in any event. Now that we are con\nfronted with the question, we conclude that the Massiah\nright is a right to be free of uncounseled interrogation, and\nis infringed at the time of the interrogation. That, we\nthink, is when the “Assistance of Counsel” is denied.\n   It is illogical to say that the right is not violated until\ntrial counsel’s task of opposing conviction has been un\ndermined by the statement’s admission into evidence. A\ndefendant is not denied counsel merely because the prose\ncution has been permitted to introduce evidence of guilt—\neven evidence so overwhelming that the attorney’s job of\ngaining an acquittal is rendered impossible. In such\ncircumstances the accused continues to enjoy the assis\ntance of counsel; the assistance is simply not worth much.\nThe assistance of counsel has been denied, however, at the\nprior critical stage which produced the inculpatory evi\ndence. Our cases acknowledge that reality in holding that\nthe stringency of the warnings necessary for a waiver of\nthe assistance of counsel varies according to “the useful\nness of counsel to the accused at the particular [pretrial]\nproceeding.” Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U. S. 285, 298\n(1988). It is that deprivation which demands a remedy.\n   The United States insists that “post-charge deliberate\nelicitation of statements without the defendant’s counsel\nor a valid waiver of counsel is not intrinsically unlawful.”\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 17, n. 4. That is\ntrue when the questioning is unrelated to charged\ncrimes—the Sixth Amendment right is “offense specific,”\nMcNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 175 (1991). We have\nnever said, however, that officers may badger counseled\n6                    KANSAS v. VENTRIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndefendants about charged crimes so long as they do not\nuse information they gain. The constitutional violation\noccurs when the uncounseled interrogation is conducted.\n                              B\n   This case does not involve, therefore, the prevention of a\nconstitutional violation, but rather the scope of the remedy\nfor a violation that has already occurred. Our precedents\nmake clear that the game of excluding tainted evidence for\nimpeachment purposes is not worth the candle. The inter\nests safeguarded by such exclusion are “outweighed by the\nneed to prevent perjury and to assure the integrity of the\ntrial process.” Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 488 (1976).\n“It is one thing to say that the Government cannot make\nan affirmative use of evidence unlawfully obtained. It is\nquite another to say that the defendant can . . . provide\nhimself with a shield against contradiction of his un\ntruths.” Walder, supra, at 65. Once the defendant testi\nfies in a way that contradicts prior statements, denying\nthe prosecution use of “the traditional truth-testing de\nvices of the adversary process,” Harris, supra, at 225, is a\nhigh price to pay for vindication of the right to counsel at\nthe prior stage.\n   On the other side of the scale, preventing impeachment\nuse of statements taken in violation of Massiah would add\nlittle appreciable deterrence. Officers have significant\nincentive to ensure that they and their informants comply\nwith the Constitution’s demands, since statements law\nfully obtained can be used for all purposes rather than\nsimply for impeachment. And the ex ante probability that\nevidence gained in violation of Massiah would be of use for\nimpeachment is exceedingly small. An investigator would\nhave to anticipate both that the defendant would choose to\ntestify at trial (an unusual occurrence to begin with) and\nthat he would testify inconsistently despite the admissibil\nity of his prior statement for impeachment.

Oregon v. Hass, 420 U. S.\n714, 723 (1975). We have held in every other context that\ntainted evidence—evidence whose very introduction does\nnot constitute the constitutional violation, but whose\nobtaining was constitutionally invalid—is admissible for\nimpeachment. See ibid.; Walder, 347 U. S., at 65; Harris,\n401 U. S., at 226; Harvey, 494 U. S., at 348. We see no\ndistinction that would alter the balance here.*\n                         *    *    *\n   We hold that the informant’s testimony, concededly\nelicited in violation of the Sixth Amendment, was admis\nsible to challenge Ventris’s inconsistent testimony at trial.\nThe judgment of the Kansas Supreme Court is reversed,\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings not\ninconsistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n——————\n  * Respondent’s amicus insists that jailhouse snitches are so inher\nently unreliable that this Court should craft a broader exclusionary\nrule for uncorroborated statements obtained by that means.

Our legal\nsystem, however, is built on the premise that it is the province of the\njury to weigh the credibility of competing witnesses, and we have long\npurported to avoid “establish[ing] this Court as a rule-making organ for\nthe promulgation of state rules of criminal procedure.” Spencer v.\nTexas, 385 U. S. 554, 564 (1967). It would be especially inappropriate\nto fabricate such a rule in this case, where it appears the jury took to\nheart the trial judge’s cautionary instruction on the unreliability of\nrewarded informant testimony by acquitting Ventris of felony murder.\n                      Cite as: 556 U.

Harvey, 494 U. S. 344 (1990), the Court\nheld that a statement obtained from a defendant in viola\ntion of the Sixth Amendment could be used to impeach his\ntestimony at trial. As I explained in a dissent joined by\nthree other Members of the Court, that holding eroded the\nprinciple that “those who are entrusted with the power of\ngovernment have the same duty to respect and obey the\nlaw as the ordinary citizen.” Id., at 369. It was my view\nthen, as it is now, that “the Sixth Amendment is violated\nwhen the fruits of the State’s impermissible encounter\nwith the represented defendant are used for impeachment\njust as it is when the fruits are used in the prosecutor’s\ncase in chief.” Id., at 355.\n   In this case, the State has conceded that it violated the\nSixth Amendment as interpreted in Massiah v. United\nStates, 377 U. S. 201, 206 (1964), when it used a jailhouse\ninformant to elicit a statement from the defendant. No\nMiranda warnings were given to the defendant,1 nor was\nhe otherwise alerted to the fact that he was speaking to a\nstate agent. Even though the jury apparently did not\ncredit the informant’s testimony, the Kansas Supreme\nCourt correctly concluded that the prosecution should not\n——————\n 1 See   Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966).\n2                    KANSAS v. VENTRIS\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nbe allowed to exploit its pretrial constitutional violation\nduring the trial itself. The Kansas Court’s judgment\nshould be affirmed.\n   This Court’s contrary holding relies on the view that a\ndefendant’s pretrial right to counsel is merely “prophylac\ntic” in nature. See ante, at 4. The majority argues that\nany violation of this prophylactic right occurs solely at the\ntime the State subjects a counseled defendant to an un\ncounseled interrogation, not when the fruits of the encoun\nter are used against the defendant at trial. Ante, at 5.\nThis reasoning is deeply flawed.\n   The pretrial right to counsel is not ancillary to, or of\nlesser importance than, the right to rely on counsel at\ntrial. The Sixth Amendment grants the right to counsel\n“[i]n all criminal prosecutions,” and we have long recog\nnized that the right applies in periods before trial com\nmences, see United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 224\n(1967). We have never endorsed the notion that the pre\ntrial right to counsel stands at the periphery of the Sixth\nAmendment. To the contrary, we have explained that the\npretrial period is “perhaps the most critical period of the\nproceedings” during which a defendant “requires the\nguiding hand of counsel.” Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S.\n45, 57, 69 (1932); see Maine v. Moulton, 474 U. S. 159, 176\n(1985) (recognizing the defendant’s “right to rely on coun\nsel as a ‘medium’ between him and the State” in all critical\nstages of prosecution). Placing the prophylactic label on a\ncore Sixth Amendment right mischaracterizes the sweep\nof the constitutional guarantee.\n   Treating the State’s actions in this case as a violation of\na prophylactic right, the Court concludes that introducing\nthe illegally obtained evidence at trial does not itself\nviolate the Constitution.

The use of ill-gotten evidence during any\nphase of criminal prosecution does damage to the adver\nsarial process—the fairness of which the Sixth Amend\nment was designed to protect. See Strickland v. Washing\nton, 466 U. S. 668, 685 (1984); see also Adams v. United\nStates ex rel. McCann, 317 U. S. 269, 276 (1942) (“[The]\nprocedural devices rooted in experience were written into\nthe Bill of Rights not as abstract rubrics in an elegant code\nbut in order to assure fairness and justice before any\nperson could be deprived of ‘life, liberty, or property’ ”).\n   When counsel is excluded from a critical pretrial inter\naction between the defendant and the State, she may be\nunable to effectively counter the potentially devastating,\nand potentially false,2 evidence subsequently introduced at\ntrial. Inexplicably, today’s Court refuses to recognize that\nthis is a constitutional harm.3 Yet in Massiah, the Court\nforcefully explained that a defendant is “denied the basic\nprotections of the [Sixth Amendment] guarantee when\nthere [is] used against him at his trial evidence of his own\nincriminating words” that were “deliberately elicited from\n\n——————\n  2 The likelihood that evidence gathered by self-interested jailhouse\n\ninformants may be false cannot be ignored. See generally Brief for\nNational Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae.\nIndeed, by deciding to acquit respondent of felony murder, the jury\nseems to have dismissed the informant’s trial testimony as unreliable.\n  3 In the majority’s telling, “simply” having counsel whose help is “not\n\nworth much” is not a Sixth Amendment concern. Ante, at 5. Of course,\nthe Court points to no precedent for this stingy view of the Counsel\nClause, for we have never held that the Sixth Amendment only protects\na defendant from actual denials of counsel. Indeed our venerable\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel jurisprudence is built on a more\nrealistic understanding of what the Constitution guarantees. See\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984); McMann v. Richard\nson, 397 U. S. 759, 771, n. 14 (1970) (“[T]he right to counsel is the right\nto the effective assistance of counsel”).\n4                    KANSAS v.

Sadly, the majority has retreated\nfrom this robust understanding of the right to counsel.\n   Today’s decision is lamentable not only because of its\nflawed underpinnings, but also because it is another occa\nsion in which the Court has privileged the prosecution at\nthe expense of the Constitution. Permitting the State to\ncut corners in criminal proceedings taxes the legitimacy of\nthe entire criminal process. “The State’s interest in truth\nseeking is congruent with the defendant’s interest in\nrepresentation by counsel, for it is an elementary premise\nof our system of criminal justice ‘that partisan advocacy on\nboth sides of a case will best promote the ultimate objec\ntive that the guilty be convicted and the innocent go free.’ ”\nHarvey, 494 U.

Prior to trial, an informant planted in\n  Ventris’s cell heard him admit to shooting and robbing the victim, but\n  Ventris testified at trial that Theel committed the crimes. When the\n  State sought to call the informant to testify to his contradictory\n  statement, Ventris objected. The State conceded that Ventris’s Sixth\n  Amendment right to counsel had likely been violated, but argued that\n  the statement was admissible for impeachment purposes. The trial\n  court allowed the testimony. The jury convicted Ventris of aggra\n  vated burglary and aggravated robbery. Reversing, the Kansas Su\n  preme Court held that the informant’s statements were not admissi\n  ble for any reason, including impeachment.\nHeld: Ventris’s statement to the informant, concededly elicited in viola\n tion of the Sixth Amendment, was admissible to impeach his incon\n sistent testimony at trial. Pp. 3–7.\n    (a) Whether a confession that was not admissible in the prosecu\n tion’s case in chief nonetheless can be admitted for impeachment\n purposes depends on the nature of the constitutional guarantee vio\n lated.

But for the Fourth Amendment guar\n antee against unreasonable searches or seizures, where exclusion\n comes by way of deterrent sanction rather than to avoid violation of\n the substantive guarantee, admissibility is determined by an exclu\n sionary-rule balancing test. See Walder v. United States, 347 U. S.\n 62, 65. The same is true for violations of the Fifth and Sixth\n Amendment prophylactic rules forbidding certain pretrial police con\n duct.

United States, 377 U. S. 201, 204. This right to be free of uncoun\n    seled interrogation is infringed at the time of the interrogation, not\n    when it is admitted into evidence. It is that deprivation that de\n    mands the remedy of exclusion from the prosecution’s case in chief.\n    Pp. 3–6.\n       (b) The interests safeguarded by excluding tainted evidence for im\n    peachment purposes are “outweighed by the need to prevent perjury\n    and to assure the integrity of the trial process.” Stone v.

DONNIE RAY VENTRIS\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                       KANSAS\n\n                                [April 29, 2009] \n\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  We address in this case the question whether a defen\ndant’s incriminating statement to a jailhouse informant,\nconcededly elicited in violation of Sixth Amendment stric\ntures, is admissible at trial to impeach the defendant’s\nconflicting statement.\n                             I\n  In the early hours of January 7, 2004, after two days of\nno sleep and some drug use, Rhonda Theel and respondent\nDonnie Ray Ventris reached an ill-conceived agreement to\nconfront Ernest Hicks in his home. The couple testified\nthat the aim of the visit was simply to investigate rumors\nthat Hicks abused children, but the couple may have been\ninspired by the potential for financial gain: Theel had\nrecently learned that Hicks carried large amounts of cash.\n  The encounter did not end well. One or both of the pair\nshot and killed Hicks with shots from a .38-caliber re\nvolver, and the companions drove off in Hicks’s truck with\napproximately $300 of his money and his cell phone. On\nreceiving a tip from two friends of the couple who had\nhelped transport them to Hicks’s home, officers arrested\nVentris and Theel and charged them with various crimes,\n2                    KANSAS v. VENTRIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nchief among them murder and aggravated robbery. The\nState dropped the murder charge against Theel in ex\nchange for her guilty plea to the robbery charge and her\ntestimony identifying Ventris as the shooter.\n   Prior to trial, officers planted an informant in Ventris’s\nholding cell, instructing him to “keep [his] ear open and\nlisten” for incriminating statements. App. 146. According\nto the informant, in response to his statement that Ventris\nappeared to have “something more serious weighing in on\nhis mind,” Ventris divulged that “[h]e’d shot this man in\nhis head and in his chest” and taken “his keys, his wallet,\nabout $350.00, and . . . a vehicle.” Id., at 154, 150.\n   At trial, Ventris took the stand and blamed the robbery\nand shooting entirely on Theel. The government sought to\ncall the informant, to testify to Ventris’s prior contradic\ntory statement; Ventris objected. The State conceded that\nthere was “probably a violation” of Ventris’s Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel but nonetheless argued that\nthe statement was admissible for impeachment purposes\nbecause the violation “doesn’t give the Defendant . . . a\nlicense to just get on the stand and lie.” Id., at 143. The\ntrial court agreed and allowed the informant’s testimony,\nbut instructed the jury to “consider with caution” all tes\ntimony given in exchange for benefits from the State. Id.,\nat 30. The jury ultimately acquitted Ventris of felony\nmurder and misdemeanor theft but returned a guilty\nverdict on the aggravated burglary and aggravated rob\nbery counts.\n   The Kansas Supreme Court reversed the conviction,\nholding that “[o]nce a criminal prosecution has com\nmenced, the defendant’s statements made to an under\ncover informant surreptitiously acting as an agent for the\nState are not admissible at trial for any reason, including\nthe impeachment of the defendant’s testimony.” 285 Kan.\n595, 606, 176 P. 3d 920, 928 (2008).            Chief Justice\nMcFarland dissented, id., at 611, 176 P. 3d, at 930. We\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

S. ___\n(2008).\n                              II\n   The Sixth Amendment, applied to the States through\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, guarantees that “[i]n all\ncriminal prosecutions, the accused shall . . . have the\nAssistance of Counsel for his defence.” The core of this\nright has historically been, and remains today, “the oppor\ntunity for a defendant to consult with an attorney and to\nhave him investigate the case and prepare a defense for\ntrial.” Michigan v. Harvey, 494 U. S. 344, 348 (1990). We\nhave held, however, that the right extends to having\ncounsel present at various pretrial “critical” interactions\nbetween the defendant and the State, United States v.\nWade, 388 U. S. 218, 224 (1967), including the deliberate\nelicitation by law enforcement officers (and their agents) of\nstatements pertaining to the charge, Massiah v. United\nStates, 377 U. S. 201, 206 (1964). The State has conceded\nthroughout these proceedings that Ventris’s confession\nwas taken in violation of Massiah’s dictates and was\ntherefore not admissible in the prosecution’s case in chief.\nWithout affirming that this concession was necessary, see\nKuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U. S. 436, 459–460 (1986), we\naccept it as the law of the case. The only question we\nanswer today is whether the State must bear the addi\ntional consequence of inability to counter Ventris’s contra\ndictory testimony by placing the informant on the stand.\n                            A\n  Whether otherwise excluded evidence can be admitted\nfor purposes of impeachment depends upon the nature of\nthe constitutional guarantee that is violated. Sometimes\nthat explicitly mandates exclusion from trial, and some\ntimes it does not. The Fifth Amendment guarantees that\nno person shall be compelled to give evidence against\nhimself, and so is violated whenever a truly coerced con\n4                    KANSAS v. VENTRIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfession is introduced at trial, whether by way of impeach\nment or otherwise. New Jersey v. Portash, 440 U. S. 450,\n458–459 (1979). The Fourth Amendment, on the other\nhand, guarantees that no person shall be subjected to\nunreasonable searches or seizures, and says nothing about\nexcluding their fruits from evidence; exclusion comes by\nway of deterrent sanction rather than to avoid violation of\nthe substantive guarantee. Inadmissibility has not been\nautomatic, therefore, but we have instead applied an\nexclusionary-rule balancing test. See Walder v. United\nStates, 347 U. S. 62, 65 (1954). The same is true for viola\ntions of the Fifth and Sixth Amendment prophylactic rules\nforbidding certain pretrial police conduct. See Harris v.\nNew York, 401 U. S. 222, 225–226 (1971); Harvey, supra,\nat 348–350.\n    Respondent argues that the Sixth Amendment’s right to\ncounsel is a “right an accused is to enjoy a[t] trial.” Brief\nfor Respondent 11. The core of the right to counsel is\nindeed a trial right, ensuring that the prosecution’s case is\nsubjected to “the crucible of meaningful adversarial test\ning.” United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 656 (1984).\nSee also Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 57–58 (1932).\nBut our opinions under the Sixth Amendment, as under\nthe Fifth, have held that the right covers pretrial interro\ngations to ensure that police manipulation does not render\ncounsel entirely impotent—depriving the defendant of\n“ ‘effective representation by counsel at the only stage\nwhen legal aid and advice would help him.’ ” Massiah,\nsupra, at 204 (quoting Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315,\n326 (1959) (Douglas, J., concurring)). See also Miranda v.\nArizona, 384 U. S. 436, 468–469 (1966).\n    Our opinion in Massiah, to be sure, was equivocal on\nwhat precisely constituted the violation. It quoted various\nauthorities indicating that the violation occurred at the\nmoment of the postindictment interrogation because such\nquestioning “ ‘contravenes the basic dictates of fairness in\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe conduct of criminal causes.’ ” 377 U. S., at 205 (quot\ning People v. Waterman, 9 N. Y. 2d 561, 565, 175 N. E. 2d\n445, 448 (1961)). But the opinion later suggested that the\nviolation occurred only when the improperly obtained\nevidence was “used against [the defendant] at his trial.”\n377 U. S., at 206–207. That question was irrelevant to the\ndecision in Massiah in any event. Now that we are con\nfronted with the question, we conclude that the Massiah\nright is a right to be free of uncounseled interrogation, and\nis infringed at the time of the interrogation. That, we\nthink, is when the “Assistance of Counsel” is denied.\n   It is illogical to say that the right is not violated until\ntrial counsel’s task of opposing conviction has been un\ndermined by the statement’s admission into evidence. A\ndefendant is not denied counsel merely because the prose\ncution has been permitted to introduce evidence of guilt—\neven evidence so overwhelming that the attorney’s job of\ngaining an acquittal is rendered impossible. In such\ncircumstances the accused continues to enjoy the assis\ntance of counsel; the assistance is simply not worth much.\nThe assistance of counsel has been denied, however, at the\nprior critical stage which produced the inculpatory evi\ndence. Our cases acknowledge that reality in holding that\nthe stringency of the warnings necessary for a waiver of\nthe assistance of counsel varies according to “the useful\nness of counsel to the accused at the particular [pretrial]\nproceeding.” Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U. S. 285, 298\n(1988). It is that deprivation which demands a remedy.\n   The United States insists that “post-charge deliberate\nelicitation of statements without the defendant’s counsel\nor a valid waiver of counsel is not intrinsically unlawful.”\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 17, n. 4. That is\ntrue when the questioning is unrelated to charged\ncrimes—the Sixth Amendment right is “offense specific,”\nMcNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 175 (1991). We have\nnever said, however, that officers may badger counseled\n6                    KANSAS v. VENTRIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndefendants about charged crimes so long as they do not\nuse information they gain. The constitutional violation\noccurs when the uncounseled interrogation is conducted.\n                              B\n   This case does not involve, therefore, the prevention of a\nconstitutional violation, but rather the scope of the remedy\nfor a violation that has already occurred. Our precedents\nmake clear that the game of excluding tainted evidence for\nimpeachment purposes is not worth the candle. The inter\nests safeguarded by such exclusion are “outweighed by the\nneed to prevent perjury and to assure the integrity of the\ntrial process.” Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 488 (1976).\n“It is one thing to say that the Government cannot make\nan affirmative use of evidence unlawfully obtained. It is\nquite another to say that the defendant can . . . provide\nhimself with a shield against contradiction of his un\ntruths.” Walder, supra, at 65. Once the defendant testi\nfies in a way that contradicts prior statements, denying\nthe prosecution use of “the traditional truth-testing de\nvices of the adversary process,” Harris, supra, at 225, is a\nhigh price to pay for vindication of the right to counsel at\nthe prior stage.\n   On the other side of the scale, preventing impeachment\nuse of statements taken in violation of Massiah would add\nlittle appreciable deterrence. Officers have significant\nincentive to ensure that they and their informants comply\nwith the Constitution’s demands, since statements law\nfully obtained can be used for all purposes rather than\nsimply for impeachment. And the ex ante probability that\nevidence gained in violation of Massiah would be of use for\nimpeachment is exceedingly small. An investigator would\nhave to anticipate both that the defendant would choose to\ntestify at trial (an unusual occurrence to begin with) and\nthat he would testify inconsistently despite the admissibil\nity of his prior statement for impeachment.

Oregon v. Hass, 420 U. S.\n714, 723 (1975). We have held in every other context that\ntainted evidence—evidence whose very introduction does\nnot constitute the constitutional violation, but whose\nobtaining was constitutionally invalid—is admissible for\nimpeachment. See ibid.; Walder, 347 U. S., at 65; Harris,\n401 U. S., at 226; Harvey, 494 U. S., at 348.

Harvey, 494 U. S. 344 (1990), the Court\nheld that a statement obtained from a defendant in viola\ntion of the Sixth Amendment could be used to impeach his\ntestimony at trial. As I explained in a dissent joined by\nthree other Members of the Court, that holding eroded the\nprinciple that “those who are entrusted with the power of\ngovernment have the same duty to respect and obey the\nlaw as the ordinary citizen.” Id., at 369. It was my view\nthen, as it is now, that “the Sixth Amendment is violated\nwhen the fruits of the State’s impermissible encounter\nwith the represented defendant are used for impeachment\njust as it is when the fruits are used in the prosecutor’s\ncase in chief.” Id., at 355.\n   In this case, the State has conceded that it violated the\nSixth Amendment as interpreted in Massiah v. United\nStates, 377 U. S. 201, 206 (1964), when it used a jailhouse\ninformant to elicit a statement from the defendant. No\nMiranda warnings were given to the defendant,1 nor was\nhe otherwise alerted to the fact that he was speaking to a\nstate agent. Even though the jury apparently did not\ncredit the informant’s testimony, the Kansas Supreme\nCourt correctly concluded that the prosecution should not\n——————\n 1 See   Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966).\n2                    KANSAS v. VENTRIS\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nbe allowed to exploit its pretrial constitutional violation\nduring the trial itself. The Kansas Court’s judgment\nshould be affirmed.\n   This Court’s contrary holding relies on the view that a\ndefendant’s pretrial right to counsel is merely “prophylac\ntic” in nature. See ante, at 4. The majority argues that\nany violation of this prophylactic right occurs solely at the\ntime the State subjects a counseled defendant to an un\ncounseled interrogation, not when the fruits of the encoun\nter are used against the defendant at trial. Ante, at 5.\nThis reasoning is deeply flawed.\n   The pretrial right to counsel is not ancillary to, or of\nlesser importance than, the right to rely on counsel at\ntrial. The Sixth Amendment grants the right to counsel\n“[i]n all criminal prosecutions,” and we have long recog\nnized that the right applies in periods before trial com\nmences, see United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 224\n(1967). We have never endorsed the notion that the pre\ntrial right to counsel stands at the periphery of the Sixth\nAmendment. To the contrary, we have explained that the\npretrial period is “perhaps the most critical period of the\nproceedings” during which a defendant “requires the\nguiding hand of counsel.” Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S.\n45, 57, 69 (1932); see Maine v. Moulton, 474 U. S. 159, 176\n(1985) (recognizing the defendant’s “right to rely on coun\nsel as a ‘medium’ between him and the State” in all critical\nstages of prosecution). Placing the prophylactic label on a\ncore Sixth Amendment right mischaracterizes the sweep\nof the constitutional guarantee.\n   Treating the State’s actions in this case as a violation of\na prophylactic right, the Court concludes that introducing\nthe illegally obtained evidence at trial does not itself\nviolate the Constitution. I strongly disagree. While the\nconstitutional breach began at the time of interrogation,\nthe State’s use of that evidence at trial compounded the\nviolation. The logic that compels the exclusion of the\n                      Cite as: 556 U.

The use of ill-gotten evidence during any\nphase of criminal prosecution does damage to the adver\nsarial process—the fairness of which the Sixth Amend\nment was designed to protect. See Strickland v. Washing\nton, 466 U. S. 668, 685 (1984); see also Adams v. United\nStates ex rel. McCann, 317 U. S. 269, 276 (1942) (“[The]\nprocedural devices rooted in experience were written into\nthe Bill of Rights not as abstract rubrics in an elegant code\nbut in order to assure fairness and justice before any\nperson could be deprived of ‘life, liberty, or property’ ”).\n   When counsel is excluded from a critical pretrial inter\naction between the defendant and the State, she may be\nunable to effectively counter the potentially devastating,\nand potentially false,2 evidence subsequently introduced at\ntrial. Inexplicably, today’s Court refuses to recognize that\nthis is a constitutional harm.3 Yet in Massiah, the Court\nforcefully explained that a defendant is “denied the basic\nprotections of the [Sixth Amendment] guarantee when\nthere [is] used against him at his trial evidence of his own\nincriminating words” that were “deliberately elicited from\n\n——————\n  2 The likelihood that evidence gathered by self-interested jailhouse\n\ninformants may be false cannot be ignored. See generally Brief for\nNational Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae.\nIndeed, by deciding to acquit respondent of felony murder, the jury\nseems to have dismissed the informant’s trial testimony as unreliable.\n  3 In the majority’s telling, “simply” having counsel whose help is “not\n\nworth much” is not a Sixth Amendment concern. Ante, at 5. Of course,\nthe Court points to no precedent for this stingy view of the Counsel\nClause, for we have never held that the Sixth Amendment only protects\na defendant from actual denials of counsel. Indeed our venerable\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel jurisprudence is built on a more\nrealistic understanding of what the Constitution guarantees. See\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984); McMann v. Richard\nson, 397 U. S. 759, 771, n. 14 (1970) (“[T]he right to counsel is the right\nto the effective assistance of counsel”).\n4                    KANSAS v.

Sadly, the majority has retreated\nfrom this robust understanding of the right to counsel.\n   Today’s decision is lamentable not only because of its\nflawed underpinnings, but also because it is another occa\nsion in which the Court has privileged the prosecution at\nthe expense of the Constitution. Permitting the State to\ncut corners in criminal proceedings taxes the legitimacy of\nthe entire criminal process. “The State’s interest in truth\nseeking is congruent with the defendant’s interest in\nrepresentation by counsel, for it is an elementary premise\nof our system of criminal justice ‘that partisan advocacy on\nboth sides of a case will best promote the ultimate objec\ntive that the guilty be convicted and the innocent go free.’ ”\nHarvey, 494 U. S., at 357 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (quot\ning United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 655 (1984)).\nAlthough the Court may not be concerned with the use of\nill-gotten evidence in derogation of the right to counsel, I\nremain convinced that such shabby tactics are intolerable\nin all cases.
