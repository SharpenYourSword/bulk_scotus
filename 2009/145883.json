BELL, WARDEN\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 07–1114. Argued December 9, 2008—Decided April 28, 2009\nAfter the State discredited petitioner Cone’s defense that he killed two\n  people while suffering from acute psychosis caused by drug addiction,\n  he was convicted and sentenced to death. The Tennessee Supreme\n  Court affirmed on direct appeal and the state courts denied postcon\n  viction relief. Later, in a second petition for state postconviction re\n  lief, Cone raised the claim that the State had violated Brady v. Mary\n  land, 373 U. S. 83, by suppressing witness statements and police\n  reports that would have corroborated his insanity defense and bol\n  stered his case in mitigation of the death penalty. The postconviction\n  court denied him a hearing on the ground that the Brady claim had\n  been previously determined, either on direct appeal or in earlier col\n  lateral proceedings. The State Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed.\n  Cone then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal Dis\n  trict Court. That Court denied relief, holding the Brady claim proce\n  durally barred because the state courts’ disposition rested on ade\n  quate and independent state grounds: Cone had waived it by failing\n  to present his claim in state court. Even if he had not defaulted the\n  claim, ruled the court, it would fail on its merits because none of the\n  withheld evidence would have cast doubt on his guilt. The Sixth Cir\n  cuit agreed with the latter conclusion, but considered itself barred\n  from reaching the claim’s merits because the state courts had ruled\n  the claim previously determined or waived under state law.\nHeld:\n    1. The state courts’ rejection of Cone’s Brady claim does not rest on\n a ground that bars federal review. Neither of the State’s asserted\n justifications for such a bar—that the claim was decided by the State\n Supreme Court on direct review or that Cone had waived it by never\n properly raising it in state court—provides an independent and ade\n2                             CONE v. BELL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    quate state ground for denying review of Cone’s federal claim. The\n    state postconviction court’s denial of the Brady claim on the ground it\n    had been previously determined in state court rested on a false prem\n    ise: Cone had not presented the claim in earlier proceedings and, con\n    sequently, the state courts had not passed on it. The Sixth Circuit’s\n    rejection of the claim as procedurally defaulted because it had been\n    twice presented to the Tennessee courts was thus erroneous. Also\n    unpersuasive is the State’s alternative argument that federal review\n    is barred because the Brady claim was properly dismissed by the\n    state postconviction courts as waived. Those courts held only that\n    the claim had been previously determined, and this Court will not\n    second-guess their judgment. Because the claim was properly pre\n    served and exhausted in state court, it is not defaulted. Pp. 15–19.\n       2. The lower federal courts failed to adequately consider whether\n    the withheld documents were material to Cone’s sentence. Both the\n    quantity and quality of the suppressed evidence lend support to\n    Cone’s trial position that he habitually used excessive amounts of\n    drugs, that his addiction affected his behavior during the murders,\n    and that the State’s contrary arguments were false and misleading.\n    Nevertheless, even when viewed in the light most favorable to Cone,\n    the evidence does not sustain his insanity defense: His behavior be\n    fore, during, and after the crimes was inconsistent with the conten\n    tion that he lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the\n    wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform it to the requirements of\n    law. Because the likelihood that the suppressed evidence would have\n    affected the jury’s verdict on the insanity issue is remote, the Sixth\n    Circuit did not err by denying habeas relief on the ground that such\n    evidence was immaterial to the jury’s guilt finding. The same cannot\n    be said of that court’s summary treatment of Cone’s claim that the\n    suppressed evidence would have influenced the jury’s sentencing rec\n    ommendation. Because the suppressed evidence might have been\n    material to the jury’s assessment of the proper punishment, a full re\n    view of that evidence and its effect on the sentencing verdict is war\n    ranted.

RICKY \n\n               BELL, WARDEN\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [April 28, 2009] \n\n\n  JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The right to a fair trial, guaranteed to state criminal\ndefendants by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, imposes on States certain duties consistent\nwith their sovereign obligation to ensure “that ‘justice\nshall be done’ ” in all criminal prosecutions. United States\nv. Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 111 (1976) (quoting Berger v.\nUnited States, 295 U. S. 78, 88 (1935)). In Brady v. Mary\nland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), we held that when a State sup\npresses evidence favorable to an accused that is material\nto guilt or to punishment, the State violates the defen\ndant’s right to due process, “irrespective of the good faith\nor bad faith of the prosecution.” Id., at 87.\n  In this case, Gary Cone, a Vietnam veteran sentenced to\ndeath, contends that the State of Tennessee violated his\nright to due process by suppressing witness statements\nand police reports that would have corroborated his trial\ndefense and bolstered his case in mitigation of the death\npenalty. At his trial in 1982, Cone asserted an insanity\ndefense, contending that he had killed two people while\nsuffering from acute amphetamine psychosis, a disorder\n2                      CONE v. BELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncaused by drug addiction. The State of Tennessee discred\nited that defense, alleging that Cone’s drug addiction was\n“baloney.” Ten years later, Cone learned that the State\nhad suppressed evidence supporting his claim of drug\naddiction.\n   Cone presented his new evidence to the state courts in a\npetition for postconviction relief, but the Tennessee courts\ndenied him a hearing on the ground that his Brady claim\nhad been “previously determined,” either on direct appeal\nfrom his conviction or in earlier collateral proceedings. On\napplication for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28\nU. S. C. §2254, the Federal District Court concluded that\nthe state courts’ disposition rested on an adequate and\nindependent state ground that barred further review in\nfederal court, and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Cir\ncuit agreed. Doubt concerning the correctness of that\nholding, coupled with conflicting decisions from other\nCourts of Appeals, prompted our grant of certiorari.\n   After a complete review of the trial and postconviction\nproceedings, we conclude that the Tennessee courts’ rejec\ntion of petitioner’s Brady claim does not rest on a ground\nthat bars federal review. Furthermore, although the\nDistrict Court and the Court of Appeals passed briefly on\nthe merits of Cone’s claim, neither court distinguished the\nmateriality of the suppressed evidence with respect to\nCone’s guilt from the materiality of the evidence with\nrespect to his punishment. While we agree that the with\nheld documents were not material to the question whether\nCone committed murder with the requisite mental state,\nthe lower courts failed to adequately consider whether\nthat same evidence was material to Cone’s sentence.\nTherefore, we vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals\nand remand the case to the District Court to determine in\nthe first instance whether there is a reasonable probability\nthat the withheld evidence would have altered at least one\njuror’s assessment of the appropriate penalty for Cone’s\n                    Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncrimes.\n                             I\n  On the afternoon of Saturday, August 10, 1980, Cone\nrobbed a jewelry store in downtown Memphis, Tennessee.\nFleeing the scene by car, he led police on a high-speed\nchase into a residential neighborhood. Once there, he\nabandoned his vehicle and shot a police officer.1 When a\nbystander tried to impede his escape, Cone shot him, too,\nbefore escaping on foot.\n  A short time later, Cone tried to hijack a nearby car.\nWhen that attempt failed (because the driver refused to\nsurrender his keys), Cone tried to shoot the driver and a\nhovering police helicopter before realizing he had run out\nof ammunition. He then fled the scene. Although police\nconducted a thorough search, Cone was nowhere to be\nfound.\n  Early the next morning, Cone reappeared in the same\nneighborhood at the door of an elderly woman. He asked\nto use her telephone, and when she refused, he drew a\ngun. Before he was able to gain entry, the woman\nslammed the door and called the police. By the time offi\ncers arrived, however, Cone had once again disappeared.\n  That afternoon, Cone gained entry to the home of 93\nyear-old Shipley Todd and his wife, 79-year-old Cleopatra\nTodd. Cone beat the couple to death with a blunt instru\nment and ransacked the first floor of their home. Later,\nhe shaved his beard and escaped to the airport without\nbeing caught. Cone then traveled to Florida, where he\nwas arrested several days later after robbing a drugstore\nin Pompano Beach.\n  A Tennessee grand jury charged Cone with two counts\n——————\n  1 From  the abandoned vehicle, police recovered stolen jewelry, large\nquantities of illegal and prescription drugs, and approximately $2,400\nin cash. Much of the cash was later connected to a grocery store rob\nbery that had occurred on the previous day.\n4                      CONE v. BELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof first-degree murder, two counts of murder in the perpe\ntration of a burglary, three counts of assault with intent to\nmurder, and one count of robbery by use of deadly force.\nAt his jury trial in 1982, Cone did not challenge the over\nwhelming physical and testimonial evidence supporting\nthe charges against him. His sole defense was that he was\nnot guilty by reason of insanity.\n  Cone’s counsel portrayed his client as suffering from\nsevere drug addiction attributable to trauma Cone had\nexperienced in Vietnam. Counsel argued that Cone had\ncommitted his crimes while suffering from chronic am\nphetamine psychosis, a disorder brought about by his drug\nabuse. That defense was supported by the testimony of\nthree witnesses. First was Cone’s mother, who described\nher son as an honorably discharged Vietnam veteran who\nhad changed following his return from service. She re\ncalled Cone describing “how terrible” it had been to handle\nthe bodies of dead soldiers, and she explained that Cone\nslept restlessly and sometimes “holler[ed]” in his sleep.\nTr. 1643–1645 (Apr. 20, 1982). She also described one\noccasion, following Cone’s return from service, when a\npackage was shipped to him that contained marijuana.\nBefore the war, she asserted, Cone had not used drugs of\nany kind.\n  Two expert witnesses testified on Cone’s behalf. Mat\nthew Jaremko, a clinical psychologist, testified that Cone\nsuffered from substance abuse and posttraumatic stress\ndisorders related to his military service in Vietnam. Ja\nremko testified that Cone had expressed remorse for the\nmurders, and he opined that Cone’s mental disorder ren\ndered him substantially incapable of conforming his con\nduct to the law. Jonathan Lipman, a neuropharmacolo\ngist, recounted at length Cone’s history of illicit drug use,\nwhich began after Cone joined the Army and escalated to\nthe point where Cone was consuming “rather horrific”\nquantities of drugs daily. App. 100. According to Lipman,\n                    Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                  5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nCone’s drug abuse had led to chronic amphetamine psy\nchosis, a disorder manifested through hallucinations and\nongoing paranoia that prevented Cone from obeying the\nlaw and appreciating the wrongfulness of his actions.\n   In rebutting Cone’s insanity defense the State’s strategy\nthroughout trial was to present Cone as a calculating,\nintelligent criminal who was fully in control of his deci\nsions and actions at the time of the crimes. A key compo\nnent of that strategy involved discrediting Cone’s claims of\ndrug use.2 Through cross-examination, the State estab\nlished that both defense experts’ opinions were based\nsolely on Cone’s representations to them about his drug\nuse rather than on any independently corroborated\nsources, such as medical records or interviews with family\nor friends. The prosecution also adduced expert and lay\ntestimony to establish that Cone was not addicted to drugs\nand had acted rationally and intentionally before, during,\nand after the Todd murders.\n   Particularly damaging to Cone’s defense was the testi\nmony of rebuttal witness Ilene Blankman, who had spent\ntime with Cone several months before the murders and at\nwhose home Cone had stayed in the days leading up to his\narrest in Florida. Blankman admitted to being a former\nheroin addict but testified that she no longer used drugs\nand tried to stay away from people who did. She testified\nthat she had never seen Cone use drugs, had never ob\nserved track marks on his body, and had never seen him\nexhibit signs of paranoia.\n   Emphasizing the State’s position with respect to Cone’s\n——————\n  2 The State also cast doubt on Cone’s defense by eliciting testimony\n\nthat Cone had enrolled in college following his return from Vietnam\nand had graduated with high honors. Later, after serving time in\nprison for an armed robbery, Cone gained admission to the University\nof Arkansas Law School. The State suggested that Cone’s academic\nsuccess provided further proof that he was not impaired following his\nreturn from war.\n6                           CONE v. BELL\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nalleged addiction, the prosecutor told the jury during\nclosing argument, “[Y]ou’re not dealing with a crazy per\nson, an insane man. A man . . . out of his mind. You’re\ndealing, I submit to you, with a premeditated, cool, delib\nerate—and even cowardly, really—murderer.” Tr. 2084\n(Apr. 22, 1982). Pointing to the quantity of drugs found in\nCone’s car, the prosecutor suggested that far from being a\ndrug addict, Cone was actually a drug dealer. The prose\ncutor argued, “I’m not trying to be absurd, but he says he’s\na drug addict. I say baloney. He’s a drug seller. Doesn’t\nthe proof show that?” Id., at 107.3\n   The jury rejected Cone’s insanity defense and found him\nguilty on all counts. At the penalty hearing, the prosecu\ntion asked the jury to find that Cone’s crime met the crite\nria for four different statutory aggravating factors, any\none of which would render him eligible for a capital sen\ntence.4 Cone’s counsel called no witnesses but instead\nrested on the evidence adduced during the guilt phase\nproceedings. Acknowledging that the prosecution’s ex\nperts had disputed the existence of Cone’s alleged mental\ndisorder, counsel nevertheless urged the jury to consider\nCone’s drug addiction when weighing the aggravating and\n——————\n  3 In his closing rebuttal argument, the prosecutor continued to press\n\nthe point, asserting: “There aren’t any charges for drug sales, but that\ndoesn’t mean that you can’t look and question in deciding whether or\nnot this man was, in fact, a drug user, or why he had those drugs. Did\nhe just have those drugs, or did he have those drugs and thousands of\ndollars in that car? Among those drugs are there only the drugs he\nused? How do we know if he used drugs? The only thing that we ever\nhad that he used drugs, period, is the fact that those drugs were in the\ncar and what he told people. What he told people. But according to\neven what he told people, there are drugs in there he didn’t even use.”\nTr. 2068 (Apr. 22, 1982).\n  4 The jury could impose a capital sentence only if it unanimously\n\ndetermined that one or more statutory aggravating circumstances had\nbeen proved by the State beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the\nmitigating circumstances of the case did not outweigh any statutory\naggravating factors.

Among those was a claim\nthat the prosecution violated state law by failing to dis\nclose a tape-recorded statement and police reports relating\nto several trial witnesses. See App. 114–117. The Ten\nnessee Supreme Court rejected each of Cone’s claims, and\naffirmed his conviction and sentence. State v. Cone, 665\nS. W. 2d 87 (1984).7 Cone then filed a petition for postcon\n——————\n   5 As defense counsel emphasized to the jury, one of the statutory miti\n\ngating factors it was required to consider was whether “[t]he capacity of\nthe defendant to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to\nconform his conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially\nimpaired as a result of mental disease or defect or intoxication which\nwas insufficient to establish a defense to the crime but which substan\ntially affected his judgment.” §39–2404(j)(8).\n   6 Specifically, the jury found Cone had committed one or more prior\n\nfelonies involving the use or threat of violence, see §39–2404(i)(2); the\nmurders had been committed for the purpose of avoiding, interfering\nwith, or preventing Cone’s lawful arrest or prosecution, see §39–\n2404(i)(6); the murders were especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel in\nthat they involved torture and depravity of mind, see §39–2404(i)(5);\nand Cone had knowingly created a risk of death to two or more persons,\nother than the victim murdered, during his act of murder, see §39–\n2404(i)(3). The Tennessee Supreme Court later observed that by\nfinding Cone guilty of murder in the first degree during the perpetra\ntion of a burglary, the jury implicitly found the existence of an addi\ntional statutory aggravating factor: that the murders occurred while\nCone was committing a burglary, §39–2404(i)(7). State v. Cone, 665\nS. W. 2d 87, 94 (1984).\n   7 In summarizing the trial proceedings the Tennessee Supreme Court\n\nobserved: “The only defense interposed on [Cone’s] behalf was that of\ninsanity, or lack of mental capacity, due to drug abuse and to stress\narising out of his previous service in the Vietnamese war, some eleven\nyears prior to the events involved in this case. This proved to be a\ntenuous defense, at best, since neither of the expert witnesses who\n8                            CONE v.

Cone\nv. State, 747 S. W. 2d 353.\n   In 1989, Cone, acting pro se, filed a second petition for\npostconviction relief, raising myriad claims of error.\nAmong these was a claim that the State had failed to\ndisclose evidence in violation of his rights under the\nUnited States Constitution. At the State’s behest, the\npostconviction court summarily denied the petition, con\ncluding that all the claims raised in it had either been\n“previously determined” or “waived.” Order Dismissing\nPetition for Post-Conviction Relief in Cone v. State, No. P–\n06874 (Crim. Ct. Shelby Cty., Tenn., Jan. 2, 1990).8 At\nthat time, the court did not specify which claims fell into\nwhich category.\n   Cone appealed the denial of his petition to the Tennes\nsee Court of Criminal Appeals, asserting that the postcon\nviction court had erred by dismissing 13 claims—his\n——————\ntestified on his behalf had ever seen or heard of him until a few weeks\nprior to the trial.

Code Ann. §40–30–105 (1982); see also\n§40–30–102. Any hearing on a petition for postconviction relief was\nlimited, however, to claims that had not been “waived or previously\ndetermined.” See §40–30–111. A ground for relief was “previously\ndetermined” if “a court of competent jurisdiction ha[d] ruled on the\nmerits [of the claim] after a full and fair hearing.” §40–30–112(a). The\nclaim was waived “if the petitioner knowingly and understandingly\nfailed to present it for determination in any proceeding before a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction in which the ground could have been presented.”\n§40–30–112(b)(1).\n                    Cite as: 556 U.

Id., at\n24.9 The court agreed and remanded the case for further\nproceedings.\n  On remand counsel was appointed and an amended\npetition was filed. The State once again urged the post\nconviction court to dismiss Cone’s petition. Apparently\nconflating the state-law disclosure claim Cone had raised\non direct appeal with his newly filed Brady claim, the\nState represented that the Tennessee Supreme Court had\nalready decided the Brady issue and that Cone was there\nfore barred from relitigating it. See App. 15–16.\n  While that petition remained pending before the post\nconviction court, the Tennessee Court of Appeals held for\nthe first time that the State’s Public Records Act allowed a\ncriminal defendant to review the prosecutor’s file in his\ncase.

The file also contained a police report describing\nCone’s arrest in Florida following the murders. In that\nreport, a police officer described Cone looking around “in a\nfrenzied manner,” and “walking in [an] agitated manner”\nprior to his apprehension. Id., at 53. Multiple police\nbulletins describing Cone as a “drug user” and a “heavy\ndrug user” were also among the undisclosed evidence. See\nid., at 55–59.\n   With the newly discovered evidence in hand, Cone\namended his postconviction petition once again in October\n1993, expanding his Brady claim to allege more specifi\ncally that the State had withheld exculpatory evidence\ndemonstrating that he “did in fact suffer drug problems\nand/or drug withdrawal or psychosis both at the time of\nthe offense and in the past.” App. at 20. Cone pointed to\nspecific examples of evidence that had been withheld,\nalleging the evidence was “exculpatory to both the jury’s\ndetermination of petitioner’s guilt and its consideration of\nthe proper sentence,” and that there was “a reasonable\nprobability that, had the evidence not been withheld, the\njurors would not have convicted [him] and would not have\nsentenced him to death.” Id., at 20–21.10 In a lengthy\naffidavit submitted with his amended petition, Cone ex\nplained that he had not raised his Brady claim in earlier\nproceedings because the facts underlying it “ha[d] been\nrevealed through disclosure of the State’s files, which\noccurred after the first post-conviction proceeding.” App.\n18.\n   After denying Cone’s request for an evidentiary hearing,\n——————\n  10 As examples of evidence that had been withheld, Cone pointed to\n\n“statements of Charles and Debbie Slaughter, statements of Sue Cone,\nstatements of Lucille Tuech, statements of Herschel Dalton, and\npatrolman Collins” and “statements contained in official police reports.”\nApp. 20.\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

Many of the claims were\ndismissed on the ground that they had been waived by\nCone’s failure to raise them in earlier proceedings; how\never, consistent with the position urged by the State, the\ncourt dismissed many others, including the Brady claim,\nas mere “re-statements of previous grounds heretofore\ndetermined and denied by the Tennessee Supreme Court\nupon Direct Appeal or the Court of Criminal Appeals upon\nthe First Petition.” App. 22.\n  Noting that “the findings of the trial court in post\nconviction hearings are conclusive on appeal unless the\nevidence preponderates against the judgment,” the Ten\nnessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. Cone v. State,\n927 S. W. 2d 579, 581–582 (1995). The court concluded\nthat Cone had “failed to rebut the presumption of waiver\nas to all claims raised in his second petition for post\nconviction relief which had not been previously deter\nmined.” Id., at 582 (emphasis added). Cone unsuccess\nfully petitioned for review in the Tennessee Supreme\nCourt, and we denied certiorari. Cone v. Tennessee, 519\nU. S. 934 (1996).\n                               III\n    In 1997, Cone filed a petition for a federal writ of habeas\ncorpus. Without disclosing to the District Court the con\ntrary position it had taken in the state-court proceedings,\nthe State acknowledged that Cone’s Brady claim had not\nbeen raised prior to the filing of his second postconviction\npetition. However, wrenching out of context the state\nappellate court’s holding that Cone had “waived ‘all claims\n. . . which had not been previously determined,’ ” the State\nnow asserted the Brady claim had been waived. App. 39\n(quoting Cone, 927 S. W. 2d, at 581–582).\n    In May 1998, the District Court denied Cone’s request\nfor an evidentiary hearing on his Brady claim. Lamenting\n12                      CONE v. BELL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat its consideration of Cone’s claims had been “made\nmore difficult” by the parties’ failure to articulate the state\nprocedural rules under which each of Cone’s claims had\nallegedly been defaulted, App. to Pet. for Cert. 98a, the\nDistrict Court nevertheless held that the Brady claim was\nprocedurally barred. After parsing the claim into 11\nseparate subclaims based on 11 pieces of withheld evi\ndence identified in the habeas petition, the District Court\nconcluded that Cone had waived each subclaim by failing\nto present or adequately develop it in state court. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 112a–113a. Moreover, the court concluded\nthat even if Cone had not defaulted his Brady claim, it\nwould fail on its merits because none of the withheld\nevidence would have cast doubt on Cone’s guilt. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 116a–119a. Throughout its opinion the\nDistrict Court repeatedly referenced factual allegations\ncontained in early versions of Cone’s second petition for\npostconviction relief rather than the amended version of\nthe petition upon which the state court’s decision had\nrested. See, e.g., id., at 112a.\n   After the District Court dismissed the remainder of\nCone’s federal claims, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth\nCircuit granted him permission to appeal several issues,\nincluding the alleged suppression of Brady material.\nBefore the Court of Appeals, the State shifted its proce\ndural default argument once more, this time contending\nthat Cone had “simply never raised” his Brady claim in\nthe state court because he failed to make adequate factual\nallegations to support that claim in his second petition for\npostconviction relief. App. 41. Repeating the District\nCourt’s error, the State directed the Court of Appeals’\nattention to Cone’s pro se petition and to the petition\nCone’s counsel filed before he gained access to the prosecu\ntion’s case file. Id., at 41–42, and n. 7. In other words,\ninstead of citing the October 1993 amended petition on\nwhich the state court’s decision had been based and to\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Cone v. Bell,\n243 F. 3d 961, 968 (2001). The court acknowledged that\nCone had raised his Brady claim. 243 F. 3d, at 969. Nev\nertheless, the court considered itself barred from reaching\nthe merits of the claim because the Tennessee courts had\nconcluded the claim was “previously determined or waived\nunder Tenn. Code Ann. §40–30–112.” Ibid.\n   Briefly mentioning several isolated pieces of suppressed\nevidence, the court summarily concluded that even if\nCone’s Brady claim had not been defaulted, the sup\npressed evidence would not undermine confidence in the\nverdict (and hence was not Brady material) “because of\nthe overwhelming evidence of Cone’s guilt.” 243 F. 3d, at\n968. The court did not discuss whether any of the undis\nclosed evidence was material with respect to Cone’s sen\ntencing proceedings.\n   Although the Court of Appeals rejected Cone’s Brady\nclaim, it held that he was entitled to have his death sen\ntence vacated because of his counsel’s ineffective assis\ntance at sentencing. See 243 F. 3d, at 975. In 2002, this\nCourt reversed that holding after concluding that the\nTennessee courts’ rejection of Cone’s ineffective\nassistance-of-counsel claim was not “objectively unreason\nable” within the meaning of the Antiterrorism and Effec\ntive Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). See Bell v. Cone,\n535 U. S. 685, 699.\n   In 2004, following our remand, the Court of Appeals\nagain entered judgment ordering a new sentencing hear\ning, this time based on the purported invalidity of an\naggravating circumstance found by the jury. Cone v. Bell,\n359 F. 3d 785. Again we granted certiorari and reversed,\nrelying in part on the deferential standard that governs\n14                          CONE v. BELL\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nour review of state-court decisions under AEDPA. See\nBell v. Cone, 543 U. S. 447, 452–458 (2005) (per curiam).\n  Following our second remand, the Court of Appeals\nrevisited Cone’s Brady claim. This time, the court divided\nthe claim into four separate subclaims: “(1) evidence re\ngarding [Cone’s] drug use; (2) evidence that might have\nbeen useful to impeach the testimony and credibility of\nprosecution witness Sergeant Ralph Roby; (3) FBI re\nports;[11] and (4) evidence showing that prosecution wit\nness Ilene Blankman was untruthful and biased.” 492 F.\n3d 743, 753 (2007). Noting that it had previously found all\nfour subclaims to be procedurally defaulted, the court\ndeclined to reconsider its earlier decision. See ibid. (citing\nCone, 243 F. 3d, at 968–970). At the same time, the court\nreiterated that the withheld evidence “would not have\novercome the overwhelming evidence of Cone’s guilt in\ncommitting a brutal double murder and the persuasive\ntestimony that Cone was not under the influence of\ndrugs.” 492 F. 3d, at 756. Summarily discounting Cone’s\ncontention that the withheld evidence was material with\nrespect to his sentence, the court concluded that the intro\nduction of the suppressed evidence would not have altered\nthe jurors’ finding that Cone’s alleged drug use did not\n“vitiate his specific intent to murder his victims and did\nnot mitigate his culpability sufficient to avoid the death\nsentence.” Id., at 757.\n  Judge Merritt dissented. He castigated the State not\nonly for withholding documents relevant to Cone’s sole\ndefense and plea for mitigation, but also for its “falsifica\n——————\n  11 In the course of federal habeas proceedings, Cone had obtained\n\naccess to files from the Federal Bureau of Investigation where he found\nadditional previously undisclosed evidence not contained in the state\nprosecutor’s case file.

Over the dissent of seven judges, Cone’s petition for\nrehearing en banc was denied. 505 F. 3d 610 (2007).\n   We granted certiorari, 554 U. S. ___ (2008), to answer\nthe question whether a federal habeas claim is “proce\ndurally defaulted” when it is twice presented to the state\ncourts.\n                              IV\n   During the state and federal proceedings below, the\nState of Tennessee offered two different justifications for\ndenying review of the merits of Cone’s Brady claim. First,\nin connection with Cone’s amended petition for state\npostconviction relief, the State argued that the Brady\nclaim was barred because it had been decided on direct\nappeal. See App. 15–16. Then, in connection with Cone’s\nfederal habeas petition, the State argued that Cone’s claim\nwas waived because it had never been properly raised\nbefore the state courts. See id., at 39. The District Court\nand the Court of Appeals agreed that Cone’s claim was\nprocedurally barred, but for different reasons. The Dis\ntrict Court held that the claim had been waived, App. to\nPet. for Cert. 102a, while the Court of Appeals held that\nthe claim had been either waived or previously deter\nmined, Cone, 243 F. 3d, at 969. We now conclude that\nneither prior determination nor waiver provides an inde\npendent and adequate state ground for denying Cone\nreview of his federal claim.\n   It is well established that federal courts will not review\nquestions of federal law presented in a habeas petition\nwhen the state court’s decision rests upon a state-law\nground that “is independent of the federal question and\nadequate to support the judgment.” Coleman v. Thomp\nson, 501 U. S. 722, 729 (1991); Lee v. Kemna, 534 U. S.\n362, 375 (2002). In the context of federal habeas proceed\n16                      CONE v. BELL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nings, the independent and adequate state ground doctrine\nis designed to “ensur[e] that the States’ interest in correct\ning their own mistakes is respected in all federal habeas\ncases.” Coleman, 501 U. S., at 732. When a petitioner\nfails to properly raise his federal claims in state court, he\ndeprives the State of “an opportunity to address those\nclaims in the first instance” and frustrates the State’s\nability to honor his constitutional rights. Id., at 732, 748.\nTherefore, consistent with the longstanding requirement\nthat habeas petitioners must exhaust available state\nremedies before seeking relief in federal court, we have\nheld that when a petitioner fails to raise his federal claims\nin compliance with relevant state procedural rules, the\nstate court’s refusal to adjudicate the claim ordinarily\nqualifies as an independent and adequate state ground for\ndenying federal review. See id., at 731.\n   That does not mean, however, that federal habeas re\nview is barred every time a state court invokes a proce\ndural rule to limit its review of a state prisoner’s claims.\nWe have recognized that “ ‘the adequacy of state proce\ndural bars to the assertion of federal questions’ . . . is not\nwithin the State’s prerogative finally to decide; rather,\nadequacy ‘is itself a federal question.’ ” Lee, 534 U. S., at\n375 (quoting Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 415, 422\n(1965)); see also Coleman, 501 U. S., at 736 (“[F]ederal\nhabeas courts must ascertain for themselves if the peti\ntioner is in custody pursuant to a state court judgment\nthat rests on independent and adequate state grounds”).\nThe question before us now is whether federal review of\nCone’s Brady claim is procedurally barred either because\nthe claim was twice presented to the state courts or be\ncause it was waived, and thus not presented at all.\n   First, we address the contention that the repeated pres\nentation of a claim in state court bars later federal review.\nThe Tennessee postconviction court denied Cone’s Brady\nclaim after concluding it had been previously determined\n                    Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                 17\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nfollowing a full and fair hearing in state court. See Tenn.\nCode Ann. §40–30–112(a) (1982). That conclusion rested\non a false premise: Contrary to the state courts’ finding,\nCone had not presented his Brady claim in earlier pro\nceedings and, consequently, the state courts had not\npassed on it. The Sixth Circuit recognized that Cone’s\nBrady claim had not been decided on direct appeal, see\nCone, 243 F. 3d, at 969, but felt constrained by the state\ncourts’ refusal to reach the merits of that claim on post\nconviction review. The Court of Appeals concluded that\nbecause the state postconviction courts had applied a state\nprocedural law to avoid reaching the merits of Cone’s\nBrady claim, “an ‘independent and adequate’ state\nground” barred federal habeas review. 243 F. 3d, at 969.\nIn this Court the State does not defend that aspect of the\nCourt of Appeals’ holding, and rightly so.\n   When a state court declines to review the merits of a\npetitioner’s claim on the ground that it has done so al\nready, it creates no bar to federal habeas review. In Ylst\nv. Nunnemaker, 501 U. S. 797, 804, n. 3 (1991), we ob\nserved in passing that when a state court declines to\nrevisit a claim it has already adjudicated, the effect of the\nlater decision upon the availability of federal habeas is\n“nil” because “a later state decision based upon ineligibil\nity for further state review neither rests upon procedural\ndefault nor lifts a pre-existing procedural default.”12\nWhen a state court refuses to readjudicate a claim on the\nground that it has been previously determined, the court’s\n——————\n  12 With the exception of the Sixth Circuit, all Courts of Appeals to\nhave directly confronted the question both before and after Ylst, 501\nU. S. 797, have agreed that a state court’s successive rejection of a\nfederal claim does not bar federal habeas review. See, e.g., Page v.\nFrank, 343 F. 3d 901, 907 (CA7 2003); Brecheen v. Reynolds, 41 F. 3d\n1343, 1358 (CA10 1994); Bennett v. Whitley, 41 F. 3d 1581, 1582 (CA5\n1994); Silverstein v. Henderson, 706 F. 2d 361, 368 (CA2 1983). See\nalso Lambright v. Stewart, 241 F. 3d 1201, 1206 (CA9 2001).\n18                          CONE v. BELL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndecision does not indicate that the claim has been proce\ndurally defaulted. To the contrary, it provides strong\nevidence that the claim has already been given full consid\neration by the state courts and thus is ripe for federal\nadjudication. See 28 U. S. C. §2254(b)(1)(A) (permitting\nissuance of a writ of habeas corpus only after “the appli\ncant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of\nthe State”).\n  A claim is procedurally barred when it has not been\nfairly presented to the state courts for their initial consid\neration—not when the claim has been presented more\nthan once. Accordingly, insofar as the Court of Appeals\nrejected Cone’s Brady claim as procedurally defaulted\nbecause the claim had been twice presented to the Ten\nnessee courts, its decision was erroneous.\n  As an alternative (and contradictory) ground for barring\nreview of Cone’s Brady claim, the State has argued that\nCone’s claim was properly dismissed by the state postcon\nviction court on the ground it had been waived. We are\nnot persuaded. The state appellate court affirmed the\ndenial of Cone’s Brady claim on the same mistaken ground\noffered by the lower court—that the claim had been previ\nously determined.13 Contrary to the State’s assertion, the\n——————\n  13 As recounted earlier, Cone’s state postconviction petition contained\nnumerous claims of error. The state postconviction court dismissed\nsome of those claims as waived and others, including the Brady claim,\nas having been previously determined. In affirming the denial of\nCone’s petition the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals summarily\nstated that Cone had “failed to rebut the presumption of waiver as to\nall claims raised in his second petition for post-conviction relief which\nhad not been previously determined.” Cone v. State, 927 S. W. 2d 579,\n582 (1995). Pointing to that language, the State asserts that the\nTennessee Court of Criminal Appeals denied Cone’s Brady claim not\nbecause it had been previously determined, but because it was waived\nin the postconviction court proceedings. Not so. Without questioning\nthe trial court’s finding that Cone’s Brady claim had been previously\ndetermined, the Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the denial of\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    19\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nTennessee appellate court did not hold that Cone’s Brady\nclaim was waived.\n  When a state court declines to find that a claim has\nbeen waived by a petitioner’s alleged failure to comply\nwith state procedural rules, our respect for the state-court\njudgment counsels us to do the same. Although we have\nan independent duty to scrutinize the application of state\nrules that bar our review of federal claims, Lee, 534 U. S.,\nat 375, we have no concomitant duty to apply state proce\ndural bars where state courts have themselves declined to\ndo so. The Tennessee courts did not hold that Cone\nwaived his Brady claim, and we will not second-guess\ntheir judgment.14\n——————\nCone’s postconviction petition in its entirety. Nothing in that decision\nsuggests the appellate court believed the Brady claim had been waived\nin the court below.\n  Similarly, while JUSTICE ALITO’s parsing of the record persuades him\nthat Cone failed to adequately raise his Brady claim to the Tennessee\nCourt of Criminal Appeals, he does not argue that the court expressly\nheld that Cone waived the claim. A review of Cone’s opening brief\nreveals that he made a broad challenge to the postconviction court’s\ndismissal of his petition and plainly asserted that the court erred by\ndismissing claims as previously determined on direct appeal or in his\ninitial postconviction petition. See Brief for Petitioner-Appellant in No.\n02–C–01–9403–CR–00052 (Tenn. Crim. App.), pp. 7, 14. The state\nappellate court did not state or suggest that Cone had waived his Brady\nclaim. Rather, after commending the postconviction court for its\n“exemplary and meticulous treatment of the appellant’s petition,” Cone,\n927 S. W. 2d, at 581, the appellate court simply adopted without\nmodification the lower court’s findings with respect to the application of\nTenn. Code Ann. §40–30–112 to the facts of this case. The best reading\nof the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals’ decision is that it was\nbased on an approval of the postconviction court’s reasoning rather\nthan on an unmentioned failure by Cone to adequately challenge the\ndismissal of his Brady claim on appeal.\n  14 Setting aside the state courts’ mistaken belief that Cone’s Brady\n\nclaim had been previously determined, there are many reasons the\nstate courts might have rejected the State’s waiver argument. The\nrecord establishes that the suppressed documents which form the basis\nfor Cone’s claim were not available to him until the Tennessee Court of\n20                          CONE v. BELL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  The State’s procedural objections to federal review of the\nmerits of Cone’s claim have resulted in a significant delay\nin bringing this unusually protracted case to a conclusion.\nUltimately, however, they provide no obstacle to judicial\nreview. Cone properly preserved and exhausted his Brady\nclaim in the state court; therefore, it is not defaulted. We\nturn now to the merits of that claim.\n                             V\n  Although the State is obliged to “prosecute with ear\nnestness and vigor,” it “is as much [its] duty to refrain\nfrom improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful\nconviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring\nabout a just one.” Berger, 295 U. S., at 88. Accordingly,\nwe have held that when the State withholds from a crimi\nnal defendant evidence that is material to his guilt or\npunishment, it violates his right to due process of law in\nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Brady, 373\nU. S., at 87. In United States v. Bagley, 473 U. S. 667, 682\n(1985) (opinion of Blackmun, J.), we explained that evi\ndence is “material” within the meaning of Brady when\nthere is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence\nbeen disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have\nbeen different. In other words, favorable evidence is sub\nject to constitutionally mandated disclosure when it “could\nreasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a differ\n——————\nAppeals’ 1992 decision interpreting the State’s Public Records Act as\nauthorizing the disclosure of prosecutorial records. Soon after obtain\ning access to the prosecutor’s file and discovering within it documents\nthat had not been disclosed prior to trial, Cone amended his petition for\npostconviction relief, adding detailed allegations regarding the sup\npressed evidence recovered from the file, along with an affidavit ex\nplaining the reason why his claim had not been filed sooner. See App.\n13, 18. The State did not oppose the amendment of Cone’s petition on\nthe ground that it was untimely, and it appears undisputed that there\nwould have been no basis under state law for doing so.

The sup\npressed evidence includes statements by witnesses ac\nknowledging that Cone appeared to be “drunk or high,”\nApp. 49, “acted real weird,” ibid., and “looked wild eyed,”\nid., at 50, in the two days preceding the murders.16 It also\nincludes documents that could have been used to impeach\n——————\n  15 Although the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as\n\ninterpreted by Brady, only mandates the disclosure of material evi\ndence, the obligation to disclose evidence favorable to the defense may\narise more broadly under a prosecutor’s ethical or statutory obligations.\nSee Kyles, 514 U. S., at 437 (“[T]he rule in Bagley (and, hence, in\nBrady) requires less of the prosecution than the ABA Standards for\nCriminal Justice Prosecution Function and Defense Function 3–3.11(a)\n(3d ed. 1993)”). See also ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct\n3.8(d) (2008) (“The prosecutor in a criminal case shall” “make timely\ndisclosure to the defense of all evidence or information known to the\nprosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the\noffense, and, in connection with sentencing, disclose to the defense and\nto the tribunal all unprivileged mitigating information known to the\nprosecutor, except when the prosecutor is relieved of this responsibility\nby a protective order of the tribunal”). As we have often observed, the\nprudent prosecutor will err on the side of transparency, resolving\ndoubtful questions in favor of disclosure. See Kyles, 514 U. S., at 439;\nUnited States v. Bagley, 473 U. S. 667, 711, n. 4 (1985) (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting); United States v. Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 108 (1976).\n  16 The State contends that the statements were made by witnesses\n\nwho observed Cone during and immediately after he committed robber\nies; therefore, it is not surprising that Cone appeared less than “se\nrene.” See Brief for Respondent 46. Although a jury would have been\nfree to infer that Cone’s behavior was attributable to his criminal\nactivity, the evidence is also consistent with Cone’s assertion that he\nwas suffering from chronic amphetamine psychosis at the time of the\ncrimes.\n22                          CONE v. BELL\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwitnesses whose trial testimony cast doubt on Cone’s drug\naddiction. For example, Memphis police officer Ralph\nRoby testified at trial that Cone had no needle marks on\nhis body when he was arrested—an observation that\nbolstered the State’s argument that Cone was not a drug\nuser. The suppressed evidence reveals, however, that\nRoby authorized multiple teletypes to law enforcement\nagencies in the days following the murders in which he\ndescribed Cone as a “drug user” and a “heavy drug user.”\nSee id., at 55–58.17 A suppressed statement made by the\nchief of police of Cone’s hometown also describes Cone as a\nserious drug user. See Cone, 243 F. 3d, at 968. And un\ndisclosed notes of a police interview with Ilene Blankman\nconducted several days after the murders reveal discrep\nancies between her initial statement and her trial testi\nmony relevant to Cone’s alleged drug use. App. 72–73. In\nsum, both the quantity and the quality of the suppressed\nevidence lends support to Cone’s position at trial that he\nhabitually used excessive amounts of drugs, that his ad\ndiction affected his behavior during his crime spree, and\nthat the State’s arguments to the contrary were false and\nmisleading.\n  Thus, the federal question that must be decided is\nwhether the suppression of that probative evidence de\nprived Cone of his right to a fair trial. See Agurs, 427\n——————\n   17 As the dissent points out, Roby did not testify directly that Cone\n\nwas not a drug user and FBI Agent Eugene Flynn testified that, at the\ntime of Cone’s arrest in Pompano Beach, Cone reported that he had\nused cocaine, Dilaudid, and Demerol and was suffering from “slight\nwithdrawal symptoms.” See post, at 7, 11. See also Tr. 1916, 1920\n(Apr. 22, 1982). It is important to note, however, that neither Flynn\nnor Roby corroborated Cone’s account of alleged drug use. Taken in\ncontext, Roby’s statement that he had not observed any needle marks\non Cone’s body invited the jury to infer that Cone’s self-reported drug\nuse was either minimal or contrived. See id., at 1939. Therefore,\nalthough the suppressed evidence does not directly contradict Roby’s\ntrial testimony, it does place it in a different light.\n                    Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                  23\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S., at 108. Because the Tennessee courts did not reach\nthe merits of Cone’s Brady claim, federal habeas review is\nnot subject to the deferential standard that applies under\nAEDPA to “any claim that was adjudicated on the merits\nin State court proceedings.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d). Instead,\nthe claim is reviewed de novo. See, e.g., Rompilla v.\nBeard, 545 U. S. 374, 390 (2005) (de novo review where\nstate courts did not reach prejudice prong under Strick\nland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984)); Wiggins v.\nSmith, 539 U. S. 510, 534 (2003) (same).\n   Contending that the Federal District Court and Court of\nAppeals adequately and correctly resolved the merits of\nthat claim, the State urges us to affirm the Sixth Circuit’s\ndenial of habeas relief. In assessing the materiality of the\nevidence suppressed by the State, the Court of Appeals\nsuggested that two facts outweighed the potential force of\nthe suppressed evidence. First, the evidence of Cone’s\nguilt was overwhelming. Second, the evidence of Cone’s\ndrug use was cumulative because the jury had heard\nevidence of Cone’s alleged addiction from witnesses and\nfrom officers who interviewed Cone and recovered drugs\nfrom his vehicle.18 The Court of Appeals did not thor\noughly review the suppressed evidence or consider what\nits cumulative effect on the jury would have been. More\nover, in concluding that the suppressed evidence was not\nmaterial within the meaning of Brady, the court did not\ndistinguish between the materiality of the evidence with\nrespect to guilt and the materiality of the evidence with\nrespect to punishment—an omission we find significant.\n   Evidence that is material to guilt will often be material\n——————\n  18 In pointing to the trial evidence of Cone’s drug use, the Court of\n\nAppeals made no mention of the fact that the State had discredited the\ntestimony of Cone’s experts on the ground that no independent evi\ndence corroborated Cone’s alleged addiction and that the State had\nargued that the drugs in Cone’s car were intended for resale, rather\nthan personal use.\n24                     CONE v. BELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfor sentencing purposes as well; the converse is not always\ntrue, however, as Brady itself demonstrates. In our semi\nnal case on the disclosure of prosecutorial evidence, defen\ndant John Brady was indicted for robbery and capital\nmurder. At trial, Brady took the stand and confessed to\nrobbing the victim and being present at the murder but\ntestified that his accomplice had actually strangled the\nvictim. Brady v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1771820\"><a href=\"/opinion/1771820/state-v-present/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span> <span class=\"page\">422</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 425, 174 A. 2d 167,\n168 (1961). After Brady was convicted and sentenced to\ndeath he discovered that the State had suppressed the\nconfession of his accomplice, which included incriminating\nstatements consistent with Brady’s version of events. Id.,\nat 426, 174 A. 2d, at 169. The Maryland Court of Appeals\nconcluded that Brady’s due process rights were violated by\nthe suppression of the accomplice’s confession but declined\nto order a new trial on guilt. Observing that nothing in\nthe accomplice’s confession “could have reduced . . .\nBrady’s offense below murder in the first degree,” the\nstate court ordered a new trial on the question of punish\nment only. Id., at 430, 174 A. 2d, at 171. We granted\ncertiorari and affirmed, rejecting Brady’s contention that\nthe state court’s limited remand violated his constitutional\nrights. 373 U. S., at 88.\n   As in Brady, the distinction between the materiality of\nthe suppressed evidence with respect to guilt and punish\nment is significant in this case. During the guilt phase of\nCone’s trial, the only dispute was whether Cone was “sane\nunder the law,” Tr. 2040 (Apr. 22, 1982), as his counsel\ndescribed the issue, or “criminally responsible” for his\nconduct, App. 110, as the prosecutor argued. Under Ten\nnessee law, Cone could not be held criminally responsible\nfor the murders if, “at the time of [his] conduct as a result\nof mental disease or defect he lack[ed] substantial capacity\neither to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to\nconform his conduct to the requirements of law.” Graham\nv. State, 547 S. W. 2d 531, 543 (Tenn. 1977). Although we\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          25\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntake exception to the Court of Appeals’ failure to assess\nthe effect of the suppressed evidence “collectively” rather\nthan “item by item,” see Kyles, 514 U. S., at 436, we never\ntheless agree that even when viewed in the light most\nfavorable to Cone, the evidence falls short of being suffi\ncient to sustain his insanity defense.\n   Cone’s experts testified that his drug addiction and\nposttraumatic stress disorder originated during his service\nin Vietnam, more than 13 years before the Todds were\nmurdered. During those years, despite Cone’s drug use\nand mental disorder, he managed to successfully complete\nhis education, travel, and (when not incarcerated) function\nin civil society. The suppressed evidence may have\nstrengthened the inference that Cone was on drugs or\nsuffering from withdrawal at the time of the murders, but\nhis behavior before, during, and after the crimes was\ninconsistent with the contention that he lacked substan\ntial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his\nconduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of\nlaw. See Graham, 547 S. W. 2d, at 543. The likelihood\nthat the suppressed evidence would have affected the\njury’s verdict on the issue of insanity is therefore remote.\nAccordingly, we conclude that the Sixth Circuit did not err\nby denying habeas relief on the ground that the sup\npressed evidence was immaterial to the jury’s finding of\nguilt.\n   The same cannot be said of the Court of Appeals’ sum\nmary treatment of Cone’s claim that the suppressed evi\ndence influenced the jury’s sentencing recommendation.\nThere is a critical difference between the high standard\nCone was required to satisfy to establish insanity as a\nmatter of Tennessee law and the far lesser standard that a\ndefendant must satisfy to qualify evidence as mitigating in\na penalty hearing in a capital case. See Bell, 535 U. S., at\n712 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (“[T]here is a vast difference\nbetween insanity—which the defense utterly failed to\n26                         CONE v. BELL\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nprove—and the possible mitigating effect of drug addiction\nincurred as a result of honorable service in the military”).\nAs defense counsel emphasized in his brief opening state\nment during penalty phase proceedings, the jury was\nstatutorily required to consider whether Cone’s “capacity\n. . . to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to\nconform his conduct to the requirements of the law was\nsubstantially impaired as a result of mental disease or\ndefect or intoxication which was insufficient to establish a\ndefense to the crime but which substantially affected his\njudgment.” Tenn. Code Ann. §39–2–203(j)(8) (1982). It is\npossible that the suppressed evidence, viewed cumula\ntively, may have persuaded the jury that Cone had a far\nmore serious drug problem than the prosecution was\nprepared to acknowledge, and that Cone’s drug use played\na mitigating, though not exculpating, role in the crimes he\ncommitted.19 The evidence might also have rebutted the\nState’s suggestion that Cone had manipulated his expert\nwitnesses into falsely believing he was a drug addict when\nin fact he did not struggle with substance abuse.\n    Neither the Court of Appeals nor the District Court fully\nconsidered whether the suppressed evidence might have\npersuaded one or more jurors that Cone’s drug addiction—\nespecially if attributable to honorable service of his coun\ntry in Vietnam—was sufficiently serious to justify a deci\nsion to imprison him for life rather than sentence him to\ndeath. Because the evidence suppressed at Cone’s trial\n\n——————\n  19 We agree with the dissent that the standard to be applied by the\n\nDistrict Court in evaluating the merits of Cone’s Brady claim on re\nmand is whether there is a reasonable probability that, had the sup\npressed evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would\nhave been different. See post, at 5. Because neither the District Court\nnor the Court of Appeals considered the merits of Cone’s claim with\nrespect to the effect of the withheld evidence on his sentence, it is\nappropriate for the District Court, rather than this Court, to do so in\nthe first instance.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Today we hold that the Tennessee\ncourts’ procedural rejection of Cone’s Brady claim does not\nbar federal habeas review of the merits of that claim.\nAlthough we conclude that the suppressed evidence was\nnot material to Cone’s conviction for first-degree murder,\nthe lower courts erred in failing to assess the cumulative\neffect of the suppressed evidence with respect to Cone’s\ncapital sentence. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court\nof Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded to the\nDistrict Court with instructions to give full consideration\nto the merits of Cone’s Brady claim.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

When issues under Brady v.\nMaryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), are presented on federal\nhabeas, they usually have been previously addressed in\nstate proceedings. Federal review is accordingly sharply\nlimited by established principles of deference: If the claim\nhas been waived under state rules, that waiver typically\nprecludes federal review. If the claim has been decided in\nthe state system, federal review is restricted in light of the\nstate court’s legal and factual conclusions. The unique\nprocedural posture of this case presents a Brady claim\nneither barred under state rules for failure to raise it nor\ndecided in the state system.\n  When it comes to that claim, the Court specifies that the\nappropriate legal standard is the one we set forth in Kyles\nv. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 435 (1995) (whether “the favor\nable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole\ncase in such a different light as to undermine confidence\nin the verdict”). See ante, at 20–21, 26, n. 19. I do not\nunderstand the majority to depart from that standard, and\nthe majority certainly does not purport to do so.\n  That leaves only application of the accepted legal stan\ndard to the particular facts. It is highly unusual for this\nCourt to engage in such an enterprise, see Kyles, supra, at\n2                        CONE v. BELL\n\n              ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\n\n458 (SCALIA, J., dissenting), and the Court’s asserted basis\nfor doing so in this case is dubious, see post, at 1, 4–5\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting).\n  In any event, the Court’s review of the facts does not\nlead it to conclude that Cone is entitled to relief—only that\nthe courts below did not adequately consider his claim\nwith respect to sentencing. See ante, at 26 (“Neither the\nCourt of Appeals nor the District Court fully considered\nwhether the suppressed evidence” undermines confidence\nin Cone’s sentence). The Court simply reviews the facts in\nthe light most favorable to Cone, concludes that the evi\ndence does not undermine confidence in the jury’s deter\nmination that Cone is guilty, but sends the case back for\n“full consideration” of whether the same is true as to the\njury’s sentence of death. Ante, at 25–27.\n  So this is what we are left with: a fact-specific determi\nnation, under the established legal standard, viewing the\nunique facts in favor of the defendant, that the Brady\nclaim fails with respect to guilt, but might have merit as\nto sentencing. In light of all this, I see no reason to quar\nrel with the Court’s ruling on the Brady claim.\n  In considering on remand whether the facts establish a\nBrady violation, it is clear that the lower courts should\nanalyze the issue under the constitutional standards we\nhave set forth, not under whatever standards the Ameri\ncan Bar Association may have established. The ABA\nstandards are wholly irrelevant to the disposition of this\ncase, and the majority’s passing citation of them should\nnot be taken to suggest otherwise.

Is a federal habeas claim ‘procedurally defaulted’\n     because it has been presented twice to the state\n     courts?\n     “2. Is a federal habeas court powerless to recognize\n     that a state court erred in holding that state law pre­\n     cludes reviewing a claim?” Pet. for Cert. i.\n   Both of these questions are based on a factually incor­\nrect premise, namely, that the Tennessee Court of Crimi­\nnal Appeals, the highest state court to entertain peti­\ntioner’s appeal from the denial of his second petition for\nstate postconviction relief,1 rejected petitioner’s Brady2\nclaim on the ground that the claim had been previously\n\n——————\n  1 Because  the Tennessee Supreme Court denied discretionary review\nof the decision of the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals decision\naffirming the denial of petitioner’s second amended petition for post­\nconviction relief, we must look to the decision of the latter court to\ndetermine if the decision below was based on an adequate and inde­\npendent state ground. See Baldwin v. Reese, 541 U. S. 27, 30–32\n(2004); O’Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U. S. 838, 842–843 (1999).\n  2 Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963).\n2                      CONE v. BELL\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\ndecided by the Tennessee Supreme Court in petitioner’s\ndirect appeal. Petitioner’s argument is that the State\nSupreme Court did not decide any Brady issue on direct\nappeal, that the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals\nerred in holding otherwise, and that the Sixth Circuit\nerred in concluding that the Brady claim had been proce­\ndurally defaulted on this ground. Petitioner is quite cor­\nrect that his Brady claim was not decided on direct appeal,\nand the Court in the present case is clearly correct in\nholding that a second attempt to litigate a claim in state\ncourt does not necessarily bar subsequent federal habeas\nreview. See ante, at 8–9.\n  But all of this is beside the point because the Tennessee\nCourt of Criminal Appeals did not reject petitioner’s Brady\nclaim on the ground that the claim had been previously\ndetermined on direct appeal. Rather, petitioner’s Brady\nclaim was simply never raised before the Tennessee Court\nof Criminal Appeals, and that court did not rule on the\nclaim at all.\n  Because the Sixth Circuit’s decision on the issue of\nprocedural default rests on the same mistaken premise\nthat the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals rejected\npetitioner’s Brady claim on the ground that it had been\npreviously determined, I entirely agree with the majority\nthat the Sixth Circuit’s decision on that issue cannot be\nsustained and that a remand is required. I cannot join the\nCourt’s opinion, however, for two chief reasons.\n  First, the Court states without explanation that “Cone\nproperly preserved and exhausted his Brady claim in the\nstate court” and that therefore the claim has not been\ndefaulted. Ante, at 20. Because Cone never fairly raised\nthis claim in the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, the\nclaim is either not exhausted (if Cone could now raise the\nclaim in state court) or is procedurally defaulted (if state\nlaw now provides no avenue for further review). I would\nleave these questions for resolution in the first instance on\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nremand.\n  Second, the Court, again without explanation, remands\nthis case to the District Court, not the Court of Appeals. I\nsee no justification for this step.\n                              I\n  In order to understand the tangled procedural default\nissue presented in this case, it is necessary to review the\nfar-from-exemplary manner in which the attorneys for\npetitioner and respondent litigated the Brady claim in the\nstate courts.\n  On direct appeal, petitioner did not raise any Brady\nclaim. As the Court notes, petitioner did claim that the\nState had violated a state discovery rule by failing to\nprovide prior statements given by certain witnesses and\nthat therefore the testimony of these witnesses should\nhave been stricken. App. 114–117; State v. Cone, 665\nS. W. 2d 87, 94 (Tenn. 1984). Although this claim con­\ncerned the State’s failure to turn over information, it is\nclear that this was not a Brady claim.\n  The first appearance of anything resembling the claim\nnow at issue occurred in 1993 when petitioner’s experi­\nenced attorneys filed an amendment to his second petition\nfor postconviction relief in the Shelby County Criminal\nCourt. This petition included a long litany of tangled\nclaims. Paragraph 35 of this amended petition claimed,\namong other things, that the State had wrongfully with­\nheld information demonstrating that one particular prose­\ncution witness had testified falsely concerning “petitioner\nand his drug use.” App. 13–14. This nondisclosure, the\npetition stated, violated not only the Fifth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the Constitution of the United States\n(which protect the due process right on which Brady is\nbased) but also the Fourth, Sixth, and Eighth Amend­\nments to the United States Constitution and four provi­\nsions of the Tennessee Constitution.\n4                          CONE v. BELL\n\n                         Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n   Two months later, counsel for petitioner filed an\namendment adding 12 more claims, including one (¶41)\nalleging that the State had abridged petitioner’s rights by\nfailing to disclose evidence that petitioner suffered from\ndrug problems. Id., at 20. According to this new submis­\nsion, the nondisclosure violated, in addition to the previ­\nously cited provisions of the federal and state constitu­\ntions, five more provisions of the state constitution,\nincluding provisions regarding double jeopardy, see Tenn.\nConst., Art. I, §10, ex post facto laws, §11, indictment, §14,\nand open courts, §17.\n   The Shelby County Criminal Court was faced with the\ntask of wading through the morass presented in the\namended petition. Under Tenn. Code Ann. §40–30–112\n(1990) (repealed 1995),3 a claim could not be raised in a\npostconviction proceeding if the claim had been “previ­\nously determined” or waived. Citing the State Supreme\nCourt’s rejection on direct appeal of petitioner’s claim that\nthe prosecution had violated a state discovery rule by\nfailing to turn over witness statements, the State incor­\nrectly informed the court that the failure-to-disclose­\nexculpatory-evidence claim set out in ¶41 had been “previ­\nously determined” on direct appeal. App. 15–16. The\nShelby County Criminal Court rejected the claim on this\nground, and held that all of petitioner’s claims had either\nbeen previously determined or waived. Id., at 22.\n   Given the importance now assigned to petitioner’s\nBrady claim, one might think that petitioner’s attorneys\nwould have (a) stressed that claim in the opening brief\nthat they filed in the Tennessee Court of Criminal Ap­\n——————\n   3 Tennessee law has since changed. Currently, the Tennessee Post-\n\nConviction Procedure Act bars any second postconviction petition, see\nTenn. Code Ann. §40–30–102 (2006), and permits the reopening of a\npetition only under limited circumstances, §40–30–117. These restric­\ntions apply to any petition filed after the enactment of the Post-\nConviction Procedure Act, even if the conviction occurred long before.\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

In my judgment, however, there is no\nbasis for concluding that the Tennessee Court of Criminal\nAppeals thought that any Brady issue was before it. A\ncontrary interpretation would mean that the Tennessee\nCourt of Criminal Appeals, disregarding its own rules and\nstandard practice, entertained an issue that was not men­\ntioned at all in the appellant’s main brief and was men­\ntioned only in passing and without any development in the\nreply brief. It would mean that the Tennessee Court of\nCriminal Appeals, having chosen to delve into the Brady\nissue on its own, ruled on the issue without even mention­\ning it in its opinion and without bothering to check the\nrecord to determine whether in fact the Brady issue had\nbeen decided on direct appeal. Such an interpretation is\nutterly implausible, and it is telling that the majority\nin this case cites no support for such an interpretation in\nthe opinion of the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals’\nopinion.\n   The Sixth Circuit’s decision on the question of proce­\ndural default rests on an erroneous premise and must\ntherefore be vacated.\n                           II\n  I also agree with the Court that we should not affirm\nthe decision below on the ground that the Brady claim\nlacks substantive merit.

BELL\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nprocedural default, the Sixth Circuit went on to discuss\nthe merits of petitioner’s Brady claim. In its 2001 opinion,\nthe Court of Appeals recognized that the prosecution’s\nBrady obligation extends not only to evidence that is\nmaterial to guilt but also to evidence that is material to\npunishment. See Cone v. Bell, 243 F. 3d 961, 968 (2001)\n(citing Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, 480 U. S. 39, 57 (1987)).\nBut neither in that opinion nor in its 2006 opinion did the\ncourt address the materiality of the information in ques­\ntion here in relation to petitioner’s punishment. See 492\nF. 3d, at 756 (“A review of the allegedly withheld docu­\nments shows that this evidence would not have overcome\nthe overwhelming evidence of Cone’s guilt in committing a\nbrutal double murder and the persuasive testimony that\nCone was not under the influence of drugs” (emphasis\nadded)). Therefore, despite the strength of the arguments\nin JUSTICE THOMAS’ dissent, I would leave that question to\nbe decided by the Sixth Circuit on remand.\n                             III\n   The Court, however, does not simply vacate and remand\nto the Sixth Circuit but goes further.\n   First, the Court states without elaboration that peti­\ntioner “preserved and exhausted his Brady claim in the\nstate court.” Ante, at 20. As I have explained, petitioner\ndid not fairly present his Brady claim in his prior appeal\nto the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, and therefore\nthat claim is either unexhausted or procedurally barred.\nIf the State is not now foreclosed from relying on the\nfailure to exhaust, see 28 U. S. C. §2254(b)(3), or on proce­\ndural default,6 those questions may be decided on remand.\n——————\n  6 Unlike exhaustion, procedural default may be waived if it is not\n\nraised as a defense. Banks v. Dretke, 540 U. S. 668, 705 (2004) (allow­\ning for waiver of “procedural default” “based on the State’s litigation\nconduct” (citing Gray v. Netherland, 518 U. S. 152, 166 (1996))).

A remand to the\nDistrict Court would of course be necessary if petitioner\nwere entitled to an evidentiary hearing, but the Court\ndoes not hold that an evidentiary hearing is either re­\nquired or permitted. In my view, unless there is to be an\nevidentiary hearing, there is no reason to remand this\ncase to the District Court. If the only purpose of remand is\nto require an evaluation of petitioner’s Brady claim in\nlight of the present record, the District Court is not in a\nsuperior position to conduct such a review. And even if\nsuch a review is conducted in the first instance by the\nDistrict Court, that court’s decision would be subject to de\nnovo review in the Court of Appeals. 492 F. 3d, at 750;\nCone v. Bell, 243 F. 3d, at 966–967 (CA6 2001); see United\nStates v. Graham, 484 F. 3d 413 (CA6 2007); United States\nv. Miller, 161 F. 3d 977, 987 (CA6 1998); United States v.\nPhillip, 948 F. 2d 241, 250 (CA6 1991). Accordingly, I see\nno good reason for remanding to the District Court rather\nthan the Court of Appeals. And if the majority has such a\nreason, it is one that it has chosen to keep to itself.\n                       *   *     *\n  For these reasons, I would vacate the decision of the\nCourt of Appeals and remand to that court.\n\n\n\n\n——————\nBrady claim was procedurally defaulted, but the State’s supporting\narguments have shifted. Whether the question of procedural default\ndescribed in this opinion should be entertained under the particular\ncircumstances here is an intensely fact-bound matter that should be\nleft for the Sixth Circuit on remand.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

In so doing,\nthe majority correctly rejects Cone’s argument that his\nguilty verdict was secured in violation of his rights under\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). The majority\ndeclines, however, to decide whether the same evidence\nthat was insufficient under Brady to overturn his convic\ntion provides a basis for overturning his death sentence.\nThe majority instead remands this question to the District\nCourt for further consideration because it finds that the\nCourt of Appeals engaged in a “summary treatment” of\nCone’s Brady sentencing claim. See ante, at 25–27.\n   I respectfully dissent. The Court of Appeals’ allegedly\n“summary treatment” of Cone’s sentencing claim does not\njustify a remand to the District Court. Cone has failed to\nestablish “ ‘a reasonable probability that, had the evidence\nbeen disclosed to the defense, the result of the [sentencing]\nproceeding would have been different,’ ” Kyles v. Whitley,\n514 U. S. 419, 435 (1995) (quoting United States v. Bagley,\n473 U. S. 667, 682 (1985) (opinion of Blackmun, J.)).

Along the way, Cone shot a\npolice officer and a bystander while trying to escape the\nfirst robbery, attempted to shoot another man in a failed\ncarjacking attempt, unsuccessfully tried to force his way\ninto a woman’s apartment at gunpoint, and murdered 93\nyear-old Shipley Todd and his 79-year-old wife, Cleopatra.\nWhen he was tried on two counts of first-degree murder in\n1982, Cone’s sole defense was that he did not have the\nrequisite intent to commit first-degree murder because\nhe was in the grip of a chronic amphetamine psychosis.\nThe jury rejected the defense and convicted Cone of both\nmurders.\n   At sentencing, the Tennessee jury found beyond a rea\nsonable doubt that four statutory aggravating factors\napplied to Cone’s offense: (1) Cone had been convicted of\none or more previous felonies involving the use or threat of\nviolence; (2) he had knowingly created a great risk of\ndeath to two or more persons other than the victim during\nhis act of murder; (3) the murder was especially heinous,\natrocious or cruel in that it involved torture or depravity of\nmind; and (4) the murder was committed for the purpose\nof avoiding a lawful arrest.

Code Ann. §39–2-203(i) (1982).2 Cone ar\ngued to the jury at sentencing that his “capacity . . . to\nappreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform\nhis conduct to the requirements of the law was substan\ntially impaired as a result of mental disease or defect or\nintoxication which was insufficient to establish a defense\nto the crime but which substantially affected his judg\nment.” See §39–2-203(j)(8). But the jury found that nei\nther this, nor any other mitigating factor, outweighed the\naggravating factors. The jury, as required by Tennessee\nlaw, unanimously sentenced Cone to death. See §39–2\n203(g).\n   For almost three decades, Cone’s case has traveled\nthrough the Tennessee and federal courts. This Court has\ntwice reversed decisions from the Court of Appeals that\ninvalidated Cone’s conviction and sentence. See Bell v.\nCone, 535 U. S. 685 (2002); Bell v. Cone, 543 U. S. 447\n(2005) (per curiam). On remand from this Court’s latest\ndecision, the Court of Appeals directly considered whether\na handful of police reports, law enforcement bulletins, and\nnotes that were allegedly withheld from Cone’s trial attor\nneys could have changed the result of Cone’s trial or sen\ntencing. And, for the second time, the Court of Appeals\nheld that there was not a “ ‘reasonable probability’ ” that\nthe evidence would have altered the jury’s conclusion “that\nCone’s prior drug use did not vitiate his specific intent to\nmurder his victims and did not mitigate his culpability\nsufficient to avoid the death sentence.” 492 F. 3d 743, 757\n(CA6 2007). The Court of Appeals, therefore, held that\nneither Cone’s conviction nor his sentence was invalid.\n——————\n  2 The Tennessee Supreme Court later concluded that the record in\n\nCone’s case was doubtful as to evidence supporting the second circum\nstance given the lapse in time between the initial events of the escape\nand the Todd murders. Cone, 665 S. W. 2d, at 95. The court, however,\ndetermined that the existence of the other three factors rendered any\npossible error in this factor harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Ibid.\n4                       CONE v. BELL\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nSee ibid.; Cone v. Bell, 243 F. 3d 961, 968 (CA6 2001). We\nshould affirm the Court of Appeals and put an end to this\nlitigation.\n                               II\n    According to the majority, the Court of Appeals’ decision\naffirming Cone’s death sentence is too “summary,” ante, at\n25, and the facts are such that, on further examination,\nCone “might” be able to demonstrate that it is “possible”\nthat the contested evidence would have persuaded the jury\nto spare his life, ante, at 25–26. On this reasoning, the\nmajority remands the case directly to the District Court\nfor “full consideration [of] the merits of Cone’s [sentencing]\nclaim.” Ante, at 27. I disagree on all counts. Remanding\nthe sentencing issue to the District Court is an “unusual\nstep” for this Court to take. House v. Bell, 547 U. S. 518,\n557 (2006) (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment in part\nand dissenting in part). Furthermore, in this case, it is a\nstep that is legally and factually unjustified. There is not\n“ ‘a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been\ndisclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would\nhave been different.’ ” Kyles, 514 U. S., at 433–434 (quot\ning Bagley, 473 U. S., at 682 (opinion of Blackmun, J.)).\n                            A\n  The majority’s criticism of the Court of Appeals’ alleg\nedly “summary treatment” of the sentencing question is\nmisplaced. Before the Court of Appeals, Cone dedicated\neight pages of his opening brief to arguing that the impli\ncated evidence was material to his guilt or innocence, but\nspent only one paragraph arguing its materiality to his\ndeath sentence. See Brief for Appellant in No. 99–5279\n(CA6), pp. 40–48. The Court of Appeals’ focus on the guilt\nphase, rather than the sentencing phase, simply followed\nCone’s lead. See 492 F. 3d, at 755 (“In his most recent\nbrief, claiming that his receiving the withheld evidence\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                     5\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nwould have resulted in a different sentence, Cone has\nmade only conclusory arguments”).3        There is nothing\ndefective about a judicial decision that summarily rejects\nan abbreviated legal argument, especially where, as here,\nthe burden of proving the materiality of the contested\nevidence was on Cone.4\n                             B\n  In remanding this matter to the District Court, the\nmajority makes two critical errors—one legal and one\nfactual—that leave the false impression that Cone’s Brady\nclaim has a chance of success. First, the majority states\nthat “[i]t is possible that the suppressed evidence” may\nhave convinced the jury that Cone’s substance abuse\nplayed a mitigating role in his crime and “[t]he evidence\nmight also have rebutted the State’s suggestion” that\nCone’s experts were inaccurately depicting the depth of his\ndrug-induced impairment. Ante, at 26 (emphasis added);\nsee also ante, at 26–27 (remanding “[b]ecause the evidence\nsuppressed at Cone’s trial may well have been material to\nthe jury’s assessment of the proper punishment in this\ncase” (emphasis added)). But, as the majority implicitly\n——————\n  3 The assertion by the majority, ante, at 26, n. 19, and JUSTICE ALITO,\n\nante, at 8 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part), that the\nCourt of Appeals did not address the merits of the sentencing issue at\nall is flatly wrong. See 492 F. 3d, at 757 (rejecting Cone’s Brady claim\nbecause the proffered evidence would not have altered the jury’s con\nclusion “that Cone’s prior drug use did not vitiate his specific intent to\nmurder his victims and did not mitigate his culpability sufficient to\navoid the death sentence” (emphasis added)).\n  4 The majority does not attempt to justify its remand by contending\n\nthat it is necessary because the record is insufficient to decide the\nclaim. Nor could it persuasively contend a remand is necessary so that\nthe District Court can hold an evidentiary hearing. Such a hearing\nwould shed no additional light on the trial proceedings or the relative\nimpeachment value of the withheld documents. Cone himself agrees\nthat “this Court should resolve the merits of [his] Brady claim.” Reply\nBrief for Petitioner 24; see also Brief for Respondent 26–27.\n6                       CONE v. BELL\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nacknowledges, see ante, at 26, n. 19, this is not the correct\nlegal test for evaluating a Brady claim: “The mere possibil\nity that an item of undisclosed information might have\nhelped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of\nthe trial, does not establish ‘materiality’ in the constitu\ntional sense.” United States v. Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 109–\n110 (1976) (emphasis added).\n   Rather, this Court has made clear that the legal stan\ndard for adjudicating such a claim is whether there is a\n“reasonable probability” that the jury would have been\npersuaded by the allegedly withheld evidence. Kyles,\nsupra, at 435; Bagley, supra, at 682 (opinion of Blackmun,\nJ.). It simply is not sufficient, therefore, to claim that\n“there is a reasonable possibility that . . . testimony might\nhave produced a different result . . . . [P]etitioner’s burden\nis to establish a reasonable probability of a different re\nsult.” Strickler v. Greene, 527 U. S. 263, 291 (1999) (em\nphasis in original). To satisfy the “reasonable probability”\nstandard, Cone must show that “the favorable evidence\ncould reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a\ndifferent light as to undermine confidence” in the jury’s\nsentencing determination. Kyles, supra, at 435. The\nCourt must view the record “as a whole,” Sawyer v.\nWhitley, 505 U. S. 333, 374 (1992) (STEVENS, J., concur\nring in judgment), and determine whether the absence of\nthe disclosure prevented Cone from receiving “ ‘a trial\nresulting in a [sentence] worthy of confidence.’ ” Strickler,\nsupra, at 290 (quoting Kyles, 514 U. S., at 434).\n   In the context of this case, for Cone to establish “ ‘a\nreasonable probability that, had the evidence been dis\nclosed to the defense, the result of the [sentencing] pro\nceeding would have been different,’ ” id., at 435, he must\nnot only demonstrate that the withheld evidence would\nhave established that he was substantially impaired as a\nresult of drug abuse or withdrawal; Cone also must estab\nlish that the addition of the allegedly withheld evidence\n                      Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                     7\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nultimately would have led the jury to conclude that any\nmitigating factors (including substantial impairment)\noutweighed all of the established aggravating factors. See\nTenn. Code Ann. §39–2-203(g).5\n   Second, the majority incorrectly claims that to prevail\non his Brady claim, Cone must demonstrate simply that\nthe withheld evidence supported the inference that he\n“was impaired by his use of drugs around the time his\ncrimes were committed.” See ante, at 21. This is factually\ninaccurate because there was already significant evidence\nof Cone’s drug use at trial. To establish that the allegedly\nwithheld evidence would reasonably have had any impact\non his case, Cone must instead show that the evidence\nwould have supported his claim of substantial mental\nimpairment from drug use.\n   There was extensive evidence at trial that supported the\ninference that Cone was not only a longstanding drug\nuser, but that he was in fact using drugs at the time of his\ncrimes. The State itself presented significant evidence on\nthis point. For example, it presented proof that officers\nfound marijuana cigarette butts, empty drug vials, and\nloose syringes in the car that Cone abandoned immedi\nately after the jewelry store robbery. Tr. 1505–1509 (Apr.\n19, 1982). The State also did not challenge testimony from\nCone’s mother that Cone used drugs. Id., at 1647, 1648–\n1653 (Apr. 20, 1982). And, most tellingly, the State intro\nduced evidence that Cone was abusing three drugs—\n——————\n  5 The majority asserts that the standard under Tennessee law for\n\ndemonstrating mental defect or intoxication as a mitigating factor at\nsentencing is “far lesser” than the standard for demonstrating insanity\nin the guilt phase of a criminal trial. Ante, at 25. But the mitigating\nfactor still requires a showing that Cone’s mental capacity was “sub\nstantially impaired” as a result of mental defect. Tenn. Code Ann. §39–\n2-203(j)(8). In any event, the only authority cited by the majority for its\nassertion that the standard is “far” lesser than that for insanity is\nJUSTICE STEVENS’ lone dissent in a prior appeal in this case.

Id., at 1915–1916, 1920 (Apr. 22, 1982). As the\nCourt of Appeals explained, “[i]t would not have been news\nto the jurors, that Cone was a ‘drug user.’ ” 492 F. 3d, at\n757.6\n   In contrast, what was contested by the State during\ntrial was Cone’s defense that his drug use was so signifi\ncant that it caused him to suffer from extreme ampheta\nmine psychosis at the time of the murders. One of Cone’s\nexpert witnesses, a neuropharmacologist, testified that by\nthe summer of 1980, when the crimes occurred, Cone was\ningesting “ferociously large doses” of drugs and that his\nincreasing tolerance and use of amphetamines caused a\nchronic amphetamine psychosis. Tr. 1736–1737, 1744–\n1747, 1758–1759 (Apr. 21, 1982). The expert further\ntestified that if a person with chronic amphetamine psy\nchosis were to go into withdrawal, he could suffer extreme\nmood swings, “a crashing depression,” and a state of weak\nness so severe that “he could barely lift himself.” Id., at\n1857–1859. In this expert’s view, these symptoms could\ncause a person to “lose his mind.” Id., at 1859.\n   The State contradicted that testimony with significant\n——————\n    6 Althoughthere were two occasions during closing arguments where\nprosecutors intimated that Cone was not a drug user, see Tr. 2014–\n2015, 2068 (Apr. 22, 1982), the State’s argument otherwise consistently\nfocused on the real issue in the case: that Cone was not so significantly\naffected by his drug use around the time of his crimes that he was “out\nof his mind” or “drug crazy” during the critical days of August 1980.\nSee id., at 2023–2024, 2071–2084. The majority’s focus on two brief\nexcerpts from the State’s closing argument fails to faithfully view the\nrecord “as a whole” for purposes of a Brady analysis. See Sawyer v.\nWhitley, 505 U. S. 333, 374 (1992) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judg\nment); see also Strickler v. Greene, 527 U. S. 263, 290–291 (1999)\n(finding no reasonable probability of a different result even when\nprosecutor’s closing argument relied on testimony that could have been\nimpeached by withheld material).\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nevidence that Cone did not act like someone who was “out\nof his mind” during the commission of his crimes. Rather,\nthe State argued, Cone behaved rationally during his\ninitial Tennessee robbery, his subsequent escape, his\nflight from Tennessee to Florida after the Todd murders,\nhis Florida robbery, and his subsequent arrest. See, e.g.,\nid., at 2074–2084 (Apr. 22, 1982). To substantiate this\nargument, the State called FBI Special Agent Eugene\nFlynn to the stand. Agent Flynn testified that, when\ncaptured, Cone coherently detailed his travel from Ten\nnessee to Florida, explained his efforts to evade detection\nby shaving his beard and buying new clothes, and initi\nated negotiations for a plea bargain. Id., at 1918–1921.\nThe State also presented testimony from a friend of\nCone’s, Ilene Blankman, that she saw no indication that\nCone was under the influence of drugs or severe with\ndrawal in the days immediately following the murder of\nthe Todds. Id., at 1875–1876, 1882–1883 (Apr. 21, 1982).\n   Viewing the record as a whole, then, it is apparent that\nthe contested issue at trial and sentencing was not\nwhether Cone used drugs, but rather the quantity of\nCone’s drug use and its effect on his mental state. Only if\nthe evidence allegedly withheld from Cone was relevant to\nthis question whether Cone suffered from extreme am\nphetamine psychosis or other substantial impairment\nwould the evidence have been exculpatory for purposes of\nBrady. See Order Denying Motion for Evidentiary Hear\ning and Order of Partial Dismissal, Cone v. Bell, No. 97–\n2312–M1/A (WD Tenn., May 15, 1998), App. to Pet. for\nCert. 119a, n. 9 (explaining that “the issue at trial was not\nwhether Cone had ever abused any drugs (he clearly had),\nbut whether he was out of his mind on amphetamines at\nthe time of the murders”); Tr. 2115–2116 (Apr. 23, 1982).\n                          III\n  With the legal and factual issues correctly framed, it\n10                     CONE v. BELL\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nbecomes clear that Cone cannot establish a reasonable\nprobability that admission of the evidence—viewed either\nindividually or cumulatively—would have caused the jury\nto alter his sentence.\n                             A\n                             1\n  Cone first argues that he was improperly denied police\nreports that included witness statements regarding Cone’s\nbehavior around the time of his crime spree. The first\nstatement was given by a convenience store employee,\nRobert McKinney, who saw Cone the day before he robbed\nthe Tennessee jewelry store. When asked whether Cone\nappeared “to be drunk or high on anything,” McKinney\nanswered, “[w]ell he did, he acted real weird . . . he just\nwandered around the store.” App. 49. But McKinney\nsubsequently clarified that Cone “didn’t sound drunk” and\nthat the reason Cone attracted his attention was because\nhe “wasn’t acting like a regular customer”; he was “just\nkinda wandering” around the store. Motion to Expand the\nRecord in No. 97–2312–M1 (WD Tenn.), Exh. 2, pp. 3, 4.\nContrary to the majority’s assertion, this interview is not\nconvincing evidence “that Cone appeared to be ‘drunk or\nhigh’ ” when McKinney saw him. Ante, at 21. McKinney’s\nclarification that he had characterized Cone’s behavior as\n“weird” because Cone appeared to be killing time rather\nthan acting like a normal shopper undermines the impli\ncation of McKinney’s earlier statement that Cone looked\n“weird” because he might have been drunk or on drugs.\nThus, there is little chance that McKinney’s statement\nwould have provided any significant additional evidence\nthat Cone was using drugs, let alone provide sentence\nchanging evidence that he was substantially impaired due\nto amphetamine psychosis.\n  The second statement was given by Charles and Debbie\nSlaughter, who both witnessed Cone fleeing from police\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nafter the jewelry store robbery and reportedly told police\nthat he looked “wild eyed.” App. 50. Cone had just robbed\na jewelry store, shot a police officer and a bystander, and\nwas still fleeing from police when seen by the Slaughters.\nIt is thus unlikely that their observation of a “wild eyed”\nman would have been interpreted by the jury to mean that\nCone “was suffering from chronic amphetamine psychosis\nat the time of the crimes,” ante, at 21, n. 16, rather than to\nmean that Cone looked like a man on the run.\n   The third statement is contained in a police report\nauthored by an officer who helped apprehend Cone after\nthe Florida drugstore robbery. He reported that he saw a\nsuspect “at the rear of Sambos restaurant. Subject was\nobserved to be looking about in a frenzied manner and also\nappeared to be looking for a place to run.” App. 53. Noth\ning in this police report either connects Cone to drug use\nor appears otherwise capable of altering the jury’s under\nstanding of Cone’s mental state at the time of the crimes.\nIt certainly makes perfect sense that Cone was “looking\nabout in a frenzied manner,” ibid.; he had just robbed a\ndrugstore and was about to engage in a gun battle with\npolice in order to evade arrest. The police officer’s descrip\ntion of Cone’s appearance under these circumstances thus\ndoes not “undermine confidence” in Cone’s sentence.\nKyles, 514 U. S., at 435.\n                             2\n  The next category of documents that Cone relies upon to\nestablish his Brady claim are police bulletins. Some of the\nbulletins were sent by Memphis Police Sergeant Roby to\nneighboring jurisdictions on the day of the Todd murders\nand the day after. The bulletins sought Cone’s apprehen\nsion and alternatively described him as a “drug user” or a\n“heavy drug user.” App. 55–58. Cone asserts that he\ncould have used these bulletins to impeach Sergeant\nRoby’s trial testimony that the sergeant did not see any\n12                         CONE v. BELL\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ntrack marks when visiting Cone in jail a week later. Tr.\n1939 (Apr. 22, 1982). Cone’s reasoning is faulty for two\nkey reasons. First, Sergeant Roby never testified that\nCone was not a drug user. His only trial testimony on this\npoint was simply that he observed no “needle marks” on\nCone’s arm when taking hair samples from him a few days\nafter Cone’s apprehension. Ibid. Second, the bulletins\nestablish only “that the police were initially cautious\nregarding the characteristics of a person who had commit\nted several heinous crimes.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 119a, n.\n9. The bulletins would not have tended to prove that the\nfugitive Cone was, in fact, a heavy drug user—let alone\n“out of his mind” or otherwise substantially impaired due\nto amphetamine psychosis—at the time of his crimes.7\n                              3\n  Cone also argues that material was withheld that could\nhave been used to impeach Ilene Blankman’s testimony\nthat Cone did not appear to be high or in withdrawal when\nshe helped him obtain a Florida driver’s license during his\nefforts to evade arrest in Florida. Tr. 1875–1882 (Apr. 21,\n1982). But he again fails to meet the standard for excul\npatory evidence set by Brady.\n  Cone first points to police notes of a pre-trial interview\nwith Blankman, which did not reflect the statement she\ngave at trial that she saw no track marks on Cone’s arm.\nApp. 72–73. But Blankman was questioned at trial about\n——————\n   7 Alert bulletins sent by the FBI similarly identified Cone as a “be\n\nlieved heavy drug user” or a “drug user.” App. 62–70. Cone argues\nthat these bulletins could have been used to impeach FBI Agent Flynn’s\ntestimony about Cone’s arrest in Florida. The bulletins would not have\nconstituted material impeachment evidence, however, for the second\nreason identified above. In addition, the bulletins would not have\ncontradicted any of FBI Agent Flynn’s testimony; he in fact stated at\ntrial that Cone reported using three drugs and was undergoing mild\ndrug withdrawal when he was captured in Florida. Tr. 1915–1916\n(Apr. 22, 1982).\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            13\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nher failure to initially disclose this fact to police, Tr. 1903\n(Apr. 21, 1982), so the jury was fully aware of the omis\nsion. Disclosure of the original copy of the police notes\nthus could not have had any material effect on the jury’s\ndeliberations. Moreover, the missing notes also recorded a\ndamning statement by Blankman that Cone “never used\ndrugs around” her and she “never saw Cone with drug\nparaphernalia.” App. 73. Thus, it is difficult to accept\nCone’s argument that he would have benefited from the\nintroduction of notes from Blackman’s pretrial interview.\nIf anything, these police notes would have undermined his\nmitigation argument.\n   Cone next relies on a report that describes a woman’s\nconfrontation with the prosecution team and Blankman at\na restaurant during trial. During the encounter, the\nwoman accused Blankman of lying on the stand in order to\nframe Cone for the murders. Id., at 74–75. The report\nindicates that the prosecutors politely declined the\nwoman’s numerous attempts to discuss the merits of the\ncase and that Blankman said nothing. Id., at 75. Nothing\nabout this encounter raises doubts about Blankman’s\ncredibility.\n   Last, Cone points to “correspondence in the district\nattorney’s files suggest[ing] that the prosecution had been\nunusually solicitous of [Blankman’s] testimony.” Brief for\nPetitioner 45. But the correspondence was completely\ninnocuous. One of the notes, sent in response to Blank\nman’s request for a copy of her prior statement, expressed\nto Blankman that her “cooperation in this particular\nmatter is appreciated.” App. 76. The prosecutor then sent\na letter to confirm that Blankman would testify at trial.\nId., at 77. And finally, after trial, the prosecutor sent a\nnote to inform Blankman of the verdict and indicate that\nthey “certainly appreciate[d] [her] cooperation with [them]\nin the trial of Gary Bradford Cone.” Id., at 78. There is\nnothing about these notes that “tend[s] to prove any fact\n14                     CONE v. BELL\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthat is both favorable to Cone and material to his guilt or\npunishment.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 116a.\n                               B\n   Viewing the record as a whole, Cone has not come close\nto demonstrating that there is a “reasonable probability”\nthat the withheld evidence, analyzed individually or cu\nmulatively, would have changed the result of his sentenc\ning. Much of the impeachment evidence identified by\nCone is of no probative value whatsoever. The police\nbulletins do not contradict any of the trial testimony; the\nrestaurant encounter was innocuous; and the correspon\ndence sent by prosecutors to Blankman does not under\nmine her testimony or call Cone’s mental state into doubt.\nIf the remaining evidence has any value to Cone, it is\nmarginal at best. There was testimony that Blankman\ndid not initially tell police that Cone lacked track marks.\nSee Tr. 1903 (Apr. 21, 1982). McKinney clarified in his\nstatement that Cone’s activity in the store was consistent\nwith a person killing time, not the use of drugs or alcohol.\nAnd the behavior described by the Slaughters and the\nFlorida police officer is more naturally attributable to the\ncircumstances of Cone’s flight from the police than to any\ninference that Cone was “out of his mind” or otherwise\nsubstantially impaired due to amphetamine psychosis.\n   Countering the trivial value of the alleged Brady mate\nrial is the clear and overwhelming evidence that during\nCone’s crime spree, he was neither sufficiently insane to\navoid a conviction of murder nor substantially impaired by\nhis drug use or withdrawal-related psychosis. There was\nsubstantial evidence that Cone carefully planned the\njewelry store robbery and was calm in carrying it out, Tr.\nat 974–976, 1014 (Apr. 16, 1982), 1350–1352 (Apr. 17,\n1982), 1501 (Apr. 19, 1982), 2075 (Apr. 22, 1982); that he\nsuccessfully eluded police after engaging them in a shoot\nout, id., at 1053–1064 (Apr. 16, 1982); that, after hiding\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\novernight, he concocted a ruse to try to gain illegal entry\nto a residence, id., at 1205–1208 (Apr. 17, 1982); that he\nmurdered the Todds after they declined to cooperate with\nhis efforts to further elude police, id., at 1681 (Apr. 20,\n1982); that he took steps to change his appearance at the\nTodd residence and then successfully fled to Florida, id., at\n1918–1919 (Apr. 22, 1982); that he arrived in Florida\nexhibiting no signs of drug use or severe withdrawal, id.,\nat 1875–1882 (Apr. 21, 1982); that he obtained false iden\ntification in a further effort to avoid apprehension, id., at\n1881–1882, and that he denied any memory lapses and\ndescribed undergoing only minor drug withdrawal when\npolice arrested him, id., at 1919–1920 (Apr. 22, 1982).\nGiven this wealth of evidence, there is no “reasonable\nprobability” that the jury would have found that Cone was\nentitled to the substantial impairment mitigator had the\nevidence he seeks been made available to him.\n   And even if Cone could have presented this evidence to\nthe jury at sentencing and established an entitlement to\nthis mitigator, he still has not demonstrated a reasonable\nprobability that it would have outweighed all of the aggra\nvating factors supporting the jury’s death sentence. See\nid., at 2151–2154 (Apr. 23, 1982). In its decision on direct\nappeal, the Tennessee Supreme Court was well aware of\nthe evidence regarding the “degree and extent of [Cone’s]\ndrug abuse.” Cone, 665 S. W. 2d, at 90. As part of its\nrequired independent review of whether the mitigation\nevidence was sufficiently substantial to outweigh the\naggravating factors, see Tenn. Code Ann. §39–2-205, the\nTennessee court nevertheless concluded that the sentence\nwas “not in any way disproportionate under all of the\ncircumstances, including the brutal murders of two elderly\ndefenseless persons by an escaping armed robber who had\nterrorized a residential neighborhood for twenty-four\nhours.” 665 S. W. 2d, at 95–96. None of Cone’s proffered\nevidence places that conclusion, made by both the jury and\n16                     CONE v. BELL\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthe Tennessee Supreme Court, “in such a different light as\nto undermine confidence” in Cone’s sentence. Kyles, 514\nU. S., at 435; see also Strickler, 527 U. S., at 296.\n                            IV\n  This Court should not vacate and remand lower court\ndecisions based on nothing more than the vague suspicion\nthat error might be present, or because the court below\ncould have been more clear. This is especially so where, as\nhere, the record before the Court is adequate to evaluate\nCone’s Brady claims with respect to both the guilt and\nsentencing phases of his trial. The Court’s willingness to\nreturn the sentencing issue to the District Court without\nany firm conviction that an error was committed by the\nCourt of Appeals is inconsistent with our established\npractice and disrespectful to the lower courts that have\nconsidered this case. Worse still, the inevitable result will\nbe years of additional delay in the execution of a death\nsentence lawfully imposed by a Tennessee jury. Because I\nwould affirm the judgment below, I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 145883, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2009/04/28/Cone_v._Bell.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2008                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

BELL, WARDEN\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 07–1114. Argued December 9, 2008—Decided April 28, 2009\nAfter the State discredited petitioner Cone’s defense that he killed two\n  people while suffering from acute psychosis caused by drug addiction,\n  he was convicted and sentenced to death. The Tennessee Supreme\n  Court affirmed on direct appeal and the state courts denied postcon\n  viction relief. Later, in a second petition for state postconviction re\n  lief, Cone raised the claim that the State had violated Brady v. Mary\n  land, 373 U. S. 83, by suppressing witness statements and police\n  reports that would have corroborated his insanity defense and bol\n  stered his case in mitigation of the death penalty. The postconviction\n  court denied him a hearing on the ground that the Brady claim had\n  been previously determined, either on direct appeal or in earlier col\n  lateral proceedings. The State Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed.\n  Cone then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal Dis\n  trict Court. That Court denied relief, holding the Brady claim proce\n  durally barred because the state courts’ disposition rested on ade\n  quate and independent state grounds: Cone had waived it by failing\n  to present his claim in state court. Even if he had not defaulted the\n  claim, ruled the court, it would fail on its merits because none of the\n  withheld evidence would have cast doubt on his guilt. The Sixth Cir\n  cuit agreed with the latter conclusion, but considered itself barred\n  from reaching the claim’s merits because the state courts had ruled\n  the claim previously determined or waived under state law.\nHeld:\n    1. The state courts’ rejection of Cone’s Brady claim does not rest on\n a ground that bars federal review. Neither of the State’s asserted\n justifications for such a bar—that the claim was decided by the State\n Supreme Court on direct review or that Cone had waived it by never\n properly raising it in state court—provides an independent and ade\n2                             CONE v. BELL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    quate state ground for denying review of Cone’s federal claim. The\n    state postconviction court’s denial of the Brady claim on the ground it\n    had been previously determined in state court rested on a false prem\n    ise: Cone had not presented the claim in earlier proceedings and, con\n    sequently, the state courts had not passed on it. The Sixth Circuit’s\n    rejection of the claim as procedurally defaulted because it had been\n    twice presented to the Tennessee courts was thus erroneous. Also\n    unpersuasive is the State’s alternative argument that federal review\n    is barred because the Brady claim was properly dismissed by the\n    state postconviction courts as waived. Those courts held only that\n    the claim had been previously determined, and this Court will not\n    second-guess their judgment. Because the claim was properly pre\n    served and exhausted in state court, it is not defaulted. Pp. 15–19.\n       2. The lower federal courts failed to adequately consider whether\n    the withheld documents were material to Cone’s sentence. Both the\n    quantity and quality of the suppressed evidence lend support to\n    Cone’s trial position that he habitually used excessive amounts of\n    drugs, that his addiction affected his behavior during the murders,\n    and that the State’s contrary arguments were false and misleading.\n    Nevertheless, even when viewed in the light most favorable to Cone,\n    the evidence does not sustain his insanity defense: His behavior be\n    fore, during, and after the crimes was inconsistent with the conten\n    tion that he lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the\n    wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform it to the requirements of\n    law. Because the likelihood that the suppressed evidence would have\n    affected the jury’s verdict on the insanity issue is remote, the Sixth\n    Circuit did not err by denying habeas relief on the ground that such\n    evidence was immaterial to the jury’s guilt finding. The same cannot\n    be said of that court’s summary treatment of Cone’s claim that the\n    suppressed evidence would have influenced the jury’s sentencing rec\n    ommendation. Because the suppressed evidence might have been\n    material to the jury’s assessment of the proper punishment, a full re\n    view of that evidence and its effect on the sentencing verdict is war\n    ranted.

S. 83 (1963), we held that when a State sup\npresses evidence favorable to an accused that is material\nto guilt or to punishment, the State violates the defen\ndant’s right to due process, “irrespective of the good faith\nor bad faith of the prosecution.” Id., at 87.\n  In this case, Gary Cone, a Vietnam veteran sentenced to\ndeath, contends that the State of Tennessee violated his\nright to due process by suppressing witness statements\nand police reports that would have corroborated his trial\ndefense and bolstered his case in mitigation of the death\npenalty. At his trial in 1982, Cone asserted an insanity\ndefense, contending that he had killed two people while\nsuffering from acute amphetamine psychosis, a disorder\n2                      CONE v. BELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncaused by drug addiction. The State of Tennessee discred\nited that defense, alleging that Cone’s drug addiction was\n“baloney.” Ten years later, Cone learned that the State\nhad suppressed evidence supporting his claim of drug\naddiction.\n   Cone presented his new evidence to the state courts in a\npetition for postconviction relief, but the Tennessee courts\ndenied him a hearing on the ground that his Brady claim\nhad been “previously determined,” either on direct appeal\nfrom his conviction or in earlier collateral proceedings. On\napplication for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28\nU. S. C. §2254, the Federal District Court concluded that\nthe state courts’ disposition rested on an adequate and\nindependent state ground that barred further review in\nfederal court, and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Cir\ncuit agreed. Doubt concerning the correctness of that\nholding, coupled with conflicting decisions from other\nCourts of Appeals, prompted our grant of certiorari.\n   After a complete review of the trial and postconviction\nproceedings, we conclude that the Tennessee courts’ rejec\ntion of petitioner’s Brady claim does not rest on a ground\nthat bars federal review. Furthermore, although the\nDistrict Court and the Court of Appeals passed briefly on\nthe merits of Cone’s claim, neither court distinguished the\nmateriality of the suppressed evidence with respect to\nCone’s guilt from the materiality of the evidence with\nrespect to his punishment. While we agree that the with\nheld documents were not material to the question whether\nCone committed murder with the requisite mental state,\nthe lower courts failed to adequately consider whether\nthat same evidence was material to Cone’s sentence.\nTherefore, we vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals\nand remand the case to the District Court to determine in\nthe first instance whether there is a reasonable probability\nthat the withheld evidence would have altered at least one\njuror’s assessment of the appropriate penalty for Cone’s\n                    Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncrimes.\n                             I\n  On the afternoon of Saturday, August 10, 1980, Cone\nrobbed a jewelry store in downtown Memphis, Tennessee.\nFleeing the scene by car, he led police on a high-speed\nchase into a residential neighborhood. Once there, he\nabandoned his vehicle and shot a police officer.1 When a\nbystander tried to impede his escape, Cone shot him, too,\nbefore escaping on foot.\n  A short time later, Cone tried to hijack a nearby car.\nWhen that attempt failed (because the driver refused to\nsurrender his keys), Cone tried to shoot the driver and a\nhovering police helicopter before realizing he had run out\nof ammunition. He then fled the scene. Although police\nconducted a thorough search, Cone was nowhere to be\nfound.\n  Early the next morning, Cone reappeared in the same\nneighborhood at the door of an elderly woman. He asked\nto use her telephone, and when she refused, he drew a\ngun. Before he was able to gain entry, the woman\nslammed the door and called the police. By the time offi\ncers arrived, however, Cone had once again disappeared.\n  That afternoon, Cone gained entry to the home of 93\nyear-old Shipley Todd and his wife, 79-year-old Cleopatra\nTodd. Cone beat the couple to death with a blunt instru\nment and ransacked the first floor of their home. Later,\nhe shaved his beard and escaped to the airport without\nbeing caught. Cone then traveled to Florida, where he\nwas arrested several days later after robbing a drugstore\nin Pompano Beach.\n  A Tennessee grand jury charged Cone with two counts\n——————\n  1 From  the abandoned vehicle, police recovered stolen jewelry, large\nquantities of illegal and prescription drugs, and approximately $2,400\nin cash. Much of the cash was later connected to a grocery store rob\nbery that had occurred on the previous day.\n4                      CONE v. BELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof first-degree murder, two counts of murder in the perpe\ntration of a burglary, three counts of assault with intent to\nmurder, and one count of robbery by use of deadly force.\nAt his jury trial in 1982, Cone did not challenge the over\nwhelming physical and testimonial evidence supporting\nthe charges against him. His sole defense was that he was\nnot guilty by reason of insanity.\n  Cone’s counsel portrayed his client as suffering from\nsevere drug addiction attributable to trauma Cone had\nexperienced in Vietnam. Counsel argued that Cone had\ncommitted his crimes while suffering from chronic am\nphetamine psychosis, a disorder brought about by his drug\nabuse. That defense was supported by the testimony of\nthree witnesses. First was Cone’s mother, who described\nher son as an honorably discharged Vietnam veteran who\nhad changed following his return from service. She re\ncalled Cone describing “how terrible” it had been to handle\nthe bodies of dead soldiers, and she explained that Cone\nslept restlessly and sometimes “holler[ed]” in his sleep.\nTr. 1643–1645 (Apr. 20, 1982). She also described one\noccasion, following Cone’s return from service, when a\npackage was shipped to him that contained marijuana.\nBefore the war, she asserted, Cone had not used drugs of\nany kind.\n  Two expert witnesses testified on Cone’s behalf. Mat\nthew Jaremko, a clinical psychologist, testified that Cone\nsuffered from substance abuse and posttraumatic stress\ndisorders related to his military service in Vietnam. Ja\nremko testified that Cone had expressed remorse for the\nmurders, and he opined that Cone’s mental disorder ren\ndered him substantially incapable of conforming his con\nduct to the law. Jonathan Lipman, a neuropharmacolo\ngist, recounted at length Cone’s history of illicit drug use,\nwhich began after Cone joined the Army and escalated to\nthe point where Cone was consuming “rather horrific”\nquantities of drugs daily. App. 100. According to Lipman,\n                    Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                  5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nCone’s drug abuse had led to chronic amphetamine psy\nchosis, a disorder manifested through hallucinations and\nongoing paranoia that prevented Cone from obeying the\nlaw and appreciating the wrongfulness of his actions.\n   In rebutting Cone’s insanity defense the State’s strategy\nthroughout trial was to present Cone as a calculating,\nintelligent criminal who was fully in control of his deci\nsions and actions at the time of the crimes. A key compo\nnent of that strategy involved discrediting Cone’s claims of\ndrug use.2 Through cross-examination, the State estab\nlished that both defense experts’ opinions were based\nsolely on Cone’s representations to them about his drug\nuse rather than on any independently corroborated\nsources, such as medical records or interviews with family\nor friends. The prosecution also adduced expert and lay\ntestimony to establish that Cone was not addicted to drugs\nand had acted rationally and intentionally before, during,\nand after the Todd murders.\n   Particularly damaging to Cone’s defense was the testi\nmony of rebuttal witness Ilene Blankman, who had spent\ntime with Cone several months before the murders and at\nwhose home Cone had stayed in the days leading up to his\narrest in Florida. Blankman admitted to being a former\nheroin addict but testified that she no longer used drugs\nand tried to stay away from people who did. She testified\nthat she had never seen Cone use drugs, had never ob\nserved track marks on his body, and had never seen him\nexhibit signs of paranoia.\n   Emphasizing the State’s position with respect to Cone’s\n——————\n  2 The State also cast doubt on Cone’s defense by eliciting testimony\n\nthat Cone had enrolled in college following his return from Vietnam\nand had graduated with high honors. Later, after serving time in\nprison for an armed robbery, Cone gained admission to the University\nof Arkansas Law School. The State suggested that Cone’s academic\nsuccess provided further proof that he was not impaired following his\nreturn from war.\n6                           CONE v. BELL\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nalleged addiction, the prosecutor told the jury during\nclosing argument, “[Y]ou’re not dealing with a crazy per\nson, an insane man. A man . . . out of his mind. You’re\ndealing, I submit to you, with a premeditated, cool, delib\nerate—and even cowardly, really—murderer.” Tr. 2084\n(Apr. 22, 1982). Pointing to the quantity of drugs found in\nCone’s car, the prosecutor suggested that far from being a\ndrug addict, Cone was actually a drug dealer. The prose\ncutor argued, “I’m not trying to be absurd, but he says he’s\na drug addict. I say baloney. He’s a drug seller. Doesn’t\nthe proof show that?” Id., at 107.3\n   The jury rejected Cone’s insanity defense and found him\nguilty on all counts. At the penalty hearing, the prosecu\ntion asked the jury to find that Cone’s crime met the crite\nria for four different statutory aggravating factors, any\none of which would render him eligible for a capital sen\ntence.4 Cone’s counsel called no witnesses but instead\nrested on the evidence adduced during the guilt phase\nproceedings. Acknowledging that the prosecution’s ex\nperts had disputed the existence of Cone’s alleged mental\ndisorder, counsel nevertheless urged the jury to consider\nCone’s drug addiction when weighing the aggravating and\n——————\n  3 In his closing rebuttal argument, the prosecutor continued to press\n\nthe point, asserting: “There aren’t any charges for drug sales, but that\ndoesn’t mean that you can’t look and question in deciding whether or\nnot this man was, in fact, a drug user, or why he had those drugs. Did\nhe just have those drugs, or did he have those drugs and thousands of\ndollars in that car? Among those drugs are there only the drugs he\nused? How do we know if he used drugs? The only thing that we ever\nhad that he used drugs, period, is the fact that those drugs were in the\ncar and what he told people. What he told people. But according to\neven what he told people, there are drugs in there he didn’t even use.”\nTr. 2068 (Apr. 22, 1982).\n  4 The jury could impose a capital sentence only if it unanimously\n\ndetermined that one or more statutory aggravating circumstances had\nbeen proved by the State beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the\nmitigating circumstances of the case did not outweigh any statutory\naggravating factors.

Among those was a claim\nthat the prosecution violated state law by failing to dis\nclose a tape-recorded statement and police reports relating\nto several trial witnesses. See App. 114–117. The Ten\nnessee Supreme Court rejected each of Cone’s claims, and\naffirmed his conviction and sentence. State v. Cone, 665\nS. W. 2d 87 (1984).7 Cone then filed a petition for postcon\n——————\n   5 As defense counsel emphasized to the jury, one of the statutory miti\n\ngating factors it was required to consider was whether “[t]he capacity of\nthe defendant to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to\nconform his conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially\nimpaired as a result of mental disease or defect or intoxication which\nwas insufficient to establish a defense to the crime but which substan\ntially affected his judgment.” §39–2404(j)(8).\n   6 Specifically, the jury found Cone had committed one or more prior\n\nfelonies involving the use or threat of violence, see §39–2404(i)(2); the\nmurders had been committed for the purpose of avoiding, interfering\nwith, or preventing Cone’s lawful arrest or prosecution, see §39–\n2404(i)(6); the murders were especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel in\nthat they involved torture and depravity of mind, see §39–2404(i)(5);\nand Cone had knowingly created a risk of death to two or more persons,\nother than the victim murdered, during his act of murder, see §39–\n2404(i)(3). The Tennessee Supreme Court later observed that by\nfinding Cone guilty of murder in the first degree during the perpetra\ntion of a burglary, the jury implicitly found the existence of an addi\ntional statutory aggravating factor: that the murders occurred while\nCone was committing a burglary, §39–2404(i)(7). State v. Cone, 665\nS. W. 2d 87, 94 (1984).\n   7 In summarizing the trial proceedings the Tennessee Supreme Court\n\nobserved: “The only defense interposed on [Cone’s] behalf was that of\ninsanity, or lack of mental capacity, due to drug abuse and to stress\narising out of his previous service in the Vietnamese war, some eleven\nyears prior to the events involved in this case. This proved to be a\ntenuous defense, at best, since neither of the expert witnesses who\n8                            CONE v.

Cone\nv. State, 747 S. W. 2d 353.\n   In 1989, Cone, acting pro se, filed a second petition for\npostconviction relief, raising myriad claims of error.\nAmong these was a claim that the State had failed to\ndisclose evidence in violation of his rights under the\nUnited States Constitution. At the State’s behest, the\npostconviction court summarily denied the petition, con\ncluding that all the claims raised in it had either been\n“previously determined” or “waived.” Order Dismissing\nPetition for Post-Conviction Relief in Cone v. State, No. P–\n06874 (Crim. Ct. Shelby Cty., Tenn., Jan. 2, 1990).8 At\nthat time, the court did not specify which claims fell into\nwhich category.\n   Cone appealed the denial of his petition to the Tennes\nsee Court of Criminal Appeals, asserting that the postcon\nviction court had erred by dismissing 13 claims—his\n——————\ntestified on his behalf had ever seen or heard of him until a few weeks\nprior to the trial.

Code Ann. §40–30–105 (1982); see also\n§40–30–102. Any hearing on a petition for postconviction relief was\nlimited, however, to claims that had not been “waived or previously\ndetermined.” See §40–30–111. A ground for relief was “previously\ndetermined” if “a court of competent jurisdiction ha[d] ruled on the\nmerits [of the claim] after a full and fair hearing.” §40–30–112(a). The\nclaim was waived “if the petitioner knowingly and understandingly\nfailed to present it for determination in any proceeding before a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction in which the ground could have been presented.”\n§40–30–112(b)(1).\n                    Cite as: 556 U.

Id., at\n24.9 The court agreed and remanded the case for further\nproceedings.\n  On remand counsel was appointed and an amended\npetition was filed. The State once again urged the post\nconviction court to dismiss Cone’s petition. Apparently\nconflating the state-law disclosure claim Cone had raised\non direct appeal with his newly filed Brady claim, the\nState represented that the Tennessee Supreme Court had\nalready decided the Brady issue and that Cone was there\nfore barred from relitigating it. See App. 15–16.\n  While that petition remained pending before the post\nconviction court, the Tennessee Court of Appeals held for\nthe first time that the State’s Public Records Act allowed a\ncriminal defendant to review the prosecutor’s file in his\ncase. See Capital Case Resource Center of Tenn., Inc. v.\nWoodall, No. 01–A–01–9104–CH–00150, 1992 WL 12217\n(Jan. 29, 1992). Based on that holding, Cone obtained\naccess to the prosecutor’s files, in which he found proof\nthat evidence had indeed been withheld from him at trial.\nAmong the undisclosed documents Cone discovered were\nstatements from witnesses who had seen him several days\nbefore and several days after the murders. The witnesses\ndescribed Cone’s appearance as “wild eyed,” App. 50, and\n——————\n  9 See Swanson v. State, 749 S. W. 2d 731, 734 (Tenn. 1988) (courts\n\nshould not dismiss postconviction petitions on technical grounds unless\nthe petitioner has first had “reasonable opportunity, with aid of coun\nsel, to file amendments” and rebut presumption of waiver (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n10                          CONE v. BELL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhis behavior as “real weird,” id., at 49. One witness af\nfirmed that Cone had appeared “to be drunk or high.”\nIbid. The file also contained a police report describing\nCone’s arrest in Florida following the murders. In that\nreport, a police officer described Cone looking around “in a\nfrenzied manner,” and “walking in [an] agitated manner”\nprior to his apprehension. Id., at 53. Multiple police\nbulletins describing Cone as a “drug user” and a “heavy\ndrug user” were also among the undisclosed evidence. See\nid., at 55–59.\n   With the newly discovered evidence in hand, Cone\namended his postconviction petition once again in October\n1993, expanding his Brady claim to allege more specifi\ncally that the State had withheld exculpatory evidence\ndemonstrating that he “did in fact suffer drug problems\nand/or drug withdrawal or psychosis both at the time of\nthe offense and in the past.” App. at 20. Cone pointed to\nspecific examples of evidence that had been withheld,\nalleging the evidence was “exculpatory to both the jury’s\ndetermination of petitioner’s guilt and its consideration of\nthe proper sentence,” and that there was “a reasonable\nprobability that, had the evidence not been withheld, the\njurors would not have convicted [him] and would not have\nsentenced him to death.” Id., at 20–21.10 In a lengthy\naffidavit submitted with his amended petition, Cone ex\nplained that he had not raised his Brady claim in earlier\nproceedings because the facts underlying it “ha[d] been\nrevealed through disclosure of the State’s files, which\noccurred after the first post-conviction proceeding.” App.\n18.\n   After denying Cone’s request for an evidentiary hearing,\n——————\n  10 As examples of evidence that had been withheld, Cone pointed to\n\n“statements of Charles and Debbie Slaughter, statements of Sue Cone,\nstatements of Lucille Tuech, statements of Herschel Dalton, and\npatrolman Collins” and “statements contained in official police reports.”\nApp. 20.\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

Many of the claims were\ndismissed on the ground that they had been waived by\nCone’s failure to raise them in earlier proceedings; how\never, consistent with the position urged by the State, the\ncourt dismissed many others, including the Brady claim,\nas mere “re-statements of previous grounds heretofore\ndetermined and denied by the Tennessee Supreme Court\nupon Direct Appeal or the Court of Criminal Appeals upon\nthe First Petition.” App. 22.\n  Noting that “the findings of the trial court in post\nconviction hearings are conclusive on appeal unless the\nevidence preponderates against the judgment,” the Ten\nnessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. Cone v. State,\n927 S. W. 2d 579, 581–582 (1995). The court concluded\nthat Cone had “failed to rebut the presumption of waiver\nas to all claims raised in his second petition for post\nconviction relief which had not been previously deter\nmined.” Id., at 582 (emphasis added). Cone unsuccess\nfully petitioned for review in the Tennessee Supreme\nCourt, and we denied certiorari. Cone v. Tennessee, 519\nU. S. 934 (1996).\n                               III\n    In 1997, Cone filed a petition for a federal writ of habeas\ncorpus. Without disclosing to the District Court the con\ntrary position it had taken in the state-court proceedings,\nthe State acknowledged that Cone’s Brady claim had not\nbeen raised prior to the filing of his second postconviction\npetition. However, wrenching out of context the state\nappellate court’s holding that Cone had “waived ‘all claims\n. . . which had not been previously determined,’ ” the State\nnow asserted the Brady claim had been waived. App. 39\n(quoting Cone, 927 S. W. 2d, at 581–582).\n    In May 1998, the District Court denied Cone’s request\nfor an evidentiary hearing on his Brady claim. Lamenting\n12                      CONE v. BELL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat its consideration of Cone’s claims had been “made\nmore difficult” by the parties’ failure to articulate the state\nprocedural rules under which each of Cone’s claims had\nallegedly been defaulted, App. to Pet. for Cert. 98a, the\nDistrict Court nevertheless held that the Brady claim was\nprocedurally barred. After parsing the claim into 11\nseparate subclaims based on 11 pieces of withheld evi\ndence identified in the habeas petition, the District Court\nconcluded that Cone had waived each subclaim by failing\nto present or adequately develop it in state court. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 112a–113a. Moreover, the court concluded\nthat even if Cone had not defaulted his Brady claim, it\nwould fail on its merits because none of the withheld\nevidence would have cast doubt on Cone’s guilt. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 116a–119a. Throughout its opinion the\nDistrict Court repeatedly referenced factual allegations\ncontained in early versions of Cone’s second petition for\npostconviction relief rather than the amended version of\nthe petition upon which the state court’s decision had\nrested. See, e.g., id., at 112a.\n   After the District Court dismissed the remainder of\nCone’s federal claims, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth\nCircuit granted him permission to appeal several issues,\nincluding the alleged suppression of Brady material.\nBefore the Court of Appeals, the State shifted its proce\ndural default argument once more, this time contending\nthat Cone had “simply never raised” his Brady claim in\nthe state court because he failed to make adequate factual\nallegations to support that claim in his second petition for\npostconviction relief. App. 41. Repeating the District\nCourt’s error, the State directed the Court of Appeals’\nattention to Cone’s pro se petition and to the petition\nCone’s counsel filed before he gained access to the prosecu\ntion’s case file. Id., at 41–42, and n. 7. In other words,\ninstead of citing the October 1993 amended petition on\nwhich the state court’s decision had been based and to\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Cone v. Bell,\n243 F. 3d 961, 968 (2001). The court acknowledged that\nCone had raised his Brady claim. 243 F. 3d, at 969. Nev\nertheless, the court considered itself barred from reaching\nthe merits of the claim because the Tennessee courts had\nconcluded the claim was “previously determined or waived\nunder Tenn. Code Ann. §40–30–112.” Ibid.\n   Briefly mentioning several isolated pieces of suppressed\nevidence, the court summarily concluded that even if\nCone’s Brady claim had not been defaulted, the sup\npressed evidence would not undermine confidence in the\nverdict (and hence was not Brady material) “because of\nthe overwhelming evidence of Cone’s guilt.” 243 F. 3d, at\n968. The court did not discuss whether any of the undis\nclosed evidence was material with respect to Cone’s sen\ntencing proceedings.\n   Although the Court of Appeals rejected Cone’s Brady\nclaim, it held that he was entitled to have his death sen\ntence vacated because of his counsel’s ineffective assis\ntance at sentencing. See 243 F. 3d, at 975. In 2002, this\nCourt reversed that holding after concluding that the\nTennessee courts’ rejection of Cone’s ineffective\nassistance-of-counsel claim was not “objectively unreason\nable” within the meaning of the Antiterrorism and Effec\ntive Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). See Bell v. Cone,\n535 U. S. 685, 699.\n   In 2004, following our remand, the Court of Appeals\nagain entered judgment ordering a new sentencing hear\ning, this time based on the purported invalidity of an\naggravating circumstance found by the jury.

This time, the court divided\nthe claim into four separate subclaims: “(1) evidence re\ngarding [Cone’s] drug use; (2) evidence that might have\nbeen useful to impeach the testimony and credibility of\nprosecution witness Sergeant Ralph Roby; (3) FBI re\nports;[11] and (4) evidence showing that prosecution wit\nness Ilene Blankman was untruthful and biased.” 492 F.\n3d 743, 753 (2007). Noting that it had previously found all\nfour subclaims to be procedurally defaulted, the court\ndeclined to reconsider its earlier decision. See ibid. (citing\nCone, 243 F. 3d, at 968–970). At the same time, the court\nreiterated that the withheld evidence “would not have\novercome the overwhelming evidence of Cone’s guilt in\ncommitting a brutal double murder and the persuasive\ntestimony that Cone was not under the influence of\ndrugs.” 492 F. 3d, at 756. Summarily discounting Cone’s\ncontention that the withheld evidence was material with\nrespect to his sentence, the court concluded that the intro\nduction of the suppressed evidence would not have altered\nthe jurors’ finding that Cone’s alleged drug use did not\n“vitiate his specific intent to murder his victims and did\nnot mitigate his culpability sufficient to avoid the death\nsentence.” Id., at 757.\n  Judge Merritt dissented. He castigated the State not\nonly for withholding documents relevant to Cone’s sole\ndefense and plea for mitigation, but also for its “falsifica\n——————\n  11 In the course of federal habeas proceedings, Cone had obtained\n\naccess to files from the Federal Bureau of Investigation where he found\nadditional previously undisclosed evidence not contained in the state\nprosecutor’s case file. The suppressed FBI documents make repeated\nreference to Cone’s drug use and corroborate his expert’s representation\nthat he had used drugs during his prior incarceration for armed rob\nbery.

Over the dissent of seven judges, Cone’s petition for\nrehearing en banc was denied. 505 F. 3d 610 (2007).\n   We granted certiorari, 554 U. S. ___ (2008), to answer\nthe question whether a federal habeas claim is “proce\ndurally defaulted” when it is twice presented to the state\ncourts.\n                              IV\n   During the state and federal proceedings below, the\nState of Tennessee offered two different justifications for\ndenying review of the merits of Cone’s Brady claim. First,\nin connection with Cone’s amended petition for state\npostconviction relief, the State argued that the Brady\nclaim was barred because it had been decided on direct\nappeal. See App. 15–16. Then, in connection with Cone’s\nfederal habeas petition, the State argued that Cone’s claim\nwas waived because it had never been properly raised\nbefore the state courts. See id., at 39. The District Court\nand the Court of Appeals agreed that Cone’s claim was\nprocedurally barred, but for different reasons. The Dis\ntrict Court held that the claim had been waived, App. to\nPet. for Cert. 102a, while the Court of Appeals held that\nthe claim had been either waived or previously deter\nmined, Cone, 243 F. 3d, at 969. We now conclude that\nneither prior determination nor waiver provides an inde\npendent and adequate state ground for denying Cone\nreview of his federal claim.\n   It is well established that federal courts will not review\nquestions of federal law presented in a habeas petition\nwhen the state court’s decision rests upon a state-law\nground that “is independent of the federal question and\nadequate to support the judgment.” Coleman v. Thomp\nson, 501 U. S. 722, 729 (1991); Lee v. Kemna, 534 U. S.\n362, 375 (2002). In the context of federal habeas proceed\n16                      CONE v. BELL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nings, the independent and adequate state ground doctrine\nis designed to “ensur[e] that the States’ interest in correct\ning their own mistakes is respected in all federal habeas\ncases.” Coleman, 501 U. S., at 732. When a petitioner\nfails to properly raise his federal claims in state court, he\ndeprives the State of “an opportunity to address those\nclaims in the first instance” and frustrates the State’s\nability to honor his constitutional rights. Id., at 732, 748.\nTherefore, consistent with the longstanding requirement\nthat habeas petitioners must exhaust available state\nremedies before seeking relief in federal court, we have\nheld that when a petitioner fails to raise his federal claims\nin compliance with relevant state procedural rules, the\nstate court’s refusal to adjudicate the claim ordinarily\nqualifies as an independent and adequate state ground for\ndenying federal review. See id., at 731.\n   That does not mean, however, that federal habeas re\nview is barred every time a state court invokes a proce\ndural rule to limit its review of a state prisoner’s claims.\nWe have recognized that “ ‘the adequacy of state proce\ndural bars to the assertion of federal questions’ . . . is not\nwithin the State’s prerogative finally to decide; rather,\nadequacy ‘is itself a federal question.’ ” Lee, 534 U. S., at\n375 (quoting Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 415, 422\n(1965)); see also Coleman, 501 U. S., at 736 (“[F]ederal\nhabeas courts must ascertain for themselves if the peti\ntioner is in custody pursuant to a state court judgment\nthat rests on independent and adequate state grounds”).\nThe question before us now is whether federal review of\nCone’s Brady claim is procedurally barred either because\nthe claim was twice presented to the state courts or be\ncause it was waived, and thus not presented at all.\n   First, we address the contention that the repeated pres\nentation of a claim in state court bars later federal review.\nThe Tennessee postconviction court denied Cone’s Brady\nclaim after concluding it had been previously determined\n                    Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                 17\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nfollowing a full and fair hearing in state court. See Tenn.\nCode Ann. §40–30–112(a) (1982). That conclusion rested\non a false premise: Contrary to the state courts’ finding,\nCone had not presented his Brady claim in earlier pro\nceedings and, consequently, the state courts had not\npassed on it. The Sixth Circuit recognized that Cone’s\nBrady claim had not been decided on direct appeal, see\nCone, 243 F. 3d, at 969, but felt constrained by the state\ncourts’ refusal to reach the merits of that claim on post\nconviction review. The Court of Appeals concluded that\nbecause the state postconviction courts had applied a state\nprocedural law to avoid reaching the merits of Cone’s\nBrady claim, “an ‘independent and adequate’ state\nground” barred federal habeas review. 243 F. 3d, at 969.\nIn this Court the State does not defend that aspect of the\nCourt of Appeals’ holding, and rightly so.\n   When a state court declines to review the merits of a\npetitioner’s claim on the ground that it has done so al\nready, it creates no bar to federal habeas review. In Ylst\nv. Nunnemaker, 501 U. S. 797, 804, n. 3 (1991), we ob\nserved in passing that when a state court declines to\nrevisit a claim it has already adjudicated, the effect of the\nlater decision upon the availability of federal habeas is\n“nil” because “a later state decision based upon ineligibil\nity for further state review neither rests upon procedural\ndefault nor lifts a pre-existing procedural default.”12\nWhen a state court refuses to readjudicate a claim on the\nground that it has been previously determined, the court’s\n——————\n  12 With the exception of the Sixth Circuit, all Courts of Appeals to\nhave directly confronted the question both before and after Ylst, 501\nU. S. 797, have agreed that a state court’s successive rejection of a\nfederal claim does not bar federal habeas review. See, e.g., Page v.\nFrank, 343 F. 3d 901, 907 (CA7 2003); Brecheen v. Reynolds, 41 F. 3d\n1343, 1358 (CA10 1994); Bennett v. Whitley, 41 F. 3d 1581, 1582 (CA5\n1994); Silverstein v. Henderson, 706 F. 2d 361, 368 (CA2 1983). See\nalso Lambright v. Stewart, 241 F. 3d 1201, 1206 (CA9 2001).\n18                          CONE v. BELL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndecision does not indicate that the claim has been proce\ndurally defaulted. To the contrary, it provides strong\nevidence that the claim has already been given full consid\neration by the state courts and thus is ripe for federal\nadjudication. See 28 U. S. C. §2254(b)(1)(A) (permitting\nissuance of a writ of habeas corpus only after “the appli\ncant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of\nthe State”).\n  A claim is procedurally barred when it has not been\nfairly presented to the state courts for their initial consid\neration—not when the claim has been presented more\nthan once. Accordingly, insofar as the Court of Appeals\nrejected Cone’s Brady claim as procedurally defaulted\nbecause the claim had been twice presented to the Ten\nnessee courts, its decision was erroneous.\n  As an alternative (and contradictory) ground for barring\nreview of Cone’s Brady claim, the State has argued that\nCone’s claim was properly dismissed by the state postcon\nviction court on the ground it had been waived. We are\nnot persuaded. The state appellate court affirmed the\ndenial of Cone’s Brady claim on the same mistaken ground\noffered by the lower court—that the claim had been previ\nously determined.13 Contrary to the State’s assertion, the\n——————\n  13 As recounted earlier, Cone’s state postconviction petition contained\nnumerous claims of error. The state postconviction court dismissed\nsome of those claims as waived and others, including the Brady claim,\nas having been previously determined. In affirming the denial of\nCone’s petition the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals summarily\nstated that Cone had “failed to rebut the presumption of waiver as to\nall claims raised in his second petition for post-conviction relief which\nhad not been previously determined.” Cone v. State, 927 S. W. 2d 579,\n582 (1995). Pointing to that language, the State asserts that the\nTennessee Court of Criminal Appeals denied Cone’s Brady claim not\nbecause it had been previously determined, but because it was waived\nin the postconviction court proceedings. Not so. Without questioning\nthe trial court’s finding that Cone’s Brady claim had been previously\ndetermined, the Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the denial of\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    19\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nTennessee appellate court did not hold that Cone’s Brady\nclaim was waived.\n  When a state court declines to find that a claim has\nbeen waived by a petitioner’s alleged failure to comply\nwith state procedural rules, our respect for the state-court\njudgment counsels us to do the same. Although we have\nan independent duty to scrutinize the application of state\nrules that bar our review of federal claims, Lee, 534 U. S.,\nat 375, we have no concomitant duty to apply state proce\ndural bars where state courts have themselves declined to\ndo so. The Tennessee courts did not hold that Cone\nwaived his Brady claim, and we will not second-guess\ntheir judgment.14\n——————\nCone’s postconviction petition in its entirety. Nothing in that decision\nsuggests the appellate court believed the Brady claim had been waived\nin the court below.\n  Similarly, while JUSTICE ALITO’s parsing of the record persuades him\nthat Cone failed to adequately raise his Brady claim to the Tennessee\nCourt of Criminal Appeals, he does not argue that the court expressly\nheld that Cone waived the claim. A review of Cone’s opening brief\nreveals that he made a broad challenge to the postconviction court’s\ndismissal of his petition and plainly asserted that the court erred by\ndismissing claims as previously determined on direct appeal or in his\ninitial postconviction petition. See Brief for Petitioner-Appellant in No.\n02–C–01–9403–CR–00052 (Tenn. Crim. App.), pp. 7, 14. The state\nappellate court did not state or suggest that Cone had waived his Brady\nclaim. Rather, after commending the postconviction court for its\n“exemplary and meticulous treatment of the appellant’s petition,” Cone,\n927 S. W. 2d, at 581, the appellate court simply adopted without\nmodification the lower court’s findings with respect to the application of\nTenn. Code Ann. §40–30–112 to the facts of this case. The best reading\nof the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals’ decision is that it was\nbased on an approval of the postconviction court’s reasoning rather\nthan on an unmentioned failure by Cone to adequately challenge the\ndismissal of his Brady claim on appeal.\n  14 Setting aside the state courts’ mistaken belief that Cone’s Brady\n\nclaim had been previously determined, there are many reasons the\nstate courts might have rejected the State’s waiver argument. The\nrecord establishes that the suppressed documents which form the basis\nfor Cone’s claim were not available to him until the Tennessee Court of\n20                          CONE v. BELL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  The State’s procedural objections to federal review of the\nmerits of Cone’s claim have resulted in a significant delay\nin bringing this unusually protracted case to a conclusion.\nUltimately, however, they provide no obstacle to judicial\nreview. Cone properly preserved and exhausted his Brady\nclaim in the state court; therefore, it is not defaulted. We\nturn now to the merits of that claim.\n                             V\n  Although the State is obliged to “prosecute with ear\nnestness and vigor,” it “is as much [its] duty to refrain\nfrom improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful\nconviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring\nabout a just one.” Berger, 295 U. S., at 88. Accordingly,\nwe have held that when the State withholds from a crimi\nnal defendant evidence that is material to his guilt or\npunishment, it violates his right to due process of law in\nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Brady, 373\nU. S., at 87. In United States v. Bagley, 473 U. S. 667, 682\n(1985) (opinion of Blackmun, J.), we explained that evi\ndence is “material” within the meaning of Brady when\nthere is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence\nbeen disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have\nbeen different. In other words, favorable evidence is sub\nject to constitutionally mandated disclosure when it “could\nreasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a differ\n——————\nAppeals’ 1992 decision interpreting the State’s Public Records Act as\nauthorizing the disclosure of prosecutorial records. Soon after obtain\ning access to the prosecutor’s file and discovering within it documents\nthat had not been disclosed prior to trial, Cone amended his petition for\npostconviction relief, adding detailed allegations regarding the sup\npressed evidence recovered from the file, along with an affidavit ex\nplaining the reason why his claim had not been filed sooner. See App.\n13, 18. The State did not oppose the amendment of Cone’s petition on\nthe ground that it was untimely, and it appears undisputed that there\nwould have been no basis under state law for doing so.

S. 263, 290 (1999).15\n  The documents suppressed by the State vary in kind,\nbut they share a common feature: Each strengthens the\ninference that Cone was impaired by his use of drugs\naround the time his crimes were committed. The sup\npressed evidence includes statements by witnesses ac\nknowledging that Cone appeared to be “drunk or high,”\nApp. 49, “acted real weird,” ibid., and “looked wild eyed,”\nid., at 50, in the two days preceding the murders.16 It also\nincludes documents that could have been used to impeach\n——————\n  15 Although the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as\n\ninterpreted by Brady, only mandates the disclosure of material evi\ndence, the obligation to disclose evidence favorable to the defense may\narise more broadly under a prosecutor’s ethical or statutory obligations.\nSee Kyles, 514 U. S., at 437 (“[T]he rule in Bagley (and, hence, in\nBrady) requires less of the prosecution than the ABA Standards for\nCriminal Justice Prosecution Function and Defense Function 3–3.11(a)\n(3d ed. 1993)”). See also ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct\n3.8(d) (2008) (“The prosecutor in a criminal case shall” “make timely\ndisclosure to the defense of all evidence or information known to the\nprosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the\noffense, and, in connection with sentencing, disclose to the defense and\nto the tribunal all unprivileged mitigating information known to the\nprosecutor, except when the prosecutor is relieved of this responsibility\nby a protective order of the tribunal”). As we have often observed, the\nprudent prosecutor will err on the side of transparency, resolving\ndoubtful questions in favor of disclosure. See Kyles, 514 U. S., at 439;\nUnited States v. Bagley, 473 U. S. 667, 711, n. 4 (1985) (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting); United States v. Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 108 (1976).\n  16 The State contends that the statements were made by witnesses\n\nwho observed Cone during and immediately after he committed robber\nies; therefore, it is not surprising that Cone appeared less than “se\nrene.” See Brief for Respondent 46. Although a jury would have been\nfree to infer that Cone’s behavior was attributable to his criminal\nactivity, the evidence is also consistent with Cone’s assertion that he\nwas suffering from chronic amphetamine psychosis at the time of the\ncrimes.\n22                          CONE v. BELL\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwitnesses whose trial testimony cast doubt on Cone’s drug\naddiction. For example, Memphis police officer Ralph\nRoby testified at trial that Cone had no needle marks on\nhis body when he was arrested—an observation that\nbolstered the State’s argument that Cone was not a drug\nuser. The suppressed evidence reveals, however, that\nRoby authorized multiple teletypes to law enforcement\nagencies in the days following the murders in which he\ndescribed Cone as a “drug user” and a “heavy drug user.”\nSee id., at 55–58.17 A suppressed statement made by the\nchief of police of Cone’s hometown also describes Cone as a\nserious drug user. See Cone, 243 F. 3d, at 968. And un\ndisclosed notes of a police interview with Ilene Blankman\nconducted several days after the murders reveal discrep\nancies between her initial statement and her trial testi\nmony relevant to Cone’s alleged drug use. App. 72–73. In\nsum, both the quantity and the quality of the suppressed\nevidence lends support to Cone’s position at trial that he\nhabitually used excessive amounts of drugs, that his ad\ndiction affected his behavior during his crime spree, and\nthat the State’s arguments to the contrary were false and\nmisleading.\n  Thus, the federal question that must be decided is\nwhether the suppression of that probative evidence de\nprived Cone of his right to a fair trial. See Agurs, 427\n——————\n   17 As the dissent points out, Roby did not testify directly that Cone\n\nwas not a drug user and FBI Agent Eugene Flynn testified that, at the\ntime of Cone’s arrest in Pompano Beach, Cone reported that he had\nused cocaine, Dilaudid, and Demerol and was suffering from “slight\nwithdrawal symptoms.” See post, at 7, 11. See also Tr. 1916, 1920\n(Apr. 22, 1982). It is important to note, however, that neither Flynn\nnor Roby corroborated Cone’s account of alleged drug use. Taken in\ncontext, Roby’s statement that he had not observed any needle marks\non Cone’s body invited the jury to infer that Cone’s self-reported drug\nuse was either minimal or contrived. See id., at 1939. Therefore,\nalthough the suppressed evidence does not directly contradict Roby’s\ntrial testimony, it does place it in a different light.\n                    Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                  23\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S., at 108. Because the Tennessee courts did not reach\nthe merits of Cone’s Brady claim, federal habeas review is\nnot subject to the deferential standard that applies under\nAEDPA to “any claim that was adjudicated on the merits\nin State court proceedings.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d). Instead,\nthe claim is reviewed de novo. See, e.g., Rompilla v.\nBeard, 545 U. S. 374, 390 (2005) (de novo review where\nstate courts did not reach prejudice prong under Strick\nland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984)); Wiggins v.\nSmith, 539 U. S. 510, 534 (2003) (same).\n   Contending that the Federal District Court and Court of\nAppeals adequately and correctly resolved the merits of\nthat claim, the State urges us to affirm the Sixth Circuit’s\ndenial of habeas relief. In assessing the materiality of the\nevidence suppressed by the State, the Court of Appeals\nsuggested that two facts outweighed the potential force of\nthe suppressed evidence. First, the evidence of Cone’s\nguilt was overwhelming. Second, the evidence of Cone’s\ndrug use was cumulative because the jury had heard\nevidence of Cone’s alleged addiction from witnesses and\nfrom officers who interviewed Cone and recovered drugs\nfrom his vehicle.18 The Court of Appeals did not thor\noughly review the suppressed evidence or consider what\nits cumulative effect on the jury would have been. More\nover, in concluding that the suppressed evidence was not\nmaterial within the meaning of Brady, the court did not\ndistinguish between the materiality of the evidence with\nrespect to guilt and the materiality of the evidence with\nrespect to punishment—an omission we find significant.\n   Evidence that is material to guilt will often be material\n——————\n  18 In pointing to the trial evidence of Cone’s drug use, the Court of\n\nAppeals made no mention of the fact that the State had discredited the\ntestimony of Cone’s experts on the ground that no independent evi\ndence corroborated Cone’s alleged addiction and that the State had\nargued that the drugs in Cone’s car were intended for resale, rather\nthan personal use.\n24                     CONE v. BELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfor sentencing purposes as well; the converse is not always\ntrue, however, as Brady itself demonstrates. In our semi\nnal case on the disclosure of prosecutorial evidence, defen\ndant John Brady was indicted for robbery and capital\nmurder. At trial, Brady took the stand and confessed to\nrobbing the victim and being present at the murder but\ntestified that his accomplice had actually strangled the\nvictim. Brady v. State, 226 Md. 422, 425, 174 A. 2d 167,\n168 (1961). After Brady was convicted and sentenced to\ndeath he discovered that the State had suppressed the\nconfession of his accomplice, which included incriminating\nstatements consistent with Brady’s version of events. Id.,\nat 426, 174 A. 2d, at 169. The Maryland Court of Appeals\nconcluded that Brady’s due process rights were violated by\nthe suppression of the accomplice’s confession but declined\nto order a new trial on guilt. Observing that nothing in\nthe accomplice’s confession “could have reduced . . .\nBrady’s offense below murder in the first degree,” the\nstate court ordered a new trial on the question of punish\nment only. Id., at 430, 174 A. 2d, at 171. We granted\ncertiorari and affirmed, rejecting Brady’s contention that\nthe state court’s limited remand violated his constitutional\nrights. 373 U. S., at 88.\n   As in Brady, the distinction between the materiality of\nthe suppressed evidence with respect to guilt and punish\nment is significant in this case. During the guilt phase of\nCone’s trial, the only dispute was whether Cone was “sane\nunder the law,” Tr. 2040 (Apr. 22, 1982), as his counsel\ndescribed the issue, or “criminally responsible” for his\nconduct, App. 110, as the prosecutor argued. Under Ten\nnessee law, Cone could not be held criminally responsible\nfor the murders if, “at the time of [his] conduct as a result\nof mental disease or defect he lack[ed] substantial capacity\neither to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to\nconform his conduct to the requirements of law.” Graham\nv. State, 547 S. W. 2d 531, 543 (Tenn. 1977). Although we\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          25\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntake exception to the Court of Appeals’ failure to assess\nthe effect of the suppressed evidence “collectively” rather\nthan “item by item,” see Kyles, 514 U. S., at 436, we never\ntheless agree that even when viewed in the light most\nfavorable to Cone, the evidence falls short of being suffi\ncient to sustain his insanity defense.\n   Cone’s experts testified that his drug addiction and\nposttraumatic stress disorder originated during his service\nin Vietnam, more than 13 years before the Todds were\nmurdered. During those years, despite Cone’s drug use\nand mental disorder, he managed to successfully complete\nhis education, travel, and (when not incarcerated) function\nin civil society. The suppressed evidence may have\nstrengthened the inference that Cone was on drugs or\nsuffering from withdrawal at the time of the murders, but\nhis behavior before, during, and after the crimes was\ninconsistent with the contention that he lacked substan\ntial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his\nconduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of\nlaw. See Graham, 547 S. W. 2d, at 543. The likelihood\nthat the suppressed evidence would have affected the\njury’s verdict on the issue of insanity is therefore remote.\nAccordingly, we conclude that the Sixth Circuit did not err\nby denying habeas relief on the ground that the sup\npressed evidence was immaterial to the jury’s finding of\nguilt.\n   The same cannot be said of the Court of Appeals’ sum\nmary treatment of Cone’s claim that the suppressed evi\ndence influenced the jury’s sentencing recommendation.\nThere is a critical difference between the high standard\nCone was required to satisfy to establish insanity as a\nmatter of Tennessee law and the far lesser standard that a\ndefendant must satisfy to qualify evidence as mitigating in\na penalty hearing in a capital case. See Bell, 535 U. S., at\n712 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (“[T]here is a vast difference\nbetween insanity—which the defense utterly failed to\n26                         CONE v. BELL\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nprove—and the possible mitigating effect of drug addiction\nincurred as a result of honorable service in the military”).\nAs defense counsel emphasized in his brief opening state\nment during penalty phase proceedings, the jury was\nstatutorily required to consider whether Cone’s “capacity\n. . . to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to\nconform his conduct to the requirements of the law was\nsubstantially impaired as a result of mental disease or\ndefect or intoxication which was insufficient to establish a\ndefense to the crime but which substantially affected his\njudgment.” Tenn. Code Ann. §39–2–203(j)(8) (1982). It is\npossible that the suppressed evidence, viewed cumula\ntively, may have persuaded the jury that Cone had a far\nmore serious drug problem than the prosecution was\nprepared to acknowledge, and that Cone’s drug use played\na mitigating, though not exculpating, role in the crimes he\ncommitted.19 The evidence might also have rebutted the\nState’s suggestion that Cone had manipulated his expert\nwitnesses into falsely believing he was a drug addict when\nin fact he did not struggle with substance abuse.\n    Neither the Court of Appeals nor the District Court fully\nconsidered whether the suppressed evidence might have\npersuaded one or more jurors that Cone’s drug addiction—\nespecially if attributable to honorable service of his coun\ntry in Vietnam—was sufficiently serious to justify a deci\nsion to imprison him for life rather than sentence him to\ndeath. Because the evidence suppressed at Cone’s trial\n\n——————\n  19 We agree with the dissent that the standard to be applied by the\n\nDistrict Court in evaluating the merits of Cone’s Brady claim on re\nmand is whether there is a reasonable probability that, had the sup\npressed evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would\nhave been different. See post, at 5. Because neither the District Court\nnor the Court of Appeals considered the merits of Cone’s claim with\nrespect to the effect of the withheld evidence on his sentence, it is\nappropriate for the District Court, rather than this Court, to do so in\nthe first instance.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Today we hold that the Tennessee\ncourts’ procedural rejection of Cone’s Brady claim does not\nbar federal habeas review of the merits of that claim.\nAlthough we conclude that the suppressed evidence was\nnot material to Cone’s conviction for first-degree murder,\nthe lower courts erred in failing to assess the cumulative\neffect of the suppressed evidence with respect to Cone’s\ncapital sentence. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court\nof Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded to the\nDistrict Court with instructions to give full consideration\nto the merits of Cone’s Brady claim.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

When issues under Brady v.\nMaryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), are presented on federal\nhabeas, they usually have been previously addressed in\nstate proceedings. Federal review is accordingly sharply\nlimited by established principles of deference: If the claim\nhas been waived under state rules, that waiver typically\nprecludes federal review. If the claim has been decided in\nthe state system, federal review is restricted in light of the\nstate court’s legal and factual conclusions. The unique\nprocedural posture of this case presents a Brady claim\nneither barred under state rules for failure to raise it nor\ndecided in the state system.\n  When it comes to that claim, the Court specifies that the\nappropriate legal standard is the one we set forth in Kyles\nv. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 435 (1995) (whether “the favor\nable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole\ncase in such a different light as to undermine confidence\nin the verdict”). See ante, at 20–21, 26, n. 19. I do not\nunderstand the majority to depart from that standard, and\nthe majority certainly does not purport to do so.\n  That leaves only application of the accepted legal stan\ndard to the particular facts. It is highly unusual for this\nCourt to engage in such an enterprise, see Kyles, supra, at\n2                        CONE v. BELL\n\n              ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\n\n458 (SCALIA, J., dissenting), and the Court’s asserted basis\nfor doing so in this case is dubious, see post, at 1, 4–5\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting).\n  In any event, the Court’s review of the facts does not\nlead it to conclude that Cone is entitled to relief—only that\nthe courts below did not adequately consider his claim\nwith respect to sentencing. See ante, at 26 (“Neither the\nCourt of Appeals nor the District Court fully considered\nwhether the suppressed evidence” undermines confidence\nin Cone’s sentence). The Court simply reviews the facts in\nthe light most favorable to Cone, concludes that the evi\ndence does not undermine confidence in the jury’s deter\nmination that Cone is guilty, but sends the case back for\n“full consideration” of whether the same is true as to the\njury’s sentence of death. Ante, at 25–27.\n  So this is what we are left with: a fact-specific determi\nnation, under the established legal standard, viewing the\nunique facts in favor of the defendant, that the Brady\nclaim fails with respect to guilt, but might have merit as\nto sentencing. In light of all this, I see no reason to quar\nrel with the Court’s ruling on the Brady claim.\n  In considering on remand whether the facts establish a\nBrady violation, it is clear that the lower courts should\nanalyze the issue under the constitutional standards we\nhave set forth, not under whatever standards the Ameri\ncan Bar Association may have established. The ABA\nstandards are wholly irrelevant to the disposition of this\ncase, and the majority’s passing citation of them should\nnot be taken to suggest otherwise.

Is a federal habeas claim ‘procedurally defaulted’\n     because it has been presented twice to the state\n     courts?\n     “2. Is a federal habeas court powerless to recognize\n     that a state court erred in holding that state law pre­\n     cludes reviewing a claim?” Pet. for Cert. i.\n   Both of these questions are based on a factually incor­\nrect premise, namely, that the Tennessee Court of Crimi­\nnal Appeals, the highest state court to entertain peti­\ntioner’s appeal from the denial of his second petition for\nstate postconviction relief,1 rejected petitioner’s Brady2\nclaim on the ground that the claim had been previously\n\n——————\n  1 Because  the Tennessee Supreme Court denied discretionary review\nof the decision of the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals decision\naffirming the denial of petitioner’s second amended petition for post­\nconviction relief, we must look to the decision of the latter court to\ndetermine if the decision below was based on an adequate and inde­\npendent state ground. See Baldwin v. Reese, 541 U. S. 27, 30–32\n(2004); O’Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U. S. 838, 842–843 (1999).\n  2 Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963).\n2                      CONE v. BELL\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\ndecided by the Tennessee Supreme Court in petitioner’s\ndirect appeal. Petitioner’s argument is that the State\nSupreme Court did not decide any Brady issue on direct\nappeal, that the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals\nerred in holding otherwise, and that the Sixth Circuit\nerred in concluding that the Brady claim had been proce­\ndurally defaulted on this ground. Petitioner is quite cor­\nrect that his Brady claim was not decided on direct appeal,\nand the Court in the present case is clearly correct in\nholding that a second attempt to litigate a claim in state\ncourt does not necessarily bar subsequent federal habeas\nreview. See ante, at 8–9.\n  But all of this is beside the point because the Tennessee\nCourt of Criminal Appeals did not reject petitioner’s Brady\nclaim on the ground that the claim had been previously\ndetermined on direct appeal. Rather, petitioner’s Brady\nclaim was simply never raised before the Tennessee Court\nof Criminal Appeals, and that court did not rule on the\nclaim at all.\n  Because the Sixth Circuit’s decision on the issue of\nprocedural default rests on the same mistaken premise\nthat the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals rejected\npetitioner’s Brady claim on the ground that it had been\npreviously determined, I entirely agree with the majority\nthat the Sixth Circuit’s decision on that issue cannot be\nsustained and that a remand is required. I cannot join the\nCourt’s opinion, however, for two chief reasons.\n  First, the Court states without explanation that “Cone\nproperly preserved and exhausted his Brady claim in the\nstate court” and that therefore the claim has not been\ndefaulted. Ante, at 20. Because Cone never fairly raised\nthis claim in the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, the\nclaim is either not exhausted (if Cone could now raise the\nclaim in state court) or is procedurally defaulted (if state\nlaw now provides no avenue for further review). I would\nleave these questions for resolution in the first instance on\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nremand.\n  Second, the Court, again without explanation, remands\nthis case to the District Court, not the Court of Appeals. I\nsee no justification for this step.\n                              I\n  In order to understand the tangled procedural default\nissue presented in this case, it is necessary to review the\nfar-from-exemplary manner in which the attorneys for\npetitioner and respondent litigated the Brady claim in the\nstate courts.\n  On direct appeal, petitioner did not raise any Brady\nclaim. As the Court notes, petitioner did claim that the\nState had violated a state discovery rule by failing to\nprovide prior statements given by certain witnesses and\nthat therefore the testimony of these witnesses should\nhave been stricken. App. 114–117; State v. Cone, 665\nS. W. 2d 87, 94 (Tenn. 1984). Although this claim con­\ncerned the State’s failure to turn over information, it is\nclear that this was not a Brady claim.\n  The first appearance of anything resembling the claim\nnow at issue occurred in 1993 when petitioner’s experi­\nenced attorneys filed an amendment to his second petition\nfor postconviction relief in the Shelby County Criminal\nCourt. This petition included a long litany of tangled\nclaims. Paragraph 35 of this amended petition claimed,\namong other things, that the State had wrongfully with­\nheld information demonstrating that one particular prose­\ncution witness had testified falsely concerning “petitioner\nand his drug use.” App. 13–14. This nondisclosure, the\npetition stated, violated not only the Fifth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the Constitution of the United States\n(which protect the due process right on which Brady is\nbased) but also the Fourth, Sixth, and Eighth Amend­\nments to the United States Constitution and four provi­\nsions of the Tennessee Constitution.\n4                          CONE v. BELL\n\n                         Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n   Two months later, counsel for petitioner filed an\namendment adding 12 more claims, including one (¶41)\nalleging that the State had abridged petitioner’s rights by\nfailing to disclose evidence that petitioner suffered from\ndrug problems. Id., at 20. According to this new submis­\nsion, the nondisclosure violated, in addition to the previ­\nously cited provisions of the federal and state constitu­\ntions, five more provisions of the state constitution,\nincluding provisions regarding double jeopardy, see Tenn.\nConst., Art. I, §10, ex post facto laws, §11, indictment, §14,\nand open courts, §17.\n   The Shelby County Criminal Court was faced with the\ntask of wading through the morass presented in the\namended petition. Under Tenn. Code Ann. §40–30–112\n(1990) (repealed 1995),3 a claim could not be raised in a\npostconviction proceeding if the claim had been “previ­\nously determined” or waived. Citing the State Supreme\nCourt’s rejection on direct appeal of petitioner’s claim that\nthe prosecution had violated a state discovery rule by\nfailing to turn over witness statements, the State incor­\nrectly informed the court that the failure-to-disclose­\nexculpatory-evidence claim set out in ¶41 had been “previ­\nously determined” on direct appeal. App. 15–16. The\nShelby County Criminal Court rejected the claim on this\nground, and held that all of petitioner’s claims had either\nbeen previously determined or waived. Id., at 22.\n   Given the importance now assigned to petitioner’s\nBrady claim, one might think that petitioner’s attorneys\nwould have (a) stressed that claim in the opening brief\nthat they filed in the Tennessee Court of Criminal Ap­\n——————\n   3 Tennessee law has since changed. Currently, the Tennessee Post-\n\nConviction Procedure Act bars any second postconviction petition, see\nTenn. Code Ann. §40–30–102 (2006), and permits the reopening of a\npetition only under limited circumstances, §40–30–117. These restric­\ntions apply to any petition filed after the enactment of the Post-\nConviction Procedure Act, even if the conviction occurred long before.\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

But\ncounsel did none of these things. In fact, the Brady claim\nwas not mentioned at all.\n  Nor was Brady cited in the reply brief filed by the same\nattorneys. The reply brief did contain a passing reference\nto “the withholding of exculpatory evidence,” but the brief\ndid not elaborate on this claim and again failed to mention\nthat this claim had never been previously decided and was\nsupported by newly discovered evidence.4\n  The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the\ndecision of the lower state court, but the appellate court\nmade no mention of the Brady claim, and I see no basis for\nconcluding that the court regarded the issue as having\nbeen raised on appeal.\n  Appellate courts generally do not reach out to decide\nissues not raised by the appellant.

And it is common to prac­\ntice for appellate courts to refuse to consider issues that\nare mentioned only in passing. Reynolds v. Wagner, 128\nF. 3d 166, 178 (CA3 1997) (citing authorities).\n   The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals follows these\nstandard practices. Rule 10(b) of that court states quite\nspecifically: “Issues which are not supported by argument,\ncitation to authorities, or appropriate references to the\nrecord will be treated as waived in this court.” The court\nhas applied this rule in capital cases, State v. Dellinger, 79\nS. W. 3d 458, 495, 497, 503 (Tenn. 2002) (appendix to\nmajority opinion); Brimmer v. State, 29 S. W. 3d 497, 530\n(1998), and in others. See, e.g., State v. Faulkner, 2001\nWL 378540 (Tenn. Crim. App., Sept. 10, 2001) (73-year\nsentence for first-degree murder). And in both capital and\nnoncapital cases, the court has refused to entertain\narguments raised for the first time in a reply brief. See\nState v. Gerhardt, 2009 WL 160930 (Tenn. Crim. App.,\nJan. 23, 2009) (capital case); Carruthers v. State, 814 S. W.\n2d 64, 68 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1991) (capital case); Cammon\nv. State, 2007 WL 2409568, *6 (Tenn. Crim.

S. ____ (2009)                  7\n\n                         Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nCourt of Criminal Appeals departed substantially from its\ngeneral practice, that court did not regard petitioner’s\nBrady claim as having been raised on appeal.\n   In the decision now under review, the Sixth Circuit held\nthat “[t]he Tennessee courts found that Cone’s Brady\nclaims were ‘previously determined’ and, therefore, not\ncognizable in [his] state post-conviction action.” 492 F. 3d\n743, 756 (2007). In my judgment, however, there is no\nbasis for concluding that the Tennessee Court of Criminal\nAppeals thought that any Brady issue was before it. A\ncontrary interpretation would mean that the Tennessee\nCourt of Criminal Appeals, disregarding its own rules and\nstandard practice, entertained an issue that was not men­\ntioned at all in the appellant’s main brief and was men­\ntioned only in passing and without any development in the\nreply brief. It would mean that the Tennessee Court of\nCriminal Appeals, having chosen to delve into the Brady\nissue on its own, ruled on the issue without even mention­\ning it in its opinion and without bothering to check the\nrecord to determine whether in fact the Brady issue had\nbeen decided on direct appeal. Such an interpretation is\nutterly implausible, and it is telling that the majority\nin this case cites no support for such an interpretation in\nthe opinion of the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals’\nopinion.\n   The Sixth Circuit’s decision on the question of proce­\ndural default rests on an erroneous premise and must\ntherefore be vacated.\n                           II\n  I also agree with the Court that we should not affirm\nthe decision below on the ground that the Brady claim\nlacks substantive merit. After its erroneous discussion of\n——————\nTennessee Court of Criminal Appeals has specifically held that claims\nmay not be raised on appeal in this manner. See Leonard v. State, 2007\nWL 1946662, *21–*22 (Tenn. Crim. App., July 5, 2007).\n8                          CONE v. BELL\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nprocedural default, the Sixth Circuit went on to discuss\nthe merits of petitioner’s Brady claim. In its 2001 opinion,\nthe Court of Appeals recognized that the prosecution’s\nBrady obligation extends not only to evidence that is\nmaterial to guilt but also to evidence that is material to\npunishment. See Cone v. Bell, 243 F. 3d 961, 968 (2001)\n(citing Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, 480 U. S. 39, 57 (1987)).\nBut neither in that opinion nor in its 2006 opinion did the\ncourt address the materiality of the information in ques­\ntion here in relation to petitioner’s punishment. See 492\nF. 3d, at 756 (“A review of the allegedly withheld docu­\nments shows that this evidence would not have overcome\nthe overwhelming evidence of Cone’s guilt in committing a\nbrutal double murder and the persuasive testimony that\nCone was not under the influence of drugs” (emphasis\nadded)). Therefore, despite the strength of the arguments\nin JUSTICE THOMAS’ dissent, I would leave that question to\nbe decided by the Sixth Circuit on remand.\n                             III\n   The Court, however, does not simply vacate and remand\nto the Sixth Circuit but goes further.\n   First, the Court states without elaboration that peti­\ntioner “preserved and exhausted his Brady claim in the\nstate court.” Ante, at 20. As I have explained, petitioner\ndid not fairly present his Brady claim in his prior appeal\nto the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, and therefore\nthat claim is either unexhausted or procedurally barred.\nIf the State is not now foreclosed from relying on the\nfailure to exhaust, see 28 U. S. C. §2254(b)(3), or on proce­\ndural default,6 those questions may be decided on remand.\n——————\n  6 Unlike exhaustion, procedural default may be waived if it is not\n\nraised as a defense. Banks v. Dretke, 540 U. S. 668, 705 (2004) (allow­\ning for waiver of “procedural default” “based on the State’s litigation\nconduct” (citing Gray v. Netherland, 518 U. S. 152, 166 (1996))).

A remand to the\nDistrict Court would of course be necessary if petitioner\nwere entitled to an evidentiary hearing, but the Court\ndoes not hold that an evidentiary hearing is either re­\nquired or permitted. In my view, unless there is to be an\nevidentiary hearing, there is no reason to remand this\ncase to the District Court. If the only purpose of remand is\nto require an evaluation of petitioner’s Brady claim in\nlight of the present record, the District Court is not in a\nsuperior position to conduct such a review.

In so doing,\nthe majority correctly rejects Cone’s argument that his\nguilty verdict was secured in violation of his rights under\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). The majority\ndeclines, however, to decide whether the same evidence\nthat was insufficient under Brady to overturn his convic\ntion provides a basis for overturning his death sentence.\nThe majority instead remands this question to the District\nCourt for further consideration because it finds that the\nCourt of Appeals engaged in a “summary treatment” of\nCone’s Brady sentencing claim. See ante, at 25–27.\n   I respectfully dissent. The Court of Appeals’ allegedly\n“summary treatment” of Cone’s sentencing claim does not\njustify a remand to the District Court. Cone has failed to\nestablish “ ‘a reasonable probability that, had the evidence\nbeen disclosed to the defense, the result of the [sentencing]\nproceeding would have been different,’ ” Kyles v. Whitley,\n514 U. S. 419, 435 (1995) (quoting United States v. Bagley,\n473 U. S. 667, 682 (1985) (opinion of Blackmun, J.)).

Along the way, Cone shot a\npolice officer and a bystander while trying to escape the\nfirst robbery, attempted to shoot another man in a failed\ncarjacking attempt, unsuccessfully tried to force his way\ninto a woman’s apartment at gunpoint, and murdered 93\nyear-old Shipley Todd and his 79-year-old wife, Cleopatra.\nWhen he was tried on two counts of first-degree murder in\n1982, Cone’s sole defense was that he did not have the\nrequisite intent to commit first-degree murder because\nhe was in the grip of a chronic amphetamine psychosis.\nThe jury rejected the defense and convicted Cone of both\nmurders.\n   At sentencing, the Tennessee jury found beyond a rea\nsonable doubt that four statutory aggravating factors\napplied to Cone’s offense: (1) Cone had been convicted of\none or more previous felonies involving the use or threat of\nviolence; (2) he had knowingly created a great risk of\ndeath to two or more persons other than the victim during\nhis act of murder; (3) the murder was especially heinous,\natrocious or cruel in that it involved torture or depravity of\nmind; and (4) the murder was committed for the purpose\nof avoiding a lawful arrest.

Code Ann. §39–2-203(i) (1982).2 Cone ar\ngued to the jury at sentencing that his “capacity . . . to\nappreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform\nhis conduct to the requirements of the law was substan\ntially impaired as a result of mental disease or defect or\nintoxication which was insufficient to establish a defense\nto the crime but which substantially affected his judg\nment.” See §39–2-203(j)(8). But the jury found that nei\nther this, nor any other mitigating factor, outweighed the\naggravating factors. The jury, as required by Tennessee\nlaw, unanimously sentenced Cone to death. See §39–2\n203(g).\n   For almost three decades, Cone’s case has traveled\nthrough the Tennessee and federal courts. This Court has\ntwice reversed decisions from the Court of Appeals that\ninvalidated Cone’s conviction and sentence. See Bell v.\nCone, 535 U. S. 685 (2002); Bell v. Cone, 543 U. S. 447\n(2005) (per curiam). On remand from this Court’s latest\ndecision, the Court of Appeals directly considered whether\na handful of police reports, law enforcement bulletins, and\nnotes that were allegedly withheld from Cone’s trial attor\nneys could have changed the result of Cone’s trial or sen\ntencing. And, for the second time, the Court of Appeals\nheld that there was not a “ ‘reasonable probability’ ” that\nthe evidence would have altered the jury’s conclusion “that\nCone’s prior drug use did not vitiate his specific intent to\nmurder his victims and did not mitigate his culpability\nsufficient to avoid the death sentence.” 492 F. 3d 743, 757\n(CA6 2007). The Court of Appeals, therefore, held that\nneither Cone’s conviction nor his sentence was invalid.\n——————\n  2 The Tennessee Supreme Court later concluded that the record in\n\nCone’s case was doubtful as to evidence supporting the second circum\nstance given the lapse in time between the initial events of the escape\nand the Todd murders. Cone, 665 S. W. 2d, at 95. The court, however,\ndetermined that the existence of the other three factors rendered any\npossible error in this factor harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

We\nshould affirm the Court of Appeals and put an end to this\nlitigation.\n                               II\n    According to the majority, the Court of Appeals’ decision\naffirming Cone’s death sentence is too “summary,” ante, at\n25, and the facts are such that, on further examination,\nCone “might” be able to demonstrate that it is “possible”\nthat the contested evidence would have persuaded the jury\nto spare his life, ante, at 25–26. On this reasoning, the\nmajority remands the case directly to the District Court\nfor “full consideration [of] the merits of Cone’s [sentencing]\nclaim.” Ante, at 27. I disagree on all counts. Remanding\nthe sentencing issue to the District Court is an “unusual\nstep” for this Court to take. House v. Bell, 547 U. S. 518,\n557 (2006) (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment in part\nand dissenting in part). Furthermore, in this case, it is a\nstep that is legally and factually unjustified. There is not\n“ ‘a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been\ndisclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would\nhave been different.’ ” Kyles, 514 U. S., at 433–434 (quot\ning Bagley, 473 U. S., at 682 (opinion of Blackmun, J.)).\n                            A\n  The majority’s criticism of the Court of Appeals’ alleg\nedly “summary treatment” of the sentencing question is\nmisplaced. Before the Court of Appeals, Cone dedicated\neight pages of his opening brief to arguing that the impli\ncated evidence was material to his guilt or innocence, but\nspent only one paragraph arguing its materiality to his\ndeath sentence. See Brief for Appellant in No. 99–5279\n(CA6), pp. 40–48. The Court of Appeals’ focus on the guilt\nphase, rather than the sentencing phase, simply followed\nCone’s lead. See 492 F. 3d, at 755 (“In his most recent\nbrief, claiming that his receiving the withheld evidence\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                     5\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nwould have resulted in a different sentence, Cone has\nmade only conclusory arguments”).3        There is nothing\ndefective about a judicial decision that summarily rejects\nan abbreviated legal argument, especially where, as here,\nthe burden of proving the materiality of the contested\nevidence was on Cone.4\n                             B\n  In remanding this matter to the District Court, the\nmajority makes two critical errors—one legal and one\nfactual—that leave the false impression that Cone’s Brady\nclaim has a chance of success. First, the majority states\nthat “[i]t is possible that the suppressed evidence” may\nhave convinced the jury that Cone’s substance abuse\nplayed a mitigating role in his crime and “[t]he evidence\nmight also have rebutted the State’s suggestion” that\nCone’s experts were inaccurately depicting the depth of his\ndrug-induced impairment. Ante, at 26 (emphasis added);\nsee also ante, at 26–27 (remanding “[b]ecause the evidence\nsuppressed at Cone’s trial may well have been material to\nthe jury’s assessment of the proper punishment in this\ncase” (emphasis added)). But, as the majority implicitly\n——————\n  3 The assertion by the majority, ante, at 26, n. 19, and JUSTICE ALITO,\n\nante, at 8 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part), that the\nCourt of Appeals did not address the merits of the sentencing issue at\nall is flatly wrong. See 492 F. 3d, at 757 (rejecting Cone’s Brady claim\nbecause the proffered evidence would not have altered the jury’s con\nclusion “that Cone’s prior drug use did not vitiate his specific intent to\nmurder his victims and did not mitigate his culpability sufficient to\navoid the death sentence” (emphasis added)).\n  4 The majority does not attempt to justify its remand by contending\n\nthat it is necessary because the record is insufficient to decide the\nclaim. Nor could it persuasively contend a remand is necessary so that\nthe District Court can hold an evidentiary hearing. Such a hearing\nwould shed no additional light on the trial proceedings or the relative\nimpeachment value of the withheld documents. Cone himself agrees\nthat “this Court should resolve the merits of [his] Brady claim.” Reply\nBrief for Petitioner 24; see also Brief for Respondent 26–27.\n6                       CONE v. BELL\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nacknowledges, see ante, at 26, n. 19, this is not the correct\nlegal test for evaluating a Brady claim: “The mere possibil\nity that an item of undisclosed information might have\nhelped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of\nthe trial, does not establish ‘materiality’ in the constitu\ntional sense.” United States v. Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 109–\n110 (1976) (emphasis added).\n   Rather, this Court has made clear that the legal stan\ndard for adjudicating such a claim is whether there is a\n“reasonable probability” that the jury would have been\npersuaded by the allegedly withheld evidence. Kyles,\nsupra, at 435; Bagley, supra, at 682 (opinion of Blackmun,\nJ.). It simply is not sufficient, therefore, to claim that\n“there is a reasonable possibility that . . . testimony might\nhave produced a different result . . . . [P]etitioner’s burden\nis to establish a reasonable probability of a different re\nsult.” Strickler v. Greene, 527 U. S. 263, 291 (1999) (em\nphasis in original). To satisfy the “reasonable probability”\nstandard, Cone must show that “the favorable evidence\ncould reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a\ndifferent light as to undermine confidence” in the jury’s\nsentencing determination. Kyles, supra, at 435. The\nCourt must view the record “as a whole,” Sawyer v.\nWhitley, 505 U. S. 333, 374 (1992) (STEVENS, J., concur\nring in judgment), and determine whether the absence of\nthe disclosure prevented Cone from receiving “ ‘a trial\nresulting in a [sentence] worthy of confidence.’ ” Strickler,\nsupra, at 290 (quoting Kyles, 514 U. S., at 434).\n   In the context of this case, for Cone to establish “ ‘a\nreasonable probability that, had the evidence been dis\nclosed to the defense, the result of the [sentencing] pro\nceeding would have been different,’ ” id., at 435, he must\nnot only demonstrate that the withheld evidence would\nhave established that he was substantially impaired as a\nresult of drug abuse or withdrawal; Cone also must estab\nlish that the addition of the allegedly withheld evidence\n                      Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                     7\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nultimately would have led the jury to conclude that any\nmitigating factors (including substantial impairment)\noutweighed all of the established aggravating factors. See\nTenn. Code Ann. §39–2-203(g).5\n   Second, the majority incorrectly claims that to prevail\non his Brady claim, Cone must demonstrate simply that\nthe withheld evidence supported the inference that he\n“was impaired by his use of drugs around the time his\ncrimes were committed.” See ante, at 21. This is factually\ninaccurate because there was already significant evidence\nof Cone’s drug use at trial. To establish that the allegedly\nwithheld evidence would reasonably have had any impact\non his case, Cone must instead show that the evidence\nwould have supported his claim of substantial mental\nimpairment from drug use.\n   There was extensive evidence at trial that supported the\ninference that Cone was not only a longstanding drug\nuser, but that he was in fact using drugs at the time of his\ncrimes. The State itself presented significant evidence on\nthis point. For example, it presented proof that officers\nfound marijuana cigarette butts, empty drug vials, and\nloose syringes in the car that Cone abandoned immedi\nately after the jewelry store robbery. Tr. 1505–1509 (Apr.\n19, 1982). The State also did not challenge testimony from\nCone’s mother that Cone used drugs. Id., at 1647, 1648–\n1653 (Apr. 20, 1982). And, most tellingly, the State intro\nduced evidence that Cone was abusing three drugs—\n——————\n  5 The majority asserts that the standard under Tennessee law for\n\ndemonstrating mental defect or intoxication as a mitigating factor at\nsentencing is “far lesser” than the standard for demonstrating insanity\nin the guilt phase of a criminal trial. Ante, at 25. But the mitigating\nfactor still requires a showing that Cone’s mental capacity was “sub\nstantially impaired” as a result of mental defect. Tenn. Code Ann. §39–\n2-203(j)(8). In any event, the only authority cited by the majority for its\nassertion that the standard is “far” lesser than that for insanity is\nJUSTICE STEVENS’ lone dissent in a prior appeal in this case. Ante, at\n25.\n8                           CONE v. BELL\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncocaine, Dilaudid, and Demerol—at the time of his arrest\nand was suffering “slight withdrawal symptoms” from\nthem. Id., at 1915–1916, 1920 (Apr. 22, 1982). As the\nCourt of Appeals explained, “[i]t would not have been news\nto the jurors, that Cone was a ‘drug user.’ ” 492 F. 3d, at\n757.6\n   In contrast, what was contested by the State during\ntrial was Cone’s defense that his drug use was so signifi\ncant that it caused him to suffer from extreme ampheta\nmine psychosis at the time of the murders. One of Cone’s\nexpert witnesses, a neuropharmacologist, testified that by\nthe summer of 1980, when the crimes occurred, Cone was\ningesting “ferociously large doses” of drugs and that his\nincreasing tolerance and use of amphetamines caused a\nchronic amphetamine psychosis. Tr. 1736–1737, 1744–\n1747, 1758–1759 (Apr. 21, 1982). The expert further\ntestified that if a person with chronic amphetamine psy\nchosis were to go into withdrawal, he could suffer extreme\nmood swings, “a crashing depression,” and a state of weak\nness so severe that “he could barely lift himself.” Id., at\n1857–1859. In this expert’s view, these symptoms could\ncause a person to “lose his mind.” Id., at 1859.\n   The State contradicted that testimony with significant\n——————\n    6 Althoughthere were two occasions during closing arguments where\nprosecutors intimated that Cone was not a drug user, see Tr. 2014–\n2015, 2068 (Apr. 22, 1982), the State’s argument otherwise consistently\nfocused on the real issue in the case: that Cone was not so significantly\naffected by his drug use around the time of his crimes that he was “out\nof his mind” or “drug crazy” during the critical days of August 1980.\nSee id., at 2023–2024, 2071–2084. The majority’s focus on two brief\nexcerpts from the State’s closing argument fails to faithfully view the\nrecord “as a whole” for purposes of a Brady analysis. See Sawyer v.\nWhitley, 505 U. S. 333, 374 (1992) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judg\nment); see also Strickler v. Greene, 527 U. S. 263, 290–291 (1999)\n(finding no reasonable probability of a different result even when\nprosecutor’s closing argument relied on testimony that could have been\nimpeached by withheld material).\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nevidence that Cone did not act like someone who was “out\nof his mind” during the commission of his crimes. Rather,\nthe State argued, Cone behaved rationally during his\ninitial Tennessee robbery, his subsequent escape, his\nflight from Tennessee to Florida after the Todd murders,\nhis Florida robbery, and his subsequent arrest. See, e.g.,\nid., at 2074–2084 (Apr. 22, 1982). To substantiate this\nargument, the State called FBI Special Agent Eugene\nFlynn to the stand. Agent Flynn testified that, when\ncaptured, Cone coherently detailed his travel from Ten\nnessee to Florida, explained his efforts to evade detection\nby shaving his beard and buying new clothes, and initi\nated negotiations for a plea bargain. Id., at 1918–1921.\nThe State also presented testimony from a friend of\nCone’s, Ilene Blankman, that she saw no indication that\nCone was under the influence of drugs or severe with\ndrawal in the days immediately following the murder of\nthe Todds. Id., at 1875–1876, 1882–1883 (Apr. 21, 1982).\n   Viewing the record as a whole, then, it is apparent that\nthe contested issue at trial and sentencing was not\nwhether Cone used drugs, but rather the quantity of\nCone’s drug use and its effect on his mental state. Only if\nthe evidence allegedly withheld from Cone was relevant to\nthis question whether Cone suffered from extreme am\nphetamine psychosis or other substantial impairment\nwould the evidence have been exculpatory for purposes of\nBrady. See Order Denying Motion for Evidentiary Hear\ning and Order of Partial Dismissal, Cone v. Bell, No. 97–\n2312–M1/A (WD Tenn., May 15, 1998), App. to Pet. for\nCert. 119a, n. 9 (explaining that “the issue at trial was not\nwhether Cone had ever abused any drugs (he clearly had),\nbut whether he was out of his mind on amphetamines at\nthe time of the murders”); Tr. 2115–2116 (Apr. 23, 1982).\n                          III\n  With the legal and factual issues correctly framed, it\n10                     CONE v. BELL\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nbecomes clear that Cone cannot establish a reasonable\nprobability that admission of the evidence—viewed either\nindividually or cumulatively—would have caused the jury\nto alter his sentence.\n                             A\n                             1\n  Cone first argues that he was improperly denied police\nreports that included witness statements regarding Cone’s\nbehavior around the time of his crime spree. The first\nstatement was given by a convenience store employee,\nRobert McKinney, who saw Cone the day before he robbed\nthe Tennessee jewelry store. When asked whether Cone\nappeared “to be drunk or high on anything,” McKinney\nanswered, “[w]ell he did, he acted real weird . . . he just\nwandered around the store.” App. 49. But McKinney\nsubsequently clarified that Cone “didn’t sound drunk” and\nthat the reason Cone attracted his attention was because\nhe “wasn’t acting like a regular customer”; he was “just\nkinda wandering” around the store. Motion to Expand the\nRecord in No. 97–2312–M1 (WD Tenn.), Exh. 2, pp. 3, 4.\nContrary to the majority’s assertion, this interview is not\nconvincing evidence “that Cone appeared to be ‘drunk or\nhigh’ ” when McKinney saw him. Ante, at 21. McKinney’s\nclarification that he had characterized Cone’s behavior as\n“weird” because Cone appeared to be killing time rather\nthan acting like a normal shopper undermines the impli\ncation of McKinney’s earlier statement that Cone looked\n“weird” because he might have been drunk or on drugs.\nThus, there is little chance that McKinney’s statement\nwould have provided any significant additional evidence\nthat Cone was using drugs, let alone provide sentence\nchanging evidence that he was substantially impaired due\nto amphetamine psychosis.\n  The second statement was given by Charles and Debbie\nSlaughter, who both witnessed Cone fleeing from police\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nafter the jewelry store robbery and reportedly told police\nthat he looked “wild eyed.” App. 50. Cone had just robbed\na jewelry store, shot a police officer and a bystander, and\nwas still fleeing from police when seen by the Slaughters.\nIt is thus unlikely that their observation of a “wild eyed”\nman would have been interpreted by the jury to mean that\nCone “was suffering from chronic amphetamine psychosis\nat the time of the crimes,” ante, at 21, n. 16, rather than to\nmean that Cone looked like a man on the run.\n   The third statement is contained in a police report\nauthored by an officer who helped apprehend Cone after\nthe Florida drugstore robbery. He reported that he saw a\nsuspect “at the rear of Sambos restaurant. Subject was\nobserved to be looking about in a frenzied manner and also\nappeared to be looking for a place to run.” App. 53. Noth\ning in this police report either connects Cone to drug use\nor appears otherwise capable of altering the jury’s under\nstanding of Cone’s mental state at the time of the crimes.\nIt certainly makes perfect sense that Cone was “looking\nabout in a frenzied manner,” ibid.; he had just robbed a\ndrugstore and was about to engage in a gun battle with\npolice in order to evade arrest. The police officer’s descrip\ntion of Cone’s appearance under these circumstances thus\ndoes not “undermine confidence” in Cone’s sentence.\nKyles, 514 U. S., at 435.\n                             2\n  The next category of documents that Cone relies upon to\nestablish his Brady claim are police bulletins. Some of the\nbulletins were sent by Memphis Police Sergeant Roby to\nneighboring jurisdictions on the day of the Todd murders\nand the day after. The bulletins sought Cone’s apprehen\nsion and alternatively described him as a “drug user” or a\n“heavy drug user.” App. 55–58. Cone asserts that he\ncould have used these bulletins to impeach Sergeant\nRoby’s trial testimony that the sergeant did not see any\n12                         CONE v.

First, Sergeant Roby never testified that\nCone was not a drug user. His only trial testimony on this\npoint was simply that he observed no “needle marks” on\nCone’s arm when taking hair samples from him a few days\nafter Cone’s apprehension. Ibid. Second, the bulletins\nestablish only “that the police were initially cautious\nregarding the characteristics of a person who had commit\nted several heinous crimes.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 119a, n.\n9. The bulletins would not have tended to prove that the\nfugitive Cone was, in fact, a heavy drug user—let alone\n“out of his mind” or otherwise substantially impaired due\nto amphetamine psychosis—at the time of his crimes.7\n                              3\n  Cone also argues that material was withheld that could\nhave been used to impeach Ilene Blankman’s testimony\nthat Cone did not appear to be high or in withdrawal when\nshe helped him obtain a Florida driver’s license during his\nefforts to evade arrest in Florida. Tr. 1875–1882 (Apr. 21,\n1982). But he again fails to meet the standard for excul\npatory evidence set by Brady.\n  Cone first points to police notes of a pre-trial interview\nwith Blankman, which did not reflect the statement she\ngave at trial that she saw no track marks on Cone’s arm.\nApp. 72–73. But Blankman was questioned at trial about\n——————\n   7 Alert bulletins sent by the FBI similarly identified Cone as a “be\n\nlieved heavy drug user” or a “drug user.” App. 62–70. Cone argues\nthat these bulletins could have been used to impeach FBI Agent Flynn’s\ntestimony about Cone’s arrest in Florida. The bulletins would not have\nconstituted material impeachment evidence, however, for the second\nreason identified above. In addition, the bulletins would not have\ncontradicted any of FBI Agent Flynn’s testimony; he in fact stated at\ntrial that Cone reported using three drugs and was undergoing mild\ndrug withdrawal when he was captured in Florida. Tr. 1915–1916\n(Apr. 22, 1982).\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            13\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nher failure to initially disclose this fact to police, Tr. 1903\n(Apr. 21, 1982), so the jury was fully aware of the omis\nsion. Disclosure of the original copy of the police notes\nthus could not have had any material effect on the jury’s\ndeliberations. Moreover, the missing notes also recorded a\ndamning statement by Blankman that Cone “never used\ndrugs around” her and she “never saw Cone with drug\nparaphernalia.” App. 73. Thus, it is difficult to accept\nCone’s argument that he would have benefited from the\nintroduction of notes from Blackman’s pretrial interview.\nIf anything, these police notes would have undermined his\nmitigation argument.\n   Cone next relies on a report that describes a woman’s\nconfrontation with the prosecution team and Blankman at\na restaurant during trial. During the encounter, the\nwoman accused Blankman of lying on the stand in order to\nframe Cone for the murders. Id., at 74–75. The report\nindicates that the prosecutors politely declined the\nwoman’s numerous attempts to discuss the merits of the\ncase and that Blankman said nothing. Id., at 75. Nothing\nabout this encounter raises doubts about Blankman’s\ncredibility.\n   Last, Cone points to “correspondence in the district\nattorney’s files suggest[ing] that the prosecution had been\nunusually solicitous of [Blankman’s] testimony.” Brief for\nPetitioner 45. But the correspondence was completely\ninnocuous. One of the notes, sent in response to Blank\nman’s request for a copy of her prior statement, expressed\nto Blankman that her “cooperation in this particular\nmatter is appreciated.” App. 76. The prosecutor then sent\na letter to confirm that Blankman would testify at trial.\nId., at 77. And finally, after trial, the prosecutor sent a\nnote to inform Blankman of the verdict and indicate that\nthey “certainly appreciate[d] [her] cooperation with [them]\nin the trial of Gary Bradford Cone.” Id., at 78. There is\nnothing about these notes that “tend[s] to prove any fact\n14                     CONE v. BELL\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthat is both favorable to Cone and material to his guilt or\npunishment.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 116a.\n                               B\n   Viewing the record as a whole, Cone has not come close\nto demonstrating that there is a “reasonable probability”\nthat the withheld evidence, analyzed individually or cu\nmulatively, would have changed the result of his sentenc\ning. Much of the impeachment evidence identified by\nCone is of no probative value whatsoever. The police\nbulletins do not contradict any of the trial testimony; the\nrestaurant encounter was innocuous; and the correspon\ndence sent by prosecutors to Blankman does not under\nmine her testimony or call Cone’s mental state into doubt.\nIf the remaining evidence has any value to Cone, it is\nmarginal at best. There was testimony that Blankman\ndid not initially tell police that Cone lacked track marks.\nSee Tr. 1903 (Apr. 21, 1982). McKinney clarified in his\nstatement that Cone’s activity in the store was consistent\nwith a person killing time, not the use of drugs or alcohol.\nAnd the behavior described by the Slaughters and the\nFlorida police officer is more naturally attributable to the\ncircumstances of Cone’s flight from the police than to any\ninference that Cone was “out of his mind” or otherwise\nsubstantially impaired due to amphetamine psychosis.\n   Countering the trivial value of the alleged Brady mate\nrial is the clear and overwhelming evidence that during\nCone’s crime spree, he was neither sufficiently insane to\navoid a conviction of murder nor substantially impaired by\nhis drug use or withdrawal-related psychosis. There was\nsubstantial evidence that Cone carefully planned the\njewelry store robbery and was calm in carrying it out, Tr.\nat 974–976, 1014 (Apr. 16, 1982), 1350–1352 (Apr. 17,\n1982), 1501 (Apr. 19, 1982), 2075 (Apr. 22, 1982); that he\nsuccessfully eluded police after engaging them in a shoot\nout, id., at 1053–1064 (Apr. 16, 1982); that, after hiding\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\novernight, he concocted a ruse to try to gain illegal entry\nto a residence, id., at 1205–1208 (Apr. 17, 1982); that he\nmurdered the Todds after they declined to cooperate with\nhis efforts to further elude police, id., at 1681 (Apr. 20,\n1982); that he took steps to change his appearance at the\nTodd residence and then successfully fled to Florida, id., at\n1918–1919 (Apr. 22, 1982); that he arrived in Florida\nexhibiting no signs of drug use or severe withdrawal, id.,\nat 1875–1882 (Apr. 21, 1982); that he obtained false iden\ntification in a further effort to avoid apprehension, id., at\n1881–1882, and that he denied any memory lapses and\ndescribed undergoing only minor drug withdrawal when\npolice arrested him, id., at 1919–1920 (Apr. 22, 1982).\nGiven this wealth of evidence, there is no “reasonable\nprobability” that the jury would have found that Cone was\nentitled to the substantial impairment mitigator had the\nevidence he seeks been made available to him.\n   And even if Cone could have presented this evidence to\nthe jury at sentencing and established an entitlement to\nthis mitigator, he still has not demonstrated a reasonable\nprobability that it would have outweighed all of the aggra\nvating factors supporting the jury’s death sentence. See\nid., at 2151–2154 (Apr. 23, 1982). In its decision on direct\nappeal, the Tennessee Supreme Court was well aware of\nthe evidence regarding the “degree and extent of [Cone’s]\ndrug abuse.” Cone, 665 S. W. 2d, at 90. As part of its\nrequired independent review of whether the mitigation\nevidence was sufficiently substantial to outweigh the\naggravating factors, see Tenn. Code Ann. §39–2-205, the\nTennessee court nevertheless concluded that the sentence\nwas “not in any way disproportionate under all of the\ncircumstances, including the brutal murders of two elderly\ndefenseless persons by an escaping armed robber who had\nterrorized a residential neighborhood for twenty-four\nhours.” 665 S. W. 2d, at 95–96. None of Cone’s proffered\nevidence places that conclusion, made by both the jury and\n16                     CONE v. BELL\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthe Tennessee Supreme Court, “in such a different light as\nto undermine confidence” in Cone’s sentence. Kyles, 514\nU. S., at 435; see also Strickler, 527 U. S., at 296.\n                            IV\n  This Court should not vacate and remand lower court\ndecisions based on nothing more than the vague suspicion\nthat error might be present, or because the court below\ncould have been more clear. This is especially so where, as\nhere, the record before the Court is adequate to evaluate\nCone’s Brady claims with respect to both the guilt and\nsentencing phases of his trial. The Court’s willingness to\nreturn the sentencing issue to the District Court without\nany firm conviction that an error was committed by the\nCourt of Appeals is inconsistent with our established\npractice and disrespectful to the lower courts that have\nconsidered this case. Worse still, the inevitable result will\nbe years of additional delay in the execution of a death\nsentence lawfully imposed by a Tennessee jury. Because I\nwould affirm the judgment below, I respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145883/", "sha1": "4e4c6f410081dbc12349703955493379e41355d2", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-048", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:08:55"}
