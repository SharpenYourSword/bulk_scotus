HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 08–681.      Argued January 21, 2009—Decided April 22, 2009\nPetitioner Nken sought an order from the Fourth Circuit staying his\n  removal to Cameroon while his petition for review of a Board of Im\n  migration Appeals order denying his motion to reopen removal pro\n  ceedings was pending. Nken acknowledged that Circuit precedent\n  required an alien seeking such a stay to satisfy 8 U. S. C. §1252(f)(2),\n  which sharply restricts the availability of injunctions blocking the\n  removal of an alien from this country, but argued that a court’s au\n  thority to stay a removal order should instead be controlled by the\n  traditional criteria governing stays. The Court of Appeals denied the\n  stay motion without comment.\nHeld: Traditional stay factors, not the demanding §1252(f)(2) standard,\n govern a court of appeals’ authority to stay an alien’s removal pend\n ing judicial review. Pp. 3–17.\n    (a) This question stems from changes made in the Illegal Im\n migration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996\n (IIRIRA), which “repealed the old judicial-review scheme set forth in\n [8 U. S. C.] §1105a [(1994 ed.),] and instituted a new (and significantly\n more restrictive) one in . . . §1252,” Reno v. American-Arab Anti-\n Discrimination Comm., 525 U. S. 471, 475 (AAADC). Because courts\n of appeals lacked jurisdiction before IIRIRA to review the removal\n order of an alien who had already left the United States, see\n §1105a(c), most aliens who appealed such a decision were given an\n automatic stay of the removal order pending judicial review, see\n §1105a(a)(3). Three changes IIRIRA made are of particular impor\n tance here. First, the repeal of §1105a allows courts to adjudicate a\n petition for review even if the alien is removed while the petition is\n pending. Second, the presumption of an automatic stay was repealed\n and replaced with a provision stating that “[s]ervice of the petition\n2                            NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    . . . does not stay the removal of an alien pending the court’s decision\n    on the petition, unless the court orders otherwise.” §1252(b)(3)(B).\n    Finally, IIRIRA provided that “no court shall enjoin the removal of\n    any alien . . . unless [he] shows by clear and convincing evidence that\n    the entry or execution of such order is prohibited as a matter of law.”\n    §1252(f)(2). Pp. 3–5.\n        (b) The parties dispute what standard a court should apply when\n    determining whether to grant a stay. Petitioner argues that the\n    “traditional” stay standard should apply, meaning a court should\n    consider “(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing\n    that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether [he] will be ir\n    reparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will\n    substantially injure the other parties . . . ; and (4) where the public\n    interest lies.” Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U. S. 770, 776. The Govern\n    ment argues that §1252(f) should govern, meaning an alien must\n    show “by clear and convincing evidence that the entry or execution of\n    [the removal] order is prohibited as a matter of law.” Pp. 5–6.\n        (c) An appellate court’s power to hold an order in abeyance while it\n    assesses the order’s legality has been described as inherent, and part\n    of a court’s “traditional equipment for the administration of justice.”\n    Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc. v. FCC, 316 U. S. 4, 9–10. That power\n    allows a court to act responsibly, by ensuring that the time the court\n    takes to bring considered judgment to bear on the matter before it\n    does not result in irreparable injury to the party aggrieved by the or\n    der under review. But a stay “is not a matter of right, even if irrepa\n    rable injury might otherwise result to the appellant.” Virginian R.\n    Co. v. United States, 272 U. S. 658, 672. The parties and the public,\n    while entitled to both careful review and a meaningful decision, are\n    also entitled to the prompt execution of orders that the legislature\n    has made final. Pp. 6–7.\n        (d) Section 1252(f) does not refer to “stays,” but rather to authority\n    to “enjoin the removal of any alien.” An injunction and a stay serve\n    different purposes. The former is the means by which a court tells\n    someone what to do or not to do. While in a general sense many or\n    ders may be considered injunctions, the term is typically used to refer\n    to orders that operate in personam. By contrast, a stay operates\n    upon the judicial proceeding itself, either by halting or postponing\n    some portion of it, or by temporarily divesting an order of enforceabil\n    ity. An alien seeking a stay of removal pending adjudication of a pe\n    tition for review does not ask for a coercive order against the govern\n    ment, but instead asks to temporarily set aside the removal order.\n    That kind of stay, “relat[ing] only to the conduct or progress of litiga\n    tion before th[e] court[,] ordinarily is not considered an injunction.”\n    Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 U. S. 271, 279.\n                    Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                        3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nThat §1252(f)(2) does not comfortably cover stays is evident in Con\ngress’s use of the word “stay” in subsection (b)(3)(B) but not subsec\ntion (f)(2), particularly since those subsections were enacted as part\nof a unified overhaul of judicial review. The statute’s structure also\nclearly supports petitioner’s reading: Because subsection (b)(3)(B)\nchanged the basic rules covering stays of removal, the natural place\nto locate an amendment to the standard governing stays would have\nbeen subsection (b)(3)(B), not a provision four subsections later that\nmakes no mention of stays. Pp. 8–12.\n   (e) Subsection (f)(2)’s application would not fulfill the historic office\nof a stay, which is to hold the matter under review in abeyance to al\nlow the appellate court sufficient time to decide the merits. Under\nsubsection (f)(2), a stay would only be granted after the court in effect\ndecides the merits, in an expedited manner. The court would have to\ndo so under a “clear and convincing evidence” standard that does not\nso much preserve the availability of subsequent review as render it\nredundant. Nor would subsection (f)(2) allow courts “to prevent ir\nreparable injury to the parties or to the public” pending review,\nScripps-Howard, 316 U. S., at 9; the subsection on its face does not\npermit any consideration of harm, irreparable or otherwise. In short,\napplying §1252(f)(2) in the stay context would result in something\nthat does not remotely look like a stay. As in Scripps-Howard, the\nCourt is loath to conclude that Congress would, “without clearly ex\npressing such a purpose, deprive the Court of Appeals of its custom\nary power to stay orders under review.” Id., at 11. The Court is not\nconvinced Congress did so in §1252(f)(2). Pp. 12–13.\n   (f) The parties dispute what the traditional four-factor standard\nentails. A stay is not a matter of right, and its issuance depends on\nthe circumstances of a particular case. The first factor, a strong\nshowing of a likelihood of success on the merits, requires more than a\nmere possibility that relief will be granted. Similarly, simply show\ning some possibility of irreparable injury fails to satisfy the second\nfactor. See Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555\nU. S. ___, ___. Although removal is a serious burden for many aliens,\nthat burden alone cannot constitute the requisite irreparable injury.\nAn alien who has been removed may continue to pursue a petition for\nreview, and those aliens who prevail can be afforded effective relief\nby facilitation of their return, along with restoration of the immigra\ntion status they had upon removal. The third and fourth factors,\nharm to the opposing party and the public interest, merge when the\nGovernment is the opposing party. In considering them, courts must\nbe mindful that the Government’s role as the respondent in every\nremoval proceeding does not make its interest in each one negligible.\nThere is always a public interest in prompt execution of removal or\n4                          NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    ders, see AAADC, supra, at 490, and that interest may be heightened\n    by circumstances such as a particularly dangerous alien, or an alien\n    who has substantially prolonged his stay by abusing the processes\n    provided to him. A court asked to stay removal cannot simply as\n    sume that the balance of hardships will weigh heavily in the appli\n    cant’s favor. Pp. 13–16.\nVacated and remanded.\n\n   ROBERTS, C.

ERIC H. \n\n         HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [April 22, 2009] \n\n\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n   It takes time to decide a case on appeal. Sometimes a\nlittle; sometimes a lot. “No court can make time stand\nstill” while it considers an appeal, Scripps-Howard Radio,\nInc. v. FCC, 316 U. S. 4, 9 (1942), and if a court takes the\ntime it needs, the court’s decision may in some cases come\ntoo late for the party seeking review. That is why it “has\nalways been held, . . . that as part of its traditional equip\nment for the administration of justice, a federal court can\nstay the enforcement of a judgment pending the outcome\nof an appeal.” Id., at 9–10 (footnote omitted). A stay does\nnot make time stand still, but does hold a ruling in abey\nance to allow an appellate court the time necessary to\nreview it.\n   This case involves a statutory provision that sharply\nrestricts the circumstances under which a court may issue\nan injunction blocking the removal of an alien from this\ncountry. The Court of Appeals concluded, and the Gov\nernment contends, that this provision applies to the grant\ning of a stay by a court of appeals while it considers the\n2                    NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlegality of a removal order. Petitioner disagrees, and\nmaintains that the authority of a court of appeals to stay\nan order of removal under the traditional criteria govern\ning stays remains fully intact, and is not affected by the\nstatutory provision governing injunctions. We agree with\npetitioner, and vacate and remand for application of the\ntraditional criteria.\n                              I\n   Jean Marc Nken, a citizen of Cameroon, entered the\nUnited States on a transit visa in April 2001. In Decem\nber 2001, he applied for asylum under 8 U. S. C. §1158,\nwithholding of removal under §1231(b)(3), and deferral of\nremoval under the Convention Against Torture and Other\nCruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,\nart. 3, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100–20, p. 20, 1465 U. N. T. S.\n85, see 8 CFR §208.17 (2008). In his application, Nken\nclaimed he had been persecuted in the past for participa\ntion in protests against the Cameroonian Government,\nand would be subject to further persecution if he returns\nto Cameroon.\n   An Immigration Judge denied Nken relief after conclud\ning that he was not credible. The Board of Immigration\nAppeals (BIA) affirmed, and also declined to remand for\nconsideration of Nken’s application for adjustment of\nstatus based on his marriage to an American citizen.\nAfter the BIA denied a motion to reopen, Nken filed a\npetition for review of the BIA’s removal order in the Court\nof Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. His petition was denied.\nNken then filed a second motion to reopen, which was also\ndenied, followed by a second petition for review, which was\ndenied as well.\n   Nken filed a third motion to reopen, this time alleging\nthat changed circumstances in Cameroon made his perse\ncution more likely. The BIA denied the motion, finding\nthat Nken had not presented sufficient facts or evidence of\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nchanged country conditions. Nken again sought review in\nthe Court of Appeals, and also moved to stay his deporta\ntion pending resolution of his appeal. In his motion, Nken\nrecognized that Fourth Circuit precedent required an alien\nseeking to stay a removal order to show by “clear and\nconvincing evidence” that the order was “prohibited as a\nmatter of law,” 8 U. S. C. §1252(f)(2). See Teshome-\nGebreegziabher v. Mukasey, 528 F. 3d 330 (CA4 2008).\nNken argued, however, that this standard did not govern.\nThe Court of Appeals denied Nken’s motion without com\nment. App. 74.\n   Nken then applied to this Court for a stay of removal\npending adjudication of his petition for review, and asked\nin the alternative that we grant certiorari to resolve a split\namong the Courts of Appeals on what standard governs a\nrequest for such a stay. Compare Teshome-Gebreegziabher,\nsupra, at 335, and Weng v. U. S. Attorney General, 287\nF. 3d 1335 (CA11 2002), with Arevalo v. Ashcroft, 344\nF. 3d 1 (CA1 2003), Mohammed v. Reno, 309 F. 3d 95 (CA2\n2002), Douglas v. Ashcroft, 374 F. 3d 230 (CA3 2004),\nTesfamichael v. Gonzales, 411 F. 3d 169 (CA5 2005), Be\njjani v. INS, 271 F. 3d 670 (CA6 2001), Hor v. Gonzales,\n400 F. 3d 482 (CA7 2005), and Andreiu v. Ashcroft, 253\nF. 3d 477 (CA9 2001) (en banc). We granted certiorari,\nand stayed petitioner’s removal pending further order of\nthis Court. Nken v. Mukasey, 555 U. S. ___ (2008).\n                             II\n  The question we agreed to resolve stems from changes\nin judicial review of immigration procedures brought on by\nthe Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsi\nbility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), 110 Stat. 3009–546, which\nsubstantially amended the Immigration and Nationality\nAct (INA), 8 U. S. C. §1101 et seq. When Congress passed\nIIRIRA, it “repealed the old judicial-review scheme set\nforth in [8 U. S. C.] §1105a and instituted a new (and\n4                     NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsignificantly more restrictive) one in 8 U. S. C. §1252.”\nReno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525\nU. S. 471, 475 (1999) (AAADC). The new review system\nsubstantially limited the availability of judicial review and\nstreamlined all challenges to a removal order into a single\nproceeding: the petition for review. See, e.g., 8 U. S. C.\n§1252(a)(2) (barring review of certain removal orders and\nexercises of executive discretion); §1252(b)(3)(C) (estab\nlishing strict filing and briefing deadlines for review pro\nceedings); §1252(b)(9) (consolidating challenges into peti\ntion for review). Three changes effected by IIRIRA are of\nparticular importance to this case.\n   Before IIRIRA, courts of appeals lacked jurisdiction to\nreview the deportation order of an alien who had already\nleft the United States. See §1105a(c) (1994 ed.) (“An order\nof deportation or of exclusion shall not be reviewed by any\ncourt . . . if [the alien] has departed from the United States\nafter the issuance of the order”). Accordingly, an alien\nwho appealed a decision of the BIA was typically entitled\nto remain in the United States for the duration of judicial\nreview. This was achieved through a provision providing\nmost aliens with an automatic stay of their removal order\nwhile judicial review was pending. See §1105a(a)(3) (“The\nservice of the petition for review . . . shall stay the depor\ntation of the alien pending determination of the petition by\nthe court, unless the court otherwise directs”).\n   IIRIRA inverted these provisions to allow for more\nprompt removal. First, Congress lifted the ban on adjudi\ncation of a petition for review once an alien has departed.\nSee IIRIRA §306(b), 110 Stat. 3009–612 (repealing\n§1105a). Second, because courts were no longer prohibited\nfrom proceeding with review once an alien departed, see\nDada v. Mukasey, 554 U. S. 1, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 19–\n20), Congress repealed the presumption of an automatic\nstay, and replaced it with the following: “Service of the\npetition on the officer or employee does not stay the re\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)             5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmoval of an alien pending the court’s decision on the peti\ntion, unless the court orders otherwise.”        8 U. S. C.\n§1252(b)(3)(B) (2006 ed.).\n   Finally, IIRIRA restricted the availability of injunctive\nrelief:\n    “Limit on injunctive relief\n      “(1) In general\n      “Regardless of the nature of the action or claim or of\n    the identity of the party or parties bringing the action,\n    no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have\n    jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the op\n    eration of the provisions of part IV of this subchapter,\n    as amended by [IIRIRA], other than with respect to\n    the application of such provisions to an individual\n    alien against whom proceedings under such part have\n    been initiated.\n      “(2) Particular cases\n      “Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no\n    court shall enjoin the removal of any alien pursuant to\n    a final order under this section unless the alien shows\n    by clear and convincing evidence that the entry or\n    execution of such order is prohibited as a matter of\n    law.” §1252(f).\nThis provision, particularly subsection (f)(2), is the source\nof the parties’ disagreement.\n                            III\n  The parties agree that courts of appeals considering a\npetition for review of a removal order may prevent that\norder from taking effect and therefore block removal while\nadjudicating the petition. They disagree over the standard\na court should apply in deciding whether to do so. Nken\nargues that the “traditional” standard for a stay applies.\nUnder that standard, a court considers four factors: “(1)\nwhether the stay applicant has made a strong showing\n6                     NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the\napplicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3)\nwhether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the\nother parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where\nthe public interest lies.” Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U. S.\n770, 776 (1987).\n   The Government disagrees, arguing that a stay is sim\nply a form of injunction, or alternatively that the relief\npetitioner seeks is more accurately characterized as in\njunctive, and therefore that the limits on injunctive relief\nset forth in subsection (f)(2) apply. Under that provision, a\ncourt may not “enjoin” the removal of an alien subject to a\nfinal removal order, “unless the alien shows by clear and\nconvincing evidence that the entry or execution of such\norder is prohibited as a matter of law.” 8 U. S. C.\n§1252(f)(2). Mindful that statutory interpretation turns\non “the language itself, the specific context in which that\nlanguage is used, and the broader context of the statute as\na whole,” Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341\n(1997), we conclude that the traditional stay factors—not\n§1252(f)(2)—govern a request for a stay pending judicial\nreview.\n                              A\n  An appellate court’s power to hold an order in abeyance\nwhile it assesses the legality of the order has been de\nscribed as “inherent,” preserved in the grant of authority\nto federal courts to “issue all writs necessary or appropri\nate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to\nthe usages and principles of law,” All Writs Act, 28\nU. S. C. §1651(a). See In re McKenzie, 180 U. S. 536, 551\n(1901). The Court highlighted the historic pedigree and\nimportance of the power in Scripps-Howard, 316 U. S. 4,\nholding in that case that Congress’s failure expressly to\nconfer the authority in a statute allowing appellate review\nshould not be taken as an implicit denial of that power.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  The Court in Scripps-Howard did not decide what “cri\nteria . . . should govern the Court in exercising th[e]\npower” to grant a stay. Id., at 17. Nor did the Court\nconsider under what circumstances Congress could deny\nthat authority. See ibid. The power to grant a stay pend\ning review, however, was described as part of a court’s\n“traditional equipment for the administration of justice.”\nId., at 9–10. That authority was “firmly imbedded in our\njudicial system,” “consonant with the historic procedures\nof federal appellate courts,” and “a power as old as the\njudicial system of the nation.” Id., at 13, 17.\n  The authority to hold an order in abeyance pending\nreview allows an appellate court to act responsibly. A\nreviewing court must bring considered judgment to bear\non the matter before it, but that cannot always be done\nquickly enough to afford relief to the party aggrieved by\nthe order under review. The choice for a reviewing court\nshould not be between justice on the fly or participation in\nwhat may be an “idle ceremony.” Id., at 10. The ability to\ngrant interim relief is accordingly not simply “[a]n historic\nprocedure for preserving rights during the pendency of an\nappeal,” id., at 15, but also a means of ensuring that ap\npellate courts can responsibly fulfill their role in the judi\ncial process.\n  At the same time, a reviewing court may not resolve a\nconflict between considered review and effective relief by\nreflexively holding a final order in abeyance pending\nreview. A stay is an “intrusion into the ordinary processes\nof administration and judicial review,” Virginia Petroleum\nJobbers Assn. v. Federal Power Comm’n, 259 F. 2d 921,\n925 (CADC 1958) (per curiam), and accordingly “is not a\nmatter of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise\nresult to the appellant,” Virginian R. Co. v. United States,\n272 U. S. 658, 672 (1926). The parties and the public,\nwhile entitled to both careful review and a meaningful\ndecision, are also generally entitled to the prompt execu\n8                     NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion of orders that the legislature has made final.\n                               B\n   Subsection (f)(2) does not by its terms refer to “stays”\nbut instead to the authority to “enjoin the removal of any\nalien.”     The parties accordingly begin by disputing\nwhether a stay is simply a type of injunction, covered by\nthe term “enjoin,” or a different form of relief. An injunc\ntion and a stay have typically been understood to serve\ndifferent purposes. The former is a means by which a\ncourt tells someone what to do or not to do. When a court\nemploys “the extraordinary remedy of injunction,”\nWeinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S. 305, 312 (1982),\nit directs the conduct of a party, and does so with the\nbacking of its full coercive powers. See Black’s Law Dic\ntionary 784 (6th ed. 1990) (defining “injunction” as “[a]\ncourt order prohibiting someone from doing some specified\nact or commanding someone to undo some wrong or\ninjury”).\n   It is true that “ ‘[i]n a general sense, every order of a\ncourt which commands or forbids is an injunction; but in\nits accepted legal sense, an injunction is a judicial process\nor mandate operating in personam.’ ” Id., at 800 (8th ed.\n2004) (quoting 1 H. Joyce, A Treatise on the Law Relating\nto Injunctions §1, pp. 2–3 (1909)). This is so whether the\ninjunction is preliminary or final; in both contexts, the\norder is directed at someone, and governs that party’s\nconduct.\n   By contrast, instead of directing the conduct of a par\nticular actor, a stay operates upon the judicial proceeding\nitself. It does so either by halting or postponing some\nportion of the proceeding, or by temporarily divesting an\norder of enforceability. See Black’s, supra, at 1413 (6th ed.\n1990) (defining “stay” as “a suspension of the case or some\ndesignated proceedings within it”).\n   A stay pending appeal certainly has some functional\n                    Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\noverlap with an injunction, particularly a preliminary one.\nBoth can have the practical effect of preventing some\naction before the legality of that action has been conclu\nsively determined. But a stay achieves this result by\ntemporarily suspending the source of authority to act—the\norder or judgment in question—not by directing an actor’s\nconduct. A stay “simply suspend[s] judicial alteration of\nthe status quo,” while injunctive relief “grants judicial\nintervention that has been withheld by lower courts.”\nOhio Citizens for Responsible Energy, Inc. v. NRC, 479\nU. S. 1312, 1313 (1986) (SCALIA, J., in chambers); see also\nBrown v. Gilmore, 533 U. S. 1301, 1303 (2001) (Rehnquist,\nC. J., in chambers) (“[A]pplicants are seeking not merely a\nstay of a lower court judgment, but an injunction against\nthe enforcement of a presumptively valid state statute”);\nTurner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 507 U. S. 1301,\n1302 (1993) (same) (“By seeking an injunction, applicants\nrequest that I issue an order altering the legal status\nquo”).\n  An alien seeking a stay of removal pending adjudication\nof a petition for review does not ask for a coercive order\nagainst the Government, but rather for the temporary\nsetting aside of the source of the Government’s authority\nto remove. Although such a stay acts to “ba[r] Executive\nbranch officials from removing [the applicant] from the\ncountry,” post, at 7 (ALITO, J., dissenting), it does so by\nreturning to the status quo—the state of affairs before the\nremoval order was entered.* That kind of stay, “relat[ing]\n——————\n  * The dissent maintains that “[a]n order preventing an executive\nofficer from [enforcing a removal order] does not ‘simply suspend\njudicial alteration of the status quo,’ ” but instead “blocks executive\nofficials from carrying out what they view as proper enforcement of the\nimmigration laws.” Post, at 7 (quoting Ohio Citizens for Responsible\nEnergy, Inc. v. NRC, 479 U. S. 1312, 1313 (1986) (SCALIA, J., in cham\nbers)). But the relief sought here would simply suspend administrative\nalteration of the status quo, and we have long recognized that such\n10                        NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nonly to the conduct or progress of litigation before th[e]\ncourt[,] ordinarily is not considered an injunction.” Gulf\nstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 U. S.\n271, 279 (1988); see Fed. Rule App. Proc. 8(a)(1)(A) (refer\nring to interim relief from “the judgment or order of a\ndistrict court pending appeal” as “a stay”). Whether such\na stay might technically be called an injunction is beside\nthe point; that is not the label by which it is generally\nknown. The sun may be a star, but “starry sky” does not\nrefer to a bright summer day. The terminology of subsec\ntion (f)(2) does not comfortably cover stays.\n   This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that when\nCongress wanted to refer to a stay pending adjudication of\na petition for review in §1252, it used the word “stay.” In\nsubsection (b)(3)(B), under the heading “Stay of order,”\nCongress provided that service of a petition for review\n“does not stay the removal of an alien pending the court’s\ndecision on the petition, unless the court orders other\nwise.” 8 U. S. C. §1252(b)(3)(B). By contrast, the language\nof subsection (f) says nothing about stays, but is instead\ntitled “Limit on injunctive relief,” and refers to the author\nity of courts to “enjoin the removal of any alien.”\n\n——————\ntemporary relief from an administrative order—just like temporary\nrelief from a court order—is considered a stay. See Scripps-Howard\nRadio, Inc. v. FCC, 316 U. S. 4, 10–11 (1942).\n   The dissent would distinguish Scripps-Howard on the ground that\nNken does not really seek to stay a final order of removal, but instead\nseeks “to enjoin the Executive Branch from enforcing his removal order\npending judicial review of an entirely separate order [denying a motion\nto reopen].” Post, at 4, n. But a determination that the BIA should\nhave granted Nken’s motion to reopen would necessarily extinguish the\nfinality of the removal order. See Tr. of Oral Arg. for Respondent 42\n(“[I]f the motion to reopen is granted, that vacates the final order of\nremoval and, therefore, there is no longer a final order of removal\npursuant to which the alien could be removed”). The relief sought here\nis properly termed a “stay” because it suspends the effect of the removal\norder.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n§1252(f)(2).\n   “[W]here Congress includes particular language in one\nsection of a statute but omits it in another section of the\nsame Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts\nintentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or\nexclusion.” INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421, 432\n(1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). This is particu\nlarly true here, where subsections (b)(3)(B) and (f)(2) were\nenacted as part of a unified overhaul of judicial review\nprocedures.\n   Subsection (b)(3)(B) changed the basic rules covering\nstays of removal, and would have been the natural place to\nlocate an amendment to the traditional standard govern\ning the grant of stays. Under the Government’s view,\nhowever, Congress placed such a provision four subsec\ntions later, in a subsection that makes no mention of\nstays, next to a provision prohibiting classwide injunctions\nagainst the operation of removal provisions. See 8 U. S. C.\n§1252(f)(1) (permitting injunctions only “with respect to\nthe application of such provisions to an individual alien”);\nAAADC, 525 U. S., at 481–482. Although the dissent\n“would not read too much into Congress’ decision to locate\nsuch a provision in one subsection rather than in another,”\npost, at 8, the Court frequently takes Congress’s structural\nchoices into consideration when interpreting statutory\nprovisions. See, e.g., Florida Dept. of Revenue v. Piccadilly\nCafeterias, Inc., 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 13).\n   The Government counters that petitioner’s view “fails to\ngive any operative effect to Section 1252(f)(2).” Brief for\nRespondent 32. Initially, this argument undercuts the\nGovernment’s textual reading. It is one thing to propose\nthat “enjoin” in subsection (f)(2) covers a broad spectrum\nof court orders and relief, including both stays and more\ntypical injunctions. It is quite another to suggest that\nCongress used “enjoin” to refer exclusively to stays, so that\na failure to include stays in subsection (f)(2) would render\n12                   NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe provision superfluous. If nothing else, the terms are\nby no means synonymous.\n   Leaving that aside, there is something to the Govern\nment’s point; the exact role of subsection (f)(2) under\npetitioner’s view is not easy to explain. Congress may\nhave been concerned about the possibility that courts\nwould enjoin application of particular provisions of the\nINA, see 8 U. S. C. §1252(f)(1) (prohibiting injunctions\n“other than with respect to the application of [Section IV\nof the INA] to an individual alien”), or about injunctions\nthat might be available under the limited habeas provi\nsions of subsection (e). Or perhaps subsection (f)(2) was\nsimply included as a catchall provision raising the bar on\nany availability (even unforeseeable availability) of “the\nextraordinary remedy of injunction.” Weinberger, 456\nU. S., at 312. In any event, the Government’s point is not\nenough to outweigh the strong indications that subsection\n(f)(2) is not reasonably understood to be directed at stays.\n                              C\n   Applying the subsection (f)(2) standard to stays pending\nappeal would not fulfill the historic office of such a stay.\nThe whole idea is to hold the matter under review in\nabeyance because the appellate court lacks sufficient time\nto decide the merits. Under the subsection (f)(2) standard,\nhowever, a stay would only be granted after the court in\neffect decides the merits, in an expedited manner. The\ncourt would have to do so under a standard—“clear and\nconvincing evidence”—that does not so much preserve the\navailability of subsequent review as render it redundant.\nSubsection (f)(2), in short, would invert the customary role\nof a stay, requiring a definitive merits decision earlier\nrather than later.\n   The authority to grant stays has historically been justi\nfied by the perceived need “to prevent irreparable injury to\nthe parties or to the public” pending review. Scripps\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nHoward, 316 U. S., at 9. Subsection (f)(2) on its face,\nhowever, does not allow any consideration of harm, irrepa\nrable or otherwise, even harm that may deprive the\nmovant of his right to petition for review of the removal\norder. Subsection (f)(2) does not resolve the dilemma stays\nhistorically addressed: what to do when there is insuffi\ncient time to resolve the merits and irreparable harm may\nresult from delay. The provision instead requires deciding\nthe merits under a higher standard, without regard to the\nprospect of irreparable harm.\n  In short, applying the subsection (f)(2) standard in the\nstay context results in something that does not remotely\nlook like a stay. Just like the Court in Scripps-Howard,\nwe are loath to conclude that Congress would, “without\nclearly expressing such a purpose, deprive the Court of\nAppeals of its customary power to stay orders under re\nview.” Id., at 11. Subsection (f)(2) would certainly deprive\ncourts of their “customary” stay power. Our review does\nnot convince us that Congress did that in subsection (f)(2).\nThe four-factor test is the “traditional” one, Hilton, 481\nU. S., at 777, and the Government has not overcome the\n“presumption favoring the retention of long-established\nand familiar principles, except when a statutory purpose\nto the contrary is evident.” Isbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson,\n343 U. S. 779, 783 (1952). We agree with petitioner that\nan alien need not satisfy the demanding standard of\n§1252(f)(2) when asking a court of appeals to stay removal\npending judicial review.\n                               IV\n  So what standard does govern? The question presented,\nas noted, offers the alternative of “ ‘the traditional test for\nstays,’ ” 555 U. S., at ___, but the parties dispute what that\ntest is. See Brief for Respondent 46 (“[T]he four-part stan\ndard requires a more demanding showing than petitioner\nsuggests”); Reply Brief for Petitioner 26 (“The Government\n14                     NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nargues . . . that the [stay] test should be reformulated”).\n   “A stay is not a matter of right, even if irreparable\ninjury might otherwise result.” Virginian R. Co., 272\nU. S., at 672. It is instead “an exercise of judicial discre\ntion,” and “[t]he propriety of its issue is dependent upon\nthe circumstances of the particular case.” Id., at 672–673;\nsee Hilton, supra, at 777 (“[T]he traditional stay factors\ncontemplate individualized judgments in each case”). The\nparty requesting a stay bears the burden of showing that\nthe circumstances justify an exercise of that discretion.\nSee, e.g., Clinton v. Jones, 520 U. S. 681, 708 (1997);\nLandis v. North American Co., 299 U. S. 248, 255 (1936).\n   The fact that the issuance of a stay is left to the court’s\ndiscretion “does not mean that no legal standard governs\nthat discretion. . . . ‘[A] motion to [a court’s] discretion is a\nmotion, not to its inclination, but to its judgment; and its\njudgment is to be guided by sound legal principles.’ ”\nMartin v. Franklin Capital Corp., 546 U. S. 132, 139\n(2005) (quoting United States v. Burr, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1761527\"><a href=\"/opinion/1761527/state-v-burr/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Cas.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 35\n(No. 14,692d) (CC Va. 1807) (Marshall, C. J.)). As noted\nearlier, those legal principles have been distilled into\nconsideration of four factors: “(1) whether the stay appli\ncant has made a strong showing that he is likely to suc\nceed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be ir\nreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of\nthe stay will substantially injure the other parties inter\nested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest\nlies.” Hilton, supra, at 776. There is substantial overlap\nbetween these and the factors governing preliminary\ninjunctions, see Winter v. Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil, Inc., 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 14); not\nbecause the two are one and the same, but because similar\nconcerns arise whenever a court order may allow or disal\nlow anticipated action before the legality of that action has\nbeen conclusively determined.\n   The first two factors of the traditional standard are the\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmost critical. It is not enough that the chance of success\non the merits be “better than negligible.” Sofinet v. INS,\n188 F. 3d 703, 707 (CA7 1999) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Even petitioner acknowledges that “[m]ore than\na mere ‘possibility’ of relief is required.” Reply Brief for\nPetitioner 21 (quoting Brief for Respondent 47). By the\nsame token, simply showing some “possibility of irrepara\nble injury,” Abbassi v. INS, 143 F. 3d 513, 514 (CA9 1998),\nfails to satisfy the second factor. As the Court pointed out\nearlier this Term, the “ ‘possibility’ standard is too leni\nent.” Winter, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 12).\n   Although removal is a serious burden for many aliens, it\nis not categorically irreparable, as some courts have said.\nSee, e.g., Ofosu v. McElroy, 98 F. 3d 694, 699 (CA2 1996)\n(“[O]rdinarily, when a party seeks [a stay] pending appeal,\nit is deemed that exclusion is an irreparable harm”); see\nalso Petitioner’s Emergency Motion for a Stay 12 (“[T]he\nequities particularly favor the alien facing deportation in\nimmigration cases where failure to grant the stay would\nresult in deportation before the alien has been able to\nobtain judicial review”).\n   The automatic stay prior to IIRIRA reflected a recogni\ntion of the irreparable nature of harm from removal before\ndecision on a petition for review, given that the petition\nabated upon removal. Congress’s decision in IIRIRA to\nallow continued prosecution of a petition after removal\neliminated the reason for categorical stays, as reflected in\nthe repeal of the automatic stay in subsection (b)(3)(B). It\nis accordingly plain that the burden of removal alone\ncannot constitute the requisite irreparable injury. Aliens\nwho are removed may continue to pursue their petitions\nfor review, and those who prevail can be afforded effective\nrelief by facilitation of their return, along with restoration\nof the immigration status they had upon removal. See\nBrief for Respondent 44.\n   Once an applicant satisfies the first two factors, the\n16                   NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntraditional stay inquiry calls for assessing the harm to the\nopposing party and weighing the public interest. These\nfactors merge when the Government is the opposing party.\nIn considering them, courts must be mindful that the\nGovernment’s role as the respondent in every removal\nproceeding does not make the public interest in each\nindividual one negligible, as some courts have concluded.\nSee, e.g., Mohammed, 309 F. 3d, at 102 (Government harm\nis nothing more than “one alien [being] permitted to re\nmain while an appeal is decided”); Ofosu, supra, at 699\n(the Government “suffers no offsetting injury” in removal\ncases).\n  Of course there is a public interest in preventing aliens\nfrom being wrongfully removed, particularly to countries\nwhere they are likely to face substantial harm. But that is\nno basis for the blithe assertion of an “absence of any\ninjury to the public interest” when a stay is granted.\nPetitioner’s Emergency Motion for a Stay 13. There is\nalways a public interest in prompt execution of removal\norders: The continued presence of an alien lawfully\ndeemed removable undermines the streamlined removal\nproceedings IIRIRA established, and “permit[s] and pro\nlong[s] a continuing violation of United States law.”\nAAADC, 525 U. S., at 490. The interest in prompt removal\nmay be heightened by the circumstances as well—if, for\nexample, the alien is particularly dangerous, or has sub\nstantially prolonged his stay by abusing the processes\nprovided to him. See ibid. (“Postponing justifiable depor\ntation (in the hope that the alien’s status will change—by,\nfor example, marriage to an American citizen—or simply\nwith the object of extending the alien’s unlawful stay) is\noften the principal object of resistance to a deportation\nproceeding”). A court asked to stay removal cannot simply\nassume that “[o]rdinarily, the balance of hardships will\nweigh heavily in the applicant’s favor.” Andreiu, 253\nF. 3d, at 484.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

This is the\nless stringent of the two standards at issue. See Kenyeres\nv. Ashcroft, 538 U. S. 1301, 1303–1305 (2003) (KENNEDY,\nJ., in chambers).\n   It seems appropriate to underscore that in most cases\nthe debate about which standard should apply will have\nlittle practical effect provided the court considering the\nstay application adheres to the demanding standard set\nforth. A stay of removal is an extraordinary remedy that\nshould not be granted in the ordinary case, much less\nawarded as of right. Virginian R. Co. v. United States, 272\nU. S. 658, 672–673 (1926); see also Winter v. Natural\nResources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2008)\n(slip op., at 14).\n   No party has provided the Court with empirical data on\nthe number of stays granted, the correlation between stays\ngranted and ultimate success on the merits, or similar\nmatters. The statistics would be helpful so that experi\nence can demonstrate whether this decision yields a fair\nand effective result. Then, too, Congress can evaluate\nwhether its policy objectives are being realized by the\n2                    NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nlegislation it has enacted. Based on the Government’s\nrepresentations at oral argument, however, there are\ngrounds for concern. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 35 (“[W]e do not\nhave empirical data, . . . but [stays of removal] are—in the\nNinth Circuit in our experience— . . . granted quite fre\nquently”). This concern is of particular importance in\nthose Circuits with States on our international borders.\nThe Court of Appeals for Ninth Circuit, for example, con\nsiders over half of all immigration petitions filed nation\nwide, and immigration cases compose nearly half of the\nNinth Circuit’s docket. See Catterson, Symposium, Ninth\nCircuit Conference: Changes in Appellate Caseload and Its\nProcessing, 48 Ariz. L. Rev. 287, 297 (2006).\n   Under either standard, even the less stringent standard\nthe Court adopts today, courts should not grant stays of\nremoval on a routine basis. The passage of the Illegal\nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of\n1996 (IIRIRA), 110 Stat. 3009–546, reinforces this point.\nBefore IIRIRA, aliens who left the United States no longer\nhad the ability to seek review of their removal orders, see\n8 U. S. C. §1105a(c) (1994 ed.) (repealed 1996), so they\ncould more easily have established irreparable harm due\nto their removal. It is perhaps for this reason Congress\ndecided to “stay the deportation of [an] alien pending\ndetermination of the petition by the court, unless the court\notherwise direct[ed].” §1105a(a)(3) (same). IIRIRA, how\never, removed that prohibition (as well as the automatic\nstay provision), and courts may now review petitions after\naliens have been removed. See Brief for Respondent 44;\nante, at 4, 15; post, at 5, 9 (ALITO, J., dissenting).\n   This change should mean that obtaining a stay of re\nmoval is more difficult. Under the Court’s four-part stan\ndard, the alien must show both irreparable injury and a\nlikelihood of success on the merits, in addition to estab\nlishing that the interests of the parties and the public\nweigh in his or her favor. Ante, at 14–15. As the Court\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nexplains, because aliens may continue to seek review and\nobtain relief after removal, “the burden of removal alone\ncannot constitute the requisite irreparable injury.” Ante,\nat 15. As a result of IIRIRA there must be a particular\nized, irreparable harm beyond mere removal to justify a\nstay.\n   That is not to say that demonstration of irreparable\nharm, without more, is sufficient to justify a stay of re\nmoval. The Court has held that “[a] stay is not a matter of\nright, even if irreparable injury might otherwise result.”\nVirginian R. Co., supra, at 672. When considering success\non the merits and irreparable harm, courts cannot dis\npense with the required showing of one simply because\nthere is a strong likelihood of the other. This is evident in\nthe decisions of Justices of the Court applying the tradi\ntional factors. See, e.g., Curry v. Baker, 479 U. S. 1301,\n1302 (1986) (Powell, J., in chambers) (“It is no doubt true\nthat, absent [a stay], the applicant here will suffer irrepa\nrable injury. This fact alone is not sufficient to justify a\nstay”); Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 463 U. S. 1315, 1317\n(1983) (Blackmun, J., in chambers) (“[L]ikelihood of suc\ncess on the merits need not be considered . . . if the appli\ncant fails to show irreparable injury from the denial of the\nstay”). As those decisions make clear, “ ‘the applicant\nmust meet a heavy burden of showing not only that the\njudgment of the lower court was erroneous on the merits,\nbut also that the applicant will suffer irreparable injury if\nthe judgment is not stayed pending his appeal.’ ” Williams\nv.

I would give effect to that\nprovision, and I therefore respectfully dissent.\n                             I\n  When an alien is charged with being removable from the\nUnited States, an Immigration Judge (IJ) conducts a\nhearing, receives and considers evidence, and determines\nwhether the alien is removable. See 8 U. S. C. §1229a(a);\n8 CFR §§1240.1(a)(1)(i), (c) (2008). If the IJ enters an\norder of removal, that order becomes final when the alien’s\nappeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) is\nunsuccessful or the alien declines to appeal to the Board.\nSee 8 U. S. C. §1101(47)(B); 8 CFR §§1241.1, 1241.31.\nOnce an order of removal has become final, it may be\nexecuted at any time. See 8 U. S. C. §§1231(a)(1)(B)(i),\n1252(b)(8)(C); 8 CFR §1241.33. Removal orders “are self\nexecuting orders, not dependent upon judicial enforce\nment.” Stone v. INS, 514 U. S. 386, 398 (1995).\n  After the removal order is final and enforceable, the\nalien may file a motion to reopen before the IJ, see 8\nU. S. C. §1229a(c)(7), or a petition for review before the\n2                    NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nappropriate court of appeals, see §1252(a)(1). While either\nchallenge is pending, the alien may ask the Executive\nBranch to stay its own hand. See 8 CFR §§241.6(a)–(b),\n1241.6(a)–(b). If, however, the alien wants a court to\nrestrain the Executive from executing a final and enforce\nable removal order, the alien must seek an injunction to do\nso. See 8 U. S. C. §1252(a)(1) (making a final order of\nremoval subject to 28 U. S. C. §2349(b), which provides\nthat an “interlocutory injunction” can “restrain” the “exe\ncution of” a final order). The plain text of the Illegal Im\nmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of\n1996 (IIRIRA), Div. C, 110 Stat. 3009–546, provides the\nrelevant legal standard for granting such relief: “Notwith\nstanding any other provision of law, no court shall enjoin\nthe removal of any alien pursuant to a final order under\nthis section unless the alien shows by clear and convincing\nevidence that the entry or execution of such order is pro\nhibited as a matter of law.” 8 U. S. C. §1252(f)(2).\n                             II\n  In my view, petitioner’s request for an order preventing\nhis removal pending disposition of his current petition for\nreview was governed by 8 U. S. C. §1252(f)(2). Petitioner\nis “remova[ble] . . . pursuant to a final order,” and he\nsought a court order to “enjoin” the Executive Branch’s\nexecution of that removal.\n                             A\n  There is no dispute that petitioner is “remova[ble] . . .\npursuant to a final order.” Ibid. On March 4, 2005, the IJ\ndetermined that petitioner was removable under\n§1227(a)(1)(B) and denied his claims for asylum, withhold\ning of removal, and protection under the Convention\nAgainst Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading\nTreatment or Punishment (CAT), Dec. 10, 1984, S. Treaty\nDoc. No. 100–20, 1465 U. N. T. S. 85. See App. 32–43.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nPetitioner appealed to the Board, and on June 16, 2006,\nthe Board affirmed. Id., at 44–49. On that date, peti\ntioner’s order of removal became administratively final,\nand the Executive Branch became legally entitled to re\nmove him from the United States.        See 8 U. S. C.\n§1231(a)(1)(B)(i); 8 CFR §1241.33(a).\n                              B\n    The only remaining question, therefore, is whether the\ninterim equitable relief that petitioner sought was an\norder “enjoin[ing]” his removal as that term is used in 8\nU. S. C. §1252(f)(2). I believe that it was.\n    In ordinary usage, the term “enjoin” means to “require,”\n“command,” or “direct” an action, or to “require a person\n. . . to perform, or to abstain or desist from, some act.”\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 529 (6th ed. 1990) (hereinafter\nBlack’s). See also Webster’s Third New International\nDictionary 754 (1993) (defining “enjoin” to mean “to direct,\nprescribe, or impose by order”; “to prohibit or restrain by a\njudicial order or decree”). When an alien subject to a final\norder of removal seeks to bar executive officials from\nacting upon that order pending judicial consideration of a\npetition for review, the alien is seeking to “enjoin” his or\nher removal. The alien is seeking an order “restrain[ing]”\nthose officials and “requir[ing]” them to “abstain” from\nexecuting the order of removal.\n    The Court concludes that §1252(f)(2) does not apply in\nthis case because, in the Court’s view, that provision\napplies only to requests for an injunction and not to re\nquests for a stay. That conclusion is wrong for at least\nthree reasons.\n                             1\n  First, a stay is “a kind of injunction,” Black’s 1413, as\neven the Court grudgingly concedes, see ante, at 10 (an\norder blocking an alien’s removal pending judicial review\n4                          NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n“might technically be called an injunction”). See also\nTeshome-Gebreegziabher v. Mukasey, 528 F. 3d 330, 333\n(CA4 2008) (the term “stay” “is a subset of the broader\nterm ‘enjoin,’ ”); Kijowska v. Haines, 463 F. 3d 583, 589\n(CA7 2006) (a stay “is a form of injunction”); Weng v.\nUnited States Atty. Gen., 287 F. 3d 1335, 1338 (CA11\n2002) (“[T]he plain meaning of enjoin includes the grant of\na stay”).*\n   Both statutes and judicial decisions refer to orders that\n“stay” legal proceedings as injunctions. For example, the\nAnti-Injunction Act provides that “[a] court of the United\nStates may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in\na State court.” 28 U. S. C. §2283. See also Hill v.\nMcDonough, 547 U. S. 573, 578–580 (2006) (habeas peti\ntioner sought injunction to stay his execution); McMillen\n——————\n   * Thus, it is unremarkable that we have used the word “stay” to de\nscribe an injunction blocking an administrative order pending judicial\nreview. See Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc. v. FCC, 316 U. S. 4 (1942);\nante, at 9–10, n. Indeed, our decision in Scripps-Howard, supra, at\n11—like the Court’s decision today, ante, at 7, 14—relied heavily on\nVirginian R. Co. v. United States, 272 U. S. 658 (1926), the latter of\nwhich referred to “stays” as a subset of “injunctions.” See id., at 669\n(noting that the power to issue a “stay” “to preserve the status quo\npending appeal” is “an incident” of the power “to enjoin” an administra\ntive order); see also id., at 671–672 (referring interchangeably to a\nthree-judge district court’s power to issue “injunctions” and “stays”). In\nany event, both Scripps-Howard and Virginian are inapposite because\npetitioner here did not seek to “stay” his removal order pending judicial\nreview of that order; rather, he sought to enjoin the Executive Branch\nfrom enforcing his removal order pending judicial review of an entirely\nseparate order. See Stone v. INS, 514 U. S. 386, 395 (1995) (holding\nthat the IJ’s removal order and the Board’s denial of a motion to reopen\nare “two separate final orders”); Bak v. INS, 682 F. 2d 441, 442 (CA3\n1982) (per curiam) (“The general rule is that a motion to reopen depor\ntation proceedings is a new, independently reviewable order”); Brief for\nRespondent 51–52 (differentiating petitioner’s challenge to the IJ’s\nremoval order, which “became final well over a year ago,” from “peti\ntioner’s latest challenge[, which] is currently pending” before the Court\nof Appeals); id., at 13–14, 36–37 (similar).\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)              5\n\n                       ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nv. Anderson, 95 U. S. 37, 42 (1877) (“[Petitioner] can, if he\nis wrongfully taxed, stay the proceeding for its collection\nby process of injunction”); Nivens v. Gilchrist, 319 F. 3d\n151, 153 (CA4 2003) (denial of “injunction” to “stay [a]\ntrial”); Jove Eng., Inc. v. IRS, 92 F. 3d 1539, 1546 (CA11\n1996) (automatic stay is “essentially a court-ordered in\njunction”). And it is revealing that the standard that the\nCourt adopts for determining whether a stay should be\nordered is the standard that is used in weighing an appli\ncation for a preliminary injunction. Ante, at 14 (adopting\npreliminary injunction standard set out in Winter v. Natu\nral Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U. S. ___, ___\n(2008) (slip op., at 14)).\n                               2\n   Second, the context surrounding IIRIRA’s enactment\nsuggests that §1252(f)(2) was an important—not a super\nfluous—statutory provision. This Court should interpret\nit accordingly.\n   IIRIRA was designed to expedite removal and restrict\nthe ability of aliens to remain in this country pending\njudicial review. Before IIRIRA, the filing of a petition for\nreview automatically stayed removal unless the court of\nappeals directed otherwise. 8 U. S. C. §1105a(a)(3) (1994\ned.) (repealed 1996). IIRIRA repealed this provision and,\nto drive home the point, specifically provided that\n“[s]ervice of the petition [for judicial review] . . . does not\nstay the removal of an alien pending the court’s decision\non the petition, unless the court orders otherwise.”\n§1252(b)(3)(B) (2006 ed.) (emphasis added). In addition,\n“many provisions of IIRIRA are aimed at protecting the\nExecutive’s discretion from the courts.” Reno v. American-\nArab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U. S. 471, 486\n(1999) (emphasis deleted). Indeed, “protecting the Execu\ntive’s discretion from the courts . . . can fairly be said to be\nthe theme of the legislation.” Ibid. Section 1252(f)(2),\n6                     NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwhich provides that a court may not block removal during\nthe judicial review process unless a heightened standard is\nmet, fits perfectly within this scheme.\n   The Court’s interpretation, by contrast, produces\nanomalous results. If §1252(f)(2) does not provide the\nstandard to be used by the courts in determining whether\nan alien should be permitted to remain in this country\npending judicial review, then IIRIRA left the formulation\nof that standard entirely to the discretion of the courts. A\nCongress that sought to expedite removal and limit judi\ncial discretion is unlikely to have taken that approach.\n   More important, if §1252(f)(2) does not set the standard\nfor blocking removal pending judicial review, then, as the\nCourt concedes, “the exact role of subsection (f)(2) . . . is\nnot easy to explain.” Ante, at 12. “In construing a statute\nwe are obliged to give effect, if possible, to every word\nCongress used.” Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330,\n339 (1979). We should not lightly conclude that Congress\nenacted a provision that serves no function, and the\nCourt’s hyper-technical distinction between an injunction\nand a stay does not provide a sufficient justification for\nadopting an interpretation that renders §1252(f)(2) mean\ningless. That result is particularly anomalous in the\ncontext of §1252(f)(2), which Congress said should apply\n“[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law.”\n                              3\n    Third, if stays and injunctions really are two entirely\ndistinct concepts, the order that petitioner sought here is\nbest viewed as an injunction. Insofar as there is a differ\nence between the two concepts, I agree with the Court that\nit boils down to this: “A stay ‘simply suspend[s] judicial\nalteration of the status quo,’ ” whereas an injunction\n“ ‘grants judicial intervention that has been withheld by\nlower courts.’ ” Ante, at 9 (quoting Ohio Citizens for Re\nsponsible Energy, Inc. v. NRC, 479 U. S. 1312, 1313 (1986)\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n(SCALIA, J., in chambers)). See also Black’s 1413 (defining\na stay as an “act of arresting a judicial proceeding by the\norder of a court”). Here, petitioner did not seek an order\n“suspend[ing] judicial alteration of the status quo.” In\nstead, he sought an order barring Executive branch offi\ncials from removing him from the country. Such an order\nis best viewed as an injunction. See McCarthy v. Briscoe,\n429 U. S. 1317, 1317, n. 1 (1976) (Powell, J., in chambers)\n(although applicants claimed to seek a “stay,” the court\ngranted an “injunction” because “the applicants actually\n[sought] affirmative relief” against executive officials).\n   Even if petitioner had sought to block his removal pend\ning judicial review of the order of removal, any interim\norder blocking his removal would best be termed an in\njunction. When the Board affirmed petitioner’s final\nremoval order in 2006, it gave the Executive Branch all of\nthe legal authority it needed to remove petitioner from the\nUnited States immediately. An order preventing an ex\necutive officer from exercising that authority does not\n“simply suspend judicial alteration of the status quo.”\nOhio Citizens for Responsible Energy, supra, at 1313.\nInstead, such an order is most properly termed an injunc\ntion because it blocks executive officials from carrying out\nwhat they view as proper enforcement of the immigration\nlaws. And in that regard, it is significant that the Hobbs\nAct—which governs judicial review under IIRIRA, see 8\nU. S. C. §1252(a)(1)—refers to an “application for an inter\nlocutory injunction restraining or suspending the enforce\nment, operation, or execution of, or setting aside” a final\nadministrative order. 28 U. S. C. §2349(b) (emphasis\nadded).\n   In the present case, however, petitioner did not seek to\nblock his removal pending judicial review of his final order\nof removal. That review concluded long ago. What peti\ntioner asked for was an order barring the Executive\nBranch from removing him pending judicial review of an\n8                     NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nentirely different order, the Board’s order denying his\nthird motion to reopen the proceedings. Petitioner’s cur\nrent petition for review does not contest the correctness of\nthe removal order. Rather, he argues that the Board\nshould have set aside that order due to alleged changes in\nconditions in his home country. A motion to reopen an\nadministrative proceeding that is no longer subject to\ndirect judicial review surely seeks “ ‘an order altering the\nstatus quo.’ ” Ante, at 9 (quoting Turner Broadcasting\nSystem, Inc. v. FCC, 507 U. S. 1301, 1302 (1993)\n(Rehnquist, C. J., in chambers)). Consequently, the relief\nthat petitioner sought here is best categorized as an\ninjunction.\n                               III\n   In addition to its highly technical distinction between an\ninjunction and a stay, the Court advances several other\njustifications for its decision, but none is persuasive.\n   The Court argues that applying 8 U. S. C. §1252(f)(2)\nwould “deprive” us of our “ ‘customary’ stay power.” Ante,\nat 13. As noted above, however, restricting judicial discre\ntion was “the theme” of IIRIRA, American-Arab Anti-\nDiscrimination Comm., 525 U. S., at 486. And Congress is\nfree to regulate or eliminate the relief that federal courts\nmay award, within constitutional limits that the Court\ndoes not invoke here. Cf. INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289,\n299–300 (2001).\n   The Court opines that subsection (b)(3)(B)—not subsec\ntion (f)(2)—is “the natural place to locate an amendment\nto the traditional standard governing the grant of stays.”\nAnte, at 11. But I would not read too much into Congress’\ndecision to locate such a provision in one subsection rather\nthan in another subsection of the same provision. In\naddition, there is also nothing “unnatural” about Congress’\nuse of two separate subsections of §1252 to address a\ncommon subject. For example, §1252(a)(2)(A) lists several\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           9\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nmatters over which “no court shall have jurisdiction to\nreview,” while §1252(g) lists another subject over which\n“no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or\nclaim.” The fact that those provisions are separated by\nfive subsections and framed in slightly different terms\ndoes not justify ignoring them, just as the space and dif\nference in terminology between §1252(b)(3)(B) and\n§1252(f)(2) cannot justify the Court’s result.\n   Noting that the term “stay” is used in §1252(b)(3)(B) but\nnot in §1252(f)(2), the Court infers that Congress did not\nintend that the latter provision apply to stays. Ante, at\n10–11. But the use of the term “stay” in subsection\n(b)(3)(B) is easy to explain. As noted above, prior to\nIIRIRA, the Immigration and Nationality Act provided for\nan automatic “stay” of deportation upon the filing of a\npetition for review unless the court of appeals directed\notherwise. See 8 U. S. C. §1105a(a)(3) (1994 ed.) (repealed\n1996). The statute provided:\n    “The service of the petition for review upon [the At\n    torney General’s agents] shall stay the deportation of\n    the alien pending determination of the petition by the\n    court . . . unless the court otherwise directs . . . .”\n    Ibid. (emphasis added).\nIn IIRIRA, Congress repealed that provision and, to make\nsure that the pre-IIRIRA practice would not be continued,\nenacted a new provision that explicitly inverted the prior\nrule:\n    “Service of the petition on the officer or employee does\n    not stay the removal of an alien pending the court’s\n    decision on the petition, unless the court orders oth\n    erwise.” §1252(b)(3)(B) (2006 ed.) (emphasis added).\nIt is thus apparent that §1252(b)(3)(B) uses the term\n“stay” because that is the term that was used in the provi\nsion that it replaced.\n10                   NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n  Finally, the Court worries that applying §1252(f)(2)\nwould create inequitable results by allowing removable\naliens to remain in the United States only if they can\nprove the merits of their claims under a “higher standard”\nthan the one they would otherwise have to satisfy. Ante,\nat 13. But as the Court acknowledges, ante, at 4, IIRIRA\nspecifically contemplated that most aliens wishing to\ncontest final orders of removal would be forced to pursue\ntheir appeals from abroad. See §306(b), 110 Stat. 3009–\n612 (repealing 8 U. S. C. §1105a (1994 ed.)). If such an\nalien seeks to remain in the United States pending judicial\nreview, IIRIRA provides that the alien must make the\nheightened showing required under §1252(f)(2). Congress\ndid not think that this scheme is inequitable, and we must\nheed what §1252(f)(2) prescribes.\n                         *   *    *\n  In my view, the Fourth Circuit was correct to apply\n§1252(f)(2) and to deny petitioner’s application for an\norder barring his removal pending judicial review. There\nfore, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n</pre>", "id": 145884, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2009/04/22/Nken_v._Holder.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2008                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued January 21, 2009—Decided April 22, 2009\nPetitioner Nken sought an order from the Fourth Circuit staying his\n  removal to Cameroon while his petition for review of a Board of Im\n  migration Appeals order denying his motion to reopen removal pro\n  ceedings was pending. Nken acknowledged that Circuit precedent\n  required an alien seeking such a stay to satisfy 8 U. S. C. §1252(f)(2),\n  which sharply restricts the availability of injunctions blocking the\n  removal of an alien from this country, but argued that a court’s au\n  thority to stay a removal order should instead be controlled by the\n  traditional criteria governing stays. The Court of Appeals denied the\n  stay motion without comment.\nHeld: Traditional stay factors, not the demanding §1252(f)(2) standard,\n govern a court of appeals’ authority to stay an alien’s removal pend\n ing judicial review. Pp. 3–17.\n    (a) This question stems from changes made in the Illegal Im\n migration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996\n (IIRIRA), which “repealed the old judicial-review scheme set forth in\n [8 U. S. C.] §1105a [(1994 ed.),] and instituted a new (and significantly\n more restrictive) one in . . . §1252,” Reno v. American-Arab Anti-\n Discrimination Comm., 525 U. S. 471, 475 (AAADC). Because courts\n of appeals lacked jurisdiction before IIRIRA to review the removal\n order of an alien who had already left the United States, see\n §1105a(c), most aliens who appealed such a decision were given an\n automatic stay of the removal order pending judicial review, see\n §1105a(a)(3). Three changes IIRIRA made are of particular impor\n tance here. First, the repeal of §1105a allows courts to adjudicate a\n petition for review even if the alien is removed while the petition is\n pending. Second, the presumption of an automatic stay was repealed\n and replaced with a provision stating that “[s]ervice of the petition\n2                            NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    . . . does not stay the removal of an alien pending the court’s decision\n    on the petition, unless the court orders otherwise.” §1252(b)(3)(B).\n    Finally, IIRIRA provided that “no court shall enjoin the removal of\n    any alien . . . unless [he] shows by clear and convincing evidence that\n    the entry or execution of such order is prohibited as a matter of law.”\n    §1252(f)(2). Pp. 3–5.\n        (b) The parties dispute what standard a court should apply when\n    determining whether to grant a stay. Petitioner argues that the\n    “traditional” stay standard should apply, meaning a court should\n    consider “(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing\n    that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether [he] will be ir\n    reparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will\n    substantially injure the other parties . . . ; and (4) where the public\n    interest lies.” Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U. S. 770, 776. The Govern\n    ment argues that §1252(f) should govern, meaning an alien must\n    show “by clear and convincing evidence that the entry or execution of\n    [the removal] order is prohibited as a matter of law.” Pp. 5–6.\n        (c) An appellate court’s power to hold an order in abeyance while it\n    assesses the order’s legality has been described as inherent, and part\n    of a court’s “traditional equipment for the administration of justice.”\n    Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc. v. FCC, 316 U. S. 4, 9–10. That power\n    allows a court to act responsibly, by ensuring that the time the court\n    takes to bring considered judgment to bear on the matter before it\n    does not result in irreparable injury to the party aggrieved by the or\n    der under review. But a stay “is not a matter of right, even if irrepa\n    rable injury might otherwise result to the appellant.” Virginian R.\n    Co. v. United States, 272 U. S. 658, 672. The parties and the public,\n    while entitled to both careful review and a meaningful decision, are\n    also entitled to the prompt execution of orders that the legislature\n    has made final. Pp. 6–7.\n        (d) Section 1252(f) does not refer to “stays,” but rather to authority\n    to “enjoin the removal of any alien.” An injunction and a stay serve\n    different purposes. The former is the means by which a court tells\n    someone what to do or not to do. While in a general sense many or\n    ders may be considered injunctions, the term is typically used to refer\n    to orders that operate in personam. By contrast, a stay operates\n    upon the judicial proceeding itself, either by halting or postponing\n    some portion of it, or by temporarily divesting an order of enforceabil\n    ity. An alien seeking a stay of removal pending adjudication of a pe\n    tition for review does not ask for a coercive order against the govern\n    ment, but instead asks to temporarily set aside the removal order.\n    That kind of stay, “relat[ing] only to the conduct or progress of litiga\n    tion before th[e] court[,] ordinarily is not considered an injunction.”\n    Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 U. S. 271, 279.\n                    Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                        3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nThat §1252(f)(2) does not comfortably cover stays is evident in Con\ngress’s use of the word “stay” in subsection (b)(3)(B) but not subsec\ntion (f)(2), particularly since those subsections were enacted as part\nof a unified overhaul of judicial review. The statute’s structure also\nclearly supports petitioner’s reading: Because subsection (b)(3)(B)\nchanged the basic rules covering stays of removal, the natural place\nto locate an amendment to the standard governing stays would have\nbeen subsection (b)(3)(B), not a provision four subsections later that\nmakes no mention of stays. Pp. 8–12.\n   (e) Subsection (f)(2)’s application would not fulfill the historic office\nof a stay, which is to hold the matter under review in abeyance to al\nlow the appellate court sufficient time to decide the merits. Under\nsubsection (f)(2), a stay would only be granted after the court in effect\ndecides the merits, in an expedited manner. The court would have to\ndo so under a “clear and convincing evidence” standard that does not\nso much preserve the availability of subsequent review as render it\nredundant. Nor would subsection (f)(2) allow courts “to prevent ir\nreparable injury to the parties or to the public” pending review,\nScripps-Howard, 316 U. S., at 9; the subsection on its face does not\npermit any consideration of harm, irreparable or otherwise. In short,\napplying §1252(f)(2) in the stay context would result in something\nthat does not remotely look like a stay. As in Scripps-Howard, the\nCourt is loath to conclude that Congress would, “without clearly ex\npressing such a purpose, deprive the Court of Appeals of its custom\nary power to stay orders under review.” Id., at 11. The Court is not\nconvinced Congress did so in §1252(f)(2). Pp. 12–13.\n   (f) The parties dispute what the traditional four-factor standard\nentails. A stay is not a matter of right, and its issuance depends on\nthe circumstances of a particular case. The first factor, a strong\nshowing of a likelihood of success on the merits, requires more than a\nmere possibility that relief will be granted. Similarly, simply show\ning some possibility of irreparable injury fails to satisfy the second\nfactor. See Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555\nU. S. ___, ___. Although removal is a serious burden for many aliens,\nthat burden alone cannot constitute the requisite irreparable injury.\nAn alien who has been removed may continue to pursue a petition for\nreview, and those aliens who prevail can be afforded effective relief\nby facilitation of their return, along with restoration of the immigra\ntion status they had upon removal. The third and fourth factors,\nharm to the opposing party and the public interest, merge when the\nGovernment is the opposing party. In considering them, courts must\nbe mindful that the Government’s role as the respondent in every\nremoval proceeding does not make its interest in each one negligible.\nThere is always a public interest in prompt execution of removal or\n4                          NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    ders, see AAADC, supra, at 490, and that interest may be heightened\n    by circumstances such as a particularly dangerous alien, or an alien\n    who has substantially prolonged his stay by abusing the processes\n    provided to him. A court asked to stay removal cannot simply as\n    sume that the balance of hardships will weigh heavily in the appli\n    cant’s favor. Pp. 13–16.\nVacated and remanded.\n\n   ROBERTS, C.

Sometimes a\nlittle; sometimes a lot. “No court can make time stand\nstill” while it considers an appeal, Scripps-Howard Radio,\nInc. v. FCC, 316 U. S. 4, 9 (1942), and if a court takes the\ntime it needs, the court’s decision may in some cases come\ntoo late for the party seeking review. That is why it “has\nalways been held, . . . that as part of its traditional equip\nment for the administration of justice, a federal court can\nstay the enforcement of a judgment pending the outcome\nof an appeal.” Id., at 9–10 (footnote omitted). A stay does\nnot make time stand still, but does hold a ruling in abey\nance to allow an appellate court the time necessary to\nreview it.\n   This case involves a statutory provision that sharply\nrestricts the circumstances under which a court may issue\nan injunction blocking the removal of an alien from this\ncountry. The Court of Appeals concluded, and the Gov\nernment contends, that this provision applies to the grant\ning of a stay by a court of appeals while it considers the\n2                    NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlegality of a removal order. Petitioner disagrees, and\nmaintains that the authority of a court of appeals to stay\nan order of removal under the traditional criteria govern\ning stays remains fully intact, and is not affected by the\nstatutory provision governing injunctions. We agree with\npetitioner, and vacate and remand for application of the\ntraditional criteria.\n                              I\n   Jean Marc Nken, a citizen of Cameroon, entered the\nUnited States on a transit visa in April 2001. In Decem\nber 2001, he applied for asylum under 8 U. S. C. §1158,\nwithholding of removal under §1231(b)(3), and deferral of\nremoval under the Convention Against Torture and Other\nCruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,\nart. 3, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100–20, p. 20, 1465 U. N. T. S.\n85, see 8 CFR §208.17 (2008). In his application, Nken\nclaimed he had been persecuted in the past for participa\ntion in protests against the Cameroonian Government,\nand would be subject to further persecution if he returns\nto Cameroon.\n   An Immigration Judge denied Nken relief after conclud\ning that he was not credible. The Board of Immigration\nAppeals (BIA) affirmed, and also declined to remand for\nconsideration of Nken’s application for adjustment of\nstatus based on his marriage to an American citizen.\nAfter the BIA denied a motion to reopen, Nken filed a\npetition for review of the BIA’s removal order in the Court\nof Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. His petition was denied.\nNken then filed a second motion to reopen, which was also\ndenied, followed by a second petition for review, which was\ndenied as well.\n   Nken filed a third motion to reopen, this time alleging\nthat changed circumstances in Cameroon made his perse\ncution more likely. The BIA denied the motion, finding\nthat Nken had not presented sufficient facts or evidence of\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nchanged country conditions. Nken again sought review in\nthe Court of Appeals, and also moved to stay his deporta\ntion pending resolution of his appeal. In his motion, Nken\nrecognized that Fourth Circuit precedent required an alien\nseeking to stay a removal order to show by “clear and\nconvincing evidence” that the order was “prohibited as a\nmatter of law,” 8 U. S. C. §1252(f)(2). See Teshome-\nGebreegziabher v. Mukasey, 528 F. 3d 330 (CA4 2008).\nNken argued, however, that this standard did not govern.\nThe Court of Appeals denied Nken’s motion without com\nment. App. 74.\n   Nken then applied to this Court for a stay of removal\npending adjudication of his petition for review, and asked\nin the alternative that we grant certiorari to resolve a split\namong the Courts of Appeals on what standard governs a\nrequest for such a stay. Compare Teshome-Gebreegziabher,\nsupra, at 335, and Weng v. U. S. Attorney General, 287\nF. 3d 1335 (CA11 2002), with Arevalo v. Ashcroft, 344\nF. 3d 1 (CA1 2003), Mohammed v.

Gonzales,\n400 F. 3d 482 (CA7 2005), and Andreiu v. Ashcroft, 253\nF. 3d 477 (CA9 2001) (en banc). We granted certiorari,\nand stayed petitioner’s removal pending further order of\nthis Court. Nken v. Mukasey, 555 U. S. ___ (2008).\n                             II\n  The question we agreed to resolve stems from changes\nin judicial review of immigration procedures brought on by\nthe Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsi\nbility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), 110 Stat. 3009–546, which\nsubstantially amended the Immigration and Nationality\nAct (INA), 8 U. S. C. §1101 et seq. When Congress passed\nIIRIRA, it “repealed the old judicial-review scheme set\nforth in [8 U. S. C.] §1105a and instituted a new (and\n4                     NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsignificantly more restrictive) one in 8 U. S. C. §1252.”\nReno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525\nU. S. 471, 475 (1999) (AAADC). The new review system\nsubstantially limited the availability of judicial review and\nstreamlined all challenges to a removal order into a single\nproceeding: the petition for review. See, e.g., 8 U. S. C.\n§1252(a)(2) (barring review of certain removal orders and\nexercises of executive discretion); §1252(b)(3)(C) (estab\nlishing strict filing and briefing deadlines for review pro\nceedings); §1252(b)(9) (consolidating challenges into peti\ntion for review). Three changes effected by IIRIRA are of\nparticular importance to this case.\n   Before IIRIRA, courts of appeals lacked jurisdiction to\nreview the deportation order of an alien who had already\nleft the United States. See §1105a(c) (1994 ed.) (“An order\nof deportation or of exclusion shall not be reviewed by any\ncourt . . . if [the alien] has departed from the United States\nafter the issuance of the order”). Accordingly, an alien\nwho appealed a decision of the BIA was typically entitled\nto remain in the United States for the duration of judicial\nreview. This was achieved through a provision providing\nmost aliens with an automatic stay of their removal order\nwhile judicial review was pending. See §1105a(a)(3) (“The\nservice of the petition for review . . . shall stay the depor\ntation of the alien pending determination of the petition by\nthe court, unless the court otherwise directs”).\n   IIRIRA inverted these provisions to allow for more\nprompt removal. First, Congress lifted the ban on adjudi\ncation of a petition for review once an alien has departed.\nSee IIRIRA §306(b), 110 Stat. 3009–612 (repealing\n§1105a). Second, because courts were no longer prohibited\nfrom proceeding with review once an alien departed, see\nDada v. Mukasey, 554 U. S. 1, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 19–\n20), Congress repealed the presumption of an automatic\nstay, and replaced it with the following: “Service of the\npetition on the officer or employee does not stay the re\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)             5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmoval of an alien pending the court’s decision on the peti\ntion, unless the court orders otherwise.”        8 U. S. C.\n§1252(b)(3)(B) (2006 ed.).\n   Finally, IIRIRA restricted the availability of injunctive\nrelief:\n    “Limit on injunctive relief\n      “(1) In general\n      “Regardless of the nature of the action or claim or of\n    the identity of the party or parties bringing the action,\n    no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have\n    jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the op\n    eration of the provisions of part IV of this subchapter,\n    as amended by [IIRIRA], other than with respect to\n    the application of such provisions to an individual\n    alien against whom proceedings under such part have\n    been initiated.\n      “(2) Particular cases\n      “Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no\n    court shall enjoin the removal of any alien pursuant to\n    a final order under this section unless the alien shows\n    by clear and convincing evidence that the entry or\n    execution of such order is prohibited as a matter of\n    law.” §1252(f).\nThis provision, particularly subsection (f)(2), is the source\nof the parties’ disagreement.\n                            III\n  The parties agree that courts of appeals considering a\npetition for review of a removal order may prevent that\norder from taking effect and therefore block removal while\nadjudicating the petition. They disagree over the standard\na court should apply in deciding whether to do so. Nken\nargues that the “traditional” standard for a stay applies.\nUnder that standard, a court considers four factors: “(1)\nwhether the stay applicant has made a strong showing\n6                     NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the\napplicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3)\nwhether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the\nother parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where\nthe public interest lies.” Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U. S.\n770, 776 (1987).\n   The Government disagrees, arguing that a stay is sim\nply a form of injunction, or alternatively that the relief\npetitioner seeks is more accurately characterized as in\njunctive, and therefore that the limits on injunctive relief\nset forth in subsection (f)(2) apply. Under that provision, a\ncourt may not “enjoin” the removal of an alien subject to a\nfinal removal order, “unless the alien shows by clear and\nconvincing evidence that the entry or execution of such\norder is prohibited as a matter of law.” 8 U. S. C.\n§1252(f)(2). Mindful that statutory interpretation turns\non “the language itself, the specific context in which that\nlanguage is used, and the broader context of the statute as\na whole,” Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341\n(1997), we conclude that the traditional stay factors—not\n§1252(f)(2)—govern a request for a stay pending judicial\nreview.\n                              A\n  An appellate court’s power to hold an order in abeyance\nwhile it assesses the legality of the order has been de\nscribed as “inherent,” preserved in the grant of authority\nto federal courts to “issue all writs necessary or appropri\nate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to\nthe usages and principles of law,” All Writs Act, 28\nU. S. C. §1651(a). See In re McKenzie, 180 U. S. 536, 551\n(1901). The Court highlighted the historic pedigree and\nimportance of the power in Scripps-Howard, 316 U. S. 4,\nholding in that case that Congress’s failure expressly to\nconfer the authority in a statute allowing appellate review\nshould not be taken as an implicit denial of that power.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  The Court in Scripps-Howard did not decide what “cri\nteria . . . should govern the Court in exercising th[e]\npower” to grant a stay. Id., at 17. Nor did the Court\nconsider under what circumstances Congress could deny\nthat authority. See ibid. The power to grant a stay pend\ning review, however, was described as part of a court’s\n“traditional equipment for the administration of justice.”\nId., at 9–10. That authority was “firmly imbedded in our\njudicial system,” “consonant with the historic procedures\nof federal appellate courts,” and “a power as old as the\njudicial system of the nation.” Id., at 13, 17.\n  The authority to hold an order in abeyance pending\nreview allows an appellate court to act responsibly. A\nreviewing court must bring considered judgment to bear\non the matter before it, but that cannot always be done\nquickly enough to afford relief to the party aggrieved by\nthe order under review. The choice for a reviewing court\nshould not be between justice on the fly or participation in\nwhat may be an “idle ceremony.” Id., at 10. The ability to\ngrant interim relief is accordingly not simply “[a]n historic\nprocedure for preserving rights during the pendency of an\nappeal,” id., at 15, but also a means of ensuring that ap\npellate courts can responsibly fulfill their role in the judi\ncial process.\n  At the same time, a reviewing court may not resolve a\nconflict between considered review and effective relief by\nreflexively holding a final order in abeyance pending\nreview. A stay is an “intrusion into the ordinary processes\nof administration and judicial review,” Virginia Petroleum\nJobbers Assn. v. Federal Power Comm’n, 259 F. 2d 921,\n925 (CADC 1958) (per curiam), and accordingly “is not a\nmatter of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise\nresult to the appellant,” Virginian R. Co. v. United States,\n272 U. S. 658, 672 (1926). The parties and the public,\nwhile entitled to both careful review and a meaningful\ndecision, are also generally entitled to the prompt execu\n8                     NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion of orders that the legislature has made final.\n                               B\n   Subsection (f)(2) does not by its terms refer to “stays”\nbut instead to the authority to “enjoin the removal of any\nalien.”     The parties accordingly begin by disputing\nwhether a stay is simply a type of injunction, covered by\nthe term “enjoin,” or a different form of relief. An injunc\ntion and a stay have typically been understood to serve\ndifferent purposes. The former is a means by which a\ncourt tells someone what to do or not to do. When a court\nemploys “the extraordinary remedy of injunction,”\nWeinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S. 305, 312 (1982),\nit directs the conduct of a party, and does so with the\nbacking of its full coercive powers. See Black’s Law Dic\ntionary 784 (6th ed. 1990) (defining “injunction” as “[a]\ncourt order prohibiting someone from doing some specified\nact or commanding someone to undo some wrong or\ninjury”).\n   It is true that “ ‘[i]n a general sense, every order of a\ncourt which commands or forbids is an injunction; but in\nits accepted legal sense, an injunction is a judicial process\nor mandate operating in personam.’ ” Id., at 800 (8th ed.\n2004) (quoting 1 H. Joyce, A Treatise on the Law Relating\nto Injunctions §1, pp. 2–3 (1909)). This is so whether the\ninjunction is preliminary or final; in both contexts, the\norder is directed at someone, and governs that party’s\nconduct.\n   By contrast, instead of directing the conduct of a par\nticular actor, a stay operates upon the judicial proceeding\nitself. It does so either by halting or postponing some\nportion of the proceeding, or by temporarily divesting an\norder of enforceability. See Black’s, supra, at 1413 (6th ed.\n1990) (defining “stay” as “a suspension of the case or some\ndesignated proceedings within it”).\n   A stay pending appeal certainly has some functional\n                    Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\noverlap with an injunction, particularly a preliminary one.\nBoth can have the practical effect of preventing some\naction before the legality of that action has been conclu\nsively determined. But a stay achieves this result by\ntemporarily suspending the source of authority to act—the\norder or judgment in question—not by directing an actor’s\nconduct. A stay “simply suspend[s] judicial alteration of\nthe status quo,” while injunctive relief “grants judicial\nintervention that has been withheld by lower courts.”\nOhio Citizens for Responsible Energy, Inc. v. NRC, 479\nU. S. 1312, 1313 (1986) (SCALIA, J., in chambers); see also\nBrown v. Gilmore, 533 U. S. 1301, 1303 (2001) (Rehnquist,\nC. J., in chambers) (“[A]pplicants are seeking not merely a\nstay of a lower court judgment, but an injunction against\nthe enforcement of a presumptively valid state statute”);\nTurner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 507 U. S. 1301,\n1302 (1993) (same) (“By seeking an injunction, applicants\nrequest that I issue an order altering the legal status\nquo”).\n  An alien seeking a stay of removal pending adjudication\nof a petition for review does not ask for a coercive order\nagainst the Government, but rather for the temporary\nsetting aside of the source of the Government’s authority\nto remove. Although such a stay acts to “ba[r] Executive\nbranch officials from removing [the applicant] from the\ncountry,” post, at 7 (ALITO, J., dissenting), it does so by\nreturning to the status quo—the state of affairs before the\nremoval order was entered.* That kind of stay, “relat[ing]\n——————\n  * The dissent maintains that “[a]n order preventing an executive\nofficer from [enforcing a removal order] does not ‘simply suspend\njudicial alteration of the status quo,’ ” but instead “blocks executive\nofficials from carrying out what they view as proper enforcement of the\nimmigration laws.” Post, at 7 (quoting Ohio Citizens for Responsible\nEnergy, Inc. v. NRC, 479 U. S. 1312, 1313 (1986) (SCALIA, J., in cham\nbers)). But the relief sought here would simply suspend administrative\nalteration of the status quo, and we have long recognized that such\n10                        NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nonly to the conduct or progress of litigation before th[e]\ncourt[,] ordinarily is not considered an injunction.” Gulf\nstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 U. S.\n271, 279 (1988); see Fed. Rule App. Proc. 8(a)(1)(A) (refer\nring to interim relief from “the judgment or order of a\ndistrict court pending appeal” as “a stay”). Whether such\na stay might technically be called an injunction is beside\nthe point; that is not the label by which it is generally\nknown. The sun may be a star, but “starry sky” does not\nrefer to a bright summer day. The terminology of subsec\ntion (f)(2) does not comfortably cover stays.\n   This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that when\nCongress wanted to refer to a stay pending adjudication of\na petition for review in §1252, it used the word “stay.” In\nsubsection (b)(3)(B), under the heading “Stay of order,”\nCongress provided that service of a petition for review\n“does not stay the removal of an alien pending the court’s\ndecision on the petition, unless the court orders other\nwise.” 8 U. S. C. §1252(b)(3)(B). By contrast, the language\nof subsection (f) says nothing about stays, but is instead\ntitled “Limit on injunctive relief,” and refers to the author\nity of courts to “enjoin the removal of any alien.”\n\n——————\ntemporary relief from an administrative order—just like temporary\nrelief from a court order—is considered a stay. See Scripps-Howard\nRadio, Inc. v. FCC, 316 U. S. 4, 10–11 (1942).\n   The dissent would distinguish Scripps-Howard on the ground that\nNken does not really seek to stay a final order of removal, but instead\nseeks “to enjoin the Executive Branch from enforcing his removal order\npending judicial review of an entirely separate order [denying a motion\nto reopen].” Post, at 4, n. But a determination that the BIA should\nhave granted Nken’s motion to reopen would necessarily extinguish the\nfinality of the removal order. See Tr. of Oral Arg. for Respondent 42\n(“[I]f the motion to reopen is granted, that vacates the final order of\nremoval and, therefore, there is no longer a final order of removal\npursuant to which the alien could be removed”). The relief sought here\nis properly termed a “stay” because it suspends the effect of the removal\norder.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n§1252(f)(2).\n   “[W]here Congress includes particular language in one\nsection of a statute but omits it in another section of the\nsame Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts\nintentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or\nexclusion.” INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421, 432\n(1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). This is particu\nlarly true here, where subsections (b)(3)(B) and (f)(2) were\nenacted as part of a unified overhaul of judicial review\nprocedures.\n   Subsection (b)(3)(B) changed the basic rules covering\nstays of removal, and would have been the natural place to\nlocate an amendment to the traditional standard govern\ning the grant of stays. Under the Government’s view,\nhowever, Congress placed such a provision four subsec\ntions later, in a subsection that makes no mention of\nstays, next to a provision prohibiting classwide injunctions\nagainst the operation of removal provisions. See 8 U. S. C.\n§1252(f)(1) (permitting injunctions only “with respect to\nthe application of such provisions to an individual alien”);\nAAADC, 525 U. S., at 481–482. Although the dissent\n“would not read too much into Congress’ decision to locate\nsuch a provision in one subsection rather than in another,”\npost, at 8, the Court frequently takes Congress’s structural\nchoices into consideration when interpreting statutory\nprovisions. See, e.g., Florida Dept. of Revenue v. Piccadilly\nCafeterias, Inc., 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 13).\n   The Government counters that petitioner’s view “fails to\ngive any operative effect to Section 1252(f)(2).” Brief for\nRespondent 32. Initially, this argument undercuts the\nGovernment’s textual reading. It is one thing to propose\nthat “enjoin” in subsection (f)(2) covers a broad spectrum\nof court orders and relief, including both stays and more\ntypical injunctions. It is quite another to suggest that\nCongress used “enjoin” to refer exclusively to stays, so that\na failure to include stays in subsection (f)(2) would render\n12                   NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe provision superfluous. If nothing else, the terms are\nby no means synonymous.\n   Leaving that aside, there is something to the Govern\nment’s point; the exact role of subsection (f)(2) under\npetitioner’s view is not easy to explain. Congress may\nhave been concerned about the possibility that courts\nwould enjoin application of particular provisions of the\nINA, see 8 U. S. C. §1252(f)(1) (prohibiting injunctions\n“other than with respect to the application of [Section IV\nof the INA] to an individual alien”), or about injunctions\nthat might be available under the limited habeas provi\nsions of subsection (e). Or perhaps subsection (f)(2) was\nsimply included as a catchall provision raising the bar on\nany availability (even unforeseeable availability) of “the\nextraordinary remedy of injunction.” Weinberger, 456\nU. S., at 312. In any event, the Government’s point is not\nenough to outweigh the strong indications that subsection\n(f)(2) is not reasonably understood to be directed at stays.\n                              C\n   Applying the subsection (f)(2) standard to stays pending\nappeal would not fulfill the historic office of such a stay.\nThe whole idea is to hold the matter under review in\nabeyance because the appellate court lacks sufficient time\nto decide the merits. Under the subsection (f)(2) standard,\nhowever, a stay would only be granted after the court in\neffect decides the merits, in an expedited manner. The\ncourt would have to do so under a standard—“clear and\nconvincing evidence”—that does not so much preserve the\navailability of subsequent review as render it redundant.\nSubsection (f)(2), in short, would invert the customary role\nof a stay, requiring a definitive merits decision earlier\nrather than later.\n   The authority to grant stays has historically been justi\nfied by the perceived need “to prevent irreparable injury to\nthe parties or to the public” pending review. Scripps\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nHoward, 316 U. S., at 9. Subsection (f)(2) on its face,\nhowever, does not allow any consideration of harm, irrepa\nrable or otherwise, even harm that may deprive the\nmovant of his right to petition for review of the removal\norder. Subsection (f)(2) does not resolve the dilemma stays\nhistorically addressed: what to do when there is insuffi\ncient time to resolve the merits and irreparable harm may\nresult from delay. The provision instead requires deciding\nthe merits under a higher standard, without regard to the\nprospect of irreparable harm.\n  In short, applying the subsection (f)(2) standard in the\nstay context results in something that does not remotely\nlook like a stay. Just like the Court in Scripps-Howard,\nwe are loath to conclude that Congress would, “without\nclearly expressing such a purpose, deprive the Court of\nAppeals of its customary power to stay orders under re\nview.” Id., at 11. Subsection (f)(2) would certainly deprive\ncourts of their “customary” stay power. Our review does\nnot convince us that Congress did that in subsection (f)(2).\nThe four-factor test is the “traditional” one, Hilton, 481\nU. S., at 777, and the Government has not overcome the\n“presumption favoring the retention of long-established\nand familiar principles, except when a statutory purpose\nto the contrary is evident.” Isbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson,\n343 U. S. 779, 783 (1952). We agree with petitioner that\nan alien need not satisfy the demanding standard of\n§1252(f)(2) when asking a court of appeals to stay removal\npending judicial review.\n                               IV\n  So what standard does govern? The question presented,\nas noted, offers the alternative of “ ‘the traditional test for\nstays,’ ” 555 U. S., at ___, but the parties dispute what that\ntest is. See Brief for Respondent 46 (“[T]he four-part stan\ndard requires a more demanding showing than petitioner\nsuggests”); Reply Brief for Petitioner 26 (“The Government\n14                     NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nargues . . . that the [stay] test should be reformulated”).\n   “A stay is not a matter of right, even if irreparable\ninjury might otherwise result.” Virginian R. Co., 272\nU. S., at 672. It is instead “an exercise of judicial discre\ntion,” and “[t]he propriety of its issue is dependent upon\nthe circumstances of the particular case.” Id., at 672–673;\nsee Hilton, supra, at 777 (“[T]he traditional stay factors\ncontemplate individualized judgments in each case”). The\nparty requesting a stay bears the burden of showing that\nthe circumstances justify an exercise of that discretion.\nSee, e.g., Clinton v. Jones, 520 U. S. 681, 708 (1997);\nLandis v. North American Co., 299 U. S. 248, 255 (1936).\n   The fact that the issuance of a stay is left to the court’s\ndiscretion “does not mean that no legal standard governs\nthat discretion. . . . ‘[A] motion to [a court’s] discretion is a\nmotion, not to its inclination, but to its judgment; and its\njudgment is to be guided by sound legal principles.’ ”\nMartin v. Franklin Capital Corp., 546 U. S. 132, 139\n(2005) (quoting United States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 30, 35\n(No. 14,692d) (CC Va. 1807) (Marshall, C. J.)). As noted\nearlier, those legal principles have been distilled into\nconsideration of four factors: “(1) whether the stay appli\ncant has made a strong showing that he is likely to suc\nceed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be ir\nreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of\nthe stay will substantially injure the other parties inter\nested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest\nlies.” Hilton, supra, at 776. There is substantial overlap\nbetween these and the factors governing preliminary\ninjunctions, see Winter v. Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil, Inc., 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 14); not\nbecause the two are one and the same, but because similar\nconcerns arise whenever a court order may allow or disal\nlow anticipated action before the legality of that action has\nbeen conclusively determined.\n   The first two factors of the traditional standard are the\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmost critical. It is not enough that the chance of success\non the merits be “better than negligible.” Sofinet v. INS,\n188 F. 3d 703, 707 (CA7 1999) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Even petitioner acknowledges that “[m]ore than\na mere ‘possibility’ of relief is required.” Reply Brief for\nPetitioner 21 (quoting Brief for Respondent 47). By the\nsame token, simply showing some “possibility of irrepara\nble injury,” Abbassi v. INS, 143 F. 3d 513, 514 (CA9 1998),\nfails to satisfy the second factor. As the Court pointed out\nearlier this Term, the “ ‘possibility’ standard is too leni\nent.” Winter, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 12).\n   Although removal is a serious burden for many aliens, it\nis not categorically irreparable, as some courts have said.\nSee, e.g., Ofosu v. McElroy, 98 F. 3d 694, 699 (CA2 1996)\n(“[O]rdinarily, when a party seeks [a stay] pending appeal,\nit is deemed that exclusion is an irreparable harm”); see\nalso Petitioner’s Emergency Motion for a Stay 12 (“[T]he\nequities particularly favor the alien facing deportation in\nimmigration cases where failure to grant the stay would\nresult in deportation before the alien has been able to\nobtain judicial review”).\n   The automatic stay prior to IIRIRA reflected a recogni\ntion of the irreparable nature of harm from removal before\ndecision on a petition for review, given that the petition\nabated upon removal. Congress’s decision in IIRIRA to\nallow continued prosecution of a petition after removal\neliminated the reason for categorical stays, as reflected in\nthe repeal of the automatic stay in subsection (b)(3)(B). It\nis accordingly plain that the burden of removal alone\ncannot constitute the requisite irreparable injury. Aliens\nwho are removed may continue to pursue their petitions\nfor review, and those who prevail can be afforded effective\nrelief by facilitation of their return, along with restoration\nof the immigration status they had upon removal. See\nBrief for Respondent 44.\n   Once an applicant satisfies the first two factors, the\n16                   NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntraditional stay inquiry calls for assessing the harm to the\nopposing party and weighing the public interest. These\nfactors merge when the Government is the opposing party.\nIn considering them, courts must be mindful that the\nGovernment’s role as the respondent in every removal\nproceeding does not make the public interest in each\nindividual one negligible, as some courts have concluded.\nSee, e.g., Mohammed, 309 F. 3d, at 102 (Government harm\nis nothing more than “one alien [being] permitted to re\nmain while an appeal is decided”); Ofosu, supra, at 699\n(the Government “suffers no offsetting injury” in removal\ncases).\n  Of course there is a public interest in preventing aliens\nfrom being wrongfully removed, particularly to countries\nwhere they are likely to face substantial harm. But that is\nno basis for the blithe assertion of an “absence of any\ninjury to the public interest” when a stay is granted.\nPetitioner’s Emergency Motion for a Stay 13. There is\nalways a public interest in prompt execution of removal\norders: The continued presence of an alien lawfully\ndeemed removable undermines the streamlined removal\nproceedings IIRIRA established, and “permit[s] and pro\nlong[s] a continuing violation of United States law.”\nAAADC, 525 U. S., at 490. The interest in prompt removal\nmay be heightened by the circumstances as well—if, for\nexample, the alien is particularly dangerous, or has sub\nstantially prolonged his stay by abusing the processes\nprovided to him. See ibid. (“Postponing justifiable depor\ntation (in the hope that the alien’s status will change—by,\nfor example, marriage to an American citizen—or simply\nwith the object of extending the alien’s unlawful stay) is\noften the principal object of resistance to a deportation\nproceeding”). A court asked to stay removal cannot simply\nassume that “[o]rdinarily, the balance of hardships will\nweigh heavily in the applicant’s favor.” Andreiu, 253\nF. 3d, at 484.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

This is the\nless stringent of the two standards at issue. See Kenyeres\nv. Ashcroft, 538 U. S. 1301, 1303–1305 (2003) (KENNEDY,\nJ., in chambers).\n   It seems appropriate to underscore that in most cases\nthe debate about which standard should apply will have\nlittle practical effect provided the court considering the\nstay application adheres to the demanding standard set\nforth. A stay of removal is an extraordinary remedy that\nshould not be granted in the ordinary case, much less\nawarded as of right. Virginian R. Co. v. United States, 272\nU. S. 658, 672–673 (1926); see also Winter v. Natural\nResources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2008)\n(slip op., at 14).\n   No party has provided the Court with empirical data on\nthe number of stays granted, the correlation between stays\ngranted and ultimate success on the merits, or similar\nmatters. The statistics would be helpful so that experi\nence can demonstrate whether this decision yields a fair\nand effective result. Then, too, Congress can evaluate\nwhether its policy objectives are being realized by the\n2                    NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nlegislation it has enacted. Based on the Government’s\nrepresentations at oral argument, however, there are\ngrounds for concern. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 35 (“[W]e do not\nhave empirical data, . . . but [stays of removal] are—in the\nNinth Circuit in our experience— . . . granted quite fre\nquently”). This concern is of particular importance in\nthose Circuits with States on our international borders.\nThe Court of Appeals for Ninth Circuit, for example, con\nsiders over half of all immigration petitions filed nation\nwide, and immigration cases compose nearly half of the\nNinth Circuit’s docket. See Catterson, Symposium, Ninth\nCircuit Conference: Changes in Appellate Caseload and Its\nProcessing, 48 Ariz. L. Rev. 287, 297 (2006).\n   Under either standard, even the less stringent standard\nthe Court adopts today, courts should not grant stays of\nremoval on a routine basis. The passage of the Illegal\nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of\n1996 (IIRIRA), 110 Stat. 3009–546, reinforces this point.\nBefore IIRIRA, aliens who left the United States no longer\nhad the ability to seek review of their removal orders, see\n8 U. S. C. §1105a(c) (1994 ed.) (repealed 1996), so they\ncould more easily have established irreparable harm due\nto their removal. It is perhaps for this reason Congress\ndecided to “stay the deportation of [an] alien pending\ndetermination of the petition by the court, unless the court\notherwise direct[ed].” §1105a(a)(3) (same). IIRIRA, how\never, removed that prohibition (as well as the automatic\nstay provision), and courts may now review petitions after\naliens have been removed. See Brief for Respondent 44;\nante, at 4, 15; post, at 5, 9 (ALITO, J., dissenting).\n   This change should mean that obtaining a stay of re\nmoval is more difficult. Under the Court’s four-part stan\ndard, the alien must show both irreparable injury and a\nlikelihood of success on the merits, in addition to estab\nlishing that the interests of the parties and the public\nweigh in his or her favor. Ante, at 14–15. As the Court\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nexplains, because aliens may continue to seek review and\nobtain relief after removal, “the burden of removal alone\ncannot constitute the requisite irreparable injury.” Ante,\nat 15. As a result of IIRIRA there must be a particular\nized, irreparable harm beyond mere removal to justify a\nstay.\n   That is not to say that demonstration of irreparable\nharm, without more, is sufficient to justify a stay of re\nmoval. The Court has held that “[a] stay is not a matter of\nright, even if irreparable injury might otherwise result.”\nVirginian R. Co., supra, at 672. When considering success\non the merits and irreparable harm, courts cannot dis\npense with the required showing of one simply because\nthere is a strong likelihood of the other. This is evident in\nthe decisions of Justices of the Court applying the tradi\ntional factors. See, e.g., Curry v. Baker, 479 U. S. 1301,\n1302 (1986) (Powell, J., in chambers) (“It is no doubt true\nthat, absent [a stay], the applicant here will suffer irrepa\nrable injury. This fact alone is not sufficient to justify a\nstay”); Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 463 U. S. 1315, 1317\n(1983) (Blackmun, J., in chambers) (“[L]ikelihood of suc\ncess on the merits need not be considered . . . if the appli\ncant fails to show irreparable injury from the denial of the\nstay”). As those decisions make clear, “ ‘the applicant\nmust meet a heavy burden of showing not only that the\njudgment of the lower court was erroneous on the merits,\nbut also that the applicant will suffer irreparable injury if\nthe judgment is not stayed pending his appeal.’ ” Williams\nv.

See 8 U. S. C. §1229a(a);\n8 CFR §§1240.1(a)(1)(i), (c) (2008). If the IJ enters an\norder of removal, that order becomes final when the alien’s\nappeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) is\nunsuccessful or the alien declines to appeal to the Board.\nSee 8 U. S. C. §1101(47)(B); 8 CFR §§1241.1, 1241.31.\nOnce an order of removal has become final, it may be\nexecuted at any time. See 8 U. S. C. §§1231(a)(1)(B)(i),\n1252(b)(8)(C); 8 CFR §1241.33. Removal orders “are self\nexecuting orders, not dependent upon judicial enforce\nment.” Stone v. INS, 514 U. S. 386, 398 (1995).\n  After the removal order is final and enforceable, the\nalien may file a motion to reopen before the IJ, see 8\nU. S. C. §1229a(c)(7), or a petition for review before the\n2                    NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nappropriate court of appeals, see §1252(a)(1). While either\nchallenge is pending, the alien may ask the Executive\nBranch to stay its own hand. See 8 CFR §§241.6(a)–(b),\n1241.6(a)–(b). If, however, the alien wants a court to\nrestrain the Executive from executing a final and enforce\nable removal order, the alien must seek an injunction to do\nso. See 8 U. S. C. §1252(a)(1) (making a final order of\nremoval subject to 28 U. S. C. §2349(b), which provides\nthat an “interlocutory injunction” can “restrain” the “exe\ncution of” a final order).

C, 110 Stat. 3009–546, provides the\nrelevant legal standard for granting such relief: “Notwith\nstanding any other provision of law, no court shall enjoin\nthe removal of any alien pursuant to a final order under\nthis section unless the alien shows by clear and convincing\nevidence that the entry or execution of such order is pro\nhibited as a matter of law.” 8 U. S. C. §1252(f)(2).\n                             II\n  In my view, petitioner’s request for an order preventing\nhis removal pending disposition of his current petition for\nreview was governed by 8 U. S. C. §1252(f)(2). Petitioner\nis “remova[ble] . . . pursuant to a final order,” and he\nsought a court order to “enjoin” the Executive Branch’s\nexecution of that removal.\n                             A\n  There is no dispute that petitioner is “remova[ble] . . .\npursuant to a final order.” Ibid. On March 4, 2005, the IJ\ndetermined that petitioner was removable under\n§1227(a)(1)(B) and denied his claims for asylum, withhold\ning of removal, and protection under the Convention\nAgainst Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading\nTreatment or Punishment (CAT), Dec. 10, 1984, S. Treaty\nDoc. No. 100–20, 1465 U. N. T. S. 85. See App. 32–43.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nPetitioner appealed to the Board, and on June 16, 2006,\nthe Board affirmed. Id., at 44–49. On that date, peti\ntioner’s order of removal became administratively final,\nand the Executive Branch became legally entitled to re\nmove him from the United States.        See 8 U. S. C.\n§1231(a)(1)(B)(i); 8 CFR §1241.33(a).\n                              B\n    The only remaining question, therefore, is whether the\ninterim equitable relief that petitioner sought was an\norder “enjoin[ing]” his removal as that term is used in 8\nU. S. C. §1252(f)(2). I believe that it was.\n    In ordinary usage, the term “enjoin” means to “require,”\n“command,” or “direct” an action, or to “require a person\n. . . to perform, or to abstain or desist from, some act.”\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 529 (6th ed. 1990) (hereinafter\nBlack’s). See also Webster’s Third New International\nDictionary 754 (1993) (defining “enjoin” to mean “to direct,\nprescribe, or impose by order”; “to prohibit or restrain by a\njudicial order or decree”). When an alien subject to a final\norder of removal seeks to bar executive officials from\nacting upon that order pending judicial consideration of a\npetition for review, the alien is seeking to “enjoin” his or\nher removal. The alien is seeking an order “restrain[ing]”\nthose officials and “requir[ing]” them to “abstain” from\nexecuting the order of removal.\n    The Court concludes that §1252(f)(2) does not apply in\nthis case because, in the Court’s view, that provision\napplies only to requests for an injunction and not to re\nquests for a stay. That conclusion is wrong for at least\nthree reasons.\n                             1\n  First, a stay is “a kind of injunction,” Black’s 1413, as\neven the Court grudgingly concedes, see ante, at 10 (an\norder blocking an alien’s removal pending judicial review\n4                          NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n“might technically be called an injunction”). See also\nTeshome-Gebreegziabher v. Mukasey, 528 F. 3d 330, 333\n(CA4 2008) (the term “stay” “is a subset of the broader\nterm ‘enjoin,’ ”); Kijowska v. Haines, 463 F. 3d 583, 589\n(CA7 2006) (a stay “is a form of injunction”); Weng v.\nUnited States Atty. Gen., 287 F. 3d 1335, 1338 (CA11\n2002) (“[T]he plain meaning of enjoin includes the grant of\na stay”).*\n   Both statutes and judicial decisions refer to orders that\n“stay” legal proceedings as injunctions. For example, the\nAnti-Injunction Act provides that “[a] court of the United\nStates may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in\na State court.” 28 U. S. C. §2283. See also Hill v.\nMcDonough, 547 U. S. 573, 578–580 (2006) (habeas peti\ntioner sought injunction to stay his execution); McMillen\n——————\n   * Thus, it is unremarkable that we have used the word “stay” to de\nscribe an injunction blocking an administrative order pending judicial\nreview. See Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc. v. FCC, 316 U. S. 4 (1942);\nante, at 9–10, n. Indeed, our decision in Scripps-Howard, supra, at\n11—like the Court’s decision today, ante, at 7, 14—relied heavily on\nVirginian R. Co. v. United States, 272 U. S. 658 (1926), the latter of\nwhich referred to “stays” as a subset of “injunctions.” See id., at 669\n(noting that the power to issue a “stay” “to preserve the status quo\npending appeal” is “an incident” of the power “to enjoin” an administra\ntive order); see also id., at 671–672 (referring interchangeably to a\nthree-judge district court’s power to issue “injunctions” and “stays”). In\nany event, both Scripps-Howard and Virginian are inapposite because\npetitioner here did not seek to “stay” his removal order pending judicial\nreview of that order; rather, he sought to enjoin the Executive Branch\nfrom enforcing his removal order pending judicial review of an entirely\nseparate order. See Stone v. INS, 514 U. S. 386, 395 (1995) (holding\nthat the IJ’s removal order and the Board’s denial of a motion to reopen\nare “two separate final orders”); Bak v. INS, 682 F. 2d 441, 442 (CA3\n1982) (per curiam) (“The general rule is that a motion to reopen depor\ntation proceedings is a new, independently reviewable order”); Brief for\nRespondent 51–52 (differentiating petitioner’s challenge to the IJ’s\nremoval order, which “became final well over a year ago,” from “peti\ntioner’s latest challenge[, which] is currently pending” before the Court\nof Appeals); id., at 13–14, 36–37 (similar).\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)              5\n\n                       ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nv. Anderson, 95 U. S. 37, 42 (1877) (“[Petitioner] can, if he\nis wrongfully taxed, stay the proceeding for its collection\nby process of injunction”); Nivens v. Gilchrist, 319 F. 3d\n151, 153 (CA4 2003) (denial of “injunction” to “stay [a]\ntrial”); Jove Eng., Inc. v. IRS, 92 F. 3d 1539, 1546 (CA11\n1996) (automatic stay is “essentially a court-ordered in\njunction”). And it is revealing that the standard that the\nCourt adopts for determining whether a stay should be\nordered is the standard that is used in weighing an appli\ncation for a preliminary injunction. Ante, at 14 (adopting\npreliminary injunction standard set out in Winter v. Natu\nral Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U. S. ___, ___\n(2008) (slip op., at 14)).\n                               2\n   Second, the context surrounding IIRIRA’s enactment\nsuggests that §1252(f)(2) was an important—not a super\nfluous—statutory provision. This Court should interpret\nit accordingly.\n   IIRIRA was designed to expedite removal and restrict\nthe ability of aliens to remain in this country pending\njudicial review. Before IIRIRA, the filing of a petition for\nreview automatically stayed removal unless the court of\nappeals directed otherwise. 8 U. S. C. §1105a(a)(3) (1994\ned.) (repealed 1996). IIRIRA repealed this provision and,\nto drive home the point, specifically provided that\n“[s]ervice of the petition [for judicial review] . . . does not\nstay the removal of an alien pending the court’s decision\non the petition, unless the court orders otherwise.”\n§1252(b)(3)(B) (2006 ed.) (emphasis added). In addition,\n“many provisions of IIRIRA are aimed at protecting the\nExecutive’s discretion from the courts.” Reno v. American-\nArab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U. S. 471, 486\n(1999) (emphasis deleted). Indeed, “protecting the Execu\ntive’s discretion from the courts . . . can fairly be said to be\nthe theme of the legislation.” Ibid. Section 1252(f)(2),\n6                     NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwhich provides that a court may not block removal during\nthe judicial review process unless a heightened standard is\nmet, fits perfectly within this scheme.\n   The Court’s interpretation, by contrast, produces\nanomalous results. If §1252(f)(2) does not provide the\nstandard to be used by the courts in determining whether\nan alien should be permitted to remain in this country\npending judicial review, then IIRIRA left the formulation\nof that standard entirely to the discretion of the courts. A\nCongress that sought to expedite removal and limit judi\ncial discretion is unlikely to have taken that approach.\n   More important, if §1252(f)(2) does not set the standard\nfor blocking removal pending judicial review, then, as the\nCourt concedes, “the exact role of subsection (f)(2) . . . is\nnot easy to explain.” Ante, at 12. “In construing a statute\nwe are obliged to give effect, if possible, to every word\nCongress used.” Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330,\n339 (1979). We should not lightly conclude that Congress\nenacted a provision that serves no function, and the\nCourt’s hyper-technical distinction between an injunction\nand a stay does not provide a sufficient justification for\nadopting an interpretation that renders §1252(f)(2) mean\ningless. That result is particularly anomalous in the\ncontext of §1252(f)(2), which Congress said should apply\n“[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law.”\n                              3\n    Third, if stays and injunctions really are two entirely\ndistinct concepts, the order that petitioner sought here is\nbest viewed as an injunction. Insofar as there is a differ\nence between the two concepts, I agree with the Court that\nit boils down to this: “A stay ‘simply suspend[s] judicial\nalteration of the status quo,’ ” whereas an injunction\n“ ‘grants judicial intervention that has been withheld by\nlower courts.’ ” Ante, at 9 (quoting Ohio Citizens for Re\nsponsible Energy, Inc. v. NRC, 479 U. S. 1312, 1313 (1986)\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n(SCALIA, J., in chambers)). See also Black’s 1413 (defining\na stay as an “act of arresting a judicial proceeding by the\norder of a court”). Here, petitioner did not seek an order\n“suspend[ing] judicial alteration of the status quo.” In\nstead, he sought an order barring Executive branch offi\ncials from removing him from the country. Such an order\nis best viewed as an injunction. See McCarthy v. Briscoe,\n429 U. S. 1317, 1317, n. 1 (1976) (Powell, J., in chambers)\n(although applicants claimed to seek a “stay,” the court\ngranted an “injunction” because “the applicants actually\n[sought] affirmative relief” against executive officials).\n   Even if petitioner had sought to block his removal pend\ning judicial review of the order of removal, any interim\norder blocking his removal would best be termed an in\njunction. When the Board affirmed petitioner’s final\nremoval order in 2006, it gave the Executive Branch all of\nthe legal authority it needed to remove petitioner from the\nUnited States immediately. An order preventing an ex\necutive officer from exercising that authority does not\n“simply suspend judicial alteration of the status quo.”\nOhio Citizens for Responsible Energy, supra, at 1313.\nInstead, such an order is most properly termed an injunc\ntion because it blocks executive officials from carrying out\nwhat they view as proper enforcement of the immigration\nlaws. And in that regard, it is significant that the Hobbs\nAct—which governs judicial review under IIRIRA, see 8\nU. S. C. §1252(a)(1)—refers to an “application for an inter\nlocutory injunction restraining or suspending the enforce\nment, operation, or execution of, or setting aside” a final\nadministrative order. 28 U. S. C. §2349(b) (emphasis\nadded).\n   In the present case, however, petitioner did not seek to\nblock his removal pending judicial review of his final order\nof removal. That review concluded long ago. What peti\ntioner asked for was an order barring the Executive\nBranch from removing him pending judicial review of an\n8                     NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nentirely different order, the Board’s order denying his\nthird motion to reopen the proceedings. Petitioner’s cur\nrent petition for review does not contest the correctness of\nthe removal order. Rather, he argues that the Board\nshould have set aside that order due to alleged changes in\nconditions in his home country. A motion to reopen an\nadministrative proceeding that is no longer subject to\ndirect judicial review surely seeks “ ‘an order altering the\nstatus quo.’ ” Ante, at 9 (quoting Turner Broadcasting\nSystem, Inc. v. FCC, 507 U. S. 1301, 1302 (1993)\n(Rehnquist, C. J., in chambers)). Consequently, the relief\nthat petitioner sought here is best categorized as an\ninjunction.\n                               III\n   In addition to its highly technical distinction between an\ninjunction and a stay, the Court advances several other\njustifications for its decision, but none is persuasive.\n   The Court argues that applying 8 U. S. C. §1252(f)(2)\nwould “deprive” us of our “ ‘customary’ stay power.” Ante,\nat 13. As noted above, however, restricting judicial discre\ntion was “the theme” of IIRIRA, American-Arab Anti-\nDiscrimination Comm., 525 U. S., at 486. And Congress is\nfree to regulate or eliminate the relief that federal courts\nmay award, within constitutional limits that the Court\ndoes not invoke here. Cf. INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289,\n299–300 (2001).\n   The Court opines that subsection (b)(3)(B)—not subsec\ntion (f)(2)—is “the natural place to locate an amendment\nto the traditional standard governing the grant of stays.”\nAnte, at 11. But I would not read too much into Congress’\ndecision to locate such a provision in one subsection rather\nthan in another subsection of the same provision. In\naddition, there is also nothing “unnatural” about Congress’\nuse of two separate subsections of §1252 to address a\ncommon subject. For example, §1252(a)(2)(A) lists several\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           9\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nmatters over which “no court shall have jurisdiction to\nreview,” while §1252(g) lists another subject over which\n“no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or\nclaim.” The fact that those provisions are separated by\nfive subsections and framed in slightly different terms\ndoes not justify ignoring them, just as the space and dif\nference in terminology between §1252(b)(3)(B) and\n§1252(f)(2) cannot justify the Court’s result.\n   Noting that the term “stay” is used in §1252(b)(3)(B) but\nnot in §1252(f)(2), the Court infers that Congress did not\nintend that the latter provision apply to stays. Ante, at\n10–11. But the use of the term “stay” in subsection\n(b)(3)(B) is easy to explain. As noted above, prior to\nIIRIRA, the Immigration and Nationality Act provided for\nan automatic “stay” of deportation upon the filing of a\npetition for review unless the court of appeals directed\notherwise. See 8 U. S. C. §1105a(a)(3) (1994 ed.) (repealed\n1996). The statute provided:\n    “The service of the petition for review upon [the At\n    torney General’s agents] shall stay the deportation of\n    the alien pending determination of the petition by the\n    court . . . unless the court otherwise directs . . . .”\n    Ibid. (emphasis added).\nIn IIRIRA, Congress repealed that provision and, to make\nsure that the pre-IIRIRA practice would not be continued,\nenacted a new provision that explicitly inverted the prior\nrule:\n    “Service of the petition on the officer or employee does\n    not stay the removal of an alien pending the court’s\n    decision on the petition, unless the court orders oth\n    erwise.” §1252(b)(3)(B) (2006 ed.) (emphasis added).\nIt is thus apparent that §1252(b)(3)(B) uses the term\n“stay” because that is the term that was used in the provi\nsion that it replaced.\n10                   NKEN v. HOLDER\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n  Finally, the Court worries that applying §1252(f)(2)\nwould create inequitable results by allowing removable\naliens to remain in the United States only if they can\nprove the merits of their claims under a “higher standard”\nthan the one they would otherwise have to satisfy. Ante,\nat 13. But as the Court acknowledges, ante, at 4, IIRIRA\nspecifically contemplated that most aliens wishing to\ncontest final orders of removal would be forced to pursue\ntheir appeals from abroad. See §306(b), 110 Stat. 3009–\n612 (repealing 8 U. S. C. §1105a (1994 ed.)). If such an\nalien seeks to remain in the United States pending judicial\nreview, IIRIRA provides that the alien must make the\nheightened showing required under §1252(f)(2). Congress\ndid not think that this scheme is inequitable, and we must\nheed what §1252(f)(2) prescribes.\n                         *   *    *\n  In my view, the Fourth Circuit was correct to apply\n§1252(f)(2) and to deny petitioner’s application for an\norder barring his removal pending judicial review. There\nfore, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145884/", "sha1": "b0790b5a7939a42416f4f0925170627f486d4e80", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-047", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:08:55"}
