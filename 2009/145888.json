UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 07–10441.       Argued January 21, 2009—Decided April 6, 2009\nMcNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332, and Mallory v. United States,\n 354 U. S. 449, “generally rende[r] inadmissible confessions made dur\n ing periods of detention that violat[e] the prompt presentment re\n quirement of [Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure] 5(a).” United\n States v. Alvarez-Sanchez, 511 U. S. 350, 354. Rule 5(a), in turn, pro\n vides that a “person making an arrest . . . must take the defendant\n without unnecessary delay before a magistrate judge . . . .” Congress\n enacted 18 U. S. C. §3501 in response to Miranda v. Arizona, 384\n U. S. 436, and some applications of the McNabb-Mallory rule. In an\n attempt to eliminate Miranda, §3501(a) provides that “a confession\n . . . shall be admissible in evidence if it is voluntarily given,” and\n §3501(b) lists several considerations for courts to address in assess\n ing voluntariness. Subsection (c), which focuses on McNabb-Mallory,\n provides that “a confession made . . . by . . . a defendant . . . , while\n . . . under arrest . . . , shall not be inadmissible solely because of delay\n in bringing such person before a magistrate judge . . . if such confes\n sion is found by the trial judge to have been made voluntarily and . . .\n within six hours [of arrest]”; it extends that time limit when further\n delay is “reasonable considering the means of transportation and the\n distance to . . . the nearest available [magistrate].”\n     Petitioner Corley was arrested for assaulting a federal officer at\n about 8 a.m. Around 11:45 FBI agents took him to a Philadelphia\n hospital to treat a minor injury. At 3:30 p.m. he was taken from the\n hospital to the local FBI office and told that he was a suspect in a\n bank robbery. Though the office was in the same building as the\n nearest magistrate judges, the agents did not bring him before a\n magistrate judge, but questioned him, hoping for a confession. At\n 5:27 p.m., some 9.5 hours after his arrest, Corley began an oral con\n2                      CORLEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    fession that he robbed the bank. He asked for a break at 6:30 and\n    was held overnight. The interrogation resumed the next morning,\n    ending with his signed written confession. He was finally presented\n    to a Magistrate Judge at 1:30 p.m., 29.5 hours after his arrest, and\n    charged with armed bank robbery and related charges. The District\n    Court denied his motion to suppress his confessions under Rule 5(a)\n    and McNabb-Mallory. It reasoned that the oral confession occurred\n    within §3501(c)’s six-hour window because the time of Corley’s medi\n    cal treatment should be excluded from the delay. It also found the\n    written confession admissible, explaining there was no unreasonable\n    delay under Rule 5(a) because Corley had requested the break. He\n    was convicted of conspiracy and bank robbery. The Third Circuit af\n    firmed. Relying on Circuit precedent to the effect that §3501 abro\n    gated McNabb-Mallory and replaced it with a pure voluntariness\n    test, it concluded that if a district court found a confession voluntary\n    after considering the points listed in §3501(b), it would be admissible,\n    even if the presentment delay was unreasonable.\nHeld: Section 3501 modified McNabb-Mallory but did not supplant it.\n Pp. 8–18.\n    (a) The Government claims that because §3501(a) makes a confes\n sion “admissible” “if it is voluntarily given,” it entirely eliminates\n McNabb-Mallory with its bar to admitting even a voluntary confes\n sion if given during an unreasonable presentment delay. Corley ar\n gues that §3501(a) was only meant to overrule Miranda, and notes\n that only §3501(c) touches on McNabb-Mallory, making the rule in\n applicable to confessions given within six hours of an arrest. He has\n the better argument. Pp. 8–16.\n      (1) The Government’s reading renders §3501(c) nonsensical and\n superfluous. If subsection (a) really meant that any voluntary con\n fession was admissible, then subsection (c) would add nothing; if a\n confession was “made voluntarily” it would be admissible, period, and\n never “inadmissible solely because of delay,” even a delay beyond six\n hours. The Government’s reading is thus at odds with the basic in\n terpretive canon that “ ‘[a] statute should be construed [to give effect]\n to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,\n void or insignificant.’ ” Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88, 101. The Gov\n ernment claims that in providing that a confession “shall not be ad\n missible,” Congress meant that a confession “shall not be [involun\n tary].” Thus read, (c) would specify a bright-line rule applying (a) to\n cases of delay: it would tell courts that delay alone does not make a\n confession involuntary unless the delay exceeds six hours. But\n “ ‘Congress did not write the statute that way.’ ” Russello v. United\n States, 464 U. S. 16, 23. The terms “inadmissible” and “involuntary”\n are not synonymous. Congress used both in (c), and this Court\n                   Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n“would not presume to ascribe this difference to a simple mistake in\ndraftsmanship.” Ibid. There is also every reason to believe that\nCongress used the distinct terms deliberately, specifying two criteria\nthat must be satisfied to prevent a confession from being “inadmissi\nble solely because of delay”: the confession must be “[1] made volun\ntarily and . . . [2] within six hours [of arrest].” Moreover, under the\nMcNabb-Mallory rule, “inadmissible” and “involuntary” mean differ\nent things. Corley’s position, in contrast, gives effect to both (c) and\n(a), by reading (a) as overruling Miranda and (c) as qualifying\nMcNabb-Mallory.          The Government’s counterargument—that\nCorley’s reading would also create a conflict, since (a) makes all vol\nuntary confessions admissible while (c) would leave some voluntary\nconfessions inadmissible—falls short. First, (a) is a broad directive\nwhile (c) aims only at McNabb-Mallory, and “a more specific statute\n[is] given precedence over a more general one.” Busic v. United\nStates, 446 U. S. 398, 406. Second, reading (a) to create a conflict\nwith (c) not only would make (c) superfluous, but would also create\nconflicts with so many other Rules of Evidence that the subsection\ncannot possibly be given its literal scope. Pp. 8–12.\n     (2) The legislative history strongly favors Corley’s reading. The\nGovernment points to nothing in this history supporting its contrary\nview. Pp. 13–15.\n     (3) The Government’s position would leave the Rule 5 present\nment requirement without teeth, for if there is no McNabb-Mallory\nthere is no apparent remedy for a presentment delay. The prompt\npresentment requirement is not just an administrative nicety. It\ndates back to the common law. Under Rule 5, presentment is the\npoint at which the judge must take several key steps to foreclose\nGovernment overreaching: e.g., informing the defendant of the\ncharges against him and giving the defendant a chance to consult\nwith counsel. Without McNabb-Mallory, federal agents would be free\nto question suspects for extended periods before bringing them out in\nthe open, even though “custodial police interrogation, by its very na\nture, isolates and pressures the individual,” Dickerson v. United\nStates, 530 U. S. 428, 435, inducing people to confess to crimes they\nnever committed. Pp. 15–16.\n   (b) There is no merit to the Government’s fallback claim that even\nif §3501 preserved a limited version of McNabb-Mallory, Congress cut\nit out by enacting Federal Rule of Evidence 402, which provides that\n“[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by\nthe Constitution of the United States, by Act of Congress, by these\nrules, or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court . . . .” The\nAdvisory Committee’s Notes expressly identified McNabb-Mallory as\na statutorily authorized rule that would survive Rule 402, and the\n4                    CORLEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n    Government has previously conceded before this Court that Rule 402\n    preserved McNabb-Mallory.

S. C. §3501 to discard, or merely to narrow, the rule in\nMcNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332 (1943), and Mal\nlory v. United States, 354 U. S. 449 (1957), under which an\narrested person’s confession is inadmissible if given after\nan unreasonable delay in bringing him before a judge. We\nhold that Congress meant to limit, not eliminate, McNabb-\nMallory.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   The common law obliged an arresting officer to bring his\nprisoner before a magistrate as soon as he reasonably\ncould. See County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S.\n44, 61–62 (1991) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). This “present\nment” requirement tended to prevent secret detention and\nserved to inform a suspect of the charges against him, and\nit was the law in nearly every American State and the\nNational Government. See id., at 60–61; McNabb, supra,\nat 342, and n. 7.\n   McNabb v. United States raised the question of how to\n2                CORLEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nenforce a number of federal statutes codifying the pre\nsentment rule. 318 U. S., at 342 (citing, among others, 18\nU. S. C. §595 (1940 ed.), which provided that “ ‘[i]t shall be\nthe duty of the marshal . . . who may arrest a person . . . to\ntake the defendant before the nearest . . . judicial officer\n. . . for a hearing’ ”). There, federal agents flouted the\nrequirement by interrogating several murder suspects for\ndays before bringing them before a magistrate, and then\nonly after they had given the confessions that convicted\nthem. 318 U. S., at 334–338, 344–345.\n    On the defendants’ motions to exclude the confessions\nfrom evidence, we saw no need to reach any constitutional\nissue. Instead we invoked the supervisory power to estab\nlish and maintain “civilized standards of procedure and\nevidence” in federal courts, id., at 340, which we exercised\nfor the sake of making good on the traditional obligation\nembodied in the federal presentment legislation. We saw\nboth the statutes and the traditional rule as aimed not\nonly at checking the likelihood of resort to the third degree\nbut meant generally to “avoid all the evil implications of\nsecret interrogation of persons accused of crime.” Id., at\n344. We acknowledged that “Congress ha[d] not explicitly\nforbidden the use of evidence . . . procured” in derogation\nof the presentment obligation, id., at 345, but we realized\nthat “permit[ting] such evidence to be made the basis of a\nconviction in the federal courts would stultify the policy\nwhich Congress ha[d] enacted into law,” ibid., and in the\nexercise of supervisory authority we held confessions\ninadmissible when obtained during unreasonable pre\nsentment delay.\n    Shortly after McNabb, the combined action of the Judi\ncial Conference of the United States and Congress pro\nduced Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5(a), which\npulled the several statutory presentment provisions to\ngether in one place. See Mallory, supra, at 452 (describing\nRule 5(a) as “a compendious restatement, without sub\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstantive change, of several prior specific federal statutory\nprovisions”). As first enacted, the rule told “[a]n officer\nmaking an arrest under a warrant issued upon a com\nplaint or any person making an arrest without a warrant\n[to] take the arrested person without unnecessary delay\nbefore the nearest available commissioner or before any\nother nearby officer empowered to commit persons\ncharged with offenses against the laws of the United\nStates.” Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 5(a) (1946). The rule re\nmains much the same today: “A person making an arrest\nwithin the United States must take the defendant without\nunnecessary delay before a magistrate judge . . . .” Fed.\nRule Crim. Proc. 5(a)(1)(A) (2007).\n   A case for applying McNabb and Rule 5(a) together soon\narose in Upshaw v. United States, 335 U. S. 410 (1948).\nDespite the Government’s confession of error, the D. C.\nCircuit had thought McNabb’s exclusionary rule applied\nonly to involuntary confessions obtained by coercion dur\ning the period of delay, 335 U. S., at 411–412, and so held\nthe defendant’s voluntary confession admissible into evi\ndence. This was error, and we reiterated the reasoning of\na few years earlier. “In the McNabb case we held that the\nplain purpose of the requirement that prisoners should\npromptly be taken before committing magistrates was to\ncheck resort by officers to ‘secret interrogation of persons\naccused of crime.’ ” Id., at 412 (quoting McNabb, supra, at\n344). Upshaw consequently emphasized that even volun\ntary confessions are inadmissible if given after an unrea\nsonable delay in presentment. 335 U. S., at 413.\n   We applied Rule 5(a) again in Mallory v. United States,\nholding a confession given seven hours after arrest inad\nmissible for “unnecessary delay” in presenting the suspect\nto a magistrate, where the police questioned the suspect\nfor hours “within the vicinity of numerous committing\nmagistrates.” 354 U. S., at 455. Again, we repeated the\nreasons for the rule and explained, as we had before and\n4                    CORLEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhave since, that delay for the purpose of interrogation is\nthe epitome of “unnecessary delay.” Id., at 455–456; see\nalso McLaughlin, 500 U. S., at 61 (SCALIA, J., dissenting)\n(“It was clear” at common law “that the only element\nbearing upon the reasonableness of delay was not such\ncircumstances as the pressing need to conduct further\ninvestigation, but the arresting officer’s ability, once the\nprisoner had been secured, to reach a magistrate”); Up\nshaw, supra, at 414. Thus, the rule known simply as\nMcNabb-Mallory “generally render[s] inadmissible confes\nsions made during periods of detention that violat[e] the\nprompt presentment requirement of Rule 5(a).” United\nStates v. Alvarez-Sanchez, 511 U. S. 350, 354 (1994).\n   There the law remained until 1968, when Congress\nenacted 18 U. S. C. §3501 in response to Miranda v. Ari\nzona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), and to the application of\nMcNabb-Mallory in some federal courts. Subsections (a)\nand (b) of §3501 were meant to eliminate Miranda.1 See\nDickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 435–437 (2000);\ninfra, at 13–14. Subsection (a) provides that “[i]n any\ncriminal prosecution brought by the United States . . . , a\nconfession . . . shall be admissible in evidence if it is volun\ntarily given,” while subsection (b) lists several considera\ntions for courts to address in assessing voluntariness.2\n——————\n   1 We rejected this attempt to overrule Miranda in Dickerson v. United\n\nStates, 530 U. S. 428 (2000).\n   2 In full, subsections (a) and (b) provide:\n\n   “(a) In any criminal prosecution brought by the United States or by\nthe District of Columbia, a confession, as defined in subsection (e)\nhereof, shall be admissible in evidence if it is voluntarily given. Before\nsuch confession is received in evidence, the trial judge shall, out of the\npresence of the jury, determine any issue as to voluntariness. If the\ntrial judge determines that the confession was voluntarily made it shall\nbe admitted in evidence and the trial judge shall permit the jury to\nhear relevant evidence on the issue of voluntariness and shall instruct\nthe jury to give such weight to the confession as the jury feels it de\nserves under all the circumstances.\n                    Cite as: 556 U.

UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  The issue in this case is whether Congress intended\n§3501(a) to sweep McNabb-Mallory’s exclusionary rule\naside entirely, or merely meant §3501(c) to provide immu\nnization to voluntary confessions given within six hours of\na suspect’s arrest.\n                              B\n  Petitioner Johnnie Corley was suspected of robbing a\nbank in Norristown, Pennsylvania. After federal agents\nlearned that Corley was subject to arrest on an unrelated\nlocal matter, some federal and state officers went together\nto execute the state warrant on September 17, 2003, and\nfound him just as he was pulling out of a driveway in his\ncar. Corley nearly ran over one officer, then jumped out of\nthe car, pushed the officer down, and ran. The agents\ngave chase and caught and arrested him for assaulting a\nfederal officer. The arrest occurred about 8 a.m. 500 F. 3d\n210, 212 (CA3 2007).\n  FBI agents first kept Corley at a local police station\nwhile they questioned residents near the place he was\ncaptured. Around 11:45 a.m. they took him to a Philadel\nphia hospital to treat a minor cut on his hand that he got\nduring the chase. At 3:30 p.m. the agents took him from\nthe hospital to the Philadelphia FBI office and told him\nthat he was a suspect in the Norristown bank robbery.\nThough the office was in the same building as the cham\nbers of the nearest magistrate judges, the agents did not\nbring Corley before a magistrate, but questioned him\ninstead, in hopes of getting a confession. App. 68–69, 83,\n138–139.\n——————\ndetention: Provided, That the time limitation contained in this subsec\ntion shall not apply in any case in which the delay in bringing such\nperson before such magistrate judge or other officer beyond such six\nhour period is found by the trial judge to be reasonable considering the\nmeans of transportation and the distance to be traveled to the nearest\navailable such magistrate judge or other officer.”\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The agents’ repeated arguments sold Corley on the\nbenefits of cooperating with the Government, and he\nsigned a form waiving his Miranda rights. At 5:27 p.m.,\nsome 9.5 hours after his arrest, Corley began an oral\nconfession that he robbed the bank, id., at 62, and spoke\non in this vein until about 6:30, when agents asked him to\nput it all in writing. Corley said he was tired and wanted\na break, so the agents decided to hold him overnight and\ntake the written statement the next morning. At 10:30\na.m. on September 18 they began the interrogation again,\nwhich ended when Corley signed a written confession. He\nwas finally presented to a magistrate at 1:30 p.m. that\nday, 29.5 hours after his arrest. 500 F. 3d, at 212.\n   Corley was charged with armed bank robbery, 18\nU. S. C. §2113(a), (d), conspiracy to commit armed bank\nrobbery, §371, and using a firearm in furtherance of a\ncrime of violence, §924(c). When he moved to suppress his\noral and written confessions under Rule 5(a) and McNabb-\nMallory, the District Court denied the motion, with the\nexplanation that the time Corley was receiving medical\ntreatment should be excluded from the delay, and that the\noral confession was thus given within the six-hour window\nof §3501(c).

The District Court also held Corley’s written\nconfession admissible, reasoning that “a break from inter\nrogation requested by an arrestee who has already begun\nhis confession does not constitute unreasonable delay\nunder Rule 5(a).” Id., at 97–98. Corley was convicted of\nconspiracy and armed robbery but acquitted of using a\nfirearm during a crime of violence. 500 F. 3d, at 212–213.\n   A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Third\nCircuit affirmed the conviction, though its rationale for\nrejecting Corley’s Rule 5(a) argument was different from\nthe District Court’s. The panel majority considered itself\nbound by Circuit precedent to the effect that §3501 en\ntirely abrogated the McNabb-Mallory rule and replaced it\n8                   CORLEY v.

Gereau, 502\nF. 2d 914 (CA3 1974)). As the majority saw it, if a district\ncourt found a confession voluntary after considering the\npoints listed in §3501(b), it would be admissible, regard\nless of whether delay in presentment was unnecessary or\nunreasonable. 500 F. 3d, at 217.

By\nproviding that a confession “shall not be inadmissible\nsolely because of delay” in presentment if “made voluntar\nily and . . . within six hours [of arrest],” subsection (c)\nleaves McNabb-Mallory inapplicable to confessions given\nwithin the six hours, but when a confession comes even\nlater, the exclusionary rule applies and courts have to see\nwhether the delay was unnecessary or unreasonable.\n   Corley has the better argument.\n                                 A\n  The fundamental problem with the Government’s read\ning of §3501 is that it renders §3501(c) nonsensical and\nsuperfluous. Subsection (c) provides that a confession\n“shall not be inadmissible solely because of delay” in pre\nsentment if the confession is “made voluntarily and . . .\nwithin six hours [of arrest].” If (a) really meant that any\nvoluntary confession was admissible, as the Government\ncontends, then (c) would add nothing; if a confession was\n“made voluntarily” it would be admissible, period, and\nnever “inadmissible solely because of delay,” no matter\nwhether the delay went beyond six hours. There is no way\nout of this, and the Government concedes it. Tr. of Oral\nArg. 33 (“Congress never needed (c); (c) in the [G]overn\nment’s view was always superfluous”).\n  The Government’s reading is thus at odds with one of\nthe most basic interpretive canons, that “ ‘[a] statute\nshould be construed so that effect is given to all its provi\nsions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,\nvoid or insignificant . . . .’ ” Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88,\n101 (2004) (quoting 2A N. Singer, Statutes and Statutory\nConstruction §46.06, pp.181–186 (rev. 6th ed. 2000)).5 The\n——————\n  5 The dissent says that the antisuperfluousness canon has no place\n\nhere because “there is nothing ambiguous about the language of\n§3501(a).” Post, at 2 (opinion of ALITO, J.). But this response violates\n10                   CORLEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nGovernment attempts to mitigate its problem by rewriting\n(c) into a clarifying, if not strictly necessary, provision:\nalthough Congress wrote that a confession “shall not be\ninadmissible solely because of delay” if the confession is\n“made voluntarily and . . . within six hours [of arrest],” the\nGovernment tells us that Congress actually meant that a\nconfession “shall not be [involuntary] solely because of\ndelay” if the confession is “[otherwise voluntary] and . . .\n[made] within six hours [of arrest].” Thus rewritten, (c)\nwould coexist peacefully (albeit inelegantly) with (a), with\n(c) simply specifying a bright-line rule applying (a) to\ncases of delay: it would tell courts that delay alone does\nnot make a confession involuntary unless the delay ex\nceeds six hours.\n    To this proposal, “ ‘[t]he short answer is that Congress\ndid not write the statute that way.’ ” Russello v. United\nStates, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (quoting United States v.\nNaftalin, 441 U. S. 768, 773 (1979)). The Government\nmay say that we can sensibly read “inadmissible” as “in\nvoluntary” because the words are “virtually synonymous\n. . . in this statutory context,” Brief for United States 23,\nbut this is simply not so. To begin with, Congress used\n\n——————\n“the cardinal rule that a statute is to be read as a whole,” King v. St.\nVincent’s Hospital, 502 U. S. 215, 221 (1991). Subsection 3501(a) seems\nclear only if one ignores the absurd results of a literal reading, infra, at\n11–12, and only until one reads §3501(c) and recognizes that if (a)\nmeans what it literally says, (c) serves no purpose. Even the dissent\nconcedes that when (a) and (c) are read together, “[t]here is simply no\nperfect solution to the problem before us.” Post, at 4. Thus, the dis\nsent’s point that subsection (a) seems clear when read in isolation\nproves nothing, for “[t]he meaning—or ambiguity—of certain words or\nphrases may only become evident when placed in context.” FDA v.\nBrown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 132 (2000). When\nsubsection (a) is read in context, there is no avoiding the question,\n“What could Congress have been getting at with both (a) and (c)?” The\nbetter answer is that Congress meant to do just what Members explic\nitly said in the legislative record. See infra, at 13–15.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nboth terms in (c) itself, and “[w]e would not presume to\nascribe this difference to a simple mistake in draftsman\nship.” Russello, supra, at 23. And there is, in fact, every\nreason to believe that Congress used the distinct terms\nvery deliberately. Subsection (c) specifies two criteria that\nmust be satisfied to prevent a confession from being “in\nadmissible solely because of delay”: the confession must be\n“[1] made voluntarily and . . . [2] within six hours [of\narrest].” Because voluntariness is thus only one of several\ncriteria for admissibility under (c), “involuntary” and\n“inadmissible” plainly cannot be synonymous. What is\nmore, the Government’s argument ignores the fact that\nunder the McNabb-Mallory rule, which we presume Con\ngress was aware of, Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441\nU. S. 677, 699 (1979), “inadmissible” and “involuntary”\nmean different things. As we explained before and as the\nGovernment concedes, McNabb-Mallory makes even vol\nuntary confessions inadmissible if given after an unrea\nsonable delay in presentment, Upshaw, 335 U. S., at 413;\nTr. of Oral Arg. 33 (“[I]t was well understood that\nMcNabb-Mallory . . . excluded totally voluntary confes\nsions”). So we cannot accept the Government’s attempt to\nconfuse the critically distinct terms “involuntary” and\n“inadmissible” by rewriting (c) into a bright-line rule doing\nnothing more than applying (a).\n  Corley’s position, in contrast, gives effect to both (c) and\n(a), by reading (a) as overruling Miranda and (c) as quali\nfying McNabb-Mallory. The Government answers, how\never, that accepting Corley’s argument would result in a\ndifferent problem: it would create a conflict between (c)\nand (a), since (a) provides that all voluntary confessions\nare admissible while Corley’s reading of (c) leaves some\nvoluntary confessions inadmissible. But the Government’s\ncounterargument falls short for two reasons. First, even if\n(a) is read to be at odds with (c), the conflict is resolved by\nrecognizing that (a) is a broad directive while (c) aims only\n12                  CORLEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nat McNabb-Mallory, and “a more specific statute will be\ngiven precedence over a more general one . . . .” Busic v.\nUnited States, 446 U. S. 398, 406 (1980). Second, and\nmore fundamentally, (a) cannot prudently be read to\ncreate a conflict with (c), not only because it would make\n(c) superfluous, as explained, but simply because reading\n(a) that way would create conflicts with so many other\nrules that the subsection cannot possibly be given its\nliteral scope. Subsection (a) provides that “[i]n any crimi\nnal prosecution brought by the United States . . . , a con\nfession . . . shall be admissible in evidence if it is voluntar\nily given,” and §3501(e) defines “confession” as “any\nconfession of guilt of any criminal offense or any self\nincriminating statement made or given orally or in writ\ning.” Thus, if the Government seriously urged a literal\nreading, (a) would mean that “in any criminal prosecution\nbrought by the United States . . . , [‘any self-incriminating\nstatement’ with respect to ‘any criminal offense’] . . . shall\nbe admissible in evidence if it is voluntarily given.” Thus\nwould many a Rule of Evidence be overridden in case after\ncase: a defendant’s self-incriminating statement to his\nlawyer would be admissible despite his insistence on\nattorney-client privilege; a fourth-hand hearsay statement\nthe defendant allegedly made would come in; and a defen\ndant’s confession to an entirely unrelated crime committed\nyears earlier would be admissible without more. These\nare some of the absurdities of literalism that show that\nCongress could not have been writing in a literalistic\nframe of mind.6\n——————\n   6 The dissent seeks to avoid these absurd results by claiming that\n\n“§3501(a) does not supersede ordinary evidence Rules,” post, at 10, but\nits only argument for this conclusion is that “there is no reason to\nsuppose that Congress meant any such thing,” post, at 9. The dissent is\ncertainly correct that there is no reason to suppose that Congress\nmeant any such thing; that is what our reductio ad absurdum shows.\nBut that leaves the dissent saying, “§3501(a) must be read literally”\n                      Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                               B\n  As it turns out, there is more than reductio ad absur\ndum and the antisuperfluousness canon to confirm that\nsubsection (a) leaves McNabb-Mallory alone, for that is\nwhat legislative history says. In fact, the Government\nconcedes that subsections (a) and (b) were aimed at\nMiranda, while subsection (c) was meant to modify the\npresentment exclusionary rule. Tr. of Oral Arg. 38 (“I will\nconcede to you . . . that section (a) was considered to over\nrule Miranda, and subsection (c) was addressed to\nMcNabb-Mallory”). The concession is unavoidable. The\nSenate, where §3501 originated, split the provision into\ntwo parts: Division 1 contained subsections (a) and (b),\nand Division 2 contained subsection (c). 114 Cong. Rec.\n14171 (1968). In the debate on the Senate floor immedi\nately before voting on these proposals, several Senators,\nincluding the section’s prime sponsor, Senator McClellan,\nexplained that Division 1 “has to do with the Miranda\ndecision,” while Division 2 related to Mallory. 114 Cong.\nRec. 14171–14172. This distinct intent was confirmed by\nthe separate Senate votes adopting the two measures,\nDivision 1 by 55 to 29 and Division 2 by 58 to 26, id., at\n14171–14172, 14174–14175; if (a) did abrogate McNabb-\nMallory, as the Government claims, then voting for Divi\nsion 2 would have been entirely superfluous, for the Divi\nsion 1 vote would already have done the job. That aside, a\nsponsor’s statement to the full Senate carries considerable\nweight, and Senator McClellan’s explanation that Division\n1 was specifically addressed to Miranda confirms that (a)\nand (b) were never meant to reach far enough to abrogate\n——————\n(rendering §3501(c) superfluous), “but not too literally” (so that it would\noverride other Rules of Evidence). The dissent cannot have it both\nways. If it means to profess literalism it will have to take the absurdity\nthat literalism brings with it; “credo quia absurdum” (as Tertullian\nmay have said). If it will not take the absurd, then its literalism is no\nalternative to our reading of the statute.\n14                  CORLEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nother background evidentiary rules including McNabb-\nMallory.\n   Further legislative history not only drives that point\nhome, but conclusively shows an intent that subsection (c)\nlimit McNabb-Mallory, not replace it. In its original draft,\nsubsection (c) would indeed have done away with McNabb-\nMallory completely, for the bill as first written would have\nprovided that “[i]n any criminal prosecution by the United\nStates . . . , a confession made or given by a person who is\na defendant therein . . . shall not be inadmissible solely\nbecause of delay in bringing such person before a [magis\ntrate] if such confession is . . . made voluntarily.” S. 917,\n90th Cong., 2d Sess., 44–45 (1968) (as reported by Senate\nCommittee on the Judiciary); 114 Cong. Rec. 14172. The\nprovision so conceived was resisted, however, by a number\nof Senators worried about allowing indefinite presentment\ndelays. See, e.g., id., at 11740, 13990 (Sen. Tydings) (the\nprovision would “permit Federal criminal suspects to be\nquestioned indefinitely before they are presented to a\ncommitting magistrate”); id., at 12290 (Sen. Fong) (the\nprovision “would open the doors to such practices as hold\ning suspects incommunicado for an indefinite period”).\nAfter Senator Tydings proposed striking (c) from the bill\naltogether, id., at 13651 (Amendment No. 788), Senator\nScott introduced the compromise of qualifying (c) with the\nwords: “ ‘and if such confession was made or given by such\nperson within six hours following his arrest or other de\ntention.’ ” Id., at 14184–14185 (Amendment No. 805).7\nThe amendment was intended to confine McNabb-Mallory\nto excluding only confessions given after more than six\nhours of delay, see 114 Cong.

C. Crime Act),\n§301(b), 81 Stat. 735–736, see, e.g., 114 Cong. Rec. 14184\n(remarks of Sen. Scott) (“My amendment is an attempt to\nconform, as nearly as practicable, to Title III of [the D. C.\nCrime Act]”). By the terms of that Act, “[a]ny statement,\nadmission, or confession made by an arrested person\nwithin three hours immediately following his arrest shall\nnot be excluded from evidence in the courts of the District\nof Columbia solely because of delay in presentment.”\n§301(b), 81 Stat. 735–736. Given the clear intent that\nTitle III modify but not eliminate McNabb-Mallory in the\nDistrict of Columbia, see, e.g., S. Rep. No. 912, 90th Cong.,\n1st Sess., 17–18 (1967), using it as a model plainly shows\nhow Congress meant as much but no more in §3501(c).\n  In sum, the legislative history strongly favors Corley’s\nreading. The Government points to nothing in this history\nsupporting its view that (c) created a bright-line rule for\napplying (a) in cases with a presentment issue.\n                              C\n   It also counts heavily against the position of the United\nStates that it would leave the Rule 5 presentment re\nquirement without any teeth, for as the Government again\nis forced to admit, if there is no McNabb-Mallory there is\nno apparent remedy for delay in presentment. Tr. of Oral\nArg. 25. One might not care if the prompt presentment\nrequirement were just some administrative nicety, but in\nfact the rule has always mattered in very practical ways\nand still does. As we said, it stretches back to the common\nlaw, when it was “one of the most important” protections\n“against unlawful arrest.” McLaughlin, 500 U. S., at 60–\n16                CORLEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n61 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Today presentment is the\npoint at which the judge is required to take several key\nsteps to foreclose Government overreaching: informing the\ndefendant of the charges against him, his right to remain\nsilent, his right to counsel, the availability of bail, and any\nright to a preliminary hearing; giving the defendant a\nchance to consult with counsel; and deciding between\ndetention or release. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 5(d); see also\nRule 58(b)(2).\n   In a world without McNabb-Mallory, federal agents\nwould be free to question suspects for extended periods\nbefore bringing them out in the open, and we have always\nknown what custodial secrecy leads to. See McNabb, 318\nU. S. 332. No one with any smattering of the history of\n20th-century dictatorships needs a lecture on the subject,\nand we understand the need even within our own system\nto take care against going too far. “[C]ustodial police\ninterrogation, by its very nature, isolates and pressures\nthe individual,” Dickerson, 530 U. S., at 435, and there is\nmounting empirical evidence that these pressures can\ninduce a frighteningly high percentage of people to confess\nto crimes they never committed, see, e.g., Drizin & Leo,\nThe Problem of False Confessions in the Post-DNA World,\n82 N. C. L. Rev. 891, 906–907 (2004).\n   Justice Frankfurter’s point in McNabb is as fresh as\never: “The history of liberty has largely been the history of\nobservance of procedural safeguards.” 318 U. S., at 347.\nMcNabb-Mallory is one of them, and neither the text nor\nthe history of §3501 makes out a case that Congress\nmeant to do away with it.\n                           III\n  The Government’s fallback claim is that even if §3501\npreserved a limited version of McNabb-Mallory, Congress\ncut out the rule altogether by enacting Federal Rule of\nEvidence 402 in 1975.

So far as it might matter here, that rule pro\nvides that “[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible, except as\notherwise provided by the Constitution of the United\nStates, by Act of Congress, by these rules, or by other\nrules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statu\ntory authority.” The Government says that McNabb-\nMallory excludes relevant evidence in a way not “other\nwise provided by” any of these four authorities, and so has\nfallen to the scythe.\n   The Government never raised this argument in the\nThird Circuit or the District Court, which would justify\nrefusing to consider it here, but in any event it has no\nmerit. The Advisory Committee’s Notes on Rule 402,\nwhich were before Congress when it enacted the Rules of\nEvidence and which we have relied on in the past to inter\npret the rules, Tome v. United States, 513 U. S. 150, 160\n(1995) (plurality opinion), expressly identified McNabb-\nMallory as a statutorily authorized rule that would sur\nvive Rule 402: “The Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure\nin some instances require the exclusion of relevant evi\ndence. For example, . . . the effective enforcement of . . .\nRule 5(a) . . . is held to require the exclusion of statements\nelicited during detention in violation thereof.” 28 U. S. C.\nApp., pp. 325–326 (citing Mallory, 354 U. S. 449, and 18\nU. S.

Indeed, the Gov\nernment has previously conceded before this Court that\nRule 402 preserved McNabb-Mallory. Brief for United\nStates in United States v. Payner, O.

Under the rule as revised by §3501(c), a\ndistrict court with a suppression claim must find whether\nthe defendant confessed within six hours of arrest (unless\na longer delay was “reasonable considering the means of\ntransportation and the distance to be traveled to the near\nest available [magistrate]”). If the confession came within\nthat period, it is admissible, subject to the other Rules of\nEvidence, so long as it was “made voluntarily and . . . the\nweight to be given [it] is left to the jury.” Ibid. If the\nconfession occurred before presentment and beyond six\nhours, however, the court must decide whether delaying\nthat long was unreasonable or unnecessary under the\nMcNabb-Mallory cases, and if it was, the confession is to\nbe suppressed.\n   In this case, the Third Circuit did not apply this rule\nand in consequence never conclusively determined\nwhether Corley’s oral confession “should be treated as\nhaving been made within six hours of arrest,” as the Dis\ntrict Court held. 500 F. 3d, at 220, n. 7. Nor did the Cir\ncuit consider the justifiability of any delay beyond six\nhours if the oral confession should be treated as given\noutside the six-hour window; and it did not make this\nenquiry with respect to Corley’s written confession.

After petitioner was arrested by federal agents, he\ntwice waived his Miranda1 rights and voluntarily con\nfessed, first orally and later in writing, that he had par\nticipated in an armed bank robbery. He was then taken\nbefore a Magistrate Judge for an initial appearance. The\nquestion that we must decide is whether this voluntary\nconfession may be suppressed on the ground that there\nwas unnecessary delay in bringing petitioner before the\nMagistrate Judge. Unless the unambiguous language of\n§3501(a) is ignored, petitioner’s confession may not be\nsuppressed.\n                               I\n  Section 3501(a) states: “In any criminal prosecution\nbrought by the United States . . ., a confession . . . shall be\nadmissible in evidence if it is voluntarily given.”\n  Applying “settled principles of statutory construction,”\n“we must first determine whether the statutory text is\nplain and unambiguous,” and “[i]f it is, we must apply the\n\n——————\n 1 See   Miranda v.

S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 7). Here, there is nothing\nambiguous about the language of §3501(a), and the Court\ndoes not claim otherwise. Although we normally presume\nthat Congress “means in a statute what it says there,”\nConnecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253–254\n(1992), the Court today concludes that §3501(a) does not\nmean what it says and that a voluntary confession may be\nsuppressed under the McNabb-Mallory rule.2 This super\nvisory rule, which requires the suppression of a confession\nwhere there was unnecessary delay in bringing a federal\ncriminal defendant before a judicial officer after arrest,\nwas announced long before 18 U. S. C. §3501(a) was\nadopted. According to the Court, this rule survived the\nenactment of §3501(a) because Congress adopted that\nprovision for the sole purpose of abrogating Miranda and\napparently never realized that the provision’s broad lan\nguage would also do away with the McNabb-Mallory rule.\nI disagree with the Court’s analysis and therefore respect\nfully dissent.\n                             II \n\n                             A\n\n  The Court’s first and most substantial argument in\nvokes “the antisuperfluousness canon,” ante, at 12, under\nwhich a statute should be read, if possible, so that all of its\nprovisions are given effect and none is superfluous. Ante,\nat 9–12. Section 3501(c) provides that a voluntary confes\nsion “shall not be inadmissible solely because of the delay”\nin bringing the defendant before a judicial officer if the\ndefendant is brought before a judicial officer within six\nhours of arrest.

But we\nhave observed before that such ‘interpretative canon[s are]\nnot a license for the judiciary to rewrite language enacted\nby the legislature.’ ” United States v. Monsanto, 491 U. S.\n600, 611 (1989) (quoting United States v. Albertini, 472\nU. S. 675, 680 (1985)). Like other canons, the antisuper\nfluousness canon is merely an interpretive aid, not an\nabsolute rule. See Connecticut Nat. Bank, 503 U. S., at\n254 (“When the words of a statute are unambiguous, then,\nthis first canon is also the last: ‘judicial inquiry is com\nplete’ ”). There are times when Congress enacts provisions\nthat are superfluous, and this may be such an instance.\nCf. id., at 253 (noting that “[r]edundancies across statutes\nare not unusual events in drafting”); Gutierrez de Martinez\nv. Lamagno, 515 U. S. 417, 445–446 (1995) (SOUTER, J.,\ndissenting) (noting that, although Congress “indulged in a\nlittle redundancy,” the “inelegance may be forgiven” be\ncause “Congress could sensibly have seen some practical\nvalue in the redundancy”).\n   Moreover, any superfluity created by giving subsection\n(a) its plain meaning may be minimized by interpreting\nsubsection (c) to apply to confessions that are otherwise\nvoluntary.     The Government contends that §3501(c),\nthough inartfully drafted, is not superfluous because what\nthe provision means is that a confession is admissible if it\nis given within six hours of arrest and it is otherwise vol\nuntary—that is, if there is no basis other than prepre\nsentment delay for concluding that the confession was\ncoerced. Read in this way, §3501(c) is not superfluous.\n   The Court rejects this argument on the ground that\n4                 CORLEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n“ ‘Congress did not write the statute that way,’ ” ante, at\n10, and thus, in order to adhere to a narrow reading of\n§3501(c), the Court entirely disregards the unambiguous\nlanguage of §3501(a). Although §3501(a) says that a\nconfession is admissible if it is “voluntarily given,” the\nCourt reads that provision to mean that a voluntary con\nfession may not be excluded on the ground that the confes\nsion was obtained in violation of Miranda. To this read\ning, the short answer is that Congress really did not write\nthe statute that way.\n   As is true with most of the statutory interpretation\nquestions that come before this Court, the question in this\ncase is not like a jigsaw puzzle. There is simply no perfect\nsolution to the problem before us.\n   Instead, we must choose between two imperfect solu\ntions. The first (the one adopted by the Court) entirely\ndisregards the clear and simple language of §3501(a), rests\non the proposition that Congress did not understand the\nplain import of the language it used in subsection (a), but\nadheres to a strictly literal interpretation of §3501(c). The\nsecond option respects the clear language of subsection (a),\nbut either accepts some statutory surplusage or interprets\n§3501(c)’s reference to a voluntary confession to mean an\notherwise voluntary confession. To my mind, the latter\nchoice is far preferable.\n                              B\n  In addition to the antisuperfluousness canon, the Court\nrelies on the canon that favors a specific statutory provi\nsion over a conflicting provision cast in more general\nterms, ante, at 11, but that canon is inapplicable here. For\none thing, §3501(a) is quite specific; it specifically provides\nthat if a confession is voluntary, it is admissible. More\nimportant, there is no other provision, specific or general,\nthat conflicts with §3501(a). See National Cable & Tele\ncommunications Assn., Inc. v. Gulf Power Co., 534 U. S.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           5\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n327, 335–336 (2002) (“It is true that specific statutory\nlanguage should control more general language when there\nis a conflict between the two. Here, however, there is no\nconflict” (emphasis added)). Subsection (c) is not conflict\ning because it does not authorize the suppression of any\nvoluntary confession. What the Court identifies is not a\nconflict between two statutory provisions but a conflict\nbetween the express language of one provision (§3501(a))\nand the “negative implication” that the Court draws from\nanother (§3501(c)). United States v. Alvarez-Sanchez, 511\nU. S. 350, 355 (1994). Because §3501(c) precludes the\nsuppression of a voluntary confession based solely on a\ndelay of less than six hours, the Court infers that Con\ngress must have contemplated that a voluntary confession\ncould be suppressed based solely on a delay of more than\nsix hours. The Court cites no authority for a canon of\ninterpretation that favors a “negative implication” of this\nsort over clear and express statutory language.\n                               C\n   The Court contends that a literal interpretation of\n§3501(a) would leave the prompt presentment require\nment set out in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5(a)(1)\n“without any teeth, for . . . if there is no McNabb-Mallory\nthere is no apparent remedy for delay in presentment.”\nAnte, at 15. There is nothing strange, however, about a\nprompt presentment requirement that is not enforced by a\nrule excluding voluntary confessions made during a period\nof excessive prepresentment delay. As the Court notes,\n“[t]he common law obliged an arresting officer to bring his\nprisoner before a magistrate as soon as he reasonably\ncould,” ante, at 1, but the McNabb-Mallory supervisory\nrule was not adopted until the middle of the 20th century.\nTo this day, while the States are required by the Fourth\nAmendment to bring an arrestee promptly before a judi\ncial officer, see, e.g., County of Riverside v. McLaughlin,\n6                CORLEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n500 U. S. 44, 56 (1991), we have never held that this con\nstitutional requirement is backed by an automatic exclu\nsionary sanction, see, e.g., Hudson v. Michigan, 547 U. S.\n586, 592 (2006). And although the prompt presentment\nrequirement serves interests in addition to the prevention\nof coerced confessions, the McNabb-Mallory rule provides\nno sanction for excessive prepresentment delay in those\ninstances in which no confession is sought or obtained.\n   Moreover, the need for the McNabb-Mallory exclusion\nary rule is no longer clear. That rule, which was adopted\nlong before Miranda, originally served a purpose that is\nnow addressed by the giving of Miranda warnings upon\narrest. As Miranda recognized, McNabb and Mallory\nwere “responsive to the same considerations of Fifth\nAmendment policy” that the Miranda rule was devised to\naddress. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 463 (1966).\n   In the pre-Miranda era, the requirement of prompt\npresentment ensured that persons taken into custody\nwould, within a relatively short period, receive advice\nabout their rights. See McNabb v. United States, 318\nU. S. 332, 344 (1943). Now, however, Miranda ensures\nthat arrestees receive such advice at an even earlier point,\nwithin moments of being taken into custody. Of course,\narrestees, after receiving Miranda warnings, may waive\ntheir rights and submit to questioning by law enforcement\nofficers, see, e.g., Davis v. United States, 512 U. S. 452,\n458 (1994), and arrestees may likewise waive the prompt\npresentment requirement, see, e.g., New York v. Hill, 528\nU. S. 110, 114 (2000) (“We have . . . ‘in the context of a\nbroad array of constitutional and statutory provisions,’\narticulated a general rule that presumes the availability of\nwaiver, . . . and we have recognized that ‘the most basic\nrights of criminal defendants are . . . subject to waiver’ ”).\nIt seems unlikely that many arrestees who are willing to\nwaive the right to remain silent and the right to the assis\ntance of counsel during questioning would balk at waiving\n                   Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                 7\n\n                        ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthe right to prompt presentment. More than a few courts\nof appeals have gone as far as to hold that a waiver of\nMiranda rights also constitutes a waiver under McNabb-\nMallory. See, e.g., United States v. Salamanca, 990 F. 2d\n629, 634 (CADC), cert. denied, 510 U. S. 928 (1993);\nUnited States v. Barlow, 693 F. 2d 954, 959 (CA6 1982),\ncert. denied, 461 U. S. 945 (1983); United States v. Indian\nBoy X, 565 F. 2d 585, 591 (CA9 1977), cert. denied, 439\nU. S. 841 (1978); United States v. Duvall, 537 F. 2d 15, 23–\n24, n. 9 (CA2), cert. denied, 426 U. S. 950 (1976); United\nStates v. Howell, 470 F. 2d 1064, 1067, n. 1 (CA9 1972);\nPettyjohn v. United States, 419 F. 2d 651, 656 (CADC\n1969), cert. denied, 397 U. S. 1058 (1970); O’Neal v. United\nStates, 411 F. 2d 131, 136–137 (CA5), cert. denied, 396\nU. S. 827 (1969). Whether or not those decisions are\ncorrect, it is certainly not clear that the McNabb-Mallory\nrule adds much protection beyond that provided by\nMiranda.\n                             D\n  The Court contends that the legislative history of §3501\nsupports its interpretation, but the legislative history\nproves nothing that is not evident from the terms of the\nstatute. With respect to §3501(a), the legislative history\ncertainly shows that the provision’s chief backers meant to\ndo away with Miranda,3 but the Court cites no evidence\nthat this was all that §3501(a) was intended to accom\nplish. To the contrary, the Senate Report clearly says that\n§3501(a) was meant to reinstate the traditional rule that a\n\n——————\n  3 At argument, the Government conceded “that section (a) was con\n\nsidered to overrule Miranda and subsection (c) was addressed to\nMcNabb-Mallory.” See Tr. of Oral Arg. 38. It is apparent that the\nattorney for the Government chose his words carefully and did not\nconcede, as the Court seems to suggest, that subsection (a) was in\ntended to do no more than to overrule Miranda or that subsection (c)\nwas the only part of §3501 that affected the McNabb-Mallory rule.\n8                CORLEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nconfession should be excluded only if involuntary, see\nS. Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 38 (1968) (Senate\nReport), a step that obviously has consequences beyond\nthe elimination of Miranda. And the Senate Report re\npeatedly cited Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478 (1964), as\nan example of an unsound limitation on the admission of\nvoluntary confessions, see Senate Report 41–51, thus\nillustrating that §3501(a) was not understood as simply an\nanti-Miranda provision. Whether a majority of the Mem\nbers of the House and Senate had the McNabb-Mallory\nrule specifically in mind when they voted for §3501(a) is\nimmaterial. Statutory provisions may often have a reach\nthat is broader than the specific targets that the lawmak\ners might have had in mind at the time of enactment.\n   The legislative history relating to §3501(c) suggests\nnothing more than that some Members of Congress may\nmistakenly have thought that the version of §3501 that\nwas finally adopted would not displace the McNabb-\nMallory rule. As the Court relates, the version of §3501(c)\nthat emerged from the Senate Judiciary Committee would\nhave completely eliminated that rule. See ante, at 12–13.\nSome Senators opposed this, and the version of this provi\nsion that was eventually passed simply trimmed the rule.\nIt is possible to identify a few Senators who spoke out in\nopposition to the earlier version of subsection (c) and then\nvoted in favor of the version that eventually passed, and it\nis fair to infer that these Senators likely thought that the\namendment of subsection (c) had saved the rule. See 114\nCong. Rec. 14172–14175, 14798 (1968). But there is no\nevidence that a majority of the House and Senate shared\nthat view, and any Member who took a few moments to\nread subsections (a) and (c) must readily have understood\nthat subsection (a) would wipe away all non-constitution\nally based rules barring the admission of voluntary confes\nsions, not just Miranda, and that subsection (c) did not\nauthorize the suppression of any voluntary confessions.\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   9\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nThe Court unjustifiably attributes to a majority of the\nHouse and Senate a mistake that, the legislative history\nsuggests, may have been made by only a few.\n                                E\n  Finally, the Court argues that under a literal reading of\n§3501(a), “many a rule of evidence [would] be overridden\nin case after case.” Ante, at 12. In order to avoid this\nabsurd result, the Court says, it is necessary to read\n§3501(a) as merely abrogating Miranda and not\nthe McNabb-Mallory rule. There is no merit to this\nargument.4\n  The language that Congress used in §3501(a)—a confes\nsion is “admissible” if “voluntarily given”—is virtually a\nverbatim quotation of the language used by this Court in\ndescribing the traditional rule regarding the admission of\nconfessions. See, e.g., Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S.\n503, 513 (1963) (“ ‘ In short, the true test of admissibility is\nthat the confession is made freely, voluntarily and without\ncompulsion or inducement of any sort.’ ” (quoting Wilson v.\nUnited States, 162 U. S. 613, 623 (1896))); Lyons v. Okla\nhoma, 322 U. S. 596, 602 (1944); Ziang Sung Wan v.\nUnited States, 266 U. S. 1, 15 (1924); Bram v. United\nStates, 168 U. S. 532, 545 (1897). In making these state\nments, this Court certainly did not mean to suggest that a\nvoluntary confession must be admitted in those instances\nin which a standard rule of evidence would preclude ad\nmission, and there is no reason to suppose that Congress\nmeant any such thing either. In any event, the Federal\n\n——————\n   4 Contrary to the Court’s suggestion, cases in which one of the stan\n\ndard Rules of Evidence might block the admission of a voluntary\nconfession would seem quite rare, and the Court cites no real-world\nexamples. The Court thus justifies its reading of §3501, which totally\ndisregards the clear language of subsection (a), based on a few essen\ntially fanciful hypothetical cases that, in any event, have been covered\nsince 1975 by the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n10               CORLEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nRules of Evidence now make it clear that §3501(a) does\nnot supersede ordinary evidence Rules, including Rules\nregarding privilege (Rule 501), hearsay (Rule 802), and\nrestrictions on the use of character evidence (Rule 404).\nThus, it is not necessary to disregard the plain language of\n§3501(a), as the Court does, in order to avoid the sort of\nabsurd results to which the Court refers.\n  For all these reasons, I would affirm the decision of the\nCourt of Appeals, and I therefore respectfully dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 145888, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2009/04/06/Corley_v._United_States.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2008                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Alvarez-Sanchez, 511 U. S. 350, 354. Rule 5(a), in turn, pro\n vides that a “person making an arrest . . . must take the defendant\n without unnecessary delay before a magistrate judge . . . .” Congress\n enacted 18 U. S. C. §3501 in response to Miranda v. Arizona, 384\n U. S. 436, and some applications of the McNabb-Mallory rule. In an\n attempt to eliminate Miranda, §3501(a) provides that “a confession\n . . . shall be admissible in evidence if it is voluntarily given,” and\n §3501(b) lists several considerations for courts to address in assess\n ing voluntariness. Subsection (c), which focuses on McNabb-Mallory,\n provides that “a confession made . . . by . . . a defendant . . . , while\n . . . under arrest . . . , shall not be inadmissible solely because of delay\n in bringing such person before a magistrate judge . . . if such confes\n sion is found by the trial judge to have been made voluntarily and . . .\n within six hours [of arrest]”; it extends that time limit when further\n delay is “reasonable considering the means of transportation and the\n distance to . . . the nearest available [magistrate].”\n     Petitioner Corley was arrested for assaulting a federal officer at\n about 8 a.m. Around 11:45 FBI agents took him to a Philadelphia\n hospital to treat a minor injury. At 3:30 p.m. he was taken from the\n hospital to the local FBI office and told that he was a suspect in a\n bank robbery. Though the office was in the same building as the\n nearest magistrate judges, the agents did not bring him before a\n magistrate judge, but questioned him, hoping for a confession. At\n 5:27 p.m., some 9.5 hours after his arrest, Corley began an oral con\n2                      CORLEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    fession that he robbed the bank. He asked for a break at 6:30 and\n    was held overnight. The interrogation resumed the next morning,\n    ending with his signed written confession. He was finally presented\n    to a Magistrate Judge at 1:30 p.m., 29.5 hours after his arrest, and\n    charged with armed bank robbery and related charges. The District\n    Court denied his motion to suppress his confessions under Rule 5(a)\n    and McNabb-Mallory. It reasoned that the oral confession occurred\n    within §3501(c)’s six-hour window because the time of Corley’s medi\n    cal treatment should be excluded from the delay. It also found the\n    written confession admissible, explaining there was no unreasonable\n    delay under Rule 5(a) because Corley had requested the break. He\n    was convicted of conspiracy and bank robbery. The Third Circuit af\n    firmed. Relying on Circuit precedent to the effect that §3501 abro\n    gated McNabb-Mallory and replaced it with a pure voluntariness\n    test, it concluded that if a district court found a confession voluntary\n    after considering the points listed in §3501(b), it would be admissible,\n    even if the presentment delay was unreasonable.\nHeld: Section 3501 modified McNabb-Mallory but did not supplant it.\n Pp. 8–18.\n    (a) The Government claims that because §3501(a) makes a confes\n sion “admissible” “if it is voluntarily given,” it entirely eliminates\n McNabb-Mallory with its bar to admitting even a voluntary confes\n sion if given during an unreasonable presentment delay. Corley ar\n gues that §3501(a) was only meant to overrule Miranda, and notes\n that only §3501(c) touches on McNabb-Mallory, making the rule in\n applicable to confessions given within six hours of an arrest. He has\n the better argument. Pp. 8–16.\n      (1) The Government’s reading renders §3501(c) nonsensical and\n superfluous. If subsection (a) really meant that any voluntary con\n fession was admissible, then subsection (c) would add nothing; if a\n confession was “made voluntarily” it would be admissible, period, and\n never “inadmissible solely because of delay,” even a delay beyond six\n hours. The Government’s reading is thus at odds with the basic in\n terpretive canon that “ ‘[a] statute should be construed [to give effect]\n to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,\n void or insignificant.’ ” Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88, 101. The Gov\n ernment claims that in providing that a confession “shall not be ad\n missible,” Congress meant that a confession “shall not be [involun\n tary].” Thus read, (c) would specify a bright-line rule applying (a) to\n cases of delay: it would tell courts that delay alone does not make a\n confession involuntary unless the delay exceeds six hours. But\n “ ‘Congress did not write the statute that way.’ ” Russello v. United\n States, 464 U. S. 16, 23. The terms “inadmissible” and “involuntary”\n are not synonymous. Congress used both in (c), and this Court\n                   Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n“would not presume to ascribe this difference to a simple mistake in\ndraftsmanship.” Ibid. There is also every reason to believe that\nCongress used the distinct terms deliberately, specifying two criteria\nthat must be satisfied to prevent a confession from being “inadmissi\nble solely because of delay”: the confession must be “[1] made volun\ntarily and . . . [2] within six hours [of arrest].” Moreover, under the\nMcNabb-Mallory rule, “inadmissible” and “involuntary” mean differ\nent things. Corley’s position, in contrast, gives effect to both (c) and\n(a), by reading (a) as overruling Miranda and (c) as qualifying\nMcNabb-Mallory.          The Government’s counterargument—that\nCorley’s reading would also create a conflict, since (a) makes all vol\nuntary confessions admissible while (c) would leave some voluntary\nconfessions inadmissible—falls short. First, (a) is a broad directive\nwhile (c) aims only at McNabb-Mallory, and “a more specific statute\n[is] given precedence over a more general one.” Busic v. United\nStates, 446 U. S. 398, 406. Second, reading (a) to create a conflict\nwith (c) not only would make (c) superfluous, but would also create\nconflicts with so many other Rules of Evidence that the subsection\ncannot possibly be given its literal scope. Pp. 8–12.\n     (2) The legislative history strongly favors Corley’s reading. The\nGovernment points to nothing in this history supporting its contrary\nview. Pp. 13–15.\n     (3) The Government’s position would leave the Rule 5 present\nment requirement without teeth, for if there is no McNabb-Mallory\nthere is no apparent remedy for a presentment delay. The prompt\npresentment requirement is not just an administrative nicety. It\ndates back to the common law. Under Rule 5, presentment is the\npoint at which the judge must take several key steps to foreclose\nGovernment overreaching: e.g., informing the defendant of the\ncharges against him and giving the defendant a chance to consult\nwith counsel. Without McNabb-Mallory, federal agents would be free\nto question suspects for extended periods before bringing them out in\nthe open, even though “custodial police interrogation, by its very na\nture, isolates and pressures the individual,” Dickerson v. United\nStates, 530 U. S. 428, 435, inducing people to confess to crimes they\nnever committed. Pp. 15–16.\n   (b) There is no merit to the Government’s fallback claim that even\nif §3501 preserved a limited version of McNabb-Mallory, Congress cut\nit out by enacting Federal Rule of Evidence 402, which provides that\n“[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by\nthe Constitution of the United States, by Act of Congress, by these\nrules, or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court . . . .” The\nAdvisory Committee’s Notes expressly identified McNabb-Mallory as\na statutorily authorized rule that would survive Rule 402, and the\n4                    CORLEY v.

S. C. §3501 to discard, or merely to narrow, the rule in\nMcNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332 (1943), and Mal\nlory v. United States, 354 U. S. 449 (1957), under which an\narrested person’s confession is inadmissible if given after\nan unreasonable delay in bringing him before a judge. We\nhold that Congress meant to limit, not eliminate, McNabb-\nMallory.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   The common law obliged an arresting officer to bring his\nprisoner before a magistrate as soon as he reasonably\ncould. See County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S.\n44, 61–62 (1991) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). This “present\nment” requirement tended to prevent secret detention and\nserved to inform a suspect of the charges against him, and\nit was the law in nearly every American State and the\nNational Government. See id., at 60–61; McNabb, supra,\nat 342, and n. 7.\n   McNabb v. United States raised the question of how to\n2                CORLEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nenforce a number of federal statutes codifying the pre\nsentment rule. 318 U. S., at 342 (citing, among others, 18\nU. S. C. §595 (1940 ed.), which provided that “ ‘[i]t shall be\nthe duty of the marshal . . . who may arrest a person . . . to\ntake the defendant before the nearest . . . judicial officer\n. . . for a hearing’ ”). There, federal agents flouted the\nrequirement by interrogating several murder suspects for\ndays before bringing them before a magistrate, and then\nonly after they had given the confessions that convicted\nthem. 318 U. S., at 334–338, 344–345.\n    On the defendants’ motions to exclude the confessions\nfrom evidence, we saw no need to reach any constitutional\nissue. Instead we invoked the supervisory power to estab\nlish and maintain “civilized standards of procedure and\nevidence” in federal courts, id., at 340, which we exercised\nfor the sake of making good on the traditional obligation\nembodied in the federal presentment legislation. We saw\nboth the statutes and the traditional rule as aimed not\nonly at checking the likelihood of resort to the third degree\nbut meant generally to “avoid all the evil implications of\nsecret interrogation of persons accused of crime.” Id., at\n344. We acknowledged that “Congress ha[d] not explicitly\nforbidden the use of evidence . . . procured” in derogation\nof the presentment obligation, id., at 345, but we realized\nthat “permit[ting] such evidence to be made the basis of a\nconviction in the federal courts would stultify the policy\nwhich Congress ha[d] enacted into law,” ibid., and in the\nexercise of supervisory authority we held confessions\ninadmissible when obtained during unreasonable pre\nsentment delay.\n    Shortly after McNabb, the combined action of the Judi\ncial Conference of the United States and Congress pro\nduced Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5(a), which\npulled the several statutory presentment provisions to\ngether in one place. See Mallory, supra, at 452 (describing\nRule 5(a) as “a compendious restatement, without sub\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstantive change, of several prior specific federal statutory\nprovisions”). As first enacted, the rule told “[a]n officer\nmaking an arrest under a warrant issued upon a com\nplaint or any person making an arrest without a warrant\n[to] take the arrested person without unnecessary delay\nbefore the nearest available commissioner or before any\nother nearby officer empowered to commit persons\ncharged with offenses against the laws of the United\nStates.” Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 5(a) (1946). The rule re\nmains much the same today: “A person making an arrest\nwithin the United States must take the defendant without\nunnecessary delay before a magistrate judge . . . .” Fed.\nRule Crim. Proc. 5(a)(1)(A) (2007).\n   A case for applying McNabb and Rule 5(a) together soon\narose in Upshaw v. United States, 335 U. S. 410 (1948).\nDespite the Government’s confession of error, the D. C.\nCircuit had thought McNabb’s exclusionary rule applied\nonly to involuntary confessions obtained by coercion dur\ning the period of delay, 335 U. S., at 411–412, and so held\nthe defendant’s voluntary confession admissible into evi\ndence. This was error, and we reiterated the reasoning of\na few years earlier. “In the McNabb case we held that the\nplain purpose of the requirement that prisoners should\npromptly be taken before committing magistrates was to\ncheck resort by officers to ‘secret interrogation of persons\naccused of crime.’ ” Id., at 412 (quoting McNabb, supra, at\n344). Upshaw consequently emphasized that even volun\ntary confessions are inadmissible if given after an unrea\nsonable delay in presentment. 335 U. S., at 413.\n   We applied Rule 5(a) again in Mallory v. United States,\nholding a confession given seven hours after arrest inad\nmissible for “unnecessary delay” in presenting the suspect\nto a magistrate, where the police questioned the suspect\nfor hours “within the vicinity of numerous committing\nmagistrates.” 354 U. S., at 455. Again, we repeated the\nreasons for the rule and explained, as we had before and\n4                    CORLEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhave since, that delay for the purpose of interrogation is\nthe epitome of “unnecessary delay.” Id., at 455–456; see\nalso McLaughlin, 500 U. S., at 61 (SCALIA, J., dissenting)\n(“It was clear” at common law “that the only element\nbearing upon the reasonableness of delay was not such\ncircumstances as the pressing need to conduct further\ninvestigation, but the arresting officer’s ability, once the\nprisoner had been secured, to reach a magistrate”); Up\nshaw, supra, at 414. Thus, the rule known simply as\nMcNabb-Mallory “generally render[s] inadmissible confes\nsions made during periods of detention that violat[e] the\nprompt presentment requirement of Rule 5(a).” United\nStates v. Alvarez-Sanchez, 511 U. S. 350, 354 (1994).\n   There the law remained until 1968, when Congress\nenacted 18 U. S. C. §3501 in response to Miranda v. Ari\nzona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), and to the application of\nMcNabb-Mallory in some federal courts. Subsections (a)\nand (b) of §3501 were meant to eliminate Miranda.1 See\nDickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 435–437 (2000);\ninfra, at 13–14. Subsection (a) provides that “[i]n any\ncriminal prosecution brought by the United States . . . , a\nconfession . . . shall be admissible in evidence if it is volun\ntarily given,” while subsection (b) lists several considera\ntions for courts to address in assessing voluntariness.2\n——————\n   1 We rejected this attempt to overrule Miranda in Dickerson v. United\n\nStates, 530 U.

UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  The issue in this case is whether Congress intended\n§3501(a) to sweep McNabb-Mallory’s exclusionary rule\naside entirely, or merely meant §3501(c) to provide immu\nnization to voluntary confessions given within six hours of\na suspect’s arrest.\n                              B\n  Petitioner Johnnie Corley was suspected of robbing a\nbank in Norristown, Pennsylvania. After federal agents\nlearned that Corley was subject to arrest on an unrelated\nlocal matter, some federal and state officers went together\nto execute the state warrant on September 17, 2003, and\nfound him just as he was pulling out of a driveway in his\ncar. Corley nearly ran over one officer, then jumped out of\nthe car, pushed the officer down, and ran. The agents\ngave chase and caught and arrested him for assaulting a\nfederal officer. The arrest occurred about 8 a.m. 500 F. 3d\n210, 212 (CA3 2007).\n  FBI agents first kept Corley at a local police station\nwhile they questioned residents near the place he was\ncaptured. Around 11:45 a.m. they took him to a Philadel\nphia hospital to treat a minor cut on his hand that he got\nduring the chase. At 3:30 p.m. the agents took him from\nthe hospital to the Philadelphia FBI office and told him\nthat he was a suspect in the Norristown bank robbery.\nThough the office was in the same building as the cham\nbers of the nearest magistrate judges, the agents did not\nbring Corley before a magistrate, but questioned him\ninstead, in hopes of getting a confession. App. 68–69, 83,\n138–139.\n——————\ndetention: Provided, That the time limitation contained in this subsec\ntion shall not apply in any case in which the delay in bringing such\nperson before such magistrate judge or other officer beyond such six\nhour period is found by the trial judge to be reasonable considering the\nmeans of transportation and the distance to be traveled to the nearest\navailable such magistrate judge or other officer.”\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The agents’ repeated arguments sold Corley on the\nbenefits of cooperating with the Government, and he\nsigned a form waiving his Miranda rights. At 5:27 p.m.,\nsome 9.5 hours after his arrest, Corley began an oral\nconfession that he robbed the bank, id., at 62, and spoke\non in this vein until about 6:30, when agents asked him to\nput it all in writing. Corley said he was tired and wanted\na break, so the agents decided to hold him overnight and\ntake the written statement the next morning. At 10:30\na.m. on September 18 they began the interrogation again,\nwhich ended when Corley signed a written confession. He\nwas finally presented to a magistrate at 1:30 p.m. that\nday, 29.5 hours after his arrest. 500 F. 3d, at 212.\n   Corley was charged with armed bank robbery, 18\nU. S. C. §2113(a), (d), conspiracy to commit armed bank\nrobbery, §371, and using a firearm in furtherance of a\ncrime of violence, §924(c). When he moved to suppress his\noral and written confessions under Rule 5(a) and McNabb-\nMallory, the District Court denied the motion, with the\nexplanation that the time Corley was receiving medical\ntreatment should be excluded from the delay, and that the\noral confession was thus given within the six-hour window\nof §3501(c). Crim. No. 03–775 (ED Pa., May 10, 2004),\nApp. 97. The District Court also held Corley’s written\nconfession admissible, reasoning that “a break from inter\nrogation requested by an arrestee who has already begun\nhis confession does not constitute unreasonable delay\nunder Rule 5(a).” Id., at 97–98. Corley was convicted of\nconspiracy and armed robbery but acquitted of using a\nfirearm during a crime of violence. 500 F. 3d, at 212–213.\n   A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Third\nCircuit affirmed the conviction, though its rationale for\nrejecting Corley’s Rule 5(a) argument was different from\nthe District Court’s. The panel majority considered itself\nbound by Circuit precedent to the effect that §3501 en\ntirely abrogated the McNabb-Mallory rule and replaced it\n8                   CORLEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwith a pure voluntariness test. See 500 F. 3d, at 212\n(citing Government of the Virgin Islands v. Gereau, 502\nF. 2d 914 (CA3 1974)). As the majority saw it, if a district\ncourt found a confession voluntary after considering the\npoints listed in §3501(b), it would be admissible, regard\nless of whether delay in presentment was unnecessary or\nunreasonable. 500 F. 3d, at 217. Judge Sloviter read\nGereau differently and dissented with an opinion that\n“§3501 does not displace Rule 5(a)” or abrogate McNabb-\nMallory for presentment delays beyond six hours. 500\nF. 3d, at 236.\n   We granted certiorari to resolve a division in the Circuit\nCourts on the reach of §3501. 554 U. S. ___ (2008). Com\npare United States v. Glover, 104 F. 3d 1570, 1583 (CA10\n1997) (§3501 entirely supplanted McNabb-Mallory);\nUnited States v. Christopher, 956 F. 2d 536, 538–539 (CA6\n1991) (same), with United States v. Mansoori, 304 F. 3d\n635, 660 (CA7 2002) (§3501 limited the McNabb-Mallory\nrule to periods more than six hours after arrest); United\nStates v.

Alvarez-Sanchez, 511 U. S. 350 (1994), but ultimately resolved\nthat case on a different ground, id., at 355–360.\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

By\nproviding that a confession “shall not be inadmissible\nsolely because of delay” in presentment if “made voluntar\nily and . . . within six hours [of arrest],” subsection (c)\nleaves McNabb-Mallory inapplicable to confessions given\nwithin the six hours, but when a confession comes even\nlater, the exclusionary rule applies and courts have to see\nwhether the delay was unnecessary or unreasonable.\n   Corley has the better argument.\n                                 A\n  The fundamental problem with the Government’s read\ning of §3501 is that it renders §3501(c) nonsensical and\nsuperfluous. Subsection (c) provides that a confession\n“shall not be inadmissible solely because of delay” in pre\nsentment if the confession is “made voluntarily and . . .\nwithin six hours [of arrest].” If (a) really meant that any\nvoluntary confession was admissible, as the Government\ncontends, then (c) would add nothing; if a confession was\n“made voluntarily” it would be admissible, period, and\nnever “inadmissible solely because of delay,” no matter\nwhether the delay went beyond six hours. There is no way\nout of this, and the Government concedes it. Tr. of Oral\nArg. 33 (“Congress never needed (c); (c) in the [G]overn\nment’s view was always superfluous”).\n  The Government’s reading is thus at odds with one of\nthe most basic interpretive canons, that “ ‘[a] statute\nshould be construed so that effect is given to all its provi\nsions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,\nvoid or insignificant . . . .’ ” Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88,\n101 (2004) (quoting 2A N. Singer, Statutes and Statutory\nConstruction §46.06, pp.181–186 (rev. 6th ed. 2000)).5 The\n——————\n  5 The dissent says that the antisuperfluousness canon has no place\n\nhere because “there is nothing ambiguous about the language of\n§3501(a).” Post, at 2 (opinion of ALITO, J.).

United\nStates, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (quoting United States v.\nNaftalin, 441 U. S. 768, 773 (1979)). The Government\nmay say that we can sensibly read “inadmissible” as “in\nvoluntary” because the words are “virtually synonymous\n. . . in this statutory context,” Brief for United States 23,\nbut this is simply not so. To begin with, Congress used\n\n——————\n“the cardinal rule that a statute is to be read as a whole,” King v. St.\nVincent’s Hospital, 502 U. S. 215, 221 (1991). Subsection 3501(a) seems\nclear only if one ignores the absurd results of a literal reading, infra, at\n11–12, and only until one reads §3501(c) and recognizes that if (a)\nmeans what it literally says, (c) serves no purpose. Even the dissent\nconcedes that when (a) and (c) are read together, “[t]here is simply no\nperfect solution to the problem before us.” Post, at 4. Thus, the dis\nsent’s point that subsection (a) seems clear when read in isolation\nproves nothing, for “[t]he meaning—or ambiguity—of certain words or\nphrases may only become evident when placed in context.” FDA v.\nBrown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 132 (2000). When\nsubsection (a) is read in context, there is no avoiding the question,\n“What could Congress have been getting at with both (a) and (c)?” The\nbetter answer is that Congress meant to do just what Members explic\nitly said in the legislative record. See infra, at 13–15.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nboth terms in (c) itself, and “[w]e would not presume to\nascribe this difference to a simple mistake in draftsman\nship.” Russello, supra, at 23. And there is, in fact, every\nreason to believe that Congress used the distinct terms\nvery deliberately. Subsection (c) specifies two criteria that\nmust be satisfied to prevent a confession from being “in\nadmissible solely because of delay”: the confession must be\n“[1] made voluntarily and . . . [2] within six hours [of\narrest].” Because voluntariness is thus only one of several\ncriteria for admissibility under (c), “involuntary” and\n“inadmissible” plainly cannot be synonymous. What is\nmore, the Government’s argument ignores the fact that\nunder the McNabb-Mallory rule, which we presume Con\ngress was aware of, Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441\nU. S. 677, 699 (1979), “inadmissible” and “involuntary”\nmean different things. As we explained before and as the\nGovernment concedes, McNabb-Mallory makes even vol\nuntary confessions inadmissible if given after an unrea\nsonable delay in presentment, Upshaw, 335 U. S., at 413;\nTr. of Oral Arg. 33 (“[I]t was well understood that\nMcNabb-Mallory . . . excluded totally voluntary confes\nsions”). So we cannot accept the Government’s attempt to\nconfuse the critically distinct terms “involuntary” and\n“inadmissible” by rewriting (c) into a bright-line rule doing\nnothing more than applying (a).\n  Corley’s position, in contrast, gives effect to both (c) and\n(a), by reading (a) as overruling Miranda and (c) as quali\nfying McNabb-Mallory. The Government answers, how\never, that accepting Corley’s argument would result in a\ndifferent problem: it would create a conflict between (c)\nand (a), since (a) provides that all voluntary confessions\nare admissible while Corley’s reading of (c) leaves some\nvoluntary confessions inadmissible. But the Government’s\ncounterargument falls short for two reasons. First, even if\n(a) is read to be at odds with (c), the conflict is resolved by\nrecognizing that (a) is a broad directive while (c) aims only\n12                  CORLEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nat McNabb-Mallory, and “a more specific statute will be\ngiven precedence over a more general one . . . .” Busic v.\nUnited States, 446 U. S. 398, 406 (1980). Second, and\nmore fundamentally, (a) cannot prudently be read to\ncreate a conflict with (c), not only because it would make\n(c) superfluous, as explained, but simply because reading\n(a) that way would create conflicts with so many other\nrules that the subsection cannot possibly be given its\nliteral scope. Subsection (a) provides that “[i]n any crimi\nnal prosecution brought by the United States . . . , a con\nfession . . . shall be admissible in evidence if it is voluntar\nily given,” and §3501(e) defines “confession” as “any\nconfession of guilt of any criminal offense or any self\nincriminating statement made or given orally or in writ\ning.” Thus, if the Government seriously urged a literal\nreading, (a) would mean that “in any criminal prosecution\nbrought by the United States . . . , [‘any self-incriminating\nstatement’ with respect to ‘any criminal offense’] . . . shall\nbe admissible in evidence if it is voluntarily given.” Thus\nwould many a Rule of Evidence be overridden in case after\ncase: a defendant’s self-incriminating statement to his\nlawyer would be admissible despite his insistence on\nattorney-client privilege; a fourth-hand hearsay statement\nthe defendant allegedly made would come in; and a defen\ndant’s confession to an entirely unrelated crime committed\nyears earlier would be admissible without more. These\nare some of the absurdities of literalism that show that\nCongress could not have been writing in a literalistic\nframe of mind.6\n——————\n   6 The dissent seeks to avoid these absurd results by claiming that\n\n“§3501(a) does not supersede ordinary evidence Rules,” post, at 10, but\nits only argument for this conclusion is that “there is no reason to\nsuppose that Congress meant any such thing,” post, at 9. The dissent is\ncertainly correct that there is no reason to suppose that Congress\nmeant any such thing; that is what our reductio ad absurdum shows.\nBut that leaves the dissent saying, “§3501(a) must be read literally”\n                      Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                               B\n  As it turns out, there is more than reductio ad absur\ndum and the antisuperfluousness canon to confirm that\nsubsection (a) leaves McNabb-Mallory alone, for that is\nwhat legislative history says. In fact, the Government\nconcedes that subsections (a) and (b) were aimed at\nMiranda, while subsection (c) was meant to modify the\npresentment exclusionary rule. Tr. of Oral Arg. 38 (“I will\nconcede to you . . . that section (a) was considered to over\nrule Miranda, and subsection (c) was addressed to\nMcNabb-Mallory”). The concession is unavoidable. The\nSenate, where §3501 originated, split the provision into\ntwo parts: Division 1 contained subsections (a) and (b),\nand Division 2 contained subsection (c). 114 Cong. Rec.\n14171 (1968). In the debate on the Senate floor immedi\nately before voting on these proposals, several Senators,\nincluding the section’s prime sponsor, Senator McClellan,\nexplained that Division 1 “has to do with the Miranda\ndecision,” while Division 2 related to Mallory. 114 Cong.\nRec. 14171–14172. This distinct intent was confirmed by\nthe separate Senate votes adopting the two measures,\nDivision 1 by 55 to 29 and Division 2 by 58 to 26, id., at\n14171–14172, 14174–14175; if (a) did abrogate McNabb-\nMallory, as the Government claims, then voting for Divi\nsion 2 would have been entirely superfluous, for the Divi\nsion 1 vote would already have done the job. That aside, a\nsponsor’s statement to the full Senate carries considerable\nweight, and Senator McClellan’s explanation that Division\n1 was specifically addressed to Miranda confirms that (a)\nand (b) were never meant to reach far enough to abrogate\n——————\n(rendering §3501(c) superfluous), “but not too literally” (so that it would\noverride other Rules of Evidence). The dissent cannot have it both\nways. If it means to profess literalism it will have to take the absurdity\nthat literalism brings with it; “credo quia absurdum” (as Tertullian\nmay have said). If it will not take the absurd, then its literalism is no\nalternative to our reading of the statute.\n14                  CORLEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nother background evidentiary rules including McNabb-\nMallory.\n   Further legislative history not only drives that point\nhome, but conclusively shows an intent that subsection (c)\nlimit McNabb-Mallory, not replace it. In its original draft,\nsubsection (c) would indeed have done away with McNabb-\nMallory completely, for the bill as first written would have\nprovided that “[i]n any criminal prosecution by the United\nStates . . . , a confession made or given by a person who is\na defendant therein . . . shall not be inadmissible solely\nbecause of delay in bringing such person before a [magis\ntrate] if such confession is . . . made voluntarily.” S. 917,\n90th Cong., 2d Sess., 44–45 (1968) (as reported by Senate\nCommittee on the Judiciary); 114 Cong. Rec. 14172. The\nprovision so conceived was resisted, however, by a number\nof Senators worried about allowing indefinite presentment\ndelays. See, e.g., id., at 11740, 13990 (Sen. Tydings) (the\nprovision would “permit Federal criminal suspects to be\nquestioned indefinitely before they are presented to a\ncommitting magistrate”); id., at 12290 (Sen. Fong) (the\nprovision “would open the doors to such practices as hold\ning suspects incommunicado for an indefinite period”).\nAfter Senator Tydings proposed striking (c) from the bill\naltogether, id., at 13651 (Amendment No. 788), Senator\nScott introduced the compromise of qualifying (c) with the\nwords: “ ‘and if such confession was made or given by such\nperson within six hours following his arrest or other de\ntention.’ ” Id., at 14184–14185 (Amendment No. 805).7\nThe amendment was intended to confine McNabb-Mallory\nto excluding only confessions given after more than six\nhours of delay, see 114 Cong.

C. Crime Act),\n§301(b), 81 Stat. 735–736, see, e.g., 114 Cong. Rec. 14184\n(remarks of Sen. Scott) (“My amendment is an attempt to\nconform, as nearly as practicable, to Title III of [the D. C.\nCrime Act]”). By the terms of that Act, “[a]ny statement,\nadmission, or confession made by an arrested person\nwithin three hours immediately following his arrest shall\nnot be excluded from evidence in the courts of the District\nof Columbia solely because of delay in presentment.”\n§301(b), 81 Stat. 735–736. Given the clear intent that\nTitle III modify but not eliminate McNabb-Mallory in the\nDistrict of Columbia, see, e.g., S. Rep. No. 912, 90th Cong.,\n1st Sess., 17–18 (1967), using it as a model plainly shows\nhow Congress meant as much but no more in §3501(c).\n  In sum, the legislative history strongly favors Corley’s\nreading. The Government points to nothing in this history\nsupporting its view that (c) created a bright-line rule for\napplying (a) in cases with a presentment issue.\n                              C\n   It also counts heavily against the position of the United\nStates that it would leave the Rule 5 presentment re\nquirement without any teeth, for as the Government again\nis forced to admit, if there is no McNabb-Mallory there is\nno apparent remedy for delay in presentment. Tr. of Oral\nArg. 25. One might not care if the prompt presentment\nrequirement were just some administrative nicety, but in\nfact the rule has always mattered in very practical ways\nand still does. As we said, it stretches back to the common\nlaw, when it was “one of the most important” protections\n“against unlawful arrest.” McLaughlin, 500 U. S., at 60–\n16                CORLEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n61 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Today presentment is the\npoint at which the judge is required to take several key\nsteps to foreclose Government overreaching: informing the\ndefendant of the charges against him, his right to remain\nsilent, his right to counsel, the availability of bail, and any\nright to a preliminary hearing; giving the defendant a\nchance to consult with counsel; and deciding between\ndetention or release. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 5(d); see also\nRule 58(b)(2).\n   In a world without McNabb-Mallory, federal agents\nwould be free to question suspects for extended periods\nbefore bringing them out in the open, and we have always\nknown what custodial secrecy leads to. See McNabb, 318\nU. S. 332. No one with any smattering of the history of\n20th-century dictatorships needs a lecture on the subject,\nand we understand the need even within our own system\nto take care against going too far. “[C]ustodial police\ninterrogation, by its very nature, isolates and pressures\nthe individual,” Dickerson, 530 U. S., at 435, and there is\nmounting empirical evidence that these pressures can\ninduce a frighteningly high percentage of people to confess\nto crimes they never committed, see, e.g., Drizin & Leo,\nThe Problem of False Confessions in the Post-DNA World,\n82 N. C. L. Rev. 891, 906–907 (2004).\n   Justice Frankfurter’s point in McNabb is as fresh as\never: “The history of liberty has largely been the history of\nobservance of procedural safeguards.” 318 U. S., at 347.\nMcNabb-Mallory is one of them, and neither the text nor\nthe history of §3501 makes out a case that Congress\nmeant to do away with it.\n                           III\n  The Government’s fallback claim is that even if §3501\npreserved a limited version of McNabb-Mallory, Congress\ncut out the rule altogether by enacting Federal Rule of\nEvidence 402 in 1975.

So far as it might matter here, that rule pro\nvides that “[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible, except as\notherwise provided by the Constitution of the United\nStates, by Act of Congress, by these rules, or by other\nrules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statu\ntory authority.” The Government says that McNabb-\nMallory excludes relevant evidence in a way not “other\nwise provided by” any of these four authorities, and so has\nfallen to the scythe.\n   The Government never raised this argument in the\nThird Circuit or the District Court, which would justify\nrefusing to consider it here, but in any event it has no\nmerit. The Advisory Committee’s Notes on Rule 402,\nwhich were before Congress when it enacted the Rules of\nEvidence and which we have relied on in the past to inter\npret the rules, Tome v. United States, 513 U. S. 150, 160\n(1995) (plurality opinion), expressly identified McNabb-\nMallory as a statutorily authorized rule that would sur\nvive Rule 402: “The Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure\nin some instances require the exclusion of relevant evi\ndence. For example, . . . the effective enforcement of . . .\nRule 5(a) . . . is held to require the exclusion of statements\nelicited during detention in violation thereof.” 28 U. S. C.\nApp., pp. 325–326 (citing Mallory, 354 U. S. 449, and 18\nU. S.

Indeed, the Gov\nernment has previously conceded before this Court that\nRule 402 preserved McNabb-Mallory. Brief for United\nStates in United States v. Payner, O. T. 1979, No. 78–\n1729, p. 32, and n. 13 (1979) (saying that Rule 402 “left to\nthe courts . . . questions concerning the propriety of ex\ncluding relevant evidence as a method of implementing\nthe Constitution, a federal statute, or a statutorily author\nized rule,” and citing McNabb-Mallory as an example).\nThe Government was right the first time, and it would be\n18               CORLEY v.

Under the rule as revised by §3501(c), a\ndistrict court with a suppression claim must find whether\nthe defendant confessed within six hours of arrest (unless\na longer delay was “reasonable considering the means of\ntransportation and the distance to be traveled to the near\nest available [magistrate]”). If the confession came within\nthat period, it is admissible, subject to the other Rules of\nEvidence, so long as it was “made voluntarily and . . . the\nweight to be given [it] is left to the jury.” Ibid. If the\nconfession occurred before presentment and beyond six\nhours, however, the court must decide whether delaying\nthat long was unreasonable or unnecessary under the\nMcNabb-Mallory cases, and if it was, the confession is to\nbe suppressed.\n   In this case, the Third Circuit did not apply this rule\nand in consequence never conclusively determined\nwhether Corley’s oral confession “should be treated as\nhaving been made within six hours of arrest,” as the Dis\ntrict Court held. 500 F. 3d, at 220, n. 7. Nor did the Cir\ncuit consider the justifiability of any delay beyond six\nhours if the oral confession should be treated as given\noutside the six-hour window; and it did not make this\nenquiry with respect to Corley’s written confession. We\ntherefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and\nremand the case for consideration of those issues in the\nfirst instance, consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                      Cite as: 556 U.

S. C. §3501(a) was\nadopted. According to the Court, this rule survived the\nenactment of §3501(a) because Congress adopted that\nprovision for the sole purpose of abrogating Miranda and\napparently never realized that the provision’s broad lan\nguage would also do away with the McNabb-Mallory rule.\nI disagree with the Court’s analysis and therefore respect\nfully dissent.\n                             II \n\n                             A\n\n  The Court’s first and most substantial argument in\nvokes “the antisuperfluousness canon,” ante, at 12, under\nwhich a statute should be read, if possible, so that all of its\nprovisions are given effect and none is superfluous.

But we\nhave observed before that such ‘interpretative canon[s are]\nnot a license for the judiciary to rewrite language enacted\nby the legislature.’ ” United States v. Monsanto, 491 U. S.\n600, 611 (1989) (quoting United States v. Albertini, 472\nU. S. 675, 680 (1985)). Like other canons, the antisuper\nfluousness canon is merely an interpretive aid, not an\nabsolute rule. See Connecticut Nat. Bank, 503 U. S., at\n254 (“When the words of a statute are unambiguous, then,\nthis first canon is also the last: ‘judicial inquiry is com\nplete’ ”). There are times when Congress enacts provisions\nthat are superfluous, and this may be such an instance.\nCf. id., at 253 (noting that “[r]edundancies across statutes\nare not unusual events in drafting”); Gutierrez de Martinez\nv.

The Government contends that §3501(c),\nthough inartfully drafted, is not superfluous because what\nthe provision means is that a confession is admissible if it\nis given within six hours of arrest and it is otherwise vol\nuntary—that is, if there is no basis other than prepre\nsentment delay for concluding that the confession was\ncoerced. Read in this way, §3501(c) is not superfluous.\n   The Court rejects this argument on the ground that\n4                 CORLEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n“ ‘Congress did not write the statute that way,’ ” ante, at\n10, and thus, in order to adhere to a narrow reading of\n§3501(c), the Court entirely disregards the unambiguous\nlanguage of §3501(a). Although §3501(a) says that a\nconfession is admissible if it is “voluntarily given,” the\nCourt reads that provision to mean that a voluntary con\nfession may not be excluded on the ground that the confes\nsion was obtained in violation of Miranda. To this read\ning, the short answer is that Congress really did not write\nthe statute that way.\n   As is true with most of the statutory interpretation\nquestions that come before this Court, the question in this\ncase is not like a jigsaw puzzle. There is simply no perfect\nsolution to the problem before us.\n   Instead, we must choose between two imperfect solu\ntions. The first (the one adopted by the Court) entirely\ndisregards the clear and simple language of §3501(a), rests\non the proposition that Congress did not understand the\nplain import of the language it used in subsection (a), but\nadheres to a strictly literal interpretation of §3501(c). The\nsecond option respects the clear language of subsection (a),\nbut either accepts some statutory surplusage or interprets\n§3501(c)’s reference to a voluntary confession to mean an\notherwise voluntary confession. To my mind, the latter\nchoice is far preferable.\n                              B\n  In addition to the antisuperfluousness canon, the Court\nrelies on the canon that favors a specific statutory provi\nsion over a conflicting provision cast in more general\nterms, ante, at 11, but that canon is inapplicable here. For\none thing, §3501(a) is quite specific; it specifically provides\nthat if a confession is voluntary, it is admissible. More\nimportant, there is no other provision, specific or general,\nthat conflicts with §3501(a). See National Cable & Tele\ncommunications Assn., Inc. v. Gulf Power Co., 534 U. S.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           5\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n327, 335–336 (2002) (“It is true that specific statutory\nlanguage should control more general language when there\nis a conflict between the two. Here, however, there is no\nconflict” (emphasis added)). Subsection (c) is not conflict\ning because it does not authorize the suppression of any\nvoluntary confession. What the Court identifies is not a\nconflict between two statutory provisions but a conflict\nbetween the express language of one provision (§3501(a))\nand the “negative implication” that the Court draws from\nanother (§3501(c)). United States v. Alvarez-Sanchez, 511\nU. S. 350, 355 (1994). Because §3501(c) precludes the\nsuppression of a voluntary confession based solely on a\ndelay of less than six hours, the Court infers that Con\ngress must have contemplated that a voluntary confession\ncould be suppressed based solely on a delay of more than\nsix hours. The Court cites no authority for a canon of\ninterpretation that favors a “negative implication” of this\nsort over clear and express statutory language.\n                               C\n   The Court contends that a literal interpretation of\n§3501(a) would leave the prompt presentment require\nment set out in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5(a)(1)\n“without any teeth, for . . . if there is no McNabb-Mallory\nthere is no apparent remedy for delay in presentment.”\nAnte, at 15. There is nothing strange, however, about a\nprompt presentment requirement that is not enforced by a\nrule excluding voluntary confessions made during a period\nof excessive prepresentment delay. As the Court notes,\n“[t]he common law obliged an arresting officer to bring his\nprisoner before a magistrate as soon as he reasonably\ncould,” ante, at 1, but the McNabb-Mallory supervisory\nrule was not adopted until the middle of the 20th century.\nTo this day, while the States are required by the Fourth\nAmendment to bring an arrestee promptly before a judi\ncial officer, see, e.g., County of Riverside v. McLaughlin,\n6                CORLEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n500 U. S. 44, 56 (1991), we have never held that this con\nstitutional requirement is backed by an automatic exclu\nsionary sanction, see, e.g., Hudson v. Michigan, 547 U. S.\n586, 592 (2006). And although the prompt presentment\nrequirement serves interests in addition to the prevention\nof coerced confessions, the McNabb-Mallory rule provides\nno sanction for excessive prepresentment delay in those\ninstances in which no confession is sought or obtained.\n   Moreover, the need for the McNabb-Mallory exclusion\nary rule is no longer clear. That rule, which was adopted\nlong before Miranda, originally served a purpose that is\nnow addressed by the giving of Miranda warnings upon\narrest. As Miranda recognized, McNabb and Mallory\nwere “responsive to the same considerations of Fifth\nAmendment policy” that the Miranda rule was devised to\naddress. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 463 (1966).\n   In the pre-Miranda era, the requirement of prompt\npresentment ensured that persons taken into custody\nwould, within a relatively short period, receive advice\nabout their rights. See McNabb v. United States, 318\nU. S. 332, 344 (1943). Now, however, Miranda ensures\nthat arrestees receive such advice at an even earlier point,\nwithin moments of being taken into custody. Of course,\narrestees, after receiving Miranda warnings, may waive\ntheir rights and submit to questioning by law enforcement\nofficers, see, e.g., Davis v. United States, 512 U. S. 452,\n458 (1994), and arrestees may likewise waive the prompt\npresentment requirement, see, e.g., New York v. Hill, 528\nU. S. 110, 114 (2000) (“We have . . . ‘in the context of a\nbroad array of constitutional and statutory provisions,’\narticulated a general rule that presumes the availability of\nwaiver, . . . and we have recognized that ‘the most basic\nrights of criminal defendants are . . . subject to waiver’ ”).\nIt seems unlikely that many arrestees who are willing to\nwaive the right to remain silent and the right to the assis\ntance of counsel during questioning would balk at waiving\n                   Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                 7\n\n                        ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthe right to prompt presentment. More than a few courts\nof appeals have gone as far as to hold that a waiver of\nMiranda rights also constitutes a waiver under McNabb-\nMallory. See, e.g., United States v. Salamanca, 990 F. 2d\n629, 634 (CADC), cert. denied, 510 U. S. 928 (1993);\nUnited States v. Barlow, 693 F. 2d 954, 959 (CA6 1982),\ncert. denied, 461 U. S. 945 (1983); United States v. Indian\nBoy X, 565 F. 2d 585, 591 (CA9 1977), cert. denied, 439\nU. S. 841 (1978); United States v. Duvall, 537 F. 2d 15, 23–\n24, n. 9 (CA2), cert. denied, 426 U. S. 950 (1976); United\nStates v. Howell, 470 F. 2d 1064, 1067, n. 1 (CA9 1972);\nPettyjohn v. United States, 419 F. 2d 651, 656 (CADC\n1969), cert. denied, 397 U. S. 1058 (1970); O’Neal v. United\nStates, 411 F. 2d 131, 136–137 (CA5), cert. denied, 396\nU. S. 827 (1969). Whether or not those decisions are\ncorrect, it is certainly not clear that the McNabb-Mallory\nrule adds much protection beyond that provided by\nMiranda.\n                             D\n  The Court contends that the legislative history of §3501\nsupports its interpretation, but the legislative history\nproves nothing that is not evident from the terms of the\nstatute. With respect to §3501(a), the legislative history\ncertainly shows that the provision’s chief backers meant to\ndo away with Miranda,3 but the Court cites no evidence\nthat this was all that §3501(a) was intended to accom\nplish. To the contrary, the Senate Report clearly says that\n§3501(a) was meant to reinstate the traditional rule that a\n\n——————\n  3 At argument, the Government conceded “that section (a) was con\n\nsidered to overrule Miranda and subsection (c) was addressed to\nMcNabb-Mallory.” See Tr. of Oral Arg. 38. It is apparent that the\nattorney for the Government chose his words carefully and did not\nconcede, as the Court seems to suggest, that subsection (a) was in\ntended to do no more than to overrule Miranda or that subsection (c)\nwas the only part of §3501 that affected the McNabb-Mallory rule.\n8                CORLEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nconfession should be excluded only if involuntary, see\nS. Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 38 (1968) (Senate\nReport), a step that obviously has consequences beyond\nthe elimination of Miranda. And the Senate Report re\npeatedly cited Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478 (1964), as\nan example of an unsound limitation on the admission of\nvoluntary confessions, see Senate Report 41–51, thus\nillustrating that §3501(a) was not understood as simply an\nanti-Miranda provision. Whether a majority of the Mem\nbers of the House and Senate had the McNabb-Mallory\nrule specifically in mind when they voted for §3501(a) is\nimmaterial. Statutory provisions may often have a reach\nthat is broader than the specific targets that the lawmak\ners might have had in mind at the time of enactment.\n   The legislative history relating to §3501(c) suggests\nnothing more than that some Members of Congress may\nmistakenly have thought that the version of §3501 that\nwas finally adopted would not displace the McNabb-\nMallory rule. As the Court relates, the version of §3501(c)\nthat emerged from the Senate Judiciary Committee would\nhave completely eliminated that rule. See ante, at 12–13.\nSome Senators opposed this, and the version of this provi\nsion that was eventually passed simply trimmed the rule.\nIt is possible to identify a few Senators who spoke out in\nopposition to the earlier version of subsection (c) and then\nvoted in favor of the version that eventually passed, and it\nis fair to infer that these Senators likely thought that the\namendment of subsection (c) had saved the rule. See 114\nCong. Rec. 14172–14175, 14798 (1968). But there is no\nevidence that a majority of the House and Senate shared\nthat view, and any Member who took a few moments to\nread subsections (a) and (c) must readily have understood\nthat subsection (a) would wipe away all non-constitution\nally based rules barring the admission of voluntary confes\nsions, not just Miranda, and that subsection (c) did not\nauthorize the suppression of any voluntary confessions.\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   9\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nThe Court unjustifiably attributes to a majority of the\nHouse and Senate a mistake that, the legislative history\nsuggests, may have been made by only a few.\n                                E\n  Finally, the Court argues that under a literal reading of\n§3501(a), “many a rule of evidence [would] be overridden\nin case after case.” Ante, at 12. In order to avoid this\nabsurd result, the Court says, it is necessary to read\n§3501(a) as merely abrogating Miranda and not\nthe McNabb-Mallory rule. There is no merit to this\nargument.4\n  The language that Congress used in §3501(a)—a confes\nsion is “admissible” if “voluntarily given”—is virtually a\nverbatim quotation of the language used by this Court in\ndescribing the traditional rule regarding the admission of\nconfessions. See, e.g., Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S.\n503, 513 (1963) (“ ‘ In short, the true test of admissibility is\nthat the confession is made freely, voluntarily and without\ncompulsion or inducement of any sort.’ ” (quoting Wilson v.\nUnited States, 162 U. S. 613, 623 (1896))); Lyons v. Okla\nhoma, 322 U. S. 596, 602 (1944); Ziang Sung Wan v.\nUnited States, 266 U. S. 1, 15 (1924); Bram v. United\nStates, 168 U. S. 532, 545 (1897). In making these state\nments, this Court certainly did not mean to suggest that a\nvoluntary confession must be admitted in those instances\nin which a standard rule of evidence would preclude ad\nmission, and there is no reason to suppose that Congress\nmeant any such thing either. In any event, the Federal\n\n——————\n   4 Contrary to the Court’s suggestion, cases in which one of the stan\n\ndard Rules of Evidence might block the admission of a voluntary\nconfession would seem quite rare, and the Court cites no real-world\nexamples. The Court thus justifies its reading of §3501, which totally\ndisregards the clear language of subsection (a), based on a few essen\ntially fanciful hypothetical cases that, in any event, have been covered\nsince 1975 by the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n10               CORLEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nRules of Evidence now make it clear that §3501(a) does\nnot supersede ordinary evidence Rules, including Rules\nregarding privilege (Rule 501), hearsay (Rule 802), and\nrestrictions on the use of character evidence (Rule 404).\nThus, it is not necessary to disregard the plain language of\n§3501(a), as the Court does, in order to avoid the sort of\nabsurd results to which the Court refers.\n  For all these reasons, I would affirm the decision of the\nCourt of Appeals, and I therefore respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145888/", "sha1": "3c867d0b767b5f61c23ad5407f20c77a9be1b331", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-043", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:09:14"}
