NAVAJO NATION\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 07–1410. Argued February 23, 2009—Decided April 6, 2009\nThe Navajo Nation has long sought damages under the Indian Tucker\n  Act (ITA) for an asserted breach of fiduciary duty by the Secretary of\n  the Interior in connection with his failure promptly to approve a roy\n  alty rate increase under a coal lease (Lease 8580) the Tribe executed\n  in 1964. Six years ago, this Court held that “the Tribe’s claim for\n  compensation . . . fails.” United States v. Navajo Nation, 537 U. S.\n  488, 493 (Navajo I). The Court explained that in order to invoke the\n  ITA and thereby bypass federal sovereign immunity, a tribe “must\n  identify a substantive source of law that establishes specific fiduciary\n  or other duties, and allege that the Government has failed faithfully\n  to perform those duties.” Id., at 506. Holding that such duties were\n  not imposed by the Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938 (IMLA), by\n  the Indian Mineral Development Act of 1982 (IMDA), or by 25\n  U. S. C. §399, the Court reversed a judgment for the Tribe and re\n  manded. The Court of Federal Claims then dismissed the Tribe’s\n  claim, but the Federal Circuit reversed, finding violations of duties\n  imposed by the Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act of 1950, 25 U. S. C.\n  §§635(a), 638, and the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act\n  of 1977, 30 U. S. C. §1300(e), as well as common-law duties arising\n  from the Government’s “comprehensive control” over tribal coal.\nHeld: The Tribe’s claim for compensation fails. None of the sources of\n law cited by the Federal Circuit and relied upon by the Tribe provides\n any more sound a basis for its lawsuit than those analyzed in Navajo\n I. Pp. 8–14.\n    (a) Navajo I did not definitively terminate the Tribe’s claim. Be\n cause the Court in that case did not analyze statutes other than the\n IMLA, the IMDA, and §399, it is conceivable, albeit unlikely, that an\n other relevant statute might have provided a basis for the suit. How\n2                 UNITED STATES v. NAVAJO NATION\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    ever, Navajo I’s reasoning—particularly its instruction to “train on\n    specific rights-creating or duty-imposing statutory or regulatory pre\n    scriptions,” 537 U. S., at 506—left no room for that result based on\n    the sources of law relied on below. P. 8.\n       (b) Lease 8580 was not issued under §635(a), so the Tribe cannot\n    invoke that law as a source of money-mandating duties. Section\n    635(a) authorizes leases only for terms of up to 25 years, renewable\n    for up to another 25 years. In contrast, the IMLA allows “terms not\n    to exceed ten years and as long thereafter as minerals are produced\n    in paying quantities.” §396a. Mirroring the latter language, Lease\n    8580’s indefinite term strongly suggests that it was negotiated and\n    approved under the IMLA. This conclusion is not refuted by §635(a)’s\n    saving clause or by testimony that coal leasing was a centerpiece of\n    the Rehabilitation Act’s program. Pp. 8–11.\n       (c) Also unavailing is the argument that the Secretary violated\n    §638’s requirement that he follow the Tribe’s recommendations in\n    administering the “program authorized by this subchapter.” The\n    word “program” refers back to §631, which directs the Secretary to\n    undertake “a program of basic improvements for the conservation\n    and development of the [Tribe’s] resources” and lists various projects\n    to be included in the program. The statute certainly does not require\n    the Secretary to follow recommendations of the Tribe as to royalty\n    rates under coal leases executed pursuant to another Act. Pp. 11–12.\n       (d) Title 30 U. S. C. §1300(e) is irrelevant. That provision applies\n    only “[w]ith respect to leases issued after” the statute was enacted in\n    1977. Lease 8580 was issued in 1964; §1300(e) is therefore inappli\n    cable. Pp. 12–13.\n       (e) The Government’s “comprehensive control” over Indian coal,\n    alone, does not create enforceable fiduciary duties. The ITA limits\n    cognizable claims to those arising under, inter alia, “the . . . laws . . .\n    of the United States,” 28 U. S. C. §1505, and Navajo I reiterated that\n    the analysis must begin with “specific rights-creating or duty\n    imposing statutory or regulatory prescriptions,” 537 U. S., at 506. If\n    a statute or regulation imposes a trust relationship, then common\n    law principles are relevant in determining whether damages are\n    available for breach of the duty, but the Tribe cannot identify a spe\n    cific, applicable, trust-creating statute or regulation that the Gov\n    ernment violated, so trust principles do not come into play here.\n    Pp. 13–14.\n501 F. 3d 1327, reversed and remanded.\n\n   SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

NAVAJO NATION\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [April 6, 2009]\n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   For over 15 years, the Indian Tribe known as the Navajo\nNation has been pursuing a claim for money damages\nagainst the Federal Government based on an asserted\nbreach of trust by the Secretary of the Interior in connec\ntion with his approval of amendments to a coal lease\nexecuted by the Tribe. The original lease took effect in\n1964. The amendments were approved in 1987. The\nlitigation was initiated in 1993. Six years ago, we held\nthat “the Tribe’s claim for compensation . . . fails,” United\nStates v. Navajo Nation, 537 U. S. 488, 493 (2003) (Navajo\nI), but after further proceedings on remand the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit resusci\ntated it. 501 F. 3d 1327 (2007). Today we hold, once\nagain, that the Tribe’s claim for compensation fails. This\nmatter should now be regarded as closed.\n                   I. Legal Background\n   The Federal Government cannot be sued without its\nconsent. FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U. S. 471, 475 (1994). Lim\nited consent has been granted through a variety of stat\nutes, including one colloquially referred to as the Indian\nTucker Act:\n2            UNITED STATES v. NAVAJO NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n       “The United States Court of Federal Claims shall\n    have jurisdiction of any claim against the United\n    States accruing after August 13, 1946, in favor of any\n    tribe . . . whenever such claim is one arising under the\n    Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States, or\n    Executive orders of the President, or is one which oth\n    erwise would be cognizable in the Court of Federal\n    Claims if the claimant were not an Indian tribe, band\n    or group.” 28 U. S. C. §1505.\nThe last clause refers to the (ordinary) Tucker Act, which\nwaives immunity with respect to any claim “founded\neither upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or\nany regulation of an executive department, or upon any\nexpress or implied contract with the United States, or for\nliquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding\nin tort.” §1491(a)(1).\n   Neither the Tucker Act nor the Indian Tucker Act cre\nates substantive rights; they are simply jurisdictional\nprovisions that operate to waive sovereign immunity for\nclaims premised on other sources of law (e.g., statutes or\ncontracts). United States v. Testan, 424 U. S. 392, 400\n(1976); United States v. Mitchell, 445 U. S. 535, 538 (1980)\n(Mitchell I). The other source of law need not explicitly\nprovide that the right or duty it creates is enforceable\nthrough a suit for damages, but it triggers liability only if\nit “ ‘can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation\nby the Federal Government.’ ” Testan, supra, at 400 (quot\ning Eastport S. S. Corp. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ct. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">599</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n607, 372 F. 2d 1002, 1009 (1967)); see also United States v.\nMitchell, 463 U. S. 206, 218 (1983) (Mitchell II); Navajo I,\n537 U. S., at 503.\n   As we explained in Navajo I, there are thus two hurdles\nthat must be cleared before a tribe can invoke jurisdiction\nunder the Indian Tucker Act. First, the tribe “must iden\ntify a substantive source of law that establishes specific\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfiduciary or other duties, and allege that the Government\nhas failed faithfully to perform those duties.” Id., at 506.\n“If that threshold is passed, the court must then deter\nmine whether the relevant source of substantive law ‘can\nfairly be interpreted as mandating compensation for dam\nages sustained as a result of a breach of the duties [the\ngoverning law] impose[s].’ ” Ibid. (alteration in original).\nAt the second stage, principles of trust law might be rele\nvant “in drawing the inference that Congress intended\ndamages to remedy a breach.” United States v. White\nMountain Apache Tribe, 537 U. S. 465, 477 (2003).\n               II. History of the Present Case\n                         A. The Facts\n  A comprehensive recitation of the facts can be found in\nNavajo I, supra, at 495–502. By way of executive sum\nmary: The Tribe occupies a large Indian reservation in the\nAmerican Southwest, on which there are significant coal\ndeposits. In 1964 the Secretary of the Interior approved a\nlease (Lease 8580), executed by the Tribe and the prede\ncessor of Peabody Coal Company, allowing the company to\nengage in coal mining on a tract of the reservation in\nexchange for royalty payments to the Tribe. The term of\nthe lease was set at “ten (10) years from the date hereof,\nand for so long thereafter as the substances produced are\nbeing mined by the Lessee in accordance with its terms, in\npaying quantities,” App. 189; it is still in effect today. The\nroyalty rates were originally set at a maximum of 37.5\ncents per ton of coal, but the lease also said that the rates\nwere “subject to reasonable adjustment by the Secretary of\nthe Interior” after 20 years and again “at the end of each\nsuccessive ten-year period thereafter.” Id., at 194.\n  The dispute in this case concerns the Tribe’s attempt to\nsecure such an adjustment to the royalty rate after the\ninitial 20-year period elapsed in 1984. At that point, the\nTribe requested that the Secretary exercise his power to\n4            UNITED STATES v. NAVAJO NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nincrease the royalty rate, and the Director of the Bureau of\nIndian Affairs for the Navajo Area issued an opinion letter\nimposing a new rate of 20 percent of gross proceeds. Id.,\nat 8–9. But Peabody filed an administrative appeal, and\nwhile it was pending the Tribe and the company reached a\nnegotiated agreement to set a rate of 12.5 percent of gross\nproceeds instead. As a result, the Area Director’s decision\nwas vacated, the administrative appeal was dismissed,\nand the Secretary approved the amendments to the lease.\n            B. This Litigation through Navajo I\n   The Tribe launched the present lawsuit in 1993, claim\ning that the Secretary’s actions in connection with the\napproval of the lease amendments constituted a breach of\ntrust. In particular, the Tribe alleged that the Secretary,\nfollowing upon improper ex parte contacts with Peabody,\nhad delayed action on Peabody’s administrative appeal in\norder to pressure the economically desperate Tribe to\nreturn to the bargaining table. This, the complaint\ncharged, was in violation of the United States’ fiduciary\nduty to act in the Indians’ best interests. The Tribe\nsought $600 million in damages, invoking the Indian\nTucker Act to bypass sovereign immunity.\n   The Court of Federal Claims granted summary judg\nment to the United States, concluding that “the Navajo\nNation has failed to present statutory authority which can\nbe fairly interpreted as mandating compensation for the\ngovernment’s fiduciary wrongs,” Navajo Nation v. United\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 236 (2000), and therefore could not\nsue under the Indian Tucker Act. The Federal Circuit\nreversed that ruling and held that the Indian Mineral\nLeasing Act of 1938 (IMLA), 52 Stat. 347, 25 U. S. C.\n§396a et seq., among other statutes, gave the Government\nbroad control over mineral leasing on Indian lands, thus\ncreating a fiduciary duty enforceable through suits for\nmonetary damages. Navajo Nation v. United States, 263\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nF. 3d 1325, 1330–1332 (2001). Finding that the Govern\nment had in fact violated its obligations, the Court of\nAppeals reinstated the suit.\n  We granted certiorari, United States v. Navajo Nation,\n535 U. S. 1111 (2002), and (as described by the author of\nthe ensuing opinion, concurring in a companion case)\nconsidered “the threshold question” presented by the\nTribe’s attempt to invoke the Indian Tucker Act:\n“[W]hether the IMLA and its regulations impose any\nconcrete substantive obligations, fiduciary or otherwise, on\nthe Government,” White Mountain, supra, at 480\n(GINSBURG, J., concurring). The answer was an unequivo\ncal no.\n  The relevant provision of the IMLA provided as follows:\n    “[U]nallotted lands within any Indian reservation or\n    lands owned by any tribe . . . may, with the approval\n    of the Secretary of the Interior, be leased for mining\n    purposes, by authority of the tribal council or other\n    authorized spokesmen for such Indians, for terms not\n    to exceed ten years and as long thereafter as minerals\n    are produced in paying quantities.” 25 U. S. C. §396a.\nAnother provision of the IMLA authorized the Secretary to\npromulgate regulations governing operations under such\nleases, §396d, but during the relevant period the regula\ntions applicable to coal leases, beyond setting a minimum\nroyalty rate of 10 cents per ton, 25 CFR §211.15(c) (1985),\ndid not limit the Secretary’s approval authority.\n   We construed the IMLA in light of its purpose: to “en\nhance tribal self-determination by giving Tribes, not the\nGovernment, the lead role in negotiating mining leases\nwith third parties.” Navajo I, 537 U. S., at 508. Consis\ntent with that goal, the IMLA gave the Secretary not a\n“comprehensive managerial role,” id., at 507, but only the\npower to approve coal leases already negotiated by Tribes.\nThat authority did not create, expressly or otherwise, a\n6            UNITED STATES v. NAVAJO NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntrust duty with respect to coal leasing and so there existed\nno enforceable fiduciary obligations that the Tribe could\nsue the Government for having neglected. Id., at 507–508.\n   We distinguished Mitchell II, which involved a series of\nstatutes and regulations that gave the Federal Govern\nment “full responsibility to manage Indian resources and\nland for the benefit of the Indians.” 463 U. S., at 224.\nTitle 25 U. S. C. §406(a) permitted Indians to sell timber\nwith the consent of the Secretary of the Interior, but di\nrected the Secretary to base his decisions on “a considera\ntion of the needs and best interests of the Indian owner\nand his heirs” and enumerated specific factors to guide\nthat decisionmaking. We understood that statute—in\ncombination with several other provisions and the appli\ncable regulations—to create a fiduciary duty with respect\nto Indian timber. Mitchell II, supra, at 219–224. But\nneither the IMLA nor its regulations established any\nanalogous duties or obligations in the coal context. Navajo\nI, supra, at 507–508.\n   Nor did the other statutes cited by the Tribe—25\nU. S. C. §399 and the Indian Mineral Development Act of\n1982 (IMDA), 96 Stat. 1938, 25 U. S. C. §2101 et seq.—\nhelp its case. Section 399 “is not part of the IMLA and\n[did] not govern Lease 8580,” Navajo I, 537 U. S., at 509;\nrather, it granted to the Secretary the power to lease\nIndian land on his own say-so. We therefore found it\nirrelevant to the question whether “the Secretary’s more\nlimited approval role under the IMLA” created any en\nforceable duties. Ibid. And while the IMDA did set stan\ndards to govern the Secretary’s approval of other mining\nrelated agreements, Lease 8580 “falls outside the IMDA’s\ndomain,” ibid.; that law was accordingly beside the point.\n   Having resolved that “we ha[d] no warrant from any\nrelevant statute or regulation to conclude that [the Secre\ntary’s] conduct implicated a duty enforceable in an action\nfor damages under the Indian Tucker Act,” this Court\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreversed the Federal Circuit’s judgment in favor of the\nTribe and “remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.” Id., at 514.\n                  C. Proceedings on Remand\n   On remand, the Tribe argued that even if its suit could\nnot be maintained on the basis of the IMLA, the IMDA, or\n§399, a “network” of other statutes, treaties, and regula\ntions could provide the basis for its claims. The Govern\nment objected that our opinion foreclosed that possibility,\nbut the Federal Circuit disagreed and remanded for con\nsideration of the argument in the first instance. 347 F. 3d\n1327 (2003). The Court of Federal Claims, however, per\nsisted in its original decision to dismiss the Tribe’s claim,\nexplaining that nothing in the suggested “network” suc\nceeded in tying “specific laws or regulatory provisions to\nthe issue at hand,” namely, the Secretary’s approval of\nroyalty rates in coal leases negotiated by tribes. 68 Fed.\nCl. 805, 811 (2005).\n   Once again the Federal Circuit reversed, this time\nrelying primarily on three statutory provisions—two\nsections of the Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act of 1950, 64\nStat. 46, 25 U. S. C. §§635(a), 638; and one section of the\nSurface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, 30\nU. S. C. §1300(e)—to allow the Tribe’s claim to proceed.\nThe Court held that the Government had violated the\nspecific duties created by those statutes, as well as “com\nmon law trust duties of care, candor, and loyalty” that\narise from the comprehensive control over tribal coal that\nis exercised by the Government. 501 F. 3d 1327, 1346\n(2007).\n   Once again we granted the Government’s petition for a\nwrit of certiorari. 554 U. S. ___ (2008).\n8            UNITED STATES v. NAVAJO NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                        III. Analysis\n                    A. Threshold Matter\n   The Government points to our categorical concluding\nlanguage in Navajo I: “[W]e have no warrant from any\nrelevant statute or regulation to conclude that [the Secre\ntary’s] conduct implicated a duty enforceable in an action\nfor damages under the Indian Tucker Act,” 537 U. S., at\n514. This proves, the Government claims, that this Court\ndefinitively terminated the Tribe’s claim last time around,\nso that the lower court’s later resurrection of the suit was\nflatly inconsistent with our mandate. But, to be fair, our\nopinion (like the Court of Appeals decision we were re\nviewing, Navajo Nation, 263 F. 3d, at 1327, 1330–1331)\ndid not analyze any statutes beyond the IMLA, the IMDA,\nand §399. It is thus conceivable, albeit unlikely, that some\nother relevant statute, though invoked by the Tribe at the\noutset of the litigation, might have gone unmentioned by\nthe Federal Circuit and unanalyzed by this Court.\n   So we cannot say that our mandate completely fore\nclosed the possibility that such a statute might allow for\nthe Tribe to succeed on remand. What we can say, how\never, is that our reasoning in Navajo I—in particular, our\nemphasis on the need for courts to “train on specific\nrights-creating or duty-imposing statutory or regulatory\nprescriptions,” 537 U. S., at 506—left no room for that\nresult based on the sources of law that the Court of Ap\npeals relied upon.\n                    B. 25 U. S. C. §635(a)\n  The first of the two discussed provisions of the Navajo-\nHopi Rehabilitation Act of 1950—like the IMLA—permits\nIndians to lease reservation lands if the Secretary ap\nproves of the deal:\n      “Any restricted Indian lands owned by the Navajo\n    Tribe, members thereof, or associations of such mem\n    bers . . . may be leased by the Indian owners, with the\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    approval of the Secretary of the Interior, for public, re\n    ligious, educational, recreational, or business pur\n    poses, including the development or utilization of\n    natural resources in connection with operations under\n    such leases. All leases so granted shall be for a term\n    of not to exceed twenty-five years, but may include\n    provisions authorizing their renewal for an additional\n    term of not to exceed twenty-five years, and shall be\n    made under such regulations as may be prescribed by\n    the Secretary. . . . Nothing contained in this section\n    shall be construed to repeal or affect any authority to\n    lease restricted Indian lands conferred by or pursuant\n    to any other provision of law.” 25 U. S. C. §635(a).\nThe Tribe contends that this section renders the Govern\nment liable for any breach of trust in connection with the\napproval of leases executed pursuant to the authority it\ngrants. Whether or not that is so, the provision only even\narguably matters if Lease 8580 was issued under its au\nthority.\n   In Navajo I we presumed, as did the parties, that the\nlease had been issued pursuant to the IMLA. 537 U. S., at\n495. But now the Tribe has changed its tune, and con\ntends that Lease 8580 was approved under §635(a), not\nunder the IMLA at all. Brief for Respondent 39. The\nGovernment says otherwise. Section 635(a) permits leas\ning only for “public, religious, educational, recreational, or\nbusiness purposes,” and the Government contends that\nmining is not embraced by those terms. While leases\nunder §635(a) may provide for “the development or utiliza\ntion of natural resources,” they may do so only “in connec\ntion with operations under such leases,” i.e., in connection\nwith operations for the enumerated purposes. By con\ntrast, mining leases were permitted and governed by the\nIMLA even before the Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act was\nenacted in 1950.\n10           UNITED STATES v. NAVAJO NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   We need not decide whether the Government is correct\non that point, or whether mining could ever qualify as a\n“business purpose” under the statute, because the Tribe’s\nargument suffers from a more fundamental problem.\nSection 635(a) authorizes leases only for terms of up to 25\nyears, renewable for up to another 25 years. In contrast,\nthe IMLA allows “for terms not to exceed ten years and as\nlong thereafter as minerals are produced in paying quanti\nties.” 25 U. S. C. §396a. Lease 8580, mirroring the latter\nlanguage, sets a term of “ten (10) years from the date\nhereof, and for so long thereafter as the substances pro\nduced are being mined by the Lessee in accordance with\nits terms, in paying quantities.” App. 189. That indefinite\nlease term strongly suggests that it was negotiated by the\nTribe and approved by the Secretary under the powers\nauthorized by the IMLA, not the Rehabilitation Act.\n   The Tribe’s only responses to this apparently fatal\ndefect in its argument are (1) that §635(a) expressly leaves\nunaffected “any authority to lease restricted Indian lands\nconferred by or pursuant to any other provision of law,”\nincluding the authority to lease for indefinite terms; and\n(2) that Stewart Udall, who served as Secretary of the\nInterior during the 1960’s, recently testified that “coal\nleasing and related development was the centerpiece of\nthe resources development program” under the Rehabilita\ntion Act, id., at 569.\n   As to the former: That is precisely the point. Section\n635(a) creates a supplemental authority for leasing Indian\nland; it does not displace authority granted elsewhere.\nBut in light of the different conditions attached to the\ndifferent grants, it is apparent that a particular lease\nmust be executed and approved pursuant to a particular\nauthorization. The saving clause in §635(a) does not allow\nthe Tribe to mix-and-match, to combine the (allegedly)\nduty-creating mechanism of the Rehabilitation Act with\nthe indefinite lease term of the IMLA. It must be one or\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe other, and the record persuasively demonstrates that\nLease 8580 is an IMLA lease.\n   As to Secretary Udall’s testimony: That is not inconsis\ntent with our conclusion. The Interior Department may\nhave viewed coal leasing as an important part of the pro\ngram to rehabilitate the Navajo Tribe but that does not\nprove that Lease 8580 was issued pursuant to the supple\nmental leasing authority granted by the Rehabilitation\nAct, rather than the pre-existing leasing authority of the\nIMLA preserved by the Rehabilitation Act. The latter,\nperhaps because of its longer lease terms, was evidently\npreferable to the Tribe or the coal company or both.\n   Because the lease in this case “falls outside” §635(a)’s\n“domain,” Navajo I, supra, at 509, the Tribe cannot invoke\nit as a source of money-mandating rights or duties.\n                    C. 25 U. S. C. §638\n  Next, the Tribe points to a second provision in the Na\nvajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act:\n       “The Tribal Councils of the Navajo and Hopi Tribes\n    and the Indian communities affected shall be kept in\n    formed and afforded opportunity to consider from\n    their inception plans pertaining to the program au\n    thorized by this subchapter. In the administration of\n    the program, the Secretary of the Interior shall con\n    sider the recommendations of the tribal councils and\n    shall follow such recommendations whenever he\n    deems them feasible and consistent with the objec\n    tives of this subchapter.” 25 U. S. C. §638.\nIn the Tribe’s view, the Secretary violated this provision\nby failing promptly to abide by its wishes to affirm the\nArea Director’s order increasing the royalty rate under\nLease 8580 to a full 20 percent of gross proceeds.\n  We cannot agree. The “program” twice mentioned in\n§638 refers back to the Act’s opening provision, which\n12           UNITED STATES v. NAVAJO NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndirects the Secretary to undertake “a program of basic\nimprovements for the conservation and development of the\nresources of the Navajo and Hopi Indians, the more pro\nductive employment of their manpower, and the supplying\nof means to be used in their rehabilitation.” §631. The\nstatute then enumerates various projects to be included in\nthat program, and authorizes appropriation of funds (in\nspecific amounts) for each. E.g., “Soil and water conserva\ntion and range improvement work, $10,000,000.” §631(1).\n   The only listed project even remotely related to this case\nis “[s]urveys and studies of timber, coal, mineral, and\nother physical and human resources.” §631(3). Of course\na lease is neither a survey nor a study. To read §638 as\nimposing a money-mandating duty on the Secretary to\nfollow recommendations of the Tribe as to royalty rates\nunder coal leases executed pursuant to another Act, and to\nallow for the enforcement of that duty through the Indian\nTucker Act, would simply be too far a stretch.\n                  D. 30 U. S. C. §1201 et seq.\n  The final statute invoked by the Tribe is the most easily\ndispensed with. The Surface Mining Control and Recla\nmation Act of 1977 (SMCRA), 91 Stat. 445, 30 U. S. C.\n§1201 et seq., is a comprehensive statute that regulates all\nsurface coal mining operations. See generally §1202;\nHodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn.,\nInc., 452 U. S. 264, 268–272 (1981). One section of the\nAct, §1300, deals with coal mining specifically on Indian\nlands, and the Tribe cites subsection (e): “With respect to\nleases issued after [the date of enactment of this Act], the\nSecretary shall include and enforce terms and conditions\nin addition to those required by subsections (c) and (d) of\nthis section as may be requested by the Indian tribe in\nsuch leases.”\n  According to the Tribe, this provision requires the Sec\nretary to enforce whatever terms the Indians request with\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrespect to coal leases. In light of the fact that the refer\nenced subsections (c) and (d) refer exclusively to environ\nmental protection standards, that interpretation is highly\nsuspect. In any event, because Lease 8580 was issued in\n1964—some 13 years before the date of enactment of the\nSMCRA—the provision is categorically inapplicable. The\nFederal Circuit concluded otherwise on the theory that the\namendments to the lease were approved after 1977. But\n§1300(e) is limited to leases “issued” after that date; and\neven the Tribe does not contend that a lease is “issued”\nwhenever it is amended. The SMCRA is irrelevant here.\n    E. Government’s “Comprehensive Control” over Coal\n   The Federal Circuit’s opinion also suggested that the\nGovernment’s “comprehensive control” over coal on Indian\nland gives rise to fiduciary duties based on common-law\ntrust principles. It noted that the Government had con\nducted surveys and studies of the Tribe’s coal resources,\n501 F. 3d, at 1341; that the Interior Department imposed\nvarious requirements on coal mining operations on Indian\nland—regulating, for example, “signs and markers, post\nmining use of land, backfilling and grading, waste dis\nposal, topsoil handling, protection of hydrologic systems,\nrevegetation, and steep-slope mining,” id., at 1342; and\nthat the Government in practice exercised control over the\ncalculation of coal values and quantities for royalty pur\nposes, even though such control was codified by regulation\nonly after the events at issue here, id., at 1342–1343.\n   The Federal Government’s liability cannot be premised\non control alone. The text of the Indian Tucker Act makes\nclear that only claims arising under “the Constitution,\nlaws or treaties of the United States, or Executive orders\nof the President” are cognizable (unless the claim could be\nbrought by a non-Indian plaintiff under the ordinary\nTucker Act). 28 U. S. C. §1505. In Navajo I we reiterated\nthat the analysis must begin with “specific rights-creating\n14           UNITED STATES v. NAVAJO NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nor duty-imposing statutory or regulatory prescriptions.”\n537 U. S., at 506. If a plaintiff identifies such a prescrip\ntion, and if that prescription bears the hallmarks of a\n“conventional fiduciary relationship,” White Mountain, 537\nU. S., at 473, then trust principles (including any such\nprinciples premised on “control”) could play a role in “in\nferring that the trust obligation [is] enforceable by dam\nages,” id., at 477. But that must be the second step of the\nanalysis, not (as the Federal Circuit made it) the starting\npoint.\n   Navajo I determined that the IMLA, which governs the\nlease at issue here, does not create even a “ ‘limited trust\nrelationship’ ” with respect to coal leasing. Navajo I, su\npra, at 508 (quoting Mitchell I, 445 U. S., at 542). Since\nthe statutes discussed in the preceding subparts, supra, at\n8–13, do not apply to the lease at all, they likewise create\nno such relationship. Because the Tribe cannot identify a\nspecific, applicable, trust-creating statute or regulation\nthat the Government violated, we do not reach the ques\ntion whether the trust duty was money mandating. Thus,\nneither the Government’s “control” over coal nor common\nlaw trust principles matter.\n                        *    *    *\n  None of the sources of law cited by the Federal Circuit\nand relied upon by the Tribe provides any more sound a\nbasis for its breach-of-trust lawsuit against the Federal\nGovernment than those we analyzed in Navajo I. This\ncase is at an end. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\nreversed, and the case is remanded with instructions to\naffirm the Court of Federal Claims’ dismissal of the Tribe’s\ncomplaint.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

NAVAJO NATION\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 07–1410. Argued February 23, 2009—Decided April 6, 2009\nThe Navajo Nation has long sought damages under the Indian Tucker\n  Act (ITA) for an asserted breach of fiduciary duty by the Secretary of\n  the Interior in connection with his failure promptly to approve a roy\n  alty rate increase under a coal lease (Lease 8580) the Tribe executed\n  in 1964. Six years ago, this Court held that “the Tribe’s claim for\n  compensation . . . fails.” United States v. Navajo Nation, 537 U. S.\n  488, 493 (Navajo I). The Court explained that in order to invoke the\n  ITA and thereby bypass federal sovereign immunity, a tribe “must\n  identify a substantive source of law that establishes specific fiduciary\n  or other duties, and allege that the Government has failed faithfully\n  to perform those duties.” Id., at 506. Holding that such duties were\n  not imposed by the Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938 (IMLA), by\n  the Indian Mineral Development Act of 1982 (IMDA), or by 25\n  U. S. C. §399, the Court reversed a judgment for the Tribe and re\n  manded. The Court of Federal Claims then dismissed the Tribe’s\n  claim, but the Federal Circuit reversed, finding violations of duties\n  imposed by the Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act of 1950, 25 U. S. C.\n  §§635(a), 638, and the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act\n  of 1977, 30 U. S. C. §1300(e), as well as common-law duties arising\n  from the Government’s “comprehensive control” over tribal coal.\nHeld: The Tribe’s claim for compensation fails. None of the sources of\n law cited by the Federal Circuit and relied upon by the Tribe provides\n any more sound a basis for its lawsuit than those analyzed in Navajo\n I. Pp. 8–14.\n    (a) Navajo I did not definitively terminate the Tribe’s claim. Be\n cause the Court in that case did not analyze statutes other than the\n IMLA, the IMDA, and §399, it is conceivable, albeit unlikely, that an\n other relevant statute might have provided a basis for the suit. How\n2                 UNITED STATES v. NAVAJO NATION\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    ever, Navajo I’s reasoning—particularly its instruction to “train on\n    specific rights-creating or duty-imposing statutory or regulatory pre\n    scriptions,” 537 U. S., at 506—left no room for that result based on\n    the sources of law relied on below. P. 8.\n       (b) Lease 8580 was not issued under §635(a), so the Tribe cannot\n    invoke that law as a source of money-mandating duties. Section\n    635(a) authorizes leases only for terms of up to 25 years, renewable\n    for up to another 25 years. In contrast, the IMLA allows “terms not\n    to exceed ten years and as long thereafter as minerals are produced\n    in paying quantities.” §396a. Mirroring the latter language, Lease\n    8580’s indefinite term strongly suggests that it was negotiated and\n    approved under the IMLA. This conclusion is not refuted by §635(a)’s\n    saving clause or by testimony that coal leasing was a centerpiece of\n    the Rehabilitation Act’s program. Pp. 8–11.\n       (c) Also unavailing is the argument that the Secretary violated\n    §638’s requirement that he follow the Tribe’s recommendations in\n    administering the “program authorized by this subchapter.” The\n    word “program” refers back to §631, which directs the Secretary to\n    undertake “a program of basic improvements for the conservation\n    and development of the [Tribe’s] resources” and lists various projects\n    to be included in the program. The statute certainly does not require\n    the Secretary to follow recommendations of the Tribe as to royalty\n    rates under coal leases executed pursuant to another Act. Pp. 11–12.\n       (d) Title 30 U. S. C. §1300(e) is irrelevant. That provision applies\n    only “[w]ith respect to leases issued after” the statute was enacted in\n    1977. Lease 8580 was issued in 1964; §1300(e) is therefore inappli\n    cable. Pp. 12–13.\n       (e) The Government’s “comprehensive control” over Indian coal,\n    alone, does not create enforceable fiduciary duties. The ITA limits\n    cognizable claims to those arising under, inter alia, “the . . . laws . . .\n    of the United States,” 28 U. S. C. §1505, and Navajo I reiterated that\n    the analysis must begin with “specific rights-creating or duty\n    imposing statutory or regulatory prescriptions,” 537 U. S., at 506. If\n    a statute or regulation imposes a trust relationship, then common\n    law principles are relevant in determining whether damages are\n    available for breach of the duty, but the Tribe cannot identify a spe\n    cific, applicable, trust-creating statute or regulation that the Gov\n    ernment violated, so trust principles do not come into play here.\n    Pp. 13–14.\n501 F. 3d 1327, reversed and remanded.\n\n   SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

The original lease took effect in\n1964. The amendments were approved in 1987. The\nlitigation was initiated in 1993. Six years ago, we held\nthat “the Tribe’s claim for compensation . . . fails,” United\nStates v. Navajo Nation, 537 U. S. 488, 493 (2003) (Navajo\nI), but after further proceedings on remand the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit resusci\ntated it. 501 F. 3d 1327 (2007). Today we hold, once\nagain, that the Tribe’s claim for compensation fails. This\nmatter should now be regarded as closed.\n                   I. Legal Background\n   The Federal Government cannot be sued without its\nconsent. FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U. S. 471, 475 (1994). Lim\nited consent has been granted through a variety of stat\nutes, including one colloquially referred to as the Indian\nTucker Act:\n2            UNITED STATES v. NAVAJO NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n       “The United States Court of Federal Claims shall\n    have jurisdiction of any claim against the United\n    States accruing after August 13, 1946, in favor of any\n    tribe . . . whenever such claim is one arising under the\n    Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States, or\n    Executive orders of the President, or is one which oth\n    erwise would be cognizable in the Court of Federal\n    Claims if the claimant were not an Indian tribe, band\n    or group.” 28 U. S. C. §1505.\nThe last clause refers to the (ordinary) Tucker Act, which\nwaives immunity with respect to any claim “founded\neither upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or\nany regulation of an executive department, or upon any\nexpress or implied contract with the United States, or for\nliquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding\nin tort.” §1491(a)(1).\n   Neither the Tucker Act nor the Indian Tucker Act cre\nates substantive rights; they are simply jurisdictional\nprovisions that operate to waive sovereign immunity for\nclaims premised on other sources of law (e.g., statutes or\ncontracts). United States v. Testan, 424 U. S. 392, 400\n(1976); United States v. Mitchell, 445 U. S. 535, 538 (1980)\n(Mitchell I). The other source of law need not explicitly\nprovide that the right or duty it creates is enforceable\nthrough a suit for damages, but it triggers liability only if\nit “ ‘can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation\nby the Federal Government.’ ” Testan, supra, at 400 (quot\ning Eastport S. S. Corp. v. United States, 178 Ct. Cl. 599,\n607, 372 F. 2d 1002, 1009 (1967)); see also United States v.\nMitchell, 463 U. S. 206, 218 (1983) (Mitchell II); Navajo I,\n537 U. S., at 503.\n   As we explained in Navajo I, there are thus two hurdles\nthat must be cleared before a tribe can invoke jurisdiction\nunder the Indian Tucker Act. First, the tribe “must iden\ntify a substantive source of law that establishes specific\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfiduciary or other duties, and allege that the Government\nhas failed faithfully to perform those duties.” Id., at 506.\n“If that threshold is passed, the court must then deter\nmine whether the relevant source of substantive law ‘can\nfairly be interpreted as mandating compensation for dam\nages sustained as a result of a breach of the duties [the\ngoverning law] impose[s].’ ” Ibid. (alteration in original).\nAt the second stage, principles of trust law might be rele\nvant “in drawing the inference that Congress intended\ndamages to remedy a breach.” United States v. White\nMountain Apache Tribe, 537 U. S. 465, 477 (2003).\n               II. History of the Present Case\n                         A. The Facts\n  A comprehensive recitation of the facts can be found in\nNavajo I, supra, at 495–502. By way of executive sum\nmary: The Tribe occupies a large Indian reservation in the\nAmerican Southwest, on which there are significant coal\ndeposits. In 1964 the Secretary of the Interior approved a\nlease (Lease 8580), executed by the Tribe and the prede\ncessor of Peabody Coal Company, allowing the company to\nengage in coal mining on a tract of the reservation in\nexchange for royalty payments to the Tribe. The term of\nthe lease was set at “ten (10) years from the date hereof,\nand for so long thereafter as the substances produced are\nbeing mined by the Lessee in accordance with its terms, in\npaying quantities,” App. 189; it is still in effect today. The\nroyalty rates were originally set at a maximum of 37.5\ncents per ton of coal, but the lease also said that the rates\nwere “subject to reasonable adjustment by the Secretary of\nthe Interior” after 20 years and again “at the end of each\nsuccessive ten-year period thereafter.” Id., at 194.\n  The dispute in this case concerns the Tribe’s attempt to\nsecure such an adjustment to the royalty rate after the\ninitial 20-year period elapsed in 1984. At that point, the\nTribe requested that the Secretary exercise his power to\n4            UNITED STATES v. NAVAJO NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nincrease the royalty rate, and the Director of the Bureau of\nIndian Affairs for the Navajo Area issued an opinion letter\nimposing a new rate of 20 percent of gross proceeds. Id.,\nat 8–9. But Peabody filed an administrative appeal, and\nwhile it was pending the Tribe and the company reached a\nnegotiated agreement to set a rate of 12.5 percent of gross\nproceeds instead. As a result, the Area Director’s decision\nwas vacated, the administrative appeal was dismissed,\nand the Secretary approved the amendments to the lease.\n            B. This Litigation through Navajo I\n   The Tribe launched the present lawsuit in 1993, claim\ning that the Secretary’s actions in connection with the\napproval of the lease amendments constituted a breach of\ntrust. In particular, the Tribe alleged that the Secretary,\nfollowing upon improper ex parte contacts with Peabody,\nhad delayed action on Peabody’s administrative appeal in\norder to pressure the economically desperate Tribe to\nreturn to the bargaining table. This, the complaint\ncharged, was in violation of the United States’ fiduciary\nduty to act in the Indians’ best interests. The Tribe\nsought $600 million in damages, invoking the Indian\nTucker Act to bypass sovereign immunity.\n   The Court of Federal Claims granted summary judg\nment to the United States, concluding that “the Navajo\nNation has failed to present statutory authority which can\nbe fairly interpreted as mandating compensation for the\ngovernment’s fiduciary wrongs,” Navajo Nation v. United\nStates, 46 Fed. Cl. 217, 236 (2000), and therefore could not\nsue under the Indian Tucker Act. The Federal Circuit\nreversed that ruling and held that the Indian Mineral\nLeasing Act of 1938 (IMLA), 52 Stat. 347, 25 U. S. C.\n§396a et seq., among other statutes, gave the Government\nbroad control over mineral leasing on Indian lands, thus\ncreating a fiduciary duty enforceable through suits for\nmonetary damages. Navajo Nation v. United States, 263\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nF. 3d 1325, 1330–1332 (2001). Finding that the Govern\nment had in fact violated its obligations, the Court of\nAppeals reinstated the suit.\n  We granted certiorari, United States v. Navajo Nation,\n535 U. S. 1111 (2002), and (as described by the author of\nthe ensuing opinion, concurring in a companion case)\nconsidered “the threshold question” presented by the\nTribe’s attempt to invoke the Indian Tucker Act:\n“[W]hether the IMLA and its regulations impose any\nconcrete substantive obligations, fiduciary or otherwise, on\nthe Government,” White Mountain, supra, at 480\n(GINSBURG, J., concurring). The answer was an unequivo\ncal no.\n  The relevant provision of the IMLA provided as follows:\n    “[U]nallotted lands within any Indian reservation or\n    lands owned by any tribe . . . may, with the approval\n    of the Secretary of the Interior, be leased for mining\n    purposes, by authority of the tribal council or other\n    authorized spokesmen for such Indians, for terms not\n    to exceed ten years and as long thereafter as minerals\n    are produced in paying quantities.” 25 U. S. C. §396a.\nAnother provision of the IMLA authorized the Secretary to\npromulgate regulations governing operations under such\nleases, §396d, but during the relevant period the regula\ntions applicable to coal leases, beyond setting a minimum\nroyalty rate of 10 cents per ton, 25 CFR §211.15(c) (1985),\ndid not limit the Secretary’s approval authority.\n   We construed the IMLA in light of its purpose: to “en\nhance tribal self-determination by giving Tribes, not the\nGovernment, the lead role in negotiating mining leases\nwith third parties.” Navajo I, 537 U. S., at 508. Consis\ntent with that goal, the IMLA gave the Secretary not a\n“comprehensive managerial role,” id., at 507, but only the\npower to approve coal leases already negotiated by Tribes.\nThat authority did not create, expressly or otherwise, a\n6            UNITED STATES v. NAVAJO NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntrust duty with respect to coal leasing and so there existed\nno enforceable fiduciary obligations that the Tribe could\nsue the Government for having neglected. Id., at 507–508.\n   We distinguished Mitchell II, which involved a series of\nstatutes and regulations that gave the Federal Govern\nment “full responsibility to manage Indian resources and\nland for the benefit of the Indians.” 463 U. S., at 224.\nTitle 25 U. S. C. §406(a) permitted Indians to sell timber\nwith the consent of the Secretary of the Interior, but di\nrected the Secretary to base his decisions on “a considera\ntion of the needs and best interests of the Indian owner\nand his heirs” and enumerated specific factors to guide\nthat decisionmaking. We understood that statute—in\ncombination with several other provisions and the appli\ncable regulations—to create a fiduciary duty with respect\nto Indian timber. Mitchell II, supra, at 219–224. But\nneither the IMLA nor its regulations established any\nanalogous duties or obligations in the coal context. Navajo\nI, supra, at 507–508.\n   Nor did the other statutes cited by the Tribe—25\nU. S. C. §399 and the Indian Mineral Development Act of\n1982 (IMDA), 96 Stat. 1938, 25 U. S. C. §2101 et seq.—\nhelp its case. Section 399 “is not part of the IMLA and\n[did] not govern Lease 8580,” Navajo I, 537 U. S., at 509;\nrather, it granted to the Secretary the power to lease\nIndian land on his own say-so. We therefore found it\nirrelevant to the question whether “the Secretary’s more\nlimited approval role under the IMLA” created any en\nforceable duties. Ibid. And while the IMDA did set stan\ndards to govern the Secretary’s approval of other mining\nrelated agreements, Lease 8580 “falls outside the IMDA’s\ndomain,” ibid.; that law was accordingly beside the point.\n   Having resolved that “we ha[d] no warrant from any\nrelevant statute or regulation to conclude that [the Secre\ntary’s] conduct implicated a duty enforceable in an action\nfor damages under the Indian Tucker Act,” this Court\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreversed the Federal Circuit’s judgment in favor of the\nTribe and “remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.” Id., at 514.\n                  C. Proceedings on Remand\n   On remand, the Tribe argued that even if its suit could\nnot be maintained on the basis of the IMLA, the IMDA, or\n§399, a “network” of other statutes, treaties, and regula\ntions could provide the basis for its claims. The Govern\nment objected that our opinion foreclosed that possibility,\nbut the Federal Circuit disagreed and remanded for con\nsideration of the argument in the first instance. 347 F. 3d\n1327 (2003). The Court of Federal Claims, however, per\nsisted in its original decision to dismiss the Tribe’s claim,\nexplaining that nothing in the suggested “network” suc\nceeded in tying “specific laws or regulatory provisions to\nthe issue at hand,” namely, the Secretary’s approval of\nroyalty rates in coal leases negotiated by tribes. 68 Fed.\nCl. 805, 811 (2005).\n   Once again the Federal Circuit reversed, this time\nrelying primarily on three statutory provisions—two\nsections of the Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act of 1950, 64\nStat. 46, 25 U. S. C. §§635(a), 638; and one section of the\nSurface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, 30\nU. S. C. §1300(e)—to allow the Tribe’s claim to proceed.\nThe Court held that the Government had violated the\nspecific duties created by those statutes, as well as “com\nmon law trust duties of care, candor, and loyalty” that\narise from the comprehensive control over tribal coal that\nis exercised by the Government. 501 F. 3d 1327, 1346\n(2007).\n   Once again we granted the Government’s petition for a\nwrit of certiorari. 554 U. S. ___ (2008).\n8            UNITED STATES v. NAVAJO NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                        III. Analysis\n                    A. Threshold Matter\n   The Government points to our categorical concluding\nlanguage in Navajo I: “[W]e have no warrant from any\nrelevant statute or regulation to conclude that [the Secre\ntary’s] conduct implicated a duty enforceable in an action\nfor damages under the Indian Tucker Act,” 537 U. S., at\n514. This proves, the Government claims, that this Court\ndefinitively terminated the Tribe’s claim last time around,\nso that the lower court’s later resurrection of the suit was\nflatly inconsistent with our mandate. But, to be fair, our\nopinion (like the Court of Appeals decision we were re\nviewing, Navajo Nation, 263 F. 3d, at 1327, 1330–1331)\ndid not analyze any statutes beyond the IMLA, the IMDA,\nand §399. It is thus conceivable, albeit unlikely, that some\nother relevant statute, though invoked by the Tribe at the\noutset of the litigation, might have gone unmentioned by\nthe Federal Circuit and unanalyzed by this Court.\n   So we cannot say that our mandate completely fore\nclosed the possibility that such a statute might allow for\nthe Tribe to succeed on remand. What we can say, how\never, is that our reasoning in Navajo I—in particular, our\nemphasis on the need for courts to “train on specific\nrights-creating or duty-imposing statutory or regulatory\nprescriptions,” 537 U. S., at 506—left no room for that\nresult based on the sources of law that the Court of Ap\npeals relied upon.\n                    B. 25 U. S. C. §635(a)\n  The first of the two discussed provisions of the Navajo-\nHopi Rehabilitation Act of 1950—like the IMLA—permits\nIndians to lease reservation lands if the Secretary ap\nproves of the deal:\n      “Any restricted Indian lands owned by the Navajo\n    Tribe, members thereof, or associations of such mem\n    bers . . . may be leased by the Indian owners, with the\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    approval of the Secretary of the Interior, for public, re\n    ligious, educational, recreational, or business pur\n    poses, including the development or utilization of\n    natural resources in connection with operations under\n    such leases. All leases so granted shall be for a term\n    of not to exceed twenty-five years, but may include\n    provisions authorizing their renewal for an additional\n    term of not to exceed twenty-five years, and shall be\n    made under such regulations as may be prescribed by\n    the Secretary. . . . Nothing contained in this section\n    shall be construed to repeal or affect any authority to\n    lease restricted Indian lands conferred by or pursuant\n    to any other provision of law.” 25 U. S. C. §635(a).\nThe Tribe contends that this section renders the Govern\nment liable for any breach of trust in connection with the\napproval of leases executed pursuant to the authority it\ngrants. Whether or not that is so, the provision only even\narguably matters if Lease 8580 was issued under its au\nthority.\n   In Navajo I we presumed, as did the parties, that the\nlease had been issued pursuant to the IMLA. 537 U. S., at\n495. But now the Tribe has changed its tune, and con\ntends that Lease 8580 was approved under §635(a), not\nunder the IMLA at all. Brief for Respondent 39. The\nGovernment says otherwise. Section 635(a) permits leas\ning only for “public, religious, educational, recreational, or\nbusiness purposes,” and the Government contends that\nmining is not embraced by those terms. While leases\nunder §635(a) may provide for “the development or utiliza\ntion of natural resources,” they may do so only “in connec\ntion with operations under such leases,” i.e., in connection\nwith operations for the enumerated purposes. By con\ntrast, mining leases were permitted and governed by the\nIMLA even before the Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act was\nenacted in 1950.\n10           UNITED STATES v. NAVAJO NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   We need not decide whether the Government is correct\non that point, or whether mining could ever qualify as a\n“business purpose” under the statute, because the Tribe’s\nargument suffers from a more fundamental problem.\nSection 635(a) authorizes leases only for terms of up to 25\nyears, renewable for up to another 25 years. In contrast,\nthe IMLA allows “for terms not to exceed ten years and as\nlong thereafter as minerals are produced in paying quanti\nties.” 25 U. S. C. §396a. Lease 8580, mirroring the latter\nlanguage, sets a term of “ten (10) years from the date\nhereof, and for so long thereafter as the substances pro\nduced are being mined by the Lessee in accordance with\nits terms, in paying quantities.” App. 189. That indefinite\nlease term strongly suggests that it was negotiated by the\nTribe and approved by the Secretary under the powers\nauthorized by the IMLA, not the Rehabilitation Act.\n   The Tribe’s only responses to this apparently fatal\ndefect in its argument are (1) that §635(a) expressly leaves\nunaffected “any authority to lease restricted Indian lands\nconferred by or pursuant to any other provision of law,”\nincluding the authority to lease for indefinite terms; and\n(2) that Stewart Udall, who served as Secretary of the\nInterior during the 1960’s, recently testified that “coal\nleasing and related development was the centerpiece of\nthe resources development program” under the Rehabilita\ntion Act, id., at 569.\n   As to the former: That is precisely the point. Section\n635(a) creates a supplemental authority for leasing Indian\nland; it does not displace authority granted elsewhere.\nBut in light of the different conditions attached to the\ndifferent grants, it is apparent that a particular lease\nmust be executed and approved pursuant to a particular\nauthorization. The saving clause in §635(a) does not allow\nthe Tribe to mix-and-match, to combine the (allegedly)\nduty-creating mechanism of the Rehabilitation Act with\nthe indefinite lease term of the IMLA. It must be one or\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe other, and the record persuasively demonstrates that\nLease 8580 is an IMLA lease.\n   As to Secretary Udall’s testimony: That is not inconsis\ntent with our conclusion. The Interior Department may\nhave viewed coal leasing as an important part of the pro\ngram to rehabilitate the Navajo Tribe but that does not\nprove that Lease 8580 was issued pursuant to the supple\nmental leasing authority granted by the Rehabilitation\nAct, rather than the pre-existing leasing authority of the\nIMLA preserved by the Rehabilitation Act. The latter,\nperhaps because of its longer lease terms, was evidently\npreferable to the Tribe or the coal company or both.\n   Because the lease in this case “falls outside” §635(a)’s\n“domain,” Navajo I, supra, at 509, the Tribe cannot invoke\nit as a source of money-mandating rights or duties.\n                    C. 25 U. S. C. §638\n  Next, the Tribe points to a second provision in the Na\nvajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act:\n       “The Tribal Councils of the Navajo and Hopi Tribes\n    and the Indian communities affected shall be kept in\n    formed and afforded opportunity to consider from\n    their inception plans pertaining to the program au\n    thorized by this subchapter. In the administration of\n    the program, the Secretary of the Interior shall con\n    sider the recommendations of the tribal councils and\n    shall follow such recommendations whenever he\n    deems them feasible and consistent with the objec\n    tives of this subchapter.” 25 U. S. C. §638.\nIn the Tribe’s view, the Secretary violated this provision\nby failing promptly to abide by its wishes to affirm the\nArea Director’s order increasing the royalty rate under\nLease 8580 to a full 20 percent of gross proceeds.\n  We cannot agree. The “program” twice mentioned in\n§638 refers back to the Act’s opening provision, which\n12           UNITED STATES v. NAVAJO NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndirects the Secretary to undertake “a program of basic\nimprovements for the conservation and development of the\nresources of the Navajo and Hopi Indians, the more pro\nductive employment of their manpower, and the supplying\nof means to be used in their rehabilitation.” §631. The\nstatute then enumerates various projects to be included in\nthat program, and authorizes appropriation of funds (in\nspecific amounts) for each. E.g., “Soil and water conserva\ntion and range improvement work, $10,000,000.” §631(1).\n   The only listed project even remotely related to this case\nis “[s]urveys and studies of timber, coal, mineral, and\nother physical and human resources.” §631(3). Of course\na lease is neither a survey nor a study. To read §638 as\nimposing a money-mandating duty on the Secretary to\nfollow recommendations of the Tribe as to royalty rates\nunder coal leases executed pursuant to another Act, and to\nallow for the enforcement of that duty through the Indian\nTucker Act, would simply be too far a stretch.\n                  D. 30 U. S. C. §1201 et seq.\n  The final statute invoked by the Tribe is the most easily\ndispensed with. The Surface Mining Control and Recla\nmation Act of 1977 (SMCRA), 91 Stat. 445, 30 U. S. C.\n§1201 et seq., is a comprehensive statute that regulates all\nsurface coal mining operations. See generally §1202;\nHodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn.,\nInc., 452 U. S. 264, 268–272 (1981). One section of the\nAct, §1300, deals with coal mining specifically on Indian\nlands, and the Tribe cites subsection (e): “With respect to\nleases issued after [the date of enactment of this Act], the\nSecretary shall include and enforce terms and conditions\nin addition to those required by subsections (c) and (d) of\nthis section as may be requested by the Indian tribe in\nsuch leases.”\n  According to the Tribe, this provision requires the Sec\nretary to enforce whatever terms the Indians request with\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrespect to coal leases. In light of the fact that the refer\nenced subsections (c) and (d) refer exclusively to environ\nmental protection standards, that interpretation is highly\nsuspect. In any event, because Lease 8580 was issued in\n1964—some 13 years before the date of enactment of the\nSMCRA—the provision is categorically inapplicable. The\nFederal Circuit concluded otherwise on the theory that the\namendments to the lease were approved after 1977. But\n§1300(e) is limited to leases “issued” after that date; and\neven the Tribe does not contend that a lease is “issued”\nwhenever it is amended. The SMCRA is irrelevant here.\n    E. Government’s “Comprehensive Control” over Coal\n   The Federal Circuit’s opinion also suggested that the\nGovernment’s “comprehensive control” over coal on Indian\nland gives rise to fiduciary duties based on common-law\ntrust principles. It noted that the Government had con\nducted surveys and studies of the Tribe’s coal resources,\n501 F. 3d, at 1341; that the Interior Department imposed\nvarious requirements on coal mining operations on Indian\nland—regulating, for example, “signs and markers, post\nmining use of land, backfilling and grading, waste dis\nposal, topsoil handling, protection of hydrologic systems,\nrevegetation, and steep-slope mining,” id., at 1342; and\nthat the Government in practice exercised control over the\ncalculation of coal values and quantities for royalty pur\nposes, even though such control was codified by regulation\nonly after the events at issue here, id., at 1342–1343.\n   The Federal Government’s liability cannot be premised\non control alone. The text of the Indian Tucker Act makes\nclear that only claims arising under “the Constitution,\nlaws or treaties of the United States, or Executive orders\nof the President” are cognizable (unless the claim could be\nbrought by a non-Indian plaintiff under the ordinary\nTucker Act). 28 U. S. C. §1505. In Navajo I we reiterated\nthat the analysis must begin with “specific rights-creating\n14           UNITED STATES v. NAVAJO NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nor duty-imposing statutory or regulatory prescriptions.”\n537 U. S., at 506. If a plaintiff identifies such a prescrip\ntion, and if that prescription bears the hallmarks of a\n“conventional fiduciary relationship,” White Mountain, 537\nU. S., at 473, then trust principles (including any such\nprinciples premised on “control”) could play a role in “in\nferring that the trust obligation [is] enforceable by dam\nages,” id., at 477. But that must be the second step of the\nanalysis, not (as the Federal Circuit made it) the starting\npoint.\n   Navajo I determined that the IMLA, which governs the\nlease at issue here, does not create even a “ ‘limited trust\nrelationship’ ” with respect to coal leasing. Navajo I, su\npra, at 508 (quoting Mitchell I, 445 U. S., at 542). Since\nthe statutes discussed in the preceding subparts, supra, at\n8–13, do not apply to the lease at all, they likewise create\nno such relationship. Because the Tribe cannot identify a\nspecific, applicable, trust-creating statute or regulation\nthat the Government violated, we do not reach the ques\ntion whether the trust duty was money mandating. Thus,\nneither the Government’s “control” over coal nor common\nlaw trust principles matter.\n                        *    *    *\n  None of the sources of law cited by the Federal Circuit\nand relied upon by the Tribe provides any more sound a\nbasis for its breach-of-trust lawsuit against the Federal\nGovernment than those we analyzed in Navajo I. This\ncase is at an end. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\nreversed, and the case is remanded with instructions to\naffirm the Court of Federal Claims’ dismissal of the Tribe’s\ncomplaint.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.
