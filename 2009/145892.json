BELL, WARDEN\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 07–8521. Argued January 12, 2009—Decided April 1, 2009\nAfter the Tennessee state courts rejected petitioner Harbison’s convic\n  tion and death sentence challenges, the Federal District Court ap\n  pointed a federal public defender to represent him in filing a habeas\n  petition under 28 U. S. C. §2254. That petition was denied. Harbi\n  son then sought appointment of counsel for state clemency proceed\n  ings. Because Tennessee law no longer authorizes the appointment\n  of state public defenders as clemency counsel, his federal counsel\n  moved to expand the scope of her representation to include the state\n  proceedings. In denying the motion, the District Court relied on Cir\n  cuit precedent construing 18 U. S. C. §3599, which provides for the\n  appointment of federal counsel. The Sixth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. A certificate of appealability pursuant to 28 U. S. C.\n §2253(c)(1)(A) is not required to appeal an order denying a request\n for federally appointed counsel under §3599 because §2253(c)(1)(A)\n governs only final orders that dispose of a habeas corpus proceeding’s\n merits. Pp. 2–3.\n    2. Section 3599 authorizes federally appointed counsel to represent\n their clients in state clemency proceedings and entitles them to com\n pensation for that representation. Pp. 3–14.\n       (a) Section 3599(a)(2), which refers to both §2254 and §2255 pro\n ceedings, triggers the appointment of counsel for both state and fed\n eral postconviction litigants, and §3599(e) governs the scope of ap\n pointed counsel’s duties. Thus, federally funded counsel appointed to\n represent a state prisoner in §2254 proceedings “shall also represent\n the defendant in such . . . proceedings for executive or other clemency\n as may be available to the defendant.” §3599(e). Because state clem\n ency proceedings are “available” to state petitioners who obtain sub\n2                           HARBISON v. BELL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    section (a)(2) representation, the statute’s plain language indicates\n    that appointed counsel’s authorized representation includes such\n    proceedings. Moreover, subsection (e)’s reference to “proceedings for\n    . . . other clemency” refers to state proceedings, as federal clemency is\n    exclusively executive, while States administer clemency in various\n    ways. The Government is correct that appointed counsel is not ex\n    pected to provide each service enumerated in subsection (e) for every\n    client. Rather, counsel’s representation includes only those judicial\n    proceedings transpiring “subsequent” to her appointment, which un\n    der subsection (a)(2) begins with the §2254 or §2255 “post-conviction\n    process.” Pp. 3–8.\n           (b) The Government’s attempts to overcome §3599’s plain lan\n    guage are not persuasive. First, our reading of the statute does not\n    produce absurd results. Contrary to the Government’s contention, a\n    lawyer is not required to represent her client during a state retrial\n    following postconviction relief because the retrial marks the com\n    mencement of new judicial proceedings, not a subsequent stage of ex\n    isting proceedings; state postconviction proceedings are also not “sub\n    sequent” to federal habeas proceedings. Second, the legislative\n    history does not support the Government's argument that Congress\n    intended §3599 to apply only to federal defendants. Congress’ deci\n    sion to furnish counsel for state clemency proceedings reflects both\n    clemency’s role as the “ ‘fail safe’ of our criminal justice system,”\n    Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.

In 1997, after the\nstate courts rejected challenges to his conviction and\nsentence, the Federal District Court appointed the Federal\nDefender Services of Eastern Tennessee to represent him\nin filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to\n28 U. S. C. §2254.1 During the course of that representa\ntion, counsel developed substantial evidence relating both\nto Harbison’s culpability and to the appropriateness of his\nsentence. Although the courts did not order relief, the\nevidence proved persuasive to one Circuit Judge. See 408\nF. 3d 823, 837–846 (CA6 2005) (Clay, J., dissenting).\n   Shortly after his habeas corpus petition was denied,\nHarbison requested counsel for state clemency proceed\nings. In 2006, the Tennessee Supreme Court held that\nstate law does not authorize the appointment of state\npublic defenders as clemency counsel. State v. Johnson,\n——————\n  1 Federal Defender Services of Eastern Tennessee is a nonprofit or\n\nganization established pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, 18\nU. S. C. §3006A(g)(2)(B).\n2                   HARBISON v. BELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nNo. M1987–00072–SC–DPE–DD (per curiam), 2006 Tenn.\nLexis 1236, at *3 (2006). Thereafter, Harbison’s federally\nappointed counsel moved to expand the authorized scope\nof her representation to include state clemency proceed\nings. Relying on Circuit precedent construing 18 U. S. C.\n§3599, which provides for the appointment of federal\ncounsel, the District Court denied the motion, and the\nCourt of Appeals affirmed. 503 F. 3d 566 (CA6 2007).\n  We granted certiorari, 554 U. S. ___ (2008), to decide\ntwo questions: (1) whether a certificate of appealability\n(COA) is required to appeal an order denying a request for\nfederally appointed counsel pursuant to §3599, and (2)\nwhether §3599(e)’s reference to “proceedings for executive\nor other clemency as may be available to the defendant”\nencompasses state clemency proceedings. We conclude\nthat a COA is not necessary and that §3599 authorizes\nfederally appointed counsel to represent clients in state\nclemency proceedings.\n                              I\n  We first consider whether Harbison was required to\nobtain a COA to appeal the District Court’s order. The\nState of Tennessee and the United States as amicus curiae\nagree with Harbison that he was not.\n  The District Court’s denial of Harbison’s motion to\nauthorize his federal counsel to represent him in state\nclemency proceedings was clearly an appealable order\nunder 28 U. S. C. §1291. See, e.g., McFarland v. Scott, 512\nU. S. 849 (1994) (reviewing the Court of Appeals’ judg\nment denying a petition for the appointment of counsel\npursuant to the statute now codified at 18 U. S. C. §3599).\nThe question is whether Harbison’s failure to obtain a\nCOA pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §2253(c)(1)(A) deprived the\nCourt of Appeals of jurisdiction over the appeal.\n  Section 2253(c)(1)(A) provides that unless a circuit\njustice or judge issues a COA, an appeal may not be taken\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom “the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in\nwhich the detention complained of arises out of process\nissued by a State court.” This provision governs final\norders that dispose of the merits of a habeas corpus pro\nceeding—a proceeding challenging the lawfulness of the\npetitioner’s detention. See generally Slack v. McDaniel,\n529 U. S. 473, 484–485 (2000); Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544\nU. S. 74, 78–83 (2005). An order that merely denies a\nmotion to enlarge the authority of appointed counsel (or\nthat denies a motion for appointment of counsel) is not\nsuch an order and is therefore not subject to the COA\nrequirement.\n                             II\n  The central question presented by this case is whether\n18 U. S. C. §3599 authorizes counsel appointed to repre\nsent a state petitioner in 28 U. S. C. §2254 proceedings to\nrepresent him in subsequent state clemency proceedings.\nAlthough Tennessee takes no position on this question, the\nGovernment defends the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nthat the statute does not authorize such representation.\n  We begin with the language of the statute. Section\n3599, titled “Counsel for financially unable defendants,”\nprovides for the appointment of counsel for two classes of\nindigents, described, respectively, in subsections (a)(1) and\n(a)(2). The former states:\n    “[I]n every criminal action in which a defendant is\n    charged with a crime which may be punishable by\n    death, a defendant who is or becomes financially un\n    able to obtain adequate representation or investiga\n    tive, expert, or other reasonably necessary services at\n    any time either—\n       “(A) before judgment; or\n       “(B) after the entry of a judgment imposing a\n    sentence of death but before the execution of that\n    judgment;\n4                       HARBISON v. BELL\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n     “shall be entitled to the appointment of one or more\n     attorneys and the furnishing of such other services in\n     accordance with subsections (b) through (f).”\nSubsection (a)(2) states:\n     “In any post conviction proceeding under section 2254\n     or 2255 of title 28, United States Code, seeking to va\n     cate or set aside a death sentence, any defendant who\n     is or becomes financially unable to obtain adequate\n     representation or investigative, expert, or other rea\n     sonably necessary services shall be entitled to the ap\n     pointment of one or more attorneys and the furnishing\n     of such other services in accordance with subsections\n     (b) through (f).”\nThe parties agree that subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) make\ntwo different groups eligible for federally appointed coun\nsel: (a)(1) describes federal capital defendants, while (a)(2)\ndescribes state and federal postconviction litigants,\nas indicated by its reference to both §2254 and §2255\nproceedings.2\n  After subsections (b) through (d) discuss counsel’s nec\nessary qualifications, subsection (e) sets forth counsel’s\nresponsibilities. It provides:\n     “Unless replaced by similarly qualified counsel upon\n     the attorney’s own motion or upon motion of the de\n     fendant, each attorney so appointed shall represent\n     the defendant throughout every subsequent stage of\n     available judicial proceedings, including pretrial pro\n     ceedings, trial, sentencing, motions for new trial, ap\n     peals, applications for writ of certiorari to the Su\n     preme Court of the United States, and all available\n     post-conviction process, together with applications for\n     stays of execution and other appropriations motions\n——————\n  2 We note that §3599 uses the term “defendant” to describe postcon\n\nviction litigants.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    and procedures, and shall also represent the defendant\n    in such competency proceedings and proceedings for\n    executive or other clemency as may be available to the\n    defendant.” (Emphasis added.)\nFocusing on the italicized clause of subsection (e), Harbi\nson contends that the plain language of the statute dic\ntates the outcome of this case. We are persuaded by his\nargument.\n   Under a straightforward reading of the statute, subsec\ntion (a)(2) triggers the appointment of counsel for habeas\npetitioners, and subsection (e) governs the scope of ap\npointed counsel’s duties. See §3599(a)(2) (stating that\nhabeas petitioners challenging a death sentence shall be\nentitled to “the furnishing of . . . services in accordance\nwith subsections (b) through (f)”). Thus, once federally\nfunded counsel is appointed to represent a state prisoner\nin §2254 proceedings, she “shall also represent the defen\ndant in such . . . proceedings for executive or other clem\nency as may be available to the defendant.” §3599(e).\nBecause state clemency proceedings are “available” to\nstate petitioners who obtain representation pursuant to\nsubsection (a)(2), the statutory language indicates that\nappointed counsel’s authorized representation includes\nsuch proceedings.\n   The Government contends that, fairly read, the statute\nas a whole is intended to furnish representation only in\nfederal proceedings and that all proceedings listed in\nsubsection (e), including clemency proceedings, should be\nunderstood to be federal. The absence of the word “fed\neral” in this subsection is not dispositive, it maintains,\nbecause subsection (a)(1) likewise does not use the word\n“federal” yet the parties agree that provision concerns only\nfederal defendants. Just as “federal” is implied by context\nin subsection (a)(1), so too, the Government says, is it\nimplied in subsection (e). According to the Government,\n6                        HARBISON v. BELL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe repeated use of the word “available” supports this\nreading: Congress contemplated that not all catalogued\nproceedings would be available to any given client,\nand clemency proceedings are simply not available to\nstate petitioners because they are ineligible for federal\nclemency.\n   The Government’s argument is not convincing. Subsec\ntion (a)(1) is properly understood as describing federal\ndefendants because the statute is primarily concerned\nwith federal criminal actions3 and (a)(1) includes no lan\nguage suggesting that it applies more broadly. By con\ntrast, subsection (a)(2) refers to state litigants, and it in\nturn provides that subsection (e) applies to such litigants.\nThere is therefore no basis for assuming that Congress\nintended “proceedings for executive or other clemency as\nmay be available to the defendant” in subsection (e) to\nindicate only federal clemency.\n   To the contrary, the reference to “proceedings for execu\ntive or other clemency,” §3599(e) (emphasis added), reveals\nthat Congress intended to include state clemency proceed\nings within the statute’s reach.4 Federal clemency is\nexclusively executive: Only the President has the power to\ngrant clemency for offenses under federal law. U. S.\nConst., Art. II, §2, cl. 1.5 By contrast, the States adminis\n——————\n  3 As we discuss below, §3599 was originally enacted as part of a stat\n\nute creating a new federal capital offense, Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988,\n§7001(b), 102 Stat. 4388, and it is now codified in Title 18, which\nprincipally addresses federal criminal proceedings.\n  4 JUSTICE SCALIA argues that subsection (e), including the reference to\n\n“other clemency,” was drafted to apply only to federal defendants, but\nthis is not correct, as we discuss infra, at 10–12.\n  5 The Government suggests that Congress might have referred to\n\n“other clemency” to encompass the Executive’s use of other persons to\nassist him in reviewing clemency applications. But as the Government\nconcedes, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 43—and as Members of Congress would\nhave known—regardless of what assistance the President seeks, the\nfederal proceeding is one for executive clemency under the Constitu\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

IV, §2 (independent board has clemency authority);\nNev. Const., Art. 5, §14 (governor, supreme court justices,\nand attorney general share clemency power); Fla. Const.,\nArt. IV, §8 (legislature has clemency authority for trea\nsonous offenses); McLaughlin v. Bronson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n271, 537 A. 2d 1004, 1006–1007 (1988) (“In Connecticut,\nthe pardoning power is vested in the legislature, which\nhas delegated its exercise to the board of pardons” (cita\ntion omitted)). Congress’ reference to “other clemency”\nthus does not refer to federal clemency but instead encom\npasses the various forms of state clemency.6\n   The Government’s reliance on the word “available” is\nalso misplaced. While it maintains that Congress’ re\npeated use of the word shows that various §3599(e) proce\ndures do not apply to particular indigents, the term in\nstead indicates the breadth of the representation\ncontemplated. The directive that counsel “shall represent\nthe defendant throughout every subsequent stage of avail\nable judicial proceedings, including . . . all available post\nconviction process,” for example, hardly suggests a limita\ntion on the scope of representation.\n   The Government is correct that appointed counsel is not\n——————\ntion.\n   6 We also note that the Government’s proposal to read the word “fed\n\neral” into §3599(e) would lead to absurd results. It is clear, for exam\nple, that a state inmate faced with an imminent execution might be\nrequired to apply for a stay from a state court before seeking such relief\nin a federal court. On our reading of the statute, federally appointed\ncounsel would be permitted to represent her client pursuant to subsec\ntion (e)’s reference to “applications for stays of execution and other\nappropriate motions and procedures.” But on the Government’s read\ning, the inmate would have to secure new counsel to file the stay\nrequest because his federal counsel would not be authorized to repre\nsent him. Such a rigid limit on the authority of appointed federal\ncounsel would be inconsistent with the basic purpose of the statute. Cf.\nMcFarland v. Scott, 512 U. S. 849, 854–857 (1994).\n8                    HARBISON v. BELL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nexpected to provide each service enumerated in subsection\n(e) for every client. But that limitation does not follow\nfrom the word “available”; it follows from the word “subse\nquent” and the organization of subsection (e) to mirror the\nordinary course of proceedings for capital defendants.\nCounsel’s responsibilities commence at a different part of\nsubsection (e) depending on whether she is appointed\npursuant to subsection (a)(1)(A), (a)(1)(B), or (a)(2). When\nshe is appointed pursuant to (a)(1)(A), she is charged with\nrepresenting her client in all listed proceedings. When she\nis appointed pursuant to (a)(1)(B) (i.e., after the entry of a\nfederal death sentence), her representation begins with\n“appeals.” And when she is appointed pursuant to (a)(2),\nher representation begins with the §2254 or §2255 “post\nconviction process.” Thus, counsel’s representation in\ncludes only those judicial proceedings transpiring “subse\nquent” to her appointment. It is the sequential organiza\ntion of the statute and the term “subsequent” that\ncircumscribe counsel’s representation, not a strict division\nbetween federal and state proceedings.\n                             III\n   In an attempt to overcome the plain language of §3599,\nthe Government advances two additional arguments that\nmerit discussion. First, it contends that a literal reading\nof subsection (e) would lead to unacceptable results: It\nwould require a federal lawyer who obtained relief for her\nclient in §2254 proceedings to continue to represent him\nduring his state retrial; similarly, it would require federal\ncounsel to represent her client in any state habeas pro\nceeding following her appointment. Second, the Govern\nment claims that the statute’s legislative history shows\nthat Congress did not intend to include state clemency\nproceedings within §3599(e)’s coverage. Neither argument\nis persuasive.\n   The Government suggests that reading §3599(e) to\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nauthorize federally funded counsel for state clemency\nproceedings would require a lawyer who succeeded in\nsetting aside a state death sentence during postconviction\nproceedings to represent her client during an ensuing\nstate retrial. We do not read subsection (e) to apply to\nstate-court proceedings that follow the issuance of a fed\neral writ of habeas corpus. When a retrial occurs after\npostconviction relief, it is not properly understood as a\n“subsequent stage” of judicial proceedings but rather as\nthe commencement of new judicial proceedings. Moreover,\nsubsection (a)(2) provides for counsel only when a state\npetitioner is unable to obtain adequate representation.\nStates are constitutionally required to provide trial coun\nsel for indigent defendants. Thus, when a state prisoner\nis granted a new trial following §2254 proceedings, his\nstate-furnished representation renders him ineligible for\n§3599 counsel until the commencement of new §2254\nproceedings.\n   The Government likewise argues that our reading of\n§3599(e) would require federally funded counsel to repre\nsent her client in any state habeas proceeding occurring\nafter her appointment because such proceedings are also\n“available post-conviction process.” But as we have previ\nously noted, subsection (e) authorizes counsel to represent\nher client in “subsequent” stages of available judicial\nproceedings. State habeas is not a stage “subsequent” to\nfederal habeas. Just the opposite: Petitioners must ex\nhaust their claims in state court before seeking federal\nhabeas relief. See §2254(b)(1). That state postconviction\nlitigation sometimes follows the initiation of federal ha\nbeas because a petitioner has failed to exhaust does not\nchange the order of proceedings contemplated by the\nstatute.7\n——————\n  7 Pursuant to §3599(e)’s provision that counsel may represent her client\n\nin “other appropriate motions and procedures,” a district court may\n10                       HARBISON v. BELL\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  The Government also argues that §3599(e) should not be\ninterpreted as including state-clemency proceedings be\ncause it was drafted to apply only to federal defendants.\nSection 3599 was originally enacted as part of the Anti-\nDrug Abuse Act of 1988, §7001(b), 102 Stat. 4388 (codified\nat 21 U. S. C. §§848(q)(4)–(10)), which created a federal\ncapital offense of drug-related homicide. In 2006, the\ndeath penalty procedures specified in that Act were re\npealed and recodified without change at 18 U. S. C. §3599.\nBased on the 1988 legislative history, the Government\nargues that subsection (e) was not written to apply to state\npetitioners at all. In its telling, the subsection was drafted\nwhen the bill covered only federal defendants; state liti\ngants were added, by means of what is now subsection\n(a)(2), just a few hours before the bill passed in rushed\nend-of-session proceedings; and Congress simply did not\nattend to the fact that this amendment applied what is\nnow subsection (e) to state litigants.\n  While the legislative history is regrettably thin, the\nevidence that is available does not support the Govern\nment’s argument. State petitioners were a part of the\nAnti-Drug Abuse Act from the first day the House of Rep\nresentatives took up the bill. In the amendment authoriz\ning the death penalty for drug-related homicides, Repre\nsentative George Gekas included a provision that closely\nresembles the current §3599(a)(2): “In any post-conviction\nproceeding under section 2254 or 2255 of title 28, United\nStates Code, seeking to vacate or set aside a death sen\ntence, the court shall appoint counsel to represent any\ndefendant who is or becomes financially unable to obtain\nadequate representation.” 134 Cong. Rec. 22984 (1988)\n\n——————\ndetermine on a case-by-case basis that it is appropriate for federal\ncounsel to exhaust a claim in the course of her federal habeas represen\ntation. This is not the same as classifying state habeas proceedings as\n“available post-conviction process” within the meaning of the statute.\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n(emphasis added).\n   Following passage of the Gekas amendment, Represen\ntative John Conyers proposed replacing its provisions on\nappellate and collateral process (including the above\nquoted provision) with language comprising the provisions\nnow codified at §§3599(a)(1), (b), (c), and (e). Because his\namendment introduced the §3599(e) language and did not\nrefer specifically to §2254 proceedings, the Government\nand JUSTICE SCALIA argue that Representative Conyers\ndrafted subsection (e) to apply only to federal defendants.\nBut his floor statements evince his particular concern for\nstate prisoners. He explained that his amendment filed a\ngap because “[w]hile State courts appoint lawyers for\nindigent defendants, there is no legal representation\nautomatically provided once the case i[s] appealed to the\nFederal level.” Id., at 22996.8 He then cited discussions\nby the Chief Judge of the Eleventh Circuit and the\nNAACP devoted exclusively to errors found by federal\ncourts during habeas corpus review of state capital cases.\nIbid.\n   In the Senate, Representative Conyers’ language was\nfirst replaced with Representative Gekas’ provision for\ncounsel for §2254 and §2255 petitioners, and then a sub\nsequent amendment substituted the text of the Conyers\namendment. See id., at 30401, 30746. Thereafter, the\nHouse amended the bill a final time to insert the language\nnow codified at §3599(a)(2) while leaving the Conyers\n——————\n   8 Despite his reference to “defendants” and “appealed,” Representa\n\ntive Conyers was clearly discussing state prisoners seeking federal\nhabeas relief. Representative Gekas’ amendment similarly referred to\npostconviction litigants as “defendants,” and the relevant portion of his\namendment was titled “Appeal in Capital Cases” even though it incor\nporated §2254 and §2255 proceedings. 134 Cong. Rec. 22984. As\ncodified, §3599(a)(2) likewise uses the term “defendant” to refer to\nhabeas petitioners. The Government is incorrect to suggest that the\nstatute’s use of this term illustrates that it was not written to apply to\npostconviction litigants.\n12                         HARBISON v. BELL\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nlanguage in place. See id., at 33215. The Government\nargues that this late amendment marked the first occasion\non which state prisoners were brought within the bill’s\ncompass. But Representative Gekas’ initial amendment\nexplicitly referenced §2254 petitioners, and Representative\nConyers’ proposal sought to provide additional protections\nfor all capital defendants. The House’s final amendment\nis therefore best understood not as altering the bill’s scope,\nbut as clarifying it.\n   The Government’s arguments about §3599’s history and\npurposes are laced with the suggestion that Congress\nsimply would not have intended to fund clemency counsel\nfor indigent state prisoners because clemency proceedings\nare a matter of grace entirely distinct from judicial pro\nceedings.9     As this Court has recognized, however,\n“[c]lemency is deeply rooted in our Anglo-American tradi\ntion of law, and is the historic remedy for preventing\nmiscarriages of justice where judicial process has been\nexhausted.” Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390, 411–412\n(1993) (footnote omitted). Far from regarding clemency as\na matter of mercy alone, we have called it “the ‘fail safe’ in\nour criminal justice system.” Id., at 415.10\n——————\n   9 The Government also submits that providing federally funded coun\n\nsel for state clemency proceedings would raise “unique federalism\nconcerns.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 31. But Tennes\nsee’s position belies that claim. Following other States that have\nlitigated the question, Tennessee has expressed “no view” on the\nstatute’s scope because it “has no real stake in whether an inmate\nreceives federal funding for clemency counsel.” Brief for Respondent 7;\nsee also Brief for Current and Former Governors as Amici Curiae 18\n(“Contrary to the view of the Solicitor General . . . , the fact that counsel\nis appointed by a federal court does not reflect an intrusion on state\nsovereignty”).\n   10 See also Kansas v.

Moreover, Congress’ sequential\nenumeration suggests an awareness that clemency pro\nceedings are not as divorced from judicial proceedings as\nthe Government submits. Subsection (e) emphasizes\ncontinuity of counsel, and Congress likely appreciated that\nfederal habeas counsel are well positioned to represent\ntheir clients in the state clemency proceedings that typi\ncally follow the conclusion of §2254 litigation.\n   Indeed, as the history of this case demonstrates, the\nwork of competent counsel during habeas corpus represen\ntation may provide the basis for a persuasive clemency\napplication. Harbison’s federally appointed counsel devel\noped extensive information about his life history and\ncognitive impairments that was not presented during his\ntrial or appeals. She also litigated a claim under Brady v.\nMaryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), based on police records\nthat had been suppressed for 14 years. One Court of\nAppeals judge concluded that the nondisclosure of these\nrecords “undermine[d] confidence in Harbison’s guilty\nverdict” because the evidence contained therein could have\nsupported a colorable defense that a third party murdered\nthe victim and that Harbison’s codefendant falsely impli\ncated him. 408 F. 3d, at 840 (Clay, J., dissenting).

Mullin, 436 F. 3d 1168\n(CA10 2006) (en banc). In authorizing federally funded\ncounsel to represent their state clients in clemency pro\nceedings, Congress ensured that no prisoner would be put\nto death without meaningful access to the “ ‘fail-safe’ ” of\nour justice system.

S., at 415.\n                            IV\n  We conclude that a COA is not required to appeal an\norder denying a motion for federally appointed counsel.\nWe further hold that §3599 authorizes federally appointed\ncounsel to represent their clients in state clemency pro\nceedings and entitles them to compensation for that repre\nsentation.

S. C.\n§3599(a)(2) entitles indigent federal habeas petitioners to\nappointed counsel “in accordance with” subsection (e).\nSubsection (e) specifies that the appointed counsel “shall\nrepresent the defendant throughout every subsequent\nstage of available judicial proceedings . . . and shall also\nrepresent the defendant in such . . . proceedings for execu\ntive or other clemency as may be available to the defen\ndant.” Nothing in the text of §3599(e) excludes proceed\nings for available state clemency, and, as the Court points\nout, there are good reasons to expect federal habeas coun\nsel to carry on through state clemency proceedings. See\nante, at 12–14.\n   At the same time, the “plain language of §3599,” ante, at\n8, does not fully resolve this case. The obligation in sub\nsection (e) that the appointed counsel represent the defen\ndant in “every subsequent stage of available judicial pro\nceedings” is not on its face limited to “federal” proceedings,\njust as there is no such limitation with respect to clem\nency. Yet it is highly unlikely that Congress intended\nfederal habeas petitioners to keep their federal counsel\nduring subsequent state judicial proceedings. See Hain v.\nMullin, 436 F. 3d 1168, 1178 (CA10 2006) (Briscoe, J.,\ndissenting) (“[I]t cannot seriously be suggested that Con\n2                     HARBISON v. BELL\n\n              ROBERTS, C.

Harbison concedes as much.\nReply Brief for Petitioner 11–12; Tr. of Oral Arg. 5–6, 15.\n  If there were no way to read the words of the statute to\navoid this problematic result, I might be forced to accept\nthe Government’s invitation to insert the word “federal”\ninto §3599(e)—a limitation that would have to apply to\nclemency as well. But fortunately the best reading of the\nstatute avoids the problem: Section 3599(e)’s reference to\n“subsequent stage[s] of available judicial proceedings”\ndoes not include state judicial proceedings after federal\nhabeas, because those are more properly regarded as new\njudicial proceedings.\n  The meaning of that phrase is not entirely plain, but it\nis plain that not every lawsuit involving an inmate that\narises after the federal habeas proceeding is included.\nSurely “subsequent stage[s]” do not include, for example, a\nchallenge to prison conditions or a suit for divorce in state\ncourt, even if these available judicial proceedings occur\nsubsequent to federal habeas. That must be because these\nare new proceedings rather than “subsequent stage[s]” of\nthe proceedings for which federal counsel is available.\nOnce it is acknowledged that Congress has drawn a line at\nsome point, this is the “best reading” of the statutory\nlanguage. Post, at 3 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).\n  JUSTICE THOMAS does not disagree. Instead, he con\ntends that it is not necessary to decide what the first part\nof the sentence means in deciding what the second part\nmeans. Post, at 4. We have said that “[w]e do not . . .\nconstrue statutory phrases in isolation; we read statutes\nas a whole.” United States v. Morton, 467 U. S. 822, 828\n(1984).

S. C. §2253(c)(1)(A), a certifi\ncate of appealability was not required to seek appellate\nreview of the issue in this case. See ante, at 2–3; see also\npost, at 1 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart). I further agree with the Court that 18 U. S. C.\n§§3599(a)(2) and (e) entitle eligible state postconviction\nlitigants to federally funded counsel in available state\nclemency proceedings. See ante, at 2, 5. As even JUSTICE\nSCALIA acknowledges in his dissenting opinion, the statute\n“contains no express language limiting its application to\nproceedings in a federal forum.” Post, at 8; see also ante,\nat 1 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment) (“Nothing in\nthe text of §3599(e) excludes proceedings for available\nstate clemency . . .”). By its express terms, the statute\n“entitle[s]” eligible litigants to appointed counsel who\n“shall represent the defendant . . . in such . . . proceedings\nfor executive or other clemency as may be available to the\ndefendant.” §§3599(a)(2), (e). Because the statute applies\nto individuals challenging either state or federal convic\ntions, see §3599(a)(2), and because state clemency is the\nonly clemency available to those challenging state convic\ntions, §§3599(a)(2) and (e) necessarily entitle eligible state\npostconviction litigants to federally funded counsel in\nstate clemency proceedings.\n2                    HARBISON v. BELL\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   I disagree, however, with the assumption that §3599\nmust be limited to “federal” proceedings in at least some\nrespects. Ante, at 6; ante, at 1–2 (ROBERTS, C. J., concur\nring in judgment); post, at 3–4. The majority and dissent\nread such a limitation into subsection (a)(1) of the statute.\nBut that subsection, like subsection (a)(2), “contains no\nlanguage limiting its application to federal capital defen\ndants. It provides counsel to indigent defendants in ‘every\ncriminal action in which a defendant is charged with a\ncrime which may be punishable by death.’ ” Post, at 3\n(quoting §3599(a)(1)). The majority, then, compounds its\nerror by attempting to discern some distinction between\nsubsections (a)(1) and (a)(2), to which it properly declines\nto add an extratextual “federal” limitation, see ante, at 5–\n6. The dissent seizes on this inconsistency between the\nmajority’s interpretation of subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2),\nbut responds by incorrectly reading a parallel “federal”\nlimitation into subsection (a)(2), see post, at 3–4. In the\ndissent’s view, “it is perfectly reasonable to assume” that\nsubsection (a)(2) is limited to federal postconviction pro\nceedings—including clemency proceedings—“even where\nthe statute contains no such express limitation.” Post, at\n3.\n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE, in contrast, finds a “federal” limita\ntion in a clause of subsection (e) that is not before this\nCourt in order to cabin the reach of today’s decision. He\nobserves that the text of subsection (e) includes no “fed\neral” limitation with respect to any of the proceedings\nlisted in that subsection. But THE CHIEF JUSTICE finds a\nway to avoid this “problematic result” by adding a differ\nent limitation to §3599. In his view, the “best” reading of\nthe phrase “subsequent stage[s] of available judicial pro\nceedings” is one that excludes “state judicial proceedings\nafter federal habeas” proceedings because they are\n“new”—not “subsequent”—judicial proceedings. Ante, at 2.\nWithout this limitation, THE CHIEF JUSTICE explains, “[he]\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

Ante, at\n1–2.\n   This Court is not tasked with interpreting §3599 in a\nway that it believes is consistent with the policy outcome\nintended by Congress. Nor should this Court’s approach\nto statutory construction be influenced by the supposition\nthat “it is highly unlikely that Congress intended” a given\nresult. See ante, at 1 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judg\nment). Congress’ intent is found in the words it has cho\nsen to use. See West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v.\nCasey, 499 U. S. 83, 98 (1991) (“The best evidence of [Con\ngress’] purpose is the statutory text adopted by both\nHouses of Congress and submitted to the President”).\nThis Court’s interpretive function requires it to identify\nand give effect to the best reading of the words in the\nprovision at issue. Even if the proper interpretation of a\nstatute upholds a “very bad policy,” it “is not within our\nprovince to second-guess” the “wisdom of Congress’ action”\nby picking and choosing our preferred interpretation from\namong a range of potentially plausible, but likely inaccu\nrate, interpretations of a statute. Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537\nU. S. 186, 222 (2003); see also TVA v. Hill, 437 U. S. 153,\n194 (1978) (“Our individual appraisal of the wisdom or\nunwisdom of a particular course consciously selected by\nthe Congress is to be put aside in the process of interpret\ning a statute”). “Our task is to apply the text, not to im\nprove upon it.” Pavelic & LeFlore v. Marvel Entertainment\nGroup, Div. of Cadence Industries Corp., 493 U. S. 120,\n126 (1989).\n   This statute’s silence with respect to a “federal” limita\ntion in no way authorizes us to assume that such a limita\ntion must be read into subsections (a) and (e) in order to\n4                    HARBISON v. BELL\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nblunt the slippery-slope policy arguments of those opposed\nto a plain-meaning construction of the provisions under\nreview, see ante, at 8–9. And Congress’ silence certainly\ndoes not empower us to go even farther and incorporate\nsuch an assumption into the text of these provisions. Post,\nat 7–8. Moreover, the Court should not decide a question\nirrelevant to this case in order to pre-empt the “problem\natic” results that might arise from a plain-text reading of\nthe statutory provision under review. See ante, at 2\n(ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment). Whether or not\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE’s construction of the “subsequent\nstage of available judicial proceedings” clause of subsec\ntion (e) is correct, it is irrelevant to the proper interpreta\ntion of the clemency clause of subsection (e). Even if the\nstatute were to authorize federal postconviction counsel to\nappear in state proceedings other than state clemency\nproceedings, a question not resolved by today’s decision,\nthat conclusion would not provide a legitimate basis for\nadopting the dissent’s atextual interpretation of the clem\nency clause of subsection (e). The “best” interpretation of\nthe clemency clause does not turn on the unresolved\nbreadth of the “subsequent stage of available judicial\nproceedings” clause.\n   Rather, the Court must adopt the interpretation of the\nstatute that is most faithful to its text. Here, the absence\nof a “federal” limitation in the text of subsections (a) and\n(e) of §3599 most logically suggests that these provisions\nare not limited to federal clemency proceedings. “If Con\ngress enacted into law something different from what it\nintended, then it should amend the statute to conform it to\nits intent. It is beyond our province to rescue Congress\nfrom its drafting errors, and to provide for what we might\nthink is the preferred result. ” Lamie v. United States\nTrustee, 540 U.

C. §3599\ngives state prisoners federally funded counsel to pursue\nstate clemency. While purporting to adopt a “straightfor\nward reading of the statute,” ante at 5, the Court in fact\nselectively amends the statute—inserting words in some\nplaces, twisting their meaning elsewhere. Because the\nstatute is most naturally and coherently read to provide\nfederally funded counsel to capital defendants appearing\nin a federal forum, I would affirm the decision of the Sixth\nCircuit and hold that Harbison was not entitled to feder\nally funded counsel to pursue state clemency.\n                            I\n Title 18 U. S. C. §3599(a)(2) provides for the appoint\nment of counsel as follows:\n    “In any post conviction proceeding under section 2254\n    or 2255 of title 28, United States Code, seeking to va\n    cate or set aside a death sentence, any defendant who\n    is or becomes financially unable to obtain adequate\n2                    HARBISON v.

And the sec\nond of them, without any express qualification, provides\nfor counsel’s continued representation through “such . . .\nproceedings for executive or other clemency as may be\navailable to the defendant,” which in petitioner’s case\nwould include state clemency proceedings. The Court thus\nconcludes that the statute’s “plain language” provides\nHarbison federally funded counsel to represent him in\nstate clemency proceedings. Ante, at 5.\n  But the Court quickly abandons its allegedly “plain”\nreading of the statute when it confronts the subsection\nthat precedes these two, which provides:\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n    “Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the\n    contrary, in every criminal action in which a defen\n    dant is charged with a crime which may be punishable\n    by death, a defendant who is or becomes financially\n    unable to obtain adequate representation or investiga\n    tive, expert, or other reasonably necessary services at\n    any time either–\n       “(A) before judgment; or\n       “(B) after the entry of a judgment imposing a\n    sentence of death but before the execution of that\n    judgment;\n    “shall be entitled to the appointment of one or more\n    attorneys and the furnishing of such other services in\n    accordance with subsections (b) through (f).”\n    §3599(a)(1).\nThe Court states that “(a)(1) describes federal capital\ndefendants.” Ante, at 4. But according to the Court’s\nmode of analysis, that is not so. Subsection (a)(1), like\nsubsection (e), contains no language limiting its applica\ntion to federal capital defendants. It provides counsel to\nindigent defendants in “every criminal action in which a\ndefendant is charged with a crime which may be punish\nable by death.” §3599(a)(1) (emphasis added). Why, then,\nis subsection (a)(1) limited to federal capital defendants?\nBecause, as the Court notes, “the statute is primarily\nconcerned with federal criminal actions and (a)(1) includes\nno language suggesting that it applies more broadly.”\nAnte, at 6 (footnote omitted).\n   Quite right. Section 3599 was enacted as part of a bill\nthat created a new federal capital offense, see ibid., n. 3,\nand it is perfectly reasonable to assume that a federal\nstatute, providing federally funded counsel, applies in\nfederal proceedings only, even where the statute contains\nno such express limitation.

But there\n4                    HARBISON v. BELL\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nis no basis for adopting that reading with respect to only\nhalf the statute. If subsection (a)(1) is limited to federal\nproceedings, then subsection (e), which likewise contains\nno express federal limitation, is similarly limited. We\ncannot give the same silence (omission of the limiting\nword “federal”) in adjacent and simultaneously enacted\nsubsections of the same law (§3599) divergent meanings.\n   The Court advances two arguments for reading subsec\ntion (e) more broadly. First, it claims that unlike subsec\ntion (a)(1), “subsection (a)(2) refers to state litigants.”\nAnte, at 6. It most certainly does not. It refers to proceed\nings under §2254 and §2255—proceedings under federal\nstatutes providing federal causes of action in federal court.\nRead together, subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) provide feder\nally funded counsel for persons convicted of capital crimes\nwho are appearing in federal court. Subsection (a)(2)\nneither undermines the Court’s earlier statement that\n“the statute’s primary focus is federal” proceedings, nor\ngives the Court license to insert words selectively into the\nstatutory text.\n   The Court next reasons that the phrase “executive or\nother clemency” suggests that subsection (e) includes state\nclemency proceedings. Since (the argument goes) federal\nclemency is exclusively executive, the word “other” must\nrefer to state clemency, or else it would be superfluous.\nBut the drafting history, which the Court thinks relevant,\nante, at 10–11, defeats the inference the Court wishes to\ndraw. The current text of subsection (e) first appeared in\na version of the bill that included what is now subsection\n(a)(1) (which the Court concedes deals only with federal\nproceedings), but not subsection (a)(2) (which the Court\nwould deem applicable to state proceedings). 134 Cong.\nRec. 22995 (1988). In other words, at the time of its intro\nduction, subsection (e) applied only to federal defendants,\nand the phrase “or other clemency” was unquestionably\nsuperfluous.\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n   In any event, the Court’s reading places a great deal of\nweight on avoiding superfluity in a statute that is already\nteeming with superfluity. Item: Subsection (a)(2) need\nlessly refers to §2255 proceedings even though subsections\n(a)(1) and (e) taken together would provide federal capital\ndefendants with counsel in §2255 proceedings. Item:\nSubsection (a)(2) provides counsel “in accordance with\nsubsections (b) through (f)” even though subsections (b)\nand (c) have no conceivable relevance to subsection (a)(2).*\nItem: Subsection (e) provides counsel “throughout every\nsubsequent stage of available judicial proceedings,” includ\ning “all available post-conviction process” (emphasis\nadded). The first use of the term “available” is already of\ndubious value (is counsel expected to represent a defen\ndant in unavailable proceedings?) but its needless repeti\ntion is inexplicable. In a statute that is such a paragon of\nshoddy draftsmanship, relying upon the superfluity of “or\nother” to extend the statute’s application from federal to\nstate proceedings is quite absurd—and doubly absurd\nwhen that extension is illogically limited to the subsection\nin which “or other” appears.\n                            II\n  The Court’s reading of subsection (e) faces a second\nsubstantial difficulty. Subsection (e) provides that coun\nsel, once appointed,\n     “shall represent the defendant throughout every sub\n     sequent stage of available judicial proceedings, includ\n     ing pretrial proceedings, trial, sentencing, motions for\n——————\n  * Subsection (b) details the requisite qualifications for a lawyer ap\npointed “before judgment”; but appointments under subsection (a)(2)\nare made only after judgment. Subsection (c) requires that a lawyer\nappointed after judgment have been “admitted to practice in the court\nof appeals for not less than five years” (emphasis added); but the\npostconviction proceedings dealt with by subsection (a)(2) take place in\nfederal district court.\n6                    HARBISON v. BELL\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n    new trial, appeals, applications for writ of certiorari to\n    the Supreme Court of the United States, and all\n    available post-conviction process, together with appli\n    cations for stays of execution and other appropriate\n    motions and procedures.” §3599(e).\nIn other words, once counsel is appointed under (a)(2),\npetitioner is entitled to federal counsel “throughout every\nsubsequent stage of available judicial proceedings.” The\nGovernment argues that, if subsection (e) is not limited to\nfederal proceedings, then a §2254 petitioner who obtains\nfederally funded counsel will retain that counsel, at fed\neral expense, in all “subsequent” state-court proceedings,\nincluding the retrial that follows the grant of federal\nhabeas relief. The Court disagrees, on the ground that a\nnew trial represents the “commencement of new judicial\nproceedings.” Ante, at 9.\n   I need not enter that controversy. What is clear, at\nleast, is that (if subsection (e) includes state proceedings)\nfederally funded counsel would have to represent petition\ners in subsequent state habeas proceedings. The Court\ntries to split the baby here, conceding that “a district court\nmay determine on a case-by-case basis that it is appropri\nate for federal counsel to exhaust [in state court] a claim\nin the course of her federal habeas representation.” Ante,\nat 9–10, n. 7. The Court tries to derive this discretionary\nauthority from subsection (e)’s provision for representation\nby federal counsel in “other appropriate motions and\nprocedures.” §3599(e) (emphasis added). But that provi\nsion is in addition to, rather than in limitation of, subsec\ntion (e)’s unqualified statement that counsel “shall repre\nsent the defendant throughout every subsequent stage of\navailable judicial proceedings, including . . . all available\npost-conviction process.” The provision then continues:\n“together with applications for stays of execution and other\nappropriate motions and procedures.” (Emphasis added.)\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nThere is no way in which this can be read to limit the\nrequirement that counsel represent the defendant in\n“every subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings,”\nwhich would include habeas proceedings in state court.\n   The Court seeks to avoid this conclusion by saying that\n“[s]tate habeas is not a stage ‘subsequent’ to federal ha\nbeas,” because “[p]etitioners must exhaust their claims in\nstate court before seeking federal habeas relief.” Ante, at\n9. This is a breathtaking denial of reality, confusing what\nshould be with what is. It is rather like saying that mur\nder does not exist because the law forbids it. To be sure,\npetitioners are supposed to complete state postconviction\nproceedings before pursuing relief in federal court. But\nthey often do not do so, and when they do not our opinions\npermit them to seek stays or dismissals of their §2254\npetitions in order that they may thereafter (subsequently)\nreturn to state court to exhaust their claims. See Rhines\nv. Weber, 544 U. S. 269, 277–278 (2005); Pliler v. Ford, 542\nU. S. 225, 228 (2004). Additionally, inmates may—as\npetitioner did in this case—file successive state habeas\npetitions after §2254 proceedings are complete. See Har\nbison v. State, No. E2004–00885–CCA–R28–PD, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1521910</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *1 (Tenn. Crim. App., June 27, 2005). These\nsubsequent state proceedings are not rare but common\nplace, and it is inconceivable (if state proceedings are\ncovered) that subsection (e) does not refer to them. In\ndeed, one would think that subsection (e) refers especially\nto them. And what kind of an incoherent statute would it\nbe that allows counsel for de-facto-subsequent federal\nhabeas claims that should have been brought earlier (see\n§3599(a)(2)) but does not allow counsel for subsequent\nstate habeas claims that have the same defect?\n   If §3599(e) includes state proceedings (as the Court\nholds), and if “subsequent” is given its proper scope\n(rather than the tortured one adopted by the Court)—then\n§3599(a)(2)’s limitation of federally provided counsel to\n8                    HARBISON v. BELL\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nonly federal habeas proceedings would amount to a dead\nletter. A capital convict could file for federal habeas with\nout first exhausting state postconviction remedies, obtain\na stay or dismissal of that federal petition, and return to\nstate court along with his federally funded lawyer. In\ndeed, under our decision in McFarland v. Scott, 512 U. S.\n849 (1994), he need not even file an unexhausted federal\nhabeas petition; he can file a stand-alone “motion request\ning the appointment of habeas counsel,” id., at 859, and\nobtain federally funded counsel that he can then take back\nfor the subsequent state proceedings. The question per\nsists: Why would §3599(a)(2) provide counsel in only fed\neral habeas proceedings, when §3599(e) makes it so easy\nto obtain federally funded counsel for state habeas pro\nceedings as well?\n                         *    *    *\n  Concededly, §3599 contains no express language limit\ning its application to proceedings in a federal forum. And\nyet Harbison, the Government, and the Court all read part\nof that section to refer to federal proceedings only. The\nCourt’s refusal to extend that limitation to the entirety of\n§3599 is untenable. It lacks a textual basis and has the\nadditional misfortune of producing absurd results, which\nthe majority attempts to avoid by doing further violence to\nthe statutory text. I would read the statute as providing\nfederal counsel to capital convicts appearing in a federal\nforum, and I accordingly would affirm the judgment of the\nSixth Circuit.\n</pre>", "id": 145892, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2009/04/01/Harbison_v._Bell.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2008                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

BELL, WARDEN\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 07–8521. Argued January 12, 2009—Decided April 1, 2009\nAfter the Tennessee state courts rejected petitioner Harbison’s convic\n  tion and death sentence challenges, the Federal District Court ap\n  pointed a federal public defender to represent him in filing a habeas\n  petition under 28 U. S. C. §2254. That petition was denied. Harbi\n  son then sought appointment of counsel for state clemency proceed\n  ings. Because Tennessee law no longer authorizes the appointment\n  of state public defenders as clemency counsel, his federal counsel\n  moved to expand the scope of her representation to include the state\n  proceedings. In denying the motion, the District Court relied on Cir\n  cuit precedent construing 18 U. S. C. §3599, which provides for the\n  appointment of federal counsel. The Sixth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. A certificate of appealability pursuant to 28 U. S. C.\n §2253(c)(1)(A) is not required to appeal an order denying a request\n for federally appointed counsel under §3599 because §2253(c)(1)(A)\n governs only final orders that dispose of a habeas corpus proceeding’s\n merits. Pp. 2–3.\n    2. Section 3599 authorizes federally appointed counsel to represent\n their clients in state clemency proceedings and entitles them to com\n pensation for that representation. Pp. 3–14.\n       (a) Section 3599(a)(2), which refers to both §2254 and §2255 pro\n ceedings, triggers the appointment of counsel for both state and fed\n eral postconviction litigants, and §3599(e) governs the scope of ap\n pointed counsel’s duties. Thus, federally funded counsel appointed to\n represent a state prisoner in §2254 proceedings “shall also represent\n the defendant in such . . . proceedings for executive or other clemency\n as may be available to the defendant.” §3599(e). Because state clem\n ency proceedings are “available” to state petitioners who obtain sub\n2                           HARBISON v. BELL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    section (a)(2) representation, the statute’s plain language indicates\n    that appointed counsel’s authorized representation includes such\n    proceedings. Moreover, subsection (e)’s reference to “proceedings for\n    . . . other clemency” refers to state proceedings, as federal clemency is\n    exclusively executive, while States administer clemency in various\n    ways. The Government is correct that appointed counsel is not ex\n    pected to provide each service enumerated in subsection (e) for every\n    client. Rather, counsel’s representation includes only those judicial\n    proceedings transpiring “subsequent” to her appointment, which un\n    der subsection (a)(2) begins with the §2254 or §2255 “post-conviction\n    process.” Pp. 3–8.\n           (b) The Government’s attempts to overcome §3599’s plain lan\n    guage are not persuasive. First, our reading of the statute does not\n    produce absurd results. Contrary to the Government’s contention, a\n    lawyer is not required to represent her client during a state retrial\n    following postconviction relief because the retrial marks the com\n    mencement of new judicial proceedings, not a subsequent stage of ex\n    isting proceedings; state postconviction proceedings are also not “sub\n    sequent” to federal habeas proceedings. Second, the legislative\n    history does not support the Government's argument that Congress\n    intended §3599 to apply only to federal defendants. Congress’ deci\n    sion to furnish counsel for state clemency proceedings reflects both\n    clemency’s role as the “ ‘fail safe’ of our criminal justice system,”\n    Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390, 415, and the fact that federal ha\n    beas counsel are well positioned to represent their clients in clemency\n    proceedings.

In 1997, after the\nstate courts rejected challenges to his conviction and\nsentence, the Federal District Court appointed the Federal\nDefender Services of Eastern Tennessee to represent him\nin filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to\n28 U. S. C. §2254.1 During the course of that representa\ntion, counsel developed substantial evidence relating both\nto Harbison’s culpability and to the appropriateness of his\nsentence. Although the courts did not order relief, the\nevidence proved persuasive to one Circuit Judge. See 408\nF. 3d 823, 837–846 (CA6 2005) (Clay, J., dissenting).\n   Shortly after his habeas corpus petition was denied,\nHarbison requested counsel for state clemency proceed\nings. In 2006, the Tennessee Supreme Court held that\nstate law does not authorize the appointment of state\npublic defenders as clemency counsel. State v. Johnson,\n——————\n  1 Federal Defender Services of Eastern Tennessee is a nonprofit or\n\nganization established pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, 18\nU. S. C. §3006A(g)(2)(B).\n2                   HARBISON v. BELL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nNo. M1987–00072–SC–DPE–DD (per curiam), 2006 Tenn.\nLexis 1236, at *3 (2006). Thereafter, Harbison’s federally\nappointed counsel moved to expand the authorized scope\nof her representation to include state clemency proceed\nings. Relying on Circuit precedent construing 18 U. S. C.\n§3599, which provides for the appointment of federal\ncounsel, the District Court denied the motion, and the\nCourt of Appeals affirmed. 503 F. 3d 566 (CA6 2007).\n  We granted certiorari, 554 U. S. ___ (2008), to decide\ntwo questions: (1) whether a certificate of appealability\n(COA) is required to appeal an order denying a request for\nfederally appointed counsel pursuant to §3599, and (2)\nwhether §3599(e)’s reference to “proceedings for executive\nor other clemency as may be available to the defendant”\nencompasses state clemency proceedings. We conclude\nthat a COA is not necessary and that §3599 authorizes\nfederally appointed counsel to represent clients in state\nclemency proceedings.\n                              I\n  We first consider whether Harbison was required to\nobtain a COA to appeal the District Court’s order. The\nState of Tennessee and the United States as amicus curiae\nagree with Harbison that he was not.\n  The District Court’s denial of Harbison’s motion to\nauthorize his federal counsel to represent him in state\nclemency proceedings was clearly an appealable order\nunder 28 U. S. C. §1291. See, e.g., McFarland v. Scott, 512\nU. S. 849 (1994) (reviewing the Court of Appeals’ judg\nment denying a petition for the appointment of counsel\npursuant to the statute now codified at 18 U. S. C. §3599).\nThe question is whether Harbison’s failure to obtain a\nCOA pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §2253(c)(1)(A) deprived the\nCourt of Appeals of jurisdiction over the appeal.\n  Section 2253(c)(1)(A) provides that unless a circuit\njustice or judge issues a COA, an appeal may not be taken\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom “the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in\nwhich the detention complained of arises out of process\nissued by a State court.” This provision governs final\norders that dispose of the merits of a habeas corpus pro\nceeding—a proceeding challenging the lawfulness of the\npetitioner’s detention. See generally Slack v. McDaniel,\n529 U. S. 473, 484–485 (2000); Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544\nU. S. 74, 78–83 (2005). An order that merely denies a\nmotion to enlarge the authority of appointed counsel (or\nthat denies a motion for appointment of counsel) is not\nsuch an order and is therefore not subject to the COA\nrequirement.\n                             II\n  The central question presented by this case is whether\n18 U. S. C. §3599 authorizes counsel appointed to repre\nsent a state petitioner in 28 U. S. C. §2254 proceedings to\nrepresent him in subsequent state clemency proceedings.\nAlthough Tennessee takes no position on this question, the\nGovernment defends the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nthat the statute does not authorize such representation.\n  We begin with the language of the statute. Section\n3599, titled “Counsel for financially unable defendants,”\nprovides for the appointment of counsel for two classes of\nindigents, described, respectively, in subsections (a)(1) and\n(a)(2).

We are persuaded by his\nargument.\n   Under a straightforward reading of the statute, subsec\ntion (a)(2) triggers the appointment of counsel for habeas\npetitioners, and subsection (e) governs the scope of ap\npointed counsel’s duties. See §3599(a)(2) (stating that\nhabeas petitioners challenging a death sentence shall be\nentitled to “the furnishing of . . . services in accordance\nwith subsections (b) through (f)”). Thus, once federally\nfunded counsel is appointed to represent a state prisoner\nin §2254 proceedings, she “shall also represent the defen\ndant in such . . . proceedings for executive or other clem\nency as may be available to the defendant.” §3599(e).\nBecause state clemency proceedings are “available” to\nstate petitioners who obtain representation pursuant to\nsubsection (a)(2), the statutory language indicates that\nappointed counsel’s authorized representation includes\nsuch proceedings.\n   The Government contends that, fairly read, the statute\nas a whole is intended to furnish representation only in\nfederal proceedings and that all proceedings listed in\nsubsection (e), including clemency proceedings, should be\nunderstood to be federal. The absence of the word “fed\neral” in this subsection is not dispositive, it maintains,\nbecause subsection (a)(1) likewise does not use the word\n“federal” yet the parties agree that provision concerns only\nfederal defendants. Just as “federal” is implied by context\nin subsection (a)(1), so too, the Government says, is it\nimplied in subsection (e). According to the Government,\n6                        HARBISON v. BELL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe repeated use of the word “available” supports this\nreading: Congress contemplated that not all catalogued\nproceedings would be available to any given client,\nand clemency proceedings are simply not available to\nstate petitioners because they are ineligible for federal\nclemency.\n   The Government’s argument is not convincing. Subsec\ntion (a)(1) is properly understood as describing federal\ndefendants because the statute is primarily concerned\nwith federal criminal actions3 and (a)(1) includes no lan\nguage suggesting that it applies more broadly. By con\ntrast, subsection (a)(2) refers to state litigants, and it in\nturn provides that subsection (e) applies to such litigants.\nThere is therefore no basis for assuming that Congress\nintended “proceedings for executive or other clemency as\nmay be available to the defendant” in subsection (e) to\nindicate only federal clemency.\n   To the contrary, the reference to “proceedings for execu\ntive or other clemency,” §3599(e) (emphasis added), reveals\nthat Congress intended to include state clemency proceed\nings within the statute’s reach.4 Federal clemency is\nexclusively executive: Only the President has the power to\ngrant clemency for offenses under federal law. U. S.\nConst., Art. II, §2, cl. 1.5 By contrast, the States adminis\n——————\n  3 As we discuss below, §3599 was originally enacted as part of a stat\n\nute creating a new federal capital offense, Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988,\n§7001(b), 102 Stat. 4388, and it is now codified in Title 18, which\nprincipally addresses federal criminal proceedings.\n  4 JUSTICE SCALIA argues that subsection (e), including the reference to\n\n“other clemency,” was drafted to apply only to federal defendants, but\nthis is not correct, as we discuss infra, at 10–12.\n  5 The Government suggests that Congress might have referred to\n\n“other clemency” to encompass the Executive’s use of other persons to\nassist him in reviewing clemency applications. But as the Government\nconcedes, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 43—and as Members of Congress would\nhave known—regardless of what assistance the President seeks, the\nfederal proceeding is one for executive clemency under the Constitu\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nter clemency in a variety of ways. See, e.g., Ga. Const.,\nArt. IV, §2 (independent board has clemency authority);\nNev. Const., Art. 5, §14 (governor, supreme court justices,\nand attorney general share clemency power); Fla. Const.,\nArt. IV, §8 (legislature has clemency authority for trea\nsonous offenses); McLaughlin v. Bronson, 206 Conn. 267,\n271, 537 A. 2d 1004, 1006–1007 (1988) (“In Connecticut,\nthe pardoning power is vested in the legislature, which\nhas delegated its exercise to the board of pardons” (cita\ntion omitted)). Congress’ reference to “other clemency”\nthus does not refer to federal clemency but instead encom\npasses the various forms of state clemency.6\n   The Government’s reliance on the word “available” is\nalso misplaced. While it maintains that Congress’ re\npeated use of the word shows that various §3599(e) proce\ndures do not apply to particular indigents, the term in\nstead indicates the breadth of the representation\ncontemplated. The directive that counsel “shall represent\nthe defendant throughout every subsequent stage of avail\nable judicial proceedings, including . . . all available post\nconviction process,” for example, hardly suggests a limita\ntion on the scope of representation.\n   The Government is correct that appointed counsel is not\n——————\ntion.\n   6 We also note that the Government’s proposal to read the word “fed\n\neral” into §3599(e) would lead to absurd results. It is clear, for exam\nple, that a state inmate faced with an imminent execution might be\nrequired to apply for a stay from a state court before seeking such relief\nin a federal court. On our reading of the statute, federally appointed\ncounsel would be permitted to represent her client pursuant to subsec\ntion (e)’s reference to “applications for stays of execution and other\nappropriate motions and procedures.” But on the Government’s read\ning, the inmate would have to secure new counsel to file the stay\nrequest because his federal counsel would not be authorized to repre\nsent him. Such a rigid limit on the authority of appointed federal\ncounsel would be inconsistent with the basic purpose of the statute. Cf.\nMcFarland v. Scott, 512 U. S. 849, 854–857 (1994).\n8                    HARBISON v. BELL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nexpected to provide each service enumerated in subsection\n(e) for every client. But that limitation does not follow\nfrom the word “available”; it follows from the word “subse\nquent” and the organization of subsection (e) to mirror the\nordinary course of proceedings for capital defendants.\nCounsel’s responsibilities commence at a different part of\nsubsection (e) depending on whether she is appointed\npursuant to subsection (a)(1)(A), (a)(1)(B), or (a)(2). When\nshe is appointed pursuant to (a)(1)(A), she is charged with\nrepresenting her client in all listed proceedings. When she\nis appointed pursuant to (a)(1)(B) (i.e., after the entry of a\nfederal death sentence), her representation begins with\n“appeals.” And when she is appointed pursuant to (a)(2),\nher representation begins with the §2254 or §2255 “post\nconviction process.” Thus, counsel’s representation in\ncludes only those judicial proceedings transpiring “subse\nquent” to her appointment. It is the sequential organiza\ntion of the statute and the term “subsequent” that\ncircumscribe counsel’s representation, not a strict division\nbetween federal and state proceedings.\n                             III\n   In an attempt to overcome the plain language of §3599,\nthe Government advances two additional arguments that\nmerit discussion. First, it contends that a literal reading\nof subsection (e) would lead to unacceptable results: It\nwould require a federal lawyer who obtained relief for her\nclient in §2254 proceedings to continue to represent him\nduring his state retrial; similarly, it would require federal\ncounsel to represent her client in any state habeas pro\nceeding following her appointment. Second, the Govern\nment claims that the statute’s legislative history shows\nthat Congress did not intend to include state clemency\nproceedings within §3599(e)’s coverage. Neither argument\nis persuasive.\n   The Government suggests that reading §3599(e) to\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nauthorize federally funded counsel for state clemency\nproceedings would require a lawyer who succeeded in\nsetting aside a state death sentence during postconviction\nproceedings to represent her client during an ensuing\nstate retrial. We do not read subsection (e) to apply to\nstate-court proceedings that follow the issuance of a fed\neral writ of habeas corpus. When a retrial occurs after\npostconviction relief, it is not properly understood as a\n“subsequent stage” of judicial proceedings but rather as\nthe commencement of new judicial proceedings. Moreover,\nsubsection (a)(2) provides for counsel only when a state\npetitioner is unable to obtain adequate representation.\nStates are constitutionally required to provide trial coun\nsel for indigent defendants. Thus, when a state prisoner\nis granted a new trial following §2254 proceedings, his\nstate-furnished representation renders him ineligible for\n§3599 counsel until the commencement of new §2254\nproceedings.\n   The Government likewise argues that our reading of\n§3599(e) would require federally funded counsel to repre\nsent her client in any state habeas proceeding occurring\nafter her appointment because such proceedings are also\n“available post-conviction process.” But as we have previ\nously noted, subsection (e) authorizes counsel to represent\nher client in “subsequent” stages of available judicial\nproceedings. State habeas is not a stage “subsequent” to\nfederal habeas. Just the opposite: Petitioners must ex\nhaust their claims in state court before seeking federal\nhabeas relief. See §2254(b)(1). That state postconviction\nlitigation sometimes follows the initiation of federal ha\nbeas because a petitioner has failed to exhaust does not\nchange the order of proceedings contemplated by the\nstatute.7\n——————\n  7 Pursuant to §3599(e)’s provision that counsel may represent her client\n\nin “other appropriate motions and procedures,” a district court may\n10                       HARBISON v. BELL\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  The Government also argues that §3599(e) should not be\ninterpreted as including state-clemency proceedings be\ncause it was drafted to apply only to federal defendants.\nSection 3599 was originally enacted as part of the Anti-\nDrug Abuse Act of 1988, §7001(b), 102 Stat. 4388 (codified\nat 21 U. S. C. §§848(q)(4)–(10)), which created a federal\ncapital offense of drug-related homicide. In 2006, the\ndeath penalty procedures specified in that Act were re\npealed and recodified without change at 18 U. S. C. §3599.\nBased on the 1988 legislative history, the Government\nargues that subsection (e) was not written to apply to state\npetitioners at all. In its telling, the subsection was drafted\nwhen the bill covered only federal defendants; state liti\ngants were added, by means of what is now subsection\n(a)(2), just a few hours before the bill passed in rushed\nend-of-session proceedings; and Congress simply did not\nattend to the fact that this amendment applied what is\nnow subsection (e) to state litigants.\n  While the legislative history is regrettably thin, the\nevidence that is available does not support the Govern\nment’s argument. State petitioners were a part of the\nAnti-Drug Abuse Act from the first day the House of Rep\nresentatives took up the bill. In the amendment authoriz\ning the death penalty for drug-related homicides, Repre\nsentative George Gekas included a provision that closely\nresembles the current §3599(a)(2): “In any post-conviction\nproceeding under section 2254 or 2255 of title 28, United\nStates Code, seeking to vacate or set aside a death sen\ntence, the court shall appoint counsel to represent any\ndefendant who is or becomes financially unable to obtain\nadequate representation.” 134 Cong. Rec. 22984 (1988)\n\n——————\ndetermine on a case-by-case basis that it is appropriate for federal\ncounsel to exhaust a claim in the course of her federal habeas represen\ntation. This is not the same as classifying state habeas proceedings as\n“available post-conviction process” within the meaning of the statute.\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n(emphasis added).\n   Following passage of the Gekas amendment, Represen\ntative John Conyers proposed replacing its provisions on\nappellate and collateral process (including the above\nquoted provision) with language comprising the provisions\nnow codified at §§3599(a)(1), (b), (c), and (e). Because his\namendment introduced the §3599(e) language and did not\nrefer specifically to §2254 proceedings, the Government\nand JUSTICE SCALIA argue that Representative Conyers\ndrafted subsection (e) to apply only to federal defendants.\nBut his floor statements evince his particular concern for\nstate prisoners. He explained that his amendment filed a\ngap because “[w]hile State courts appoint lawyers for\nindigent defendants, there is no legal representation\nautomatically provided once the case i[s] appealed to the\nFederal level.” Id., at 22996.8 He then cited discussions\nby the Chief Judge of the Eleventh Circuit and the\nNAACP devoted exclusively to errors found by federal\ncourts during habeas corpus review of state capital cases.\nIbid.\n   In the Senate, Representative Conyers’ language was\nfirst replaced with Representative Gekas’ provision for\ncounsel for §2254 and §2255 petitioners, and then a sub\nsequent amendment substituted the text of the Conyers\namendment. See id., at 30401, 30746. Thereafter, the\nHouse amended the bill a final time to insert the language\nnow codified at §3599(a)(2) while leaving the Conyers\n——————\n   8 Despite his reference to “defendants” and “appealed,” Representa\n\ntive Conyers was clearly discussing state prisoners seeking federal\nhabeas relief. Representative Gekas’ amendment similarly referred to\npostconviction litigants as “defendants,” and the relevant portion of his\namendment was titled “Appeal in Capital Cases” even though it incor\nporated §2254 and §2255 proceedings. 134 Cong. Rec. 22984. As\ncodified, §3599(a)(2) likewise uses the term “defendant” to refer to\nhabeas petitioners. The Government is incorrect to suggest that the\nstatute’s use of this term illustrates that it was not written to apply to\npostconviction litigants.\n12                         HARBISON v. BELL\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nlanguage in place. See id., at 33215. The Government\nargues that this late amendment marked the first occasion\non which state prisoners were brought within the bill’s\ncompass. But Representative Gekas’ initial amendment\nexplicitly referenced §2254 petitioners, and Representative\nConyers’ proposal sought to provide additional protections\nfor all capital defendants. The House’s final amendment\nis therefore best understood not as altering the bill’s scope,\nbut as clarifying it.\n   The Government’s arguments about §3599’s history and\npurposes are laced with the suggestion that Congress\nsimply would not have intended to fund clemency counsel\nfor indigent state prisoners because clemency proceedings\nare a matter of grace entirely distinct from judicial pro\nceedings.9     As this Court has recognized, however,\n“[c]lemency is deeply rooted in our Anglo-American tradi\ntion of law, and is the historic remedy for preventing\nmiscarriages of justice where judicial process has been\nexhausted.” Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390, 411–412\n(1993) (footnote omitted). Far from regarding clemency as\na matter of mercy alone, we have called it “the ‘fail safe’ in\nour criminal justice system.” Id., at 415.10\n——————\n   9 The Government also submits that providing federally funded coun\n\nsel for state clemency proceedings would raise “unique federalism\nconcerns.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 31. But Tennes\nsee’s position belies that claim. Following other States that have\nlitigated the question, Tennessee has expressed “no view” on the\nstatute’s scope because it “has no real stake in whether an inmate\nreceives federal funding for clemency counsel.” Brief for Respondent 7;\nsee also Brief for Current and Former Governors as Amici Curiae 18\n(“Contrary to the view of the Solicitor General . . . , the fact that counsel\nis appointed by a federal court does not reflect an intrusion on state\nsovereignty”).\n   10 See also Kansas v.

Moreover, Congress’ sequential\nenumeration suggests an awareness that clemency pro\nceedings are not as divorced from judicial proceedings as\nthe Government submits. Subsection (e) emphasizes\ncontinuity of counsel, and Congress likely appreciated that\nfederal habeas counsel are well positioned to represent\ntheir clients in the state clemency proceedings that typi\ncally follow the conclusion of §2254 litigation.\n   Indeed, as the history of this case demonstrates, the\nwork of competent counsel during habeas corpus represen\ntation may provide the basis for a persuasive clemency\napplication. Harbison’s federally appointed counsel devel\noped extensive information about his life history and\ncognitive impairments that was not presented during his\ntrial or appeals. She also litigated a claim under Brady v.\nMaryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), based on police records\nthat had been suppressed for 14 years. One Court of\nAppeals judge concluded that the nondisclosure of these\nrecords “undermine[d] confidence in Harbison’s guilty\nverdict” because the evidence contained therein could have\nsupported a colorable defense that a third party murdered\nthe victim and that Harbison’s codefendant falsely impli\ncated him. 408 F. 3d, at 840 (Clay, J., dissenting).

Mullin, 436 F. 3d 1168\n(CA10 2006) (en banc). In authorizing federally funded\ncounsel to represent their state clients in clemency pro\nceedings, Congress ensured that no prisoner would be put\nto death without meaningful access to the “ ‘fail-safe’ ” of\nour justice system.

S. C.\n§3599(a)(2) entitles indigent federal habeas petitioners to\nappointed counsel “in accordance with” subsection (e).\nSubsection (e) specifies that the appointed counsel “shall\nrepresent the defendant throughout every subsequent\nstage of available judicial proceedings . . . and shall also\nrepresent the defendant in such . . . proceedings for execu\ntive or other clemency as may be available to the defen\ndant.” Nothing in the text of §3599(e) excludes proceed\nings for available state clemency, and, as the Court points\nout, there are good reasons to expect federal habeas coun\nsel to carry on through state clemency proceedings. See\nante, at 12–14.\n   At the same time, the “plain language of §3599,” ante, at\n8, does not fully resolve this case. The obligation in sub\nsection (e) that the appointed counsel represent the defen\ndant in “every subsequent stage of available judicial pro\nceedings” is not on its face limited to “federal” proceedings,\njust as there is no such limitation with respect to clem\nency. Yet it is highly unlikely that Congress intended\nfederal habeas petitioners to keep their federal counsel\nduring subsequent state judicial proceedings. See Hain v.\nMullin, 436 F. 3d 1168, 1178 (CA10 2006) (Briscoe, J.,\ndissenting) (“[I]t cannot seriously be suggested that Con\n2                     HARBISON v. BELL\n\n              ROBERTS, C.

But fortunately the best reading of the\nstatute avoids the problem: Section 3599(e)’s reference to\n“subsequent stage[s] of available judicial proceedings”\ndoes not include state judicial proceedings after federal\nhabeas, because those are more properly regarded as new\njudicial proceedings.\n  The meaning of that phrase is not entirely plain, but it\nis plain that not every lawsuit involving an inmate that\narises after the federal habeas proceeding is included.\nSurely “subsequent stage[s]” do not include, for example, a\nchallenge to prison conditions or a suit for divorce in state\ncourt, even if these available judicial proceedings occur\nsubsequent to federal habeas. That must be because these\nare new proceedings rather than “subsequent stage[s]” of\nthe proceedings for which federal counsel is available.\nOnce it is acknowledged that Congress has drawn a line at\nsome point, this is the “best reading” of the statutory\nlanguage.

S. C. §2253(c)(1)(A), a certifi\ncate of appealability was not required to seek appellate\nreview of the issue in this case. See ante, at 2–3; see also\npost, at 1 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart). I further agree with the Court that 18 U. S. C.\n§§3599(a)(2) and (e) entitle eligible state postconviction\nlitigants to federally funded counsel in available state\nclemency proceedings. See ante, at 2, 5. As even JUSTICE\nSCALIA acknowledges in his dissenting opinion, the statute\n“contains no express language limiting its application to\nproceedings in a federal forum.” Post, at 8; see also ante,\nat 1 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment) (“Nothing in\nthe text of §3599(e) excludes proceedings for available\nstate clemency . . .”). By its express terms, the statute\n“entitle[s]” eligible litigants to appointed counsel who\n“shall represent the defendant . . . in such . . . proceedings\nfor executive or other clemency as may be available to the\ndefendant.” §§3599(a)(2), (e). Because the statute applies\nto individuals challenging either state or federal convic\ntions, see §3599(a)(2), and because state clemency is the\nonly clemency available to those challenging state convic\ntions, §§3599(a)(2) and (e) necessarily entitle eligible state\npostconviction litigants to federally funded counsel in\nstate clemency proceedings.\n2                    HARBISON v. BELL\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   I disagree, however, with the assumption that §3599\nmust be limited to “federal” proceedings in at least some\nrespects. Ante, at 6; ante, at 1–2 (ROBERTS, C. J., concur\nring in judgment); post, at 3–4. The majority and dissent\nread such a limitation into subsection (a)(1) of the statute.\nBut that subsection, like subsection (a)(2), “contains no\nlanguage limiting its application to federal capital defen\ndants. It provides counsel to indigent defendants in ‘every\ncriminal action in which a defendant is charged with a\ncrime which may be punishable by death.’ ” Post, at 3\n(quoting §3599(a)(1)). The majority, then, compounds its\nerror by attempting to discern some distinction between\nsubsections (a)(1) and (a)(2), to which it properly declines\nto add an extratextual “federal” limitation, see ante, at 5–\n6. The dissent seizes on this inconsistency between the\nmajority’s interpretation of subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2),\nbut responds by incorrectly reading a parallel “federal”\nlimitation into subsection (a)(2), see post, at 3–4. In the\ndissent’s view, “it is perfectly reasonable to assume” that\nsubsection (a)(2) is limited to federal postconviction pro\nceedings—including clemency proceedings—“even where\nthe statute contains no such express limitation.” Post, at\n3.\n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE, in contrast, finds a “federal” limita\ntion in a clause of subsection (e) that is not before this\nCourt in order to cabin the reach of today’s decision. He\nobserves that the text of subsection (e) includes no “fed\neral” limitation with respect to any of the proceedings\nlisted in that subsection. But THE CHIEF JUSTICE finds a\nway to avoid this “problematic result” by adding a differ\nent limitation to §3599. In his view, the “best” reading of\nthe phrase “subsequent stage[s] of available judicial pro\nceedings” is one that excludes “state judicial proceedings\nafter federal habeas” proceedings because they are\n“new”—not “subsequent”—judicial proceedings. Ante, at 2.\nWithout this limitation, THE CHIEF JUSTICE explains, “[he]\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

Ante, at\n1–2.\n   This Court is not tasked with interpreting §3599 in a\nway that it believes is consistent with the policy outcome\nintended by Congress. Nor should this Court’s approach\nto statutory construction be influenced by the supposition\nthat “it is highly unlikely that Congress intended” a given\nresult. See ante, at 1 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judg\nment). Congress’ intent is found in the words it has cho\nsen to use. See West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v.\nCasey, 499 U. S. 83, 98 (1991) (“The best evidence of [Con\ngress’] purpose is the statutory text adopted by both\nHouses of Congress and submitted to the President”).\nThis Court’s interpretive function requires it to identify\nand give effect to the best reading of the words in the\nprovision at issue. Even if the proper interpretation of a\nstatute upholds a “very bad policy,” it “is not within our\nprovince to second-guess” the “wisdom of Congress’ action”\nby picking and choosing our preferred interpretation from\namong a range of potentially plausible, but likely inaccu\nrate, interpretations of a statute. Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537\nU. S. 186, 222 (2003); see also TVA v. Hill, 437 U. S. 153,\n194 (1978) (“Our individual appraisal of the wisdom or\nunwisdom of a particular course consciously selected by\nthe Congress is to be put aside in the process of interpret\ning a statute”). “Our task is to apply the text, not to im\nprove upon it.” Pavelic & LeFlore v. Marvel Entertainment\nGroup, Div. of Cadence Industries Corp., 493 U. S. 120,\n126 (1989).\n   This statute’s silence with respect to a “federal” limita\ntion in no way authorizes us to assume that such a limita\ntion must be read into subsections (a) and (e) in order to\n4                    HARBISON v. BELL\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nblunt the slippery-slope policy arguments of those opposed\nto a plain-meaning construction of the provisions under\nreview, see ante, at 8–9. And Congress’ silence certainly\ndoes not empower us to go even farther and incorporate\nsuch an assumption into the text of these provisions. Post,\nat 7–8. Moreover, the Court should not decide a question\nirrelevant to this case in order to pre-empt the “problem\natic” results that might arise from a plain-text reading of\nthe statutory provision under review. See ante, at 2\n(ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment). Whether or not\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE’s construction of the “subsequent\nstage of available judicial proceedings” clause of subsec\ntion (e) is correct, it is irrelevant to the proper interpreta\ntion of the clemency clause of subsection (e). Even if the\nstatute were to authorize federal postconviction counsel to\nappear in state proceedings other than state clemency\nproceedings, a question not resolved by today’s decision,\nthat conclusion would not provide a legitimate basis for\nadopting the dissent’s atextual interpretation of the clem\nency clause of subsection (e). The “best” interpretation of\nthe clemency clause does not turn on the unresolved\nbreadth of the “subsequent stage of available judicial\nproceedings” clause.\n   Rather, the Court must adopt the interpretation of the\nstatute that is most faithful to its text. Here, the absence\nof a “federal” limitation in the text of subsections (a) and\n(e) of §3599 most logically suggests that these provisions\nare not limited to federal clemency proceedings. “If Con\ngress enacted into law something different from what it\nintended, then it should amend the statute to conform it to\nits intent. It is beyond our province to rescue Congress\nfrom its drafting errors, and to provide for what we might\nthink is the preferred result. ” Lamie v. United States\nTrustee, 540 U.

S. C.\n§2253(c)(1)(A) before appealing the District Court’s denial\nof his motion to expand counsel’s appointment. See ante,\nat 2–3. I do not agree, however, that 18 U. S. C. §3599\ngives state prisoners federally funded counsel to pursue\nstate clemency. While purporting to adopt a “straightfor\nward reading of the statute,” ante at 5, the Court in fact\nselectively amends the statute—inserting words in some\nplaces, twisting their meaning elsewhere. Because the\nstatute is most naturally and coherently read to provide\nfederally funded counsel to capital defendants appearing\nin a federal forum, I would affirm the decision of the Sixth\nCircuit and hold that Harbison was not entitled to feder\nally funded counsel to pursue state clemency.\n                            I\n Title 18 U. S. C. §3599(a)(2) provides for the appoint\nment of counsel as follows:\n    “In any post conviction proceeding under section 2254\n    or 2255 of title 28, United States Code, seeking to va\n    cate or set aside a death sentence, any defendant who\n    is or becomes financially unable to obtain adequate\n2                    HARBISON v.

And the sec\nond of them, without any express qualification, provides\nfor counsel’s continued representation through “such . . .\nproceedings for executive or other clemency as may be\navailable to the defendant,” which in petitioner’s case\nwould include state clemency proceedings. The Court thus\nconcludes that the statute’s “plain language” provides\nHarbison federally funded counsel to represent him in\nstate clemency proceedings. Ante, at 5.\n  But the Court quickly abandons its allegedly “plain”\nreading of the statute when it confronts the subsection\nthat precedes these two, which provides:\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n    “Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the\n    contrary, in every criminal action in which a defen\n    dant is charged with a crime which may be punishable\n    by death, a defendant who is or becomes financially\n    unable to obtain adequate representation or investiga\n    tive, expert, or other reasonably necessary services at\n    any time either–\n       “(A) before judgment; or\n       “(B) after the entry of a judgment imposing a\n    sentence of death but before the execution of that\n    judgment;\n    “shall be entitled to the appointment of one or more\n    attorneys and the furnishing of such other services in\n    accordance with subsections (b) through (f).”\n    §3599(a)(1).\nThe Court states that “(a)(1) describes federal capital\ndefendants.” Ante, at 4. But according to the Court’s\nmode of analysis, that is not so. Subsection (a)(1), like\nsubsection (e), contains no language limiting its applica\ntion to federal capital defendants. It provides counsel to\nindigent defendants in “every criminal action in which a\ndefendant is charged with a crime which may be punish\nable by death.” §3599(a)(1) (emphasis added). Why, then,\nis subsection (a)(1) limited to federal capital defendants?\nBecause, as the Court notes, “the statute is primarily\nconcerned with federal criminal actions and (a)(1) includes\nno language suggesting that it applies more broadly.”\nAnte, at 6 (footnote omitted).\n   Quite right. Section 3599 was enacted as part of a bill\nthat created a new federal capital offense, see ibid., n. 3,\nand it is perfectly reasonable to assume that a federal\nstatute, providing federally funded counsel, applies in\nfederal proceedings only, even where the statute contains\nno such express limitation. Cf. Barron ex rel. Tiernan v.\nMayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243, 247–248 (1833). But there\n4                    HARBISON v. BELL\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nis no basis for adopting that reading with respect to only\nhalf the statute. If subsection (a)(1) is limited to federal\nproceedings, then subsection (e), which likewise contains\nno express federal limitation, is similarly limited. We\ncannot give the same silence (omission of the limiting\nword “federal”) in adjacent and simultaneously enacted\nsubsections of the same law (§3599) divergent meanings.\n   The Court advances two arguments for reading subsec\ntion (e) more broadly. First, it claims that unlike subsec\ntion (a)(1), “subsection (a)(2) refers to state litigants.”\nAnte, at 6. It most certainly does not. It refers to proceed\nings under §2254 and §2255—proceedings under federal\nstatutes providing federal causes of action in federal court.\nRead together, subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) provide feder\nally funded counsel for persons convicted of capital crimes\nwho are appearing in federal court. Subsection (a)(2)\nneither undermines the Court’s earlier statement that\n“the statute’s primary focus is federal” proceedings, nor\ngives the Court license to insert words selectively into the\nstatutory text.\n   The Court next reasons that the phrase “executive or\nother clemency” suggests that subsection (e) includes state\nclemency proceedings. Since (the argument goes) federal\nclemency is exclusively executive, the word “other” must\nrefer to state clemency, or else it would be superfluous.\nBut the drafting history, which the Court thinks relevant,\nante, at 10–11, defeats the inference the Court wishes to\ndraw. The current text of subsection (e) first appeared in\na version of the bill that included what is now subsection\n(a)(1) (which the Court concedes deals only with federal\nproceedings), but not subsection (a)(2) (which the Court\nwould deem applicable to state proceedings). 134 Cong.\nRec. 22995 (1988). In other words, at the time of its intro\nduction, subsection (e) applied only to federal defendants,\nand the phrase “or other clemency” was unquestionably\nsuperfluous.\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n   In any event, the Court’s reading places a great deal of\nweight on avoiding superfluity in a statute that is already\nteeming with superfluity. Item: Subsection (a)(2) need\nlessly refers to §2255 proceedings even though subsections\n(a)(1) and (e) taken together would provide federal capital\ndefendants with counsel in §2255 proceedings. Item:\nSubsection (a)(2) provides counsel “in accordance with\nsubsections (b) through (f)” even though subsections (b)\nand (c) have no conceivable relevance to subsection (a)(2).*\nItem: Subsection (e) provides counsel “throughout every\nsubsequent stage of available judicial proceedings,” includ\ning “all available post-conviction process” (emphasis\nadded). The first use of the term “available” is already of\ndubious value (is counsel expected to represent a defen\ndant in unavailable proceedings?) but its needless repeti\ntion is inexplicable. In a statute that is such a paragon of\nshoddy draftsmanship, relying upon the superfluity of “or\nother” to extend the statute’s application from federal to\nstate proceedings is quite absurd—and doubly absurd\nwhen that extension is illogically limited to the subsection\nin which “or other” appears.\n                            II\n  The Court’s reading of subsection (e) faces a second\nsubstantial difficulty. Subsection (e) provides that coun\nsel, once appointed,\n     “shall represent the defendant throughout every sub\n     sequent stage of available judicial proceedings, includ\n     ing pretrial proceedings, trial, sentencing, motions for\n——————\n  * Subsection (b) details the requisite qualifications for a lawyer ap\npointed “before judgment”; but appointments under subsection (a)(2)\nare made only after judgment. Subsection (c) requires that a lawyer\nappointed after judgment have been “admitted to practice in the court\nof appeals for not less than five years” (emphasis added); but the\npostconviction proceedings dealt with by subsection (a)(2) take place in\nfederal district court.\n6                    HARBISON v. BELL\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n    new trial, appeals, applications for writ of certiorari to\n    the Supreme Court of the United States, and all\n    available post-conviction process, together with appli\n    cations for stays of execution and other appropriate\n    motions and procedures.” §3599(e).\nIn other words, once counsel is appointed under (a)(2),\npetitioner is entitled to federal counsel “throughout every\nsubsequent stage of available judicial proceedings.” The\nGovernment argues that, if subsection (e) is not limited to\nfederal proceedings, then a §2254 petitioner who obtains\nfederally funded counsel will retain that counsel, at fed\neral expense, in all “subsequent” state-court proceedings,\nincluding the retrial that follows the grant of federal\nhabeas relief. The Court disagrees, on the ground that a\nnew trial represents the “commencement of new judicial\nproceedings.” Ante, at 9.\n   I need not enter that controversy. What is clear, at\nleast, is that (if subsection (e) includes state proceedings)\nfederally funded counsel would have to represent petition\ners in subsequent state habeas proceedings. The Court\ntries to split the baby here, conceding that “a district court\nmay determine on a case-by-case basis that it is appropri\nate for federal counsel to exhaust [in state court] a claim\nin the course of her federal habeas representation.” Ante,\nat 9–10, n. 7. The Court tries to derive this discretionary\nauthority from subsection (e)’s provision for representation\nby federal counsel in “other appropriate motions and\nprocedures.” §3599(e) (emphasis added). But that provi\nsion is in addition to, rather than in limitation of, subsec\ntion (e)’s unqualified statement that counsel “shall repre\nsent the defendant throughout every subsequent stage of\navailable judicial proceedings, including . . . all available\npost-conviction process.” The provision then continues:\n“together with applications for stays of execution and other\nappropriate motions and procedures.” (Emphasis added.)\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nThere is no way in which this can be read to limit the\nrequirement that counsel represent the defendant in\n“every subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings,”\nwhich would include habeas proceedings in state court.\n   The Court seeks to avoid this conclusion by saying that\n“[s]tate habeas is not a stage ‘subsequent’ to federal ha\nbeas,” because “[p]etitioners must exhaust their claims in\nstate court before seeking federal habeas relief.” Ante, at\n9. This is a breathtaking denial of reality, confusing what\nshould be with what is. It is rather like saying that mur\nder does not exist because the law forbids it. To be sure,\npetitioners are supposed to complete state postconviction\nproceedings before pursuing relief in federal court. But\nthey often do not do so, and when they do not our opinions\npermit them to seek stays or dismissals of their §2254\npetitions in order that they may thereafter (subsequently)\nreturn to state court to exhaust their claims. See Rhines\nv. Weber, 544 U. S. 269, 277–278 (2005); Pliler v. Ford, 542\nU. S. 225, 228 (2004). Additionally, inmates may—as\npetitioner did in this case—file successive state habeas\npetitions after §2254 proceedings are complete. See Har\nbison v. State, No. E2004–00885–CCA–R28–PD, 2005 WL\n1521910, *1 (Tenn. Crim. App., June 27, 2005). These\nsubsequent state proceedings are not rare but common\nplace, and it is inconceivable (if state proceedings are\ncovered) that subsection (e) does not refer to them. In\ndeed, one would think that subsection (e) refers especially\nto them. And what kind of an incoherent statute would it\nbe that allows counsel for de-facto-subsequent federal\nhabeas claims that should have been brought earlier (see\n§3599(a)(2)) but does not allow counsel for subsequent\nstate habeas claims that have the same defect?\n   If §3599(e) includes state proceedings (as the Court\nholds), and if “subsequent” is given its proper scope\n(rather than the tortured one adopted by the Court)—then\n§3599(a)(2)’s limitation of federally provided counsel to\n8                    HARBISON v. BELL\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nonly federal habeas proceedings would amount to a dead\nletter. A capital convict could file for federal habeas with\nout first exhausting state postconviction remedies, obtain\na stay or dismissal of that federal petition, and return to\nstate court along with his federally funded lawyer. In\ndeed, under our decision in McFarland v. Scott, 512 U. S.\n849 (1994), he need not even file an unexhausted federal\nhabeas petition; he can file a stand-alone “motion request\ning the appointment of habeas counsel,” id., at 859, and\nobtain federally funded counsel that he can then take back\nfor the subsequent state proceedings. The question per\nsists: Why would §3599(a)(2) provide counsel in only fed\neral habeas proceedings, when §3599(e) makes it so easy\nto obtain federally funded counsel for state habeas pro\nceedings as well?\n                         *    *    *\n  Concededly, §3599 contains no express language limit\ning its application to proceedings in a federal forum. And\nyet Harbison, the Government, and the Court all read part\nof that section to refer to federal proceedings only. The\nCourt’s refusal to extend that limitation to the entirety of\n§3599 is untenable. It lacks a textual basis and has the\nadditional misfortune of producing absurd results, which\nthe majority attempts to avoid by doing further violence to\nthe statutory text. I would read the statute as providing\nfederal counsel to capital convicts appearing in a federal\nforum, and I accordingly would affirm the judgment of the\nSixth Circuit.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145892/", "sha1": "9ae12db7e537a40c243edcbf173d6a7661db0c25", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-039", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:09:16"}
