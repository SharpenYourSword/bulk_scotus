UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 07–9712. Argued January 14, 2009—Decided March 25, 2009\nIn exchange for petitioner Puckett’s guilty plea, the Government agreed\n  to request (1) a three-level reduction in his offense level under the\n  Federal Sentencing Guidelines on the ground that he had accepted\n  responsibility for his crimes; and (2) a sentence at the low end of the\n  applicable Guidelines range. The District Court accepted the plea,\n  but before Puckett was sentenced he assisted in another crime. As a\n  result, the Government opposed any reduction in Puckett’s offense\n  level, and the District Court denied the three-level reduction. On ap\n  peal, Puckett raised for the first time the argument that by backing\n  away from its reduction request, the Government had broken the\n  plea agreement. The Fifth Circuit found that Puckett had forfeited\n  that claim by failing to raise it below; applied Federal Rule of Crimi\n  nal Procedure Rule 52(b)’s plain-error standard for unpreserved\n  claims of error; and held that, although the error had occurred and\n  was obvious, Puckett had not satisfied the third prong of plain-error\n  analysis in that he failed to demonstrate that his ultimate sentence\n  was affected, especially since the District Judge had found that ac\n  ceptance-of-responsibility reductions for defendants who continued to\n  engage in criminal activity were so rare as “to be unknown.”\nHeld: Rule 52(b)’s plain-error test applies to a forfeited claim, like\n Puckett’s, that the Government failed to meet its obligations under a\n plea agreement, and applies in the usual fashion. Pp. 4–14.\n    (a) In federal criminal cases, Rule 51(b) instructs parties how to\n preserve claims of error: “by informing the court—when [a] ruling . . .\n is made or sought—of the action the party wishes the court to take,\n or the party’s objection to the court’s action and the grounds for that\n objection.” A party’s failure to preserve a claim ordinarily prevents\n him from raising it on appeal, but Rule 52(b) recognizes a limited ex\n2                     PUCKETT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    ception for plain errors. “Plain-error review” involves four prongs: (1)\n    there must be an error or defect that the appellant has not affirma\n    tively waived, United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 732–733; (2) it\n    must be clear or obvious, see id., at 734; (3) it must have affected the\n    appellant’s substantial rights, i.e., “affected the outcome of the dis\n    trict court proceedings,” ibid.; and (4) if the three other prongs are\n    satisfied, the court of appeals has the discretion to remedy the error if\n    it “ ‘seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of\n    judicial proceedings,’ ” id., at 736. The question here is not whether\n    plain-error review applies when a defendant fails to preserve a claim\n    that the Government defaulted on its plea-agreement obligations, but\n    what conceivable reason exists for disregarding its evident applica\n    tion. The breach undoubtedly violates the defendant’s rights, but the\n    defendant has the opportunity to seek vindication of those rights in\n    district court; if he fails to do so, Rule 52(b) as clearly sets forth the\n    consequences for that forfeiture as it does for all others. Pp. 4–6.\n       (b) Neither Puckett’s doctrinal arguments nor the practical consid\n    erations that he raises counsel against applying plain-error review in\n    the present context. The Government’s breach of the plea agreement\n    does not retroactively cause the defendant’s guilty plea to have been\n    unknowing or involuntary. This Court’s decision in Santobello v.\n    New York, 404 U. S. 257, does not govern, since the question whether\n    an error can be found harmless is different from the question\n    whether it can be subjected to plain-error review. Puckett is wrong\n    in contending that no purpose is served by applying plain-error re\n    view: There is much to be gained by inducing the objection to be\n    made at the trial court level, where (among other things) the error\n    can often be remedied. And not all plea breaches will satisfy the doc\n    trine’s four prongs. Pp. 7–14.\n505 F. 3d 377, affirmed.\n\n  SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

S. C. §2113(a), (d), and one\ncount of using a firearm during and in relation to a crime\nof violence, §924(c)(1). He negotiated a plea agreement\nwith the Government, which was filed with the District\nCourt on September 3, 2003. As part of that deal, Puckett\nagreed to plead guilty to both counts, waive his trial\nrights, and cooperate with the Government by being truth\nful regarding his participation in criminal activities. App.\n51a–53a. In exchange, the Government agreed to the\nfollowing two terms:\n    “8. The government agrees that Puckett has demon\n    strated acceptance of responsibility and thereby quali\n2               PUCKETT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    fies for a three-level reduction in his offense level.\n    “9. The government also agrees to request that\n    Puckett’s sentence be placed at the lowest end of the\n    guideline level deemed applicable by the Court.” Id.,\n    at 54a.\n   To satisfy the first of these obligations, the Government\nfiled a motion in the District Court pursuant to §3E1.1 of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission’s Guidelines\nManual (Nov. 2003) (USSG). That provision directs sen\ntencing courts to decrease a defendant’s offense level\nunder the Guidelines by two levels if he “clearly demon\nstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense,” and by\na third level “upon motion of the government stating that\nthe defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation\nor prosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying\nauthorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty.” Two\nweeks later, the District Court held a plea colloquy, see\nFed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(b), and accepted Puckett’s plea.\n   Because of delays due to health problems experienced by\nPuckett, sentencing did not take place for almost three\nyears. In the interim, Puckett assisted another man in a\nscheme to defraud the Postal Service, and confessed that\nassistance (under questioning) to a probation officer. The\nofficer prepared an addendum to Puckett’s presentence\nreport recommending that he receive no §3E1.1 reduction\nfor acceptance of responsibility, on the theory that true\nacceptance of responsibility requires termination of crimi\nnal conduct. See USSG §3E1.1, comment., n. 1(b).\n   When sentencing finally did take place on May 4, 2006,\nPuckett’s counsel objected to the addendum, pointing out\nthat the Government had filed a motion requesting that\nthe full three-level reduction in offense level be granted.\nThe District Judge turned to the prosecutor, who re\nsponded that the motion was filed “a long time ago,” App.\n79a, before Puckett had engaged in the additional criminal\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbehavior. She made clear that the Government opposed\nany reduction in Puckett’s offense level for acceptance of\nresponsibility. The probation officer then added his view\nthat under the Guidelines, a reduction would be improper.\n   After hearing these submissions, the District Judge\nconcluded that even assuming he had the discretion to\ngrant the reduction, he would not do so. “[I]t’s so rare [as]\nto be unknown around here where one has committed a\ncrime subsequent to the crime for which they appear\nbefore the court and for them even then to get the three\npoints.” Id., at 80a–81a. He agreed, however, to follow\nthe recommendation that the Government made, pursuant\nto its commitment in the plea agreement, that Puckett be\nsentenced at the low end of the applicable Guidelines\nrange, which turned out to be 262 months in prison for the\narmed bank robbery and a mandatory minimum consecu\ntive term of 84 months for the firearm crime. Had the\nDistrict Court granted the three-level reduction for accep\ntance of responsibility, the bottom of the Guidelines range\nwould have been 188 months for the robbery; the firearm\nsentence would not have been affected.\n   Importantly, at no time during the exchange did\nPuckett’s counsel object that the Government was violat\ning its obligations under the plea agreement by backing\naway from its request for the reduction. He never cited\nthe relevant provision of the plea agreement. And he did\nnot move to withdraw Puckett’s plea on grounds that the\nGovernment had broken its sentencing promises.\n   On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit, Puckett did argue, inter alia, that the Gov\nernment violated the plea agreement at sentencing. The\nGovernment conceded that by objecting to the reduction\nfor acceptance of responsibility, it had violated the obliga\ntion set forth in paragraph 8 of the agreement, but main\ntained that Puckett had forfeited this claim by failing to\nraise it in the District Court. The Court of Appeals\n4                PUCKETT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nagreed, and applied the plain-error standard that Rule\n52(b) makes applicable to unpreserved claims of error.\n505 F. 3d 377, 384 (2007). It held that although error had\noccurred and was obvious, Puckett had not satisfied the\nthird prong of the plain-error analysis by demonstrating\nthat the error affected his substantial rights, i.e., caused\nhim prejudice. Id., at 386. Especially in light of the Dis\ntrict Judge’s statement that granting a reduction when the\ndefendant had continued to engage in criminal conduct\nwas “so rare [as] to be unknown,” Puckett could not show\nthat the Government’s breach had affected his ultimate\nsentence. The Court of Appeals accordingly affirmed the\nconviction and sentence. Id., at 388.\n   We granted certiorari, 554 U. S. ___ (2008), to consider a\nquestion that has divided the Federal Courts of Appeals:\nwhether Rule 52(b)’s plain-error test applies to a forfeited\nclaim, like Puckett’s, that the Government failed to meet\nits obligations under a plea agreement. See In re Sealed\nCase, 356 F. 3d 313, 315–318 (CADC 2004) (discussing\nconflict among the Circuits). Concluding that Rule 52(b)\ndoes apply and in the usual fashion, we now affirm.\n                              II\n  If a litigant believes that an error has occurred (to his\ndetriment) during a federal judicial proceeding, he must\nobject in order to preserve the issue. If he fails to do so in\na timely manner, his claim for relief from the error is\nforfeited. “No procedural principle is more familiar to this\nCourt than that a . . . right may be forfeited in criminal as\nwell as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion\nof the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to deter\nmine it.” Yakus v. United States, 321 U. S. 414, 444\n(1944).\n  If an error is not properly preserved, appellate-court\nauthority to remedy the error (by reversing the judgment,\nfor example, or ordering a new trial) is strictly circum\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nscribed. There is good reason for this; “anyone familiar\nwith the work of courts understands that errors are a\nconstant in the trial process, that most do not much mat\nter, and that a reflexive inclination by appellate courts to\nreverse because of unpreserved error would be fatal.”\nUnited States v. Padilla, 415 F. 3d 211, 224 (CA1 2005)\n(en banc) (Boudin, C. J., concurring).\n   This limitation on appellate-court authority serves to\ninduce the timely raising of claims and objections, which\ngives the district court the opportunity to consider and\nresolve them. That court is ordinarily in the best position\nto determine the relevant facts and adjudicate the dispute.\nIn the case of an actual or invited procedural error, the\ndistrict court can often correct or avoid the mistake so that\nit cannot possibly affect the ultimate outcome. And of\ncourse the contemporaneous-objection rule prevents a\nlitigant from “ ‘sandbagging’ ” the court—remaining silent\nabout his objection and belatedly raising the error only if\nthe case does not conclude in his favor. Cf. Wainwright v.\nSykes, 433 U. S. 72, 89 (1977); see also United States v.\nVonn, 535 U. S. 55, 72 (2002).\n   In federal criminal cases, Rule 51(b) tells parties how to\npreserve claims of error: “by informing the court—when\nthe court ruling or order is made or sought—of the action\nthe party wishes the court to take, or the party’s objection\nto the court’s action and the grounds for that objection.”\nFailure to abide by this contemporaneous-objection rule\nordinarily precludes the raising on appeal of the unpre\nserved claim of trial error. See United States v. Young,\n470 U. S. 1, 15, and n. 12 (1985). Rule 52(b), however,\nrecognizes a limited exception to that preclusion. The\nRule provides, in full: “A plain error that affects substan\ntial rights may be considered even though it was not\nbrought to the court’s attention.”\n   We explained in United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725\n(1993), that Rule 52(b) review—so-called “plain-error\n6                PUCKETT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nreview”—involves four steps, or prongs. First, there must\nbe an error or defect—some sort of “[d]eviation from a\nlegal rule”—that has not been intentionally relinquished\nor abandoned, i.e., affirmatively waived, by the appellant.\nId., at 732–733. Second, the legal error must be clear or\nobvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute. See\nid., at 734. Third, the error must have affected the appel\nlant’s substantial rights, which in the ordinary case means\nhe must demonstrate that it “affected the outcome of the\ndistrict court proceedings.” Ibid. Fourth and finally, if the\nabove three prongs are satisfied, the court of appeals has\nthe discretion to remedy the error—discretion which ought\nto be exercised only if the error “ ‘seriously affect[s] the\nfairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceed\nings.’ ” Id., at 736 (quoting United States v. Atkinson, 297\nU. S. 157, 160 (1936)). Meeting all four prongs is difficult,\n“as it should be.” United States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542\nU. S. 74, 83, n. 9 (2004).\n  We have repeatedly cautioned that “[a]ny unwarranted\nextension” of the authority granted by Rule 52(b) would\ndisturb the careful balance it strikes between judicial\nefficiency and the redress of injustice, see Young, supra, at\n15; and that the creation of an unjustified exception to the\nRule would be “[e]ven less appropriate,” Johnson v. United\nStates, 520 U. S. 461, 466 (1997). The real question in this\ncase is not whether plain-error review applies when a\ndefendant fails to preserve a claim that the Government\ndefaulted on its plea-agreement obligations, but rather\nwhat conceivable reason exists for disregarding its evident\napplication. Such a breach is undoubtedly a violation of\nthe defendant’s rights, see Santobello v. New York, 404\nU. S. 257, 262 (1971), but the defendant has the opportu\nnity to seek vindication of those rights in district court; if\nhe fails to do so, Rule 52(b) as clearly sets forth the conse\nquences for that forfeiture as it does for all others.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                            III\n  Puckett puts forward several possible reasons why\nplain-error review should not apply in the present context.\nWe understand him to be making effectively four distinct\narguments: two doctrinal, two practical. We consider each\nset in turn.\n                             A\n  Puckett’s primary precedent-based argument proceeds\nas follows: When the Government breaks a promise that\nwas made to a defendant in the course of securing a guilty\nplea, the knowing and voluntary character of that plea\nretroactively vanishes, because (as it turns out) the defen\ndant was not aware of its true consequences. Since guilty\npleas must be knowing and voluntary to be valid,\nMcCarthy v. United States, 394 U. S. 459, 466 (1969), the\nguilty plea is thus void, along with the defendant’s corre\nsponding waiver of his right to trial. And because, under\nthis Court’s precedents, a waiver of the right to trial must\nbe made by the defendant personally, see Taylor v. Illi\nnois, 484 U. S. 400, 417–418, and n. 24 (1988), no action by\ncounsel alone could resurrect the voided waiver. There\nfore, Puckett concludes, counsel’s failure timely to object to\na Government breach can have no effect on the analysis,\nand the court of appeals must always correct the error.\n  This elaborate analysis suffers from at least two defects.\nFirst, there is nothing to support the proposition that the\nGovernment’s breach of a plea agreement retroactively\ncauses the defendant’s agreement to have been unknowing\nor involuntary. Any more than there is anything to sup\nport the proposition that a mere breach of contract retro\nactively causes the other party’s promise to have been\ncoerced or induced by fraud. Although the analogy may\nnot hold in all respects, plea bargains are essentially\ncontracts. See Mabry v. Johnson, 467 U. S. 504, 508\n(1984). When the consideration for a contract fails—that\n8                  PUCKETT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nis, when one of the exchanged promises is not kept—we do\nnot say that the voluntary bilateral consent to the contract\nnever existed, so that it is automatically and utterly void;\nwe say that the contract was broken. See 23 R. Lord,\nWilliston on Contracts §63.1 (4th ed. 2002) (hereinafter\nWilliston). The party injured by the breach will generally\nbe entitled to some remedy, which might include the right\nto rescind the contract entirely, see 26 id., §68.1 (4th ed.\n2003); but that is not the same thing as saying the con\ntract was never validly concluded.\n   So too here. When a defendant agrees to a plea bargain,\nthe Government takes on certain obligations. If those\nobligations are not met, the defendant is entitled to seek a\nremedy, which might in some cases be rescission of the\nagreement, allowing him to take back the consideration he\nhas furnished, i.e., to withdraw his plea. But rescission is\nnot the only possible remedy; in Santobello we allowed for\na resentencing at which the Government would fully\ncomply with the agreement—in effect, specific perform\nance of the contract. 404 U. S., at 263. In any case, it is\nentirely clear that a breach does not cause the guilty plea,\nwhen entered, to have been unknowing or involuntary. It\nis precisely because the plea was knowing and voluntary\n(and hence valid) that the Government is obligated to\nuphold its side of the bargain.1\n——————\n   1 Puckett points out that in Brady v. United States, 397 U. S. 742\n\n(1970), we quoted approvingly the Fifth Circuit’s statement that guilty\npleas must stand unless induced by “misrepresentation (including\nunfulfilled or unfulfillable promises),” id., at 755 (quoting Shelton v.\nUnited States, 246 F. 2d 571, 572, n. 2 (CA5 1957) (en banc); internal\nquotation marks omitted). But it is hornbook law that misrepresenta\ntion requires an intent at the time of contracting not to perform. 26\nWilliston §69.11. It is more difficult to explain the other precedent\nrelied upon by Puckett—our suggestion in Mabry v. Johnson, 467 U. S.\n504, 509 (1984), that “when the prosecution breaches its promise with\nrespect to an executed plea agreement, the defendant pleads guilty on a\nfalse premise, and hence his conviction cannot stand.” That statement,\n                    Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Moreover, and perhaps more fundamentally, Puckett’s\nargument confuses the concepts of waiver and forfeiture.\nNobody contends that Puckett’s counsel has waived—that\nis, intentionally relinquished or abandoned, Olano, 507\nU. S., at 733—Puckett’s right to seek relief from the Gov\nernment’s breach. (If he had, there would be no error at\nall and plain-error analysis would add nothing.) The\nobjection is rather that Puckett forfeited the claim of error\nthrough his counsel’s failure to raise the argument in the\nDistrict Court. This Court’s precedents requiring that\ncertain waivers be personal, knowing, and voluntary are\nthus simply irrelevant. Those holdings determine whether\nerror occurred, but say nothing about the proper standard\nof review when the claim of error is not preserved. The\nquestion presented by this case assumes error; only the\nstandard of review is in dispute.\n   Puckett’s second doctrinal attack rests on our decision in\nSantobello. In that case, the State had promised in a plea\ndeal that it would make no sentencing recommendation,\nbut the prosecutor (apparently unaware of that commit\nment) asked the state trial court to impose the maximum\npenalty of one year. Defense counsel immediately ob\njected. 404 U. S., at 259. The trial judge proceeded any\nway to impose the 1-year sentence, reassuring Santobello\nthat the prosecutor’s recommendation did not affect his\ndecision. Id., at 259–260. This Court vacated the convic\ntion and remanded the case because “the interests of\njustice” would thus be best served. Id., at 262.\n   Puckett maintains that if the “interests of justice” re\nquired a remand in Santobello even though the breach\n——————\nlike the one in Brady, was dictum. Its conclusion that the conviction\ncannot stand is only sometimes true (if that is the remedy the court\nprescribes for the breach). And even when the conviction is overturned,\nthe reason is not that the guilty plea was unknowing or involuntary.\nWe disavow any aspect of the Mabry dictum that contradicts our\nholding today.\n10                 PUCKETT v.

We do not agree. Whether an\nerror can be found harmless is simply a different question\nfrom whether it can be subjected to plain-error review.\nSantobello (given that the error in that case was pre\nserved) necessarily addressed only the former.\n                             B\n   Doctrine and precedent aside, Puckett argues that\npractical considerations counsel against subjecting plea\nbreach claims to the rule of plain-error review. Specifi\ncally, he contends that no purpose would be served by\napplying the rule; and that plea breaches will always\nsatisfy its four prongs, making its application superfluous.\nAccepting, arguendo (and dubitante), that policy concerns\ncan ever authorize a departure from the Federal Rules,\nboth arguments are wrong.\n   Puckett suggests that once the prosecution has broken\nits agreement, e.g., by requesting a higher sentence than\nagreed upon, it is too late to “unring” the bell even if an\nobjection is made: The district judge has already heard the\nrequest, and under Santobello it does not matter if he was\ninfluenced by it. So why demand the futile objection?\n   For one thing, requiring the objection means the defen\ndant cannot “game” the system, “wait[ing] to see if the\nsentence later str[ikes] him as satisfactory,” Vonn, 535\nU. S., at 73, and then seeking a second bite at the apple by\nraising the claim. For another, the breach itself will not\nalways be conceded.2 In such a case, the district court if\n——————\n  2 Indeed, in this case the Government might well have argued that it\n\nwas excused from its obligation to assert “demonstrated acceptance of\nresponsibility” because Puckett’s ongoing criminal conduct hindered\nperformance. See 13 Williston §39.3 (4th ed. 2000). That argument\nmight have convinced us had it been pressed, but the Government\nconceded the breach, and we analyze the case as it comes to us.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\napprised of the claim will be in a position to adjudicate the\nmatter in the first instance, creating a factual record and\nfacilitating appellate review. Thirdly, some breaches may\nbe curable upon timely objection—for example, where the\nprosecution simply forgot its commitment and is willing to\nadhere to the agreement. And finally, if the breach is\nestablished but cannot be cured, the district court can\ngrant an immediate remedy (e.g., withdrawal of the plea\nor resentencing before a different judge) and thus avoid\nthe delay and expense of a full appeal.\n   Puckett also contends that plain-error review “does no\nsubstantive work” in the context of the Government’s\nbreach of a plea agreement. Brief for Petitioner 22. He\nclaims that the third prong, the prejudice prong, has no\napplication, since plea-breach claims fall within “a special\ncategory of forfeited errors that can be corrected regard\nless of their effect on the outcome.” Olano, supra, at 735.\n   This Court has several times declined to resolve\nwhether “structural” errors—those that affect “the frame\nwork within which the trial proceeds,” Arizona v. Fulmi\nnante, 499 U. S. 279, 310 (1991)—automatically satisfy the\nthird prong of the plain-error test. Olano, supra, at 735;\nJohnson, 520 U. S., at 469; United States v. Cotton, 535\nU. S. 625, 632 (2002). Once again we need not answer\nthat question, because breach of a plea deal is not a “struc\ntural” error as we have used that term. We have never\ndescribed it as such, see Johnson, supra, at 468–469, and\nit shares no common features with errors we have held\nstructural. A plea breach does not “necessarily render a\ncriminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehi\ncle for determining guilt or innocence,” Neder v. United\nStates, 527 U. S. 1, 9 (1999) (emphasis deleted); it does not\n“defy analysis by ‘harmless-error’ standards” by affecting\nthe entire adjudicatory framework, Fulminante, supra, at\n309; and the “difficulty of assessing the effect of the error,”\nUnited States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. 140, 149, n. 4\n12                  PUCKETT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n(2006), is no greater with respect to plea breaches at sen\ntencing than with respect to other procedural errors at\nsentencing, which are routinely subject to harmlessness\nreview, see, e.g., United States v. Teague, 469 F. 3d 205,\n209–210 (CA1 2006).\n   Santobello did hold that automatic reversal is war\nranted when objection to the Government’s breach of a\nplea agreement has been preserved,3 but that holding\nrested not upon the premise that plea-breach errors are\n(like “structural” errors) somehow not susceptible, or not\namenable, to review for harmlessness, but rather upon a\npolicy interest in establishing the trust between defen\ndants and prosecutors that is necessary to sustain plea\nbargaining—an “essential” and “highly desirable” part of\nthe criminal process, 404 U. S., at 261–262. But the rule\nof contemporaneous objection is equally essential and\ndesirable, and when the two collide we see no need to\nrelieve the defendant of his usual burden of showing\nprejudice. See Olano, 507 U. S., at 734.\n   The defendant whose plea agreement has been broken\nby the Government will not always be able to show preju\ndice, either because he obtained the benefits contemplated\nby the deal anyway (e.g., the sentence that the prosecutor\npromised to request) or because he likely would not have\nobtained those benefits in any event (as is seemingly the\ncase here).4\n——————\n  3 We  need not confront today the question whether Santobello’s\nautomatic-reversal rule has survived our recent elaboration of harm\nless-error principles in such cases as Fulminante and Neder.\n  4 Because, as we have explained, the breach consists of a wrongful\n\ndenial of the rights obtained by the defendant through the plea agree\nment and does not automatically invalidate the plea, we agree with the\nGovernment that the question with regard to prejudice is not whether\nPuckett would have entered the plea had he known about the future\nviolation. Cf. United States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542 U. S. 74, 83\n(2004). When the rights acquired by the defendant relate to sentenc\ning, the “ ‘outcome’ ” he must show to have been affected is his sentence.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   On the dissent’s view, a defendant in Puckett’s position\nhas always suffered an impairment of his “substantial\nrights” under Olano’s third prong, because he has been\nconvicted “in the absence of trial or compliance with the\nterms of the plea agreement dispensing with the Govern\nment’s obligation to prove its case.” Post, at 1 (opinion of\nSOUTER, J.). But that is simply an ipse dixit recasting the\nconceded error—breach of the plea agreement—as the\neffect on substantial rights. Any trial error can be said to\nimpair substantial rights if the harm is defined as “being\nconvicted at a trial tainted with [fill-in-the-blank] error.”\nNor does the fact that there is a “protected liberty inter\nest” at stake render this case different, see post, at 3. That\ninterest is always at stake in criminal cases. Eliminating\nthe third plain-error prong through semantics makes a\nnullity of Olano’s instruction that a defendant normally\n“must make a specific showing of prejudice” in order to\nobtain relief, 507 U. S., at 735.\n   Puckett contends that the fourth prong of plain-error\nreview likewise has no application because every breach of\na plea agreement will constitute a miscarriage of justice.\nThat is not so. The fourth prong is meant to be applied on\na case-specific and fact-intensive basis. We have empha\nsized that a “per se approach to plain-error review is\nflawed.” Young, 470 U. S., at 17, n. 14. It is true enough\nthat when the Government reneges on a plea deal, the\nintegrity of the system may be called into question, but\nthere may well be countervailing factors in particular\ncases. Puckett is again a good example: Given that he\nobviously did not cease his life of crime, receipt of a sen\ntencing reduction for acceptance of responsibility would\nhave been so ludicrous as itself to compromise the public\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\n   Of course the second prong of plain-error review also\nwill often have some “bite” in plea-agreement cases. Not\nall breaches will be clear or obvious. Plea agreements are\n14              PUCKETT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot always models of draftsmanship, so the scope of the\nGovernment’s commitments will on occasion be open to\ndoubt. Moreover, the Government will often have a color\nable (albeit ultimately inadequate) excuse for its nonper\nformance. See n. 2, supra.\n                         *    *    *\n   Application of plain-error review in the present context\nis consistent with our cases, serves worthy purposes, has\nmeaningful effects, and is in any event compelled by the\nFederal Rules. While we recognize that the Government’s\nbreach of a plea agreement is a serious matter, “the seri\nousness of the error claimed does not remove consideration\nof it from the ambit of the Federal Rules of Criminal Pro\ncedure.” Johnson, 520 U.

I disagree with my colleagues\nwith respect to the interest at stake for a criminal defen\ndant in a case like this, and I respectfully dissent.\n   This case turns on whether plain-error review applies to\nan unpreserved claim that the Government breached its\nplea agreement and on identifying the relevant effect, or\nsubstantial rights implicated, under the third prong of\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 734 (1993). I agree\nwith the majority that plain error is the proper test, but\ndepart from the Court’s holding that the effect in question\nis length of incarceration for the offense charged (as to\nwhich the error here probably made no ultimate differ\nence). I would hold that the relevant effect is conviction in\nthe absence of trial or compliance with the terms of the\nplea agreement dispensing with the Government’s obliga\ntion to prove its case.\n   The first two conditions for recognizing plain error, that\nthere be error and that it be clear, see id., at 732–734, are\nwithout doubt satisfied here. Before sentencing, a collo\nquy in accordance with Federal Rule of Criminal Proce\ndure 11 laid the ground for satisfying the requirement\n2               PUCKETT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nthat the error be obvious, by making a public record of the\nterms of the plea agreement between Puckett and the\nGovernment. Both the written agreement and the Gov\nernment’s representation to the District Court included\nthe Government’s statement that Puckett qualified for a\nthree-level reduction in his offense level under the Sen\ntencing Guidelines, because of his acceptance of responsi\nbility for his offense. See App. 54a (“The government\nagrees that Puckett has demonstrated acceptance of re\nsponsibility and thereby qualifies for a three-level reduc\ntion in his offense level”); id., at 68a (“The government\nagrees that Mr. Puckett has demonstrated acceptance of\nresponsibility and thereby would qualify for a three level\nreduction in his offense level”).\n   Puckett does indeed appear to have satisfied the condi\ntions on which the Government’s commitment was prem\nised: he accepted responsibility for committing “his of\nfense[s]” and “assisted authorities in the investigation or\nprosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying\nauthorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty.”\nUnited States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual\n§3E1.1 (Nov. 2003). His subsequent criminality (during\nthe unusual 3-year break between his guilty plea and\nsentencing) was not a failure on his part to accept respon\nsibility for his prior crimes (the benefit of which the Gov\nernment had already received by the time Puckett pleaded\nguilty). In any case, the Government could have insisted\non a provision in the plea agreement allowing it to back\nout of its commitment if Puckett engaged in additional\ncriminal conduct prior to sentencing, and did not do so. It\nshould therefore be bound by the terms of the agreement it\nmade, whether or not Puckett was in fact entitled to the\nreduction. In administering the criminal law no less than\nthe civil, parties are routinely bound by agreements they\nwish they had not made. This is why the Government has\nno choice but to admit that it breached the plea agreement\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nwhen, at sentencing, it objected to the three-level reduc\ntion. Despite its contention that the plain-error doctrine\ndoes not save Puckett from his failure to object at the\nsentencing hearing, the Government does not deny that a\ndeal is a deal and it does not deny that it broke its word.\n   The plain-error doctrine will not, however, avail Puckett\nanything unless the remaining conditions set out in Olano\nare satisfied, the third requiring a showing that sentenc\ning Puckett on a plea given in return for an unfulfilled\npromise by the Government violated his substantial\nrights. See 507 U. S., at 734. The majority understands\nthe effect in question to be length of incarceration. See\nante, at 12, n. 4 (“When the rights acquired by the defen\ndant relate to sentencing, the ‘outcome’ he must show to\nhave been affected is his sentence”). Since Puckett can\nhardly show that a court apprised of his subsequent\ncriminality would have given him the three-level reduction\neven in the absence of the Government’s breach, in the\nmajority’s view he cannot satisfy the “substantial rights”\ncriterion and so fails to qualify for correction of the admit\nted clear error.\n   I, on the contrary, would identify the effect on substan\ntial rights as the criminal conviction itself, regardless of\nlength of incarceration. My reason is simply that under\nthe Constitution the protected liberty interest in freedom\nfrom criminal taint, subject to the Fifth Amendment’s due\nprocess guarantee of fundamental fairness, is properly\nunderstood to require a trial or plea agreement honored by\nthe Government before the stigma of a conviction can be\nimposed. That protection does not vanish if a convicted\ndefendant turns out to get a light sentence. It is the trial\nleading to possible conviction, not the sentencing hearing\nalone, that is the focus of this guarantee, and it is the\npossibility of criminal conviction itself, without more, that\ncalls for due process protection. In a legal system consti\ntuted this way, it is hard to imagine anything less fair\n4               PUCKETT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nthan branding someone a criminal not because he was\ntried and convicted, but because he entered a plea of guilty\ninduced by an agreement the Government refuses to\nhonor.\n   Agreements must therefore be kept by the Government\nas well as by the individual, and if the plain-error doctrine\ncan ever rescue a defendant from the consequence of for\nfeiting rights by inattention, it should be used when the\nGovernment has induced an admission of criminality by\nmaking an agreement that it deliberately breaks after the\ndefendant has satisfied his end of the bargain. Redressing\nsuch fundamentally unfair behavior by the Government,\nwhether by vacating the plea or enforcing the plea agree\nment, see Santobello v. New York, 404 U. S. 257, 263\n(1971), is worth the undoubted risk of allowing a defen\ndant to game the system and the additional administra\ntive burdens, see ante, at 5, 10–11. If the Judiciary is\nworried about gamesmanship and extra proceedings, all it\nneeds to do is to minimize their likelihood by making it\nplain that it will require the Government to keep its word\nor seek rescission of the plea agreement if it has cause to\ndo so. Thus, I would find that a defendant’s substantial\nrights have been violated whenever the Government\nbreaches a plea agreement, unless the defendant got just\nwhat he bargained for anyway from the sentencing court.\n   What I have said about the third Olano criterion deter\nmines my treatment of the fourth, addressing whether\nleaving the error uncorrected “may be said . . . ‘seriously\n[to] affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of\njudicial proceedings.’ ” Olano, supra, at 744 (quoting\nUnited States v. Atkinson, 297 U. S. 157, 160 (1936)). If I\nam right that in this case the protected interest is in the\nguarantee that no one is liable to spend a day behind bars\nas a convict without a trial or his own agreement, then the\nfairness and integrity of the Judicial Branch suffer when a\ncourt imprisons a defendant after he pleaded guilty in\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Argued January 14, 2009—Decided March 25, 2009\nIn exchange for petitioner Puckett’s guilty plea, the Government agreed\n  to request (1) a three-level reduction in his offense level under the\n  Federal Sentencing Guidelines on the ground that he had accepted\n  responsibility for his crimes; and (2) a sentence at the low end of the\n  applicable Guidelines range. The District Court accepted the plea,\n  but before Puckett was sentenced he assisted in another crime. As a\n  result, the Government opposed any reduction in Puckett’s offense\n  level, and the District Court denied the three-level reduction. On ap\n  peal, Puckett raised for the first time the argument that by backing\n  away from its reduction request, the Government had broken the\n  plea agreement. The Fifth Circuit found that Puckett had forfeited\n  that claim by failing to raise it below; applied Federal Rule of Crimi\n  nal Procedure Rule 52(b)’s plain-error standard for unpreserved\n  claims of error; and held that, although the error had occurred and\n  was obvious, Puckett had not satisfied the third prong of plain-error\n  analysis in that he failed to demonstrate that his ultimate sentence\n  was affected, especially since the District Judge had found that ac\n  ceptance-of-responsibility reductions for defendants who continued to\n  engage in criminal activity were so rare as “to be unknown.”\nHeld: Rule 52(b)’s plain-error test applies to a forfeited claim, like\n Puckett’s, that the Government failed to meet its obligations under a\n plea agreement, and applies in the usual fashion. Pp. 4–14.\n    (a) In federal criminal cases, Rule 51(b) instructs parties how to\n preserve claims of error: “by informing the court—when [a] ruling . . .\n is made or sought—of the action the party wishes the court to take,\n or the party’s objection to the court’s action and the grounds for that\n objection.” A party’s failure to preserve a claim ordinarily prevents\n him from raising it on appeal, but Rule 52(b) recognizes a limited ex\n2                     PUCKETT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    ception for plain errors. “Plain-error review” involves four prongs: (1)\n    there must be an error or defect that the appellant has not affirma\n    tively waived, United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 732–733; (2) it\n    must be clear or obvious, see id., at 734; (3) it must have affected the\n    appellant’s substantial rights, i.e., “affected the outcome of the dis\n    trict court proceedings,” ibid.; and (4) if the three other prongs are\n    satisfied, the court of appeals has the discretion to remedy the error if\n    it “ ‘seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of\n    judicial proceedings,’ ” id., at 736. The question here is not whether\n    plain-error review applies when a defendant fails to preserve a claim\n    that the Government defaulted on its plea-agreement obligations, but\n    what conceivable reason exists for disregarding its evident applica\n    tion. The breach undoubtedly violates the defendant’s rights, but the\n    defendant has the opportunity to seek vindication of those rights in\n    district court; if he fails to do so, Rule 52(b) as clearly sets forth the\n    consequences for that forfeiture as it does for all others. Pp. 4–6.\n       (b) Neither Puckett’s doctrinal arguments nor the practical consid\n    erations that he raises counsel against applying plain-error review in\n    the present context. The Government’s breach of the plea agreement\n    does not retroactively cause the defendant’s guilty plea to have been\n    unknowing or involuntary. This Court’s decision in Santobello v.\n    New York, 404 U. S. 257, does not govern, since the question whether\n    an error can be found harmless is different from the question\n    whether it can be subjected to plain-error review. Puckett is wrong\n    in contending that no purpose is served by applying plain-error re\n    view: There is much to be gained by inducing the objection to be\n    made at the trial court level, where (among other things) the error\n    can often be remedied.

The government also agrees to request that\n    Puckett’s sentence be placed at the lowest end of the\n    guideline level deemed applicable by the Court.” Id.,\n    at 54a.\n   To satisfy the first of these obligations, the Government\nfiled a motion in the District Court pursuant to §3E1.1 of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission’s Guidelines\nManual (Nov. 2003) (USSG). That provision directs sen\ntencing courts to decrease a defendant’s offense level\nunder the Guidelines by two levels if he “clearly demon\nstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense,” and by\na third level “upon motion of the government stating that\nthe defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation\nor prosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying\nauthorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty.” Two\nweeks later, the District Court held a plea colloquy, see\nFed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(b), and accepted Puckett’s plea.\n   Because of delays due to health problems experienced by\nPuckett, sentencing did not take place for almost three\nyears. In the interim, Puckett assisted another man in a\nscheme to defraud the Postal Service, and confessed that\nassistance (under questioning) to a probation officer. The\nofficer prepared an addendum to Puckett’s presentence\nreport recommending that he receive no §3E1.1 reduction\nfor acceptance of responsibility, on the theory that true\nacceptance of responsibility requires termination of crimi\nnal conduct. See USSG §3E1.1, comment., n. 1(b).\n   When sentencing finally did take place on May 4, 2006,\nPuckett’s counsel objected to the addendum, pointing out\nthat the Government had filed a motion requesting that\nthe full three-level reduction in offense level be granted.\nThe District Judge turned to the prosecutor, who re\nsponded that the motion was filed “a long time ago,” App.\n79a, before Puckett had engaged in the additional criminal\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbehavior. She made clear that the Government opposed\nany reduction in Puckett’s offense level for acceptance of\nresponsibility. The probation officer then added his view\nthat under the Guidelines, a reduction would be improper.\n   After hearing these submissions, the District Judge\nconcluded that even assuming he had the discretion to\ngrant the reduction, he would not do so. “[I]t’s so rare [as]\nto be unknown around here where one has committed a\ncrime subsequent to the crime for which they appear\nbefore the court and for them even then to get the three\npoints.” Id., at 80a–81a. He agreed, however, to follow\nthe recommendation that the Government made, pursuant\nto its commitment in the plea agreement, that Puckett be\nsentenced at the low end of the applicable Guidelines\nrange, which turned out to be 262 months in prison for the\narmed bank robbery and a mandatory minimum consecu\ntive term of 84 months for the firearm crime. Had the\nDistrict Court granted the three-level reduction for accep\ntance of responsibility, the bottom of the Guidelines range\nwould have been 188 months for the robbery; the firearm\nsentence would not have been affected.\n   Importantly, at no time during the exchange did\nPuckett’s counsel object that the Government was violat\ning its obligations under the plea agreement by backing\naway from its request for the reduction. He never cited\nthe relevant provision of the plea agreement. And he did\nnot move to withdraw Puckett’s plea on grounds that the\nGovernment had broken its sentencing promises.\n   On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit, Puckett did argue, inter alia, that the Gov\nernment violated the plea agreement at sentencing. The\nGovernment conceded that by objecting to the reduction\nfor acceptance of responsibility, it had violated the obliga\ntion set forth in paragraph 8 of the agreement, but main\ntained that Puckett had forfeited this claim by failing to\nraise it in the District Court. The Court of Appeals\n4                PUCKETT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nagreed, and applied the plain-error standard that Rule\n52(b) makes applicable to unpreserved claims of error.\n505 F. 3d 377, 384 (2007). It held that although error had\noccurred and was obvious, Puckett had not satisfied the\nthird prong of the plain-error analysis by demonstrating\nthat the error affected his substantial rights, i.e., caused\nhim prejudice. Id., at 386. Especially in light of the Dis\ntrict Judge’s statement that granting a reduction when the\ndefendant had continued to engage in criminal conduct\nwas “so rare [as] to be unknown,” Puckett could not show\nthat the Government’s breach had affected his ultimate\nsentence. The Court of Appeals accordingly affirmed the\nconviction and sentence. Id., at 388.\n   We granted certiorari, 554 U. S. ___ (2008), to consider a\nquestion that has divided the Federal Courts of Appeals:\nwhether Rule 52(b)’s plain-error test applies to a forfeited\nclaim, like Puckett’s, that the Government failed to meet\nits obligations under a plea agreement. See In re Sealed\nCase, 356 F. 3d 313, 315–318 (CADC 2004) (discussing\nconflict among the Circuits). Concluding that Rule 52(b)\ndoes apply and in the usual fashion, we now affirm.\n                              II\n  If a litigant believes that an error has occurred (to his\ndetriment) during a federal judicial proceeding, he must\nobject in order to preserve the issue. If he fails to do so in\na timely manner, his claim for relief from the error is\nforfeited. “No procedural principle is more familiar to this\nCourt than that a . . . right may be forfeited in criminal as\nwell as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion\nof the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to deter\nmine it.” Yakus v. United States, 321 U. S. 414, 444\n(1944).\n  If an error is not properly preserved, appellate-court\nauthority to remedy the error (by reversing the judgment,\nfor example, or ordering a new trial) is strictly circum\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nscribed. There is good reason for this; “anyone familiar\nwith the work of courts understands that errors are a\nconstant in the trial process, that most do not much mat\nter, and that a reflexive inclination by appellate courts to\nreverse because of unpreserved error would be fatal.”\nUnited States v. Padilla, 415 F. 3d 211, 224 (CA1 2005)\n(en banc) (Boudin, C. J., concurring).\n   This limitation on appellate-court authority serves to\ninduce the timely raising of claims and objections, which\ngives the district court the opportunity to consider and\nresolve them. That court is ordinarily in the best position\nto determine the relevant facts and adjudicate the dispute.\nIn the case of an actual or invited procedural error, the\ndistrict court can often correct or avoid the mistake so that\nit cannot possibly affect the ultimate outcome. And of\ncourse the contemporaneous-objection rule prevents a\nlitigant from “ ‘sandbagging’ ” the court—remaining silent\nabout his objection and belatedly raising the error only if\nthe case does not conclude in his favor. Cf. Wainwright v.\nSykes, 433 U. S. 72, 89 (1977); see also United States v.\nVonn, 535 U. S. 55, 72 (2002).\n   In federal criminal cases, Rule 51(b) tells parties how to\npreserve claims of error: “by informing the court—when\nthe court ruling or order is made or sought—of the action\nthe party wishes the court to take, or the party’s objection\nto the court’s action and the grounds for that objection.”\nFailure to abide by this contemporaneous-objection rule\nordinarily precludes the raising on appeal of the unpre\nserved claim of trial error. See United States v. Young,\n470 U. S. 1, 15, and n. 12 (1985). Rule 52(b), however,\nrecognizes a limited exception to that preclusion. The\nRule provides, in full: “A plain error that affects substan\ntial rights may be considered even though it was not\nbrought to the court’s attention.”\n   We explained in United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725\n(1993), that Rule 52(b) review—so-called “plain-error\n6                PUCKETT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nreview”—involves four steps, or prongs. First, there must\nbe an error or defect—some sort of “[d]eviation from a\nlegal rule”—that has not been intentionally relinquished\nor abandoned, i.e., affirmatively waived, by the appellant.\nId., at 732–733. Second, the legal error must be clear or\nobvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute. See\nid., at 734. Third, the error must have affected the appel\nlant’s substantial rights, which in the ordinary case means\nhe must demonstrate that it “affected the outcome of the\ndistrict court proceedings.” Ibid. Fourth and finally, if the\nabove three prongs are satisfied, the court of appeals has\nthe discretion to remedy the error—discretion which ought\nto be exercised only if the error “ ‘seriously affect[s] the\nfairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceed\nings.’ ” Id., at 736 (quoting United States v. Atkinson, 297\nU. S. 157, 160 (1936)). Meeting all four prongs is difficult,\n“as it should be.” United States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542\nU. S. 74, 83, n. 9 (2004).\n  We have repeatedly cautioned that “[a]ny unwarranted\nextension” of the authority granted by Rule 52(b) would\ndisturb the careful balance it strikes between judicial\nefficiency and the redress of injustice, see Young, supra, at\n15; and that the creation of an unjustified exception to the\nRule would be “[e]ven less appropriate,” Johnson v. United\nStates, 520 U. S. 461, 466 (1997). The real question in this\ncase is not whether plain-error review applies when a\ndefendant fails to preserve a claim that the Government\ndefaulted on its plea-agreement obligations, but rather\nwhat conceivable reason exists for disregarding its evident\napplication. Such a breach is undoubtedly a violation of\nthe defendant’s rights, see Santobello v. New York, 404\nU. S. 257, 262 (1971), but the defendant has the opportu\nnity to seek vindication of those rights in district court; if\nhe fails to do so, Rule 52(b) as clearly sets forth the conse\nquences for that forfeiture as it does for all others.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                            III\n  Puckett puts forward several possible reasons why\nplain-error review should not apply in the present context.\nWe understand him to be making effectively four distinct\narguments: two doctrinal, two practical. We consider each\nset in turn.\n                             A\n  Puckett’s primary precedent-based argument proceeds\nas follows: When the Government breaks a promise that\nwas made to a defendant in the course of securing a guilty\nplea, the knowing and voluntary character of that plea\nretroactively vanishes, because (as it turns out) the defen\ndant was not aware of its true consequences. Since guilty\npleas must be knowing and voluntary to be valid,\nMcCarthy v. United States, 394 U. S. 459, 466 (1969), the\nguilty plea is thus void, along with the defendant’s corre\nsponding waiver of his right to trial. And because, under\nthis Court’s precedents, a waiver of the right to trial must\nbe made by the defendant personally, see Taylor v. Illi\nnois, 484 U. S. 400, 417–418, and n. 24 (1988), no action by\ncounsel alone could resurrect the voided waiver. There\nfore, Puckett concludes, counsel’s failure timely to object to\na Government breach can have no effect on the analysis,\nand the court of appeals must always correct the error.\n  This elaborate analysis suffers from at least two defects.\nFirst, there is nothing to support the proposition that the\nGovernment’s breach of a plea agreement retroactively\ncauses the defendant’s agreement to have been unknowing\nor involuntary. Any more than there is anything to sup\nport the proposition that a mere breach of contract retro\nactively causes the other party’s promise to have been\ncoerced or induced by fraud. Although the analogy may\nnot hold in all respects, plea bargains are essentially\ncontracts. See Mabry v. Johnson, 467 U. S. 504, 508\n(1984). When the consideration for a contract fails—that\n8                  PUCKETT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nis, when one of the exchanged promises is not kept—we do\nnot say that the voluntary bilateral consent to the contract\nnever existed, so that it is automatically and utterly void;\nwe say that the contract was broken. See 23 R. Lord,\nWilliston on Contracts §63.1 (4th ed. 2002) (hereinafter\nWilliston). The party injured by the breach will generally\nbe entitled to some remedy, which might include the right\nto rescind the contract entirely, see 26 id., §68.1 (4th ed.\n2003); but that is not the same thing as saying the con\ntract was never validly concluded.\n   So too here. When a defendant agrees to a plea bargain,\nthe Government takes on certain obligations. If those\nobligations are not met, the defendant is entitled to seek a\nremedy, which might in some cases be rescission of the\nagreement, allowing him to take back the consideration he\nhas furnished, i.e., to withdraw his plea. But rescission is\nnot the only possible remedy; in Santobello we allowed for\na resentencing at which the Government would fully\ncomply with the agreement—in effect, specific perform\nance of the contract. 404 U. S., at 263. In any case, it is\nentirely clear that a breach does not cause the guilty plea,\nwhen entered, to have been unknowing or involuntary. It\nis precisely because the plea was knowing and voluntary\n(and hence valid) that the Government is obligated to\nuphold its side of the bargain.1\n——————\n   1 Puckett points out that in Brady v. United States, 397 U. S. 742\n\n(1970), we quoted approvingly the Fifth Circuit’s statement that guilty\npleas must stand unless induced by “misrepresentation (including\nunfulfilled or unfulfillable promises),” id., at 755 (quoting Shelton v.\nUnited States, 246 F. 2d 571, 572, n. 2 (CA5 1957) (en banc); internal\nquotation marks omitted). But it is hornbook law that misrepresenta\ntion requires an intent at the time of contracting not to perform. 26\nWilliston §69.11. It is more difficult to explain the other precedent\nrelied upon by Puckett—our suggestion in Mabry v. Johnson, 467 U. S.\n504, 509 (1984), that “when the prosecution breaches its promise with\nrespect to an executed plea agreement, the defendant pleads guilty on a\nfalse premise, and hence his conviction cannot stand.” That statement,\n                    Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Moreover, and perhaps more fundamentally, Puckett’s\nargument confuses the concepts of waiver and forfeiture.\nNobody contends that Puckett’s counsel has waived—that\nis, intentionally relinquished or abandoned, Olano, 507\nU. S., at 733—Puckett’s right to seek relief from the Gov\nernment’s breach. (If he had, there would be no error at\nall and plain-error analysis would add nothing.) The\nobjection is rather that Puckett forfeited the claim of error\nthrough his counsel’s failure to raise the argument in the\nDistrict Court. This Court’s precedents requiring that\ncertain waivers be personal, knowing, and voluntary are\nthus simply irrelevant. Those holdings determine whether\nerror occurred, but say nothing about the proper standard\nof review when the claim of error is not preserved. The\nquestion presented by this case assumes error; only the\nstandard of review is in dispute.\n   Puckett’s second doctrinal attack rests on our decision in\nSantobello. In that case, the State had promised in a plea\ndeal that it would make no sentencing recommendation,\nbut the prosecutor (apparently unaware of that commit\nment) asked the state trial court to impose the maximum\npenalty of one year. Defense counsel immediately ob\njected. 404 U. S., at 259. The trial judge proceeded any\nway to impose the 1-year sentence, reassuring Santobello\nthat the prosecutor’s recommendation did not affect his\ndecision. Id., at 259–260. This Court vacated the convic\ntion and remanded the case because “the interests of\njustice” would thus be best served. Id., at 262.\n   Puckett maintains that if the “interests of justice” re\nquired a remand in Santobello even though the breach\n——————\nlike the one in Brady, was dictum. Its conclusion that the conviction\ncannot stand is only sometimes true (if that is the remedy the court\nprescribes for the breach). And even when the conviction is overturned,\nthe reason is not that the guilty plea was unknowing or involuntary.\nWe disavow any aspect of the Mabry dictum that contradicts our\nholding today.\n10                 PUCKETT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthere was likely harmless, those same interests call for a\nremand whenever the Government reneges on a plea\nbargain, forfeiture or not. We do not agree. Whether an\nerror can be found harmless is simply a different question\nfrom whether it can be subjected to plain-error review.\nSantobello (given that the error in that case was pre\nserved) necessarily addressed only the former.\n                             B\n   Doctrine and precedent aside, Puckett argues that\npractical considerations counsel against subjecting plea\nbreach claims to the rule of plain-error review. Specifi\ncally, he contends that no purpose would be served by\napplying the rule; and that plea breaches will always\nsatisfy its four prongs, making its application superfluous.\nAccepting, arguendo (and dubitante), that policy concerns\ncan ever authorize a departure from the Federal Rules,\nboth arguments are wrong.\n   Puckett suggests that once the prosecution has broken\nits agreement, e.g., by requesting a higher sentence than\nagreed upon, it is too late to “unring” the bell even if an\nobjection is made: The district judge has already heard the\nrequest, and under Santobello it does not matter if he was\ninfluenced by it. So why demand the futile objection?\n   For one thing, requiring the objection means the defen\ndant cannot “game” the system, “wait[ing] to see if the\nsentence later str[ikes] him as satisfactory,” Vonn, 535\nU. S., at 73, and then seeking a second bite at the apple by\nraising the claim. For another, the breach itself will not\nalways be conceded.2 In such a case, the district court if\n——————\n  2 Indeed, in this case the Government might well have argued that it\n\nwas excused from its obligation to assert “demonstrated acceptance of\nresponsibility” because Puckett’s ongoing criminal conduct hindered\nperformance. See 13 Williston §39.3 (4th ed. 2000). That argument\nmight have convinced us had it been pressed, but the Government\nconceded the breach, and we analyze the case as it comes to us.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\napprised of the claim will be in a position to adjudicate the\nmatter in the first instance, creating a factual record and\nfacilitating appellate review. Thirdly, some breaches may\nbe curable upon timely objection—for example, where the\nprosecution simply forgot its commitment and is willing to\nadhere to the agreement. And finally, if the breach is\nestablished but cannot be cured, the district court can\ngrant an immediate remedy (e.g., withdrawal of the plea\nor resentencing before a different judge) and thus avoid\nthe delay and expense of a full appeal.\n   Puckett also contends that plain-error review “does no\nsubstantive work” in the context of the Government’s\nbreach of a plea agreement. Brief for Petitioner 22. He\nclaims that the third prong, the prejudice prong, has no\napplication, since plea-breach claims fall within “a special\ncategory of forfeited errors that can be corrected regard\nless of their effect on the outcome.” Olano, supra, at 735.\n   This Court has several times declined to resolve\nwhether “structural” errors—those that affect “the frame\nwork within which the trial proceeds,” Arizona v. Fulmi\nnante, 499 U. S. 279, 310 (1991)—automatically satisfy the\nthird prong of the plain-error test. Olano, supra, at 735;\nJohnson, 520 U. S., at 469; United States v. Cotton, 535\nU. S. 625, 632 (2002). Once again we need not answer\nthat question, because breach of a plea deal is not a “struc\ntural” error as we have used that term. We have never\ndescribed it as such, see Johnson, supra, at 468–469, and\nit shares no common features with errors we have held\nstructural. A plea breach does not “necessarily render a\ncriminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehi\ncle for determining guilt or innocence,” Neder v. United\nStates, 527 U. S. 1, 9 (1999) (emphasis deleted); it does not\n“defy analysis by ‘harmless-error’ standards” by affecting\nthe entire adjudicatory framework, Fulminante, supra, at\n309; and the “difficulty of assessing the effect of the error,”\nUnited States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. 140, 149, n. 4\n12                  PUCKETT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n(2006), is no greater with respect to plea breaches at sen\ntencing than with respect to other procedural errors at\nsentencing, which are routinely subject to harmlessness\nreview, see, e.g., United States v. Teague, 469 F. 3d 205,\n209–210 (CA1 2006).\n   Santobello did hold that automatic reversal is war\nranted when objection to the Government’s breach of a\nplea agreement has been preserved,3 but that holding\nrested not upon the premise that plea-breach errors are\n(like “structural” errors) somehow not susceptible, or not\namenable, to review for harmlessness, but rather upon a\npolicy interest in establishing the trust between defen\ndants and prosecutors that is necessary to sustain plea\nbargaining—an “essential” and “highly desirable” part of\nthe criminal process, 404 U. S., at 261–262. But the rule\nof contemporaneous objection is equally essential and\ndesirable, and when the two collide we see no need to\nrelieve the defendant of his usual burden of showing\nprejudice. See Olano, 507 U. S., at 734.\n   The defendant whose plea agreement has been broken\nby the Government will not always be able to show preju\ndice, either because he obtained the benefits contemplated\nby the deal anyway (e.g., the sentence that the prosecutor\npromised to request) or because he likely would not have\nobtained those benefits in any event (as is seemingly the\ncase here).4\n——————\n  3 We  need not confront today the question whether Santobello’s\nautomatic-reversal rule has survived our recent elaboration of harm\nless-error principles in such cases as Fulminante and Neder.\n  4 Because, as we have explained, the breach consists of a wrongful\n\ndenial of the rights obtained by the defendant through the plea agree\nment and does not automatically invalidate the plea, we agree with the\nGovernment that the question with regard to prejudice is not whether\nPuckett would have entered the plea had he known about the future\nviolation. Cf. United States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542 U. S. 74, 83\n(2004). When the rights acquired by the defendant relate to sentenc\ning, the “ ‘outcome’ ” he must show to have been affected is his sentence.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   On the dissent’s view, a defendant in Puckett’s position\nhas always suffered an impairment of his “substantial\nrights” under Olano’s third prong, because he has been\nconvicted “in the absence of trial or compliance with the\nterms of the plea agreement dispensing with the Govern\nment’s obligation to prove its case.” Post, at 1 (opinion of\nSOUTER, J.). But that is simply an ipse dixit recasting the\nconceded error—breach of the plea agreement—as the\neffect on substantial rights. Any trial error can be said to\nimpair substantial rights if the harm is defined as “being\nconvicted at a trial tainted with [fill-in-the-blank] error.”\nNor does the fact that there is a “protected liberty inter\nest” at stake render this case different, see post, at 3. That\ninterest is always at stake in criminal cases. Eliminating\nthe third plain-error prong through semantics makes a\nnullity of Olano’s instruction that a defendant normally\n“must make a specific showing of prejudice” in order to\nobtain relief, 507 U. S., at 735.\n   Puckett contends that the fourth prong of plain-error\nreview likewise has no application because every breach of\na plea agreement will constitute a miscarriage of justice.\nThat is not so. The fourth prong is meant to be applied on\na case-specific and fact-intensive basis. We have empha\nsized that a “per se approach to plain-error review is\nflawed.” Young, 470 U. S., at 17, n. 14. It is true enough\nthat when the Government reneges on a plea deal, the\nintegrity of the system may be called into question, but\nthere may well be countervailing factors in particular\ncases. Puckett is again a good example: Given that he\nobviously did not cease his life of crime, receipt of a sen\ntencing reduction for acceptance of responsibility would\nhave been so ludicrous as itself to compromise the public\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\n   Of course the second prong of plain-error review also\nwill often have some “bite” in plea-agreement cases. Not\nall breaches will be clear or obvious. Plea agreements are\n14              PUCKETT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot always models of draftsmanship, so the scope of the\nGovernment’s commitments will on occasion be open to\ndoubt. Moreover, the Government will often have a color\nable (albeit ultimately inadequate) excuse for its nonper\nformance. See n. 2, supra.\n                         *    *    *\n   Application of plain-error review in the present context\nis consistent with our cases, serves worthy purposes, has\nmeaningful effects, and is in any event compelled by the\nFederal Rules.

I disagree with my colleagues\nwith respect to the interest at stake for a criminal defen\ndant in a case like this, and I respectfully dissent.\n   This case turns on whether plain-error review applies to\nan unpreserved claim that the Government breached its\nplea agreement and on identifying the relevant effect, or\nsubstantial rights implicated, under the third prong of\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 734 (1993). I agree\nwith the majority that plain error is the proper test, but\ndepart from the Court’s holding that the effect in question\nis length of incarceration for the offense charged (as to\nwhich the error here probably made no ultimate differ\nence). I would hold that the relevant effect is conviction in\nthe absence of trial or compliance with the terms of the\nplea agreement dispensing with the Government’s obliga\ntion to prove its case.\n   The first two conditions for recognizing plain error, that\nthere be error and that it be clear, see id., at 732–734, are\nwithout doubt satisfied here. Before sentencing, a collo\nquy in accordance with Federal Rule of Criminal Proce\ndure 11 laid the ground for satisfying the requirement\n2               PUCKETT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nthat the error be obvious, by making a public record of the\nterms of the plea agreement between Puckett and the\nGovernment. Both the written agreement and the Gov\nernment’s representation to the District Court included\nthe Government’s statement that Puckett qualified for a\nthree-level reduction in his offense level under the Sen\ntencing Guidelines, because of his acceptance of responsi\nbility for his offense. See App. 54a (“The government\nagrees that Puckett has demonstrated acceptance of re\nsponsibility and thereby qualifies for a three-level reduc\ntion in his offense level”); id., at 68a (“The government\nagrees that Mr. Puckett has demonstrated acceptance of\nresponsibility and thereby would qualify for a three level\nreduction in his offense level”).\n   Puckett does indeed appear to have satisfied the condi\ntions on which the Government’s commitment was prem\nised: he accepted responsibility for committing “his of\nfense[s]” and “assisted authorities in the investigation or\nprosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying\nauthorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty.”\nUnited States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual\n§3E1.1 (Nov. 2003). His subsequent criminality (during\nthe unusual 3-year break between his guilty plea and\nsentencing) was not a failure on his part to accept respon\nsibility for his prior crimes (the benefit of which the Gov\nernment had already received by the time Puckett pleaded\nguilty). In any case, the Government could have insisted\non a provision in the plea agreement allowing it to back\nout of its commitment if Puckett engaged in additional\ncriminal conduct prior to sentencing, and did not do so. It\nshould therefore be bound by the terms of the agreement it\nmade, whether or not Puckett was in fact entitled to the\nreduction. In administering the criminal law no less than\nthe civil, parties are routinely bound by agreements they\nwish they had not made. This is why the Government has\nno choice but to admit that it breached the plea agreement\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nwhen, at sentencing, it objected to the three-level reduc\ntion. Despite its contention that the plain-error doctrine\ndoes not save Puckett from his failure to object at the\nsentencing hearing, the Government does not deny that a\ndeal is a deal and it does not deny that it broke its word.\n   The plain-error doctrine will not, however, avail Puckett\nanything unless the remaining conditions set out in Olano\nare satisfied, the third requiring a showing that sentenc\ning Puckett on a plea given in return for an unfulfilled\npromise by the Government violated his substantial\nrights. See 507 U. S., at 734. The majority understands\nthe effect in question to be length of incarceration. See\nante, at 12, n. 4 (“When the rights acquired by the defen\ndant relate to sentencing, the ‘outcome’ he must show to\nhave been affected is his sentence”). Since Puckett can\nhardly show that a court apprised of his subsequent\ncriminality would have given him the three-level reduction\neven in the absence of the Government’s breach, in the\nmajority’s view he cannot satisfy the “substantial rights”\ncriterion and so fails to qualify for correction of the admit\nted clear error.\n   I, on the contrary, would identify the effect on substan\ntial rights as the criminal conviction itself, regardless of\nlength of incarceration. My reason is simply that under\nthe Constitution the protected liberty interest in freedom\nfrom criminal taint, subject to the Fifth Amendment’s due\nprocess guarantee of fundamental fairness, is properly\nunderstood to require a trial or plea agreement honored by\nthe Government before the stigma of a conviction can be\nimposed. That protection does not vanish if a convicted\ndefendant turns out to get a light sentence. It is the trial\nleading to possible conviction, not the sentencing hearing\nalone, that is the focus of this guarantee, and it is the\npossibility of criminal conviction itself, without more, that\ncalls for due process protection. In a legal system consti\ntuted this way, it is hard to imagine anything less fair\n4               PUCKETT v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nthan branding someone a criminal not because he was\ntried and convicted, but because he entered a plea of guilty\ninduced by an agreement the Government refuses to\nhonor.\n   Agreements must therefore be kept by the Government\nas well as by the individual, and if the plain-error doctrine\ncan ever rescue a defendant from the consequence of for\nfeiting rights by inattention, it should be used when the\nGovernment has induced an admission of criminality by\nmaking an agreement that it deliberately breaks after the\ndefendant has satisfied his end of the bargain. Redressing\nsuch fundamentally unfair behavior by the Government,\nwhether by vacating the plea or enforcing the plea agree\nment, see Santobello v. New York, 404 U. S. 257, 263\n(1971), is worth the undoubted risk of allowing a defen\ndant to game the system and the additional administra\ntive burdens, see ante, at 5, 10–11. If the Judiciary is\nworried about gamesmanship and extra proceedings, all it\nneeds to do is to minimize their likelihood by making it\nplain that it will require the Government to keep its word\nor seek rescission of the plea agreement if it has cause to\ndo so. Thus, I would find that a defendant’s substantial\nrights have been violated whenever the Government\nbreaches a plea agreement, unless the defendant got just\nwhat he bargained for anyway from the sentencing court.\n   What I have said about the third Olano criterion deter\nmines my treatment of the fourth, addressing whether\nleaving the error uncorrected “may be said . . . ‘seriously\n[to] affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of\njudicial proceedings.’ ” Olano, supra, at 744 (quoting\nUnited States v. Atkinson, 297 U. S. 157, 160 (1936)). If I\nam right that in this case the protected interest is in the\nguarantee that no one is liable to spend a day behind bars\nas a convict without a trial or his own agreement, then the\nfairness and integrity of the Judicial Branch suffer when a\ncourt imprisons a defendant after he pleaded guilty in\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

That is\nprecisely what happened here, yet the Judiciary denies\nrelief under an appellate procedure for correcting patent\nerror. Judicial repute does not escape without damage in\nthe eyes of anyone who sees beyond the oddity of this case.\n  Puckett is entitled to relief because he and every other\ndefendant who may make an agreement with the Govern\nment are entitled to take the Government at its word.\nPuckett insists that the Government keep its word, and if\nwe are going to have a plain-error doctrine at all, the\nJudiciary has no excuse for closing this generally available\navenue of redress to Puckett or to any other criminal\ndefendant standing in his shoes.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145896/", "sha1": "4078939fd9109d50b3fd6253b2a1a17b3cbbd888", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-035", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:09:17"}
