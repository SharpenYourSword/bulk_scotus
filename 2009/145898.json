COLORADO\n\n          ON EXCEPTION TO REPORT OF SPECIAL MASTER\n\n   No. 105, Orig. Argued December 1, 2008—Decided March 9, 2009\nKansas has filed an exception to the Special Master’s Fifth and Final\n Report in this action concerning the Arkansas River, contending that\n the Special Master erred in concluding that 28 U. S. C. §1821(b),\n which sets the witness attendance fee for a proceeding in “any court\n of the United States” at $40 per day, applies to cases within this\n Court’s original jurisdiction. This determination led to an award\n considerably lower than the amount that Kansas, as the prevailing\n party, would have received under its alternative calculation.\nHeld: Expert witness attendance fees that are available in cases\n brought under this Court’s original jurisdiction shall be the same as\n the expert witness attendance fees that would be available in a dis\n trict court under §1821(b). Kansas contends that Congress has never\n attempted to regulate a prevailing party’s recovery of expert witness\n fees in a case brought under this Court’s original jurisdiction, that\n Article III of the Constitution would not permit Congress to impose\n such a restriction, and thus, that the holding in Crawford Fitting Co.\n v. J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437, 444—that district courts must\n adhere to §1821(b)’s witness attendance fee limitations—is not rele\n vant here. Assuming that Kansas’ interpretation is correct and that\n this Court has discretion to determine the fees that are recoverable in\n original actions, it is nevertheless appropriate to follow §1821(b).\n Congress’ decision not to permit a prevailing party in the lower\n courts to recover its actual witness fee expenses departs only slightly\n from the “American Rule,” under which parties generally bear their\n own expenses. There is no good reason why the rule for recovering\n expert witness fees should differ markedly depending on whether a\n case is originally brought in district court or this Court. District\n court cases may be no less complex than those brought originally in\n this Court. And while the parties in original cases may incur sub\n2                        KANSAS v.

STATE OF \n\n                  COLORADO \n\n       ON EXCEPTION TO REPORT OF SPECIAL MASTER\n                                 [March 9, 2009]\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This is the latest in a line of contested matters that have\ncome before us in this action that was brought in this\nCourt by the State of Kansas against the State of Colorado\nconcerning the Arkansas River. The Special Master has\nfiled a Fifth and Final Report that includes a proposed\njudgment and decree, and Kansas has filed an exception to\nthe Report, contending that the Special Master erred in\nconcluding that 28 U. S. C. §1821, which sets the witness\nattendance fee for a proceeding in “any court of the United\nStates” at $40 per day, applies to cases within this Court’s\noriginal jurisdiction. Assuming for the sake of argument\nthat Kansas is correct in its interpretation of the statutes\nat issue in this matter and that this Court has the author\nity to determine the amount that Kansas should recover in\nexpert witness fees, we hold that the fee set out in §1821 is\nnevertheless the appropriate fee. Accordingly, we overrule\nKansas’ exception and approve the entry of the proposed\njudgment and decree.\n                             I\n  Kansas filed this original action in 1985, claiming that\nColorado had violated the Arkansas River Compact (Com\n2                      KANSAS v. COLORADO\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npact),1 63 Stat. 145, by drilling irrigation wells that de\npleted water that should have been available for users in\nKansas. In 1995, we accepted the recommendation of the\nSpecial Master that Colorado’s wells had violated the\nCompact, and we remanded for further proceedings to\ndetermine appropriate remedies. See Kansas v. Colorado,\n514 U. S. 673. The Special Master then recommended\nthat monetary damages be awarded as compensation. In\n2001, we accepted all but one of the Special Master’s\nrecommendations, modifying the remaining recommenda\ntion with respect to the starting date for an award of\nprejudgment interest. See Kansas v. Colorado, 533 U. S.\n1. In 2004, we approved additional recommendations by\nthe Special Master,2 and the case was again remanded.\nSee Kansas v. Colorado, 543 U. S. 86.\n   On remand, the Special Master approved a schedule to\nresolve remaining disputed issues. Consistent with our\nguidance, experts for the States were assigned greater\nresponsibility for discussing and resolving issues. Because\nof the contributions of expert witnesses and the use of the\nHydrologic-Institutional Model to determine compliance\nwith the Compact, the parties resolved most of the dis\nputed issues. See id., at 89.\n   The sole remaining issue concerns Kansas’ application\nfor expert witness fees. After the Special Master deter\nmined that Kansas was the prevailing party for purposes\n——————\n    1 The\n        Compact, which was approved by negotiators for the States of\nKansas and Colorado in 1948, allows post-Compact development in\nColorado provided that such development does not cause material\ndepletions of usable stateline flows.\n  2 The recommendations we approved in 2004 were: (1) that the Court\n\nnot appoint a River Master; (2) that the amount of prejudgment inter\nest be set; (3) that calculations regarding river depletions be made on a\n10-year basis in order to even out possible inaccuracies in computer\nmodeling; and (4) that a Colorado Water Court be given the authority to\nmake certain determinations relevant to continuing implementation of\nagreements reached through this litigation\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nof awarding “costs,” Kansas submitted two alternative\nproposals for calculating the amount that it was entitled\nto recover for the costs it had incurred in retaining expert\nwitnesses. The first proposal, which Kansas advocated,\nwas based on the assumption that these fees were not\nlimited by the $40 per day attendance fee set out in\n§1821(b) and called for an award of $9,214,727.81 in ex\npert witness fees. The other calculation, which was based\non the assumption that §1821(b) did apply, calculated the\namount that Kansas was entitled to recover for expert\nwitness fees at $162,927.94.\n  After hearing argument, the Special Master held that\n§1821 applies in cases within our original jurisdiction.\nBased on this holding, the two States entered into a cost\nsettlement agreement that provided for total witness costs\nof $199,577.19 but preserved the right of the States to file\nexceptions to the Special Master’s rulings on legal issues\nregarding costs.\n                             II\n   Kansas argues that the Special Master erred in holding\nthat §1821(b) applies to cases within our original jurisdic\ntion. Kansas contends that early statutes governing the\naward of costs in cases in the lower courts did not apply to\nthis Court’s original cases and that this scheme has been\ncarried forward to the present day. Kansas notes that the\nstatutory provision authorizing the taxation of costs, 28\nU. S. C. §1920, authorizes “[a] judge or clerk of any court\nof the United States” to tax as costs “[f]ees . . . for . . .\nwitnesses” and that the definition of the term “judge . . . of\nthe United States,” as used in Title 28, does not include a\nJustice of this Court. In Kansas’ view, §1911, which pro\nvides that “[t]he Supreme Court may fix the fees to be\ncharged by its clerk,” manifests Congress’ understanding\nthat we should have the authority to determine the fees\nthat may be recovered by a prevailing party in a case\n4                  KANSAS v. COLORADO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbrought under our original jurisdiction. Kansas further\nmaintains that “[e]ven if Congress had intended to regu\nlate taxation of costs in the original jurisdiction of this\nCourt, such an act would be subject to the Court’s ultimate\nauthority to regulate procedure within its constitutionally\ncreated original jurisdiction.” Kansas’ Exception and Brief\n10. Kansas therefore contends that our holding in Craw\nford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437, 444\n(1987), that district courts must adhere to the witness\nattendance fee limitations set forth in §1821(b), is not\nrelevant here.\n  Colorado disagrees. Citing our decision in Crawford\nFitting, Colorado argues that the $40 per day witness\nattendance fee limitation of §1821(b) applies not only to\ncases in the district courts but also to our original cases.\nColorado notes that §1821(a)(1) prescribes the witness\nattendance fee for a proceeding in “any court of the United\nStates” and that §1821(a)(2) defines the term “ ‘court of the\nUnited States’ ” to include this Court. Colorado also con\ntends that there is no precedent to support the argument\nthat the Constitution prohibits Congress from imposing a\nlimit on expert witness fees in cases within our original\njurisdiction, and Colorado sees no justification for an\naward of costs for expert witness fees in excess of the limit\nin §1821(b).\n                            III\n  We find it unnecessary to decide whether Congress has\nattempted to regulate the recovery of expert witness fees\nby a prevailing party in a case brought under our original\njurisdiction. Nor do we decide whether Kansas is correct\nin contending that Article III of the Constitution does not\npermit Congress to impose such a restriction. Assuming\nfor the sake of argument that Kansas is correct in arguing\nthat we have the discretion to determine the fees that are\nrecoverable in original actions, we conclude that it is\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnevertheless appropriate to follow §1821(b).\n   Congress’ decision not to permit a prevailing party in\nthe lower courts to recover its actual witness fee expenses\nmay be seen as a decision to depart only slightly from the\nso-called “American Rule,” under which parties generally\nbear their own expenses. See Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.\nv. Wilderness Society, 421 U. S. 240 (1975) (the American\nRule applies not only to attorney’s fees but also other costs\nof litigation, including expert witness fees and miscellane\nous costs such as transcripts and duplication). While this\npolicy choice is debatable, we see no good reason why the\nrule regarding the recovery of expert witness fees should\ndiffer markedly depending on whether a case is originally\nbrought in a district court or in this Court. Many cases\nbrought in the district courts are no less complex than\nthose brought originally in this Court. And while the\nparties in our original cases sometimes are required to\nincur very substantial expert costs, as happened in the\npresent case, the same is frequently true in lower court\nlitigation. Thus, assuming for the sake of argument that\nthe matter is left entirely to our discretion, we conclude\nthat the best approach is to have a uniform rule that\napplies in all federal cases.\n   We therefore hold that the expert witness attendance\nfees that are available in cases brought under our original\njurisdiction shall be the same as the expert witness atten\ndance fees that would be available in a district court under\n§1821(b). We thus overrule Kansas’ exception to the\nReport of the Special Master.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

I do so only, how\never, because the opinion expressly and carefully makes\nclear that it in no way infringes this Court’s authority to\ndecide on its own, in original cases, whether there should\nbe witness fees and what they should be.\n   Our appellate jurisdiction is, under the Constitution,\nsubject to “such Exceptions, and . . . such Regulations as\nthe Congress shall make.” Art. III, §2. Our original juris\ndiction is not. The Framers presumably “act[ed] inten\ntionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclu\nsion” of these terms. INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S.\n421, 432 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   It is accordingly our responsibility to determine matters\nrelated to our original jurisdiction, including the availabil\nity and amount of witness fees. For the reasons given by\nthe Court, I agree that $40 is a reasonable choice for the\nfees at issue here. But the choice is ours.\n</pre>", "id": 145898, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2009/03/09/Kansas_v._Colorado.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2008                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

C. §1920, authorizes “[a] judge or clerk of any court\nof the United States” to tax as costs “[f]ees . . . for . . .\nwitnesses” and that the definition of the term “judge . . . of\nthe United States,” as used in Title 28, does not include a\nJustice of this Court. In Kansas’ view, §1911, which pro\nvides that “[t]he Supreme Court may fix the fees to be\ncharged by its clerk,” manifests Congress’ understanding\nthat we should have the authority to determine the fees\nthat may be recovered by a prevailing party in a case\n4                  KANSAS v. COLORADO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbrought under our original jurisdiction. Kansas further\nmaintains that “[e]ven if Congress had intended to regu\nlate taxation of costs in the original jurisdiction of this\nCourt, such an act would be subject to the Court’s ultimate\nauthority to regulate procedure within its constitutionally\ncreated original jurisdiction.” Kansas’ Exception and Brief\n10. Kansas therefore contends that our holding in Craw\nford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437, 444\n(1987), that district courts must adhere to the witness\nattendance fee limitations set forth in §1821(b), is not\nrelevant here.\n  Colorado disagrees. Citing our decision in Crawford\nFitting, Colorado argues that the $40 per day witness\nattendance fee limitation of §1821(b) applies not only to\ncases in the district courts but also to our original cases.\nColorado notes that §1821(a)(1) prescribes the witness\nattendance fee for a proceeding in “any court of the United\nStates” and that §1821(a)(2) defines the term “ ‘court of the\nUnited States’ ” to include this Court. Colorado also con\ntends that there is no precedent to support the argument\nthat the Constitution prohibits Congress from imposing a\nlimit on expert witness fees in cases within our original\njurisdiction, and Colorado sees no justification for an\naward of costs for expert witness fees in excess of the limit\nin §1821(b).\n                            III\n  We find it unnecessary to decide whether Congress has\nattempted to regulate the recovery of expert witness fees\nby a prevailing party in a case brought under our original\njurisdiction. Nor do we decide whether Kansas is correct\nin contending that Article III of the Constitution does not\npermit Congress to impose such a restriction. Assuming\nfor the sake of argument that Kansas is correct in arguing\nthat we have the discretion to determine the fees that are\nrecoverable in original actions, we conclude that it is\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnevertheless appropriate to follow §1821(b).\n   Congress’ decision not to permit a prevailing party in\nthe lower courts to recover its actual witness fee expenses\nmay be seen as a decision to depart only slightly from the\nso-called “American Rule,” under which parties generally\nbear their own expenses. See Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.\nv. Wilderness Society, 421 U. S. 240 (1975) (the American\nRule applies not only to attorney’s fees but also other costs\nof litigation, including expert witness fees and miscellane\nous costs such as transcripts and duplication). While this\npolicy choice is debatable, we see no good reason why the\nrule regarding the recovery of expert witness fees should\ndiffer markedly depending on whether a case is originally\nbrought in a district court or in this Court. Many cases\nbrought in the district courts are no less complex than\nthose brought originally in this Court. And while the\nparties in our original cases sometimes are required to\nincur very substantial expert costs, as happened in the\npresent case, the same is frequently true in lower court\nlitigation. Thus, assuming for the sake of argument that\nthe matter is left entirely to our discretion, we conclude\nthat the best approach is to have a uniform rule that\napplies in all federal cases.\n   We therefore hold that the expert witness attendance\nfees that are available in cases brought under our original\njurisdiction shall be the same as the expert witness atten\ndance fees that would be available in a district court under\n§1821(b). We thus overrule Kansas’ exception to the\nReport of the Special Master.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

I do so only, how\never, because the opinion expressly and carefully makes\nclear that it in no way infringes this Court’s authority to\ndecide on its own, in original cases, whether there should\nbe witness fees and what they should be.\n   Our appellate jurisdiction is, under the Constitution,\nsubject to “such Exceptions, and . . . such Regulations as\nthe Congress shall make.” Art. III, §2. Our original juris\ndiction is not. The Framers presumably “act[ed] inten\ntionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclu\nsion” of these terms. INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S.\n421, 432 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   It is accordingly our responsibility to determine matters\nrelated to our original jurisdiction, including the availabil\nity and amount of witness fees. For the reasons given by\nthe Court, I agree that $40 is a reasonable choice for the\nfees at issue here.
