BRILLON\n\n       CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF VERMONT\n\n     No. 08–88. Argued January 13, 2009—Decided March 9, 2009\nIn July 2001, respondent Brillon was arrested on felony domestic as\n  sault and habitual offender charges. Nearly three years later, in\n  June 2004, he was tried by jury, found guilty as charged, and sen\n  tenced to 12 to 20 years in prison. During the time between his ar\n  rest and his trial, at least six different attorneys were appointed to\n  represent him. Brillon “fired” his first attorney, who served from\n  July 2001 to February 2002. His third lawyer, who served from\n  March 2002 until June 2002, was allowed to withdraw when he re\n  ported that Brillon had threatened his life. His fourth lawyer served\n  from June 2002 until November 2002, when the trial court released\n  him from the case. His fifth lawyer, assigned two months later,\n  withdrew in April 2003. Four months thereafter, his sixth lawyer\n  was assigned, and she took the case to trial in June 2004.\n     The trial court denied Brillon’s motion to dismiss for want of a\n  speedy trial. The Vermont Supreme Court, however, reversed, hold\n  ing that Brillon’s conviction must be vacated, and the charges against\n  him dismissed, because the State did not accord him the speedy trial\n  required by the Sixth Amendment. Citing the balancing test this\n  Court stated in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514, the Vermont Su\n  preme Court concluded that all four factors described in Barker—\n  “[l]ength of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant’s assertion\n  of his right, and prejudice to the defendant,” id., at 530—weighed\n  against the State. Weighing heavily in Brillon’s favor, the Vermont\n  court said, the three-year delay in bringing him to trial was “ex\n  treme.” In assessing the reasons for that delay, the court separately\n  considered the period of each counsel’s representation. It acknowl\n  edged that the first year, when Brillon was represented by his first\n  and third lawyers, should not count against the State. But the court\n  counted much of the remaining two years against the State. Delays\n2                        VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    in that period, the court determined, were caused, for the most part,\n    by the failure or unwillingness of several of the assigned counsel,\n    over an inordinate period of time, to move the case forward. As for\n    the third and fourth Barker v. Wingo factors, the court found that\n    Brillon repeatedly and adamantly demanded a trial and that his\n    lengthy pretrial incarceration was prejudicial.\nHeld: The Vermont Supreme Court erred in ranking assigned counsel\n essentially as state actors in the criminal justice system. Assigned\n counsel, just as retained counsel, act on behalf of their clients, and\n delays sought by counsel are ordinarily attributable to the defen\n dants they represent. Pp. 6–11.\n    (a) Primarily at issue here is the reason for the delay in Brillon’s\n trial. In applying Barker, the Court has asked “whether the govern\n ment or the criminal defendant is more to blame for th[e] delay.”\n Doggett v. United States, 505 U. S. 647, 651. Delay “to hamper the\n defense” weighs heavily against the prosecution, Barker, 407 U. S., at\n 531, while delay caused by the defense weighs against the defendant,\n id., at 529. Because “the attorney is the [defendant’s] agent when\n acting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation,” delay caused\n by the defendant’s counsel is charged against the defendant. Cole\n man v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 753. The same principle applies\n whether counsel is privately retained or publicly assigned, for\n “ ‘[o]nce a lawyer has undertaken the representation of an accused,\n the duties and obligations are the same whether the lawyer is pri\n vately retained, appointed, or serving in a legal aid or defender pro\n gram.’ ” Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U. S. 312, 318. Unlike a prose\n cutor or the court, assigned counsel ordinarily is not considered a\n state actor. Pp. 6–8.\n    (b) Although the balance arrived at in close cases ordinarily would\n not prompt this Court’s review, the Vermont Supreme Court made a\n fundamental error in its application of Barker that calls for this\n Court’s correction. The court erred in attributing to the State delays\n caused by the failure of several assigned counsel to move Brillon’s\n case forward and in failing adequately to take into account the role of\n Brillon’s disruptive behavior in the overall balance. Pp. 8–11.\n       (1) An assigned counsel’s failure to move the case forward does\n not warrant attribution of delay to the State. Most of the delay the\n Vermont court attributed to the State must therefore be attributed to\n Brillon as delays caused by his counsel, each of whom requested time\n extensions. Their inability or unwillingness to move the case forward\n may not be attributed to the State simply because they are assigned\n counsel. A contrary conclusion could encourage appointed counsel to\n delay proceedings by seeking unreasonable continuances, hoping\n thereby to obtain a dismissal of the indictment on speedy-trial\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  grounds. Trial courts might well respond by viewing continuance re\n  quests made by appointed counsel with skepticism, concerned that\n  even an apparently genuine need for more time is in reality a delay\n  tactic. Yet the same considerations would not attend a privately re\n  tained counsel’s requests for time extensions. There is no justifica\n  tion for treating defendants’ speedy-trial claims differently based on\n  whether their counsel is privately retained or publicly assigned.\n  Pp. 9–10.\n        (2) The Vermont Supreme Court further erred by treating the\n  period of each counsel’s representation discretely. The court failed\n  appropriately to take into account Brillon’s role during the first year\n  of delay. Brillon sought to dismiss his first attorney on the eve of\n  trial. His strident, aggressive behavior with regard to his third at\n  torney further impeded prompt trial and likely made it more difficult\n  for the Defender General’s office to find replacement counsel. Absent\n  Brillon’s efforts to force the withdrawal of his first and third attor\n  neys, no speedy-trial issue would have arisen. Pp. 10–11.\n     (c) The general rule attributing to the defendant delay caused by\n  assigned counsel is not absolute. Delay resulting from a systemic\n  breakdown in the public defender system could be charged to the\n  State. Cf. Polk County, 454 U. S., at 324–325. But the Vermont Su\n  preme Court made no determination, and nothing in the record sug\n  gests, that institutional problems caused any part of the delay in\n  Brillon’s case.

MICHAEL BRILLON\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                      VERMONT\n\n                                 [March 9, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case concerns the Sixth Amendment guarantee\nthat “[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy\nthe right to a speedy . . . trial.” Michael Brillon, defendant\nbelow, respondent here, was arrested in July 2001 on\nfelony domestic assault and habitual offender charges.\nNearly three years later, in June 2004, he was tried by\njury, found guilty as charged, and sentenced to 12 to 20\nyears in prison. The Vermont Supreme Court vacated\nBrillon’s conviction and held that the charges against him\nmust be dismissed because he had been denied his right to\na speedy trial.\n   During the time between Brillon’s arrest and his trial,\nat least six different attorneys were appointed to represent\nhim. Brillon “fired” the first, who served from July 2001\nto February 2002. His third lawyer, who served from\nMarch 2002 until June 2002, was allowed to withdraw\nwhen he reported that Brillon had threatened his life. The\nVermont Supreme Court charged against Brillon the\ndelays associated with those periods, but charged against\nthe State periods in which assigned counsel failed “to\nmove the case forward.” 955 A. 2d 1108, 1121, 1122\n2                     VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n(2008).\n  We hold that the Vermont Supreme Court erred in\nranking assigned counsel essentially as state actors in the\ncriminal justice system. Assigned counsel, just as retained\ncounsel, act on behalf of their clients, and delays sought by\ncounsel are ordinarily attributable to the defendants they\nrepresent. For a total of some six months of the time that\nelapsed between Brillon’s arrest and his trial, Brillon\nlacked an attorney. The State may be charged with those\nmonths if the gaps resulted from the trial court’s failure to\nappoint replacement counsel with dispatch. Similarly, the\nState may bear responsibility if there is “a breakdown in\nthe public defender system.” Id., at 1111. But, as the\nVermont Supreme Court acknowledged, id., at 1126, the\nrecord does not establish any such institutional break­\ndown.\n                              I\n   On July 27, 2001, Michael Brillon was arrested after\nstriking his girlfriend. Three days later he was arraigned\nin state court in Bennington County, Vermont and\ncharged with felony domestic assault. His alleged status\nas a habitual offender exposed him to a potential life\nsentence. The court ordered him held without bail.\n   Richard Ammons, from the county public defender’s\noffice, was assigned on the day of arraignment as Brillon’s\nfirst counsel.1 In October, Ammons filed a motion to\nrecuse the trial judge. It was denied the next month and\ntrial was scheduled for February 2002. In mid-January,\nAmmons moved for a continuance, but the State objected,\nand the trial court denied the motion.\n   On February 22, four days before the jury draw, Am­\n——————\n    1 Vermont’s\n              Defender General has “the primary responsibility for\nproviding needy persons with legal services.” Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 13,\n§5253(a) (1998). These services may be provided “personally, through\npublic defenders,” or through contract attorneys. Ibid.\n                      Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                       3\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nmons again moved for a continuance, citing his heavy\nworkload and the need for further investigation. Ammons\nacknowledged that any delay would not count (presumably\nagainst the State) for speedy-trial purposes. The State\nopposed the motion,2 and at the conclusion of a hearing,\nthe trial court denied it. Brillon, participating in the\nproceedings through interactive television, then an­\nnounced: “You’re fired, Rick.” App. 187. Three days later,\nthe trial court—over the State’s objection—granted Am­\nmons’ motion to withdraw as counsel, citing Brillon’s\ntermination of Ammons and Ammons’ statement that he\ncould no longer zealously represent Brillon.3 The trial\ncourt warned Brillon that further delay would occur while\na new attorney became familiar with the case. The same\nday, the trial court appointed a second attorney, but he\nimmediately withdrew based on a conflict.\n  On March 1, 2002, Gerard Altieri was assigned as Bril­\nlon’s third counsel. On May 20, Brillon filed a motion to\ndismiss Altieri for, among other reasons, failure to file\nmotions, “[v]irtually no communication whatsoever,” and\nhis lack of diligence “because of heavy case load.” Id., ¶¶2,\n5, at 113–114. At a June 11 hearing, Altieri denied sev­\neral of Brillon’s allegations, noted his disagreement with\nBrillon’s trial strategy,4 and insisted he had plenty of time\n——————\n   2 The State expressed its concern that the continuance request was\n\n“just part and parcel of an effort by the defense to have the Court not\nhear this matter.” App. 180. Under Vermont procedures, the judge\npresiding over the trial was scheduled to “rotate” out of the county\nwhere Brillon’s case was pending in March 2002. See id., ¶6, at 109.\nThus, a continuance past March would have caused a different judge to\npreside over Brillon’s trial, despite the denial of his motion to recuse\nthe initial judge. Ammons requested a continuance until April.\n   3 Ammons also cited as cause to withdraw, “certain irreconcilable\n\ndifferences in preferred approach between Mr. Brillon and counsel as to\ntrial strategy, as well as other legitimate legal decisions.” Id., ¶2, at\n104.\n   4 Specifically, Altieri appeared reluctant to follow Brillon’s tactic that\n4                      VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nto prepare. The State opposed Brillon’s motion as well.\nNear the end of the hearing, however, Altieri moved to\nwithdraw on the ground that Brillon had threatened his\nlife during a break in the proceedings. The trial court\ngranted Brillon’s motion to dismiss Altieri, but warned\nBrillon that “this is somewhat of a dubious victory in your\ncase because it simply prolongs the time that you will\nremain in jail until we can bring this matter to trial.” Id.,\nat 226.\n   That same day, the trial court appointed Paul\nDonaldson as Brillon’s fourth counsel. At an August 5\nstatus conference, Donaldson requested additional time to\nconduct discovery in light of his caseload. A few weeks\nlater, Brillon sent a letter to the court complaining about\nDonaldson’s unresponsiveness and lack of competence.\nTwo months later, Brillon filed a motion to dismiss\nDonaldson—similar to his motion to dismiss Altieri—for\nfailure to file motions and “virtually no communication\nwhatsoever.” Id., ¶¶1, 2, at 115–116. At a November 26\nhearing, Donaldson reported that his contract with the\nDefender General’s office had expired in June and that he\nhad been in discussions to have Brillon’s case reassigned.\nThe trial court released Donaldson from the case\n“[w]ithout making any findings regarding the adequacy of\n[Donaldson]’s representation.” 955 A. 2d, at 1119. Cf.\npost, at 2.\n   Brillon’s fifth counsel, David Sleigh, was not assigned\nuntil January 15, 2003; Brillon was without counsel dur­\ning the intervening two months. On February 25, Sleigh\nsought extensions of various discovery deadlines, noting\nthat he had been in trial out of town. App. 117. On April\n10, however, Sleigh withdrew from the case, based on\n—————— \n\nhe “bring in a lot of people” at trial, “some of them young kids and \n\nrelatives . . . in an attempt by Mr. Brillon—this is his theory—I don’t\n\nwant to use the words trash, [to] impeach [the victim].” Id., at 216–217. \n\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“modifications to [his] firm’s contract with the Defender\nGeneral.” Id., at 158.\n   Brillon was then without counsel for the next four\nmonths. On June 20, the Defender General’s office noti­\nfied the court that it had received “funding from the legis­\nlature” and would hire a new special felony unit defender\nfor Brillon. Id., at 159. On August 1, Kathleen Moore was\nappointed as Brillon’s sixth counsel. The trial court set\nNovember 7 as the deadline for motions, but granted\nseveral extensions in accord with the parties’ stipulation.\nOn February 23, 2004, Moore filed a motion to dismiss for\nlack of a speedy trial. The trial court denied the motion on\nApril 19.\n   The case finally went to trial on June 14, 2004. Brillon\nwas found guilty and sentenced to 12 to 20 years in prison.\nThe trial court denied a post-trial motion to dismiss for\nwant of a speedy trial, concluding that the delay in Bril­\nlon’s trial was “in large part the result of his own actions”\nand that Brillon had “failed to demonstrate prejudice as a\nresult of [the] pre-trial delay.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 72.\n   On appeal, the Vermont Supreme Court held 3 to 2 that\nBrillon’s conviction must be vacated and the charges\ndismissed for violation of his Sixth Amendment right to a\nspeedy trial. Citing the balancing test of Barker v. Wingo,\n407 U. S. 514 (1972), the majority concluded that all four\nof the factors described in Barker—“[l]ength of delay, the\nreason for the delay, the defendant’s assertion of his right,\nand prejudice to the defendant”—weighed against the\nState. Id., at 530.\n   The court first found that the three-year delay in bring­\ning Brillon to trial was “extreme” and weighed heavily in\nhis favor. See 955 A. 2d, at 1116. In assessing the rea­\nsons for that delay, the Vermont Supreme Court sepa­\nrately considered the period of each counsel’s representa­\ntion. It acknowledged that the first year, when Brillon\nwas represented by Ammons and Altieri, should not count\n6                       VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nagainst the State. Id., at 1120. But the court counted\nmuch of the remaining two years against the State for\ndelays “caused, for the most part, by the failure of several\nof defendant’s assigned counsel, over an inordinate period\nof time, to move his case forward.” Id., at 1122. As for the\nthird and fourth factors, the court found that Brillon\n“repeatedly and adamantly demanded to be tried,” ibid.,\nand that his “lengthy pretrial incarceration” was prejudi­\ncial, despite his insubstantial assertions of evidentiary\nprejudice, id., at 1125.\n   The dissent strongly disputed the majority’s characteri­\nzation of the periods of delay. It concluded that “the lion’s\nshare of delay in this case is attributable to defendant,\nand not to the state.” Id., at 1127. But for Brillon’s “re­\npeated maneuvers to dismiss his lawyers and avoid trial\nthrough the first eleven months following arraignment,”\nthe dissent explained, “the difficulty in finding additional\ncounsel would not have arisen.” Id., at 1128.\n   We granted certiorari, 554 U. S. ___ (2008),5 and now\nreverse the judgment of the Vermont Supreme Court.\n                             II\n    The Sixth Amendment guarantees that “[i]n all criminal\nprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy\n. . . trial.” The speedy-trial right is “amorphous,” “slip­\npery,” and “necessarily relative.” Barker, 407 U. S., at 522\n(quoting Beavers v. Haubert, 198 U. S. 77, 87 (1905)). It is\n“consistent with delays and depend[ent] upon circum­\n——————\n   5 Vermont’s Constitution contains a speedy-trial clause which reads:\n\n“[I]n all prosecutions for criminal offenses, a person hath a right to . . .\na speedy public trial by an impartial jury . . . .” Vt. Const., Ch. I, Art.\n10. Notably, the Vermont Supreme Court made no ruling under the\nState’s own prescription, but instead relied solely on the Federal\nConstitution. Because it did so, our review authority was properly\ninvoked and exercised. See Oregon v. Hass, 420 U. S. 714, 719–720\n(1975); Ginsburg, Book Review, 92 Harv. L. Rev. 340, 343–344 (1978).\nBut see post, at 1–4.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstances.” 407 U. S., at 522 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In Barker, the Court refused to “quantif[y]” the\nright “into a specified number of days or months” or to\nhinge the right on a defendant’s explicit request for a\nspeedy trial. Id., at 522–525. Rejecting such “inflexible\napproaches,” Barker established a “balancing test, in\nwhich the conduct of both the prosecution and the defen­\ndant are weighed.” Id., at 529, 530. “[S]ome of the fac­\ntors” that courts should weigh include “[l]ength of delay,\nthe reason for the delay, the defendant’s assertion of his\nright, and prejudice to the defendant.” Ibid.\n   Primarily at issue here is the reason for the delay in\nBrillon’s trial. Barker instructs that “different weights\nshould be assigned to different reasons,” id., at 531, and in\napplying Barker, we have asked “whether the government\nor the criminal defendant is more to blame for th[e] delay.”\nDoggett v. United States, 505 U. S. 647, 651 (1992). Delib­\nerate delay “to hamper the defense” weighs heavily\nagainst the prosecution.       Barker, 407 U. S., at 531.\n“[M]ore neutral reason[s] such as negligence or over­\ncrowded courts” weigh less heavily “but nevertheless\nshould be considered since the ultimate responsibility for\nsuch circumstances must rest with the government rather\nthan with the defendant.” Ibid.\n   In contrast, delay caused by the defense weighs against\nthe defendant: “[I]f delay is attributable to the defendant,\nthen his waiver may be given effect under standard waiver\ndoctrine.” Id., at 529. Cf. United States v. Loud Hawk,\n474 U. S. 302, 316 (1986) (noting that a defendant whose\ntrial was delayed by his interlocutory appeal “normally\nshould not be able . . . to reap the reward of dismissal for\nfailure to receive a speedy trial”). That rule accords with\nthe reality that defendants may have incentives to employ\ndelay as a “defense tactic”: delay may “work to the ac­\ncused’s advantage” because “witnesses may become un­\navailable or their memories may fade” over time. Barker,\n8                      VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n407 U. S., at 521.\n   Because “the attorney is the [defendant’s] agent when\nacting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation,”\ndelay caused by the defendant’s counsel is also charged\nagainst the defendant. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S.\n722, 753 (1991).6 The same principle applies whether\ncounsel is privately retained or publicly assigned, for\n“[o]nce a lawyer has undertaken the representation of an\naccused, the duties and obligations are the same whether\nthe lawyer is privately retained, appointed, or serving in a\nlegal aid or defender program.” Polk County v. Dodson,\n454 U. S. 312, 318 (1981) (internal quotation marks omit­\nted). “Except for the source of payment,” the relationship\nbetween a defendant and the public defender representing\nhim is “identical to that existing between any other lawyer\nand client.” Ibid.

Id., at 1111, 1122. In this case,\nthat court concluded, “a significant portion of the delay in\nbringing defendant to trial must be attributed to the state,\neven though most of the delay was caused by the inability\nor unwillingness of assigned counsel to move the case\nforward.” Id., at 1121.\n  We disagree. An assigned counsel’s failure “to move the\ncase forward” does not warrant attribution of delay to the\nState. Contrary to the Vermont Supreme Court’s analysis,\nassigned counsel generally are not state actors for pur­\nposes of a speedy-trial claim. While the Vermont Defender\nGeneral’s office is indeed “part of the criminal justice\nsystem,” ibid., the individual counsel here acted only on\nbehalf of Brillon, not the State. See Polk County, 454\nU. S., at 320–322 (rejecting the view that public defenders\nact under color of state law because they are paid by the\nState). See also supra, at 8.\n  Most of the delay that the Vermont Supreme Court\nattributed to the State must therefore be attributed to\nBrillon as delays caused by his counsel. During those\nperiods, Brillon was represented by Donaldson, Sleigh,\nand Moore, all of whom requested extensions and continu­\nances.8 Their “inability or unwillingness . . . to move the\n——————\n  8 The State conceded before the Vermont Supreme Court that the\n\nperiod of Sleigh’s representation—along with a six-month period of no\nrepresentation—was properly attributed to the State. 955 A. 2d 1108,\n10                      VERMONT v.

Trial courts might well\nrespond by viewing continuance requests made by ap­\npointed counsel with skepticism, concerned that even an\napparently genuine need for more time is in reality a delay\ntactic. Yet the same considerations would not attend a\nprivately retained counsel’s requests for time extensions.\nWe see no justification for treating defendants’ speedy­\ntrial claims differently based on whether their counsel is\nprivately retained or publicly assigned.\n                             B\n   In addition to making assigned counsel’s “failure . . . to\nmove [the] case forward” the touchstone of its speedy-trial\ninquiry, the Vermont Supreme Court further erred by\ntreating the period of each counsel’s representation dis­\ncretely. The factors identified in Barker “have no talis­\nmanic qualities; courts must still engage in a difficult and\nsensitive balancing process.” 407 U. S., at 533. Yet the\nVermont Supreme Court failed appropriately to take into\naccount Brillon’s role during the first year of delay in “the\nchain of events that started all this.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 46.\n   Brillon sought to dismiss Ammons on the eve of trial.\nHis strident, aggressive behavior with regard to Altieri,\nwhom he threatened, further impeded prompt trial and\nlikely made it more difficult for the Defender General’s\n——————\n1120–1121 (2008). The State sought to avoid its concession at oral\nargument before this Court, but in the alternative, noted that the\nperiod of Sleigh’s representation “is really inconsequential.” Tr. of Oral\nArg. 5–6. We agree that in light of the three-year delay caused mostly\nby Brillon, the attribution of Sleigh’s three-month representation does\nnot tip the balance for either side.\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

Just as a State’s\n“deliberate attempt to delay the trial in order to hamper\nthe defense should be weighted heavily against the\n[State],” Barker, 407 U. S., at 531, so too should a defen­\ndant’s deliberate attempt to disrupt proceedings be\nweighted heavily against the defendant. Absent Brillon’s\ndeliberate efforts to force the withdrawal of Ammons and\nAltieri, no speedy-trial issue would have arisen.

But the Vermont\nSupreme Court made no determination, and nothing in\nthe record suggests, that institutional problems caused\nany part of the delay in Brillon’s case.\n  In sum, delays caused by defense counsel are properly\nattributed to the defendant, even where counsel is as­\nsigned. “[A]ny inquiry into a speedy trial claim necessi­\ntates a functional analysis of the right in the particular\ncontext of the case,” Barker, 407 U.

Wingo,\n407 U. S. 514 (1972).” Pet. for Cert. i, ¶1. The case, in my\nview, does not squarely present that question, for the\nVermont Supreme Court, when it found Michael Brillon’s\ntrial unconstitutionally delayed, did not count such delays\nagainst the State. The court’s opinion for the most part\nmakes that fact clear; at worst some passages are ambigu­\nous. Given these circumstances, I would dismiss the writ\nof certiorari as improvidently granted.\n                              I\n  The relevant time period consists of slightly less than\nthree years, stretching from July 2001, when Brillon was\nindicted, until mid-June 2004, when he was convicted and\nsentenced. In light of Brillon’s improper behavior, see\nante, at 3–4, the Vermont Supreme Court did not count\nmonths 1 through 12 (mid-July 2001 through mid-June\n2002) against the State. Noting the objection that Brillon\nhad sought to “intentionally sabotag[e] the criminal pro­\nceedings against him,” the Vermont Supreme Court was\nexplicit that this time period “do[es] not count . . . against\nthe [S]tate.” 955 A. 2d 1108, 1120 (2008).\n2                  VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   The Vermont Supreme Court did count months 13\nthrough 17 (mid-June 2002 through November 2002)\nagainst the State. It did so under circumstances where (1)\nBrillon’s counsel, Paul Donaldson, revealed that his con­\ntract with the defender general’s office had expired in\nJune 2002—shortly after (perhaps before!) he took over as\nBrillon’s counsel, App. 232–233, (2) he stated that this\ncase was “basically the beginning of [his] departure from\nthe contract,” ibid., and (3) he made no filings, missed\nseveral deadlines, did “little or nothing” to “move the case\nforward,” and made only one brief appearance at a status\nconference in mid-August. 955 A. 2d, at 1121. I believe it\nfairer to characterize this period, not as a period in which\n“assigned counsel” failed to move the case forward, ante, at\n1, but as a period in which Brillon, in practice, had no\nassigned counsel. And, given that the State conceded its\nresponsibility for delays caused by another defender who\nresigned for “contractual reasons,” see infra at 3, it is\nhardly unreasonable that the Vermont Supreme Court\ncounted this period of delay against the State.\n   The Vermont Supreme Court also counted months 18\nthrough 25 (the end of November 2002 through July 2003)\nagainst the State. It did so because the State conceded in\nits brief that this period of delay “cannot be attributed to\nthe defendant.” App. 78 (emphasis added). This conces­\nsion is not surprising in light of the fact that during much\nof this period, Brillon was represented by David Sleigh, a\ncontract attorney, who during the course of his represen­\ntation filed nothing on Brillon’s behalf except a single\nmotion seeking to extend discovery. The record reflects no\nother actions by Sleigh other than a letter sent to Brillon\ninforming him that “[a]s a result of modifications to our\nfirm’s contract with the Defender General, we will not be\nrepresenting you in your pending case.” Id., at 158. Bril­\nlon was left without counsel for a period of nearly six\nmonths. The State explained in conceding its responsibil­\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

But it is impossible to conclude from the opin­\nion whether it did so because it held the State responsible\nfor the defender’s failure to “move the case forward,” or for\nother reasons having nothing to do with counsel, namely\nthe judge’s unavailability, see id., at 138, or the fact that\n“the [case] files were incomplete” and “additional docu­\nments were needed from the State,” 955 A. 2d, at 1120–\n1121. Treating the opinion as charging the State on the\nbasis of the defender’s conduct is made more difficult by\nthe fact that Brillon did not argue below that Kathleen\nMoore, his defender during this period, caused any delays.\nAppellant’s Reply Brief in No. 2005–167 (Vt.), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">990004</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *7.\n                              II\n  In sum, I can find no convincing reason to believe the\nVermont Supreme Court made the error of constitutional\nlaw that the majority attributes to it. Rather than read\nambiguities in its opinion against it, thereby assuming the\npresence of the error the Court finds, I would dismiss the\nwrit as improvidently granted. As a majority nonetheless\nwishes to decide the case, I would note that the Vermont\nSupreme Court has considerable authority to supervise\nthe appointment of public defenders. See Vt. Stat. Ann.,\nTit. 13, §§5204, 5272 (1998); see also Vt. Rule Crim. Proc.\n44 (2003). It consequently warrants leeway when it de­\ncides whether a particular failing is properly attributed to\nassigned counsel or instead to the failure of the defender\ngeneral’s office properly to assign counsel.

Argued January 13, 2009—Decided March 9, 2009\nIn July 2001, respondent Brillon was arrested on felony domestic as\n  sault and habitual offender charges. Nearly three years later, in\n  June 2004, he was tried by jury, found guilty as charged, and sen\n  tenced to 12 to 20 years in prison. During the time between his ar\n  rest and his trial, at least six different attorneys were appointed to\n  represent him. Brillon “fired” his first attorney, who served from\n  July 2001 to February 2002. His third lawyer, who served from\n  March 2002 until June 2002, was allowed to withdraw when he re\n  ported that Brillon had threatened his life. His fourth lawyer served\n  from June 2002 until November 2002, when the trial court released\n  him from the case. His fifth lawyer, assigned two months later,\n  withdrew in April 2003. Four months thereafter, his sixth lawyer\n  was assigned, and she took the case to trial in June 2004.\n     The trial court denied Brillon’s motion to dismiss for want of a\n  speedy trial. The Vermont Supreme Court, however, reversed, hold\n  ing that Brillon’s conviction must be vacated, and the charges against\n  him dismissed, because the State did not accord him the speedy trial\n  required by the Sixth Amendment. Citing the balancing test this\n  Court stated in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514, the Vermont Su\n  preme Court concluded that all four factors described in Barker—\n  “[l]ength of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant’s assertion\n  of his right, and prejudice to the defendant,” id., at 530—weighed\n  against the State. Weighing heavily in Brillon’s favor, the Vermont\n  court said, the three-year delay in bringing him to trial was “ex\n  treme.” In assessing the reasons for that delay, the court separately\n  considered the period of each counsel’s representation. It acknowl\n  edged that the first year, when Brillon was represented by his first\n  and third lawyers, should not count against the State. But the court\n  counted much of the remaining two years against the State. Delays\n2                        VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    in that period, the court determined, were caused, for the most part,\n    by the failure or unwillingness of several of the assigned counsel,\n    over an inordinate period of time, to move the case forward. As for\n    the third and fourth Barker v. Wingo factors, the court found that\n    Brillon repeatedly and adamantly demanded a trial and that his\n    lengthy pretrial incarceration was prejudicial.\nHeld: The Vermont Supreme Court erred in ranking assigned counsel\n essentially as state actors in the criminal justice system. Assigned\n counsel, just as retained counsel, act on behalf of their clients, and\n delays sought by counsel are ordinarily attributable to the defen\n dants they represent. Pp. 6–11.\n    (a) Primarily at issue here is the reason for the delay in Brillon’s\n trial. In applying Barker, the Court has asked “whether the govern\n ment or the criminal defendant is more to blame for th[e] delay.”\n Doggett v. United States, 505 U. S. 647, 651. Delay “to hamper the\n defense” weighs heavily against the prosecution, Barker, 407 U. S., at\n 531, while delay caused by the defense weighs against the defendant,\n id., at 529. Because “the attorney is the [defendant’s] agent when\n acting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation,” delay caused\n by the defendant’s counsel is charged against the defendant. Cole\n man v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 753. The same principle applies\n whether counsel is privately retained or publicly assigned, for\n “ ‘[o]nce a lawyer has undertaken the representation of an accused,\n the duties and obligations are the same whether the lawyer is pri\n vately retained, appointed, or serving in a legal aid or defender pro\n gram.’ ” Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U. S. 312, 318. Unlike a prose\n cutor or the court, assigned counsel ordinarily is not considered a\n state actor. Pp. 6–8.\n    (b) Although the balance arrived at in close cases ordinarily would\n not prompt this Court’s review, the Vermont Supreme Court made a\n fundamental error in its application of Barker that calls for this\n Court’s correction. The court erred in attributing to the State delays\n caused by the failure of several assigned counsel to move Brillon’s\n case forward and in failing adequately to take into account the role of\n Brillon’s disruptive behavior in the overall balance. Pp. 8–11.\n       (1) An assigned counsel’s failure to move the case forward does\n not warrant attribution of delay to the State. Most of the delay the\n Vermont court attributed to the State must therefore be attributed to\n Brillon as delays caused by his counsel, each of whom requested time\n extensions. Their inability or unwillingness to move the case forward\n may not be attributed to the State simply because they are assigned\n counsel. A contrary conclusion could encourage appointed counsel to\n delay proceedings by seeking unreasonable continuances, hoping\n thereby to obtain a dismissal of the indictment on speedy-trial\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

Trial courts might well respond by viewing continuance re\n  quests made by appointed counsel with skepticism, concerned that\n  even an apparently genuine need for more time is in reality a delay\n  tactic. Yet the same considerations would not attend a privately re\n  tained counsel’s requests for time extensions. There is no justifica\n  tion for treating defendants’ speedy-trial claims differently based on\n  whether their counsel is privately retained or publicly assigned.\n  Pp. 9–10.\n        (2) The Vermont Supreme Court further erred by treating the\n  period of each counsel’s representation discretely. The court failed\n  appropriately to take into account Brillon’s role during the first year\n  of delay. Brillon sought to dismiss his first attorney on the eve of\n  trial. His strident, aggressive behavior with regard to his third at\n  torney further impeded prompt trial and likely made it more difficult\n  for the Defender General’s office to find replacement counsel. Absent\n  Brillon’s efforts to force the withdrawal of his first and third attor\n  neys, no speedy-trial issue would have arisen. Pp. 10–11.\n     (c) The general rule attributing to the defendant delay caused by\n  assigned counsel is not absolute. Delay resulting from a systemic\n  breakdown in the public defender system could be charged to the\n  State. Cf. Polk County, 454 U. S., at 324–325. But the Vermont Su\n  preme Court made no determination, and nothing in the record sug\n  gests, that institutional problems caused any part of the delay in\n  Brillon’s case.

The Vermont Supreme Court vacated\nBrillon’s conviction and held that the charges against him\nmust be dismissed because he had been denied his right to\na speedy trial.\n   During the time between Brillon’s arrest and his trial,\nat least six different attorneys were appointed to represent\nhim. Brillon “fired” the first, who served from July 2001\nto February 2002. His third lawyer, who served from\nMarch 2002 until June 2002, was allowed to withdraw\nwhen he reported that Brillon had threatened his life. The\nVermont Supreme Court charged against Brillon the\ndelays associated with those periods, but charged against\nthe State periods in which assigned counsel failed “to\nmove the case forward.” 955 A. 2d 1108, 1121, 1122\n2                     VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n(2008).\n  We hold that the Vermont Supreme Court erred in\nranking assigned counsel essentially as state actors in the\ncriminal justice system. Assigned counsel, just as retained\ncounsel, act on behalf of their clients, and delays sought by\ncounsel are ordinarily attributable to the defendants they\nrepresent. For a total of some six months of the time that\nelapsed between Brillon’s arrest and his trial, Brillon\nlacked an attorney. The State may be charged with those\nmonths if the gaps resulted from the trial court’s failure to\nappoint replacement counsel with dispatch. Similarly, the\nState may bear responsibility if there is “a breakdown in\nthe public defender system.” Id., at 1111. But, as the\nVermont Supreme Court acknowledged, id., at 1126, the\nrecord does not establish any such institutional break­\ndown.\n                              I\n   On July 27, 2001, Michael Brillon was arrested after\nstriking his girlfriend. Three days later he was arraigned\nin state court in Bennington County, Vermont and\ncharged with felony domestic assault. His alleged status\nas a habitual offender exposed him to a potential life\nsentence. The court ordered him held without bail.\n   Richard Ammons, from the county public defender’s\noffice, was assigned on the day of arraignment as Brillon’s\nfirst counsel.1 In October, Ammons filed a motion to\nrecuse the trial judge. It was denied the next month and\ntrial was scheduled for February 2002. In mid-January,\nAmmons moved for a continuance, but the State objected,\nand the trial court denied the motion.\n   On February 22, four days before the jury draw, Am­\n——————\n    1 Vermont’s\n              Defender General has “the primary responsibility for\nproviding needy persons with legal services.” Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 13,\n§5253(a) (1998). These services may be provided “personally, through\npublic defenders,” or through contract attorneys. Ibid.\n                      Cite as: 556 U.

Ammons\nacknowledged that any delay would not count (presumably\nagainst the State) for speedy-trial purposes. The State\nopposed the motion,2 and at the conclusion of a hearing,\nthe trial court denied it. Brillon, participating in the\nproceedings through interactive television, then an­\nnounced: “You’re fired, Rick.” App. 187. Three days later,\nthe trial court—over the State’s objection—granted Am­\nmons’ motion to withdraw as counsel, citing Brillon’s\ntermination of Ammons and Ammons’ statement that he\ncould no longer zealously represent Brillon.3 The trial\ncourt warned Brillon that further delay would occur while\na new attorney became familiar with the case. The same\nday, the trial court appointed a second attorney, but he\nimmediately withdrew based on a conflict.\n  On March 1, 2002, Gerard Altieri was assigned as Bril­\nlon’s third counsel. On May 20, Brillon filed a motion to\ndismiss Altieri for, among other reasons, failure to file\nmotions, “[v]irtually no communication whatsoever,” and\nhis lack of diligence “because of heavy case load.” Id., ¶¶2,\n5, at 113–114. At a June 11 hearing, Altieri denied sev­\neral of Brillon’s allegations, noted his disagreement with\nBrillon’s trial strategy,4 and insisted he had plenty of time\n——————\n   2 The State expressed its concern that the continuance request was\n\n“just part and parcel of an effort by the defense to have the Court not\nhear this matter.” App. 180. Under Vermont procedures, the judge\npresiding over the trial was scheduled to “rotate” out of the county\nwhere Brillon’s case was pending in March 2002. See id., ¶6, at 109.\nThus, a continuance past March would have caused a different judge to\npreside over Brillon’s trial, despite the denial of his motion to recuse\nthe initial judge. Ammons requested a continuance until April.\n   3 Ammons also cited as cause to withdraw, “certain irreconcilable\n\ndifferences in preferred approach between Mr. Brillon and counsel as to\ntrial strategy, as well as other legitimate legal decisions.” Id., ¶2, at\n104.\n   4 Specifically, Altieri appeared reluctant to follow Brillon’s tactic that\n4                      VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nto prepare. The State opposed Brillon’s motion as well.\nNear the end of the hearing, however, Altieri moved to\nwithdraw on the ground that Brillon had threatened his\nlife during a break in the proceedings. The trial court\ngranted Brillon’s motion to dismiss Altieri, but warned\nBrillon that “this is somewhat of a dubious victory in your\ncase because it simply prolongs the time that you will\nremain in jail until we can bring this matter to trial.” Id.,\nat 226.\n   That same day, the trial court appointed Paul\nDonaldson as Brillon’s fourth counsel. At an August 5\nstatus conference, Donaldson requested additional time to\nconduct discovery in light of his caseload. A few weeks\nlater, Brillon sent a letter to the court complaining about\nDonaldson’s unresponsiveness and lack of competence.\nTwo months later, Brillon filed a motion to dismiss\nDonaldson—similar to his motion to dismiss Altieri—for\nfailure to file motions and “virtually no communication\nwhatsoever.” Id., ¶¶1, 2, at 115–116. At a November 26\nhearing, Donaldson reported that his contract with the\nDefender General’s office had expired in June and that he\nhad been in discussions to have Brillon’s case reassigned.\nThe trial court released Donaldson from the case\n“[w]ithout making any findings regarding the adequacy of\n[Donaldson]’s representation.” 955 A. 2d, at 1119. Cf.\npost, at 2.\n   Brillon’s fifth counsel, David Sleigh, was not assigned\nuntil January 15, 2003; Brillon was without counsel dur­\ning the intervening two months. On February 25, Sleigh\nsought extensions of various discovery deadlines, noting\nthat he had been in trial out of town. App. 117. On April\n10, however, Sleigh withdrew from the case, based on\n—————— \n\nhe “bring in a lot of people” at trial, “some of them young kids and \n\nrelatives . . . in an attempt by Mr. Brillon—this is his theory—I don’t\n\nwant to use the words trash, [to] impeach [the victim].” Id., at 216–217. \n\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

On June 20, the Defender General’s office noti­\nfied the court that it had received “funding from the legis­\nlature” and would hire a new special felony unit defender\nfor Brillon. Id., at 159. On August 1, Kathleen Moore was\nappointed as Brillon’s sixth counsel. The trial court set\nNovember 7 as the deadline for motions, but granted\nseveral extensions in accord with the parties’ stipulation.\nOn February 23, 2004, Moore filed a motion to dismiss for\nlack of a speedy trial. The trial court denied the motion on\nApril 19.\n   The case finally went to trial on June 14, 2004. Brillon\nwas found guilty and sentenced to 12 to 20 years in prison.\nThe trial court denied a post-trial motion to dismiss for\nwant of a speedy trial, concluding that the delay in Bril­\nlon’s trial was “in large part the result of his own actions”\nand that Brillon had “failed to demonstrate prejudice as a\nresult of [the] pre-trial delay.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 72.\n   On appeal, the Vermont Supreme Court held 3 to 2 that\nBrillon’s conviction must be vacated and the charges\ndismissed for violation of his Sixth Amendment right to a\nspeedy trial. Citing the balancing test of Barker v. Wingo,\n407 U. S. 514 (1972), the majority concluded that all four\nof the factors described in Barker—“[l]ength of delay, the\nreason for the delay, the defendant’s assertion of his right,\nand prejudice to the defendant”—weighed against the\nState. Id., at 530.\n   The court first found that the three-year delay in bring­\ning Brillon to trial was “extreme” and weighed heavily in\nhis favor. See 955 A. 2d, at 1116. In assessing the rea­\nsons for that delay, the Vermont Supreme Court sepa­\nrately considered the period of each counsel’s representa­\ntion. It acknowledged that the first year, when Brillon\nwas represented by Ammons and Altieri, should not count\n6                       VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nagainst the State. Id., at 1120. But the court counted\nmuch of the remaining two years against the State for\ndelays “caused, for the most part, by the failure of several\nof defendant’s assigned counsel, over an inordinate period\nof time, to move his case forward.” Id., at 1122. As for the\nthird and fourth factors, the court found that Brillon\n“repeatedly and adamantly demanded to be tried,” ibid.,\nand that his “lengthy pretrial incarceration” was prejudi­\ncial, despite his insubstantial assertions of evidentiary\nprejudice, id., at 1125.\n   The dissent strongly disputed the majority’s characteri­\nzation of the periods of delay. It concluded that “the lion’s\nshare of delay in this case is attributable to defendant,\nand not to the state.” Id., at 1127. But for Brillon’s “re­\npeated maneuvers to dismiss his lawyers and avoid trial\nthrough the first eleven months following arraignment,”\nthe dissent explained, “the difficulty in finding additional\ncounsel would not have arisen.” Id., at 1128.\n   We granted certiorari, 554 U. S. ___ (2008),5 and now\nreverse the judgment of the Vermont Supreme Court.\n                             II\n    The Sixth Amendment guarantees that “[i]n all criminal\nprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy\n. . . trial.” The speedy-trial right is “amorphous,” “slip­\npery,” and “necessarily relative.” Barker, 407 U.

Const., Ch. I, Art.\n10. Notably, the Vermont Supreme Court made no ruling under the\nState’s own prescription, but instead relied solely on the Federal\nConstitution. Because it did so, our review authority was properly\ninvoked and exercised. See Oregon v. Hass, 420 U. S. 714, 719–720\n(1975); Ginsburg, Book Review, 92 Harv. L. Rev. 340, 343–344 (1978).\nBut see post, at 1–4.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstances.” 407 U. S., at 522 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In Barker, the Court refused to “quantif[y]” the\nright “into a specified number of days or months” or to\nhinge the right on a defendant’s explicit request for a\nspeedy trial. Id., at 522–525. Rejecting such “inflexible\napproaches,” Barker established a “balancing test, in\nwhich the conduct of both the prosecution and the defen­\ndant are weighed.” Id., at 529, 530. “[S]ome of the fac­\ntors” that courts should weigh include “[l]ength of delay,\nthe reason for the delay, the defendant’s assertion of his\nright, and prejudice to the defendant.” Ibid.\n   Primarily at issue here is the reason for the delay in\nBrillon’s trial. Barker instructs that “different weights\nshould be assigned to different reasons,” id., at 531, and in\napplying Barker, we have asked “whether the government\nor the criminal defendant is more to blame for th[e] delay.”\nDoggett v. United States, 505 U. S. 647, 651 (1992). Delib­\nerate delay “to hamper the defense” weighs heavily\nagainst the prosecution.       Barker, 407 U. S., at 531.\n“[M]ore neutral reason[s] such as negligence or over­\ncrowded courts” weigh less heavily “but nevertheless\nshould be considered since the ultimate responsibility for\nsuch circumstances must rest with the government rather\nthan with the defendant.” Ibid.\n   In contrast, delay caused by the defense weighs against\nthe defendant: “[I]f delay is attributable to the defendant,\nthen his waiver may be given effect under standard waiver\ndoctrine.” Id., at 529. Cf. United States v. Loud Hawk,\n474 U. S. 302, 316 (1986) (noting that a defendant whose\ntrial was delayed by his interlocutory appeal “normally\nshould not be able . . . to reap the reward of dismissal for\nfailure to receive a speedy trial”). That rule accords with\nthe reality that defendants may have incentives to employ\ndelay as a “defense tactic”: delay may “work to the ac­\ncused’s advantage” because “witnesses may become un­\navailable or their memories may fade” over time. Barker,\n8                      VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n407 U. S., at 521.\n   Because “the attorney is the [defendant’s] agent when\nacting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation,”\ndelay caused by the defendant’s counsel is also charged\nagainst the defendant. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S.\n722, 753 (1991).6 The same principle applies whether\ncounsel is privately retained or publicly assigned, for\n“[o]nce a lawyer has undertaken the representation of an\naccused, the duties and obligations are the same whether\nthe lawyer is privately retained, appointed, or serving in a\nlegal aid or defender program.” Polk County v. Dodson,\n454 U. S. 312, 318 (1981) (internal quotation marks omit­\nted). “Except for the source of payment,” the relationship\nbetween a defendant and the public defender representing\nhim is “identical to that existing between any other lawyer\nand client.” Ibid. Unlike a prosecutor or the court, as­\nsigned counsel ordinarily is not considered a state actor.7\n                            III\n   Barker’s formulation “necessarily compels courts to\napproach speedy trial cases on an ad hoc basis,” 407 U. S.,\nat 530, and the balance arrived at in close cases ordinarily\nwould not prompt this Court’s review. But the Vermont\nSupreme Court made a fundamental error in its applica­\ntion of Barker that calls for this Court’s correction. The\n——————\n  6 Several States’ speedy-trial statutes expressly exclude from compu­\n\ntation of the time limit continuances and delays caused by the defen­\ndant or defense counsel. See, e.g., Cal.

Id., at 1111, 1122. In this case,\nthat court concluded, “a significant portion of the delay in\nbringing defendant to trial must be attributed to the state,\neven though most of the delay was caused by the inability\nor unwillingness of assigned counsel to move the case\nforward.” Id., at 1121.\n  We disagree. An assigned counsel’s failure “to move the\ncase forward” does not warrant attribution of delay to the\nState. Contrary to the Vermont Supreme Court’s analysis,\nassigned counsel generally are not state actors for pur­\nposes of a speedy-trial claim. While the Vermont Defender\nGeneral’s office is indeed “part of the criminal justice\nsystem,” ibid., the individual counsel here acted only on\nbehalf of Brillon, not the State. See Polk County, 454\nU. S., at 320–322 (rejecting the view that public defenders\nact under color of state law because they are paid by the\nState). See also supra, at 8.\n  Most of the delay that the Vermont Supreme Court\nattributed to the State must therefore be attributed to\nBrillon as delays caused by his counsel. During those\nperiods, Brillon was represented by Donaldson, Sleigh,\nand Moore, all of whom requested extensions and continu­\nances.8 Their “inability or unwillingness . . . to move the\n——————\n  8 The State conceded before the Vermont Supreme Court that the\n\nperiod of Sleigh’s representation—along with a six-month period of no\nrepresentation—was properly attributed to the State. 955 A. 2d 1108,\n10                      VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncase forward,” 955 A. 2d, at 1121, may not be attributed to\nthe State simply because they are assigned counsel.\n   A contrary conclusion could encourage appointed coun­\nsel to delay proceedings by seeking unreasonable continu­\nances, hoping thereby to obtain a dismissal of the indict­\nment on speedy-trial grounds. Trial courts might well\nrespond by viewing continuance requests made by ap­\npointed counsel with skepticism, concerned that even an\napparently genuine need for more time is in reality a delay\ntactic. Yet the same considerations would not attend a\nprivately retained counsel’s requests for time extensions.\nWe see no justification for treating defendants’ speedy­\ntrial claims differently based on whether their counsel is\nprivately retained or publicly assigned.\n                             B\n   In addition to making assigned counsel’s “failure . . . to\nmove [the] case forward” the touchstone of its speedy-trial\ninquiry, the Vermont Supreme Court further erred by\ntreating the period of each counsel’s representation dis­\ncretely. The factors identified in Barker “have no talis­\nmanic qualities; courts must still engage in a difficult and\nsensitive balancing process.” 407 U. S., at 533. Yet the\nVermont Supreme Court failed appropriately to take into\naccount Brillon’s role during the first year of delay in “the\nchain of events that started all this.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 46.\n   Brillon sought to dismiss Ammons on the eve of trial.\nHis strident, aggressive behavior with regard to Altieri,\nwhom he threatened, further impeded prompt trial and\nlikely made it more difficult for the Defender General’s\n——————\n1120–1121 (2008). The State sought to avoid its concession at oral\nargument before this Court, but in the alternative, noted that the\nperiod of Sleigh’s representation “is really inconsequential.” Tr. of Oral\nArg. 5–6. We agree that in light of the three-year delay caused mostly\nby Brillon, the attribution of Sleigh’s three-month representation does\nnot tip the balance for either side.\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

Just as a State’s\n“deliberate attempt to delay the trial in order to hamper\nthe defense should be weighted heavily against the\n[State],” Barker, 407 U. S., at 531, so too should a defen­\ndant’s deliberate attempt to disrupt proceedings be\nweighted heavily against the defendant. Absent Brillon’s\ndeliberate efforts to force the withdrawal of Ammons and\nAltieri, no speedy-trial issue would have arisen. The effect\nof these earlier events should have been factored into the\ncourt’s analysis of subsequent delay.9\n                               C\n  The general rule attributing to the defendant delay\ncaused by assigned counsel is not absolute.

But the Vermont\nSupreme Court made no determination, and nothing in\nthe record suggests, that institutional problems caused\nany part of the delay in Brillon’s case.\n  In sum, delays caused by defense counsel are properly\nattributed to the defendant, even where counsel is as­\nsigned. “[A]ny inquiry into a speedy trial claim necessi­\ntates a functional analysis of the right in the particular\ncontext of the case,” Barker, 407 U.

Wingo,\n407 U. S. 514 (1972).” Pet. for Cert. i, ¶1. The case, in my\nview, does not squarely present that question, for the\nVermont Supreme Court, when it found Michael Brillon’s\ntrial unconstitutionally delayed, did not count such delays\nagainst the State. The court’s opinion for the most part\nmakes that fact clear; at worst some passages are ambigu­\nous. Given these circumstances, I would dismiss the writ\nof certiorari as improvidently granted.\n                              I\n  The relevant time period consists of slightly less than\nthree years, stretching from July 2001, when Brillon was\nindicted, until mid-June 2004, when he was convicted and\nsentenced. In light of Brillon’s improper behavior, see\nante, at 3–4, the Vermont Supreme Court did not count\nmonths 1 through 12 (mid-July 2001 through mid-June\n2002) against the State. Noting the objection that Brillon\nhad sought to “intentionally sabotag[e] the criminal pro­\nceedings against him,” the Vermont Supreme Court was\nexplicit that this time period “do[es] not count . . . against\nthe [S]tate.” 955 A. 2d 1108, 1120 (2008).\n2                  VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   The Vermont Supreme Court did count months 13\nthrough 17 (mid-June 2002 through November 2002)\nagainst the State. It did so under circumstances where (1)\nBrillon’s counsel, Paul Donaldson, revealed that his con­\ntract with the defender general’s office had expired in\nJune 2002—shortly after (perhaps before!) he took over as\nBrillon’s counsel, App. 232–233, (2) he stated that this\ncase was “basically the beginning of [his] departure from\nthe contract,” ibid., and (3) he made no filings, missed\nseveral deadlines, did “little or nothing” to “move the case\nforward,” and made only one brief appearance at a status\nconference in mid-August. 955 A. 2d, at 1121. I believe it\nfairer to characterize this period, not as a period in which\n“assigned counsel” failed to move the case forward, ante, at\n1, but as a period in which Brillon, in practice, had no\nassigned counsel. And, given that the State conceded its\nresponsibility for delays caused by another defender who\nresigned for “contractual reasons,” see infra at 3, it is\nhardly unreasonable that the Vermont Supreme Court\ncounted this period of delay against the State.\n   The Vermont Supreme Court also counted months 18\nthrough 25 (the end of November 2002 through July 2003)\nagainst the State. It did so because the State conceded in\nits brief that this period of delay “cannot be attributed to\nthe defendant.” App. 78 (emphasis added). This conces­\nsion is not surprising in light of the fact that during much\nof this period, Brillon was represented by David Sleigh, a\ncontract attorney, who during the course of his represen­\ntation filed nothing on Brillon’s behalf except a single\nmotion seeking to extend discovery. The record reflects no\nother actions by Sleigh other than a letter sent to Brillon\ninforming him that “[a]s a result of modifications to our\nfirm’s contract with the Defender General, we will not be\nrepresenting you in your pending case.” Id., at 158.

But it is impossible to conclude from the opin­\nion whether it did so because it held the State responsible\nfor the defender’s failure to “move the case forward,” or for\nother reasons having nothing to do with counsel, namely\nthe judge’s unavailability, see id., at 138, or the fact that\n“the [case] files were incomplete” and “additional docu­\nments were needed from the State,” 955 A. 2d, at 1120–\n1121. Treating the opinion as charging the State on the\nbasis of the defender’s conduct is made more difficult by\nthe fact that Brillon did not argue below that Kathleen\nMoore, his defender during this period, caused any delays.\nAppellant’s Reply Brief in No. 2005–167 (Vt.), 2007 WL\n990004, *7.\n                              II\n  In sum, I can find no convincing reason to believe the\nVermont Supreme Court made the error of constitutional\nlaw that the majority attributes to it. Rather than read\nambiguities in its opinion against it, thereby assuming the\npresence of the error the Court finds, I would dismiss the\nwrit as improvidently granted. As a majority nonetheless\nwishes to decide the case, I would note that the Vermont\nSupreme Court has considerable authority to supervise\nthe appointment of public defenders. See Vt. Stat. Ann.,\nTit. 13, §§5204, 5272 (1998); see also Vt. Rule Crim. Proc.\n44 (2003). It consequently warrants leeway when it de­\ncides whether a particular failing is properly attributed to\nassigned counsel or instead to the failure of the defender\ngeneral’s office properly to assign counsel.
