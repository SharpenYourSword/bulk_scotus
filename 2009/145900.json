Argued October 6, 2008—Decided March 9, 2009\nSection 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act), 9 U. S. C. §4, au\n  thorizes a United States district court to entertain a petition to com\n  pel arbitration if the court would have jurisdiction, “save for [the ar\n  bitration] agreement,” over “a suit arising out of the controversy\n  between the parties.”\n     Discover Bank’s servicing affiliate filed a complaint in Maryland\n  state court to recover past-due charges from one of its credit card\n  holders, petitioner Vaden. Discover’s pleading presented a claim\n  arising solely under state law. Vaden answered and counterclaimed,\n  alleging that Discover’s finance charges, interest, and late fees vio\n  lated state law. Invoking an arbitration clause in its cardholder\n  agreement with Vaden, Discover then filed a §4 petition in Federal\n  District Court to compel arbitration of Vaden’s counterclaims. The\n  District Court ordered arbitration.\n     On Vaden’s initial appeal, the Fourth Circuit remanded the case\n  for the District Court to determine whether it had subject-matter ju\n  risdiction over Discover’s §4 petition pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §1331,\n  which gives federal courts jurisdiction over cases “arising under” fed\n  eral law. The Fourth Circuit instructed the District Court to conduct\n  this inquiry by “looking through” the §4 petition to the substantive\n  controversy between the parties. With Vaden conceding that her\n  state-law counterclaims were completely preempted by §27 of the\n  Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), the District Court expressly\n  held that it had federal-question jurisdiction and again ordered arbi\n  tration. The Fourth Circuit then affirmed. The Court of Appeals rec\n  ognized that, in Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Sys\n  tems, Inc., 535 U. S. 826, this Court held that federal-question\n  jurisdiction depends on the contents of a well-pleaded complaint, and\n2                     VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    may not be predicated on counterclaims. It concluded, however, that\n    the complete preemption doctrine is paramount and thus overrides\n    the well-pleaded complaint rule.\nHeld: A federal court may “look through” a §4 petition to determine\n whether it is predicated on a controversy that “arises under” federal\n law; in keeping with the well-pleaded complaint rule as amplified in\n Holmes Group, however, a federal court may not entertain a §4 peti\n tion based on the contents of a counterclaim when the whole contro\n versy between the parties does not qualify for federal-court adjudica\n tion. Pp. 6–21.\n    (a) Congress enacted the FAA “[t]o overcome judicial resistance to\n arbitration,” Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440,\n 443, and to declare “ ‘a national policy favoring arbitration’ of claims\n that parties contract to settle in that manner,” Preston v. Ferrer, 552\n U. S. ___, ___. To that end, §2 makes arbitration agreements in con\n tracts “involving commerce” “valid, irrevocable, and enforceable,”\n while §4 provides for federal district court enforcement of those\n agreements. The “body of federal substantive law” generated by\n elaboration of §2 is equally binding on state and federal courts.\n Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1, 12. However, the FAA “re\n quir[es] [for access to a federal forum] an independent jurisdictional\n basis” over the parties’ dispute. Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. v.\n Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. ___, ___. Under the well-pleaded complaint\n rule, a suit “arises under” federal law for 28 U. S. C. §1331 purposes\n “only when the plaintiff’s statement of his own cause of action shows\n that it is based upon [federal law].” Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v.\n Mottley, 211 U. S. 149, 152. Federal jurisdiction cannot be predicated\n on an actual or anticipated defense, ibid., or rest upon an actual or\n anticipated counterclaim, Holmes Group, 535 U. S. 826. A complaint\n purporting to rest on state law can be recharacterized as one “arising\n under” federal law if the law governing the complaint is exclusively\n federal, see Beneficial Nat. Bank v. Anderson, 539 U. S. 1, 8, but a\n state-law-based counterclaim, even if similarly susceptible to rechar\n acterization, remains nonremovable. Pp. 6–11.\n    (b) FAA §4’s text drives the conclusion that a federal court should\n determine its jurisdiction by “looking through” a §4 petition to the\n parties’ underlying substantive controversy. The phrase “save for\n [the arbitration] agreement” indicates that the district court should\n assume the absence of the agreement and determine whether it\n “would have jurisdiction under title 28” over “the controversy be\n tween the parties,” which is most straightforwardly read to mean the\n “underlying dispute” between the parties. See Moses H. Cone Memo\n rial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 25, n. 32. Vaden’s\n argument that the relevant “controversy” is simply and only the par\n                    Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nties’ discrete dispute over the arbitrability of their claims is difficult\nto square with §4’s language. If courts are to determine whether they\nwould have jurisdiction “save for [the arbitration] agreement,” how\ncan a dispute over an arbitration agreement’s existence or applicabil\nity be the controversy that counts? The Court is unpersuaded that\nthe “save for” clause means only that the “antiquated and arcane”\nouster notion no longer holds sway. To the extent that the ancient\n“ouster” doctrine continued to impede specific enforcement of arbitra\ntion agreements, FAA §2, the Act’s “centerpiece provision,” Mitsubi\nshi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 625,\ndirectly attended to the problem by commanding that an arbitration\nagreement is enforceable just as any other contract. Vaden’s ap\nproach also has curious practical consequences. It would permit a\nfederal court to entertain a §4 petition only when a federal-question\nsuit is already before the court, when the parties satisfy the require\nments for diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction, or when the dispute\nover arbitrability involves a maritime contract, yet would not ac\ncommodate a §4 petitioner who could file a federal-question suit in,\nor remove such a suit to, federal court, but has not done so. In con\ntrast, the “look through” approach permits a §4 petitioner to ask a\nfederal court to compel arbitration without first taking the formal\nstep of initiating or removing a federal-question suit. Pp. 11–15.\n   (c) Having determined that a district court should look through a\n§4 petition, this Court considers whether the court “would have [fed\neral-question] jurisdiction” over “a suit arising out of the controversy”\nbetween Discover and Vaden. Because §4 does not enlarge federal\ncourt jurisdiction, a party seeking to compel arbitration may gain\nsuch a court’s assistance only if, “save for” the agreement, the entire,\nactual “controversy between the parties,” as they have framed it,\ncould be litigated in federal court. Here, the actual controversy is not\namenable to federal-court adjudication. The “controversy between\nthe parties” arose from Vaden’s “alleged debt,” a claim that plainly\ndid not “arise under” federal law; nor did it qualify under any other\nhead of federal-court jurisdiction. The Fourth Circuit misappre\nhended Holmes Group when it concluded that jurisdiction was proper\nbecause Vaden’s state-law counterclaims were completely preempted.\nUnder the well-pleaded complaint rule, a completely preempted coun\nterclaim remains a counterclaim, and thus does not provide a key ca\npable of opening a federal court’s door. Vaden’s responsive counter\nclaims challenging the legality of Discover’s charges are merely an\naspect of the whole controversy Discover and Vaden brought to state\ncourt. Whether one might hypothesize a federal-question suit involv\ning that subsidiary disagreement is beside the point. The relevant\nquestion is whether the whole controversy is one over which the fed\n4                      VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    eral courts would have jurisdiction. Section 4 does not give parties li\n    cense to recharacterize an existing controversy, or manufacture a\n    new controversy, in order to obtain a federal court’s aid in compelling\n    arbitration. It is hardly fortuitous that the controversy in this case\n    took the shape it did. Seeking to collect a debt, Discover filed an en\n    tirely state-law-grounded complaint in state court, and Vaden chose\n    to file responsive counterclaims. Section 4 does not invite federal\n    courts to dream up counterfactuals when actual litigation has defined\n    the parties’ controversy. Allowing parties to commandeer a federal\n    court to slice off responsive pleadings for discrete arbitration while\n    leaving the remainder of the parties’ controversy pending in state\n    court makes scant sense. Furthermore, the presence of a threshold\n    question whether a counterclaim alleged to be based on state law is\n    totally preempted by federal law may complicate the §4 inquiry. Al\n    though FAA §4 does not empower a federal court to order arbitration\n    here, Discover is not left without recourse. Because the FAA obliges\n    both state and federal courts to honor and enforce arbitration agree\n    ments, Discover may petition Maryland’s courts for appropriate aid\n    in enforcing the arbitration clause of its contracts with Maryland\n    credit cardholders.

S. C. §4,\nauthorizes a United States district court to entertain a\npetition to compel arbitration if the court would have\njurisdiction, “save for [the arbitration] agreement,” over “a\nsuit arising out of the controversy between the parties.”\nWe consider in this opinion two questions concerning a\ndistrict court’s subject-matter jurisdiction over a §4 peti\ntion: Should a district court, if asked to compel arbitration\npursuant to §4, “look through” the petition and grant the\nrequested relief if the court would have federal-question\njurisdiction over the underlying controversy? And if the\nanswer to that question is yes, may a district court exer\ncise jurisdiction over a §4 petition when the petitioner’s\ncomplaint rests on state law but an actual or potential\ncounterclaim rests on federal law?\n   The litigation giving rise to these questions began when\nDiscover Bank’s servicing affiliate filed a complaint in\nMaryland state court. Presenting a claim arising solely\nunder state law, Discover sought to recover past-due\ncharges from one of its credit cardholders, Betty Vaden.\n2                VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nVaden answered and counterclaimed, alleging that Dis\ncover’s finance charges, interest, and late fees violated\nstate law. Invoking an arbitration clause in its cardholder\nagreement with Vaden, Discover then filed a §4 petition in\nthe United States District Court for the District of Mary\nland to compel arbitration of Vaden’s counterclaims. The\nDistrict Court had subject-matter jurisdiction over its\npetition, Discover maintained, because Vaden’s state-law\ncounterclaims were completely preempted by federal\nbanking law. The District Court agreed and ordered\narbitration. Reasoning that a federal court has jurisdic\ntion over a §4 petition if the parties’ underlying dispute\npresents a federal question, the Fourth Circuit eventually\naffirmed.\n   We agree with the Fourth Circuit in part. A federal\ncourt may “look through” a §4 petition and order arbitra\ntion if, “save for [the arbitration] agreement,” the court\nwould have jurisdiction over “the [substantive] controversy\nbetween the parties.” We hold, however, that the Court of\nAppeals misidentified the dimensions of “the controversy\nbetween the parties.” Focusing on only a slice of the par\nties’ entire controversy, the court seized on Vaden’s coun\nterclaims, held them completely preempted, and on that\nbasis affirmed the District Court’s order compelling arbi\ntration.    Lost from sight was the triggering plea—\nDiscover’s claim for the balance due on Vaden’s account.\nGiven that entirely state-based plea and the established\nrule that federal-court jurisdiction cannot be invoked on\nthe basis of a defense or counterclaim, the whole “contro\nversy between the parties” does not qualify for federal\ncourt adjudication. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of\nAppeals’ judgment.\n                          I\n  This case originated as a garden-variety, state-law\nbased contract action: Discover sued its cardholder,\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nVaden, in a Maryland state court to recover arrearages\namounting to $10,610.74, plus interest and counsel fees.1\nVaden’s answer asserted usury as an affirmative defense.\nVaden also filed several counterclaims, styled as class\nactions. Like Discover’s complaint, Vaden’s pleadings\ninvoked only state law: Vaden asserted that Discover’s\ndemands for finance charges, interest, and late fees vio\nlated Maryland’s credit laws. See Md. Com. Law Code\nAnn. §§12–506, 12–506.2 (Lexis 2005). Neither party\ninvoked—by notice to the other or petition to the state\ncourt—the clause in the credit card agreement providing\nfor arbitration of “any claim or dispute between [Discover\nand Vaden],” App. 44 (capitalization and bold typeface\nomitted).2\n  Faced with Vaden’s counterclaims, Discover sought\nfederal-court aid. It petitioned the United States District\nCourt for the District of Maryland for an order, pursuant\nto §4 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act), 9\nU. S. C. §4, compelling arbitration of Vaden’s counter\nclaims.3 Although those counterclaims were framed under\nstate law, Discover urged that they were governed entirely\nby federal law, specifically, §27(a) of the Federal Deposit\n——————\n   1 Discover apparently had no access to a federal forum for its suit\n\nagainst Vaden on the basis of diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction.\nUnder that head of federal-court jurisdiction, the amount in contro\nversy must “excee[d] . . . $75,000.” 28 U. S. C. §1332(a).\n   2 Vaden’s preference for court adjudication is unsurprising. The arbi\n\ntration clause, framed by Discover, prohibited presentation of “any\nclaims as a representative or member of a class.” App. 45 (capitaliza\ntion omitted).\n   3 Section 4 reads, in relevant part:\n\n   “A party aggrieved by the alleged failure, neglect, or refusal of an\nother to arbitrate under a written agreement for arbitration may\npetition any United States district court which, save for such agree\nment, would have jurisdiction under title 28, in a civil action or in\nadmiralty of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the controversy\nbetween the parties, for an order directing that such arbitration pro\nceed in the manner provided for in such agreement.” 9 U. S. C. §4.\n4                VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nInsurance Act (FDIA), 12 U. S. C. §1831d(a). Section 27(a)\nprescribes the interest rates state-chartered, federally\ninsured banks like Discover can charge, “notwithstanding\nany State constitution or statute which is hereby pre\nempted.” This provision, Discover maintained, was com\npletely preemptive, i.e., it superseded otherwise applicable\nMaryland law, and placed Vaden’s counterclaims under\nthe exclusive governance of the FDIA. On that basis,\nDiscover asserted, the District Court had authority to\nentertain the §4 petition pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §1331,\nwhich gives federal courts jurisdiction over cases “arising\nunder” federal law.\n   The District Court granted Discover’s petition, ordered\narbitration, and stayed Vaden’s prosecution of her coun\nterclaims in state court pending the outcome of arbitra\ntion. App. to Pet. for Cert. 89a–90a. On Vaden’s initial\nappeal, the Fourth Circuit inquired whether the District\nCourt had federal-question jurisdiction over Discover’s §4\npetition. To make that determination, the Court of Ap\npeals instructed, the District Court should “look through”\nthe §4 petition to the substantive controversy between the\nparties. 396 F. 3d 366, 369, 373 (2005). The appellate\ncourt then remanded the case for an express determina\ntion whether that controversy presented “a properly in\nvoked federal question.” Id., at 373.\n   On remand, Vaden “concede[d] that the FDIA com\npletely preempts any state claims against a federally\ninsured bank.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 636 (Md. 2006).\nAccepting this concession, the District Court expressly\nheld that it had federal-question jurisdiction over Dis\ncover’s §4 petition and again ordered arbitration. Id., at\n634–636, 639. In this second round, the Fourth Circuit\naffirmed, dividing 2 to 1. 489 F. 3d 594 (2007).\n   Recognizing that “a party may not create jurisdiction by\nconcession,” id., at 604, n. 10, the Fourth Circuit majority\nconducted its own analysis of FDIA §27(a), ultimately\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

Vornado Air\nCirculation Systems, Inc., 535 U. S. 826 (2002), the major\nity recognized, held that federal-question jurisdiction\ndepends on the contents of a well-pleaded complaint, and\nmay not be predicated on counterclaims. 489 F. 3d, at\n600, n. 4. Nevertheless, the majority concluded, the com\nplete preemption doctrine is paramount, “overrid[ing] such\nfundamental cornerstones of federal subject-matter juris\ndiction as the well-pleaded complaint rule.” Ibid. (quoting\n14B C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice\nand Procedure §3722.1, p. 511 (3d ed. 1998) (hereinafter\nWright & Miller)).5\n   The dissenting judge considered Holmes Group disposi\ntive. As §27(a) of the FDIA formed no part of Discover’s\ncomplaint, but came into the case only as a result of\nVaden’s responsive pleadings, the dissent reasoned,\n“[t]here was no ‘properly invoked federal question’ in the\nunderlying state case.” 489 F. 3d, at 610.\n   We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2008), in view of\nthe conflict among lower federal courts on whether district\ncourts, petitioned to order arbitration pursuant to §4 of\nthe FAA, may “look through” the petition and examine the\nparties’ underlying dispute to determine whether federal\nquestion jurisdiction exists over the §4 petition. Compare\nWisconsin v. Ho-Chunk Nation, 463 F. 3d 655, 659 (CA7\n——————\n  4 Our disposition of this case makes it unnecessary to take up the\n\nquestion of §27(a)’s preemptive force generally or in the particular\ncontext of Discover’s finance charges. We therefore express no opinion\non those issues. Cf. Beneficial Nat. Bank v. Anderson, 539 U. S. 1, 9–10\n(2003) (holding that the National Bank Act, 12 U. S. C. §§85, 86,\ncompletely preempts state-law usury claims against national banks).\n  5 But see 489 F. 3d 594, 612 (CA4 2007) (dissenting opinion) (observ\n\ning that the passage from Wright & Miller referenced by the majority\n“makes clear that the doctrine of complete preemption is exclusively\nfocused on claims in a plaintiff’s complaint”).\n6                  VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n2006) (in determining jurisdiction over a §4 petition, the\ncourt may not “look through” the petition and focus on the\nunderlying dispute); Smith Barney, Inc. v. Sarver, 108\nF. 3d 92, 94 (CA6 1997) (same); Westmoreland Capital\nCorp. v. Findlay, 100 F. 3d 263, 267–269 (CA2 1996)\n(same); and Prudential-Bache Securities, Inc. v.

In support of that complaint, Discover invoked\nno federal law. When Vaden answered and counter\nclaimed, however, Discover asserted that federal law,\nspecifically §27(a) of the FDIA, displaced the state laws on\nwhich Vaden relied. What counts as the underlying dis\npute in a case so postured? May Discover invoke §4, not\non the basis of its own complaint, which had no federal\nelement, but on the basis of counterclaims asserted by\nVaden? To answer these questions, we first review rele\nvant provisions of the FAA, 9 U. S. C. §1 et seq., and con\ntrolling tenets of federal jurisdiction.\n                             II\n    In 1925, Congress enacted the FAA “[t]o overcome judi\n——————\n  6 In Community State Bank v.

To that end,\n§2 provides that arbitration agreements in contracts “in\nvolving commerce” are “valid, irrevocable, and enforce\nable.” 9 U. S. C. §2.7 Section 4—the section at issue\nhere—provides for United States district court enforce\nment of arbitration agreements. Petitions to compel arbi\ntration, §4 states, may be brought before “any United\nStates district court which, save for such agreement,\nwould have jurisdiction under title 28 . . . of the subject\nmatter of a suit arising out of the controversy between the\nparties.” See supra, at 3, n. 3.8\n   The “body of federal substantive law” generated by\nelaboration of FAA §2 is equally binding on state and\n\n——————\n  7 Section2 reads, in full:\n  “A written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evi\ndencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a\ncontroversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction, or the\nrefusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in\nwriting to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of\nsuch a contract, transaction, or refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable, and\nenforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the\nrevocation of any contract.” 9 U.

It reads:\n  “If any suit or proceeding be brought in any of the courts of the\nUnited States upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agree\nment in writing for such arbitration, the court in which such suit is\npending, upon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit or\nproceeding is referable to arbitration under such an agreement, shall on\napplication of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such\narbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agree\nment, providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceed\ning with such arbitration.” 9 U.

See Southland, 465 U. S.,\nat 15; Moses H. Cone, 460 U. S., at 25, and n. 32.\n  The independent jurisdictional basis Discover relies\nupon in this case is 28 U. S. C. §1331, which vests in\nfederal district courts jurisdiction over “all civil actions\narising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the\nUnited States.” Under the longstanding well-pleaded\ncomplaint rule, however, a suit “arises under” federal law\n\n——————\n  9 Chapter 2 of the FAA, not implicated here, does expressly grant\n\nfederal courts jurisdiction to hear actions seeking to enforce an agree\nment or award falling under the Convention on the Recognition and\nEnforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. See 9 U. S. C. §203 (“An\naction or proceeding falling under the Convention shall be deemed to\narise under the laws and treaties of the United States. The district\ncourts of the United States . . . shall have original jurisdiction over such\nan action or proceeding . . . .”). FAA §205 goes further and overrides\nthe well-pleaded complaint rule pro tanto. 9 U. S. C. §205 (“The proce\ndure for removal of causes otherwise provided by law shall apply,\nexcept that the ground for removal provided in this section need not\nappear on the face of the complaint but may be shown in the petition\nfor removal.”).

Co. v. Mottley, 211 U. S. 149, 152\n(1908). Federal jurisdiction cannot be predicated on an\nactual or anticipated defense: “It is not enough that the\nplaintiff alleges some anticipated defense to his cause of\naction and asserts that the defense is invalidated by some\nprovision of [federal law].” Ibid.\n   Nor can federal jurisdiction rest upon an actual or an\nticipated counterclaim. We so ruled, emphatically, in\nHolmes Group, 535 U. S. 826. Without dissent, the Court\nheld in Holmes Group that a federal counterclaim, even\nwhen compulsory, does not establish “arising under” juris\ndiction.10 Adhering assiduously to the well-pleaded com\nplaint rule, the Court observed, inter alia, that it would\nundermine the clarity and simplicity of that rule if federal\ncourts were obliged to consider the contents not only of the\ncomplaint but also of responsive pleadings in determining\nwhether a case “arises under” federal law. Id., at 832. See\n——————\n  10 Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc., 535\n\nU. S. 826 (2002), involved 28 U. S. C. §1295(a)(1), which vests in the\nFederal Circuit exclusive jurisdiction over “an appeal from a final\ndecision of a district court . . . if the jurisdiction of that court was based,\nin whole or in part, on [28 U. S. C. §]1338.” Section 1338(a), in turn,\nconfers on district courts “[exclusive] original jurisdiction of any civil\naction arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents.” The\nplaintiff’s complaint in Holmes Group presented a federal claim, but not\none relating to patents; the defendant counterclaimed for patent\ninfringement. The Court ruled that the case did not “aris[e] under” the\npatent laws by virtue of the patent counterclaim, and therefore held\nthat the Federal Circuit lacked appellate jurisdiction under §1295(a)(1).\nSee 535 U. S., at 830–832.\n  In reaching its decision in Holmes Group, the Court first attributed to\nthe words “arising under” in §1338(a) the same meaning those words\nhave in §1331. See id., at 829–830. It then reasoned that a counter\nclaim asserted in a responsive pleading cannot provide the basis for\n“arising under” jurisdiction consistently with the well-pleaded com\nplaint rule. See id., at 830–832.\n10                   VADEN v.

Under our precedent construing §1331, as just\nexplained, counterclaims, even if they rely exclusively on\nfederal substantive law, do not qualify a case for federal\ncourt cognizance.\n                             III\n   Attending to the language of the FAA and the above\ndescribed jurisdictional tenets, we approve the “look\nthrough” approach to this extent: A federal court may\n“look through” a §4 petition to determine whether it is\npredicated on an action that “arises under” federal law; in\nkeeping with the well-pleaded complaint rule as amplified\nin Holmes Group, however, a federal court may not enter\ntain a §4 petition based on the contents, actual or hypo\nthetical, of a counterclaim.\n                              A\n  The text of §4 drives our conclusion that a federal court\nshould determine its jurisdiction by “looking through” a §4\npetition to the parties’ underlying substantive controversy.\nWe reiterate §4’s relevant instruction: When one party\nseeks arbitration pursuant to a written agreement and the\nother resists, the proponent of arbitration may petition for\nan order compelling arbitration in\n    “any United States district court which, save for [the\n    arbitration] agreement, would have jurisdiction under\n    title 28, in a civil action or in admiralty of the subject\n    matter of a suit arising out of the controversy between\n    the parties.” 9 U. S. C. §4.\nThe phrase “save for [the arbitration] agreement” indi\ncates that the district court should assume the absence of\nthe arbitration agreement and determine whether it\n“would have jurisdiction under title 28” without it. See\n396 F. 3d, at 369, 372 (case below). Jurisdiction over\nwhat? The text of §4 refers us to “the controversy between\nthe parties.” That phrase, the Fourth Circuit said, and we\n12                   VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nagree, is most straightforwardly read to mean the “sub\nstantive conflict between the parties.” Id., at 370. See\nalso Moses H. Cone, 460 U. S., at 25, n. 32 (noting in dicta\nthat, to entertain a §4 petition, a federal court must have\njurisdiction over the “underlying dispute”).13\n   The majority of Courts of Appeals to address the ques\ntion, we acknowledge, have rejected the “look through”\napproach entirely, as Vaden asks us to do here. See supra,\nat 5–6. The relevant “controversy between the parties,”\nVaden insists, is simply and only the parties’ discrete\ndispute over the arbitrability of their claims. She relies,\nquite reasonably, on the fact that a §4 petition to compel\narbitration seeks no adjudication on the merits of the\nunderlying controversy. Indeed, its very purpose is to\nhave an arbitrator, rather than a court, resolve the merits.\nA §4 petition, Vaden observes, is essentially a plea for\nspecific performance of an agreement to arbitrate, and it\nthus presents principally contractual questions: Did the\nparties validly agree to arbitrate? What issues does their\nagreement encompass? Has one party dishonored the\nagreement?\n   Vaden’s argument, though reasonable, is difficult to\nsquare with the statutory language. Section 4 directs\ncourts to determine whether they would have jurisdiction\n“save for [the arbitration] agreement.” How, then, can a\ndispute over the existence or applicability of an arbitration\nagreement be the controversy that counts?\n——————\n   13 The parties’ underlying dispute may or may not be the subject of\n\npending litigation. This explains §4’s use of the conditional “would”\nand the indefinite “a suit.” A party often files a §4 petition to compel\narbitration precisely because it does not want to bring suit and litigate\nin court. Sometimes, however, a §4 petition is filed after litigation has\ncommenced. The party seeking to compel arbitration in such cases is\ntypically the defendant, who claims to be aggrieved by the plaintiff’s\nattempt to litigate rather than arbitrate. This case involves the rela\ntively unusual situation in which the party that initiated litigation of\nthe underlying dispute is also the party seeking to compel arbitration.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The “save for” clause, courts espousing the view em\nbraced by Vaden respond, means only that the “antiquated\nand arcane” ouster notion no longer holds sway. Drexel\nBurnham Lambert, Inc. v. Valenzuela Bock, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1422098\"><a href=\"/opinion/1422098/drexel-burnham-lambert-inc-v-valenzuela-bock/\"><span class=\"volume\">696</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">957</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 961 (SDNY 1988). Adherents to this “ouster” expla\nnation of §4’s language recall that courts traditionally\nviewed arbitration clauses as unworthy attempts to “oust”\nthem of jurisdiction; accordingly, to guard against en\ncroachment on their domain, they refused to order specific\nenforcement of agreements to arbitrate. See H. R. Rep.\nNo. 96, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 1–2 (1924) (discussed in\nDean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U. S. 213, 219–220,\nand n. 6 (1985)). The “save for” clause, as comprehended\nby proponents of the “ouster” explanation, was designed to\nensure that courts would no longer consider themselves\nousted of jurisdiction and would therefore specifically\nenforce arbitration agreements. See, e.g., Westmoreland,\n100 F. 3d, at 267–268, and n. 6 (adopting the “ouster”\ninterpretation advanced in Drexel Burnham Lambert, 696\nF. Supp., at 961–963); Strong, 485 F. 3d, at 631 (Marcus,\nJ., specially concurring) (reading §4’s “save for” clause “as\ninstructing the court to ‘set aside’ not the arbitration\nagreement . . . , but merely the previous judicial hostility\nto arbitration agreements”).\n   We are not persuaded that the “ouster” explanation of\n§4’s “save for” clause carries the day. To the extent that\nthe ancient “ouster” doctrine continued to impede specific\nenforcement of arbitration agreements, §2 of the FAA, the\nAct’s “centerpiece provision,” Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v.\nSoler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 625 (1985),\ndirectly attended to the problem. Covered agreements to\narbitrate, §2 declares, are “valid, irrevocable, and enforce\nable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity\nfor the revocation of any contract.” Having commanded\nthat an arbitration agreement is enforceable just as any\nother contract, Congress had no cause to repeat the point.\n14                   VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nSee 1 I. MacNeil, R. Speidel, & T. Stipanowich, Federal\nArbitration Law §9.2.3.3, p. 9:18 (1995) (hereinafter\nMacNeil) (“Th[e] effort to connect the ‘save for’ language to\nthe ancient problem of ‘ouster of jurisdiction’ is imagina\ntive, but utterly unfounded and historically inaccurate.”\n(footnote omitted)).14\n   In addition to its textual implausibility, the approach\nVaden advocates has curious practical consequences. It\nwould permit a federal court to entertain a §4 petition only\nwhen a federal-question suit is already before the court,\nwhen the parties satisfy the requirements for diversity-of\ncitizenship jurisdiction, or when the dispute over arbitra\nbility involves a maritime contract. See, e.g., Westmore\nland, 100 F. 3d, at 268–269; 1 MacNeil §9.2.3.1, pp. 9:12–\n9:13 (when a federal-question suit has been filed in or\nremoved to federal court, the court “may order arbitration\nunder FAA §4”).15 Vaden’s approach would not accommo\ndate a §4 petitioner who could file a federal-question suit\nin (or remove such a suit to) federal court, but who has not\ndone so. In contrast, when the parties’ underlying dispute\narises under federal law, the “look through” approach\npermits a §4 petitioner to ask a federal court to compel\narbitration without first taking the formal step of initiat\ning or removing a federal-question suit—that is, without\nseeking federal adjudication of the very questions it wants\nto arbitrate rather than litigate. See 1 id., §9.2.3.3, p. 9:21\n——————\n  14 Because   “the ouster problem was just as great under state law as it\nwas under federal,” the absence of “save for” language in contempora\nneous state arbitration acts bolsters our conclusion that §4 was not\ndevised to dislodge the common-law ouster doctrine. 1 I. MacNeil, R.\nSpeidel, & T. Stipanowich, Federal Arbitration Law §9.2.3.3, p. 9:18\n(1995). See also 396 F. 3d 366, 369–370, n. 2 (CA4 2005) (case below).\n   15 Specific jurisdiction-granting provisions may also authorize a fed\n\neral court to entertain a petition to compel arbitration. See, e.g., 9\nU. S. C. §§203, 205 (providing for federal-court jurisdiction over arbitra\ntion agreements covered by the Convention on the Recognition and\nEnforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards).\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(explaining that the approach Vaden advocates “creates a\ntotally artificial distinction” based on whether a dispute is\nsubject to pending federal litigation).\n                              B\n   Having determined that a district court should “look\nthrough” a §4 petition, we now consider whether the court\n“would have [federal-question] jurisdiction” over “a suit\narising out of the controversy” between Discover and\nVaden. 9 U. S. C. §4. As explained above, §4 of the FAA\ndoes not enlarge federal-court jurisdiction; rather, it con\nfines federal courts to the jurisdiction they would have\n“save for [the arbitration] agreement.” See supra, at 7–8.\nMindful of that limitation, we read §4 to convey that a\nparty seeking to compel arbitration may gain a federal\ncourt’s assistance only if, “save for” the agreement, the\nentire, actual “controversy between the parties,” as they\nhave framed it, could be litigated in federal court. We\nconclude that the parties’ actual controversy, here precipi\ntated by Discover’s state-court suit for the balance due on\nVaden’s account, is not amenable to federal-court adjudi\ncation. Consequently, the §4 petition Discover filed in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Maryland\nmust be dismissed.\n   As the Fourth Circuit initially stated, the “controversy\nbetween the parties” arose from the “alleged debt” Vaden\nowed to Discover. 396 F. 3d, at 370. Discover’s complaint\nin Maryland state court plainly did not “arise under”\nfederal law, nor did it qualify under any other head of\nfederal-court jurisdiction. See supra, at 3, and n. 1.\n   In holding that Discover properly invoked federal-court\njurisdiction, the Fourth Circuit looked beyond Discover’s\ncomplaint and homed in on Vaden’s state-law-based de\nfense and counterclaims. Those responsive pleadings,\nDiscover alleged, and the Fourth Circuit determined, were\ncompletely preempted by the FDIA. See supra, at 3–4.\n16               VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe Fourth Circuit, however, misapprehended our deci\nsion in Holmes Group. Under the well-pleaded complaint\nrule, a completely preempted counterclaim remains a\ncounterclaim and thus does not provide a key capable of\nopening a federal court’s door. See supra, at 8–11. See\nalso Taylor v. Anderson, 234 U. S. 74, 75–76 (1914)\n(“[W]hether a case is one arising under [federal law] . . .\nmust be determined from what necessarily appears in the\nplaintiff’s statement of his own claim . . . , unaided by\nanything alleged in anticipation o[r] avoidance of defenses\nwhich it is thought the defendant may interpose.”).\n   Neither Discover nor THE CHIEF JUSTICE, concurring in\npart and dissenting in part (hereinafter dissent), defends\nthe Fourth Circuit’s reasoning. Instead, the dissent in\nsists that a federal court “would have” jurisdiction over\n“the controversy Discover seeks to arbitrate”—namely,\n“whether ‘Discover Bank charged illegal finance charges,\ninterest and late fees.’ ” Post, at 1 (quoting App. 30). The\ndissent hypothesizes two federal suits that might arise\nfrom this purported controversy: “an action by Vaden\nasserting that the charges violate the FDIA, or one by\nDiscover seeking a declaratory judgment that they do not.”\nPost, at 2.\n   There is a fundamental flaw in the dissent’s analysis: In\nlieu of focusing on the whole controversy as framed by the\nparties, the dissent hypothesizes discrete controversies of\nits own design. As the parties’ state-court filings reflect,\nthe originating controversy here concerns Vaden’s alleged\ndebt to Discover. Vaden’s responsive counterclaims chal\nlenging the legality of Discover’s charges are a discrete\naspect of the whole controversy Discover and Vaden\nbrought to state court. Whether one might imagine a\nfederal-question suit involving the parties’ disagreement\nover Discover’s charges is beside the point. The relevant\nquestion is whether the whole controversy between the\nparties—not just a piece broken off from that contro\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nversy—is one over which the federal courts would have\njurisdiction.\n   The dissent would have us treat a §4 petitioner’s state\nment of the issues to be arbitrated as the relevant contro\nversy even when that statement does not convey the full\nflavor of the parties’ entire dispute. Artful dodges by a §4\npetitioner should not divert us from recognizing the actual\ndimensions of that controversy. The text of §4 instructs\nfederal courts to determine whether they would have\njurisdiction over “a suit arising out of the controversy\nbetween the parties”; it does not give §4 petitioners license\nto recharacterize an existing controversy, or manufacture\na new controversy, in an effort to obtain a federal court’s\naid in compelling arbitration.16\n   Viewed contextually and straightforwardly, it is hardly\n“fortuit[ous]” that the controversy in this case took the\nshape it did. Cf. post, at 2. Seeking to collect a debt,\nDiscover filed an entirely state-law-grounded complaint in\nstate court, and Vaden chose to file responsive counter\nclaims. Perhaps events could have unfolded differently,\n——————\n  16 Noting   that the FAA sometimes uses “controversy” to refer to the\ndispute to be arbitrated, the dissent insists that it must have the same\nmeaning in §4. Cf. post, at 2–3. But §4 does not ask a district court to\ndetermine whether it would have jurisdiction over “the controversy the\n§4 petitioner seeks to arbitrate”; it asks whether the court would have\njurisdiction over “the controversy between the parties.” Here, the issue\nDiscover seeks to arbitrate is undeniably only a fraction of the contro\nversy between the parties. We decline to rewrite the statute to ignore\nthis reality.\n   Moreover, our reading of §4 fully accords with the statute’s subjunc\ntive construction (“would have jurisdiction”) and its reference to “a\nsuit.” Cf. post, at 5. Section 4, we recognize, enables a party to seek an\norder compelling arbitration even when the parties’ controversy is not\nthe subject of pending litigation. See supra, at 12, n. 13, 14–15.\nWhether or not the controversy between the parties is embodied in an\nexisting suit, the relevant question remains the same: Would a federal\ncourt have jurisdiction over an action arising out of that full-bodied\ncontroversy?\n18                   VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbut §4 does not invite federal courts to dream up counter\nfactuals when actual litigation has defined the parties’\ncontroversy.17\n   As the dissent would have it, parties could commandeer\na federal court to slice off responsive pleadings for arbitra\ntion while leaving the remainder of the parties’ contro\nversy pending in state court. That seems a bizarre way to\nproceed. In this case, Vaden’s counterclaims would be\nsent to arbitration while the complaint to which they are\naddressed—Discover’s state-law-grounded debt-collection\naction—would remain pending in a Maryland court.\nWhen the controversy between the parties is not one over\nwhich a federal court would have jurisdiction, it makes\nscant sense to allow one of the parties to enlist a federal\ncourt to disturb the state-court proceedings by carving out\nissues for separate resolution.18\n——————\n   17Our approach, the dissent asserts, would produce “inconsistent\n\nresults” based “upon the happenstance of how state-court litigation has\nunfolded.” Post, at 5, 6. Of course, a party’s ability to gain adjudication\nof a federal question in federal court often depends on how that ques\ntion happens to have been presented, and the dissent’s argument is\nlittle more than a veiled criticism of Holmes Group and the well\npleaded complaint rule. When a litigant files a state-law claim in state\ncourt, and her opponent parries with a federal counterclaim, the action\nis not removable to federal court, even though it would have been\nremovable had the order of filings been reversed. See Holmes Group,\n535 U. S., at 831–832.\n      True, the outcome in this case may well have been different had\nVaden initiated an FDIA claim about the legality of Discover’s charges.\nBecause that controversy likely would have been amenable to adjudica\ntion in a federal forum, Discover could have asked a federal court to\nsend the parties to arbitration. But that is not what occurred here.\nVaden did not invoke the FDIA. Indeed, she framed her counterclaims\nunder state law and clearly preferred the Maryland forum. The dis\nsent’s hypothesizing about the case that might have been brought does\nnot provide a basis for federal-court jurisdiction.\n   18 The dissent observes, post, at 4, that our rule might enable a party\n\nto request a federal court’s aid in compelling arbitration of a state-law\ncounterclaim that might otherwise be adjudicated in state court.

This case is illustrative. The dissent\nrelates that Vaden eventually conceded that FDIA §27(a),\nnot Maryland law, governs the charges and fees Discover\nmay impose. Post, at 1–2. But because the issue is juris\ndictional, Vaden’s concession is not determinative. See\nsupra, at 4–5, and n. 4. The dissent simply glides by the\npreemption issue, devoting no attention to it, although\nthis Court has not yet resolved the matter.\n  In sum, §4 of the FAA instructs district courts asked to\ncompel arbitration to inquire whether the court would\nhave jurisdiction, “save for [the arbitration] agreement,”\nover “a suit arising out of the controversy between the\nparties.” We read that prescription in light of the well\npleaded complaint rule and the corollary rule that federal\njurisdiction cannot be invoked on the basis of a defense or\ncounterclaim. Parties may not circumvent those rules by\nasking a federal court to order arbitration of the portion of\na controversy that implicates federal law when the court\nwould not have federal-question jurisdiction over the\ncontroversy as a whole. It does not suffice to show that a\nfederal question lurks somewhere inside the parties’ con\ntroversy, or that a defense or counterclaim would arise\nunder federal law. Because the controversy between\nDiscover and Vaden, properly perceived, is not one qualify\ning for federal-court adjudication, §4 of the FAA does not\nempower a federal court to order arbitration of that con\ntroversy, in whole or in part.19\n——————\na federal court would have jurisdiction over the parties’ whole contro\nversy, we see nothing anomalous about the court’s ordering arbitration\nof a state-law claim constituting part of that controversy. Federal\ncourts routinely exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law\nclaims. See 28 U. S. C. §1367.\n  19 This Court’s declaratory judgment jurisprudence in no way under\n20                   VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Discover, we note, is not left without recourse. Under\nthe FAA, state courts as well as federal courts are obliged\nto honor and enforce agreements to arbitrate. Southland,\n465 U. S., at 12; Moses H. Cone, 460 U. S., at 25, 26, n. 34.\nSee also supra, at 7–8. Discover may therefore petition a\nMaryland court for aid in enforcing the arbitration clause\nof its contracts with Maryland cardholders.\n   True, Maryland’s high court has held that §§3 and 4 of\nthe FAA prescribe federal-court procedures and, therefore,\ndo not bind the state courts.20 But Discover scarcely lacks\nan available state remedy. Section 2 of the FAA, which\ndoes bind the state courts, renders agreements to arbitrate\n“valid, irrevocable, and enforceable.” This provision “car\nries with it duties [to credit and enforce arbitration\nagreements] indistinguishable from those imposed on\nfederal courts by FAA §§3 and 4.” 1 MacNeil §10.8.1,\np. 10:77. Notably, Maryland, like many other States,\nprovides a statutory remedy nearly identical to §4. See\nMd. Cts. & Jud. Proc. Code Ann. §3–207 (Lexis 2006) (“If a\nparty to an arbitration agreement . . . refuses to arbitrate,\nthe other party may file a petition with a court to order\n——————\ncuts our analysis. Cf. post, at 2, 7. Discover, the dissent implies, could\nhave brought suit in federal court seeking a declaration that its charges\nconform to federal law. Again, the dissent’s position rests on its mis\nconception of “the controversy between the parties.” Like §4 itself, the\nDeclaratory Judgment Act does not enlarge the jurisdiction of the\nfederal courts; it is “procedural only.” Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth,\n300 U. S. 227, 240 (1937). Thus, even in a declaratory judgment action,\na federal court could not entertain Discover’s state-law debt-collection\nclaim. Cf. 10B Wright & Miller §2758, pp. 519–521 (“The Declaratory\nJudgment Act was not intended to enable a party to obtain a change of\ntribunal from a state to federal court, and it is not the function of the\nfederal declaratory action merely to anticipate a defense that otherwise\ncould be presented in a state action.” (footnote omitted)).\n   20This Court has not decided whether §§3 and 4 apply to proceedings\n\nin state courts, see Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v.

But look through to what? The statute\nprovides a clear and sensible answer: The court may con\nsider the §4 petition if the court “would have” jurisdiction\nover “the subject matter of a suit arising out of the contro\nversy between the parties.” 9 U. S. C. §4.\n   The §4 petition in this case explains that the contro\nversy Discover seeks to arbitrate is whether “Discover\nBank charged illegal finance charges, interest and late\nfees.” App. 30. Discover contends in its petition that the\nresolution of this dispute is controlled by federal law—\nspecifically §27(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act\n(FDIA), 12 U. S. C. §1831d(a) (setting forth the interest\nrates a state-chartered, federally insured bank may\ncharge “notwithstanding any State constitution or stat\nute which is hereby preempted”). Vaden agrees that the\nlegality of Discover’s charges and fees is governed by\n2                   VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                       Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nthe FDIA.* A federal court therefore “would have juris\ndiction . . . of the subject matter of a suit arising out of\nthe controversy” Discover seeks to arbitrate. That suit\ncould be an action by Vaden asserting that the charges\nviolate the FDIA, or one by Discover seeking a declara\ntory judgment that they do not.\n  The majority is diverted off this straightforward path by\nthe fortuity that a complaint happens to have been filed in\nthis case. Instead of looking to the controversy the §4\npetitioner seeks to arbitrate, the majority focuses on the\ncontroversy underlying that complaint, and asks whether\n“the whole controversy,” as reflected in “the parties’ state\ncourt filings,” arises under federal law. Ante, at 16 (em\nphasis added). Because that litigation was commenced as\na state-law debt-collection claim, the majority concludes\nthere is no §4 jurisdiction.\n  This approach is contrary to the language of §4, and\nsharply restricts the ability of federal courts to enforce\nagreements to arbitrate. The “controversy” to which §4\nrefers is the dispute alleged to be subject to arbitration.\nThe §4 petitioner must set forth the nature of that dis\npute—the one he seeks to arbitrate—in the §4 petition\nseeking an order to compel arbitration. Section 4 requires\nthat the petitioner be “aggrieved” by the other party’s\n“failure, neglect, or refusal . . . to arbitrate under a written\nagreement for arbitration”; that language guides the\ndistrict court to the specific controversy the other party is\nunwilling to arbitrate.\n  That is clear from the FAA’s repeated and consistent\n——————\n  * Vaden has conceded that the FDIA completely pre-empts her state\nlaw counterclaims. See 489 F. 3d 594, 604, n. 10 (CA4 2007). What is\nsignificant about that concession is not Vaden’s agreement on the\njurisdictional question of complete pre-emption (which we need not and\ndo not address), cf. ante, at 19, but rather her agreement that federal\nlaw—the FDIA—governs her allegation that Discover’s charges and\nfees are illegal.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nuse of the term “controversy” to mean the specific dispute\nasserted to be subject to arbitration, not to some broader,\n“full flavor[ed]” or “full-bodied” notion of the disagreement\nbetween the parties. Ante, at 17, and n. 16. In §2, for\nexample, the “controversy” is the one “to [be] settle[d] by\narbitration” and the one “to [be] submit[ted] to\narbitration.” 9 U. S. C. §2. In §10(a)(3), it is a ground for\nvacating an arbitration award that the arbitrator refused\nto hear evidence “pertinent and material to the\ncontroversy”—obviously the “controversy” subject to\narbitration, or the arbitrator’s refusal to consider the\nevidence would hardly be objectionable. In §11(c), an\naward may be modified if “imperfect in matter of form not\naffecting the merits of the controversy”—again, necessar\nily the controversy submitted to arbitration, and therefore\nthe subject of the award.\n   There is no reason to suppose “controversy” meant the\ncontroversy subject to arbitration everywhere else in the\nFAA, but something quite different in §4. The issue is\nwhether there is jurisdiction to compel arbitration to\nresolve a controversy; why would the pertinent contro\nversy for assessing jurisdiction be anything other than the\nsame one asserted to be subject to arbitration?\n   The majority looks instead to the controversy the state\ncourt litigation seeks to resolve. This produces the odd\nresult of defining “controversy” more broadly than the §4\npetition itself. Discover’s petition does not seek to\narbitrate its state-law debt-collection claims, but rather\nVaden’s allegation that the fees Discover has been\ncharging her (and other members of her proposed class)\nviolate the FDIA. See App. 30. The majority does not\nappear to question that there would be federal jurisdiction\nover a suit arising out of the subject matter of that\ndispute. The majority finds no jurisdiction here, however,\nbecause “a federal court could not entertain Discover’s\nstate-law debt-collection claim.” Ante, at 20, n. 19. There\n4                VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nis no jurisdiction to compel arbitration of a plainly federal\ncontroversy—the FDIA dispute—because there is no juris\ndiction to compel arbitration of the debt-collection dispute.\nBut why Discover should have to demonstrate federal\njurisdiction over a state-court claim it does not seek to\narbitrate is a mystery. Cf. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hos\npital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 19–21 (1983)\n(affirming federal-court jurisdiction over a §4 petition\nseeking to arbitrate only one of two disputes pending in\nstate-court litigation); Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd,\n470 U. S. 213, 218–221 (1985) (when litigation involves\nmultiple claims, only some of which are covered by an\narbitration agreement, district court must compel arbitra\ntion of the covered claims if so requested).\n   The majority’s approach will allow federal jurisdiction to\ncompel arbitration of entirely state-law claims. Under\nthat approach the “controversy” is not the one the §4\npetitioner seeks to arbitrate, but a broader one encom\npassing the “whole controversy” between the parties.\nAnte, at 16. If that broader dispute involves both fed\neral and state-law claims, and the “originating” dispute\nis federal, ibid., a party could seek arbitration of just\nthe state-law claims. The “controversy” under the ma\njority’s view would qualify as federal, giving rise to §4\njurisdiction to compel arbitration of a purely state-law\nclaim.\n   Take this case as an example. If Vaden had filed her\nFDIA claim first, and Discover had responded with a\nstate-law debt-collection counterclaim, that suit is one\nthat “could be litigated in federal court.” Ante, at 15. As a\nresult, the majority’s approach would seem to permit\nVaden to file a §4 petition to compel arbitration of the\nentirely state-law-based debt-collection dispute, because\nthat dispute would be part and parcel of the “full fla\nvor[ed],” “originating” FDIA controversy. Ante, at 16, 17.\nDefining the controversy as the dispute the §4 petitioner\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nseeks to arbitrate eliminates this problem by ensuring\nthat the actual dispute subject to arbitration is federal.\n   The majority’s conclusion that this controversy “is not\none qualifying for federal-court adjudication,” ante, at 19,\nstems from its mistaken focus on the existing litigation.\nRather than ask whether a court “would have” jurisdiction\nover the “subject matter” of “a” suit arising out of the\n“controversy,” the majority asks only whether the court\ndoes have jurisdiction over the subject matter of a par\nticular complaint. But §4 does not speak of actual juris\ndiction over pending suits; it speaks subjunctively of\nprospective jurisdiction over “the subject matter of a suit\narising out of the controversy between the parties.” 9\nU. S. C. §4. The fact that Vaden has chosen to package\nthe FDIA controversy in counterclaims in pending state\ncourt litigation in no way means that a district court\n“would [not] have” jurisdiction over the “subject matter”\nof “a suit” arising out of the FDIA controversy. A big part\nof arbitration is avoiding the procedural niceties of for\nmal litigation; it would be odd to have the authority of a\ncourt to compel arbitration hinge on just such niceties in\na pending case.\n   By focusing on the sequence in which state-court litiga\ntion has unfolded, the majority crafts a rule that pro\nduces inconsistent results. Because Discover’s debt\ncollection claim was filed before Vaden’s counterclaims,\nthe majority treats the debt-collection dispute as the\n“originating controversy.” Ante, at 16. But nothing\nwould have prevented the same disagreements between\nthe parties from producing a different sequence of events.\nVaden could have filed a complaint raising her FDIA\nclaims before Discover sought to collect on any amounts\nVaden owes. Because the “originating controversy” in\nthat complaint would be whether Discover has charged\nfees illegal under federal law, in that situation Discover\npresumably could bring a §4 petition to compel arbitration\n6                VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nof the FDIA dispute. The majority’s rule thus makes §4\njurisdiction over the same controversy entirely dependent\nupon the happenstance of how state-court litigation has\nunfolded. Nothing in §4 suggests such a result.\n   The majority glosses over another problem inherent in\nits approach: In many if not most cases under §4, no com\nplaint will have been filed. See Hartford Financial Sys\ntems, Inc. v. Florida Software Servs., Inc., 712 F. 2d 724,\n728 (CA1 1983) (Breyer, J.) (“Normally, [§4] motions are\nbrought in independent proceedings”). What to “look\nthrough” to then? The majority instructs courts to look to\nthe “full-bodied controversy.” Ante, at 17, n. 16. But as\nthis case illustrates, that would lead to a different result\nhad the state-court complaint not been filed. Discover\ndoes not seek to arbitrate whether an outstanding debt\nexists; indeed, Discover’s §4 petition does not even allege\nany dispute on that point. See App. 28–41. A district\ncourt would therefore not understand the §4 “controversy”\nto include the debt-collection claim in the absence of the\nstate-court suit. Under the majority’s rule, the FDIA\ndispute would be treated as a “controversy” qualifying\nunder §4 before the state suit and counterclaims had been\nfiled, but not after.\n   The far more concrete and administrable approach\nwould be to apply the same rule in all instances: Look to\nthe controversy the §4 petitioner seeks to arbitrate—as set\nforth in the §4 petition—and assess whether a federal\ncourt would have jurisdiction over the subject matter of a\nsuit arising out of that controversy. The controversy the\nmoving party seeks to arbitrate and the other party will\nnot would be the same controversy used to assess jurisdic\ntion to compel arbitration.\n   The majority objects that this would allow a court to\n“hypothesiz[e] discrete controversies of its own design,”\nante, at 16, in an apparent effort to find federal\njurisdiction where there is none. Not so. A district court\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nentertaining a §4 petition is required to determine what “a\nsuit” arising out of the allegedly arbitrable controversy\nwould look like. There is no helping that, given the stat\nute’s subjunctive language. But that does not mean the\ninquiry is the free-form one the majority posits.\n   To the contrary, a district court must look to the specific\ncontroversy—the concrete dispute that one party has\n“fail[ed], neglect[ed], or refus[ed]” to arbitrate—and de\ntermine whether that controversy would give rise to a suit\nunder federal law. District courts do that sort of thing\noften enough; the exercise is closely analogous to the\njurisdictional analysis in a typical declaratory judgment\naction. See Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction\nLaborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1, 19\n(1983) (jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action\nexists when, “if the declaratory judgment defendant\nbrought a coercive action to enforce its rights, that suit\nwould necessarily present a federal question” (emphasis\nadded)). Looking to the specific controversy outlined in\nDiscover’s §4 petition (whether its fees violate the FDIA),\nit hardly requires “dream[ing]” to conceive of a lawsuit in\nwhich Vaden would claim the FDIA has been violated and\nDiscover would claim it has not. Ante, at 18.\n   Nor would respondents’ approach allow a §4 petitioner\nto simply “recharacterize” or “manufacture” a controversy\nto create federal jurisdiction. Ante, at 17. All of the\nestablished rules of federal jurisdiction are fully applicable\nin scrutinizing whether a federal court would have juris\ndiction over a suit arising out of the parties’ underlying\ncontroversy.\n   For example, a federal question must be presented by\nthe specific controversy the §4 petitioner seeks to arbi\ntrate, not by some hypothetical federal issue “lurking in\nthe background.” Gully v. First Nat. Bank in Meridian,\n299 U. S. 109, 117 (1936). A district court could not com\npel arbitration of a state-law dispute by pointing to a\n8                 VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\npotential federal defense that the §4 petitioner is not\nseeking to arbitrate, because the “claim itself must pre\nsent a federal question” to arise under federal law. Skelly\nOil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U. S. 667, 672\n(1950). Nor could a district court compel arbitration of a\ndispute that, though not federal in character, could lead to\nthe filing of a federal counterclaim, for “a counterclaim . . .\ncannot serve as the basis for [federal] jurisdiction” of the\nstate-law dispute itself. Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado\nAir Circulation Systems, Inc., 535 U. S. 826, 831 (2002).\n    Accordingly, petitioners may no more smuggle state-law\nclaims into federal court through §4 than they can through\ndeclaratory judgment actions, or any other federal cause of\naction. To the extent §4 brings some issues into federal\ncourt in a particular case that may not be brought in\nthrough other procedural mechanisms, it does so by\n“enlarg[ing] the range of remedies available in the federal\ncourts[,] . . . not extend[ing] their jurisdiction.” Skelly Oil,\nsupra, at 671.\n    That is why the majority’s recital of the basic rules of\nfederal-court jurisdiction in Part II of its opinion is beside\nthe point: No one disputes what those rules are, and no\none disputes that they must be followed under §4 in\ndeciding whether a federal court “would have jurisdiction\n. . . of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the\ncontroversy between the parties.” The issue is instead\nwhat suit should be scrutinized for compliance with those\nrules. In defining “controversy” by reference to existing\nlitigation, the majority artificially limits the reach of §4 to\nthe particular suit filed. The correct approach is to accord\n§4 the scope mandated by its language and look to “a suit,”\narising out of the “subject matter” of the “controversy” the\n§4 petitioner seeks to arbitrate, and determine whether a\nfederal court would have jurisdiction over such a suit.\n    The majority concludes by noting that state courts are\nobliged to honor and enforce agreements to arbitrate.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nAnte, at 20. The question here, however, is one of remedy.\nIt is a common feature of our federal system that States\noften provide remedies similar to those under federal law\nfor the same wrongs. We do not, however, narrowly con\nstrue the federal remedies—say federal antitrust or civil\nrights remedies—because state law provides remedies in\nthose areas as well. Cf. Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, 183\n(1961) (“It is no answer that the State has a law which if\nenforced would give relief”).\n                           *    *   *\n  Discover and Vaden have agreed to arbitrate any\ndispute arising out of Vaden’s account with Discover.\nVaden’s allegations against Discover have given rise to\nsuch a dispute. Discover seeks to arbitrate that contro\nversy, but Vaden refuses to do so. Resolution of the\ncontroversy is governed by federal law, specifically the\nFDIA. There is no dispute about that. In the absence of\nthe arbitration agreement, a federal court “would have\njurisdiction . . . of the subject matter of a suit arising out\nof the controversy between the parties,” 9 U. S. C. §4,\nwhether the suit were brought by Vaden or Discover.

Argued October 6, 2008—Decided March 9, 2009\nSection 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act), 9 U. S. C. §4, au\n  thorizes a United States district court to entertain a petition to com\n  pel arbitration if the court would have jurisdiction, “save for [the ar\n  bitration] agreement,” over “a suit arising out of the controversy\n  between the parties.”\n     Discover Bank’s servicing affiliate filed a complaint in Maryland\n  state court to recover past-due charges from one of its credit card\n  holders, petitioner Vaden. Discover’s pleading presented a claim\n  arising solely under state law. Vaden answered and counterclaimed,\n  alleging that Discover’s finance charges, interest, and late fees vio\n  lated state law. Invoking an arbitration clause in its cardholder\n  agreement with Vaden, Discover then filed a §4 petition in Federal\n  District Court to compel arbitration of Vaden’s counterclaims. The\n  District Court ordered arbitration.\n     On Vaden’s initial appeal, the Fourth Circuit remanded the case\n  for the District Court to determine whether it had subject-matter ju\n  risdiction over Discover’s §4 petition pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §1331,\n  which gives federal courts jurisdiction over cases “arising under” fed\n  eral law. The Fourth Circuit instructed the District Court to conduct\n  this inquiry by “looking through” the §4 petition to the substantive\n  controversy between the parties. With Vaden conceding that her\n  state-law counterclaims were completely preempted by §27 of the\n  Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), the District Court expressly\n  held that it had federal-question jurisdiction and again ordered arbi\n  tration. The Fourth Circuit then affirmed. The Court of Appeals rec\n  ognized that, in Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Sys\n  tems, Inc., 535 U. S. 826, this Court held that federal-question\n  jurisdiction depends on the contents of a well-pleaded complaint, and\n2                     VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    may not be predicated on counterclaims. It concluded, however, that\n    the complete preemption doctrine is paramount and thus overrides\n    the well-pleaded complaint rule.\nHeld: A federal court may “look through” a §4 petition to determine\n whether it is predicated on a controversy that “arises under” federal\n law; in keeping with the well-pleaded complaint rule as amplified in\n Holmes Group, however, a federal court may not entertain a §4 peti\n tion based on the contents of a counterclaim when the whole contro\n versy between the parties does not qualify for federal-court adjudica\n tion. Pp. 6–21.\n    (a) Congress enacted the FAA “[t]o overcome judicial resistance to\n arbitration,” Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440,\n 443, and to declare “ ‘a national policy favoring arbitration’ of claims\n that parties contract to settle in that manner,” Preston v. Ferrer, 552\n U. S. ___, ___. To that end, §2 makes arbitration agreements in con\n tracts “involving commerce” “valid, irrevocable, and enforceable,”\n while §4 provides for federal district court enforcement of those\n agreements. The “body of federal substantive law” generated by\n elaboration of §2 is equally binding on state and federal courts.\n Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1, 12. However, the FAA “re\n quir[es] [for access to a federal forum] an independent jurisdictional\n basis” over the parties’ dispute. Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. v.\n Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. ___, ___. Under the well-pleaded complaint\n rule, a suit “arises under” federal law for 28 U. S. C. §1331 purposes\n “only when the plaintiff’s statement of his own cause of action shows\n that it is based upon [federal law].” Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v.\n Mottley, 211 U. S. 149, 152. Federal jurisdiction cannot be predicated\n on an actual or anticipated defense, ibid., or rest upon an actual or\n anticipated counterclaim, Holmes Group, 535 U. S. 826. A complaint\n purporting to rest on state law can be recharacterized as one “arising\n under” federal law if the law governing the complaint is exclusively\n federal, see Beneficial Nat. Bank v. Anderson, 539 U. S. 1, 8, but a\n state-law-based counterclaim, even if similarly susceptible to rechar\n acterization, remains nonremovable. Pp. 6–11.\n    (b) FAA §4’s text drives the conclusion that a federal court should\n determine its jurisdiction by “looking through” a §4 petition to the\n parties’ underlying substantive controversy. The phrase “save for\n [the arbitration] agreement” indicates that the district court should\n assume the absence of the agreement and determine whether it\n “would have jurisdiction under title 28” over “the controversy be\n tween the parties,” which is most straightforwardly read to mean the\n “underlying dispute” between the parties. See Moses H. Cone Memo\n rial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 25, n. 32. Vaden’s\n argument that the relevant “controversy” is simply and only the par\n                    Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nties’ discrete dispute over the arbitrability of their claims is difficult\nto square with §4’s language. If courts are to determine whether they\nwould have jurisdiction “save for [the arbitration] agreement,” how\ncan a dispute over an arbitration agreement’s existence or applicabil\nity be the controversy that counts? The Court is unpersuaded that\nthe “save for” clause means only that the “antiquated and arcane”\nouster notion no longer holds sway. To the extent that the ancient\n“ouster” doctrine continued to impede specific enforcement of arbitra\ntion agreements, FAA §2, the Act’s “centerpiece provision,” Mitsubi\nshi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 625,\ndirectly attended to the problem by commanding that an arbitration\nagreement is enforceable just as any other contract. Vaden’s ap\nproach also has curious practical consequences. It would permit a\nfederal court to entertain a §4 petition only when a federal-question\nsuit is already before the court, when the parties satisfy the require\nments for diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction, or when the dispute\nover arbitrability involves a maritime contract, yet would not ac\ncommodate a §4 petitioner who could file a federal-question suit in,\nor remove such a suit to, federal court, but has not done so. In con\ntrast, the “look through” approach permits a §4 petitioner to ask a\nfederal court to compel arbitration without first taking the formal\nstep of initiating or removing a federal-question suit. Pp. 11–15.\n   (c) Having determined that a district court should look through a\n§4 petition, this Court considers whether the court “would have [fed\neral-question] jurisdiction” over “a suit arising out of the controversy”\nbetween Discover and Vaden. Because §4 does not enlarge federal\ncourt jurisdiction, a party seeking to compel arbitration may gain\nsuch a court’s assistance only if, “save for” the agreement, the entire,\nactual “controversy between the parties,” as they have framed it,\ncould be litigated in federal court. Here, the actual controversy is not\namenable to federal-court adjudication. The “controversy between\nthe parties” arose from Vaden’s “alleged debt,” a claim that plainly\ndid not “arise under” federal law; nor did it qualify under any other\nhead of federal-court jurisdiction. The Fourth Circuit misappre\nhended Holmes Group when it concluded that jurisdiction was proper\nbecause Vaden’s state-law counterclaims were completely preempted.\nUnder the well-pleaded complaint rule, a completely preempted coun\nterclaim remains a counterclaim, and thus does not provide a key ca\npable of opening a federal court’s door. Vaden’s responsive counter\nclaims challenging the legality of Discover’s charges are merely an\naspect of the whole controversy Discover and Vaden brought to state\ncourt. Whether one might hypothesize a federal-question suit involv\ning that subsidiary disagreement is beside the point. The relevant\nquestion is whether the whole controversy is one over which the fed\n4                      VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    eral courts would have jurisdiction. Section 4 does not give parties li\n    cense to recharacterize an existing controversy, or manufacture a\n    new controversy, in order to obtain a federal court’s aid in compelling\n    arbitration. It is hardly fortuitous that the controversy in this case\n    took the shape it did. Seeking to collect a debt, Discover filed an en\n    tirely state-law-grounded complaint in state court, and Vaden chose\n    to file responsive counterclaims. Section 4 does not invite federal\n    courts to dream up counterfactuals when actual litigation has defined\n    the parties’ controversy. Allowing parties to commandeer a federal\n    court to slice off responsive pleadings for discrete arbitration while\n    leaving the remainder of the parties’ controversy pending in state\n    court makes scant sense. Furthermore, the presence of a threshold\n    question whether a counterclaim alleged to be based on state law is\n    totally preempted by federal law may complicate the §4 inquiry. Al\n    though FAA §4 does not empower a federal court to order arbitration\n    here, Discover is not left without recourse. Because the FAA obliges\n    both state and federal courts to honor and enforce arbitration agree\n    ments, Discover may petition Maryland’s courts for appropriate aid\n    in enforcing the arbitration clause of its contracts with Maryland\n    credit cardholders.

S. C. §4,\nauthorizes a United States district court to entertain a\npetition to compel arbitration if the court would have\njurisdiction, “save for [the arbitration] agreement,” over “a\nsuit arising out of the controversy between the parties.”\nWe consider in this opinion two questions concerning a\ndistrict court’s subject-matter jurisdiction over a §4 peti\ntion: Should a district court, if asked to compel arbitration\npursuant to §4, “look through” the petition and grant the\nrequested relief if the court would have federal-question\njurisdiction over the underlying controversy? And if the\nanswer to that question is yes, may a district court exer\ncise jurisdiction over a §4 petition when the petitioner’s\ncomplaint rests on state law but an actual or potential\ncounterclaim rests on federal law?\n   The litigation giving rise to these questions began when\nDiscover Bank’s servicing affiliate filed a complaint in\nMaryland state court. Presenting a claim arising solely\nunder state law, Discover sought to recover past-due\ncharges from one of its credit cardholders, Betty Vaden.\n2                VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nVaden answered and counterclaimed, alleging that Dis\ncover’s finance charges, interest, and late fees violated\nstate law. Invoking an arbitration clause in its cardholder\nagreement with Vaden, Discover then filed a §4 petition in\nthe United States District Court for the District of Mary\nland to compel arbitration of Vaden’s counterclaims. The\nDistrict Court had subject-matter jurisdiction over its\npetition, Discover maintained, because Vaden’s state-law\ncounterclaims were completely preempted by federal\nbanking law. The District Court agreed and ordered\narbitration. Reasoning that a federal court has jurisdic\ntion over a §4 petition if the parties’ underlying dispute\npresents a federal question, the Fourth Circuit eventually\naffirmed.\n   We agree with the Fourth Circuit in part. A federal\ncourt may “look through” a §4 petition and order arbitra\ntion if, “save for [the arbitration] agreement,” the court\nwould have jurisdiction over “the [substantive] controversy\nbetween the parties.” We hold, however, that the Court of\nAppeals misidentified the dimensions of “the controversy\nbetween the parties.” Focusing on only a slice of the par\nties’ entire controversy, the court seized on Vaden’s coun\nterclaims, held them completely preempted, and on that\nbasis affirmed the District Court’s order compelling arbi\ntration.    Lost from sight was the triggering plea—\nDiscover’s claim for the balance due on Vaden’s account.\nGiven that entirely state-based plea and the established\nrule that federal-court jurisdiction cannot be invoked on\nthe basis of a defense or counterclaim, the whole “contro\nversy between the parties” does not qualify for federal\ncourt adjudication. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of\nAppeals’ judgment.\n                          I\n  This case originated as a garden-variety, state-law\nbased contract action: Discover sued its cardholder,\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nVaden, in a Maryland state court to recover arrearages\namounting to $10,610.74, plus interest and counsel fees.1\nVaden’s answer asserted usury as an affirmative defense.\nVaden also filed several counterclaims, styled as class\nactions. Like Discover’s complaint, Vaden’s pleadings\ninvoked only state law: Vaden asserted that Discover’s\ndemands for finance charges, interest, and late fees vio\nlated Maryland’s credit laws. See Md. Com. Law Code\nAnn. §§12–506, 12–506.2 (Lexis 2005). Neither party\ninvoked—by notice to the other or petition to the state\ncourt—the clause in the credit card agreement providing\nfor arbitration of “any claim or dispute between [Discover\nand Vaden],” App. 44 (capitalization and bold typeface\nomitted).2\n  Faced with Vaden’s counterclaims, Discover sought\nfederal-court aid. It petitioned the United States District\nCourt for the District of Maryland for an order, pursuant\nto §4 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act), 9\nU. S. C. §4, compelling arbitration of Vaden’s counter\nclaims.3 Although those counterclaims were framed under\nstate law, Discover urged that they were governed entirely\nby federal law, specifically, §27(a) of the Federal Deposit\n——————\n   1 Discover apparently had no access to a federal forum for its suit\n\nagainst Vaden on the basis of diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction.\nUnder that head of federal-court jurisdiction, the amount in contro\nversy must “excee[d] . . . $75,000.” 28 U. S. C. §1332(a).\n   2 Vaden’s preference for court adjudication is unsurprising. The arbi\n\ntration clause, framed by Discover, prohibited presentation of “any\nclaims as a representative or member of a class.” App. 45 (capitaliza\ntion omitted).\n   3 Section 4 reads, in relevant part:\n\n   “A party aggrieved by the alleged failure, neglect, or refusal of an\nother to arbitrate under a written agreement for arbitration may\npetition any United States district court which, save for such agree\nment, would have jurisdiction under title 28, in a civil action or in\nadmiralty of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the controversy\nbetween the parties, for an order directing that such arbitration pro\nceed in the manner provided for in such agreement.” 9 U. S. C. §4.\n4                VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nInsurance Act (FDIA), 12 U. S. C. §1831d(a). Section 27(a)\nprescribes the interest rates state-chartered, federally\ninsured banks like Discover can charge, “notwithstanding\nany State constitution or statute which is hereby pre\nempted.” This provision, Discover maintained, was com\npletely preemptive, i.e., it superseded otherwise applicable\nMaryland law, and placed Vaden’s counterclaims under\nthe exclusive governance of the FDIA. On that basis,\nDiscover asserted, the District Court had authority to\nentertain the §4 petition pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §1331,\nwhich gives federal courts jurisdiction over cases “arising\nunder” federal law.\n   The District Court granted Discover’s petition, ordered\narbitration, and stayed Vaden’s prosecution of her coun\nterclaims in state court pending the outcome of arbitra\ntion. App. to Pet. for Cert. 89a–90a. On Vaden’s initial\nappeal, the Fourth Circuit inquired whether the District\nCourt had federal-question jurisdiction over Discover’s §4\npetition. To make that determination, the Court of Ap\npeals instructed, the District Court should “look through”\nthe §4 petition to the substantive controversy between the\nparties. 396 F. 3d 366, 369, 373 (2005). The appellate\ncourt then remanded the case for an express determina\ntion whether that controversy presented “a properly in\nvoked federal question.” Id., at 373.\n   On remand, Vaden “concede[d] that the FDIA com\npletely preempts any state claims against a federally\ninsured bank.” 409 F. Supp. 2d 632, 636 (Md. 2006).\nAccepting this concession, the District Court expressly\nheld that it had federal-question jurisdiction over Dis\ncover’s §4 petition and again ordered arbitration. Id., at\n634–636, 639. In this second round, the Fourth Circuit\naffirmed, dividing 2 to 1. 489 F. 3d 594 (2007).\n   Recognizing that “a party may not create jurisdiction by\nconcession,” id., at 604, n. 10, the Fourth Circuit majority\nconducted its own analysis of FDIA §27(a), ultimately\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

Vornado Air\nCirculation Systems, Inc., 535 U. S. 826 (2002), the major\nity recognized, held that federal-question jurisdiction\ndepends on the contents of a well-pleaded complaint, and\nmay not be predicated on counterclaims. 489 F. 3d, at\n600, n. 4. Nevertheless, the majority concluded, the com\nplete preemption doctrine is paramount, “overrid[ing] such\nfundamental cornerstones of federal subject-matter juris\ndiction as the well-pleaded complaint rule.” Ibid. (quoting\n14B C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice\nand Procedure §3722.1, p. 511 (3d ed. 1998) (hereinafter\nWright & Miller)).5\n   The dissenting judge considered Holmes Group disposi\ntive. As §27(a) of the FDIA formed no part of Discover’s\ncomplaint, but came into the case only as a result of\nVaden’s responsive pleadings, the dissent reasoned,\n“[t]here was no ‘properly invoked federal question’ in the\nunderlying state case.” 489 F. 3d, at 610.\n   We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2008), in view of\nthe conflict among lower federal courts on whether district\ncourts, petitioned to order arbitration pursuant to §4 of\nthe FAA, may “look through” the petition and examine the\nparties’ underlying dispute to determine whether federal\nquestion jurisdiction exists over the §4 petition. Compare\nWisconsin v. Ho-Chunk Nation, 463 F. 3d 655, 659 (CA7\n——————\n  4 Our disposition of this case makes it unnecessary to take up the\n\nquestion of §27(a)’s preemptive force generally or in the particular\ncontext of Discover’s finance charges. We therefore express no opinion\non those issues. Cf. Beneficial Nat. Bank v. Anderson, 539 U. S. 1, 9–10\n(2003) (holding that the National Bank Act, 12 U. S. C. §§85, 86,\ncompletely preempts state-law usury claims against national banks).\n  5 But see 489 F. 3d 594, 612 (CA4 2007) (dissenting opinion) (observ\n\ning that the passage from Wright & Miller referenced by the majority\n“makes clear that the doctrine of complete preemption is exclusively\nfocused on claims in a plaintiff’s complaint”).\n6                  VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n2006) (in determining jurisdiction over a §4 petition, the\ncourt may not “look through” the petition and focus on the\nunderlying dispute); Smith Barney, Inc. v.

In support of that complaint, Discover invoked\nno federal law. When Vaden answered and counter\nclaimed, however, Discover asserted that federal law,\nspecifically §27(a) of the FDIA, displaced the state laws on\nwhich Vaden relied. What counts as the underlying dis\npute in a case so postured? May Discover invoke §4, not\non the basis of its own complaint, which had no federal\nelement, but on the basis of counterclaims asserted by\nVaden? To answer these questions, we first review rele\nvant provisions of the FAA, 9 U. S. C. §1 et seq., and con\ntrolling tenets of federal jurisdiction.\n                             II\n    In 1925, Congress enacted the FAA “[t]o overcome judi\n——————\n  6 In Community State Bank v.

It reads:\n  “If any suit or proceeding be brought in any of the courts of the\nUnited States upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agree\nment in writing for such arbitration, the court in which such suit is\npending, upon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit or\nproceeding is referable to arbitration under such an agreement, shall on\napplication of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such\narbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agree\nment, providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceed\ning with such arbitration.” 9 U.

S., at 25, n. 32).9 Given the substantive\nsupremacy of the FAA, but the Act’s nonjurisdictional\ncast, state courts have a prominent role to play as enforc\ners of agreements to arbitrate. See Southland, 465 U. S.,\nat 15; Moses H. Cone, 460 U. S., at 25, and n. 32.\n  The independent jurisdictional basis Discover relies\nupon in this case is 28 U. S. C. §1331, which vests in\nfederal district courts jurisdiction over “all civil actions\narising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the\nUnited States.” Under the longstanding well-pleaded\ncomplaint rule, however, a suit “arises under” federal law\n\n——————\n  9 Chapter 2 of the FAA, not implicated here, does expressly grant\n\nfederal courts jurisdiction to hear actions seeking to enforce an agree\nment or award falling under the Convention on the Recognition and\nEnforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. See 9 U. S. C. §203 (“An\naction or proceeding falling under the Convention shall be deemed to\narise under the laws and treaties of the United States. The district\ncourts of the United States . . . shall have original jurisdiction over such\nan action or proceeding . . . .”). FAA §205 goes further and overrides\nthe well-pleaded complaint rule pro tanto. 9 U. S. C. §205 (“The proce\ndure for removal of causes otherwise provided by law shall apply,\nexcept that the ground for removal provided in this section need not\nappear on the face of the complaint but may be shown in the petition\nfor removal.”). As Vaden points out, these sections demonstrate that\n“when Congress wants to expand [federal-court] jurisdiction, it knows\nhow to do so clearly and unequivocally.” Brief for Petitioner 38.\n                       Cite as: 556 U.

Co. v. Mottley, 211 U. S. 149, 152\n(1908). Federal jurisdiction cannot be predicated on an\nactual or anticipated defense: “It is not enough that the\nplaintiff alleges some anticipated defense to his cause of\naction and asserts that the defense is invalidated by some\nprovision of [federal law].” Ibid.\n   Nor can federal jurisdiction rest upon an actual or an\nticipated counterclaim. We so ruled, emphatically, in\nHolmes Group, 535 U. S. 826. Without dissent, the Court\nheld in Holmes Group that a federal counterclaim, even\nwhen compulsory, does not establish “arising under” juris\ndiction.10 Adhering assiduously to the well-pleaded com\nplaint rule, the Court observed, inter alia, that it would\nundermine the clarity and simplicity of that rule if federal\ncourts were obliged to consider the contents not only of the\ncomplaint but also of responsive pleadings in determining\nwhether a case “arises under” federal law. Id., at 832. See\n——————\n  10 Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc., 535\n\nU. S. 826 (2002), involved 28 U. S. C. §1295(a)(1), which vests in the\nFederal Circuit exclusive jurisdiction over “an appeal from a final\ndecision of a district court . . . if the jurisdiction of that court was based,\nin whole or in part, on [28 U. S. C. §]1338.” Section 1338(a), in turn,\nconfers on district courts “[exclusive] original jurisdiction of any civil\naction arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents.” The\nplaintiff’s complaint in Holmes Group presented a federal claim, but not\none relating to patents; the defendant counterclaimed for patent\ninfringement. The Court ruled that the case did not “aris[e] under” the\npatent laws by virtue of the patent counterclaim, and therefore held\nthat the Federal Circuit lacked appellate jurisdiction under §1295(a)(1).\nSee 535 U. S., at 830–832.\n  In reaching its decision in Holmes Group, the Court first attributed to\nthe words “arising under” in §1338(a) the same meaning those words\nhave in §1331. See id., at 829–830. It then reasoned that a counter\nclaim asserted in a responsive pleading cannot provide the basis for\n“arising under” jurisdiction consistently with the well-pleaded com\nplaint rule. See id., at 830–832.\n10                   VADEN v.

Under our precedent construing §1331, as just\nexplained, counterclaims, even if they rely exclusively on\nfederal substantive law, do not qualify a case for federal\ncourt cognizance.\n                             III\n   Attending to the language of the FAA and the above\ndescribed jurisdictional tenets, we approve the “look\nthrough” approach to this extent: A federal court may\n“look through” a §4 petition to determine whether it is\npredicated on an action that “arises under” federal law; in\nkeeping with the well-pleaded complaint rule as amplified\nin Holmes Group, however, a federal court may not enter\ntain a §4 petition based on the contents, actual or hypo\nthetical, of a counterclaim.\n                              A\n  The text of §4 drives our conclusion that a federal court\nshould determine its jurisdiction by “looking through” a §4\npetition to the parties’ underlying substantive controversy.\nWe reiterate §4’s relevant instruction: When one party\nseeks arbitration pursuant to a written agreement and the\nother resists, the proponent of arbitration may petition for\nan order compelling arbitration in\n    “any United States district court which, save for [the\n    arbitration] agreement, would have jurisdiction under\n    title 28, in a civil action or in admiralty of the subject\n    matter of a suit arising out of the controversy between\n    the parties.” 9 U. S. C. §4.\nThe phrase “save for [the arbitration] agreement” indi\ncates that the district court should assume the absence of\nthe arbitration agreement and determine whether it\n“would have jurisdiction under title 28” without it. See\n396 F. 3d, at 369, 372 (case below). Jurisdiction over\nwhat? The text of §4 refers us to “the controversy between\nthe parties.” That phrase, the Fourth Circuit said, and we\n12                   VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nagree, is most straightforwardly read to mean the “sub\nstantive conflict between the parties.” Id., at 370. See\nalso Moses H. Cone, 460 U. S., at 25, n. 32 (noting in dicta\nthat, to entertain a §4 petition, a federal court must have\njurisdiction over the “underlying dispute”).13\n   The majority of Courts of Appeals to address the ques\ntion, we acknowledge, have rejected the “look through”\napproach entirely, as Vaden asks us to do here. See supra,\nat 5–6. The relevant “controversy between the parties,”\nVaden insists, is simply and only the parties’ discrete\ndispute over the arbitrability of their claims. She relies,\nquite reasonably, on the fact that a §4 petition to compel\narbitration seeks no adjudication on the merits of the\nunderlying controversy. Indeed, its very purpose is to\nhave an arbitrator, rather than a court, resolve the merits.\nA §4 petition, Vaden observes, is essentially a plea for\nspecific performance of an agreement to arbitrate, and it\nthus presents principally contractual questions: Did the\nparties validly agree to arbitrate? What issues does their\nagreement encompass? Has one party dishonored the\nagreement?\n   Vaden’s argument, though reasonable, is difficult to\nsquare with the statutory language. Section 4 directs\ncourts to determine whether they would have jurisdiction\n“save for [the arbitration] agreement.” How, then, can a\ndispute over the existence or applicability of an arbitration\nagreement be the controversy that counts?\n——————\n   13 The parties’ underlying dispute may or may not be the subject of\n\npending litigation. This explains §4’s use of the conditional “would”\nand the indefinite “a suit.” A party often files a §4 petition to compel\narbitration precisely because it does not want to bring suit and litigate\nin court. Sometimes, however, a §4 petition is filed after litigation has\ncommenced. The party seeking to compel arbitration in such cases is\ntypically the defendant, who claims to be aggrieved by the plaintiff’s\nattempt to litigate rather than arbitrate. This case involves the rela\ntively unusual situation in which the party that initiated litigation of\nthe underlying dispute is also the party seeking to compel arbitration.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The “save for” clause, courts espousing the view em\nbraced by Vaden respond, means only that the “antiquated\nand arcane” ouster notion no longer holds sway. Drexel\nBurnham Lambert, Inc. v. Valenzuela Bock, 696 F. Supp.\n957, 961 (SDNY 1988). Adherents to this “ouster” expla\nnation of §4’s language recall that courts traditionally\nviewed arbitration clauses as unworthy attempts to “oust”\nthem of jurisdiction; accordingly, to guard against en\ncroachment on their domain, they refused to order specific\nenforcement of agreements to arbitrate. See H. R. Rep.\nNo. 96, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 1–2 (1924) (discussed in\nDean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U. S. 213, 219–220,\nand n. 6 (1985)). The “save for” clause, as comprehended\nby proponents of the “ouster” explanation, was designed to\nensure that courts would no longer consider themselves\nousted of jurisdiction and would therefore specifically\nenforce arbitration agreements. See, e.g., Westmoreland,\n100 F. 3d, at 267–268, and n. 6 (adopting the “ouster”\ninterpretation advanced in Drexel Burnham Lambert, 696\nF. Supp., at 961–963); Strong, 485 F. 3d, at 631 (Marcus,\nJ., specially concurring) (reading §4’s “save for” clause “as\ninstructing the court to ‘set aside’ not the arbitration\nagreement . . . , but merely the previous judicial hostility\nto arbitration agreements”).\n   We are not persuaded that the “ouster” explanation of\n§4’s “save for” clause carries the day. To the extent that\nthe ancient “ouster” doctrine continued to impede specific\nenforcement of arbitration agreements, §2 of the FAA, the\nAct’s “centerpiece provision,” Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v.\nSoler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 625 (1985),\ndirectly attended to the problem. Covered agreements to\narbitrate, §2 declares, are “valid, irrevocable, and enforce\nable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity\nfor the revocation of any contract.” Having commanded\nthat an arbitration agreement is enforceable just as any\nother contract, Congress had no cause to repeat the point.\n14                   VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nSee 1 I. MacNeil, R. Speidel, & T. Stipanowich, Federal\nArbitration Law §9.2.3.3, p. 9:18 (1995) (hereinafter\nMacNeil) (“Th[e] effort to connect the ‘save for’ language to\nthe ancient problem of ‘ouster of jurisdiction’ is imagina\ntive, but utterly unfounded and historically inaccurate.”\n(footnote omitted)).14\n   In addition to its textual implausibility, the approach\nVaden advocates has curious practical consequences. It\nwould permit a federal court to entertain a §4 petition only\nwhen a federal-question suit is already before the court,\nwhen the parties satisfy the requirements for diversity-of\ncitizenship jurisdiction, or when the dispute over arbitra\nbility involves a maritime contract. See, e.g., Westmore\nland, 100 F. 3d, at 268–269; 1 MacNeil §9.2.3.1, pp. 9:12–\n9:13 (when a federal-question suit has been filed in or\nremoved to federal court, the court “may order arbitration\nunder FAA §4”).15 Vaden’s approach would not accommo\ndate a §4 petitioner who could file a federal-question suit\nin (or remove such a suit to) federal court, but who has not\ndone so. In contrast, when the parties’ underlying dispute\narises under federal law, the “look through” approach\npermits a §4 petitioner to ask a federal court to compel\narbitration without first taking the formal step of initiat\ning or removing a federal-question suit—that is, without\nseeking federal adjudication of the very questions it wants\nto arbitrate rather than litigate. See 1 id., §9.2.3.3, p. 9:21\n——————\n  14 Because   “the ouster problem was just as great under state law as it\nwas under federal,” the absence of “save for” language in contempora\nneous state arbitration acts bolsters our conclusion that §4 was not\ndevised to dislodge the common-law ouster doctrine. 1 I. MacNeil, R.\nSpeidel, & T. Stipanowich, Federal Arbitration Law §9.2.3.3, p. 9:18\n(1995). See also 396 F. 3d 366, 369–370, n. 2 (CA4 2005) (case below).\n   15 Specific jurisdiction-granting provisions may also authorize a fed\n\neral court to entertain a petition to compel arbitration. See, e.g., 9\nU. S. C. §§203, 205 (providing for federal-court jurisdiction over arbitra\ntion agreements covered by the Convention on the Recognition and\nEnforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards).\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(explaining that the approach Vaden advocates “creates a\ntotally artificial distinction” based on whether a dispute is\nsubject to pending federal litigation).\n                              B\n   Having determined that a district court should “look\nthrough” a §4 petition, we now consider whether the court\n“would have [federal-question] jurisdiction” over “a suit\narising out of the controversy” between Discover and\nVaden. 9 U. S. C. §4. As explained above, §4 of the FAA\ndoes not enlarge federal-court jurisdiction; rather, it con\nfines federal courts to the jurisdiction they would have\n“save for [the arbitration] agreement.” See supra, at 7–8.\nMindful of that limitation, we read §4 to convey that a\nparty seeking to compel arbitration may gain a federal\ncourt’s assistance only if, “save for” the agreement, the\nentire, actual “controversy between the parties,” as they\nhave framed it, could be litigated in federal court. We\nconclude that the parties’ actual controversy, here precipi\ntated by Discover’s state-court suit for the balance due on\nVaden’s account, is not amenable to federal-court adjudi\ncation. Consequently, the §4 petition Discover filed in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Maryland\nmust be dismissed.\n   As the Fourth Circuit initially stated, the “controversy\nbetween the parties” arose from the “alleged debt” Vaden\nowed to Discover. 396 F. 3d, at 370. Discover’s complaint\nin Maryland state court plainly did not “arise under”\nfederal law, nor did it qualify under any other head of\nfederal-court jurisdiction. See supra, at 3, and n. 1.\n   In holding that Discover properly invoked federal-court\njurisdiction, the Fourth Circuit looked beyond Discover’s\ncomplaint and homed in on Vaden’s state-law-based de\nfense and counterclaims. Those responsive pleadings,\nDiscover alleged, and the Fourth Circuit determined, were\ncompletely preempted by the FDIA. See supra, at 3–4.\n16               VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe Fourth Circuit, however, misapprehended our deci\nsion in Holmes Group. Under the well-pleaded complaint\nrule, a completely preempted counterclaim remains a\ncounterclaim and thus does not provide a key capable of\nopening a federal court’s door. See supra, at 8–11. See\nalso Taylor v. Anderson, 234 U. S. 74, 75–76 (1914)\n(“[W]hether a case is one arising under [federal law] . . .\nmust be determined from what necessarily appears in the\nplaintiff’s statement of his own claim . . . , unaided by\nanything alleged in anticipation o[r] avoidance of defenses\nwhich it is thought the defendant may interpose.”).\n   Neither Discover nor THE CHIEF JUSTICE, concurring in\npart and dissenting in part (hereinafter dissent), defends\nthe Fourth Circuit’s reasoning. Instead, the dissent in\nsists that a federal court “would have” jurisdiction over\n“the controversy Discover seeks to arbitrate”—namely,\n“whether ‘Discover Bank charged illegal finance charges,\ninterest and late fees.’ ” Post, at 1 (quoting App. 30). The\ndissent hypothesizes two federal suits that might arise\nfrom this purported controversy: “an action by Vaden\nasserting that the charges violate the FDIA, or one by\nDiscover seeking a declaratory judgment that they do not.”\nPost, at 2.\n   There is a fundamental flaw in the dissent’s analysis: In\nlieu of focusing on the whole controversy as framed by the\nparties, the dissent hypothesizes discrete controversies of\nits own design. As the parties’ state-court filings reflect,\nthe originating controversy here concerns Vaden’s alleged\ndebt to Discover. Vaden’s responsive counterclaims chal\nlenging the legality of Discover’s charges are a discrete\naspect of the whole controversy Discover and Vaden\nbrought to state court. Whether one might imagine a\nfederal-question suit involving the parties’ disagreement\nover Discover’s charges is beside the point. The relevant\nquestion is whether the whole controversy between the\nparties—not just a piece broken off from that contro\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nversy—is one over which the federal courts would have\njurisdiction.\n   The dissent would have us treat a §4 petitioner’s state\nment of the issues to be arbitrated as the relevant contro\nversy even when that statement does not convey the full\nflavor of the parties’ entire dispute. Artful dodges by a §4\npetitioner should not divert us from recognizing the actual\ndimensions of that controversy. The text of §4 instructs\nfederal courts to determine whether they would have\njurisdiction over “a suit arising out of the controversy\nbetween the parties”; it does not give §4 petitioners license\nto recharacterize an existing controversy, or manufacture\na new controversy, in an effort to obtain a federal court’s\naid in compelling arbitration.16\n   Viewed contextually and straightforwardly, it is hardly\n“fortuit[ous]” that the controversy in this case took the\nshape it did. Cf. post, at 2. Seeking to collect a debt,\nDiscover filed an entirely state-law-grounded complaint in\nstate court, and Vaden chose to file responsive counter\nclaims. Perhaps events could have unfolded differently,\n——————\n  16 Noting   that the FAA sometimes uses “controversy” to refer to the\ndispute to be arbitrated, the dissent insists that it must have the same\nmeaning in §4. Cf. post, at 2–3. But §4 does not ask a district court to\ndetermine whether it would have jurisdiction over “the controversy the\n§4 petitioner seeks to arbitrate”; it asks whether the court would have\njurisdiction over “the controversy between the parties.” Here, the issue\nDiscover seeks to arbitrate is undeniably only a fraction of the contro\nversy between the parties. We decline to rewrite the statute to ignore\nthis reality.\n   Moreover, our reading of §4 fully accords with the statute’s subjunc\ntive construction (“would have jurisdiction”) and its reference to “a\nsuit.” Cf. post, at 5. Section 4, we recognize, enables a party to seek an\norder compelling arbitration even when the parties’ controversy is not\nthe subject of pending litigation. See supra, at 12, n. 13, 14–15.\nWhether or not the controversy between the parties is embodied in an\nexisting suit, the relevant question remains the same: Would a federal\ncourt have jurisdiction over an action arising out of that full-bodied\ncontroversy?\n18                   VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbut §4 does not invite federal courts to dream up counter\nfactuals when actual litigation has defined the parties’\ncontroversy.17\n   As the dissent would have it, parties could commandeer\na federal court to slice off responsive pleadings for arbitra\ntion while leaving the remainder of the parties’ contro\nversy pending in state court. That seems a bizarre way to\nproceed. In this case, Vaden’s counterclaims would be\nsent to arbitration while the complaint to which they are\naddressed—Discover’s state-law-grounded debt-collection\naction—would remain pending in a Maryland court.\nWhen the controversy between the parties is not one over\nwhich a federal court would have jurisdiction, it makes\nscant sense to allow one of the parties to enlist a federal\ncourt to disturb the state-court proceedings by carving out\nissues for separate resolution.18\n——————\n   17Our approach, the dissent asserts, would produce “inconsistent\n\nresults” based “upon the happenstance of how state-court litigation has\nunfolded.” Post, at 5, 6. Of course, a party’s ability to gain adjudication\nof a federal question in federal court often depends on how that ques\ntion happens to have been presented, and the dissent’s argument is\nlittle more than a veiled criticism of Holmes Group and the well\npleaded complaint rule. When a litigant files a state-law claim in state\ncourt, and her opponent parries with a federal counterclaim, the action\nis not removable to federal court, even though it would have been\nremovable had the order of filings been reversed. See Holmes Group,\n535 U. S., at 831–832.\n      True, the outcome in this case may well have been different had\nVaden initiated an FDIA claim about the legality of Discover’s charges.\nBecause that controversy likely would have been amenable to adjudica\ntion in a federal forum, Discover could have asked a federal court to\nsend the parties to arbitration. But that is not what occurred here.\nVaden did not invoke the FDIA. Indeed, she framed her counterclaims\nunder state law and clearly preferred the Maryland forum. The dis\nsent’s hypothesizing about the case that might have been brought does\nnot provide a basis for federal-court jurisdiction.\n   18 The dissent observes, post, at 4, that our rule might enable a party\n\nto request a federal court’s aid in compelling arbitration of a state-law\ncounterclaim that might otherwise be adjudicated in state court.

This case is illustrative. The dissent\nrelates that Vaden eventually conceded that FDIA §27(a),\nnot Maryland law, governs the charges and fees Discover\nmay impose. Post, at 1–2. But because the issue is juris\ndictional, Vaden’s concession is not determinative. See\nsupra, at 4–5, and n. 4. The dissent simply glides by the\npreemption issue, devoting no attention to it, although\nthis Court has not yet resolved the matter.\n  In sum, §4 of the FAA instructs district courts asked to\ncompel arbitration to inquire whether the court would\nhave jurisdiction, “save for [the arbitration] agreement,”\nover “a suit arising out of the controversy between the\nparties.” We read that prescription in light of the well\npleaded complaint rule and the corollary rule that federal\njurisdiction cannot be invoked on the basis of a defense or\ncounterclaim. Parties may not circumvent those rules by\nasking a federal court to order arbitration of the portion of\na controversy that implicates federal law when the court\nwould not have federal-question jurisdiction over the\ncontroversy as a whole. It does not suffice to show that a\nfederal question lurks somewhere inside the parties’ con\ntroversy, or that a defense or counterclaim would arise\nunder federal law. Because the controversy between\nDiscover and Vaden, properly perceived, is not one qualify\ning for federal-court adjudication, §4 of the FAA does not\nempower a federal court to order arbitration of that con\ntroversy, in whole or in part.19\n——————\na federal court would have jurisdiction over the parties’ whole contro\nversy, we see nothing anomalous about the court’s ordering arbitration\nof a state-law claim constituting part of that controversy. Federal\ncourts routinely exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law\nclaims. See 28 U. S. C. §1367.\n  19 This Court’s declaratory judgment jurisprudence in no way under\n20                   VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Discover, we note, is not left without recourse. Under\nthe FAA, state courts as well as federal courts are obliged\nto honor and enforce agreements to arbitrate. Southland,\n465 U. S., at 12; Moses H. Cone, 460 U. S., at 25, 26, n. 34.\nSee also supra, at 7–8. Discover may therefore petition a\nMaryland court for aid in enforcing the arbitration clause\nof its contracts with Maryland cardholders.\n   True, Maryland’s high court has held that §§3 and 4 of\nthe FAA prescribe federal-court procedures and, therefore,\ndo not bind the state courts.20 But Discover scarcely lacks\nan available state remedy. Section 2 of the FAA, which\ndoes bind the state courts, renders agreements to arbitrate\n“valid, irrevocable, and enforceable.” This provision “car\nries with it duties [to credit and enforce arbitration\nagreements] indistinguishable from those imposed on\nfederal courts by FAA §§3 and 4.” 1 MacNeil §10.8.1,\np. 10:77. Notably, Maryland, like many other States,\nprovides a statutory remedy nearly identical to §4. See\nMd. Cts. & Jud. Proc. Code Ann. §3–207 (Lexis 2006) (“If a\nparty to an arbitration agreement . . . refuses to arbitrate,\nthe other party may file a petition with a court to order\n——————\ncuts our analysis. Cf. post, at 2, 7. Discover, the dissent implies, could\nhave brought suit in federal court seeking a declaration that its charges\nconform to federal law. Again, the dissent’s position rests on its mis\nconception of “the controversy between the parties.” Like §4 itself, the\nDeclaratory Judgment Act does not enlarge the jurisdiction of the\nfederal courts; it is “procedural only.” Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth,\n300 U. S. 227, 240 (1937). Thus, even in a declaratory judgment action,\na federal court could not entertain Discover’s state-law debt-collection\nclaim. Cf. 10B Wright & Miller §2758, pp. 519–521 (“The Declaratory\nJudgment Act was not intended to enable a party to obtain a change of\ntribunal from a state to federal court, and it is not the function of the\nfederal declaratory action merely to anticipate a defense that otherwise\ncould be presented in a state action.” (footnote omitted)).\n   20This Court has not decided whether §§3 and 4 apply to proceedings\n\nin state courts, see Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v.

But look through to what? The statute\nprovides a clear and sensible answer: The court may con\nsider the §4 petition if the court “would have” jurisdiction\nover “the subject matter of a suit arising out of the contro\nversy between the parties.” 9 U. S. C. §4.\n   The §4 petition in this case explains that the contro\nversy Discover seeks to arbitrate is whether “Discover\nBank charged illegal finance charges, interest and late\nfees.” App. 30. Discover contends in its petition that the\nresolution of this dispute is controlled by federal law—\nspecifically §27(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act\n(FDIA), 12 U. S. C. §1831d(a) (setting forth the interest\nrates a state-chartered, federally insured bank may\ncharge “notwithstanding any State constitution or stat\nute which is hereby preempted”). Vaden agrees that the\nlegality of Discover’s charges and fees is governed by\n2                   VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                       Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nthe FDIA.* A federal court therefore “would have juris\ndiction . . . of the subject matter of a suit arising out of\nthe controversy” Discover seeks to arbitrate. That suit\ncould be an action by Vaden asserting that the charges\nviolate the FDIA, or one by Discover seeking a declara\ntory judgment that they do not.\n  The majority is diverted off this straightforward path by\nthe fortuity that a complaint happens to have been filed in\nthis case. Instead of looking to the controversy the §4\npetitioner seeks to arbitrate, the majority focuses on the\ncontroversy underlying that complaint, and asks whether\n“the whole controversy,” as reflected in “the parties’ state\ncourt filings,” arises under federal law. Ante, at 16 (em\nphasis added). Because that litigation was commenced as\na state-law debt-collection claim, the majority concludes\nthere is no §4 jurisdiction.\n  This approach is contrary to the language of §4, and\nsharply restricts the ability of federal courts to enforce\nagreements to arbitrate. The “controversy” to which §4\nrefers is the dispute alleged to be subject to arbitration.\nThe §4 petitioner must set forth the nature of that dis\npute—the one he seeks to arbitrate—in the §4 petition\nseeking an order to compel arbitration. Section 4 requires\nthat the petitioner be “aggrieved” by the other party’s\n“failure, neglect, or refusal . . . to arbitrate under a written\nagreement for arbitration”; that language guides the\ndistrict court to the specific controversy the other party is\nunwilling to arbitrate.\n  That is clear from the FAA’s repeated and consistent\n——————\n  * Vaden has conceded that the FDIA completely pre-empts her state\nlaw counterclaims. See 489 F. 3d 594, 604, n. 10 (CA4 2007). What is\nsignificant about that concession is not Vaden’s agreement on the\njurisdictional question of complete pre-emption (which we need not and\ndo not address), cf. ante, at 19, but rather her agreement that federal\nlaw—the FDIA—governs her allegation that Discover’s charges and\nfees are illegal.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nuse of the term “controversy” to mean the specific dispute\nasserted to be subject to arbitration, not to some broader,\n“full flavor[ed]” or “full-bodied” notion of the disagreement\nbetween the parties. Ante, at 17, and n. 16. In §2, for\nexample, the “controversy” is the one “to [be] settle[d] by\narbitration” and the one “to [be] submit[ted] to\narbitration.” 9 U. S. C. §2. In §10(a)(3), it is a ground for\nvacating an arbitration award that the arbitrator refused\nto hear evidence “pertinent and material to the\ncontroversy”—obviously the “controversy” subject to\narbitration, or the arbitrator’s refusal to consider the\nevidence would hardly be objectionable. In §11(c), an\naward may be modified if “imperfect in matter of form not\naffecting the merits of the controversy”—again, necessar\nily the controversy submitted to arbitration, and therefore\nthe subject of the award.\n   There is no reason to suppose “controversy” meant the\ncontroversy subject to arbitration everywhere else in the\nFAA, but something quite different in §4. The issue is\nwhether there is jurisdiction to compel arbitration to\nresolve a controversy; why would the pertinent contro\nversy for assessing jurisdiction be anything other than the\nsame one asserted to be subject to arbitration?\n   The majority looks instead to the controversy the state\ncourt litigation seeks to resolve. This produces the odd\nresult of defining “controversy” more broadly than the §4\npetition itself. Discover’s petition does not seek to\narbitrate its state-law debt-collection claims, but rather\nVaden’s allegation that the fees Discover has been\ncharging her (and other members of her proposed class)\nviolate the FDIA. See App. 30. The majority does not\nappear to question that there would be federal jurisdiction\nover a suit arising out of the subject matter of that\ndispute. The majority finds no jurisdiction here, however,\nbecause “a federal court could not entertain Discover’s\nstate-law debt-collection claim.” Ante, at 20, n. 19. There\n4                VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nis no jurisdiction to compel arbitration of a plainly federal\ncontroversy—the FDIA dispute—because there is no juris\ndiction to compel arbitration of the debt-collection dispute.\nBut why Discover should have to demonstrate federal\njurisdiction over a state-court claim it does not seek to\narbitrate is a mystery. Cf. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hos\npital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 19–21 (1983)\n(affirming federal-court jurisdiction over a §4 petition\nseeking to arbitrate only one of two disputes pending in\nstate-court litigation); Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd,\n470 U. S. 213, 218–221 (1985) (when litigation involves\nmultiple claims, only some of which are covered by an\narbitration agreement, district court must compel arbitra\ntion of the covered claims if so requested).\n   The majority’s approach will allow federal jurisdiction to\ncompel arbitration of entirely state-law claims. Under\nthat approach the “controversy” is not the one the §4\npetitioner seeks to arbitrate, but a broader one encom\npassing the “whole controversy” between the parties.\nAnte, at 16. If that broader dispute involves both fed\neral and state-law claims, and the “originating” dispute\nis federal, ibid., a party could seek arbitration of just\nthe state-law claims. The “controversy” under the ma\njority’s view would qualify as federal, giving rise to §4\njurisdiction to compel arbitration of a purely state-law\nclaim.\n   Take this case as an example. If Vaden had filed her\nFDIA claim first, and Discover had responded with a\nstate-law debt-collection counterclaim, that suit is one\nthat “could be litigated in federal court.” Ante, at 15. As a\nresult, the majority’s approach would seem to permit\nVaden to file a §4 petition to compel arbitration of the\nentirely state-law-based debt-collection dispute, because\nthat dispute would be part and parcel of the “full fla\nvor[ed],” “originating” FDIA controversy. Ante, at 16, 17.\nDefining the controversy as the dispute the §4 petitioner\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nseeks to arbitrate eliminates this problem by ensuring\nthat the actual dispute subject to arbitration is federal.\n   The majority’s conclusion that this controversy “is not\none qualifying for federal-court adjudication,” ante, at 19,\nstems from its mistaken focus on the existing litigation.\nRather than ask whether a court “would have” jurisdiction\nover the “subject matter” of “a” suit arising out of the\n“controversy,” the majority asks only whether the court\ndoes have jurisdiction over the subject matter of a par\nticular complaint. But §4 does not speak of actual juris\ndiction over pending suits; it speaks subjunctively of\nprospective jurisdiction over “the subject matter of a suit\narising out of the controversy between the parties.” 9\nU. S. C. §4. The fact that Vaden has chosen to package\nthe FDIA controversy in counterclaims in pending state\ncourt litigation in no way means that a district court\n“would [not] have” jurisdiction over the “subject matter”\nof “a suit” arising out of the FDIA controversy. A big part\nof arbitration is avoiding the procedural niceties of for\nmal litigation; it would be odd to have the authority of a\ncourt to compel arbitration hinge on just such niceties in\na pending case.\n   By focusing on the sequence in which state-court litiga\ntion has unfolded, the majority crafts a rule that pro\nduces inconsistent results. Because Discover’s debt\ncollection claim was filed before Vaden’s counterclaims,\nthe majority treats the debt-collection dispute as the\n“originating controversy.” Ante, at 16. But nothing\nwould have prevented the same disagreements between\nthe parties from producing a different sequence of events.\nVaden could have filed a complaint raising her FDIA\nclaims before Discover sought to collect on any amounts\nVaden owes. Because the “originating controversy” in\nthat complaint would be whether Discover has charged\nfees illegal under federal law, in that situation Discover\npresumably could bring a §4 petition to compel arbitration\n6                VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nof the FDIA dispute. The majority’s rule thus makes §4\njurisdiction over the same controversy entirely dependent\nupon the happenstance of how state-court litigation has\nunfolded. Nothing in §4 suggests such a result.\n   The majority glosses over another problem inherent in\nits approach: In many if not most cases under §4, no com\nplaint will have been filed. See Hartford Financial Sys\ntems, Inc. v. Florida Software Servs., Inc., 712 F. 2d 724,\n728 (CA1 1983) (Breyer, J.) (“Normally, [§4] motions are\nbrought in independent proceedings”). What to “look\nthrough” to then? The majority instructs courts to look to\nthe “full-bodied controversy.” Ante, at 17, n. 16. But as\nthis case illustrates, that would lead to a different result\nhad the state-court complaint not been filed. Discover\ndoes not seek to arbitrate whether an outstanding debt\nexists; indeed, Discover’s §4 petition does not even allege\nany dispute on that point. See App. 28–41. A district\ncourt would therefore not understand the §4 “controversy”\nto include the debt-collection claim in the absence of the\nstate-court suit. Under the majority’s rule, the FDIA\ndispute would be treated as a “controversy” qualifying\nunder §4 before the state suit and counterclaims had been\nfiled, but not after.\n   The far more concrete and administrable approach\nwould be to apply the same rule in all instances: Look to\nthe controversy the §4 petitioner seeks to arbitrate—as set\nforth in the §4 petition—and assess whether a federal\ncourt would have jurisdiction over the subject matter of a\nsuit arising out of that controversy. The controversy the\nmoving party seeks to arbitrate and the other party will\nnot would be the same controversy used to assess jurisdic\ntion to compel arbitration.\n   The majority objects that this would allow a court to\n“hypothesiz[e] discrete controversies of its own design,”\nante, at 16, in an apparent effort to find federal\njurisdiction where there is none. Not so. A district court\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nentertaining a §4 petition is required to determine what “a\nsuit” arising out of the allegedly arbitrable controversy\nwould look like. There is no helping that, given the stat\nute’s subjunctive language. But that does not mean the\ninquiry is the free-form one the majority posits.\n   To the contrary, a district court must look to the specific\ncontroversy—the concrete dispute that one party has\n“fail[ed], neglect[ed], or refus[ed]” to arbitrate—and de\ntermine whether that controversy would give rise to a suit\nunder federal law. District courts do that sort of thing\noften enough; the exercise is closely analogous to the\njurisdictional analysis in a typical declaratory judgment\naction. See Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction\nLaborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1, 19\n(1983) (jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action\nexists when, “if the declaratory judgment defendant\nbrought a coercive action to enforce its rights, that suit\nwould necessarily present a federal question” (emphasis\nadded)). Looking to the specific controversy outlined in\nDiscover’s §4 petition (whether its fees violate the FDIA),\nit hardly requires “dream[ing]” to conceive of a lawsuit in\nwhich Vaden would claim the FDIA has been violated and\nDiscover would claim it has not. Ante, at 18.\n   Nor would respondents’ approach allow a §4 petitioner\nto simply “recharacterize” or “manufacture” a controversy\nto create federal jurisdiction. Ante, at 17. All of the\nestablished rules of federal jurisdiction are fully applicable\nin scrutinizing whether a federal court would have juris\ndiction over a suit arising out of the parties’ underlying\ncontroversy.\n   For example, a federal question must be presented by\nthe specific controversy the §4 petitioner seeks to arbi\ntrate, not by some hypothetical federal issue “lurking in\nthe background.” Gully v. First Nat. Bank in Meridian,\n299 U. S. 109, 117 (1936). A district court could not com\npel arbitration of a state-law dispute by pointing to a\n8                 VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\npotential federal defense that the §4 petitioner is not\nseeking to arbitrate, because the “claim itself must pre\nsent a federal question” to arise under federal law. Skelly\nOil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U. S. 667, 672\n(1950). Nor could a district court compel arbitration of a\ndispute that, though not federal in character, could lead to\nthe filing of a federal counterclaim, for “a counterclaim . . .\ncannot serve as the basis for [federal] jurisdiction” of the\nstate-law dispute itself. Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado\nAir Circulation Systems, Inc., 535 U. S. 826, 831 (2002).\n    Accordingly, petitioners may no more smuggle state-law\nclaims into federal court through §4 than they can through\ndeclaratory judgment actions, or any other federal cause of\naction. To the extent §4 brings some issues into federal\ncourt in a particular case that may not be brought in\nthrough other procedural mechanisms, it does so by\n“enlarg[ing] the range of remedies available in the federal\ncourts[,] . . . not extend[ing] their jurisdiction.” Skelly Oil,\nsupra, at 671.\n    That is why the majority’s recital of the basic rules of\nfederal-court jurisdiction in Part II of its opinion is beside\nthe point: No one disputes what those rules are, and no\none disputes that they must be followed under §4 in\ndeciding whether a federal court “would have jurisdiction\n. . . of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the\ncontroversy between the parties.” The issue is instead\nwhat suit should be scrutinized for compliance with those\nrules. In defining “controversy” by reference to existing\nlitigation, the majority artificially limits the reach of §4 to\nthe particular suit filed. The correct approach is to accord\n§4 the scope mandated by its language and look to “a suit,”\narising out of the “subject matter” of the “controversy” the\n§4 petitioner seeks to arbitrate, and determine whether a\nfederal court would have jurisdiction over such a suit.\n    The majority concludes by noting that state courts are\nobliged to honor and enforce agreements to arbitrate.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nAnte, at 20. The question here, however, is one of remedy.\nIt is a common feature of our federal system that States\noften provide remedies similar to those under federal law\nfor the same wrongs. We do not, however, narrowly con\nstrue the federal remedies—say federal antitrust or civil\nrights remedies—because state law provides remedies in\nthose areas as well. Cf. Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, 183\n(1961) (“It is no answer that the State has a law which if\nenforced would give relief”).\n                           *    *   *\n  Discover and Vaden have agreed to arbitrate any\ndispute arising out of Vaden’s account with Discover.\nVaden’s allegations against Discover have given rise to\nsuch a dispute. Discover seeks to arbitrate that contro\nversy, but Vaden refuses to do so. Resolution of the\ncontroversy is governed by federal law, specifically the\nFDIA. There is no dispute about that. In the absence of\nthe arbitration agreement, a federal court “would have\njurisdiction . . . of the subject matter of a suit arising out\nof the controversy between the parties,” 9 U. S.
