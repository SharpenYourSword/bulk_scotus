HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 07–499.      Argued November 5, 2008—Decided March 3, 2009\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) bars an alien from obtain\n  ing refugee status in this country if he “assisted, or otherwise partici\n  pated in the persecution of any person on account of race, religion,\n  nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n  opinion.” 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(42). This so-called “persecutor bar” ap\n  plies to those seeking asylum or withholding of removal, but does not\n  disqualify an alien from receiving a temporary deferral of removal\n  under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or\n  Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). During the time peti\n  tioner, an Eritrean national, was forced to work as a prison guard in\n  that country, the prisoners he guarded were persecuted on grounds\n  protected under §1101(a)(42). After escaping to the United States,\n  petitioner applied for asylum and withholding of removal. Conclud\n  ing that he assisted in the persecution of prisoners by working as an\n  armed guard, the Immigration Judge denied relief on the basis of the\n  persecutor bar, but granted deferral of removal under CAT because\n  petitioner was likely to be tortured if returned to Eritrea. The Board\n  of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed in all respects, holding, inter\n  alia, that the persecutor bar applies even if the alien’s assistance in\n  persecution was coerced or otherwise the product of duress. The BIA\n  followed its earlier decisions finding Fedorenko v. United States, 449\n  U. S. 490, controlling. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, relying on its\n  precedent following the same reasoning.\nHeld: The BIA and Fifth Circuit misapplied Fedorenko as mandating\n that whether an alien is compelled to assist in persecution is immate\n rial for prosecutor-bar purposes. The BIA must interpret the statute,\n free from this mistaken legal premise, in the first instance. Pp. 4–12.\n    (a) Under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.

S. 837, 842–843, the BIA is entitled to deference in\n    interpreting ambiguous INA provisions, see, e.g., INS v. Aguirre-\n    Aguirre, 526 U. S. 415, 424–425. When the BIA has not spoken on “a\n    matter that statutes place primarily in agency hands,” this Court’s\n    ordinary rule is to remand to allow “the BIA . . . to address the mat\n    ter in the first instance in light of its own experience.” INS v. Or\n    lando Ventura, 537 U. S. 12, 16–17. Pp. 4–5.\n       (b) As there is substance both to petitioner’s contention that invol\n    untary acts cannot implicate the persecutor bar because “persecu\n    tion” presumes moral blameworthiness, and to the Government’s ar\n    gument that the question at issue is answered by the statute’s failure\n    to provide an exception for coerced conduct, it must be concluded that\n    the INA has an ambiguity that the BIA should address in the first in\n    stance. Fedorenko, which addressed a different statute enacted for a\n    different purpose, does not control the BIA’s interpretation of this\n    persecutor bar. In holding that voluntariness was not required with\n    respect to such a bar in the Displaced Persons Act of 1948 (DPA), Fe\n    dorenko contrasted the omission there of the word “voluntary” with\n    the word’s inclusion in a related statutory subsection. 449 U. S., at\n    512. Because Congress did not use the word “voluntary” anywhere in\n    the persecutor bar at issue here, its omission cannot carry the same\n    significance as it did in Fedorenko. Moreover, the DPA’s exclusion of\n    even those involved in nonculpable, involuntary assistance in perse\n    cution was enacted in part to address the Holocaust and its horror,\n    see id., at 511, n. 32, whereas the persecutor bar in this case was en\n    acted as part of the Refugee Act of 1980, which was designed to pro\n    vide a general rule for the ongoing treatment of all refugees and dis\n    placed persons, see, e.g., Aguirre-Aguirre, supra, at 427. Pp. 5–8.\n       (c) Whether a BIA determination that the persecution bar contains\n    no exception for coerced conduct would be reasonable, and thus owed\n    Chevron deference, is a legitimate question; but it is not presented\n    here. In denying petitioner relief, the BIA recited a rule it has devel\n    oped in its cases: An alien’s motivation and intent are irrelevant to\n    the issue whether he “assisted” in persecution; rather, his actions’ ob\n    jective effect controls. A reading of those decisions confirms that the\n    BIA has not exercised its interpretive authority but, instead, has\n    deemed its interpretation to be mandated by Fedorenko. This error\n    prevented the BIA from fully considering the statutory question pre\n    sented. Its mistaken assumption stems from a failure to recognize\n    the inapplicability of the statutory construction principle invoked in\n    Fedorenko, as well as a failure to appreciate the differences in statu\n    tory purpose. The BIA is not bound to apply the Fedorenko rule to\n    the persecutor bar here at issue.

ERIC\n     H. HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [March 3, 2009] \n\n\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  An alien who fears persecution in his homeland and\nseeks refugee status in this country is barred from obtain\ning that relief if he has persecuted others.\n    “The term ‘refugee’ does not include any person who\n    ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in\n    the persecution of any person on account of race, relig\n    ion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n    group, or political opinion.”     Immigration and Na\n    tionality Act (INA), §101, 66 Stat. 166, as added by\n    Refugee Act of 1980, §201(a), 94 Stat. 102–103, 8\n    U. S. C. §1101(a)(42).\nThis so-called “persecutor bar” applies to those seeking\nasylum, §1158(b)(2)(A)(i), or withholding of removal,\n§1231(b)(3)(B)(i). It does not disqualify an alien from\nreceiving a temporary deferral of removal under the Con\nvention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or\nDegrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), art. 3, Dec.\n10, 1984, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100–20, p. 20, 1465 U. N. T. S.\n85; 8 CFR §1208.17(a) (2008).\n  In this case the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA)\n2                    NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndetermined that the persecutor bar applies even if the\nalien’s assistance in persecution was coerced or otherwise\nthe product of duress. In so ruling the BIA followed its\nearlier decisions that found Fedorenko v. United States,\n449 U. S. 490 (1981), controlling. The Court of Appeals for\nthe Fifth Circuit, in affirming the agency, relied on its\nprecedent following the same reasoning. We hold that the\nBIA and the Court of Appeals misapplied Fedorenko. We\nreverse and remand for the agency to interpret the stat\nute, free from the error, in the first instance.\n                                 I\n   Petitioner in this Court is Daniel Girmai Negusie, a\ndual national of Eritrea and Ethiopia, his father having\nbeen a national of the former and his mother of the latter.\nBorn and educated in Ethiopia, he left there for Eritrea\naround the age of 18 to see his mother and find employ\nment. The year was 1994. After a few months in Eritrea,\nstate officials took custody of petitioner and others when\nthey were attending a movie. He was forced to perform\nhard labor for a month and then was conscripted into the\nmilitary for a time. War broke out between Ethiopia and\nEritrea in 1998, and he was conscripted again.\n   When petitioner refused to fight against Ethiopia, his\nother homeland, the Eritrean Government incarcerated\nhim. Prison guards punished petitioner by beating him\nwith sticks and placing him in the hot sun. He was re\nleased after two years and forced to work as a prison\nguard, a duty he performed on a rotating basis for about\nfour years. It is undisputed that the prisoners he guarded\nwere being persecuted on account of a protected ground—\ni.e., “race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\nsocial group, or political opinion.” 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(42).\nPetitioner testified that he carried a gun, guarded the gate\nto prevent escape, and kept prisoners from taking showers\nand obtaining fresh air. He also guarded prisoners to\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmake sure they stayed in the sun, which he knew was a\nform of punishment. He saw at least one man die after\nbeing in the sun for more than two hours. Petitioner\ntestified that he had not shot at or directly punished any\nprisoner and that he helped prisoners on various occa\nsions. Petitioner escaped from the prison and hid in a\ncontainer, which was loaded on board a ship heading to\nthe United States. Once here he applied for asylum and\nwithholding of removal.\n   In a careful opinion the Immigration Judge, W. Wayne\nStogner, found that petitioner’s testimony, for the most\npart, was credible. He concluded that petitioner assisted\nin persecution by working as an armed guard. The judge\ndetermined that although “there’s no evidence to establish\nthat [petitioner] is a malicious person or that he was an\naggressive person who mistreated the prisoners, . . . the\nvery fact that he helped [the government] in the prison\ncompound where he had reason to know that they were\npersecuted constitutes assisting in the persecution of\nothers and bars [petitioner] from” obtaining asylum or\nwithholding of removal. App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a–17a\n(citing, inter alia, Fedorenko, supra). The judge, however,\ngranted deferral of removal under CAT because petitioner\nwas likely to be tortured if returned to Eritrea.\n   The BIA affirmed the denial of asylum and withholding.\nIt noted petitioner’s role as an armed guard in a facility\nwhere “prisoners were tortured and left to die out in the\nsun . . . on account of a protected ground.” App. to Pet. for\nCert. 6a. The BIA held that “[t]he fact that [petitioner]\nwas compelled to participate as a prison guard, and may\nnot have actively tortured or mistreated anyone, is imma\nterial.” Ibid. That is because “ ‘an alien’s motivation and\nintent are irrelevant to the issue of whether he “assisted”\nin persecution . . . [I]t is the objective effect of an alien’s\nactions which is controlling.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Matter of\nFedorenko, 19 I. & N. Dec. 57, 69 (BIA 1984)). The BIA\n4                   NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nalso affirmed the grant of deferral of removal under CAT.\n  On petition for review the Court of Appeals agreed with\nthe BIA that whether an alien is compelled to assist in\npersecution is immaterial for persecutor-bar purposes.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 2a (citing Fedorenko, 449 U. S., at\n512, n. 34). We granted certiorari. 552 U. S. ___ (2008).\n                             II\n  Consistent with the rule in Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837,\n842–843 (1984), the BIA is entitled to deference in inter\npreting ambiguous provisions of the INA. The question\nhere is whether an alien who was compelled to assist in\npersecution can be eligible for asylum or withholding of\nremoval. We conclude that the BIA misapplied our prece\ndent in Fedorenko as mandating that an alien’s motivation\nand intent are irrelevant to the issue whether an alien\nassisted in persecution. The agency must confront the\nsame question free of this mistaken legal premise.\n                              A\n   It is well settled that “principles of Chevron deference\nare applicable to this statutory scheme.” INS v. Aguirre-\nAguirre, 526 U. S. 415, 424 (1999). Congress has charged\nthe Attorney General with administering the INA, and a\n“ruling by the Attorney General with respect to all ques\ntions of law shall be controlling.” 8 U. S. C. §1103(a)(1).\nJudicial deference in the immigration context is of special\nimportance, for executive officials “exercise especially\nsensitive political functions that implicate questions of\nforeign relations.” INS v. Abudu, 485 U. S. 94, 100 (1988).\nThe Attorney General’s decision to bar an alien who has\nparticipated in persecution “may affect our relations with\n[the alien’s native] country or its neighbors. The judiciary\nis not well positioned to shoulder primary responsibility\nfor assessing the likelihood and importance of such diplo\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmatic repercussions.” Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U. S., at 425.\n   The Attorney General, in turn, has delegated to the BIA\nthe “ ‘discretion and authority conferred upon the Attorney\nGeneral by law’ ” in the course of “ ‘considering and deter\nmining cases before it.’ ” Ibid. (quoting 8 CFR §3.1(d)(1)\n(1998)). As a consequence, “the BIA should be accorded\nChevron deference as it gives ambiguous statutory terms\n‘concrete meaning through a process of case-by-case adju\ndication.’ ” Aguirre-Aguirre, supra, at 425 (quoting INS v.\nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421, 448–449 (1987)). When\nthe BIA has not spoken on “a matter that statutes place\nprimarily in agency hands,” our ordinary rule is to remand\nto “giv[e] the BIA the opportunity to address the matter in\nthe first instance in light of its own experience.” INS v.\nOrlando Ventura, 537 U. S. 12, 16–17 (2002) (per curiam).\n                             B\n   The parties disagree over whether coercion or duress is\nrelevant in determining if an alien assisted or otherwise\nparticipated in persecution. As there is substance to both\ncontentions, we conclude that the statute has an ambigu\nity that the agency should address in the first instance.\n   Petitioner argues that the statute’s plain language\nmakes clear that involuntary acts do not implicate the\npersecutor bar because “ ‘persecution’ ” presumes moral\nblameworthiness. Brief for Petitioner 23–28. He invokes\nprinciples of criminal culpability, concepts of international\nlaw, and the rule of lenity. Id., at 28–45. Those argu\nments may be persuasive in determining whether a par\nticular agency interpretation is reasonable, but they do\nnot demonstrate that the statute is unambiguous. Peti\ntioner all but conceded as much at argument in this Court\nwhen he indicated that the BIA has discretion to construe\nthe duress defense in either a narrow or a broad way. Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 20–24.\n   The Government, on the other hand, asserts that the\n6                  NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute does not allow petitioner’s construction. “The\nstatutory text,” the Government says, “directly answers\nthat question: there is no exception” for conduct that is\ncoerced because Congress did not include one. Brief for\nRespondent 11. We disagree. The silence is not conclu\nsive. The question is whether the statutory text mandates\nthat coerced actions must be deemed assistance in perse\ncution. On that point the statute, in its precise terms, is\nnot explicit. Nor is this a case where it is clear that Con\ngress had an intention on the precise question at issue.\nCf. Cardoza-Fonseca, supra, at 448–449.\n  The Government, like the BIA and the Court of Appeals,\nrelies on Fedorenko to provide the answer. This reliance is\nnot without some basis, as the Court there held that vol\nuntariness was not required with respect to another per\nsecutor bar. 449 U. S., at 512. To the extent, however, the\nGovernment deems Fedorenko to be controlling, it is in\nerror.\n  In Fedorenko, the Court interpreted the Displaced Per\nsons Act of 1948 (DPA), 62 Stat. 1009. The DPA was\nenacted “to enable European refugees driven from their\nhomelands by the [second world] war to emigrate to the\nUnited States without regard to traditional immigration\nquotas.” 449 U. S., at 495. Section 2(b) of the DPA pro\nvides relief to “any displaced person or refugee as defined\nin Annex I of the Constitution of the International Refugee\nOrganization” of the United Nations (IRO Constitution).\n62 Stat. 1009. The IRO Constitution, as codified by Con\ngress, excludes any individual “who can be shown: (a) to\nhave assisted the enemy in persecuting civil populations of\ncountries, Members of the United Nations; or (b) to have\nvoluntarily assisted the enemy forces since the outbreak of\nthe second world war in their operations against the\nUnited Nations.” Annex I, Part II, §2, 62 Stat. 3051–3052.\n  The Fedorenko Court held that “an individual’s service\nas a concentration camp armed guard—whether voluntary\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nor involuntary—made him ineligible for a visa” under\n§2(a) of the IRO Constitution. 449 U. S., at 512. That\nCongress did not adopt a voluntariness requirement for\n§2(a), the Court noted, “is plain from comparing §2(a) with\n§2(b), which excludes only those individuals who ‘voluntar\nily assisted the enemy forces.’ ” Ibid. The Court relied on\nthe principle of statutory construction that “the deliberate\nomission of the word ‘voluntary’ from §2(a) compels the\nconclusion that the statute made all those who assisted in\npersecution of civilians ineligible for visas.” Ibid.\n   Fedorenko does not compel the same conclusion in the\ncase now before us. The textual structure of the statute in\nFedorenko (“voluntary” is in one subsection but not the\nother) is not part of the statutory framework considered\nhere. Congress did not use the word “voluntary” in any\nsubsection of the persecutor bar, so its omission cannot\ncarry the same significance.\n   The difference between the statutory scheme in Fe\ndorenko and the one here is confirmed when we “ ‘look not\nonly to the particular statutory language, but to the design\nof the statute as a whole and to its object and policy.’ ”\nDada v. Mukasey, 554 U. S. 1, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 13)\n(quoting Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U. S. 395, 407\n(1991)). Both statutes were enacted to reflect principles\nset forth in international agreements, but the principles\ndiffer in significant respects.\n   As discussed, Congress enacted the DPA in 1948 as part\nof an international effort to address individuals who were\nforced to leave their homelands during and after the sec\nond World War. Fedorenko, supra, at 495. The DPA\nexcludes those who “voluntarily assisted the enemy forces\nsince the outbreak of the second world war,” 62 Stat. 3052,\nas well as all who “assisted the enemy in persecuting civil\npopulations of countries,” id., at 3051. The latter exclu\nsion clause makes no reference to culpability. The exclu\nsion of even those involved in nonculpable, involuntary\n8                   NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nassistance in Nazi persecution, as an expert testified in\nFedorenko, may be “ ‘[b]ecause the crime against humanity\nthat is involved in the concentration camp puts it into a\ndifferent category.’ ” 449 U. S., at 511, n. 32.\n  The persecutor bar in this case, by contrast, was enacted\nas part of the Refugee Act of 1980. Unlike the DPA, which\nwas enacted to address not just the post war refugee\nproblem but also the Holocaust and its horror, the Refugee\nAct was designed to provide a general rule for the ongoing\ntreatment of all refugees and displaced persons. As this\nCourt has twice recognized, “ ‘one of Congress’ primary\npurposes’ in passing the Refugee Act was to implement the\nprinciples agreed to in the 1967 United Nations Protocol\nRelating to the Status of Refugees, Jan. 31, 1967, 19\nU. S. T. 6224, T. I. A. S. 6577 (1968),” as well as the\n“United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of\nRefugees, 189 U. N. T. S. 150 (July 28, 1951), reprinted in\n19 U. S. T. 6259.” Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U. S., at 427 (quot\ning Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S., at 436–437).\n  These authorities illustrate why Fedorenko, which\naddressed a different statute enacted for a different pur\npose, does not control the BIA’s interpretation of this\npersecutor bar. Whatever weight or relevance these vari\nous authorities may have in interpreting the statute\nshould be considered by the agency in the first instance,\nand by any subsequent reviewing court, after our remand.\n                             C\n   The Government argues that “if there were any ambigu\nity in the text, the Board’s determination that the bar\ncontains no such exception is reasonable and thus control\nling.” Brief for Respondent 11. Whether such an interpre\ntation would be reasonable, and thus owed Chevron defer\nence, is a legitimate question; but it is not now before us.\nThe BIA deemed its interpretation to be mandated by\nFedorenko, and that error prevented it from a full consid\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

[I]t\nis the objective effect of an alien’s actions which is control\nling.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 6a. The rule is based on three\nearlier decisions: Matter of Laipenieks, 18 I. & N. Dec. 433\n(1983); Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I. & N. Dec. 57; and Matter\nof Rodriguez-Majano, 19 I. & N. Dec. 811 (1988).\n   In Matter of Laipenieks, the BIA applied the Court’s\nFedorenko analysis of the DPA to a different postwar\nstatute, which provided for the deportation of anyone\nassociated with the Nazis who “ordered, incited, assisted,\nor otherwise participated” in persecution based on a pro\ntected ground. 8 U. S. C. §1182(a)(3)(E)(i). Finding no\nagency or judicial decision on point, the BIA relied on\nFedorenko. It recognized that the unique structure of the\nFedorenko statute was not present in §1182(a)(3)(E)(i), but\nthe BIA nevertheless adopted wholesale the Fedorenko\nrule: “[A]s in Fedorenko, . . . the plain language of\n[§1182(a)(3)(E)(i)] mandates a literal interpretation, and\nthe omission of an intent element compels the conclusion\nthat [§1182(a)(3)(E)(i)] makes all those who assisted in the\nspecific persecution deportable.” 18 I. & N. Dec., at 464.\nIn other words, “particular motivations or intent . . . is not\na relevant factor.” Ibid.\n   The second decision, Matter of Fedorenko, also dealt\nwith §1182(a)(3)(E)(i), and it involved the same alien\nwhose citizenship was revoked by this Court’s Fedorenko\ndecision. This time the agency sought to deport him.\nFedorenko responded by requesting suspension of deporta\ntion. He argued that, unlike the DPA’s bar on any assis\ntance—voluntary or involuntary—in persecution, see\nFedorenko, 449 U. S., at 512, the text and structure of\n§1182(a)(3)(E)(i) required deportation only of those who\n10                    NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nvoluntarily assisted in persecuting others. The BIA re\njected that distinction, noting that it was foreclosed by\nMatter of Laipenieks: “It may be, as [Fedorenko] argues,\nthat his service at Treblinka was involuntary. . . . We\nneed not resolve the issue, however, because as a matter of\nlaw [Fedorenko’s] motivations for serving as a guard at\nTreblinka are immaterial to the question of his deportabil\nity under” §1182(a)(3)(E)(i). 19 I. & N. Dec., at 69–70.\n   Later, the BIA applied this Court’s Fedorenko rule to\nthe persecutor bar that is at issue in the present case. In\nMatter of Rodriguez-Majano, the BIA granted relief be\ncause the alien’s coerced conduct as a guerrilla was not\npersecution based on a protected ground. 19 I. & N. Dec.,\nat 815–816. Nevertheless, in reaching its conclusion the\nBIA incorporated without additional analysis the Fe\ndorenko rule as applied in Matter of Laipenieks and reiter\nated in Matter of Fedorenko. 19 I. & N. Dec., at 814–815.\nThe BIA reaffirmed that “[t]he participation or assistance\nof an alien in persecution need not be of his own volition to\nbar him from relief.” Id., at 814 (citing Fedorenko, 449\nU. S. 490).\n   Our reading of these decisions confirms that the BIA\nhas not exercised its interpretive authority but, instead,\nhas determined that Fedorenko controls. This mistaken\nassumption stems from a failure to recognize the inappli\ncability of the principle of statutory construction invoked\nin Fedorenko, as well as a failure to appreciate the differ\nences in statutory purpose. The BIA is not bound to apply\nthe Fedorenko rule that motive and intent are irrelevant\nto the persecutor bar at issue in this case. Whether the\nstatute permits such an interpretation based on a differ\nent course of reasoning must be determined in the first\ninstance by the agency.\n                             III\n     Having concluded that the BIA has not yet exercised its\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

This remand rule exists, in part,\nbecause “ambiguities in statutes within an agency’s juris\ndiction to administer are delegations of authority to the\nagency to fill the statutory gap in reasonable fashion.\nFilling these gaps . . . involves difficult policy choices that\nagencies are better equipped to make than courts.” Na\ntional Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X\nInternet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 980 (2005).\n    JUSTICE STEVENS would have the Court provide a defi\nnite answer to the question presented and then remand\nfor further proceedings. That approach, however, is in\ntension with the “ordinary ‘remand’ rule.” Ventura, supra,\nat 18; see also Cajun Elec. Power Cooperative, Inc. v.\nFERC, 924 F. 2d 1132, 1136 (CADC 1991) (opinion for the\nCourt by Silberman, J., joined by R. Ginsburg and Tho\nmas, JJ.) (“[I]f an agency erroneously contends that Con\ngress’ intent has been clearly expressed and has rested on\nthat ground, we remand to require the agency to consider\nthe question afresh in light of the ambiguity we see”).\nThomas is illustrative. There, the agency had not deter\nmined whether a family may constitute a social group for\nthe purposes of refugee status. The Ninth Circuit held\nthat the family can constitute a protected social group and\nthat the particular family at issue did qualify. 547 U. S.,\nat 184–185. The Solicitor General sought review in this\nCourt on “whether the Ninth Circuit erred in holding, in\nthe first instance and without prior resolution of the ques\ntions by the relevant administrative agency, that members\nof a family can and do constitute a particular social group,\nwithin the meaning of the Act.” Id., at 185 (internal quo\n12                  NEGUSIE v.

We\nagreed and summarily reversed. 547 U. S., at 184–185\n    Ventura and Thomas counsel a similar result here.\nBecause of the important differences between the statute\nbefore us and the one at issue in Fedorenko, we find it\nappropriate to remand to the agency for its initial deter\nmination of the statutory interpretation question and its\napplication to this case. The agency’s interpretation of the\nstatutory meaning of “persecution” may be explained by a\nmore comprehensive definition, one designed to elaborate\non the term in anticipation of a wide range of potential\nconduct; and that expanded definition in turn may be\ninfluenced by how practical, or impractical, the standard\nwould be in terms of its application to specific cases.\nThese matters may have relevance in determining\nwhether its statutory interpretation is a permissible one.\n    As the Court said in Ventura and reiterated in Thomas,\n“ ‘[t]he agency can bring its expertise to bear upon the\nmatter; it can evaluate the evidence; it can make an initial\ndetermination; and, in doing so, it can, through informed\ndiscussion and analysis, help a court later determine\nwhether its decision exceeds the leeway that the law\nprovides.’ ” 547 U. S., at 186–187 (quoting Ventura, supra,\nat 17). If the BIA decides to adopt a standard that consid\ners voluntariness to some degree, it may be prudent and\nnecessary for the Immigration Judge to conduct additional\nfactfinding based on the new standard. Those determina\ntions are for the agency to make in the first instance.\n                     *     *    *\n  We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                        It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

ERIC\n     H. HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [March 3, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE ALITO joins, con\ncurring.\n   I agree with the Court that “the statute has an ambigu\nity,” ante, at 5, with respect to whether an alien who was\ncoerced to assist in persecution is barred from obtaining\nasylum in the United States. I agree that the agency is\nentitled to answer that question. Ibid. See Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U. S. 837, 843 (1984). And I agree that a remand is in\norder, to give the agency an opportunity to clarify whether\nits affirmative answer was premised on an erroneous view\nthat this Court’s decision in Fedorenko v. United States,\n449 U. S. 490 (1981), compelled it. Ante, at 11.\n   I would not agree to remand if I did not think that the\nagency has the option of adhering to its decision. The\nmajority appears to leave that question undecided, ante, at\n5 (reserving whether “a particular agency interpretation is\nreasonable”); two Justices forthrightly disagree and would\nrequire the agency to recognize at least some sort of du\nress exception, post, at 7 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part).\n   But good reasons for the agency’s current practice ex\nist—reasons adequate to satisfy the requirement that an\nagency act reasonably in choosing among various possible\nconstructions of an ambiguous statute. The statute does\n2                   NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nnot mandate the rule precluding the duress defense but\ndoes not foreclose it either; the agency is free to retain\nthat rule so long as the choice to do so is soundly rea\nsoned, not based on irrelevant or arbitrary factors (like\nthe Fedorenko precedent).\n   The primary contention to the contrary is, in short, that\nbarring aliens who persecuted under duress would punish\npurely “nonculpable” conduct. That argument suffers from\nat least three unjustified leaps of logic.\n   First, it implicitly adopts a view of “culpability” that is\nneither the only view nor one necessarily applicable here.\nThe culpability of one who harms another under coercion\nis, and has always been, a subject of intense debate, rais\ning profound questions of moral philosophy and individual\nresponsibility. (The so-called “Nuremberg defense” comes\nreadily to mind.) At common law, duress was not an\naccepted defense to intentional killing, see 2 W. LaFave,\nSubstantive Criminal Law §9.7(b), pp. 74–75 (2d ed. 2003);\nand in modern times, some states do not allow it as a\ndefense to lesser crimes, see id., at 81–82, and n. 50.\nNotably, there is no historical support for the duress\ndefense when a soldier follows a military order he knows\nto be unlawful. Id., §9.7(g), at 86; see also, e.g., Axtell’s\nCase, Kel. J. 13, 84 Eng. Rep. 1060 (1660); Prosecutor v.\nErdemović, [1997] 2 ICTY Jud. Rep. 1610, 1635 (Int’l\nCrim. Trib. for Former Yugoslavia). It is therefore far\nfrom clear that precluding a duress defense here would, as\npetitioner alleges, “disregard principles of blame . . . ‘uni\nversal and persistent’ in American law.” Brief for Peti\ntioner 32 (quoting Morissette v. United States, 342 U. S.\n246, 250 (1952)). All of this suggests that those who are\ncoerced to commit wrong are at least sometimes “culpable”\nenough to be treated as criminals.\n   More importantly, this is not a criminal matter. This\nCourt has long understood that an “order of deportation is\nnot a punishment for crime.” Fong Yue Ting v. United\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                      SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nStates, 149 U. S. 698, 730 (1893). Asylum is a benefit\naccorded by grace, not by entitlement, and withholding\nthat benefit from all who have intentionally harmed oth\ners—whether under coercion or not—is not unreasonable.\n   Second, petitioner assumes that the persecutor bar must\nhave been intended merely to punish wrongdoing. But in\nthe context of immigration law, “culpability” as a relevant\nfactor in determining admissibility is only one facet of a\nmore general consideration: desirability. And there may\nwell be reasons to think that those who persecuted others,\neven under duress, would be relatively undesirable as\nimmigrants. If, for example, the asylum laws grant entry\nto those who suffered the persecution, might it not be\nimprudent to also grant entry to the coerced persecutor,\nwho may end up living in the same community as one of\nhis victims? The Nation has a legitimate interest in pre\nventing the importation of ethnic strife from remote parts\nof the world, and the agency may resolve the statutory\nambiguity in a way that safeguards that interest.\n   Finally, even if culpability is the only relevant factor,\nand even if a narrow, criminal-law based view of culpabil\nity is the authoritative one, a bright-line rule excluding all\npersecutors—whether acting under coercion or not—might\nstill be the best way for the agency to effectuate the statu\ntory scheme. See generally Cox & Posner, Second-Order\nStructure of Immigration Law, 59 Stan. L. Rev. 809\n(2007). Immigration judges already face the overwhelm\ning task of attempting to recreate, by a limited number of\nwitnesses speaking through (often poor-quality) transla\ntion, events that took place years ago in foreign, usually\nimpoverished countries. See Dia v. Ashcroft, 353 F. 3d\n228, 261–262 (CA3 2003) (en banc) (Alito, J., concurring in\npart and dissenting in part). Adding on top of that the\nburden of adjudicating claims of duress and coercion,\nwhich are extremely difficult to corroborate and necessar\nily pose questions of degree that require intensely fact\n4                       NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                         SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nbound line-drawing, would increase the already inherently\nhigh risk of error. And the cost of error (viz., allowing\nuncoerced persecutors to remain in the country perma\nnently) might reasonably be viewed by the agency as\nsignificantly greater than the cost of overinclusion under a\nbright-line rule (viz., denial of asylum to some coerced\npersecutors—who might anyway be entitled to protection\nunder the Convention Against Torture, which includes no\nanalogous persecutor bar).\n   It is worth noting that although the agency’s “objective\neffects” approach to the statute would seem to sweep\nbeyond the duress scenario to encompass even an alien\nwho had no idea that his actions would “objectively” assist\nin persecution, see Castañeda-Castillo v. Gonzales, 488\nF. 3d 17, 20 (CA1 2007) (en banc), there is no reason why\nthe agency cannot consider questions of knowledge sepa\nrate and apart from questions of duress. Both can be said\nto relate to the mental state of the persecutor,* but they\npresent different problems which can be grappled with\nseparately.     The agency need not provide an “all\nembracing answer,” ibid., in the present case. It may\nevaluate problems one by one as they arise, and whatever\nit might decide about an unknowing persecutor is irrele\nvant to petitioner, who knew exactly what he was doing.\n   To be clear, I do not endorse any particular rule. It is to\nagency officials, not to the Members of this Court, that\nCongress has given discretion to choose among permissible\ninterpretations of the statute. They deserve to be told\nclearly whether we are serious about allowing them to\nexercise that discretion, or are rather firing a warning\nshot across the bow.\n——————\n  * The rationale for the duress defense, however, is conventionally “not\nthat the defendant . . . somehow loses his mental capacity to commit\nthe crime in question,” but rather that “even though he has done the\nact the crime requires and has the mental state which the crime re\nquires, his conduct . . . is excused.” 2 LaFave, supra, §9.7(a), at 73.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [March 3, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part.\n   The narrow question of statutory construction presented\nby this case is whether the so-called “persecutor bar,” 8\nU. S. C. §§1101(a)(42), 1158(b)(2)(A)(i), 1231(b)(3)(B),\ndisqualifies from asylum or withholding of removal an\nalien whose conduct was coerced or otherwise the product\nof duress. If the answer to that threshold question is “no,”\ncourts should defer to the Attorney General’s evaluation of\nparticular circumstances that may or may not establish\nduress or coercion in individual cases. But the threshold\nquestion the Court addresses today is a “pure question of\nstatutory construction for the courts to decide.” INS v.\nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421, 446 (1987). For that\nreason, while I agree with the Court’s cogent explanation\nof why its misguided decision in Fedorenko v. United\nStates, 449 U. S. 490 (1981), does not govern our interpre­\ntation of the persecutor bar, I would provide a definite\nanswer to the question presented and then remand for\nfurther proceedings.\n                           I\n  Judicial deference to agencies’ views on statutes they\nadminister was not born in Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natu­\nral Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984),\n2                       NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                        Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nnor did the “singularly judicial role of marking the\nboundaries of agency choice,” Young v. Community Nutri­\ntion Institute, 476 U. S. 974, 988 (1986) (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting), die with that case. In the years before Chev­\nron, this Court recognized that statutory interpretation is\na multifaceted enterprise, ranging from a precise construc­\ntion of statutory language to a determination of what\npolicy best effectuates statutory objectives. We accord­\ningly acknowledged that a complete interpretation of a\nstatutory provision might demand both judicial construc­\ntion and administrative explication. E.g., NLRB v. Hearst\nPublications, Inc., 322 U. S. 111 (1944) (construing the\nterm “employee” in the National Labor Relations Act but\ndeferring to the National Labor Relations Board’s finding\nthat newsboys were employees); see Nathanson, Adminis­\ntrative Discretion in the Interpretation of Statutes, 3\nVand. L. Rev. 470 (1950).\n   Chevron adhered to this approach. There, we recognized\nthat the Clean Air Act did not define “stationary source,”\n42 U. S. C. §7502(b)(6) (1982 ed.), but rather implicitly\ndelegated to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\nthe policy question whether States could treat entire\nplants or only their discrete pollution-emitting devices as\nsources of pollution for purposes of the Act’s permit pro­\ngram. Congress left a gap for the agency to fill, and the\nagency brought its expertise, political acuity, and informa­\ntion-gathering abilities to bear in doing so. See Chevron,\n467 U. S., at 865–866.1 In keeping with precedent, see id.,\n——————\n    1 Notably,\n             the EPA cast its activity not as statutory construction but\nas public administration; its rulemaking sought to achieve policy goals,\nsuch as reducing regulatory complexity and promoting plant moderni­\nzation. See 46 Fed. Reg. 50766 (1981). To be sure, the EPA argued\nthat its regulation defining “stationary source” as an entire plant was\npermissible under the Clean Air Act, but the agency treated its rule­\nmaking as a matter of fashioning sound policy, not of discerning the\nmeaning of “stationary source” in the statute.\n                   Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                3\n\n                       Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nat 843–845, and nn. 9, 11–14, our opinion reaffirmed both\nthat “[t]he judiciary is the final authority on issues of\nstatutory construction,” id., at 843, n. 9, and that courts\nshould defer to an agency’s reasonable formulation of\npolicy in response to an explicit or implicit congressional\ndelegation of authority. The Chevron framework thus\naccounts for the different institutional competencies of\nagencies and courts: Courts are expert at statutory con­\nstruction, while agencies are expert at statutory imple­\nmentation. That the distinction can be subtle does not\nlessen its importance.\n   In the 25 years since Chevron was decided, this Court\nhas continued to recognize that courts and agencies play\ncomplementary roles in the project of statutory interpreta­\ntion. We have repeatedly held that “ambiguities in stat­\nutes within an agency’s jurisdiction to administer are\ndelegations of authority to the agency to fill the statutory\ngap in reasonable fashion.” National Cable & Telecom­\nmunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S.\n967, 980 (2005). But even when confronted with a statute\nthat involves a degree of ambiguity—as most statutes do—\nwe have not abdicated our judicial role. The fact that\nCongress has left a gap for the agency to fill means that\ncourts should defer to the agency’s reasonable gap-filling\ndecisions, not that courts should cease to mark the bounds\nof delegated agency choice.2\n   In cases involving agency adjudication, we have some­\ntimes described the court’s role as deciding pure questions\nof statutory construction and the agency’s role as applying\nlaw to fact. See, e.g., Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421;\nNLRB v. Food & Commercial Workers, 484 U. S. 112\n——————\n  2 Cf. United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 236–238 (2001);\n\nBarnhart v. Walton, 535 U. S. 212, 222 (2002) (noting that Mead\n“indicated that whether a court should give [Chevron] deference de­\npends in significant part upon the interpretive method used and the\nnature of the question at issue”).\n4                       NEGUSIE v.

While this phrasing is peculiar to\nthe adjudicatory context, the principle applies to Chevron’s\ndomain more broadly. In the context of agency rulemak­\ning, for instance, we might distinguish between pure\nquestions of statutory interpretation and policymaking, or\nbetween central legal issues and interstitial questions.\nSee Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U. S. 212, 222 (2002).3 The\nlabel is immaterial. What matters is the principle: Cer­\ntain aspects of statutory interpretation remain within the\npurview of the courts, even when the statute is not en­\ntirely clear, while others are properly understood as dele­\ngated by Congress to an expert and accountable adminis­\ntrative body. Statutory language may thus admit of both\njudicial construction and agency exposition.\n                             II\n   Two of this Court’s cases construing the Immigration\nand Nationality Act (INA), 66 Stat. 166, 8 U. S. C. §1101\net seq., illustrate the proper division of responsibility\nbetween courts and agencies and highlight when Chevron\ndeference is appropriate and when it is not. In Cardoza-\nFonseca, the question was whether the standard of INA\n§243(h), 8 U. S. C. §1253(h) (1982 ed.), which requires an\nalien to show that she is more likely than not to be subject\nto persecution if she is deported, also governs applications\nfor asylum under §208(a), 8 U.

S., at 446. We therefore did not\ndefer to the BIA’s interpretation of the two standards as\nequivalent but instead employed traditional tools of statu­\ntory construction and “concluded that Congress did not\nintend the two standards to be identical.” Ibid.4\n   Importantly, we recognized that Chevron deference need\nnot be an all-or-nothing venture. Even after the question\nof the standards’ equivalency was resolved, there re­\nmained the question of their application. We explained,\n“The narrow legal question whether the two standards are\nthe same is, of course, quite different from the question of\ninterpretation that arises in each case in which the agency\nis required to apply either or both standards to a particu­\nlar set of facts.” 480 U.

S., at 455\n(opinion concurring in judgment). The majority rejected JUSTICE\nSCALIA’s argument, recognizing that Chevron involved an agency’s\ncomplex policy judgment about how to fill a statutory gap, not a pure\nquestion of statutory construction.

(quoting Chevron, 467 U. S., at\n843, in turn quoting Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U. S. 199, 231\n(1974)).\n  In INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U. S. 415 (1999), the\nCourt encountered just the type of agency decision Car­\ndoza-Fonseca indicated would warrant Chevron deference.\nThe BIA had denied withholding of deportation because it\nfound that the respondent had “committed a serious non­\npolitical crime” before he entered the United States, 8\nU. S. C. §1253(h)(2)(C) (1994 ed.). The Court of Appeals\nreversed the agency’s decision and required it to supple­\nment its balancing test with specific additional factors\n(such as whether the respondent’s acts were grossly out of\nproportion to their objective and whether the acts were\npolitically necessary and successful).\n  We reversed the Court of Appeals, concluding that\nChevron deference should be accorded to the BIA “as it\ngives ambiguous statutory terms ‘concrete meaning\nthrough a process of case-by-case adjudication.’ ” 526 U. S.,\nat 425 (quoting Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S., at 448). The\nBIA’s formulation of a test to apply the statutory standard\nin individual cases and its application of that test in re­\nspondent’s case were precisely the sort of agency actions\nthat merited judicial deference.\n                           III\n  The threshold question the Court addresses today is the\nkind of “pure question of statutory construction for the\ncourts to decide” that we answered in Cardoza-Fonseca,\nid., at 446, rather than a fact-intensive question of the\nkind we addressed in Aguirre-Aguirre.

Although I agree in full with the Court’s con­\nclusion that the majority opinion in Fedorenko does not\ngovern our interpretation of the persecutor bar, the differ­\nences the Court highlights between the Displaced Persons\nAct of 1948 (DPA), 62 Stat. 1009, and the Refugee Act of\n1980, 94 Stat. 102, only strengthen my conclusion that\nvoluntary assistance in persecution is required and that\nduress and coercion vitiate voluntariness.\n  The Fedorenko Court’s construction of the DPA threat­\nened to exclude from the United States concentration\ncamp prisoners who were forced to assist the Nazis in the\n——————\n    5 The majority suggests that this approach is inconsistent with the\n\n“ ‘ordinary “remand” rule’ ” articulated in Gonzales v.

But those cases involved exactly\nthe sort of application of law to fact that is within the agency’s purview.\nIn Thomas, the Court of Appeals decided that the family at issue “fell\nwithin the scope of the statutory term ‘particular social group.’ ” 547\nU. S., at 185. We noted that the BIA had not considered this question,\nwhich “require[d] determining the facts and deciding whether the facts\nas found f[e]ll within a statutory term.” Id., at 186. Accordingly, we\nheld that the court should have remanded to the agency. Similarly, in\nVentura, the Court of Appeals addressed an issue that the BIA had not\nreached and concluded that conditions in Guatemala had so improved\nthat no realistic threat of persecution currently existed. The Govern­\nment argued that the court had not respected “the BIA’s role as fact­\nfinder,” 537 U. S., at 16, and we agreed, reversing the court’s judgment\ninsofar as it had not remanded to the agency.\n8                      NEGUSIE v.

In my view, this construc­\ntion was insupportable—the DPA’s exclusion of persons\nwho “assisted the enemy in persecuting civil populations,”\nConstitution of the International Refugee Organization,\nAnnex I, Part II, §2(a), 62 Stat. 3051, did not extend to\nconcentration camp prisoners who did so involuntarily.\nThese prisoners were victims, not persecutors.\n   Without an exception for involuntary action, the Refu­\ngee Act’s bar would similarly treat entire classes of victims\nas persecutors. The Act does not support such a reading.\nThe language of the persecutor bar is most naturally read\nto denote culpable conduct, and this reading is powerfully\nsupported by the statutory context and legislative history.\n   As this Court has previously recognized—and as the\nmajority acknowledges again today—Congress passed the\nRefugee Act to implement the United Nations Convention\nRelating to the Status of Refugees, 189 U. N. T. S. 150\n(July 28, 1951) (hereinafter Convention), reprinted in 19\nU. S. T. 6259, and the 1967 United Nations Protocol Relat­\ning to the Status of Refugees, Jan. 31, 1967, [1968] 19\nU. S. T. 6223, T. I. A. S. No. 6577 (hereinafter Protocol).\nThese treaties place a mandatory obligation on signatory\nstates not to “expel or return (‘refouler’) a refugee in any\nmanner whatsoever to . . . territories where his life or\nfreedom would be threatened on account of his race, relig­\nion, nationality, membership of a particular social group\nor political opinion.” Convention, Art. 33(1), 19 U.

Indeed, the United Na­\ntions Handbook, to which the Court has looked for guid­\nance in the past, states that all relevant factors, including\n“mitigating circumstances,” must be considered in deter­\nmining whether an alien’s acts are of a “criminal nature”\nas contemplated by Article 1(F).

The\nCAT prohibits a state party from returning any person to a country\nwhere there is substantial reason to believe he might be tortured, but\nits definition of torture covers a narrower class of harms, imposed by a\nnarrower class of actors, than the asylum and witholding of removal\nprovisions.

The agency would retain the\nability, for instance, to define duress and coercion; to\ndetermine whether or not a balancing test should be em­\nployed; and, of course, to decide whether any individual\nasylum-seeker’s acts were covered by the persecutor bar.\nThose are the sorts of questions suited to the agency’s\nunique competencies in administering the INA.

ERIC\n     H. HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [March 3, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.\n   The “persecutor bar” in the Immigration and National­\nity Act (INA) denies asylum and the withholding of re­\nmoval to any alien who has “ordered, incited, assisted, or\notherwise participated in the persecution of any person on\naccount of race, religion, nationality, membership in a\nparticular social group, or political opinion.” 8 U. S. C.\n§§1101(a)(42), 1158(b)(2)(A), 1231(b)(3)(B)(i). The Board\nof Immigration Appeals (BIA), principally relying on this\nCourt’s decision in Fedorenko v. United States, 449 U. S.\n490 (1981), held that the statute does not require that the\npersecution be voluntarily inflicted. The Court of Appeals\nfor the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\n   According to the Court, Fedorenko, which construed the\nsimilar text of a persecution bar in the Displaced Persons\nAct of 1948 (DPA), is largely irrelevant to the question\npresented here. See ante, at 6–8, 9–10; see also ante, at 2\n(SCALIA, J., concurring). The majority further holds that\nthe INA is ambiguous as to “whether coercion or duress is\nrelevant in determining if an alien assisted or otherwise\nparticipated in persecution” and that the agency, there­\nfore, should interpret the statute in the first instance to\ndetermine whether it reasonably can be read to include a\nvoluntariness requirement. Ante, at 5, 10–12; see also\nante, at 1 (SCALIA, J., concurring). I disagree with both of\n2                   NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthese conclusions. Because the INA unambiguously pre­\ncludes any inquiry into whether the persecutor acted\nvoluntarily, i.e., free from coercion or duress, I would\naffirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. I respectfully\ndissent.\n                               I\n   Petitioner Daniel Girmai Negusie testified to the Immi­\ngration Judge (IJ) that he was forced to work as an armed\nguard for four years at an Eritrean prison camp where\nprisoners were persecuted because of their religious be­\nliefs. According to petitioner, part of his job was “to firmly\ncontrol the prisoners, to punish the prisoners, too, by\nexposing them” to the extreme heat of the African sun.\nApp. 58. The guards “would . . . hold [a] stick [with] their\nhand” and follow prisoners who were being forced to “roll\non the ground in the sun.” Id., at 23. Because “it was\nextremely hot,” prisoners would quickly “get tired and\n[feel] shortness of breath and stop” rolling. Id., at 24.\nThey were then beaten. Prisoners typically could not\nsurvive this punishment for more than two hours. Indeed,\nat least one prisoner died from sun exposure while peti­\ntioner stood guard. See ante, at 3 (majority opinion).\n   Petitioner testified that, as a guard, he prevented the\nprisoners from showering and forbade them from leaving\ntheir rooms for fresh air. This form of punishment was\nparticularly severe because the prisons were “built from\nstone and bricks” with “no cooling system, no ventilation,\nno windows,” and intolerable heat. App. 20, 30. Petitioner\nalso prevented prisoner escapes, for which the punishment\nwas forced sun exposure. And, although petitioner never\nused “electricity to torture” prisoners, he was aware that\nhis supervisor did. Id., at 61–62.\n   But petitioner, who had converted to Protestantism\nwhen he was confined as a prisoner at the camp, also\ntestified that he did not want to persecute any of the\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

On one occasion, he gave water to a prisoner who\nwas dying from sun exposure. On another occasion, he let\nfemale prisoners take showers after they had been denied\nthat privilege “for a long time.” Id., at 37. Petitioner also\noccasionally allowed some of the prisoners to “go outside\nduring the night and during the evenings and . . . refresh\nthemselves in the fresh air.” Id., at 37–38.\n   After four years as a prison guard, petitioner deserted\nhis post, swam to a shipping container, and hid inside.\nSee ante, at 3 (majority opinion). The container arrived in\nthe United States with petitioner inside on December 20,\n2004. Petitioner applied for asylum and the withholding\nof removal under the INA, 8 U. S. C. §1101 et seq. He also\napplied for protection under the Convention Against Tor­\nture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment\nor Punishment (CAT), under which it is “the policy of the\nUnited States not to expel, extradite, or otherwise effect\nthe involuntary return of any person to a country in which\nthere are substantial grounds for believing the person\nwould be in danger of being subjected to torture.” Foreign\nAffairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, §2242(a),\n112 Stat. 2681–822, note following 8 U. S. C. §1231, p. 263\n(United States Policy with Respect to Involuntary Return\nof Persons in Danger of Subjection to Torture (hereinafter\nCAT Policy)). See also CAT, Dec. 10, 1984, S. Treaty Doc.\nNo. 100–20, 1465 U. N. T. S. 85. Petitioner feared that, if\nreturned to Eritrea, he would “be executed” because he\nhad converted to Protestantism and deserted his military\npost. App. 65, 68.\n   The INA provides the Executive with the discretion to\ngrant asylum to aliens that are “unable or unwilling” to\nreturn to their home country “because of persecution or a\nwell-founded fear of persecution on account of race, relig­\nion, nationality, membership in a particular social group,\n4                       NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nor political opinion.”           8 U. S. C. §§1101(a)(42)(A),\n1158(b)(1). The INA also requires the Executive to with­\nhold removal of aliens to a country in which there is a\n“clear probability” that their “life or freedom would be\nthreatened” because of their “race, religion, nationality,\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opin­\nion.” §1231(b)(3)(A). However, the INA prohibits the\nExecutive from granting asylum or withholding removal if\nan alien “ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise partici­\npated in the persecution” of any person on account of\n“race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\nsocial group, or political opinion.” §1158(b)(2)(A)(i) (asy­\nlum); §1231(b)(3)(B) (withholding of removal). Nonethe­\nless, in light of the CAT’s requirement that “[n]o State\nParty shall . . . return . . . a person to another State where\nthere are substantial grounds for believing that he would\nbe in danger of being subjected to torture,” Art. 3, S.\nTreaty Doc. No. 100–20, at 20, regulations implementing\nthat convention provide “deferral of removal” to aliens\nsubject to the INA persecutor bar who would more likely\nthan not be tortured if removed to their home country.1 8\nCFR §§1208.16(c)(4), (d)(2), 1208.17(a) (2008); see also\nCAT Policy (b), at 263 (requiring federal agencies to “pre­\nscribe regulations to implement the obligations of the\nUnited States under Article 3 of the [CAT], subject to any\nreservations, understandings, declarations, and provisos\n——————\n    1 “Deferralof removal” was created to accommodate Congress’ direc­\ntion to exclude those who fall within the INA persecutor bar “[t]o the\nmaximum extent consistent with the obligations of the United States\nunder the [CAT]” to not return an alien to a country in which he or she\nwill be tortured.

The BIA affirmed. In their view, petitioner’s\nconduct objectively qualified as assistance or participation\nin the persecution of others based on religion. See ante, at\n3 (majority opinion). Relying on Fedorenko, the IJ and\nBIA found that even if petitioner was “compelled to par­\nticipate as a prison guard” against his wishes, his “motiva­\ntion and intent are irrelevant to the issue of whether he\n‘assisted’ in persecution.” Ibid. (some internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Therefore, petitioner was ineligible for\nasylum or the withholding of removal under the INA. The\nIJ and BIA agreed, however, that petitioner qualified for\ndeferral of removal because it is “more likely than not that\nhe would be tortured” if returned to Eritrea given that its\n“government has used deadly force and threatened to use\ndeadly force against deserters.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 7a–\n8a, 20a, 19a.

As the majority acknowledges, see ante,\nat 5–6, the text of the INA’s persecutor bar neither in­\ncludes the term “voluntary” nor contains an exception for\ninvoluntary, coerced conduct. The statute instead applies\nto any alien “who ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise\nparticipated in the persecution of any person” on account\nof a protected ground. §§1101(a)(42), 1158(b)(2)(A)(i),\n1231(b)(3)(B)(i).\n  The statute’s key terms also do not imply any voluntari­\nness requirement for persecution. Under the ordinary\nmeaning of the term “persecution” at the time of the stat­\nute’s enactment in 1980 and its reenactment in 1996, the\nact of persecution alone is sufficient to classify one’s con­\nduct as persecution. See Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate\nDictionary 877 (1991) (hereinafter Webster’s Ninth) (defin­\ning “persecution” as “the act or practice of persecuting esp.\nthose who differ in origin, religion, or social outlook”); see\nalso Webster’s New Collegiate Dictionary 855 (1975) (here­\ninafter Webster’s) (same). The term itself includes no\nintrinsic mens rea requirement. As a result, an individual\ncan “persecute”—meaning “harass in a manner designed\nto injure, grieve, or afflict”—without having designed the\nact or intended for injury, grief, or affliction to occur.\nWebster’s Ninth 877; see also Webster’s 855 (same).\n  The persecutor bar’s inclusion of those who “assist” or\n“participate” confirms that it does not include a voluntari­\nness requirement. The term “assist” is defined as “to give\nsupport or aid,” Webster’s Ninth 109, or “to help,” Oxford\nAmerican Dictionary 36 (1980) (hereinafter Oxford). See\nalso Black’s Law Dictionary 111 (5th ed. 1979) (hereinaf­\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)              7\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nter Black’s) (defining “assist” as “[t]o help; aid; succor; lend\ncountenance or encouragement to; participate in as an\nauxiliary”). And “participate” means simply “to take part,”\nWebster’s Ninth 858, or “to have a share, to take part in\nsomething,” Oxford 487; see also Black’s 1007 (defining\n“participate” as “[t]o receive or have a part or share of; to\npartake of; experience in common with others; to have or\nenjoy a part or share in common with others”). Accord­\ningly, this Court has concluded that the ordinary mean­\nings of “assist” and “participate” do not “connote volun­\ntariness.” Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524\nU. S. 206, 211 (1998) (participate); see also Fedorenko, 449\nU. S., at 512 (assist). These are “terms and concepts of\nbreadth,” Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 21–22\n(1983), that require only that an individual take “some\npart in” an activity, or help it to occur in some way. Reves\nv. Ernst & Young, 507 U. S. 170, 178–179 (1993) (empha­\nsis in original). Even if participation or assistance is\ncoerced, it remains participation or assistance just the\nsame.\n                             B\n  In addition to the particular statutory section of the INA\nbefore the Court, “the language and design of the statute\nas a whole” is instructive in determining the provision’s\nplain meaning. K mart Corp., supra, at 291; see also\nAmoco Production Co. v. Gambell, 480 U. S. 531, 552–553\n(1987). Here, the INA’s design and structure buttress the\nconclusion that the persecutor bar applies irrespective of\nvoluntariness.\n  First, Congress has evidenced its ability to both specifi­\ncally require voluntary conduct and explicitly exclude\ninvoluntary conduct in other provisions of the INA. See\ninfra, at 15–16. For example, Congress has barred admis­\nsion to the United States of totalitarian party members\nunless their membership was “involuntary,” 8 U. S. C.\n8                   NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n§1182(a)(3)(D)(ii), and it has provided for the termination\nof asylum when an alien “has voluntarily availed himself\nor herself” of another country’s protections, §1158(c)(2)(D).\n“[W]here Congress includes particular language in one\nsection of a statute but omits it in another section of the\nsame Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts\nintentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or\nexclusion.” Russello, supra, at 23 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); see, e.g., Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co.,\n534 U. S. 438, 452–454 (2002). The absence of a volun­\ntariness requirement in the INA persecutor bar is no\nexception.\n   Second, federal immigration law provides calibrated\nremedies, which include partial refuge for specified aliens\nwho have both suffered from and inflicted persecution.\nThose who have been persecuted and have not engaged in\npersecution may receive both asylum and the withholding\nof removal. §§1231(b)(3)(A), 1158(b)(1)(A). Those at the\nother end of the spectrum, who have not been persecuted\nbut have persecuted others, may not receive either asylum\nor the withholding of removal. §§1231(b)(3)(B)(i),\n1158(b)(2)(A)(i). And finally, for many individuals who\n(like petitioner) have both persecuted others and been\npersecuted, the scheme provides temporary refuge; they\nwill receive deferral of removal under the CAT if they will\nface torture upon their return to their home country. CAT\nPolicy (a), at 263; see also 8 CFR §§1208.13(a),\n1208.16(d)(2).\n   Where “Congress has enacted a comprehensive scheme\nand has deliberately targeted specific problems with spe­\ncific solutions,” courts should not read one part of the\nlegislative regime (the INA) to provide a different, and\nconflicting, solution to a problem that has already been\nspecifically addressed elsewhere in the federal immigra­\ntion regime (regulations implementing the CAT). Varity\nCorp. v. Howe, 516 U. S. 489, 519 (1996) (THOMAS, J.,\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

Federal law provides\nonly partial protection to a victim of persecution who has\nalso engaged in persecution, voluntarily or not. There\nsimply is no justification for writing into the INA’s perse­\ncutor bar the greater protections of asylum and the with­\nholding of removal for individuals who were coerced into\nengaging in persecution. That is, the “assumption of\ninadvertent omission” of a voluntariness requirement in\nthe INA “is rendered especially suspect upon close consid­\neration of [a statute’s] interlocking, interrelated, and\ninterdependent remedial scheme” that addresses the\nspecific problem at issue in a conflicting way. Massachu\nsetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U. S. 134, 146–147\n(1985).2\n                             C\n   Finally, Congress is aware of a judicial interpretation of\nstatutory language and “adopt[s] that interpretation when\nit re-enacts a statute without change.” Lorillard v.

Mandel, 408 U. S. 753,\n766, 767 (1972) (quoting Galvan v. Press, 347 U. S. 522, 531–532\n(1954)). In fact, “over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of\nCongress more complete than it is over” the decision of Congress to\nadmit or to exclude aliens. Oceanic Steam Nav. Co. v. Stranahan, 214\nU. S. 320, 339 (1909). Courts therefore must enforce the immigration\npolicy decision reflected in a statute’s plain terms, even if Congress has\nchosen “to forbid the entrance of foreigners within its dominions”\naltogether, Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U. S. 698, 705 (1893).\nLikewise, here, where Congress has made a judgment about which\npersons to admit and exclude from the country, it is not for this Court\nto question the wisdom of that choice.\n10                  NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ned. 2008). Here, the statutory and decisional backdrop\nagainst which Congress enacted the INA’s persecutor bar\ncounsels against grafting a voluntariness requirement\nonto the statute.\n   When Congress enacted the INA’s persecutor bar, it\nessentially retained the language used in similar prede­\ncessor statutes. Under the 1948 DPA persecutor bar,\nentry was denied to all who “ ‘assisted the enemy in perse­\ncuting civil[ians].’ ” Fedorenko, 449 U. S., at 495 (quoting\n62 Stat. 3051). In 1950, Congress added a second persecu­\ntor bar to the DPA that applied “to any person who advo­\ncated or assisted in the persecution of any person because\nof race, religion, or national origin.” §13, 64 Stat. 227. In\nthe years that followed, Congress continued to use this\nsame broad language in denying asylum to specific catego­\nries of persecutors. See, e.g., §105, 91 Stat. 1224 (denying\npermanent residence to aliens from Vietnam, Laos, and\nCambodia “who ordered, assisted, or otherwise partici­\npated in the persecution of any person because of race,\nreligion, or political opinion”); 8 U. S. C. §§1182(a)(3)(E),\n1227(a)(4)(D)) (authorizing the exclusion of anyone who\nhad been associated with Nazi forces and had “ordered,\nincited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecu­\ntion of any person because of race, religion, national ori­\ngin, or political opinion”); §14(a), 67 Stat. 406 (imposing\npersecutor bar on “any person who personally advocated or\nassisted in the persecution of . . . [a] group of persons\nbecause of race, religion, or national origin”).\n   Congress then enacted the INA bar in 1980. This stat­\nute comprehensively labeled as a persecutor “any person\nwho ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in\nthe persecution of any person on account of race, religion,\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or\npolitical opinion.” §201(a), 94 Stat. 102–103. Congress\nreenacted the INA’s persecutor bar in 1996 and retained\nits breadth. See Illegal Immigration Reform and Immi­\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

By the time of the 1996 reen­\nactment, this Court had specifically interpreted the plain\nlanguage of the predecessor bars to apply regardless of the\nvoluntariness of a persecutor’s conduct. See Fedorenko,\nsupra, at 512 (1948 DPA bar); see also United States v.\nKoreh, 59 F. 3d 431, 439 (CA3 1995) (1950 DPA bar);\nUnited States v. Schmidt, 923 F. 2d 1253, 1258 (CA7 1991)\n(1948 DPA bar); Maikovskis v. INS, 773 F. 2d 435, 445–\n446 (CA2 1985) (8 U. S. C. §1251(a)(19) (1982 ed.), trans­\nferred to §1227(a)(4)(D) (2006 ed.)). In particular, this\nCourt had held that the phrase in the 1948 DPA bar,\n“assisted the enemy in persecuting civil[ians],” contained\nno “ ‘involuntary assistance’ exception.” Fedorenko, 449\nU. S., at 512. Rather, the statute’s “plain language” made\nclear that “an individual’s service as a concentration camp\narmed guard—whether voluntary or involuntary—made\nhim ineligible for a visa.” Ibid.\n  In light of this legal backdrop, Congress’ decisions in\n1980 and 1996 to retain a persecutor bar that broadly\napplies to anyone who “assisted, or otherwise participated\nin the persecution” of any person, §§1158(b)(2)(A)(i),\n1231(b)(3)(B), is significant evidence that Congress did not\nintend to include any involuntariness exception in the INA\nbar. This Court must assume, absent textual proof to the\ncontrary, that Congress was aware of the Fedorenko deci­\nsion when it reenacted the persecutor bar and thus\n“adopt[ed] that interpretation when it re-enact[ed the]\nstatute without change,” Lorillard, supra, at 580.\n                           D\n  In sum, the INA’s persecutor bar does not require that\n12                       NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nassistance or participation in persecution be voluntary or\nuncoerced to fall within the statute’s reach. It instead\n“mandates precisely” what it says: “[A]n individual’s ser­\nvice as a [prison] camp armed guard—whether voluntary\nor involuntary—ma[kes] him ineligible for” asylum or\nwithholding of removal if the guard’s service involved\nassistance or participation in the persecution of another\nperson on account of a protected ground. Fedorenko,\nsupra, at 512. Here, it is undisputed that petitioner\nserved at a prison camp where guards persecuted prison­\ners because of their religious beliefs. See ante, at 2–3\n(majority opinion). It also is undisputed that petitioner\ncarried out the persecution by preventing prisoners from\nescaping and by standing guard while at least one pris­\noner died from sun exposure. Ibid. Petitioner, therefore,\n“assisted, or otherwise participated” in persecution and\nthus is statutorily disqualified from receiving asylum or\nwithholding of removal under the INA. 3\n——————\n  3 JUSTICE STEVENS also finds the language of the INA’s persecutor bar\n“plain,” but concludes that it must incorporate a culpability require­\nment because the statute applies to those whose “acts are of a ‘criminal\nnature.’ ” See ante, at 7, 9 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in\npart). I disagree. The decision to admit an alien is a matter of legisla­\ntive grace, see n. 2, supra, for which judicial review has been “consis­\ntently classified” as civil in nature, Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342\nU. S. 580, 594 (1952); see also Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, 720\n(2001) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (explaining that “ ‘an alien seeking\ninitial admission to the United States requests a privilege and has no\nconstitutional rights regarding his application, for the power to admit\nor exclude aliens is a sovereign prerogative’ ” (quoting Landon v.\nPlasencia, 459 U. S. 21, 32 (1982))). There is no warrant to read\ncriminal-law requirements into a statute that is “nonpunitive in pur­\npose and effect.” Zadvydas, supra, at 690. Further, the conclusory\npronouncement in the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner\nfor Refugees’ Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining\nRefugee Status ¶162 (reedited Jan. 1992), that “it has to be assumed,\nalthough this is not specifically stated, that the acts covered by the\npresent clause must also be of a criminal nature,” is insufficient to\nrequire criminal proof to deny withholding of removal, contra, ante, at\n                   Cite as: 555 U.

INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 329 (2001) (SCALIA,\nJ., dissenting).\n   The majority principally finds ambiguity in the statu­\ntory text because it does not include either the word “vol­\nuntary” or the word “involuntary.” See ante, at 7. But a\nstatute cannot be deemed ambiguous until the court “ex­\nhaust[s] the aid of the ‘traditional tools of statutory con­\nstruction’ ” and determines that Congress did not resolve\nthe issue under consideration. Clark v. Martinez, 543\nU. S. 371, 402 (2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (quoting\nChevron, 467 U. S., at 843, n. 9). Deeming a statute with\nbroad terms to be ambiguous for that reason alone essen­\ntially requires Congress either to obey a judicially imposed\nclear-statement rule or accept the risk that the courts may\nrefuse to give full effect to a statute’s plain meaning in the\nname of Chevron deference. Not every difficult question of\nstatutory construction amounts to a statutory gap for a\nfederal agency to fill. See ante, at 1–4 (opinion of\nSTEVENS, J.). And the Court should not, “in the name of\ndeference, abdicate its responsibility to interpret a stat­\nute” simply because it requires some effort. Global Cross\ning Telecommunications, Inc. v. Metrophones Telecommu\nnications, Inc., 550 U. S. 45, 77 (2007) (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting).\n—————— \n\n9–10 (opinion of STEVENS, J.).

HOLDER\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n    The majority makes no attempt to apply the “traditional\ntools of statutory construction” to the persecutor bar be­\nfore retreating to ambiguity. See ante, at 5–6. Rather, it\nmerely observes that Congress could have spoken more\ndirectly to the issue, which it finds sufficient to render the\nstatute ambiguous on this score. Ante, at 6. But the\nabsence of a phrase specifying that the provision applies to\nboth involuntary and voluntary conduct is not definitive\nproof of ambiguity. It is certainly correct that Congress\n“ ‘could have spoken in clearer terms,’ ” Clark, 543 U. S., at\n402 (THOMAS, J., dissenting), as it almost always can in\nany statute. However, this “proves nothing” in evaluating\nwhether the statute is ambiguous. Ibid. The question\nbefore the Court instead is whether Congress has provided\nan unambiguous answer in the plain language that it\nchose to use. Here, for the reasons just explained, the\ntraditional tools of statutory interpretation show with\n“utmost clarity,” St. Cyr, supra, at 329, that the statute\napplies regardless of the voluntariness of the alien who\nparticipates or assists in persecution.4\n    The majority also finds ambiguity based on differences\nbetween the INA and the DPA statutory bar considered in\nFedorenko. In particular, the majority points to the Fe\ndorenko Court’s reliance on a second part of the DPA\npersecutor bar, which applied to those who “ ‘voluntarily\n——————\n  4 Because this Court should not delegate the interpretation of the\n\npersecutor bar’s plain meaning to a federal agency, see Board of Gover\nnors, FRS v. Dimension Financial Corp., 474 U. S. 361, 368 (1986), it is\nlargely irrelevant whether the BIA properly relied on Fedorenko v.\nUnited States, 449 U. S. 490 (1981), in interpreting the statute, see\nante, at 9–11 (majority opinion); ante, at 2 (SCALIA, J., concurring). In\nany event, the BIA’s construction of the INA’s persecutor bar correctly\nreflected the text of the provision. There is no reason to remand the\nquestion to the agency when only one construction of the statute is\npermissible and the agency’s original decision adopted that proper\nconstruction. See National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v.\nBrand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 982–985 (2005).\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

S., at 495, and n. 3 (quoting\n62 Stat. 3052; emphasis added). The Court noted that\n“[u]nder traditional principles of statutory construction,\nthe deliberate omission of the word ‘voluntary’ from §2(a),”\nwhich addressed the assistance of persecution—but not\nfrom §2(b)—“compel[led] the conclusion that the statute\nmade all those who assisted in the persecution of civilians\nineligible for visas.” Id., at 512. According to the major­\nity, because the INA persecutor bar, unlike the DPA bar,\ndoes not include a provision limited by the word “voluntar­\nily” adjacent to the provision that is not so limited, the\nabsence of the adverb here cannot carry the significance\ngiven it in Fedorenko. See ante, at 7.\n   The majority’s reasoning is flawed. The mere fact that\nthe INA’s persecutor bar is not accompanied by a\nneighboring provision containing the word “voluntarily”\ndoes not negate the significance of the term’s absence\nwhen other INA provisions are explicitly limited to actions\nundertaken voluntarily. As noted above, see supra, at 7,\nthe INA imposes a voluntariness requirement in a host of\nstatutory provisions, see, e.g., 8 U. S. C. §1158(c)(2)(D)\n(terminating asylum when alien has “voluntarily” availed\nhimself     of    the    protection    of    his   country);\n§§1182(a)(3)(D)(i)–(ii) (denying admission and naturaliza­\ntion to those who have been members of, or affiliated with,\n“the Communist or any other totalitarian party” unless\nthat membership or affiliation was “involuntary”);\n§1182(d)(3)(B)(i) (denying admission to those who have\n“voluntarily and knowingly” engaged in, endorsed, es­\npoused, or persuaded others to endorse, espouse, or sup­\nport terrorist activity); §1229c(a)(1) (allowing an alien to\n“voluntarily” depart the United States); §§1424(a), (d)\n(precluding naturalization for members of certain totali­\ntarian parties, unless membership was “involuntary”);\n§1481(a) (providing for loss of nationality by “voluntarily”\n16                      NEGUSIE v.

That Congress’ explicit\nreferences to voluntariness appear in other sections of this\nparticular statutory scheme, rather than in subsections of\n§§1158 or 1231, is immaterial. Cf. Rusello, 464 U. S., at\n23; Barnhart, 534 U. S., at 452–454. And the fact that\nCongress, in the course of making structural revisions to\nthe statutory regime, eliminated the specific dichotomy\nthe Court noted in Fedorenko does not undermine the\ncritical point: The INA expressly includes a voluntariness\nrequirement in several places but does not impose such a\nrequirement in the persecution bar. Thus, the omission of\nthe word “voluntarily” from the persecutor bar in the INA\nis just as conclusive as its omission from the persecutor\nbar in the DPA. With respect to both statutes, the delib­\nerate omission “compels the conclusion that the statute\nmade all those who assisted in the persecution of civilians\nineligible for visas.” 449 U. S., at 512.\n  Finally, the majority concludes that the DPA bar is\ndistinguishable from the INA bar because the former was\nenacted in the context of the “ ‘ “crime against humanity\nthat [was] involved in the concentration camp,” ’ ” which\nwas so horrific that it is in a category all its own.

In that unique\ncontext, the majority reasons, it made sense to exclude\n“even those involved in nonculpable, involuntary assis­\ntance in Nazi persecution.” Ibid. But the majority cannot\nintend to suggest that all acts of persecution during the\nSecond World War were inherently more depraved or\nreprehensible than all acts of persecution that have oc­\ncurred in the decades since the INA’s enactment.\n   Certainly, no such conclusion is compelled by the statu­\ntory text. Congress has steadfastly condemned all acts of\npersecution. See 22 U. S. C. §§6401(a)(5)–(7) (noting that\n“Congress has recognized and denounced acts of religious\npersecution,” which can be “severe and violent” and “par­\nticularly widespread, systematic, and heinous under to­\ntalitarian governments and in countries with militant\npoliticized religious majorities”); §6401(b)(5) (announcing\nthat it is the “policy of the United States” to “stan[d] with\nthe persecuted”); §501, 78 Stat. 1015 (“The Congress con­\ndemns the persecution of any persons because of their\nreligion”); Refugee Act of 1980, §101(a), 94 Stat. 102 (“The\nCongress declares that it is the historic policy of the\nUnited States to respond to the urgent needs of persons\nsubject to persecution in their homelands”). There is no\nreason to deny the INA persecutor bar its full meaning\nbased on a speculative assumption that Congress, in 1980,\ncould not have meant to oppose persecution quite as in­\ntensely as it did in the aftermath of World War II. Rather,\nthe INA’s persecutor bar naturally extends to all acts of\npersecution and, therefore, requires the denial of asylum\nand withholding of removal for “even those involved in\nnonculpable, involuntary assistance in . . . persecution.”\nAnte, at 8 (majority opinion).\n                           IV\n Because I conclude that the INA’s persecutor bar applies\nwhether or not petitioner’s assistance or participation in\n18                 NEGUSIE v.

Argued November 5, 2008—Decided March 3, 2009\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) bars an alien from obtain\n  ing refugee status in this country if he “assisted, or otherwise partici\n  pated in the persecution of any person on account of race, religion,\n  nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n  opinion.” 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(42). This so-called “persecutor bar” ap\n  plies to those seeking asylum or withholding of removal, but does not\n  disqualify an alien from receiving a temporary deferral of removal\n  under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or\n  Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). During the time peti\n  tioner, an Eritrean national, was forced to work as a prison guard in\n  that country, the prisoners he guarded were persecuted on grounds\n  protected under §1101(a)(42). After escaping to the United States,\n  petitioner applied for asylum and withholding of removal. Conclud\n  ing that he assisted in the persecution of prisoners by working as an\n  armed guard, the Immigration Judge denied relief on the basis of the\n  persecutor bar, but granted deferral of removal under CAT because\n  petitioner was likely to be tortured if returned to Eritrea. The Board\n  of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed in all respects, holding, inter\n  alia, that the persecutor bar applies even if the alien’s assistance in\n  persecution was coerced or otherwise the product of duress. The BIA\n  followed its earlier decisions finding Fedorenko v. United States, 449\n  U. S. 490, controlling. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, relying on its\n  precedent following the same reasoning.\nHeld: The BIA and Fifth Circuit misapplied Fedorenko as mandating\n that whether an alien is compelled to assist in persecution is immate\n rial for prosecutor-bar purposes. The BIA must interpret the statute,\n free from this mistaken legal premise, in the first instance. Pp. 4–12.\n    (a) Under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.

S. 837, 842–843, the BIA is entitled to deference in\n    interpreting ambiguous INA provisions, see, e.g., INS v. Aguirre-\n    Aguirre, 526 U. S. 415, 424–425. When the BIA has not spoken on “a\n    matter that statutes place primarily in agency hands,” this Court’s\n    ordinary rule is to remand to allow “the BIA . . . to address the mat\n    ter in the first instance in light of its own experience.” INS v. Or\n    lando Ventura, 537 U. S. 12, 16–17. Pp. 4–5.\n       (b) As there is substance both to petitioner’s contention that invol\n    untary acts cannot implicate the persecutor bar because “persecu\n    tion” presumes moral blameworthiness, and to the Government’s ar\n    gument that the question at issue is answered by the statute’s failure\n    to provide an exception for coerced conduct, it must be concluded that\n    the INA has an ambiguity that the BIA should address in the first in\n    stance. Fedorenko, which addressed a different statute enacted for a\n    different purpose, does not control the BIA’s interpretation of this\n    persecutor bar. In holding that voluntariness was not required with\n    respect to such a bar in the Displaced Persons Act of 1948 (DPA), Fe\n    dorenko contrasted the omission there of the word “voluntary” with\n    the word’s inclusion in a related statutory subsection. 449 U. S., at\n    512. Because Congress did not use the word “voluntary” anywhere in\n    the persecutor bar at issue here, its omission cannot carry the same\n    significance as it did in Fedorenko. Moreover, the DPA’s exclusion of\n    even those involved in nonculpable, involuntary assistance in perse\n    cution was enacted in part to address the Holocaust and its horror,\n    see id., at 511, n. 32, whereas the persecutor bar in this case was en\n    acted as part of the Refugee Act of 1980, which was designed to pro\n    vide a general rule for the ongoing treatment of all refugees and dis\n    placed persons, see, e.g., Aguirre-Aguirre, supra, at 427. Pp. 5–8.\n       (c) Whether a BIA determination that the persecution bar contains\n    no exception for coerced conduct would be reasonable, and thus owed\n    Chevron deference, is a legitimate question; but it is not presented\n    here. In denying petitioner relief, the BIA recited a rule it has devel\n    oped in its cases: An alien’s motivation and intent are irrelevant to\n    the issue whether he “assisted” in persecution; rather, his actions’ ob\n    jective effect controls. A reading of those decisions confirms that the\n    BIA has not exercised its interpretive authority but, instead, has\n    deemed its interpretation to be mandated by Fedorenko. This error\n    prevented the BIA from fully considering the statutory question pre\n    sented. Its mistaken assumption stems from a failure to recognize\n    the inapplicability of the statutory construction principle invoked in\n    Fedorenko, as well as a failure to appreciate the differences in statu\n    tory purpose. The BIA is not bound to apply the Fedorenko rule to\n    the persecutor bar here at issue.

ERIC\n     H. HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [March 3, 2009] \n\n\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  An alien who fears persecution in his homeland and\nseeks refugee status in this country is barred from obtain\ning that relief if he has persecuted others.\n    “The term ‘refugee’ does not include any person who\n    ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in\n    the persecution of any person on account of race, relig\n    ion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n    group, or political opinion.”     Immigration and Na\n    tionality Act (INA), §101, 66 Stat. 166, as added by\n    Refugee Act of 1980, §201(a), 94 Stat. 102–103, 8\n    U. S. C. §1101(a)(42).\nThis so-called “persecutor bar” applies to those seeking\nasylum, §1158(b)(2)(A)(i), or withholding of removal,\n§1231(b)(3)(B)(i). It does not disqualify an alien from\nreceiving a temporary deferral of removal under the Con\nvention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or\nDegrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), art. 3, Dec.\n10, 1984, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100–20, p. 20, 1465 U. N. T. S.\n85; 8 CFR §1208.17(a) (2008).\n  In this case the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA)\n2                    NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndetermined that the persecutor bar applies even if the\nalien’s assistance in persecution was coerced or otherwise\nthe product of duress. In so ruling the BIA followed its\nearlier decisions that found Fedorenko v. United States,\n449 U. S. 490 (1981), controlling. The Court of Appeals for\nthe Fifth Circuit, in affirming the agency, relied on its\nprecedent following the same reasoning. We hold that the\nBIA and the Court of Appeals misapplied Fedorenko. We\nreverse and remand for the agency to interpret the stat\nute, free from the error, in the first instance.\n                                 I\n   Petitioner in this Court is Daniel Girmai Negusie, a\ndual national of Eritrea and Ethiopia, his father having\nbeen a national of the former and his mother of the latter.\nBorn and educated in Ethiopia, he left there for Eritrea\naround the age of 18 to see his mother and find employ\nment. The year was 1994. After a few months in Eritrea,\nstate officials took custody of petitioner and others when\nthey were attending a movie. He was forced to perform\nhard labor for a month and then was conscripted into the\nmilitary for a time. War broke out between Ethiopia and\nEritrea in 1998, and he was conscripted again.\n   When petitioner refused to fight against Ethiopia, his\nother homeland, the Eritrean Government incarcerated\nhim. Prison guards punished petitioner by beating him\nwith sticks and placing him in the hot sun. He was re\nleased after two years and forced to work as a prison\nguard, a duty he performed on a rotating basis for about\nfour years. It is undisputed that the prisoners he guarded\nwere being persecuted on account of a protected ground—\ni.e., “race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\nsocial group, or political opinion.” 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(42).\nPetitioner testified that he carried a gun, guarded the gate\nto prevent escape, and kept prisoners from taking showers\nand obtaining fresh air. He also guarded prisoners to\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmake sure they stayed in the sun, which he knew was a\nform of punishment. He saw at least one man die after\nbeing in the sun for more than two hours. Petitioner\ntestified that he had not shot at or directly punished any\nprisoner and that he helped prisoners on various occa\nsions. Petitioner escaped from the prison and hid in a\ncontainer, which was loaded on board a ship heading to\nthe United States. Once here he applied for asylum and\nwithholding of removal.\n   In a careful opinion the Immigration Judge, W. Wayne\nStogner, found that petitioner’s testimony, for the most\npart, was credible. He concluded that petitioner assisted\nin persecution by working as an armed guard. The judge\ndetermined that although “there’s no evidence to establish\nthat [petitioner] is a malicious person or that he was an\naggressive person who mistreated the prisoners, . . . the\nvery fact that he helped [the government] in the prison\ncompound where he had reason to know that they were\npersecuted constitutes assisting in the persecution of\nothers and bars [petitioner] from” obtaining asylum or\nwithholding of removal. App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a–17a\n(citing, inter alia, Fedorenko, supra). The judge, however,\ngranted deferral of removal under CAT because petitioner\nwas likely to be tortured if returned to Eritrea.\n   The BIA affirmed the denial of asylum and withholding.\nIt noted petitioner’s role as an armed guard in a facility\nwhere “prisoners were tortured and left to die out in the\nsun . . . on account of a protected ground.” App. to Pet. for\nCert. 6a. The BIA held that “[t]he fact that [petitioner]\nwas compelled to participate as a prison guard, and may\nnot have actively tortured or mistreated anyone, is imma\nterial.” Ibid. That is because “ ‘an alien’s motivation and\nintent are irrelevant to the issue of whether he “assisted”\nin persecution . . . [I]t is the objective effect of an alien’s\nactions which is controlling.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Matter of\nFedorenko, 19 I. & N. Dec. 57, 69 (BIA 1984)). The BIA\n4                   NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nalso affirmed the grant of deferral of removal under CAT.\n  On petition for review the Court of Appeals agreed with\nthe BIA that whether an alien is compelled to assist in\npersecution is immaterial for persecutor-bar purposes.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 2a (citing Fedorenko, 449 U. S., at\n512, n. 34). We granted certiorari. 552 U. S. ___ (2008).\n                             II\n  Consistent with the rule in Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837,\n842–843 (1984), the BIA is entitled to deference in inter\npreting ambiguous provisions of the INA. The question\nhere is whether an alien who was compelled to assist in\npersecution can be eligible for asylum or withholding of\nremoval. We conclude that the BIA misapplied our prece\ndent in Fedorenko as mandating that an alien’s motivation\nand intent are irrelevant to the issue whether an alien\nassisted in persecution. The agency must confront the\nsame question free of this mistaken legal premise.\n                              A\n   It is well settled that “principles of Chevron deference\nare applicable to this statutory scheme.” INS v. Aguirre-\nAguirre, 526 U. S. 415, 424 (1999). Congress has charged\nthe Attorney General with administering the INA, and a\n“ruling by the Attorney General with respect to all ques\ntions of law shall be controlling.” 8 U. S. C. §1103(a)(1).\nJudicial deference in the immigration context is of special\nimportance, for executive officials “exercise especially\nsensitive political functions that implicate questions of\nforeign relations.” INS v. Abudu, 485 U. S. 94, 100 (1988).\nThe Attorney General’s decision to bar an alien who has\nparticipated in persecution “may affect our relations with\n[the alien’s native] country or its neighbors. The judiciary\nis not well positioned to shoulder primary responsibility\nfor assessing the likelihood and importance of such diplo\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmatic repercussions.” Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U. S., at 425.\n   The Attorney General, in turn, has delegated to the BIA\nthe “ ‘discretion and authority conferred upon the Attorney\nGeneral by law’ ” in the course of “ ‘considering and deter\nmining cases before it.’ ” Ibid. (quoting 8 CFR §3.1(d)(1)\n(1998)). As a consequence, “the BIA should be accorded\nChevron deference as it gives ambiguous statutory terms\n‘concrete meaning through a process of case-by-case adju\ndication.’ ” Aguirre-Aguirre, supra, at 425 (quoting INS v.\nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421, 448–449 (1987)). When\nthe BIA has not spoken on “a matter that statutes place\nprimarily in agency hands,” our ordinary rule is to remand\nto “giv[e] the BIA the opportunity to address the matter in\nthe first instance in light of its own experience.” INS v.\nOrlando Ventura, 537 U. S. 12, 16–17 (2002) (per curiam).\n                             B\n   The parties disagree over whether coercion or duress is\nrelevant in determining if an alien assisted or otherwise\nparticipated in persecution. As there is substance to both\ncontentions, we conclude that the statute has an ambigu\nity that the agency should address in the first instance.\n   Petitioner argues that the statute’s plain language\nmakes clear that involuntary acts do not implicate the\npersecutor bar because “ ‘persecution’ ” presumes moral\nblameworthiness. Brief for Petitioner 23–28. He invokes\nprinciples of criminal culpability, concepts of international\nlaw, and the rule of lenity. Id., at 28–45. Those argu\nments may be persuasive in determining whether a par\nticular agency interpretation is reasonable, but they do\nnot demonstrate that the statute is unambiguous. Peti\ntioner all but conceded as much at argument in this Court\nwhen he indicated that the BIA has discretion to construe\nthe duress defense in either a narrow or a broad way. Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 20–24.\n   The Government, on the other hand, asserts that the\n6                  NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute does not allow petitioner’s construction. “The\nstatutory text,” the Government says, “directly answers\nthat question: there is no exception” for conduct that is\ncoerced because Congress did not include one. Brief for\nRespondent 11. We disagree. The silence is not conclu\nsive. The question is whether the statutory text mandates\nthat coerced actions must be deemed assistance in perse\ncution. On that point the statute, in its precise terms, is\nnot explicit. Nor is this a case where it is clear that Con\ngress had an intention on the precise question at issue.\nCf. Cardoza-Fonseca, supra, at 448–449.\n  The Government, like the BIA and the Court of Appeals,\nrelies on Fedorenko to provide the answer. This reliance is\nnot without some basis, as the Court there held that vol\nuntariness was not required with respect to another per\nsecutor bar. 449 U. S., at 512. To the extent, however, the\nGovernment deems Fedorenko to be controlling, it is in\nerror.\n  In Fedorenko, the Court interpreted the Displaced Per\nsons Act of 1948 (DPA), 62 Stat. 1009. The DPA was\nenacted “to enable European refugees driven from their\nhomelands by the [second world] war to emigrate to the\nUnited States without regard to traditional immigration\nquotas.” 449 U. S., at 495. Section 2(b) of the DPA pro\nvides relief to “any displaced person or refugee as defined\nin Annex I of the Constitution of the International Refugee\nOrganization” of the United Nations (IRO Constitution).\n62 Stat. 1009. The IRO Constitution, as codified by Con\ngress, excludes any individual “who can be shown: (a) to\nhave assisted the enemy in persecuting civil populations of\ncountries, Members of the United Nations; or (b) to have\nvoluntarily assisted the enemy forces since the outbreak of\nthe second world war in their operations against the\nUnited Nations.” Annex I, Part II, §2, 62 Stat. 3051–3052.\n  The Fedorenko Court held that “an individual’s service\nas a concentration camp armed guard—whether voluntary\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nor involuntary—made him ineligible for a visa” under\n§2(a) of the IRO Constitution. 449 U. S., at 512. That\nCongress did not adopt a voluntariness requirement for\n§2(a), the Court noted, “is plain from comparing §2(a) with\n§2(b), which excludes only those individuals who ‘voluntar\nily assisted the enemy forces.’ ” Ibid. The Court relied on\nthe principle of statutory construction that “the deliberate\nomission of the word ‘voluntary’ from §2(a) compels the\nconclusion that the statute made all those who assisted in\npersecution of civilians ineligible for visas.” Ibid.\n   Fedorenko does not compel the same conclusion in the\ncase now before us. The textual structure of the statute in\nFedorenko (“voluntary” is in one subsection but not the\nother) is not part of the statutory framework considered\nhere. Congress did not use the word “voluntary” in any\nsubsection of the persecutor bar, so its omission cannot\ncarry the same significance.\n   The difference between the statutory scheme in Fe\ndorenko and the one here is confirmed when we “ ‘look not\nonly to the particular statutory language, but to the design\nof the statute as a whole and to its object and policy.’ ”\nDada v. Mukasey, 554 U. S. 1, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 13)\n(quoting Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U. S. 395, 407\n(1991)). Both statutes were enacted to reflect principles\nset forth in international agreements, but the principles\ndiffer in significant respects.\n   As discussed, Congress enacted the DPA in 1948 as part\nof an international effort to address individuals who were\nforced to leave their homelands during and after the sec\nond World War. Fedorenko, supra, at 495. The DPA\nexcludes those who “voluntarily assisted the enemy forces\nsince the outbreak of the second world war,” 62 Stat. 3052,\nas well as all who “assisted the enemy in persecuting civil\npopulations of countries,” id., at 3051. The latter exclu\nsion clause makes no reference to culpability. The exclu\nsion of even those involved in nonculpable, involuntary\n8                   NEGUSIE v.

S., at 511, n. 32.\n  The persecutor bar in this case, by contrast, was enacted\nas part of the Refugee Act of 1980. Unlike the DPA, which\nwas enacted to address not just the post war refugee\nproblem but also the Holocaust and its horror, the Refugee\nAct was designed to provide a general rule for the ongoing\ntreatment of all refugees and displaced persons. As this\nCourt has twice recognized, “ ‘one of Congress’ primary\npurposes’ in passing the Refugee Act was to implement the\nprinciples agreed to in the 1967 United Nations Protocol\nRelating to the Status of Refugees, Jan. 31, 1967, 19\nU. S. T. 6224, T. I. A. S. 6577 (1968),” as well as the\n“United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of\nRefugees, 189 U. N. T. S. 150 (July 28, 1951), reprinted in\n19 U. S. T. 6259.” Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U. S., at 427 (quot\ning Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S., at 436–437).\n  These authorities illustrate why Fedorenko, which\naddressed a different statute enacted for a different pur\npose, does not control the BIA’s interpretation of this\npersecutor bar. Whatever weight or relevance these vari\nous authorities may have in interpreting the statute\nshould be considered by the agency in the first instance,\nand by any subsequent reviewing court, after our remand.\n                             C\n   The Government argues that “if there were any ambigu\nity in the text, the Board’s determination that the bar\ncontains no such exception is reasonable and thus control\nling.” Brief for Respondent 11. Whether such an interpre\ntation would be reasonable, and thus owed Chevron defer\nence, is a legitimate question; but it is not now before us.\nThe BIA deemed its interpretation to be mandated by\nFedorenko, and that error prevented it from a full consid\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

[I]t\nis the objective effect of an alien’s actions which is control\nling.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 6a. The rule is based on three\nearlier decisions: Matter of Laipenieks, 18 I. & N. Dec. 433\n(1983); Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I. & N. Dec. 57; and Matter\nof Rodriguez-Majano, 19 I. & N. Dec. 811 (1988).\n   In Matter of Laipenieks, the BIA applied the Court’s\nFedorenko analysis of the DPA to a different postwar\nstatute, which provided for the deportation of anyone\nassociated with the Nazis who “ordered, incited, assisted,\nor otherwise participated” in persecution based on a pro\ntected ground. 8 U. S. C. §1182(a)(3)(E)(i). Finding no\nagency or judicial decision on point, the BIA relied on\nFedorenko. It recognized that the unique structure of the\nFedorenko statute was not present in §1182(a)(3)(E)(i), but\nthe BIA nevertheless adopted wholesale the Fedorenko\nrule: “[A]s in Fedorenko, . . . the plain language of\n[§1182(a)(3)(E)(i)] mandates a literal interpretation, and\nthe omission of an intent element compels the conclusion\nthat [§1182(a)(3)(E)(i)] makes all those who assisted in the\nspecific persecution deportable.” 18 I. & N. Dec., at 464.\nIn other words, “particular motivations or intent . . . is not\na relevant factor.” Ibid.\n   The second decision, Matter of Fedorenko, also dealt\nwith §1182(a)(3)(E)(i), and it involved the same alien\nwhose citizenship was revoked by this Court’s Fedorenko\ndecision. This time the agency sought to deport him.\nFedorenko responded by requesting suspension of deporta\ntion. He argued that, unlike the DPA’s bar on any assis\ntance—voluntary or involuntary—in persecution, see\nFedorenko, 449 U. S., at 512, the text and structure of\n§1182(a)(3)(E)(i) required deportation only of those who\n10                    NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nvoluntarily assisted in persecuting others. The BIA re\njected that distinction, noting that it was foreclosed by\nMatter of Laipenieks: “It may be, as [Fedorenko] argues,\nthat his service at Treblinka was involuntary. . . . We\nneed not resolve the issue, however, because as a matter of\nlaw [Fedorenko’s] motivations for serving as a guard at\nTreblinka are immaterial to the question of his deportabil\nity under” §1182(a)(3)(E)(i). 19 I. & N. Dec., at 69–70.\n   Later, the BIA applied this Court’s Fedorenko rule to\nthe persecutor bar that is at issue in the present case. In\nMatter of Rodriguez-Majano, the BIA granted relief be\ncause the alien’s coerced conduct as a guerrilla was not\npersecution based on a protected ground. 19 I. & N. Dec.,\nat 815–816. Nevertheless, in reaching its conclusion the\nBIA incorporated without additional analysis the Fe\ndorenko rule as applied in Matter of Laipenieks and reiter\nated in Matter of Fedorenko. 19 I. & N. Dec., at 814–815.\nThe BIA reaffirmed that “[t]he participation or assistance\nof an alien in persecution need not be of his own volition to\nbar him from relief.” Id., at 814 (citing Fedorenko, 449\nU. S. 490).\n   Our reading of these decisions confirms that the BIA\nhas not exercised its interpretive authority but, instead,\nhas determined that Fedorenko controls. This mistaken\nassumption stems from a failure to recognize the inappli\ncability of the principle of statutory construction invoked\nin Fedorenko, as well as a failure to appreciate the differ\nences in statutory purpose. The BIA is not bound to apply\nthe Fedorenko rule that motive and intent are irrelevant\nto the persecutor bar at issue in this case. Whether the\nstatute permits such an interpretation based on a differ\nent course of reasoning must be determined in the first\ninstance by the agency.\n                             III\n     Having concluded that the BIA has not yet exercised its\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

This remand rule exists, in part,\nbecause “ambiguities in statutes within an agency’s juris\ndiction to administer are delegations of authority to the\nagency to fill the statutory gap in reasonable fashion.\nFilling these gaps . . . involves difficult policy choices that\nagencies are better equipped to make than courts.” Na\ntional Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X\nInternet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 980 (2005).\n    JUSTICE STEVENS would have the Court provide a defi\nnite answer to the question presented and then remand\nfor further proceedings. That approach, however, is in\ntension with the “ordinary ‘remand’ rule.” Ventura, supra,\nat 18; see also Cajun Elec. Power Cooperative, Inc. v.\nFERC, 924 F. 2d 1132, 1136 (CADC 1991) (opinion for the\nCourt by Silberman, J., joined by R. Ginsburg and Tho\nmas, JJ.) (“[I]f an agency erroneously contends that Con\ngress’ intent has been clearly expressed and has rested on\nthat ground, we remand to require the agency to consider\nthe question afresh in light of the ambiguity we see”).\nThomas is illustrative. There, the agency had not deter\nmined whether a family may constitute a social group for\nthe purposes of refugee status. The Ninth Circuit held\nthat the family can constitute a protected social group and\nthat the particular family at issue did qualify. 547 U. S.,\nat 184–185. The Solicitor General sought review in this\nCourt on “whether the Ninth Circuit erred in holding, in\nthe first instance and without prior resolution of the ques\ntions by the relevant administrative agency, that members\nof a family can and do constitute a particular social group,\nwithin the meaning of the Act.” Id., at 185 (internal quo\n12                  NEGUSIE v.

We\nagreed and summarily reversed. 547 U. S., at 184–185\n    Ventura and Thomas counsel a similar result here.\nBecause of the important differences between the statute\nbefore us and the one at issue in Fedorenko, we find it\nappropriate to remand to the agency for its initial deter\nmination of the statutory interpretation question and its\napplication to this case. The agency’s interpretation of the\nstatutory meaning of “persecution” may be explained by a\nmore comprehensive definition, one designed to elaborate\non the term in anticipation of a wide range of potential\nconduct; and that expanded definition in turn may be\ninfluenced by how practical, or impractical, the standard\nwould be in terms of its application to specific cases.\nThese matters may have relevance in determining\nwhether its statutory interpretation is a permissible one.\n    As the Court said in Ventura and reiterated in Thomas,\n“ ‘[t]he agency can bring its expertise to bear upon the\nmatter; it can evaluate the evidence; it can make an initial\ndetermination; and, in doing so, it can, through informed\ndiscussion and analysis, help a court later determine\nwhether its decision exceeds the leeway that the law\nprovides.’ ” 547 U. S., at 186–187 (quoting Ventura, supra,\nat 17). If the BIA decides to adopt a standard that consid\ners voluntariness to some degree, it may be prudent and\nnecessary for the Immigration Judge to conduct additional\nfactfinding based on the new standard. Those determina\ntions are for the agency to make in the first instance.\n                     *     *    *\n  We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                        It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

ERIC\n     H. HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [March 3, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE ALITO joins, con\ncurring.\n   I agree with the Court that “the statute has an ambigu\nity,” ante, at 5, with respect to whether an alien who was\ncoerced to assist in persecution is barred from obtaining\nasylum in the United States. I agree that the agency is\nentitled to answer that question. Ibid. See Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U. S. 837, 843 (1984). And I agree that a remand is in\norder, to give the agency an opportunity to clarify whether\nits affirmative answer was premised on an erroneous view\nthat this Court’s decision in Fedorenko v. United States,\n449 U. S. 490 (1981), compelled it. Ante, at 11.\n   I would not agree to remand if I did not think that the\nagency has the option of adhering to its decision. The\nmajority appears to leave that question undecided, ante, at\n5 (reserving whether “a particular agency interpretation is\nreasonable”); two Justices forthrightly disagree and would\nrequire the agency to recognize at least some sort of du\nress exception, post, at 7 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part).\n   But good reasons for the agency’s current practice ex\nist—reasons adequate to satisfy the requirement that an\nagency act reasonably in choosing among various possible\nconstructions of an ambiguous statute. The statute does\n2                   NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nnot mandate the rule precluding the duress defense but\ndoes not foreclose it either; the agency is free to retain\nthat rule so long as the choice to do so is soundly rea\nsoned, not based on irrelevant or arbitrary factors (like\nthe Fedorenko precedent).\n   The primary contention to the contrary is, in short, that\nbarring aliens who persecuted under duress would punish\npurely “nonculpable” conduct. That argument suffers from\nat least three unjustified leaps of logic.\n   First, it implicitly adopts a view of “culpability” that is\nneither the only view nor one necessarily applicable here.\nThe culpability of one who harms another under coercion\nis, and has always been, a subject of intense debate, rais\ning profound questions of moral philosophy and individual\nresponsibility. (The so-called “Nuremberg defense” comes\nreadily to mind.) At common law, duress was not an\naccepted defense to intentional killing, see 2 W. LaFave,\nSubstantive Criminal Law §9.7(b), pp. 74–75 (2d ed. 2003);\nand in modern times, some states do not allow it as a\ndefense to lesser crimes, see id., at 81–82, and n. 50.\nNotably, there is no historical support for the duress\ndefense when a soldier follows a military order he knows\nto be unlawful. Id., §9.7(g), at 86; see also, e.g., Axtell’s\nCase, Kel. J. 13, 84 Eng. Rep. 1060 (1660); Prosecutor v.\nErdemović, [1997] 2 ICTY Jud. Rep. 1610, 1635 (Int’l\nCrim. Trib. for Former Yugoslavia). It is therefore far\nfrom clear that precluding a duress defense here would, as\npetitioner alleges, “disregard principles of blame . . . ‘uni\nversal and persistent’ in American law.” Brief for Peti\ntioner 32 (quoting Morissette v. United States, 342 U. S.\n246, 250 (1952)). All of this suggests that those who are\ncoerced to commit wrong are at least sometimes “culpable”\nenough to be treated as criminals.\n   More importantly, this is not a criminal matter. This\nCourt has long understood that an “order of deportation is\nnot a punishment for crime.” Fong Yue Ting v. United\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                      SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nStates, 149 U. S. 698, 730 (1893). Asylum is a benefit\naccorded by grace, not by entitlement, and withholding\nthat benefit from all who have intentionally harmed oth\ners—whether under coercion or not—is not unreasonable.\n   Second, petitioner assumes that the persecutor bar must\nhave been intended merely to punish wrongdoing. But in\nthe context of immigration law, “culpability” as a relevant\nfactor in determining admissibility is only one facet of a\nmore general consideration: desirability. And there may\nwell be reasons to think that those who persecuted others,\neven under duress, would be relatively undesirable as\nimmigrants. If, for example, the asylum laws grant entry\nto those who suffered the persecution, might it not be\nimprudent to also grant entry to the coerced persecutor,\nwho may end up living in the same community as one of\nhis victims? The Nation has a legitimate interest in pre\nventing the importation of ethnic strife from remote parts\nof the world, and the agency may resolve the statutory\nambiguity in a way that safeguards that interest.\n   Finally, even if culpability is the only relevant factor,\nand even if a narrow, criminal-law based view of culpabil\nity is the authoritative one, a bright-line rule excluding all\npersecutors—whether acting under coercion or not—might\nstill be the best way for the agency to effectuate the statu\ntory scheme. See generally Cox & Posner, Second-Order\nStructure of Immigration Law, 59 Stan. L. Rev. 809\n(2007). Immigration judges already face the overwhelm\ning task of attempting to recreate, by a limited number of\nwitnesses speaking through (often poor-quality) transla\ntion, events that took place years ago in foreign, usually\nimpoverished countries. See Dia v. Ashcroft, 353 F. 3d\n228, 261–262 (CA3 2003) (en banc) (Alito, J., concurring in\npart and dissenting in part). Adding on top of that the\nburden of adjudicating claims of duress and coercion,\nwhich are extremely difficult to corroborate and necessar\nily pose questions of degree that require intensely fact\n4                       NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                         SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nbound line-drawing, would increase the already inherently\nhigh risk of error. And the cost of error (viz., allowing\nuncoerced persecutors to remain in the country perma\nnently) might reasonably be viewed by the agency as\nsignificantly greater than the cost of overinclusion under a\nbright-line rule (viz., denial of asylum to some coerced\npersecutors—who might anyway be entitled to protection\nunder the Convention Against Torture, which includes no\nanalogous persecutor bar).\n   It is worth noting that although the agency’s “objective\neffects” approach to the statute would seem to sweep\nbeyond the duress scenario to encompass even an alien\nwho had no idea that his actions would “objectively” assist\nin persecution, see Castañeda-Castillo v. Gonzales, 488\nF. 3d 17, 20 (CA1 2007) (en banc), there is no reason why\nthe agency cannot consider questions of knowledge sepa\nrate and apart from questions of duress. Both can be said\nto relate to the mental state of the persecutor,* but they\npresent different problems which can be grappled with\nseparately.     The agency need not provide an “all\nembracing answer,” ibid., in the present case. It may\nevaluate problems one by one as they arise, and whatever\nit might decide about an unknowing persecutor is irrele\nvant to petitioner, who knew exactly what he was doing.\n   To be clear, I do not endorse any particular rule. It is to\nagency officials, not to the Members of this Court, that\nCongress has given discretion to choose among permissible\ninterpretations of the statute. They deserve to be told\nclearly whether we are serious about allowing them to\nexercise that discretion, or are rather firing a warning\nshot across the bow.\n——————\n  * The rationale for the duress defense, however, is conventionally “not\nthat the defendant . . . somehow loses his mental capacity to commit\nthe crime in question,” but rather that “even though he has done the\nact the crime requires and has the mental state which the crime re\nquires, his conduct . . . is excused.” 2 LaFave, supra, §9.7(a), at 73.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

S. C. §§1101(a)(42), 1158(b)(2)(A)(i), 1231(b)(3)(B),\ndisqualifies from asylum or withholding of removal an\nalien whose conduct was coerced or otherwise the product\nof duress. If the answer to that threshold question is “no,”\ncourts should defer to the Attorney General’s evaluation of\nparticular circumstances that may or may not establish\nduress or coercion in individual cases. But the threshold\nquestion the Court addresses today is a “pure question of\nstatutory construction for the courts to decide.” INS v.\nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421, 446 (1987). For that\nreason, while I agree with the Court’s cogent explanation\nof why its misguided decision in Fedorenko v. United\nStates, 449 U. S. 490 (1981), does not govern our interpre­\ntation of the persecutor bar, I would provide a definite\nanswer to the question presented and then remand for\nfurther proceedings.\n                           I\n  Judicial deference to agencies’ views on statutes they\nadminister was not born in Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natu­\nral Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984),\n2                       NEGUSIE v.

S. 974, 988 (1986) (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting), die with that case. In the years before Chev­\nron, this Court recognized that statutory interpretation is\na multifaceted enterprise, ranging from a precise construc­\ntion of statutory language to a determination of what\npolicy best effectuates statutory objectives. We accord­\ningly acknowledged that a complete interpretation of a\nstatutory provision might demand both judicial construc­\ntion and administrative explication. E.g., NLRB v. Hearst\nPublications, Inc., 322 U. S. 111 (1944) (construing the\nterm “employee” in the National Labor Relations Act but\ndeferring to the National Labor Relations Board’s finding\nthat newsboys were employees); see Nathanson, Adminis­\ntrative Discretion in the Interpretation of Statutes, 3\nVand. L. Rev. 470 (1950).\n   Chevron adhered to this approach. There, we recognized\nthat the Clean Air Act did not define “stationary source,”\n42 U. S. C. §7502(b)(6) (1982 ed.), but rather implicitly\ndelegated to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\nthe policy question whether States could treat entire\nplants or only their discrete pollution-emitting devices as\nsources of pollution for purposes of the Act’s permit pro­\ngram. Congress left a gap for the agency to fill, and the\nagency brought its expertise, political acuity, and informa­\ntion-gathering abilities to bear in doing so. See Chevron,\n467 U. S., at 865–866.1 In keeping with precedent, see id.,\n——————\n    1 Notably,\n             the EPA cast its activity not as statutory construction but\nas public administration; its rulemaking sought to achieve policy goals,\nsuch as reducing regulatory complexity and promoting plant moderni­\nzation. See 46 Fed. Reg. 50766 (1981). To be sure, the EPA argued\nthat its regulation defining “stationary source” as an entire plant was\npermissible under the Clean Air Act, but the agency treated its rule­\nmaking as a matter of fashioning sound policy, not of discerning the\nmeaning of “stationary source” in the statute.\n                   Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                3\n\n                       Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nat 843–845, and nn. 9, 11–14, our opinion reaffirmed both\nthat “[t]he judiciary is the final authority on issues of\nstatutory construction,” id., at 843, n. 9, and that courts\nshould defer to an agency’s reasonable formulation of\npolicy in response to an explicit or implicit congressional\ndelegation of authority. The Chevron framework thus\naccounts for the different institutional competencies of\nagencies and courts: Courts are expert at statutory con­\nstruction, while agencies are expert at statutory imple­\nmentation. That the distinction can be subtle does not\nlessen its importance.\n   In the 25 years since Chevron was decided, this Court\nhas continued to recognize that courts and agencies play\ncomplementary roles in the project of statutory interpreta­\ntion. We have repeatedly held that “ambiguities in stat­\nutes within an agency’s jurisdiction to administer are\ndelegations of authority to the agency to fill the statutory\ngap in reasonable fashion.” National Cable & Telecom­\nmunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S.\n967, 980 (2005). But even when confronted with a statute\nthat involves a degree of ambiguity—as most statutes do—\nwe have not abdicated our judicial role. The fact that\nCongress has left a gap for the agency to fill means that\ncourts should defer to the agency’s reasonable gap-filling\ndecisions, not that courts should cease to mark the bounds\nof delegated agency choice.2\n   In cases involving agency adjudication, we have some­\ntimes described the court’s role as deciding pure questions\nof statutory construction and the agency’s role as applying\nlaw to fact. See, e.g., Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421;\nNLRB v. Food & Commercial Workers, 484 U. S. 112\n——————\n  2 Cf. United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 236–238 (2001);\n\nBarnhart v. Walton, 535 U.

In the context of agency rulemak­\ning, for instance, we might distinguish between pure\nquestions of statutory interpretation and policymaking, or\nbetween central legal issues and interstitial questions.\nSee Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U. S. 212, 222 (2002).3 The\nlabel is immaterial. What matters is the principle: Cer­\ntain aspects of statutory interpretation remain within the\npurview of the courts, even when the statute is not en­\ntirely clear, while others are properly understood as dele­\ngated by Congress to an expert and accountable adminis­\ntrative body. Statutory language may thus admit of both\njudicial construction and agency exposition.\n                             II\n   Two of this Court’s cases construing the Immigration\nand Nationality Act (INA), 66 Stat. 166, 8 U. S. C. §1101\net seq., illustrate the proper division of responsibility\nbetween courts and agencies and highlight when Chevron\ndeference is appropriate and when it is not. In Cardoza-\nFonseca, the question was whether the standard of INA\n§243(h), 8 U. S. C. §1253(h) (1982 ed.), which requires an\nalien to show that she is more likely than not to be subject\nto persecution if she is deported, also governs applications\nfor asylum under §208(a), 8 U. S. C. §1158(a) (1982 ed.),\nwhich authorizes the Attorney General to grant asylum to\nan alien who has a well-founded fear of persecution in her\nhome country. After considering the INA’s language, its\nlegislative history, and the United Nations Protocol that\n——————\n  3 The Administrative Procedure Act draws a similar distinction in\n\nproviding that courts “shall decide all relevant questions of law [and]\ninterpret constitutional and statutory provisions” but shall review\n“agency action, findings, and conclusions” under the arbitrary and\ncapricious/abuse of discretion standard. 5 U.

S., at 446. We therefore did not\ndefer to the BIA’s interpretation of the two standards as\nequivalent but instead employed traditional tools of statu­\ntory construction and “concluded that Congress did not\nintend the two standards to be identical.” Ibid.4\n   Importantly, we recognized that Chevron deference need\nnot be an all-or-nothing venture. Even after the question\nof the standards’ equivalency was resolved, there re­\nmained the question of their application. We explained,\n“The narrow legal question whether the two standards are\nthe same is, of course, quite different from the question of\ninterpretation that arises in each case in which the agency\nis required to apply either or both standards to a particu­\nlar set of facts.” 480 U. S., at 448. And we noted that\napplying the INA was a task particularly suited to the\nagency’s unique competencies: “There is obviously some\nambiguity in a term like ‘well-founded fear’ which can only\n\n——————\n  4 JUSTICE SCALIA objected in particular to the majority’s holding that\n\npure questions of statutory construction are for the courts, not agencies,\nto decide; he insisted this was unfaithful to Chevron, “since in Chevron\nthe Court deferred to the Environmental Protection Agency’s abstract\ninterpretation of the phrase ‘stationary source.’ ” 480 U. S., at 455\n(opinion concurring in judgment). The majority rejected JUSTICE\nSCALIA’s argument, recognizing that Chevron involved an agency’s\ncomplex policy judgment about how to fill a statutory gap, not a pure\nquestion of statutory construction. See 480 U. S., at 445–448, and n. 29\n(quoting extensively from Chevron).\n6                   NEGUSIE v.

In that process of filling ‘ “any gap left,\nimplicitly or explicitly by Congress,” ’ the courts must\nrespect the interpretation of the agency to which Congress\nhas delegated the responsibility for administering the\nstatutory program.” Ibid. (quoting Chevron, 467 U. S., at\n843, in turn quoting Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U. S. 199, 231\n(1974)).\n  In INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U. S. 415 (1999), the\nCourt encountered just the type of agency decision Car­\ndoza-Fonseca indicated would warrant Chevron deference.\nThe BIA had denied withholding of deportation because it\nfound that the respondent had “committed a serious non­\npolitical crime” before he entered the United States, 8\nU. S. C. §1253(h)(2)(C) (1994 ed.). The Court of Appeals\nreversed the agency’s decision and required it to supple­\nment its balancing test with specific additional factors\n(such as whether the respondent’s acts were grossly out of\nproportion to their objective and whether the acts were\npolitically necessary and successful).\n  We reversed the Court of Appeals, concluding that\nChevron deference should be accorded to the BIA “as it\ngives ambiguous statutory terms ‘concrete meaning\nthrough a process of case-by-case adjudication.’ ” 526 U. S.,\nat 425 (quoting Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S., at 448). The\nBIA’s formulation of a test to apply the statutory standard\nin individual cases and its application of that test in re­\nspondent’s case were precisely the sort of agency actions\nthat merited judicial deference.\n                           III\n  The threshold question the Court addresses today is the\nkind of “pure question of statutory construction for the\ncourts to decide” that we answered in Cardoza-Fonseca,\nid., at 446, rather than a fact-intensive question of the\nkind we addressed in Aguirre-Aguirre.

Although I agree in full with the Court’s con­\nclusion that the majority opinion in Fedorenko does not\ngovern our interpretation of the persecutor bar, the differ­\nences the Court highlights between the Displaced Persons\nAct of 1948 (DPA), 62 Stat. 1009, and the Refugee Act of\n1980, 94 Stat. 102, only strengthen my conclusion that\nvoluntary assistance in persecution is required and that\nduress and coercion vitiate voluntariness.\n  The Fedorenko Court’s construction of the DPA threat­\nened to exclude from the United States concentration\ncamp prisoners who were forced to assist the Nazis in the\n——————\n    5 The majority suggests that this approach is inconsistent with the\n\n“ ‘ordinary “remand” rule’ ” articulated in Gonzales v. Thomas, 547 U. S.\n183 (2006) (per curiam), and INS v. Orlando Ventura, 537 U. S. 12\n(2002) (per curiam). Ante, at 11–12. But those cases involved exactly\nthe sort of application of law to fact that is within the agency’s purview.\nIn Thomas, the Court of Appeals decided that the family at issue “fell\nwithin the scope of the statutory term ‘particular social group.’ ” 547\nU. S., at 185. We noted that the BIA had not considered this question,\nwhich “require[d] determining the facts and deciding whether the facts\nas found f[e]ll within a statutory term.” Id., at 186. Accordingly, we\nheld that the court should have remanded to the agency. Similarly, in\nVentura, the Court of Appeals addressed an issue that the BIA had not\nreached and concluded that conditions in Guatemala had so improved\nthat no realistic threat of persecution currently existed. The Govern­\nment argued that the court had not respected “the BIA’s role as fact­\nfinder,” 537 U. S., at 16, and we agreed, reversing the court’s judgment\ninsofar as it had not remanded to the agency.\n8                      NEGUSIE v.

In my view, this construc­\ntion was insupportable—the DPA’s exclusion of persons\nwho “assisted the enemy in persecuting civil populations,”\nConstitution of the International Refugee Organization,\nAnnex I, Part II, §2(a), 62 Stat. 3051, did not extend to\nconcentration camp prisoners who did so involuntarily.\nThese prisoners were victims, not persecutors.\n   Without an exception for involuntary action, the Refu­\ngee Act’s bar would similarly treat entire classes of victims\nas persecutors. The Act does not support such a reading.\nThe language of the persecutor bar is most naturally read\nto denote culpable conduct, and this reading is powerfully\nsupported by the statutory context and legislative history.\n   As this Court has previously recognized—and as the\nmajority acknowledges again today—Congress passed the\nRefugee Act to implement the United Nations Convention\nRelating to the Status of Refugees, 189 U. N. T. S. 150\n(July 28, 1951) (hereinafter Convention), reprinted in 19\nU. S. T. 6259, and the 1967 United Nations Protocol Relat­\ning to the Status of Refugees, Jan. 31, 1967, [1968] 19\nU. S. T. 6223, T. I. A. S. No. 6577 (hereinafter Protocol).\nThese treaties place a mandatory obligation on signatory\nstates not to “expel or return (‘refouler’) a refugee in any\nmanner whatsoever to . . . territories where his life or\nfreedom would be threatened on account of his race, relig­\nion, nationality, membership of a particular social group\nor political opinion.” Convention, Art. 33(1), 19 U.

No. 96–781, p. 20 (1980). The language of the\nConvention’s exception is critical: We do not normally\nconvict individuals of crimes when their actions are co­\nerced or otherwise involuntary. Indeed, the United Na­\ntions Handbook, to which the Court has looked for guid­\nance in the past, states that all relevant factors, including\n“mitigating circumstances,” must be considered in deter­\nmining whether an alien’s acts are of a “criminal nature”\nas contemplated by Article 1(F).

The\nCAT prohibits a state party from returning any person to a country\nwhere there is substantial reason to believe he might be tortured, but\nits definition of torture covers a narrower class of harms, imposed by a\nnarrower class of actors, than the asylum and witholding of removal\nprovisions.

The agency would retain the\nability, for instance, to define duress and coercion; to\ndetermine whether or not a balancing test should be em­\nployed; and, of course, to decide whether any individual\nasylum-seeker’s acts were covered by the persecutor bar.\nThose are the sorts of questions suited to the agency’s\nunique competencies in administering the INA.

S. C.\n§§1101(a)(42), 1158(b)(2)(A), 1231(b)(3)(B)(i). The Board\nof Immigration Appeals (BIA), principally relying on this\nCourt’s decision in Fedorenko v. United States, 449 U. S.\n490 (1981), held that the statute does not require that the\npersecution be voluntarily inflicted. The Court of Appeals\nfor the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\n   According to the Court, Fedorenko, which construed the\nsimilar text of a persecution bar in the Displaced Persons\nAct of 1948 (DPA), is largely irrelevant to the question\npresented here. See ante, at 6–8, 9–10; see also ante, at 2\n(SCALIA, J., concurring). The majority further holds that\nthe INA is ambiguous as to “whether coercion or duress is\nrelevant in determining if an alien assisted or otherwise\nparticipated in persecution” and that the agency, there­\nfore, should interpret the statute in the first instance to\ndetermine whether it reasonably can be read to include a\nvoluntariness requirement. Ante, at 5, 10–12; see also\nante, at 1 (SCALIA, J., concurring). I disagree with both of\n2                   NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthese conclusions. Because the INA unambiguously pre­\ncludes any inquiry into whether the persecutor acted\nvoluntarily, i.e., free from coercion or duress, I would\naffirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. I respectfully\ndissent.\n                               I\n   Petitioner Daniel Girmai Negusie testified to the Immi­\ngration Judge (IJ) that he was forced to work as an armed\nguard for four years at an Eritrean prison camp where\nprisoners were persecuted because of their religious be­\nliefs. According to petitioner, part of his job was “to firmly\ncontrol the prisoners, to punish the prisoners, too, by\nexposing them” to the extreme heat of the African sun.\nApp. 58. The guards “would . . . hold [a] stick [with] their\nhand” and follow prisoners who were being forced to “roll\non the ground in the sun.” Id., at 23. Because “it was\nextremely hot,” prisoners would quickly “get tired and\n[feel] shortness of breath and stop” rolling. Id., at 24.\nThey were then beaten. Prisoners typically could not\nsurvive this punishment for more than two hours. Indeed,\nat least one prisoner died from sun exposure while peti­\ntioner stood guard. See ante, at 3 (majority opinion).\n   Petitioner testified that, as a guard, he prevented the\nprisoners from showering and forbade them from leaving\ntheir rooms for fresh air. This form of punishment was\nparticularly severe because the prisons were “built from\nstone and bricks” with “no cooling system, no ventilation,\nno windows,” and intolerable heat. App. 20, 30. Petitioner\nalso prevented prisoner escapes, for which the punishment\nwas forced sun exposure. And, although petitioner never\nused “electricity to torture” prisoners, he was aware that\nhis supervisor did. Id., at 61–62.\n   But petitioner, who had converted to Protestantism\nwhen he was confined as a prisoner at the camp, also\ntestified that he did not want to persecute any of the\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

On one occasion, he gave water to a prisoner who\nwas dying from sun exposure. On another occasion, he let\nfemale prisoners take showers after they had been denied\nthat privilege “for a long time.” Id., at 37. Petitioner also\noccasionally allowed some of the prisoners to “go outside\nduring the night and during the evenings and . . . refresh\nthemselves in the fresh air.” Id., at 37–38.\n   After four years as a prison guard, petitioner deserted\nhis post, swam to a shipping container, and hid inside.\nSee ante, at 3 (majority opinion). The container arrived in\nthe United States with petitioner inside on December 20,\n2004. Petitioner applied for asylum and the withholding\nof removal under the INA, 8 U. S. C. §1101 et seq. He also\napplied for protection under the Convention Against Tor­\nture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment\nor Punishment (CAT), under which it is “the policy of the\nUnited States not to expel, extradite, or otherwise effect\nthe involuntary return of any person to a country in which\nthere are substantial grounds for believing the person\nwould be in danger of being subjected to torture.” Foreign\nAffairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, §2242(a),\n112 Stat. 2681–822, note following 8 U. S. C. §1231, p. 263\n(United States Policy with Respect to Involuntary Return\nof Persons in Danger of Subjection to Torture (hereinafter\nCAT Policy)). See also CAT, Dec. 10, 1984, S. Treaty Doc.\nNo. 100–20, 1465 U. N. T. S. 85. Petitioner feared that, if\nreturned to Eritrea, he would “be executed” because he\nhad converted to Protestantism and deserted his military\npost. App. 65, 68.\n   The INA provides the Executive with the discretion to\ngrant asylum to aliens that are “unable or unwilling” to\nreturn to their home country “because of persecution or a\nwell-founded fear of persecution on account of race, relig­\nion, nationality, membership in a particular social group,\n4                       NEGUSIE v.

The INA also requires the Executive to with­\nhold removal of aliens to a country in which there is a\n“clear probability” that their “life or freedom would be\nthreatened” because of their “race, religion, nationality,\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opin­\nion.” §1231(b)(3)(A). However, the INA prohibits the\nExecutive from granting asylum or withholding removal if\nan alien “ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise partici­\npated in the persecution” of any person on account of\n“race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\nsocial group, or political opinion.” §1158(b)(2)(A)(i) (asy­\nlum); §1231(b)(3)(B) (withholding of removal).

Relying on Fedorenko, the IJ and\nBIA found that even if petitioner was “compelled to par­\nticipate as a prison guard” against his wishes, his “motiva­\ntion and intent are irrelevant to the issue of whether he\n‘assisted’ in persecution.” Ibid. (some internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Therefore, petitioner was ineligible for\nasylum or the withholding of removal under the INA. The\nIJ and BIA agreed, however, that petitioner qualified for\ndeferral of removal because it is “more likely than not that\nhe would be tortured” if returned to Eritrea given that its\n“government has used deadly force and threatened to use\ndeadly force against deserters.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 7a–\n8a, 20a, 19a. The Court of Appeals affirmed. See Negusie\nv. Gonzales, 231 Fed. Appx. 325, 326 (CA5 2007) (per\ncuriam).\n                              II\n   As with all statutory interpretation questions, construc­\ntion of the INA’s persecutor bar must begin with the plain\nlanguage of the statute. See Jimenez v. Quarterman, 555\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 5) (citing Lamie v. United\nStates Trustee, 540 U. S. 526, 534 (2004)). If the text of a\nstatute governing agency action “ ‘directly addresse[s] the\nprecise question at issue,’ ” then, “ ‘that is the end of the\nmatter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give\neffect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Con­\ngress.’ ” National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 551 U. S. 664, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 18) (quoting\n6                   NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nChevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Coun\ncil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842–843 (1984)).\n                               A\n  A court must first “look to the particular statutory\nlanguage at issue.” K mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U. S.\n281, 291 (1988). As the majority acknowledges, see ante,\nat 5–6, the text of the INA’s persecutor bar neither in­\ncludes the term “voluntary” nor contains an exception for\ninvoluntary, coerced conduct. The statute instead applies\nto any alien “who ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise\nparticipated in the persecution of any person” on account\nof a protected ground. §§1101(a)(42), 1158(b)(2)(A)(i),\n1231(b)(3)(B)(i).\n  The statute’s key terms also do not imply any voluntari­\nness requirement for persecution. Under the ordinary\nmeaning of the term “persecution” at the time of the stat­\nute’s enactment in 1980 and its reenactment in 1996, the\nact of persecution alone is sufficient to classify one’s con­\nduct as persecution. See Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate\nDictionary 877 (1991) (hereinafter Webster’s Ninth) (defin­\ning “persecution” as “the act or practice of persecuting esp.\nthose who differ in origin, religion, or social outlook”); see\nalso Webster’s New Collegiate Dictionary 855 (1975) (here­\ninafter Webster’s) (same). The term itself includes no\nintrinsic mens rea requirement. As a result, an individual\ncan “persecute”—meaning “harass in a manner designed\nto injure, grieve, or afflict”—without having designed the\nact or intended for injury, grief, or affliction to occur.\nWebster’s Ninth 877; see also Webster’s 855 (same).\n  The persecutor bar’s inclusion of those who “assist” or\n“participate” confirms that it does not include a voluntari­\nness requirement. The term “assist” is defined as “to give\nsupport or aid,” Webster’s Ninth 109, or “to help,” Oxford\nAmerican Dictionary 36 (1980) (hereinafter Oxford). See\nalso Black’s Law Dictionary 111 (5th ed. 1979) (hereinaf­\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)              7\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nter Black’s) (defining “assist” as “[t]o help; aid; succor; lend\ncountenance or encouragement to; participate in as an\nauxiliary”). And “participate” means simply “to take part,”\nWebster’s Ninth 858, or “to have a share, to take part in\nsomething,” Oxford 487; see also Black’s 1007 (defining\n“participate” as “[t]o receive or have a part or share of; to\npartake of; experience in common with others; to have or\nenjoy a part or share in common with others”). Accord­\ningly, this Court has concluded that the ordinary mean­\nings of “assist” and “participate” do not “connote volun­\ntariness.” Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524\nU. S. 206, 211 (1998) (participate); see also Fedorenko, 449\nU. S., at 512 (assist). These are “terms and concepts of\nbreadth,” Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 21–22\n(1983), that require only that an individual take “some\npart in” an activity, or help it to occur in some way. Reves\nv. Ernst & Young, 507 U. S. 170, 178–179 (1993) (empha­\nsis in original). Even if participation or assistance is\ncoerced, it remains participation or assistance just the\nsame.\n                             B\n  In addition to the particular statutory section of the INA\nbefore the Court, “the language and design of the statute\nas a whole” is instructive in determining the provision’s\nplain meaning. K mart Corp., supra, at 291; see also\nAmoco Production Co. v. Gambell, 480 U. S. 531, 552–553\n(1987). Here, the INA’s design and structure buttress the\nconclusion that the persecutor bar applies irrespective of\nvoluntariness.\n  First, Congress has evidenced its ability to both specifi­\ncally require voluntary conduct and explicitly exclude\ninvoluntary conduct in other provisions of the INA. See\ninfra, at 15–16. For example, Congress has barred admis­\nsion to the United States of totalitarian party members\nunless their membership was “involuntary,” 8 U. S. C.\n8                   NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n§1182(a)(3)(D)(ii), and it has provided for the termination\nof asylum when an alien “has voluntarily availed himself\nor herself” of another country’s protections, §1158(c)(2)(D).\n“[W]here Congress includes particular language in one\nsection of a statute but omits it in another section of the\nsame Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts\nintentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or\nexclusion.” Russello, supra, at 23 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); see, e.g., Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co.,\n534 U. S. 438, 452–454 (2002). The absence of a volun­\ntariness requirement in the INA persecutor bar is no\nexception.\n   Second, federal immigration law provides calibrated\nremedies, which include partial refuge for specified aliens\nwho have both suffered from and inflicted persecution.\nThose who have been persecuted and have not engaged in\npersecution may receive both asylum and the withholding\nof removal. §§1231(b)(3)(A), 1158(b)(1)(A). Those at the\nother end of the spectrum, who have not been persecuted\nbut have persecuted others, may not receive either asylum\nor the withholding of removal. §§1231(b)(3)(B)(i),\n1158(b)(2)(A)(i). And finally, for many individuals who\n(like petitioner) have both persecuted others and been\npersecuted, the scheme provides temporary refuge; they\nwill receive deferral of removal under the CAT if they will\nface torture upon their return to their home country. CAT\nPolicy (a), at 263; see also 8 CFR §§1208.13(a),\n1208.16(d)(2).\n   Where “Congress has enacted a comprehensive scheme\nand has deliberately targeted specific problems with spe­\ncific solutions,” courts should not read one part of the\nlegislative regime (the INA) to provide a different, and\nconflicting, solution to a problem that has already been\nspecifically addressed elsewhere in the federal immigra­\ntion regime (regulations implementing the CAT). Varity\nCorp. v. Howe, 516 U. S. 489, 519 (1996) (THOMAS, J.,\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

Federal law provides\nonly partial protection to a victim of persecution who has\nalso engaged in persecution, voluntarily or not. There\nsimply is no justification for writing into the INA’s perse­\ncutor bar the greater protections of asylum and the with­\nholding of removal for individuals who were coerced into\nengaging in persecution. That is, the “assumption of\ninadvertent omission” of a voluntariness requirement in\nthe INA “is rendered especially suspect upon close consid­\neration of [a statute’s] interlocking, interrelated, and\ninterdependent remedial scheme” that addresses the\nspecific problem at issue in a conflicting way. Massachu\nsetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U. S. 134, 146–147\n(1985).2\n                             C\n   Finally, Congress is aware of a judicial interpretation of\nstatutory language and “adopt[s] that interpretation when\nit re-enacts a statute without change.” Lorillard v. Pons,\n434 U. S. 575, 580 (1978); see also Traynor v. Turnage,\n485 U. S. 535, 546 (1988); 2B N. Singer & J. Singer, Suth­\nerland on Statutory Construction §49.9, pp. 127–133 (7th\n——————\n  2 It also is important to acknowledge that the object of the INA is to\n\ncodify Congress’ policy decisions “ ‘pertaining to the entry of aliens and\ntheir right to remain’ ” in the United States—decisions that are “ ‘en­\ntrusted exclusively to Congress.’ ” Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U. S. 753,\n766, 767 (1972) (quoting Galvan v. Press, 347 U. S. 522, 531–532\n(1954)). In fact, “over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of\nCongress more complete than it is over” the decision of Congress to\nadmit or to exclude aliens. Oceanic Steam Nav. Co. v. Stranahan, 214\nU. S. 320, 339 (1909). Courts therefore must enforce the immigration\npolicy decision reflected in a statute’s plain terms, even if Congress has\nchosen “to forbid the entrance of foreigners within its dominions”\naltogether, Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U. S. 698, 705 (1893).\nLikewise, here, where Congress has made a judgment about which\npersons to admit and exclude from the country, it is not for this Court\nto question the wisdom of that choice.\n10                  NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ned. 2008). Here, the statutory and decisional backdrop\nagainst which Congress enacted the INA’s persecutor bar\ncounsels against grafting a voluntariness requirement\nonto the statute.\n   When Congress enacted the INA’s persecutor bar, it\nessentially retained the language used in similar prede­\ncessor statutes. Under the 1948 DPA persecutor bar,\nentry was denied to all who “ ‘assisted the enemy in perse­\ncuting civil[ians].’ ” Fedorenko, 449 U. S., at 495 (quoting\n62 Stat. 3051). In 1950, Congress added a second persecu­\ntor bar to the DPA that applied “to any person who advo­\ncated or assisted in the persecution of any person because\nof race, religion, or national origin.” §13, 64 Stat. 227. In\nthe years that followed, Congress continued to use this\nsame broad language in denying asylum to specific catego­\nries of persecutors. See, e.g., §105, 91 Stat. 1224 (denying\npermanent residence to aliens from Vietnam, Laos, and\nCambodia “who ordered, assisted, or otherwise partici­\npated in the persecution of any person because of race,\nreligion, or political opinion”); 8 U. S. C. §§1182(a)(3)(E),\n1227(a)(4)(D)) (authorizing the exclusion of anyone who\nhad been associated with Nazi forces and had “ordered,\nincited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecu­\ntion of any person because of race, religion, national ori­\ngin, or political opinion”); §14(a), 67 Stat. 406 (imposing\npersecutor bar on “any person who personally advocated or\nassisted in the persecution of . . . [a] group of persons\nbecause of race, religion, or national origin”).\n   Congress then enacted the INA bar in 1980. This stat­\nute comprehensively labeled as a persecutor “any person\nwho ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in\nthe persecution of any person on account of race, religion,\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or\npolitical opinion.” §201(a), 94 Stat. 102–103. Congress\nreenacted the INA’s persecutor bar in 1996 and retained\nits breadth. See Illegal Immigration Reform and Immi­\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

By the time of the 1996 reen­\nactment, this Court had specifically interpreted the plain\nlanguage of the predecessor bars to apply regardless of the\nvoluntariness of a persecutor’s conduct. See Fedorenko,\nsupra, at 512 (1948 DPA bar); see also United States v.\nKoreh, 59 F. 3d 431, 439 (CA3 1995) (1950 DPA bar);\nUnited States v. Schmidt, 923 F. 2d 1253, 1258 (CA7 1991)\n(1948 DPA bar); Maikovskis v. INS, 773 F. 2d 435, 445–\n446 (CA2 1985) (8 U. S. C. §1251(a)(19) (1982 ed.), trans­\nferred to §1227(a)(4)(D) (2006 ed.)). In particular, this\nCourt had held that the phrase in the 1948 DPA bar,\n“assisted the enemy in persecuting civil[ians],” contained\nno “ ‘involuntary assistance’ exception.” Fedorenko, 449\nU. S., at 512. Rather, the statute’s “plain language” made\nclear that “an individual’s service as a concentration camp\narmed guard—whether voluntary or involuntary—made\nhim ineligible for a visa.” Ibid.\n  In light of this legal backdrop, Congress’ decisions in\n1980 and 1996 to retain a persecutor bar that broadly\napplies to anyone who “assisted, or otherwise participated\nin the persecution” of any person, §§1158(b)(2)(A)(i),\n1231(b)(3)(B), is significant evidence that Congress did not\nintend to include any involuntariness exception in the INA\nbar. This Court must assume, absent textual proof to the\ncontrary, that Congress was aware of the Fedorenko deci­\nsion when it reenacted the persecutor bar and thus\n“adopt[ed] that interpretation when it re-enact[ed the]\nstatute without change,” Lorillard, supra, at 580.\n                           D\n  In sum, the INA’s persecutor bar does not require that\n12                       NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nassistance or participation in persecution be voluntary or\nuncoerced to fall within the statute’s reach. It instead\n“mandates precisely” what it says: “[A]n individual’s ser­\nvice as a [prison] camp armed guard—whether voluntary\nor involuntary—ma[kes] him ineligible for” asylum or\nwithholding of removal if the guard’s service involved\nassistance or participation in the persecution of another\nperson on account of a protected ground. Fedorenko,\nsupra, at 512. Here, it is undisputed that petitioner\nserved at a prison camp where guards persecuted prison­\ners because of their religious beliefs. See ante, at 2–3\n(majority opinion). It also is undisputed that petitioner\ncarried out the persecution by preventing prisoners from\nescaping and by standing guard while at least one pris­\noner died from sun exposure. Ibid. Petitioner, therefore,\n“assisted, or otherwise participated” in persecution and\nthus is statutorily disqualified from receiving asylum or\nwithholding of removal under the INA. 3\n——————\n  3 JUSTICE STEVENS also finds the language of the INA’s persecutor bar\n“plain,” but concludes that it must incorporate a culpability require­\nment because the statute applies to those whose “acts are of a ‘criminal\nnature.’ ” See ante, at 7, 9 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in\npart). I disagree. The decision to admit an alien is a matter of legisla­\ntive grace, see n. 2, supra, for which judicial review has been “consis­\ntently classified” as civil in nature, Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342\nU. S. 580, 594 (1952); see also Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, 720\n(2001) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (explaining that “ ‘an alien seeking\ninitial admission to the United States requests a privilege and has no\nconstitutional rights regarding his application, for the power to admit\nor exclude aliens is a sovereign prerogative’ ” (quoting Landon v.\nPlasencia, 459 U. S. 21, 32 (1982))). There is no warrant to read\ncriminal-law requirements into a statute that is “nonpunitive in pur­\npose and effect.” Zadvydas, supra, at 690. Further, the conclusory\npronouncement in the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner\nfor Refugees’ Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining\nRefugee Status ¶162 (reedited Jan. 1992), that “it has to be assumed,\nalthough this is not specifically stated, that the acts covered by the\npresent clause must also be of a criminal nature,” is insufficient to\nrequire criminal proof to deny withholding of removal, contra, ante, at\n                   Cite as: 555 U.

INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 329 (2001) (SCALIA,\nJ., dissenting).\n   The majority principally finds ambiguity in the statu­\ntory text because it does not include either the word “vol­\nuntary” or the word “involuntary.” See ante, at 7. But a\nstatute cannot be deemed ambiguous until the court “ex­\nhaust[s] the aid of the ‘traditional tools of statutory con­\nstruction’ ” and determines that Congress did not resolve\nthe issue under consideration. Clark v. Martinez, 543\nU. S. 371, 402 (2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (quoting\nChevron, 467 U. S., at 843, n. 9). Deeming a statute with\nbroad terms to be ambiguous for that reason alone essen­\ntially requires Congress either to obey a judicially imposed\nclear-statement rule or accept the risk that the courts may\nrefuse to give full effect to a statute’s plain meaning in the\nname of Chevron deference. Not every difficult question of\nstatutory construction amounts to a statutory gap for a\nfederal agency to fill. See ante, at 1–4 (opinion of\nSTEVENS, J.). And the Court should not, “in the name of\ndeference, abdicate its responsibility to interpret a stat­\nute” simply because it requires some effort. Global Cross\ning Telecommunications, Inc. v. Metrophones Telecommu\nnications, Inc., 550 U. S. 45, 77 (2007) (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting).\n—————— \n\n9–10 (opinion of STEVENS, J.).

HOLDER\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n    The majority makes no attempt to apply the “traditional\ntools of statutory construction” to the persecutor bar be­\nfore retreating to ambiguity. See ante, at 5–6. Rather, it\nmerely observes that Congress could have spoken more\ndirectly to the issue, which it finds sufficient to render the\nstatute ambiguous on this score. Ante, at 6. But the\nabsence of a phrase specifying that the provision applies to\nboth involuntary and voluntary conduct is not definitive\nproof of ambiguity. It is certainly correct that Congress\n“ ‘could have spoken in clearer terms,’ ” Clark, 543 U. S., at\n402 (THOMAS, J., dissenting), as it almost always can in\nany statute. However, this “proves nothing” in evaluating\nwhether the statute is ambiguous. Ibid. The question\nbefore the Court instead is whether Congress has provided\nan unambiguous answer in the plain language that it\nchose to use. Here, for the reasons just explained, the\ntraditional tools of statutory interpretation show with\n“utmost clarity,” St. Cyr, supra, at 329, that the statute\napplies regardless of the voluntariness of the alien who\nparticipates or assists in persecution.4\n    The majority also finds ambiguity based on differences\nbetween the INA and the DPA statutory bar considered in\nFedorenko. In particular, the majority points to the Fe\ndorenko Court’s reliance on a second part of the DPA\npersecutor bar, which applied to those who “ ‘voluntarily\n——————\n  4 Because this Court should not delegate the interpretation of the\n\npersecutor bar’s plain meaning to a federal agency, see Board of Gover\nnors, FRS v. Dimension Financial Corp., 474 U. S. 361, 368 (1986), it is\nlargely irrelevant whether the BIA properly relied on Fedorenko v.\nUnited States, 449 U. S. 490 (1981), in interpreting the statute, see\nante, at 9–11 (majority opinion); ante, at 2 (SCALIA, J., concurring). In\nany event, the BIA’s construction of the INA’s persecutor bar correctly\nreflected the text of the provision. There is no reason to remand the\nquestion to the agency when only one construction of the statute is\npermissible and the agency’s original decision adopted that proper\nconstruction.

S., at 495, and n. 3 (quoting\n62 Stat. 3052; emphasis added). The Court noted that\n“[u]nder traditional principles of statutory construction,\nthe deliberate omission of the word ‘voluntary’ from §2(a),”\nwhich addressed the assistance of persecution—but not\nfrom §2(b)—“compel[led] the conclusion that the statute\nmade all those who assisted in the persecution of civilians\nineligible for visas.” Id., at 512. According to the major­\nity, because the INA persecutor bar, unlike the DPA bar,\ndoes not include a provision limited by the word “voluntar­\nily” adjacent to the provision that is not so limited, the\nabsence of the adverb here cannot carry the significance\ngiven it in Fedorenko. See ante, at 7.\n   The majority’s reasoning is flawed. The mere fact that\nthe INA’s persecutor bar is not accompanied by a\nneighboring provision containing the word “voluntarily”\ndoes not negate the significance of the term’s absence\nwhen other INA provisions are explicitly limited to actions\nundertaken voluntarily. As noted above, see supra, at 7,\nthe INA imposes a voluntariness requirement in a host of\nstatutory provisions, see, e.g., 8 U. S. C. §1158(c)(2)(D)\n(terminating asylum when alien has “voluntarily” availed\nhimself     of    the    protection    of    his   country);\n§§1182(a)(3)(D)(i)–(ii) (denying admission and naturaliza­\ntion to those who have been members of, or affiliated with,\n“the Communist or any other totalitarian party” unless\nthat membership or affiliation was “involuntary”);\n§1182(d)(3)(B)(i) (denying admission to those who have\n“voluntarily and knowingly” engaged in, endorsed, es­\npoused, or persuaded others to endorse, espouse, or sup­\nport terrorist activity); §1229c(a)(1) (allowing an alien to\n“voluntarily” depart the United States); §§1424(a), (d)\n(precluding naturalization for members of certain totali­\ntarian parties, unless membership was “involuntary”);\n§1481(a) (providing for loss of nationality by “voluntarily”\n16                      NEGUSIE v.

That Congress’ explicit\nreferences to voluntariness appear in other sections of this\nparticular statutory scheme, rather than in subsections of\n§§1158 or 1231, is immaterial. Cf. Rusello, 464 U. S., at\n23; Barnhart, 534 U. S., at 452–454. And the fact that\nCongress, in the course of making structural revisions to\nthe statutory regime, eliminated the specific dichotomy\nthe Court noted in Fedorenko does not undermine the\ncritical point: The INA expressly includes a voluntariness\nrequirement in several places but does not impose such a\nrequirement in the persecution bar. Thus, the omission of\nthe word “voluntarily” from the persecutor bar in the INA\nis just as conclusive as its omission from the persecutor\nbar in the DPA. With respect to both statutes, the delib­\nerate omission “compels the conclusion that the statute\nmade all those who assisted in the persecution of civilians\nineligible for visas.” 449 U. S., at 512.\n  Finally, the majority concludes that the DPA bar is\ndistinguishable from the INA bar because the former was\nenacted in the context of the “ ‘ “crime against humanity\nthat [was] involved in the concentration camp,” ’ ” which\nwas so horrific that it is in a category all its own. Ante, at\n——————\n  5 Moreover,  in the Refugee Act of 1980, which added the persecutor\nbar to the INA, Congress separately codified its desire to “promote\nopportunities for resettlement or voluntary repatriation.” §101(a), 94\nStat. 102, note following 8 U. S. C. §1521. In 1996, when Congress\nreenacted the statutory text, it retained the persecution bar’s broad\nlanguage while again restricting other sections to voluntary conduct.\nSee IIRIRA, §304, 110 Stat. 3009–587 (relating to “voluntary depar­\nture”), §402, id., at 3009–656 (relating to “voluntary” participation in\npilot programs for confirming employment eligibility), §604, id., at\n3009–690 (providing for termination of asylum when alien “voluntarily”\ntakes certain actions).\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

In that unique\ncontext, the majority reasons, it made sense to exclude\n“even those involved in nonculpable, involuntary assis­\ntance in Nazi persecution.” Ibid. But the majority cannot\nintend to suggest that all acts of persecution during the\nSecond World War were inherently more depraved or\nreprehensible than all acts of persecution that have oc­\ncurred in the decades since the INA’s enactment.\n   Certainly, no such conclusion is compelled by the statu­\ntory text. Congress has steadfastly condemned all acts of\npersecution. See 22 U. S. C. §§6401(a)(5)–(7) (noting that\n“Congress has recognized and denounced acts of religious\npersecution,” which can be “severe and violent” and “par­\nticularly widespread, systematic, and heinous under to­\ntalitarian governments and in countries with militant\npoliticized religious majorities”); §6401(b)(5) (announcing\nthat it is the “policy of the United States” to “stan[d] with\nthe persecuted”); §501, 78 Stat. 1015 (“The Congress con­\ndemns the persecution of any persons because of their\nreligion”); Refugee Act of 1980, §101(a), 94 Stat. 102 (“The\nCongress declares that it is the historic policy of the\nUnited States to respond to the urgent needs of persons\nsubject to persecution in their homelands”). There is no\nreason to deny the INA persecutor bar its full meaning\nbased on a speculative assumption that Congress, in 1980,\ncould not have meant to oppose persecution quite as in­\ntensely as it did in the aftermath of World War II. Rather,\nthe INA’s persecutor bar naturally extends to all acts of\npersecution and, therefore, requires the denial of asylum\nand withholding of removal for “even those involved in\nnonculpable, involuntary assistance in . . . persecution.”\nAnte, at 8 (majority opinion).\n                           IV\n Because I conclude that the INA’s persecutor bar applies\nwhether or not petitioner’s assistance or participation in\n18                 NEGUSIE v.
