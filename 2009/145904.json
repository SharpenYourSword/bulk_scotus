Hazard, Attorney, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C., for petitioners.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Respondents are a group of organizations dedicated to protecting the environment. (We will refer to them collectively as \"Earth Island.\") They seek to prevent the United States Forest Service from enforcing regulations that exempt small fire-rehabilitation and timber-salvage projects from the notice, comment, and appeal process used by the Forest Service for more significant land management decisions. We must determine whether respondents have standing to challenge the regulations in the absence of a live dispute over a concrete application of those regulations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In 1992, Congress enacted the Forest Service Decisionmaking and Appeals Reform Act (Appeals Reform Act or Act), Pub.L. 102-381, Tit. III, § 322, 106 Stat. 1419, note following 16 U.S.C. § 1612. Among other things, this required the Forest Service to establish a notice, comment, and appeal process for \"proposed actions of the Forest Service concerning projects and activities implementing land and resource management plans developed under the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Forest Service's regulations implementing the Act provided that certain of its procedures would not be applied to projects that the Service considered categorically excluded from the requirement to file an environmental impact statement (EIS) or environmental assessment (EA). 36 CFR §§ 215.4(a) (notice and comment), 215.12(f) (appeal) (2008). Later amendments to the Forest Service's manual of implementing procedures, adopted by rule after notice and comment, provided that fire-rehabilitation activities on areas of less than 4,200 acres, and salvage-timber sales of 250 acres or less, did not cause a significant environmental impact and thus would be categorically exempt from the requirement to file an EIS or EA. 68 Fed.Reg. 33824 (2003) (Forest Service Handbook (FSH) 1909.15, ch. 30, § 31.2(11)); 68 Fed. Reg. 44607 (FSH 1909.15, ch. 30, § 31.2(13)). This had the effect of excluding these projects from the notice, comment, and appeal process.</p>\n<p>In the summer of 2002, fire burned a significant area of the Sequoia National Forest. In September 2003, the Service issued a decision memo approving the Burnt Ridge Project, a salvage sale of timber on 238 acres damaged by that fire. Pursuant to its categorical exclusion of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1148</span> salvage sales of less than 250 acres, the Forest Service did not provide notice in a form consistent with the Appeals Reform Act, did not provide a period of public comment, and did not make an appeal process available.</p>\n<p>In December 2003, respondents filed a complaint in the Eastern District of California, challenging the failure of the Forest Service to apply to the Burnt Ridge Project § 215.4(a) of its regulations implementing the Appeals Reform Act (requiring prior notice and comment), and § 215.12(f) of the regulations (setting forth an appeal procedure). The complaint also challenged six other Forest Service regulations implementing the Act that were not applied to the Burnt Ridge Project. They are irrelevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p>The District Court granted a preliminary injunction against the Burnt Ridge salvage-timber sale. Soon thereafter, the parties settled their dispute over the Burnt Ridge Project and the District Court concluded that \"the Burnt Ridge timber sale is not at issue in this case.\" <i>Earth Island Inst. v. Pengilly,</i> 376 F.Supp.2d 994, 999 (E.D.Cal.2005). The Government argued that, with the Burnt Ridge dispute settled, and with no other project before the court in which respondents were threatened with injury in fact, respondents lacked standing to challenge the regulations; and that absent a concrete dispute over a particular project a challenge to the regulations would not be ripe. The District Court proceeded, however, to adjudicate the merits of Earth Island's challenges. It invalidated five of the regulations (including §§ 215.4(a) and 215.12(f)), <i>id.,</i> at 1011, and entered a nationwide injunction against their application, <i>Earth Island Inst. v. Ruthenbeck</i><i>,</i> No. CIV F-03-6386 JKS, 2005 WL 5280466 *2 (Sept. 20, 2005).</p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit held that Earth Island's challenges to regulations not at issue in the Burnt Ridge Project were not ripe for adjudication because there was \"not a sufficient `case or controversy'\" before the court to sustain a facial challenge. <i>Earth Island Inst. v. Ruthenbeck,</i> 490 F.3d 687, 696 (2007) (amended opinion). It affirmed, however, the District Court's determination that §§ 215.4(a) and 215.12(f), which were applicable to the Burnt Ridge Project, were contrary to law, and upheld the nationwide injunction against their application.</p>\n<p>The Government sought review of the question whether Earth Island could challenge the regulations at issue in the Burnt Ridge Project, and if so whether a nationwide injunction was appropriate relief. We granted certiorari, 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1118, 169 L.Ed.2d 846 (2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>In limiting the judicial power to \"Cases\" and \"Controversies,\" Article III of the Constitution restricts it to the traditional role of Anglo-American courts, which is to redress or prevent actual or imminently threatened injury to persons caused by private or official violation of law. Except when necessary in the execution of that function, courts have no charter to review and revise legislative and executive action. See <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 559-560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992); <i>Los Angeles v. Lyons,</i> 461 U.S. 95, 111-112, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983). This limitation \"is founded in concern about the properand properly limited role of the courts in a democratic society.\" <i>Warth v. Seldin,</i> 422 U.S. 490, 498, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). See <i>United States v. Richardson,</i> 418 U.S. 166, 179, 94 S.Ct. 2940, 41 L.Ed.2d 678 (1974).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1149</span> The doctrine of standing is one of several doctrines that reflect this fundamental limitation. It requires federal courts to satisfy themselves that \"the plaintiff has `alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy' as to warrant <i>his</i> invocation of federal-court jurisdiction.\" 422 U.S., at 498-499, 95 S.Ct. 2197. He bears the burden of showing that he has standing for each type of relief sought. See <i>Lyons, supra,</i> at 105, 103 S.Ct. 1660. To seek injunctive relief, a plaintiff must show that he is under threat of suffering \"injury in fact\" that is concrete and particularized; the threat must be actual and imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; it must be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and it must be likely that a favorable judicial decision will prevent or redress the injury. <i>Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.,</i> 528 U.S. 167, 180-181, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000). This requirement assures that \"there is a real need to exercise the power of judicial review in order to protect the interests of the complaining party,\" <i>Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War,</i> 418 U.S. 208, 221, 94 S.Ct. 2925, 41 L.Ed.2d 706 (1974). Where that need does not exist, allowing courts to oversee legislative or executive action \"would significantly alter the allocation of power ... away from a democratic form of government,\" <i>Richardson, supra,</i> at 188, 94 S.Ct. 2940 (Powell, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>The regulations under challenge here neither require nor forbid any action on the part of respondents. The standards and procedures that they prescribe for Forest Service appeals govern only the conduct of Forest Service officials engaged in project planning. \"[W]hen the plaintiff is not himself the object of the government action or inaction he challenges, standing is not precluded, but it is ordinarily `substantially more difficult' to establish.\" <i>Defenders of Wildlife, supra,</i> at 562, 112 S.Ct. 2130. Here, respondents can demonstrate standing only if application of the regulations by the Government will affect <i>them</i> in the manner described above.</p>\n<p>It is common ground that the respondent organizations can assert the standing of their members. To establish the concrete and particularized injury that standing requires, respondents point to their members' recreational interests in the National Forests. While generalized harm to the forest or the environment will not alone support standing, if that harm in fact affects the recreational or even the mere esthetic interests of the plaintiff, that will suffice. <i>Sierra Club v. Morton,</i> 405 U.S. 727, 734-736, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972).</p>\n<p>Affidavits submitted to the District Court alleged that organization member Ara Marderosian had repeatedly visited the Burnt Ridge site, that he had imminent plans to do so again, and that his interests in viewing the flora and fauna of the area would be harmed if the Burnt Ridge Project went forward without incorporation of the ideas he would have suggested if the Forest Service had provided him an opportunity to comment. The Government concedes this was sufficient to establish Article III standing with respect to Burnt Ridge. Brief for Petitioners 28. Marderosian's threatened injury with regard to that project was originally one of the bases for the present suit. After the District Court had issued a preliminary injunction, however, the parties settled their differences on that score. Marderosian's injury in fact with regard to that project has been remedied, and it is, as the District Court pronounced, \"not at issue in this case.\" 376 F.Supp.2d, at 999. We know of no precedent for the proposition that when a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1150</span> plaintiff has sued to challenge the lawfulness of certain action or threatened action but has settled that suit, he retains standing to challenge the basis for that action (here, the regulation in the abstract), apart from any concrete application that threatens imminent harm to his interests. Such a holding would fly in the face of Article III's injury-in-fact requirement. See <i>Lyons, supra,</i> at 111, 103 S.Ct. 1660.</p>\n<p>Respondents have identified no other application of the invalidated regulations that threatens imminent and concrete harm to the interests of their members. The only other affidavit relied on was that of Jim Bensman.<sup>[*]</sup> He asserted, first, that he had suffered injury in the past from development on Forest Service land. That does not suffice for several reasons: because it was not tied to application of the challenged regulations, because it does not identify any particular site, and because it relates to past injury rather than imminent future injury that is sought to be enjoined.</p>\n<p>Bensman's affidavit further asserts that he has visited many National Forests and plans to visit several unnamed National Forests in the future. Respondents describe this as a mere failure to \"provide the name of each timber sale that affected [Bensman's] interests,\" Brief for Respondents 44. It is much more (or much less) than that. It is a failure to allege that <i>any</i> particular timber sale or other project claimed to be unlawfully subject to the regulations will impede a specific and concrete plan of Bensman's to enjoy the National Forests. The National Forests occupy more than 190 million acres, an area larger than Texas. See Meet the Forest Service, http://www.fs.fed.us/aboutus/ meetfs.shtml (as visited Feb. 27, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). There may be a chance, but is hardly a likelihood, that Bensman's wanderings will bring him to a parcel about to be affected by a project unlawfully subject to the regulations. Indeed, without further specification it is impossible to tell <i>which</i> projects are (in respondents' view) unlawfully subject to the regulations. The allegations here present a weaker likelihood of concrete harm than that which we found insufficient in <i>Lyons,</i> 461 U.S. 95, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675, where a plaintiff who alleged that he had been injured by an improper police chokehold sought injunctive relief barring use of the hold in the future. We said it was \"no more than conjecture\" that Lyons would be subjected to that chokehold upon a later encounter. <i>Id.,</i> at 108, 103 S.Ct. 1660. Here we are asked to assume not only that Bensman will stumble across a project tract unlawfully subject to the regulations, but also that the tract is about to be developed by the Forest Service in a way that harms his recreational interests, and that he would have commented on the project but for the regulation. Accepting an intention to visit the National Forests as adequate to confer standing to challenge any Government action affecting any portion of those forests would be tantamount to eliminating the requirement of concrete, particularized injury in fact.</p>\n<p>The Bensman affidavit does refer specifically to a series of projects in the Allegheny National Forest that are subject to the challenged regulations. It does not assert, however, any firm intention to visit their locations, saying only that Bensman \"`want[s] to'\" go there. Brief for Petitioners 6. This vague desire to return is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1151</span> insufficient to satisfy the requirement of imminent injury: \"Such `some day' intentionswithout any description of concrete plans, or indeed any specification of <i>when</i> the some day will bedo not support a finding of the `actual or imminent' injury that our cases require.\" <i>Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S., at 564, 112 S.Ct. 2130.</p>\n<p>Respondents argue that they have standing to bring their challenge because they have suffered procedural injury, namely that they have been denied the ability to file comments on some Forest Service actions and will continue to be so denied. But deprivation of a procedural right without some concrete interest that is affected by the deprivationa procedural right <i>in vacuo</i>is insufficient to create Article III standing. Only a \"person who has been accorded a procedural right to protect <i>his concrete interests</i> can assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 572, n. 7, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (emphasis added). Respondents alleged such injury in their challenge to the Burnt Ridge Project, claiming that but for the allegedly unlawful abridged procedures they would have been able to oppose the project that threatened to impinge on their concrete plans to observe nature in that specific area. But Burnt Ridge is now off the table.</p>\n<p>It makes no difference that the procedural right has been accorded by Congress. That can loosen the strictures of the redressability prong of our standing inquiryso that standing existed with regard to the Burnt Ridge Project, for example, despite the possibility that Earth Island's allegedly guaranteed right to comment would not be successful in persuading the Forest Service to avoid impairment of Earth Island's concrete interests. See <i>Ibid.</i> Unlike redressability, however, the requirement of injury in fact is a hard floor of Article III jurisdiction that cannot be removed by statute.</p>\n<blockquote>\"[I]t would exceed [Article III's] limitations if, at the behest of Congress and in the absence of any showing of concrete injury, we were to entertain citizen suits to vindicate the public's nonconcrete interest in the proper administration of the laws.... [T]he party bringing suit must show that the action injures him in a concrete and personal way.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 580-581[, 112 S.Ct. 2130] (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The dissent proposes a hitherto unheard-of test for organizational standing: whether, accepting the organization's self-description of the activities of its members, there is a statistical probability that some of those members are threatened with concrete injury. Since, for example, the Sierra Club asserts in its pleadings that it has more than \"`700,000 members nationwide, including thousands of members in California'\" who \"`use and enjoy the Sequoia National Forest,'\" <i>post,</i> at 1154 (opinion of BREYER, J.), it is probable (according to the dissent) that some (unidentified) members have planned to visit some (unidentified) small parcels affected by the Forest Service's procedures and will suffer (unidentified) concrete harm as a result. This novel approach to the law of organizational standing would make a mockery of our prior cases, which have required plaintiff-organizations to make specific allegations establishing that at least one identified member had suffered or would suffer harm. In <i>Defenders of Wildlife, supra,</i> at 563, 112 S.Ct. 2130, we held that the organization lacked standing because it failed to \"submit affidavits ... showing, through specific facts ... that one or more of [its] members would ... be `directly' affected\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1152</span> by the allegedly illegal activity. <i>Morton,</i> 405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636, involved the same Sierra Club that is a party in the present case, and a project in the Sequoia National Forest. The principal difference from the present case is that the challenged project was truly massive, involving the construction of motels, restaurants, swimming pools, parking lots, and other structures on 80 acres of the Forest, plus ski lifts, ski trails, and a 20-mile access highway. We did not engage in an assessment of statistical probabilities that one of the Sierra Club's members would be adversely affected, but held that the Sierra Club lacked standing. We said:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The Sierra Club failed to allege that it or its members would be affected in any of their activities or pastimes by the Disney development. Nowhere in the pleadings or affidavits did the Club state that its members use Mineral King for any purpose, much less that they use it in any way that would be significantly affected by the proposed actions of the respondents.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 735, 92 S.Ct. 1361.</blockquote>\n<p>And in <i>FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas,</i> 493 U.S. 215, 235, 110 S.Ct. 596, 107 L.Ed.2d 603 (1990), we noted that the affidavit provided by the city to establish standing would be insufficient because it did not name the individuals who were harmed by the challenged license-revocation program. This requirement of naming the affected members has never been dispensed with in light of statistical probabilities, but only where <i>all</i> the members of the organization are affected by the challenged activity. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson,</i> 357 U.S. 449, 459, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 (1958) (all organization members affected by release of membership lists).</p>\n<p>A major problem with the dissent's approach is that it accepts the organizations' self-descriptions of their membership, on the simple ground that \"no one denies\" them, <i>post,</i> at 1156. But it is well established that the court has an independent obligation to assure that standing exists, regardless of whether it is challenged by any of the parties. <i>Bender v. Williamsport Area School Dist.,</i> 475 U.S. 534, 541, 106 S.Ct. 1326, 89 L.Ed.2d 501 (1986). Without individual affidavits, how is the court to assure itself that the Sierra Club, for example, has \"`thousands of members'\" who \"`use and enjoy the Sequoia National Forest'\"? And, because to establish standing plaintiffs must show that they \"use the area affected by the challenged activity and not an area roughly in the vicinity of\" a project site, <i>Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S., at 566, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (internal quotation marks omitted), how is the court to assure itself that some of these members plan to make use of the specific sites upon which projects may take place? Or that these same individuals will find their recreation burdened by the Forest Service's use of the challenged procedures? While it is certainly possible perhaps even likelythat one individual will meet all of these criteria, that speculation does not suffice. \"Standing,\" we have said, \"is not `an ingenious academic exercise in the conceivable' ... [but] requires... a factual showing of perceptible harm.\" <i>Ibid.</i> In part because of the difficulty of verifying the facts upon which such probabilistic standing depends, the Court has required plaintiffs claiming an organizational standing to identify members who have suffered the requisite harmsurely not a difficult task here, when so many thousands are alleged to have been harmed.</p>\n<p>The dissent would have us replace the requirement of \"`imminent'\" harm, which it acknowledges our cases establish, see <i>post,</i> at 1155, with the requirement of \"`a <i>realistic</i> threat' that reoccurrence of the challenged activity would cause [the plaintiff] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1153</span> harm `in the reasonably near future,'\" <i>post,</i> at 1156. That language is taken, of course, from an opinion that did <i>not</i> find standing, so the seeming expansiveness of the test made not a bit of difference. The problem for the dissent is that the timely affidavits no more meet that requirement than they meet the usual formulation. They fail to establish that the affiants' members will <i>ever</i> visit one of the small parcels at issue.</p>\n<p>The dissent insists, however, that we should also have considered the late-filed affidavits. It invokes Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(d) (West 2008 rev. ed.), which says that \"[t]he court may permit supplementation even though the original pleading is defective in stating of a claim or defense.\" So also does Rule 21 permit joinder of parties \"at any time.\" But the latter no more permits joinder of parties, than the former permits the supplementation of the record, in the circumstances here: <i>after the trial is over, judgment has been entered, and a notice of appeal has been filed.</i> The dissent cites no instance in which \"supplementation\" has been permitted to resurrect and alter the outcome in a case that has gone to judgment, and indeed after notice of appeal had been filed. If Rule 15(b) allows additional facts to be inserted into the record after appeal has been filed, we are at the threshold of a brave new world of trial practice in which Rule 60 has been swallowed whole by Rule 15(b).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Since we have resolved this case on the ground of standing, we need not reach the Government's contention that plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the regulations are ripe for review under the Administrative Procedure Act. We likewise do not reach the question whether, if respondents prevailed, a nationwide injunction would be appropriate. And we do not disturb the dismissal of respondents' challenge to the remaining regulations, which has not been appealed.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed in part and affirmed in part.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice KENNEDY, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join in full the opinion of the Court. As the opinion explains, \"deprivation of a procedural right without some concrete interest that is affected by the deprivationa procedural right <i>in vacuo</i>is insufficient to create Article III standing.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1151. The procedural injury must \"impair a separate concrete interest.\" <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 572, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992).</p>\n<p>This case would present different considerations if Congress had sought to provide redress for a concrete injury \"giv[ing] rise to a case or controversy where none existed before.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 580, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Nothing in the statute at issue here, however, indicates Congress intended to identify or confer some interest separate and apart from a procedural right.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, with whom Justice STEVENS, Justice SOUTER, and Justice GINSBURG join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court holds that the Sierra Club and its members (along with other environmental organizations) do not suffer any \"`concrete injury'\" when the Forest Service sells timber for logging on \"many thousands\" of small (250-acre or less) woodland parcels without following legally required proceduresprocedures which, if followed, could lead the Service to cancel or to modify the sales. <i>Ante,</i> at 1151. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1154</span> Nothing in the record or the law justifies this counterintuitive conclusion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs, respondents in this case, are five environmental organizations. The Earth Island Institute, a California organization, has over 15,000 members in the United States, over 3,000 of whom \"use and enjoy the National Forests of California for recreational, educational, aesthetic, spiritual and other purposes.\" Corrected Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief in Case No. CIV-F-03-630 REC DLB (ED Cal.) ¶ 8, App. 31 (hereinafter Complaint). The Sequoia ForestKeeper, a small organization, has \"100 plus\" members who \"use the forests of the Southern Sierra Nevada for activities such as hiking, bird and animal watching, aesthetic enjoyment, quiet contemplation, fishing and scientific study.\" <i>Id.,</i> ¶ 9, at 32. Heartwood, Inc., located in Illinois and Indiana, is a coalition of environmental organizations with \"members\" who \"continually use the National Forests for the purposes of ecological health, recreation, aesthetic enjoyment, and other purposes.\" <i>Id.,</i> ¶ 10, at 33. The Center for Biological Diversity, located in Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Washington, has over 5,000 members who \"use Forest Service lands,\" and who are \"dedicated to the preservation, protection, and restoration of biological diversity, native species and ecosystems in the Western United States and elsewhere.\" <i>Ibid.,</i> ¶ 11. The Sierra Club has more than \"700,000 members nationwide, including thousands of members in California\" who \"use and enjoy the Sequoia National Forest,\" for \"outdoor recreation and scientific study of various kinds, including nature study, bird-watching, photography, fishing, canoeing, hunting, backpacking, camping, solitude, and a variety of other activities.\" <i>Id.,</i> ¶ 12, at 34.</p>\n<p>These five organizations point to a federal law that says the Forest Service \"shall establish a notice and comment process,\" along with a procedure for filing administrative \"appeals,\" for \"proposed actions... concerning projects and activities implementing land and resource management plans ....\" § 322, 106 Stat. 1419, note following 16 U.S.C. § 1612. They add that the Service has exempted from \"notice, comment, and appeal\" processes its decisions that allow, among other things, salvage-timber sales on burned forest lands of less than 250 acres in size. 36 CFR §§ 215.4(a), 215.12(f) (2008); see also 68 Fed.Reg. 44607-44608 (2003) (describing projects exempted). And they claim that the Service's refusal to provide notice, comment, and appeal procedures violates the statute. Complaint ¶¶ 105-106, App. 61.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The majority says that the plaintiffs lack <i>constitutional</i> standing to raise this claim. It holds that the dispute between the five environmental groups and the Forest Service consists simply of an abstract challenge; it does not amount to the concrete \"Cas[e]\" or \"Controvers[y]\" that the Constitution grants federal courts the power to resolve. Art. III, § 2, cl. 1. I cannot agree that this is so.</p>\n<p>To understand the <i>constitutional</i> issue that the majority decides, it may prove helpful to imagine that Congress enacted a <i>statutory</i> provision that expressly permitted environmental groups like the respondents here to bring cases just like the present one, provided (1) that the group has members who have used salvage-timber parcels in the past and are likely to do so in the future, and (2) that the group's members have opposed Forest Service <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1155</span> timber sales in the past (using notice, comment, and appeal procedures to do so) and will likely use those procedures to oppose salvage-timber sales in the future. The majority cannot, and does not, claim that such a statute would be unconstitutional. See <i>Massachusetts v. EPA,</i> 549 U.S. 497, 516-518, 127 S.Ct. 1438, 167 L.Ed.2d 248 (2007); <i>Sierra Club v. Morton,</i> 405 U.S. 727, 734-738, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972). How then can it find the present case constitutionally unauthorized?</p>\n<p>I believe the majority answers this question as follows: It recognizes, as this Court has held, that a plaintiff has constitutional standing if the plaintiff demonstrates (1) an \"`injury in fact,'\" (2) that is \"fairly traceable\" to the defendant's \"challenged action,\" and which (3) a \"favorable [judicial] decision\" will likely prevent or redress. <i>Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.,</i> 528 U.S. 167, 180-181, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000). The majority does not deny that the plaintiffs meet the latter two requirements. It focuses only upon the first, the presence of \"actual,\" as opposed to \"conjectural or hypothetical,\" injury. <i>Id.,</i> at 180, 120 S.Ct. 693. In doing so, it properly agrees that the \"organizations\" here can \"assert the standing of their members.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1149. It points out that injuries to the \"members' recreational\" or even \"mere esthetic interests... will suffice.\" <i>Ibid.</i> It does not claim that the <i>procedural</i> nature of the plaintiffs' claim makes the difference here, for it says only that \"deprivation of a procedural right <i>without some concrete interest</i>\" thereby affected, <i>i.e.,</i> \"a procedural right <i>in vacuo\"</i> would prove \"insufficient to create Article III standing.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1151 (emphasis added); see also <i>EPA,</i> 549 U.S., at 517-518, 127 S.Ct. 1438. The majority assumes, as do I, that these unlawful Forest Service procedures will lead to substantive actions, namely the sales of salvage timber on burned lands, that might not take place if the proper procedures were followed. But the majority then finds that the plaintiffs have not sufficiently demonstrated that these salvage-timber sales cause plaintiffs an actual injury, that is, harm to the recreational, aesthetic, or other environmental interests of organization members. <i>Ante,</i> at 1149-1150. To put the matter in terms of my hypothetical statute, the majority holds that the plaintiff organizations, while showing that they have members who have used salvage-timber sale parcels in the past (<i>i.e.,</i> parcels that the Service does not subject to the notice, comment, and appeal procedures required by law), have failed to show that they have members likely to use such parcels in the future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>How can the majority credibly claim that salvage-timber sales, and similar projects, are unlikely to harm the asserted interests of the members of these environmental groups? The majority apparently does so in part by arguing that the Forest Service actions are not \"imminent\"a requirement more appropriately considered in the context of ripeness or the necessity of injunctive relief. See <i>Ohio Forestry Assn., Inc. v. Sierra Club,</i> 523 U.S. 726, 734, 118 S.Ct. 1665, 140 L.Ed.2d 921 (1998). I concede that the Court has sometimes used the word \"imminent\" in the context of constitutional standing. But it has done so primarily to emphasize that the harm in questionthe harm that was not \"imminent\"was merely \"conjectural\" or \"hypothetical\" or otherwise speculative. <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). Where the Court has directly focused upon the matter, <i>i.e.,</i> where, as here, a plaintiff has <i>already</i> been subject to the injury it wishes to challenge, the Court has <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1156</span> asked whether there is a <i>realistic likelihood</i> that the challenged future conduct will, in fact, recur and harm the plaintiff. That is what the Court said in <i>Los Angeles v. Lyons,</i> 461 U.S. 95, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983), a case involving a plaintiff's attempt to enjoin police use of chokeholds. The Court wrote that the plaintiff, who had been subject to the unlawful chokehold in the past, would have had standing had he shown \"a <i>realistic</i> threat\" that reoccurrence of the challenged activity would cause him harm \"in the reasonably near future.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 107, n. 7, 108, 103 S.Ct. 1660 (emphasis added). Precedent nowhere suggests that the \"realistic threat\" standard contains identification requirements more stringent than the word \"realistic\" implies. See <i>Blum v. Yaretsky,</i> 457 U.S. 991, 1000, 102 S.Ct. 2777, 73 L.Ed.2d 534 (1982).</p>\n<p>How could the Court impose a stricter criterion? Would courts deny <i>standing</i> to a holder of a future interest in property who complains that a life tenant's waste of the land will almost inevitably hurt the value of his interestthough he will have no personal interest for several years into the future? Would courts deny <i>standing</i> to a landowner who complains that a neighbor's upstream dam constitutes a nuisanceeven if the harm to his downstream property (while bound to occur) will not occur for several years? Would courts deny <i>standing</i> to an injured person seeking a protection order from future realistic (but nongeographically specific) threats of further attacks?</p>\n<p>To the contrary, a threat of future harm may be realistic even where the plaintiff cannot specify precise times, dates, and GPS coordinates. Thus, we recently held that Massachusetts has <i>standing</i> to complain of a procedural failing, namely, EPA's failure properly to determine whether to restrict carbon dioxide emissions, even though that failing would create Massachusetts-based harm which (though likely to occur) might not occur for several decades. <i>EPA,</i> 549 U.S., at 522-523, 127 S.Ct. 1438.</p>\n<p>The Forest Service admits that it intends to conduct thousands of further salvage-timber sales and other projects exempted under the challenged regulations \"in the reasonably near future.\" See Defendants' Motion to Clarify and Amend Judgment in No. CIV-F-03-6386-JKS-DLB (ED Cal.), pp. 13-14. How then can the Court deny that the plaintiffs have shown a \"realistic\" threat that the Forest Service will continue to authorize (without the procedures claimed necessary) salvage-timber sales, and other Forest Service projects, that adversely affect the recreational, aesthetic, and environmental interests of the plaintiffs' members?</p>\n<p>Consider: Respondents allege, and the Government has conceded, that the Forest Service took wrongful actions (such as selling salvage timber) \"thousands\" of times in the two years prior to suit. <i>Id.,</i> at 6; see also <i>id.,</i> Exh. 2, Decl. of Gloria Manning, Associate Deputy Chief for National Forest System ¶ 6, p. 3 (identifying 3,377 \"proposed decisions,\" \"[a]s of July 1, 2005,\" that would be excluded from notice, comment, and appeal procedures). The Complaint alleges, and no one denies, that the organizations, the Sierra Club for example, have hundreds of thousands of members who use forests regularly across the Nation for recreational, scientific, aesthetic, and environmental purposes. Complaint ¶¶ 8-12, App. 31-34. The Complaint further alleges, and no one denies, that these organizations (and their members), believing that actions such as salvage-timber sales harm those interests, regularly oppose salvage-timber sales (and similar actions) in proceedings before the agency. <i>Ibid.</i> And the Complaint alleges, and no <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1157</span> one denies, that the organizations intend to continue to express their opposition to such actions in those proceedings in the future. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Consider further: The affidavit of a member of Sequoia ForestKeeper, Ara Marderosian, attached to the Complaint, specifies that Marderosian had visited the Burnt Ridge Project site in the past and intended to return. The majority concedes that this is sufficient to show that Marderosian had standing to challenge the Burnt Ridge Project. The majority must therefore agree that \"at least one identified member ha[s] suffered ... harm.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1151. Why then does it find insufficient the affidavit, also attached to the Complaint, of Jim Bensman, a member of Heartwood, Inc.? That affidavit states, among other things, that Bensman has visited 70 National Forests, that he has visited some of those forests \"hundreds of times,\" that he has often visited the Allegheny National Forest in the past, that he has \"probably commented on a thousand\" Forest Service projects including salvage-timber sale proposals, that he intends to continue to comment on similar Forest Service proposals, and that the Forest Service plans in the future to conduct salvage-timber sales on 20 parcels in the Allegheny National Forestone of the forests he has visited in the past. ¶¶ 6, 13, App. E to Pet. for Cert. 68a, 69a, 71a.</p>\n<p>The Bensman affidavit does not say <i>which particular</i> sites will be affected by future Forest Service projects, but the Service itself has conceded that it will conduct thousands of exempted projects in the future. Why is more specificity needed to show a \"realistic\" threat that a project will impact land Bensman uses? To know, virtually for certain, that snow will fall in New England this winter is not to know the name of each particular town where it is bound to arrive. The law of standing does not require the latter kind of specificity. How could it? And <i>Sierra Club v. Morton,</i> 405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636, on which the majority so heavily relies, involved plaintiffs who challenged (true, a \"massive\") development, but only on a single previously determined site, about 80 acres in size, in a portion of the forest with a \"limited ... number of visitors.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 728, 92 S.Ct. 1361. The Court's unwillingness to infer harm to the Sierra Club's members there does not demand a similar unwillingness here, where the challenge is to procedures affecting \"thousands\" of sites, involving hundreds of times as much acreage, where the precise location of each may not yet be known. In <i>Sierra Club, ibid.,</i> it may have been unreasonable simply to assume that members would suffer an \"injury in fact.\" But here, given the very different factual circumstances, it is unreasonable to believe they would not.</p>\n<p>Whatever doubt may remain is settled by the affidavits the plaintiffs submitted after the Burnt Ridge dispute was settled (while the other claims in the Complaint remained alive). The majority says it will not consider those affidavits because they were submitted \"[a]fter the District Court had entered judgment.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1150, n. But the plaintiffs submitted the affidavits after judgment (in opposition to the Government's motion for a stay) because the Burnt Ridge dispute on which they had relied to show standing at the outset of suit had by that point been settled. No longer wishing to rely solely on evidence of their members' interest in that particular project, the plaintiff organizations submitted several other affidavits. Why describe this perfectly sensible response to the settlement of some of the Complaint's claims as a \"retroactiv[e]\" attempt to \"me[e]t the challenge to their standing at the time of judgment\"? <i>Ibid.</i> In fact, the Government did not challenge standing until that point, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1158</span> so of course respondents (who all agree had standing at the outset) did not respond with affidavits until laterwhen their standing was challenged. This can hardly be characterized as an attempt to \"resurrect and alter the outcome\" in the case. <i>Ante,</i> at 1153. Regardless, the Constitution does not bar the filing of further affidavits, nor does any statute. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure contain no such bar. Indeed, those Rules provide a judge with liberal discretion to permit a plaintiff to amend a complainteven after one dispute (of several) is settled. So why would they not permit the filing of affidavitsat least with the judge's permission? See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(d) (\"The court may permit supplementation even though the original pleading is defective in stating a claim or defense\").</p>\n<p>The affidavits in question describe a number of then-pending Forest Service projects, all excluded from notice, comment, and appeal under the Forest Service regulations and all scheduled to take place on parcels that the plaintiff organizations' members use. Erik Ryberg, for example, a member of the Center for Biological Diversity, described in his affidavit a proposed logging project scheduled for the Payette National Forestan area with which he is \"personally familiar.\" ¶ 6, App. 90. A second affidavit filed by Jim Bensman described a salvage-timber sale scheduled for the Hoosier National Forestan area Bensman had visited \"multiple times\" and to which he planned to return in the coming weeksand one planned for the Daniel Boone National Forestalso used by Bensmanwhich would \"impact [Heartwood's] members['] use of the areas.\" ¶¶ 8-9, <i>id.,</i> at 85-86. The affidavits also describe, among other things, the frequency with which the organizations' members routinely file administrative appeals of salvage-timber sales and identify a number of proposed and pending projects that certain Sierra Club members wished to appeal. See Decl. of Rene Voss ¶ 3, <i>id.,</i> at 94 (describing a proposed logging and prescribed burn planned for the Gallatin National Forest); Decl. of Craig Thomas ¶¶ 3, 13, <i>id.,</i> at 95, 98 (describing Thomas' \"use\" and \"enjoy[ment]\" of the \"Sierra Nevada national forests for recreational, aesthetic, scientific and professional pursuits,\" and attesting to \"eighteen separate logging projects,\" all categorically excluded, proposed for one such forest tract).</p>\n<p>These allegations and affidavits more than adequately show a \"realistic threat\" of injury to plaintiffs brought about by reoccurrence of the challenged conductconduct that the Forest Service thinks lawful and <i>admits</i> will reoccur. Many years ago the Ninth Circuit warned that a court should not \"be blind to what must be necessarily known to every intelligent person.\" <i>In re Wo Lee,</i> 26 F. 471, 475 (1886). Applying that standard, I would find standing here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>I recognize that the Government raises other claims and bases upon which to deny standing or to hold that the case is not ripe for adjudication. I believe that these arguments are without merit. But because the majority does not discuss them here, I shall not do so either.</p>\n<p>With respect, I dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  After the District Court had entered judgment, and after the Government had filed its notice of appeal, respondents submitted additional affidavits to the District Court. We do not consider these.

(We will refer to them collectively as \"Earth Island.\") They seek to prevent the United States Forest Service from enforcing regulations that exempt small fire-rehabilitation and timber-salvage projects from the notice, comment, and appeal process used by the Forest Service for more significant land management decisions. We must determine whether respondents have standing to challenge the regulations in the absence of a live dispute over a concrete application of those regulations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In 1992, Congress enacted the Forest Service Decisionmaking and Appeals Reform Act (Appeals Reform Act or Act), Pub.L. 102-381, Tit. III, § 322, 106 Stat. 1419, note following 16 U.S.C. § 1612. Among other things, this required the Forest Service to establish a notice, comment, and appeal process for \"proposed actions of the Forest Service concerning projects and activities implementing land and resource management plans developed under the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Forest Service's regulations implementing the Act provided that certain of its procedures would not be applied to projects that the Service considered categorically excluded from the requirement to file an environmental impact statement (EIS) or environmental assessment (EA). 36 CFR §§ 215.4(a) (notice and comment), 215.12(f) (appeal) (2008). Later amendments to the Forest Service's manual of implementing procedures, adopted by rule after notice and comment, provided that fire-rehabilitation activities on areas of less than 4,200 acres, and salvage-timber sales of 250 acres or less, did not cause a significant environmental impact and thus would be categorically exempt from the requirement to file an EIS or EA. 68 Fed.Reg. 33824 (2003) (Forest Service Handbook (FSH) 1909.15, ch. 30, § 31.2(11)); 68 Fed. Reg. 44607 (FSH 1909.15, ch. 30, § 31.2(13)). This had the effect of excluding these projects from the notice, comment, and appeal process.</p>\n<p>In the summer of 2002, fire burned a significant area of the Sequoia National Forest. In September 2003, the Service issued a decision memo approving the Burnt Ridge Project, a salvage sale of timber on 238 acres damaged by that fire. Pursuant to its categorical exclusion of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1148</span> salvage sales of less than 250 acres, the Forest Service did not provide notice in a form consistent with the Appeals Reform Act, did not provide a period of public comment, and did not make an appeal process available.</p>\n<p>In December 2003, respondents filed a complaint in the Eastern District of California, challenging the failure of the Forest Service to apply to the Burnt Ridge Project § 215.4(a) of its regulations implementing the Appeals Reform Act (requiring prior notice and comment), and § 215.12(f) of the regulations (setting forth an appeal procedure). The complaint also challenged six other Forest Service regulations implementing the Act that were not applied to the Burnt Ridge Project. They are irrelevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p>The District Court granted a preliminary injunction against the Burnt Ridge salvage-timber sale. Soon thereafter, the parties settled their dispute over the Burnt Ridge Project and the District Court concluded that \"the Burnt Ridge timber sale is not at issue in this case.\" <i>Earth Island Inst. v. Pengilly,</i> 376 F.Supp.2d 994, 999 (E.D.Cal.2005). The Government argued that, with the Burnt Ridge dispute settled, and with no other project before the court in which respondents were threatened with injury in fact, respondents lacked standing to challenge the regulations; and that absent a concrete dispute over a particular project a challenge to the regulations would not be ripe. The District Court proceeded, however, to adjudicate the merits of Earth Island's challenges. It invalidated five of the regulations (including §§ 215.4(a) and 215.12(f)), <i>id.,</i> at 1011, and entered a nationwide injunction against their application, <i>Earth Island Inst. v. Ruthenbeck</i><i>,</i> No. CIV F-03-6386 JKS, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5280466</span></span> *2 (Sept. 20, 2005).</p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit held that Earth Island's challenges to regulations not at issue in the Burnt Ridge Project were not ripe for adjudication because there was \"not a sufficient `case or controversy'\" before the court to sustain a facial challenge. <i>Earth Island Inst. v. Ruthenbeck,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"798123\"><a href=\"/opinion/798123/earth-island-institute-sequoia-forestkeeper-a-cali/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span>, 696 (2007) (amended opinion). It affirmed, however, the District Court's determination that §§ 215.4(a) and 215.12(f), which were applicable to the Burnt Ridge Project, were contrary to law, and upheld the nationwide injunction against their application.</p>\n<p>The Government sought review of the question whether Earth Island could challenge the regulations at issue in the Burnt Ridge Project, and if so whether a nationwide injunction was appropriate relief. We granted certiorari, 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1118, 169 L.Ed.2d 846 (2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>In limiting the judicial power to \"Cases\" and \"Controversies,\" Article III of the Constitution restricts it to the traditional role of Anglo-American courts, which is to redress or prevent actual or imminently threatened injury to persons caused by private or official violation of law. Except when necessary in the execution of that function, courts have no charter to review and revise legislative and executive action. See <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span>, 559-560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992); <i>Los Angeles v.

It requires federal courts to satisfy themselves that \"the plaintiff has `alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy' as to warrant <i>his</i> invocation of federal-court jurisdiction.\" 422 U.S., at 498-499, 95 S.Ct. 2197. He bears the burden of showing that he has standing for each type of relief sought. See <i>Lyons, supra,</i> at 105, 103 S.Ct. 1660. To seek injunctive relief, a plaintiff must show that he is under threat of suffering \"injury in fact\" that is concrete and particularized; the threat must be actual and imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; it must be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and it must be likely that a favorable judicial decision will prevent or redress the injury. <i>Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118329\"><a href=\"/opinion/118329/friends-of-earth-inc-v-laidlaw-environmental-servi/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>, 180-181, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000). This requirement assures that \"there is a real need to exercise the power of judicial review in order to protect the interests of the complaining party,\" <i>Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109087\"><a href=\"/opinion/109087/schlesinger-v-reservists-comm-to-stop-the-war/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span>, 221, 94 S.Ct. 2925, 41 L.Ed.2d 706 (1974). Where that need does not exist, allowing courts to oversee legislative or executive action \"would significantly alter the allocation of power ... away from a democratic form of government,\" <i>Richardson, supra,</i> at 188, 94 S.Ct. 2940 (Powell, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>The regulations under challenge here neither require nor forbid any action on the part of respondents. The standards and procedures that they prescribe for Forest Service appeals govern only the conduct of Forest Service officials engaged in project planning. \"[W]hen the plaintiff is not himself the object of the government action or inaction he challenges, standing is not precluded, but it is ordinarily `substantially more difficult' to establish.\" <i>Defenders of Wildlife, supra,</i> at 562, 112 S.Ct. 2130. Here, respondents can demonstrate standing only if application of the regulations by the Government will affect <i>them</i> in the manner described above.</p>\n<p>It is common ground that the respondent organizations can assert the standing of their members. To establish the concrete and particularized injury that standing requires, respondents point to their members' recreational interests in the National Forests. While generalized harm to the forest or the environment will not alone support standing, if that harm in fact affects the recreational or even the mere esthetic interests of the plaintiff, that will suffice. <i>Sierra Club v. Morton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108502\"><a href=\"/opinion/108502/sierra-club-v-morton/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></a></span>, 734-736, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972).</p>\n<p>Affidavits submitted to the District Court alleged that organization member Ara Marderosian had repeatedly visited the Burnt Ridge site, that he had imminent plans to do so again, and that his interests in viewing the flora and fauna of the area would be harmed if the Burnt Ridge Project went forward without incorporation of the ideas he would have suggested if the Forest Service had provided him an opportunity to comment. The Government concedes this was sufficient to establish Article III standing with respect to Burnt Ridge. Brief for Petitioners 28. Marderosian's threatened injury with regard to that project was originally one of the bases for the present suit. After the District Court had issued a preliminary injunction, however, the parties settled their differences on that score. Marderosian's injury in fact with regard to that project has been remedied, and it is, as the District Court pronounced, \"not at issue in this case.\" 376 F.Supp.2d, at 999. We know of no precedent for the proposition that when a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1150</span> plaintiff has sued to challenge the lawfulness of certain action or threatened action but has settled that suit, he retains standing to challenge the basis for that action (here, the regulation in the abstract), apart from any concrete application that threatens imminent harm to his interests. Such a holding would fly in the face of Article III's injury-in-fact requirement. See <i>Lyons, supra,</i> at 111, 103 S.Ct. 1660.</p>\n<p>Respondents have identified no other application of the invalidated regulations that threatens imminent and concrete harm to the interests of their members. The only other affidavit relied on was that of Jim Bensman.<sup>[*]</sup> He asserted, first, that he had suffered injury in the past from development on Forest Service land. That does not suffice for several reasons: because it was not tied to application of the challenged regulations, because it does not identify any particular site, and because it relates to past injury rather than imminent future injury that is sought to be enjoined.</p>\n<p>Bensman's affidavit further asserts that he has visited many National Forests and plans to visit several unnamed National Forests in the future. Respondents describe this as a mere failure to \"provide the name of each timber sale that affected [Bensman's] interests,\" Brief for Respondents 44. It is much more (or much less) than that. It is a failure to allege that <i>any</i> particular timber sale or other project claimed to be unlawfully subject to the regulations will impede a specific and concrete plan of Bensman's to enjoy the National Forests. The National Forests occupy more than 190 million acres, an area larger than Texas.

There may be a chance, but is hardly a likelihood, that Bensman's wanderings will bring him to a parcel about to be affected by a project unlawfully subject to the regulations. Indeed, without further specification it is impossible to tell <i>which</i> projects are (in respondents' view) unlawfully subject to the regulations. The allegations here present a weaker likelihood of concrete harm than that which we found insufficient in <i>Lyons,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110916\"><a href=\"/opinion/110916/los-angeles-v-lyons/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span>, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675, where a plaintiff who alleged that he had been injured by an improper police chokehold sought injunctive relief barring use of the hold in the future. We said it was \"no more than conjecture\" that Lyons would be subjected to that chokehold upon a later encounter. <i>Id.,</i> at 108, 103 S.Ct. 1660. Here we are asked to assume not only that Bensman will stumble across a project tract unlawfully subject to the regulations, but also that the tract is about to be developed by the Forest Service in a way that harms his recreational interests, and that he would have commented on the project but for the regulation. Accepting an intention to visit the National Forests as adequate to confer standing to challenge any Government action affecting any portion of those forests would be tantamount to eliminating the requirement of concrete, particularized injury in fact.</p>\n<p>The Bensman affidavit does refer specifically to a series of projects in the Allegheny National Forest that are subject to the challenged regulations. It does not assert, however, any firm intention to visit their locations, saying only that Bensman \"`want[s] to'\" go there. Brief for Petitioners 6. This vague desire to return is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1151</span> insufficient to satisfy the requirement of imminent injury: \"Such `some day' intentionswithout any description of concrete plans, or indeed any specification of <i>when</i> the some day will bedo not support a finding of the `actual or imminent' injury that our cases require.\" <i>Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S., at 564, 112 S.Ct. 2130.</p>\n<p>Respondents argue that they have standing to bring their challenge because they have suffered procedural injury, namely that they have been denied the ability to file comments on some Forest Service actions and will continue to be so denied. But deprivation of a procedural right without some concrete interest that is affected by the deprivationa procedural right <i>in vacuo</i>is insufficient to create Article III standing. Only a \"person who has been accorded a procedural right to protect <i>his concrete interests</i> can assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 572, n. 7, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (emphasis added). Respondents alleged such injury in their challenge to the Burnt Ridge Project, claiming that but for the allegedly unlawful abridged procedures they would have been able to oppose the project that threatened to impinge on their concrete plans to observe nature in that specific area. But Burnt Ridge is now off the table.</p>\n<p>It makes no difference that the procedural right has been accorded by Congress. That can loosen the strictures of the redressability prong of our standing inquiryso that standing existed with regard to the Burnt Ridge Project, for example, despite the possibility that Earth Island's allegedly guaranteed right to comment would not be successful in persuading the Forest Service to avoid impairment of Earth Island's concrete interests. See <i>Ibid.</i> Unlike redressability, however, the requirement of injury in fact is a hard floor of Article III jurisdiction that cannot be removed by statute.</p>\n<blockquote>\"[I]t would exceed [Article III's] limitations if, at the behest of Congress and in the absence of any showing of concrete injury, we were to entertain citizen suits to vindicate the public's nonconcrete interest in the proper administration of the laws.... [T]he party bringing suit must show that the action injures him in a concrete and personal way.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 580-581[, 112 S.Ct. 2130] (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The dissent proposes a hitherto unheard-of test for organizational standing: whether, accepting the organization's self-description of the activities of its members, there is a statistical probability that some of those members are threatened with concrete injury. Since, for example, the Sierra Club asserts in its pleadings that it has more than \"`700,000 members nationwide, including thousands of members in California'\" who \"`use and enjoy the Sequoia National Forest,'\" <i>post,</i> at 1154 (opinion of BREYER, J.), it is probable (according to the dissent) that some (unidentified) members have planned to visit some (unidentified) small parcels affected by the Forest Service's procedures and will suffer (unidentified) concrete harm as a result. This novel approach to the law of organizational standing would make a mockery of our prior cases, which have required plaintiff-organizations to make specific allegations establishing that at least one identified member had suffered or would suffer harm. In <i>Defenders of Wildlife, supra,</i> at 563, 112 S.Ct. 2130, we held that the organization lacked standing because it failed to \"submit affidavits ... showing, through specific facts ... that one or more of [its] members would ... be `directly' affected\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1152</span> by the allegedly illegal activity. <i>Morton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108502\"><a href=\"/opinion/108502/sierra-club-v-morton/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></a></span>, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636, involved the same Sierra Club that is a party in the present case, and a project in the Sequoia National Forest. The principal difference from the present case is that the challenged project was truly massive, involving the construction of motels, restaurants, swimming pools, parking lots, and other structures on 80 acres of the Forest, plus ski lifts, ski trails, and a 20-mile access highway. We did not engage in an assessment of statistical probabilities that one of the Sierra Club's members would be adversely affected, but held that the Sierra Club lacked standing. We said:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The Sierra Club failed to allege that it or its members would be affected in any of their activities or pastimes by the Disney development. Nowhere in the pleadings or affidavits did the Club state that its members use Mineral King for any purpose, much less that they use it in any way that would be significantly affected by the proposed actions of the respondents.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 735, 92 S.Ct. 1361.</blockquote>\n<p>And in <i>FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112348\"><a href=\"/opinion/112348/fwpbs-inc-v-dallas/\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span>, 235, 110 S.Ct. 596, 107 L.Ed.2d 603 (1990), we noted that the affidavit provided by the city to establish standing would be insufficient because it did not name the individuals who were harmed by the challenged license-revocation program. This requirement of naming the affected members has never been dispensed with in light of statistical probabilities, but only where <i>all</i> the members of the organization are affected by the challenged activity. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105746\"><a href=\"/opinion/105746/naacp-v-alabama-ex-rel-patterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span>, 459, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 (1958) (all organization members affected by release of membership lists).</p>\n<p>A major problem with the dissent's approach is that it accepts the organizations' self-descriptions of their membership, on the simple ground that \"no one denies\" them, <i>post,</i> at 1156. But it is well established that the court has an independent obligation to assure that standing exists, regardless of whether it is challenged by any of the parties. <i>Bender v. Williamsport Area School Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111617\"><a href=\"/opinion/111617/bender-v-williamsport-area-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">534</span></a></span>, 541, 106 S.Ct. 1326, 89 L.Ed.2d 501 (1986). Without individual affidavits, how is the court to assure itself that the Sierra Club, for example, has \"`thousands of members'\" who \"`use and enjoy the Sequoia National Forest'\"? And, because to establish standing plaintiffs must show that they \"use the area affected by the challenged activity and not an area roughly in the vicinity of\" a project site, <i>Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S., at 566, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (internal quotation marks omitted), how is the court to assure itself that some of these members plan to make use of the specific sites upon which projects may take place? Or that these same individuals will find their recreation burdened by the Forest Service's use of the challenged procedures? While it is certainly possible perhaps even likelythat one individual will meet all of these criteria, that speculation does not suffice. \"Standing,\" we have said, \"is not `an ingenious academic exercise in the conceivable' ... [but] requires... a factual showing of perceptible harm.\" <i>Ibid.</i> In part because of the difficulty of verifying the facts upon which such probabilistic standing depends, the Court has required plaintiffs claiming an organizational standing to identify members who have suffered the requisite harmsurely not a difficult task here, when so many thousands are alleged to have been harmed.</p>\n<p>The dissent would have us replace the requirement of \"`imminent'\" harm, which it acknowledges our cases establish, see <i>post,</i> at 1155, with the requirement of \"`a <i>realistic</i> threat' that reoccurrence of the challenged activity would cause [the plaintiff] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1153</span> harm `in the reasonably near future,'\" <i>post,</i> at 1156. That language is taken, of course, from an opinion that did <i>not</i> find standing, so the seeming expansiveness of the test made not a bit of difference. The problem for the dissent is that the timely affidavits no more meet that requirement than they meet the usual formulation. They fail to establish that the affiants' members will <i>ever</i> visit one of the small parcels at issue.</p>\n<p>The dissent insists, however, that we should also have considered the late-filed affidavits. It invokes Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(d) (West 2008 rev. ed.), which says that \"[t]he court may permit supplementation even though the original pleading is defective in stating of a claim or defense.\" So also does Rule 21 permit joinder of parties \"at any time.\" But the latter no more permits joinder of parties, than the former permits the supplementation of the record, in the circumstances here: <i>after the trial is over, judgment has been entered, and a notice of appeal has been filed.</i> The dissent cites no instance in which \"supplementation\" has been permitted to resurrect and alter the outcome in a case that has gone to judgment, and indeed after notice of appeal had been filed. If Rule 15(b) allows additional facts to be inserted into the record after appeal has been filed, we are at the threshold of a brave new world of trial practice in which Rule 60 has been swallowed whole by Rule 15(b).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Since we have resolved this case on the ground of standing, we need not reach the Government's contention that plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the regulations are ripe for review under the Administrative Procedure Act. We likewise do not reach the question whether, if respondents prevailed, a nationwide injunction would be appropriate. And we do not disturb the dismissal of respondents' challenge to the remaining regulations, which has not been appealed.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed in part and affirmed in part.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice KENNEDY, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join in full the opinion of the Court. As the opinion explains, \"deprivation of a procedural right without some concrete interest that is affected by the deprivationa procedural right <i>in vacuo</i>is insufficient to create Article III standing.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1151. The procedural injury must \"impair a separate concrete interest.\" <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span>, 572, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992).</p>\n<p>This case would present different considerations if Congress had sought to provide redress for a concrete injury \"giv[ing] rise to a case or controversy where none existed before.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 580, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Nothing in the statute at issue here, however, indicates Congress intended to identify or confer some interest separate and apart from a procedural right.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, with whom Justice STEVENS, Justice SOUTER, and Justice GINSBURG join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court holds that the Sierra Club and its members (along with other environmental organizations) do not suffer any \"`concrete injury'\" when the Forest Service sells timber for logging on \"many thousands\" of small (250-acre or less) woodland parcels without following legally required proceduresprocedures which, if followed, could lead the Service to cancel or to modify the sales. <i>Ante,</i> at 1151. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1154</span> Nothing in the record or the law justifies this counterintuitive conclusion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs, respondents in this case, are five environmental organizations. The Earth Island Institute, a California organization, has over 15,000 members in the United States, over 3,000 of whom \"use and enjoy the National Forests of California for recreational, educational, aesthetic, spiritual and other purposes.\" Corrected Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief in Case No. CIV-F-03-630 REC DLB (ED Cal.) ¶ 8, App. 31 (hereinafter Complaint). The Sequoia ForestKeeper, a small organization, has \"100 plus\" members who \"use the forests of the Southern Sierra Nevada for activities such as hiking, bird and animal watching, aesthetic enjoyment, quiet contemplation, fishing and scientific study.\" <i>Id.,</i> ¶ 9, at 32. Heartwood, Inc., located in Illinois and Indiana, is a coalition of environmental organizations with \"members\" who \"continually use the National Forests for the purposes of ecological health, recreation, aesthetic enjoyment, and other purposes.\" <i>Id.,</i> ¶ 10, at 33. The Center for Biological Diversity, located in Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Washington, has over 5,000 members who \"use Forest Service lands,\" and who are \"dedicated to the preservation, protection, and restoration of biological diversity, native species and ecosystems in the Western United States and elsewhere.\" <i>Ibid.,</i> ¶ 11. The Sierra Club has more than \"700,000 members nationwide, including thousands of members in California\" who \"use and enjoy the Sequoia National Forest,\" for \"outdoor recreation and scientific study of various kinds, including nature study, bird-watching, photography, fishing, canoeing, hunting, backpacking, camping, solitude, and a variety of other activities.\" <i>Id.,</i> ¶ 12, at 34.</p>\n<p>These five organizations point to a federal law that says the Forest Service \"shall establish a notice and comment process,\" along with a procedure for filing administrative \"appeals,\" for \"proposed actions... concerning projects and activities implementing land and resource management plans ....\" § 322, 106 Stat. 1419, note following 16 U.S.C. § 1612. They add that the Service has exempted from \"notice, comment, and appeal\" processes its decisions that allow, among other things, salvage-timber sales on burned forest lands of less than 250 acres in size. 36 CFR §§ 215.4(a), 215.12(f) (2008); see also 68 Fed.Reg. 44607-44608 (2003) (describing projects exempted). And they claim that the Service's refusal to provide notice, comment, and appeal procedures violates the statute. Complaint ¶¶ 105-106, App. 61.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The majority says that the plaintiffs lack <i>constitutional</i> standing to raise this claim. It holds that the dispute between the five environmental groups and the Forest Service consists simply of an abstract challenge; it does not amount to the concrete \"Cas[e]\" or \"Controvers[y]\" that the Constitution grants federal courts the power to resolve. Art. III, § 2, cl. 1. I cannot agree that this is so.</p>\n<p>To understand the <i>constitutional</i> issue that the majority decides, it may prove helpful to imagine that Congress enacted a <i>statutory</i> provision that expressly permitted environmental groups like the respondents here to bring cases just like the present one, provided (1) that the group has members who have used salvage-timber parcels in the past and are likely to do so in the future, and (2) that the group's members have opposed Forest Service <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1155</span> timber sales in the past (using notice, comment, and appeal procedures to do so) and will likely use those procedures to oppose salvage-timber sales in the future. The majority cannot, and does not, claim that such a statute would be unconstitutional. See <i>Massachusetts v. EPA,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145749\"><a href=\"/opinion/145749/massachusetts-v-epa/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span>, 516-518, 127 S.Ct. 1438, 167 L.Ed.2d 248 (2007); <i>Sierra Club v. Morton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108502\"><a href=\"/opinion/108502/sierra-club-v-morton/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></a></span>, 734-738, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972). How then can it find the present case constitutionally unauthorized?</p>\n<p>I believe the majority answers this question as follows: It recognizes, as this Court has held, that a plaintiff has constitutional standing if the plaintiff demonstrates (1) an \"`injury in fact,'\" (2) that is \"fairly traceable\" to the defendant's \"challenged action,\" and which (3) a \"favorable [judicial] decision\" will likely prevent or redress. <i>Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118329\"><a href=\"/opinion/118329/friends-of-earth-inc-v-laidlaw-environmental-servi/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>, 180-181, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000). The majority does not deny that the plaintiffs meet the latter two requirements. It focuses only upon the first, the presence of \"actual,\" as opposed to \"conjectural or hypothetical,\" injury. <i>Id.,</i> at 180, 120 S.Ct. 693. In doing so, it properly agrees that the \"organizations\" here can \"assert the standing of their members.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1149. It points out that injuries to the \"members' recreational\" or even \"mere esthetic interests... will suffice.\" <i>Ibid.</i> It does not claim that the <i>procedural</i> nature of the plaintiffs' claim makes the difference here, for it says only that \"deprivation of a procedural right <i>without some concrete interest</i>\" thereby affected, <i>i.e.,</i> \"a procedural right <i>in vacuo\"</i> would prove \"insufficient to create Article III standing.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1151 (emphasis added); see also <i>EPA,</i> 549 U.S., at 517-518, 127 S.Ct. 1438. The majority assumes, as do I, that these unlawful Forest Service procedures will lead to substantive actions, namely the sales of salvage timber on burned lands, that might not take place if the proper procedures were followed. But the majority then finds that the plaintiffs have not sufficiently demonstrated that these salvage-timber sales cause plaintiffs an actual injury, that is, harm to the recreational, aesthetic, or other environmental interests of organization members. <i>Ante,</i> at 1149-1150. To put the matter in terms of my hypothetical statute, the majority holds that the plaintiff organizations, while showing that they have members who have used salvage-timber sale parcels in the past (<i>i.e.,</i> parcels that the Service does not subject to the notice, comment, and appeal procedures required by law), have failed to show that they have members likely to use such parcels in the future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>How can the majority credibly claim that salvage-timber sales, and similar projects, are unlikely to harm the asserted interests of the members of these environmental groups? The majority apparently does so in part by arguing that the Forest Service actions are not \"imminent\"a requirement more appropriately considered in the context of ripeness or the necessity of injunctive relief. See <i>Ohio Forestry Assn., Inc. v. Sierra Club,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118210\"><a href=\"/opinion/118210/ohio-forestry-assn-inc-v-sierra-club/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">726</span></a></span>, 734, 118 S.Ct. 1665, 140 L.Ed.2d 921 (1998). I concede that the Court has sometimes used the word \"imminent\" in the context of constitutional standing. But it has done so primarily to emphasize that the harm in questionthe harm that was not \"imminent\"was merely \"conjectural\" or \"hypothetical\" or otherwise speculative. <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span>, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). Where the Court has directly focused upon the matter, <i>i.e.,</i> where, as here, a plaintiff has <i>already</i> been subject to the injury it wishes to challenge, the Court has <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1156</span> asked whether there is a <i>realistic likelihood</i> that the challenged future conduct will, in fact, recur and harm the plaintiff. That is what the Court said in <i>Los Angeles v. Lyons,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110916\"><a href=\"/opinion/110916/los-angeles-v-lyons/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span>, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983), a case involving a plaintiff's attempt to enjoin police use of chokeholds. The Court wrote that the plaintiff, who had been subject to the unlawful chokehold in the past, would have had standing had he shown \"a <i>realistic</i> threat\" that reoccurrence of the challenged activity would cause him harm \"in the reasonably near future.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 107, n. 7, 108, 103 S.Ct. 1660 (emphasis added). Precedent nowhere suggests that the \"realistic threat\" standard contains identification requirements more stringent than the word \"realistic\" implies. See <i>Blum v. Yaretsky,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110768\"><a href=\"/opinion/110768/blum-v-yaretsky/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">991</span></a></span>, 1000, 102 S.Ct. 2777, 73 L.Ed.2d 534 (1982).</p>\n<p>How could the Court impose a stricter criterion? Would courts deny <i>standing</i> to a holder of a future interest in property who complains that a life tenant's waste of the land will almost inevitably hurt the value of his interestthough he will have no personal interest for several years into the future? Would courts deny <i>standing</i> to a landowner who complains that a neighbor's upstream dam constitutes a nuisanceeven if the harm to his downstream property (while bound to occur) will not occur for several years? Would courts deny <i>standing</i> to an injured person seeking a protection order from future realistic (but nongeographically specific) threats of further attacks?</p>\n<p>To the contrary, a threat of future harm may be realistic even where the plaintiff cannot specify precise times, dates, and GPS coordinates. Thus, we recently held that Massachusetts has <i>standing</i> to complain of a procedural failing, namely, EPA's failure properly to determine whether to restrict carbon dioxide emissions, even though that failing would create Massachusetts-based harm which (though likely to occur) might not occur for several decades. <i>EPA,</i> 549 U.S., at 522-523, 127 S.Ct. 1438.</p>\n<p>The Forest Service admits that it intends to conduct thousands of further salvage-timber sales and other projects exempted under the challenged regulations \"in the reasonably near future.\" See Defendants' Motion to Clarify and Amend Judgment in No. CIV-F-03-6386-JKS-DLB (ED Cal.), pp. 13-14. How then can the Court deny that the plaintiffs have shown a \"realistic\" threat that the Forest Service will continue to authorize (without the procedures claimed necessary) salvage-timber sales, and other Forest Service projects, that adversely affect the recreational, aesthetic, and environmental interests of the plaintiffs' members?</p>\n<p>Consider: Respondents allege, and the Government has conceded, that the Forest Service took wrongful actions (such as selling salvage timber) \"thousands\" of times in the two years prior to suit. <i>Id.,</i> at 6; see also <i>id.,</i> Exh. 2, Decl. of Gloria Manning, Associate Deputy Chief for National Forest System ¶ 6, p. 3 (identifying 3,377 \"proposed decisions,\" \"[a]s of July 1, 2005,\" that would be excluded from notice, comment, and appeal procedures). The Complaint alleges, and no one denies, that the organizations, the Sierra Club for example, have hundreds of thousands of members who use forests regularly across the Nation for recreational, scientific, aesthetic, and environmental purposes. Complaint ¶¶ 8-12, App. 31-34. The Complaint further alleges, and no one denies, that these organizations (and their members), believing that actions such as salvage-timber sales harm those interests, regularly oppose salvage-timber sales (and similar actions) in proceedings before the agency. <i>Ibid.</i> And the Complaint alleges, and no <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1157</span> one denies, that the organizations intend to continue to express their opposition to such actions in those proceedings in the future. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Consider further: The affidavit of a member of Sequoia ForestKeeper, Ara Marderosian, attached to the Complaint, specifies that Marderosian had visited the Burnt Ridge Project site in the past and intended to return. The majority concedes that this is sufficient to show that Marderosian had standing to challenge the Burnt Ridge Project. The majority must therefore agree that \"at least one identified member ha[s] suffered ... harm.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1151. Why then does it find insufficient the affidavit, also attached to the Complaint, of Jim Bensman, a member of Heartwood, Inc.? That affidavit states, among other things, that Bensman has visited 70 National Forests, that he has visited some of those forests \"hundreds of times,\" that he has often visited the Allegheny National Forest in the past, that he has \"probably commented on a thousand\" Forest Service projects including salvage-timber sale proposals, that he intends to continue to comment on similar Forest Service proposals, and that the Forest Service plans in the future to conduct salvage-timber sales on 20 parcels in the Allegheny National Forestone of the forests he has visited in the past. ¶¶ 6, 13, App. E to Pet. for Cert. 68a, 69a, 71a.</p>\n<p>The Bensman affidavit does not say <i>which particular</i> sites will be affected by future Forest Service projects, but the Service itself has conceded that it will conduct thousands of exempted projects in the future. Why is more specificity needed to show a \"realistic\" threat that a project will impact land Bensman uses? To know, virtually for certain, that snow will fall in New England this winter is not to know the name of each particular town where it is bound to arrive. The law of standing does not require the latter kind of specificity. How could it? And <i>Sierra Club v. Morton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108502\"><a href=\"/opinion/108502/sierra-club-v-morton/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></a></span>, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636, on which the majority so heavily relies, involved plaintiffs who challenged (true, a \"massive\") development, but only on a single previously determined site, about 80 acres in size, in a portion of the forest with a \"limited ... number of visitors.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 728, 92 S.Ct. 1361. The Court's unwillingness to infer harm to the Sierra Club's members there does not demand a similar unwillingness here, where the challenge is to procedures affecting \"thousands\" of sites, involving hundreds of times as much acreage, where the precise location of each may not yet be known. In <i>Sierra Club, ibid.,</i> it may have been unreasonable simply to assume that members would suffer an \"injury in fact.\" But here, given the very different factual circumstances, it is unreasonable to believe they would not.</p>\n<p>Whatever doubt may remain is settled by the affidavits the plaintiffs submitted after the Burnt Ridge dispute was settled (while the other claims in the Complaint remained alive). The majority says it will not consider those affidavits because they were submitted \"[a]fter the District Court had entered judgment.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1150, n. But the plaintiffs submitted the affidavits after judgment (in opposition to the Government's motion for a stay) because the Burnt Ridge dispute on which they had relied to show standing at the outset of suit had by that point been settled. No longer wishing to rely solely on evidence of their members' interest in that particular project, the plaintiff organizations submitted several other affidavits. Why describe this perfectly sensible response to the settlement of some of the Complaint's claims as a \"retroactiv[e]\" attempt to \"me[e]t the challenge to their standing at the time of judgment\"? <i>Ibid.</i> In fact, the Government did not challenge standing until that point, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1158</span> so of course respondents (who all agree had standing at the outset) did not respond with affidavits until laterwhen their standing was challenged. This can hardly be characterized as an attempt to \"resurrect and alter the outcome\" in the case. <i>Ante,</i> at 1153. Regardless, the Constitution does not bar the filing of further affidavits, nor does any statute. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure contain no such bar. Indeed, those Rules provide a judge with liberal discretion to permit a plaintiff to amend a complainteven after one dispute (of several) is settled. So why would they not permit the filing of affidavitsat least with the judge's permission? See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(d) (\"The court may permit supplementation even though the original pleading is defective in stating a claim or defense\").</p>\n<p>The affidavits in question describe a number of then-pending Forest Service projects, all excluded from notice, comment, and appeal under the Forest Service regulations and all scheduled to take place on parcels that the plaintiff organizations' members use. Erik Ryberg, for example, a member of the Center for Biological Diversity, described in his affidavit a proposed logging project scheduled for the Payette National Forestan area with which he is \"personally familiar.\" ¶ 6, App. 90. A second affidavit filed by Jim Bensman described a salvage-timber sale scheduled for the Hoosier National Forestan area Bensman had visited \"multiple times\" and to which he planned to return in the coming weeksand one planned for the Daniel Boone National Forestalso used by Bensmanwhich would \"impact [Heartwood's] members['] use of the areas.\" ¶¶ 8-9, <i>id.,</i> at 85-86. The affidavits also describe, among other things, the frequency with which the organizations' members routinely file administrative appeals of salvage-timber sales and identify a number of proposed and pending projects that certain Sierra Club members wished to appeal. See Decl. of Rene Voss ¶ 3, <i>id.,</i> at 94 (describing a proposed logging and prescribed burn planned for the Gallatin National Forest); Decl. of Craig Thomas ¶¶ 3, 13, <i>id.,</i> at 95, 98 (describing Thomas' \"use\" and \"enjoy[ment]\" of the \"Sierra Nevada national forests for recreational, aesthetic, scientific and professional pursuits,\" and attesting to \"eighteen separate logging projects,\" all categorically excluded, proposed for one such forest tract).</p>\n<p>These allegations and affidavits more than adequately show a \"realistic threat\" of injury to plaintiffs brought about by reoccurrence of the challenged conductconduct that the Forest Service thinks lawful and <i>admits</i> will reoccur. Many years ago the Ninth Circuit warned that a court should not \"be blind to what must be necessarily known to every intelligent person.\" <i>In re Wo Lee,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></span>, 475 (1886).

EARTH ISLAND INSTITUTE ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 07–463.     Argued October 8, 2008—Decided March 3, 2009\nAfter the U. S. Forest Service approved the Burnt Ridge Project, a sal\n  vage sale of timber on 238 acres of fire-damaged federal land, re\n  spondent environmentalist organizations filed suit to enjoin the Ser\n  vice from applying its regulations exempting such small sales from\n  the notice, comment, and appeal process it uses for more significant\n  land management decisions, and to challenge other regulations that\n  did not apply to Burnt Ridge. The District Court granted a prelimi\n  nary injunction against the sale, and the parties then settled their\n  dispute as to Burnt Ridge. Although concluding that the sale was no\n  longer at issue, and despite the Government’s argument that respon\n  dents therefore lacked standing to challenge the regulations, the\n  court nevertheless proceeded to adjudicate the merits of their chal\n  lenges, invalidating several regulations, including the notice and\n  comment and the appeal provisions. Among its rulings, the Ninth\n  Circuit affirmed the determination that the latter regulations, which\n  were applicable to Burnt Ridge, were contrary to law, but held that\n  challenges to other regulations not at issue in that project were not\n  ripe for adjudication.\nHeld: Respondents lack standing to challenge the regulations still at\n issue absent a live dispute over a concrete application of those regu\n lations. Pp. 4–12.\n    (a) In limiting the judicial power to “Cases” and “Controversies,”\n Article III restricts it to redressing or preventing actual or immi\n nently threatened injury to persons caused by violation of law. See,\n e.g., Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 559–560. The\n standing doctrine reflects this fundamental limitation, requiring that\n “the plaintiff . . . ‘alleg[e] such a personal stake in the outcome of the\n controversy’ as to warrant his invocation of federal-court jurisdic\n2              SUMMERS v. EARTH ISLAND INSTITUTE\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tion,” Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 498–499. Here, respondents\n    can demonstrate standing only if application of the regulations will\n    affect them in such a manner. Pp. 4–5.\n       (b) As organizations, respondents can assert their members’ stand\n    ing. Harm to their members’ recreational, or even their mere es\n    thetic, interests in the National Forests will suffice to establish the\n    requisite concrete and particularized injury, see Sierra Club v. Mor\n    ton, 405 U. S. 727, 734–736, but generalized harm to the forest or the\n    environment will not alone suffice. Respondents have identified no\n    application of the invalidated regulations that threatens imminent\n    and concrete harm to their members’ interests. Respondents’ argu\n    ment that they have standing based on Burnt Ridge fails because, af\n    ter voluntarily settling the portion of their lawsuit relevant to Burnt\n    Ridge, respondents and their members are no longer under threat of\n    injury from that project. The remaining affidavit submitted in sup\n    port of standing fails to establish that any member has concrete\n    plans to visit a site where the challenged regulations are being ap\n    plied in a manner that will harm that member’s concrete interests.\n    Additional affidavits purporting to establish standing were submitted\n    after judgment had already been entered and notice of appeal filed,\n    and are thus untimely. Pp. 5–8.\n       (c) Respondents’ argument that they have standing because they\n    have suffered procedural injury—i.e., they have been denied the abil\n    ity to file comments on some Forest Service actions and will continue\n    to be so denied—fails because such a deprivation without some con\n    crete interest affected thereby is insufficient to create Article III\n    standing.

(We will refer to them collec\ntively as “Earth Island.”) They seek to prevent the United\nStates Forest Service from enforcing regulations that\nexempt small fire-rehabilitation and timber-salvage pro\njects from the notice, comment, and appeal process used\nby the Forest Service for more significant land manage\nment decisions. We must determine whether respondents\nhave standing to challenge the regulations in the absence\nof a live dispute over a concrete application of those\nregulations.\n                             I\n   In 1992, Congress enacted the Forest Service Decision\nmaking and Appeals Reform Act (Appeals Reform Act or\nAct), Pub. L. 102–381, Tit. III, §322, 106 Stat. 1419, note\nfollowing 16 U. S. C. §1612. Among other things, this\nrequired the Forest Service to establish a notice, comment,\nand appeal process for “proposed actions of the Forest\nService concerning projects and activities implementing\nland and resource management plans developed under the\n2          SUMMERS v. EARTH ISLAND INSTITUTE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nForest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act\nof 1974.” Ibid.\n   The Forest Service’s regulations implementing the Act\nprovided that certain of its procedures would not be ap\nplied to projects that the Service considered categorically\nexcluded from the requirement to file an environmental\nimpact statement (EIS) or environmental assessment\n(EA). 36 CFR §§215.4(a) (notice and comment), 215.12(f)\n(appeal) (2008). Later amendments to the Forest Service’s\nmanual of implementing procedures, adopted by rule after\nnotice and comment, provided that fire-rehabilitation\nactivities on areas of less than 4,200 acres, and salvage\ntimber sales of 250 acres or less, did not cause a signifi\ncant environmental impact and thus would be categori\ncally exempt from the requirement to file an EIS or EA.\n68 Fed. Reg. 33824 (2003) (Forest Service Handbook\n(FSH) 1909.15, ch. 30, §31.2(11)); 68 Fed. Reg. 44607 (FSH\n1909.15, ch. 30, §31.2(13)). This had the effect of exclud\ning these projects from the notice, comment, and appeal\nprocess.\n   In the summer of 2002, fire burned a significant area of\nthe Sequoia National Forest. In September 2003, the\nService issued a decision memo approving the Burnt Ridge\nProject, a salvage sale of timber on 238 acres damaged by\nthat fire. Pursuant to its categorical exclusion of salvage\nsales of less than 250 acres, the Forest Service did not\nprovide notice in a form consistent with the Appeals Re\nform Act, did not provide a period of public comment, and\ndid not make an appeal process available.\n   In December 2003, respondents filed a complaint in the\nEastern District of California, challenging the failure of\nthe Forest Service to apply to the Burnt Ridge Project\n§215.4(a) of its regulations implementing the Appeals\nReform Act (requiring prior notice and comment), and\n§215.12(f) of the regulations (setting forth an appeal pro\ncedure). The complaint also challenged six other Forest\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nService regulations implementing the Act that were not\napplied to the Burnt Ridge Project. They are irrelevant to\nthis appeal.\n  The District Court granted a preliminary injunction\nagainst the Burnt Ridge salvage-timber sale. Soon there\nafter, the parties settled their dispute over the Burnt\nRidge Project and the District Court concluded that “the\nBurnt Ridge timber sale is not at issue in this case.”\nEarth Island Inst. v. Pengilly, 376 F. Supp. 2d 994, 999\n(ED Cal. 2005). The Government argued that, with the\nBurnt Ridge dispute settled, and with no other project\nbefore the court in which respondents were threatened\nwith injury in fact, respondents lacked standing to chal\nlenge the regulations; and that absent a concrete dispute\nover a particular project a challenge to the regulations\nwould not be ripe. The District Court proceeded, however,\nto adjudicate the merits of Earth Island’s challenges. It\ninvalidated five of the regulations (including §§215.4(a)\nand 215.12(f)), id., at 1011, and entered a nationwide\ninjunction against their application, Earth Island Inst. v.\nRuthenbeck, No. CIV F–03–6386 JKS, 2005 WL 5280466\n*2 (Sept. 20, 2005).\n  The Ninth Circuit held that Earth Island’s challenges to\nregulations not at issue in the Burnt Ridge Project were\nnot ripe for adjudication because there was “not a suffi\ncient ‘case or controversy’ ” before the court to sustain a\nfacial challenge. Earth Island Inst. v. Ruthenbeck, 490\nF. 3d 687, 696 (2007) (amended opinion). It affirmed,\nhowever, the District Court’s determination that\n§§215.4(a) and 215.12(f), which were applicable to the\nBurnt Ridge Project, were contrary to law, and upheld the\nnationwide injunction against their application.\n  The Government sought review of the question whether\nEarth Island could challenge the regulations at issue in\nthe Burnt Ridge Project, and if so whether a nationwide\ninjunction was appropriate relief. We granted certiorari,\n4          SUMMERS v. EARTH ISLAND INSTITUTE\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n552 U. S. ___ (2008).\n                              II\n  In limiting the judicial power to “Cases” and “Contro\nversies,” Article III of the Constitution restricts it to the\ntraditional role of Anglo-American courts, which is to\nredress or prevent actual or imminently threatened injury\nto persons caused by private or official violation of law.\nExcept when necessary in the execution of that function,\ncourts have no charter to review and revise legislative and\nexecutive action. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504\nU. S. 555, 559–560 (1992); Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S.\n95, 111–112 (1983). This limitation “is founded in concern\nabout the proper—and properly limited—role of the courts\nin a democratic society.” Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490,\n498 (1975). See United States v. Richardson, 418 U. S.\n166, 179 (1974).\n  The doctrine of standing is one of several doctrines that\nreflect this fundamental limitation. It requires federal\ncourts to satisfy themselves that “the plaintiff has ‘alleged\nsuch a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy’ as\nto warrant his invocation of federal-court jurisdiction.”\n422 U. S., at 498–499. He bears the burden of showing\nthat he has standing for each type of relief sought. See\nLyons, supra, at 105. To seek injunctive relief, a plaintiff\nmust show that he is under threat of suffering “injury in\nfact” that is concrete and particularized; the threat must\nbe actual and imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; it\nmust be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the\ndefendant; and it must be likely that a favorable judicial\ndecision will prevent or redress the injury. Friends of\nEarth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.,\n528 U. S. 167, 180–181 (2000). This requirement assures\nthat “there is a real need to exercise the power of judicial\nreview in order to protect the interests of the complaining\nparty,” Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War,\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n418 U. S. 208, 221 (1974). Where that need does not exist,\nallowing courts to oversee legislative or executive action\n“would significantly alter the allocation of power . . . away\nfrom a democratic form of government,” Richardson, su\npra, at 188 (Powell, J., concurring).\n   The regulations under challenge here neither require\nnor forbid any action on the part of respondents. The\nstandards and procedures that they prescribe for Forest\nService appeals govern only the conduct of Forest Service\nofficials engaged in project planning. “[W]hen the plaintiff\nis not himself the object of the government action or inac\ntion he challenges, standing is not precluded, but it is\nordinarily ‘substantially more difficult’ to establish.”\nDefenders of Wildlife, supra, at 562. Here, respondents\ncan demonstrate standing only if application of the regula\ntions by the Government will affect them in the manner\ndescribed above.\n   It is common ground that the respondent organizations\ncan assert the standing of their members. To establish the\nconcrete and particularized injury that standing requires,\nrespondents point to their members’ recreational interests\nin the National Forests. While generalized harm to the\nforest or the environment will not alone support standing,\nif that harm in fact affects the recreational or even the\nmere esthetic interests of the plaintiff, that will suffice.\nSierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727, 734–736 (1972).\n   Affidavits submitted to the District Court alleged that\norganization member Ara Marderosian had repeatedly\nvisited the Burnt Ridge site, that he had imminent plans\nto do so again, and that his interests in viewing the flora\nand fauna of the area would be harmed if the Burnt Ridge\nProject went forward without incorporation of the ideas he\nwould have suggested if the Forest Service had provided\nhim an opportunity to comment. The Government con\ncedes this was sufficient to establish Article III standing\nwith respect to Burnt Ridge. Brief for Petitioners 28.\n6            SUMMERS v. EARTH ISLAND INSTITUTE\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nMarderosian’s threatened injury with regard to that pro\nject was originally one of the bases for the present suit.\nAfter the District Court had issued a preliminary injunc\ntion, however, the parties settled their differences on that\nscore. Marderosian’s injury in fact with regard to that\nproject has been remedied, and it is, as the District Court\npronounced, “not at issue in this case.” 376 F. Supp. 2d, at\n999. We know of no precedent for the proposition that\nwhen a plaintiff has sued to challenge the lawfulness of\ncertain action or threatened action but has settled that\nsuit, he retains standing to challenge the basis for that\naction (here, the regulation in the abstract), apart from\nany concrete application that threatens imminent harm to\nhis interests. Such a holding would fly in the face of Arti\ncle III’s injury-in-fact requirement. See Lyons, supra, at\n111.\n   Respondents have identified no other application of the\ninvalidated regulations that threatens imminent and\nconcrete harm to the interests of their members. The only\nother affidavit relied on was that of Jim Bensman.* He\nasserted, first, that he had suffered injury in the past from\ndevelopment on Forest Service land. That does not suffice\nfor several reasons: because it was not tied to application\nof the challenged regulations, because it does not identify\nany particular site, and because it relates to past injury\nrather than imminent future injury that is sought to be\nenjoined.\n   Bensman’s affidavit further asserts that he has visited\nmany National Forests and plans to visit several unnamed\nNational Forests in the future. Respondents describe this\nas a mere failure to “provide the name of each timber sale\n——————\n   * After the District Court had entered judgment, and after the Gov\nernment had filed its notice of appeal, respondents submitted addi\ntional affidavits to the District Court. We do not consider these. If\nrespondents had not met the challenge to their standing at the time of\njudgment, they could not remedy the defect retroactively.\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat affected [Bensman’s] interests,” Brief for Respondents\n44. It is much more (or much less) than that. It is a fail\nure to allege that any particular timber sale or other\nproject claimed to be unlawfully subject to the regulations\nwill impede a specific and concrete plan of Bensman’s to\nenjoy the National Forests. The National Forests occupy\nmore than 190 million acres, an area larger than Texas.\nSee Meet the Forest Service, http://www.fs.fed.us/aboutus/\nmeetfs.shtml (as visited Feb. 27, 2009, and available in\nClerk of Court’s case file). There may be a chance, but is\nhardly a likelihood, that Bensman’s wanderings will bring\nhim to a parcel about to be affected by a project unlawfully\nsubject to the regulations. Indeed, without further specifi\ncation it is impossible to tell which projects are (in respon\ndents’ view) unlawfully subject to the regulations. The\nallegations here present a weaker likelihood of concrete\nharm than that which we found insufficient in Lyons, 461\nU. S. 95, where a plaintiff who alleged that he had been\ninjured by an improper police chokehold sought injunctive\nrelief barring use of the hold in the future. We said it was\n“no more than conjecture” that Lyons would be subjected\nto that chokehold upon a later encounter. Id., at 108.\nHere we are asked to assume not only that Bensman will\nstumble across a project tract unlawfully subject to the\nregulations, but also that the tract is about to be devel\noped by the Forest Service in a way that harms his recrea\ntional interests, and that he would have commented on the\nproject but for the regulation. Accepting an intention to\nvisit the National Forests as adequate to confer standing\nto challenge any Government action affecting any portion\nof those forests would be tantamount to eliminating the\nrequirement of concrete, particularized injury in fact.\n   The Bensman affidavit does refer specifically to a series\nof projects in the Allegheny National Forest that are sub\nject to the challenged regulations. It does not assert,\nhowever, any firm intention to visit their locations, saying\n8          SUMMERS v. EARTH ISLAND INSTITUTE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nonly that Bensman “ ‘want[s] to’ ” go there. Brief for Peti\ntioners 6. This vague desire to return is insufficient to\nsatisfy the requirement of imminent injury: “Such ‘some\nday’ intentions—without any description of concrete plans,\nor indeed any specification of when the some day will be—\ndo not support a finding of the ‘actual or imminent’ injury\nthat our cases require.” Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S., at\n564.\n   Respondents argue that they have standing to bring\ntheir challenge because they have suffered procedural\ninjury, namely that they have been denied the ability to\nfile comments on some Forest Service actions and will\ncontinue to be so denied. But deprivation of a procedural\nright without some concrete interest that is affected by the\ndeprivation—a procedural right in vacuo—is insufficient\nto create Article III standing. Only a “person who has\nbeen accorded a procedural right to protect his concrete\ninterests can assert that right without meeting all the\nnormal standards for redressability and immediacy.” Id.,\nat 572, n. 7 (emphasis added). Respondents alleged such\ninjury in their challenge to the Burnt Ridge Project, claim\ning that but for the allegedly unlawful abridged proce\ndures they would have been able to oppose the project that\nthreatened to impinge on their concrete plans to observe\nnature in that specific area. But Burnt Ridge is now off\nthe table.\n   It makes no difference that the procedural right has\nbeen accorded by Congress. That can loosen the strictures\nof the redressability prong of our standing inquiry—so\nthat standing existed with regard to the Burnt Ridge\nProject, for example, despite the possibility that Earth\nIsland’s allegedly guaranteed right to comment would not\nbe successful in persuading the Forest Service to avoid\nimpairment of Earth Island’s concrete interests. See Ibid.\nUnlike redressability, however, the requirement of injury\nin fact is a hard floor of Article III jurisdiction that cannot\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbe removed by statute.\n     “[I]t would exceed [Article III’s] limitations if, at the\n    behest of Congress and in the absence of any showing\n    of concrete injury, we were to entertain citizen suits to\n    vindicate the public’s nonconcrete interest in the\n    proper administration of the laws. . . . [T]he party\n    bringing suit must show that the action injures him in\n    a concrete and personal way.”          Id., at 580–581\n    (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in\n    judgment).\n                              III\n   The dissent proposes a hitherto unheard-of test for\norganizational standing: whether, accepting the organiza\ntion’s self-description of the activities of its members,\nthere is a statistical probability that some of those mem\nbers are threatened with concrete injury. Since, for exam\nple, the Sierra Club asserts in its pleadings that it has\nmore than “ ‘700,000 members nationwide, including\nthousands of members in California’ ” who “ ‘use and enjoy\nthe Sequoia National Forest,’ ” post, at 2 (opinion of\nBREYER, J.), it is probable (according to the dissent) that\nsome (unidentified) members have planned to visit some\n(unidentified) small parcels affected by the Forest Ser\nvice’s procedures and will suffer (unidentified) concrete\nharm as a result. This novel approach to the law of organ\nizational standing would make a mockery of our prior\ncases, which have required plaintiff-organizations to make\nspecific allegations establishing that at least one identified\nmember had suffered or would suffer harm. In Defenders\nof Wildlife, supra, at 563, we held that the organization\nlacked standing because it failed to “submit affidavits . . .\nshowing, through specific facts . . . that one or more of [its]\nmembers would . . . be ‘directly’ affected” by the allegedly\nillegal activity. Morton, 405 U. S. 727, involved the same\nSierra Club that is a party in the present case, and a\n10         SUMMERS v. EARTH ISLAND INSTITUTE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nproject in the Sequoia National Forest. The principal\ndifference from the present case is that the challenged\nproject was truly massive, involving the construction of\nmotels, restaurants, swimming pools, parking lots, and\nother structures on 80 acres of the Forest, plus ski lifts,\nski trails, and a 20-mile access highway. We did not en\ngage in an assessment of statistical probabilities that one\nof the Sierra Club’s members would be adversely affected,\nbut held that the Sierra Club lacked standing. We said:\n     “The Sierra Club failed to allege that it or its mem\n     bers would be affected in any of their activities or pas\n     times by the Disney development. Nowhere in the\n     pleadings or affidavits did the Club state that its\n     members use Mineral King for any purpose, much less\n     that they use it in any way that would be significantly\n     affected by the proposed actions of the respondents.”\n     Id., at 735.\nAnd in FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U. S. 215, 235 (1990),\nwe noted that the affidavit provided by the city to estab\nlish standing would be insufficient because it did not name\nthe individuals who were harmed by the challenged li\ncense-revocation program. This requirement of naming\nthe affected members has never been dispensed with in\nlight of statistical probabilities, but only where all the\nmembers of the organization are affected by the chal\nlenged activity. See, e.g., NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Pat\nterson, 357 U. S. 449, 459 (1958) (all organization mem\nbers affected by release of membership lists).\n  A major problem with the dissent’s approach is that it\naccepts the organizations’ self-descriptions of their mem\nbership, on the simple ground that “no one denies” them,\npost, at 6. But it is well established that the court has an\nindependent obligation to assure that standing exists,\nregardless of whether it is challenged by any of the par\nties. Bender v. Williamsport Area School Dist., 475 U. S.\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)             11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n534, 541 (1986). Without individual affidavits, how is the\ncourt to assure itself that the Sierra Club, for example,\nhas “ ‘thousands of members’ ” who “ ‘use and enjoy the\nSequoia National Forest’ ”? And, because to establish\nstanding plaintiffs must show that they “use the area\naffected by the challenged activity and not an area roughly\nin the vicinity of” a project site, Defenders of Wildlife, 504\nU. S., at 566 (internal quotation marks omitted), how is\nthe court to assure itself that some of these members plan\nto make use of the specific sites upon which projects may\ntake place? Or that these same individuals will find their\nrecreation burdened by the Forest Service’s use of the\nchallenged procedures? While it is certainly possible—\nperhaps even likely—that one individual will meet all of\nthese criteria, that speculation does not suffice. “Stand\ning,” we have said, “is not ‘an ingenious academic exercise\nin the conceivable’ . . . [but] requires . . . a factual showing\nof perceptible harm.” Ibid. In part because of the diffi\nculty of verifying the facts upon which such probabilistic\nstanding depends, the Court has required plaintiffs claim\ning an organizational standing to identify members who\nhave suffered the requisite harm—surely not a difficult\ntask here, when so many thousands are alleged to have\nbeen harmed.\n   The dissent would have us replace the requirement of\n“ ‘imminent’ ” harm, which it acknowledges our cases es\ntablish, see post, at 4, with the requirement of “ ‘a realistic\nthreat’ that reoccurrence of the challenged activity would\ncause [the plaintiff] harm ‘in the reasonably near future,’ ”\npost, at 5. That language is taken, of course, from an\nopinion that did not find standing, so the seeming expan\nsiveness of the test made not a bit of difference. The\nproblem for the dissent is that the timely affidavits no\nmore meet that requirement than they meet the usual\nformulation. They fail to establish that the affiants’ mem\nbers will ever visit one of the small parcels at issue.\n12         SUMMERS v. EARTH ISLAND INSTITUTE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  The dissent insists, however, that we should also have\nconsidered the late-filed affidavits. It invokes Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 15(d) (West 2008 rev. ed.), which\nsays that “[t]he court may permit supplementation even\nthough the original pleading is defective in stating of a\nclaim or defense.” So also does Rule 21 permit joinder of\nparties “at any time.” But the latter no more permits\njoinder of parties, than the former permits the supplemen\ntation of the record, in the circumstances here: after the\ntrial is over, judgment has been entered, and a notice of\nappeal has been filed. The dissent cites no instance in\nwhich “supplementation” has been permitted to resurrect\nand alter the outcome in a case that has gone to judgment,\nand indeed after notice of appeal had been filed. If Rule\n15(b) allows additional facts to be inserted into the record\nafter appeal has been filed, we are at the threshold of a\nbrave new world of trial practice in which Rule 60 has\nbeen swallowed whole by Rule 15(b).\n                       *    *     *\n  Since we have resolved this case on the ground of stand\ning, we need not reach the Government’s contention that\nplaintiffs have not demonstrated that the regulations are\nripe for review under the Administrative Procedure Act.\nWe likewise do not reach the question whether, if respon\ndents prevailed, a nationwide injunction would be appro\npriate. And we do not disturb the dismissal of respon\ndents’ challenge to the remaining regulations, which has\nnot been appealed.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed in part\nand affirmed in part.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

The Earth Island Institute, a\nCalifornia organization, has over 15,000 members in the\nUnited States, over 3,000 of whom “use and enjoy the\nNational Forests of California for recreational, educa­\ntional, aesthetic, spiritual and other purposes.” Corrected\nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief in Case\nNo. CIV–F–03–630 REC DLB (ED Cal.) ¶8, App. 31 (here­\ninafter Complaint). The Sequoia ForestKeeper, a small\norganization, has “100 plus” members who “use the forests\nof the Southern Sierra Nevada for activities such as hik­\n2          SUMMERS v. EARTH ISLAND INSTITUTE\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ning, bird and animal watching, aesthetic enjoyment, quiet\ncontemplation, fishing and scientific study.” Id., ¶9, at 32.\nHeartwood, Inc., located in Illinois and Indiana, is a coali­\ntion of environmental organizations with “members” who\n“continually use the National Forests for the purposes of\necological health, recreation, aesthetic enjoyment, and\nother purposes.” Id., ¶10, at 33. The Center for Biological\nDiversity, located in Arizona, California, New Mexico, and\nWashington, has over 5,000 members who “use Forest\nService lands,” and who are “dedicated to the preservation,\nprotection, and restoration of biological diversity, native\nspecies and ecosystems in the Western United States and\nelsewhere.” Ibid., ¶11. The Sierra Club has more than\n“700,000 members nationwide, including thousands of\nmembers in California” who “use and enjoy the Sequoia\nNational Forest,” for “outdoor recreation and scientific\nstudy of various kinds, including nature study, bird­\nwatching, photography, fishing, canoeing, hunting, back­\npacking, camping, solitude, and a variety of other activi­\nties.” Id., ¶12, at 34.\n   These five organizations point to a federal law that says\nthe Forest Service “shall establish a notice and comment\nprocess,” along with a procedure for filing administrative\n“appeals,” for “proposed actions . . . concerning projects\nand activities implementing land and resource manage­\nment plans . . . .” §322, 106 Stat. 1419, note following 16\nU. S. C. §1612. They add that the Service has exempted\nfrom “notice, comment, and appeal” processes its decisions\nthat allow, among other things, salvage-timber sales on\nburned forest lands of less than 250 acres in size. 36 CFR\n§§215.4(a), 215.12(f) (2008); see also 68 Fed. Reg. 44607–\n44608 (2003) (describing projects exempted). And they\nclaim that the Service’s refusal to provide notice, com­\nment, and appeal procedures violates the statute.

It holds that the dispute\nbetween the five environmental groups and the Forest\nService consists simply of an abstract challenge; it does\nnot amount to the concrete “Cas[e]” or “Controvers[y]” that\nthe Constitution grants federal courts the power to re­\nsolve. Art. III, §2, cl. 1. I cannot agree that this is so.\n    To understand the constitutional issue that the majority\ndecides, it may prove helpful to imagine that Congress\nenacted a statutory provision that expressly permitted\nenvironmental groups like the respondents here to bring\ncases just like the present one, provided (1) that the group\nhas members who have used salvage-timber parcels in the\npast and are likely to do so in the future, and (2) that the\ngroup’s members have opposed Forest Service timber sales\nin the past (using notice, comment, and appeal procedures\nto do so) and will likely use those procedures to oppose\nsalvage-timber sales in the future. The majority cannot,\nand does not, claim that such a statute would be unconsti­\ntutional. See Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U. S. 497, 516–\n518 (2007); Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727, 734–738\n(1972). How then can it find the present case constitu­\ntionally unauthorized?\n    I believe the majority answers this question as follows:\nIt recognizes, as this Court has held, that a plaintiff has\nconstitutional standing if the plaintiff demonstrates (1) an\n“ ‘injury in fact,’ ” (2) that is “fairly traceable” to the defen­\ndant’s “challenged action,” and which (3) a “favorable\n[judicial] decision” will likely prevent or redress. Friends\nof Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC),\nInc., 528 U. S. 167, 180–181 (2000). The majority does not\ndeny that the plaintiffs meet the latter two requirements.\nIt focuses only upon the first, the presence of “actual,” as\nopposed to “conjectural or hypothetical,” injury. Id., at\n180. In doing so, it properly agrees that the “organiza­\n4          SUMMERS v. EARTH ISLAND INSTITUTE\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntions” here can “assert the standing of their members.”\nAnte, at 5. It points out that injuries to the “members’\nrecreational” or even “mere esthetic interests . . . will\nsuffice.” Ibid. It does not claim that the procedural na­\nture of the plaintiffs’ claim makes the difference here, for\nit says only that “deprivation of a procedural right without\nsome concrete interest” thereby affected, i.e., “a procedural\nright in vacuo” would prove “insufficient to create Article\nIII standing.” Ante, at 8 (emphasis added); see also EPA,\n549 U. S., at 517–518. The majority assumes, as do I, that\nthese unlawful Forest Service procedures will lead to\nsubstantive actions, namely the sales of salvage timber on\nburned lands, that might not take place if the proper\nprocedures were followed. But the majority then finds\nthat the plaintiffs have not sufficiently demonstrated that\nthese salvage-timber sales cause plaintiffs an actual in­\njury, that is, harm to the recreational, aesthetic, or other\nenvironmental interests of organization members. Ante,\nat 6–7. To put the matter in terms of my hypothetical\nstatute, the majority holds that the plaintiff organizations,\nwhile showing that they have members who have used\nsalvage-timber sale parcels in the past (i.e., parcels that\nthe Service does not subject to the notice, comment, and\nappeal procedures required by law), have failed to show\nthat they have members likely to use such parcels in the\nfuture.\n                             II\n  How can the majority credibly claim that salvage-timber\nsales, and similar projects, are unlikely to harm the as­\nserted interests of the members of these environmental\ngroups? The majority apparently does so in part by argu­\ning that the Forest Service actions are not “imminent”—a\nrequirement more appropriately considered in the context\nof ripeness or the necessity of injunctive relief. See Ohio\nForestry Assn., Inc. v. Sierra Club, 523 U. S. 726, 734\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           5\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(1998). I concede that the Court has sometimes used the\nword “imminent” in the context of constitutional standing.\nBut it has done so primarily to emphasize that the harm\nin question—the harm that was not “imminent”—was\nmerely “conjectural” or “hypothetical” or otherwise specu­\nlative. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560\n(1992). Where the Court has directly focused upon the\nmatter, i.e., where, as here, a plaintiff has already been\nsubject to the injury it wishes to challenge, the Court has\nasked whether there is a realistic likelihood that the chal­\nlenged future conduct will, in fact, recur and harm the\nplaintiff. That is what the Court said in Los Angeles v.\nLyons, 461 U. S. 95 (1983), a case involving a plaintiff’s\nattempt to enjoin police use of chokeholds. The Court\nwrote that the plaintiff, who had been subject to the\nunlawful chokehold in the past, would have had standing\nhad he shown “a realistic threat” that reoccurrence of the\nchallenged activity would cause him harm “in the rea­\nsonably near future.” Id., at 107, n. 7, 108 (emphasis\nadded). Precedent nowhere suggests that the “realistic\nthreat” standard contains identification requirements\nmore stringent than the word “realistic” implies. See\nBlum v. Yaretsky, 457 U. S. 991, 1000 (1982).\n  How could the Court impose a stricter criterion? Would\ncourts deny standing to a holder of a future interest in\nproperty who complains that a life tenant’s waste of the\nland will almost inevitably hurt the value of his interest—\nthough he will have no personal interest for several years\ninto the future? Would courts deny standing to a land­\nowner who complains that a neighbor’s upstream dam\nconstitutes a nuisance—even if the harm to his down­\nstream property (while bound to occur) will not occur for\nseveral years? Would courts deny standing to an injured\nperson seeking a protection order from future realistic (but\nnongeographically specific) threats of further attacks?\n   To the contrary, a threat of future harm may be realis­\n6           SUMMERS v. EARTH ISLAND INSTITUTE\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntic even where the plaintiff cannot specify precise times,\ndates, and GPS coordinates. Thus, we recently held that\nMassachusetts has standing to complain of a procedural\nfailing, namely, EPA’s failure properly to determine\nwhether to restrict carbon dioxide emissions, even though\nthat failing would create Massachusetts-based harm\nwhich (though likely to occur) might not occur for several\ndecades. EPA, 549 U. S., at 522–523.\n   The Forest Service admits that it intends to conduct\nthousands of further salvage-timber sales and other pro­\njects exempted under the challenged regulations “in the\nreasonably near future.” See Defendants’ Motion to Clar­\nify and Amend Judgment in No. CIV–F–03–6386–JKS–\nDLB (ED Cal.), pp. 13–14. How then can the Court deny\nthat the plaintiffs have shown a “realistic” threat that the\nForest Service will continue to authorize (without the\nprocedures claimed necessary) salvage-timber sales, and\nother Forest Service projects, that adversely affect the\nrecreational, aesthetic, and environmental interests of the\nplaintiffs’ members?\n   Consider: Respondents allege, and the Government\nhas conceded, that the Forest Service took wrongful ac­\ntions (such as selling salvage timber) “thousands” of times\nin the two years prior to suit. Id., at 6; see also id., Exh. 2,\nDecl. of Gloria Manning, Associate Deputy Chief for Na­\ntional Forest System ¶6, p. 3 (identifying 3,377 “proposed\ndecisions,” “[a]s of July 1, 2005,” that would be excluded\nfrom notice, comment, and appeal procedures). The Com­\nplaint alleges, and no one denies, that the organizations,\nthe Sierra Club for example, have hundreds of thousands\nof members who use forests regularly across the Nation for\nrecreational, scientific, aesthetic, and environmental\npurposes. Complaint ¶¶8–12, App. 31–34. The Complaint\nfurther alleges, and no one denies, that these organiza­\ntions (and their members), believing that actions such as\nsalvage-timber sales harm those interests, regularly op­\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\npose salvage-timber sales (and similar actions) in proceed­\nings before the agency. Ibid. And the Complaint alleges,\nand no one denies, that the organizations intend to con­\ntinue to express their opposition to such actions in those\nproceedings in the future. Ibid.\n   Consider further: The affidavit of a member of Sequoia\nForestKeeper, Ara Marderosian, attached to the Com­\nplaint, specifies that Marderosian had visited the Burnt\nRidge Project site in the past and intended to return. The\nmajority concedes that this is sufficient to show that\nMarderosian had standing to challenge the Burnt Ridge\nProject. The majority must therefore agree that “at least\none identified member ha[s] suffered . . . harm.” Ante, at\n9. Why then does it find insufficient the affidavit, also\nattached to the Complaint, of Jim Bensman, a member of\nHeartwood, Inc.? That affidavit states, among other\nthings, that Bensman has visited 70 National Forests,\nthat he has visited some of those forests “hundreds of\ntimes,” that he has often visited the Allegheny National\nForest in the past, that he has “probably commented on a\nthousand” Forest Service projects including salvage­\ntimber sale proposals, that he intends to continue to com­\nment on similar Forest Service proposals, and that the\nForest Service plans in the future to conduct salvage­\ntimber sales on 20 parcels in the Allegheny National\nForest—one of the forests he has visited in the past. ¶¶6,\n13, App. E to Pet. for Cert. 68a, 69a, 71a.\n   The Bensman affidavit does not say which particular\nsites will be affected by future Forest Service projects, but\nthe Service itself has conceded that it will conduct thou­\nsands of exempted projects in the future. Why is more\nspecificity needed to show a “realistic” threat that a pro­\nject will impact land Bensman uses? To know, virtually\nfor certain, that snow will fall in New England this winter\nis not to know the name of each particular town where it is\nbound to arrive. The law of standing does not require the\n8          SUMMERS v. EARTH ISLAND INSTITUTE\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nlatter kind of specificity. How could it? And Sierra Club\nv. Morton, 405 U. S. 727, on which the majority so heavily\nrelies, involved plaintiffs who challenged (true, a “mas­\nsive”) development, but only on a single previously deter­\nmined site, about 80 acres in size, in a portion of the forest\nwith a “limited . . . number of visitors.” Id., at 728. The\nCourt’s unwillingness to infer harm to the Sierra Club’s\nmembers there does not demand a similar unwillingness\nhere, where the challenge is to procedures affecting “thou­\nsands” of sites, involving hundreds of times as much acre­\nage, where the precise location of each may not yet be\nknown. In Sierra Club, ibid., it may have been unreason­\nable simply to assume that members would suffer an\n“injury in fact.” But here, given the very different factual\ncircumstances, it is unreasonable to believe they would\nnot.\n   Whatever doubt may remain is settled by the affidavits\nthe plaintiffs submitted after the Burnt Ridge dispute was\nsettled (while the other claims in the Complaint remained\nalive). The majority says it will not consider those affida­\nvits because they were submitted “[a]fter the District\nCourt had entered judgment.” Ante, at 6, n. But the\nplaintiffs submitted the affidavits after judgment (in\nopposition to the Government’s motion for a stay) because\nthe Burnt Ridge dispute on which they had relied to show\nstanding at the outset of suit had by that point been set­\ntled. No longer wishing to rely solely on evidence of their\nmembers’ interest in that particular project, the plaintiff\norganizations submitted several other affidavits. Why\ndescribe this perfectly sensible response to the settlement\nof some of the Complaint’s claims as a “retroactiv[e]”\nattempt to “me[e]t the challenge to their standing at the\ntime of judgment”? Ibid. In fact, the Government did not\nchallenge standing until that point, so of course respon­\ndents (who all agree had standing at the outset) did not\nrespond with affidavits until later—when their standing\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwas challenged. This can hardly be characterized as an\nattempt to “resurrect and alter the outcome” in the case.\nAnte, at 12. Regardless, the Constitution does not bar the\nfiling of further affidavits, nor does any statute. The\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure contain no such bar.\nIndeed, those Rules provide a judge with liberal discretion\nto permit a plaintiff to amend a complaint—even after one\ndispute (of several) is settled. So why would they not\npermit the filing of affidavits—at least with the judge’s\npermission? See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(d) (“The court\nmay permit supplementation even though the original\npleading is defective in stating a claim or defense”).\n   The affidavits in question describe a number of then­\npending Forest Service projects, all excluded from notice,\ncomment, and appeal under the Forest Service regulations\nand all scheduled to take place on parcels that the plaintiff\norganizations’ members use. Erik Ryberg, for example, a\nmember of the Center for Biological Diversity, described in\nhis affidavit a proposed logging project scheduled for the\nPayette National Forest—an area with which he is “per­\nsonally familiar.” ¶6, App. 90. A second affidavit filed by\nJim Bensman described a salvage-timber sale scheduled\nfor the Hoosier National Forest—an area Bensman had\nvisited “multiple times” and to which he planned to return\nin the coming weeks—and one planned for the Daniel\nBoone National Forest—also used by Bensman—which\nwould “impact [Heartwood’s] members[’] use of the areas.”\n¶¶8–9, id., at 85–86. The affidavits also describe, among\nother things, the frequency with which the organizations’\nmembers routinely file administrative appeals of salvage­\ntimber sales and identify a number of proposed and pend­\ning projects that certain Sierra Club members wished to\nappeal. See Decl. of René Voss ¶3, id., at 94 (describing a\nproposed logging and prescribed burn planned for the\nGallatin National Forest); Decl. of Craig Thomas ¶¶3, 13,\nid., at 95, 98 (describing Thomas’ “use” and “enjoy[ment]”\n10         SUMMERS v.

Many years ago the Ninth Circuit warned that a\ncourt should not “be blind to what must be necessarily\nknown to every intelligent person.” In re Wo Lee, 26 F.\n471, 475 (1886). Applying that standard, I would find\nstanding here.\n                         *     *     *\n   I recognize that the Government raises other claims and\nbases upon which to deny standing or to hold that the case\nis not ripe for adjudication. I believe that these arguments\nare without merit. But because the majority does not\ndiscuss them here, I shall not do so either.\n   With respect, I dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145904/", "sha1": "c0d331070cdf4142300603dcfca06627c882b08a", "source": "LC", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-027", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:09:21"}
