GOLDSTEIN\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 07–854.      Argued November 5, 2008—Decided January 26, 2009\nRespondent Goldstein was released from a California prison after he\n  filed a successful federal habeas petition alleging that his murder\n  conviction depended, in critical part, on the false testimony of a jail\n  house informant (Fink), who had received reduced sentences for pro\n  viding prosecutors with favorable testimony in other cases; that\n  prosecutors knew, but failed to give his attorney, this potential im\n  peachment information; and that, among other things, that failure\n  had led to his erroneous conviction. Once released, Goldstein filed\n  this suit under 42 U. S. C. §1983, asserting the prosecution violated\n  its constitutional duty to communicate impeachment information, see\n  Giglio v. United States, 405 U. S. 150, 154, due to the failure of peti\n  tioners, supervisory prosecutors, to properly train or supervise prose\n  cutors or to establish an information system containing potential im\n  peachment material about informants. Claiming absolute immunity,\n  petitioners asked the District Court to dismiss the complaint, but the\n  court declined, finding that the conduct was “administrative,” not\n  “prosecutorial,” and hence fell outside the scope of an absolute im\n  munity claim. The Ninth Circuit, on interlocutory appeal, affirmed.\nHeld: Petitioners are entitled to absolute immunity in respect to Gold\n stein’s supervision, training, and information-system management\n claims. Pp. 3–12.\n    (a) Prosecutors are absolutely immune from liability in §1983 suits\n brought against prosecutorial actions that are “intimately associated\n with the judicial phase of the criminal process,” Imbler v. Pachtman,\n 424 U. S. 409, 428, 430, because of “concern that harassment by un\n founded litigation” could both “cause a deflection of the prosecutor’s\n energies from his public duties” and lead him to “shade his decisions\n instead of exercising the independence of judgment required by his\n2                      VAN DE KAMP v. GOLDSTEIN\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    public trust,” id., at 423. However, absolute immunity may not apply\n    when a prosecutor is not acting as “an officer of the court,” but is in\n    stead engaged in, say, investigative or administrative tasks. Id., at\n    431, n. 33. To decide whether absolute immunity attaches to a par\n    ticular prosecutorial activity, one must take account of Imbler’s\n    “functional” considerations. The fact that one constitutional duty in\n    Imbler was positive (the duty to supply “information relevant to the\n    defense”) rather than negative (the duty not to “use . . . perjured tes\n    timony”) was not critical to the finding of absolute immunity. Pp. 3–\n    6.\n       (b) Although Goldstein challenges administrative procedures, they\n    are procedures that are directly connected with a trial’s conduct. A\n    prosecutor’s error in a specific criminal trial constitutes an essential\n    element of the plaintiff’s claim. The obligations here are thus unlike\n    administrative duties concerning, e.g., workplace hiring. Moreover,\n    they necessarily require legal knowledge and the exercise of related\n    discretion, e.g., in determining what information should be included\n    in training, supervision, or information-system management. Given\n    these features, absolute immunity must follow. Pp. 6–12.\n         (1) Had Goldstein brought a suit directly attacking supervisory\n    prosecutors’ actions related to an individual trial, instead of one in\n    volving administration, all the prosecutors would have enjoyed abso\n    lute immunity under Imbler. Their behavior, individually or sepa\n    rately, would have involved “[p]reparation . . . for . . . trial,” 424 U. S.,\n    at 431, n. 33, and would have been “intimately associated with the\n    judicial phase of the criminal process,” id., at 430. The only differ\n    ence between Imbler and the hypothetical, i.e., that a supervisor or\n    colleague might be liable instead of the trial prosecutor, is not criti\n    cal. Pp. 7–8.\n         (2) Just as supervisory prosecutors are immune in a suit directly\n    attacking their actions in an individual trial, they are immune here.\n    The fact that the office’s general supervision and training methods\n    are at issue is not a critical difference for present purposes. The rele\n    vant management tasks concern how and when to make impeach\n    ment information available at trial, and, thus, are directly connected\n    with a prosecutor’s basic trial advocacy duties. In terms of Imbler’s\n    functional concerns, a suit claiming that a supervisor made a mistake\n    directly related to a particular trial and one claiming that a supervi\n    sor trained and supervised inadequately seem very much alike. The\n    type of “faulty training” claim here rests in part on a consequent er\n    ror by an individual prosecutor in the midst of trial. If, as Imbler\n    says, the threat of damages liability for such an error could lead a\n    trial prosecutor to take account of that risk when making trial\n    related decisions, so, too, could the threat of more widespread liabil\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  ity throughout the office lead both that prosecutor and other office\n  prosecutors to take account of such a risk. Because better training or\n  supervision might prevent most prosecutorial errors at trial, permis\n  sion to bring suit here would grant criminal defendants permission to\n  bring claims for other trial-related training or supervisory failings.\n  Further, such suits could “pose substantial danger of liability even to\n  the honest prosecutor.” Imbler, 425 U. S., at 425. And defending\n  prosecutorial decisions, often years later, could impose “unique and\n  intolerable burdens upon a prosecutor responsible annually for hun\n  dreds of indictments and trials.” Id., at 425–426. Permitting this\n  suit to go forward would also create practical anomalies. A trial\n  prosecutor would remain immune for intentional misconduct, while\n  her supervisor might be liable for negligent training or supervision.\n  And the ease with which a plaintiff could restyle a complaint charg\n  ing trial failure to one charging a training or supervision failure\n  would eviscerate Imbler. Pp. 8–11.\n       (3) The differences between an information management system\n  and training or supervision do not require a different outcome, for the\n  critical element of any information system is the information it con\n  tains. Deciding what to include and what not to include is little dif\n  ferent from making similar decisions regarding training, for it re\n  quires knowledge of the law. Moreover, were this claim allowed, a\n  court would have to review the office’s legal judgments, not simply\n  about whether to have an information system but also about what\n  kind of system is appropriate, and whether an appropriate system\n  would have included Giglio-related information about one particular\n  kind of informant. Such decisions—whether made before or during\n  trial—are “intimately associated with the judicial phase of the crimi\n  nal process,” Imbler, supra, at 430, and all Imbler’s functional consid\n  erations apply.

Stat. §1979, 42\nU. S. C. §1983. See Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409\n(1976). We ask whether that immunity extends to claims\nthat the prosecution failed to disclose impeachment mate\nrial, see Giglio v. United States, 405 U. S. 150 (1972), due\nto: (1) a failure properly to train prosecutors, (2) a failure\nproperly to supervise prosecutors, or (3) a failure to estab\nlish an information system containing potential impeach\nment material about informants. We conclude that a\nprosecutor’s absolute immunity extends to all these\nclaims.\n                             I\n   In 1998, respondent Thomas Goldstein (then a prisoner)\nfiled a habeas corpus action in the Federal District Court\nfor the Central District of California. He claimed that in\n1980 he was convicted of murder; that his conviction\ndepended in critical part upon the testimony of Edward\nFloyd Fink, a jailhouse informant; that Fink’s testimony\nwas unreliable, indeed false; that Fink had previously\n2               VAN DE KAMP v. GOLDSTEIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreceived reduced sentences for providing prosecutors with\nfavorable testimony in other cases; that at least some\nprosecutors in the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s\nOffice knew about the favorable treatment; that the office\nhad not provided Goldstein’s attorney with that informa\ntion; and that, among other things, the prosecution’s\nfailure to provide Goldstein’s attorney with this potential\nimpeachment information had led to his erroneous convic\ntion. Goldstein v. Long Beach, 481 F. 3d 1170, 1171–1172\n(CA9 2007).\n   After an evidentiary hearing the District Court agreed\nwith Goldstein that Fink had not been truthful and that if\nthe prosecution had told Goldstein’s lawyer that Fink had\nreceived prior rewards in return for favorable testimony it\nmight have made a difference. The court ordered the\nState either to grant Goldstein a new trial or to release\nhim. The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s\ndetermination. And the State decided that, rather than\nretry Goldstein (who had already served 24 years of his\nsentence), it would release him. App. 54–55, 59–60.\n   Upon his release Goldstein filed this §1983 action\nagainst petitioners, the former Los Angeles County dis\ntrict attorney and chief deputy district attorney. Gold\nstein’s complaint (which for present purposes we take as\naccurate) asserts in relevant part that the prosecution’s\nfailure to communicate to his attorney the facts about\nFink’s earlier testimony-related rewards violated the\nprosecution’s constitutional duty to “insure communication\nof all relevant information on each case [including agree\nments made with informants] to every lawyer who deals\nwith it.” Giglio, supra, at 154. Moreover, it alleges that\nthis failure resulted from the failure of petitioners (the\noffice’s chief supervisory attorneys) adequately to train\nand to supervise the prosecutors who worked for them as\nwell as their failure to establish an information system\nabout informants. And it asks for damages based upon\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthese training, supervision, and information-system re\nlated failings.\n  Petitioners, claiming absolute immunity from such a\n§1983 action, asked the District Court to dismiss the\ncomplaint. See Imbler, supra. The District Court denied\nthe motion to dismiss on the ground that the conduct\nasserted amounted to “administrative,” not “prosecuto\nrial,” conduct; hence it fell outside the scope of the prose\ncutor’s absolute immunity to §1983 claims. The Ninth\nCircuit, considering petitioners’ claim on an interlocutory\nappeal, affirmed the District Court’s “no immunity” de\ntermination. We now review the Ninth Circuit’s decision,\nand we reverse its determination.\n                             II\n  A half-century ago Chief Judge Learned Hand explained\nthat a prosecutor’s absolute immunity reflects “a balance”\nof “evils.” Gregoire v. Biddle, 177 F. 2d 579, 581 (CA2\n1949). “[I]t has been thought in the end better,” he said,\n“to leave unredressed the wrongs done by dishonest offi\ncers than to subject those who try to do their duty to the\nconstant dread of retaliation.” Ibid. In Imbler, supra, this\nCourt considered prosecutorial actions that are “inti\nmately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal\nprocess.” Id., at 430. And, referring to Chief Judge\nHand’s views, it held that prosecutors are absolutely\nimmune from liability in §1983 lawsuits brought under\nsuch circumstances. Id., at 428.\n  The §1983 action at issue was that of a prisoner freed on\na writ of habeas corpus who subsequently sought damages\nfrom his former prosecutor. His action, like the action now\nbefore us, tracked the claims that a federal court had\nfound valid when granting his habeas corpus petition. In\nparticular, the prisoner claimed that the trial prosecutor\nhad permitted a fingerprint expert to give false testimony,\nthat the prosecutor was responsible for the expert’s having\n4                VAN DE KAMP v. GOLDSTEIN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsuppressed important evidence, and that the prosecutor\nhad introduced a misleading artist’s sketch into evidence.\nId., at 416.\n   In concluding that the prosecutor was absolutely im\nmune, the Court pointed out that legislators have long\n“enjoyed absolute immunity for their official actions,” id.,\nat 417; that the common law granted immunity to “judges\nand . . . jurors acting within the scope of their duties,” id.,\nat 423, and that the law had also granted prosecutors\nabsolute immunity from common-law tort actions, say,\nthose underlying a “decision to initiate a prosecution,” id.,\nat 421. The Court then held that the “same considerations\nof public policy that underlie” a prosecutor’s common-law\nimmunity “countenance absolute immunity under §1983.”\nId., at 424. Those considerations, the Court said, arise out\nof the general common-law “concern that harassment by\nunfounded litigation” could both “cause a deflection of the\nprosecutor’s energies from his public duties” and also lead\nthe prosecutor to “shade his decisions instead of exercising\nthe independence of judgment required by his public\ntrust.” Id., at 423.\n   Where §1983 actions are at issue, the Court said, both\nsets of concerns are present and serious. The “public trust\nof the prosecutor’s office would suffer” were the prosecutor\nto have in mind his “own potential” damages “liability”\nwhen making prosecutorial decisions—as he might well\nwere he subject to §1983 liability. Id., at 424. This is no\nsmall concern, given the frequency with which criminal\ndefendants bring such suits, id., at 425 (“[A] defendant\noften will transform his resentment at being prosecuted\ninto the ascription of improper and malicious actions to\nthe State’s advocate”), and the “substantial danger of\nliability even to the honest prosecutor” that such suits\npose when they survive pretrial dismissal, ibid.; see also\nibid. (complex, close, fair-trial questions “often would\nrequire a virtual retrial of the criminal offense in a new\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nforum, and the resolution of some technical issues by the\nlay jury”). A “prosecutor,” the Court noted, “inevitably\nmakes many decisions that could engender colorable\nclaims of constitutional deprivation. Defending these\ndecisions, often years after they were made, could impose\nunique and intolerable burdens upon a prosecutor respon\nsible annually for hundreds of indictments and trials.” Id.,\nat 425–426. The Court thus rejected the idea of applying\nthe less-than-absolute “qualified immunity” that the law\naccords to other “executive or administrative officials,”\nnoting that the “honest prosecutor would face greater\ndifficulty” than would those officials “in meeting the stan\ndards of qualified immunity.” Id., at 425. Accordingly, the\nimmunity that the law grants prosecutors is “absolute.”\nId., at 424.\n  The Court made clear that absolute immunity may not\napply when a prosecutor is not acting as “an officer of the\ncourt,” but is instead engaged in other tasks, say, investi\ngative or administrative tasks. Id., at 431, n. 33. To\ndecide whether absolute immunity attaches to a particular\nkind of prosecutorial activity, one must take account of the\n“functional” considerations discussed above. See Burns v.\nReed, 500 U. S. 478, 486 (1991) (collecting cases applying\n“functional approach” to immunity); Kalina v. Fletcher,\n522 U. S. 118, 127, 130 (1997). In Imbler, the Court con\ncluded that the “reasons for absolute immunity appl[ied]\nwith full force” to the conduct at issue because it was\n“intimately associated with the judicial phase of the\ncriminal process.” 424 U. S., at 430. The fact that one\nconstitutional duty at issue was a positive duty (the duty\nto supply “information relevant to the defense”) rather\nthan a negative duty (the duty not to “use . . . perjured\ntestimony”) made no difference. After all, a plaintiff can\noften transform a positive into a negative duty simply by\nreframing the pleadings; in either case, a constitutional\nviolation is at issue. Id., at 431, n. 34.\n6                VAN DE KAMP v. GOLDSTEIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Finally, the Court specifically reserved the question\nwhether or when “similar reasons require immunity for\nthose aspects of the prosecutor’s responsibility that cast\nhim in the role of an administrator . . . rather than that of\nadvocate.” Id., at 430–431. It said that “[d]rawing a\nproper line between these functions may present difficult\nquestions, but this case does not require us to anticipate\nthem.” Id., at 431, n. 33.\n   In the years since Imbler, we have held that absolute\nimmunity applies when a prosecutor prepares to initiate a\njudicial proceeding, Burns, supra, at 492, or appears in\ncourt to present evidence in support of a search warrant\napplication, Kalina, supra, at 126. We have held that\nabsolute immunity does not apply when a prosecutor gives\nadvice to police during a criminal investigation, see Burns,\nsupra, at 496, when the prosecutor makes statements to\nthe press, Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U. S. 259, 277\n(1993), or when a prosecutor acts as a complaining witness\nin support of a warrant application, Kalina, supra, at\n132 (SCALIA, J., concurring). This case, unlike these\nearlier cases, requires us to consider how immunity ap\nplies where a prosecutor is engaged in certain administra\ntive activities.\n                             III\n  Goldstein claims that the district attorney and his chief\nassistant violated their constitutional obligation to provide\nhis attorney with impeachment-related information, see\nGiglio, 405 U. S. 150, because, as the Court of Appeals\nwrote, they failed “to adequately train and supervise\ndeputy district attorneys on that subject,” 481 F. 3d, at\n1176, and because, as Goldstein’s complaint adds, they\n“failed to create any system for the Deputy District Attor\nneys handling criminal cases to access information per\ntaining to the benefits provided to jailhouse informants\nand other impeachment information.” App. 45. We agree\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwith Goldstein that, in making these claims, he attacks\nthe office’s administrative procedures. We are also willing\nto assume with Goldstein, but purely for argument’s sake,\nthat Giglio imposes certain obligations as to training,\nsupervision, or information-system management.\n   Even so, we conclude that prosecutors involved in such\nsupervision or training or information-system manage\nment enjoy absolute immunity from the kind of legal\nclaims at issue here. Those claims focus upon a certain\nkind of administrative obligation—a kind that itself is\ndirectly connected with the conduct of a trial. Here, unlike\nwith other claims related to administrative decisions, an\nindividual prosecutor’s error in the plaintiff’s specific\ncriminal trial constitutes an essential element of the\nplaintiff’s claim. The administrative obligations at issue\nhere are thus unlike administrative duties concerning, for\nexample, workplace hiring, payroll administration, the\nmaintenance of physical facilities, and the like. Moreover,\nthe types of activities on which Goldstein’s claims focus\nnecessarily require legal knowledge and the exercise of\nrelated discretion, e.g., in determining what information\nshould be included in the training or the supervision or\nthe information-system management. And in that sense\nalso Goldstein’s claims are unlike claims of, say, unlawful\ndiscrimination in hiring employees. Given these features\nof the case before us, we believe absolute immunity must\nfollow.\n                             A\n  We reach this conclusion by initially considering a hypo\nthetical case that involves supervisory or other office\nprosecutors but does not involve administration. Suppose\nthat Goldstein had brought such a case, seeking damages\nnot only from the trial prosecutor but also from a supervi\nsory prosecutor or from the trial prosecutor’s colleagues—\nall on the ground that they should have found and turned\n8                 VAN DE KAMP v. GOLDSTEIN\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nover the impeachment material about Fink. Imbler makes\nclear that all these prosecutors would enjoy absolute\nimmunity from such a suit. The prosecutors’ behavior,\ntaken individually or separately, would involve “[p]repara\ntion . . . for . . . trial,” 424 U. S., at 431, n. 33, and would be\n“intimately associated with the judicial phase of the\ncriminal process” because it concerned the evidence pre\nsented at trial. Id., at 430. And all of the considerations\nthat this Court found to militate in favor of absolute im\nmunity in Imbler would militate in favor of immunity in\nsuch a case.\n   The only difference we can find between Imbler and our\nhypothetical case lies in the fact that, in our hypothetical\ncase, a prosecutorial supervisor or colleague might himself\nbe liable for damages instead of the trial prosecutor. But\nwe cannot find that difference (in the pattern of liability\namong prosecutors within a single office) to be critical.\nDecisions about indictment or trial prosecution will often\ninvolve more than one prosecutor within an office. We do\nnot see how such differences in the pattern of liability\namong a group of prosecutors in a single office could alle\nviate Imbler’s basic fear, namely, that the threat of dam\nages liability would affect the way in which prosecutors\ncarried out their basic court-related tasks. Moreover, this\nCourt has pointed out that “it is the interest in protecting\nthe proper functioning of the office, rather than the inter\nest in protecting its occupant, that is of primary impor\ntance.” Kalina, 522 U. S., at 125. Thus, we must assume\nthat the prosecutors in our hypothetical suit would enjoy\nabsolute immunity.\n                             B\n  Once we determine that supervisory prosecutors are\nimmune in a suit directly attacking their actions related to\nan individual trial, we must find they are similarly im\nmune in the case before us. We agree with the Court of\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nAppeals that the office’s general methods of supervision\nand training are at issue here, but we do not agree that\nthat difference is critical for present purposes. That dif\nference does not preclude an intimate connection between\nprosecutorial activity and the trial process. The manage\nment tasks at issue, insofar as they are relevant, concern\nhow and when to make impeachment information avail\nable at a trial. They are thereby directly connected with\nthe prosecutor’s basic trial advocacy duties. And, in terms\nof Imbler’s functional concerns, a suit charging that a\nsupervisor made a mistake directly related to a particular\ntrial, on the one hand, and a suit charging that a supervi\nsor trained and supervised inadequately, on the other,\nwould seem very much alike.\n   That is true, in part, for the practical reason that it will\noften prove difficult to draw a line between general office\nsupervision or office training (say, related to Giglio) and\nspecific supervision or training related to a particular\ncase. To permit claims based upon the former is almost\ninevitably to permit the bringing of claims that include the\nlatter. It is also true because one cannot easily distin\nguish, for immunity purposes, between claims based upon\ntraining or supervisory failures related to Giglio and\nsimilar claims related to other constitutional matters\n(obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963),\nfor example). And that being so, every consideration that\nImbler mentions militates in favor of immunity.\n   As we have said, the type of “faulty training” claim at\nissue here rests in necessary part upon a consequent error\nby an individual prosecutor in the midst of trial, namely,\nthe plaintiff’s trial. If, as Imbler says, the threat of dam\nages liability for such an error could lead a trial prosecutor\nto take account of that risk when making trial-related\ndecisions, so, too, could the threat of more widespread\nliability throughout the office (ultimately traceable to that\ntrial error) lead both that prosecutor and other office\n10              VAN DE KAMP v. GOLDSTEIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprosecutors as well to take account of such a risk. Indeed,\nmembers of a large prosecutorial office, when making\nprosecutorial decisions, could have in mind the “conse\nquences in terms of” damages liability whether they are\nmaking general decisions about supervising or training or\nwhether they are making individual trial-related deci\nsions. Imbler, 424 U. S., at 424.\n   Moreover, because better training or supervision might\nprevent most, if not all, prosecutorial errors at trial, per\nmission to bring such a suit here would grant permission\nto criminal defendants to bring claims in other similar\ninstances, in effect claiming damages for (trial-related)\ntraining or supervisory failings. Cf. Imbler, supra. Fur\nther, given the complexity of the constitutional issues,\ninadequate training and supervision suits could, as in\nImbler, “pose substantial danger of liability even to the\nhonest prosecutor.” Id., at 425. Finally, as Imbler pointed\nout, defending prosecutorial decisions, often years after\nthey were made, could impose “unique and intolerable\nburdens upon a prosecutor responsible annually for hun\ndreds of indictments and trials.” Id., at 425–426.\n   At the same time, to permit this suit to go forward\nwould create practical anomalies. A trial prosecutor\nwould remain immune, even for intentionally failing to\nturn over, say Giglio material; but her supervisor might be\nliable for negligent training or supervision. Small prosecu\ntion offices where supervisors can personally participate in\nall of the cases would likewise remain immune from prose\ncution; but large offices, making use of more general office\nwide supervision and training, would not. Most impor\ntant, the ease with which a plaintiff could restyle a com\nplaint charging a trial failure so that it becomes a com\nplaint charging a failure of training or supervision would\neviscerate Imbler.\n   We conclude that the very reasons that led this Court in\nImbler to find absolute immunity require a similar finding\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin this case. We recognize, as Chief Judge Hand pointed\nout, that sometimes such immunity deprives a plaintiff of\ncompensation that he undoubtedly merits; but the im\npediments to the fair, efficient functioning of a prosecuto\nrial office that liability could create lead us to find that\nImbler must apply here.\n                              C\n   We treat separately Goldstein’s claim that the Los\nAngeles County District Attorney’s Office should have\nestablished a system that would have permitted prosecu\ntors “handling criminal cases to access information per\ntaining to the benefits provided to jailhouse informants\nand other impeachment information.” App. 45. We do so\nbecause Goldstein argues that the creation of an informa\ntion management system is a more purely administrative\ntask, less closely related to the “judicial phase of the\ncriminal process,” Imbler, supra, at 430, than are supervi\nsory or training tasks. He adds that technically qualified\nindividuals other than prosecutors could create such a\nsystem and that they could do so prior to the initiation of\ncriminal proceedings.\n   In our view, however, these differences do not require a\ndifferent outcome. The critical element of any information\nsystem is the information it contains. Deciding what to\ninclude and what not to include in an information system\nis little different from making similar decisions in respect\nto training. Again, determining the criteria for inclusion\nor exclusion requires knowledge of the law.\n   Moreover, the absence of an information system is rele\nvant here if, and only if, a proper system would have\nincluded information about the informant Fink. Thus,\nwere this claim allowed, a court would have to review the\noffice’s legal judgments, not simply about whether to have\nan information system but also about what kind of system\nis appropriate, and whether an appropriate system would\n12               VAN DE KAMP v. GOLDSTEIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhave included Giglio-related information about one par\nticular kind of trial informant. Such decisions—whether\nmade prior to or during a particular trial—are “intimately\nassociated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.”\nImbler, supra, at 430; see Burns, 500 U. S., at 486. And,\nfor the reasons set out above, all Imbler’s functional con\nsiderations (and the anomalies we mentioned earlier,\nsupra, at 10) apply here as well.\n   We recognize that sometimes it would be easy for a\ncourt to determine that an office’s decision about an in\nformation system was inadequate. Suppose, for example,\nthe office had no system at all. But the same could be said\nof a prosecutor’s trial error. Immunity does not exist to\nhelp prosecutors in the easy case; it exists because the\neasy cases bring difficult cases in their wake. And, as\nImbler pointed out, the likely presence of too many diffi\ncult cases threatens, not prosecutors, but the public, for\nthe reason that it threatens to undermine the necessary\nindependence and integrity of the prosecutorial decision\nmaking process. Such is true of the kinds of claims before\nus, to all of which Imbler’s functional considerations apply.\nConsequently, where a §1983 plaintiff claims that a prose\ncutor’s management of a trial-related information system\nis responsible for a constitutional error at his or her par\nticular trial, the prosecutor responsible for the system\nenjoys absolute immunity just as would the prosecutor\nwho handled the particular trial itself.\n                        *     *  *\n  For these reasons we conclude that petitioners are\nentitled to absolute immunity in respect to Goldstein’s\nclaims that their supervision, training, or information\nsystem management was constitutionally inadequate.\nAccordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is re\nversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n</pre>", "id": 145911, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2009/01/26/Van_de_Kamp_v._Goldstein.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2008                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

GOLDSTEIN\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 07–854.      Argued November 5, 2008—Decided January 26, 2009\nRespondent Goldstein was released from a California prison after he\n  filed a successful federal habeas petition alleging that his murder\n  conviction depended, in critical part, on the false testimony of a jail\n  house informant (Fink), who had received reduced sentences for pro\n  viding prosecutors with favorable testimony in other cases; that\n  prosecutors knew, but failed to give his attorney, this potential im\n  peachment information; and that, among other things, that failure\n  had led to his erroneous conviction. Once released, Goldstein filed\n  this suit under 42 U. S. C. §1983, asserting the prosecution violated\n  its constitutional duty to communicate impeachment information, see\n  Giglio v. United States, 405 U. S. 150, 154, due to the failure of peti\n  tioners, supervisory prosecutors, to properly train or supervise prose\n  cutors or to establish an information system containing potential im\n  peachment material about informants. Claiming absolute immunity,\n  petitioners asked the District Court to dismiss the complaint, but the\n  court declined, finding that the conduct was “administrative,” not\n  “prosecutorial,” and hence fell outside the scope of an absolute im\n  munity claim. The Ninth Circuit, on interlocutory appeal, affirmed.\nHeld: Petitioners are entitled to absolute immunity in respect to Gold\n stein’s supervision, training, and information-system management\n claims. Pp. 3–12.\n    (a) Prosecutors are absolutely immune from liability in §1983 suits\n brought against prosecutorial actions that are “intimately associated\n with the judicial phase of the criminal process,” Imbler v. Pachtman,\n 424 U. S. 409, 428, 430, because of “concern that harassment by un\n founded litigation” could both “cause a deflection of the prosecutor’s\n energies from his public duties” and lead him to “shade his decisions\n instead of exercising the independence of judgment required by his\n2                      VAN DE KAMP v. GOLDSTEIN\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    public trust,” id., at 423. However, absolute immunity may not apply\n    when a prosecutor is not acting as “an officer of the court,” but is in\n    stead engaged in, say, investigative or administrative tasks. Id., at\n    431, n. 33. To decide whether absolute immunity attaches to a par\n    ticular prosecutorial activity, one must take account of Imbler’s\n    “functional” considerations. The fact that one constitutional duty in\n    Imbler was positive (the duty to supply “information relevant to the\n    defense”) rather than negative (the duty not to “use . . . perjured tes\n    timony”) was not critical to the finding of absolute immunity. Pp. 3–\n    6.\n       (b) Although Goldstein challenges administrative procedures, they\n    are procedures that are directly connected with a trial’s conduct. A\n    prosecutor’s error in a specific criminal trial constitutes an essential\n    element of the plaintiff’s claim. The obligations here are thus unlike\n    administrative duties concerning, e.g., workplace hiring. Moreover,\n    they necessarily require legal knowledge and the exercise of related\n    discretion, e.g., in determining what information should be included\n    in training, supervision, or information-system management. Given\n    these features, absolute immunity must follow. Pp. 6–12.\n         (1) Had Goldstein brought a suit directly attacking supervisory\n    prosecutors’ actions related to an individual trial, instead of one in\n    volving administration, all the prosecutors would have enjoyed abso\n    lute immunity under Imbler. Their behavior, individually or sepa\n    rately, would have involved “[p]reparation . . . for . . . trial,” 424 U. S.,\n    at 431, n. 33, and would have been “intimately associated with the\n    judicial phase of the criminal process,” id., at 430. The only differ\n    ence between Imbler and the hypothetical, i.e., that a supervisor or\n    colleague might be liable instead of the trial prosecutor, is not criti\n    cal. Pp. 7–8.\n         (2) Just as supervisory prosecutors are immune in a suit directly\n    attacking their actions in an individual trial, they are immune here.\n    The fact that the office’s general supervision and training methods\n    are at issue is not a critical difference for present purposes. The rele\n    vant management tasks concern how and when to make impeach\n    ment information available at trial, and, thus, are directly connected\n    with a prosecutor’s basic trial advocacy duties. In terms of Imbler’s\n    functional concerns, a suit claiming that a supervisor made a mistake\n    directly related to a particular trial and one claiming that a supervi\n    sor trained and supervised inadequately seem very much alike. The\n    type of “faulty training” claim here rests in part on a consequent er\n    ror by an individual prosecutor in the midst of trial. If, as Imbler\n    says, the threat of damages liability for such an error could lead a\n    trial prosecutor to take account of that risk when making trial\n    related decisions, so, too, could the threat of more widespread liabil\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  ity throughout the office lead both that prosecutor and other office\n  prosecutors to take account of such a risk. Because better training or\n  supervision might prevent most prosecutorial errors at trial, permis\n  sion to bring suit here would grant criminal defendants permission to\n  bring claims for other trial-related training or supervisory failings.\n  Further, such suits could “pose substantial danger of liability even to\n  the honest prosecutor.” Imbler, 425 U. S., at 425. And defending\n  prosecutorial decisions, often years later, could impose “unique and\n  intolerable burdens upon a prosecutor responsible annually for hun\n  dreds of indictments and trials.” Id., at 425–426. Permitting this\n  suit to go forward would also create practical anomalies. A trial\n  prosecutor would remain immune for intentional misconduct, while\n  her supervisor might be liable for negligent training or supervision.\n  And the ease with which a plaintiff could restyle a complaint charg\n  ing trial failure to one charging a training or supervision failure\n  would eviscerate Imbler. Pp. 8–11.\n       (3) The differences between an information management system\n  and training or supervision do not require a different outcome, for the\n  critical element of any information system is the information it con\n  tains. Deciding what to include and what not to include is little dif\n  ferent from making similar decisions regarding training, for it re\n  quires knowledge of the law. Moreover, were this claim allowed, a\n  court would have to review the office’s legal judgments, not simply\n  about whether to have an information system but also about what\n  kind of system is appropriate, and whether an appropriate system\n  would have included Giglio-related information about one particular\n  kind of informant. Such decisions—whether made before or during\n  trial—are “intimately associated with the judicial phase of the crimi\n  nal process,” Imbler, supra, at 430, and all Imbler’s functional consid\n  erations apply.

Stat. §1979, 42\nU. S. C. §1983. See Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409\n(1976). We ask whether that immunity extends to claims\nthat the prosecution failed to disclose impeachment mate\nrial, see Giglio v. United States, 405 U. S. 150 (1972), due\nto: (1) a failure properly to train prosecutors, (2) a failure\nproperly to supervise prosecutors, or (3) a failure to estab\nlish an information system containing potential impeach\nment material about informants. We conclude that a\nprosecutor’s absolute immunity extends to all these\nclaims.\n                             I\n   In 1998, respondent Thomas Goldstein (then a prisoner)\nfiled a habeas corpus action in the Federal District Court\nfor the Central District of California. He claimed that in\n1980 he was convicted of murder; that his conviction\ndepended in critical part upon the testimony of Edward\nFloyd Fink, a jailhouse informant; that Fink’s testimony\nwas unreliable, indeed false; that Fink had previously\n2               VAN DE KAMP v. GOLDSTEIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreceived reduced sentences for providing prosecutors with\nfavorable testimony in other cases; that at least some\nprosecutors in the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s\nOffice knew about the favorable treatment; that the office\nhad not provided Goldstein’s attorney with that informa\ntion; and that, among other things, the prosecution’s\nfailure to provide Goldstein’s attorney with this potential\nimpeachment information had led to his erroneous convic\ntion. Goldstein v. Long Beach, 481 F. 3d 1170, 1171–1172\n(CA9 2007).\n   After an evidentiary hearing the District Court agreed\nwith Goldstein that Fink had not been truthful and that if\nthe prosecution had told Goldstein’s lawyer that Fink had\nreceived prior rewards in return for favorable testimony it\nmight have made a difference. The court ordered the\nState either to grant Goldstein a new trial or to release\nhim. The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s\ndetermination. And the State decided that, rather than\nretry Goldstein (who had already served 24 years of his\nsentence), it would release him. App. 54–55, 59–60.\n   Upon his release Goldstein filed this §1983 action\nagainst petitioners, the former Los Angeles County dis\ntrict attorney and chief deputy district attorney. Gold\nstein’s complaint (which for present purposes we take as\naccurate) asserts in relevant part that the prosecution’s\nfailure to communicate to his attorney the facts about\nFink’s earlier testimony-related rewards violated the\nprosecution’s constitutional duty to “insure communication\nof all relevant information on each case [including agree\nments made with informants] to every lawyer who deals\nwith it.” Giglio, supra, at 154. Moreover, it alleges that\nthis failure resulted from the failure of petitioners (the\noffice’s chief supervisory attorneys) adequately to train\nand to supervise the prosecutors who worked for them as\nwell as their failure to establish an information system\nabout informants. And it asks for damages based upon\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthese training, supervision, and information-system re\nlated failings.\n  Petitioners, claiming absolute immunity from such a\n§1983 action, asked the District Court to dismiss the\ncomplaint. See Imbler, supra. The District Court denied\nthe motion to dismiss on the ground that the conduct\nasserted amounted to “administrative,” not “prosecuto\nrial,” conduct; hence it fell outside the scope of the prose\ncutor’s absolute immunity to §1983 claims. The Ninth\nCircuit, considering petitioners’ claim on an interlocutory\nappeal, affirmed the District Court’s “no immunity” de\ntermination. We now review the Ninth Circuit’s decision,\nand we reverse its determination.\n                             II\n  A half-century ago Chief Judge Learned Hand explained\nthat a prosecutor’s absolute immunity reflects “a balance”\nof “evils.” Gregoire v. Biddle, 177 F. 2d 579, 581 (CA2\n1949). “[I]t has been thought in the end better,” he said,\n“to leave unredressed the wrongs done by dishonest offi\ncers than to subject those who try to do their duty to the\nconstant dread of retaliation.” Ibid. In Imbler, supra, this\nCourt considered prosecutorial actions that are “inti\nmately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal\nprocess.” Id., at 430. And, referring to Chief Judge\nHand’s views, it held that prosecutors are absolutely\nimmune from liability in §1983 lawsuits brought under\nsuch circumstances. Id., at 428.\n  The §1983 action at issue was that of a prisoner freed on\na writ of habeas corpus who subsequently sought damages\nfrom his former prosecutor. His action, like the action now\nbefore us, tracked the claims that a federal court had\nfound valid when granting his habeas corpus petition. In\nparticular, the prisoner claimed that the trial prosecutor\nhad permitted a fingerprint expert to give false testimony,\nthat the prosecutor was responsible for the expert’s having\n4                VAN DE KAMP v. GOLDSTEIN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsuppressed important evidence, and that the prosecutor\nhad introduced a misleading artist’s sketch into evidence.\nId., at 416.\n   In concluding that the prosecutor was absolutely im\nmune, the Court pointed out that legislators have long\n“enjoyed absolute immunity for their official actions,” id.,\nat 417; that the common law granted immunity to “judges\nand . . . jurors acting within the scope of their duties,” id.,\nat 423, and that the law had also granted prosecutors\nabsolute immunity from common-law tort actions, say,\nthose underlying a “decision to initiate a prosecution,” id.,\nat 421. The Court then held that the “same considerations\nof public policy that underlie” a prosecutor’s common-law\nimmunity “countenance absolute immunity under §1983.”\nId., at 424. Those considerations, the Court said, arise out\nof the general common-law “concern that harassment by\nunfounded litigation” could both “cause a deflection of the\nprosecutor’s energies from his public duties” and also lead\nthe prosecutor to “shade his decisions instead of exercising\nthe independence of judgment required by his public\ntrust.” Id., at 423.\n   Where §1983 actions are at issue, the Court said, both\nsets of concerns are present and serious. The “public trust\nof the prosecutor’s office would suffer” were the prosecutor\nto have in mind his “own potential” damages “liability”\nwhen making prosecutorial decisions—as he might well\nwere he subject to §1983 liability. Id., at 424. This is no\nsmall concern, given the frequency with which criminal\ndefendants bring such suits, id., at 425 (“[A] defendant\noften will transform his resentment at being prosecuted\ninto the ascription of improper and malicious actions to\nthe State’s advocate”), and the “substantial danger of\nliability even to the honest prosecutor” that such suits\npose when they survive pretrial dismissal, ibid.; see also\nibid. (complex, close, fair-trial questions “often would\nrequire a virtual retrial of the criminal offense in a new\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nforum, and the resolution of some technical issues by the\nlay jury”). A “prosecutor,” the Court noted, “inevitably\nmakes many decisions that could engender colorable\nclaims of constitutional deprivation. Defending these\ndecisions, often years after they were made, could impose\nunique and intolerable burdens upon a prosecutor respon\nsible annually for hundreds of indictments and trials.” Id.,\nat 425–426. The Court thus rejected the idea of applying\nthe less-than-absolute “qualified immunity” that the law\naccords to other “executive or administrative officials,”\nnoting that the “honest prosecutor would face greater\ndifficulty” than would those officials “in meeting the stan\ndards of qualified immunity.” Id., at 425. Accordingly, the\nimmunity that the law grants prosecutors is “absolute.”\nId., at 424.\n  The Court made clear that absolute immunity may not\napply when a prosecutor is not acting as “an officer of the\ncourt,” but is instead engaged in other tasks, say, investi\ngative or administrative tasks. Id., at 431, n. 33. To\ndecide whether absolute immunity attaches to a particular\nkind of prosecutorial activity, one must take account of the\n“functional” considerations discussed above. See Burns v.\nReed, 500 U. S. 478, 486 (1991) (collecting cases applying\n“functional approach” to immunity); Kalina v. Fletcher,\n522 U. S. 118, 127, 130 (1997). In Imbler, the Court con\ncluded that the “reasons for absolute immunity appl[ied]\nwith full force” to the conduct at issue because it was\n“intimately associated with the judicial phase of the\ncriminal process.” 424 U. S., at 430. The fact that one\nconstitutional duty at issue was a positive duty (the duty\nto supply “information relevant to the defense”) rather\nthan a negative duty (the duty not to “use . . . perjured\ntestimony”) made no difference. After all, a plaintiff can\noften transform a positive into a negative duty simply by\nreframing the pleadings; in either case, a constitutional\nviolation is at issue. Id., at 431, n. 34.\n6                VAN DE KAMP v. GOLDSTEIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Finally, the Court specifically reserved the question\nwhether or when “similar reasons require immunity for\nthose aspects of the prosecutor’s responsibility that cast\nhim in the role of an administrator . . . rather than that of\nadvocate.” Id., at 430–431. It said that “[d]rawing a\nproper line between these functions may present difficult\nquestions, but this case does not require us to anticipate\nthem.” Id., at 431, n. 33.\n   In the years since Imbler, we have held that absolute\nimmunity applies when a prosecutor prepares to initiate a\njudicial proceeding, Burns, supra, at 492, or appears in\ncourt to present evidence in support of a search warrant\napplication, Kalina, supra, at 126. We have held that\nabsolute immunity does not apply when a prosecutor gives\nadvice to police during a criminal investigation, see Burns,\nsupra, at 496, when the prosecutor makes statements to\nthe press, Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U. S. 259, 277\n(1993), or when a prosecutor acts as a complaining witness\nin support of a warrant application, Kalina, supra, at\n132 (SCALIA, J., concurring). This case, unlike these\nearlier cases, requires us to consider how immunity ap\nplies where a prosecutor is engaged in certain administra\ntive activities.\n                             III\n  Goldstein claims that the district attorney and his chief\nassistant violated their constitutional obligation to provide\nhis attorney with impeachment-related information, see\nGiglio, 405 U. S. 150, because, as the Court of Appeals\nwrote, they failed “to adequately train and supervise\ndeputy district attorneys on that subject,” 481 F. 3d, at\n1176, and because, as Goldstein’s complaint adds, they\n“failed to create any system for the Deputy District Attor\nneys handling criminal cases to access information per\ntaining to the benefits provided to jailhouse informants\nand other impeachment information.” App. 45. We agree\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwith Goldstein that, in making these claims, he attacks\nthe office’s administrative procedures. We are also willing\nto assume with Goldstein, but purely for argument’s sake,\nthat Giglio imposes certain obligations as to training,\nsupervision, or information-system management.\n   Even so, we conclude that prosecutors involved in such\nsupervision or training or information-system manage\nment enjoy absolute immunity from the kind of legal\nclaims at issue here. Those claims focus upon a certain\nkind of administrative obligation—a kind that itself is\ndirectly connected with the conduct of a trial. Here, unlike\nwith other claims related to administrative decisions, an\nindividual prosecutor’s error in the plaintiff’s specific\ncriminal trial constitutes an essential element of the\nplaintiff’s claim. The administrative obligations at issue\nhere are thus unlike administrative duties concerning, for\nexample, workplace hiring, payroll administration, the\nmaintenance of physical facilities, and the like. Moreover,\nthe types of activities on which Goldstein’s claims focus\nnecessarily require legal knowledge and the exercise of\nrelated discretion, e.g., in determining what information\nshould be included in the training or the supervision or\nthe information-system management. And in that sense\nalso Goldstein’s claims are unlike claims of, say, unlawful\ndiscrimination in hiring employees. Given these features\nof the case before us, we believe absolute immunity must\nfollow.\n                             A\n  We reach this conclusion by initially considering a hypo\nthetical case that involves supervisory or other office\nprosecutors but does not involve administration. Suppose\nthat Goldstein had brought such a case, seeking damages\nnot only from the trial prosecutor but also from a supervi\nsory prosecutor or from the trial prosecutor’s colleagues—\nall on the ground that they should have found and turned\n8                 VAN DE KAMP v. GOLDSTEIN\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nover the impeachment material about Fink. Imbler makes\nclear that all these prosecutors would enjoy absolute\nimmunity from such a suit. The prosecutors’ behavior,\ntaken individually or separately, would involve “[p]repara\ntion . . . for . . . trial,” 424 U. S., at 431, n. 33, and would be\n“intimately associated with the judicial phase of the\ncriminal process” because it concerned the evidence pre\nsented at trial. Id., at 430. And all of the considerations\nthat this Court found to militate in favor of absolute im\nmunity in Imbler would militate in favor of immunity in\nsuch a case.\n   The only difference we can find between Imbler and our\nhypothetical case lies in the fact that, in our hypothetical\ncase, a prosecutorial supervisor or colleague might himself\nbe liable for damages instead of the trial prosecutor. But\nwe cannot find that difference (in the pattern of liability\namong prosecutors within a single office) to be critical.\nDecisions about indictment or trial prosecution will often\ninvolve more than one prosecutor within an office. We do\nnot see how such differences in the pattern of liability\namong a group of prosecutors in a single office could alle\nviate Imbler’s basic fear, namely, that the threat of dam\nages liability would affect the way in which prosecutors\ncarried out their basic court-related tasks. Moreover, this\nCourt has pointed out that “it is the interest in protecting\nthe proper functioning of the office, rather than the inter\nest in protecting its occupant, that is of primary impor\ntance.” Kalina, 522 U. S., at 125. Thus, we must assume\nthat the prosecutors in our hypothetical suit would enjoy\nabsolute immunity.\n                             B\n  Once we determine that supervisory prosecutors are\nimmune in a suit directly attacking their actions related to\nan individual trial, we must find they are similarly im\nmune in the case before us. We agree with the Court of\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nAppeals that the office’s general methods of supervision\nand training are at issue here, but we do not agree that\nthat difference is critical for present purposes. That dif\nference does not preclude an intimate connection between\nprosecutorial activity and the trial process. The manage\nment tasks at issue, insofar as they are relevant, concern\nhow and when to make impeachment information avail\nable at a trial. They are thereby directly connected with\nthe prosecutor’s basic trial advocacy duties. And, in terms\nof Imbler’s functional concerns, a suit charging that a\nsupervisor made a mistake directly related to a particular\ntrial, on the one hand, and a suit charging that a supervi\nsor trained and supervised inadequately, on the other,\nwould seem very much alike.\n   That is true, in part, for the practical reason that it will\noften prove difficult to draw a line between general office\nsupervision or office training (say, related to Giglio) and\nspecific supervision or training related to a particular\ncase. To permit claims based upon the former is almost\ninevitably to permit the bringing of claims that include the\nlatter. It is also true because one cannot easily distin\nguish, for immunity purposes, between claims based upon\ntraining or supervisory failures related to Giglio and\nsimilar claims related to other constitutional matters\n(obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963),\nfor example). And that being so, every consideration that\nImbler mentions militates in favor of immunity.\n   As we have said, the type of “faulty training” claim at\nissue here rests in necessary part upon a consequent error\nby an individual prosecutor in the midst of trial, namely,\nthe plaintiff’s trial. If, as Imbler says, the threat of dam\nages liability for such an error could lead a trial prosecutor\nto take account of that risk when making trial-related\ndecisions, so, too, could the threat of more widespread\nliability throughout the office (ultimately traceable to that\ntrial error) lead both that prosecutor and other office\n10              VAN DE KAMP v. GOLDSTEIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprosecutors as well to take account of such a risk. Indeed,\nmembers of a large prosecutorial office, when making\nprosecutorial decisions, could have in mind the “conse\nquences in terms of” damages liability whether they are\nmaking general decisions about supervising or training or\nwhether they are making individual trial-related deci\nsions. Imbler, 424 U. S., at 424.\n   Moreover, because better training or supervision might\nprevent most, if not all, prosecutorial errors at trial, per\nmission to bring such a suit here would grant permission\nto criminal defendants to bring claims in other similar\ninstances, in effect claiming damages for (trial-related)\ntraining or supervisory failings. Cf. Imbler, supra. Fur\nther, given the complexity of the constitutional issues,\ninadequate training and supervision suits could, as in\nImbler, “pose substantial danger of liability even to the\nhonest prosecutor.” Id., at 425. Finally, as Imbler pointed\nout, defending prosecutorial decisions, often years after\nthey were made, could impose “unique and intolerable\nburdens upon a prosecutor responsible annually for hun\ndreds of indictments and trials.” Id., at 425–426.\n   At the same time, to permit this suit to go forward\nwould create practical anomalies. A trial prosecutor\nwould remain immune, even for intentionally failing to\nturn over, say Giglio material; but her supervisor might be\nliable for negligent training or supervision. Small prosecu\ntion offices where supervisors can personally participate in\nall of the cases would likewise remain immune from prose\ncution; but large offices, making use of more general office\nwide supervision and training, would not. Most impor\ntant, the ease with which a plaintiff could restyle a com\nplaint charging a trial failure so that it becomes a com\nplaint charging a failure of training or supervision would\neviscerate Imbler.\n   We conclude that the very reasons that led this Court in\nImbler to find absolute immunity require a similar finding\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin this case. We recognize, as Chief Judge Hand pointed\nout, that sometimes such immunity deprives a plaintiff of\ncompensation that he undoubtedly merits; but the im\npediments to the fair, efficient functioning of a prosecuto\nrial office that liability could create lead us to find that\nImbler must apply here.\n                              C\n   We treat separately Goldstein’s claim that the Los\nAngeles County District Attorney’s Office should have\nestablished a system that would have permitted prosecu\ntors “handling criminal cases to access information per\ntaining to the benefits provided to jailhouse informants\nand other impeachment information.” App. 45. We do so\nbecause Goldstein argues that the creation of an informa\ntion management system is a more purely administrative\ntask, less closely related to the “judicial phase of the\ncriminal process,” Imbler, supra, at 430, than are supervi\nsory or training tasks. He adds that technically qualified\nindividuals other than prosecutors could create such a\nsystem and that they could do so prior to the initiation of\ncriminal proceedings.\n   In our view, however, these differences do not require a\ndifferent outcome. The critical element of any information\nsystem is the information it contains. Deciding what to\ninclude and what not to include in an information system\nis little different from making similar decisions in respect\nto training. Again, determining the criteria for inclusion\nor exclusion requires knowledge of the law.\n   Moreover, the absence of an information system is rele\nvant here if, and only if, a proper system would have\nincluded information about the informant Fink. Thus,\nwere this claim allowed, a court would have to review the\noffice’s legal judgments, not simply about whether to have\nan information system but also about what kind of system\nis appropriate, and whether an appropriate system would\n12               VAN DE KAMP v. GOLDSTEIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhave included Giglio-related information about one par\nticular kind of trial informant. Such decisions—whether\nmade prior to or during a particular trial—are “intimately\nassociated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.”\nImbler, supra, at 430; see Burns, 500 U. S., at 486. And,\nfor the reasons set out above, all Imbler’s functional con\nsiderations (and the anomalies we mentioned earlier,\nsupra, at 10) apply here as well.\n   We recognize that sometimes it would be easy for a\ncourt to determine that an office’s decision about an in\nformation system was inadequate. Suppose, for example,\nthe office had no system at all. But the same could be said\nof a prosecutor’s trial error. Immunity does not exist to\nhelp prosecutors in the easy case; it exists because the\neasy cases bring difficult cases in their wake. And, as\nImbler pointed out, the likely presence of too many diffi\ncult cases threatens, not prosecutors, but the public, for\nthe reason that it threatens to undermine the necessary\nindependence and integrity of the prosecutorial decision\nmaking process. Such is true of the kinds of claims before\nus, to all of which Imbler’s functional considerations apply.\nConsequently, where a §1983 plaintiff claims that a prose\ncutor’s management of a trial-related information system\nis responsible for a constitutional error at his or her par\nticular trial, the prosecutor responsible for the system\nenjoys absolute immunity just as would the prosecutor\nwho handled the particular trial itself.\n                        *     *  *\n  For these reasons we conclude that petitioners are\nentitled to absolute immunity in respect to Goldstein’s\nclaims that their supervision, training, or information\nsystem management was constitutionally inadequate.\nAccordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is re\nversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145911/", "sha1": "4742b3a6c4b3b759da8d390ac47a62db84bca474", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-020", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:09:24"}
