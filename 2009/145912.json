JOHNSON\n\n      CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF ARIZONA\n\n No. 07–1122. Argued December 9, 2008—Decided January 26, 2009\nIn Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, this Court held that a “stop and frisk”\n  may be conducted without violating the Fourth Amendment’s ban on\n  unreasonable searches and seizures if two conditions are met. First,\n  the investigatory stop (temporary detention) must be lawful, a re\n  quirement met in an on-the-street encounter when a police officer\n  reasonably suspects that the person apprehended is committing or\n  has committed a crime. Second, to proceed from a stop to a frisk\n  (patdown for weapons), the officer must reasonably suspect that the\n  person stopped is armed and dangerous. For the duration of a traffic\n  stop, the Court recently confirmed, a police officer effectively seizes\n  “everyone in the vehicle,” the driver and all passengers. Brendlin v.\n  California, 551 U. S. 249, 255.\n     While patrolling near a Tucson neighborhood associated with the\n  Crips gang, police officers serving on Arizona’s gang task force\n  stopped an automobile for a vehicular infraction warranting a cita\n  tion. At the time of the stop, the officers had no reason to suspect the\n  car’s occupants of criminal activity. Officer Trevizo attended to re\n  spondent Johnson, the back-seat passenger, whose behavior and\n  clothing caused Trevizo to question him. After learning that Johnson\n  was from a town with a Crips gang and had been in prison, Trevizo\n  asked him get out of the car in order to question him further, out of\n  the hearing of the front-seat passenger, about his gang affiliation.\n  Because she suspected that he was armed, she patted him down for\n  safety when he exited the car. During the patdown, she felt the butt\n  of a gun. At that point, Johnson began to struggle, and Trevizo hand\n  cuffed him. Johnson was charged with, inter alia, possession of a\n  weapon by a prohibited possessor. The trial court denied his motion\n  to suppress the evidence, concluding that the stop was lawful and\n  that Trevizo had cause to suspect Johnson was armed and dangerous.\n2                        ARIZONA v. JOHNSON\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    Johnson was convicted. The Arizona Court of Appeals reversed.\n    While recognizing that Johnson was lawfully seized, the court found\n    that, prior to the frisk, the detention had evolved into a consensual\n    conversation about his gang affiliation. Trevizo, the court therefore\n    concluded, had no right to pat Johnson down even if she had reason\n    to suspect he was armed and dangerous. The Arizona Supreme\n    Court denied review.\nHeld: Officer Trevizo’s patdown of Johnson did not violate the Fourth\n Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures.\n Pp. 5–9.\n    (a) Terry established that, in an investigatory stop based on rea\n sonably grounded suspicion of criminal activity, the police must be\n positioned to act instantly if they have reasonable cause to suspect\n that the persons temporarily detained are armed and dangerous. 392\n U. S., at 24. Because a limited search of outer clothing for weapons\n serves to protect both the officer and the public, a patdown is consti\n tutional. Id., at 23–24, 27, 30–31. Traffic stops, which “resemble, in\n duration and atmosphere, the kind of brief detention authorized in\n Terry,” Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 439, n. 29, are “especially\n fraught with danger to police officers,” Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S.\n 1032, 1047, who may minimize the risk of harm by exercising “ ‘un\n questioned command of the situation,’ ” Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U. S.\n 408, 414. Three decisions cumulatively portray Terry’s application in\n a traffic-stop setting. In Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U. S. 106 (per\n curiam), the Court held that “once a motor vehicle has been lawfully\n detained for a traffic violation, the police officers may order the driver\n to get out of the vehicle without violating the Fourth Amendment,”\n id., at 111, n. 6, because the government’s “legitimate and weighty”\n interest in officer safety outweighs the “de minimis” additional intru\n sion of requiring a driver, already lawfully stopped, to exit the vehi\n cle, id., at 110–111. Citing Terry, the Court further held that a\n driver, once outside the stopped vehicle, may be patted down for\n weapons if the officer reasonably concludes that the driver might be\n armed and dangerous. 434 U. S., at 112. Wilson, 519 U. S., at 413,\n held that the Mimms rule applies to passengers as well as drivers,\n based on “the same weighty interest in officer safety.” Brendlin, 551\n U. S., at 263, held that a passenger is seized, just as the driver is,\n “from the moment [a car stopped by the police comes] to a halt on the\n side of the road.” A passenger’s motivation to use violence during the\n stop to prevent apprehension for a crime more grave than a traffic\n violation is just as great as that of the driver. 519 U. S., at 414. And\n as “the passengers are already stopped by virtue of the stop of the\n vehicle,” id., at 413–414, “the additional intrusion on the passenger is\n minimal,” id., at 415. Pp. 5–7.\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n     (b) The Arizona Court of Appeals recognized that, initially, Johnson\n  was lawfully detained incident to the legitimate stop of the vehicle in\n  which he was a passenger, but concluded that once Officer Trevizo\n  began questioning him on a matter unrelated to the traffic stop, pat\n  down authority ceased to exist, absent reasonable suspicion that\n  Johnson had engaged, or was about to engage, in criminal activity.\n  The court portrayed the interrogation as consensual, and, Johnson\n  emphasizes, Trevizo testified that Johnson could have refused to exit\n  the vehicle and to submit to the patdown. But Trevizo also testified\n  that she never advised Johnson he did not have to answer her ques\n  tions or otherwise cooperate with her. A lawful roadside stop begins\n  when a vehicle is pulled over for investigation of a traffic violation.\n  The temporary seizure of driver and passengers ordinarily continues,\n  and remains reasonable, for the duration of the stop. Normally, the\n  stop ends when the police have no further need to control the scene,\n  and inform the driver and passengers they are free to leave. An offi\n  cer’s inquiries into matters unrelated to the justification for the traf\n  fic stop do not convert the encounter into something other than a law\n  ful seizure, so long as the inquiries do not measurably extend the\n  stop’s duration. See Muehler v. Mena, 544 U. S. 93, 100–101. A rea\n  sonable passenger would understand that during the time a car is\n  lawfully stopped, he or she is not free to terminate the encounter\n  with the police and move about at will. Nothing occurred in this case\n  that would have conveyed to Johnson that, prior to the frisk, the traf\n  fic stop had ended or that he was otherwise free “to depart without\n  police permission.” Brendlin, 551 U. S., at 257. Trevizo was not re\n  quired by the Fourth Amendment to give Johnson an opportunity to\n  depart without first ensuring that, in so doing, she was not permit\n  ting a dangerous person to get behind her.

LEMON MONTREA \n\n                    JOHNSON \n\n   ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF \n\n                 ARIZONA, DIVISION TWO\n\n                               [January 26, 2009]\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case concerns the authority of police officers to\n“stop and frisk” a passenger in a motor vehicle temporarily\nseized upon police detection of a traffic infraction. In a\npathmarking decision, Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968),\nthe Court considered whether an investigatory stop (tem\nporary detention) and frisk (patdown for weapons) may be\nconducted without violating the Fourth Amendment’s ban\non unreasonable searches and seizures. The Court upheld\n“stop and frisk” as constitutionally permissible if two\nconditions are met. First, the investigatory stop must be\nlawful. That requirement is met in an on-the-street en\ncounter, Terry determined, when the police officer rea\nsonably suspects that the person apprehended is commit\nting or has committed a criminal offense. Second, to\nproceed from a stop to a frisk, the police officer must rea\nsonably suspect that the person stopped is armed and\ndangerous.\n  For the duration of a traffic stop, we recently confirmed,\na police officer effectively seizes “everyone in the vehicle,”\nthe driver and all passengers. Brendlin v. California, 551\n2                  ARIZONA v. JOHNSON\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. 249, 255 (2007). Accordingly, we hold that, in a\ntraffic-stop setting, the first Terry condition—a lawful\ninvestigatory stop—is met whenever it is lawful for police\nto detain an automobile and its occupants pending inquiry\ninto a vehicular violation. The police need not have, in\naddition, cause to believe any occupant of the vehicle is\ninvolved in criminal activity. To justify a patdown of the\ndriver or a passenger during a traffic stop, however, just\nas in the case of a pedestrian reasonably suspected of\ncriminal activity, the police must harbor reasonable suspi\ncion that the person subjected to the frisk is armed and\ndangerous.\n                              I\n   On April 19, 2002, Officer Maria Trevizo and Detectives\nMachado and Gittings, all members of Arizona’s gang task\nforce, were on patrol in Tucson near a neighborhood asso\nciated with the Crips gang. At approximately 9 p.m., the\nofficers pulled over an automobile after a license plate\ncheck revealed that the vehicle’s registration had been\nsuspended for an insurance-related violation. Under\nArizona law, the violation for which the vehicle was\nstopped constituted a civil infraction warranting a cita\ntion. At the time of the stop, the vehicle had three occu\npants—the driver, a front-seat passenger, and a passenger\nin the back seat, Lemon Montrea Johnson, the respondent\nhere. In making the stop the officers had no reason to\nsuspect anyone in the vehicle of criminal activity. See\nApp. 29–30.\n   The three officers left their patrol car and approached\nthe stopped vehicle. Machado instructed all of the occu\npants to keep their hands visible. Id., at 14. He asked\nwhether there were any weapons in the vehicle; all re\nsponded no. Id., at 15. Machado then directed the driver\nto get out of the car. Gittings dealt with the front-seat\npassenger, who stayed in the vehicle throughout the stop.\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSee id., at 31. While Machado was getting the driver’s\nlicense and information about the vehicle’s registra\ntion and insurance, see id., at 42–43, Trevizo attended to\nJohnson.\n   Trevizo noticed that, as the police approached, Johnson\nlooked back and kept his eyes on the officers. Id., at 12.\nWhen she drew near, she observed that Johnson was\nwearing clothing, including a blue bandana, that she\nconsidered consistent with Crips membership. Id., at 17.\nShe also noticed a scanner in Johnson’s jacket pocket,\nwhich “struck [her] as highly unusual and cause [for]\nconcern,” because “most people” would not carry around a\nscanner that way “unless they’re going to be involved in\nsome kind of criminal activity or [are] going to try to evade\nthe police by listening to the scanner.” Id., at 16. In\nresponse to Trevizo’s questions, Johnson provided his\nname and date of birth but said he had no identification\nwith him. He volunteered that he was from Eloy, Arizona,\na place Trevizo knew was home to a Crips gang. Johnson\nfurther told Trevizo that he had served time in prison for\nburglary and had been out for about a year. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n60, 170 P. 3d 667, 669 (App. 2007).\n   Trevizo wanted to question Johnson away from the\nfront-seat passenger to gain “intelligence about the gang\n[Johnson] might be in.” App. 19. For that reason, she\nasked him to get out of the car. Ibid. Johnson complied.\nBased on Trevizo’s observations and Johnson’s answers to\nher questions while he was still seated in the car, Trevizo\nsuspected that “he might have a weapon on him.” Id., at\n20. When he exited the vehicle, she therefore “patted him\ndown for officer safety.” Ibid. During the patdown, Tre\nvizo felt the butt of a gun near Johnson’s waist. 217 Ariz.,\nat 60, 170 P. 3d, at 669. At that point Johnson began to\nstruggle, and Trevizo placed him in handcuffs. Ibid.\n   Johnson was charged in state court with, inter alia,\npossession of a weapon by a prohibited possessor. He\n4                   ARIZONA v. JOHNSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmoved to suppress the evidence as the fruit of an unlawful\nsearch. The trial court denied the motion, concluding that\nthe stop was lawful and that Trevizo had cause to suspect\nJohnson was armed and dangerous. See App. 74–78. A\njury convicted Johnson of the gun-possession charge. See\n217 Ariz., at 60–61, 170 P. 3d, at 669–670.\n   A divided panel of the Arizona Court of Appeals re\nversed Johnson’s conviction. Id., at 59, 170 P. 3d, at 668.\nRecognizing that “Johnson was [lawfully] seized when the\nofficers stopped the car,” id., at 62, 170 P. 3d, at 671, the\ncourt nevertheless concluded that prior to the frisk the\ndetention had “evolved into a separate, consensual en\ncounter stemming from an unrelated investigation by\nTrevizo of Johnson’s possible gang affiliation,” id., at 64,\n170 P. 3d, at 673. Absent “reason to believe Johnson was\ninvolved in criminal activity,” the Arizona appeals court\nheld, Trevizo “had no right to pat him down for weapons,\neven if she had reason to suspect he was armed and dan\ngerous.” Ibid.\n   Judge Espinosa dissented. He found it “highly unrealis\ntic to conclude that merely because [Trevizo] was courte\nous and Johnson cooperative, the ongoing and virtually\nsimultaneous chain of events [had] somehow ‘evolved into\na consensual encounter’ in the few short moments in\nvolved.” Id., at 66, 170 P. 3d, at 675. Throughout the\nepisode, he stressed, Johnson remained “seized as part of\n[a] valid traffic stop.” Ibid. Further, he maintained,\nTrevizo “had a reasonable basis to consider [Johnson]\ndangerous,” id., at 67, 170 P. 3d, at 676, and could there\nfore ensure her own safety and that of others at the scene\nby patting down Johnson for weapons.\n   The Arizona Supreme Court denied review. No. CR–07–\n0290–PR, 2007 Ariz. LEXIS 154 (Nov. 29, 2007). We\ngranted certiorari, 554 U.

S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               II \n\n                               A\n\n   We begin our consideration of the constitutionality of\nOfficer Trevizo’s patdown of Johnson by looking back to\nthe Court’s leading decision in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1\n(1968). Terry involved a stop for interrogation of men\nwhose conduct had attracted the attention of a patrolling\npolice officer. The officer’s observation led him reasonably\nto suspect that the men were casing a jewelry shop in\npreparation for a robbery. He conducted a patdown, which\ndisclosed weapons concealed in the men’s overcoat pockets.\nThis Court upheld the lower courts’ determinations that\nthe interrogation was warranted and the patdown, per\nmissible. See id., at 8.\n   Terry established the legitimacy of an investigatory stop\n“in situations where [the police] may lack probable cause\nfor an arrest.” Id., at 24. When the stop is justified by\nsuspicion (reasonably grounded, but short of probable\ncause) that criminal activity is afoot, the Court explained,\nthe police officer must be positioned to act instantly on\nreasonable suspicion that the persons temporarily de\ntained are armed and dangerous. Ibid. Recognizing that\na limited search of outer clothing for weapons serves to\nprotect both the officer and the public, the Court held the\npatdown reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. Id., at\n23–24, 27, 30–31.\n   “[M]ost traffic stops,” this Court has observed, “resem\nble, in duration and atmosphere, the kind of brief deten\ntion authorized in Terry.” Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S.\n420, 439, n. 29 (1984). Furthermore, the Court has recog\nnized that traffic stops are “especially fraught with danger\nto police officers.” Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1047\n(1983). “ ‘The risk of harm to both the police and the occu\npants [of a stopped vehicle] is minimized,’ ” we have\nstressed, “ ‘if the officers routinely exercise unquestioned\ncommand of the situation.’ ” Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U. S.\n6                   ARIZONA v. JOHNSON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n408, 414 (1997) (quoting Michigan v. Summers, 452 U. S.\n692, 702–703 (1981)); see Brendlin, 551 U. S., at 258.\nThree decisions cumulatively portray Terry’s application\nin a traffic-stop setting: Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U. S.\n106 (1977) (per curiam); Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U. S. 408\n(1997); and Brendlin v. California, 551 U. S. 249 (2007).\n  In Mimms, the Court held that “once a motor vehicle\nhas been lawfully detained for a traffic violation, the police\nofficers may order the driver to get out of the vehicle\nwithout violating the Fourth Amendment’s proscription of\nunreasonable searches and seizures.” 434 U. S., at 111,\nn. 6. The government’s “legitimate and weighty” interest\nin officer safety, the Court said, outweighs the “de mini\nmis” additional intrusion of requiring a driver, already\nlawfully stopped, to exit the vehicle. Id., at 110–111.\nCiting Terry as controlling, the Court further held that a\ndriver, once outside the stopped vehicle, may be patted\ndown for weapons if the officer reasonably concludes that\nthe driver “might be armed and presently dangerous.” 434\nU. S., at 112.\n  Wilson held that the Mimms rule applied to passengers\nas well as to drivers. Specifically, the Court instructed\nthat “an officer making a traffic stop may order passengers\nto get out of the car pending completion of the stop.” 519\nU. S., at 415. “[T]he same weighty interest in officer\nsafety,” the Court observed, “is present regardless of\nwhether the occupant of the stopped car is a driver or\npassenger.” Id., at 413.\n  It is true, the Court acknowledged, that in a lawful\ntraffic stop, “[t]here is probable cause to believe that the\ndriver has committed a minor vehicular offense,” but\n“there is no such reason to stop or detain the passengers.”\nIbid. On the other hand, the Court emphasized, the risk\nof a violent encounter in a traffic-stop setting “stems not\nfrom the ordinary reaction of a motorist stopped for a\nspeeding violation, but from the fact that evidence of a\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmore serious crime might be uncovered during the stop.”\nId., at 414. “[T]he motivation of a passenger to employ\nviolence to prevent apprehension of such a crime,” the\nCourt stated, “is every bit as great as that of the driver.”\nIbid. Moreover, the Court noted, “as a practical matter,\nthe passengers are already stopped by virtue of the stop of\nthe vehicle,” id., at 413–414, so “the additional intrusion\non the passenger is minimal,” id., at 415.\n  Completing the picture, Brendlin held that a passenger\nis seized, just as the driver is, “from the moment [a car\nstopped by the police comes] to a halt on the side of the\nroad.” 551 U. S., at 263. A passenger therefore has stand\ning to challenge a stop’s constitutionality. Id., at 256–259.\n  After Wilson, but before Brendlin, the Court had stated,\nin dictum, that officers who conduct “routine traffic\nstop[s]” may “perform a ‘patdown’ of a driver and any\npassengers upon reasonable suspicion that they may be\narmed and dangerous.” Knowles v. Iowa, 525 U. S. 113,\n117–118 (1998). That forecast, we now confirm, accurately\ncaptures the combined thrust of the Court’s decisions in\nMimms, Wilson, and Brendlin.\n                              B\n  The Arizona Court of Appeals recognized that, initially,\nJohnson was lawfully detained incident to the legitimate\nstop of the vehicle in which he was a passenger. See 217\nAriz., at 64, 170 P. 3d, at 673. But, that court concluded,\nonce Officer Trevizo undertook to question Johnson on a\nmatter unrelated to the traffic stop, i.e., Johnson’s gang\naffiliation, patdown authority ceased to exist, absent\nreasonable suspicion that Johnson had engaged, or was\nabout to engage, in criminal activity. See id., at 65, 170\nP. 3d, at 674. In support of the Arizona court’s portrayal\nof Trevizo’s interrogation of Johnson as “consensual,”\nJohnson emphasizes Trevizo’s testimony at the suppres\nsion hearing. Responding to the prosecutor’s questions,\n8                      ARIZONA v. JOHNSON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nTrevizo affirmed her belief that Johnson could have “re\nfused to get out of the car” and “to turn around for the pat\ndown.” App. 41.\n   It is not clear why the prosecutor, in opposing the sup\npression motion, sought to portray the episode as consen\nsual. Cf. Florida v. Bostick, 501 U. S. 429 (1991) (holding\nthat police officers’ search of a bus passenger’s luggage can\nbe based on consent). In any event, Trevizo also testified\nthat she never advised Johnson he did not have to answer\nher questions or otherwise cooperate with her. See App.\n45. And during cross-examination, Trevizo did not dis\nagree when defense counsel asked “in fact you weren’t\nseeking [Johnson’s] permission . . . ?” Id., at 36. As the\ndissenting judge observed, “consensual” is an “unrealistic”\ncharacterization of the Trevizo-Johnson interaction.\n“[T]he encounter . . . took place within minutes of the\nstop”; the patdown followed “within mere moments” of\nJohnson’s exit from the vehicle; beyond genuine debate,\nthe point at which Johnson could have felt free to leave\nhad not yet occurred. See 217 Ariz., at 66, 170 P. 3d, at\n675.1\n   A lawful roadside stop begins when a vehicle is pulled\nover for investigation of a traffic violation. The temporary\nseizure of driver and passengers ordinarily continues, and\nremains reasonable, for the duration of the stop. Nor\nmally, the stop ends when the police have no further need\nto control the scene, and inform the driver and passengers\nthey are free to leave. See Brendlin, 551 U. S., at 258.

Nothing oc\ncurred in this case that would have conveyed to Johnson\nthat, prior to the frisk, the traffic stop had ended or that\nhe was otherwise free “to depart without police permis\nsion.” Ibid.

JOHNSON\n\n      CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF ARIZONA\n\n No. 07–1122. Argued December 9, 2008—Decided January 26, 2009\nIn Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, this Court held that a “stop and frisk”\n  may be conducted without violating the Fourth Amendment’s ban on\n  unreasonable searches and seizures if two conditions are met. First,\n  the investigatory stop (temporary detention) must be lawful, a re\n  quirement met in an on-the-street encounter when a police officer\n  reasonably suspects that the person apprehended is committing or\n  has committed a crime. Second, to proceed from a stop to a frisk\n  (patdown for weapons), the officer must reasonably suspect that the\n  person stopped is armed and dangerous. For the duration of a traffic\n  stop, the Court recently confirmed, a police officer effectively seizes\n  “everyone in the vehicle,” the driver and all passengers. Brendlin v.\n  California, 551 U. S. 249, 255.\n     While patrolling near a Tucson neighborhood associated with the\n  Crips gang, police officers serving on Arizona’s gang task force\n  stopped an automobile for a vehicular infraction warranting a cita\n  tion. At the time of the stop, the officers had no reason to suspect the\n  car’s occupants of criminal activity. Officer Trevizo attended to re\n  spondent Johnson, the back-seat passenger, whose behavior and\n  clothing caused Trevizo to question him. After learning that Johnson\n  was from a town with a Crips gang and had been in prison, Trevizo\n  asked him get out of the car in order to question him further, out of\n  the hearing of the front-seat passenger, about his gang affiliation.\n  Because she suspected that he was armed, she patted him down for\n  safety when he exited the car. During the patdown, she felt the butt\n  of a gun. At that point, Johnson began to struggle, and Trevizo hand\n  cuffed him. Johnson was charged with, inter alia, possession of a\n  weapon by a prohibited possessor. The trial court denied his motion\n  to suppress the evidence, concluding that the stop was lawful and\n  that Trevizo had cause to suspect Johnson was armed and dangerous.\n2                        ARIZONA v. JOHNSON\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    Johnson was convicted. The Arizona Court of Appeals reversed.\n    While recognizing that Johnson was lawfully seized, the court found\n    that, prior to the frisk, the detention had evolved into a consensual\n    conversation about his gang affiliation. Trevizo, the court therefore\n    concluded, had no right to pat Johnson down even if she had reason\n    to suspect he was armed and dangerous. The Arizona Supreme\n    Court denied review.\nHeld: Officer Trevizo’s patdown of Johnson did not violate the Fourth\n Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures.\n Pp. 5–9.\n    (a) Terry established that, in an investigatory stop based on rea\n sonably grounded suspicion of criminal activity, the police must be\n positioned to act instantly if they have reasonable cause to suspect\n that the persons temporarily detained are armed and dangerous. 392\n U. S., at 24. Because a limited search of outer clothing for weapons\n serves to protect both the officer and the public, a patdown is consti\n tutional. Id., at 23–24, 27, 30–31. Traffic stops, which “resemble, in\n duration and atmosphere, the kind of brief detention authorized in\n Terry,” Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 439, n. 29, are “especially\n fraught with danger to police officers,” Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S.\n 1032, 1047, who may minimize the risk of harm by exercising “ ‘un\n questioned command of the situation,’ ” Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U. S.\n 408, 414. Three decisions cumulatively portray Terry’s application in\n a traffic-stop setting. In Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U. S. 106 (per\n curiam), the Court held that “once a motor vehicle has been lawfully\n detained for a traffic violation, the police officers may order the driver\n to get out of the vehicle without violating the Fourth Amendment,”\n id., at 111, n. 6, because the government’s “legitimate and weighty”\n interest in officer safety outweighs the “de minimis” additional intru\n sion of requiring a driver, already lawfully stopped, to exit the vehi\n cle, id., at 110–111. Citing Terry, the Court further held that a\n driver, once outside the stopped vehicle, may be patted down for\n weapons if the officer reasonably concludes that the driver might be\n armed and dangerous. 434 U. S., at 112. Wilson, 519 U. S., at 413,\n held that the Mimms rule applies to passengers as well as drivers,\n based on “the same weighty interest in officer safety.” Brendlin, 551\n U. S., at 263, held that a passenger is seized, just as the driver is,\n “from the moment [a car stopped by the police comes] to a halt on the\n side of the road.” A passenger’s motivation to use violence during the\n stop to prevent apprehension for a crime more grave than a traffic\n violation is just as great as that of the driver. 519 U. S., at 414. And\n as “the passengers are already stopped by virtue of the stop of the\n vehicle,” id., at 413–414, “the additional intrusion on the passenger is\n minimal,” id., at 415.

But Trevizo also testified\n  that she never advised Johnson he did not have to answer her ques\n  tions or otherwise cooperate with her. A lawful roadside stop begins\n  when a vehicle is pulled over for investigation of a traffic violation.\n  The temporary seizure of driver and passengers ordinarily continues,\n  and remains reasonable, for the duration of the stop. Normally, the\n  stop ends when the police have no further need to control the scene,\n  and inform the driver and passengers they are free to leave. An offi\n  cer’s inquiries into matters unrelated to the justification for the traf\n  fic stop do not convert the encounter into something other than a law\n  ful seizure, so long as the inquiries do not measurably extend the\n  stop’s duration. See Muehler v. Mena, 544 U. S. 93, 100–101. A rea\n  sonable passenger would understand that during the time a car is\n  lawfully stopped, he or she is not free to terminate the encounter\n  with the police and move about at will. Nothing occurred in this case\n  that would have conveyed to Johnson that, prior to the frisk, the traf\n  fic stop had ended or that he was otherwise free “to depart without\n  police permission.” Brendlin, 551 U. S., at 257.

In a\npathmarking decision, Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968),\nthe Court considered whether an investigatory stop (tem\nporary detention) and frisk (patdown for weapons) may be\nconducted without violating the Fourth Amendment’s ban\non unreasonable searches and seizures. The Court upheld\n“stop and frisk” as constitutionally permissible if two\nconditions are met. First, the investigatory stop must be\nlawful. That requirement is met in an on-the-street en\ncounter, Terry determined, when the police officer rea\nsonably suspects that the person apprehended is commit\nting or has committed a criminal offense. Second, to\nproceed from a stop to a frisk, the police officer must rea\nsonably suspect that the person stopped is armed and\ndangerous.\n  For the duration of a traffic stop, we recently confirmed,\na police officer effectively seizes “everyone in the vehicle,”\nthe driver and all passengers. Brendlin v. California, 551\n2                  ARIZONA v. JOHNSON\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. 249, 255 (2007). Accordingly, we hold that, in a\ntraffic-stop setting, the first Terry condition—a lawful\ninvestigatory stop—is met whenever it is lawful for police\nto detain an automobile and its occupants pending inquiry\ninto a vehicular violation. The police need not have, in\naddition, cause to believe any occupant of the vehicle is\ninvolved in criminal activity. To justify a patdown of the\ndriver or a passenger during a traffic stop, however, just\nas in the case of a pedestrian reasonably suspected of\ncriminal activity, the police must harbor reasonable suspi\ncion that the person subjected to the frisk is armed and\ndangerous.\n                              I\n   On April 19, 2002, Officer Maria Trevizo and Detectives\nMachado and Gittings, all members of Arizona’s gang task\nforce, were on patrol in Tucson near a neighborhood asso\nciated with the Crips gang. At approximately 9 p.m., the\nofficers pulled over an automobile after a license plate\ncheck revealed that the vehicle’s registration had been\nsuspended for an insurance-related violation. Under\nArizona law, the violation for which the vehicle was\nstopped constituted a civil infraction warranting a cita\ntion. At the time of the stop, the vehicle had three occu\npants—the driver, a front-seat passenger, and a passenger\nin the back seat, Lemon Montrea Johnson, the respondent\nhere. In making the stop the officers had no reason to\nsuspect anyone in the vehicle of criminal activity. See\nApp. 29–30.\n   The three officers left their patrol car and approached\nthe stopped vehicle. Machado instructed all of the occu\npants to keep their hands visible. Id., at 14. He asked\nwhether there were any weapons in the vehicle; all re\nsponded no. Id., at 15. Machado then directed the driver\nto get out of the car. Gittings dealt with the front-seat\npassenger, who stayed in the vehicle throughout the stop.\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSee id., at 31. While Machado was getting the driver’s\nlicense and information about the vehicle’s registra\ntion and insurance, see id., at 42–43, Trevizo attended to\nJohnson.\n   Trevizo noticed that, as the police approached, Johnson\nlooked back and kept his eyes on the officers. Id., at 12.\nWhen she drew near, she observed that Johnson was\nwearing clothing, including a blue bandana, that she\nconsidered consistent with Crips membership. Id., at 17.\nShe also noticed a scanner in Johnson’s jacket pocket,\nwhich “struck [her] as highly unusual and cause [for]\nconcern,” because “most people” would not carry around a\nscanner that way “unless they’re going to be involved in\nsome kind of criminal activity or [are] going to try to evade\nthe police by listening to the scanner.” Id., at 16. In\nresponse to Trevizo’s questions, Johnson provided his\nname and date of birth but said he had no identification\nwith him. He volunteered that he was from Eloy, Arizona,\na place Trevizo knew was home to a Crips gang. Johnson\nfurther told Trevizo that he had served time in prison for\nburglary and had been out for about a year. 217 Ariz. 58,\n60, 170 P. 3d 667, 669 (App. 2007).\n   Trevizo wanted to question Johnson away from the\nfront-seat passenger to gain “intelligence about the gang\n[Johnson] might be in.” App. 19. For that reason, she\nasked him to get out of the car. Ibid. Johnson complied.\nBased on Trevizo’s observations and Johnson’s answers to\nher questions while he was still seated in the car, Trevizo\nsuspected that “he might have a weapon on him.” Id., at\n20. When he exited the vehicle, she therefore “patted him\ndown for officer safety.” Ibid. During the patdown, Tre\nvizo felt the butt of a gun near Johnson’s waist. 217 Ariz.,\nat 60, 170 P. 3d, at 669. At that point Johnson began to\nstruggle, and Trevizo placed him in handcuffs. Ibid.\n   Johnson was charged in state court with, inter alia,\npossession of a weapon by a prohibited possessor. He\n4                   ARIZONA v. JOHNSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmoved to suppress the evidence as the fruit of an unlawful\nsearch. The trial court denied the motion, concluding that\nthe stop was lawful and that Trevizo had cause to suspect\nJohnson was armed and dangerous. See App. 74–78. A\njury convicted Johnson of the gun-possession charge. See\n217 Ariz., at 60–61, 170 P. 3d, at 669–670.\n   A divided panel of the Arizona Court of Appeals re\nversed Johnson’s conviction. Id., at 59, 170 P. 3d, at 668.\nRecognizing that “Johnson was [lawfully] seized when the\nofficers stopped the car,” id., at 62, 170 P. 3d, at 671, the\ncourt nevertheless concluded that prior to the frisk the\ndetention had “evolved into a separate, consensual en\ncounter stemming from an unrelated investigation by\nTrevizo of Johnson’s possible gang affiliation,” id., at 64,\n170 P. 3d, at 673. Absent “reason to believe Johnson was\ninvolved in criminal activity,” the Arizona appeals court\nheld, Trevizo “had no right to pat him down for weapons,\neven if she had reason to suspect he was armed and dan\ngerous.” Ibid.\n   Judge Espinosa dissented. He found it “highly unrealis\ntic to conclude that merely because [Trevizo] was courte\nous and Johnson cooperative, the ongoing and virtually\nsimultaneous chain of events [had] somehow ‘evolved into\na consensual encounter’ in the few short moments in\nvolved.” Id., at 66, 170 P. 3d, at 675. Throughout the\nepisode, he stressed, Johnson remained “seized as part of\n[a] valid traffic stop.” Ibid. Further, he maintained,\nTrevizo “had a reasonable basis to consider [Johnson]\ndangerous,” id., at 67, 170 P. 3d, at 676, and could there\nfore ensure her own safety and that of others at the scene\nby patting down Johnson for weapons.\n   The Arizona Supreme Court denied review.

Ohio, 392 U. S. 1\n(1968). Terry involved a stop for interrogation of men\nwhose conduct had attracted the attention of a patrolling\npolice officer. The officer’s observation led him reasonably\nto suspect that the men were casing a jewelry shop in\npreparation for a robbery. He conducted a patdown, which\ndisclosed weapons concealed in the men’s overcoat pockets.\nThis Court upheld the lower courts’ determinations that\nthe interrogation was warranted and the patdown, per\nmissible. See id., at 8.\n   Terry established the legitimacy of an investigatory stop\n“in situations where [the police] may lack probable cause\nfor an arrest.” Id., at 24. When the stop is justified by\nsuspicion (reasonably grounded, but short of probable\ncause) that criminal activity is afoot, the Court explained,\nthe police officer must be positioned to act instantly on\nreasonable suspicion that the persons temporarily de\ntained are armed and dangerous. Ibid. Recognizing that\na limited search of outer clothing for weapons serves to\nprotect both the officer and the public, the Court held the\npatdown reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. Id., at\n23–24, 27, 30–31.\n   “[M]ost traffic stops,” this Court has observed, “resem\nble, in duration and atmosphere, the kind of brief deten\ntion authorized in Terry.” Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S.\n420, 439, n. 29 (1984). Furthermore, the Court has recog\nnized that traffic stops are “especially fraught with danger\nto police officers.” Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1047\n(1983). “ ‘The risk of harm to both the police and the occu\npants [of a stopped vehicle] is minimized,’ ” we have\nstressed, “ ‘if the officers routinely exercise unquestioned\ncommand of the situation.’ ” Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U. S.\n6                   ARIZONA v. JOHNSON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n408, 414 (1997) (quoting Michigan v. Summers, 452 U. S.\n692, 702–703 (1981)); see Brendlin, 551 U. S., at 258.\nThree decisions cumulatively portray Terry’s application\nin a traffic-stop setting: Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U. S.\n106 (1977) (per curiam); Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U. S. 408\n(1997); and Brendlin v. California, 551 U. S. 249 (2007).\n  In Mimms, the Court held that “once a motor vehicle\nhas been lawfully detained for a traffic violation, the police\nofficers may order the driver to get out of the vehicle\nwithout violating the Fourth Amendment’s proscription of\nunreasonable searches and seizures.” 434 U. S., at 111,\nn. 6. The government’s “legitimate and weighty” interest\nin officer safety, the Court said, outweighs the “de mini\nmis” additional intrusion of requiring a driver, already\nlawfully stopped, to exit the vehicle. Id., at 110–111.\nCiting Terry as controlling, the Court further held that a\ndriver, once outside the stopped vehicle, may be patted\ndown for weapons if the officer reasonably concludes that\nthe driver “might be armed and presently dangerous.” 434\nU. S., at 112.\n  Wilson held that the Mimms rule applied to passengers\nas well as to drivers. Specifically, the Court instructed\nthat “an officer making a traffic stop may order passengers\nto get out of the car pending completion of the stop.” 519\nU. S., at 415. “[T]he same weighty interest in officer\nsafety,” the Court observed, “is present regardless of\nwhether the occupant of the stopped car is a driver or\npassenger.” Id., at 413.\n  It is true, the Court acknowledged, that in a lawful\ntraffic stop, “[t]here is probable cause to believe that the\ndriver has committed a minor vehicular offense,” but\n“there is no such reason to stop or detain the passengers.”\nIbid. On the other hand, the Court emphasized, the risk\nof a violent encounter in a traffic-stop setting “stems not\nfrom the ordinary reaction of a motorist stopped for a\nspeeding violation, but from the fact that evidence of a\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmore serious crime might be uncovered during the stop.”\nId., at 414. “[T]he motivation of a passenger to employ\nviolence to prevent apprehension of such a crime,” the\nCourt stated, “is every bit as great as that of the driver.”\nIbid. Moreover, the Court noted, “as a practical matter,\nthe passengers are already stopped by virtue of the stop of\nthe vehicle,” id., at 413–414, so “the additional intrusion\non the passenger is minimal,” id., at 415.\n  Completing the picture, Brendlin held that a passenger\nis seized, just as the driver is, “from the moment [a car\nstopped by the police comes] to a halt on the side of the\nroad.” 551 U. S., at 263. A passenger therefore has stand\ning to challenge a stop’s constitutionality. Id., at 256–259.\n  After Wilson, but before Brendlin, the Court had stated,\nin dictum, that officers who conduct “routine traffic\nstop[s]” may “perform a ‘patdown’ of a driver and any\npassengers upon reasonable suspicion that they may be\narmed and dangerous.” Knowles v. Iowa, 525 U. S. 113,\n117–118 (1998). That forecast, we now confirm, accurately\ncaptures the combined thrust of the Court’s decisions in\nMimms, Wilson, and Brendlin.\n                              B\n  The Arizona Court of Appeals recognized that, initially,\nJohnson was lawfully detained incident to the legitimate\nstop of the vehicle in which he was a passenger. See 217\nAriz., at 64, 170 P. 3d, at 673. But, that court concluded,\nonce Officer Trevizo undertook to question Johnson on a\nmatter unrelated to the traffic stop, i.e., Johnson’s gang\naffiliation, patdown authority ceased to exist, absent\nreasonable suspicion that Johnson had engaged, or was\nabout to engage, in criminal activity. See id., at 65, 170\nP. 3d, at 674. In support of the Arizona court’s portrayal\nof Trevizo’s interrogation of Johnson as “consensual,”\nJohnson emphasizes Trevizo’s testimony at the suppres\nsion hearing. Responding to the prosecutor’s questions,\n8                      ARIZONA v. JOHNSON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nTrevizo affirmed her belief that Johnson could have “re\nfused to get out of the car” and “to turn around for the pat\ndown.” App. 41.\n   It is not clear why the prosecutor, in opposing the sup\npression motion, sought to portray the episode as consen\nsual. Cf. Florida v. Bostick, 501 U. S. 429 (1991) (holding\nthat police officers’ search of a bus passenger’s luggage can\nbe based on consent). In any event, Trevizo also testified\nthat she never advised Johnson he did not have to answer\nher questions or otherwise cooperate with her. See App.\n45. And during cross-examination, Trevizo did not dis\nagree when defense counsel asked “in fact you weren’t\nseeking [Johnson’s] permission . . . ?” Id., at 36. As the\ndissenting judge observed, “consensual” is an “unrealistic”\ncharacterization of the Trevizo-Johnson interaction.\n“[T]he encounter . . . took place within minutes of the\nstop”; the patdown followed “within mere moments” of\nJohnson’s exit from the vehicle; beyond genuine debate,\nthe point at which Johnson could have felt free to leave\nhad not yet occurred. See 217 Ariz., at 66, 170 P. 3d, at\n675.1\n   A lawful roadside stop begins when a vehicle is pulled\nover for investigation of a traffic violation. The temporary\nseizure of driver and passengers ordinarily continues, and\nremains reasonable, for the duration of the stop. Nor\nmally, the stop ends when the police have no further need\nto control the scene, and inform the driver and passengers\nthey are free to leave. See Brendlin, 551 U. S., at 258. An\nofficer’s inquiries into matters unrelated to the justifica\ntion for the traffic stop, this Court has made plain, do not\n——————\n  1 The Court of Appeals majority did not assert that Johnson reasona\n\nbly could have felt free to leave. Instead, the court said “a reasonable\nperson in Johnson’s position would have felt free to remain in the\nvehicle.” 217 Ariz. 58, 64, 170 P. 3d 667, 673 (2007). That position,\nhowever, appears at odds with our decision in Maryland v. Wilson, 519\nU. S. 408 (1997). See supra, at 6–7.\n                   Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                  9\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nconvert the encounter into something other than a lawful\nseizure, so long as those inquiries do not measurably\nextend the duration of the stop. See Muehler v. Mena, 544\nU. S. 93, 100–101 (2005).\n  In sum, as stated in Brendlin, a traffic stop of a car\ncommunicates to a reasonable passenger that he or she is\nnot free to terminate the encounter with the police and\nmove about at will. See 551 U. S., at 257. Nothing oc\ncurred in this case that would have conveyed to Johnson\nthat, prior to the frisk, the traffic stop had ended or that\nhe was otherwise free “to depart without police permis\nsion.” Ibid. Officer Trevizo surely was not constitution\nally required to give Johnson an opportunity to depart the\nscene after he exited the vehicle without first ensuring\nthat, in so doing, she was not permitting a dangerous\nperson to get behind her.2\n                       *     *    *\n  For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Arizona\nCourt of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for\nfurther proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                    It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n 2 The  Arizona Court of Appeals assumed, “without deciding, that\nTrevizo had reasonable suspicion that Johnson was armed and danger\nous.” 217 Ariz., at 64, 170 P. 3d, at 673.
