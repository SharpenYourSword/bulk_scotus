Argued November 4, 2008 —Decided January 26, 2009*\nNuclear utilities generally procure their fuel, “low enriched uranium”\n (LEU), through one of two types of contracts. Under an “enriched\n uranium product” (EUP) contract, the utility simply pays the en\n richer cash for LEU of a desired quantity and “assay,” i.e., its per\n centage of the isotope necessary for a nuclear reaction. The amount\n of energy required to enrich a quantity of “feed uranium” to a given\n assay is described in terms of an industry standard called a “separa\n tive work unit” (SWU). Under a “SWU contract,” the utility provides\n a quantity of feed uranium and pays the enricher for the SWUs to\n produce the required LEU quantity and assay. SWU contracts do not\n require that the required number of SWUs actually be applied to the\n utility’s uranium. Because feed uranium is fungible and essentially\n trades like a commodity, and because profitable operation of an en\n richment plant requires the constant processing of feed uranium from\n the enricher’s undifferentiated stock, the LEU provided to a utility\n under a SWU contract cannot be traced to the particular unenriched\n uranium the utility provided.\n    Petitioners (collectively, USEC), who run the only uranium en\n richment factory in the United States, petitioned the Commerce De\n partment (Department) for relief under the Tariff Act of 1930, which\n calls for “antidumping” duties on “foreign merchandise” sold in this\n country at “less than its fair value,” 19 U. S. C. §1673, but does not\n touch international sales of services. USEC alleged that LEU im\n ported from European countries under both EUP and SWU contracts\n was being sold in the United States at less than fair value and was\n——————\n  * Together with No. 07–1078, USEC Inc. et al. v.

A.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    materially harming domestic industry. In its final determination, the\n    Department concluded that LEU from France, including LEU ac\n    quired under SWU contracts, was being sold here at less than fair\n    value. Among other things, the Department rejected the claim that\n    such transactions were sales of enrichment services, as provided in\n    SWU contracts. The Court of International Trade (CIT) ultimately\n    reversed, noting the “legal fiction” expressed in SWU contracts that\n    the very feed uranium delivered by a utility to an enricher is enriched\n    and then returned as LEU to the utility. Finding that the record did\n    not support a determination that the enricher has any ownership\n    rights, the CIT reasoned that the Department’s decision was unsup\n    ported by substantial evidence and not in accordance with law. The\n    Federal Circuit affirmed, approaching the issues much as the CIT\n    had.\nHeld: The Department’s take on the transactions at issue as sales of\n goods rather than services reflects a permissible interpretation and\n application of §1673. Because §1677(1) gives this determination to\n the Department in the first instance, the Department’s interpretation\n governs in the absence of unambiguous statutory language to the\n contrary or an unreasonable resolution of ambiguous language. See,\n e.g., Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n 467 U. S. 837. Two threshold propositions must be accepted. First,\n the Department reasonably concluded that §1673 is not limited by its\n terms to cash-only sales. If that were the case, any sale of a manu\n factured product could be exempted from the section’s operation by a\n contractual term stating part of the purchase price in terms of a\n commodity. Second, since public law is not constrained by private\n fiction, see, e.g., Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U. S. 332, 336, the De\n partment is not bound by the legal fiction created by SWU contracts\n that the very feed uranium delivered by a utility to an enricher is en\n riched and then returned as LEU to the utility. Thus, the test of the\n Department’s position turns first on whether the statute clearly ex\n cludes a transaction involving mixed payment for LEU that may and\n almost certainly will be produced from uranium feed distinct from\n what the utility provides. Although it is undisputed that §1673 ap\n plies to the sale of goods, not services, the section simply does not\n speak with the precision necessary to say definitively whether it ap\n plies to the LEU and the agreement giving the utility a right to get it.\n This is the very situation in which the Court looks to an authoritative\n agency for a decision about a statute’s scope. Once the choice is\n made, the Court asks only whether the Department’s application of\n the statute was reasonable. Where, as here, cash plus an untracked\n fungible commodity are exchanged for a substantially transformed\n version of the same commodity, the Department may reasonably\n                    Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  treat the transaction as the sale of a good under §1673. Cf. Powder\n  Co. v. Burkhardt, 97 U. S. 110, 116. The Department’s position is re\n  inforced by practical reasons aimed at preserving antidumping du\n  ties’ effectiveness. It is undisputed that such duties apply to LEU\n  sold to a domestic utility by foreign enrichers under an EUP contract\n  calling for a single cash price that is less than fair value. Such a\n  transaction obviously opens the domestic enrichment industry to ma\n  terial injury, the very threat that §1673 was meant to counter. But\n  the same injury will occur if a SWU contract is untouchable. Under a\n  SWU contract, the domestic utility pays cash to a third party for un\n  enriched uranium and provides this along with additional cash in ex\n  change for LEU; any EUP contract could be structured as a SWU\n  contract simply by splitting the transaction in two, one contract to\n  buy unenriched uranium and another to enrich it. And the restruc\n  turing would not stop with uranium; contracts for many types of\n  goods would be replaced by separate contracts for the goods and for\n  processing services, and antidumping duties would primarily chastise\n  the uncreative. The Department’s attempt to foreclose this absurd\n  result by treating such transactions as sales of goods is eminently\n  reasonable.

S. C. §1673, but\ndoes not touch international sales of services. These cases\ntest the application of this antidumping provision to im­\nports of low enriched uranium (LEU), a highly processed\nderivative of natural uranium used as nuclear fuel, when\ndomestic utilities contract to obtain LEU for cash plus\nunenriched uranium delivered to a foreign enricher.\nAlthough the parties’ contracts call these transactions\nsales of uranium enrichment services, the Commerce\nDepartment treats them as sales of “foreign merchandise”\nsubject to the antidumping provision.          The issue is\nwhether the Commerce Department’s way of seeing the\ntransactions as sales of goods rather than services reflects\n2               UNITED STATES v. EURODIF S. A.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\na permissible interpretation and application of §1673. We\nhold that it does.\n                                I\n  There are five steps in transforming elemental uranium\ninto fuel rods for nuclear powerplants. After uranium ore\nis mined, it is milled into uranium concentrate called\n“yellowcake,” which is next converted into uranium\nhexafluoride gas or “feed uranium.” The fissionable iso­\ntope in unenriched feed uranium is then concentrated,\nproducing LEU in pellet form, which is in turn made into\nuranium fuel rods. These cases are about the fourth step:\nenriching uranium feedstock into LEU.\n  The uranium isotope needed for a nuclear reaction, U­\n235, amounts only to .711 percent by weight of natural\nuranium. Uranium whose concentration or “assay,” of U­\n235 has been enhanced to 20 percent or more is weapons­\ngrade, highly enriched uranium (HEU), whereas LEU has\na U-235 assay of 3 to 5 percent, making it useful as nu­\nclear fuel. One way to produce LEU, and the method at\nissue in these cases, is gaseous diffusion,1 whereby gase­\nous feed uranium is pushed through a long series of filters,\nseparating the gas into two streams. The stream passing\nthrough the filters (the “product stream”) gains a higher\nconcentration of the lighter U-235 isotope than the stream\nthat is filtered out (the “tails”). Because the concentration\nreached at each individual filter is minor, the gas must be\nforced through hundreds or even thousands of filters, at\ngreat expenditure of electricity, before the product stream\nreaches the desired assay. The amount of energy required\nto enrich a quantity of feed uranium to a given assay is\nmeasured in terms of an industry standard called a “sepa­\nrative work unit” or SWU (pronounced “swoo”). In prac­\n\n——————\n  1 LEU can also be produced through a centrifuge method or by back­\n\nblending unenriched uranium with weapons-grade uranium.\n                    Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                  3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ntice, however, a given degree of enrichment will depend on\nadjusting the quantities of two separate variables, feed\nuranium and electricity, in inverse proportions. Thus, if\nthe electric rate is stable but the value of feed uranium\nfalls, an enricher may produce LEU by “overfeeding,”\nsubjecting a greater quantity of feed uranium to fewer\nSWUs, and when the value of feed uranium goes up and\nelectricity does not, “underfeeding” can use more SWUs to\nsqueeze extra U-235 from the tails.\n   Nuclear utilities generally get LEU in one of two ways.\nUnder an “enriched uranium product” or “EUP” contract, a\nutility simply buys a desired quantity and assay of LEU\nfor cash. Under a “SWU contract,” the utility provides a\nquantity of feed uranium and pays the enricher for the\nSWUs to produce the quantity and assay of LEU called\nfor.2 Despite their name, SWU contracts do not require\nthat the contractual number of SWUs actually be applied\nto the quantity of uranium provided, Notice of Final De­\ntermination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Low En­\nriched Uranium From France, 66 Fed. Reg. 65877, 65884\n(2001) (hereinafter LEU from France); rather, the enricher\nremains free to overfeed or underfeed so long as it delivers\nthe specified LEU. Moreover, because feed uranium is\nfungible, and “for all intents and purposes, trades like a\ncommodity,” ibid., and because profitable operation of an\nenrichment plant requires the constant processing of feed\nuranium from the enricher’s undifferentiated stock, the\nLEU provided to a utility under a SWU contract cannot be\ntraced to the particular unenriched uranium the utility\nprovided.\n   Petitioners, USEC Inc. and its subsidiary, United States\nEnrichment Corporation, (USEC collectively) run the only\n——————\n  2 Many SWU contracts give the utility the option of providing a com­\n\nparable quantity of uranium concentrate in lieu of the specified feed\nuranium.

Reg. 65882–65883.\n  In its final determination, the Commerce Department\nconcluded that LEU from France, including LEU acquired\nunder SWU contracts, was being sold, or likely to be sold,\nin the United States at less than fair value.4 Id., at 65878.\n——————\n 4 The   Commerce Department concluded in a separate determination\n6                 UNITED STATES v. EURODIF S. A.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nIn deciding that SWU contracts are for a sale of LEU, not\nenrichment services, the Department stressed several\nfeatures of the transactions. First, because the enrich­\nment process accounts for approximately 60 percent of the\nvalue of LEU and works a “substantial transformation” on\nuranium feedstock, id., at 65881, enrichment creates “the\nessential character” of LEU, id., at 65884. Second, “en­\nrichers not only have complete control over the enrichment\nprocess, but in fact control the level of usage of the natural\nuranium provided.” Ibid. Third, the utilities themselves\ntake no part in the manufacture of LEU and are the sole\npurchasers of the product. Ibid.\n   The Commerce Department also rejected the argument\nthat LEU transferred pursuant to SWU contracts should\nnot be considered “sold” in light of a “tolling” regulation\nthen (but no longer) in effect. Ibid. The regulation stated\nthat a “toller,” a subcontractor who sells processing ser­\nvices in, or material for incorporation into, subject mer­\nchandise, would not be considered a manufacturer or\nproducer “where the toller or subcontractor does not ac­\nquire ownership, and does not control the relevant sale, of\nthe subject merchandise.” 19 CFR §351.401(h) (2000)\n(withdrawn in Import Administration, Withdrawal of\nRegulations Governing the Treatment of Subcontractors,\n(“Tolling” Operations), 73 Fed. Reg. 16517 (2008) (herein­\nafter Tolling Operations)). This regulation, the Commerce\nDepartment explained, was intended to apply in situations\nwhere a good is first sold by a manufacturer and then\nresold by an exporter or reseller.

Eurodif I, supra, at 1363, and n. 3\n(quoting Florida Power & Light Co., supra, at 1373).\nWhile the court conceded that SWU agreements “do ‘not\nfall neatly’ either into the category of contracts for services\nor the category of contracts for the sale of goods,” 411\nF. 3d, at 1364 (quoting Florida Power & Light Co., supra,\nat 1373–1374), it still concluded that “even under the\ndeferential standard of review that we apply in this case,\nwe choose not to ignore our previous holdings.” Eurodif I,\nsupra, at 1363.\n  Shortly after this decision, we held in National Cable &\nTelecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services,\n545 U. S. 967, 982–983 (2005), that a court’s choice of one\nreasonable reading of an ambiguous statute does not\npreclude an implementing agency from later adopting a\ndifferent reasonable interpretation. On rehearing, the\nFederal Circuit responded to National Cable & Telecom\nmunications Association by explaining that it had not\nrejected the Commerce Department’s position because it\nconflicted with the prior interpretive choice that carried\nthe day in Florida Power & Light. Eurodif S. A. v. United\nStates, 423 F. 3d 1275, 1277–1278 (2005) (Eurodif II). The\nCircuit, rather, saw no statutory uncertainty to be re­\nsolved: “the antidumping duty statute unambiguously\napplies to the sale of goods and not services” and “it is\nclear that [SWU] contracts are contracts for services and\nnot goods.” Id., at 1278. After final judgment was en­\ntered, Eurodif S. A. v. United States, 506 F. 3d 1051, 1053\n(CA Fed. 2007) (Eurodif III), we granted certiorari 553\nU.

We now reverse.\n                            II\n  The issue is not whether, for purposes of 19 U. S. C.\n§1673, the better view is that a SWU contract is one for\n10               UNITED STATES v. EURODIF S. A.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe sale of services, not goods. The statute gives this\ndetermination to the Department of Commerce in the first\ninstance, §1677(1), and when the Department exercises\nthis authority in the course of adjudication, its interpreta­\ntion governs in the absence of unambiguous statutory\nlanguage to the contrary or unreasonable resolution of\nlanguage that is ambiguous.6 United States v. Mead\nCorp., 533 U. S. 218, 229–230 (2001) (citing Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U. S. 837 (1984)). This is so even after a change in\nregulatory treatment, which “is not a basis for declining to\nanalyze the agency’s interpretation under the Chevron\nframework.” National Cable & Telecommunications Assn.,\n545 U. S., at 981. “ ‘[T]he whole point of Chevron is to\nleave the discretion provided by the ambiguities of a stat­\nute with the implementing agency.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Smiley\nv.

United States, 307 F. 3d 1364 (CA Fed.\n2002), was inconsistent with the Government’s position here, it would\nnot speak to the deference owed the Commerce Department under\nChevron.\n                    Cite as: 555 U.

First, we think the Department reasonably\nconcluded that §1673 is not limited by its terms to cash­\nonly sales. Otherwise, any sale of a manufactured product\ncould be exempted from the operation of §1673 by a con­\ntractual term stating part of the purchase price in terms of\na commodity.8\n   Second, in applying §1673, the Commerce Department is\nnot bound by the “legal fiction [created by SWU contracts]\nthat the very feed uranium delivered by a utility to an\nenricher is enriched and then returned as LEU to the\nutility.” USEC, 281 F. Supp. 2d, at 1339. The parties are\nfree to contract as they wish, and they may genuinely\nregard SWU agreements as contracts for the sale of en­\nrichment services. But, whatever the significance of such\na term in a contract dispute, cf. Florida Power & Light\nCo., 307 F. 3d 1364, it is well settled that in reading\nregulatory and taxation statutes, “form should be disre­\ngarded for substance and the emphasis should be on eco­\nnomic reality.” Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U. S. 332, 336\n(1967). See also Frank Lyon Co. v. United States, 435\nU.

These\ncalculations, respondents argue, “were a charade, underscoring that the\nantidumping laws cannot be applied to these SWU contracts.” Id., at\n48. To the degree respondents’ argument is that antidumping duties\nmay never be applied to mixed cash-commodity sales, it is doomed by\nimplausibility. If respondents are contending that the Commerce\nDepartment’s dumping determination improperly assessed the normal\nvalue of LEU, they are raising an issue well outside the scope of our\ngrant of certiorari.\n12            UNITED STATES v.

Surrender to private\ncontractual terms is especially uncalled for in dealing with\ninternational tariffs, as Congress saw when it amended\nthe Tariff Act to say that the sale of foreign merchandise\nincludes “the entering into of any leasing arrangement\nregarding the merchandise that is equivalent to the sale of\nthe merchandise.”        Trade and Tariff Act of 1984,\n§602(b)(2), 98 Stat. 3024, 19 U. S C. §1673.\n  Since public law is not constrained by private fiction,\nthe test of the Department’s position turns first on\nwhether the statute clearly excludes a transaction involv­\ning mixed payment for LEU that may and almost certainly\nwill be produced from uranium feed distinct from what the\nutility provides. No one disputes that §1673 applies to the\nsale of goods, not services, LEU From France, 66 Fed. Reg.\n65882–65883. Nor do we think anyone would deny that\nthe exchange of cash combined with a commodity for a\nproduct that uses that very commodity as a constituent\nmaterial is sometimes a sale of services and sometimes a\nsale of goods, the distinction being clear at the extremes.\nA customer who comes to a laundry with cash and dirty\nshirts is clearly purchasing cleaning services, not clean\nshirts. And a customer who provides cash and sand to a\nmanufacturer of generic silicon processors is clearly\nbuying computer chips rather than sand enhancement\nservices.\n  But the line blurs when the facts get more complicated,\nand SWU contracts exemplify a class of transactions that\nthe Federal Circuit recognized does “ ‘not fall neatly’ either\ninto the category of contracts for services or the category of\ncontracts for the sale of goods.” Eurodif I, 411 F. 3d, at\n1364 (quoting Florida Power & Light Co., supra, at 1373–\n1374). The agreement is not like the laundry ticket, which\nsays that the same shirts are supposed to come back, just\nminus the dirt around the collar. And it is not on all fours\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

As to that, the Commerce Department relied on\ntwo related characteristics of these transactions in decid­\ning SWU contracts should be treated as a sale of LEU. It\nstressed that the utility in a SWU contract provides cash\nplus a fungible commodity that is not tracked after its\ndelivery to the enricher, in exchange for a product owned\nby the enricher.9 And it recognized that the enrichment\n——————\n  9 Eurodif  argues that the Commerce Department erred in concluding\nthat enrichers own LEU prior to its delivery under a SWU contract.\nId., at 36–37. While the precise form of this argument is unclear, it\nfails under any reading. Respondents seem to mean that the Com­\nmerce Department’s interpretation of §1673 is impermissible as being\ninconsistent with the formal terms of SWU contracts, an argument we\nrejected above. The argument could also be read to suggest that the\nCommerce Department lacked substantial evidence to conclude that,\ncontractual formalities aside, enrichers in fact own the LEU provided\nunder SWU contracts prior to its delivery. But the evidence in the\nrecord not only supports the Department’s conclusion, it compels it. It\nis undisputed that the LEU delivered under a SWU contract is not\nactually derived from the feed uranium provided as consideration; as\nCIT observed, the notion that the same feed uranium delivered by a\nutility to an enricher is enriched and then returned as LEU to the\nutility is “a legal fiction.” USEC Inc. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"818877\"><a href=\"/opinion/818877/usec-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1334</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1339 (2003). Moreover, the enricher is free to vary the amount of\nfeed uranium used to produce an order of LEU, either stockpiling feed\nuranium or supplementing its stores from other sources. Finally, the\nSWU contracts at issue provide that the utility retains title to the feed\nuranium until delivery of the LEU, at which point it obtains title in the\n14              UNITED STATES v. EURODIF S. A.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nprocess results in a substantial transformation of the\nunenriched uranium.\n  The combination of these characteristics reasonably\ncaptures a common understanding of the sale of a good.\nBecause an individual’s shirts are not fungible, they are\ntracked during the cleaning process and returned to the\nsame customer who brought them in; there are no good\nreasons to treat them as owned for a time by the laundry,\nand no one does. And without any transfer of ownership,\nthe salient feature of the transaction is the cleaning of the\nshirt, a service. Conversely, where a constituent material\nis untracked and fungible, ownership is usually seen as\ntransferred, and the transaction is less likely to be a sale\nof services, as the Court explained years ago in distin­\nguishing a common-law bailment from a sale:\n     “[W]here logs are delivered to be sawed into boards, or\n     leather to be made into shoes, rags into paper, olives\n     into oil, grapes into wine, wheat into flour, if the\n     product of the identical articles delivered is to be re­\n     turned to the original owner in a new form, it is said\n     to be a bailment, and the title never vests in the\n     manufacturer. If, on the other hand, the manufac­\n     turer is not bound to return the same wheat or flour\n     or paper, but may deliver any other of equal value, it\n     is said to be a sale or a loan, and the title to the thing\n     delivered vests in the manufacturer.” Powder Co. v.\n     Burkhardt, 97 U. S. 110, 116 (1878).10\nAnd when the manufacturer is not only free to return\n——————\nLEU. In light of this process, some entity must own the LEU prior to\ndelivery and obtain title to the feed uranium after delivery, absent\nsome modern analog to the abhorrent possibility of an abeyance of\nseizen; the enricher is the only serious candidate.\n   10 Common law definitions do not necessarily control the meaning of\n\nterms in modern trade laws; we merely mean to show the long pedigree\nof the distinction relied upon by the Commerce Department.\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

After\nall, what makes the hypothetical exchange of sand\nfor silicon processors so obviously a sale of goods is the\nextreme transformation brought about by the chip\nmanufacturer.\n   These are good analytical grounds to show that SWU\ntransactions are reasonably placed within the ambit of\nsale of goods, and the Department’s reliance on them is\nreinforced by practical reasons aimed at preserving the\neffectiveness of antidumping duties. There is no dispute\nthat LEU sold under an EUP contract at less than fair\nvalue must be subjected to antidumping duties under\n§1673, there being a clear sale of goods when a domestic\nutility pays a single sale price in cash for the feed uranium\nand enrichment components represented by LEU. If\nforeign enrichers set this price below the fair value of\nLEU, the domestic enrichment industry is obviously open\nto material injury, the very threat the antidumping stat­\nute was meant to counter, see H. R. Rep. No. 1, at 23. But\nthe same injury would occur if a SWU contract were un­\ntouchable. Under a SWU contract, the domestic utility\npays cash to a third party for unenriched uranium and\nprovides this along with additional cash in exchange for\nLEU; any EUP contract could be structured as a SWU\ncontract simply by splitting the transaction in two, one\ncontract to buy unenriched uranium and another to enrich\nit.11 And the restructuring would not stop with uranium;\n——————\n   11 This would be particularly easy in these cases, since COGEMA,\n\nEurodif’s parent company, “is a major world supplier of natural ura­\nnium for the production of LEU.” Final Remand Determination, App. G\nto Pet. for Cert. 221a, n. 38. In fact, many SWU contracts provide that\nif a utility fails to deliver feed uranium, the enricher will substitute\nfeed uranium of its own, which may then be purchased from the en­\n16               UNITED STATES v.

Argued November 4, 2008 —Decided January 26, 2009*\nNuclear utilities generally procure their fuel, “low enriched uranium”\n (LEU), through one of two types of contracts. Under an “enriched\n uranium product” (EUP) contract, the utility simply pays the en\n richer cash for LEU of a desired quantity and “assay,” i.e., its per\n centage of the isotope necessary for a nuclear reaction. The amount\n of energy required to enrich a quantity of “feed uranium” to a given\n assay is described in terms of an industry standard called a “separa\n tive work unit” (SWU). Under a “SWU contract,” the utility provides\n a quantity of feed uranium and pays the enricher for the SWUs to\n produce the required LEU quantity and assay. SWU contracts do not\n require that the required number of SWUs actually be applied to the\n utility’s uranium. Because feed uranium is fungible and essentially\n trades like a commodity, and because profitable operation of an en\n richment plant requires the constant processing of feed uranium from\n the enricher’s undifferentiated stock, the LEU provided to a utility\n under a SWU contract cannot be traced to the particular unenriched\n uranium the utility provided.\n    Petitioners (collectively, USEC), who run the only uranium en\n richment factory in the United States, petitioned the Commerce De\n partment (Department) for relief under the Tariff Act of 1930, which\n calls for “antidumping” duties on “foreign merchandise” sold in this\n country at “less than its fair value,” 19 U. S. C. §1673, but does not\n touch international sales of services. USEC alleged that LEU im\n ported from European countries under both EUP and SWU contracts\n was being sold in the United States at less than fair value and was\n——————\n  * Together with No. 07–1078, USEC Inc. et al. v.

A.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    materially harming domestic industry. In its final determination, the\n    Department concluded that LEU from France, including LEU ac\n    quired under SWU contracts, was being sold here at less than fair\n    value. Among other things, the Department rejected the claim that\n    such transactions were sales of enrichment services, as provided in\n    SWU contracts. The Court of International Trade (CIT) ultimately\n    reversed, noting the “legal fiction” expressed in SWU contracts that\n    the very feed uranium delivered by a utility to an enricher is enriched\n    and then returned as LEU to the utility. Finding that the record did\n    not support a determination that the enricher has any ownership\n    rights, the CIT reasoned that the Department’s decision was unsup\n    ported by substantial evidence and not in accordance with law. The\n    Federal Circuit affirmed, approaching the issues much as the CIT\n    had.\nHeld: The Department’s take on the transactions at issue as sales of\n goods rather than services reflects a permissible interpretation and\n application of §1673. Because §1677(1) gives this determination to\n the Department in the first instance, the Department’s interpretation\n governs in the absence of unambiguous statutory language to the\n contrary or an unreasonable resolution of ambiguous language. See,\n e.g., Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n 467 U. S. 837. Two threshold propositions must be accepted. First,\n the Department reasonably concluded that §1673 is not limited by its\n terms to cash-only sales. If that were the case, any sale of a manu\n factured product could be exempted from the section’s operation by a\n contractual term stating part of the purchase price in terms of a\n commodity. Second, since public law is not constrained by private\n fiction, see, e.g., Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U. S. 332, 336, the De\n partment is not bound by the legal fiction created by SWU contracts\n that the very feed uranium delivered by a utility to an enricher is en\n riched and then returned as LEU to the utility. Thus, the test of the\n Department’s position turns first on whether the statute clearly ex\n cludes a transaction involving mixed payment for LEU that may and\n almost certainly will be produced from uranium feed distinct from\n what the utility provides. Although it is undisputed that §1673 ap\n plies to the sale of goods, not services, the section simply does not\n speak with the precision necessary to say definitively whether it ap\n plies to the LEU and the agreement giving the utility a right to get it.\n This is the very situation in which the Court looks to an authoritative\n agency for a decision about a statute’s scope. Once the choice is\n made, the Court asks only whether the Department’s application of\n the statute was reasonable. Where, as here, cash plus an untracked\n fungible commodity are exchanged for a substantially transformed\n version of the same commodity, the Department may reasonably\n                    Cite as: 555 U.

The Department’s position is re\n  inforced by practical reasons aimed at preserving antidumping du\n  ties’ effectiveness. It is undisputed that such duties apply to LEU\n  sold to a domestic utility by foreign enrichers under an EUP contract\n  calling for a single cash price that is less than fair value. Such a\n  transaction obviously opens the domestic enrichment industry to ma\n  terial injury, the very threat that §1673 was meant to counter. But\n  the same injury will occur if a SWU contract is untouchable. Under a\n  SWU contract, the domestic utility pays cash to a third party for un\n  enriched uranium and provides this along with additional cash in ex\n  change for LEU; any EUP contract could be structured as a SWU\n  contract simply by splitting the transaction in two, one contract to\n  buy unenriched uranium and another to enrich it. And the restruc\n  turing would not stop with uranium; contracts for many types of\n  goods would be replaced by separate contracts for the goods and for\n  processing services, and antidumping duties would primarily chastise\n  the uncreative. The Department’s attempt to foreclose this absurd\n  result by treating such transactions as sales of goods is eminently\n  reasonable.

S. C. §1673, but\ndoes not touch international sales of services. These cases\ntest the application of this antidumping provision to im­\nports of low enriched uranium (LEU), a highly processed\nderivative of natural uranium used as nuclear fuel, when\ndomestic utilities contract to obtain LEU for cash plus\nunenriched uranium delivered to a foreign enricher.\nAlthough the parties’ contracts call these transactions\nsales of uranium enrichment services, the Commerce\nDepartment treats them as sales of “foreign merchandise”\nsubject to the antidumping provision.          The issue is\nwhether the Commerce Department’s way of seeing the\ntransactions as sales of goods rather than services reflects\n2               UNITED STATES v. EURODIF S. A.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\na permissible interpretation and application of §1673. We\nhold that it does.\n                                I\n  There are five steps in transforming elemental uranium\ninto fuel rods for nuclear powerplants. After uranium ore\nis mined, it is milled into uranium concentrate called\n“yellowcake,” which is next converted into uranium\nhexafluoride gas or “feed uranium.” The fissionable iso­\ntope in unenriched feed uranium is then concentrated,\nproducing LEU in pellet form, which is in turn made into\nuranium fuel rods. These cases are about the fourth step:\nenriching uranium feedstock into LEU.\n  The uranium isotope needed for a nuclear reaction, U­\n235, amounts only to .711 percent by weight of natural\nuranium. Uranium whose concentration or “assay,” of U­\n235 has been enhanced to 20 percent or more is weapons­\ngrade, highly enriched uranium (HEU), whereas LEU has\na U-235 assay of 3 to 5 percent, making it useful as nu­\nclear fuel. One way to produce LEU, and the method at\nissue in these cases, is gaseous diffusion,1 whereby gase­\nous feed uranium is pushed through a long series of filters,\nseparating the gas into two streams. The stream passing\nthrough the filters (the “product stream”) gains a higher\nconcentration of the lighter U-235 isotope than the stream\nthat is filtered out (the “tails”). Because the concentration\nreached at each individual filter is minor, the gas must be\nforced through hundreds or even thousands of filters, at\ngreat expenditure of electricity, before the product stream\nreaches the desired assay. The amount of energy required\nto enrich a quantity of feed uranium to a given assay is\nmeasured in terms of an industry standard called a “sepa­\nrative work unit” or SWU (pronounced “swoo”). In prac­\n\n——————\n  1 LEU can also be produced through a centrifuge method or by back­\n\nblending unenriched uranium with weapons-grade uranium.\n                    Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                  3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ntice, however, a given degree of enrichment will depend on\nadjusting the quantities of two separate variables, feed\nuranium and electricity, in inverse proportions. Thus, if\nthe electric rate is stable but the value of feed uranium\nfalls, an enricher may produce LEU by “overfeeding,”\nsubjecting a greater quantity of feed uranium to fewer\nSWUs, and when the value of feed uranium goes up and\nelectricity does not, “underfeeding” can use more SWUs to\nsqueeze extra U-235 from the tails.\n   Nuclear utilities generally get LEU in one of two ways.\nUnder an “enriched uranium product” or “EUP” contract, a\nutility simply buys a desired quantity and assay of LEU\nfor cash. Under a “SWU contract,” the utility provides a\nquantity of feed uranium and pays the enricher for the\nSWUs to produce the quantity and assay of LEU called\nfor.2 Despite their name, SWU contracts do not require\nthat the contractual number of SWUs actually be applied\nto the quantity of uranium provided, Notice of Final De­\ntermination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Low En­\nriched Uranium From France, 66 Fed. Reg. 65877, 65884\n(2001) (hereinafter LEU from France); rather, the enricher\nremains free to overfeed or underfeed so long as it delivers\nthe specified LEU. Moreover, because feed uranium is\nfungible, and “for all intents and purposes, trades like a\ncommodity,” ibid., and because profitable operation of an\nenrichment plant requires the constant processing of feed\nuranium from the enricher’s undifferentiated stock, the\nLEU provided to a utility under a SWU contract cannot be\ntraced to the particular unenriched uranium the utility\nprovided.\n   Petitioners, USEC Inc. and its subsidiary, United States\nEnrichment Corporation, (USEC collectively) run the only\n——————\n  2 Many SWU contracts give the utility the option of providing a com­\n\nparable quantity of uranium concentrate in lieu of the specified feed\nuranium.

Reg. 65882–65883.\n  In its final determination, the Commerce Department\nconcluded that LEU from France, including LEU acquired\nunder SWU contracts, was being sold, or likely to be sold,\nin the United States at less than fair value.4 Id., at 65878.\n——————\n 4 The   Commerce Department concluded in a separate determination\n6                 UNITED STATES v. EURODIF S. A.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nIn deciding that SWU contracts are for a sale of LEU, not\nenrichment services, the Department stressed several\nfeatures of the transactions. First, because the enrich­\nment process accounts for approximately 60 percent of the\nvalue of LEU and works a “substantial transformation” on\nuranium feedstock, id., at 65881, enrichment creates “the\nessential character” of LEU, id., at 65884. Second, “en­\nrichers not only have complete control over the enrichment\nprocess, but in fact control the level of usage of the natural\nuranium provided.” Ibid. Third, the utilities themselves\ntake no part in the manufacture of LEU and are the sole\npurchasers of the product. Ibid.\n   The Commerce Department also rejected the argument\nthat LEU transferred pursuant to SWU contracts should\nnot be considered “sold” in light of a “tolling” regulation\nthen (but no longer) in effect. Ibid. The regulation stated\nthat a “toller,” a subcontractor who sells processing ser­\nvices in, or material for incorporation into, subject mer­\nchandise, would not be considered a manufacturer or\nproducer “where the toller or subcontractor does not ac­\nquire ownership, and does not control the relevant sale, of\nthe subject merchandise.” 19 CFR §351.401(h) (2000)\n(withdrawn in Import Administration, Withdrawal of\nRegulations Governing the Treatment of Subcontractors,\n(“Tolling” Operations), 73 Fed. Reg. 16517 (2008) (herein­\nafter Tolling Operations)). This regulation, the Commerce\nDepartment explained, was intended to apply in situations\nwhere a good is first sold by a manufacturer and then\nresold by an exporter or reseller.

In economic reality, the\nCommerce Department said, “the contracts designated as\nSWU contracts are functionally equivalent to those desig­\nnated as EUP transactions.” Id., at 65885.5\n  Eurodif challenged the Department’s determination\nbefore the Court of International Trade (CIT), which re­\nmanded for “a more persuasive explanation” of the tolling\nregulation.

A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nother evidence in the record convinced the Department\nthat “enrichers own, and hold title to, all the LEU they\nproduce,” id., at 217a, a conclusion grounded on findings\nthat “enrichers hold inventories of uranium from various\nsources, including uranium owned by the enricher itself,\nand produce LEU without relying solely upon the input\nfrom a particular customer.” Id., at 221a. Finally, the\nDepartment emphasized that the enrichers “have com­\nplete control over the enrichment process and control the\namount of uranium and energy actually used in producing\nthe LEU.” Id., at 231a.\n  The CIT was unconvinced and reversed, relying on what\nit candidly recognized as a “legal fiction” expressed in\nSWU contracts, “that the very feed uranium delivered by a\nutility to an enricher is enriched and then returned as\nLEU to the utility.” USEC Inc. v. United States, 281\nF. Supp. 2d 1334, 1339 (2003). The CIT reasoned, because\n“nothing in the record support[ed] a determination that\nthe enricher has any ownership rights,” the Commerce\nDepartment’s determination was “unsupported by sub­\nstantial evidence and not in accordance with law.” Id., at\n1340.\n  USEC challenged this conclusion in an interlocutory\nappeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit,\nwhich affirmed. Eurodif S. A. v. United States, 411 F. 3d\n1355 (2005) (Eurodif I). The court approached the issues\nmuch as the CIT had, with the observation that “the SWU\ncontracts in this case do not evidence any intention by the\nparties to vest the enrichers with ownership rights in the\ndelivered unenriched uranium or the finished LEU.” Id.,\nat 1362. It recalled that in a previous case, Florida Power\n& Light Co. v. United States, 307 F. 3d 1364 (CA Fed.\n2002), it had accepted the Government’s position that\nSWU contracts were for services, not for “ ‘disposal of\npersonal property,’ ” and so were outside the cause of\naction provided by the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, 41\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

Eurodif I, supra, at 1363, and n. 3\n(quoting Florida Power & Light Co., supra, at 1373).\nWhile the court conceded that SWU agreements “do ‘not\nfall neatly’ either into the category of contracts for services\nor the category of contracts for the sale of goods,” 411\nF. 3d, at 1364 (quoting Florida Power & Light Co., supra,\nat 1373–1374), it still concluded that “even under the\ndeferential standard of review that we apply in this case,\nwe choose not to ignore our previous holdings.” Eurodif I,\nsupra, at 1363.\n  Shortly after this decision, we held in National Cable &\nTelecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services,\n545 U. S. 967, 982–983 (2005), that a court’s choice of one\nreasonable reading of an ambiguous statute does not\npreclude an implementing agency from later adopting a\ndifferent reasonable interpretation. On rehearing, the\nFederal Circuit responded to National Cable & Telecom\nmunications Association by explaining that it had not\nrejected the Commerce Department’s position because it\nconflicted with the prior interpretive choice that carried\nthe day in Florida Power & Light. Eurodif S. A. v. United\nStates, 423 F. 3d 1275, 1277–1278 (2005) (Eurodif II). The\nCircuit, rather, saw no statutory uncertainty to be re­\nsolved: “the antidumping duty statute unambiguously\napplies to the sale of goods and not services” and “it is\nclear that [SWU] contracts are contracts for services and\nnot goods.” Id., at 1278. After final judgment was en­\ntered, Eurodif S. A. v. United States, 506 F. 3d 1051, 1053\n(CA Fed. 2007) (Eurodif III), we granted certiorari 553\nU.

We now reverse.\n                            II\n  The issue is not whether, for purposes of 19 U. S. C.\n§1673, the better view is that a SWU contract is one for\n10               UNITED STATES v. EURODIF S. A.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe sale of services, not goods. The statute gives this\ndetermination to the Department of Commerce in the first\ninstance, §1677(1), and when the Department exercises\nthis authority in the course of adjudication, its interpreta­\ntion governs in the absence of unambiguous statutory\nlanguage to the contrary or unreasonable resolution of\nlanguage that is ambiguous.6 United States v. Mead\nCorp., 533 U. S. 218, 229–230 (2001) (citing Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U. S. 837 (1984)). This is so even after a change in\nregulatory treatment, which “is not a basis for declining to\nanalyze the agency’s interpretation under the Chevron\nframework.” National Cable & Telecommunications Assn.,\n545 U. S., at 981. “ ‘[T]he whole point of Chevron is to\nleave the discretion provided by the ambiguities of a stat­\nute with the implementing agency.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Smiley\nv.

For the reasons given by the Department in its\nremand determination, we are not convinced that the tolling regulation\nprecludes viewing SWU transactions as the sale of LEU; but even if it\ndid, it has since been withdrawn, Tolling Operations, 73 Fed.

United States, 307 F. 3d 1364 (CA Fed.\n2002), was inconsistent with the Government’s position here, it would\nnot speak to the deference owed the Commerce Department under\nChevron.\n                    Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncation of §1673, two threshold propositions must be taken\nas given. First, we think the Department reasonably\nconcluded that §1673 is not limited by its terms to cash­\nonly sales. Otherwise, any sale of a manufactured product\ncould be exempted from the operation of §1673 by a con­\ntractual term stating part of the purchase price in terms of\na commodity.8\n   Second, in applying §1673, the Commerce Department is\nnot bound by the “legal fiction [created by SWU contracts]\nthat the very feed uranium delivered by a utility to an\nenricher is enriched and then returned as LEU to the\nutility.” USEC, 281 F. Supp. 2d, at 1339. The parties are\nfree to contract as they wish, and they may genuinely\nregard SWU agreements as contracts for the sale of en­\nrichment services. But, whatever the significance of such\na term in a contract dispute, cf. Florida Power & Light\nCo., 307 F. 3d 1364, it is well settled that in reading\nregulatory and taxation statutes, “form should be disre­\ngarded for substance and the emphasis should be on eco­\nnomic reality.” Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U. S. 332, 336\n(1967). See also Frank Lyon Co. v. United States, 435\nU.

These\ncalculations, respondents argue, “were a charade, underscoring that the\nantidumping laws cannot be applied to these SWU contracts.” Id., at\n48. To the degree respondents’ argument is that antidumping duties\nmay never be applied to mixed cash-commodity sales, it is doomed by\nimplausibility. If respondents are contending that the Commerce\nDepartment’s dumping determination improperly assessed the normal\nvalue of LEU, they are raising an issue well outside the scope of our\ngrant of certiorari.\n12            UNITED STATES v.

Surrender to private\ncontractual terms is especially uncalled for in dealing with\ninternational tariffs, as Congress saw when it amended\nthe Tariff Act to say that the sale of foreign merchandise\nincludes “the entering into of any leasing arrangement\nregarding the merchandise that is equivalent to the sale of\nthe merchandise.”        Trade and Tariff Act of 1984,\n§602(b)(2), 98 Stat. 3024, 19 U. S C. §1673.\n  Since public law is not constrained by private fiction,\nthe test of the Department’s position turns first on\nwhether the statute clearly excludes a transaction involv­\ning mixed payment for LEU that may and almost certainly\nwill be produced from uranium feed distinct from what the\nutility provides. No one disputes that §1673 applies to the\nsale of goods, not services, LEU From France, 66 Fed. Reg.\n65882–65883. Nor do we think anyone would deny that\nthe exchange of cash combined with a commodity for a\nproduct that uses that very commodity as a constituent\nmaterial is sometimes a sale of services and sometimes a\nsale of goods, the distinction being clear at the extremes.\nA customer who comes to a laundry with cash and dirty\nshirts is clearly purchasing cleaning services, not clean\nshirts. And a customer who provides cash and sand to a\nmanufacturer of generic silicon processors is clearly\nbuying computer chips rather than sand enhancement\nservices.\n  But the line blurs when the facts get more complicated,\nand SWU contracts exemplify a class of transactions that\nthe Federal Circuit recognized does “ ‘not fall neatly’ either\ninto the category of contracts for services or the category of\ncontracts for the sale of goods.” Eurodif I, 411 F. 3d, at\n1364 (quoting Florida Power & Light Co., supra, at 1373–\n1374). The agreement is not like the laundry ticket, which\nsays that the same shirts are supposed to come back, just\nminus the dirt around the collar.

As to that, the Commerce Department relied on\ntwo related characteristics of these transactions in decid­\ning SWU contracts should be treated as a sale of LEU. It\nstressed that the utility in a SWU contract provides cash\nplus a fungible commodity that is not tracked after its\ndelivery to the enricher, in exchange for a product owned\nby the enricher.9 And it recognized that the enrichment\n——————\n  9 Eurodif  argues that the Commerce Department erred in concluding\nthat enrichers own LEU prior to its delivery under a SWU contract.\nId., at 36–37. While the precise form of this argument is unclear, it\nfails under any reading. Respondents seem to mean that the Com­\nmerce Department’s interpretation of §1673 is impermissible as being\ninconsistent with the formal terms of SWU contracts, an argument we\nrejected above. The argument could also be read to suggest that the\nCommerce Department lacked substantial evidence to conclude that,\ncontractual formalities aside, enrichers in fact own the LEU provided\nunder SWU contracts prior to its delivery. But the evidence in the\nrecord not only supports the Department’s conclusion, it compels it. It\nis undisputed that the LEU delivered under a SWU contract is not\nactually derived from the feed uranium provided as consideration; as\nCIT observed, the notion that the same feed uranium delivered by a\nutility to an enricher is enriched and then returned as LEU to the\nutility is “a legal fiction.” USEC Inc. v. United States, 281 F. Supp. 2d\n1334, 1339 (2003). Moreover, the enricher is free to vary the amount of\nfeed uranium used to produce an order of LEU, either stockpiling feed\nuranium or supplementing its stores from other sources. Finally, the\nSWU contracts at issue provide that the utility retains title to the feed\nuranium until delivery of the LEU, at which point it obtains title in the\n14              UNITED STATES v. EURODIF S. A.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nprocess results in a substantial transformation of the\nunenriched uranium.\n  The combination of these characteristics reasonably\ncaptures a common understanding of the sale of a good.\nBecause an individual’s shirts are not fungible, they are\ntracked during the cleaning process and returned to the\nsame customer who brought them in; there are no good\nreasons to treat them as owned for a time by the laundry,\nand no one does. And without any transfer of ownership,\nthe salient feature of the transaction is the cleaning of the\nshirt, a service. Conversely, where a constituent material\nis untracked and fungible, ownership is usually seen as\ntransferred, and the transaction is less likely to be a sale\nof services, as the Court explained years ago in distin­\nguishing a common-law bailment from a sale:\n     “[W]here logs are delivered to be sawed into boards, or\n     leather to be made into shoes, rags into paper, olives\n     into oil, grapes into wine, wheat into flour, if the\n     product of the identical articles delivered is to be re­\n     turned to the original owner in a new form, it is said\n     to be a bailment, and the title never vests in the\n     manufacturer. If, on the other hand, the manufac­\n     turer is not bound to return the same wheat or flour\n     or paper, but may deliver any other of equal value, it\n     is said to be a sale or a loan, and the title to the thing\n     delivered vests in the manufacturer.” Powder Co. v.\n     Burkhardt, 97 U. S. 110, 116 (1878).10\nAnd when the manufacturer is not only free to return\n——————\nLEU. In light of this process, some entity must own the LEU prior to\ndelivery and obtain title to the feed uranium after delivery, absent\nsome modern analog to the abhorrent possibility of an abeyance of\nseizen; the enricher is the only serious candidate.\n   10 Common law definitions do not necessarily control the meaning of\n\nterms in modern trade laws; we merely mean to show the long pedigree\nof the distinction relied upon by the Commerce Department.\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

After\nall, what makes the hypothetical exchange of sand\nfor silicon processors so obviously a sale of goods is the\nextreme transformation brought about by the chip\nmanufacturer.\n   These are good analytical grounds to show that SWU\ntransactions are reasonably placed within the ambit of\nsale of goods, and the Department’s reliance on them is\nreinforced by practical reasons aimed at preserving the\neffectiveness of antidumping duties. There is no dispute\nthat LEU sold under an EUP contract at less than fair\nvalue must be subjected to antidumping duties under\n§1673, there being a clear sale of goods when a domestic\nutility pays a single sale price in cash for the feed uranium\nand enrichment components represented by LEU. If\nforeign enrichers set this price below the fair value of\nLEU, the domestic enrichment industry is obviously open\nto material injury, the very threat the antidumping stat­\nute was meant to counter, see H. R. Rep. No. 1, at 23. But\nthe same injury would occur if a SWU contract were un­\ntouchable. Under a SWU contract, the domestic utility\npays cash to a third party for unenriched uranium and\nprovides this along with additional cash in exchange for\nLEU; any EUP contract could be structured as a SWU\ncontract simply by splitting the transaction in two, one\ncontract to buy unenriched uranium and another to enrich\nit.11 And the restructuring would not stop with uranium;\n——————\n   11 This would be particularly easy in these cases, since COGEMA,\n\nEurodif’s parent company, “is a major world supplier of natural ura­\nnium for the production of LEU.” Final Remand Determination, App. G\nto Pet. for Cert. 221a, n. 38. In fact, many SWU contracts provide that\nif a utility fails to deliver feed uranium, the enricher will substitute\nfeed uranium of its own, which may then be purchased from the en­\n16               UNITED STATES v. EURODIF S. A.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncontracts for imported pasta would be replaced by sepa­\nrate contracts for wheat and wheat processing services,\nsweater imports would give way to separate contracts for\nwool and knitting services, and antidumping duties would\nprimarily chastise the uncreative.12 The Commerce De­\npartment’s attempt to foreclose this absurd result by\ntreating SWU transactions as sales of goods is eminently\nreasonable.\n                            III\n   Where a domestic buyer’s cash and an untracked, fungi­\nble commodity are exchanged with a foreign contractor for\na substantially transformed version of the same commod­\nity, the Commerce Department may reasonably treat the\ntransaction as the sale of a good under §1673. We there­\nfore reverse the judgment of the Federal Circuit and re­\nmand the cases for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\nricher.

More fundamentally, this argument fails to explain why\nthe Commerce Department should be required to chase after down­\nstream resellers when the first sale has the same economic substance.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145913/", "sha1": "08000c5763218dba0d87212b19a50f0267059eeb", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-018", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:09:28"}
