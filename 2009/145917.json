Argued December 2, 2008—Decided January 21, 2009\nPetitioners filed suit against respondents, the local school district’s\n  governing board and superintendent, alleging that their response to\n  allegations of sexual harassment of petitioners’ daughter by an older\n  student was inadequate, raising claims under, inter alia, Title IX of\n  the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U. S. C. §1681(a), and 42\n  U. S. C. §1983 for violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the\n  Fourteenth Amendment. Among its rulings, the District Court dis\n  missed the §1983 claim. The First Circuit affirmed, holding that,\n  under this Court’s precedents, Title IX’s implied private remedy was\n  sufficiently comprehensive to preclude the use of §1983 to advance\n  constitutional claims.\nHeld:\n    1. Title IX does not preclude a §1983 action alleging unconstitu\n tional gender discrimination in schools. Pp. 4–12.\n       (a) In Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea\n Clammers Assn., 453 U. S. 1; Smith v. Robinson, 468 U. S. 992; and\n Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U. S. 113, this Court found that\n particular statutory enactments precluded §1983 claims where it was\n established that Congress intended the statute’s remedial scheme to\n “be the exclusive avenue through which a plaintiff may assert [such]\n claims,” Smith, supra, at 1009. In determining whether Congress in\n tended for a subsequent statute to preclude the enforcement of a fed\n eral right under §1983, the Court has placed primary emphasis on\n the nature and extent of that statute’s remedial scheme. See Sea\n Clammers, 453 U. S., at 20. Where the §1983 claim alleges a consti\n tutional violation, a lack of congressional intent to preclude may also\n be inferred from a comparison of the rights and protections of the\n2           FITZGERALD v. BARNSTABLE SCHOOL COMM.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    other statute and those existing under the Constitution. Pp. 4–7.\n         (b) In the absence of a comprehensive remedial scheme compara\n    ble to those at issue in Sea Clammers, Smith, and Rancho Palos\n    Verdes, and in light of the divergent coverage of Title IX and the\n    Equal Protection Clause, it must be concluded that Title IX was not\n    meant to be an exclusive mechanism for addressing gender discrimi\n    nation in schools, or a substitute for §1983 suits as a means of enforc\n    ing constitutional rights. Pp. 7–12.\n           (i) Title IX’s only express enforcement mechanism, 20 U. S. C.\n    §1682, is an administrative procedure resulting in the withdrawal of\n    federal funding from noncompliant institutions. This Court has also\n    recognized an implied private right of action, Cannon v. University of\n    Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 717, for which both injunctive relief and\n    damages are available, Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools,\n    503 U. S. 60, 76. These remedies stand in stark contrast to the “un\n    usually elaborate,” “carefully tailored,” and “restrictive” enforcement\n    schemes of the statutes in Sea Clammers, Smith, and Rancho Palos\n    Verdes. Unlike those statutes, Title IX has no administrative ex\n    haustion requirement and no notice provisions. Plaintiffs can file di\n    rectly in court under its implied private right of action and can obtain\n    the full range of remedies. Accordingly, parallel and concurrent\n    §1983 claims will neither circumvent required procedures nor allow\n    access to new remedies. Moreover, under Rancho Palos Verdes, “[t]he\n    provision of an express, private means of redress in the statute itself”\n    is a key consideration in determining congressional intent, and “the\n    existence of a more restrictive private remedy for statutory violations\n    has been the dividing line between those cases in which . . . an action\n    would lie under §1983 and those in which we have held that it would\n    not.” 544 U. S., at 121. Title IX contains no express private remedy,\n    much less a more restrictive one. Pp. 7–9.\n           (ii) Because Title IX’s protections are narrower in some re\n    spects and broader in others than those guaranteed under the Equal\n    Protection Clause, the Court cannot agree with the First Circuit that\n    Congress saw Title IX as the sole means of correcting unconstitu\n    tional gender discrimination in schools. Title IX reaches institutions\n    and programs that receive federal funds, 20 U. S. C. §1681(a), which\n    may include nonpublic institutions, §1681(c), but it has consistently\n    been interpreted as not authorizing suit against school officials,\n    teachers, and other individuals. Moreover, while the constitutional\n    provision reaches only state actors, §1983 equal protection claims\n    may be brought against individuals as well as state entities. West v.\n    Atkins, 487 U. S. 42, 48–51. And Title IX exempts from its restric\n    tions several activities that may be challenged on constitutional\n    grounds. See, e.g., §1681(a)(5). Even where particular activities and\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  particular defendants are subject to both Title IX and the Equal Pro\n  tection Clause, the standards for establishing liability may not be\n  wholly congruent. Compare Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School\n  Dist., 524 U. S. 274, 290, with Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social\n  Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 694. Pp. 9–11.\n         (iii) The Court’s conclusion is consistent with Title IX’s context\n  and history. Because the Congress that enacted Title IX authorized\n  the Attorney General to intervene in private suits alleging sex dis\n  crimination violative of the Equal Protection Clause, 42 U. S. C.\n  §2000h–2, Congress must have explicitly envisioned that private\n  plaintiffs would bring constitutional claims to challenge gender dis\n  crimination via §1983. Moreover, Title IX was modeled after Title VI\n  of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Cannon, supra, at 694–695, and, at\n  the time of Title IX’s 1972 enactment, the lower courts routinely in\n  terpreted Title VI to allow for parallel and concurrent §1983 claims.\n  Absent contrary evidence, it follows that Congress intended Title IX\n  to be interpreted similarly to allow for parallel and concurrent §1983\n  claims. Pp. 11–12.\n    2. As neither of the courts below addressed the merits of petition\n  ers’ constitutional claims or even the sufficiency of their pleadings,\n  this Court will not do so in the first instance here.

S. C. §1681(a), precludes an action\nunder Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983, alleging uncon\nstitutional gender discrimination in schools. The Court of\nAppeals for the First Circuit held that it does. 504 F. 3d\n165 (2007). We reverse.\n                              I\n   Because this case comes to us on a motion to dismiss\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), we assume\nthe truth of the facts as alleged in petitioners’ complaint.\nDuring the 2000–2001 school year, the daughter of peti\ntioners Lisa and Robert Fitzgerald was a kindergarten\nstudent in the Barnstable, Massachusetts, school system,\nand rode the bus to school each morning. One day she told\nher parents that, whenever she wore a dress, a third-grade\nboy on the school bus would bully her into lifting her skirt.\nLisa Fitzgerald immediately called the school principal,\nFrederick Scully, who arranged a meeting later that day\nwith the Fitzgeralds, their daughter, and another school\n2       FITZGERALD v. BARNSTABLE SCHOOL COMM.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nofficial, Lynda Day. Scully and Day then questioned the\nalleged bully, who denied the allegations. Day also inter\nviewed the bus driver and several students who rode the\nbus. She concluded that she could not corroborate the\ngirl’s version of the events.\n   The Fitzgeralds’ daughter then provided new details of\nthe alleged abuse to her parents, who relayed them to\nScully. Specifically, she told her parents that in addition\nto bullying her into raising her skirt, the boy coerced her\ninto pulling down her underpants and spreading her legs.\nScully scheduled a second meeting with the Fitzgeralds to\ndiscuss the additional details and again questioned the\nboy and other students.\n   Meanwhile, the local police department conducted an\nindependent investigation and concluded there was insuf\nficient evidence to bring criminal charges against the boy.\nBased partly on the police investigation and partly on the\nschool’s own investigation, Scully similarly concluded\nthere was insufficient evidence to warrant discipline.\nScully did propose remedial measures to the Fitzgeralds.\nHe suggested transferring their daughter to a different\nbus or leaving rows of empty seats between the kinder\ngarteners and older students on the original bus. The\nFitzgeralds felt that these proposals punished their\ndaughter instead of the boy and countered with alterna\ntive proposals. They suggested transferring the boy to a\ndifferent bus or placing a monitor on the original bus. The\nBarnstable school system’s superintendent, Russell Dever,\ndid not act on these proposals.\n   The Fitzgeralds began driving their daughter to school\nto avoid further bullying on the bus, but she continued to\nreport unsettling incidents at school. The Fitzgeralds\nreported each incident to Scully. The Fitzgeralds’ daugh\nter had an unusual number of absences during the re\nmainder of the school year.\n   In April 2002, the Fitzgeralds filed suit in District\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

Their\ncomplaint included: (1) a claim for violation of Title IX\nagainst the Barnstable School Committee (the school\nsystem’s governing body), (2) claims under 42 U. S. C.\n§1983 for violations of Title IX and the Equal Protection\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment against the school\ncommittee and Dever, and (3) Massachusetts state-law\nclaims against the school committee and Dever. The\nschool committee and Dever (respondents here), filed a\nmotion to dismiss, which the District Court granted as to\nthe §1983 claims and the state-law claims. On the Title\nIX claim, the school committee filed a motion for summary\njudgment, which the District Court also granted. Hunter\nv.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 266\n(Mass. 2006).\n   The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed. 504\nF. 3d 165. Turning first to the Title IX claim against the\nschool committee, the court noted three points that were\nnot in dispute: (1) the school committee was the recipient\nof federal funds and was therefore subject to Title IX, (2)\nthe school committee had actual knowledge of the harass\nment the Fitzgeralds’ daughter suffered, and (3) if the\nallegations of the complaint were true, the harassment\nwas “severe, pervasive and objectively offensive.” Id., at\n172. The court concluded that the Fitzgeralds’ Title IX\nclaim lacked merit, however, because the response of the\nschool committee and Dever to the reported harassment\nhad been objectively reasonable. Id., at 175.\n   The Court of Appeals turned next to the Fitzgeralds’\n§1983 claims. Relying on this Court’s precedents in Mid\ndlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clam\nmers Assn., 453 U. S. 1 (1981), Smith v. Robinson, 468\nU. S. 992 (1984), and Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544\nU. S. 113 (2005), the court characterized Title IX’s implied\n4         FITZGERALD v. BARNSTABLE SCHOOL COMM.\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nprivate remedy as “sufficiently comprehensive” to preclude\nuse of §1983 to advance statutory claims based on Title IX\nitself. 504 F. 3d, at 179. This reasoning, the court held,\n“appl[ied] with equal force” to the constitutional claims.\nIbid. The court concluded that “Congress saw Title IX as\nthe sole means of vindicating the constitutional right to be\nfree from gender discrimination perpetrated by educa\ntional institutions.” Ibid.\n   The Court of Appeals’ decision deepened a conflict\namong the Circuits regarding whether Title IX precludes\nuse of §1983 to redress unconstitutional gender discrimi\nnation in schools.

S. ____ (2009)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nIn three cases, this Court has found that statutory enact\nments precluded claims under this statute. Sea Clam\nmers, supra; Smith, supra; Rancho Palos Verdes, supra.\nThese cases establish that “[t]he crucial consideration is\nwhat Congress intended.” Smith, 468 U. S., at 1012. If\nCongress intended a statute’s remedial scheme to “be the\nexclusive avenue through which a plaintiff may assert\n[the] claim,” id., at 1009, the §1983 claims are precluded.\nSee Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U. S., at 120–121 (“The\ncritical question, then, is whether Congress meant the\njudicial remedy authorized by [the statute] to coexist with\nan alternative remedy available in a §1983 action”).\n   In those cases in which the §1983 claim is based on a\nstatutory right, “evidence of such congressional intent may\nbe found directly in the statute creating the right, or\ninferred from the statute’s creation of a comprehensive\nenforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual\nenforcement under §1983.” Id., at 120 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In cases in which the §1983 claim alleges\na constitutional violation, lack of congressional intent may\nbe inferred from a comparison of the rights and protec\ntions of the statute and those existing under the Constitu\ntion. Where the contours of such rights and protections\ndiverge in significant ways, it is not likely that Congress\nintended to displace §1983 suits enforcing constitutional\nrights. Our conclusions regarding congressional intent\ncan be confirmed by a statute’s context. Id., at 127\n(BREYER, J., concurring) (“[C]ontext, not just literal text,\nwill often lead a court to Congress’ intent in respect to a\nparticular statute”).\n   In determining whether a subsequent statute precludes\nthe enforcement of a federal right under §1983, we have\nplaced primary emphasis on the nature and extent of that\nstatute’s remedial scheme. See Sea Clammers, supra, at\n20 (“When the remedial devices provided in a particular\nAct are sufficiently comprehensive, they may suffice to\n6       FITZGERALD v. BARNSTABLE SCHOOL COMM.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndemonstrate congressional intent to preclude the remedy\nof suits under §1983”).\n   Sea Clammers illustrates this approach. The plaintiffs\nbrought suit under §1983 for violations of the Federal\nWater Pollution Control Act and the Marine Protection,\nResearch, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972. This Court’s\nanalysis focused on these two statutes’ “unusually elabo\nrate enforcement provisions,” which authorized the Envi\nronmental Protection Agency to seek civil and criminal\npenalties for violations, permitted “ ‘any interested per\nson’ ” to seek judicial review, and contained detailed citi\nzen suit provisions allowing for injunctive relief. 453\nU. S., at 13–14. Allowing parallel §1983 claims to proceed,\nwe concluded, would have thwarted Congress’ intent in\nformulating and detailing these provisions.\n   In Smith, the plaintiffs alleged deprivation of a free,\nappropriate public education for their handicapped child,\nin violation of the Education of the Handicapped Act\n(EHA) and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses\nof the Fourteenth Amendment. Departing from the pat\ntern of the plaintiffs in Sea Clammers, the Smith plaintiffs\nrelied on §1983 to assert independent constitutional\nrights, not to assert the statutory rights guaranteed by the\nEHA. As in Sea Clammers, however, this Court focused\non the statute’s detailed remedial scheme in concluding\nthat Congress intended the statute to provide the sole\navenue for relief. Smith, 468 U. S., at 1011 (noting “the\ncomprehensive nature of the procedures and guarantees\nset out in the [the statute] and Congress’ express efforts to\nplace on local and state educational agencies the primary\nresponsibility for developing a plan to accommodate the\nneeds of each individual handicapped child”).\n   In Rancho Palos Verdes, we again focused on a statute’s\nremedial scheme in inferring congressional intent for\nexclusivity. After being denied a permit to build a radio\ntower on his property, the plaintiff brought claims for\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ninjunctive relief under the Telecommunications Act of\n1996 (TCA) and for damages and attorney’s fees under\n§1983. Noting that the TCA provides highly detailed and\nrestrictive administrative and judicial remedies, and\nexplaining that “limitations upon the remedy contained in\nthe statute are deliberate and are not to be evaded\nthrough §1983,” we again concluded that Congress must\nhave intended the statutory remedies to be exclusive. 544\nU. S., at 124.\n   In all three cases, the statutes at issue required plain\ntiffs to comply with particular procedures and/or to ex\nhaust particular administrative remedies prior to filing\nsuit. Sea Clammers, supra, at 6; Smith, supra, at 1011–\n1012; Rancho Palos Verdes, supra, at 122. Offering plain\ntiffs a direct route to court via §1983 would have circum\nvented these procedures and given plaintiffs access to\ntangible benefits—such as damages, attorney’s fees, and\ncosts—that were unavailable under the statutes.1 “Allow\ning a plaintiff to circumvent” the statutes’ provisions in\nthis way would have been “inconsistent with Congress’\ncarefully tailored scheme.” Smith, supra, at 1012.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  1 The statutes at issue in Sea Clammers and Smith did not allow for\n\ndamages. The statute at issue in Rancho Palos Verdes did not ex\npressly allow for damages, but some lower courts interpreted it to do so.\nThe statutes at issue in Smith and Rancho Palos Verdes did not allow\nfor attorney’s fees and costs. See Sea Clammers, 453 U. S., at 6–7, 13–\n14 (addressing the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 86 Stat. 816,\nas amended, 33 U. S. C. §1251 et seq., and the Marine Protection,\nResearch, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 1052, as amended, 33\nU. S. C. §1401 et seq.); Smith, 468 U.

BARNSTABLE SCHOOL COMM.\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n                                B\n                                1\n    Section 901(a) of Title IX provides:\n      “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of\n      sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the\n      benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under\n      any education program or activity receiving Federal\n      financial assistance.” 20 U. S. C. §1681(a).\nThe statute’s only express enforcement mechanism, §1682,\nis an administrative procedure resulting in the with\ndrawal of federal funding from institutions that are not in\ncompliance. In addition, this Court has recognized an\nimplied private right of action. Cannon v. University of\nChicago, 441 U. S. 677, 717 (1979). In a suit brought\npursuant to this private right, both injunctive relief and\ndamages are available. Franklin v. Gwinnett County\nPublic Schools, 503 U. S. 60, 76 (1992).\n   These remedies—withdrawal of federal funds and an\nimplied cause of action—stand in stark contrast to the\n“unusually elaborate,” “carefully tailored,” and “restric\ntive” enforcement schemes of the statutes at issue in Sea\nClammers, Smith, and Rancho Palos Verdes. Unlike those\nstatutes, Title IX has no administrative exhaustion re\nquirement and no notice provisions. Under its implied\nprivate right of action, plaintiffs can file directly in court,\nCannon, supra, at 717, and can obtain the full range of\nremedies, see Franklin, supra, at 72 (concluding that\n“Congress did not intend to limit the remedies available in\na suit brought under Title IX”). As a result, parallel and\nconcurrent §1983 claims will neither circumvent required\nprocedures, nor allow access to new remedies.\n   Moreover, this Court explained in Rancho Palos Verdes\nthat “[t]he provision of an express, private means of re\ndress in the statute itself” is a key consideration in deter\nmining congressional intent, and that “the existence of a\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmore restrictive private remedy for statutory violations\nhas been the dividing line between those cases in which\nwe have held that an action would lie under §1983 and\nthose in which we have held that it would not.” 544 U. S.,\nat 121 (emphasis added). As noted, Title IX contains no\nexpress private remedy, much less a more restrictive one.\nThis Court has never held that an implied right of action\nhad the effect of precluding suit under §1983, likely be\ncause of the difficulty of discerning congressional intent in\nsuch a situation. See Franklin, supra, at 76 (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (“Quite obviously, the search for\nwhat was Congress’ remedial intent as to a right whose\nvery existence Congress did not expressly acknowledge is\nunlikely to succeed”). Mindful that we should “not lightly\nconclude that Congress intended to preclude reliance on\n§1983 as a remedy for a substantial equal protection\nclaim,” Smith, 468 U. S., at 1012, we see no basis for doing\nso here.\n                              2\n   A comparison of the substantive rights and protections\nguaranteed under Title IX and under the Equal Protection\nClause lends further support to the conclusion that Con\ngress did not intend Title IX to preclude §1983 constitu\ntional suits. Title IX’s protections are narrower in some\nrespects and broader in others. Because the protections\nguaranteed by the two sources of law diverge in this way,\nwe cannot agree with the Court of Appeals that “Congress\nsaw Title IX as the sole means of vindicating the constitu\ntional right to be free from gender discrimination perpe\ntrated by educational institutions.” 504 F. 3d, at 179.\n   Title IX reaches institutions and programs that receive\nfederal funds, 20 U. S. C. §1681(a), which may include\nnonpublic institutions, §1681(c), but it has consistently\nbeen interpreted as not authorizing suit against school\nofficials, teachers, and other individuals, see, e.g., Hartley\n10      FITZGERALD v. BARNSTABLE SCHOOL COMM.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nv. Parnell, 193 F. 3d 1263, 1270 (CA11 1999). The Equal\nProtection Clause reaches only state actors, but §1983\nequal protection claims may be brought against individu\nals as well as municipalities and certain other state enti\nties. West v. Atkins, 487 U. S. 42, 48–51 (1988).\n   Title IX exempts from its restrictions several activities\nthat may be challenged on constitutional grounds. For\nexample, Title IX exempts elementary and secondary\nschools from its prohibition against discrimination in\nadmissions, §1681(a)(1); it exempts military service\nschools and traditionally single-sex public colleges from all\nof its provisions, §§1681(a)(4)–(5). Some exempted activi\nties may form the basis of equal protection claims. See\nUnited States v. Virginia, 518 U. S. 515, 534 (1996) (men\nonly admissions policy at Virginia Military Institute vio\nlated the Equal Protection Clause); Mississippi Univ. for\nWomen v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 731 (1982) (women-only\nadmission policy at a traditionally single-sex public college\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause).\n   Even where particular activities and particular defen\ndants are subject to both Title IX and the Equal Protection\nClause, the standards for establishing liability may not be\nwholly congruent. For example, a Title IX plaintiff can\nestablish school district liability by showing that a single\nschool administrator with authority to take corrective\naction responded to harassment with deliberate indiffer\nence. Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School Dist., 524\nU. S. 274, 290 (1998). A plaintiff stating a similar claim\nvia §1983 for violation of the Equal Protection Clause by a\nschool district or other municipal entity must show that\nthe harassment was the result of municipal custom, policy,\nor practice. Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social\nServs., 436 U. S. 658, 694 (1978).\n   In light of the divergent coverage of Title IX and the\nEqual Protection Clause, as well as the absence of a com\nprehensive remedial scheme comparable to those at issue\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin Sea Clammers, Smith, and Rancho Palos Verdes, we\nconclude that Title IX was not meant to be an exclusive\nmechanism for addressing gender discrimination in\nschools, or a substitute for §1983 suits as a means of en\nforcing constitutional rights. Accordingly, we hold that\n§1983 suits based on the Equal Protection Clause remain\navailable to plaintiffs alleging unconstitutional gender\ndiscrimination in schools.\n                              3\n   This conclusion is consistent with Title IX’s context and\nhistory. In enacting Title IX, Congress amended §902, 78\nStat. 266–267, 42 U. S. C. §2000h–2 to authorize the\nAttorney General to intervene in private suits alleging\ndiscrimination on the basis of sex in violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause. See §906, 86 Stat. 375 (adding the\nterm “sex” to the listed grounds, which already included\nrace, color, religion or national origin). Accordingly, it\nappears that the Congress that enacted Title IX explicitly\nenvisioned that private plaintiffs would bring constitu\ntional claims to challenge gender discrimination; it must\nhave recognized that plaintiffs would do so via 42 U. S. C.\n§1983.\n   Moreover, Congress modeled Title IX after Title VI of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, Cannon, 441 U. S., at 694–\n695, and passed Title IX with the explicit understanding\nthat it would be interpreted as Title VI was, id., at 696.\nAt the time of Title IX’s enactment in 1972, Title VI was\nroutinely interpreted to allow for parallel and concurrent\n§1983 claims, see, e.g., Alvarado v. El Paso Independent\nSchool Dist., 445 F. 2d 1011 (CA5 1971); Nashville I–40\nSteering Comm. v. Ellington, 387 F. 2d 179 (CA6 1967);\nBossier Parish School Bd. v. Lemon, 370 F. 2d 847 (CA5\n1967), and we presume Congress was aware of this when\nit passed Title IX, see Franklin, 503 U. S., at 71 (in assess\ning Congress’ intent, “we evaluate the state of the law\n12        FITZGERALD v. BARNSTABLE SCHOOL COMM.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen the Legislature passed Title IX”). In the absence of\nany contrary evidence, it follows that Congress intended\nTitle IX to be interpreted similarly to allow for parallel\nand concurrent §1983 claims. At the least, this indicates\nthat Congress did not affirmatively intend Title IX to\npreclude such claims.2\n                            III\n   One matter remains. Respondents contend that the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed on\nindependent grounds—namely, that the Fitzgeralds have\nno actionable §1983 claim on which to proceed. They\ncontend that the Court of Appeals’ holding that neither\nthe school committee nor Dever acted with deliberate\nindifference is conclusive and forecloses a §1983 constitu\ntional claim based on a similar theory of liability. They\ncontend that all other §1983 constitutional claims on these\nfacts are precluded by the Fitzgeralds’ failure to allege\nsuch claims adequately or to preserve them on appeal.\n   The Fitzgeralds respond that they have no intention of\nrelitigating the issue of deliberate indifference. They\nintend, they say, to advance claims of discriminatory\n——————\n  2 Respondents argue that constitutional protections against gender\n\ndiscrimination were minimal in 1972, as the only gender-based equal\nprotection case this Court had decided employed a rational basis\nstandard. Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71, 76 (1971). But see Gunther, In\nSearch of Evolving Doctrine on a Changing Court: A Model for Newer\nEqual Protection, 86 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 34 (1972) (Reed exemplified the\napplication of rationality review “with bite”). They further argue that\nbecause Congress could not have viewed the Equal Protection Clause as\noffering a meaningful remedy for sex discrimination by schools, it could\nnot have envisioned and intended for Title IX and §1983 constitutional\nclaims to proceed side by side. But the relevant question is not whether\nCongress envisioned that the two types of claims would proceed to\ngether in addressing gender discrimination in schools; it is whether\nCongress affirmatively intended to preclude this result. The limited\nnature of constitutional protections against gender discrimination in\n1972 offers no evidence that Congress did.\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

Ordinarily, “we do not decide in the\nfirst instance issues not decided below,” National Colle\ngiate Athletic Assn. v. Smith, 525 U.

Argued December 2, 2008—Decided January 21, 2009\nPetitioners filed suit against respondents, the local school district’s\n  governing board and superintendent, alleging that their response to\n  allegations of sexual harassment of petitioners’ daughter by an older\n  student was inadequate, raising claims under, inter alia, Title IX of\n  the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U. S. C. §1681(a), and 42\n  U. S. C. §1983 for violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the\n  Fourteenth Amendment. Among its rulings, the District Court dis\n  missed the §1983 claim. The First Circuit affirmed, holding that,\n  under this Court’s precedents, Title IX’s implied private remedy was\n  sufficiently comprehensive to preclude the use of §1983 to advance\n  constitutional claims.\nHeld:\n    1. Title IX does not preclude a §1983 action alleging unconstitu\n tional gender discrimination in schools. Pp. 4–12.\n       (a) In Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea\n Clammers Assn., 453 U. S. 1; Smith v. Robinson, 468 U. S. 992; and\n Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U. S. 113, this Court found that\n particular statutory enactments precluded §1983 claims where it was\n established that Congress intended the statute’s remedial scheme to\n “be the exclusive avenue through which a plaintiff may assert [such]\n claims,” Smith, supra, at 1009. In determining whether Congress in\n tended for a subsequent statute to preclude the enforcement of a fed\n eral right under §1983, the Court has placed primary emphasis on\n the nature and extent of that statute’s remedial scheme. See Sea\n Clammers, 453 U. S., at 20. Where the §1983 claim alleges a consti\n tutional violation, a lack of congressional intent to preclude may also\n be inferred from a comparison of the rights and protections of the\n2           FITZGERALD v. BARNSTABLE SCHOOL COMM.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    other statute and those existing under the Constitution. Pp. 4–7.\n         (b) In the absence of a comprehensive remedial scheme compara\n    ble to those at issue in Sea Clammers, Smith, and Rancho Palos\n    Verdes, and in light of the divergent coverage of Title IX and the\n    Equal Protection Clause, it must be concluded that Title IX was not\n    meant to be an exclusive mechanism for addressing gender discrimi\n    nation in schools, or a substitute for §1983 suits as a means of enforc\n    ing constitutional rights. Pp. 7–12.\n           (i) Title IX’s only express enforcement mechanism, 20 U. S. C.\n    §1682, is an administrative procedure resulting in the withdrawal of\n    federal funding from noncompliant institutions. This Court has also\n    recognized an implied private right of action, Cannon v. University of\n    Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 717, for which both injunctive relief and\n    damages are available, Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools,\n    503 U. S. 60, 76. These remedies stand in stark contrast to the “un\n    usually elaborate,” “carefully tailored,” and “restrictive” enforcement\n    schemes of the statutes in Sea Clammers, Smith, and Rancho Palos\n    Verdes. Unlike those statutes, Title IX has no administrative ex\n    haustion requirement and no notice provisions. Plaintiffs can file di\n    rectly in court under its implied private right of action and can obtain\n    the full range of remedies. Accordingly, parallel and concurrent\n    §1983 claims will neither circumvent required procedures nor allow\n    access to new remedies. Moreover, under Rancho Palos Verdes, “[t]he\n    provision of an express, private means of redress in the statute itself”\n    is a key consideration in determining congressional intent, and “the\n    existence of a more restrictive private remedy for statutory violations\n    has been the dividing line between those cases in which . . . an action\n    would lie under §1983 and those in which we have held that it would\n    not.” 544 U. S., at 121. Title IX contains no express private remedy,\n    much less a more restrictive one. Pp. 7–9.\n           (ii) Because Title IX’s protections are narrower in some re\n    spects and broader in others than those guaranteed under the Equal\n    Protection Clause, the Court cannot agree with the First Circuit that\n    Congress saw Title IX as the sole means of correcting unconstitu\n    tional gender discrimination in schools. Title IX reaches institutions\n    and programs that receive federal funds, 20 U. S. C. §1681(a), which\n    may include nonpublic institutions, §1681(c), but it has consistently\n    been interpreted as not authorizing suit against school officials,\n    teachers, and other individuals. Moreover, while the constitutional\n    provision reaches only state actors, §1983 equal protection claims\n    may be brought against individuals as well as state entities. West v.\n    Atkins, 487 U. S. 42, 48–51. And Title IX exempts from its restric\n    tions several activities that may be challenged on constitutional\n    grounds. See, e.g., §1681(a)(5). Even where particular activities and\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  particular defendants are subject to both Title IX and the Equal Pro\n  tection Clause, the standards for establishing liability may not be\n  wholly congruent. Compare Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School\n  Dist., 524 U. S. 274, 290, with Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social\n  Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 694. Pp. 9–11.\n         (iii) The Court’s conclusion is consistent with Title IX’s context\n  and history. Because the Congress that enacted Title IX authorized\n  the Attorney General to intervene in private suits alleging sex dis\n  crimination violative of the Equal Protection Clause, 42 U. S. C.\n  §2000h–2, Congress must have explicitly envisioned that private\n  plaintiffs would bring constitutional claims to challenge gender dis\n  crimination via §1983. Moreover, Title IX was modeled after Title VI\n  of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Cannon, supra, at 694–695, and, at\n  the time of Title IX’s 1972 enactment, the lower courts routinely in\n  terpreted Title VI to allow for parallel and concurrent §1983 claims.\n  Absent contrary evidence, it follows that Congress intended Title IX\n  to be interpreted similarly to allow for parallel and concurrent §1983\n  claims. Pp. 11–12.\n    2.

S. C. §1681(a), precludes an action\nunder Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983, alleging uncon\nstitutional gender discrimination in schools. The Court of\nAppeals for the First Circuit held that it does. 504 F. 3d\n165 (2007). We reverse.\n                              I\n   Because this case comes to us on a motion to dismiss\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), we assume\nthe truth of the facts as alleged in petitioners’ complaint.\nDuring the 2000–2001 school year, the daughter of peti\ntioners Lisa and Robert Fitzgerald was a kindergarten\nstudent in the Barnstable, Massachusetts, school system,\nand rode the bus to school each morning. One day she told\nher parents that, whenever she wore a dress, a third-grade\nboy on the school bus would bully her into lifting her skirt.\nLisa Fitzgerald immediately called the school principal,\nFrederick Scully, who arranged a meeting later that day\nwith the Fitzgeralds, their daughter, and another school\n2       FITZGERALD v. BARNSTABLE SCHOOL COMM.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nofficial, Lynda Day. Scully and Day then questioned the\nalleged bully, who denied the allegations. Day also inter\nviewed the bus driver and several students who rode the\nbus. She concluded that she could not corroborate the\ngirl’s version of the events.\n   The Fitzgeralds’ daughter then provided new details of\nthe alleged abuse to her parents, who relayed them to\nScully. Specifically, she told her parents that in addition\nto bullying her into raising her skirt, the boy coerced her\ninto pulling down her underpants and spreading her legs.\nScully scheduled a second meeting with the Fitzgeralds to\ndiscuss the additional details and again questioned the\nboy and other students.\n   Meanwhile, the local police department conducted an\nindependent investigation and concluded there was insuf\nficient evidence to bring criminal charges against the boy.\nBased partly on the police investigation and partly on the\nschool’s own investigation, Scully similarly concluded\nthere was insufficient evidence to warrant discipline.\nScully did propose remedial measures to the Fitzgeralds.\nHe suggested transferring their daughter to a different\nbus or leaving rows of empty seats between the kinder\ngarteners and older students on the original bus. The\nFitzgeralds felt that these proposals punished their\ndaughter instead of the boy and countered with alterna\ntive proposals. They suggested transferring the boy to a\ndifferent bus or placing a monitor on the original bus. The\nBarnstable school system’s superintendent, Russell Dever,\ndid not act on these proposals.\n   The Fitzgeralds began driving their daughter to school\nto avoid further bullying on the bus, but she continued to\nreport unsettling incidents at school. The Fitzgeralds\nreported each incident to Scully. The Fitzgeralds’ daugh\nter had an unusual number of absences during the re\nmainder of the school year.\n   In April 2002, the Fitzgeralds filed suit in District\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt, alleging that the school system’s response to their\nallegations of sexual harassment had been inadequate,\nresulting in further harassment to their daughter. Their\ncomplaint included: (1) a claim for violation of Title IX\nagainst the Barnstable School Committee (the school\nsystem’s governing body), (2) claims under 42 U. S. C.\n§1983 for violations of Title IX and the Equal Protection\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment against the school\ncommittee and Dever, and (3) Massachusetts state-law\nclaims against the school committee and Dever. The\nschool committee and Dever (respondents here), filed a\nmotion to dismiss, which the District Court granted as to\nthe §1983 claims and the state-law claims. On the Title\nIX claim, the school committee filed a motion for summary\njudgment, which the District Court also granted. Hunter\nv. Barnstable School Committee, 456 F. Supp. 2d 255, 266\n(Mass. 2006).\n   The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed. 504\nF. 3d 165. Turning first to the Title IX claim against the\nschool committee, the court noted three points that were\nnot in dispute: (1) the school committee was the recipient\nof federal funds and was therefore subject to Title IX, (2)\nthe school committee had actual knowledge of the harass\nment the Fitzgeralds’ daughter suffered, and (3) if the\nallegations of the complaint were true, the harassment\nwas “severe, pervasive and objectively offensive.” Id., at\n172. The court concluded that the Fitzgeralds’ Title IX\nclaim lacked merit, however, because the response of the\nschool committee and Dever to the reported harassment\nhad been objectively reasonable. Id., at 175.\n   The Court of Appeals turned next to the Fitzgeralds’\n§1983 claims. Relying on this Court’s precedents in Mid\ndlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clam\nmers Assn., 453 U. S. 1 (1981), Smith v. Robinson, 468\nU. S. 992 (1984), and Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544\nU. S. 113 (2005), the court characterized Title IX’s implied\n4         FITZGERALD v. BARNSTABLE SCHOOL COMM.\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nprivate remedy as “sufficiently comprehensive” to preclude\nuse of §1983 to advance statutory claims based on Title IX\nitself. 504 F. 3d, at 179. This reasoning, the court held,\n“appl[ied] with equal force” to the constitutional claims.\nIbid. The court concluded that “Congress saw Title IX as\nthe sole means of vindicating the constitutional right to be\nfree from gender discrimination perpetrated by educa\ntional institutions.” Ibid.\n   The Court of Appeals’ decision deepened a conflict\namong the Circuits regarding whether Title IX precludes\nuse of §1983 to redress unconstitutional gender discrimi\nnation in schools.

C. §1983, provides: \n\n         “Every person who, under color of any statute, ordi\n      nance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or\n      Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or\n      causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United\n      States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof\n      to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immu\n      nities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be\n      liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in\n      equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.”\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nIn three cases, this Court has found that statutory enact\nments precluded claims under this statute. Sea Clam\nmers, supra; Smith, supra; Rancho Palos Verdes, supra.\nThese cases establish that “[t]he crucial consideration is\nwhat Congress intended.” Smith, 468 U. S., at 1012. If\nCongress intended a statute’s remedial scheme to “be the\nexclusive avenue through which a plaintiff may assert\n[the] claim,” id., at 1009, the §1983 claims are precluded.\nSee Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U. S., at 120–121 (“The\ncritical question, then, is whether Congress meant the\njudicial remedy authorized by [the statute] to coexist with\nan alternative remedy available in a §1983 action”).\n   In those cases in which the §1983 claim is based on a\nstatutory right, “evidence of such congressional intent may\nbe found directly in the statute creating the right, or\ninferred from the statute’s creation of a comprehensive\nenforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual\nenforcement under §1983.” Id., at 120 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In cases in which the §1983 claim alleges\na constitutional violation, lack of congressional intent may\nbe inferred from a comparison of the rights and protec\ntions of the statute and those existing under the Constitu\ntion. Where the contours of such rights and protections\ndiverge in significant ways, it is not likely that Congress\nintended to displace §1983 suits enforcing constitutional\nrights. Our conclusions regarding congressional intent\ncan be confirmed by a statute’s context. Id., at 127\n(BREYER, J., concurring) (“[C]ontext, not just literal text,\nwill often lead a court to Congress’ intent in respect to a\nparticular statute”).\n   In determining whether a subsequent statute precludes\nthe enforcement of a federal right under §1983, we have\nplaced primary emphasis on the nature and extent of that\nstatute’s remedial scheme. See Sea Clammers, supra, at\n20 (“When the remedial devices provided in a particular\nAct are sufficiently comprehensive, they may suffice to\n6       FITZGERALD v. BARNSTABLE SCHOOL COMM.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndemonstrate congressional intent to preclude the remedy\nof suits under §1983”).\n   Sea Clammers illustrates this approach. The plaintiffs\nbrought suit under §1983 for violations of the Federal\nWater Pollution Control Act and the Marine Protection,\nResearch, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972. This Court’s\nanalysis focused on these two statutes’ “unusually elabo\nrate enforcement provisions,” which authorized the Envi\nronmental Protection Agency to seek civil and criminal\npenalties for violations, permitted “ ‘any interested per\nson’ ” to seek judicial review, and contained detailed citi\nzen suit provisions allowing for injunctive relief. 453\nU. S., at 13–14. Allowing parallel §1983 claims to proceed,\nwe concluded, would have thwarted Congress’ intent in\nformulating and detailing these provisions.\n   In Smith, the plaintiffs alleged deprivation of a free,\nappropriate public education for their handicapped child,\nin violation of the Education of the Handicapped Act\n(EHA) and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses\nof the Fourteenth Amendment. Departing from the pat\ntern of the plaintiffs in Sea Clammers, the Smith plaintiffs\nrelied on §1983 to assert independent constitutional\nrights, not to assert the statutory rights guaranteed by the\nEHA. As in Sea Clammers, however, this Court focused\non the statute’s detailed remedial scheme in concluding\nthat Congress intended the statute to provide the sole\navenue for relief. Smith, 468 U. S., at 1011 (noting “the\ncomprehensive nature of the procedures and guarantees\nset out in the [the statute] and Congress’ express efforts to\nplace on local and state educational agencies the primary\nresponsibility for developing a plan to accommodate the\nneeds of each individual handicapped child”).\n   In Rancho Palos Verdes, we again focused on a statute’s\nremedial scheme in inferring congressional intent for\nexclusivity. After being denied a permit to build a radio\ntower on his property, the plaintiff brought claims for\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ninjunctive relief under the Telecommunications Act of\n1996 (TCA) and for damages and attorney’s fees under\n§1983. Noting that the TCA provides highly detailed and\nrestrictive administrative and judicial remedies, and\nexplaining that “limitations upon the remedy contained in\nthe statute are deliberate and are not to be evaded\nthrough §1983,” we again concluded that Congress must\nhave intended the statutory remedies to be exclusive. 544\nU. S., at 124.\n   In all three cases, the statutes at issue required plain\ntiffs to comply with particular procedures and/or to ex\nhaust particular administrative remedies prior to filing\nsuit. Sea Clammers, supra, at 6; Smith, supra, at 1011–\n1012; Rancho Palos Verdes, supra, at 122. Offering plain\ntiffs a direct route to court via §1983 would have circum\nvented these procedures and given plaintiffs access to\ntangible benefits—such as damages, attorney’s fees, and\ncosts—that were unavailable under the statutes.1 “Allow\ning a plaintiff to circumvent” the statutes’ provisions in\nthis way would have been “inconsistent with Congress’\ncarefully tailored scheme.” Smith, supra, at 1012.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  1 The statutes at issue in Sea Clammers and Smith did not allow for\n\ndamages. The statute at issue in Rancho Palos Verdes did not ex\npressly allow for damages, but some lower courts interpreted it to do so.\nThe statutes at issue in Smith and Rancho Palos Verdes did not allow\nfor attorney’s fees and costs. See Sea Clammers, 453 U. S., at 6–7, 13–\n14 (addressing the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 86 Stat. 816,\nas amended, 33 U. S. C. §1251 et seq., and the Marine Protection,\nResearch, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 1052, as amended, 33\nU. S. C. §1401 et seq.); Smith, 468 U. S., at 1010–1011 (addressing the\nEducation of the Handicapped Act, 84 Stat. 175, as amended, 20\nU. S. C. §1400 et seq.); Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U. S., at 122–123, and\nnn. 3, 4 (addressing the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 56,\n47 U. S. C. §332(c)(7)).\n8         FITZGERALD v. BARNSTABLE SCHOOL COMM.\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n                                B\n                                1\n    Section 901(a) of Title IX provides:\n      “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of\n      sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the\n      benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under\n      any education program or activity receiving Federal\n      financial assistance.” 20 U. S. C. §1681(a).\nThe statute’s only express enforcement mechanism, §1682,\nis an administrative procedure resulting in the with\ndrawal of federal funding from institutions that are not in\ncompliance. In addition, this Court has recognized an\nimplied private right of action. Cannon v. University of\nChicago, 441 U. S. 677, 717 (1979). In a suit brought\npursuant to this private right, both injunctive relief and\ndamages are available. Franklin v. Gwinnett County\nPublic Schools, 503 U. S. 60, 76 (1992).\n   These remedies—withdrawal of federal funds and an\nimplied cause of action—stand in stark contrast to the\n“unusually elaborate,” “carefully tailored,” and “restric\ntive” enforcement schemes of the statutes at issue in Sea\nClammers, Smith, and Rancho Palos Verdes. Unlike those\nstatutes, Title IX has no administrative exhaustion re\nquirement and no notice provisions. Under its implied\nprivate right of action, plaintiffs can file directly in court,\nCannon, supra, at 717, and can obtain the full range of\nremedies, see Franklin, supra, at 72 (concluding that\n“Congress did not intend to limit the remedies available in\na suit brought under Title IX”). As a result, parallel and\nconcurrent §1983 claims will neither circumvent required\nprocedures, nor allow access to new remedies.\n   Moreover, this Court explained in Rancho Palos Verdes\nthat “[t]he provision of an express, private means of re\ndress in the statute itself” is a key consideration in deter\nmining congressional intent, and that “the existence of a\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmore restrictive private remedy for statutory violations\nhas been the dividing line between those cases in which\nwe have held that an action would lie under §1983 and\nthose in which we have held that it would not.” 544 U. S.,\nat 121 (emphasis added). As noted, Title IX contains no\nexpress private remedy, much less a more restrictive one.\nThis Court has never held that an implied right of action\nhad the effect of precluding suit under §1983, likely be\ncause of the difficulty of discerning congressional intent in\nsuch a situation. See Franklin, supra, at 76 (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (“Quite obviously, the search for\nwhat was Congress’ remedial intent as to a right whose\nvery existence Congress did not expressly acknowledge is\nunlikely to succeed”). Mindful that we should “not lightly\nconclude that Congress intended to preclude reliance on\n§1983 as a remedy for a substantial equal protection\nclaim,” Smith, 468 U. S., at 1012, we see no basis for doing\nso here.\n                              2\n   A comparison of the substantive rights and protections\nguaranteed under Title IX and under the Equal Protection\nClause lends further support to the conclusion that Con\ngress did not intend Title IX to preclude §1983 constitu\ntional suits. Title IX’s protections are narrower in some\nrespects and broader in others. Because the protections\nguaranteed by the two sources of law diverge in this way,\nwe cannot agree with the Court of Appeals that “Congress\nsaw Title IX as the sole means of vindicating the constitu\ntional right to be free from gender discrimination perpe\ntrated by educational institutions.” 504 F. 3d, at 179.\n   Title IX reaches institutions and programs that receive\nfederal funds, 20 U. S. C. §1681(a), which may include\nnonpublic institutions, §1681(c), but it has consistently\nbeen interpreted as not authorizing suit against school\nofficials, teachers, and other individuals, see, e.g., Hartley\n10      FITZGERALD v. BARNSTABLE SCHOOL COMM.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nv. Parnell, 193 F. 3d 1263, 1270 (CA11 1999). The Equal\nProtection Clause reaches only state actors, but §1983\nequal protection claims may be brought against individu\nals as well as municipalities and certain other state enti\nties. West v. Atkins, 487 U. S. 42, 48–51 (1988).\n   Title IX exempts from its restrictions several activities\nthat may be challenged on constitutional grounds. For\nexample, Title IX exempts elementary and secondary\nschools from its prohibition against discrimination in\nadmissions, §1681(a)(1); it exempts military service\nschools and traditionally single-sex public colleges from all\nof its provisions, §§1681(a)(4)–(5). Some exempted activi\nties may form the basis of equal protection claims. See\nUnited States v. Virginia, 518 U. S. 515, 534 (1996) (men\nonly admissions policy at Virginia Military Institute vio\nlated the Equal Protection Clause); Mississippi Univ. for\nWomen v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 731 (1982) (women-only\nadmission policy at a traditionally single-sex public college\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause).\n   Even where particular activities and particular defen\ndants are subject to both Title IX and the Equal Protection\nClause, the standards for establishing liability may not be\nwholly congruent. For example, a Title IX plaintiff can\nestablish school district liability by showing that a single\nschool administrator with authority to take corrective\naction responded to harassment with deliberate indiffer\nence. Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School Dist., 524\nU. S. 274, 290 (1998). A plaintiff stating a similar claim\nvia §1983 for violation of the Equal Protection Clause by a\nschool district or other municipal entity must show that\nthe harassment was the result of municipal custom, policy,\nor practice. Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social\nServs., 436 U. S. 658, 694 (1978).\n   In light of the divergent coverage of Title IX and the\nEqual Protection Clause, as well as the absence of a com\nprehensive remedial scheme comparable to those at issue\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin Sea Clammers, Smith, and Rancho Palos Verdes, we\nconclude that Title IX was not meant to be an exclusive\nmechanism for addressing gender discrimination in\nschools, or a substitute for §1983 suits as a means of en\nforcing constitutional rights. Accordingly, we hold that\n§1983 suits based on the Equal Protection Clause remain\navailable to plaintiffs alleging unconstitutional gender\ndiscrimination in schools.\n                              3\n   This conclusion is consistent with Title IX’s context and\nhistory. In enacting Title IX, Congress amended §902, 78\nStat. 266–267, 42 U. S. C. §2000h–2 to authorize the\nAttorney General to intervene in private suits alleging\ndiscrimination on the basis of sex in violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause. See §906, 86 Stat. 375 (adding the\nterm “sex” to the listed grounds, which already included\nrace, color, religion or national origin). Accordingly, it\nappears that the Congress that enacted Title IX explicitly\nenvisioned that private plaintiffs would bring constitu\ntional claims to challenge gender discrimination; it must\nhave recognized that plaintiffs would do so via 42 U. S. C.\n§1983.\n   Moreover, Congress modeled Title IX after Title VI of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, Cannon, 441 U. S., at 694–\n695, and passed Title IX with the explicit understanding\nthat it would be interpreted as Title VI was, id., at 696.\nAt the time of Title IX’s enactment in 1972, Title VI was\nroutinely interpreted to allow for parallel and concurrent\n§1983 claims, see, e.g., Alvarado v. El Paso Independent\nSchool Dist., 445 F. 2d 1011 (CA5 1971); Nashville I–40\nSteering Comm. v. Ellington, 387 F. 2d 179 (CA6 1967);\nBossier Parish School Bd. v. Lemon, 370 F. 2d 847 (CA5\n1967), and we presume Congress was aware of this when\nit passed Title IX, see Franklin, 503 U. S., at 71 (in assess\ning Congress’ intent, “we evaluate the state of the law\n12        FITZGERALD v. BARNSTABLE SCHOOL COMM.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen the Legislature passed Title IX”). In the absence of\nany contrary evidence, it follows that Congress intended\nTitle IX to be interpreted similarly to allow for parallel\nand concurrent §1983 claims. At the least, this indicates\nthat Congress did not affirmatively intend Title IX to\npreclude such claims.2\n                            III\n   One matter remains. Respondents contend that the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed on\nindependent grounds—namely, that the Fitzgeralds have\nno actionable §1983 claim on which to proceed. They\ncontend that the Court of Appeals’ holding that neither\nthe school committee nor Dever acted with deliberate\nindifference is conclusive and forecloses a §1983 constitu\ntional claim based on a similar theory of liability. They\ncontend that all other §1983 constitutional claims on these\nfacts are precluded by the Fitzgeralds’ failure to allege\nsuch claims adequately or to preserve them on appeal.\n   The Fitzgeralds respond that they have no intention of\nrelitigating the issue of deliberate indifference. They\nintend, they say, to advance claims of discriminatory\n——————\n  2 Respondents argue that constitutional protections against gender\n\ndiscrimination were minimal in 1972, as the only gender-based equal\nprotection case this Court had decided employed a rational basis\nstandard. Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71, 76 (1971). But see Gunther, In\nSearch of Evolving Doctrine on a Changing Court: A Model for Newer\nEqual Protection, 86 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 34 (1972) (Reed exemplified the\napplication of rationality review “with bite”). They further argue that\nbecause Congress could not have viewed the Equal Protection Clause as\noffering a meaningful remedy for sex discrimination by schools, it could\nnot have envisioned and intended for Title IX and §1983 constitutional\nclaims to proceed side by side. But the relevant question is not whether\nCongress envisioned that the two types of claims would proceed to\ngether in addressing gender discrimination in schools; it is whether\nCongress affirmatively intended to preclude this result. The limited\nnature of constitutional protections against gender discrimination in\n1972 offers no evidence that Congress did.\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

Ordinarily, “we do not decide in the\nfirst instance issues not decided below,” National Colle\ngiate Athletic Assn. v. Smith, 525 U.
