Conkright, Administrator of the Xerox Corpora\ntion Pension Plan, et al., have reapplied for a stay of the\nmandate of the United States Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit. In their initial application, filed October\n16, 2008, the applicants sought a stay pending the filing\nand disposition of their petition for certiorari. The Second\nCircuit’s decision in their case, 535 F. 3d 111 (2008), they\nasserted, was erroneous, created a Circuit conflict, and\nwould cause irreparable harm if given effect. Without a\nstay, the applicants explained, they would be required to\nmake additional payments to dozens of pension plan bene\nficiaries—money that could prove difficult to recoup if this\nCourt were to grant certiorari and rule in their favor.\n   Acting in my capacity as Circuit Justice, I denied the\nstay application on October 20, 2008. Denial of such in\nchambers stay applications is the norm; relief is granted\nonly in “extraordinary cases.” Rostker v. Goldberg, 448\nU. S. 1306, 1308 (1980) (Brennan, J., in chambers). Spe\ncifically, the applicant must demonstrate (1) “a ‘reasonable\nprobability’ that four Justices will consider the issue suffi\nciently meritorious to grant certiorari or to note probable\n2                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     Opinion in Chambers\n\njurisdiction”; (2) “a fair prospect that a majority of the\nCourt will conclude that the decision below was errone\nous”; and (3) a likelihood that “irreparable harm [will]\nresult from the denial of a stay.” Ibid. In addition, “in a\nclose case it may be appropriate to ‘balance the equities’—\nto explore the relative harms to applicant and respondent,\nas well as the interests of the public at large.” Ibid. I\nearlier determined, taking account of the Second Circuit’s\nevaluation, that this case did not meet the above-stated\ncriteria.\n   The applicants seek reconsideration based on a change\nin circumstances. Specifically, after I denied their initial\napplication, the applicants filed their petition for certio\nrari, and, on March 2, 2009, the Court called for the views\nof the Solicitor General (CVSG). The Solicitor General has\nyet to respond. According to the applicants, a stay is now\nin order because the Court’s invitation to the Solicitor\nGeneral—a step taken in only a small fraction of cases—\nestablishes a “reasonable probability” that certiorari will\nbe granted.\n   Our request for the Solicitor General’s view, although\nrelevant to the “reasonable probability” analysis, is hardly\ndispositive of an application to block implementation of a\nCourt of Appeals’ judgment. CVSG’d petitions, it is true,\nare granted at a far higher rate than other petitions. But\nit is also true that the Court denies certiorari in such cases\nmore often than not. Consideration of the guiding criteria\nin the context of the particular case remains appropriate.\n   A “reasonable probability” of a grant is only one of the\nhurdles an applicant must clear. Relief is not warranted\nunless the other factors also counsel in favor of a stay.\nThe Court’s invitation to the Solicitor General does not\nlead me to depart from my previous assessment of those\nfactors. With respect to irreparable harm, the applicants\nurge that, should they prevail in this Court, they may\nhave trouble recouping any funds they disburse to benefi\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

But they do not establish that recoupment will be\nimpossible; nor do they suggest that the outlays at issue\nwill place the plan itself in jeopardy. Cf. Sampson v.\nMurray, 415 U.
