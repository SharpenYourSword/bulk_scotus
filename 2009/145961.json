Decided August 17, 2009\n\n   The motion of NAACP, et al. for leave to file a brief as\namici curiae is granted. The motion of Bob Barr, et al. for\nleave to file a brief as amici curiae is granted. The peti\ntion for a writ of habeas corpus is transferred to the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of\nGeorgia for hearing and determination. The District\nCourt should receive testimony and make findings of fact\nas to whether evidence that could not have been obtained\nat the time of trial clearly establishes petitioner’s inno\ncence. JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR took no part in the considera\ntion or decision of these motions and this petition.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG and\nJUSTICE BREYER join, concurring.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA’s dissent is wrong in two respects.\nFirst, he assumes as a matter of fact that petitioner Davis\nis guilty of the murder of Officer MacPhail. He does this\neven though seven of the State’s key witnesses have re\ncanted their trial testimony; several individuals have\nimplicated the State’s principal witness as the shooter;\nand “no court,” state or federal, “has ever conducted a\nhearing to assess the reliability of the score of [postconvic\ntion] affidavits that, if reliable, would satisfy the threshold\nshowing for a truly persuasive demonstration of actual\ninnocence,” 565 F. 3d 810, 827 (CA11 2009) (Barkett, J.,\ndissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted). The sub\nstantial risk of putting an innocent man to death clearly\nprovides an adequate justification for holding an eviden\ntiary hearing. Simply put, the case is sufficiently “excep\ntional” to warrant utilization of this Court’s Rule 20.4(a),\n2                        IN RE DAVIS\n\n                     STEVENS, J., concurring\n\n28 U. S. C. §2241(b), and our original habeas jurisdiction.\nSee Byrnes v. Walker, 371 U. S. 937 (1962); Chaapel v.\nCochran, 369 U. S. 869 (1962).\n   Second, JUSTICE SCALIA assumes as a matter of law\nthat, “[e]ven if the District Court were to be persuaded by\nDavis’s affidavits, it would have no power to grant relief”\nin light of 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). Post, at 2. For several\nreasons, however, this transfer is by no means “a fool’s\nerrand.” Post, at 5. The District Court may conclude that\n§2254(d)(1) does not apply, or does not apply with the\nsame rigidity, to an original habeas petition such as this.\nSee Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 663 (1996) (expressly\nleaving open the question whether and to what extent the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA) applies to original petitions). The court may also\nfind it relevant to the AEDPA analysis that Davis is bring\ning an “actual innocence” claim. See, e.g., Triestman v.\nUnited States, 124 F. 3d 361, 377–380 (CA2 1997) (dis\ncussing “serious” constitutional concerns that would arise\nif AEDPA were interpreted to bar judicial review of cer\ntain actual innocence claims); Pet. for Writ of Habeas\nCorpus 20–22 (arguing that Congress intended actual\ninnocence claims to have special status under AEDPA).\nEven if the court finds that §2254(d)(1) applies in full, it is\narguably unconstitutional to the extent it bars relief for a\ndeath row inmate who has established his innocence.\nAlternatively, the court may find in such a case that the\nstatute’s text is satisfied, because decisions of this Court\nclearly support the proposition that it “would be an atro\ncious violation of our Constitution and the principles upon\nwhich it is based” to execute an innocent person. 565\nF. 3d, at 830 (Barkett, J., dissenting); cf. Teague v. Lane,\n489 U. S. 288, 311–313 (1989) (plurality opinion).\n   JUSTICE SCALIA would pretermit all of these unresolved\nlegal questions on the theory that we must treat even the\nmost robust showing of actual innocence identically on\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

But imagine a petitioner in Davis’s situation who\npossesses new evidence conclusively and definitively prov\ning, beyond any scintilla of doubt, that he is an innocent\nman. The dissent’s reasoning would allow such a peti\ntioner to be put to death nonetheless.
