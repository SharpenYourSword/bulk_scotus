The Court took this test from\nJUSTICE SCALIA’s separate opinion in Thornton v. United\nStates, 541 U. S. 615, 632 (2004) (opinion concurring in\njudgment), but did not provide an independent explana\ntion of the basis for or the scope of this rule. As I observed\nin dissent, Gant, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 10), this test\ncreates a host of uncertainties, and this case illustrates\njust one of the problems.\n   Here, petitioner, a vehicle occupant, was arrested on a\nwarrant for threatening to kill his wife in violation of N.
