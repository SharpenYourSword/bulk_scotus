See post, at 1. But framing the issue in\nthis way obscures the central question. The issue is not\nwhether a death-row inmate’s appeals “waive” any Eighth\nAmendment right; the issue instead is whether the death\nrow inmate’s litigation strategy, which delays his execu\ntion, provides a justification for the Court to invent a new\nEighth Amendment right. It does not. See Knight, supra,\nat 992 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (“Consistency would seem\nto demand that those who accept our death penalty juris\nprudence as a given also accept the lengthy delay between\nsentencing and execution as a necessary consequence. . . .\nIt is incongruous to arm capital defendants with an arse\nnal of ‘constitutional’ claims with which they may delay\ntheir executions, and simultaneously to complain when\nexecutions are inevitably delayed”).\n   I also disagree with JUSTICE STEVENS that other aspects\nof the criminal justice system in this country require the\nfresh examination of the costs and benefits of retaining\nthe death penalty that he seeks. Ante, at 2–3. For exam\nple, JUSTICE STEVENS criticizes the “dehumanizing effects”\nof the manner in which petitioner has been confined, ante,\nat 2, but he never pauses to consider whether there is a\nlegitimate penological reason for keeping certain inmates\nin restrictive confinement. See, e.g., Kocieniewski, Death\nRow Inmate Said to Beat and Kick Another to Death in\nNew Jersey Prison, New York Times, Sept. 8, 1999, p. B5.\nIndeed, the disastrous consequences of this Court’s recent\nforay into prison management, Johnson v. California, 543\nU.

Moreover, by citing these statistics, JUSTICE\nSTEVENS implies “that the death penalty can only be just\nin a system that does not permit error.” Marsh, 548 U. S.,\nat 181. But no criminal justice system operates without\nerror. There is no constitutional basis for prohibiting\nFlorida “from authorizing the death penalty, even in our\nimperfect system.” Ibid.\n  Finally, JUSTICE STEVENS altogether refuses to take into\nconsideration the gruesome nature of the crimes that\nlegitimately lead States to authorize the death penalty\nand juries to impose it. The facts of this case illustrate the\npoint. On March 30, 1976, petitioner and his codefendant\nwere in a motel room with the victim and another woman.\nThey instructed the women to contact their families to\nobtain money. The victim made the mistake of promising\nthat she could obtain $200 to $300; she was able to secure\nonly $25. Enraged, petitioner’s codefendant ordered her\ninto the bedroom, removed his chain belt, forced her to\nundress, and began hitting her in the face while petitioner\nbeat her with the belt.

After\nthe call, petitioner and his codefendant resumed the tor\nture until the victim died. Thompson, 759 So. 2d, at 653–\n654.*\n   Three juries recommended that petitioner receive the\ndeath penalty for this heinous murder, and petitioner has\nreceived judicial review of his sentence on at least 17\noccasions.
