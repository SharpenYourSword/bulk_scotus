Argued October 14, 2009—Decided December 8, 2009\nIllinois law provides for forfeiture of movable personal property used to\n   facilitate a drug crime, permits police to seize the property without a\n   warrant, and allows the State to keep the property nearly five\n   months before beginning judicial forfeiture proceedings. Respon\n   dents, six individuals who had cars and cash seized under that law,\n   brought this federal civil rights action, claiming that the failure of\n   the State to provide a speedy postseizure hearing violated the federal\n   Due Process Clause. The District Court dismissed the case based on\n   Circuit precedent, but, on appeal, the Seventh Circuit departed from\n   that precedent and ruled for respondents. This Court granted certio\n   rari to review the Seventh Circuit’s due process determination, but\n   at oral argument the Court learned that all of the actual property\n   disputes between the parties had been resolved.\nHeld:\n    1. The case is moot. The Constitution permits this Court to decide\n legal questions only in the context of actual “Cases” or “Controver\n sies,” Art. III, §2, and an actual controversy must exist at all stages of\n review, not just when the complaint is filed, Preiser v. Newkirk, 422\n U. S. 395, 401. Here there is no longer any actual controversy re\n garding ownership or possession of the underlying property. There is\n no claim for damages before this Court; there is no properly certified\n class or dispute over class certification; and this case does not fit\n within the category of cases that are “capable of repetition” while\n “evading review.” Only an abstract dispute about the law remains.\n Pp. 4–6.\n    2.

Where mootness is the result of\n    settlement rather than happenstance, however, the losing party for\n    feits the equitable remedy of vacatur. U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v.\n    Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U. S. 18, 25. This case more closely re\n    sembles mootness through happenstance than through settlement.\n    In Bancorp, the party seeking review caused the mootness by volun\n    tarily settling the issue contested throughout the litigation. Here,\n    the Court believes that the presence of the federal case played no\n    significant role in the termination of plaintiffs’ state-court forfeiture\n    proceedings. Plaintiffs’ forfeiture cases took place with no procedural\n    link to the case before this Court; apparently terminated on substan\n    tive grounds in their ordinary course; and, to the Court’s knowledge,\n    no one raised the procedural question at issue here in those cases.\n    This Court therefore concludes that it should follow its ordinary prac\n    tice and order vacatur.

S. Const., Amdt. 14, §1; United States v. Von Neu\nmann, 474 U. S. 242 (1986); United States v. $8,850, 461\nU. S. 555 (1983). At the time of oral argument, however,\nwe learned that the underlying property disputes have all\nended. The State has returned all the cars that it seized,\nand the individual property owners have either forfeited\nany relevant cash or have accepted as final the State’s\nreturn of some of it. We consequently find the case moot,\nand we therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals and remand the case to that court with instruc­\ntions to dismiss. United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340\nU. S. 36, 39 (1950); see also E. Gressman, K. Geller, S.\nShapiro, T. Bishop, & E. Hartnett, Supreme Court Prac­\ntice 941–942 (9th ed. 2007).\n2                    ALVAREZ v. SMITH \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              I\n\n   Illinois law provides for forfeiture of movable personal\nproperty (including cars and cash) used “to facilitate” a\ndrug crime. Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, §570/505(a)(6) (West\n2008). It permits a police officer to seize that property\nwithout a warrant where (1) the officer has “probable\ncause to believe” the property was so used and (2) a “war­\nrantless seizure . . . would be reasonable” in the circum­\nstances. §570/505(b). When an officer has seized property\nwithout a warrant, the relevant law enforcement agency\nmust notify the State’s Attorney within 52 days of the\nseizure; the State’s Attorney must notify the property\nowner of any impending forfeiture within a further 45\ndays; and, if the owner wishes to contest forfeiture, the\nState’s Attorney must begin judicial forfeiture proceedings\nwithin yet a further 45 days. See ch. 725, §§150/5–150/6.\nThus, the statute gives the State up to 142 days, nearly\nfive months, to begin judicial forfeiture proceedings—\nduring which time the statute permits the State to keep\nthe car or cash within its possession.\n   On November 22, 2006, six individuals (the respondents\nor “plaintiffs”) brought this federal civil rights action\nagainst defendants the city of Chicago, the Superintendent\nof the Chicago Police Department, and the Cook County\nState’s Attorney (the petitioner here, whom we shall call\nthe “State’s Attorney”). See Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C.\n§1983. Three of the individuals, Chermane Smith, Ed­\nmanuel Perez, and Tyhesha Brunston, said that earlier in\n2006 the police had, upon their arrests, seized their cars\nwithout a warrant. See Complaint ¶25, App. 34a (Smith,\nseizure on Jan. 19, 2006); id., ¶26, at 34a (Perez, seizure\non Mar. 8, 2006); id., ¶27, at 34a (Brunston, seizure on\nApr. 8, 2006); Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification ¶8,\nat 39a. The other three plaintiffs, Michelle Waldo, Kirk\nYunker, and Tony Williams, said that earlier in 2006\npolice had, upon their arrests, seized their cash without a\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwarrant. See Complaint ¶28, at 34a–35a (Waldo, seizure\non Jan. 20, 2006); id., ¶29, at 35a (Yunker, seizure on\nSept. 26, 2006); id., ¶30, at 35a (Williams, seizure in July\n2006); Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification ¶8, at 39a.\nThe plaintiffs added that the police department still had\ncustody of their property. See Complaint ¶¶24–30, at\n34a–35a. They claimed that the failure of the State to\nprovide a speedy postseizure hearing violated the federal\nDue Process Clause. See U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §1. And\nthey asked the court (1) to certify the case as a class ac­\ntion, (2) to declare that they had a due process right to a\nprompt postseizure probable-cause hearing, (3) to declare\nthat the hearing must take place within 10 days of any\nseizure, and (4) to enjoin the defendants’ current practice\nof keeping the property in custody for a longer time with­\nout a judicial determination of probable cause. See Com­\nplaint ¶36, App. 36a.\n   The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the\nground that Seventh Circuit precedent made clear that\n“the Constitution does not require any procedure prior to\nthe actual forfeiture proceeding.” Jones v. Takaki, 38\nF. 3d 321, 324 (1994) (citing Von Neumann, supra, at 249).\nOn February 22, 2007, the District Court granted the\nmotion to dismiss. It also denied the plaintiffs’ motion for\nclass certification. The plaintiffs appealed.\n   On May 2, 2008, the Seventh Circuit decided the appeal\nin the plaintiffs’ favor. Smith v. Chicago, 524 F. 3d 834.\nIt reconsidered and departed from its earlier precedent.\nId., at 836–839. It held that “the procedures set out in”\nthe Illinois statute “show insufficient concern for the due\nprocess right of the plaintiffs.” Id., at 838. And it added\nthat, “given the length of time which can result between\nthe seizure of property and the opportunity for an owner\nto contest the seizure under” Illinois law, “some sort of\nmechanism to test the validity of the retention of the\nproperty is required.” Ibid. The Court of Appeals re­\n4                    ALVAREZ v. SMITH\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nversed the judgment of the District Court and remanded\nthe case for further proceedings. Id., at 839. Its mandate\nissued about seven weeks thereafter.\n   On February 23, 2009, we granted certiorari to review\nthe Seventh Circuit’s “due process” determination. The\nCourt of Appeals then recalled its mandate. The parties\nfiled briefs in this Court. We then recognized that\nthe case might be moot, and we asked the parties to ad­\ndress the question of mootness at the forthcoming oral\nargument.\n   At oral argument counsel for both sides confirmed that\nthere was no longer any dispute about ownership or pos­\nsession of the relevant property. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5\n(State’s Attorney); id., at 56–57 (plaintiffs). The State had\nreturned the cars to plaintiffs Smith, Perez, and Brunston.\nSee id., at 5. Two of the plaintiffs had “defaulted,” appar­\nently conceding that the State could keep the cash. Ibid.\nAnd the final plaintiff and the State’s Attorney agreed\nthat the plaintiff could keep some, but not all, of the cash\nat issue. Id., at 5, 56–57. As counsel for the State’s Attor­\nney told us, “[T]hose cases are over.” Id., at 5.\n                               II\n   The Constitution permits this Court to decide legal\nquestions only in the context of actual “Cases” or “Contro­\nversies.” U. S. Const., Art. III, §2. An “ ‘actual controversy\nmust be extant at all stages of review, not merely at the\ntime the complaint is filed.’ ” Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U. S.\n395, 401 (1975) (quoting Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U. S.\n452, 459, n. 10 (1974)). In this case there is no longer any\nactual controversy between the parties about ownership or\npossession of the underlying property.\n   The State’s Attorney argues that there is a continuing\ncontroversy over damages. We concede that the plaintiffs\nfiled a motion in the District Court seeking damages. But\nthe plaintiffs filed their motion after the Seventh Circuit\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nissued its opinion. And, after this Court granted certio­\nrari, the Court of Appeals recalled its mandate, taking the\ncase away from the District Court before the District\nCourt could respond to the motion. Thus, we have before\nus a complaint that seeks only declaratory and injunctive\nrelief, not damages.\n  The plaintiffs point out that they sought certification of\na class. And a class might well contain members who\ncontinue to dispute ownership of seized property. But that\nfact is beside the point. The District Court denied the\nplaintiffs’ class certification motion. The plaintiffs did not\nappeal that denial. Hence the only disputes relevant here\nare those between these six plaintiffs and the State’s\nAttorney; those disputes concerned cars and cash; and\nthose disputes are now over.           United States Parole\nComm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U. S. 388, 404 (1980) (“A named\nplaintiff whose claim expires may not continue to press\nthe appeal on the merits until a class has been properly\ncertified”).\n  The parties, of course, continue to dispute the lawful­\nness of the State’s hearing procedures. But that dispute is\nno longer embedded in any actual controversy about the\nplaintiffs’ particular legal rights. Rather, it is an abstract\ndispute about the law, unlikely to affect these plaintiffs\nany more than it affects other Illinois citizens. And a\ndispute solely about the meaning of a law, abstracted from\nany concrete actual or threatened harm, falls outside the\nscope of the constitutional words “Cases” and “Controver­\nsies.” See, e.g., Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 494 U. S.\n472, 477 (1990); North Carolina v. Rice, 404 U. S. 244, 246\n(1971) (per curiam); Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300\nU. S. 227, 241 (1937); Mills v. Green, 159 U. S. 651, 653\n(1895).\n  We can find no special circumstance here that might\nwarrant our continuing to hear the case. We have some­\ntimes heard attacks on practices that no longer directly\n6                   ALVAREZ v. SMITH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\naffect the attacking party, but are “capable of repetition”\nwhile “evading review.”        See, e.g., Federal Election\nComm’n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 551 U. S. 449, 462\n(2007); Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U. S.\n498, 515 (1911). Yet here, unlike those cases, nothing\nsuggests that the individual plaintiffs will likely again\nprove subject to the State’s seizure procedures. See Los\nAngeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 109 (1983) (“[T]he capable­\nof-repetition doctrine applies only in exceptional situa­\ntions, and generally only where the named plaintiff can\nmake a reasonable showing that he will again be subjected\nto the alleged illegality”); DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S.\n312, 318–319 (1974) (per curiam). And in any event, since\nthose who are directly affected by the forfeiture practices\nmight bring damages actions, the practices do not “evade\nreview.” See Memphis Light, Gas & Water Div. v. Craft,\n436 U. S. 1, 8–9 (1978) (damages claim saves case from\nmootness). Consequently, the case is moot. See, e.g.,\nPreiser, supra, at 403–404; Mills, supra, at 658.\n                             III\n   It is less easy to say whether we should order the judg­\nment below vacated. The statute that enables us to vacate\na lower court judgment when a case becomes moot is\nflexible, allowing a court to “direct the entry of such ap­\npropriate judgment, decree, or order, or require such\nfurther proceedings to be had as may be just under the\ncircumstances.” 28 U. S. C. §2106; see also U. S. Bancorp\nMortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U. S. 18, 21\n(1994). Applying this statute, we normally do vacate the\nlower court judgment in a moot case because doing so\n“clears the path for future relitigation of the issues be­\ntween the parties,” preserving “the rights of all parties,”\nwhile prejudicing none “by a decision which . . . was only\npreliminary.” Munsingwear, 340 U. S., at 40.\n   In Bancorp, however, we described circumstances where\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwe would not do so. We said that, “[w]here mootness\nresults from settlement” rather than “ ‘happenstance,’ ” the\n“losing party has voluntarily forfeited his legal remedy . . .\n[and] thereby surrender[ed] his claim to the equitable\nremedy of vacatur.” 513 U. S., at 25. The plaintiffs, point­\ning out that the State’s Attorney agreed to return all three\ncars and some of the cash, claim that, with respect to at\nleast four of the plaintiffs, this case falls within Bancorp’s\n“settlement” exception.\n   In our view, however, this case more closely resembles\nmootness through “happenstance” than through “settle­\nment”—at least the kind of settlement that the Court\nconsidered in Bancorp. Bancorp focused upon a bank­\nruptcy-related dispute that involved a legal question\nwhether a bankruptcy court could lawfully confirm a\ndebtor’s Chapter 11 reorganization plan if the plan relied\nupon what the debtor said was a special exception (called\nthe “new value exception”) to ordinary creditor priority\nrules. Id., at 19–20. The parties contested that legal issue\nin the Bankruptcy Court; they contested it in an appeal of\nthe Bankruptcy Court’s order to the Federal District\nCourt; they contested it in a further appeal to the Court of\nAppeals; and eventually they contested it in this Court.\nId., at 20. While the case was pending here, the parties\nsettled their differences in the Bankruptcy Court (the\ncourt where the case originated)—including their differ­\nences on this particular contested legal point. Ibid. They\nagreed upon a reorganization plan, which they said would\nconstitute a settlement that mooted the federal case. Ibid.\n   Recognizing that the reorganization plan that the Bank­\nruptcy Judge confirmed in the case amounted to a settle­\nment that mooted the case, this Court did not vacate the\nlower court’s judgment. The Court’s reason for leaving the\nlower court’s judgment in place was that mootness was not\na result of “the vagaries of circumstance.” Id., at 25.\nRather the party seeking review had “caused the mootness\n8                    ALVAREZ v. SMITH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nby voluntary action.” Id., at 24 (emphasis added). By\nvirtue of the settlement, that party had “voluntarily for­\nfeited his legal remedy by the ordinary processes of appeal\nor certiorari.” Id., at 25. Hence, compared to mootness\ncaused by “happenstance,” considerations of “equity” and\n“fairness” tilted against vacatur. Id., at 25–26.\n   Applying these principles to the case before us, we\nconclude that the terminations here fall on the “happen­\nstance” side of the line. The six individual cases proceeded\nthrough a different court system without any procedural\nlink to the federal case before us. To our knowledge (and\nwe have examined the state-court docket sheets), no one in\nthose cases raised the procedural question at issue here.\nRather, the issues in those six cases were issues solely of\nstate substantive law: Were the cars and the cash forfeit­\nable or not? And court docket sheets suggest that the six\nstate cases terminated on substantive grounds in the\nordinary course of such state proceedings. In the three\nautomobile cases, the State voluntarily dismissed the\nproceedings and returned the cars between 11 and 40\nmonths after the seizures, a long enough time for the\nState to have investigated the matters and to have deter­\nmined (after the termination of any related criminal pro­\nceedings) for evidentiary reasons that it did not wish to\nclaim the cars. See Dockets in People v. 2004 Chevrolet\nImpala, No. 2006–COFO–000296 (Cook County, IL)\n(Brunston’s car returned on July 27, 2009); People v.\nSmith, No. 2006–COFO–000036 (Cook County, IL)\n(Smith’s car returned on May 5, 2008); and People v. 1999\nChevrolet Malibu, No. 2006–COFO–000288 (Cook County,\nIL) (Perez’s car returned on Jan. 29, 2007). In the remain­\ning contested case, involving cash, the State voluntarily\ndismissed the proceedings after 14 months, again a long\nenough time for the State to have weighed the evidence\nand found a compromise settlement appropriate on the\nmerits. See Docket in People v. $1,500 in U. S. Currency,\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nNo. 2006–COFO–000201 (Cook County, IL) (Waldo’s cash\nreturned on Mar. 19, 2007). The disparate dates at which\nplaintiffs’ forfeiture proceedings terminated—11, 14, 27,\nand 40 months after the seizures—indicate that the\nState’s Attorney did not coordinate the resolution of plain­\ntiffs’ state-court cases, either with each other or with\nplaintiffs’ federal civil rights case. Cf. Munsingwear, 340\nU. S., at 39–40 (stating that a lower court judgment would\nhave been vacated even though an action of the party\nseeking review had brought about the mootness because\nthat action—a commodity being decontrolled by Executive\nOrder—was basically unrelated); see also Fleming v.\nMunsingwear, Inc., 162 F. 2d 125, 127 (CA8 1947).\n   For these reasons, we believe that the presence of this\nfederal case played no significant role in the termination\nof the separate state-court proceedings. This conclusion is\nreinforced by the fact that neither party, although aware\nof Bancorp, suggested the contrary at oral argument.\nIndeed, both parties argued against mootness at oral\nargument, a fact that further suggests that a desire to\navoid review in this case played no role at all in producing\nthe state case terminations.

Following the teaching of our\ndecision in U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall\nPartnership, 513 U. S. 18 (1994), I would apply the general\nrule against vacating appellate judgments that have be\ncome moot because the parties settled.\n   Bancorp set forth the basic principles for determining\nwhether to vacate a case that has become moot. The\noverriding concern is equitable: “From the beginning we\nhave disposed of moot cases in the manner ‘ “most conso\nnant to justice” . . . in view of the nature and character of\nthe conditions which have caused the case to become\nmoot.’ ” Id., at 24 (quoting United States v. Hamburg-\nAmerikanische Packetfahrt-Actien Gesellschaft, 239 U. S.\n466, 477–478 (1916), in turn quoting South Spring Hill\nGold Mining Co. v. Amador Medean Gold Mining Co., 145\nU. S. 300, 302 (1892) (alteration in original)). The “public\ninterest” must be considered as part of this equitable\ninquiry, Bancorp, 513 U. S., at 26, 27, and that interest is\ngenerally better served by leaving appellate judgments\nintact. “ ‘Judicial precedents are presumptively correct\n2                     ALVAREZ v. SMITH\n\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nand valuable to the legal community as a whole. They are\nnot merely the property of private litigants . . . .’ ” Id., at\n26 (quoting Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha v.\nU. S. Philips Corp., 510 U. S. 27, 40 (1993) (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting)). Hence, we will typically vacate a judgment\nwhen the party seeking review has been “frustrated by the\nvagaries of circumstance” or “when mootness results from\nunilateral action of the party who prevailed below.” Ban\ncorp, 513 U. S., at 25. But we will typically decline to\nvacate when “the party seeking relief from the judgment\nbelow caused the mootness by voluntary action,” id., at 24,\nincluding action taken in good faith and in conjunction\nwith the opposing party. Even when “respondent agreed\nto [a] settlement that caused the mootness,” it remains\n“petitioner’s burden, as the party seeking relief from the\nstatus quo of the appellate judgment, to demonstrate not\nmerely equivalent responsibility for the mootness, but\nequitable entitlement to the extraordinary remedy of\nvacatur.” Id., at 26. “[M]ootness by reason of settlement\ndoes not justify vacatur of a judgment under review.” Id.,\nat 29.\n  In my view, the Court has misapplied these principles.\nTo be sure, the “settlement” between the parties in this\ncase might be distinguished from the more conventional\nsettlement reached by the parties in Bancorp. And we\nhave no evidence to suggest that petitioner returned re\nspondents’ property prior to the conclusion of our review\nwith the purpose or expectation of manufacturing moot\nness. Nevertheless, petitioner’s decision to return the\nautomobiles when it did appears to have been legally\ndiscretionary, as was the “compromise settlement” that it\nreached with respondent Waldo regarding her cash, ante,\nat 8. In light of petitioner’s purposive and voluntary\naction that caused the mootness—along with its failure to\nalert us to the relevant facts or to explain why vacatur\nwould serve the public interest—I believe it has failed to\n                  Cite as: 558 U.

S., at 26.\n   There was a third option for disposing of this case: We\ncould have dismissed the writ of certiorari as improvi\ndently granted. Like denying the petition in the first\nplace, that disposition would have preserved the judgment\nbelow. At the time we granted certiorari on February 23,\n2009, petitioner had already resolved the underlying\nproperty disputes for five of the six named respondents.\nSee ante, at 4, 8–9. It was entirely predictable that the\nfinal settlement would soon follow. Moreover, the briefing\nin this case has revealed a disagreement over basic de\nscriptive questions of Illinois law, questions that were not\npassed upon below. Compare Brief for Petitioner 60–66\nwith Brief for Respondents 41–44. And, of course, we have\nno way of knowing how the District Court would have\napplied the Court of Appeals’ remand order, which left it\ngreat discretion to “fashion appropriate procedural relief”\n“with the help of the parties.” Smith v. City of Chicago,\n524 F. 3d 834, 838 (CA7 2008). It has become clear that\nthe Court was overhasty in deciding to review this case;\nthe improvidence of our grant provides an additional\nreason why we should not vacate the work product of our\ncolleagues on the Court of Appeals.\n   I respectfully dissent from Part III of the Court’s opinion\nand from its judgment.\n</pre>", "id": 1752, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2009/12/08/Alvarez_v._Smith.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2009                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Respon\n   dents, six individuals who had cars and cash seized under that law,\n   brought this federal civil rights action, claiming that the failure of\n   the State to provide a speedy postseizure hearing violated the federal\n   Due Process Clause. The District Court dismissed the case based on\n   Circuit precedent, but, on appeal, the Seventh Circuit departed from\n   that precedent and ruled for respondents. This Court granted certio\n   rari to review the Seventh Circuit’s due process determination, but\n   at oral argument the Court learned that all of the actual property\n   disputes between the parties had been resolved.\nHeld:\n    1. The case is moot. The Constitution permits this Court to decide\n legal questions only in the context of actual “Cases” or “Controver\n sies,” Art. III, §2, and an actual controversy must exist at all stages of\n review, not just when the complaint is filed, Preiser v. Newkirk, 422\n U. S. 395, 401. Here there is no longer any actual controversy re\n garding ownership or possession of the underlying property. There is\n no claim for damages before this Court; there is no properly certified\n class or dispute over class certification; and this case does not fit\n within the category of cases that are “capable of repetition” while\n “evading review.” Only an abstract dispute about the law remains.\n Pp. 4–6.\n    2.

Bancorp Mortgage Co. v.\n    Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U. S. 18, 25. This case more closely re\n    sembles mootness through happenstance than through settlement.\n    In Bancorp, the party seeking review caused the mootness by volun\n    tarily settling the issue contested throughout the litigation. Here,\n    the Court believes that the presence of the federal case played no\n    significant role in the termination of plaintiffs’ state-court forfeiture\n    proceedings. Plaintiffs’ forfeiture cases took place with no procedural\n    link to the case before this Court; apparently terminated on substan\n    tive grounds in their ordinary course; and, to the Court’s knowledge,\n    no one raised the procedural question at issue here in those cases.\n    This Court therefore concludes that it should follow its ordinary prac\n    tice and order vacatur.

S. Const., Amdt. 14, §1; United States v. Von Neu\nmann, 474 U. S. 242 (1986); United States v. $8,850, 461\nU. S. 555 (1983). At the time of oral argument, however,\nwe learned that the underlying property disputes have all\nended. The State has returned all the cars that it seized,\nand the individual property owners have either forfeited\nany relevant cash or have accepted as final the State’s\nreturn of some of it. We consequently find the case moot,\nand we therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals and remand the case to that court with instruc­\ntions to dismiss. United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340\nU. S. 36, 39 (1950); see also E. Gressman, K. Geller, S.\nShapiro, T. Bishop, & E. Hartnett, Supreme Court Prac­\ntice 941–942 (9th ed. 2007).\n2                    ALVAREZ v. SMITH \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              I\n\n   Illinois law provides for forfeiture of movable personal\nproperty (including cars and cash) used “to facilitate” a\ndrug crime. Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, §570/505(a)(6) (West\n2008). It permits a police officer to seize that property\nwithout a warrant where (1) the officer has “probable\ncause to believe” the property was so used and (2) a “war­\nrantless seizure . . . would be reasonable” in the circum­\nstances. §570/505(b). When an officer has seized property\nwithout a warrant, the relevant law enforcement agency\nmust notify the State’s Attorney within 52 days of the\nseizure; the State’s Attorney must notify the property\nowner of any impending forfeiture within a further 45\ndays; and, if the owner wishes to contest forfeiture, the\nState’s Attorney must begin judicial forfeiture proceedings\nwithin yet a further 45 days. See ch. 725, §§150/5–150/6.\nThus, the statute gives the State up to 142 days, nearly\nfive months, to begin judicial forfeiture proceedings—\nduring which time the statute permits the State to keep\nthe car or cash within its possession.\n   On November 22, 2006, six individuals (the respondents\nor “plaintiffs”) brought this federal civil rights action\nagainst defendants the city of Chicago, the Superintendent\nof the Chicago Police Department, and the Cook County\nState’s Attorney (the petitioner here, whom we shall call\nthe “State’s Attorney”). See Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C.\n§1983. Three of the individuals, Chermane Smith, Ed­\nmanuel Perez, and Tyhesha Brunston, said that earlier in\n2006 the police had, upon their arrests, seized their cars\nwithout a warrant. See Complaint ¶25, App. 34a (Smith,\nseizure on Jan. 19, 2006); id., ¶26, at 34a (Perez, seizure\non Mar. 8, 2006); id., ¶27, at 34a (Brunston, seizure on\nApr. 8, 2006); Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification ¶8,\nat 39a. The other three plaintiffs, Michelle Waldo, Kirk\nYunker, and Tony Williams, said that earlier in 2006\npolice had, upon their arrests, seized their cash without a\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwarrant. See Complaint ¶28, at 34a–35a (Waldo, seizure\non Jan. 20, 2006); id., ¶29, at 35a (Yunker, seizure on\nSept. 26, 2006); id., ¶30, at 35a (Williams, seizure in July\n2006); Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification ¶8, at 39a.\nThe plaintiffs added that the police department still had\ncustody of their property. See Complaint ¶¶24–30, at\n34a–35a. They claimed that the failure of the State to\nprovide a speedy postseizure hearing violated the federal\nDue Process Clause. See U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §1. And\nthey asked the court (1) to certify the case as a class ac­\ntion, (2) to declare that they had a due process right to a\nprompt postseizure probable-cause hearing, (3) to declare\nthat the hearing must take place within 10 days of any\nseizure, and (4) to enjoin the defendants’ current practice\nof keeping the property in custody for a longer time with­\nout a judicial determination of probable cause. See Com­\nplaint ¶36, App. 36a.\n   The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the\nground that Seventh Circuit precedent made clear that\n“the Constitution does not require any procedure prior to\nthe actual forfeiture proceeding.” Jones v. Takaki, 38\nF. 3d 321, 324 (1994) (citing Von Neumann, supra, at 249).\nOn February 22, 2007, the District Court granted the\nmotion to dismiss. It also denied the plaintiffs’ motion for\nclass certification. The plaintiffs appealed.\n   On May 2, 2008, the Seventh Circuit decided the appeal\nin the plaintiffs’ favor. Smith v. Chicago, 524 F. 3d 834.\nIt reconsidered and departed from its earlier precedent.\nId., at 836–839. It held that “the procedures set out in”\nthe Illinois statute “show insufficient concern for the due\nprocess right of the plaintiffs.” Id., at 838. And it added\nthat, “given the length of time which can result between\nthe seizure of property and the opportunity for an owner\nto contest the seizure under” Illinois law, “some sort of\nmechanism to test the validity of the retention of the\nproperty is required.” Ibid. The Court of Appeals re­\n4                    ALVAREZ v. SMITH\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nversed the judgment of the District Court and remanded\nthe case for further proceedings. Id., at 839. Its mandate\nissued about seven weeks thereafter.\n   On February 23, 2009, we granted certiorari to review\nthe Seventh Circuit’s “due process” determination. The\nCourt of Appeals then recalled its mandate. The parties\nfiled briefs in this Court. We then recognized that\nthe case might be moot, and we asked the parties to ad­\ndress the question of mootness at the forthcoming oral\nargument.\n   At oral argument counsel for both sides confirmed that\nthere was no longer any dispute about ownership or pos­\nsession of the relevant property. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5\n(State’s Attorney); id., at 56–57 (plaintiffs). The State had\nreturned the cars to plaintiffs Smith, Perez, and Brunston.\nSee id., at 5. Two of the plaintiffs had “defaulted,” appar­\nently conceding that the State could keep the cash. Ibid.\nAnd the final plaintiff and the State’s Attorney agreed\nthat the plaintiff could keep some, but not all, of the cash\nat issue. Id., at 5, 56–57. As counsel for the State’s Attor­\nney told us, “[T]hose cases are over.” Id., at 5.\n                               II\n   The Constitution permits this Court to decide legal\nquestions only in the context of actual “Cases” or “Contro­\nversies.” U. S. Const., Art. III, §2. An “ ‘actual controversy\nmust be extant at all stages of review, not merely at the\ntime the complaint is filed.’ ” Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U. S.\n395, 401 (1975) (quoting Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U. S.\n452, 459, n. 10 (1974)). In this case there is no longer any\nactual controversy between the parties about ownership or\npossession of the underlying property.\n   The State’s Attorney argues that there is a continuing\ncontroversy over damages. We concede that the plaintiffs\nfiled a motion in the District Court seeking damages. But\nthe plaintiffs filed their motion after the Seventh Circuit\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nissued its opinion. And, after this Court granted certio­\nrari, the Court of Appeals recalled its mandate, taking the\ncase away from the District Court before the District\nCourt could respond to the motion. Thus, we have before\nus a complaint that seeks only declaratory and injunctive\nrelief, not damages.\n  The plaintiffs point out that they sought certification of\na class. And a class might well contain members who\ncontinue to dispute ownership of seized property. But that\nfact is beside the point. The District Court denied the\nplaintiffs’ class certification motion. The plaintiffs did not\nappeal that denial. Hence the only disputes relevant here\nare those between these six plaintiffs and the State’s\nAttorney; those disputes concerned cars and cash; and\nthose disputes are now over.           United States Parole\nComm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U. S. 388, 404 (1980) (“A named\nplaintiff whose claim expires may not continue to press\nthe appeal on the merits until a class has been properly\ncertified”).\n  The parties, of course, continue to dispute the lawful­\nness of the State’s hearing procedures. But that dispute is\nno longer embedded in any actual controversy about the\nplaintiffs’ particular legal rights. Rather, it is an abstract\ndispute about the law, unlikely to affect these plaintiffs\nany more than it affects other Illinois citizens. And a\ndispute solely about the meaning of a law, abstracted from\nany concrete actual or threatened harm, falls outside the\nscope of the constitutional words “Cases” and “Controver­\nsies.” See, e.g., Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 494 U. S.\n472, 477 (1990); North Carolina v. Rice, 404 U. S. 244, 246\n(1971) (per curiam); Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300\nU. S. 227, 241 (1937); Mills v. Green, 159 U. S. 651, 653\n(1895).\n  We can find no special circumstance here that might\nwarrant our continuing to hear the case. We have some­\ntimes heard attacks on practices that no longer directly\n6                   ALVAREZ v. SMITH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\naffect the attacking party, but are “capable of repetition”\nwhile “evading review.”        See, e.g., Federal Election\nComm’n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 551 U. S. 449, 462\n(2007); Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U. S.\n498, 515 (1911). Yet here, unlike those cases, nothing\nsuggests that the individual plaintiffs will likely again\nprove subject to the State’s seizure procedures. See Los\nAngeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 109 (1983) (“[T]he capable­\nof-repetition doctrine applies only in exceptional situa­\ntions, and generally only where the named plaintiff can\nmake a reasonable showing that he will again be subjected\nto the alleged illegality”); DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S.\n312, 318–319 (1974) (per curiam). And in any event, since\nthose who are directly affected by the forfeiture practices\nmight bring damages actions, the practices do not “evade\nreview.” See Memphis Light, Gas & Water Div. v. Craft,\n436 U. S. 1, 8–9 (1978) (damages claim saves case from\nmootness). Consequently, the case is moot. See, e.g.,\nPreiser, supra, at 403–404; Mills, supra, at 658.\n                             III\n   It is less easy to say whether we should order the judg­\nment below vacated. The statute that enables us to vacate\na lower court judgment when a case becomes moot is\nflexible, allowing a court to “direct the entry of such ap­\npropriate judgment, decree, or order, or require such\nfurther proceedings to be had as may be just under the\ncircumstances.” 28 U. S. C. §2106; see also U. S. Bancorp\nMortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U. S. 18, 21\n(1994). Applying this statute, we normally do vacate the\nlower court judgment in a moot case because doing so\n“clears the path for future relitigation of the issues be­\ntween the parties,” preserving “the rights of all parties,”\nwhile prejudicing none “by a decision which . . . was only\npreliminary.” Munsingwear, 340 U. S., at 40.\n   In Bancorp, however, we described circumstances where\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwe would not do so. We said that, “[w]here mootness\nresults from settlement” rather than “ ‘happenstance,’ ” the\n“losing party has voluntarily forfeited his legal remedy . . .\n[and] thereby surrender[ed] his claim to the equitable\nremedy of vacatur.” 513 U. S., at 25. The plaintiffs, point­\ning out that the State’s Attorney agreed to return all three\ncars and some of the cash, claim that, with respect to at\nleast four of the plaintiffs, this case falls within Bancorp’s\n“settlement” exception.\n   In our view, however, this case more closely resembles\nmootness through “happenstance” than through “settle­\nment”—at least the kind of settlement that the Court\nconsidered in Bancorp. Bancorp focused upon a bank­\nruptcy-related dispute that involved a legal question\nwhether a bankruptcy court could lawfully confirm a\ndebtor’s Chapter 11 reorganization plan if the plan relied\nupon what the debtor said was a special exception (called\nthe “new value exception”) to ordinary creditor priority\nrules. Id., at 19–20. The parties contested that legal issue\nin the Bankruptcy Court; they contested it in an appeal of\nthe Bankruptcy Court’s order to the Federal District\nCourt; they contested it in a further appeal to the Court of\nAppeals; and eventually they contested it in this Court.\nId., at 20. While the case was pending here, the parties\nsettled their differences in the Bankruptcy Court (the\ncourt where the case originated)—including their differ­\nences on this particular contested legal point. Ibid. They\nagreed upon a reorganization plan, which they said would\nconstitute a settlement that mooted the federal case. Ibid.\n   Recognizing that the reorganization plan that the Bank­\nruptcy Judge confirmed in the case amounted to a settle­\nment that mooted the case, this Court did not vacate the\nlower court’s judgment. The Court’s reason for leaving the\nlower court’s judgment in place was that mootness was not\na result of “the vagaries of circumstance.” Id., at 25.\nRather the party seeking review had “caused the mootness\n8                    ALVAREZ v. SMITH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nby voluntary action.” Id., at 24 (emphasis added). By\nvirtue of the settlement, that party had “voluntarily for­\nfeited his legal remedy by the ordinary processes of appeal\nor certiorari.” Id., at 25. Hence, compared to mootness\ncaused by “happenstance,” considerations of “equity” and\n“fairness” tilted against vacatur. Id., at 25–26.\n   Applying these principles to the case before us, we\nconclude that the terminations here fall on the “happen­\nstance” side of the line. The six individual cases proceeded\nthrough a different court system without any procedural\nlink to the federal case before us. To our knowledge (and\nwe have examined the state-court docket sheets), no one in\nthose cases raised the procedural question at issue here.\nRather, the issues in those six cases were issues solely of\nstate substantive law: Were the cars and the cash forfeit­\nable or not? And court docket sheets suggest that the six\nstate cases terminated on substantive grounds in the\nordinary course of such state proceedings. In the three\nautomobile cases, the State voluntarily dismissed the\nproceedings and returned the cars between 11 and 40\nmonths after the seizures, a long enough time for the\nState to have investigated the matters and to have deter­\nmined (after the termination of any related criminal pro­\nceedings) for evidentiary reasons that it did not wish to\nclaim the cars. See Dockets in People v. 2004 Chevrolet\nImpala, No. 2006–COFO–000296 (Cook County, IL)\n(Brunston’s car returned on July 27, 2009); People v.\nSmith, No. 2006–COFO–000036 (Cook County, IL)\n(Smith’s car returned on May 5, 2008); and People v. 1999\nChevrolet Malibu, No. 2006–COFO–000288 (Cook County,\nIL) (Perez’s car returned on Jan. 29, 2007). In the remain­\ning contested case, involving cash, the State voluntarily\ndismissed the proceedings after 14 months, again a long\nenough time for the State to have weighed the evidence\nand found a compromise settlement appropriate on the\nmerits. See Docket in People v. $1,500 in U. S. Currency,\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nNo. 2006–COFO–000201 (Cook County, IL) (Waldo’s cash\nreturned on Mar. 19, 2007). The disparate dates at which\nplaintiffs’ forfeiture proceedings terminated—11, 14, 27,\nand 40 months after the seizures—indicate that the\nState’s Attorney did not coordinate the resolution of plain­\ntiffs’ state-court cases, either with each other or with\nplaintiffs’ federal civil rights case. Cf. Munsingwear, 340\nU. S., at 39–40 (stating that a lower court judgment would\nhave been vacated even though an action of the party\nseeking review had brought about the mootness because\nthat action—a commodity being decontrolled by Executive\nOrder—was basically unrelated); see also Fleming v.\nMunsingwear, Inc., 162 F. 2d 125, 127 (CA8 1947).\n   For these reasons, we believe that the presence of this\nfederal case played no significant role in the termination\nof the separate state-court proceedings. This conclusion is\nreinforced by the fact that neither party, although aware\nof Bancorp, suggested the contrary at oral argument.\nIndeed, both parties argued against mootness at oral\nargument, a fact that further suggests that a desire to\navoid review in this case played no role at all in producing\nthe state case terminations. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5–11, 33–38.\nAnd if the presence of this federal case played no role in\ncausing the termination of those state cases, there is not\npresent here the kind of “voluntary forfeit[ure]” of a legal\nremedy that led the Court in Bancorp to find that consid­\nerations of “fairness” and “equity” tilted against vacatur.\n   We consequently conclude that we should follow our\nordinary practice, thereby “clear[ing] the path for future\nrelitigation of the issues.” Munsingwear, 340 U. S., at 40.\nThus, nothing in this opinion prevents the plaintiffs from\nbringing a claim for damages based on the conduct alleged\nin their complaint. Id., at 37–40.\n   We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Ap­\npeals and remand the case to that court with instructions\nto dismiss.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

Following the teaching of our\ndecision in U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall\nPartnership, 513 U. S. 18 (1994), I would apply the general\nrule against vacating appellate judgments that have be\ncome moot because the parties settled.\n   Bancorp set forth the basic principles for determining\nwhether to vacate a case that has become moot. The\noverriding concern is equitable: “From the beginning we\nhave disposed of moot cases in the manner ‘ “most conso\nnant to justice” . . . in view of the nature and character of\nthe conditions which have caused the case to become\nmoot.’ ” Id., at 24 (quoting United States v. Hamburg-\nAmerikanische Packetfahrt-Actien Gesellschaft, 239 U. S.\n466, 477–478 (1916), in turn quoting South Spring Hill\nGold Mining Co. v. Amador Medean Gold Mining Co., 145\nU. S. 300, 302 (1892) (alteration in original)). The “public\ninterest” must be considered as part of this equitable\ninquiry, Bancorp, 513 U. S., at 26, 27, and that interest is\ngenerally better served by leaving appellate judgments\nintact. “ ‘Judicial precedents are presumptively correct\n2                     ALVAREZ v. SMITH\n\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nand valuable to the legal community as a whole. They are\nnot merely the property of private litigants . . . .’ ” Id., at\n26 (quoting Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha v.\nU. S. Philips Corp., 510 U. S. 27, 40 (1993) (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting)). Hence, we will typically vacate a judgment\nwhen the party seeking review has been “frustrated by the\nvagaries of circumstance” or “when mootness results from\nunilateral action of the party who prevailed below.” Ban\ncorp, 513 U. S., at 25. But we will typically decline to\nvacate when “the party seeking relief from the judgment\nbelow caused the mootness by voluntary action,” id., at 24,\nincluding action taken in good faith and in conjunction\nwith the opposing party. Even when “respondent agreed\nto [a] settlement that caused the mootness,” it remains\n“petitioner’s burden, as the party seeking relief from the\nstatus quo of the appellate judgment, to demonstrate not\nmerely equivalent responsibility for the mootness, but\nequitable entitlement to the extraordinary remedy of\nvacatur.” Id., at 26. “[M]ootness by reason of settlement\ndoes not justify vacatur of a judgment under review.” Id.,\nat 29.\n  In my view, the Court has misapplied these principles.\nTo be sure, the “settlement” between the parties in this\ncase might be distinguished from the more conventional\nsettlement reached by the parties in Bancorp. And we\nhave no evidence to suggest that petitioner returned re\nspondents’ property prior to the conclusion of our review\nwith the purpose or expectation of manufacturing moot\nness. Nevertheless, petitioner’s decision to return the\nautomobiles when it did appears to have been legally\ndiscretionary, as was the “compromise settlement” that it\nreached with respondent Waldo regarding her cash, ante,\nat 8. In light of petitioner’s purposive and voluntary\naction that caused the mootness—along with its failure to\nalert us to the relevant facts or to explain why vacatur\nwould serve the public interest—I believe it has failed to\n                  Cite as: 558 U.

S., at 26.\n   There was a third option for disposing of this case: We\ncould have dismissed the writ of certiorari as improvi\ndently granted. Like denying the petition in the first\nplace, that disposition would have preserved the judgment\nbelow. At the time we granted certiorari on February 23,\n2009, petitioner had already resolved the underlying\nproperty disputes for five of the six named respondents.\nSee ante, at 4, 8–9. It was entirely predictable that the\nfinal settlement would soon follow. Moreover, the briefing\nin this case has revealed a disagreement over basic de\nscriptive questions of Illinois law, questions that were not\npassed upon below. Compare Brief for Petitioner 60–66\nwith Brief for Respondents 41–44. And, of course, we have\nno way of knowing how the District Court would have\napplied the Court of Appeals’ remand order, which left it\ngreat discretion to “fashion appropriate procedural relief”\n“with the help of the parties.” Smith v. City of Chicago,\n524 F. 3d 834, 838 (CA7 2008). It has become clear that\nthe Court was overhasty in deciding to review this case;\nthe improvidence of our grant provides an additional\nreason why we should not vacate the work product of our\ncolleagues on the Court of Appeals.\n   I respectfully dissent from Part III of the Court’s opinion\nand from its judgment.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/1752/", "sha1": "a57db96e0c59027486622e3546d7f6c746be43b3", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2009-002", "time_retrieved": "2010-04-15T12:40:17"}
