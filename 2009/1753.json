Argued October 7, 2009—Decided December 8, 2009\nThe Railway Labor Act (RLA or Act) was enacted to promote peaceful\n  and efficient resolution of labor disputes. As amended, the Act man\n  dates arbitration of “minor disputes” before panels composed of two\n  representatives of labor and two of industry, with a neutral referee as\n  tiebreaker. Union Pacific R. Co. v. Price, 360 U. S. 601, 610–613. To\n  supply arbitrators, Congress established the National Railroad Ad\n  justment Board (NRAB or Board), a board of 34 private persons rep\n  resenting labor and industry in equal numbers. 45 U. S. C. §153\n  First (a). Before resorting to arbitration, employees and carriers\n  must exhaust the grievance procedures in their collective-bargaining\n  agreement (hereinafter CBA), see §153 First (i), a stage known as\n  “on-property” proceedings. As a final prearbitration step, the parties\n  must attempt settlement “in conference” between representatives of\n  the carrier and the grievant-employee. §152 Second, Sixth. The RLA\n  contains instructions concerning the place and time of conferences,\n  but does not “supersede the provisions of any agreement (as to con\n  ferences) . . . between the parties,” §152 Sixth; in common practice\n  the conference may be as informal as a telephone conversation. If the\n  parties fail to achieve resolution, either may refer the matter to the\n  NRAB. §153 First (i). Submissions to the Board must include “a full\n  statement of the facts and all supporting data bearing upon the dis\n  putes.” Ibid. Parties may seek court review of an NRAB panel order\n  on one or more stated grounds: “failure . . . to comply with the re\n  quirements of [the RLA], . . . failure of the order to conform, or con\n  2   UNION PACIFIC R.

Courts of Appeals have divided on whether, in\n  addition to the statutory grounds for judicial review stated in §153\n  First (q), courts may review NRAB proceedings for due process viola\n  tions.\n      After petitioner Union Pacific Railroad Co. (hereinafter Carrier)\n  charged five of its employees with disciplinary violations, their union\n  (hereinafter Union) initiated grievance proceedings pursuant to the\n  CBA. The Union asserts that the parties conferenced all five dis\n  putes and the Carrier concedes that they conferenced at least two.\n  Dissatisfied with the outcome of the on-property proceedings, the Un\n  ion sought arbitration before the NRAB’s First Division. Both parties\n  filed submissions in the five cases, but neither mentioned conferenc\n  ing as a disputed matter. Yet, in each case, both parties necessarily\n  knew whether the Union and the Carrier had conferred; and the\n  Board’s governing rule, published in Circular One, which prescribes\n  Board procedures, instructs carriers and employees to “set forth all\n  relevant, argumentative facts,” 29 CFR §301.5(d), (e). Just prior to\n  the hearing, one of the arbitration panel’s industry representatives\n  objected, sua sponte, that the on-property record included no proof of\n  conferencing. The Carrier thereafter embraced that objection. The\n  referee allowed the Union to submit evidence of conferencing. The\n  Union did so, but it maintained that the proof-of-conferencing issue\n  was untimely raised, indeed forfeited, as the Carrier had not objected\n  before the date set for argument. The panel, in five identical deci\n  sions, dismissed the petitions for want of jurisdiction. The record\n  could not be supplemented to meet the no-proof-of-conferencing objec\n  tion, the panel reasoned, for as an appellate tribunal, the panel was\n  not empowered to consider de novo evidence and arguments. The Un\n  ion sought review in the Federal District Court, which affirmed the\n  Board’s decision. On appeal, the Seventh Circuit observed that the\n  “single question” at issue was whether written documentation of the\n  conference in the on-property record was a necessary prerequisite to\n  NRAB arbitration, and determined that there was no such prerequi\n  site in the statute or rules. But instead of resting its decision on the\n  Union’s primary, statute-based argument—that the panel erred in\n  ruling that it lacked jurisdiction over the cases—it reversed on the\n  ground that the NRAB’s proceedings were incompatible with due\n  process.\nHeld:\n    1. The Seventh Circuit erred in resolving the Union’s appeal under\n a constitutional, rather than a statutory, headline. This Court\n granted certiorari to address whether NRAB orders may be set aside\n                    Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)                        3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nfor failure to comply with due process notwithstanding §153 First\n(q)’s limited grounds for review. But so long as a respondent does not\n“seek to modify the judgment below,” true here, the respondent may\n“rely upon any matter appearing in the record in support of the\njudgment.” Blum v. Bacon, 457 U. S. 132, 137, n. 5. The Seventh\nCircuit understood that the Union had pressed “statutory and consti\ntutional” arguments, but observed that both arguments homed in on\na “single question”: is written documentation of the conference in the\non-property record a necessary prerequisite to NRAB arbitration?\nAnswering this “single question” in the negative, the Seventh Circuit\neffectively resolved the Union’s core complaint. Because nothing in\nthe Act elevates to jurisdictional status the obligation to conference\nminor disputes or to prove conferencing, a negative answer to the\n“single question” leaves no doubt about the Union’s entitlement, in\naccord with §153 First (q), to vacation of the Board’s orders. Given\nthis statutory ground for relief, there is no due process issue alive in\nthis case, and no warrant to answer a question that may be conse\nquential in another case. Nevertheless, the grant of certiorari here\nenables this Court to reduce confusion, clouding court as well as\nBoard decisions, over matters properly typed “jurisdictional.” Pp. 10–\n12.\n   2. Congress authorized the Board to prescribe rules for presenting\nand processing claims, §153 First (v), but Congress alone controls the\nBoard’s jurisdiction. By refusing to adjudicate the instant cases on\nthe false premise that it lacked “jurisdiction” to hear them, the NRAB\npanel failed “to conform, or confine itself, to matters [Congress\nplaced] within the scope of [NRAB] jurisdiction,” §153 First (q).\nPp. 12–17.\n      (a) Not all mandatory “prescriptions, however emphatic, ‘are . . .\nproperly typed “jurisdictional.” ’ ” Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S.\n500, 510. Subject-matter jurisdiction properly comprehended refers\nto a tribunal’s “ ‘power to hear a case,’ ” and “ ‘can never be forfeited or\nwaived.’ ” Id., at 514. In contrast, a “claim-processing rule” does not\nreduce a tribunal’s adjudicatory domain and is ordinarily “forfeited if\nthe party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.” Kon\ntrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 456. For example, this Court has held\nnonjurisdictional and forfeitable the provision in Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964 requiring complainants to file a timely discrimina\ntion charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n(EEOC) before proceeding to court, Zipes v. Trans World Airlines,\nInc., 455 U. S. 385, 393. In contrast, the Court has reaffirmed the ju\nrisdictional character of 28 U. S. C. §2107(a)’s time limitation for fil\ning a notice of appeal. Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, 209–211.\nHere, the requirement that parties to minor disputes, as a last\n  4   UNION PACIFIC R. CO. v. LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS AND\n          TRAINMEN GEN. COMM. OF ADJUSTMENT\n                          Syllabus\n\n  chance prearbitration, attempt settlement “in conference,” is imposed\n  on carriers and grievants alike, but satisfaction of that obligation\n  does not condition the Board’s adjudicatory authority, which extends\n  to “all disputes between carriers and their employees ‘growing out of\n  grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements\n  concerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions . . . ,’ ” Slocum v.\n  Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., 339 U. S. 239, 240 (quoting §153 First (i)).\n  When a CBA’s grievance procedure has not been followed, resort to\n  the Board would ordinarily be objectionable as premature, but the\n  conference requirement is independent of the CBA process. Rooted in\n  §152, the RLA’s “[g]eneral duties” section, and not moored to the\n  NRAB’s “[e]stablishment[,] . . . powers[,] and duties” set out in §153\n  First, conferencing is often informal in practice, and is no more “ju\n  risdictional” than is the presuit resort to the EEOC held nonjurisdic\n  tional and forfeitable in Zipes. And if the conference requirement is\n  not “jurisdictional,” then failure initially to submit proof of conferenc\n  ing cannot be of that genre. And although the Carrier alleges that\n  NRAB decisions support characterizing conferencing as jurisdic\n  tional, if the NRAB lacks authority to define its panels’ jurisdiction,\n  surely the panels themselves lack that authority. Furthermore,\n  NRAB panels have variously addressed the matter. Pp. 12–15.\n       (b) Neither the RLA nor Circular One could plausibly be read to\n  require, as a prerequisite to the NRAB’s exercise of jurisdiction, sub\n  mission of proof of conferencing. Instructions on party submissions\n  are claim-processing, not jurisdictional, rules. The Board itself has\n  recognized that conferencing may not be a “question in dispute,” and\n  when that is so, proof thereof need not accompany party submissions.\n  It makes sense to exclude at the arbitration stage newly presented\n  “data” supporting the employee’s grievance, 29 CFR §301(d)—\n  evidence the carrier had no opportunity to consider prearbitration.\n  But conferencing is not a fact bearing on the merits of a grievance.\n  Moreover, the RLA respects the parties’ right to order for themselves\n  the conference procedures they will follow.

We have no more right to decline the exercise\nof jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp that which is\nnot given.” Cohens v.

Marshall, 547 U. S. 293, 298–299 (2006).\nWhile Chief Justice Marshall’s statement bears “fine\ntuning,” there is surely a starting presumption that when\njurisdiction is conferred, a court may not decline to exer­\ncise it. See R. Fallon, J. Manning, D. Meltzer, & D.\nShapiro, Hart & Wechsler’s The Federal Courts and the\nFederal System 1061–1062 (6th ed. 2009). The general\nrule applicable to courts also holds for administrative\nagencies directed by Congress to adjudicate particular\ncontroversies.\n   Congress vested in the National Railroad Adjustment\nBoard (hereinafter NRAB or Board) jurisdiction to adjudi­\n 2   UNION PACIFIC R.

We consider in this case five nearly identical\ndecisions of a panel of the NRAB dismissing employee\nclaims “for lack of jurisdiction.” NRAB First Div. Award\nNo. 26089 etc. (Mar. 15, 2005), App. to Pet. for Cert.\n65a–107a, 69a (hereinafter Panel Decision). In each case,\nthe panel declared that a procedural rule raised by a\npanel member, unprompted by the parties, was “jurisdic­\ntional” in character and therefore commanded threshold\ndismissal.\n   The panel’s characterization, we hold, was misconceived.\nCongress authorized the Board to prescribe rules for the\npresentation and processing of claims, §153 First (v), but\nCongress alone controls the Board’s jurisdiction. By pre­\nsuming authority to declare procedural rules “jurisdic­\ntional,” the panel failed “to conform, or confine itself, to\nmatters [Congress placed] within the scope of [NRAB]\njurisdiction,” §153 First (q). Because the panel was not\n“without authority to assume jurisdiction over the [em­\nployees’] claim[s],” Panel Decision 72a, its dismissals\nlacked tenable grounding. We therefore affirm the judg­\nment of the Seventh Circuit setting aside the panel’s\norders.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n  Concerned that labor disputes would lead to strikes\nbringing railroads to a halt, Congress enacted the Railway\nLabor Act (RLA or Act), 44 Stat. 577, as amended, 45\nU.

Jacksonville Terminal Co.,\n394 U. S. 369, 377–378 (1969) (describing obligation to\npursue agreement as the “heart of the [RLA]”). As part of\nits endeavor, Congress provided a framework for the\nsettlement and voluntary arbitration of “minor disputes.”\nSee Price, 360 U. S., at 609–610. (In the railroad industry,\nthe term “minor disputes” means, primarily, “grievances\narising from the application of collective bargaining\nagreements to particular situations.” Id., at 609.)1\n   Many railroads, however, resisted voluntary arbitration.\nSee id., at 610. Congress therefore amended the Act in\n1934 (1934 Amendment) to mandate arbitration of minor\ndisputes; under the altered scheme, arbitration occurs\nbefore panels composed of two representatives of labor and\ntwo of industry, with a neutral referee serving as tie­\nbreaker. See id., at 610–613. To supply the representa­\ntive arbitrators, Congress established the NRAB, a board\nof 34 private persons representing labor and industry in\nequal numbers. §153 First (a); see Trainmen v. Chicago R.\n& I. R. Co., 353 U. S. 30, 36–37 (1957).2 Neutral referees,\nthe RLA provides, shall be appointed by the representa­\ntive arbitrators or, failing their agreement, by the Na­\ntional Mediation Board. §153 First (l).

They look to the\nacquisition of rights for the future, not to assertion of rights claimed to\nhave vested in the past.” Elgin, J. & E. R. Co. v. Burley, 325 U. S. 711,\n723 (1945).\n   2 The RLA divides the NRAB into four Divisions, each covering speci­\n\nfied classes of railroad employees. §153 First (h).\n  4   UNION PACIFIC R. CO. v.

See 45 U. S. C. §153 First\n(i). This stage of the dispute-resolution process is known\nas “on-property” proceedings. As a final prearbitration\nstep, the Act directs parties to attempt settlement “in\nconference” between designated representatives of the\ncarrier and the grievant-employee. §152 Second, Sixth.3\nThe RLA contains instructions concerning the place and\ntime of conferences, but specifies that the statute does not\n——————\n  3 Central to the instant controversy, §152 Second, Sixth read, in full:\n  “Second. Consideration of disputes by representatives.\n  All disputes between a carrier or carriers and its or their employees\nshall be considered, and, if possible, decided, with all expedition, in\nconference between representatives designated and authorized so to\nconfer, respectively, by the carrier or carriers and by the employees\nthereof interested in the dispute.”\n  “Sixth.

Arbi­\ntration is launched when the party referring the dispute\nfiles a notice of intent with the NRAB; after Board ac­\nknowledgment of the notice, the parties have 75 days to\nfile simultaneous submissions. NRAB, Uniform Rules of\nProcedure (rev. June 23, 2003).\n   In creating the scheme of mandatory arbitration super­\nintended by the NRAB, the 1934 Amendment largely\n“foreclose[d] litigation” over minor disputes. Price, 360\nU. S., at 616; see Railway Conductors v. Pitney, 326 U. S.\n561, 566 (1946) (“Not only has Congress . . . designated an\nagency peculiarly competent to handle [minor disputes],\nbut . . . it also intended to leave a minimum responsibility\nto the courts.”). Congress did provide that an employee\nwho obtained a monetary award against a carrier could\nsue to enforce it, and the court could either enforce the\naward or set it aside. Price, 360 U. S., at 616; 45 U. S. C.\n§153 First (p) (1934 ed.). In addition to that limited role,\nsome Courts of Appeals, we noted in Price, reviewed\nawards “claimed to result from a denial of due process of\nlaw.” 360 U. S., at 616 (citing Ellerd v.

The governing\nprovision, still in force, allows parties aggrieved by an\nNRAB panel order to petition for court review. 45 U. S. C.\n§153 First (q) (2006 ed.). The provision instructs that\n      “[o]n such review, the findings and order of the divi­\n      sion shall be conclusive on the parties, except that the\n      order . . . may be set aside, in whole or in part, or re­\n      manded . . . , for failure of the division to comply with\n      the requirements of [the RLA], for failure of the order\n      to conform, or confine itself, to matters within the\n      scope of the division’s jurisdiction, or for fraud or\n      corruption by a member of the division making the\n      order.”\nCourts of Appeals have divided on whether this provision\nprecludes judicial review of NRAB proceedings for due\nprocess violations. Compare, e.g., Shaffi v. PLC British\nAirways, 22 F. 3d 59, 64 (CA2 1994) (review available),\nand Edelman v. Western Airlines, Inc., 892 F. 2d 839, 847\n(CA9 1989) (same), with Kinross v. Utah R.

That case in­\nvolved an NRAB decision turning on a time limitation contained in the\ngoverning CBA. Based on that limitation, the Board dismissed an\nemployee’s claim. The Tenth Circuit remanded the case to the NRAB\non the ground that the Board had failed to consider the employee’s\nequitable tolling argument and thereby violated due process. We\nsummarily reversed, observing that the Board had in fact considered\nthe plea for equitable tolling and explicitly rejected it. Id., at 92. We\nadded that if the Court of Appeals “intended to reverse the [NRAB’s]\nrejection of [the employee’s] equitable tolling argument,” then the court\nhad exceeded the bounds §153 First (q) placed on its review authority.\nId., at 93. In determining whether the CBA’s time limitation was\ntolled, we said, the Board “certainly was acting within its jurisdiction\nand in conformity with . . . the Act.” Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

(hereinafter Carrier) charged five of its em­\nployees with disciplinary violations. Their union, the\nBrotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen\n(hereinafter Union), initiated grievance proceedings pur­\nsuant to the CBA. The Union asserts that, following\nexhaustion of grievance proceedings, the parties confer­\nenced all the disputes; counsel for the Carrier conceded at\nargument that at least two of the disputes were confer­\nenced, Tr. of Oral Arg. 7. Dissatisfied with the outcome of\nthe on-property proceedings, the Union sought arbitration\nbefore the First Division of the NRAB. The Union and the\nCarrier, from early 2002 through 2003, filed simultaneous\nsubmissions in the five cases. In each submission, the\nUnion included the notice of discipline (or discharge), the\nhearing transcript, and all exhibits and evidence relating\nto the underlying adverse actions used in the grievance\nproceeding. Neither party mentioned conferencing as a\ndisputed matter. Yet, in each case, both parties necessar­\nily knew whether the Union and the Carrier had con­\nferred, and the Board’s governing rule instructs carriers\nand employees to “set forth all relevant, argumentative\nfacts,” 29 CFR §301.5(d), (e).\n   On March 18, 2004, just prior to the hearing on the\nemployees’ claims, one of the industry representatives on\nthe arbitration panel raised an objection. Petition to\nReview and Vacate Awards and Orders of First Div.\nNRAB in No. 05–civ–2401 (ND Ill.), ¶20 (hereinafter Pet.\nto Review). On his own initiative, unprompted by the\nCarrier, and in executive session, the industry representa­\ntive asserted that the on-property record included no proof\nof conferencing. See ibid. The Carrier thereafter em­\nbraced the panel member’s objection. The neutral referee\ninformed the Union of the issue and adjourned the hear­\ning, allowing the Union “to submit evidence that confer­\n  8   UNION PACIFIC R. CO. v. LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS AND\n          TRAINMEN GEN. COMM. OF ADJUSTMENT\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nencing had in fact occurred.” See id., ¶¶21–23. The Union\ndid so, offering phone logs, handwritten notes, and corre­\nspondence between the parties as evidence of conferencing\nin each of the five cases. E.g., Panel Decision 67a–68a.\nFrom its first notice of the objection, however, the Union\nmaintained that the proof-of-conferencing issue was un­\ntimely raised, indeed forfeited, as the Carrier itself had\nnot objected prior to the date set for argument of the cases.\nE.g., id., at 67a; Pet. to Review ¶¶22, 29, 30, 54.\n  On March 15, 2005, nearly one year after the question of\nconferencing first arose, the panel, in five identical deci­\nsions, dismissed the petitions for want of “authority to\nassume jurisdiction over the claim[s].” Panel Decision\n72a. Citing Circular One, see supra, at 3–4, and “the\nweight of arbitral precedent,” the panel stated that “the\nevidentiary record” must be deemed “closed once a Notice\nof Intent has been filed with the NRAB . . . .” Panel Deci­\nsion 71a.5 In explaining why the record could not be sup­\nplemented to meet the no-proof-of-conferencing objection,\nthe panel emphasized that it was “an appellate tribunal,\nas opposed to one which is empowered to consider and rule\non de novo evidence and arguments.” Id., at 69a.\n  The two labor representatives dissented. The Carrier’s\nsubmissions, they reasoned, took no exception based on\nfailure to conference or to prove conferencing; therefore,\nthey concluded, under a “well settled principle governing\nthe Board’s deliberations,” the Carrier had forfeited the\nissue. Id., at 105a–106a. The dissenters urged that the\nUnion had furnished evidence showing “the cases had all\nbeen conferenced, even though the relevant Collective\nBargaining Agreement [did] not require [conferencing].”\nId., at 105a. Dismissal of the claims, the dissenters\n——————\n  5 The panel observed, however, that the records and notes offered by\n\nthe Union, “on their face, may be regarded as supportive of its position\nthat the conference[s] occurred.” Panel Decision 69a.\n                  Cite as: 558 U.

Nothing in the\nAct or the NRAB’s procedural rules, the Union main­\ntained, mandated dismissal for failure to allege and prove\nconferencing in the Union’s original submission. Id., ¶¶3,\n4. By imposing, without warrant, “a technical pleading or\nevidentiary requirement” and elevating it to jurisdictional\nstatus, the Union charged, the panel had “egregiously\nviolate[d] the Act,” id., ¶3, or “fail[ed] to conform its juris­\ndiction to that required by . . . law,” id., ¶4. Alternatively,\nthe Union asserted that the panel violated procedural due\nprocess by entertaining the Carrier’s untimely objection,\neven though “the Carrier had failed to raise any objection\nas to lack of conferencing” in its submissions. Id., ¶5.\n  The District Court affirmed the Board’s orders. Ad­\ndressing the Union’s argument that the no-proof-of­\nconferencing issue was untimely raised, the court accepted\nthe panel’s description of the issue as “jurisdictional,” and\nnoted the familiar proposition that jurisdictional chal­\nlenges may be raised at any stage of the proceedings. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2414172\"><a href=\"/opinion/2414172/blet-v-union-pacific-rr/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

It then determined that there was no such prerequi­\nsite: “[N]o statute, regulation, or CBA,” the court con­\ncluded, “required the evidence [of conferencing] to be\npresented in the on-property record.” Id., at 757–758. But\ninstead of resting its decision on the Union’s primary,\nstatute-based argument—that the panel erred in ruling\nthat it lacked jurisdiction over the cases—the Court of\nAppeals reversed on the ground that the NRAB’s proceed­\nings were incompatible with due process. See id., at 750.\n                             II\n  We granted the Carrier’s petition for certiorari, 555\nU. S. ___ (2009), which asked us to determine whether a\nreviewing court may set aside NRAB orders for failure to\ncomply with due process notwithstanding the limited\ngrounds for review specified in §153 First (q).6 As earlier\nrecounted, Courts of Appeals have divided on this issue.\nSee supra, at 6, and n. 4. Appearing as respondent in this\nCourt, however, the Union urged affirmance of the Sev­\nenth Circuit’s judgment on an alternative ground. Reas­\nserting the lead argument it had advanced in its petition\nfor court review, see supra, at 9, the Union maintained\nthat the Board did not “conform, or confine itself, to mat­\nters within the scope of [its] jurisdiction,” §153 First (q).\nBrief for Respondent 52–53. In response, the Carrier\nstated that the Union’s alternative ground “presents a\npure question of law that th[e] Court can and should\nresolve without need for remand.” Reply Brief 24, n. 9.\nWe agree.\n  So long as a respondent does not “seek to modify the\njudgment below,” true here, “[i]t is well accepted” that the\n——————\n  6 Quoted supra, at 6, those grounds are “failure of the division to\n\ncomply with [RLA] requirements,” “failure of the order to conform, or\nconfine itself, to matters within the scope of the division’s jurisdiction,”\nand “fraud or corruption by a member of the division making the\norder.”\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrespondent may, “without filing a cross-appeal or cross­\npetition, . . . rely upon any matter appearing in the record\nin support of the judgment.” Blum v. Bacon, 457 U. S.\n132, 137, n. 5 (1982). The Seventh Circuit, as just ob­\nserved, see supra, at 9–10, understood that the Union had\npressed “statutory and constitutional” arguments, but also\ncomprehended that both arguments homed in on “a single\nquestion: is written documentation of the conference in the\non-property record a necessary prerequisite to arbitration\nbefore the NRAB?” 522 F. 3d, at 750. Answering this\n“single question” in the negative, the Court of Appeals\neffectively resolved the Union’s core complaint. But, for\nreasons far from apparent, the court declared that “once\nwe answer the key question . . . , adjudication of the due\nprocess claim is unavoidable.” Ibid.\n   The Seventh Circuit, we agree, asked the right question,\nbut inappropriately placed its answer under a constitu­\ntional, rather than a statutory, headline. As the Court of\nAppeals determined, and as we discuss infra, at 12–17,\nnothing in the Act elevates to jurisdictional status the\nobligation to conference minor disputes or to prove confer­\nencing. That being so, the “unavoidable” conclusion,\nfollowing from the Seventh Circuit’s “answer [to] the key\nquestion,” 522 F. 3d, at 750, is that the panel, in §153\nFirst (q)’s words, failed “to conform, or confine itself, to\nmatters within the scope of [its] jurisdiction.” The Carrier,\nalthough it sought a different outcome, was quite right to\n“urg[e] [the Court of Appeals] to consider the statutory\nclaim before the constitutional one.” 522 F. 3d, at 750.\n   In short, a negative answer to the “single question”\nidentified by the Court of Appeals leaves no doubt about\nthe Union’s entitlement, in accord with §153 First (q), to\nvacation of the Board’s orders. Given this statutory\nground for relief, there is no due process issue alive in this\ncase, and no warrant to answer a question that may be\nconsequential in another case: Absent grounds specified in\n  12 UNION PACIFIC R.

OF ADJUSTMENT \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\n§153 First (q) for vacating a Board order, may a reviewing\ncourt set aside an NRAB adjudication for incompatibility\nwith due process? An answer to that question must await\na case in which the issue is genuinely in controversy.7 In\nthis case, however, our grant of certiorari enables us to\naddress a matter of some importance: We can reduce\nconfusion, clouding court as well as Board decisions, over\nmatters properly typed “jurisdictional.”\n                              III \n\n                               A\n\n   Recognizing that the word “jurisdiction” has been used\nby courts, including this Court, to convey “many, too\nmany, meanings,” Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environ\nment, 523 U. S. 83, 90 (1998) (internal quotation marks\nomitted), we have cautioned, in recent decisions, against\nprofligate use of the term. Not all mandatory “prescrip­\ntions, however emphatic, are . . . properly typed jurisdic­\ntional,” we explained in Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S.\n500, 510 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Sub­\nject-matter jurisdiction properly comprehended, we em­\nphasized, refers to a tribunal’s “power to hear a case,” a\nmatter that “can never be forfeited or waived.” Id., at 514\n(quoting United States v. Cotton, 535 U. S. 625, 630\n(2002)). In contrast, a “claim-processing rule, . . . even if\nunalterable on a party’s application,” does not reduce the\nadjudicatory domain of a tribunal and is ordinarily “for­\nfeited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise\nthe point.” Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 456 (2004).\n\n——————\n  7 A case of that order would be uncommon. As the Carrier acknowl­\n\nedges, “many of the cases reviewing ostensibly extra-statutory due\nprocess objections could have been accommodated within the statutory\nframework.” Brief for Petitioner 36. See also id., at 37 (“The statutory\nreview provisions are plainly generous enough to permit litigants to\nraise all of the simple, common, easily adjudicated, and likely to be\nmeritorious claims that sail under the flag of due process of law . . . .”).\n                  Cite as: 558 U.

S. C. §2000e et seq., requiring complainants to\nfile a timely charge of discrimination with the Equal Em­\nployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) before pro­\nceeding to court. Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455\nU. S. 385, 393 (1982). We have also held nonjurisdictional\nand forfeitable the Title VII provision exempting employ­\ners who engage fewer than 15 employees. Arbaugh, 546\nU. S., at 503, 515–516. And we have determined that a\nChapter 7 trustee’s (or creditor’s) limited time to object to\nthe debtor’s discharge, see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4004, is\na claim-processing, not a jurisdictional, matter. Kontrick,\n540 U. S., at 446–447, 460. In contrast, relying on a long\nline of this Court’s decisions left undisturbed by Congress,\nwe have reaffirmed the jurisdictional character of the time\nlimitation for filing a notice of appeal stated in 28 U. S. C.\n§2107(a). Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, 209–211\n(2007). See also John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United\nStates, 552 U. S. 130, 132 (2008) (court must consider\nsua sponte timeliness of lawsuit filed against the United\nStates in the Court of Federal Claims).\n   With these decisions in mind, we turn back to the re­\nquirement that parties to minor disputes, as a last chance\nprearbitration, attempt settlement “in conference,” 45\nU. S. C. §152 Second, Sixth. See supra, at 4–5, and n. 3.\nThis obligation is imposed on carriers and grievants alike\nbut, we hold, its satisfaction does not condition the adjudi­\ncatory authority of the Board.\n   The Board’s jurisdiction extends to “all disputes between\ncarriers and their employees ‘growing out of grievances or\nout of the interpretation or application of agreements\nconcerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions . . . .’ ”\nSlocum v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., 339 U. S. 239, 240\n(1950) (quoting §153 First (i)). True, the RLA instructs\nthat, before any reference to arbitration, the dispute “shall\n  14 UNION PACIFIC R. CO. v. LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS AND \n\n         TRAINMEN GEN. COMM. OF ADJUSTMENT \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nbe handled in the usual manner up to and including the\n[designated] chief operating officer.” §153 First (i). And\nwhen the CBA’s grievance procedure has not been fol­\nlowed, resort to the Board would ordinarily be objection­\nable as premature.\n   The additional requirement of a conference, we note, is\nindependent of the CBA process. Rather, the conference\nrequirement is stated in the “[g]eneral duties” section of\nthe RLA, §152, a section that is not moored to the\n“[e]stablishment[,] . . . powers[,] and duties” of the NRAB\nset out next in §153 First. Rooted in §152 and often in­\nformal in practice, see supra, at 4–5, conferencing is surely\nno more “jurisdictional” than is the presuit resort to the\nEEOC held forfeitable in Zipes, 455 U. S., at 393.8 And if\nthe requirement to conference is not “jurisdictional,” then\nfailure initially to submit proof of conferencing cannot be\nof that genre. See Part III–B, infra.\n   In defense of the Board’s characterization of conferenc­\ning and proof thereof as jurisdictional, the Carrier points\nto the NRAB’s Circular One procedural regulations, see\nsupra, at 3–4, which provide: “No petition shall be consid­\nered by any division of the Board unless the subject mat­\nter has been handled in accordance with the provisions of\nthe [RLA].” 29 CFR §301.2(b). But that provision, as\nother prescriptions in Circular One, is a claims-processing\nrule. Congress gave the Board no authority to adopt rules\nof jurisdictional dimension. See 45 U. S. C. §153 First (v)\n(authorizing the NRAB to “adopt such rules as it deems\nnecessary to control proceedings before the respective\n——————\n  8 The RLA states, in §152 First, a general duty “to settle all disputes,”\n\nand, in §152 Second, a more specific duty to “conference.” These provi­\nsions apply to all disputes in the railroad industry, major as well as\nminor. They also apply to disputes in the airline industry, over which\nthe NRAB has no jurisdiction. §181. Neither provision “speak[s] in\njurisdictional terms or refer[s] in any way to the jurisdiction of the”\nNRAB. Zipes, 455 U. S., at 394.\n                  Cite as: 558 U.

And when the fact of conferencing is genuinely\ncontested, we see no reason why the panel could not ad­\njourn the proceeding pending cure of any lapse. Circular\nOne does not exclude such a sensible solution.\n   The Carrier cites NRAB decisions that allegedly support\ncharacterization of conferencing as jurisdictional. If the\nNRAB lacks authority to define the jurisdiction of its\npanels, however, surely the panels themselves lack that\nauthority. Furthermore, NRAB panels have variously\naddressed the matter. For example, in NRAB Third Div.\nAward No. 15880 (Oct. 26, 1967), the panel, although\ncharacterizing the conferencing requirement as “jurisdic­\ntional,” said that “[i]f one of the parties refuses or fails to\navail itself of a conference where there is an opportunity to\ndo so, it cannot then assert the defense of a lack of juris­\ndiction.” Id., at 2. See also NRAB Fourth Div. Award No.\n5074 (June 21, 2001) (same); NRAB Third Div. Award No.\n28147 (Oct. 16, 1989) (same). Cf. Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at\n511 (“unrefined” uses of the word “jurisdiction” are enti­\ntled to “no precedential effect” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). And in NRAB First Div. Award No. 23867, p. 5\n(Apr. 7, 1988), the panel observed that the ordinary rem­\nedy for lack of conferencing is to “dismiss th[e] claim with­\nout prejudice to allow Claimant to cure the jurisdictional\ndefect.” That panel reached the merits nevertheless. Ibid.\nCf. Steel Co., 523 U. S., at 94 (“Jurisdiction is power to\ndeclare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only\nfunction remaining to the [tribunal] is that of announcing\nthe fact and dismissing the cause” (quoting Ex parte\nMcCardle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88034\"><a href=\"/opinion/88034/ex-parte-mccardle/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 514 (1869)).).

Circular One correspondingly instructs\nemployees seeking Board adjudication “[to] set forth all\nrelevant, argumentative facts” and “affirmatively show the\nsame to have been presented to the carrier and made a\npart of the particular question in dispute.” 29 CFR\n§301.5(d); see §301.5(e) (similar instruction addressed to\ncarriers). Conferencing, the Carrier urged, is a “relevant,\nargumentative fac[t],” so proof thereof must accompany\nparty submissions.\n   As earlier explained, see supra, at 14, instructions on\nparty submissions—essentially pleading instructions—are\nclaim-processing, not jurisdictional, rules. Moreover, the\nBoard itself has recognized that conferencing may not be a\n“question in dispute.” It has counseled parties submitting\njoint exhibits “to omit documents that are unimportant\nand/or irrelevant to the disposition of the [case]; for exam­\nple . . . letters requesting a conference (assuming that is\nnot an issue in the dispute).” NRAB Instructions Sheet,\nJoint Exh.

It bears repetition here that neither the Union nor\nthe Carrier, in its submissions to the Board, identified\nconferencing as a “question in dispute.” See supra, at 7.\n   It makes sense to exclude at the arbitration stage newly\npresented “data . . . in support of [the] employee[’s] [griev­\nance],” 29 CFR §301.5(d)—evidence the carrier had no\nopportunity to consider prearbitration. A contrary rule\nwould sandbag the carrier. But conferencing is not a fact\nbearing on the merits of a grievance. Indeed, there may be\nno disagreement at all about the occurrence of conferenc­\ning, as the Union believed to be the case here. Moreover,\nthe RLA respects the right of the parties to order for\nthemselves the conference procedures they will follow.\nSee 45 U. S. C. §152 Sixth (“[N]othing in this chapter shall\nbe construed to supersede the provisions of any agreement\n(as to conferences) . . . in effect between the parties.”). In\nsum, neither the RLA nor Circular One could plausibly be\nread to require, as a prerequisite to the NRAB’s exercise of\njurisdiction, submission of proof of conferencing.\n                        *     *    *\n   By refusing to adjudicate cases on the false premise that\nit lacked power to hear them, the NRAB panel failed “to\nconform, or confine itself,” to the jurisdiction Congress\ngave it.

Argued October 7, 2009—Decided December 8, 2009\nThe Railway Labor Act (RLA or Act) was enacted to promote peaceful\n  and efficient resolution of labor disputes. As amended, the Act man\n  dates arbitration of “minor disputes” before panels composed of two\n  representatives of labor and two of industry, with a neutral referee as\n  tiebreaker. Union Pacific R. Co. v. Price, 360 U. S. 601, 610–613. To\n  supply arbitrators, Congress established the National Railroad Ad\n  justment Board (NRAB or Board), a board of 34 private persons rep\n  resenting labor and industry in equal numbers. 45 U. S. C. §153\n  First (a). Before resorting to arbitration, employees and carriers\n  must exhaust the grievance procedures in their collective-bargaining\n  agreement (hereinafter CBA), see §153 First (i), a stage known as\n  “on-property” proceedings. As a final prearbitration step, the parties\n  must attempt settlement “in conference” between representatives of\n  the carrier and the grievant-employee. §152 Second, Sixth. The RLA\n  contains instructions concerning the place and time of conferences,\n  but does not “supersede the provisions of any agreement (as to con\n  ferences) . . . between the parties,” §152 Sixth; in common practice\n  the conference may be as informal as a telephone conversation. If the\n  parties fail to achieve resolution, either may refer the matter to the\n  NRAB. §153 First (i). Submissions to the Board must include “a full\n  statement of the facts and all supporting data bearing upon the dis\n  putes.” Ibid. Parties may seek court review of an NRAB panel order\n  on one or more stated grounds: “failure . . . to comply with the re\n  quirements of [the RLA], . . . failure of the order to conform, or con\n  2   UNION PACIFIC R.

Courts of Appeals have divided on whether, in\n  addition to the statutory grounds for judicial review stated in §153\n  First (q), courts may review NRAB proceedings for due process viola\n  tions.\n      After petitioner Union Pacific Railroad Co. (hereinafter Carrier)\n  charged five of its employees with disciplinary violations, their union\n  (hereinafter Union) initiated grievance proceedings pursuant to the\n  CBA. The Union asserts that the parties conferenced all five dis\n  putes and the Carrier concedes that they conferenced at least two.\n  Dissatisfied with the outcome of the on-property proceedings, the Un\n  ion sought arbitration before the NRAB’s First Division. Both parties\n  filed submissions in the five cases, but neither mentioned conferenc\n  ing as a disputed matter. Yet, in each case, both parties necessarily\n  knew whether the Union and the Carrier had conferred; and the\n  Board’s governing rule, published in Circular One, which prescribes\n  Board procedures, instructs carriers and employees to “set forth all\n  relevant, argumentative facts,” 29 CFR §301.5(d), (e). Just prior to\n  the hearing, one of the arbitration panel’s industry representatives\n  objected, sua sponte, that the on-property record included no proof of\n  conferencing. The Carrier thereafter embraced that objection. The\n  referee allowed the Union to submit evidence of conferencing. The\n  Union did so, but it maintained that the proof-of-conferencing issue\n  was untimely raised, indeed forfeited, as the Carrier had not objected\n  before the date set for argument. The panel, in five identical deci\n  sions, dismissed the petitions for want of jurisdiction. The record\n  could not be supplemented to meet the no-proof-of-conferencing objec\n  tion, the panel reasoned, for as an appellate tribunal, the panel was\n  not empowered to consider de novo evidence and arguments. The Un\n  ion sought review in the Federal District Court, which affirmed the\n  Board’s decision. On appeal, the Seventh Circuit observed that the\n  “single question” at issue was whether written documentation of the\n  conference in the on-property record was a necessary prerequisite to\n  NRAB arbitration, and determined that there was no such prerequi\n  site in the statute or rules. But instead of resting its decision on the\n  Union’s primary, statute-based argument—that the panel erred in\n  ruling that it lacked jurisdiction over the cases—it reversed on the\n  ground that the NRAB’s proceedings were incompatible with due\n  process.\nHeld:\n    1. The Seventh Circuit erred in resolving the Union’s appeal under\n a constitutional, rather than a statutory, headline. This Court\n granted certiorari to address whether NRAB orders may be set aside\n                    Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)                        3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nfor failure to comply with due process notwithstanding §153 First\n(q)’s limited grounds for review. But so long as a respondent does not\n“seek to modify the judgment below,” true here, the respondent may\n“rely upon any matter appearing in the record in support of the\njudgment.” Blum v. Bacon, 457 U. S. 132, 137, n. 5. The Seventh\nCircuit understood that the Union had pressed “statutory and consti\ntutional” arguments, but observed that both arguments homed in on\na “single question”: is written documentation of the conference in the\non-property record a necessary prerequisite to NRAB arbitration?\nAnswering this “single question” in the negative, the Seventh Circuit\neffectively resolved the Union’s core complaint. Because nothing in\nthe Act elevates to jurisdictional status the obligation to conference\nminor disputes or to prove conferencing, a negative answer to the\n“single question” leaves no doubt about the Union’s entitlement, in\naccord with §153 First (q), to vacation of the Board’s orders. Given\nthis statutory ground for relief, there is no due process issue alive in\nthis case, and no warrant to answer a question that may be conse\nquential in another case. Nevertheless, the grant of certiorari here\nenables this Court to reduce confusion, clouding court as well as\nBoard decisions, over matters properly typed “jurisdictional.” Pp. 10–\n12.\n   2. Congress authorized the Board to prescribe rules for presenting\nand processing claims, §153 First (v), but Congress alone controls the\nBoard’s jurisdiction. By refusing to adjudicate the instant cases on\nthe false premise that it lacked “jurisdiction” to hear them, the NRAB\npanel failed “to conform, or confine itself, to matters [Congress\nplaced] within the scope of [NRAB] jurisdiction,” §153 First (q).\nPp. 12–17.\n      (a) Not all mandatory “prescriptions, however emphatic, ‘are . . .\nproperly typed “jurisdictional.” ’ ” Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S.\n500, 510. Subject-matter jurisdiction properly comprehended refers\nto a tribunal’s “ ‘power to hear a case,’ ” and “ ‘can never be forfeited or\nwaived.’ ” Id., at 514. In contrast, a “claim-processing rule” does not\nreduce a tribunal’s adjudicatory domain and is ordinarily “forfeited if\nthe party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.” Kon\ntrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 456. For example, this Court has held\nnonjurisdictional and forfeitable the provision in Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964 requiring complainants to file a timely discrimina\ntion charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n(EEOC) before proceeding to court, Zipes v. Trans World Airlines,\nInc., 455 U. S. 385, 393. In contrast, the Court has reaffirmed the ju\nrisdictional character of 28 U. S. C. §2107(a)’s time limitation for fil\ning a notice of appeal. Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, 209–211.\nHere, the requirement that parties to minor disputes, as a last\n  4   UNION PACIFIC R. CO. v. LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS AND\n          TRAINMEN GEN. COMM. OF ADJUSTMENT\n                          Syllabus\n\n  chance prearbitration, attempt settlement “in conference,” is imposed\n  on carriers and grievants alike, but satisfaction of that obligation\n  does not condition the Board’s adjudicatory authority, which extends\n  to “all disputes between carriers and their employees ‘growing out of\n  grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements\n  concerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions . . . ,’ ” Slocum v.\n  Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., 339 U. S. 239, 240 (quoting §153 First (i)).\n  When a CBA’s grievance procedure has not been followed, resort to\n  the Board would ordinarily be objectionable as premature, but the\n  conference requirement is independent of the CBA process. Rooted in\n  §152, the RLA’s “[g]eneral duties” section, and not moored to the\n  NRAB’s “[e]stablishment[,] . . . powers[,] and duties” set out in §153\n  First, conferencing is often informal in practice, and is no more “ju\n  risdictional” than is the presuit resort to the EEOC held nonjurisdic\n  tional and forfeitable in Zipes. And if the conference requirement is\n  not “jurisdictional,” then failure initially to submit proof of conferenc\n  ing cannot be of that genre. And although the Carrier alleges that\n  NRAB decisions support characterizing conferencing as jurisdic\n  tional, if the NRAB lacks authority to define its panels’ jurisdiction,\n  surely the panels themselves lack that authority. Furthermore,\n  NRAB panels have variously addressed the matter. Pp. 12–15.\n       (b) Neither the RLA nor Circular One could plausibly be read to\n  require, as a prerequisite to the NRAB’s exercise of jurisdiction, sub\n  mission of proof of conferencing. Instructions on party submissions\n  are claim-processing, not jurisdictional, rules. The Board itself has\n  recognized that conferencing may not be a “question in dispute,” and\n  when that is so, proof thereof need not accompany party submissions.\n  It makes sense to exclude at the arbitration stage newly presented\n  “data” supporting the employee’s grievance, 29 CFR §301(d)—\n  evidence the carrier had no opportunity to consider prearbitration.\n  But conferencing is not a fact bearing on the merits of a grievance.\n  Moreover, the RLA respects the parties’ right to order for themselves\n  the conference procedures they will follow.

We have no more right to decline the exercise\nof jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp that which is\nnot given.” Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404 (1821);\nsee Marshall v. Marshall, 547 U. S. 293, 298–299 (2006).\nWhile Chief Justice Marshall’s statement bears “fine\ntuning,” there is surely a starting presumption that when\njurisdiction is conferred, a court may not decline to exer­\ncise it. See R. Fallon, J. Manning, D. Meltzer, & D.\nShapiro, Hart & Wechsler’s The Federal Courts and the\nFederal System 1061–1062 (6th ed. 2009). The general\nrule applicable to courts also holds for administrative\nagencies directed by Congress to adjudicate particular\ncontroversies.\n   Congress vested in the National Railroad Adjustment\nBoard (hereinafter NRAB or Board) jurisdiction to adjudi­\n 2   UNION PACIFIC R.

We consider in this case five nearly identical\ndecisions of a panel of the NRAB dismissing employee\nclaims “for lack of jurisdiction.” NRAB First Div. Award\nNo. 26089 etc. (Mar. 15, 2005), App. to Pet. for Cert.\n65a–107a, 69a (hereinafter Panel Decision). In each case,\nthe panel declared that a procedural rule raised by a\npanel member, unprompted by the parties, was “jurisdic­\ntional” in character and therefore commanded threshold\ndismissal.\n   The panel’s characterization, we hold, was misconceived.\nCongress authorized the Board to prescribe rules for the\npresentation and processing of claims, §153 First (v), but\nCongress alone controls the Board’s jurisdiction. By pre­\nsuming authority to declare procedural rules “jurisdic­\ntional,” the panel failed “to conform, or confine itself, to\nmatters [Congress placed] within the scope of [NRAB]\njurisdiction,” §153 First (q). Because the panel was not\n“without authority to assume jurisdiction over the [em­\nployees’] claim[s],” Panel Decision 72a, its dismissals\nlacked tenable grounding. We therefore affirm the judg­\nment of the Seventh Circuit setting aside the panel’s\norders.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n  Concerned that labor disputes would lead to strikes\nbringing railroads to a halt, Congress enacted the Railway\nLabor Act (RLA or Act), 44 Stat. 577, as amended, 45\nU.

Jacksonville Terminal Co.,\n394 U. S. 369, 377–378 (1969) (describing obligation to\npursue agreement as the “heart of the [RLA]”). As part of\nits endeavor, Congress provided a framework for the\nsettlement and voluntary arbitration of “minor disputes.”\nSee Price, 360 U. S., at 609–610. (In the railroad industry,\nthe term “minor disputes” means, primarily, “grievances\narising from the application of collective bargaining\nagreements to particular situations.” Id., at 609.)1\n   Many railroads, however, resisted voluntary arbitration.\nSee id., at 610. Congress therefore amended the Act in\n1934 (1934 Amendment) to mandate arbitration of minor\ndisputes; under the altered scheme, arbitration occurs\nbefore panels composed of two representatives of labor and\ntwo of industry, with a neutral referee serving as tie­\nbreaker. See id., at 610–613. To supply the representa­\ntive arbitrators, Congress established the NRAB, a board\nof 34 private persons representing labor and industry in\nequal numbers. §153 First (a); see Trainmen v. Chicago R.\n& I. R. Co., 353 U. S. 30, 36–37 (1957).2 Neutral referees,\nthe RLA provides, shall be appointed by the representa­\ntive arbitrators or, failing their agreement, by the Na­\ntional Mediation Board. §153 First (l).

S. 711,\n723 (1945).\n   2 The RLA divides the NRAB into four Divisions, each covering speci­\n\nfied classes of railroad employees. §153 First (h).\n  4   UNION PACIFIC R. CO. v.

See 45 U. S. C. §153 First\n(i). This stage of the dispute-resolution process is known\nas “on-property” proceedings. As a final prearbitration\nstep, the Act directs parties to attempt settlement “in\nconference” between designated representatives of the\ncarrier and the grievant-employee. §152 Second, Sixth.3\nThe RLA contains instructions concerning the place and\ntime of conferences, but specifies that the statute does not\n——————\n  3 Central to the instant controversy, §152 Second, Sixth read, in full:\n  “Second.

Arbi­\ntration is launched when the party referring the dispute\nfiles a notice of intent with the NRAB; after Board ac­\nknowledgment of the notice, the parties have 75 days to\nfile simultaneous submissions. NRAB, Uniform Rules of\nProcedure (rev. June 23, 2003).\n   In creating the scheme of mandatory arbitration super­\nintended by the NRAB, the 1934 Amendment largely\n“foreclose[d] litigation” over minor disputes. Price, 360\nU. S., at 616; see Railway Conductors v. Pitney, 326 U. S.\n561, 566 (1946) (“Not only has Congress . . . designated an\nagency peculiarly competent to handle [minor disputes],\nbut . . . it also intended to leave a minimum responsibility\nto the courts.”). Congress did provide that an employee\nwho obtained a monetary award against a carrier could\nsue to enforce it, and the court could either enforce the\naward or set it aside. Price, 360 U. S., at 616; 45 U. S. C.\n§153 First (p) (1934 ed.). In addition to that limited role,\nsome Courts of Appeals, we noted in Price, reviewed\nawards “claimed to result from a denial of due process of\nlaw.” 360 U. S., at 616 (citing Ellerd v.

The governing\nprovision, still in force, allows parties aggrieved by an\nNRAB panel order to petition for court review. 45 U. S. C.\n§153 First (q) (2006 ed.). The provision instructs that\n      “[o]n such review, the findings and order of the divi­\n      sion shall be conclusive on the parties, except that the\n      order . . . may be set aside, in whole or in part, or re­\n      manded . . . , for failure of the division to comply with\n      the requirements of [the RLA], for failure of the order\n      to conform, or confine itself, to matters within the\n      scope of the division’s jurisdiction, or for fraud or\n      corruption by a member of the division making the\n      order.”\nCourts of Appeals have divided on whether this provision\nprecludes judicial review of NRAB proceedings for due\nprocess violations. Compare, e.g., Shaffi v. PLC British\nAirways, 22 F. 3d 59, 64 (CA2 1994) (review available),\nand Edelman v. Western Airlines, Inc., 892 F. 2d 839, 847\n(CA9 1989) (same), with Kinross v. Utah R.

That case in­\nvolved an NRAB decision turning on a time limitation contained in the\ngoverning CBA. Based on that limitation, the Board dismissed an\nemployee’s claim. The Tenth Circuit remanded the case to the NRAB\non the ground that the Board had failed to consider the employee’s\nequitable tolling argument and thereby violated due process. We\nsummarily reversed, observing that the Board had in fact considered\nthe plea for equitable tolling and explicitly rejected it. Id., at 92. We\nadded that if the Court of Appeals “intended to reverse the [NRAB’s]\nrejection of [the employee’s] equitable tolling argument,” then the court\nhad exceeded the bounds §153 First (q) placed on its review authority.\nId., at 93.

Dissatisfied with the outcome of\nthe on-property proceedings, the Union sought arbitration\nbefore the First Division of the NRAB. The Union and the\nCarrier, from early 2002 through 2003, filed simultaneous\nsubmissions in the five cases. In each submission, the\nUnion included the notice of discipline (or discharge), the\nhearing transcript, and all exhibits and evidence relating\nto the underlying adverse actions used in the grievance\nproceeding. Neither party mentioned conferencing as a\ndisputed matter. Yet, in each case, both parties necessar­\nily knew whether the Union and the Carrier had con­\nferred, and the Board’s governing rule instructs carriers\nand employees to “set forth all relevant, argumentative\nfacts,” 29 CFR §301.5(d), (e).\n   On March 18, 2004, just prior to the hearing on the\nemployees’ claims, one of the industry representatives on\nthe arbitration panel raised an objection. Petition to\nReview and Vacate Awards and Orders of First Div.\nNRAB in No. 05–civ–2401 (ND Ill.), ¶20 (hereinafter Pet.\nto Review). On his own initiative, unprompted by the\nCarrier, and in executive session, the industry representa­\ntive asserted that the on-property record included no proof\nof conferencing. See ibid. The Carrier thereafter em­\nbraced the panel member’s objection. The neutral referee\ninformed the Union of the issue and adjourned the hear­\ning, allowing the Union “to submit evidence that confer­\n  8   UNION PACIFIC R. CO. v. LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS AND\n          TRAINMEN GEN. COMM. OF ADJUSTMENT\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nencing had in fact occurred.” See id., ¶¶21–23. The Union\ndid so, offering phone logs, handwritten notes, and corre­\nspondence between the parties as evidence of conferencing\nin each of the five cases. E.g., Panel Decision 67a–68a.\nFrom its first notice of the objection, however, the Union\nmaintained that the proof-of-conferencing issue was un­\ntimely raised, indeed forfeited, as the Carrier itself had\nnot objected prior to the date set for argument of the cases.\nE.g., id., at 67a; Pet. to Review ¶¶22, 29, 30, 54.\n  On March 15, 2005, nearly one year after the question of\nconferencing first arose, the panel, in five identical deci­\nsions, dismissed the petitions for want of “authority to\nassume jurisdiction over the claim[s].” Panel Decision\n72a. Citing Circular One, see supra, at 3–4, and “the\nweight of arbitral precedent,” the panel stated that “the\nevidentiary record” must be deemed “closed once a Notice\nof Intent has been filed with the NRAB . . . .” Panel Deci­\nsion 71a.5 In explaining why the record could not be sup­\nplemented to meet the no-proof-of-conferencing objection,\nthe panel emphasized that it was “an appellate tribunal,\nas opposed to one which is empowered to consider and rule\non de novo evidence and arguments.” Id., at 69a.\n  The two labor representatives dissented. The Carrier’s\nsubmissions, they reasoned, took no exception based on\nfailure to conference or to prove conferencing; therefore,\nthey concluded, under a “well settled principle governing\nthe Board’s deliberations,” the Carrier had forfeited the\nissue. Id., at 105a–106a. The dissenters urged that the\nUnion had furnished evidence showing “the cases had all\nbeen conferenced, even though the relevant Collective\nBargaining Agreement [did] not require [conferencing].”\nId., at 105a. Dismissal of the claims, the dissenters\n——————\n  5 The panel observed, however, that the records and notes offered by\n\nthe Union, “on their face, may be regarded as supportive of its position\nthat the conference[s] occurred.” Panel Decision 69a.\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)              9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncharged, demonstrated “the kind of gamesmanship that\nbreeds contempt for the minor dispute process.” Id., at\n107a.\n  The Union filed a petition for review in the United\nStates District Court for the Northern District of Illinois,\nasking the court to set aside the Board’s orders on the\nground that the panel had “unlawfully held [it lacked]\nauthority to assume jurisdiction over [the] cases [absent]\nevidence of a ‘conference’ between the parties in the . . .\n‘on-property’ record.” Pet. to Review ¶1. Nothing in the\nAct or the NRAB’s procedural rules, the Union main­\ntained, mandated dismissal for failure to allege and prove\nconferencing in the Union’s original submission. Id., ¶¶3,\n4. By imposing, without warrant, “a technical pleading or\nevidentiary requirement” and elevating it to jurisdictional\nstatus, the Union charged, the panel had “egregiously\nviolate[d] the Act,” id., ¶3, or “fail[ed] to conform its juris­\ndiction to that required by . . . law,” id., ¶4. Alternatively,\nthe Union asserted that the panel violated procedural due\nprocess by entertaining the Carrier’s untimely objection,\neven though “the Carrier had failed to raise any objection\nas to lack of conferencing” in its submissions. Id., ¶5.\n  The District Court affirmed the Board’s orders. Ad­\ndressing the Union’s argument that the no-proof-of­\nconferencing issue was untimely raised, the court accepted\nthe panel’s description of the issue as “jurisdictional,” and\nnoted the familiar proposition that jurisdictional chal­\nlenges may be raised at any stage of the proceedings. 432\nF. Supp. 2d 768, 777, and n. 7 (2006).\n  On appeal, the Seventh Circuit recognized that the\nUnion had presented its case “through both a statutory\nand constitutional framework.” 522 F. 3d 746, 750 (2008).\nThe court observed, however, that “the essence of the\nconflict boils down to a single question: is written docu­\nmentation of the conference in the on-property record a\nnecessary prerequisite to arbitration before the NRAB?”\n  10 UNION PACIFIC R. CO. v. LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS AND \n\n         TRAINMEN GEN. COMM. OF ADJUSTMENT \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nIbid. It then determined that there was no such prerequi­\nsite: “[N]o statute, regulation, or CBA,” the court con­\ncluded, “required the evidence [of conferencing] to be\npresented in the on-property record.” Id., at 757–758. But\ninstead of resting its decision on the Union’s primary,\nstatute-based argument—that the panel erred in ruling\nthat it lacked jurisdiction over the cases—the Court of\nAppeals reversed on the ground that the NRAB’s proceed­\nings were incompatible with due process. See id., at 750.\n                             II\n  We granted the Carrier’s petition for certiorari, 555\nU. S. ___ (2009), which asked us to determine whether a\nreviewing court may set aside NRAB orders for failure to\ncomply with due process notwithstanding the limited\ngrounds for review specified in §153 First (q).6 As earlier\nrecounted, Courts of Appeals have divided on this issue.\nSee supra, at 6, and n. 4. Appearing as respondent in this\nCourt, however, the Union urged affirmance of the Sev­\nenth Circuit’s judgment on an alternative ground. Reas­\nserting the lead argument it had advanced in its petition\nfor court review, see supra, at 9, the Union maintained\nthat the Board did not “conform, or confine itself, to mat­\nters within the scope of [its] jurisdiction,” §153 First (q).\nBrief for Respondent 52–53. In response, the Carrier\nstated that the Union’s alternative ground “presents a\npure question of law that th[e] Court can and should\nresolve without need for remand.” Reply Brief 24, n. 9.\nWe agree.\n  So long as a respondent does not “seek to modify the\njudgment below,” true here, “[i]t is well accepted” that the\n——————\n  6 Quoted supra, at 6, those grounds are “failure of the division to\n\ncomply with [RLA] requirements,” “failure of the order to conform, or\nconfine itself, to matters within the scope of the division’s jurisdiction,”\nand “fraud or corruption by a member of the division making the\norder.”\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrespondent may, “without filing a cross-appeal or cross­\npetition, . . . rely upon any matter appearing in the record\nin support of the judgment.” Blum v. Bacon, 457 U. S.\n132, 137, n. 5 (1982). The Seventh Circuit, as just ob­\nserved, see supra, at 9–10, understood that the Union had\npressed “statutory and constitutional” arguments, but also\ncomprehended that both arguments homed in on “a single\nquestion: is written documentation of the conference in the\non-property record a necessary prerequisite to arbitration\nbefore the NRAB?” 522 F. 3d, at 750. Answering this\n“single question” in the negative, the Court of Appeals\neffectively resolved the Union’s core complaint. But, for\nreasons far from apparent, the court declared that “once\nwe answer the key question . . . , adjudication of the due\nprocess claim is unavoidable.” Ibid.\n   The Seventh Circuit, we agree, asked the right question,\nbut inappropriately placed its answer under a constitu­\ntional, rather than a statutory, headline. As the Court of\nAppeals determined, and as we discuss infra, at 12–17,\nnothing in the Act elevates to jurisdictional status the\nobligation to conference minor disputes or to prove confer­\nencing. That being so, the “unavoidable” conclusion,\nfollowing from the Seventh Circuit’s “answer [to] the key\nquestion,” 522 F. 3d, at 750, is that the panel, in §153\nFirst (q)’s words, failed “to conform, or confine itself, to\nmatters within the scope of [its] jurisdiction.” The Carrier,\nalthough it sought a different outcome, was quite right to\n“urg[e] [the Court of Appeals] to consider the statutory\nclaim before the constitutional one.” 522 F. 3d, at 750.\n   In short, a negative answer to the “single question”\nidentified by the Court of Appeals leaves no doubt about\nthe Union’s entitlement, in accord with §153 First (q), to\nvacation of the Board’s orders. Given this statutory\nground for relief, there is no due process issue alive in this\ncase, and no warrant to answer a question that may be\nconsequential in another case: Absent grounds specified in\n  12 UNION PACIFIC R. CO. v. LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS AND \n\n         TRAINMEN GEN. COMM. OF ADJUSTMENT \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\n§153 First (q) for vacating a Board order, may a reviewing\ncourt set aside an NRAB adjudication for incompatibility\nwith due process? An answer to that question must await\na case in which the issue is genuinely in controversy.7 In\nthis case, however, our grant of certiorari enables us to\naddress a matter of some importance: We can reduce\nconfusion, clouding court as well as Board decisions, over\nmatters properly typed “jurisdictional.”\n                              III \n\n                               A\n\n   Recognizing that the word “jurisdiction” has been used\nby courts, including this Court, to convey “many, too\nmany, meanings,” Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environ\nment, 523 U. S. 83, 90 (1998) (internal quotation marks\nomitted), we have cautioned, in recent decisions, against\nprofligate use of the term. Not all mandatory “prescrip­\ntions, however emphatic, are . . . properly typed jurisdic­\ntional,” we explained in Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S.\n500, 510 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Sub­\nject-matter jurisdiction properly comprehended, we em­\nphasized, refers to a tribunal’s “power to hear a case,” a\nmatter that “can never be forfeited or waived.” Id., at 514\n(quoting United States v. Cotton, 535 U. S. 625, 630\n(2002)). In contrast, a “claim-processing rule, . . . even if\nunalterable on a party’s application,” does not reduce the\nadjudicatory domain of a tribunal and is ordinarily “for­\nfeited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise\nthe point.” Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 456 (2004).\n\n——————\n  7 A case of that order would be uncommon. As the Carrier acknowl­\n\nedges, “many of the cases reviewing ostensibly extra-statutory due\nprocess objections could have been accommodated within the statutory\nframework.” Brief for Petitioner 36. See also id., at 37 (“The statutory\nreview provisions are plainly generous enough to permit litigants to\nraise all of the simple, common, easily adjudicated, and likely to be\nmeritorious claims that sail under the flag of due process of law . . . .”).\n                  Cite as: 558 U.

S. C. §2000e et seq., requiring complainants to\nfile a timely charge of discrimination with the Equal Em­\nployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) before pro­\nceeding to court. Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455\nU. S. 385, 393 (1982). We have also held nonjurisdictional\nand forfeitable the Title VII provision exempting employ­\ners who engage fewer than 15 employees. Arbaugh, 546\nU. S., at 503, 515–516. And we have determined that a\nChapter 7 trustee’s (or creditor’s) limited time to object to\nthe debtor’s discharge, see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4004, is\na claim-processing, not a jurisdictional, matter. Kontrick,\n540 U. S., at 446–447, 460. In contrast, relying on a long\nline of this Court’s decisions left undisturbed by Congress,\nwe have reaffirmed the jurisdictional character of the time\nlimitation for filing a notice of appeal stated in 28 U. S. C.\n§2107(a). Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, 209–211\n(2007). See also John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United\nStates, 552 U. S. 130, 132 (2008) (court must consider\nsua sponte timeliness of lawsuit filed against the United\nStates in the Court of Federal Claims).\n   With these decisions in mind, we turn back to the re­\nquirement that parties to minor disputes, as a last chance\nprearbitration, attempt settlement “in conference,” 45\nU. S. C. §152 Second, Sixth. See supra, at 4–5, and n. 3.\nThis obligation is imposed on carriers and grievants alike\nbut, we hold, its satisfaction does not condition the adjudi­\ncatory authority of the Board.\n   The Board’s jurisdiction extends to “all disputes between\ncarriers and their employees ‘growing out of grievances or\nout of the interpretation or application of agreements\nconcerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions . . . .’ ”\nSlocum v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., 339 U. S. 239, 240\n(1950) (quoting §153 First (i)). True, the RLA instructs\nthat, before any reference to arbitration, the dispute “shall\n  14 UNION PACIFIC R. CO. v. LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS AND \n\n         TRAINMEN GEN. COMM. OF ADJUSTMENT \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nbe handled in the usual manner up to and including the\n[designated] chief operating officer.” §153 First (i). And\nwhen the CBA’s grievance procedure has not been fol­\nlowed, resort to the Board would ordinarily be objection­\nable as premature.\n   The additional requirement of a conference, we note, is\nindependent of the CBA process. Rather, the conference\nrequirement is stated in the “[g]eneral duties” section of\nthe RLA, §152, a section that is not moored to the\n“[e]stablishment[,] . . . powers[,] and duties” of the NRAB\nset out next in §153 First. Rooted in §152 and often in­\nformal in practice, see supra, at 4–5, conferencing is surely\nno more “jurisdictional” than is the presuit resort to the\nEEOC held forfeitable in Zipes, 455 U. S., at 393.8 And if\nthe requirement to conference is not “jurisdictional,” then\nfailure initially to submit proof of conferencing cannot be\nof that genre. See Part III–B, infra.\n   In defense of the Board’s characterization of conferenc­\ning and proof thereof as jurisdictional, the Carrier points\nto the NRAB’s Circular One procedural regulations, see\nsupra, at 3–4, which provide: “No petition shall be consid­\nered by any division of the Board unless the subject mat­\nter has been handled in accordance with the provisions of\nthe [RLA].” 29 CFR §301.2(b). But that provision, as\nother prescriptions in Circular One, is a claims-processing\nrule. Congress gave the Board no authority to adopt rules\nof jurisdictional dimension. See 45 U. S. C. §153 First (v)\n(authorizing the NRAB to “adopt such rules as it deems\nnecessary to control proceedings before the respective\n——————\n  8 The RLA states, in §152 First, a general duty “to settle all disputes,”\n\nand, in §152 Second, a more specific duty to “conference.” These provi­\nsions apply to all disputes in the railroad industry, major as well as\nminor. They also apply to disputes in the airline industry, over which\nthe NRAB has no jurisdiction. §181. Neither provision “speak[s] in\njurisdictional terms or refer[s] in any way to the jurisdiction of the”\nNRAB. Zipes, 455 U. S., at 394.\n                  Cite as: 558 U.

And when the fact of conferencing is genuinely\ncontested, we see no reason why the panel could not ad­\njourn the proceeding pending cure of any lapse. Circular\nOne does not exclude such a sensible solution.\n   The Carrier cites NRAB decisions that allegedly support\ncharacterization of conferencing as jurisdictional. If the\nNRAB lacks authority to define the jurisdiction of its\npanels, however, surely the panels themselves lack that\nauthority. Furthermore, NRAB panels have variously\naddressed the matter. For example, in NRAB Third Div.\nAward No. 15880 (Oct. 26, 1967), the panel, although\ncharacterizing the conferencing requirement as “jurisdic­\ntional,” said that “[i]f one of the parties refuses or fails to\navail itself of a conference where there is an opportunity to\ndo so, it cannot then assert the defense of a lack of juris­\ndiction.” Id., at 2. See also NRAB Fourth Div. Award No.\n5074 (June 21, 2001) (same); NRAB Third Div. Award No.\n28147 (Oct. 16, 1989) (same). Cf. Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at\n511 (“unrefined” uses of the word “jurisdiction” are enti­\ntled to “no precedential effect” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). And in NRAB First Div. Award No. 23867, p. 5\n(Apr. 7, 1988), the panel observed that the ordinary rem­\nedy for lack of conferencing is to “dismiss th[e] claim with­\nout prejudice to allow Claimant to cure the jurisdictional\ndefect.” That panel reached the merits nevertheless. Ibid.\nCf. Steel Co., 523 U. S., at 94 (“Jurisdiction is power to\ndeclare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only\nfunction remaining to the [tribunal] is that of announcing\nthe fact and dismissing the cause” (quoting Ex parte\nMcCardle, 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869)).). We note, in addition,\nthe acknowledgment of the Carrier’s counsel that, if con­\nferencing has not occurred, NRAB panels have stayed\narbitration to allow the parties to confer.

Circular One correspondingly instructs\nemployees seeking Board adjudication “[to] set forth all\nrelevant, argumentative facts” and “affirmatively show the\nsame to have been presented to the carrier and made a\npart of the particular question in dispute.” 29 CFR\n§301.5(d); see §301.5(e) (similar instruction addressed to\ncarriers). Conferencing, the Carrier urged, is a “relevant,\nargumentative fac[t],” so proof thereof must accompany\nparty submissions.\n   As earlier explained, see supra, at 14, instructions on\nparty submissions—essentially pleading instructions—are\nclaim-processing, not jurisdictional, rules. Moreover, the\nBoard itself has recognized that conferencing may not be a\n“question in dispute.” It has counseled parties submitting\njoint exhibits “to omit documents that are unimportant\nand/or irrelevant to the disposition of the [case]; for exam­\nple . . . letters requesting a conference (assuming that is\nnot an issue in the dispute).” NRAB Instructions Sheet,\nJoint Exh.

It bears repetition here that neither the Union nor\nthe Carrier, in its submissions to the Board, identified\nconferencing as a “question in dispute.” See supra, at 7.\n   It makes sense to exclude at the arbitration stage newly\npresented “data . . . in support of [the] employee[’s] [griev­\nance],” 29 CFR §301.5(d)—evidence the carrier had no\nopportunity to consider prearbitration. A contrary rule\nwould sandbag the carrier. But conferencing is not a fact\nbearing on the merits of a grievance. Indeed, there may be\nno disagreement at all about the occurrence of conferenc­\ning, as the Union believed to be the case here. Moreover,\nthe RLA respects the right of the parties to order for\nthemselves the conference procedures they will follow.\nSee 45 U. S. C. §152 Sixth (“[N]othing in this chapter shall\nbe construed to supersede the provisions of any agreement\n(as to conferences) . . . in effect between the parties.”). In\nsum, neither the RLA nor Circular One could plausibly be\nread to require, as a prerequisite to the NRAB’s exercise of\njurisdiction, submission of proof of conferencing.\n                        *     *    *\n   By refusing to adjudicate cases on the false premise that\nit lacked power to hear them, the NRAB panel failed “to\nconform, or confine itself,” to the jurisdiction Congress\ngave it.
