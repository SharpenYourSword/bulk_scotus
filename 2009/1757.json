After the murder, Belmontes and his\naccomplices stole McConnell’s stereo, sold it for $100, and\nused the money to buy beer and drugs for the night. Id.,\nat 764–765, 755 P. 2d, at 318–319.\n   Belmontes was convicted of murder and sentenced to\ndeath in state court. Unsuccessful on direct appeal and\nstate collateral review, Belmontes sought federal habeas\nrelief, which the District Court denied. The Court of Ap\npeals reversed, finding instructional error, but we over\nturned that decision. Ayers v. Belmontes, 549 U. S. 7\n(2006); see also Brown v. Belmontes, 544 U. S. 945 (2005).\n   On remand, the Court of Appeals again ruled for Bel\nmontes, this time finding that Belmontes suffered ineffec\ntive assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of\nhis trial. The District Court had previously denied relief\non that ground, finding that counsel for Belmontes had\nperformed deficiently under Ninth Circuit precedent, but\nthat Belmontes could not establish prejudice under Strick\nland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Belmontes v.\nCalderon, Civ. S–89–0736 DFL JFM (ED Cal., Aug. 15,\n2000), App. to Pet. for Cert. 140a, 179a, 183a. The Court\nof Appeals agreed that counsel’s performance was defi\ncient, but disagreed with the District Court with respect to\n2                   WONG v. BELMONTES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nprejudice, determining that counsel’s errors undermined\nconfidence in the penalty phase verdict. Belmontes v.\nAyers, 529 F. 3d 834, 859–863, 874 (CA9 2008). We dis\nagree with the Court of Appeals as to prejudice, grant the\nState’s petition for certiorari, and reverse.\n                               I\n   Belmontes argues that his counsel was constitutionally\nineffective for failing to investigate and present sufficient\nmitigating evidence during the penalty phase of his trial.\nTo prevail on this claim, Belmontes must meet both the\ndeficient performance and prejudice prongs of Strickland,\n466 U. S., at 687. To show deficient performance, Belmon\ntes must establish that “counsel’s representation fell below\nan objective standard of reasonableness.” Id., at 688. In\nlight of “the variety of circumstances faced by defense\ncounsel [and] the range of legitimate decisions regarding\nhow best to represent a criminal defendant,” the perform\nance inquiry necessarily turns on “whether counsel’s\nassistance was reasonable considering all the circum\nstances.” Id., at 688–689. At all points, “[j]udicial scru\ntiny of counsel’s performance must be highly deferential.”\nId., at 689.\n   The challenge confronting Belmontes’ lawyer, John\nSchick, was very specific. Substantial evidence indicated\nthat Belmontes had committed a prior murder, and the\nprosecution was eager to introduce that evidence during\nthe penalty phase of the McConnell trial. The evidence of\nthe prior murder was extensive, including eyewitness\ntestimony, Belmontes’ own admissions, and Belmontes’\npossession of the murder weapon and the same type of\nammunition used to kill the victim. Record 2239–2250,\n2261; Deposition of John Schick, Exhs. 62, 63, 64 (Sept.\n26, 1995).\n   The evidence, furthermore, was potentially devastating.\nIt would have shown that two years before Steacy McCon\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nnell’s death, police found Jerry Howard’s body in a se\ncluded area. Howard had been killed execution style, with\na bullet to the back of the head. The authorities suspected\nBelmontes, but on the eve of trial the State’s witnesses\nrefused to cooperate (Belmontes’ mother had begged one\nnot to testify). The prosecution therefore believed it could\nnot prove Belmontes guilty of murder beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. What the prosecution could prove, even without\nthe recalcitrant witnesses, was that Belmontes possessed\nthe gun used to murder Howard. So the State offered, and\nBelmontes accepted, a no-contest plea to accessory after\nthe fact to voluntary manslaughter. Record 2239–2243;\nDeposition of John Schick, Exhs. 62, 63, 64.\n  But Belmontes had not been shy about discussing the\nmurder, boasting to several people that he had killed\nHoward. Steven Cartwright informed the district attorney\nthat Belmontes had confessed to the murder. A police\ninformant told detectives that Belmontes “bragged” about\nthe murder, stating that he was “mad” at Howard because\n“the night before, he had quite a [lot] of dope and wouldn’t\nshare it with him.” After double jeopardy protection set in\nand he had been released on parole, Belmontes admitted\nhis responsibility for the murder to his counselor at the\nCalifornia Youth Authority, Charles Sapien. During his\ntime in confinement, Belmontes had “always denied that\nhe was the [one] who shot Jerry Howard.” But because\nSapien “had been square with [Belmontes],” Belmontes\ndecided to level with Sapien upon his release, telling\nSapien that he had “ ‘wasted’ that guy.” Record 2240;\nDeposition of John Schick, Exhs. 62, 63, 64.\n  Schick understood the gravity of this aggravating evi\ndence, and he built his mitigation strategy around the\noverriding need to exclude it. California evidentiary rules,\nSchick knew, offered him an argument to exclude the\nevidence, but those same rules made clear that the evi\ndence would come in for rebuttal if Schick opened the door.\n4                   WONG v. BELMONTES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nRecord 2256; see also People v. Rodriguez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1374541\"><a href=\"/opinion/1374541/people-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n791–792, 726 P. 2d 113, 153 (1986); People v.

Schick\nthus had “grave concerns” that, even if he succeeded ini\ntially in excluding the prior murder evidence, it would still\nbe admitted if his mitigation case swept too broadly.\nAccordingly, Schick decided to proceed cautiously, struc\nturing his mitigation arguments and witnesses to limit\nthat possibility. Deposition of John Schick 301, 309–310;\nsee Strickland, supra, at 699 (“Restricting testimony on\nrespondent’s character to what had come in at the plea\ncolloquy ensured that contrary character and psychologi\ncal evidence and respondent’s criminal history, which\ncounsel had successfully moved to exclude, would not come\nin”).\n   As Schick expected, the prosecution was ready to admit\nthis evidence during the sentencing phase. Schick moved\nto exclude the evidence, arguing that the State should be\nallowed to tell the jury only that Belmontes had been\nconvicted of being an accessory after the fact to voluntary\nmanslaughter—nothing more. Record 2240–2254. Schick\nsucceeded in keeping the prosecution from presenting the\ndamaging evidence in its sentencing case in chief, but his\nclient remained at risk: The trial court indicated the evi\ndence would come in for rebuttal or impeachment if Schick\nopened the door. Id., at 2256.\n   This was not an empty threat. In one instance, Schick\nelicited testimony that Belmontes was not a violent per\nson. The State objected and, out of earshot of the jury,\nargued that it should be able to rebut the testimony with\nthe Howard murder evidence. Id., at 2332–2334. The\nCourt warned Schick that it was “going to have to allow\n[the prosecution] to go into the whole background” if\nSchick continued his line of questioning. Id., at 2334.\nSchick acquiesced, and the court struck the testimony.\nIbid.\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)           5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n  The Court’s warning reinforced Schick’s understanding\nthat he would have to tailor his mitigation case carefully\nto preserve his success in excluding the Howard murder\nevidence. With that cautionary note in mind, Schick put\non nine witnesses he thought could advance a case for\nmitigation, without opening the door to the prior murder\nevidence. See id., at 2312–2417.\n  The Court of Appeals determined that in spite of these\nefforts, Schick’s performance was constitutionally deficient\nunder Circuit precedent. Belmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 862–\n863. The State challenges that conclusion, but we need\nnot resolve the point, because we agree with the District\nCourt that Belmontes cannot establish prejudice.\n                             II\n   To establish prejudice, Belmontes must show “a reason\nable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been dif\nferent.” Strickland, 466 U. S., at 694. That showing\nrequires Belmontes to establish “a reasonable probability\nthat a competent attorney, aware of [the available mitigat\ning evidence], would have introduced it at sentencing,”\nand “that had the jury been confronted with this . . . miti\ngating evidence, there is a reasonable probability that it\nwould have returned with a different sentence.” Wiggins\nv. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 535, 536 (2003).\n   The Ninth Circuit determined that a reasonably compe\ntent lawyer would have introduced more mitigation evi\ndence, on top of what Schick had already presented. For\npurposes of our prejudice analysis, we accept that conclu\nsion and proceed to consider whether there is a reasonable\nprobability that a jury presented with this additional miti\ngation evidence would have returned a different verdict.\n   In evaluating that question, it is necessary to consider\nall the relevant evidence that the jury would have had\nbefore it if Schick had pursued the different path—not just\n6                  WONG v. BELMONTES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nthe mitigation evidence Schick could have presented, but\nalso the Howard murder evidence that almost certainly\nwould have come in with it. See Strickland, supra, at\n695–696, 700. Thus, to establish prejudice, Belmontes\nmust show a reasonable probability that the jury would\nhave rejected a capital sentence after it weighed the entire\nbody of mitigating evidence (including the additional\ntestimony Schick could have presented) against the entire\nbody of aggravating evidence (including the Howard mur\nder evidence). Belmontes cannot meet this burden.\n   We begin with the mitigating evidence Schick did pre\nsent during the sentencing phase. That evidence was\nsubstantial. The same Ninth Circuit panel addressing the\nsame record in Belmontes’ first habeas appeal agreed,\nrecognizing “the substantial nature of the mitigating\nevidence” Schick presented. Belmontes v. Woodford, 350\nF. 3d 861, 907 (2003). It reiterated the point several\ntimes. See id., at 874, 901, 908.\n   All told, Schick put nine witnesses on the stand over a\nspan of two days, and elicited a range of testimony on\nBelmontes’ behalf. A number of those witnesses high\nlighted Belmontes’ “terrible” childhood. They testified\nthat his father was an alcoholic and extremely abusive.\nBelmontes’ grandfather described the one-bedroom house\nwhere Belmontes spent much of his childhood as a\n“chicken coop.” Belmontes did not do well in school; he\ndropped out in the ninth grade. His younger sister died\nwhen she was only 10 months old. And his grandmother\ndied tragically when she drowned in her swimming pool.\nSee Record 2314–2319, 2324–2325, 2344.\n   Family members also testified that, despite these diffi\nculties, Belmontes maintained strong relationships with\nhis grandfather, grandmother, mother, and sister. Id., at\n2317–2318, 2325–2326. And Belmontes’ best friend of\nfered the insights of a close friend and confidant. Id., at\n2329–2332.\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n    Schick also called witnesses who detailed Belmontes’\nreligious conversion while in state custody on the acces\nsory charge. These witnesses told stories about Belmon\ntes’ efforts advising other inmates in his detention center’s\nreligious program, to illustrate that he could live a produc\ntive and meaningful life in prison. They described his\nsuccess working as part of a firefighting crew, detailing his\nrise from lowest man on the team to second in command.\nBelmontes’ assistant chaplain even said that he would use\nBelmontes as a regular part of his prison counseling pro\ngram if the jury handed down a life sentence. Id., at\n2379–2384, 2396–2398, 2400–2407.\n    Belmontes himself bolstered these accounts by testifying\nabout his childhood and religious conversion, both at\nsentencing and during allocution. Belmontes described\nhis childhood as “pretty hard,” but took responsibility for\nhis actions, telling the jury that he did not want to use his\nbackground “as a crutch[,] to say I am in a situation now\n. . . because of that.” Id., at 2343.\n    On remand from this Court, the Court of Appeals—\naddressing Belmontes’ ineffective assistance claim for the\nfirst time—changed its view of this evidence. Instead of\nfinding Schick’s mitigation case “substantial,” as it previ\nously had, Belmontes, 350 F. 3d, at 907, the Ninth Circuit\nthis time around labeled it “cursory,” Belmontes, 529 F. 3d,\nat 841, 861, n. 14, 866. Compare also Belmontes, 350\nF. 3d, at 874, 901, 907 (labeling the mitigation evidence\nSchick presented “substantial”), with Belmontes, 529\nF. 3d, at 847, n. 3, 874 (labeling the same evidence “insub\nstantial”). More evidence, the Court of Appeals now con\ncluded, would have made a difference; in particular, more\nevidence to “humanize” Belmontes, as that court put it no\nfewer than 11 times in its opinion. Belmontes, 529 F. 3d,\nat 850, 859, 860, 862, 863, 864, 865, and n. 18, 869, 872,\n874. The Court determined that the failure to put on this\nevidence prejudiced Belmontes.\n8                   WONG v. BELMONTES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n   There are two problems with this conclusion: Some of\nthe evidence was merely cumulative of the humanizing\nevidence Schick actually presented; adding it to what was\nalready there would have made little difference. Other\nevidence proposed by the Ninth Circuit would have put\ninto play aspects of Belmontes’ character that would have\ntriggered admission of the powerful Howard evidence in\nrebuttal. This evidence would have made a difference, but\nin the wrong direction for Belmontes. In either event,\nBelmontes cannot establish Strickland prejudice.\n   First, the cumulative evidence. In the Court of Appeals’\nview, Belmontes should have presented more humanizing\nevidence about Belmontes’ “difficult childhood” and high\nlighted his “positive attributes.” 529 F. 3d, at 864. As for\nhis difficult childhood, Schick should have called witnesses\nto testify that “when Belmontes was five years old, his 10\nmonth-old sister died of a brain tumor,” that he “exhibited\nsymptoms of depression” after her death, that his grand\nmother suffered from “alcoholism and prescription drug\naddiction,” and that both his immediate and extended\nfamily lived in a state of “constant strife.” Ibid. As for his\npositive attributes, Schick should have produced testi\nmony about Belmontes’ “strong character as a child in the\nface of adversity.” Ibid. Schick should have illustrated\nthat Belmontes was “kind, responsible, and likeable”; that\nhe “got along well with his siblings” and was “respectful\ntowards his grandparents despite their disapproval of his\nmixed racial background”; and that he “participated in\ncommunity activities, kept up in school and got along with\nhis teachers before [an] illness, and made friends easily.”\nIbid.\n   But as recounted above and recognized by the state\ncourts and, originally, this very panel, Schick did put on\nsubstantial mitigation evidence, much of it targeting the\nsame “humanizing” theme the Ninth Circuit highlighted.\nCompare, e.g., ibid., with Record 2317 (death of 10-month\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nold sister); id., at 2319, 2325 (difficult childhood); id., at\n2314–2315 (family member’s addictions); id., at 2314–\n2315, 2324–2325 (family strife and abuse); id., at 2317,\n2319, 2347–2348, 2397 (strong character as a child); id., at\n2326–2327 (close relationship with siblings); id., at 2317–\n2319 (close relationship with grandparents); id., at 2348–\n2351 (participation in community religious events); see\nalso, e.g., Belmontes’ Traverse to Respondent’s Return to\nPet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus in No. 5–89–0736–EJG–\nJFM (ED Cal.), p. 64 (“[C]ounsel’s presentation was ar\nguably adequate only with respect to [evidence] of ‘human\nizing’ petitioner”). The sentencing jury was thus “well\nacquainted” with Belmontes’ background and potential\nhumanizing features. Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465,\n481 (2007). Additional evidence on these points would\nhave offered an insignificant benefit, if any at all.\n   The Ninth Circuit also determined that both the evi\ndence Schick presented and the additional evidence it\nproposed would have carried greater weight if Schick had\nsubmitted expert testimony. Such testimony could “make\nconnections between the various themes in the mitigation\ncase and explain to the jury how they could have contrib\nuted to Belmontes’s involvement in criminal activity.”\nBelmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 853. See also ibid. (discussing\nexpert’s federal habeas testimony on importance of expert\ntestimony). But the body of mitigating evidence the Ninth\nCircuit would have required Schick to present was neither\ncomplex nor technical. It required only that the jury make\nlogical connections of the kind a layperson is well\nequipped to make. The jury simply did not need expert\ntestimony to understand the “humanizing” evidence; it\ncould use its common sense or own sense of mercy.\n   What is more, expert testimony discussing Belmontes’\nmental state, seeking to explain his behavior, or putting it\nin some favorable context would have exposed Belmontes\nto the Howard evidence. See Darden v. Wainwright, 477\n10                  WONG v. BELMONTES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nU. S. 168, 186 (1986) (“Any attempt to portray petitioner\nas a nonviolent man would have opened the door for the\nState to rebut with evidence of petitioner’s prior convic\ntions. . . . Similarly, if defense counsel had attempted to\nput on evidence that petitioner was a family man, they\nwould have been faced with his admission at trial that,\nalthough still married, he was spending the weekend\nfurlough with a girlfriend”).\n   If, for example, an expert had testified that Belmontes\nhad a “ ‘high likelihood of a . . . nonviolent adjustment to a\nprison setting,’ ” as Belmontes suggested an expert might,\nsee Brief for Appellant in No. 01–99018 (CA9), p. 34, the\nquestion would have immediately arisen: “What was his\npropensity toward violence to begin with? Does evidence\nof another murder alter your view?” Expert testimony\nexplaining why the jury should feel sympathy, as opposed\nsimply to facts that might elicit that response, would have\nled to a similar rejoinder: “Is such sympathy equally ap\npropriate for someone who committed a second murder?”\nAny of this testimony from an expert’s perspective would\nhave made the Howard evidence fair game.\n   Many of Belmontes’ other arguments fail for the same\nreason. He argues that the jury should have been told\nthat he suffered an “extended bout with rheumatic fever,”\nwhich led to “emotional instability, impulsivity, and im\npairment of the neurophysiological mechanisms for plan\nning and reasoning.” Amended Pet. for Writ of Habeas\nCorpus 120. But the cold, calculated nature of the Howard\nmurder and Belmontes’ subsequent bragging about it\nwould have served as a powerful counterpoint.\n   The type of “more-evidence-is-better” approach advo\ncated by Belmontes and the Court of Appeals might seem\nappealing—after all, what is there to lose? But here there\nwas a lot to lose. A heavyhanded case to portray Belmon\ntes in a positive light, with or without experts, would have\ninvited the strongest possible evidence in rebuttal—the\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)          11\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nevidence that Belmontes was responsible for not one but\ntwo murders.\n   Belmontes counters that some of the potential mitigat\ning evidence might not have opened the door to the prior\nmurder evidence. The Court of Appeals went so far as to\nstate, without citation, that “[t]here would be no basis for\nsuggesting that [expert testimony] would be any different\nif the expert were informed that Belmontes committed two\nmurders rather than one.” Belmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 869,\nn. 20. But it is surely pertinent in assessing expert testi\nmony “explain[ing] . . . involvement in criminal activity,”\nid., at 853, to know what criminal activity was at issue.\nAnd even if the number of murders were as irrelevant as\nthe Ninth Circuit asserted, the fact that these two murders\nwere so different in character made each of them highly\npertinent in evaluating expert testimony of the sort envi\nsioned by the Court of Appeals.\n   The Ninth Circuit noted that the trial court retained\ndiscretion to exclude the Howard evidence even if Schick\nopened the door. Id., at 869–870, n. 20. If Schick had\ndoubts, the Court of Appeals contended, he could have\nsecured an answer in advance through a motion in limine.\nIbid. The trial judge, however, left little doubt where he\nstood. While ruling that the prosecution could not present\nthe evidence in its case in chief, Record 2254, the judge\nmade clear that it would come in for certain rebuttal\npurposes, id., at 2256, 2332–2334. When Schick elicited\ntestimony that Belmontes was not violent, for example,\nthe judge ordered it stricken and warned Schick that he\nwould admit the Howard murder evidence—to let the\nprosecution “go into the whole background”—if Schick\npressed forward. Id., at 2334.\n   In balancing the mitigating factors against the aggrava\ntors, the Court of Appeals repeatedly referred to the ag\ngravating evidence the State presented as “scant.” Bel\nmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 870, 873, 874, 875, 878. That\n12                 WONG v. BELMONTES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ncharacterization misses Strickland’s point that the review\ning court must consider all the evidence—the good and the\nbad—when evaluating prejudice. See Strickland, 466\nU. S., at 695–696, 700. Here, the worst kind of bad evi\ndence would have come in with the good. The only reason\nit did not was because Schick was careful in his mitigation\ncase. The State’s aggravation evidence could only be\ncharacterized as “scant” if one ignores the “elephant in the\ncourtroom”—Belmontes’ role in the Howard murder—that\nwould have been presented had Schick submitted the\nadditional mitigation evidence. Belmontes v. Ayers, 551\nF. 3d 864, 867 (CA9 2008) (Callahan, J., dissenting from\ndenial of rehearing en banc).\n   Even on the record before it—which did not include the\nHoward murder—the state court determined that Belmon\ntes “was convicted on extremely strong evidence that he\ncommitted an intentional murder of extraordinary brutal\nity.” Belmontes, 45 Cal. 3d, at 819, 755 P. 2d, at 354.\nThat court also noted that “[t]he properly admitted aggra\nvating evidence in this case—in particular, the circum\nstances of the crime—was simply overwhelming.” Id., at\n809, 755 P. 2d, at 348 (citation omitted). The Ninth Cir\ncuit saw the murder differently. It viewed the circum\nstances of the crime as only “conceivably significant” as an\naggravating factor. Belmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 871. In\nparticular, the Court of Appeals concluded that “[t]he\ncrime here did not involve . . . needless suffering on the\npart of the victim.” Ibid.\n   We agree with the state court’s characterization of the\nmurder, and simply cannot comprehend the assertion by\nthe Court of Appeals that this case did not involve “need\nless suffering.” The jury saw autopsy photographs show\ning Steacy McConnell’s mangled head, her skull crushed\nby 15 to 20 blows from a steel dumbbell bar the jury found\nto have been wielded by Belmontes. McConnell’s corpse\nshowed numerous “defensive bruises and contusions on\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

Belmontes left\nMcConnell to die, but officers found her still fighting for\nher life before ultimately succumbing to the injuries\ncaused by the blows from Belmontes. Record 3. The jury\nalso heard that this savage murder was committed solely\nto prevent interference with a burglary that netted Bel\nmontes $100 he used to buy beer and drugs for the night.\nMcConnell suffered, and it was clearly needless.\n  Some of the error below may be traced to confusion\nabout the appropriate standard and burden of proof.\nWhile the Court of Appeals quoted the pertinent language\nfrom Strickland, that court elsewhere suggested it might\nhave applied something different. In explaining its preju\ndice determination, the Ninth Circuit concluded that “[t]he\naggravating evidence, even with the addition of evidence\nthat Belmontes murdered Howard, is not strong enough,\nin light of the mitigating evidence that could have been\nadduced, to rule out a sentence of life in prison.” Belmon\ntes, 529 F. 3d, at 875. But Strickland does not require the\nState to “rule out” a sentence of life in prison to prevail.\nRather, Strickland places the burden on the defendant,\nnot the State, to show a “reasonable probability” that the\nresult would have been different. 466 U. S., at 694. Un\nder a proper application of the Strickland standard, Bel\nmontes cannot carry this burden.\n  It is hard to imagine expert testimony and additional\nfacts about Belmontes’ difficult childhood outweighing the\nfacts of McConnell’s murder. It becomes even harder to\nenvision such a result when the evidence that Belmontes\nhad committed another murder—“the most powerful\nimaginable aggravating evidence,” as Judge Levi put it,\nBelmontes, S-89–0736, App. to Pet. for Cert. 183a—is\nadded to the mix. Schick’s mitigation strategy failed, but\nthe notion that the result could have been different if only\n14                  WONG v.

Decided November 16, 2009\n\n\n  JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring.\n  When Fernando Belmontes was sentenced to death in\n1982, California Penal Code §190.3(k)* conveyed the\nunmistakable message that juries could not give any\nmitigating weight to evidence that did not extenuate the\nseverity of the crime. See Ayers v. Belmontes, 549 U. S. 7,\n27 (2006) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). The trial judge who\npresided at Belmontes’ sentencing hearing so understood\nthe law, and his instructions to the jury reflected that\nunderstanding. See id., at 33–34. It was only later that\nboth the California Supreme Court and this Court\nsquarely held that a jury must be allowed to give weight to\nany aspect of a defendant’s character or history that may\nprovide a basis for a sentence other than death, even if\nsuch evidence does not “ ‘tend to reduce the defendant’s\nculpability for his crime.’ ” Id., at 28 (quoting Skipper v.\nSouth Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 11 (1986) (Powell, J., concur\nring in judgment)).\n  The testimony adduced at Belmontes’ sentencing hear\ning described his religious conversion and his positive\ncontributions to a youth rehabilitation program. Neither\nhis own testimony, nor that of the two ministers and the\nother witnesses who testified on his behalf, made any\nattempt to extenuate the severity of his crime. Their\ntestimony did, however, afford the jury a principled basis\nfor imposing a sentence other than death. See Ayers, 549\n——————\n * Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.3(k) (West 1988).\n2                  WONG v. BELMONTES\n\n                    STEVENS, J., concurring\n\nU. S., at 29–31 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). A review of the\nentire record, especially the colloquy between six jurors\nand the trial judge, makes it clear to me that “the jury\nbelieved that the law forbade it from giving that evidence\nany weight at all.” Id., at 36–39. I therefore remain con\nvinced that in its initial review of this case, the Court of\nAppeals correctly set aside Belmontes’ death sentence.\n   The narrow question that is now before us is whether\nthe additional mitigating evidence that trial counsel failed\nto uncover would have persuaded the jury to return a\ndifferent verdict. The evidence trial counsel might have\npresented hardly matters, however, because in my view\nthe conscientious jurors’ mistaken understanding of the\nlaw would have prevented them from giving that addi\ntional evidence “any weight at all,” id., at 39, let alone\ncontrolling weight. Despite my strong disagreement with\nthe Court’s decision to review this case once again, I nev\nertheless agree with the Court’s conclusion that trial\ncounsel’s failure to present additional mitigating evidence\nprobably did not affect the outcome of the trial.\n</pre>", "id": 1757, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2009/11/16/Wong_v._Belmontes.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                 Cite as: 558 U.

Decided November 16, 2009\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   In 1981, in the course of a burglary, Fernando Belmon\ntes bludgeoned Steacy McConnell to death, striking her in\nthe head 15 to 20 times with a steel dumbbell bar. See\nPeople v. Belmontes, 45 Cal. 3d 744, 759–761, 755 P. 2d\n310, 315–316 (1988). After the murder, Belmontes and his\naccomplices stole McConnell’s stereo, sold it for $100, and\nused the money to buy beer and drugs for the night. Id.,\nat 764–765, 755 P. 2d, at 318–319.\n   Belmontes was convicted of murder and sentenced to\ndeath in state court. Unsuccessful on direct appeal and\nstate collateral review, Belmontes sought federal habeas\nrelief, which the District Court denied. The Court of Ap\npeals reversed, finding instructional error, but we over\nturned that decision. Ayers v. Belmontes, 549 U. S. 7\n(2006); see also Brown v. Belmontes, 544 U. S. 945 (2005).\n   On remand, the Court of Appeals again ruled for Bel\nmontes, this time finding that Belmontes suffered ineffec\ntive assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of\nhis trial. The District Court had previously denied relief\non that ground, finding that counsel for Belmontes had\nperformed deficiently under Ninth Circuit precedent, but\nthat Belmontes could not establish prejudice under Strick\nland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Belmontes v.\nCalderon, Civ. S–89–0736 DFL JFM (ED Cal., Aug. 15,\n2000), App. to Pet. for Cert. 140a, 179a, 183a. The Court\nof Appeals agreed that counsel’s performance was defi\ncient, but disagreed with the District Court with respect to\n2                   WONG v. BELMONTES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nprejudice, determining that counsel’s errors undermined\nconfidence in the penalty phase verdict. Belmontes v.\nAyers, 529 F. 3d 834, 859–863, 874 (CA9 2008). We dis\nagree with the Court of Appeals as to prejudice, grant the\nState’s petition for certiorari, and reverse.\n                               I\n   Belmontes argues that his counsel was constitutionally\nineffective for failing to investigate and present sufficient\nmitigating evidence during the penalty phase of his trial.\nTo prevail on this claim, Belmontes must meet both the\ndeficient performance and prejudice prongs of Strickland,\n466 U. S., at 687. To show deficient performance, Belmon\ntes must establish that “counsel’s representation fell below\nan objective standard of reasonableness.” Id., at 688. In\nlight of “the variety of circumstances faced by defense\ncounsel [and] the range of legitimate decisions regarding\nhow best to represent a criminal defendant,” the perform\nance inquiry necessarily turns on “whether counsel’s\nassistance was reasonable considering all the circum\nstances.” Id., at 688–689. At all points, “[j]udicial scru\ntiny of counsel’s performance must be highly deferential.”\nId., at 689.\n   The challenge confronting Belmontes’ lawyer, John\nSchick, was very specific. Substantial evidence indicated\nthat Belmontes had committed a prior murder, and the\nprosecution was eager to introduce that evidence during\nthe penalty phase of the McConnell trial. The evidence of\nthe prior murder was extensive, including eyewitness\ntestimony, Belmontes’ own admissions, and Belmontes’\npossession of the murder weapon and the same type of\nammunition used to kill the victim. Record 2239–2250,\n2261; Deposition of John Schick, Exhs. 62, 63, 64 (Sept.\n26, 1995).\n   The evidence, furthermore, was potentially devastating.\nIt would have shown that two years before Steacy McCon\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nnell’s death, police found Jerry Howard’s body in a se\ncluded area. Howard had been killed execution style, with\na bullet to the back of the head. The authorities suspected\nBelmontes, but on the eve of trial the State’s witnesses\nrefused to cooperate (Belmontes’ mother had begged one\nnot to testify). The prosecution therefore believed it could\nnot prove Belmontes guilty of murder beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. What the prosecution could prove, even without\nthe recalcitrant witnesses, was that Belmontes possessed\nthe gun used to murder Howard. So the State offered, and\nBelmontes accepted, a no-contest plea to accessory after\nthe fact to voluntary manslaughter. Record 2239–2243;\nDeposition of John Schick, Exhs. 62, 63, 64.\n  But Belmontes had not been shy about discussing the\nmurder, boasting to several people that he had killed\nHoward. Steven Cartwright informed the district attorney\nthat Belmontes had confessed to the murder. A police\ninformant told detectives that Belmontes “bragged” about\nthe murder, stating that he was “mad” at Howard because\n“the night before, he had quite a [lot] of dope and wouldn’t\nshare it with him.” After double jeopardy protection set in\nand he had been released on parole, Belmontes admitted\nhis responsibility for the murder to his counselor at the\nCalifornia Youth Authority, Charles Sapien. During his\ntime in confinement, Belmontes had “always denied that\nhe was the [one] who shot Jerry Howard.” But because\nSapien “had been square with [Belmontes],” Belmontes\ndecided to level with Sapien upon his release, telling\nSapien that he had “ ‘wasted’ that guy.” Record 2240;\nDeposition of John Schick, Exhs. 62, 63, 64.\n  Schick understood the gravity of this aggravating evi\ndence, and he built his mitigation strategy around the\noverriding need to exclude it. California evidentiary rules,\nSchick knew, offered him an argument to exclude the\nevidence, but those same rules made clear that the evi\ndence would come in for rebuttal if Schick opened the door.\n4                   WONG v. BELMONTES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nRecord 2256; see also People v. Rodriguez, 42 Cal. 3d 730,\n791–792, 726 P. 2d 113, 153 (1986); People v. Harris, 28\nCal. 3d 935, 960–962, 623 P. 2d 240, 254 (1981). Schick\nthus had “grave concerns” that, even if he succeeded ini\ntially in excluding the prior murder evidence, it would still\nbe admitted if his mitigation case swept too broadly.\nAccordingly, Schick decided to proceed cautiously, struc\nturing his mitigation arguments and witnesses to limit\nthat possibility. Deposition of John Schick 301, 309–310;\nsee Strickland, supra, at 699 (“Restricting testimony on\nrespondent’s character to what had come in at the plea\ncolloquy ensured that contrary character and psychologi\ncal evidence and respondent’s criminal history, which\ncounsel had successfully moved to exclude, would not come\nin”).\n   As Schick expected, the prosecution was ready to admit\nthis evidence during the sentencing phase. Schick moved\nto exclude the evidence, arguing that the State should be\nallowed to tell the jury only that Belmontes had been\nconvicted of being an accessory after the fact to voluntary\nmanslaughter—nothing more. Record 2240–2254. Schick\nsucceeded in keeping the prosecution from presenting the\ndamaging evidence in its sentencing case in chief, but his\nclient remained at risk: The trial court indicated the evi\ndence would come in for rebuttal or impeachment if Schick\nopened the door. Id., at 2256.\n   This was not an empty threat. In one instance, Schick\nelicited testimony that Belmontes was not a violent per\nson. The State objected and, out of earshot of the jury,\nargued that it should be able to rebut the testimony with\nthe Howard murder evidence. Id., at 2332–2334. The\nCourt warned Schick that it was “going to have to allow\n[the prosecution] to go into the whole background” if\nSchick continued his line of questioning. Id., at 2334.\nSchick acquiesced, and the court struck the testimony.\nIbid.\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)           5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n  The Court’s warning reinforced Schick’s understanding\nthat he would have to tailor his mitigation case carefully\nto preserve his success in excluding the Howard murder\nevidence. With that cautionary note in mind, Schick put\non nine witnesses he thought could advance a case for\nmitigation, without opening the door to the prior murder\nevidence. See id., at 2312–2417.\n  The Court of Appeals determined that in spite of these\nefforts, Schick’s performance was constitutionally deficient\nunder Circuit precedent. Belmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 862–\n863. The State challenges that conclusion, but we need\nnot resolve the point, because we agree with the District\nCourt that Belmontes cannot establish prejudice.\n                             II\n   To establish prejudice, Belmontes must show “a reason\nable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been dif\nferent.” Strickland, 466 U. S., at 694. That showing\nrequires Belmontes to establish “a reasonable probability\nthat a competent attorney, aware of [the available mitigat\ning evidence], would have introduced it at sentencing,”\nand “that had the jury been confronted with this . . . miti\ngating evidence, there is a reasonable probability that it\nwould have returned with a different sentence.” Wiggins\nv. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 535, 536 (2003).\n   The Ninth Circuit determined that a reasonably compe\ntent lawyer would have introduced more mitigation evi\ndence, on top of what Schick had already presented. For\npurposes of our prejudice analysis, we accept that conclu\nsion and proceed to consider whether there is a reasonable\nprobability that a jury presented with this additional miti\ngation evidence would have returned a different verdict.\n   In evaluating that question, it is necessary to consider\nall the relevant evidence that the jury would have had\nbefore it if Schick had pursued the different path—not just\n6                  WONG v. BELMONTES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nthe mitigation evidence Schick could have presented, but\nalso the Howard murder evidence that almost certainly\nwould have come in with it. See Strickland, supra, at\n695–696, 700. Thus, to establish prejudice, Belmontes\nmust show a reasonable probability that the jury would\nhave rejected a capital sentence after it weighed the entire\nbody of mitigating evidence (including the additional\ntestimony Schick could have presented) against the entire\nbody of aggravating evidence (including the Howard mur\nder evidence). Belmontes cannot meet this burden.\n   We begin with the mitigating evidence Schick did pre\nsent during the sentencing phase. That evidence was\nsubstantial. The same Ninth Circuit panel addressing the\nsame record in Belmontes’ first habeas appeal agreed,\nrecognizing “the substantial nature of the mitigating\nevidence” Schick presented. Belmontes v. Woodford, 350\nF. 3d 861, 907 (2003). It reiterated the point several\ntimes. See id., at 874, 901, 908.\n   All told, Schick put nine witnesses on the stand over a\nspan of two days, and elicited a range of testimony on\nBelmontes’ behalf. A number of those witnesses high\nlighted Belmontes’ “terrible” childhood. They testified\nthat his father was an alcoholic and extremely abusive.\nBelmontes’ grandfather described the one-bedroom house\nwhere Belmontes spent much of his childhood as a\n“chicken coop.” Belmontes did not do well in school; he\ndropped out in the ninth grade. His younger sister died\nwhen she was only 10 months old. And his grandmother\ndied tragically when she drowned in her swimming pool.\nSee Record 2314–2319, 2324–2325, 2344.\n   Family members also testified that, despite these diffi\nculties, Belmontes maintained strong relationships with\nhis grandfather, grandmother, mother, and sister. Id., at\n2317–2318, 2325–2326. And Belmontes’ best friend of\nfered the insights of a close friend and confidant. Id., at\n2329–2332.\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n    Schick also called witnesses who detailed Belmontes’\nreligious conversion while in state custody on the acces\nsory charge. These witnesses told stories about Belmon\ntes’ efforts advising other inmates in his detention center’s\nreligious program, to illustrate that he could live a produc\ntive and meaningful life in prison. They described his\nsuccess working as part of a firefighting crew, detailing his\nrise from lowest man on the team to second in command.\nBelmontes’ assistant chaplain even said that he would use\nBelmontes as a regular part of his prison counseling pro\ngram if the jury handed down a life sentence. Id., at\n2379–2384, 2396–2398, 2400–2407.\n    Belmontes himself bolstered these accounts by testifying\nabout his childhood and religious conversion, both at\nsentencing and during allocution. Belmontes described\nhis childhood as “pretty hard,” but took responsibility for\nhis actions, telling the jury that he did not want to use his\nbackground “as a crutch[,] to say I am in a situation now\n. . . because of that.” Id., at 2343.\n    On remand from this Court, the Court of Appeals—\naddressing Belmontes’ ineffective assistance claim for the\nfirst time—changed its view of this evidence. Instead of\nfinding Schick’s mitigation case “substantial,” as it previ\nously had, Belmontes, 350 F. 3d, at 907, the Ninth Circuit\nthis time around labeled it “cursory,” Belmontes, 529 F. 3d,\nat 841, 861, n. 14, 866. Compare also Belmontes, 350\nF. 3d, at 874, 901, 907 (labeling the mitigation evidence\nSchick presented “substantial”), with Belmontes, 529\nF. 3d, at 847, n. 3, 874 (labeling the same evidence “insub\nstantial”). More evidence, the Court of Appeals now con\ncluded, would have made a difference; in particular, more\nevidence to “humanize” Belmontes, as that court put it no\nfewer than 11 times in its opinion. Belmontes, 529 F. 3d,\nat 850, 859, 860, 862, 863, 864, 865, and n. 18, 869, 872,\n874. The Court determined that the failure to put on this\nevidence prejudiced Belmontes.\n8                   WONG v. BELMONTES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n   There are two problems with this conclusion: Some of\nthe evidence was merely cumulative of the humanizing\nevidence Schick actually presented; adding it to what was\nalready there would have made little difference. Other\nevidence proposed by the Ninth Circuit would have put\ninto play aspects of Belmontes’ character that would have\ntriggered admission of the powerful Howard evidence in\nrebuttal. This evidence would have made a difference, but\nin the wrong direction for Belmontes. In either event,\nBelmontes cannot establish Strickland prejudice.\n   First, the cumulative evidence. In the Court of Appeals’\nview, Belmontes should have presented more humanizing\nevidence about Belmontes’ “difficult childhood” and high\nlighted his “positive attributes.” 529 F. 3d, at 864. As for\nhis difficult childhood, Schick should have called witnesses\nto testify that “when Belmontes was five years old, his 10\nmonth-old sister died of a brain tumor,” that he “exhibited\nsymptoms of depression” after her death, that his grand\nmother suffered from “alcoholism and prescription drug\naddiction,” and that both his immediate and extended\nfamily lived in a state of “constant strife.” Ibid. As for his\npositive attributes, Schick should have produced testi\nmony about Belmontes’ “strong character as a child in the\nface of adversity.” Ibid. Schick should have illustrated\nthat Belmontes was “kind, responsible, and likeable”; that\nhe “got along well with his siblings” and was “respectful\ntowards his grandparents despite their disapproval of his\nmixed racial background”; and that he “participated in\ncommunity activities, kept up in school and got along with\nhis teachers before [an] illness, and made friends easily.”\nIbid.\n   But as recounted above and recognized by the state\ncourts and, originally, this very panel, Schick did put on\nsubstantial mitigation evidence, much of it targeting the\nsame “humanizing” theme the Ninth Circuit highlighted.\nCompare, e.g., ibid., with Record 2317 (death of 10-month\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nold sister); id., at 2319, 2325 (difficult childhood); id., at\n2314–2315 (family member’s addictions); id., at 2314–\n2315, 2324–2325 (family strife and abuse); id., at 2317,\n2319, 2347–2348, 2397 (strong character as a child); id., at\n2326–2327 (close relationship with siblings); id., at 2317–\n2319 (close relationship with grandparents); id., at 2348–\n2351 (participation in community religious events); see\nalso, e.g., Belmontes’ Traverse to Respondent’s Return to\nPet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus in No. 5–89–0736–EJG–\nJFM (ED Cal.), p. 64 (“[C]ounsel’s presentation was ar\nguably adequate only with respect to [evidence] of ‘human\nizing’ petitioner”). The sentencing jury was thus “well\nacquainted” with Belmontes’ background and potential\nhumanizing features. Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465,\n481 (2007). Additional evidence on these points would\nhave offered an insignificant benefit, if any at all.\n   The Ninth Circuit also determined that both the evi\ndence Schick presented and the additional evidence it\nproposed would have carried greater weight if Schick had\nsubmitted expert testimony. Such testimony could “make\nconnections between the various themes in the mitigation\ncase and explain to the jury how they could have contrib\nuted to Belmontes’s involvement in criminal activity.”\nBelmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 853. See also ibid. (discussing\nexpert’s federal habeas testimony on importance of expert\ntestimony). But the body of mitigating evidence the Ninth\nCircuit would have required Schick to present was neither\ncomplex nor technical. It required only that the jury make\nlogical connections of the kind a layperson is well\nequipped to make. The jury simply did not need expert\ntestimony to understand the “humanizing” evidence; it\ncould use its common sense or own sense of mercy.\n   What is more, expert testimony discussing Belmontes’\nmental state, seeking to explain his behavior, or putting it\nin some favorable context would have exposed Belmontes\nto the Howard evidence. See Darden v. Wainwright, 477\n10                  WONG v. BELMONTES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nU. S. 168, 186 (1986) (“Any attempt to portray petitioner\nas a nonviolent man would have opened the door for the\nState to rebut with evidence of petitioner’s prior convic\ntions. . . . Similarly, if defense counsel had attempted to\nput on evidence that petitioner was a family man, they\nwould have been faced with his admission at trial that,\nalthough still married, he was spending the weekend\nfurlough with a girlfriend”).\n   If, for example, an expert had testified that Belmontes\nhad a “ ‘high likelihood of a . . . nonviolent adjustment to a\nprison setting,’ ” as Belmontes suggested an expert might,\nsee Brief for Appellant in No. 01–99018 (CA9), p. 34, the\nquestion would have immediately arisen: “What was his\npropensity toward violence to begin with? Does evidence\nof another murder alter your view?” Expert testimony\nexplaining why the jury should feel sympathy, as opposed\nsimply to facts that might elicit that response, would have\nled to a similar rejoinder: “Is such sympathy equally ap\npropriate for someone who committed a second murder?”\nAny of this testimony from an expert’s perspective would\nhave made the Howard evidence fair game.\n   Many of Belmontes’ other arguments fail for the same\nreason. He argues that the jury should have been told\nthat he suffered an “extended bout with rheumatic fever,”\nwhich led to “emotional instability, impulsivity, and im\npairment of the neurophysiological mechanisms for plan\nning and reasoning.” Amended Pet. for Writ of Habeas\nCorpus 120. But the cold, calculated nature of the Howard\nmurder and Belmontes’ subsequent bragging about it\nwould have served as a powerful counterpoint.\n   The type of “more-evidence-is-better” approach advo\ncated by Belmontes and the Court of Appeals might seem\nappealing—after all, what is there to lose? But here there\nwas a lot to lose. A heavyhanded case to portray Belmon\ntes in a positive light, with or without experts, would have\ninvited the strongest possible evidence in rebuttal—the\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)          11\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nevidence that Belmontes was responsible for not one but\ntwo murders.\n   Belmontes counters that some of the potential mitigat\ning evidence might not have opened the door to the prior\nmurder evidence. The Court of Appeals went so far as to\nstate, without citation, that “[t]here would be no basis for\nsuggesting that [expert testimony] would be any different\nif the expert were informed that Belmontes committed two\nmurders rather than one.” Belmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 869,\nn. 20. But it is surely pertinent in assessing expert testi\nmony “explain[ing] . . . involvement in criminal activity,”\nid., at 853, to know what criminal activity was at issue.\nAnd even if the number of murders were as irrelevant as\nthe Ninth Circuit asserted, the fact that these two murders\nwere so different in character made each of them highly\npertinent in evaluating expert testimony of the sort envi\nsioned by the Court of Appeals.\n   The Ninth Circuit noted that the trial court retained\ndiscretion to exclude the Howard evidence even if Schick\nopened the door. Id., at 869–870, n. 20. If Schick had\ndoubts, the Court of Appeals contended, he could have\nsecured an answer in advance through a motion in limine.\nIbid. The trial judge, however, left little doubt where he\nstood. While ruling that the prosecution could not present\nthe evidence in its case in chief, Record 2254, the judge\nmade clear that it would come in for certain rebuttal\npurposes, id., at 2256, 2332–2334. When Schick elicited\ntestimony that Belmontes was not violent, for example,\nthe judge ordered it stricken and warned Schick that he\nwould admit the Howard murder evidence—to let the\nprosecution “go into the whole background”—if Schick\npressed forward. Id., at 2334.\n   In balancing the mitigating factors against the aggrava\ntors, the Court of Appeals repeatedly referred to the ag\ngravating evidence the State presented as “scant.” Bel\nmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 870, 873, 874, 875, 878. That\n12                 WONG v. BELMONTES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ncharacterization misses Strickland’s point that the review\ning court must consider all the evidence—the good and the\nbad—when evaluating prejudice. See Strickland, 466\nU. S., at 695–696, 700. Here, the worst kind of bad evi\ndence would have come in with the good. The only reason\nit did not was because Schick was careful in his mitigation\ncase. The State’s aggravation evidence could only be\ncharacterized as “scant” if one ignores the “elephant in the\ncourtroom”—Belmontes’ role in the Howard murder—that\nwould have been presented had Schick submitted the\nadditional mitigation evidence. Belmontes v. Ayers, 551\nF. 3d 864, 867 (CA9 2008) (Callahan, J., dissenting from\ndenial of rehearing en banc).\n   Even on the record before it—which did not include the\nHoward murder—the state court determined that Belmon\ntes “was convicted on extremely strong evidence that he\ncommitted an intentional murder of extraordinary brutal\nity.” Belmontes, 45 Cal. 3d, at 819, 755 P. 2d, at 354.\nThat court also noted that “[t]he properly admitted aggra\nvating evidence in this case—in particular, the circum\nstances of the crime—was simply overwhelming.” Id., at\n809, 755 P. 2d, at 348 (citation omitted). The Ninth Cir\ncuit saw the murder differently. It viewed the circum\nstances of the crime as only “conceivably significant” as an\naggravating factor. Belmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 871. In\nparticular, the Court of Appeals concluded that “[t]he\ncrime here did not involve . . . needless suffering on the\npart of the victim.” Ibid.\n   We agree with the state court’s characterization of the\nmurder, and simply cannot comprehend the assertion by\nthe Court of Appeals that this case did not involve “need\nless suffering.” The jury saw autopsy photographs show\ning Steacy McConnell’s mangled head, her skull crushed\nby 15 to 20 blows from a steel dumbbell bar the jury found\nto have been wielded by Belmontes. McConnell’s corpse\nshowed numerous “defensive bruises and contusions on\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)          13\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n[her] hands, arms, and feet,” id., at 839, which “plainly\nevidenced a desperate struggle for life at [Belmontes’]\nhands,” Belmontes, 755 P. 2d, at 354. Belmontes left\nMcConnell to die, but officers found her still fighting for\nher life before ultimately succumbing to the injuries\ncaused by the blows from Belmontes. Record 3. The jury\nalso heard that this savage murder was committed solely\nto prevent interference with a burglary that netted Bel\nmontes $100 he used to buy beer and drugs for the night.\nMcConnell suffered, and it was clearly needless.\n  Some of the error below may be traced to confusion\nabout the appropriate standard and burden of proof.\nWhile the Court of Appeals quoted the pertinent language\nfrom Strickland, that court elsewhere suggested it might\nhave applied something different. In explaining its preju\ndice determination, the Ninth Circuit concluded that “[t]he\naggravating evidence, even with the addition of evidence\nthat Belmontes murdered Howard, is not strong enough,\nin light of the mitigating evidence that could have been\nadduced, to rule out a sentence of life in prison.” Belmon\ntes, 529 F. 3d, at 875. But Strickland does not require the\nState to “rule out” a sentence of life in prison to prevail.\nRather, Strickland places the burden on the defendant,\nnot the State, to show a “reasonable probability” that the\nresult would have been different. 466 U. S., at 694. Un\nder a proper application of the Strickland standard, Bel\nmontes cannot carry this burden.\n  It is hard to imagine expert testimony and additional\nfacts about Belmontes’ difficult childhood outweighing the\nfacts of McConnell’s murder. It becomes even harder to\nenvision such a result when the evidence that Belmontes\nhad committed another murder—“the most powerful\nimaginable aggravating evidence,” as Judge Levi put it,\nBelmontes, S-89–0736, App. to Pet. for Cert. 183a—is\nadded to the mix. Schick’s mitigation strategy failed, but\nthe notion that the result could have been different if only\n14                  WONG v.

FERNANDO \n\n                BELMONTES, JR. \n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n             No. 08–1263. Decided November 16, 2009\n\n\n  JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring.\n  When Fernando Belmontes was sentenced to death in\n1982, California Penal Code §190.3(k)* conveyed the\nunmistakable message that juries could not give any\nmitigating weight to evidence that did not extenuate the\nseverity of the crime. See Ayers v. Belmontes, 549 U. S. 7,\n27 (2006) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). The trial judge who\npresided at Belmontes’ sentencing hearing so understood\nthe law, and his instructions to the jury reflected that\nunderstanding. See id., at 33–34. It was only later that\nboth the California Supreme Court and this Court\nsquarely held that a jury must be allowed to give weight to\nany aspect of a defendant’s character or history that may\nprovide a basis for a sentence other than death, even if\nsuch evidence does not “ ‘tend to reduce the defendant’s\nculpability for his crime.’ ” Id., at 28 (quoting Skipper v.\nSouth Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 11 (1986) (Powell, J., concur\nring in judgment)).\n  The testimony adduced at Belmontes’ sentencing hear\ning described his religious conversion and his positive\ncontributions to a youth rehabilitation program. Neither\nhis own testimony, nor that of the two ministers and the\nother witnesses who testified on his behalf, made any\nattempt to extenuate the severity of his crime. Their\ntestimony did, however, afford the jury a principled basis\nfor imposing a sentence other than death. See Ayers, 549\n——————\n * Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.3(k) (West 1988).\n2                  WONG v. BELMONTES\n\n                    STEVENS, J., concurring\n\nU. S., at 29–31 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). A review of the\nentire record, especially the colloquy between six jurors\nand the trial judge, makes it clear to me that “the jury\nbelieved that the law forbade it from giving that evidence\nany weight at all.” Id., at 36–39. I therefore remain con\nvinced that in its initial review of this case, the Court of\nAppeals correctly set aside Belmontes’ death sentence.\n   The narrow question that is now before us is whether\nthe additional mitigating evidence that trial counsel failed\nto uncover would have persuaded the jury to return a\ndifferent verdict. The evidence trial counsel might have\npresented hardly matters, however, because in my view\nthe conscientious jurors’ mistaken understanding of the\nlaw would have prevented them from giving that addi\ntional evidence “any weight at all,” id., at 39, let alone\ncontrolling weight. Despite my strong disagreement with\nthe Court’s decision to review this case once again, I nev\nertheless agree with the Court’s conclusion that trial\ncounsel’s failure to present additional mitigating evidence\nprobably did not affect the outcome of the trial.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/1757/", "sha1": "b604bf36a3971cd82bb86ca75967037ad3187d3a", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2009-007", "time_retrieved": "2010-04-15T12:40:18"}
