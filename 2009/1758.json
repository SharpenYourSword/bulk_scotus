VAN HOOK\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n             No. 09–144.   Decided November 9, 2009 \n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted\nhabeas relief to Robert Van Hook on the ground that he\ndid not receive effective assistance of counsel during the\nsentencing phase of his capital trial. Because we think it\nclear that Van Hook’s attorneys met the constitutional\nminimum of competence under the correct standard, we\ngrant the petition and reverse.\n                               I\n   On February 18, 1985, Van Hook went to a Cincinnati\nbar that catered to homosexual men, hoping to find some\none to rob. He approached David Self, and after the two\nspent several hours drinking together they left for Self’s\napartment. There Van Hook “lured Self into a vulnerable\nposition” and attacked him, first strangling him until he\nwas unconscious, then killing him with a kitchen knife\nand mutilating his body. State v. Van Hook, 39 Ohio St.\n3d 256, 256–257, 530 N. E. 2d 883, 884 (1988). Before\nfleeing with Self’s valuables, Van Hook attempted to cover\nhis tracks, stuffing the knife and other items into the body\nand smearing fingerprints he had left behind. Six weeks\nlater, police found him in Florida, where he confessed.\n   Van Hook was indicted in Ohio for aggravated murder,\nwith one capital specification, and aggravated robbery. He\nwaived his right to a jury trial, and a three-judge panel\nfound him guilty of both charges and the capital specifica\ntion. At the sentencing hearing, the defense called eight\nmitigation witnesses, and Van Hook himself gave an\n2                   BOBBY v. VAN HOOK\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\nunsworn statement. After weighing the aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances, the trial court imposed the\ndeath penalty.

E. 2d 328 (1993); State v. Van Hook, 70 Ohio\nSt. 3d 1216, 639 N. E. 2d 1199 (1994).\n  Van Hook filed this federal habeas petition in 1995. The\nDistrict Court denied relief on all 17 of his claims. Van\nHook v. Anderson, No. C–1–94–269 (SD Ohio, Aug. 7,\n2003), App. to Pet. for Cert. 123a, 163a. A panel of the\nSixth Circuit reversed, concluding that Van Hook’s confes\nsion was unconstitutionally obtained under Edwards v.\nArizona, 451 U. S. 477 (1981). See Van Hook v. Anderson,\n444 F. 3d 830, 832 (2006). The en banc Sixth Circuit\nvacated that ruling, holding the confession was proper,\nand it remanded the case to the panel to consider Van\nHook’s other claims. See Van Hook v. Anderson, 488 F. 3d\n411, 428 (2007). Van Hook petitioned for a writ of certio\nrari, which we denied. Van Hook v. Hudson, 552 U. S.\n1023 (2007).\n  On remand, the panel granted Van Hook habeas relief\nagain, but on different grounds, holding that his attorneys\nwere ineffective during the penalty phase because they did\nnot adequately investigate and present mitigating evi\ndence, neglected to secure an independent mental-health\nexpert, and requested and relied on a presentence investi\ngation report without objecting to damaging evidence it\ncontained. See Van Hook v. Anderson, 535 F. 3d 458, 461\n(2008). The en banc Sixth Circuit again vacated the\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\npanel’s opinion, but rather than hearing the case a second\ntime it remanded for the panel to revise its opinion. See\nVan Hook v. Anderson, 560 F. 3d 523, 524 (2009). In its\nthird opinion, the panel—relying on guidelines published\nby the American Bar Association (ABA) in 2003—granted\nrelief to Van Hook on the sole ground that his lawyers\nperformed deficiently in investigating and presenting\nmitigating evidence. See id., at 525. The State petitioned\nfor a writ of certiorari. We grant the petition and reverse.\n                             II\n  Because Van Hook filed his federal habeas petition\nbefore April 24, 1996, the provisions of the Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 do not apply. See\nLindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 327 (1997). Even without\nthe Act’s added layer of deference to state-court judg\nments, we cannot agree with the Court of Appeals that\nVan Hook is entitled to relief.\n                               A\n   The Sixth Amendment entitles criminal defendants to\nthe “ ‘effective assistance of counsel’ ”—that is, representa\ntion that does not fall “below an objective standard of\nreasonableness” in light of “prevailing professional\nnorms.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 686\n(1984) (quoting McMann v. Richardson, 397 U. S. 759,\n771, n. 14 (1970)). That standard is necessarily a general\none. “No particular set of detailed rules for counsel’s\nconduct can satisfactorily take account of the variety of\ncircumstances faced by defense counsel or the range of\nlegitimate decisions regarding how best to represent a\ncriminal defendant.” 466 U. S., at 688–689. Restatements\nof professional standards, we have recognized, can be\nuseful as “guides” to what reasonableness entails, but only\nto the extent they describe the professional norms prevail\ning when the representation took place. Id., at 688.\n   The Sixth Circuit ignored this limiting principle, relying\n4                   BOBBY v. VAN HOOK\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\non ABA guidelines announced 18 years after Van Hook\nwent to trial. See 560 F. 3d, at 526–528 (quoting ABA\nGuidelines for the Appointment and Performance of De\nfense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases 10.7, comment., pp.\n81–83 (rev. ed. 2003)). The ABA standards in effect in\n1985 described defense counsel’s duty to investigate both\nthe merits and mitigating circumstances in general terms:\n“It is the duty of the lawyer to conduct a prompt investiga\ntion of the circumstances of the case and to explore all\navenues leading to facts relevant to the merits of the case\nand the penalty in the event of conviction.” 1 ABA Stan\ndards for Criminal Justice 4–4.1, p. 4–53 (2d ed. 1980).\nThe accompanying two-page commentary noted that de\nfense counsel have “a substantial and important role to\nperform in raising mitigating factors,” and that\n“[i]nformation concerning the defendant’s background,\neducation, employment record, mental and emotional\nstability, family relationships, and the like, will be rele\nvant, as will mitigating circumstances surrounding the\ncommission of the offense itself.” Id., at 4–55.\n   Quite different are the ABA’s 131-page “Guidelines” for\ncapital defense counsel, published in 2003, on which the\nSixth Circuit relied. Those directives expanded what had\nbeen (in the 1980 Standards) a broad outline of defense\ncounsel’s duties in all criminal cases into detailed pre\nscriptions for legal representation of capital defendants.\nThey discuss the duty to investigate mitigating evidence\nin exhaustive detail, specifying what attorneys should look\nfor, where to look, and when to begin. See ABA Guidelines\n10.7, comment., at 80–85. They include, for example, the\nrequirement that counsel’s investigation cover every pe\nriod of the defendant’s life from “the moment of concep\ntion,” id., at 81, and that counsel contact “virtually every\none . . . who knew [the defendant] and his family” and\nobtain records “concerning not only the client, but also his\nparents, grandparents, siblings, and children,” id., at 83.\n                      Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)                     5\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\nJudging counsel’s conduct in the 1980’s on the basis of\nthese 2003 Guidelines—without even pausing to consider\nwhether they reflected the prevailing professional practice\nat the time of the trial—was error.\n  To make matters worse, the Court of Appeals (following\nCircuit precedent) treated the ABA’s 2003 Guidelines not\nmerely as evidence of what reasonably diligent attorneys\nwould do, but as inexorable commands with which all\ncapital defense counsel “ ‘must fully comply.’ ” 560 F. 3d, at\n526 (quoting Dickerson v. Bagley, 453 F. 3d 690, 693 (CA6\n2006)). Strickland stressed, however, that “American Bar\nAssociation standards and the like” are “only guides” to\nwhat reasonableness means, not its definition. 466 U. S.,\nat 688. We have since regarded them as such.1 See Wig\ngins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 524 (2003). What we have\nsaid of state requirements is a fortiori true of standards\nset by private organizations: “[W]hile States are free to\nimpose whatever specific rules they see fit to ensure that\ncriminal defendants are well represented, we have held\nthat the Federal Constitution imposes one general re\nquirement: that counsel make objectively reasonable\nchoices.” Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U. S. 470, 479 (2000).\n                            B\n  Van Hook insists that the Sixth Circuit’s missteps made\nno difference because his counsel were ineffective even\nunder professional standards prevailing at the time. He is\n——————\n   1 The narrow grounds for our opinion should not be regarded as ac\n\ncepting the legitimacy of a less categorical use of the Guidelines to\nevaluate post-2003 representation. For that to be proper, the Guide\nlines must reflect “[p]revailing norms of practice,” Strickland, 466 U. S.,\nat 688, and “standard practice,” Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 524\n(2003), and must not be so detailed that they would “interfere with the\nconstitutionally protected independence of counsel and restrict the wide\nlatitude counsel must have in making tactical decisions,” Strickland,\nsupra, at 689. We express no views on whether the 2003 Guidelines\nmeet these criteria.\n6                       BOBBY v. VAN HOOK\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\nwrong.\n   Like the Court of Appeals, Van Hook first contends that\nhis attorneys began their mitigation investigation too late,\nwaiting until he was found guilty—only days before the\nsentencing hearing—to dig into his background. See 560\nF. 3d, at 528. But the record shows they started much\nsooner. Between Van Hook’s indictment and his trial less\nthan three months later, they contacted their lay wit\nnesses early and often: They spoke nine times with his\nmother (beginning within a week after the indictment),\nonce with both parents together, twice with an aunt who\nlived with the family and often cared for Van Hook as a\nchild, and three times with a family friend whom Van\nHook visited immediately after the crime. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 380a–383a, 384a–387a. As for their expert wit\nnesses, they were in touch with one more than a month\nbefore trial, and they met with the other for two hours a\nweek before the trial court reached its verdict. Id., at\n382a, 386a. Moreover, after reviewing his military his\ntory, they met with a representative of the Veterans Ad\nministration seven weeks before trial and attempted to\nobtain his medical records. Id., at 381a, 386a. And they\nlooked into enlisting a mitigation specialist when the trial\nwas still five weeks away. Id., at 386a. The Sixth Circuit,\nin short, was simply incorrect in saying Van Hook’s law\nyers waited until the “last minute.” 560 F. 3d, at 528. Cf.\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 395 (2000) (counsel\nwaited “until a week before the trial” to prepare for the\nsentencing phase).\n   Nor was the scope of counsel’s investigation unreason\nable.2 The Sixth Circuit said Van Hook’s attorneys found\n——————\n  2 In his brief in this Court, Van Hook also alludes to his counsel’s\n\nfailure to obtain an independent mental-health expert and their reli\nance on (and failure to object to harmful evidence in) a presentence\ninvestigation report—grounds on which the Sixth Circuit panel previ\nously relied but which it abandoned in its final opinion. See supra, at\n                    Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)                  7\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\nonly “a little information about his traumatic childhood\nexperience,” 560 F. 3d, at 528, but that is a gross distor\ntion. The trial court learned, for instance, that Van Hook\n(whose parents were both “heavy drinkers”) started drink\ning as a toddler, began “barhopping” with his father at age\n9, drank and used drugs regularly with his father from\nage 11 forward, and continued abusing drugs and alcohol\ninto adulthood. App. to Pet. for Cert. 310a–312a, 323a–\n326a, 328a–330a, 373a. The court also heard that Van\nHook grew up in a “ ‘combat zone’ ”: He watched his father\nbeat his mother weekly, saw him hold her at gun- and\nknife-point, “observed” episodes of “sexual violence” while\nsleeping in his parents’ bedroom, and was beaten himself\nat least once. Id., at 321a, 338a–339a, 371a. It learned\nthat Van Hook, who had “fantasies about killing and war”\nfrom an early age, was deeply upset when his drug and\nalcohol abuse forced him out of the military, and at\ntempted suicide five times (including a month before the\nmurder), id., at 351a–353a, 372a. And although the ex\nperts agreed that Van Hook did not suffer from a “mental\ndisease or defect,” the trial court learned that Van Hook’s\nborderline personality disorder and his consumption of\ndrugs and alcohol the day of the crime impaired “his abil\nity to refrain from the [crime],” id., at 303a, and that his\n“explo[sion]” of “senseless and bizarre brutality” may have\nresulted from what one expert termed a “homosexual\npanic,” id., at 376a.\n   Despite all the mitigating evidence the defense did\npresent, Van Hook and the Court of Appeals fault his\ncounsel for failing to find more. What his counsel did\ndiscover, the argument goes, gave them “reason to suspect\nthat much worse details existed,” and that suspicion\n—————— \n\n2–3. Van Hook now concedes, however, that neither ground is a “basis\n\nfor issuing the writ,” Brief in Opposition 5; see also id., at 7, and\n\naccordingly we do not address them. \n\n8                        BOBBY v. VAN HOOK\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nshould have prompted them to interview other family\nmembers—his stepsister, two uncles, and two aunts—as\nwell as a psychiatrist who once treated his mother, all of\nwhom “could have helped his counsel narrate the true\nstory of Van Hook’s childhood experiences.” 560 F. 3d, at\n528. But there comes a point at which evidence from more\ndistant relatives can reasonably be expected to be only\ncumulative, and the search for it distractive from more\nimportant duties. The ABA Standards prevailing at the\ntime called for Van Hook’s counsel to cover several broad\ncategories of mitigating evidence, see 1 ABA Standards\n4–4.1, comment., at 4–55, which they did. And given all\nthe evidence they unearthed from those closest to Van\nHook’s upbringing and the experts who reviewed his his\ntory, it was not unreasonable for his counsel not to identify\nand interview every other living family member or every\ntherapist who once treated his parents. This is not a case\nin which the defendant’s attorneys failed to act while\npotentially powerful mitigating evidence stared them in\nthe face, cf. Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 525, or would have been\napparent from documents any reasonable attorney would\nhave obtained, cf. Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374, 389–\n393 (2005). It is instead a case, like Strickland itself, in\nwhich defense counsel’s “decision not to seek more” miti\ngating evidence from the defendant’s background “than\nwas already in hand” fell “well within the range of profes\nsionally reasonable judgments.” 466 U. S., at 699.3\n——————\n  3 In addition to the evidence the Sixth Circuit said his attorneys over\n\nlooked, Van Hook alleges that his lawyers failed to provide the expert\nwitnesses with a “complete set of relevant records or [his] complete\npsycho-social history.” Brief in Opposition 4. But he offers no support\nfor that assertion. He further claims that his counsel failed to obtain or\npresent records of his military service and prior hospitalizations, but\nthe record shows that they did review the former, see App. to Pet. for\nCert. 380a, and that the trial court learned (from one of the written\nexpert reports) all the relevant information Van Hook says it would\nhave gleaned from the latter, see id., at 373a–377a.\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n   What is more, even if Van Hook’s counsel performed\ndeficiently by failing to dig deeper, he suffered no preju\ndice as a result. See id., at 694. As the Ohio court that\nrejected Van Hook’s state habeas petition found, the affi\ndavits submitted by the witnesses not interviewed shows\ntheir testimony would have added nothing of value. See\nState v. Van Hook, No. C–910505, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1203049\"><a href=\"/opinion/1203049/van-hook-v-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">308350</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *2.\nOnly two witnesses even arguably would have added new,\nrelevant information: One of Van Hook’s uncles noted that\nVan Hook’s mother was temporarily committed to a psy\nchiatric hospital, and Van Hook’s stepsister mentioned\nthat his father hit Van Hook frequently and tried to kill\nVan Hook’s mother. App. to Pet. for Cert. 227a, 232a. But\nthe trial court had already heard—from Van Hook’s\nmother herself—that she had been “under psychiatric\ncare” more than once. Id., at 340a. And it was already\naware that his father had a violent nature, had attacked\nVan Hook’s mother, and had beaten Van Hook at least\nonce. See also id., at 305a (noting that Van Hook “suffered\nfrom a significant degree of neglect and abuse” throughout\nhis “chaotic” childhood). Neither the Court of Appeals nor\nVan Hook has shown why the minor additional details the\ntrial court did not hear would have made any difference.\n   On the other side of the scales, moreover, was the evi\ndence of the aggravating circumstance the trial court\nfound: that Van Hook committed the murder alone in the\ncourse of an aggravated robbery. See Ohio Rev. Code Ann.\n§2929.04(A)(7) (Lexis 2006). Van Hook’s confession made\nclear, and he never subsequently denied, both that he was\nthe sole perpetrator of the crime and that “[h]is intention\nfrom beginning to end was to rob [Self] at some point in\ntheir evening’s activities.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 295a; see\nid., at 276a–278a, 294a. Nor did he arrive at that inten\ntion on a whim: Van Hook had previously pursued the\nsame strategy—of luring homosexual men into secluded\nsettings to rob them—many times since his teenage years,\n10                  BOBBY v. VAN HOOK\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\nand he employed it again even after Self’s murder in the\nweeks before his arrest. See id., at 279a, 295a, 374a.\nAlthough Van Hook apparently deviated from his original\nplan once the offense was underway—going beyond steal\ning Self’s goods to killing him and disfiguring the dead\nbody—that hardly helped his cause. The Sixth Circuit,\nwhich focused on the number of aggravating factors in\nstead of their weight, see 560 F. 3d, at 530; cf. Ohio Rev.\nCode Ann. §2929.04(B), gave all this evidence short shrift,\nleading it to overstate further the effect additional miti\ngating evidence might have had.\n                        *    *     *\n  The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to\nproceed in forma pauperis are granted.

Because we think it\nclear that Van Hook’s attorneys met the constitutional\nminimum of competence under the correct standard, we\ngrant the petition and reverse.\n                               I\n   On February 18, 1985, Van Hook went to a Cincinnati\nbar that catered to homosexual men, hoping to find some\none to rob. He approached David Self, and after the two\nspent several hours drinking together they left for Self’s\napartment. There Van Hook “lured Self into a vulnerable\nposition” and attacked him, first strangling him until he\nwas unconscious, then killing him with a kitchen knife\nand mutilating his body. State v. Van Hook, 39 Ohio St.\n3d 256, 256–257, 530 N. E. 2d 883, 884 (1988). Before\nfleeing with Self’s valuables, Van Hook attempted to cover\nhis tracks, stuffing the knife and other items into the body\nand smearing fingerprints he had left behind. Six weeks\nlater, police found him in Florida, where he confessed.\n   Van Hook was indicted in Ohio for aggravated murder,\nwith one capital specification, and aggravated robbery. He\nwaived his right to a jury trial, and a three-judge panel\nfound him guilty of both charges and the capital specifica\ntion. At the sentencing hearing, the defense called eight\nmitigation witnesses, and Van Hook himself gave an\n2                   BOBBY v. VAN HOOK\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\nunsworn statement. After weighing the aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances, the trial court imposed the\ndeath penalty. The Ohio courts affirmed on direct appeal,\nid., at 265, 530 N. E. 2d, at 892; State v. Van Hook, No.\nC–85–0565, 1987 WL 11202 (Ohio App., May 13, 1987)\n(per curiam), and we denied certiorari, Van Hook v. Ohio,\n489 U. S. 1100 (1989). Van Hook also sought state post\nconviction relief, which the Ohio courts denied. State v.\nVan Hook, No. C–910505, 1992 WL 308350 (Ohio App.,\nOct. 21, 1992) (per curiam), appeal denied, 66 Ohio St. 3d\n1440, 608 N. E. 2d 1085, rehearing denied, 66 Ohio St. 3d\n1470, 611 N. E. 2d 328 (1993); State v. Van Hook, 70 Ohio\nSt. 3d 1216, 639 N. E. 2d 1199 (1994).\n  Van Hook filed this federal habeas petition in 1995. The\nDistrict Court denied relief on all 17 of his claims. Van\nHook v. Anderson, No. C–1–94–269 (SD Ohio, Aug. 7,\n2003), App. to Pet. for Cert. 123a, 163a. A panel of the\nSixth Circuit reversed, concluding that Van Hook’s confes\nsion was unconstitutionally obtained under Edwards v.\nArizona, 451 U. S. 477 (1981). See Van Hook v. Anderson,\n444 F. 3d 830, 832 (2006). The en banc Sixth Circuit\nvacated that ruling, holding the confession was proper,\nand it remanded the case to the panel to consider Van\nHook’s other claims. See Van Hook v. Anderson, 488 F. 3d\n411, 428 (2007). Van Hook petitioned for a writ of certio\nrari, which we denied. Van Hook v. Hudson, 552 U. S.\n1023 (2007).\n  On remand, the panel granted Van Hook habeas relief\nagain, but on different grounds, holding that his attorneys\nwere ineffective during the penalty phase because they did\nnot adequately investigate and present mitigating evi\ndence, neglected to secure an independent mental-health\nexpert, and requested and relied on a presentence investi\ngation report without objecting to damaging evidence it\ncontained. See Van Hook v. Anderson, 535 F. 3d 458, 461\n(2008). The en banc Sixth Circuit again vacated the\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\npanel’s opinion, but rather than hearing the case a second\ntime it remanded for the panel to revise its opinion. See\nVan Hook v. Anderson, 560 F. 3d 523, 524 (2009). In its\nthird opinion, the panel—relying on guidelines published\nby the American Bar Association (ABA) in 2003—granted\nrelief to Van Hook on the sole ground that his lawyers\nperformed deficiently in investigating and presenting\nmitigating evidence. See id., at 525. The State petitioned\nfor a writ of certiorari. We grant the petition and reverse.\n                             II\n  Because Van Hook filed his federal habeas petition\nbefore April 24, 1996, the provisions of the Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 do not apply. See\nLindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 327 (1997). Even without\nthe Act’s added layer of deference to state-court judg\nments, we cannot agree with the Court of Appeals that\nVan Hook is entitled to relief.\n                               A\n   The Sixth Amendment entitles criminal defendants to\nthe “ ‘effective assistance of counsel’ ”—that is, representa\ntion that does not fall “below an objective standard of\nreasonableness” in light of “prevailing professional\nnorms.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 686\n(1984) (quoting McMann v. Richardson, 397 U. S. 759,\n771, n. 14 (1970)). That standard is necessarily a general\none. “No particular set of detailed rules for counsel’s\nconduct can satisfactorily take account of the variety of\ncircumstances faced by defense counsel or the range of\nlegitimate decisions regarding how best to represent a\ncriminal defendant.” 466 U. S., at 688–689. Restatements\nof professional standards, we have recognized, can be\nuseful as “guides” to what reasonableness entails, but only\nto the extent they describe the professional norms prevail\ning when the representation took place. Id., at 688.\n   The Sixth Circuit ignored this limiting principle, relying\n4                   BOBBY v. VAN HOOK\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\non ABA guidelines announced 18 years after Van Hook\nwent to trial. See 560 F. 3d, at 526–528 (quoting ABA\nGuidelines for the Appointment and Performance of De\nfense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases 10.7, comment., pp.\n81–83 (rev. ed. 2003)). The ABA standards in effect in\n1985 described defense counsel’s duty to investigate both\nthe merits and mitigating circumstances in general terms:\n“It is the duty of the lawyer to conduct a prompt investiga\ntion of the circumstances of the case and to explore all\navenues leading to facts relevant to the merits of the case\nand the penalty in the event of conviction.” 1 ABA Stan\ndards for Criminal Justice 4–4.1, p. 4–53 (2d ed. 1980).\nThe accompanying two-page commentary noted that de\nfense counsel have “a substantial and important role to\nperform in raising mitigating factors,” and that\n“[i]nformation concerning the defendant’s background,\neducation, employment record, mental and emotional\nstability, family relationships, and the like, will be rele\nvant, as will mitigating circumstances surrounding the\ncommission of the offense itself.” Id., at 4–55.\n   Quite different are the ABA’s 131-page “Guidelines” for\ncapital defense counsel, published in 2003, on which the\nSixth Circuit relied. Those directives expanded what had\nbeen (in the 1980 Standards) a broad outline of defense\ncounsel’s duties in all criminal cases into detailed pre\nscriptions for legal representation of capital defendants.\nThey discuss the duty to investigate mitigating evidence\nin exhaustive detail, specifying what attorneys should look\nfor, where to look, and when to begin. See ABA Guidelines\n10.7, comment., at 80–85. They include, for example, the\nrequirement that counsel’s investigation cover every pe\nriod of the defendant’s life from “the moment of concep\ntion,” id., at 81, and that counsel contact “virtually every\none . . . who knew [the defendant] and his family” and\nobtain records “concerning not only the client, but also his\nparents, grandparents, siblings, and children,” id., at 83.\n                      Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)                     5\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\nJudging counsel’s conduct in the 1980’s on the basis of\nthese 2003 Guidelines—without even pausing to consider\nwhether they reflected the prevailing professional practice\nat the time of the trial—was error.\n  To make matters worse, the Court of Appeals (following\nCircuit precedent) treated the ABA’s 2003 Guidelines not\nmerely as evidence of what reasonably diligent attorneys\nwould do, but as inexorable commands with which all\ncapital defense counsel “ ‘must fully comply.’ ” 560 F. 3d, at\n526 (quoting Dickerson v. Bagley, 453 F. 3d 690, 693 (CA6\n2006)). Strickland stressed, however, that “American Bar\nAssociation standards and the like” are “only guides” to\nwhat reasonableness means, not its definition. 466 U. S.,\nat 688. We have since regarded them as such.1 See Wig\ngins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 524 (2003). What we have\nsaid of state requirements is a fortiori true of standards\nset by private organizations: “[W]hile States are free to\nimpose whatever specific rules they see fit to ensure that\ncriminal defendants are well represented, we have held\nthat the Federal Constitution imposes one general re\nquirement: that counsel make objectively reasonable\nchoices.” Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U. S. 470, 479 (2000).\n                            B\n  Van Hook insists that the Sixth Circuit’s missteps made\nno difference because his counsel were ineffective even\nunder professional standards prevailing at the time. He is\n——————\n   1 The narrow grounds for our opinion should not be regarded as ac\n\ncepting the legitimacy of a less categorical use of the Guidelines to\nevaluate post-2003 representation. For that to be proper, the Guide\nlines must reflect “[p]revailing norms of practice,” Strickland, 466 U. S.,\nat 688, and “standard practice,” Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 524\n(2003), and must not be so detailed that they would “interfere with the\nconstitutionally protected independence of counsel and restrict the wide\nlatitude counsel must have in making tactical decisions,” Strickland,\nsupra, at 689. We express no views on whether the 2003 Guidelines\nmeet these criteria.\n6                       BOBBY v. VAN HOOK\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\nwrong.\n   Like the Court of Appeals, Van Hook first contends that\nhis attorneys began their mitigation investigation too late,\nwaiting until he was found guilty—only days before the\nsentencing hearing—to dig into his background. See 560\nF. 3d, at 528. But the record shows they started much\nsooner. Between Van Hook’s indictment and his trial less\nthan three months later, they contacted their lay wit\nnesses early and often: They spoke nine times with his\nmother (beginning within a week after the indictment),\nonce with both parents together, twice with an aunt who\nlived with the family and often cared for Van Hook as a\nchild, and three times with a family friend whom Van\nHook visited immediately after the crime. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 380a–383a, 384a–387a. As for their expert wit\nnesses, they were in touch with one more than a month\nbefore trial, and they met with the other for two hours a\nweek before the trial court reached its verdict. Id., at\n382a, 386a. Moreover, after reviewing his military his\ntory, they met with a representative of the Veterans Ad\nministration seven weeks before trial and attempted to\nobtain his medical records. Id., at 381a, 386a. And they\nlooked into enlisting a mitigation specialist when the trial\nwas still five weeks away. Id., at 386a. The Sixth Circuit,\nin short, was simply incorrect in saying Van Hook’s law\nyers waited until the “last minute.” 560 F. 3d, at 528. Cf.\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 395 (2000) (counsel\nwaited “until a week before the trial” to prepare for the\nsentencing phase).\n   Nor was the scope of counsel’s investigation unreason\nable.2 The Sixth Circuit said Van Hook’s attorneys found\n——————\n  2 In his brief in this Court, Van Hook also alludes to his counsel’s\n\nfailure to obtain an independent mental-health expert and their reli\nance on (and failure to object to harmful evidence in) a presentence\ninvestigation report—grounds on which the Sixth Circuit panel previ\nously relied but which it abandoned in its final opinion. See supra, at\n                    Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)                  7\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\nonly “a little information about his traumatic childhood\nexperience,” 560 F. 3d, at 528, but that is a gross distor\ntion. The trial court learned, for instance, that Van Hook\n(whose parents were both “heavy drinkers”) started drink\ning as a toddler, began “barhopping” with his father at age\n9, drank and used drugs regularly with his father from\nage 11 forward, and continued abusing drugs and alcohol\ninto adulthood. App. to Pet. for Cert. 310a–312a, 323a–\n326a, 328a–330a, 373a. The court also heard that Van\nHook grew up in a “ ‘combat zone’ ”: He watched his father\nbeat his mother weekly, saw him hold her at gun- and\nknife-point, “observed” episodes of “sexual violence” while\nsleeping in his parents’ bedroom, and was beaten himself\nat least once. Id., at 321a, 338a–339a, 371a. It learned\nthat Van Hook, who had “fantasies about killing and war”\nfrom an early age, was deeply upset when his drug and\nalcohol abuse forced him out of the military, and at\ntempted suicide five times (including a month before the\nmurder), id., at 351a–353a, 372a. And although the ex\nperts agreed that Van Hook did not suffer from a “mental\ndisease or defect,” the trial court learned that Van Hook’s\nborderline personality disorder and his consumption of\ndrugs and alcohol the day of the crime impaired “his abil\nity to refrain from the [crime],” id., at 303a, and that his\n“explo[sion]” of “senseless and bizarre brutality” may have\nresulted from what one expert termed a “homosexual\npanic,” id., at 376a.\n   Despite all the mitigating evidence the defense did\npresent, Van Hook and the Court of Appeals fault his\ncounsel for failing to find more. What his counsel did\ndiscover, the argument goes, gave them “reason to suspect\nthat much worse details existed,” and that suspicion\n—————— \n\n2–3. Van Hook now concedes, however, that neither ground is a “basis\n\nfor issuing the writ,” Brief in Opposition 5; see also id., at 7, and\n\naccordingly we do not address them. \n\n8                        BOBBY v. VAN HOOK\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nshould have prompted them to interview other family\nmembers—his stepsister, two uncles, and two aunts—as\nwell as a psychiatrist who once treated his mother, all of\nwhom “could have helped his counsel narrate the true\nstory of Van Hook’s childhood experiences.” 560 F. 3d, at\n528. But there comes a point at which evidence from more\ndistant relatives can reasonably be expected to be only\ncumulative, and the search for it distractive from more\nimportant duties. The ABA Standards prevailing at the\ntime called for Van Hook’s counsel to cover several broad\ncategories of mitigating evidence, see 1 ABA Standards\n4–4.1, comment., at 4–55, which they did. And given all\nthe evidence they unearthed from those closest to Van\nHook’s upbringing and the experts who reviewed his his\ntory, it was not unreasonable for his counsel not to identify\nand interview every other living family member or every\ntherapist who once treated his parents. This is not a case\nin which the defendant’s attorneys failed to act while\npotentially powerful mitigating evidence stared them in\nthe face, cf. Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 525, or would have been\napparent from documents any reasonable attorney would\nhave obtained, cf. Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374, 389–\n393 (2005). It is instead a case, like Strickland itself, in\nwhich defense counsel’s “decision not to seek more” miti\ngating evidence from the defendant’s background “than\nwas already in hand” fell “well within the range of profes\nsionally reasonable judgments.” 466 U. S., at 699.3\n——————\n  3 In addition to the evidence the Sixth Circuit said his attorneys over\n\nlooked, Van Hook alleges that his lawyers failed to provide the expert\nwitnesses with a “complete set of relevant records or [his] complete\npsycho-social history.” Brief in Opposition 4. But he offers no support\nfor that assertion. He further claims that his counsel failed to obtain or\npresent records of his military service and prior hospitalizations, but\nthe record shows that they did review the former, see App. to Pet. for\nCert. 380a, and that the trial court learned (from one of the written\nexpert reports) all the relevant information Van Hook says it would\nhave gleaned from the latter, see id., at 373a–377a.\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n   What is more, even if Van Hook’s counsel performed\ndeficiently by failing to dig deeper, he suffered no preju\ndice as a result. See id., at 694. As the Ohio court that\nrejected Van Hook’s state habeas petition found, the affi\ndavits submitted by the witnesses not interviewed shows\ntheir testimony would have added nothing of value. See\nState v. Van Hook, No. C–910505, 1992 WL 308350, *2.\nOnly two witnesses even arguably would have added new,\nrelevant information: One of Van Hook’s uncles noted that\nVan Hook’s mother was temporarily committed to a psy\nchiatric hospital, and Van Hook’s stepsister mentioned\nthat his father hit Van Hook frequently and tried to kill\nVan Hook’s mother. App. to Pet. for Cert. 227a, 232a. But\nthe trial court had already heard—from Van Hook’s\nmother herself—that she had been “under psychiatric\ncare” more than once. Id., at 340a. And it was already\naware that his father had a violent nature, had attacked\nVan Hook’s mother, and had beaten Van Hook at least\nonce. See also id., at 305a (noting that Van Hook “suffered\nfrom a significant degree of neglect and abuse” throughout\nhis “chaotic” childhood). Neither the Court of Appeals nor\nVan Hook has shown why the minor additional details the\ntrial court did not hear would have made any difference.\n   On the other side of the scales, moreover, was the evi\ndence of the aggravating circumstance the trial court\nfound: that Van Hook committed the murder alone in the\ncourse of an aggravated robbery. See Ohio Rev. Code Ann.\n§2929.04(A)(7) (Lexis 2006). Van Hook’s confession made\nclear, and he never subsequently denied, both that he was\nthe sole perpetrator of the crime and that “[h]is intention\nfrom beginning to end was to rob [Self] at some point in\ntheir evening’s activities.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 295a; see\nid., at 276a–278a, 294a. Nor did he arrive at that inten\ntion on a whim: Van Hook had previously pursued the\nsame strategy—of luring homosexual men into secluded\nsettings to rob them—many times since his teenage years,\n10                  BOBBY v. VAN HOOK\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\nand he employed it again even after Self’s murder in the\nweeks before his arrest. See id., at 279a, 295a, 374a.\nAlthough Van Hook apparently deviated from his original\nplan once the offense was underway—going beyond steal\ning Self’s goods to killing him and disfiguring the dead\nbody—that hardly helped his cause. The Sixth Circuit,\nwhich focused on the number of aggravating factors in\nstead of their weight, see 560 F. 3d, at 530; cf. Ohio Rev.\nCode Ann. §2929.04(B), gave all this evidence short shrift,\nleading it to overstate further the effect additional miti\ngating evidence might have had.\n                        *    *     *\n  The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to\nproceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 558 U.

VAN HOOK\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n             No. 09–144.   Decided November 9, 2009 \n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO, concurring.\n   I join the Court’s per curiam opinion but emphasize my\nunderstanding that the opinion in no way suggests that\nthe American Bar Association’s Guidelines for the Ap\npointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death\nPenalty Cases (rev. ed. 2003) (2003 Guidelines or ABA\nGuidelines) have special relevance in determining whether\nan attorney’s performance meets the standard required by\nthe Sixth Amendment. The ABA is a venerable organiza\ntion with a history of service to the bar, but it is, after all,\na private group with limited membership. The views of\nthe association’s members, not to mention the views of the\nmembers of the advisory committee that formulated the\n2003 Guidelines, do not necessarily reflect the views of the\nAmerican bar as a whole. It is the responsibility of the\ncourts to determine the nature of the work that a defense\nattorney must do in a capital case in order to meet the\nobligations imposed by the Constitution, and I see no\nreason why the ABA Guidelines should be given a privi\nleged position in making that determination.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/1758/", "sha1": "8a7238415c05836b0576c5f3568b38b29bb91bce", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2009-008", "time_retrieved": "2010-04-15T12:40:19"}
