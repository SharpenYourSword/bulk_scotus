After\nCorcoran’s challenges to his sentence in the Indiana courts\nfailed, he sought federal habeas relief. Corcoran argued in\nhis federal habeas petition that: (1) the Indiana trial court\ncommitted various errors at the sentencing phase; (2) his\nsentence violated the Sixth Amendment; (3) Indiana’s\ncapital sentencing statute was unconstitutional; (4) the\nprosecution committed misconduct at sentencing; and (5)\nhe should not be executed because he suffers from a men\ntal illness.

The District Court granted\nhabeas relief on Corcoran’s claim of a Sixth Amendment\nviolation, and ordered the state courts to resentence Cor\ncoran to a penalty other than death. Id., at 725–726. The\nDistrict Court did not address Corcoran’s other arguments\nrelating to his sentence, noting that they were “rendered\nmoot” by the order that Corcoran be resentenced because\nof the Sixth Amendment violation.
