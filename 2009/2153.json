He continues to maintain his\ninnocence. Complaint ¶9. There was no physical evidence\ntying Johnson to the crime. See Johnson v. Bell, 525 F. 3d\n466, 490 (CA6 2008) (Cole, J., dissenting). In 1992 a\nchange in state law gave Johnson access, for the first time,\nto substantial evidence undermining key eyewitness tes­\ntimony against him. Id., at 473. This evidence calls into\nquestion the persuasive force of the eyewitness’ testimony,\nand, consequently, whether Johnson’s conviction was\ninfected with constitutional error. See Brady v. Maryland,\n373 U. S. 83 (1963); Johnson, 525 F. 3d, at 490 (Cole, J.,\ndissenting). The merits of Johnson’s Brady claim are not\nbefore us; we denied certiorari on this issue several\nmonths ago. No. 08–7163, 557 U. S. ___ (2009). But the\nconstitutional concerns raised by Judge Cole’s dissent only\nunderscore my strongly held view that state-caused delay\nin state-sponsored killings can be unacceptably cruel. See\nThompson, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3–4).2 We cannot\nknow as a definitive matter whether, if the State had not\nwithheld exculpatory evidence, Johnson would have been\nconvicted of these crimes. We do know that Johnson\nwould not have waited for 11 years on death row before\nthe State met its disclosure obligations. In short, this is as\ncompelling a case as I have encountered for addressing the\nconstitutional concerns that I raised in Lackey.\n——————\n  2 The possibility that there was constitutional error in Johnson’s case\n\nis far from unique. See Root, Cruel and Unusual Punishment: A\nReconsideration of the Lackey Claim, 27 N. Y. U. Rev. L. & Soc. Change\n281, 312–313 (2002) (discussing error rates in capital trials) (citing J.\nLiebman, J. Fagan, & V.

S. C. §1983. More typically, such claims have been\nbrought in habeas corpus. See, e.g., Thompson v. Secre\ntary for Dept. of Corrections, 517 F. 3d 1279, 1280 (CA11\n2008) (per curiam); Allen v. Ornoski, 435 F. 3d 946, 956–\n960 (CA9 2006); cf. Knight v. Florida, 528 U. S. 990, 998\n(1999) (BREYER, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari)\n(discussing Lackey claim raised after state resentencing on\nsuccessful habeas corpus petition). This case’s posture\nraises two important questions: whether a Lackey claim is\ncognizable under §1983; and, if it is not, whether a second\nfederal habeas petition raising a Lackey claim is a succes­\nsive petition under 28 U. S. C. §2244(b)(2). The Sixth\nCircuit agreed with the District Court’s conclusion that a\nstandalone Lackey challenge under §1983 is the “func­\ntional equivalent” of a habeas corpus challenge, App. to\nPet. for Cert. B-9 (District Court opinion), and thus must\nproceed under 28 U. S. C. §2244(b)(2)’s successive petition\nbar, see Allen, 435 F. 3d, at 956–960. The resolution of\nthese questions below poses a nearly insurmountable\nhurdle for those seeking to raise similar Eighth Amend­\nment challenges.\n   In my view, these procedural questions are inextricably\nlinked to the two underlying evils of intolerable delay.\nFirst, the delay itself subjects death row inmates to dec­\nades of especially severe, dehumanizing conditions of\nconfinement. See Thompson, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n2) (STEVENS, J., respecting denial of certiorari); Lackey,\n514 U. S., at 1046–1047 (same); see also Furman v. Geor\ngia, 408 U. S. 238, 288 (1972) (Brennan, J., concurring)\n(“[T]he prospect of pending execution exacts a frightful toll\nduring the inevitable long wait between the imposition of\nsentence and the actual infliction of death”). Second,\n“delaying an execution does not further public purposes of\nretribution and deterrence but only diminishes whatever\n4                  JOHNSON v. BREDESEN\n\n                    Statement of STEVENS, J.\n\npossible benefit society might receive from petitioner’s\ndeath.” Thompson, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2)\n(STEVENS, J., respecting denial of certiorari). In other\nwords, the penological justifications for the death penalty\ndiminish as the delay lengthens. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2);\nLackey, 514 U. S., at 1046–1047. Thus, I find constitu­\ntionally significant both the conditions of confinement and\nthe nature of the penalty itself.\n   In light of these coextensive concerns, I find it quite\ndifficult to conclude, as the courts below did, that John­\nson’s §1983 action is the functional equivalent of a habeas\npetition. Both the gravamen of petitioner’s complaint and\none of the central concerns animating Lackey is that the\n“method” of the State’s execution of a death sentence—a\nlengthy delay due in no small part to the State’s malfea­\nsance in this case—is itself unconstitutional. We have\nheld that “method” of execution claims are cognizable\nunder §1983. Hill v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 573, 580\n(2006); see also Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U. S. 637, 645–\n647 (2004). But a successful Lackey claim would have the\neffect of rendering invalid a particular death sentence,\nsuggesting that Johnson’s Lackey claim “directly call[s]\ninto question the ‘fact’ or ‘validity’ of the sentence itself,”\nNelson, 541 U. S., at 644. Were petitioner to prevail, it is\ntrue that the State will not be able to go forward in this\ncase “by simply altering its method of execution,” ibid. On\nthe other hand, it is equally true that, had the State not\ncarried out his sentence in this intolerably cruel manner,\nthe State would have been quite free, as a constitutional\nmatter, to “go forward with the sentence,” ibid.\n   Although the Court of Appeals’ treatment of Johnson’s\nclaim as a habeas challenge is a close question, its decision\nto apply §2244(b)(2)’s successive habeas bar is not. The\nSixth Circuit’s decision has the curious effect of forcing\nJohnson to bring a Lackey claim prematurely, possibly at a\n                    Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)                   5\n\n                       Statement of STEVENS, J.\n\ntime before it is ripe.3 Moreover, construing this claim as\nthe functional equivalent of a habeas action also has the\nunfortunate effect of inviting further delay: A petitioner\nwould be compelled to return to state court to exhaust his\nLackey claim in the first instance under 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(b)(1). For these reasons, I am persuaded that a\nLackey claim, like a claim that one is mentally incompe­\ntent to be executed, should, at the very least, not accrue\nuntil an execution date is set. See Ceja v. Stewart, 134\nF. 3d 1368, 1371–1372 (CA9 1998) (Fletcher, J., dissent­\ning); cf. Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U. S. 930, 945 (2007).\n  When I first expressed my views in Lackey, I did not\nenvision such procedural obstacles to the consideration of\na claim that nearly three decades of delay on death row,\nmuch of it caused by the State, has deprived a person of\nhis Eighth Amendment right to avoid cruel and unusual\npunishment. One does not need to accept the proposition\n“that the imposition of the death penalty represents ‘the\npointless and needless extinction of life with only marginal\ncontributions to any discernible social or public purposes,’”\nBaze v. Rees, 553 U. S. 35, ___, (2008) (slip op., at 17)\n(STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting Furman,\n408 U. S., at 312 (White, J., concurring)), in order to agree\nthat the imposition of the death penalty on these extreme\nfacts is without constitutional justification. Most regret­\ntably, a majority of this Court continues to find these\nissues not of sufficient weight to merit our attention.\n——————\n   3 The State argues, and the courts below agreed, that Johnson should\n\nhave brought his Eighth Amendment claim in the federal habeas\nproceeding he commenced in 1999. At that point in time, Johnson had\nbeen on death row for 18 years. This was one year longer than the\npetitioner in Lackey.
