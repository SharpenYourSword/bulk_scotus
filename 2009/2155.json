The petition for a writ of certiorari is\ndenied.\n   Statement of JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE\nGINSBURG and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join, respecting the\ndenial of the petition for writ of certiorari.\n   This case highlights once again the perversity of execut\ning inmates before their appeals process has been fully\nconcluded. Under our normal practice, Muhammad’s\ntimely petition for certiorari would have been reviewed at\nour Conference on November 24, 2009. Virginia has\nscheduled his execution for November 10, however, so we\nmust resolve the petition on an expedited basis unless we\ngrant a temporary stay. By denying Muhammad’s stay\napplication, we have allowed Virginia to truncate our\ndeliberative process on a matter—involving a death row\ninmate—that demands the most careful attention. This\nresult is particularly unfortunate in light of the limited\ntime Muhammad was given to make his case in the Dis\ntrict Court.\n   I continue to believe that the Court would be wise to\nadopt a practice of staying all executions scheduled in\nadvance of the completion of our review of a capital defen\n2                  MUHAMMAD v.

S. 942 (2007) (STEVENS,\nJ., joined by GINSBURG, J., respecting denial of certiorari);\nBreard v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371, 379 (1998) (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting). Such a practice would give meaningful effect\nto the distinction Congress has drawn between first and\nsuccessive habeas petitions. See 28 U. S. C. §2244(b). It\nwould also serve the interests of avoiding irreversible\nerror, facilitating the efficient management of our docket,\nand preserving basic fairness by ensuring death row in\nmates receive the same procedural safeguards that ordi\nnary inmates receive.\n   Having reviewed petitioner’s claims, I do not dissent\nfrom the Court’s decision to deny certiorari. “I do, how\never, remain firmly convinced that no State should be\nallowed to foreshorten this Court’s orderly review of . . .\nfirst-time habeas petition[s] by executing prisoners before\nthat review can be completed.” Emmett, 552 U.
