Decided October 13, 2009\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   Statement of JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join, respecting the\ndenial of the petition for writ of certiorari.\n   This case began with a contract action brought by DTD\nEnterprises, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner), a commercial\ndating-referral service, against respondent, one of peti\ntioner’s customers. The suit alleged that respondent\nrefused to make payments due under a contract. Respon\ndent answered by bringing a class action against peti\ntioner. The trial court certified the class and ordered\npetitioner to bear all the costs of class notification, on the\nsole ground (or so it appears) that petitioner could afford\nto pay and respondent could not.\n   To the extent that New Jersey law allows a trial court to\nimpose the onerous costs of class notification on a defen\ndant simply because of the relative wealth of the defen\ndant and without any consideration of the underlying\nmerits of the suit, a serious due process question is raised.\nWhere a court has concluded that a plaintiff lacks the\nmeans to pay for class certification, the defendant has\nlittle hope of recovering its expenditures later if the suit\nproves meritless; therefore, the court’s order requiring the\ndefendant to pay for the notification “finally destroy[s] a\nproperty interest.” Logan v.

And there is\nconsiderable force to the argument that a hearing in which\nthe trial court does not consider the underlying merits of\nthe class-action suit is not consistent with due process\nbecause it is not sufficient, or appropriate, to protect the\nproperty interest at stake.\n   I nonetheless agree with the Court’s denial of certiorari,\nfor two reasons. First, the petition is interlocutory; the\nstate appellate courts denied petitioner leave to appeal the\ntrial court’s action. Second, petitioner has filed for bank\nruptcy, and an automatic bankruptcy stay has issued\npursuant to 11 U. S. C. §362. Respondents contend that\nthe present action comes within the scope of the automatic\nstay. If we were to grant the petition we would be re\nquired to construe New Jersey law without the aid of a\nreasoned state appellate court decision and to confront a\nprocedural obstacle unrelated to the question presented.\nUnder these circumstances, it is best to deny the peti\ntion. It seems advisable, however, to note that the peti\ntion for certiorari does implicate issues of constitutional\nsignificance.\n</pre>", "id": 2158, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2009/10/13/DTD_Enterprises_Inc._v._Wells.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                  Cite as: 558 U.
