Argued October 7, 2009—Decided April 28, 2010\nIn 1934, members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) placed a\n  Latin cross on federal land in the Mojave National Preserve (Pre\n  serve) to honor American soldiers who died in World War I. Claiming\n  to be offended by a religious symbol’s presence on federal land, re\n  spondent Buono, a regular visitor to the Preserve, filed this suit al\n  leging a violation of the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause\n  and seeking an injunction requiring the Government to remove the\n  cross. In the litigation’s first stage (Buono I), the District Court\n  found that Buono had standing to sue and, concluding that the pres\n  ence of the cross on federal land conveyed an impression of govern\n  mental endorsement of religion, see Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S.\n  602, 612–613, it granted Buono’s requested injunctive relief (2002 in\n  junction). The District Court did not consider whether the Govern\n  ment’s actions regarding the cross had a secular purpose or caused\n  entanglement with religion. While the Government’s appeal was\n  pending, Congress passed the Department of Defense Appropriations\n  Act, 2004, §8121(a) of which directed the Secretary of the Interior to\n  transfer the cross and the land on which it stands to the VFW in ex\n  change for privately owned land elsewhere in the Preserve (land\n  transfer statute). Affirming the District Court’s judgment both as to\n  standing and on the merits, the Ninth Circuit declined to address the\n  statute’s effect on Buono’s suit or the statute’s constitutionality\n  (Buono II). Because the Government did not seek review by this\n  Court, the Court of Appeals’ judgment became final. Buono then re\n  turned to the District Court seeking injunctive relief against the land\n  transfer, either through enforcement or modification of the 2002 in\n  junction. In 2005, that court rejected the Government’s claim that\n2                         SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    the transfer was a bona fide attempt to comply with the injunction,\n    concluding, instead, that it was actually an invalid attempt to keep\n    the cross on display. The court granted Buono’s motion to enforce the\n    2002 injunction; denied as moot his motion to amend it; and perma\n    nently enjoined the Government from implementing the land\n    transfer statute (Buono III). The Ninth Circuit again affirmed,\n    largely following the District Court’s reasoning.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n502 F. 3d 1069 and 527 F. 3d 758, reversed and remanded.\n     JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined in full by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and in part\n  by JUSTICE ALITO, concluded:\n     1. Buono has standing to maintain this action. Whatever the valid\n  ity of the Government’s argument that Buono’s asserted injury—\n  offense at a religious symbol’s presence on federal land—is not per\n  sonal to him and so does not confer Article III standing, that argu\n  ment is not available at this stage of the litigation. The District\n  Court rejected the argument in Buono I, the Ninth Circuit affirmed\n  in Buono II, and the Court of Appeals’ judgment became final and\n  unreviewable upon the expiration of the 90-day deadline for filing a\n  certiorari petition, 28 U. S. C. §2101(c). Moreover, Buono had stand\n  ing in Buono III to seek application of the injunction against the\n  land-transfer statute. A party that obtains a judgment in its favor\n  acquires a “judicially cognizable” interest in ensuring compliance\n  with that judgment. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737. Buono’s en\n  titlement to an injunction having been established in Buono I and II,\n  he sought in Buono III to prevent the Government from frustrating or\n  evading that injunction. His interests in doing so were sufficiently\n  personal and concrete to support his standing, given the rights he ob\n  tained under the earlier decree against the same party as to the same\n  cross and the same land. The Government’s contention that Buono\n  sought to extend, rather than to enforce, the 2002 injunction is not an\n  argument about standing, but about the merits of the District Court’s\n  order. Pp. 7–9.\n     2. The District Court erred in enjoining the Government from im\n  plementing the land-transfer statute on the premise that the relief\n  was necessary to protect Buono’s rights under the 2002 injunction.\n  Pp. 9–18.\n        (a) A court may order an injunction only after taking into account\n  all the circumstances bearing on the need for prospective relief. See,\n  e.g., United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U. S. 106, 114. Here, the Dis\n  trict Court did not engage in the appropriate inquiry. The land\n  transfer statute was a substantial change in circumstances bearing\n  on the propriety of the requested relief. By dismissing as illicit the\n  motives of Congress in passing it, the District Court took insufficient\n                   Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\naccount of the context in which the statute was enacted and the rea\nsons for its passage. Placement of the cross on federal land by pri\nvate persons was not an attempt to set the state’s imprimatur on a\nparticular creed. Rather, the intent was simply to honor fallen sol\ndiers. Moreover, the cross stood for nearly seven decades before the\nstatute was enacted, by which time the cross and the cause it com\nmemorated had become entwined in the public consciousness. The\n2002 injunction thus presented the Government with a dilemma. It\ncould not maintain the cross without violating the injunction, but it\ncould not remove the cross without conveying disrespect for those the\ncross was seen as honoring. Deeming neither alternative satisfac\ntory, Congress enacted the land-transfer statute. The statute embod\nied a legislative judgment that this dispute is best resolved through a\nframework and policy of accommodation. The statute should not\nhave been dismissed as an evasion, for it brought about a change of\nlaw and a congressional statement of policy applicable to the case.\nPp. 9–13.\n     (b) Where legislative action undermines the basis for previous re\nlief, the relevant question is whether an ongoing exercise of the\ncourt’s equitable authority is supported by the prior showing of ille\ngality, judged against the claim that changed circumstances render\nprospective relief inappropriate. The District Court granted the 2002\ninjunction based solely on its conclusion that the presence of the cross\non federal land conveyed an impression of governmental endorsement\nof religion, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed on the same grounds. Nei\nther court considered whether the Government had acted based on an\nimproper purpose. Given this sole reliance on perception, any further\nrelief grounded on the injunction should have rested on the same ba\nsis. But the District Court used an injunction granted for one reason\n(perceived governmental endorsement) as the basis for enjoining con\nduct that was alleged to be objectionable for a different reason (an il\nlicit governmental purpose). Ordering relief under such circum\nstances was improper. The court failed to consider whether the\nchange in law and circumstances effected by the land-transfer statute\nhad rendered the “reasonable observer” standard inappropriate to re\nsolve the dispute. Nor did the court attempt to reassess Buono I’s\nfindings in light of the accommodation policy embraced by Congress.\nRather, it concentrated solely on the religious aspects of the cross, di\nvorced from its background and context. Pp. 13–17.\n     (c) The same respect for a coordinate branch of Government that\nforbids striking down an Act of Congress except upon a clear showing\nof unconstitutionality, see, e.g., United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S.\n598, 607, requires that a congressional command be given effect\nunless no legal alternative exists. Even if, contrary to the congres\n4                          SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    sional judgment, the land transfer were thought an insufficient ac\n    commodation in light of the earlier endorsement finding, it was in\n    cumbent upon the District Court to consider less drastic relief than\n    complete invalidation of the statute. See, e.g., Ayotte v. Planned Par\n    enthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 329. On remand, that\n    court should conduct a proper inquiry into the continued necessity for\n    injunctive relief in light of the statute. Pp. 17–18.\n       JUSTICE ALITO concluded that this case should not be remanded for\n    the lower courts to decide whether implementation of the land\n    transfer statute would violate the District Court’s injunction or the\n    Establishment Clause. Rather, because the factual record has been\n    sufficiently developed to permit resolution of these questions, he\n    would decide them and hold that the statute may be implemented.\n    The case’s singular circumstances presented Congress with a delicate\n    problem. Its solution was an approach designed to eliminate any\n    perception of religious sponsorship stemming from the location of the\n    cross on federally owned land, while avoiding the disturbing symbol\n    ism that some would associate with the destruction of this historic\n    monument. The mechanism Congress selected is quite common in\n    the West, a “land exchange,” whereby ownership of the land on which\n    the cross is located would be transferred to the VFW in exchange for\n    another nearby parcel of equal value. The land transfer would not\n    violate the District Court injunction, the obvious meaning of which\n    was simply that the Government could not allow the cross to remain\n    on federal land. Nor would the statute’s implementation constitute\n    an endorsement of religion in violation of the Establishment Clause.\n    The so-called “endorsement test” views a challenged religious display\n    through the eyes of a hypothetical reasonable observer aware of the\n    history and all other pertinent facts relating to the display. Here,\n    therefore, this observer would be familiar with the monument’s origin\n    and history and thereby appreciate that the transfer represents an\n    effort by Congress to address a unique situation and to find a solution\n    that best accommodates conflicting concerns. Finally, the statute\n    was not enacted for the illicit purpose of embracing the monument’s\n    religious message but to commemorate the Nation’s war dead and to\n    avoid the disturbing symbolism that would have been created by the\n    monument’s destruction. Pp. 1–7.\n       JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by JUSTICE THOMAS, concluded that this\n    Court need not—indeed, cannot—decide this case’s merits because\n    Buono lacks Article III standing to pursue the relief he seeks, which\n    is not enforcement of the original injunction but expansion of it. By\n    enjoining the Government from implementing the statute at issue,\n    the District Court’s 2005 order went well beyond the original injunc\n    tion’s proscription of the cross’s display on public property. Because\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     5\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  Buono seeks new relief, he must show that he has standing to pursue\n  that relief by demonstrating that blocking the land transfer will “re\n  dress or prevent an actual or imminently threatened injury to [him]\n  caused by private or official violation of law.” Summers v. Earth Is\n  land Institute, 555 U. S. ___, ___. He has failed, however, to allege\n  any such injury. Even assuming that being offended by a religious\n  display constitutes a cognizable injury, it is merely speculative\n  whether the cross will remain in place, and in any event Buono has\n  made clear, by admitting he has no objection to Christian symbols on\n  private property, that he will not be offended. Neither district courts’\n  discretion to expand injunctions they have issued nor this District\n  Court’s characterization of its 2005 order as merely enforcing the ex\n  isting injunction makes any difference. If in fact a court awards new\n  relief, it must have Article III jurisdiction to do so.

FRANK BUONO \n\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [April 28, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY announced the judgment of the Court\nand delivered an opinion, in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE\njoins and JUSTICE ALITO joins in part.\n   In 1934, private citizens placed a Latin cross on a rock\noutcropping in a remote section of the Mojave Desert.\nTheir purpose and intent was to honor American soldiers\nwho fell in World War I. The original cross deteriorated\nover time, but a reconstructed one now stands at the same\nplace. It is on federal land.\n   The Court is asked to consider a challenge, not to the\nfirst placement of the cross or its continued presence on\nfederal land, but to a statute that would transfer the cross\nand the land on which it stands to a private party. De\npartment of Defense Appropriations Act, 2004, Pub. L.\n108–87, §8121(a), 117 Stat. 1100. The District Court\npermanently enjoined the Government from implementing\nthe statute. The Court of Appeals affirmed. We conclude\nthat its judgment was in error.\n                        I\n                        A\n  The Mojave National Preserve (Preserve) spans ap\n2                   SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                   Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nproximately 1.6 million acres in southeastern California.\nThe Preserve is nestled within the Mojave Desert, whose\npicturesque but rugged territory comprises 25,000 square\nmiles, exceeding in size the combined area of the Nation’s\nfive smallest States. See Merriam-Webster’s Geographical\nDictionary 755, 1228–1230 (3d ed. 1997). Just over 90\npercent of the land in the Preserve is federally owned,\nwith the rest owned either by the State of California or by\nprivate parties. The National Park Service, a division of\nthe Department of the Interior, administers the Preserve\nas part of the National Park System.            16 U. S. C.\n§§410aaa–41 and 410aaa–46.\n   Sunrise Rock is a granite outcropping located within the\nPreserve. Sunrise Rock and the area in its immediate\nvicinity are federal land, but two private ranches are\nlocated less than two miles away. The record does not\nindicate whether fencing is used to mark the boundary of\nthese ranches. In 1934, members of the Veterans of For\neign Wars (VFW) mounted a Latin cross on the rock as a\nmemorial to soldiers who died in World War I. A Latin\ncross consists of two bars—a vertical one and a shorter,\nhorizontal one. The cross has been replaced or repaired at\nvarious times over the years, most recently in 1998 by\nHenry Sandoz. Sandoz is a private citizen who owns land\nelsewhere in the Preserve, a portion of which he is pre\npared to transfer to the Government in return for its\nconveyance to the VFW of the land on which the cross\nstands, all pursuant to the statute now under review.\n   The cross, as built by Sandoz, consists of 4-inch diame\nter metal pipes painted white. The vertical bar is less\nthan eight feet tall. It cannot be seen from the nearest\nhighway, which lies more than 10 miles away. It is visi\nble, however, from Cima Road, a narrow stretch of black\ntop that comes within 100 feet of Sunrise Rock.\n   The cross has been a gathering place for Easter services\nsince it was first put in place; and Sunrise Rock and its\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

At one\ntime the cross was accompanied by wooden signs stating\n“ ‘The Cross, Erected in Memory of the Dead of All Wars,’\nand ‘Erected 1934 by Members of Veterans of Foregin [sic]\nWars, Death Valley post 2884.’ ” Buono v. Kempthorne,\n527 F. 3d 758, 769 (CA9 2008). The signs have since\ndisappeared, and the cross now stands unmarked.\n                            B\n   Frank Buono, respondent here, is a retired Park Service\nemployee who makes regular visits to the Preserve.\nBuono claims to be offended by the presence of a religious\nsymbol on federal land. He filed suit in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Central District of California. He\nalleged a violation of the Establishment Clause of the\nFirst Amendment and sought an injunction requiring the\nGovernment to remove the cross.\n   The litigation proceeded in what can be described as\nfour stages. In the first, the District Court ruled in\nBuono’s favor on opposing motions for summary judgment.\nBuono v. Norton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2343153\"><a href=\"/opinion/2343153/buono-v-norton/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1202</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (CD Cal. 2002)\n(Buono I). As an initial matter, the court found that\nBuono had standing to maintain his Establishment Clause\nchallenge. Id., at 1210–1214. On the merits, the parties\nagreed that the dispute should be governed by the so\ncalled Lemon test, which the District Court formulated as\nfollows:\n    “A government religious practice or symbol will sur\n    vive an Establishment Clause challenge when it\n    (1) has a secular purpose, (2) has a primary effect that\n    neither advances nor inhibits religion, and (3) does\n    not foster excessive state entanglement with religion.”\n    Buono I, supra, at 1214–1215 (citing Lemon v. Kurtz\n    man, 403 U. S. 602, 612–613 (1971)).\nThe court expressly declined to consider whether the\n4                   SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nGovernment’s actions regarding the cross had a secular\npurpose, 212 F. Supp. 2d, at 1214–1215, or whether they\ncaused excessive entanglement with religion, id., at 1217,\nn. 9. Instead, the court evaluated the primary effect of the\ncross by asking how it would be viewed by a “reasonable\nobserver.” Id., at 1216. Concluding that presence of the\ncross on federal land conveyed an impression of govern\nmental endorsement of religion, the court granted Buono’s\nrequest for injunctive relief. The court’s order in Buono I\n(2002 injunction) permanently forbade the Government\n“from permitting the display of the Latin cross in the area\nof Sunrise Rock in the Mojave National Preserve.” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 146a.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir\ncuit stayed the 2002 injunction to the extent that it re\nquired the cross to be removed or dismantled but did not\nforbid alternative methods of complying with the order.\nThe Government covered the cross, first with a tarpaulin\nand later with a plywood box.\n   On appeal, the judgment of the District Court was af\nfirmed, both as to standing and on the merits of Buono’s\nEstablishment Clause challenge. Buono v. Norton, 371\nF. 3d 543 (CA9 2004) (Buono II). Like the District Court,\nthe Court of Appeals did not decide whether the Govern\nment’s action, or nonaction, with respect to the cross had\nbeen motivated by a secular purpose. Id., at 550. Its\nruling was based instead on the conclusion that a reason\nable observer would perceive a cross on federal land as\ngovernmental endorsement of religion. Id., at 549–550.\nThe Government did not seek review by this Court, so that\nthe judgment of the Court of Appeals in Buono II became\nfinal.\n                              C\n  During the relevant proceedings, Congress enacted\ncertain statutes related to the cross:\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n  (1) Before Buono I was filed, Congress passed an appro\npriations bill that included a provision forbidding the use\nof governmental funds to remove the cross. Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, 2001, Pub. L. 106–554, §133, 114 Stat.\n2763A–230.\n  (2) While Buono I was pending before the District Court,\nCongress designated the cross and its adjoining land “as a\nnational memorial commemorating United States partici\npation in World War I and honoring the American veter\nans of that war.” Department of Defense Appropriations\nAct, 2002, Pub. L. 107–117, §8137(a), 115 Stat. 2278. The\nSecretary of the Interior was directed to expend up to\n$10,000 to acquire a replica of the original cross and its\nmemorial plaque and to install the plaque at a suitable\nnearby location. §8137(c).\n  (3) Three months after Buono I was decided, Congress\nagain prohibited the spending of governmental funds to\nremove the cross. Department of Defense Appropriations\nAct, 2003, Pub. L. 107–248, §8065(b), 116 Stat. 1551.\n  (4) While the Government’s appeal in Buono II was\npending, Congress passed a statute (land-transfer statute)\ndirecting the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the\nVFW the Government’s interest in the land that had been\ndesignated a national memorial. Department of Defense\nAppropriations Act, 2004, Pub. L. 108–87, §8121(a), 117\nStat. 1100. In exchange, the Government was to receive\nland elsewhere in the preserve from Henry Sandoz and his\nwife. Ibid. Any difference in value between the two par\ncels would be equalized through a cash payment.\n§§8121(c), (d). The land-transfer statute provided that the\nproperty would revert to the Government if not main\ntained “as a memorial commemorating United States\nparticipation in World War I and honoring the American\nveterans of that war.” §8121(e), 117 Stat. 1100. The\nstatute presents a central issue in this case.\n  The Court of Appeals in Buono II did not address the\n6                   SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                   Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\neffect on the suit of a potential land transfer under the\nstatute. The court noted that the transfer might “take as\nlong as two years to complete,” 371 F. 3d, at 545, and that\nits effect was not yet known, id., at 545–546. The court\nthus “express[ed] no view as to whether a transfer com\npleted under [the statute] would pass constitutional mus\nter.” Id., at 546.\n                             D\n   After the Court of Appeals affirmed in Buono II, Buono\nreturned to the District Court seeking to prevent the land\ntransfer. He sought injunctive relief against the transfer,\neither through enforcement or modification of the 2002\ninjunction. In evaluating his request the trial court de\nscribed the relevant question as whether the land transfer\nwas a bona fide attempt to comply with the injunction (as\nthe Government claimed), or a sham aimed at keeping the\ncross in place (as Buono claimed). Buono v. Norton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2344226\"><a href=\"/opinion/2344226/buono-v-norton/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1175</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1178 (CD Cal. 2005) (Buono III). In\nBuono III, the court did not consider whether the transfer\nitself was an “independent violation of the Establishment\nClause.” Id., at 1182, n. 8. The court nevertheless con\ncluded that the transfer was an attempt by the Govern\nment to keep the cross atop Sunrise Rock and so was\ninvalid. The court granted Buono’s motion to enforce the\n2002 injunction; denied as moot his motion to amend it;\nand permanently enjoined the Government from imple\nmenting the land-transfer statute. Id., at 1182.\n   The Court of Appeals again affirmed, largely following\nthe reasoning of the District Court. Buono v. Kempthorne,\n502 F. 3d 1069 (CA9 2007). The Government’s motion for\nrehearing en banc was denied over a dissent by Judge\nO’Scannlain, 527 F. 3d 758, and this Court granted certio\nrari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n                              II\n   Before considering the District Court’s order on the\nmerits, the first inquiry must be with respect to Buono’s\nstanding to maintain this action. To demonstrate stand\ning, a plaintiff must have “alleged such a personal stake in\nthe outcome of the controversy as to warrant his invoca\ntion of federal-court jurisdiction.” Horne v. Flores, 557\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The Government argues that Buono’s\nasserted injury is not personal to him and so does not\nconfer Article III standing. As noted above, Buono does\nnot find the cross itself objectionable but instead takes\noffense at the presence of a religious symbol on federal\nland. Buono does not claim that, as a personal matter, he\nhas been made to feel excluded or coerced, and so, the\nGovernment contends, he cannot object to the presence of\nthe cross. Brief for Petitioners 12–17.\n   Whatever the validity of the objection to Buono’s stand\ning, that argument is not available to the Government at\nthis stage of the litigation. When Buono moved the Dis\ntrict Court in Buono I for an injunction requiring the\nremoval of the cross, the Government raised the same\nstanding objections it proffers now. Rejecting the Gov\nernment’s position, the District Court entered a judgment\nin Buono’s favor, which the Court of Appeals affirmed in\nBuono II. The Government did not seek review in this\nCourt. The judgment became final and unreviewable upon\nthe expiration of the 90-day deadline under 28 U. S. C.\n§2101(c) for filing a petition for certiorari. Toledo Scale\nCo. v. Computing Scale Co., 261 U. S. 399, 418 (1923); see\nMissouri v. Jenkins, 495 U. S. 33, 45 (1990) (90-day dead\nline is “mandatory and jurisdictional”). The Government\ncannot now contest Buono’s standing to obtain the final\njudgment in Buono I.\n   Of course, even though the Court may not reconsider\nwhether Buono had standing to seek the 2002 injunction,\n8                    SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nit is still necessary to evaluate his standing in Buono III to\nseek application of the injunction against the land\ntransfer statute. That measure of relief is embodied in the\njudgment upon which we granted review.\n   This was a measure of relief that Buono had standing to\nseek. A party that obtains a judgment in its favor ac\nquires a “judicially cognizable” interest in ensuring com\npliance with that judgment. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S.\n737, 763 (1984) (plaintiffs’ right to enforce a desegregation\ndecree to which they were parties is “a personal interest,\ncreated by law, in having the State refrain from taking\nspecific actions”). Having obtained a final judgment\ngranting relief on his claims, Buono had standing to seek\nits vindication.\n   The Government does not deny this proposition as a\ngeneral matter. Instead, it argues that Buono was not\nseeking to vindicate—but rather to extend—the 2002\ninjunction. The first injunction forbade the Government\nfrom maintaining the cross on Sunrise Rock; yet in Buono\nIII he sought to preclude the land transfer, a different\ngovernmental action. The Government contends that\nBuono lacked standing to seek this additional relief.\nReply Brief for Petitioners 5.\n   The Government’s argument, however, is properly ad\ndressed to the relief granted by the judgment below, not to\nBuono’s standing to seek that relief. The Government has\nchallenged whether appropriate relief was granted in\nBuono III in light of the relevant considerations and legal\nprinciples, and we shall consider these questions. The\nstanding inquiry, by contrast, turns on the alleged injury\nthat prompted the plaintiff to invoke the court’s jurisdic\ntion in the first place. Buono’s entitlement to an injunc\ntion having been established in Buono I and II, he sought\nin Buono III to prevent the Government from frustrating\nor evading that injunction. Based on the rights he ob\ntained under the earlier decree—against the same party,\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nregarding the same cross and the same land—his interests\nin doing so were sufficiently personal and concrete to\nsupport his standing. Although Buono also argued that\nthe land transfer should be prohibited as an “independent”\nEstablishment Clause violation, the District Court did not\naddress or order relief on that claim, which is not before\nus. Buono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1182, n. 8. This is not a\ncase in which a party seeks to import a previous standing\ndetermination into a wholly different dispute.\n  In arguing that Buono sought to extend, rather than to\nenforce, the 2002 injunction, the Government in essence\ncontends that the injunction did not provide a basis for\nthe District Court to invalidate the land transfer. This is\nnot an argument about standing but about the merits of\nthe District Court’s order. Those points now must be\naddressed.\n                              III\n  The procedural history of this litigation must be consid\nered to identify the issues now subject to review. The\nDistrict Court granted the 2002 injunction after conclud\ning that a cross on federal land violated the Establishment\nClause. The Government unsuccessfully challenged that\nconclusion on appeal, and the judgment became final upon\ncompletion of direct review. At that point, the judgment\n“became res judicata to the parties and those in privity\nwith them, not only as to every matter which was offered\nand received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but\nas to any other admissible matter which might have been\noffered for that purpose.” Travelers Indemnity Co. v.\nBailey, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 14) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The Government therefore\ndoes not—and could not—ask this Court to reconsider the\npropriety of the 2002 injunction or the District Court’s\nreasons for granting it.\n  The question now before the Court is whether the Dis\n10                   SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\ntrict Court properly enjoined the Government from im\nplementing the land-transfer statute. The District Court\ndid not consider whether the statute, in isolation, would\nhave violated the Establishment Clause, and it did not\nforbid the land transfer as an independent constitutional\nviolation. Buono III, supra, at 1182, n. 8. Rather, the\ncourt enjoined compliance with the statute on the premise\nthat the relief was necessary to protect the rights Buono\nhad secured through the 2002 injunction.\n   An injunction is an exercise of a court’s equitable au\nthority, to be ordered only after taking into account all of\nthe circumstances that bear on the need for prospective\nrelief. See United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U. S. 106, 114\n(1932). See also Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S.\n305, 312 (1982); Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U. S. 321, 329\n(1944); 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal\nPractice and Procedure §2942, pp. 39–42 (2d ed. 1995)\n(hereinafter Wright & Miller). Equitable relief is not\ngranted as a matter of course, see Weinberger, 456 U. S.,\nat 311–312, and a court should be particularly cautious\nwhen contemplating relief that implicates public interests,\nsee id., at 312 (“In exercising their sound discretion, courts\nof equity should pay particular regard for the public con\nsequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of in\njunction”); Harrisonville v. W. S. Dickey Clay Mfg. Co., 289\nU. S. 334, 338 (1933) (“Where an important public interest\nwould be prejudiced, the reasons for denying the injunc\ntion may be compelling”). Because injunctive relief “is\ndrafted in light of what the court believes will be the\nfuture course of events, . . . a court must never ignore\nsignificant changes in the law or circumstances underlying\nan injunction lest the decree be turned into an ‘instrument\nof wrong.’ ” Wright & Miller §2961, at 393–394 (quoting\nSwift & Co., supra, at 115).\n   Here, the District Court did not engage in the appropri\nate inquiry. The land-transfer statute was a substantial\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nchange in circumstances bearing on the propriety of the\nrequested relief. The court, however, did not acknowledge\nthe statute’s significance. It examined the events that led\nto the statute’s enactment and found an intent to prevent\nremoval of the cross. Deeming this intent illegitimate, the\ncourt concluded that nothing of moment had changed.\nThis was error. Even assuming that the land-transfer\nstatute was an attempt to prevent removal of the cross, it\ndoes not follow that an injunction against its implementa\ntion was appropriate.\n   By dismissing Congress’s motives as illicit, the District\nCourt took insufficient account of the context in which the\nstatute was enacted and the reasons for its passage.\nPrivate citizens put the cross on Sunrise Rock to com\nmemorate American servicemen who had died in World\nWar I. Although certainly a Christian symbol, the cross\nwas not emplaced on Sunrise Rock to promote a Christian\nmessage. Cf. County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liber\nties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 661\n(1989) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part) (“[T]he [Establishment] Clause forbids\na city to permit the permanent erection of a large Latin\ncross on the roof of city hall . . . because such an obtrusive\nyear-round religious display would place the government’s\nweight behind an obvious effort to proselytize on behalf of\na particular religion”). Placement of the cross on Govern\nment-owned land was not an attempt to set the imprima\ntur of the state on a particular creed. Rather, those who\nerected the cross intended simply to honor our Nation’s\nfallen soldiers. See Brief for Veterans of Foreign Wars of\nthe United States et al. as Amici Curiae 15 (noting that\nthe plaque accompanying the cross “was decorated with\nVFW decals”).\n   Time also has played its role. The cross had stood on\nSunrise Rock for nearly seven decades before the statute\nwas enacted. By then, the cross and the cause it com\n12                  SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nmemorated had become entwined in the public conscious\nness. See ibid. Members of the public gathered regularly\nat Sunrise Rock to pay their respects. Rather than let the\ncross deteriorate, community members repeatedly took it\nupon themselves to replace it. Congress ultimately desig\nnated the cross as a national memorial, ranking it among\nthose monuments honoring the noble sacrifices that con\nstitute our national heritage. See note following 16\nU. S. C. §431 (listing officially designated national memo\nrials, including the National D-Day Memorial and the\nVietnam Veterans Memorial). Research discloses no other\nnational memorial honoring American soldiers—more\nthan 300,000 of them—who were killed or wounded in\nWorld War I. See generally A. Leland & M. Oboroceanu,\nCongressional Research Service Report for Congress,\nAmerican War and Military Operations Casualties: Lists\nand Statistics 2 (2009). It is reasonable to interpret the\ncongressional designation as giving recognition to the\nhistorical meaning that the cross had attained. Cf. Van\nOrden v. Perry, 545 U. S. 677, 702–703 (2005) (BREYER, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (“40 years” without legal chal\nlenge to a Ten Commandments display “suggest that the\npublic visiting the [surrounding] grounds has considered\nthe religious aspect of the tablets’ message as part of what\nis a broader moral and historical message reflective of a\ncultural heritage”).\n   The 2002 injunction thus presented the Government\nwith a dilemma. It could not maintain the cross without\nviolating the injunction, but it could not remove the cross\nwithout conveying disrespect for those the cross was seen\nas honoring. Cf. id., at 704 (to invalidate a longstanding\nTen Commandments display might “create the very kind\nof religiously based divisiveness that the Establishment\nClause seeks to avoid”). Deeming neither alternative to be\nsatisfactory, Congress enacted the statute here at issue.\nCongress, of course, may not use its legislative powers to\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          13\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nreopen final judgments. See Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm,\nInc., 514 U. S. 211, 225–226 (1995). That principle, how\never, was not a bar to this statute. The Government’s\nright to transfer the land was not adjudicated in Buono I\nor compromised by the 2002 injunction.\n   In belittling the Government’s efforts as an attempt to\n“evade” the injunction, Buono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1182, the District Court had things backwards. Con\ngress’s prerogative to balance opposing interests and its\ninstitutional competence to do so provide one of the princi\npal reasons for deference to its policy determinations. See\nPatsy v. Board of Regents of Fla., 457 U. S. 496, 513\n(1982). Here, Congress adopted a policy with respect to\nland it now owns in order to resolve a specific controversy.\nCongress, the Executive, and the Judiciary all have a duty\nto support and defend the Constitution. See United States\nv. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 703 (1974) (“In the performance of\nassigned constitutional duties each branch of the Govern\nment must initially interpret the Constitution, and the\ninterpretation of its powers by any branch is due great\nrespect from the others”). The land-transfer statute em\nbodies Congress’s legislative judgment that this dispute is\nbest resolved through a framework and policy of accom\nmodation for a symbol that, while challenged under the\nEstablishment Clause, has complex meaning beyond the\nexpression of religious views. That judgment should not\nhave been dismissed as an evasion, for the statute brought\nabout a change of law and a congressional statement of\npolicy applicable to the case.\n   Buono maintains that any governmental interest in\nkeeping the cross up must cede to the constitutional con\ncerns on which the 2002 injunction was based. He argues\nthat the land transfer would be “an incomplete remedy” to\nthe constitutional violation underlying the injunction and\nthat the transfer would make achieving a proper remedy\nmore difficult. Brief for Respondent 54.\n14                  SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n   A court must find prospective relief that fits the remedy\nto the wrong or injury that has been established. See\nSwift & Co., 286 U. S., at 114 (“A continuing decree of\ninjunction directed to events to come is subject always to\nadaptation as events may shape the need”). See also\nUnited States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 391 U. S.\n244, 249 (1968). Where legislative action has undermined\nthe basis upon which relief has previously been granted, a\ncourt must consider whether the original finding of\nwrongdoing continues to justify the court’s intervention.\nSee Railway Employees v. Wright, 364 U. S. 642, 648–649\n(1961); Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87026\"><a href=\"/opinion/87026/pennsylvania-v-wheeling-belmont-bridge-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">421</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 430–432 (1856). The relevant question is\nwhether an ongoing exercise of the court’s equitable au\nthority is supported by the prior showing of illegality,\njudged against the claim that changed circumstances have\nrendered prospective relief inappropriate.\n   The District Court granted the 2002 injunction based\nsolely on its conclusion that presence of the cross on fed\neral land conveyed an impression of governmental en\ndorsement of religion. The court expressly disavowed any\ninquiry into whether the Government’s actions had a\nsecular purpose or caused excessive entanglement. Buono\nI, 212 F. Supp. 2d, at 1215, 1217, n. 9. The Court of Ap\npeals affirmed the injunction on the same grounds, simi\nlarly eschewing any scrutiny of governmental purpose.\nBuono II, 371 F. 3d, at 550.\n   Although, for purposes of the opinion, the propriety of\nthe 2002 injunction may be assumed, the following discus\nsion should not be read to suggest this Court’s agreement\nwith that judgment, some aspects of which may be ques\ntionable. The goal of avoiding governmental endorsement\ndoes not require eradication of all religious symbols in the\npublic realm. A cross by the side of a public highway\nmarking, for instance, the place where a state trooper\nperished need not be taken as a statement of governmen\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          15\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\ntal support for sectarian beliefs. The Constitution does\nnot oblige government to avoid any public acknowledg\nment of religion’s role in society. See Lee v. Weisman, 505\nU. S. 577, 598 (1992) (“A relentless and all-pervasive\nattempt to exclude religion from every aspect of public life\ncould itself become inconsistent with the Constitution”).\nSee also Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of\nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327,\n334 (1987) (“This Court has long recognized that the gov\nernment may (and sometimes must) accommodate reli\ngious practices and that it may do so without violating the\nEstablishment Clause” (internal quotation marks omit\nted)). Rather, it leaves room to accommodate divergent\nvalues within a constitutionally permissible framework.\n   Even assuming the propriety of the original relief,\nhowever, the question before the District Court in Buono\nIII was whether to invalidate the land transfer. Given the\nsole reliance on perception as a basis for the 2002 injunc\ntion, one would expect that any relief grounded on that\ndecree would have rested on the same basis. But the\nDistrict Court enjoined the land transfer on an entirely\ndifferent basis: its suspicion of an illicit governmental\npurpose. See Buono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1182. The\ncourt made no inquiry into the effect that knowledge of the\ntransfer of the land to private ownership would have had\non any perceived governmental endorsement of religion,\nthe harm to which the 2002 injunction was addressed.\nThe District Court thus used an injunction granted for one\nreason as the basis for enjoining conduct that was alleged\nto be objectionable for a different reason. Ordering relief\nunder such circumstances was improper—absent a finding\nthat the relief was necessary to address an independent\nwrong. See ibid., n. 8 (noting that the court “need not\nconsider [Buono’s] other contention that the land transfer\nitself is an independent violation of the Establishment\nClause”).\n16                   SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n   The District Court should have evaluated Buono’s modi\nfication request in light of the objectives of the 2002 in\njunction. The injunction was issued to address the im\npression conveyed by the cross on federal, not private,\nland. Even if its purpose were characterized more gener\nally as avoiding the perception of governmental endorse\nment, that purpose would favor—or at least not oppose—\nownership of the cross by a private party rather than by\nthe Government. Cf. Pleasant Grove City v. Summum,\n555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8) (“[P]ersons who\nobserve donated monuments routinely—and reasonably—\ninterpret them as conveying some message on the property\nowner’s behalf”).\n   Buono argues that the cross would continue to stand on\nSunrise Rock, which has no visual differentiation from the\nrest of the primarily federally owned Preserve. He also\npoints to the reversionary clause in the land-transfer\nstatute requiring that the land be returned to the Gov\nernment if not maintained as a World War I memorial.\nFinally, he notes that the cross remains designated a\nnational memorial by an Act of Congress, which arguably\nwould prevent the VFW from dismantling the cross even if\nit wanted to do so. Brief for Respondent 37–48.\n   The District Court failed to consider whether, in light of\nthe change in law and circumstances effected by the land\ntransfer statute, the “reasonable observer” standard con\ntinued to be the appropriate framework through which to\nconsider the Establishment Clause concerns invoked to\njustify the requested relief. As a general matter, courts\nconsidering Establishment Clause challenges do not in\nquire into “reasonable observer” perceptions with respect\nto objects on private land. Even if, however, this standard\nwere the appropriate one, but see County of Allegheny, 492\nU. S., at 668 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment in part\nand dissenting in part) (criticizing the “reasonable ob\nserver” test); Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          17\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nPinette, 515 U. S. 753 763–768 (1995) (plurality opinion)\n(criticizing reliance on “perceived endorsement”), it is not\nclear that Buono’s claim is meritorious. That test requires\nthe hypothetical construct of an objective observer who\nknows all of the pertinent facts and circumstances sur\nrounding the symbol and its placement. See id., at 780\n(O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg\nment). But see id., at 767–768 (plurality opinion) (doubt\ning the workability of the reasonable observer test). Ap\nplying this test here, the message conveyed by the cross\nwould be assessed in the context of all relevant factors.\nSee Van Orden, 545 U. S., at 700 (BREYER, J., concurring\nin judgment) (the Establishment Clause inquiry “must\ntake account of context and consequences”); Lee, supra, at\n597 (“Our Establishment Clause jurisprudence remains a\ndelicate and fact-sensitive one”).\n   The District Court did not attempt to reassess the find\nings in Buono I in light of the policy of accommodation\nthat Congress had embraced. Rather, the District Court\nconcentrated solely on the religious aspects of the cross,\ndivorced from its background and context. But a Latin\ncross is not merely a reaffirmation of Christian beliefs. It\nis a symbol often used to honor and respect those whose\nheroic acts, noble contributions, and patient striving help\nsecure an honored place in history for this Nation and its\npeople. Here, one Latin cross in the desert evokes far\nmore than religion. It evokes thousands of small crosses\nin foreign fields marking the graves of Americans who fell\nin battles, battles whose tragedies are compounded if the\nfallen are forgotten.\n   Respect for a coordinate branch of Government forbids\nstriking down an Act of Congress except upon a clear\nshowing of unconstitutionality. See United States v. Mor\nrison, 529 U. S. 598, 607 (2000); El Paso & Northeastern\nR. Co. v. Gutierrez, 215 U. S. 87, 96 (1909). The same\nrespect requires that a congressional command be given\n18                  SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\neffect unless no legal alternative exists. Even if, contrary\nto the congressional judgment, the land transfer were\nthought an insufficient accommodation in light of the\nearlier finding of religious endorsement, it was incumbent\nupon the District Court to consider less drastic relief than\ncomplete invalidation of the land-transfer statute. See\nAyotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546\nU. S. 320, 329 (2006) (in granting relief, “we try not to\nnullify more of a legislature’s work than is necessary, for\nwe know that [a] ruling of unconstitutionality frustrates\nthe intent of the elected representatives of the people”\n(internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original));\nAlaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U. S. 678, 684 (1987).\nFor instance, if there is to be a conveyance, the question\nmight arise regarding the necessity of further action, such\nas signs to indicate the VFW’s ownership of the land. As\nwe have noted, Congress directed the Secretary of the\nInterior to install near the cross a replica of its original\nmemorial plaque. One of the signs that appears in early\nphotographs of the cross specifically identifies the VFW as\nthe group that erected it.\n   Noting the possibility of specific remedies, however, is\nnot an indication of agreement about the continued neces\nsity for injunctive relief. The land-transfer statute’s bear\ning on this dispute must first be determined. To date, this\nCourt’s jurisprudence in this area has refrained from\nmaking sweeping pronouncements, and this case is ill\nsuited for announcing categorical rules.

The cross is of\ncourse the preeminent symbol of Christianity, and Easter\nservices have long been held on Sunrise Rock, 371 F. 3d\n543, 548 (CA9 2004). But, as noted, the original reason for\nthe placement of the cross was to commemorate American\nwar dead and, particularly for those with searing memo\nries of The Great War, the symbol that was selected, a\nplain unadorned white cross, no doubt evoked the unfor\ngettable image of the white crosses, row on row, that\nmarked the final resting places of so many American\nsoldiers who fell in that conflict.\n   This is roughly how things stood until the plaintiff in\n\n——————\n  8 See Dept. of Interior, National Park Service, Mojave National Pre\nserve, Operating Hours & Seasons, http://www.nps.gov/moja/planyourvisit/\nhours.htm; D.

After the\nNinth Circuit affirmed that decision, and the Government\nelected not to seek review by this Court, Congress faced a\nproblem.\n  If Congress had done nothing, the Government would\nhave been required to take down the cross, which had\nstood on Sunrise Rock for nearly 70 years, and this re\nmoval would have been viewed by many as a sign of disre\nspect for the brave soldiers whom the cross was meant to\nhonor. The demolition of this venerable if unsophisticated,\nmonument would also have been interpreted by some as an\narresting symbol of a Government that is not neutral but\nhostile on matters of religion and is bent on eliminating\nfrom all public places and symbols any trace of our coun\ntry’s religious heritage. Cf. Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U. S.\n677, 704 (2005) (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment).\n  One possible solution would have been to supplement\nthe monument on Sunrise Rock so that it appropriately\nrecognized the religious diversity of the American soldiers\nwho gave their lives in the First World War. In American\nmilitary cemeteries overseas, the graves of soldiers who\nperished in that war were marked with either a white\ncross or a white Star of David.9 More than 3,500 Jewish\n——————\n  9 See D. Holt, American Military Cemeteries 473, 474 (1992); see\n\nalso American Battle Monuments Commission, http://www.abmc.gov/\ncemeteries / cemeteries.php (containing photographs of the two\ntypes of markers). This policy presumably reflected the relig\nious makeup of the Armed Forces at the time of the First World\nWar. Today, veterans and their families may select any of 39\ntypes of headstones. See U.

But Congress may\nwell have thought—not without reason—that the addition\nof yet another religious symbol would have been unlikely\nto satisfy the plaintiff, his attorneys, or the lower courts\nthat had found the existing monument to be uncon\nstitutional on the ground that it impermissibly endorsed\nreligion.\n  Congress chose an alternative approach that was de\nsigned to eliminate any perception of religious sponsorship\nstemming from the location of the cross on federally owned\nland, while at the same time avoiding the disturbing\nsymbolism associated with the destruction of the historic\nmonument. The mechanism that Congress selected is one\nthat is quite common in the West, a “land exchange.”11\nCongress enacted a law under which ownership of the\nparcel of land on which Sunrise Rock is located would be\ntransferred to the VFW in exchange for another nearby\nparcel of equal value. Congress required that the Sunrise\nRock parcel be used for a war memorial, §8121(a), 117\nStat. 1100, but Congress did not prevent the VFW from\nsupplementing the existing monument or replacing it with\na war memorial of a different design.

BUONO\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nSTEVENS characterizes this land exchange as one that\nendorses “a particular religious view,” post, at 26 (dissent\ning opinion), it is noteworthy that Congress, in which our\ncountry’s religious diversity is well represented, passed\nthis law by overwhelming majorities: 95–0 in the Senate\nand 407–15 in the House. See 149 Cong. Rec. H8793\n(Sept. 24, 2003); id., at S11943 (Sept. 25, 2003). In my\nview, there is no legal ground for blocking the implemen\ntation of this law.\n   The dissent contends that the land transfer would vio\nlate the District Court injunction, but that argument, for\nthe reasons explained in JUSTICE SCALIA’s opinion, see\npost, at 2 (concurring in judgment), is plainly unsound.\nThe obvious meaning of the injunction was simply that the\nGovernment could not allow the cross to remain on federal\nland.\n   There is also no merit in JUSTICE STEVENS’ contention\nthat implementation of the statute would constitute an\nendorsement of Christianity and would thus violate the\nEstablishment Clause. Assuming that it is appropriate to\napply the so-called “endorsement test,” this test would not\nbe violated by the land exchange. The endorsement test\nviews a challenged display through the eyes of a hypo\nthetical reasonable observer who is deemed to be aware of\nthe history and all other pertinent facts relating to a\nchallenged display.      See ante, at 16–17 (opinion of\nKENNEDY, J.). Here, therefore, this observer would be\nfamiliar with the origin and history of the monument and\nwould also know both that the land on which the monu\nment is located is privately owned and that the new owner\nis under no obligation to preserve the monument’s present\ndesign. With this knowledge, a reasonable observer would\nnot view the land exchange as the equivalent of the con\nstruction of an official World War I memorial on the Na\ntional Mall. Cf. post, at 26.

S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 70) (STEVENS, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). Congress has\nshown notable solicitude for the rights of religious minori\nties.

I would not jump to the conclusion that Congress’ aim\nin enacting the land-transfer law was to embrace the\nreligious message of the cross; rather, I see no reason to\ndoubt that Congress’ consistent goal, in legislating with\nregard to the Sunrise Rock monument, has been to com\nmemorate our Nation’s war dead and to avoid the disturb\ning symbolism that would have been created by the de\nstruction of the monument.\n   For these reasons, I would reverse the decision below\nand remand with instructions to vacate the order prohibit\ning the implementation of the land-transfer statute.\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

My reason, however, is quite different: In my view\nwe need not—indeed, cannot—decide the merits of the\nparties’ dispute, because Frank Buono lacks Article III\nstanding to pursue the relief he seeks. The District Court\nhad no power to award the requested relief, and our au\nthority is limited to “ ‘announcing the fact and dismissing\nthe cause.’ ” Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment,\n523 U. S. 83, 94 (1998) (quoting Ex parte McCardle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88034\"><a href=\"/opinion/88034/ex-parte-mccardle/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 514 (1869)).\n  The plurality is correct that Buono’s standing to obtain\nthe original injunction is not before us. See ante, at 7.1\n——————\n   1 The Court of Appeals’ conclusion that Buono had standing to seek\n\nthe original injunction does not, however, control our decision here\nunder the law-of-the-case doctrine. That doctrine comes into play only\nif an issue we are asked to resolve has already been decided in the same\nlitigation. See Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S. 332, 347, n. 18 (1979). In its\nearlier decision, the Ninth Circuit addressed only Buono’s standing to\nseek the original injunction barring the display of the cross on public\nland. See Buono v. Norton, 371 F. 3d 543, 546–548 (2004). It had no\noccasion to address his standing to seek an expansion of the injunction\nto bar a transfer enabling the cross’s display on private property.\n2                        SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nNor is Buono’s standing to request enforcement of the\noriginal injunction at issue. If he sought only to compel\ncompliance with the existing order, Article III would not\nstand in his way.\n  As the plurality all but admits, however, the relief\nBuono requests and the District Court awarded in this\nproceeding is not enforcement of the original injunction\nbut expansion of it. See ante, at 15. The only reasonable\nreading of the original injunction, in context, is that it\nproscribed the cross’s display on federal land. Buono’s\nalleged injuries arose from the cross’s presence on public\nproperty, see App. 50, 59, and the injunction accordingly\nprohibited the Government, its “employees, agents, and\nthose in active concert with [them] . . . from permitting the\ndisplay of the Latin cross in the area of Sunrise Rock in\nthe Mojave National Preserve.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n146a. Barring the Government from “permitting” the\ncross’s display at a particular location makes sense only if\nthe Government owns the location. As the proprietor, it\ncan remove the cross that private parties have erected and\ndeny permission to erect another. But if the land is pri\nvately owned, the Government can prevent the cross’s\ndisplay only by making it illegal. Prohibitory legislation\ndoes not consist of a mere refusal to “permi[t],” nor is the\nenactment of legislation what the injunction commanded\n(a command that would raise serious First Amendment\nand separation-of-powers questions).2\n——————\nMoreover, Buono failed to raise the issue in his brief in opposition to\ncertiorari, and we may deem it waived. See this Court’s Rule 15.2; cf.\nKnowles v. Iowa, 525 U. S. 113, 116, n. 2 (1998).\n  2 The principal dissent does not dispute that the original injunction\n\ndid not require the Government to ban the cross’s display on private\nland, yet it insists that the injunction nonetheless forbade transferring\nthe land to a private party who could keep the cross in place. Post, at\n6–7 (opinion of STEVENS, J.). But there is no basis in the injunction’s\ntext for treating a sale of the land to a private purchaser who does not\npromise to take the cross down as “permitting” the cross’s display,\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

Id., at 98a. At\nBuono’s request, the court enjoined certain Government\nofficials and “anyone acting in concert with them . . . from\nimplementing the provisions of Section 8121 of Public Law\n108–87,” the statutory provision enacted after the original\ninjunction that directs the Executive Branch to transfer\nthe memorial to the VFW. Id., at 99a.\n   Because Buono seeks new relief, he must show (and the\nDistrict Court should have ensured) that he has standing\nto pursue it. As the party invoking federal-court jurisdic\ntion, Buono “bears the burden of showing that he has\nstanding for each type of relief sought,” Summers v. Earth\nIsland Institute, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 4);\nsee Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 105 (1983). A\nplaintiff cannot sidestep Article III’s requirements by\ncombining a request for injunctive relief for which he has\nstanding with a request for injunctive relief for which he\nlacks standing. And for the same reason, a plaintiff can\nnot ask a court to expand an existing injunction unless he\nhas standing to seek the additional relief.\n   Buono must therefore demonstrate that the additional\nrelief he sought—blocking the transfer of the memorial to\na private party—will “redress or prevent actual or immi\nnently threatened injury to [him] caused by private or\n——————\nwhen failing to forbid the cross’s presence on already-private land\nwithin the Mojave National Preserve would not be treated as such. The\nlatter no less involves “allow[ing] the act or existence of” or “tol\nerat[ing]” the display of the cross. Webster’s New International Dic\ntionary 1824 (2d ed. 1957). The principal dissent responds that in\ndetermining whether the transfer complies with the original injunction\nwe “cannot start from a baseline in which the cross has already been\ntransferred.” Post, at 7. But the effect of transferring the land to a\nprivate party free to keep the cross standing is identical, so far as the\noriginal injunction is concerned, to allowing a party who already owned\nthe land to leave the cross in place.\n4                         SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nofficial violation of law.” Summers, supra, at ___ (slip op.,\nat 4). He has failed, however, to allege any actual or\nimminent injury. To begin with, the predicate for any\ninjury he might assert—that the VFW, after taking pos\nsession of the land, will continue to display the cross—is at\nthis stage merely speculative.3 Nothing in the statutes\ncompels the VFW (or any future proprietor) to keep it up.\nThe land reverts back to the Government only if “the\nconveyed property is no longer being maintained as a war\nmemorial,” Pub. L. 108–87, §8121(e), 117 Stat. 1100,\nwhich does not depend on whether the cross remains.4\n   Moreover, Buono has not alleged, much less established,\nthat he will be harmed if the VFW does decide to keep the\ncross. To the contrary, his amended complaint averred\nthat “he is deeply offended by the display of a Latin Cross\non government-owned property” but “has no objection to\nChristian symbols on private property.” App. 50. In a\nsubsequent deposition he agreed with the statement that\n“[t]he only thing that’s offensive about this cross is that\n[he has] discovered that it’s located on federal land.” Id.,\nat 85. And in a signed declaration several months later,\n——————\n   3 Buono argues that the Government’s continued supervision of the\n\nsite, its reversionary interest in the property, and the memorial’s\nongoing designation as a national memorial add to the Establishment\nClause violation.

But those aspects would\nbe irrelevant if the cross were no longer displayed.\n   4 The principal dissent insists, post, at 4–5, n. 2, that it is clear the\n\ncross will remain because the VFW asserted in an amicus brief that it\n“intends to maintain and preserve the Veterans Memorial as a memo\nrial to United States veterans,” and elsewhere referred to “the seven\nfoot-tall cross and plaque that comprise the Veterans Memorial,” Brief\nfor VFW of the United States et al. as Amici Curiae 4, 7. But the\ngroup’s stated intentions do not prove that the cross will stay put. The\nVFW might not follow through on its plans (this VFW post already\nbecame “defunct” once during this litigation, id., at 34); it might move\nthe cross to another private parcel and substitute a different monument\non Sunrise Rock; or it might sell the land to someone else who decides\nto honor the dead without the cross.\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

In short, even assuming that being “deeply of\nfended” by a religious display (and taking steps to avoid\nseeing it) constitutes a cognizable injury, Buono has made\nclear that he will not be offended.5\n   These same considerations bear upon the plurality’s\nassertion that Buono has standing to “prevent the Gov\nernment from frustrating or evading” the original injunc\ntion, ante, at 8. If this refers to frustration or evasion in a\nnarrow sense, the injunction is in no need of—indeed, is\ninsusceptible of—protection. It was issued to remedy the\nsole complaint that Buono had brought forward: erection\nof a cross on public land. And it was entirely effective in\nremedying that complaint, having induced Congress to\nabandon public ownership of the land. If meant in this\nnarrow sense, the plurality’s assertion of a need to prevent\nfrustration or evasion by the Government ignores the\nreality that the District Court’s 2005 order awarded new\nrelief beyond the scope of the original injunction. The\nrevised injunction is directed at Buono’s new complaint\nthat the manner of abandoning public ownership and the\n——————\n  5 The principal dissent argues that despite these disclaimers in\n\nBuono’s complaint, deposition, and declaration, his real injury is his\ninability “to freely use the area of the Preserve around the cross be\ncause the Government’s unconstitutional endorsement of the cross will\ninduce him to avoid the Sunrise Rock area.” Post, at 4–5, n. 2 (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted). But the only “endorsement” of\nwhich Buono complained was “[t]he placement of the Cross on feder\nally-owned land,” App. 59, which “offend[s]” him only because the\nproperty “is not open to groups and individuals to erect other freestand\ning, permanent displays,” App. 50. Nothing in Buono’s complaint,\ndeposition, or declaration establishes that he will be unable “to freely\nuse the area of the Preserve” if Sunrise Rock is made private property\nand its new proprietor displays the cross.\n6                        SALAZAR v.

Now it may be that a court has subject\nmatter jurisdiction to prevent frustration or evasion of its\nprior injunction in a broader sense—that is, to eliminate\nan unconstitutional manner of satisfying that prior injunc\ntion. But it surely cannot do so unless it has before it\nsomeone who has standing to complain of that unconstitu\ntional manner. If preventing frustration or evasion of an\ninjunction includes expanding it to cover additional ac\ntions that produce no concrete harm to the original plain\ntiff, our standing law in this area will make no sense.\n   It is no answer that a district court has discretion to\nexpand an injunction it has issued if it finds the existing\nterms are not fulfilling the original purpose. Doubtless it\ncan do that, and is in that sense the master of its own\ninjunctions. But whether the District Court abused that\ndiscretion by enlarging the injunction is beside the point.\nWhat matters is that it granted relief beyond the existing\norder, and that Buono must have had standing to seek the\nextension.\n   It also makes no difference that the District Court said\nit was merely enforcing its original injunction. The ques\ntion is whether in fact the new order goes beyond the old\none. If so, the court must satisfy itself of jurisdiction to\naward the additional relief—which includes making cer\ntain the plaintiff has standing. See Steel Co., 523 U. S., at\n94. That is true whether the court revisits the injunction\nat a party’s request or on its own initiative; Article III’s\ncase-or-controversy requirement is not merely a prerequi\nsite to relief, but a restraint on judicial power. See Sum\nmers, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 4).6\n——————\n  6 I agree with JUSTICE BREYER that in interpreting an ambiguous\n\ninjunction we should give great weight to the interpretation of the\njudge who issued it.

L. 107–117, §8137(a), 115 Stat. 2278. Later that\nyear, in a judgment not open to question, the District\nCourt determined that the display of that cross violated\nthe Establishment Clause because it “convey[ed] a mes­\nsage of endorsement of religion.” Buono v.

BUONO\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nare known to differ. In my view, the District Court was\nright to enforce its prior judgment by enjoining Congress’\nproposed remedy—a remedy that was engineered to leave\nthe cross intact and that did not alter its basic meaning. I\ncertainly agree that the Nation should memorialize the\nservice of those who fought and died in World War I, but it\ncannot lawfully do so by continued endorsement of a\nstarkly sectarian message.\n                               I\n   As the history recounted by the plurality indicates, this\ncase comes to us in a procedural posture that significantly\nnarrows the question presented to the Court. In the first\nstage of this litigation, the District Court and the Court of\nAppeals ruled that the Government violated the Estab­\nlishment Clause by permitting the display of a single\nwhite Latin cross at Sunrise Rock. Those courts further\nruled that the appropriate remedy was an injunction\nprohibiting the Government from “permitting the display\nof the Latin cross in the area of Sunrise Rock in the Mo­\njave National Preserve.” App. 39. The Government de­\nclined to seek a writ of certiorari following those rulings.\nAccordingly, for the purpose of this case, it is settled that\n“the Sunrise Rock cross will project a message of govern­\nment endorsement [of religion] to a reasonable observer,”\nBuono v. Norton, 371 F. 3d 543, 549 (CA9 2004) (Buono\nII), and that the District Court’s remedy for that endorse­\nment was proper.\n   We are, however, faced with an additional fact: Con­\ngress has enacted a statute directing the Secretary of the\nInterior to transfer a 1-acre parcel of land containing the\ncross to the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), subject to\ncertain conditions, in exchange for a 5-acre parcel of land\nelsewhere in the Preserve. See Department of Defense\nAppropriations Act, 2004, Pub. L. 108–87, §8121, 117 Stat.\n1100. The District Court found that the land transfer\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

The District Court therefore enforced its 2002 judg­\nment by enjoining the transfer, without considering\nwhether “the land transfer itself is an independent viola­\ntion of the Establishment Clause.” Ibid., n. 8. Because\nthe District Court did not base its decision upon an inde­\npendent Establishment Clause violation, the constitution­\nality of the land-transfer statute is not before us. See\nante, at 10. Instead, the question we confront is whether\nthe District Court properly enforced its 2002 judgment by\nenjoining the transfer.\n   In answering that question we, like the District Court,\nmust first consider whether the transfer would violate the\n2002 injunction. We must then consider whether changed\ncircumstances nonetheless rendered enforcement of that\njudgment inappropriate; or conversely whether they made\nit necessary for the District Court to bar the transfer, even\nif the transfer is not expressly prohibited by the prior\ninjunction, in order to achieve the intended objective of the\ninjunction.

This case does\nnot simply pit a plaintiff’s “prior showing of illegality”\nagainst a defendant’s claim that “changed circumstances\nhave rendered prospective relief inappropriate.” Ante, at\n14. That formulation implies that the changed circum­\nstances all cut in one direction, against prospective relief,\nand that the defendant has asked the court to alleviate its\nobligations. But it is important to note that in this case,\nthe Government did not move to “alleviate or eliminate\nconditions or restrictions imposed by the original decree”\nso as to permit the transfer. Wright & Miller §2961, at\n397. Rather, it was the beneficiary of the original injunc­\ntion who went back into court seeking its enforcement or\nmodification in light of the transfer. Plainly, respondent\nhad standing to seek enforcement of a decree in his favor.2\n——————\neffect of the legislative action in this case is different from its effect in\nour cases espousing that principle, which stand for the proposition that\nif a statutory “right has been modified by the competent authority”\nsince the decree, then an injunction enforcing the prior version of that\nright must be modified to conform to the change in the law.

In a\nconstitutional case such as this, legislative action may modify the facts,\nbut it cannot change the applicable law.\n   2 To the extent the Government challenges respondent’s standing to\n\nseek the initial injunction, that issue is not before the Court for the\nreasons the plurality states. See ante, at 7. Moreover, in my view\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

Only at that point did the Government argue\nthat changed circumstances made prospective relief un­\nnecessary. This difference in focus is a subtle one, but it is\nimportant to emphasize that the question that was before\nthe District Court—and that is now before us—is whether\nenjoining the transfer was necessary to effectuate the\nletter or logic of the 2002 judgment.\n   Although I agree with the plurality’s basic framework, I\ndisagree with its decision to remand the case to the Dis­\ntrict Court. The District Court already “engage[d] in the\nappropriate inquiry,” ante, at 10, and it was well within its\nrights to enforce the 2002 judgment. First, the District\n——————\nrespondent has standing even under the analysis that JUSTICE SCALIA\nundertakes. It is not at all “speculative,” ante, at 4 (opinion concurring\nin judgment), that the VFW will continue to display the cross. VFW\nPost 385, the beneficiary of the land transfer, has filed an amici brief in\nthis case indicating it “intends to maintain and preserve the Veterans\nMemorial,” Brief for Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States\net al. as Amici Curiae 4, by which it means the cross, id., at 7 (identify­\ning the Veterans Memorial as the “cross and plaque”). Respondent did,\nin his amended complaint, aver that he was offended specifically “by\nthe display of a Latin Cross on government-owned property.” App. 50.\nBut his claimed injury is that he is “unable to freely use the area of the\nPreserve around the cross,” Buono v. Norton, 371 F. 3d 543, 547 (CA9\n2004) (Buono II) (internal quotation marks omitted), because the\nGovernment’s unconstitutional endorsement of the cross will induce\nhim to avoid the Sunrise Rock area, even though it offers the most\nconvenient route to the Preserve, App. 65. That endorsement and\nrespondent’s resulting injury not only persist, but have been aggra­\nvated by the Government’s actions since the complaint was filed.\n6                    SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nCourt properly recognized that the transfer was a means\nof “permitting”—indeed, encouraging—the display of the\ncross. The transfer therefore would violate the terms of\nthe court’s original injunction. Second, even if the transfer\nwould not violate the terms of the 2002 injunction, the\nDistrict Court properly took into account events that\ntranspired since 2002 and determined that barring the\ntransfer was necessary to achieve the intended result of\nthe 2002 decree, as the transfer would not eliminate gov­\nernment endorsement of religion.\n                              II\n   The first step in the analysis is straightforward: The\nDistrict Court had to ask whether the transfer of the\nproperty would violate the extant injunction. Under the\nterms of that injunction, the answer was yes.\n   The 2002 injunction barred the Government from “per­\nmitting the display of the Latin cross in the area of Sun­\nrise Rock in the Mojave National Preserve.” App. 39. The\nland-transfer statute mandated transfer of the land to an\norganization that has announced its intention to maintain\nthe cross on Sunrise Rock. That action surely “permit[s]”\nthe display of the cross. See 11 Oxford English Dictionary\n578 (2d ed. 1989) (defining “permit” as “[t]o admit or allow\nthe doing or occurrence of; to give leave or opportunity\nfor”). True, the Government would no longer exert direct\ncontrol over the cross. But the transfer itself would be an\nact permitting its display.\n   I therefore disagree with JUSTICE SCALIA that the “only\nreasonable reading of the original injunction . . . is that it\nproscribed the cross’s display on federal land.” Ante, at 2\n(opinion concurring in judgment). If the land were already\nprivately owned, JUSTICE SCALIA may be correct that the\ncross’ display on Sunrise Rock would not violate the in­\njunction because the Government would not have to do\nanything to allow the cross to stand, and the Government\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ncould try to prevent its display only by making such a\ndisplay illegal. But the Government does own this land,\nand the transfer statute requires the Executive Branch to\ntake an affirmative act (transfer to private ownership)\ndesigned to keep the cross in place. In evaluating a claim\nthat the Government would impermissibly “permit” the\ncross’ display by effecting a transfer, a court cannot\nstart from a baseline in which the cross has already been\ntransferred.\n   Moreover, §8121 was designed specifically to foster the\ndisplay of the cross. Regardless of why the Government\nwanted to “accommodat[e]” the interests associated with\nits display, ante, at 13 (plurality opinion), it was not only\nforeseeable but also intended that the cross would remain\nstanding. Indeed, so far as the record indicates, the Gov­\nernment had no other purpose for turning over this land to\nprivate hands. It was therefore proper for the District\nCourt to find that the transfer would violate its 2002\ninjunction and to enforce that injunction against the\ntransfer.\n                             III\n   As already noted, it was respondent, the beneficiary of\nthe injunction, who moved the District Court for relief.\nWhen the beneficiary of an injunction seeks relief “to\nachieve the purposes of the provisions of the decree,”\nUnited Shoe Machinery Corp., 391 U. S., at 249, a district\ncourt has the authority to “modify the decree so as to\nachieve the required result with all appropriate expedi­\ntion,” id., at 252. Thus, regardless of whether the transfer\nwas prohibited by the plain terms of the 2002 judgment,\nthe District Court properly inquired into whether enjoin­\ning the transfer was necessary to achieve the objective of\nthat judgment. The Government faces a high burden in\narguing the District Court exceeded its authority. A de­\ncree “may not be changed in the interests of the defen­\n8                    SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ndants if the purposes of the litigation . . . have not been\nfully achieved.” Id., at 248 (emphasis deleted). And con­\ntrary to the Government’s position, the changed circum­\nstances in this case support, rather than count against,\nthe District Court’s enforcement decision.\n  The objective of the 2002 judgment, as the plurality\ngrudgingly allows, was to “avoi[d] the perception of gov­\nernmental endorsement” of religion. Ante, at 16; see\nBuono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1178 (analyzing “ ‘whether\ngovernment action endorsing religion has actually ceased’ ”\nin light of the transfer). The parties do not disagree on\nthis point; rather, they dispute whether the transfer would\nend government endorsement of the cross. Compare Brief\nfor Petitioners 21 (“Congress’s transfer of the land . . .\nends any governmental endorsement of the cross”) with\nBrief for Respondent 34 (“[T]he government’s endorsement\nof the Christian cross is not remedied” by the land trans­\nfer). The District Court rightly found that the transfer\nwould not end government endorsement of the cross.\n  A government practice violates the Establishment\nClause if it “either has the purpose or effect of ‘endorsing’\nreligion.” County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties\nUnion, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 592\n(1989). “Whether the key word is ‘endorsement,’ ‘favorit­\nism,’ or ‘promotion,’ the essential principle remains the\nsame. The Establishment Clause, at the very least, pro­\nhibits government from appearing to take a position on\nquestions of religious belief or from ‘making adherence to\na religion relevant in any way to a person’s standing\nin the political community.’ ” Id., at 593–594 (quoting\nLynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 687 (1984) (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring)).\n  The 2002 injunction was based on a finding that display\nof the cross had the effect of endorsing religion. That is,\n“the Sunrise Rock cross . . . project[s] a message of gov­\nernment endorsement [of religion] to a reasonable ob­\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nserver.” Buono II, 371 F. 3d, at 549. The determination\nthat the Government had endorsed religion necessarily\nrested on two premises: first, that the Government en­\ndorsed the cross, and second, that the cross “take[s] a\nposition on questions of religious belief” or “ ‘mak[es] ad­\nherence to religion relevant . . . to a person’s standing in\nthe political community,’ ” County of Allegheny, 492 U. S.,\nat 594. Taking the District Court’s 2002 finding of an\nEstablishment Clause violation as res judicata, as we\nmust, the land transfer has the potential to dislodge only\nthe first of those premises, in that the transfer might\nchange the Government’s endorsing relationship with the\ncross. As I explain below, I disagree that the transfer\nordered by §8121 would in fact have this result. But it is\nalso worth noting at the outset that the transfer statute\ncould not (and does not) dislodge the second premise—that\nthe cross conveys a religious message. Continuing gov­\nernment endorsement of the cross is thus continuing\ngovernment endorsement of religion.\n   In my view, the transfer ordered by §8121 would not end\ngovernment endorsement of the cross for two independ­\nently sufficient reasons. First, after the transfer it would\ncontinue to appear to any reasonable observer that the\nGovernment has endorsed the cross, notwithstanding that\nthe name has changed on the title to a small patch of\nunderlying land. This is particularly true because the\nGovernment has designated the cross as a national memo­\nrial, and that endorsement continues regardless of\nwhether the cross sits on public or private land. Second,\nthe transfer continues the existing government endorse­\nment of the cross because the purpose of the transfer is to\npreserve its display. Congress’ intent to preserve the\ndisplay of the cross maintains the Government’s endorse­\nment of the cross.\n   The plurality does not conclude to the contrary; that is,\nit does not decide that the transfer would end government\n10                      SALAZAR v.

Rather, the plurality concludes that the District\nCourt did not conduct an appropriate analysis, and it\nremands the case for a do-over. I take up each of the\npurported faults the plurality finds in the District Court’s\nanalysis in my examination of the reasons why the trans­\nfer does not cure the existing Establishment Clause\nviolation.\nPerception of the Cross Post-Transfer\n  The 2002 injunction was based upon a finding of im­\npermissible effect: The “Sunrise Rock cross . . . project[s] a\nmessage of government endorsement [of religion] to a\nreasonable observer.” Buono II, 371 F. 3d, at 549. The\ntransfer would not end that impermissible state of affairs\nbecause the cross, post-transfer, would still have “the\neffect of communicating a message of government en­\ndorsement . . . of religion.” Lynch, 465 U. S., at 692\n(O’Connor, J., concurring). As the Court of Appeals cor­\nrectly found, “[n]othing in the present posture of the case\nalters” the conclusion that a “reasonable observer would\nperceive governmental endorsement of the message” the\ncross conveys. Buono v. Kempthorne, 527 F. 3d 758, 783\n(CA9 2008) (Buono IV).3\n——————\n  3 The  plurality faults the District Court for not engaging in this\nanalysis, but the District Court did implicitly consider how a reason­\nable observer would perceive the cross post-transfer when it analyzed\nthe terms of the transfer, the Government’s continuing property rights\nin the conveyed land, and the history of the Government’s efforts to\npreserve the cross. Furthermore, the Court of Appeals affirmed the\nDistrict Court’s order on the express ground that a reasonable observer\nwould still perceive government endorsement of the cross. See Buono\nIV, 527 F. 3d, at 782–783.\n  THE CHIEF JUSTICE suggests this is much ado about nothing because\nrespondent’s counsel conceded that the injunction would not be violated\nwere the Government to have gone through an “empty ritual” of taking\ndown the cross before transferring the land. Ante, at 1 (concurring\nopinion). But in the colloquy to which THE CHIEF JUSTICE refers,\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

Buddhist faith.” Buono II,\n371 F. 3d, at 550. After the transfer, a well-informed\nobserver would know that the cross was no longer on\npublic land, but would additionally be aware of the follow­\ning facts: The cross was once on public land, the Govern­\nment was enjoined from permitting its display, Congress\ntransferred it to a specific purchaser in order to preserve\nits display in the same location, and the Government\nmaintained a reversionary interest in the land. From this\nchain of events, in addition to the factors that remain the\nsame after the transfer, he would perceive government\nendorsement of the cross.4\n——————\ncounsel assumed that the Government would not retain a reversionary\ninterest in the land, and that the cross would not retain its designation\nas a national memorial. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 44–45. Even under THE\nCHIEF JUSTICE’s revised version of the hypothetical, I would not so\nquickly decide that taking down the cross makes no material difference.\nAnd counsel’s statement takes no position as to whether the hypotheti­\ncal poses any constitutional problem independent of the injunction.\nRegardless, we must deal with the substance of the case before us,\nwhich involves much more than Congress directing the Government to\nexecute a simple land transfer.\n  4 A less informed reasonable observer, see Capitol Square Review and\n\nAdvisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 807 (1995) (STEVENS, J., dissent­\ning), would reach the same conclusion because the cross would still\nappear to stand on Government property. The transfer merely “carv[es]\nout a tiny parcel of property in the midst of this vast Preserve—like a\ndonut hole with the cross atop it.” Buono v. Kempthorne, 527 F. 3d\n758, 783 (CA9 2008). For any reasonable observer, then, the transfer\nsimply would not change the effect of the cross.\n12                   SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   Particularly important to this analysis is that although\nthe transfer might remove the implicit endorsement that\npresence on public land signifies, see Capitol Square\nReview and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 801\n(1995) (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (“The very fact that a sign\nis installed on public property implies official recognition\nand reinforcement of its message”), it would not change\nthe fact that the Government has taken several explicit\nactions to endorse this cross. In its decision upholding the\ninitial entry of the injunction, the Court of Appeals found\nthose actions contributed to a reasonable observer’s per­\nception of government endorsement. Buono II, 371 F. 3d,\nat 550. Their significance does not depend upon the own­\nership of the land.\n   In 2000, and again after the District Court had entered\nits initial injunction, Congress passed legislation prohibit­\ning the use of any federal funds to remove the cross from\nits location on federal property. See Consolidated Appro­\npriations Act, 2001, Pub. L. 106–554, App. D, §133, 114\nStat. 2763A–230; Department of Defense Appropriations\nAct, 2003, Pub. L. 107–248, §8065(b), 116 Stat. 1551.\nThus, beyond merely acquiescing in the continued pres­\nence of a cross on federal property, Congress singled out\nthat cross for special treatment, and it affirmatively com­\nmanded that the cross must remain.\n   Congress also made a more dramatic intervention.\nWithout the benefit of any committee hearings or floor\ndebate in either the Senate or the House of Representa­\ntives—indeed, without a moment of discussion in any\nofficial forum—Congress passed legislation officially des­\nignating the “five-foot-tall white cross” in the Mojave\nDesert “as a national memorial commemorating United\nStates participation in World War I and honoring the\nAmerican veterans of that war.” §8137(a), 115 Stat. 2278.\nThereafter, the cross was no longer just a local artifact; it\nacquired a formal national status of the highest order.\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

The\nGovernment has expressly adopted the cross as its own.5\n   Even though Congress recognized this cross for its\nmilitary associations, the solitary cross conveys an ines­\ncapably sectarian message. See Separation of Church and\nState Comm. v. Eugene, 93 F. 3d 617, 626 (CA9 1996)\n(O’Scannlain, J., concurring in result) (“[T]he City’s use of\na cross to memorialize the war dead may lead observers to\nbelieve that the City has chosen to honor only Christian\nveterans”). As the District Court observed, it is undis­\nputed that the “[L]atin cross is the preeminent symbol of\nChristianity. It is exclusively a Christian symbol, and not\na symbol of any other religion.” Buono I, 212 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 1205. We have recognized the significance of the Latin\ncross as a sectarian symbol,6 and no participant in this\n——————\n   5 The plurality barely mentions this designation, except to assert that\n\nthe designation gave recognition to the historical meaning of the cross.\nSee ante, at 12. But the plurality does not acknowledge that when the\nNinth Circuit affirmed the 2002 judgment, it concluded that the desig­\nnation is one of the factors that would lead a reasonable observer to\nperceive government endorsement of religion. See Buono II, 371 F. 3d,\nat 550. Nor does the plurality address the effect of that designation on\na reasonable observer’s perception of the cross, regardless of whether\nthe cross sits on private land. See ante, at 16.\n   6 See, e.g., Pinette, 515 U. S., at 760 (characterizing Ku Klux Klan­\n\nsponsored cross as religious speech); id., at 776 (O’Connor, J., concur­\nring in part and concurring in judgment) (“[T]he cross is an especially\npotent sectarian symbol”); id., at 792 (Souter, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment) (“[T]he Latin cross . . . is the principal symbol\nof Christianity around the world, and display of the cross alone could\nnot reasonably be taken to have any secular point”); id., at 798, n. 3\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting) (“[T]he Latin cross is identifiable as a symbol\nof a particular religion, that of Christianity; and, further, as a symbol of\nparticular denominations within Christianity”); County of Allegheny v.\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.

It makes the war memo­\nrial sectarian.7\n   More fundamentally, however, the message conveyed by\nthe cross is not open to reconsideration given the posture\nof this case. The plurality employs a revealing turn of\nphrase when it characterizes the cross as “a symbol that,\nwhile challenged under the Establishment Clause, has\ncomplex meaning beyond the expression of religious\nviews.” Ante, at 13. The days of considering the cross\nitself as challenged under the Establishment Clause are\nover; it is settled that the Government is not permitted to\nendorse the cross. However complex the meaning of the\ncross, the Court of Appeals in 2004 considered and re­\njected the argument that its dual symbolism as a war\nmemorial meant that government endorsement of the\ncross did not amount to endorsement of religion. See\nBuono II, 371 F. 3d, at 549, n. 5. All we are debating at\n——————\npermit the permanent erection of a large Latin cross on the roof of city\nhall . . . because such an obtrusive year-round religious display would\nplace the government’s weight behind an obvious effort to proselytize\non behalf of a particular religion”).\n   7 Context is critical to the Establishment Clause inquiry, and not\n\nevery use of a religious symbol in a war memorial would indicate\ngovernment endorsement of a religious message. See, e.g., Van Orden\nv. Perry, 545 U. S. 677, 701 (2005) (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment)\n(“[T]o determine the message that the text here conveys, we must\nexamine how the text is used.

S. 668, 694 (1984) (O’Connor, J., concurring) (“Every\ngovernment practice must be judged in its unique circumstances to\ndetermine whether it constitutes an endorsement or disapproval of\nreligion”). But this cross is not merely one part of a more elaborate\nmonument that, taken as a whole, may be understood to convey a\nprimarily nonreligious message. Rather, the cross is the only symbol\nconveying any message at all.\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    15\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthis juncture is whether the shift from public to private\nownership of the land sufficiently distanced the Govern­\nment from the cross; we are no longer debating the mes­\nsage the cross conveys to a reasonable observer. In argu­\ning that Congress can legitimately favor the cross because\nof its purported double meaning, the plurality implicitly\ntries to reopen what is closed.8\n   The plurality also poses a different objection to consid­\neration of whether the transfer would change a reasonable\nobserver’s perception of the cross. The plurality suggests\nthat the “ ‘reasonable observer’ standard” may not “be the\nappropriate framework” because “courts considering Es­\ntablishment Clause challenges do not,” as a general mat­\nter, “inquire into ‘reasonable observer’ perceptions with\nrespect to objects on private land.” Ante, at 16. Once\nagain, the plurality’s approach fails to pay heed to the\nposture of this case.\n   At the risk of stating the obvious, respondent is not\nsimply challenging a private object on private land. Al­\nthough “an Establishment Clause violation must be\nmoored in government action of some sort,” Pinette, 515\nU. S., at 779 (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concur­\n——————\n   8 The plurality’s assertions regarding the meaning of the cross are\n\ntherefore beside the point. For the record, however, I cannot agree that\na bare cross such as this conveys a nonsectarian meaning simply\nbecause crosses are often used to commemorate “heroic acts, noble\ncontributions, and patient striving” and to honor fallen soldiers. Ante,\nat 17. The cross is not a universal symbol of sacrifice. It is the symbol\nof one particular sacrifice, and that sacrifice carries deeply significant\nmeaning for those who adhere to the Christian faith. The cross has\nsometimes been used, it is true, to represent the sacrifice of an individ­\nual, as when it marks the grave of a fallen soldier or recognizes a state\ntrooper who perished in the line of duty. Even then, the cross carries a\nreligious meaning. But the use of the cross in such circumstances is\nlinked to, and shows respects for, the individual honoree’s faith and\nbeliefs. I, too, would consider it tragic if the Nation’s fallen veterans\nwere to be forgotten. See ibid. But there are countless different ways,\nconsistent with the Constitution, that such an outcome may be averted.\n16                   SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nring in judgment), respondent’s objection to the transfer\neasily meets that test for two reasons. First, he is cur­\nrently challenging official legislation, taken in response to\nan identified Establishment Clause violation. That legis­\nlation would transfer public land to a particular private\nparty, with the proviso that the transferee must use the\nland to fulfill a specific public function or else the land\nreverts back to the Government. Second, even once the\ntransfer is complete, the cross would remain a national\nmemorial. The cross is therefore not a purely “private”\nobject in any meaningful sense.\n   Notwithstanding these facts, the plurality appears to\nconclude that the transfer might render the cross purely\nprivate speech. It relies in part on the plurality opinion in\nPinette for its suggestion that the reasonable observer\nstandard may not be apposite, and Pinette addressed a\nprivately owned cross displayed in a public forum. The\nPinette plurality would have rejected the idea that “a\nneutrally behaving government” can ever endorse “private\nreligious expression,” id., at 764, even if a reasonable\nobserver would perceive government endorsement, id., at\n768. But the Pinette plurality acknowledged that govern­\nment favoritism of private religious speech is unconstitu­\ntional, as when a government “giv[es] sectarian religious\nspeech preferential access to a forum close to the seat of\ngovernment (or anywhere else for that matter).” Id., at\n766. And in this case, the Government is not acting neu­\ntrally: The transfer statute and the government actions\npreceding it have all favored the cross.\n   Furthermore, even assuming (wrongly) that the cross\nwould be purely private speech after the transfer, and\neven assuming (quite implausibly) that the transfer stat­\nute is neutral with respect to the cross, it would still be\nappropriate for the District Court to apply the reasonable\nobserver standard. The majority of the Pinette Court\nrejected the per se rule proposed by the plurality. Instead,\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          17\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthe relevant standard provides that the Establishment\nClause is violated whenever “the State’s own actions . . . ,\nand their relationship to the private speech at issue, actu\nally convey a message of endorsement.” Id., at 777\n(O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg­\nment). Moreover, the Establishment Clause “imposes\naffirmative obligations that may require a State, in some\nsituations, to take steps to avoid being perceived as sup­\nporting or endorsing a private religious message.” Ibid. It\nis particularly appropriate in this context—when the issue\nis whether the transfer cures an already identified Estab­\nlishment Clause violation—for the District Court to con­\nsider whether the Government, by complying with §8121,\nwould have taken sufficient steps to avoid being perceived\nas endorsing the cross.\n   As I explained at the outset of this section, the answer\nto that inquiry is surely no. The reasonable observer “who\nknows all of the pertinent facts and circumstances sur­\nrounding the symbol and its placement,” ante, at 17, would\nperceive that the Government has endorsed the cross: It\nprohibited the use of federal funds to take down the cross,\ndesignated the cross as a national memorial, and engaged\nin “herculean efforts to preserve the Latin cross” following\nthe District Court’s initial injunction, Buono III, 364\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1182. Those efforts include a transfer\nstatute designed to keep the cross in place. Changing the\nownership status of the underlying land in the manner\nrequired by §8121 would not change the fact that the cross\nconveys a message of government endorsement of religion.\nPurpose in Enacting the Transfer Statute\n  Even setting aside that the effect of the post-transfer\ncross would still be to convey a message of government\nendorsement of religion, the District Court was correct to\nconclude that §8121 would not cure the Establishment\nClause violation because the very purpose of the transfer\n18                   SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nwas to preserve the display of the cross. That evident\npurpose maintains government endorsement of the cross.\nThe plurality does not really contest that this was Con­\ngress’ purpose, ante, at 11, so I need not review the evi­\ndence in great detail. Suffice it to say that the record\nprovides ample support. The land-transfer statute author­\nizes a conveyance to the particular recipient that has\nexpressed an intent to preserve the cross. See Brief for\nVeterans of Foreign Wars of the United States et al. as\nAmici Curiae 4 (transfer recipient “intends to maintain\nand preserve the Veterans Memorial”); id., at 7 (identify­\ning Veterans Memorial as the “cross and plaque”). And it\nconveys the particular land that has already been desig­\nnated “as a national memorial” commemorating the veter­\nans of World War I, §8121(a), 117 Stat. 1100, subject to a\nreversionary clause requiring that a memorial “commemo­\nrating United States participation in World War I and\nhonoring the American veterans of that war” be main­\ntained, §8121(e). If it does not categorically require the\nnew owner of the property to display the existing memo­\nrial meeting that description (the cross), see §8137, 115\nStat. 2278, the statute most certainly encourages this\nresult. Indeed, the Government concedes that Congress\nsought to “preserve a longstanding war memorial” at the\nsite, Brief for Petitioners 28 (emphasis added), and the\nonly memorial that could be “preserved” at Sunrise Rock is\nthe cross itself.\n   The plurality insists, however, that even assuming the\npurpose of the land transfer was to preserve the display of\nthe cross, enjoining the transfer was not necessarily ap­\npropriate. It contends the District Court failed to give\nadequate consideration to “the context in which the [land­\ntransfer] statute was enacted and the reasons for its pas­\nsage,” ante, at 11, and it directs the District Court’s atten­\ntion to three factors: the message intended by the private\ncitizens who first erected the cross, ibid.; the time the\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

The\nDistrict Court, in its enforcement decision, had no occasion\nto consider anew either the private message intended by\nthose who erected the cross or how long the cross had\nstood atop Sunrise Rock. Neither of these factors consti­\ntuted a novel or changed circumstance since the entry of\nthe 2002 injunction. Whatever message those who ini­\ntially erected the cross intended—and I think we have to\npresume it was a Christian one, at least in part, for the\nsimple reason that those who erected the cross chose to\ncommemorate American veterans in an explicitly Chris­\ntian manner—that historical fact did not change between\n2002 and 2005. I grant that the amount of time the cross\nhad stood on Sunrise Rock did change, from 68 years to 71\nyears, but no one can seriously maintain that “the histori­\ncal meaning that the cross had attained,” ante, at 12, was\nmaterially transformed in that 3-year increment.9\n——————\n  9 I also disagree with the plurality’s factual premise that “the cross\n\nand the cause it commemorated had become entwined in the public\nconsciousness” in a secular manner, ante, at 11–12. Although some\nmembers of the community knew that the cross had been originally\nerected as a war memorial, there is no support in the record for the idea\nthat members of the public “gathered regularly at Sunrise Rock to pay\ntheir respects,” ibid., to the fallen of World War I or any other veterans.\nThe study conducted by a National Park Service historian indicates\nthat a group of veterans gathered at the cross as early as 1935 for\nEaster sunrise services.

The study further reveals\nthat a local club organized social events for the community at the cross\nfrom 1950 to 1975 and that after a local veteran passed away in 1984,\nthe “memory and associations of the white cross . . . as a war memorial”\n20                        SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   This brings us to the final factor identified by the plural­\nity: Congress’ “policy of accommodation” for the cross.10 Of\ncourse, the District Court did consider Congress’ “policy”\nin the sense that it considered the result Congress was\ntrying to achieve with respect to the cross, i.e., to keep it in\nplace. See Buono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1182 (“[T]he\nproposed transfer of the subject property can only be\nviewed as an attempt to keep the Latin cross atop Sunrise\nRock without actually curing the continuing Establish­\nment Clause violation”). But I understand the plurality to\nbe faulting the District Court for failing to inquire into a\ndeeper level of motivation: If the purpose of the transfer\nwas to keep the cross in place, what was the purpose of\nkeeping the cross in place?\n   I do not see why it was incumbent upon the District\nCourt to examine this second-order purpose when deter­\nmining whether the transfer violated the 2002 injunction.\nAs discussed in Part II, supra, the injunction barred the\nGovernment from permitting the display of the cross,\nwhich fairly encompasses any act providing an opportu­\nnity for the cross’ display. It was entirely appropriate for\nthe District Court to characterize a transfer with the\npurpose of preserving the cross as an attempt to evade\nthat injunction, and to find that the Government’s purpose\nto preserve the cross maintains government endorsement\nof the cross.\n——————\nfaded but locals were “inspired . . . to reinstate the Easter sunrise\nservices” at the cross. Ibid.\n  10 Although the plurality uses the term “accommodation,” I do not\n\nread its opinion to suggest that Congress’ policy vis-à-vis the cross has\nanything to do with accommodating any individual’s religious practice.\nCf. County of Allegheny, 492 U. S., at 601, n. 51 (“Nor can the display of\nthe crèche be justified as an ‘accommodation’ of religion. . . . To be sure,\nprohibiting the display . . . deprives Christians of the satisfaction of\nseeing the government adopt their religious message as their own, but\nthis kind of government affiliation with particular religious messages is\nprecisely what the Establishment Clause precludes”).\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

But we are instead examining whether\naction taken with the purpose of preserving the display of\nthe cross cures or continues government endorsement. In\nmy view, that purpose continues the impermissible en­\ndorsement of—indeed, favoritism toward—the cross,\nregardless of why Congress chose to intervene as it did.\n   In any event, Congress’ second-order purpose does little\nfor the plurality’s position. Without relying on any legisla­\ntive history or findings—there are none—the plurality\nopines that Congress wanted to keep the cross in place in\norder to accommodate those who might view removal as\n“conveying disrespect for those the cross was seen as\nhonoring,” ante, at 12, and it suggests that this decision\nwas an acceptable method of “balanc[ing] opposing inter­\nests” because the cross “has complex meaning beyond the\nexpression of religious views,” ante, at 13. As I have al­\nready explained, the meaning of the cross (complex or\notherwise) is no longer before us, and the plurality’s reli­\nance on a “congressional statement of policy,” ibid., as\nnegating any government endorsement of religion finds no\nsupport in logic or precedent. The cross cannot take on a\nnonsectarian character by congressional (or judicial) fiat,\nand the plurality’s evaluation of Congress’ actions is di­\nvorced from the methodology prescribed by our doctrine.11\n——————\n  11 JUSTICE ALITO similarly affords great weight to Congress’ purported\n\ninterest in “avoiding the disturbing symbolism associated with the\ndestruction of the historic monument.” Ante, at 5 (opinion concurring\nin part and concurring in judgment).

That remedy may sometimes require\nremoving a religious symbol, and regrettably some number of people\nmay perceive the remedy as evidence that the government “is bent on\neliminating from all public places and symbols any trace of our coun­\ntry’s religious heritage,” ante, at 4. But it does not follow that the\ngovernment can decline to cure an Establishment Clause violation in\norder to avoid offense. It may be the case that taking down the symbol\nis not the only remedy. The proper remedy, like the determination of\nthe violation itself, is necessarily context specific, and even if it involves\nmoving the cross, it need not involve the “demolition” or “destruction” of\nthe cross, see ante, at 4, 5. Regardless, in this case the only question\nbefore us is whether this particular transfer provided a complete\nremedy. We have no way of knowing whether Congress’ motivation\nwas to minimize offense, but in any event that interest does not amelio­\nrate the remedial ineffectiveness of §8121.\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

Moreover, the inference that Congress has exercised\nits institutional competence—or even its considered judg­\nment—is significantly weaker in a case such as this, when\nthe legislative action was “buried in a defense appropria­\ntions bill,” Buono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1181, and, so far\nas the record shows, undertaken without any deliberation\nwhatsoever. I am not dismissive of Congress, see ante, at\n7 (opinion of ALITO, J.), but §8121 presents no factual\nfindings, reasoning, or long history of “ ‘careful legislative\nadjustment,’ ” Citizens United, 558 U. S., at ___ (STEVENS,\nJ., dissenting) (slip op., at 71) (quoting FEC v. Beaumont,\n539 U. S. 146, 162, n. 9 (2003)), to which I could possibly\ndefer. Congress did not devote “years of careful study” to\n§8121, Citizens United, 558 U. S., at ___ (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting) (slip op., at 73), nor did it develop a record of\nany kind, much less an exhaustive one, see id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 20) (noting the legislative record for the Bipartisan\nCampaign Reform Act of 2002 spanned 100,000 pages).\nThe concurrence’s attempt to draw an equivalence be­\ntween a provision tucked silently into an appropriations\nbill and a major statute debated and developed over many\nyears is, to say the least, not persuasive. All legislative\nacts are not fungible.\n   Furthermore, in the Establishment Clause context, we\ndo not accord any special deference to the legislature on\naccount of its generic advantages as a policymaking body,\nand the purpose test is not “satisfied so long as any secu­\nlar purpose for the government action is apparent,”\nMcCreary County, 545 U. S., at 865, n. 13 (emphasis\nadded). Nor can the Government pursue a secular aim\nthrough religious means. See Van Orden, 545 U. S., at\n715 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (“Though the State of Texas\n24                       SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nmay genuinely wish to combat juvenile delinquency, and\nmay rightly want to honor the Eagles for their efforts, it\ncannot effectuate these admirable purposes through an\nexplicitly religious medium”). It is odd that the plurality\nignores all of these well-settled principles in exalting this\nparticular legislative determination.\n   A reasonable observer, considering the nature of this\nsymbol, the timing and the substance of Congress’ efforts,\nand the history of the Sunrise Rock site, could conclude\nthat Congress chose to preserve the cross primarily be­\ncause of its salience as a cross. Cf. McCreary County, 545\nU. S., at 873 (“If the observer had not thrown up his\nhands, he would probably suspect that the Counties were\nsimply reaching for any way to keep a religious document\non the walls . . .”). But no such conclusion is necessary to\nfind for respondent.12 The religious meaning of the cross\nwas settled by the 2002 judgment; the only question before\nus is whether the Government has sufficiently distanced\nitself from the cross to end government endorsement of it.\nAt the least, I stress again, a reasonable observer would\nconclude that the Government’s purpose in transferring\nthe underlying land did not sufficiently distance the Gov­\nernment from the cross. Indeed, §8121 evidenced concern\nfor whether the cross would be displayed. The District\nCourt was therefore correct to find that the transfer would\n——————\n  12 I have not “jump[ed] to the conclusion that Congress’ aim in enact­\n\ning the land transfer law was to embrace the religious message of the\ncross.” Ante, at 7 (opinion of ALITO, J.). I think a reasonable observer\ncould come to that conclusion, but my point is that so long as we agree\nthat Congress’ aim was to preserve the cross (which JUSTICE ALITO does\nnot dispute), Congress’ reason for preserving the cross does not matter.\nBut if we were debating whether Congress had a religious purpose in\npassing the transfer statute, I would contest the relevance of the vote\ncount to that inquiry, see ante, at 6, and particularly so in this case.\nOne cannot infer much of anything about the land-transfer provision\nfrom the fact that an appropriations bill passed by an overwhelming\nmajority.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          25\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nnot end government endorsement of religion.\n                             IV\n  In sum, I conclude that the transfer ordered by §8121\nwill not end the pre-existing government endorsement of\nthe cross, and to the contrary may accentuate the problem\nin some respects. Because the transfer would perpetuate\nthe Establishment Clause violation at issue in the 2002\ninjunction, I further conclude that enjoining the transfer\nwas necessary to secure relief. Given the transfer stat­\nute’s fundamental inadequacy as a remedy, there was—\nand is—no need for the District Court to consider “less\ndrastic relief than complete invalidation of the . . . stat­\nute.” Ante, at 18. Allowing the transfer to go forward\nwould interfere with the District Court’s authority to\nenforce its judgment and deprive the District Court of the\nability to ensure a complete remedy. Nor could allowing\nthe transfer to go forward be made a complete remedy\nwith add-on measures, such as signs or fences indicating\nthe ownership of the land. Such measures would not\ncompletely end the government endorsement of this cross,\nas the land would have been transferred in a manner\nfavoring the cross and the cross would remain designated\nas a national memorial. Enjoining compliance with §8121\nwas therefore a proper exercise of the District Court’s\nauthority to enforce the 2002 judgment.\n                        *     *    *\n   Congressional action, taken after due deliberation, that\nhonors our fallen soldiers merits our highest respect. As\nfar as I can tell, however, it is unprecedented in the Na­\ntion’s history to designate a bare, unadorned cross as the\nnational war memorial for a particular group of veterans.\nNeither the Korean War Memorial, the Vietnam War\nMemorial, nor the World War II Memorial commemorates\nour veterans’ sacrifice in sectarian or predominantly reli­\ngious ways. Each of these impressive structures pays\n26                  SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nequal respect to all members of the Armed Forces who\nperished in the service of our Country in those conflicts.\nIn this case, by contrast, a sectarian symbol is the memo­\nrial. And because Congress has established no other\nnational monument to the veterans of the Great War, this\nsolitary cross in the middle of the desert is the national\nWorld War I memorial. The sequence of legislative deci­\nsions made to designate and preserve a solitary Latin\ncross at an isolated location in the desert as a memorial\nfor those who fought and died in World War I not only\nfailed to cure the Establishment Clause violation but also,\nin my view, resulted in a dramatically inadequate and\ninappropriate tribute.\n  I believe that most judges would find it to be a clear\nEstablishment Clause violation if Congress had simply\ndirected that a solitary Latin cross be erected on the Mall\nin the Nation’s Capital to serve as a World War I Memo­\nrial. Congress did not erect this cross, but it commanded\nthat the cross remain in place, and it gave the cross the\nimprimatur of Government. Transferring the land pursu­\nant to §8121 would perpetuate rather than cure that\nunambiguous endorsement of a sectarian message.\n  The Mojave Desert is a remote location, far from the\nseat of our Government. But the Government’s interest in\nhonoring all those who have rendered heroic public service\nregardless of creed, as well as its constitutional responsi­\nbility to avoid endorsement of a particular religious view,\nshould control wherever national memorials speak on\nbehalf of our entire country.\n  I respectfully dissent.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

Ante, at 7; see also ante, at 1 (SCALIA,\nJ., concurring in judgment); Travelers, supra, at ___ (slip\nop., at 14) (orders are no less preclusive when the collat\neral attack is jurisdictional). And, as the plurality also\npoints out, the plaintiff consequently has standing now to\nseek enforcement of the injunction. Ante, at 8–9; see also\nAllen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 763 (1984).\n   Moreover, we are not faced with the question whether\nchanged circumstances require modification of the injunc\ntion. The Government did not ask the District Court to\nmodify it. In fact, the Government did not ask the District\nCourt for any relief at all. Rather, it was the plaintiff who\nasked the District Court either (1) to “ ‘hold that the [land]\ntransfer violates the current injunction,’ ” or (2) to “ ‘modify\nthat injunction to prohibit the land transfer because it\nviolates the Establishment Clause.’ ” 364 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1177 (quoting plaintiff’s motion). The District Court did\nthe former, i.e., it interpreted the injunction as prohibiting\nthe Government from transferring the land for purposes of\ndisplaying the cross. And having granted the plaintiff’s\nrequest to enforce the injunction, it dismissed the plain\ntiff’s alternative request to modify the injunction as moot.\n   Thus, as I said at the outset, the only question before us\nis whether the law permits the District Court to hold that\nthe land transfer (presumably along with the subsequent\npublic display of the cross) falls within the scope of its\noriginal injunctive order, an order that says the Govern\nment must not “permi[t] the display of the Latin cross in\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

In my view the law authorizes the Dis\ntrict Court to do so.\n   The legal principles that answer the question presented\nare found not in the Constitution but in cases that concern\nthe law of injunctions. First, the law of injunctions grants\na district court considerable leeway to interpret the mean\ning and application of its own injunctive order. Members\nof this Court have written that the “construction given to”\nan “injunction by the issuing judge . . . is entitled to great\nweight.” Madsen v. Women’s Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S.\n753, 795 (1994) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment in part\nand dissenting in part). And the Courts of Appeals have\nconsistently held that district courts have considerable\ndiscretion in interpreting and applying their own injunc\ntive decrees. See, e.g., JTH Tax, Inc. v. H & R Block East\nern Tax Servs., Inc., 359 F. 3d 699, 705 (CA4 2004); Ala\nbama Nursing Home Assn v. Harris, 617 F. 2d 385, 388\n(CA5 1980). This principle is longstanding and well estab\nlished, as reflected in a prominent treatise writer’s sum\nmary of the case law: “The court granting the injunction is\nnecessarily invested with large discretion in enforcing\nobedience to its mandate, and . . . courts of appellate\npowers are exceedingly averse to interfering with the\nexercise of such judgment and discretion.” 2 J. High, Law\nof Injunctions §1458, pp. 1467–1468 (4th ed. 1905).\n   Second, a court should construe the scope of an injunc\ntion in light of its purpose and history, in other words,\n“what the decree was really designed to accomplish.”\nMayor of Vicksburg v. Henson, 231 U. S. 259, 273 (1913).\nCourts have long looked to “the objects for which the\n[injunctive] relief was granted, as well as the circum\nstances attending it,” in deciding whether an enjoined\nparty has complied with an injunction. 2 High, supra,\n§1446, at 1455, and n. 68 (citing cases); see also John B.\nStetson Co. v. Stephen L. Stetson Co., 128 F. 2d 981, 983\n4                     SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(CA2 1942). And they have long refused to “permit defen\ndants to evade responsibility for violating an injunction,\nby doing through subterfuge a thing which is not in terms\na violation, yet produces the same effect by accomplishing\nsubstantially that which they were enjoined from doing.”\nStodder v. Rosen Talking Mach. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100167\"><a href=\"/opinion/100167/toledo-co-v-computing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 68, 141\nN. E. 569, 571 (1923).\n   These two principles adequately support the District\nCourt’s interpretation and application of the injunctive\nlanguage at issue here. As an initial matter, the plain text\nof the injunction is reasonably read to prohibit the trans\nfer. Right now, the cross is covered with a plywood box;\nafter the transfer, the box will be removed and the cross\nwill be displayed. The transfer thus “permits” the public\n“display” of the cross. Indeed, that is the statute’s\nobjective.\n   Consideration of the injunction’s purpose points in the\nsame direction. The injunction rested upon the District\nCourt’s determination that the display of the cross “con\nveys a message of endorsement of religion” to “a reason\nable observer” in violation of the Establishment Clause.\n212 F. Supp. 2d, at 1216–1217. (As I have said, for pre\nsent purposes we must assume that this is so.) The pur\npose of the injunction is to prevent the conveyance of such\na message to the reasonable observer.\n   With that purpose in mind, consider the following facts\nthat confronted the District Court when the plaintiff asked\nit to enforce the decree:\n\n    •\t The Government had designated the “white cross\n       . . . as well as a limited amount of adjoining [land]”\n       as a national memorial.

Pub. L. 108–87, §§8121(a) and\n      (b), 117 Stat. 1100.\n   •\t The transfer was made “subject to the condition\n      that the recipient maintain the conveyed property\n      as a memorial,” and the property reverts to the\n      United States if the Secretary determines that the\n      recipient has failed to do so. §8121(e), id., at 1100.\n   •\t After the transfer, the cross would sit on 1 acre of\n      privately owned land in a 1.6 million acre national\n      preserve, over 90% of which is federally owned.\n      212 F. Supp. 2d, at 1205.\n   •\t Congress had previously prevented the use of fed\n      eral funds to remove the cross from its present lo\n      cation. Pub. L. 107–248, §8065(b), 116 Stat. 1551;\n      Pub. L. 106–554, §133, 114 Stat. 2763A–230.\n\n  The District Court considered the facts before it through\nthe lens of the injunction’s original purpose. See 364\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1180 (explaining that the “[G]overnment’s\ncontinuing control over the Latin cross” and the involve\nment of private parties who “desir[e] its continued pres\nence in the Preserve,” “demonstrat[e]” that the transfer\nwould not end “the [G]overnment’s apparent endorsement\nof a particular religion”); id., at 1182 (considering the\nhistorical context of the transfer statute); see also Buono\nv. Kempthorne, 527 F. 3d 758, 783 (CA9 2008) (“carving\nout a tiny parcel of property in the midst of this vast Pre\nserve . . . will do nothing to minimize the impermissible\ngovernmental endorsement” perceived by the reasonable\nobserver). And it concluded that the land transfer would\nfrustrate that purpose. See 364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1182 (the\ntransfer would “keep the Latin cross atop Sunrise Rock\nwithout actually curing the continuing Establishment\n6                   SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nClause violation”); see also 527 F. 3d, at 783 (finding that\n“[n]othing in the present posture of the case alters . . .\nearlier conclusions” regarding what a reasonable observer\nwould perceive).      In my view, this is a reasonable\nconclusion.\n   The injunction forbids the Government to permit the\ndisplay of the cross on Sunrise Rock, and its basic purpose\nwas to prevent a reasonable observer from believing that\nthe Government had endorsed the cross. Under the cir\ncumstances presented to the District Court, the transfer\nwould have resulted in such a display and might well have\nconveyed such a message. Consequently, the District\nCourt’s decision that the land transfer violated the injunc\ntion as written and intended was not an abuse of discre\ntion. And that is what the Ninth Circuit properly held on\nappeal. What the Establishment Clause implications of\nthe changed circumstances may be is a matter not before\nus. Cf. Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U. S. 431, 442 (2004) (“If\nthe [enjoined defendant] establishes reason to modify the\ndecree, the court should make the necessary changes;\nwhere it has not done so, however, the decree should be\nenforced according to its terms”).\n   Because my conclusion rests primarily upon the law of\ninjunctions, because that law is fairly clear, and because\nwe cannot properly reach beyond that law to consider the\nunderlying Establishment Clause and standing questions,\nI can find no federal question of general significance in\nthis case. I believe we should not have granted the peti\ntion for certiorari. Having granted it, the Court should\nnow dismiss the writ as improvidently granted. Since the\nCourt has not done so, however, I believe that we should\nsimply affirm the Ninth Circuit’s judgment.\n   With respect, I dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 145221, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2010/04/28/Salazar_v._Buono.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2009                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued October 7, 2009—Decided April 28, 2010\nIn 1934, members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) placed a\n  Latin cross on federal land in the Mojave National Preserve (Pre\n  serve) to honor American soldiers who died in World War I. Claiming\n  to be offended by a religious symbol’s presence on federal land, re\n  spondent Buono, a regular visitor to the Preserve, filed this suit al\n  leging a violation of the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause\n  and seeking an injunction requiring the Government to remove the\n  cross. In the litigation’s first stage (Buono I), the District Court\n  found that Buono had standing to sue and, concluding that the pres\n  ence of the cross on federal land conveyed an impression of govern\n  mental endorsement of religion, see Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S.\n  602, 612–613, it granted Buono’s requested injunctive relief (2002 in\n  junction). The District Court did not consider whether the Govern\n  ment’s actions regarding the cross had a secular purpose or caused\n  entanglement with religion. While the Government’s appeal was\n  pending, Congress passed the Department of Defense Appropriations\n  Act, 2004, §8121(a) of which directed the Secretary of the Interior to\n  transfer the cross and the land on which it stands to the VFW in ex\n  change for privately owned land elsewhere in the Preserve (land\n  transfer statute). Affirming the District Court’s judgment both as to\n  standing and on the merits, the Ninth Circuit declined to address the\n  statute’s effect on Buono’s suit or the statute’s constitutionality\n  (Buono II). Because the Government did not seek review by this\n  Court, the Court of Appeals’ judgment became final. Buono then re\n  turned to the District Court seeking injunctive relief against the land\n  transfer, either through enforcement or modification of the 2002 in\n  junction. In 2005, that court rejected the Government’s claim that\n2                         SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    the transfer was a bona fide attempt to comply with the injunction,\n    concluding, instead, that it was actually an invalid attempt to keep\n    the cross on display. The court granted Buono’s motion to enforce the\n    2002 injunction; denied as moot his motion to amend it; and perma\n    nently enjoined the Government from implementing the land\n    transfer statute (Buono III). The Ninth Circuit again affirmed,\n    largely following the District Court’s reasoning.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n502 F. 3d 1069 and 527 F. 3d 758, reversed and remanded.\n     JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined in full by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and in part\n  by JUSTICE ALITO, concluded:\n     1. Buono has standing to maintain this action. Whatever the valid\n  ity of the Government’s argument that Buono’s asserted injury—\n  offense at a religious symbol’s presence on federal land—is not per\n  sonal to him and so does not confer Article III standing, that argu\n  ment is not available at this stage of the litigation. The District\n  Court rejected the argument in Buono I, the Ninth Circuit affirmed\n  in Buono II, and the Court of Appeals’ judgment became final and\n  unreviewable upon the expiration of the 90-day deadline for filing a\n  certiorari petition, 28 U. S. C. §2101(c). Moreover, Buono had stand\n  ing in Buono III to seek application of the injunction against the\n  land-transfer statute. A party that obtains a judgment in its favor\n  acquires a “judicially cognizable” interest in ensuring compliance\n  with that judgment. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737. Buono’s en\n  titlement to an injunction having been established in Buono I and II,\n  he sought in Buono III to prevent the Government from frustrating or\n  evading that injunction. His interests in doing so were sufficiently\n  personal and concrete to support his standing, given the rights he ob\n  tained under the earlier decree against the same party as to the same\n  cross and the same land. The Government’s contention that Buono\n  sought to extend, rather than to enforce, the 2002 injunction is not an\n  argument about standing, but about the merits of the District Court’s\n  order. Pp. 7–9.\n     2. The District Court erred in enjoining the Government from im\n  plementing the land-transfer statute on the premise that the relief\n  was necessary to protect Buono’s rights under the 2002 injunction.\n  Pp. 9–18.\n        (a) A court may order an injunction only after taking into account\n  all the circumstances bearing on the need for prospective relief. See,\n  e.g., United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U. S. 106, 114. Here, the Dis\n  trict Court did not engage in the appropriate inquiry. The land\n  transfer statute was a substantial change in circumstances bearing\n  on the propriety of the requested relief. By dismissing as illicit the\n  motives of Congress in passing it, the District Court took insufficient\n                   Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\naccount of the context in which the statute was enacted and the rea\nsons for its passage. Placement of the cross on federal land by pri\nvate persons was not an attempt to set the state’s imprimatur on a\nparticular creed. Rather, the intent was simply to honor fallen sol\ndiers. Moreover, the cross stood for nearly seven decades before the\nstatute was enacted, by which time the cross and the cause it com\nmemorated had become entwined in the public consciousness. The\n2002 injunction thus presented the Government with a dilemma. It\ncould not maintain the cross without violating the injunction, but it\ncould not remove the cross without conveying disrespect for those the\ncross was seen as honoring. Deeming neither alternative satisfac\ntory, Congress enacted the land-transfer statute. The statute embod\nied a legislative judgment that this dispute is best resolved through a\nframework and policy of accommodation. The statute should not\nhave been dismissed as an evasion, for it brought about a change of\nlaw and a congressional statement of policy applicable to the case.\nPp. 9–13.\n     (b) Where legislative action undermines the basis for previous re\nlief, the relevant question is whether an ongoing exercise of the\ncourt’s equitable authority is supported by the prior showing of ille\ngality, judged against the claim that changed circumstances render\nprospective relief inappropriate. The District Court granted the 2002\ninjunction based solely on its conclusion that the presence of the cross\non federal land conveyed an impression of governmental endorsement\nof religion, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed on the same grounds. Nei\nther court considered whether the Government had acted based on an\nimproper purpose. Given this sole reliance on perception, any further\nrelief grounded on the injunction should have rested on the same ba\nsis. But the District Court used an injunction granted for one reason\n(perceived governmental endorsement) as the basis for enjoining con\nduct that was alleged to be objectionable for a different reason (an il\nlicit governmental purpose). Ordering relief under such circum\nstances was improper. The court failed to consider whether the\nchange in law and circumstances effected by the land-transfer statute\nhad rendered the “reasonable observer” standard inappropriate to re\nsolve the dispute. Nor did the court attempt to reassess Buono I’s\nfindings in light of the accommodation policy embraced by Congress.\nRather, it concentrated solely on the religious aspects of the cross, di\nvorced from its background and context. Pp. 13–17.\n     (c) The same respect for a coordinate branch of Government that\nforbids striking down an Act of Congress except upon a clear showing\nof unconstitutionality, see, e.g., United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S.\n598, 607, requires that a congressional command be given effect\nunless no legal alternative exists. Even if, contrary to the congres\n4                          SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    sional judgment, the land transfer were thought an insufficient ac\n    commodation in light of the earlier endorsement finding, it was in\n    cumbent upon the District Court to consider less drastic relief than\n    complete invalidation of the statute. See, e.g., Ayotte v. Planned Par\n    enthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 329. On remand, that\n    court should conduct a proper inquiry into the continued necessity for\n    injunctive relief in light of the statute. Pp. 17–18.\n       JUSTICE ALITO concluded that this case should not be remanded for\n    the lower courts to decide whether implementation of the land\n    transfer statute would violate the District Court’s injunction or the\n    Establishment Clause. Rather, because the factual record has been\n    sufficiently developed to permit resolution of these questions, he\n    would decide them and hold that the statute may be implemented.\n    The case’s singular circumstances presented Congress with a delicate\n    problem. Its solution was an approach designed to eliminate any\n    perception of religious sponsorship stemming from the location of the\n    cross on federally owned land, while avoiding the disturbing symbol\n    ism that some would associate with the destruction of this historic\n    monument. The mechanism Congress selected is quite common in\n    the West, a “land exchange,” whereby ownership of the land on which\n    the cross is located would be transferred to the VFW in exchange for\n    another nearby parcel of equal value. The land transfer would not\n    violate the District Court injunction, the obvious meaning of which\n    was simply that the Government could not allow the cross to remain\n    on federal land. Nor would the statute’s implementation constitute\n    an endorsement of religion in violation of the Establishment Clause.\n    The so-called “endorsement test” views a challenged religious display\n    through the eyes of a hypothetical reasonable observer aware of the\n    history and all other pertinent facts relating to the display. Here,\n    therefore, this observer would be familiar with the monument’s origin\n    and history and thereby appreciate that the transfer represents an\n    effort by Congress to address a unique situation and to find a solution\n    that best accommodates conflicting concerns. Finally, the statute\n    was not enacted for the illicit purpose of embracing the monument’s\n    religious message but to commemorate the Nation’s war dead and to\n    avoid the disturbing symbolism that would have been created by the\n    monument’s destruction. Pp. 1–7.\n       JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by JUSTICE THOMAS, concluded that this\n    Court need not—indeed, cannot—decide this case’s merits because\n    Buono lacks Article III standing to pursue the relief he seeks, which\n    is not enforcement of the original injunction but expansion of it. By\n    enjoining the Government from implementing the statute at issue,\n    the District Court’s 2005 order went well beyond the original injunc\n    tion’s proscription of the cross’s display on public property. Because\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     5\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  Buono seeks new relief, he must show that he has standing to pursue\n  that relief by demonstrating that blocking the land transfer will “re\n  dress or prevent an actual or imminently threatened injury to [him]\n  caused by private or official violation of law.” Summers v. Earth Is\n  land Institute, 555 U. S. ___, ___. He has failed, however, to allege\n  any such injury. Even assuming that being offended by a religious\n  display constitutes a cognizable injury, it is merely speculative\n  whether the cross will remain in place, and in any event Buono has\n  made clear, by admitting he has no objection to Christian symbols on\n  private property, that he will not be offended. Neither district courts’\n  discretion to expand injunctions they have issued nor this District\n  Court’s characterization of its 2005 order as merely enforcing the ex\n  isting injunction makes any difference. If in fact a court awards new\n  relief, it must have Article III jurisdiction to do so.

FRANK BUONO \n\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [April 28, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY announced the judgment of the Court\nand delivered an opinion, in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE\njoins and JUSTICE ALITO joins in part.\n   In 1934, private citizens placed a Latin cross on a rock\noutcropping in a remote section of the Mojave Desert.\nTheir purpose and intent was to honor American soldiers\nwho fell in World War I. The original cross deteriorated\nover time, but a reconstructed one now stands at the same\nplace. It is on federal land.\n   The Court is asked to consider a challenge, not to the\nfirst placement of the cross or its continued presence on\nfederal land, but to a statute that would transfer the cross\nand the land on which it stands to a private party. De\npartment of Defense Appropriations Act, 2004, Pub. L.\n108–87, §8121(a), 117 Stat. 1100. The District Court\npermanently enjoined the Government from implementing\nthe statute. The Court of Appeals affirmed. We conclude\nthat its judgment was in error.\n                        I\n                        A\n  The Mojave National Preserve (Preserve) spans ap\n2                   SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                   Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nproximately 1.6 million acres in southeastern California.\nThe Preserve is nestled within the Mojave Desert, whose\npicturesque but rugged territory comprises 25,000 square\nmiles, exceeding in size the combined area of the Nation’s\nfive smallest States. See Merriam-Webster’s Geographical\nDictionary 755, 1228–1230 (3d ed. 1997). Just over 90\npercent of the land in the Preserve is federally owned,\nwith the rest owned either by the State of California or by\nprivate parties. The National Park Service, a division of\nthe Department of the Interior, administers the Preserve\nas part of the National Park System.            16 U. S. C.\n§§410aaa–41 and 410aaa–46.\n   Sunrise Rock is a granite outcropping located within the\nPreserve. Sunrise Rock and the area in its immediate\nvicinity are federal land, but two private ranches are\nlocated less than two miles away. The record does not\nindicate whether fencing is used to mark the boundary of\nthese ranches. In 1934, members of the Veterans of For\neign Wars (VFW) mounted a Latin cross on the rock as a\nmemorial to soldiers who died in World War I. A Latin\ncross consists of two bars—a vertical one and a shorter,\nhorizontal one. The cross has been replaced or repaired at\nvarious times over the years, most recently in 1998 by\nHenry Sandoz. Sandoz is a private citizen who owns land\nelsewhere in the Preserve, a portion of which he is pre\npared to transfer to the Government in return for its\nconveyance to the VFW of the land on which the cross\nstands, all pursuant to the statute now under review.\n   The cross, as built by Sandoz, consists of 4-inch diame\nter metal pipes painted white. The vertical bar is less\nthan eight feet tall. It cannot be seen from the nearest\nhighway, which lies more than 10 miles away. It is visi\nble, however, from Cima Road, a narrow stretch of black\ntop that comes within 100 feet of Sunrise Rock.\n   The cross has been a gathering place for Easter services\nsince it was first put in place; and Sunrise Rock and its\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nimmediate area continue to be used as a campsite. At one\ntime the cross was accompanied by wooden signs stating\n“ ‘The Cross, Erected in Memory of the Dead of All Wars,’\nand ‘Erected 1934 by Members of Veterans of Foregin [sic]\nWars, Death Valley post 2884.’ ” Buono v. Kempthorne,\n527 F. 3d 758, 769 (CA9 2008). The signs have since\ndisappeared, and the cross now stands unmarked.\n                            B\n   Frank Buono, respondent here, is a retired Park Service\nemployee who makes regular visits to the Preserve.\nBuono claims to be offended by the presence of a religious\nsymbol on federal land. He filed suit in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Central District of California. He\nalleged a violation of the Establishment Clause of the\nFirst Amendment and sought an injunction requiring the\nGovernment to remove the cross.\n   The litigation proceeded in what can be described as\nfour stages. In the first, the District Court ruled in\nBuono’s favor on opposing motions for summary judgment.\nBuono v. Norton, 212 F. Supp. 2d 1202 (CD Cal. 2002)\n(Buono I). As an initial matter, the court found that\nBuono had standing to maintain his Establishment Clause\nchallenge. Id., at 1210–1214. On the merits, the parties\nagreed that the dispute should be governed by the so\ncalled Lemon test, which the District Court formulated as\nfollows:\n    “A government religious practice or symbol will sur\n    vive an Establishment Clause challenge when it\n    (1) has a secular purpose, (2) has a primary effect that\n    neither advances nor inhibits religion, and (3) does\n    not foster excessive state entanglement with religion.”\n    Buono I, supra, at 1214–1215 (citing Lemon v. Kurtz\n    man, 403 U. S. 602, 612–613 (1971)).\nThe court expressly declined to consider whether the\n4                   SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nGovernment’s actions regarding the cross had a secular\npurpose, 212 F. Supp. 2d, at 1214–1215, or whether they\ncaused excessive entanglement with religion, id., at 1217,\nn. 9. Instead, the court evaluated the primary effect of the\ncross by asking how it would be viewed by a “reasonable\nobserver.” Id., at 1216. Concluding that presence of the\ncross on federal land conveyed an impression of govern\nmental endorsement of religion, the court granted Buono’s\nrequest for injunctive relief. The court’s order in Buono I\n(2002 injunction) permanently forbade the Government\n“from permitting the display of the Latin cross in the area\nof Sunrise Rock in the Mojave National Preserve.” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 146a.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir\ncuit stayed the 2002 injunction to the extent that it re\nquired the cross to be removed or dismantled but did not\nforbid alternative methods of complying with the order.\nThe Government covered the cross, first with a tarpaulin\nand later with a plywood box.\n   On appeal, the judgment of the District Court was af\nfirmed, both as to standing and on the merits of Buono’s\nEstablishment Clause challenge. Buono v. Norton, 371\nF. 3d 543 (CA9 2004) (Buono II). Like the District Court,\nthe Court of Appeals did not decide whether the Govern\nment’s action, or nonaction, with respect to the cross had\nbeen motivated by a secular purpose. Id., at 550. Its\nruling was based instead on the conclusion that a reason\nable observer would perceive a cross on federal land as\ngovernmental endorsement of religion. Id., at 549–550.\nThe Government did not seek review by this Court, so that\nthe judgment of the Court of Appeals in Buono II became\nfinal.\n                              C\n  During the relevant proceedings, Congress enacted\ncertain statutes related to the cross:\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n  (1) Before Buono I was filed, Congress passed an appro\npriations bill that included a provision forbidding the use\nof governmental funds to remove the cross. Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, 2001, Pub. L. 106–554, §133, 114 Stat.\n2763A–230.\n  (2) While Buono I was pending before the District Court,\nCongress designated the cross and its adjoining land “as a\nnational memorial commemorating United States partici\npation in World War I and honoring the American veter\nans of that war.” Department of Defense Appropriations\nAct, 2002, Pub. L. 107–117, §8137(a), 115 Stat. 2278. The\nSecretary of the Interior was directed to expend up to\n$10,000 to acquire a replica of the original cross and its\nmemorial plaque and to install the plaque at a suitable\nnearby location. §8137(c).\n  (3) Three months after Buono I was decided, Congress\nagain prohibited the spending of governmental funds to\nremove the cross. Department of Defense Appropriations\nAct, 2003, Pub. L. 107–248, §8065(b), 116 Stat. 1551.\n  (4) While the Government’s appeal in Buono II was\npending, Congress passed a statute (land-transfer statute)\ndirecting the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the\nVFW the Government’s interest in the land that had been\ndesignated a national memorial. Department of Defense\nAppropriations Act, 2004, Pub. L. 108–87, §8121(a), 117\nStat. 1100. In exchange, the Government was to receive\nland elsewhere in the preserve from Henry Sandoz and his\nwife. Ibid. Any difference in value between the two par\ncels would be equalized through a cash payment.\n§§8121(c), (d). The land-transfer statute provided that the\nproperty would revert to the Government if not main\ntained “as a memorial commemorating United States\nparticipation in World War I and honoring the American\nveterans of that war.” §8121(e), 117 Stat. 1100. The\nstatute presents a central issue in this case.\n  The Court of Appeals in Buono II did not address the\n6                   SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                   Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\neffect on the suit of a potential land transfer under the\nstatute. The court noted that the transfer might “take as\nlong as two years to complete,” 371 F. 3d, at 545, and that\nits effect was not yet known, id., at 545–546. The court\nthus “express[ed] no view as to whether a transfer com\npleted under [the statute] would pass constitutional mus\nter.” Id., at 546.\n                             D\n   After the Court of Appeals affirmed in Buono II, Buono\nreturned to the District Court seeking to prevent the land\ntransfer. He sought injunctive relief against the transfer,\neither through enforcement or modification of the 2002\ninjunction. In evaluating his request the trial court de\nscribed the relevant question as whether the land transfer\nwas a bona fide attempt to comply with the injunction (as\nthe Government claimed), or a sham aimed at keeping the\ncross in place (as Buono claimed). Buono v. Norton, 364\nF. Supp. 2d 1175, 1178 (CD Cal. 2005) (Buono III). In\nBuono III, the court did not consider whether the transfer\nitself was an “independent violation of the Establishment\nClause.” Id., at 1182, n. 8. The court nevertheless con\ncluded that the transfer was an attempt by the Govern\nment to keep the cross atop Sunrise Rock and so was\ninvalid. The court granted Buono’s motion to enforce the\n2002 injunction; denied as moot his motion to amend it;\nand permanently enjoined the Government from imple\nmenting the land-transfer statute. Id., at 1182.\n   The Court of Appeals again affirmed, largely following\nthe reasoning of the District Court. Buono v. Kempthorne,\n502 F. 3d 1069 (CA9 2007). The Government’s motion for\nrehearing en banc was denied over a dissent by Judge\nO’Scannlain, 527 F. 3d 758, and this Court granted certio\nrari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n                              II\n   Before considering the District Court’s order on the\nmerits, the first inquiry must be with respect to Buono’s\nstanding to maintain this action. To demonstrate stand\ning, a plaintiff must have “alleged such a personal stake in\nthe outcome of the controversy as to warrant his invoca\ntion of federal-court jurisdiction.” Horne v. Flores, 557\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The Government argues that Buono’s\nasserted injury is not personal to him and so does not\nconfer Article III standing. As noted above, Buono does\nnot find the cross itself objectionable but instead takes\noffense at the presence of a religious symbol on federal\nland. Buono does not claim that, as a personal matter, he\nhas been made to feel excluded or coerced, and so, the\nGovernment contends, he cannot object to the presence of\nthe cross. Brief for Petitioners 12–17.\n   Whatever the validity of the objection to Buono’s stand\ning, that argument is not available to the Government at\nthis stage of the litigation. When Buono moved the Dis\ntrict Court in Buono I for an injunction requiring the\nremoval of the cross, the Government raised the same\nstanding objections it proffers now. Rejecting the Gov\nernment’s position, the District Court entered a judgment\nin Buono’s favor, which the Court of Appeals affirmed in\nBuono II. The Government did not seek review in this\nCourt. The judgment became final and unreviewable upon\nthe expiration of the 90-day deadline under 28 U. S. C.\n§2101(c) for filing a petition for certiorari. Toledo Scale\nCo. v. Computing Scale Co., 261 U. S. 399, 418 (1923); see\nMissouri v. Jenkins, 495 U. S. 33, 45 (1990) (90-day dead\nline is “mandatory and jurisdictional”). The Government\ncannot now contest Buono’s standing to obtain the final\njudgment in Buono I.\n   Of course, even though the Court may not reconsider\nwhether Buono had standing to seek the 2002 injunction,\n8                    SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nit is still necessary to evaluate his standing in Buono III to\nseek application of the injunction against the land\ntransfer statute. That measure of relief is embodied in the\njudgment upon which we granted review.\n   This was a measure of relief that Buono had standing to\nseek. A party that obtains a judgment in its favor ac\nquires a “judicially cognizable” interest in ensuring com\npliance with that judgment. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S.\n737, 763 (1984) (plaintiffs’ right to enforce a desegregation\ndecree to which they were parties is “a personal interest,\ncreated by law, in having the State refrain from taking\nspecific actions”). Having obtained a final judgment\ngranting relief on his claims, Buono had standing to seek\nits vindication.\n   The Government does not deny this proposition as a\ngeneral matter. Instead, it argues that Buono was not\nseeking to vindicate—but rather to extend—the 2002\ninjunction. The first injunction forbade the Government\nfrom maintaining the cross on Sunrise Rock; yet in Buono\nIII he sought to preclude the land transfer, a different\ngovernmental action. The Government contends that\nBuono lacked standing to seek this additional relief.\nReply Brief for Petitioners 5.\n   The Government’s argument, however, is properly ad\ndressed to the relief granted by the judgment below, not to\nBuono’s standing to seek that relief. The Government has\nchallenged whether appropriate relief was granted in\nBuono III in light of the relevant considerations and legal\nprinciples, and we shall consider these questions. The\nstanding inquiry, by contrast, turns on the alleged injury\nthat prompted the plaintiff to invoke the court’s jurisdic\ntion in the first place. Buono’s entitlement to an injunc\ntion having been established in Buono I and II, he sought\nin Buono III to prevent the Government from frustrating\nor evading that injunction. Based on the rights he ob\ntained under the earlier decree—against the same party,\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nregarding the same cross and the same land—his interests\nin doing so were sufficiently personal and concrete to\nsupport his standing. Although Buono also argued that\nthe land transfer should be prohibited as an “independent”\nEstablishment Clause violation, the District Court did not\naddress or order relief on that claim, which is not before\nus. Buono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1182, n. 8. This is not a\ncase in which a party seeks to import a previous standing\ndetermination into a wholly different dispute.\n  In arguing that Buono sought to extend, rather than to\nenforce, the 2002 injunction, the Government in essence\ncontends that the injunction did not provide a basis for\nthe District Court to invalidate the land transfer. This is\nnot an argument about standing but about the merits of\nthe District Court’s order. Those points now must be\naddressed.\n                              III\n  The procedural history of this litigation must be consid\nered to identify the issues now subject to review. The\nDistrict Court granted the 2002 injunction after conclud\ning that a cross on federal land violated the Establishment\nClause. The Government unsuccessfully challenged that\nconclusion on appeal, and the judgment became final upon\ncompletion of direct review. At that point, the judgment\n“became res judicata to the parties and those in privity\nwith them, not only as to every matter which was offered\nand received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but\nas to any other admissible matter which might have been\noffered for that purpose.” Travelers Indemnity Co. v.\nBailey, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 14) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The Government therefore\ndoes not—and could not—ask this Court to reconsider the\npropriety of the 2002 injunction or the District Court’s\nreasons for granting it.\n  The question now before the Court is whether the Dis\n10                   SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\ntrict Court properly enjoined the Government from im\nplementing the land-transfer statute. The District Court\ndid not consider whether the statute, in isolation, would\nhave violated the Establishment Clause, and it did not\nforbid the land transfer as an independent constitutional\nviolation. Buono III, supra, at 1182, n. 8. Rather, the\ncourt enjoined compliance with the statute on the premise\nthat the relief was necessary to protect the rights Buono\nhad secured through the 2002 injunction.\n   An injunction is an exercise of a court’s equitable au\nthority, to be ordered only after taking into account all of\nthe circumstances that bear on the need for prospective\nrelief. See United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U. S. 106, 114\n(1932). See also Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S.\n305, 312 (1982); Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U. S. 321, 329\n(1944); 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal\nPractice and Procedure §2942, pp. 39–42 (2d ed. 1995)\n(hereinafter Wright & Miller). Equitable relief is not\ngranted as a matter of course, see Weinberger, 456 U. S.,\nat 311–312, and a court should be particularly cautious\nwhen contemplating relief that implicates public interests,\nsee id., at 312 (“In exercising their sound discretion, courts\nof equity should pay particular regard for the public con\nsequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of in\njunction”); Harrisonville v. W. S. Dickey Clay Mfg. Co., 289\nU. S. 334, 338 (1933) (“Where an important public interest\nwould be prejudiced, the reasons for denying the injunc\ntion may be compelling”). Because injunctive relief “is\ndrafted in light of what the court believes will be the\nfuture course of events, . . . a court must never ignore\nsignificant changes in the law or circumstances underlying\nan injunction lest the decree be turned into an ‘instrument\nof wrong.’ ” Wright & Miller §2961, at 393–394 (quoting\nSwift & Co., supra, at 115).\n   Here, the District Court did not engage in the appropri\nate inquiry. The land-transfer statute was a substantial\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nchange in circumstances bearing on the propriety of the\nrequested relief. The court, however, did not acknowledge\nthe statute’s significance. It examined the events that led\nto the statute’s enactment and found an intent to prevent\nremoval of the cross. Deeming this intent illegitimate, the\ncourt concluded that nothing of moment had changed.\nThis was error. Even assuming that the land-transfer\nstatute was an attempt to prevent removal of the cross, it\ndoes not follow that an injunction against its implementa\ntion was appropriate.\n   By dismissing Congress’s motives as illicit, the District\nCourt took insufficient account of the context in which the\nstatute was enacted and the reasons for its passage.\nPrivate citizens put the cross on Sunrise Rock to com\nmemorate American servicemen who had died in World\nWar I. Although certainly a Christian symbol, the cross\nwas not emplaced on Sunrise Rock to promote a Christian\nmessage. Cf. County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liber\nties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 661\n(1989) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part) (“[T]he [Establishment] Clause forbids\na city to permit the permanent erection of a large Latin\ncross on the roof of city hall . . . because such an obtrusive\nyear-round religious display would place the government’s\nweight behind an obvious effort to proselytize on behalf of\na particular religion”). Placement of the cross on Govern\nment-owned land was not an attempt to set the imprima\ntur of the state on a particular creed. Rather, those who\nerected the cross intended simply to honor our Nation’s\nfallen soldiers. See Brief for Veterans of Foreign Wars of\nthe United States et al. as Amici Curiae 15 (noting that\nthe plaque accompanying the cross “was decorated with\nVFW decals”).\n   Time also has played its role. The cross had stood on\nSunrise Rock for nearly seven decades before the statute\nwas enacted. By then, the cross and the cause it com\n12                  SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nmemorated had become entwined in the public conscious\nness. See ibid. Members of the public gathered regularly\nat Sunrise Rock to pay their respects. Rather than let the\ncross deteriorate, community members repeatedly took it\nupon themselves to replace it. Congress ultimately desig\nnated the cross as a national memorial, ranking it among\nthose monuments honoring the noble sacrifices that con\nstitute our national heritage. See note following 16\nU. S. C. §431 (listing officially designated national memo\nrials, including the National D-Day Memorial and the\nVietnam Veterans Memorial). Research discloses no other\nnational memorial honoring American soldiers—more\nthan 300,000 of them—who were killed or wounded in\nWorld War I. See generally A. Leland & M. Oboroceanu,\nCongressional Research Service Report for Congress,\nAmerican War and Military Operations Casualties: Lists\nand Statistics 2 (2009). It is reasonable to interpret the\ncongressional designation as giving recognition to the\nhistorical meaning that the cross had attained. Cf. Van\nOrden v. Perry, 545 U. S. 677, 702–703 (2005) (BREYER, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (“40 years” without legal chal\nlenge to a Ten Commandments display “suggest that the\npublic visiting the [surrounding] grounds has considered\nthe religious aspect of the tablets’ message as part of what\nis a broader moral and historical message reflective of a\ncultural heritage”).\n   The 2002 injunction thus presented the Government\nwith a dilemma. It could not maintain the cross without\nviolating the injunction, but it could not remove the cross\nwithout conveying disrespect for those the cross was seen\nas honoring. Cf. id., at 704 (to invalidate a longstanding\nTen Commandments display might “create the very kind\nof religiously based divisiveness that the Establishment\nClause seeks to avoid”). Deeming neither alternative to be\nsatisfactory, Congress enacted the statute here at issue.\nCongress, of course, may not use its legislative powers to\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

That principle, how\never, was not a bar to this statute. The Government’s\nright to transfer the land was not adjudicated in Buono I\nor compromised by the 2002 injunction.\n   In belittling the Government’s efforts as an attempt to\n“evade” the injunction, Buono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1182, the District Court had things backwards. Con\ngress’s prerogative to balance opposing interests and its\ninstitutional competence to do so provide one of the princi\npal reasons for deference to its policy determinations. See\nPatsy v. Board of Regents of Fla., 457 U. S. 496, 513\n(1982). Here, Congress adopted a policy with respect to\nland it now owns in order to resolve a specific controversy.\nCongress, the Executive, and the Judiciary all have a duty\nto support and defend the Constitution. See United States\nv. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 703 (1974) (“In the performance of\nassigned constitutional duties each branch of the Govern\nment must initially interpret the Constitution, and the\ninterpretation of its powers by any branch is due great\nrespect from the others”). The land-transfer statute em\nbodies Congress’s legislative judgment that this dispute is\nbest resolved through a framework and policy of accom\nmodation for a symbol that, while challenged under the\nEstablishment Clause, has complex meaning beyond the\nexpression of religious views. That judgment should not\nhave been dismissed as an evasion, for the statute brought\nabout a change of law and a congressional statement of\npolicy applicable to the case.\n   Buono maintains that any governmental interest in\nkeeping the cross up must cede to the constitutional con\ncerns on which the 2002 injunction was based. He argues\nthat the land transfer would be “an incomplete remedy” to\nthe constitutional violation underlying the injunction and\nthat the transfer would make achieving a proper remedy\nmore difficult. Brief for Respondent 54.\n14                  SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n   A court must find prospective relief that fits the remedy\nto the wrong or injury that has been established. See\nSwift & Co., 286 U. S., at 114 (“A continuing decree of\ninjunction directed to events to come is subject always to\nadaptation as events may shape the need”). See also\nUnited States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 391 U. S.\n244, 249 (1968). Where legislative action has undermined\nthe basis upon which relief has previously been granted, a\ncourt must consider whether the original finding of\nwrongdoing continues to justify the court’s intervention.\nSee Railway Employees v. Wright, 364 U. S. 642, 648–649\n(1961); Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co.,\n18 How. 421, 430–432 (1856). The relevant question is\nwhether an ongoing exercise of the court’s equitable au\nthority is supported by the prior showing of illegality,\njudged against the claim that changed circumstances have\nrendered prospective relief inappropriate.\n   The District Court granted the 2002 injunction based\nsolely on its conclusion that presence of the cross on fed\neral land conveyed an impression of governmental en\ndorsement of religion. The court expressly disavowed any\ninquiry into whether the Government’s actions had a\nsecular purpose or caused excessive entanglement. Buono\nI, 212 F. Supp. 2d, at 1215, 1217, n. 9. The Court of Ap\npeals affirmed the injunction on the same grounds, simi\nlarly eschewing any scrutiny of governmental purpose.\nBuono II, 371 F. 3d, at 550.\n   Although, for purposes of the opinion, the propriety of\nthe 2002 injunction may be assumed, the following discus\nsion should not be read to suggest this Court’s agreement\nwith that judgment, some aspects of which may be ques\ntionable. The goal of avoiding governmental endorsement\ndoes not require eradication of all religious symbols in the\npublic realm. A cross by the side of a public highway\nmarking, for instance, the place where a state trooper\nperished need not be taken as a statement of governmen\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          15\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\ntal support for sectarian beliefs. The Constitution does\nnot oblige government to avoid any public acknowledg\nment of religion’s role in society. See Lee v. Weisman, 505\nU. S. 577, 598 (1992) (“A relentless and all-pervasive\nattempt to exclude religion from every aspect of public life\ncould itself become inconsistent with the Constitution”).\nSee also Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of\nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327,\n334 (1987) (“This Court has long recognized that the gov\nernment may (and sometimes must) accommodate reli\ngious practices and that it may do so without violating the\nEstablishment Clause” (internal quotation marks omit\nted)). Rather, it leaves room to accommodate divergent\nvalues within a constitutionally permissible framework.\n   Even assuming the propriety of the original relief,\nhowever, the question before the District Court in Buono\nIII was whether to invalidate the land transfer. Given the\nsole reliance on perception as a basis for the 2002 injunc\ntion, one would expect that any relief grounded on that\ndecree would have rested on the same basis. But the\nDistrict Court enjoined the land transfer on an entirely\ndifferent basis: its suspicion of an illicit governmental\npurpose. See Buono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1182. The\ncourt made no inquiry into the effect that knowledge of the\ntransfer of the land to private ownership would have had\non any perceived governmental endorsement of religion,\nthe harm to which the 2002 injunction was addressed.\nThe District Court thus used an injunction granted for one\nreason as the basis for enjoining conduct that was alleged\nto be objectionable for a different reason. Ordering relief\nunder such circumstances was improper—absent a finding\nthat the relief was necessary to address an independent\nwrong. See ibid., n. 8 (noting that the court “need not\nconsider [Buono’s] other contention that the land transfer\nitself is an independent violation of the Establishment\nClause”).\n16                   SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n   The District Court should have evaluated Buono’s modi\nfication request in light of the objectives of the 2002 in\njunction. The injunction was issued to address the im\npression conveyed by the cross on federal, not private,\nland. Even if its purpose were characterized more gener\nally as avoiding the perception of governmental endorse\nment, that purpose would favor—or at least not oppose—\nownership of the cross by a private party rather than by\nthe Government. Cf. Pleasant Grove City v. Summum,\n555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8) (“[P]ersons who\nobserve donated monuments routinely—and reasonably—\ninterpret them as conveying some message on the property\nowner’s behalf”).\n   Buono argues that the cross would continue to stand on\nSunrise Rock, which has no visual differentiation from the\nrest of the primarily federally owned Preserve. He also\npoints to the reversionary clause in the land-transfer\nstatute requiring that the land be returned to the Gov\nernment if not maintained as a World War I memorial.\nFinally, he notes that the cross remains designated a\nnational memorial by an Act of Congress, which arguably\nwould prevent the VFW from dismantling the cross even if\nit wanted to do so. Brief for Respondent 37–48.\n   The District Court failed to consider whether, in light of\nthe change in law and circumstances effected by the land\ntransfer statute, the “reasonable observer” standard con\ntinued to be the appropriate framework through which to\nconsider the Establishment Clause concerns invoked to\njustify the requested relief. As a general matter, courts\nconsidering Establishment Clause challenges do not in\nquire into “reasonable observer” perceptions with respect\nto objects on private land. Even if, however, this standard\nwere the appropriate one, but see County of Allegheny, 492\nU. S., at 668 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment in part\nand dissenting in part) (criticizing the “reasonable ob\nserver” test); Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          17\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nPinette, 515 U. S. 753 763–768 (1995) (plurality opinion)\n(criticizing reliance on “perceived endorsement”), it is not\nclear that Buono’s claim is meritorious. That test requires\nthe hypothetical construct of an objective observer who\nknows all of the pertinent facts and circumstances sur\nrounding the symbol and its placement. See id., at 780\n(O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg\nment). But see id., at 767–768 (plurality opinion) (doubt\ning the workability of the reasonable observer test). Ap\nplying this test here, the message conveyed by the cross\nwould be assessed in the context of all relevant factors.\nSee Van Orden, 545 U. S., at 700 (BREYER, J., concurring\nin judgment) (the Establishment Clause inquiry “must\ntake account of context and consequences”); Lee, supra, at\n597 (“Our Establishment Clause jurisprudence remains a\ndelicate and fact-sensitive one”).\n   The District Court did not attempt to reassess the find\nings in Buono I in light of the policy of accommodation\nthat Congress had embraced. Rather, the District Court\nconcentrated solely on the religious aspects of the cross,\ndivorced from its background and context. But a Latin\ncross is not merely a reaffirmation of Christian beliefs. It\nis a symbol often used to honor and respect those whose\nheroic acts, noble contributions, and patient striving help\nsecure an honored place in history for this Nation and its\npeople. Here, one Latin cross in the desert evokes far\nmore than religion. It evokes thousands of small crosses\nin foreign fields marking the graves of Americans who fell\nin battles, battles whose tragedies are compounded if the\nfallen are forgotten.\n   Respect for a coordinate branch of Government forbids\nstriking down an Act of Congress except upon a clear\nshowing of unconstitutionality. See United States v. Mor\nrison, 529 U. S. 598, 607 (2000); El Paso & Northeastern\nR. Co. v. Gutierrez, 215 U. S. 87, 96 (1909). The same\nrespect requires that a congressional command be given\n18                  SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\neffect unless no legal alternative exists. Even if, contrary\nto the congressional judgment, the land transfer were\nthought an insufficient accommodation in light of the\nearlier finding of religious endorsement, it was incumbent\nupon the District Court to consider less drastic relief than\ncomplete invalidation of the land-transfer statute. See\nAyotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546\nU. S. 320, 329 (2006) (in granting relief, “we try not to\nnullify more of a legislature’s work than is necessary, for\nwe know that [a] ruling of unconstitutionality frustrates\nthe intent of the elected representatives of the people”\n(internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original));\nAlaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U. S. 678, 684 (1987).\nFor instance, if there is to be a conveyance, the question\nmight arise regarding the necessity of further action, such\nas signs to indicate the VFW’s ownership of the land. As\nwe have noted, Congress directed the Secretary of the\nInterior to install near the cross a replica of its original\nmemorial plaque. One of the signs that appears in early\nphotographs of the cross specifically identifies the VFW as\nthe group that erected it.\n   Noting the possibility of specific remedies, however, is\nnot an indication of agreement about the continued neces\nsity for injunctive relief. The land-transfer statute’s bear\ning on this dispute must first be determined. To date, this\nCourt’s jurisprudence in this area has refrained from\nmaking sweeping pronouncements, and this case is ill\nsuited for announcing categorical rules. In light of the\nfinding of unconstitutionality in Buono I, and the highly\nfact-specific nature of the inquiry, it is best left to the\nDistrict Court to undertake the analysis in the first in\nstance. On remand, if Buono continues to challenge im\nplementation of the statute, the District Court should\nconduct a proper inquiry as described above.\n                Cite as: 559 U.

The cross is of\ncourse the preeminent symbol of Christianity, and Easter\nservices have long been held on Sunrise Rock, 371 F. 3d\n543, 548 (CA9 2004). But, as noted, the original reason for\nthe placement of the cross was to commemorate American\nwar dead and, particularly for those with searing memo\nries of The Great War, the symbol that was selected, a\nplain unadorned white cross, no doubt evoked the unfor\ngettable image of the white crosses, row on row, that\nmarked the final resting places of so many American\nsoldiers who fell in that conflict.\n   This is roughly how things stood until the plaintiff in\n\n——————\n  8 See Dept. of Interior, National Park Service, Mojave National Pre\nserve, Operating Hours & Seasons, http://www.nps.gov/moja/planyourvisit/\nhours.htm; D.

BUONO\n\n                        Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nthis case, an employee of the National Park Service who\nsometimes viewed the cross during the performance of his\nduties and claims to have been offended by its presence on\nfederally owned land, brought this suit and obtained an\ninjunction restraining the Federal Government from\n“permitting the display of the Latin cross in the area of\nSunrise Rock.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 146a. After the\nNinth Circuit affirmed that decision, and the Government\nelected not to seek review by this Court, Congress faced a\nproblem.\n  If Congress had done nothing, the Government would\nhave been required to take down the cross, which had\nstood on Sunrise Rock for nearly 70 years, and this re\nmoval would have been viewed by many as a sign of disre\nspect for the brave soldiers whom the cross was meant to\nhonor. The demolition of this venerable if unsophisticated,\nmonument would also have been interpreted by some as an\narresting symbol of a Government that is not neutral but\nhostile on matters of religion and is bent on eliminating\nfrom all public places and symbols any trace of our coun\ntry’s religious heritage. Cf. Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U. S.\n677, 704 (2005) (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment).\n  One possible solution would have been to supplement\nthe monument on Sunrise Rock so that it appropriately\nrecognized the religious diversity of the American soldiers\nwho gave their lives in the First World War. In American\nmilitary cemeteries overseas, the graves of soldiers who\nperished in that war were marked with either a white\ncross or a white Star of David.9 More than 3,500 Jewish\n——————\n  9 See D. Holt, American Military Cemeteries 473, 474 (1992); see\n\nalso American Battle Monuments Commission, http://www.abmc.gov/\ncemeteries / cemeteries.php (containing photographs of the two\ntypes of markers). This policy presumably reflected the relig\nious makeup of the Armed Forces at the time of the First World\nWar. Today, veterans and their families may select any of 39\ntypes of headstones. See U.

But Congress may\nwell have thought—not without reason—that the addition\nof yet another religious symbol would have been unlikely\nto satisfy the plaintiff, his attorneys, or the lower courts\nthat had found the existing monument to be uncon\nstitutional on the ground that it impermissibly endorsed\nreligion.\n  Congress chose an alternative approach that was de\nsigned to eliminate any perception of religious sponsorship\nstemming from the location of the cross on federally owned\nland, while at the same time avoiding the disturbing\nsymbolism associated with the destruction of the historic\nmonument. The mechanism that Congress selected is one\nthat is quite common in the West, a “land exchange.”11\nCongress enacted a law under which ownership of the\nparcel of land on which Sunrise Rock is located would be\ntransferred to the VFW in exchange for another nearby\nparcel of equal value. Congress required that the Sunrise\nRock parcel be used for a war memorial, §8121(a), 117\nStat. 1100, but Congress did not prevent the VFW from\nsupplementing the existing monument or replacing it with\na war memorial of a different design.

BUONO\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nSTEVENS characterizes this land exchange as one that\nendorses “a particular religious view,” post, at 26 (dissent\ning opinion), it is noteworthy that Congress, in which our\ncountry’s religious diversity is well represented, passed\nthis law by overwhelming majorities: 95–0 in the Senate\nand 407–15 in the House. See 149 Cong. Rec. H8793\n(Sept. 24, 2003); id., at S11943 (Sept. 25, 2003). In my\nview, there is no legal ground for blocking the implemen\ntation of this law.\n   The dissent contends that the land transfer would vio\nlate the District Court injunction, but that argument, for\nthe reasons explained in JUSTICE SCALIA’s opinion, see\npost, at 2 (concurring in judgment), is plainly unsound.\nThe obvious meaning of the injunction was simply that the\nGovernment could not allow the cross to remain on federal\nland.\n   There is also no merit in JUSTICE STEVENS’ contention\nthat implementation of the statute would constitute an\nendorsement of Christianity and would thus violate the\nEstablishment Clause. Assuming that it is appropriate to\napply the so-called “endorsement test,” this test would not\nbe violated by the land exchange. The endorsement test\nviews a challenged display through the eyes of a hypo\nthetical reasonable observer who is deemed to be aware of\nthe history and all other pertinent facts relating to a\nchallenged display.      See ante, at 16–17 (opinion of\nKENNEDY, J.). Here, therefore, this observer would be\nfamiliar with the origin and history of the monument and\nwould also know both that the land on which the monu\nment is located is privately owned and that the new owner\nis under no obligation to preserve the monument’s present\ndesign. With this knowledge, a reasonable observer would\nnot view the land exchange as the equivalent of the con\nstruction of an official World War I memorial on the Na\ntional Mall. Cf. post, at 26.

S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 70) (STEVENS, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). Congress has\nshown notable solicitude for the rights of religious minori\nties.

I would not jump to the conclusion that Congress’ aim\nin enacting the land-transfer law was to embrace the\nreligious message of the cross; rather, I see no reason to\ndoubt that Congress’ consistent goal, in legislating with\nregard to the Sunrise Rock monument, has been to com\nmemorate our Nation’s war dead and to avoid the disturb\ning symbolism that would have been created by the de\nstruction of the monument.\n   For these reasons, I would reverse the decision below\nand remand with instructions to vacate the order prohibit\ning the implementation of the land-transfer statute.\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

My reason, however, is quite different: In my view\nwe need not—indeed, cannot—decide the merits of the\nparties’ dispute, because Frank Buono lacks Article III\nstanding to pursue the relief he seeks. The District Court\nhad no power to award the requested relief, and our au\nthority is limited to “ ‘announcing the fact and dismissing\nthe cause.’ ” Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment,\n523 U. S. 83, 94 (1998) (quoting Ex parte McCardle, 7\nWall. 506, 514 (1869)).\n  The plurality is correct that Buono’s standing to obtain\nthe original injunction is not before us. See ante, at 7.1\n——————\n   1 The Court of Appeals’ conclusion that Buono had standing to seek\n\nthe original injunction does not, however, control our decision here\nunder the law-of-the-case doctrine. That doctrine comes into play only\nif an issue we are asked to resolve has already been decided in the same\nlitigation. See Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S. 332, 347, n. 18 (1979). In its\nearlier decision, the Ninth Circuit addressed only Buono’s standing to\nseek the original injunction barring the display of the cross on public\nland. See Buono v. Norton, 371 F. 3d 543, 546–548 (2004). It had no\noccasion to address his standing to seek an expansion of the injunction\nto bar a transfer enabling the cross’s display on private property.\n2                        SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nNor is Buono’s standing to request enforcement of the\noriginal injunction at issue. If he sought only to compel\ncompliance with the existing order, Article III would not\nstand in his way.\n  As the plurality all but admits, however, the relief\nBuono requests and the District Court awarded in this\nproceeding is not enforcement of the original injunction\nbut expansion of it. See ante, at 15. The only reasonable\nreading of the original injunction, in context, is that it\nproscribed the cross’s display on federal land. Buono’s\nalleged injuries arose from the cross’s presence on public\nproperty, see App. 50, 59, and the injunction accordingly\nprohibited the Government, its “employees, agents, and\nthose in active concert with [them] . . . from permitting the\ndisplay of the Latin cross in the area of Sunrise Rock in\nthe Mojave National Preserve.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n146a. Barring the Government from “permitting” the\ncross’s display at a particular location makes sense only if\nthe Government owns the location. As the proprietor, it\ncan remove the cross that private parties have erected and\ndeny permission to erect another. But if the land is pri\nvately owned, the Government can prevent the cross’s\ndisplay only by making it illegal. Prohibitory legislation\ndoes not consist of a mere refusal to “permi[t],” nor is the\nenactment of legislation what the injunction commanded\n(a command that would raise serious First Amendment\nand separation-of-powers questions).2\n——————\nMoreover, Buono failed to raise the issue in his brief in opposition to\ncertiorari, and we may deem it waived. See this Court’s Rule 15.2; cf.\nKnowles v. Iowa, 525 U. S. 113, 116, n. 2 (1998).\n  2 The principal dissent does not dispute that the original injunction\n\ndid not require the Government to ban the cross’s display on private\nland, yet it insists that the injunction nonetheless forbade transferring\nthe land to a private party who could keep the cross in place. Post, at\n6–7 (opinion of STEVENS, J.). But there is no basis in the injunction’s\ntext for treating a sale of the land to a private purchaser who does not\npromise to take the cross down as “permitting” the cross’s display,\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   The District Court’s 2005 order purporting to “enforce”\nthe earlier injunction went well beyond barring the dis\nplay of the cross on public property. Id., at 98a. At\nBuono’s request, the court enjoined certain Government\nofficials and “anyone acting in concert with them . . . from\nimplementing the provisions of Section 8121 of Public Law\n108–87,” the statutory provision enacted after the original\ninjunction that directs the Executive Branch to transfer\nthe memorial to the VFW. Id., at 99a.\n   Because Buono seeks new relief, he must show (and the\nDistrict Court should have ensured) that he has standing\nto pursue it. As the party invoking federal-court jurisdic\ntion, Buono “bears the burden of showing that he has\nstanding for each type of relief sought,” Summers v. Earth\nIsland Institute, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 4);\nsee Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 105 (1983). A\nplaintiff cannot sidestep Article III’s requirements by\ncombining a request for injunctive relief for which he has\nstanding with a request for injunctive relief for which he\nlacks standing. And for the same reason, a plaintiff can\nnot ask a court to expand an existing injunction unless he\nhas standing to seek the additional relief.\n   Buono must therefore demonstrate that the additional\nrelief he sought—blocking the transfer of the memorial to\na private party—will “redress or prevent actual or immi\nnently threatened injury to [him] caused by private or\n——————\nwhen failing to forbid the cross’s presence on already-private land\nwithin the Mojave National Preserve would not be treated as such. The\nlatter no less involves “allow[ing] the act or existence of” or “tol\nerat[ing]” the display of the cross. Webster’s New International Dic\ntionary 1824 (2d ed. 1957). The principal dissent responds that in\ndetermining whether the transfer complies with the original injunction\nwe “cannot start from a baseline in which the cross has already been\ntransferred.” Post, at 7. But the effect of transferring the land to a\nprivate party free to keep the cross standing is identical, so far as the\noriginal injunction is concerned, to allowing a party who already owned\nthe land to leave the cross in place.\n4                         SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nofficial violation of law.” Summers, supra, at ___ (slip op.,\nat 4). He has failed, however, to allege any actual or\nimminent injury. To begin with, the predicate for any\ninjury he might assert—that the VFW, after taking pos\nsession of the land, will continue to display the cross—is at\nthis stage merely speculative.3 Nothing in the statutes\ncompels the VFW (or any future proprietor) to keep it up.\nThe land reverts back to the Government only if “the\nconveyed property is no longer being maintained as a war\nmemorial,” Pub. L. 108–87, §8121(e), 117 Stat. 1100,\nwhich does not depend on whether the cross remains.4\n   Moreover, Buono has not alleged, much less established,\nthat he will be harmed if the VFW does decide to keep the\ncross. To the contrary, his amended complaint averred\nthat “he is deeply offended by the display of a Latin Cross\non government-owned property” but “has no objection to\nChristian symbols on private property.” App. 50. In a\nsubsequent deposition he agreed with the statement that\n“[t]he only thing that’s offensive about this cross is that\n[he has] discovered that it’s located on federal land.” Id.,\nat 85. And in a signed declaration several months later,\n——————\n   3 Buono argues that the Government’s continued supervision of the\n\nsite, its reversionary interest in the property, and the memorial’s\nongoing designation as a national memorial add to the Establishment\nClause violation. Brief for Respondent 37–48. But those aspects would\nbe irrelevant if the cross were no longer displayed.\n   4 The principal dissent insists, post, at 4–5, n. 2, that it is clear the\n\ncross will remain because the VFW asserted in an amicus brief that it\n“intends to maintain and preserve the Veterans Memorial as a memo\nrial to United States veterans,” and elsewhere referred to “the seven\nfoot-tall cross and plaque that comprise the Veterans Memorial,” Brief\nfor VFW of the United States et al. as Amici Curiae 4, 7. But the\ngroup’s stated intentions do not prove that the cross will stay put. The\nVFW might not follow through on its plans (this VFW post already\nbecame “defunct” once during this litigation, id., at 34); it might move\nthe cross to another private parcel and substitute a different monument\non Sunrise Rock; or it might sell the land to someone else who decides\nto honor the dead without the cross.\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   5\n\n                  SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nhe reiterated that although the “presence of the cross on\nfederally owned land in the Preserve deeply offends [him]\nand impairs [his] enjoyment of the Preserve,” he “ha[s] no\nobjection to Christian symbols on private property.” Id., at\n64–65. In short, even assuming that being “deeply of\nfended” by a religious display (and taking steps to avoid\nseeing it) constitutes a cognizable injury, Buono has made\nclear that he will not be offended.5\n   These same considerations bear upon the plurality’s\nassertion that Buono has standing to “prevent the Gov\nernment from frustrating or evading” the original injunc\ntion, ante, at 8. If this refers to frustration or evasion in a\nnarrow sense, the injunction is in no need of—indeed, is\ninsusceptible of—protection. It was issued to remedy the\nsole complaint that Buono had brought forward: erection\nof a cross on public land. And it was entirely effective in\nremedying that complaint, having induced Congress to\nabandon public ownership of the land. If meant in this\nnarrow sense, the plurality’s assertion of a need to prevent\nfrustration or evasion by the Government ignores the\nreality that the District Court’s 2005 order awarded new\nrelief beyond the scope of the original injunction. The\nrevised injunction is directed at Buono’s new complaint\nthat the manner of abandoning public ownership and the\n——————\n  5 The principal dissent argues that despite these disclaimers in\n\nBuono’s complaint, deposition, and declaration, his real injury is his\ninability “to freely use the area of the Preserve around the cross be\ncause the Government’s unconstitutional endorsement of the cross will\ninduce him to avoid the Sunrise Rock area.” Post, at 4–5, n. 2 (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted). But the only “endorsement” of\nwhich Buono complained was “[t]he placement of the Cross on feder\nally-owned land,” App. 59, which “offend[s]” him only because the\nproperty “is not open to groups and individuals to erect other freestand\ning, permanent displays,” App. 50. Nothing in Buono’s complaint,\ndeposition, or declaration establishes that he will be unable “to freely\nuse the area of the Preserve” if Sunrise Rock is made private property\nand its new proprietor displays the cross.\n6                        SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                  SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nnature of the new private ownership violate the Estab\nlishment Clause. Now it may be that a court has subject\nmatter jurisdiction to prevent frustration or evasion of its\nprior injunction in a broader sense—that is, to eliminate\nan unconstitutional manner of satisfying that prior injunc\ntion. But it surely cannot do so unless it has before it\nsomeone who has standing to complain of that unconstitu\ntional manner. If preventing frustration or evasion of an\ninjunction includes expanding it to cover additional ac\ntions that produce no concrete harm to the original plain\ntiff, our standing law in this area will make no sense.\n   It is no answer that a district court has discretion to\nexpand an injunction it has issued if it finds the existing\nterms are not fulfilling the original purpose. Doubtless it\ncan do that, and is in that sense the master of its own\ninjunctions. But whether the District Court abused that\ndiscretion by enlarging the injunction is beside the point.\nWhat matters is that it granted relief beyond the existing\norder, and that Buono must have had standing to seek the\nextension.\n   It also makes no difference that the District Court said\nit was merely enforcing its original injunction. The ques\ntion is whether in fact the new order goes beyond the old\none. If so, the court must satisfy itself of jurisdiction to\naward the additional relief—which includes making cer\ntain the plaintiff has standing. See Steel Co., 523 U. S., at\n94. That is true whether the court revisits the injunction\nat a party’s request or on its own initiative; Article III’s\ncase-or-controversy requirement is not merely a prerequi\nsite to relief, but a restraint on judicial power. See Sum\nmers, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 4).6\n——————\n  6 I agree with JUSTICE BREYER that in interpreting an ambiguous\n\ninjunction we should give great weight to the interpretation of the\njudge who issued it.

L. 107–117, §8137(a), 115 Stat. 2278. Later that\nyear, in a judgment not open to question, the District\nCourt determined that the display of that cross violated\nthe Establishment Clause because it “convey[ed] a mes­\nsage of endorsement of religion.” Buono v. Norton, 212\nF. Supp. 2d 1202, 1217 (CD Cal. 2002) (Buono I). The\nquestion in this case is whether Congress’ subsequent\ndecision to transfer ownership of the property underlying\nthe cross cured that violation.\n   “The Establishment Clause, if nothing else, prohibits\ngovernment from ‘specifying details upon which men and\nwomen who believe in a benevolent, omnipotent Creator\nand Ruler of the world are known to differ.’ ” Van Orden v.\nPerry, 545 U. S. 677, 718 (2005) (STEVENS, J., dissenting)\n(quoting Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, 641 (1992)\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting)). A Latin cross necessarily sym­\nbolizes one of the most important tenets upon which be­\nlievers in a benevolent Creator, as well as nonbelievers,\n2                    SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nare known to differ. In my view, the District Court was\nright to enforce its prior judgment by enjoining Congress’\nproposed remedy—a remedy that was engineered to leave\nthe cross intact and that did not alter its basic meaning. I\ncertainly agree that the Nation should memorialize the\nservice of those who fought and died in World War I, but it\ncannot lawfully do so by continued endorsement of a\nstarkly sectarian message.\n                               I\n   As the history recounted by the plurality indicates, this\ncase comes to us in a procedural posture that significantly\nnarrows the question presented to the Court. In the first\nstage of this litigation, the District Court and the Court of\nAppeals ruled that the Government violated the Estab­\nlishment Clause by permitting the display of a single\nwhite Latin cross at Sunrise Rock. Those courts further\nruled that the appropriate remedy was an injunction\nprohibiting the Government from “permitting the display\nof the Latin cross in the area of Sunrise Rock in the Mo­\njave National Preserve.” App. 39. The Government de­\nclined to seek a writ of certiorari following those rulings.\nAccordingly, for the purpose of this case, it is settled that\n“the Sunrise Rock cross will project a message of govern­\nment endorsement [of religion] to a reasonable observer,”\nBuono v. Norton, 371 F. 3d 543, 549 (CA9 2004) (Buono\nII), and that the District Court’s remedy for that endorse­\nment was proper.\n   We are, however, faced with an additional fact: Con­\ngress has enacted a statute directing the Secretary of the\nInterior to transfer a 1-acre parcel of land containing the\ncross to the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), subject to\ncertain conditions, in exchange for a 5-acre parcel of land\nelsewhere in the Preserve. See Department of Defense\nAppropriations Act, 2004, Pub. L. 108–87, §8121, 117 Stat.\n1100. The District Court found that the land transfer\n                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                  3\n\n                       STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nunder §8121 “violate[d] [the] court’s judgment ordering a\npermanent injunction” and did not “actually cur[e] the\ncontinuing Establishment Clause violation.” Buono v.\nNorton, 364 F. Supp. 2d 1175, 1182 (CD Cal. 2005) (Buono\nIII). The District Court therefore enforced its 2002 judg­\nment by enjoining the transfer, without considering\nwhether “the land transfer itself is an independent viola­\ntion of the Establishment Clause.” Ibid., n. 8. Because\nthe District Court did not base its decision upon an inde­\npendent Establishment Clause violation, the constitution­\nality of the land-transfer statute is not before us. See\nante, at 10. Instead, the question we confront is whether\nthe District Court properly enforced its 2002 judgment by\nenjoining the transfer.\n   In answering that question we, like the District Court,\nmust first consider whether the transfer would violate the\n2002 injunction. We must then consider whether changed\ncircumstances nonetheless rendered enforcement of that\njudgment inappropriate; or conversely whether they made\nit necessary for the District Court to bar the transfer, even\nif the transfer is not expressly prohibited by the prior\ninjunction, in order to achieve the intended objective of the\ninjunction. The plurality correctly notes that “ ‘a court\nmust never ignore significant changes in the law or cir­\ncumstances underlying an injunction,’ ” ante, at 10 (quot­\ning 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice\nand Procedure §2961, pp. 393–394 (2d ed. 1995) (hereinaf­\nter Wright & Miller)), and “ ‘[a] continuing decree of in­\njunction directed to events to come is subject always to\nadaptation as events may shape the need,’ ” ante, at 14\n(quoting United States v.

But the\n4                         SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                          STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nparty seeks to enforce or modify an injunction, the only\ncircumstances that matter are changed circumstances.\nSee Swift, 286 U. S., at 119 (“The injunction, whether\nright or wrong, is not subject to impeachment in its appli­\ncation to the conditions that existed at its making”).\n   I further accept that the District Court’s task was to\nevaluate the changed circumstances “in light of the objec­\ntives of the 2002 injunction.” Ante, at 16. This case does\nnot simply pit a plaintiff’s “prior showing of illegality”\nagainst a defendant’s claim that “changed circumstances\nhave rendered prospective relief inappropriate.” Ante, at\n14. That formulation implies that the changed circum­\nstances all cut in one direction, against prospective relief,\nand that the defendant has asked the court to alleviate its\nobligations. But it is important to note that in this case,\nthe Government did not move to “alleviate or eliminate\nconditions or restrictions imposed by the original decree”\nso as to permit the transfer. Wright & Miller §2961, at\n397. Rather, it was the beneficiary of the original injunc­\ntion who went back into court seeking its enforcement or\nmodification in light of the transfer. Plainly, respondent\nhad standing to seek enforcement of a decree in his favor.2\n——————\neffect of the legislative action in this case is different from its effect in\nour cases espousing that principle, which stand for the proposition that\nif a statutory “right has been modified by the competent authority”\nsince the decree, then an injunction enforcing the prior version of that\nright must be modified to conform to the change in the law. Pennsyl\nvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., 18 How. 421, 432 (1856); see\nalso Railway Employees v. Wright, 364 U. S. 642, 651 (1961) (“In a case\nlike this the District Court’s authority to adopt a consent decree comes\nonly from the statute which the decree is intended to enforce. . . . [I]t\n[must] be free to modify the terms of a consent decree when a change in\nlaw brings those terms in conflict with statutory objectives”). In a\nconstitutional case such as this, legislative action may modify the facts,\nbut it cannot change the applicable law.\n   2 To the extent the Government challenges respondent’s standing to\n\nseek the initial injunction, that issue is not before the Court for the\nreasons the plurality states. See ante, at 7. Moreover, in my view\n                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     5\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   Respondent argued that such action was necessary,\neither to enforce the plain terms of the 2002 injunction or\nto “achieve the purposes of the provisions of the decree,”\nUnited States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 391 U. S.\n244, 249 (1968); see Wright & Miller §2961, at 393 (“[A]\ncourt must continually be willing to redraft the order at\nthe request of the party who obtained equitable relief in\norder to insure that the decree accomplishes its intended\nresult”). Only at that point did the Government argue\nthat changed circumstances made prospective relief un­\nnecessary. This difference in focus is a subtle one, but it is\nimportant to emphasize that the question that was before\nthe District Court—and that is now before us—is whether\nenjoining the transfer was necessary to effectuate the\nletter or logic of the 2002 judgment.\n   Although I agree with the plurality’s basic framework, I\ndisagree with its decision to remand the case to the Dis­\ntrict Court. The District Court already “engage[d] in the\nappropriate inquiry,” ante, at 10, and it was well within its\nrights to enforce the 2002 judgment. First, the District\n——————\nrespondent has standing even under the analysis that JUSTICE SCALIA\nundertakes. It is not at all “speculative,” ante, at 4 (opinion concurring\nin judgment), that the VFW will continue to display the cross. VFW\nPost 385, the beneficiary of the land transfer, has filed an amici brief in\nthis case indicating it “intends to maintain and preserve the Veterans\nMemorial,” Brief for Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States\net al. as Amici Curiae 4, by which it means the cross, id., at 7 (identify­\ning the Veterans Memorial as the “cross and plaque”). Respondent did,\nin his amended complaint, aver that he was offended specifically “by\nthe display of a Latin Cross on government-owned property.” App. 50.\nBut his claimed injury is that he is “unable to freely use the area of the\nPreserve around the cross,” Buono v. Norton, 371 F. 3d 543, 547 (CA9\n2004) (Buono II) (internal quotation marks omitted), because the\nGovernment’s unconstitutional endorsement of the cross will induce\nhim to avoid the Sunrise Rock area, even though it offers the most\nconvenient route to the Preserve, App. 65. That endorsement and\nrespondent’s resulting injury not only persist, but have been aggra­\nvated by the Government’s actions since the complaint was filed.\n6                    SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nCourt properly recognized that the transfer was a means\nof “permitting”—indeed, encouraging—the display of the\ncross. The transfer therefore would violate the terms of\nthe court’s original injunction. Second, even if the transfer\nwould not violate the terms of the 2002 injunction, the\nDistrict Court properly took into account events that\ntranspired since 2002 and determined that barring the\ntransfer was necessary to achieve the intended result of\nthe 2002 decree, as the transfer would not eliminate gov­\nernment endorsement of religion.\n                              II\n   The first step in the analysis is straightforward: The\nDistrict Court had to ask whether the transfer of the\nproperty would violate the extant injunction. Under the\nterms of that injunction, the answer was yes.\n   The 2002 injunction barred the Government from “per­\nmitting the display of the Latin cross in the area of Sun­\nrise Rock in the Mojave National Preserve.” App. 39. The\nland-transfer statute mandated transfer of the land to an\norganization that has announced its intention to maintain\nthe cross on Sunrise Rock. That action surely “permit[s]”\nthe display of the cross. See 11 Oxford English Dictionary\n578 (2d ed. 1989) (defining “permit” as “[t]o admit or allow\nthe doing or occurrence of; to give leave or opportunity\nfor”). True, the Government would no longer exert direct\ncontrol over the cross. But the transfer itself would be an\nact permitting its display.\n   I therefore disagree with JUSTICE SCALIA that the “only\nreasonable reading of the original injunction . . . is that it\nproscribed the cross’s display on federal land.” Ante, at 2\n(opinion concurring in judgment). If the land were already\nprivately owned, JUSTICE SCALIA may be correct that the\ncross’ display on Sunrise Rock would not violate the in­\njunction because the Government would not have to do\nanything to allow the cross to stand, and the Government\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ncould try to prevent its display only by making such a\ndisplay illegal. But the Government does own this land,\nand the transfer statute requires the Executive Branch to\ntake an affirmative act (transfer to private ownership)\ndesigned to keep the cross in place. In evaluating a claim\nthat the Government would impermissibly “permit” the\ncross’ display by effecting a transfer, a court cannot\nstart from a baseline in which the cross has already been\ntransferred.\n   Moreover, §8121 was designed specifically to foster the\ndisplay of the cross. Regardless of why the Government\nwanted to “accommodat[e]” the interests associated with\nits display, ante, at 13 (plurality opinion), it was not only\nforeseeable but also intended that the cross would remain\nstanding. Indeed, so far as the record indicates, the Gov­\nernment had no other purpose for turning over this land to\nprivate hands. It was therefore proper for the District\nCourt to find that the transfer would violate its 2002\ninjunction and to enforce that injunction against the\ntransfer.\n                             III\n   As already noted, it was respondent, the beneficiary of\nthe injunction, who moved the District Court for relief.\nWhen the beneficiary of an injunction seeks relief “to\nachieve the purposes of the provisions of the decree,”\nUnited Shoe Machinery Corp., 391 U. S., at 249, a district\ncourt has the authority to “modify the decree so as to\nachieve the required result with all appropriate expedi­\ntion,” id., at 252. Thus, regardless of whether the transfer\nwas prohibited by the plain terms of the 2002 judgment,\nthe District Court properly inquired into whether enjoin­\ning the transfer was necessary to achieve the objective of\nthat judgment. The Government faces a high burden in\narguing the District Court exceeded its authority. A de­\ncree “may not be changed in the interests of the defen­\n8                    SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ndants if the purposes of the litigation . . . have not been\nfully achieved.” Id., at 248 (emphasis deleted). And con­\ntrary to the Government’s position, the changed circum­\nstances in this case support, rather than count against,\nthe District Court’s enforcement decision.\n  The objective of the 2002 judgment, as the plurality\ngrudgingly allows, was to “avoi[d] the perception of gov­\nernmental endorsement” of religion. Ante, at 16; see\nBuono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1178 (analyzing “ ‘whether\ngovernment action endorsing religion has actually ceased’ ”\nin light of the transfer). The parties do not disagree on\nthis point; rather, they dispute whether the transfer would\nend government endorsement of the cross. Compare Brief\nfor Petitioners 21 (“Congress’s transfer of the land . . .\nends any governmental endorsement of the cross”) with\nBrief for Respondent 34 (“[T]he government’s endorsement\nof the Christian cross is not remedied” by the land trans­\nfer). The District Court rightly found that the transfer\nwould not end government endorsement of the cross.\n  A government practice violates the Establishment\nClause if it “either has the purpose or effect of ‘endorsing’\nreligion.” County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties\nUnion, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 592\n(1989). “Whether the key word is ‘endorsement,’ ‘favorit­\nism,’ or ‘promotion,’ the essential principle remains the\nsame. The Establishment Clause, at the very least, pro­\nhibits government from appearing to take a position on\nquestions of religious belief or from ‘making adherence to\na religion relevant in any way to a person’s standing\nin the political community.’ ” Id., at 593–594 (quoting\nLynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 687 (1984) (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring)).\n  The 2002 injunction was based on a finding that display\nof the cross had the effect of endorsing religion. That is,\n“the Sunrise Rock cross . . . project[s] a message of gov­\nernment endorsement [of religion] to a reasonable ob­\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nserver.” Buono II, 371 F. 3d, at 549. The determination\nthat the Government had endorsed religion necessarily\nrested on two premises: first, that the Government en­\ndorsed the cross, and second, that the cross “take[s] a\nposition on questions of religious belief” or “ ‘mak[es] ad­\nherence to religion relevant . . . to a person’s standing in\nthe political community,’ ” County of Allegheny, 492 U. S.,\nat 594. Taking the District Court’s 2002 finding of an\nEstablishment Clause violation as res judicata, as we\nmust, the land transfer has the potential to dislodge only\nthe first of those premises, in that the transfer might\nchange the Government’s endorsing relationship with the\ncross. As I explain below, I disagree that the transfer\nordered by §8121 would in fact have this result. But it is\nalso worth noting at the outset that the transfer statute\ncould not (and does not) dislodge the second premise—that\nthe cross conveys a religious message. Continuing gov­\nernment endorsement of the cross is thus continuing\ngovernment endorsement of religion.\n   In my view, the transfer ordered by §8121 would not end\ngovernment endorsement of the cross for two independ­\nently sufficient reasons. First, after the transfer it would\ncontinue to appear to any reasonable observer that the\nGovernment has endorsed the cross, notwithstanding that\nthe name has changed on the title to a small patch of\nunderlying land. This is particularly true because the\nGovernment has designated the cross as a national memo­\nrial, and that endorsement continues regardless of\nwhether the cross sits on public or private land. Second,\nthe transfer continues the existing government endorse­\nment of the cross because the purpose of the transfer is to\npreserve its display. Congress’ intent to preserve the\ndisplay of the cross maintains the Government’s endorse­\nment of the cross.\n   The plurality does not conclude to the contrary; that is,\nit does not decide that the transfer would end government\n10                      SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nendorsement of the cross and the religious message it\nconveys. Rather, the plurality concludes that the District\nCourt did not conduct an appropriate analysis, and it\nremands the case for a do-over. I take up each of the\npurported faults the plurality finds in the District Court’s\nanalysis in my examination of the reasons why the trans­\nfer does not cure the existing Establishment Clause\nviolation.\nPerception of the Cross Post-Transfer\n  The 2002 injunction was based upon a finding of im­\npermissible effect: The “Sunrise Rock cross . . . project[s] a\nmessage of government endorsement [of religion] to a\nreasonable observer.” Buono II, 371 F. 3d, at 549. The\ntransfer would not end that impermissible state of affairs\nbecause the cross, post-transfer, would still have “the\neffect of communicating a message of government en­\ndorsement . . . of religion.” Lynch, 465 U. S., at 692\n(O’Connor, J., concurring). As the Court of Appeals cor­\nrectly found, “[n]othing in the present posture of the case\nalters” the conclusion that a “reasonable observer would\nperceive governmental endorsement of the message” the\ncross conveys. Buono v. Kempthorne, 527 F. 3d 758, 783\n(CA9 2008) (Buono IV).3\n——————\n  3 The  plurality faults the District Court for not engaging in this\nanalysis, but the District Court did implicitly consider how a reason­\nable observer would perceive the cross post-transfer when it analyzed\nthe terms of the transfer, the Government’s continuing property rights\nin the conveyed land, and the history of the Government’s efforts to\npreserve the cross. Furthermore, the Court of Appeals affirmed the\nDistrict Court’s order on the express ground that a reasonable observer\nwould still perceive government endorsement of the cross. See Buono\nIV, 527 F. 3d, at 782–783.\n  THE CHIEF JUSTICE suggests this is much ado about nothing because\nrespondent’s counsel conceded that the injunction would not be violated\nwere the Government to have gone through an “empty ritual” of taking\ndown the cross before transferring the land. Ante, at 1 (concurring\nopinion). But in the colloquy to which THE CHIEF JUSTICE refers,\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   11\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   In its original judgment, the Court of Appeals found\nthat a well-informed reasonable observer would perceive\ngovernment endorsement of religion, notwithstanding the\ncross’ initial “placement by private individuals,” based\nupon the following facts: “that the cross rests on public\nland[,] . . . that Congress has designated the cross as a war\nmemorial and prohibited the use of funds to remove it, and\nthat the Park Service has denied similar access for expres­\nsion by an adherent of the . . . Buddhist faith.” Buono II,\n371 F. 3d, at 550. After the transfer, a well-informed\nobserver would know that the cross was no longer on\npublic land, but would additionally be aware of the follow­\ning facts: The cross was once on public land, the Govern­\nment was enjoined from permitting its display, Congress\ntransferred it to a specific purchaser in order to preserve\nits display in the same location, and the Government\nmaintained a reversionary interest in the land. From this\nchain of events, in addition to the factors that remain the\nsame after the transfer, he would perceive government\nendorsement of the cross.4\n——————\ncounsel assumed that the Government would not retain a reversionary\ninterest in the land, and that the cross would not retain its designation\nas a national memorial. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 44–45. Even under THE\nCHIEF JUSTICE’s revised version of the hypothetical, I would not so\nquickly decide that taking down the cross makes no material difference.\nAnd counsel’s statement takes no position as to whether the hypotheti­\ncal poses any constitutional problem independent of the injunction.\nRegardless, we must deal with the substance of the case before us,\nwhich involves much more than Congress directing the Government to\nexecute a simple land transfer.\n  4 A less informed reasonable observer, see Capitol Square Review and\n\nAdvisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 807 (1995) (STEVENS, J., dissent­\ning), would reach the same conclusion because the cross would still\nappear to stand on Government property. The transfer merely “carv[es]\nout a tiny parcel of property in the midst of this vast Preserve—like a\ndonut hole with the cross atop it.” Buono v. Kempthorne, 527 F. 3d\n758, 783 (CA9 2008). For any reasonable observer, then, the transfer\nsimply would not change the effect of the cross.\n12                   SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   Particularly important to this analysis is that although\nthe transfer might remove the implicit endorsement that\npresence on public land signifies, see Capitol Square\nReview and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 801\n(1995) (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (“The very fact that a sign\nis installed on public property implies official recognition\nand reinforcement of its message”), it would not change\nthe fact that the Government has taken several explicit\nactions to endorse this cross. In its decision upholding the\ninitial entry of the injunction, the Court of Appeals found\nthose actions contributed to a reasonable observer’s per­\nception of government endorsement. Buono II, 371 F. 3d,\nat 550. Their significance does not depend upon the own­\nership of the land.\n   In 2000, and again after the District Court had entered\nits initial injunction, Congress passed legislation prohibit­\ning the use of any federal funds to remove the cross from\nits location on federal property. See Consolidated Appro­\npriations Act, 2001, Pub. L. 106–554, App. D, §133, 114\nStat. 2763A–230; Department of Defense Appropriations\nAct, 2003, Pub. L. 107–248, §8065(b), 116 Stat. 1551.\nThus, beyond merely acquiescing in the continued pres­\nence of a cross on federal property, Congress singled out\nthat cross for special treatment, and it affirmatively com­\nmanded that the cross must remain.\n   Congress also made a more dramatic intervention.\nWithout the benefit of any committee hearings or floor\ndebate in either the Senate or the House of Representa­\ntives—indeed, without a moment of discussion in any\nofficial forum—Congress passed legislation officially des­\nignating the “five-foot-tall white cross” in the Mojave\nDesert “as a national memorial commemorating United\nStates participation in World War I and honoring the\nAmerican veterans of that war.” §8137(a), 115 Stat. 2278.\nThereafter, the cross was no longer just a local artifact; it\nacquired a formal national status of the highest order.\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

But the plurality does not acknowledge that when the\nNinth Circuit affirmed the 2002 judgment, it concluded that the desig­\nnation is one of the factors that would lead a reasonable observer to\nperceive government endorsement of religion. See Buono II, 371 F. 3d,\nat 550. Nor does the plurality address the effect of that designation on\na reasonable observer’s perception of the cross, regardless of whether\nthe cross sits on private land.

The plurality employs a revealing turn of\nphrase when it characterizes the cross as “a symbol that,\nwhile challenged under the Establishment Clause, has\ncomplex meaning beyond the expression of religious\nviews.” Ante, at 13. The days of considering the cross\nitself as challenged under the Establishment Clause are\nover; it is settled that the Government is not permitted to\nendorse the cross. However complex the meaning of the\ncross, the Court of Appeals in 2004 considered and re­\njected the argument that its dual symbolism as a war\nmemorial meant that government endorsement of the\ncross did not amount to endorsement of religion.

But this cross is not merely one part of a more elaborate\nmonument that, taken as a whole, may be understood to convey a\nprimarily nonreligious message. Rather, the cross is the only symbol\nconveying any message at all.\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

In argu­\ning that Congress can legitimately favor the cross because\nof its purported double meaning, the plurality implicitly\ntries to reopen what is closed.8\n   The plurality also poses a different objection to consid­\neration of whether the transfer would change a reasonable\nobserver’s perception of the cross. The plurality suggests\nthat the “ ‘reasonable observer’ standard” may not “be the\nappropriate framework” because “courts considering Es­\ntablishment Clause challenges do not,” as a general mat­\nter, “inquire into ‘reasonable observer’ perceptions with\nrespect to objects on private land.” Ante, at 16. Once\nagain, the plurality’s approach fails to pay heed to the\nposture of this case.\n   At the risk of stating the obvious, respondent is not\nsimply challenging a private object on private land. Al­\nthough “an Establishment Clause violation must be\nmoored in government action of some sort,” Pinette, 515\nU. S., at 779 (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concur­\n——————\n   8 The plurality’s assertions regarding the meaning of the cross are\n\ntherefore beside the point. For the record, however, I cannot agree that\na bare cross such as this conveys a nonsectarian meaning simply\nbecause crosses are often used to commemorate “heroic acts, noble\ncontributions, and patient striving” and to honor fallen soldiers. Ante,\nat 17. The cross is not a universal symbol of sacrifice. It is the symbol\nof one particular sacrifice, and that sacrifice carries deeply significant\nmeaning for those who adhere to the Christian faith. The cross has\nsometimes been used, it is true, to represent the sacrifice of an individ­\nual, as when it marks the grave of a fallen soldier or recognizes a state\ntrooper who perished in the line of duty. Even then, the cross carries a\nreligious meaning. But the use of the cross in such circumstances is\nlinked to, and shows respects for, the individual honoree’s faith and\nbeliefs. I, too, would consider it tragic if the Nation’s fallen veterans\nwere to be forgotten. See ibid. But there are countless different ways,\nconsistent with the Constitution, that such an outcome may be averted.\n16                   SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nring in judgment), respondent’s objection to the transfer\neasily meets that test for two reasons. First, he is cur­\nrently challenging official legislation, taken in response to\nan identified Establishment Clause violation. That legis­\nlation would transfer public land to a particular private\nparty, with the proviso that the transferee must use the\nland to fulfill a specific public function or else the land\nreverts back to the Government. Second, even once the\ntransfer is complete, the cross would remain a national\nmemorial. The cross is therefore not a purely “private”\nobject in any meaningful sense.\n   Notwithstanding these facts, the plurality appears to\nconclude that the transfer might render the cross purely\nprivate speech. It relies in part on the plurality opinion in\nPinette for its suggestion that the reasonable observer\nstandard may not be apposite, and Pinette addressed a\nprivately owned cross displayed in a public forum. The\nPinette plurality would have rejected the idea that “a\nneutrally behaving government” can ever endorse “private\nreligious expression,” id., at 764, even if a reasonable\nobserver would perceive government endorsement, id., at\n768. But the Pinette plurality acknowledged that govern­\nment favoritism of private religious speech is unconstitu­\ntional, as when a government “giv[es] sectarian religious\nspeech preferential access to a forum close to the seat of\ngovernment (or anywhere else for that matter).” Id., at\n766. And in this case, the Government is not acting neu­\ntrally: The transfer statute and the government actions\npreceding it have all favored the cross.\n   Furthermore, even assuming (wrongly) that the cross\nwould be purely private speech after the transfer, and\neven assuming (quite implausibly) that the transfer stat­\nute is neutral with respect to the cross, it would still be\nappropriate for the District Court to apply the reasonable\nobserver standard. The majority of the Pinette Court\nrejected the per se rule proposed by the plurality. Instead,\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          17\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthe relevant standard provides that the Establishment\nClause is violated whenever “the State’s own actions . . . ,\nand their relationship to the private speech at issue, actu\nally convey a message of endorsement.” Id., at 777\n(O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg­\nment). Moreover, the Establishment Clause “imposes\naffirmative obligations that may require a State, in some\nsituations, to take steps to avoid being perceived as sup­\nporting or endorsing a private religious message.” Ibid. It\nis particularly appropriate in this context—when the issue\nis whether the transfer cures an already identified Estab­\nlishment Clause violation—for the District Court to con­\nsider whether the Government, by complying with §8121,\nwould have taken sufficient steps to avoid being perceived\nas endorsing the cross.\n   As I explained at the outset of this section, the answer\nto that inquiry is surely no. The reasonable observer “who\nknows all of the pertinent facts and circumstances sur­\nrounding the symbol and its placement,” ante, at 17, would\nperceive that the Government has endorsed the cross: It\nprohibited the use of federal funds to take down the cross,\ndesignated the cross as a national memorial, and engaged\nin “herculean efforts to preserve the Latin cross” following\nthe District Court’s initial injunction, Buono III, 364\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1182. Those efforts include a transfer\nstatute designed to keep the cross in place. Changing the\nownership status of the underlying land in the manner\nrequired by §8121 would not change the fact that the cross\nconveys a message of government endorsement of religion.\nPurpose in Enacting the Transfer Statute\n  Even setting aside that the effect of the post-transfer\ncross would still be to convey a message of government\nendorsement of religion, the District Court was correct to\nconclude that §8121 would not cure the Establishment\nClause violation because the very purpose of the transfer\n18                   SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nwas to preserve the display of the cross. That evident\npurpose maintains government endorsement of the cross.\nThe plurality does not really contest that this was Con­\ngress’ purpose, ante, at 11, so I need not review the evi­\ndence in great detail. Suffice it to say that the record\nprovides ample support. The land-transfer statute author­\nizes a conveyance to the particular recipient that has\nexpressed an intent to preserve the cross. See Brief for\nVeterans of Foreign Wars of the United States et al. as\nAmici Curiae 4 (transfer recipient “intends to maintain\nand preserve the Veterans Memorial”); id., at 7 (identify­\ning Veterans Memorial as the “cross and plaque”). And it\nconveys the particular land that has already been desig­\nnated “as a national memorial” commemorating the veter­\nans of World War I, §8121(a), 117 Stat. 1100, subject to a\nreversionary clause requiring that a memorial “commemo­\nrating United States participation in World War I and\nhonoring the American veterans of that war” be main­\ntained, §8121(e). If it does not categorically require the\nnew owner of the property to display the existing memo­\nrial meeting that description (the cross), see §8137, 115\nStat. 2278, the statute most certainly encourages this\nresult. Indeed, the Government concedes that Congress\nsought to “preserve a longstanding war memorial” at the\nsite, Brief for Petitioners 28 (emphasis added), and the\nonly memorial that could be “preserved” at Sunrise Rock is\nthe cross itself.\n   The plurality insists, however, that even assuming the\npurpose of the land transfer was to preserve the display of\nthe cross, enjoining the transfer was not necessarily ap­\npropriate. It contends the District Court failed to give\nadequate consideration to “the context in which the [land­\ntransfer] statute was enacted and the reasons for its pas­\nsage,” ante, at 11, and it directs the District Court’s atten­\ntion to three factors: the message intended by the private\ncitizens who first erected the cross, ibid.; the time the\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

The\nDistrict Court, in its enforcement decision, had no occasion\nto consider anew either the private message intended by\nthose who erected the cross or how long the cross had\nstood atop Sunrise Rock. Neither of these factors consti­\ntuted a novel or changed circumstance since the entry of\nthe 2002 injunction. Whatever message those who ini­\ntially erected the cross intended—and I think we have to\npresume it was a Christian one, at least in part, for the\nsimple reason that those who erected the cross chose to\ncommemorate American veterans in an explicitly Chris­\ntian manner—that historical fact did not change between\n2002 and 2005. I grant that the amount of time the cross\nhad stood on Sunrise Rock did change, from 68 years to 71\nyears, but no one can seriously maintain that “the histori­\ncal meaning that the cross had attained,” ante, at 12, was\nmaterially transformed in that 3-year increment.9\n——————\n  9 I also disagree with the plurality’s factual premise that “the cross\n\nand the cause it commemorated had become entwined in the public\nconsciousness” in a secular manner, ante, at 11–12. Although some\nmembers of the community knew that the cross had been originally\nerected as a war memorial, there is no support in the record for the idea\nthat members of the public “gathered regularly at Sunrise Rock to pay\ntheir respects,” ibid., to the fallen of World War I or any other veterans.\nThe study conducted by a National Park Service historian indicates\nthat a group of veterans gathered at the cross as early as 1935 for\nEaster sunrise services.

Norton, No. EDCV 01–216–RT (CD Cal., Mar. 13,\n2002), p. 20 (Exh. 7). But there is no evidence that gatherings were\never held for Armistice Day or Veterans Day. The study further reveals\nthat a local club organized social events for the community at the cross\nfrom 1950 to 1975 and that after a local veteran passed away in 1984,\nthe “memory and associations of the white cross . . . as a war memorial”\n20                        SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   This brings us to the final factor identified by the plural­\nity: Congress’ “policy of accommodation” for the cross.10 Of\ncourse, the District Court did consider Congress’ “policy”\nin the sense that it considered the result Congress was\ntrying to achieve with respect to the cross, i.e., to keep it in\nplace. See Buono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1182 (“[T]he\nproposed transfer of the subject property can only be\nviewed as an attempt to keep the Latin cross atop Sunrise\nRock without actually curing the continuing Establish­\nment Clause violation”). But I understand the plurality to\nbe faulting the District Court for failing to inquire into a\ndeeper level of motivation: If the purpose of the transfer\nwas to keep the cross in place, what was the purpose of\nkeeping the cross in place?\n   I do not see why it was incumbent upon the District\nCourt to examine this second-order purpose when deter­\nmining whether the transfer violated the 2002 injunction.\nAs discussed in Part II, supra, the injunction barred the\nGovernment from permitting the display of the cross,\nwhich fairly encompasses any act providing an opportu­\nnity for the cross’ display. It was entirely appropriate for\nthe District Court to characterize a transfer with the\npurpose of preserving the cross as an attempt to evade\nthat injunction, and to find that the Government’s purpose\nto preserve the cross maintains government endorsement\nof the cross.\n——————\nfaded but locals were “inspired . . . to reinstate the Easter sunrise\nservices” at the cross. Ibid.\n  10 Although the plurality uses the term “accommodation,” I do not\n\nread its opinion to suggest that Congress’ policy vis-à-vis the cross has\nanything to do with accommodating any individual’s religious practice.\nCf. County of Allegheny, 492 U. S., at 601, n. 51 (“Nor can the display of\nthe crèche be justified as an ‘accommodation’ of religion. . . . To be sure,\nprohibiting the display . . . deprives Christians of the satisfaction of\nseeing the government adopt their religious message as their own, but\nthis kind of government affiliation with particular religious messages is\nprecisely what the Establishment Clause precludes”).\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

But we are instead examining whether\naction taken with the purpose of preserving the display of\nthe cross cures or continues government endorsement. In\nmy view, that purpose continues the impermissible en­\ndorsement of—indeed, favoritism toward—the cross,\nregardless of why Congress chose to intervene as it did.\n   In any event, Congress’ second-order purpose does little\nfor the plurality’s position. Without relying on any legisla­\ntive history or findings—there are none—the plurality\nopines that Congress wanted to keep the cross in place in\norder to accommodate those who might view removal as\n“conveying disrespect for those the cross was seen as\nhonoring,” ante, at 12, and it suggests that this decision\nwas an acceptable method of “balanc[ing] opposing inter­\nests” because the cross “has complex meaning beyond the\nexpression of religious views,” ante, at 13. As I have al­\nready explained, the meaning of the cross (complex or\notherwise) is no longer before us, and the plurality’s reli­\nance on a “congressional statement of policy,” ibid., as\nnegating any government endorsement of religion finds no\nsupport in logic or precedent. The cross cannot take on a\nnonsectarian character by congressional (or judicial) fiat,\nand the plurality’s evaluation of Congress’ actions is di­\nvorced from the methodology prescribed by our doctrine.11\n——————\n  11 JUSTICE ALITO similarly affords great weight to Congress’ purported\n\ninterest in “avoiding the disturbing symbolism associated with the\ndestruction of the historic monument.” Ante, at 5 (opinion concurring\nin part and concurring in judgment).

See McCreary County v. American\nCivil Liberties Union of Ky., 545 U. S. 844, 862 (2005)\n(“The eyes that look to purpose belong to an objective\nobserver, one who takes account of the traditional external\nsigns that show up in the text, legislative history, and\nimplementation of the statute, or comparable official act”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). “[R]easonable ob­\nservers have reasonable memories, and our precedents\nsensibly forbid an observer ‘to turn a blind eye to the\ncontext in which [the] policy arose.’ ” Id., at 866 (quoting\nSanta Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe, 530 U. S. 290,\n315 (2000)). The plurality nowhere engages with how a\nreasonable observer would view Congress’ “policy of ac­\ncommodation” for this cross. Instead, the plurality insists\nthat deference is owed because of “Congress’s prerogative\nto balance opposing interests and its institutional compe­\ntence to do so.” Ante, at 13.\n   The proper remedy for an Establishment Clause viola­\ntion is a legal judgment, which is not the sort of issue for\nwhich Congress “ ‘has both wisdom and experience . . . that\n——————\nbeen adjudged in this case and is now beyond question, a plaintiff must\nbe afforded a complete remedy.

But it does not follow that the\ngovernment can decline to cure an Establishment Clause violation in\norder to avoid offense. It may be the case that taking down the symbol\nis not the only remedy. The proper remedy, like the determination of\nthe violation itself, is necessarily context specific, and even if it involves\nmoving the cross, it need not involve the “demolition” or “destruction” of\nthe cross, see ante, at 4, 5. Regardless, in this case the only question\nbefore us is whether this particular transfer provided a complete\nremedy. We have no way of knowing whether Congress’ motivation\nwas to minimize offense, but in any event that interest does not amelio­\nrate the remedial ineffectiveness of §8121.\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

All legislative\nacts are not fungible.\n   Furthermore, in the Establishment Clause context, we\ndo not accord any special deference to the legislature on\naccount of its generic advantages as a policymaking body,\nand the purpose test is not “satisfied so long as any secu­\nlar purpose for the government action is apparent,”\nMcCreary County, 545 U.

It is odd that the plurality\nignores all of these well-settled principles in exalting this\nparticular legislative determination.\n   A reasonable observer, considering the nature of this\nsymbol, the timing and the substance of Congress’ efforts,\nand the history of the Sunrise Rock site, could conclude\nthat Congress chose to preserve the cross primarily be­\ncause of its salience as a cross. Cf. McCreary County, 545\nU.

But no such conclusion is necessary to\nfind for respondent.12 The religious meaning of the cross\nwas settled by the 2002 judgment; the only question before\nus is whether the Government has sufficiently distanced\nitself from the cross to end government endorsement of it.\nAt the least, I stress again, a reasonable observer would\nconclude that the Government’s purpose in transferring\nthe underlying land did not sufficiently distance the Gov­\nernment from the cross.

I think a reasonable observer\ncould come to that conclusion, but my point is that so long as we agree\nthat Congress’ aim was to preserve the cross (which JUSTICE ALITO does\nnot dispute), Congress’ reason for preserving the cross does not matter.\nBut if we were debating whether Congress had a religious purpose in\npassing the transfer statute, I would contest the relevance of the vote\ncount to that inquiry, see ante, at 6, and particularly so in this case.\nOne cannot infer much of anything about the land-transfer provision\nfrom the fact that an appropriations bill passed by an overwhelming\nmajority.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

Because the transfer would perpetuate\nthe Establishment Clause violation at issue in the 2002\ninjunction, I further conclude that enjoining the transfer\nwas necessary to secure relief. Given the transfer stat­\nute’s fundamental inadequacy as a remedy, there was—\nand is—no need for the District Court to consider “less\ndrastic relief than complete invalidation of the . . . stat­\nute.” Ante, at 18. Allowing the transfer to go forward\nwould interfere with the District Court’s authority to\nenforce its judgment and deprive the District Court of the\nability to ensure a complete remedy. Nor could allowing\nthe transfer to go forward be made a complete remedy\nwith add-on measures, such as signs or fences indicating\nthe ownership of the land. Such measures would not\ncompletely end the government endorsement of this cross,\nas the land would have been transferred in a manner\nfavoring the cross and the cross would remain designated\nas a national memorial. Enjoining compliance with §8121\nwas therefore a proper exercise of the District Court’s\nauthority to enforce the 2002 judgment.\n                        *     *    *\n   Congressional action, taken after due deliberation, that\nhonors our fallen soldiers merits our highest respect. As\nfar as I can tell, however, it is unprecedented in the Na­\ntion’s history to designate a bare, unadorned cross as the\nnational war memorial for a particular group of veterans.\nNeither the Korean War Memorial, the Vietnam War\nMemorial, nor the World War II Memorial commemorates\nour veterans’ sacrifice in sectarian or predominantly reli­\ngious ways. Each of these impressive structures pays\n26                  SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nequal respect to all members of the Armed Forces who\nperished in the service of our Country in those conflicts.\nIn this case, by contrast, a sectarian symbol is the memo­\nrial. And because Congress has established no other\nnational monument to the veterans of the Great War, this\nsolitary cross in the middle of the desert is the national\nWorld War I memorial. The sequence of legislative deci­\nsions made to designate and preserve a solitary Latin\ncross at an isolated location in the desert as a memorial\nfor those who fought and died in World War I not only\nfailed to cure the Establishment Clause violation but also,\nin my view, resulted in a dramatically inadequate and\ninappropriate tribute.\n  I believe that most judges would find it to be a clear\nEstablishment Clause violation if Congress had simply\ndirected that a solitary Latin cross be erected on the Mall\nin the Nation’s Capital to serve as a World War I Memo­\nrial. Congress did not erect this cross, but it commanded\nthat the cross remain in place, and it gave the cross the\nimprimatur of Government. Transferring the land pursu­\nant to §8121 would perpetuate rather than cure that\nunambiguous endorsement of a sectarian message.\n  The Mojave Desert is a remote location, far from the\nseat of our Government. But the Government’s interest in\nhonoring all those who have rendered heroic public service\nregardless of creed, as well as its constitutional responsi­\nbility to avoid endorsement of a particular religious view,\nshould control wherever national memorials speak on\nbehalf of our entire country.\n  I respectfully dissent.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

Subsequently,\nGovernment authorities covered the cross with a plywood\nbox so that it could not be seen. Congress then enacted a\nstatute directing the Secretary of the Interior to convey to\na private entity approximately one acre of land upon\nwhich the cross stood, presumably so that the cross could\nbe displayed uncovered. The plaintiff, returning to the\nDistrict Court, asked that court to “ ‘hold that the transfer\nviolates the . . . injunction.’ ”   Buono v. Norton, 364\nF. Supp. 2d 1175, 1177 (CD Cal. 2005) (quoting plaintiff’s\nmotion). The court held that it did. Id., at 1182. And the\nquestion before us is whether the law permits the District\nCourt so to interpret its injunction.\n  To answer this question we need not address any sig\nnificant issue of Establishment Clause law. Because the\nGovernment has already lost the case, taken an appeal,\nand lost the appeal, we must take as a given the lower\ncourt’s resolution of the Establishment Clause question\nbefore the land transfer. That is to say, as the plurality\npoints out, ante, at 9, we must here assume that the origi\nnal display of the cross violated the Constitution because\n2                     SALAZAR v.

Norton, 212 F. Supp. 2d\n1202, 1216–1217 (CD Cal. 2002). See Travelers Indemnity\nCo. v. Bailey, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 14)\n(once orders become final on direct review, they are res\njudicata to the parties). For the same reason, we must\nhere assume that the plaintiff originally had standing to\nbring the lawsuit. Ante, at 7; see also ante, at 1 (SCALIA,\nJ., concurring in judgment); Travelers, supra, at ___ (slip\nop., at 14) (orders are no less preclusive when the collat\neral attack is jurisdictional). And, as the plurality also\npoints out, the plaintiff consequently has standing now to\nseek enforcement of the injunction. Ante, at 8–9; see also\nAllen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 763 (1984).\n   Moreover, we are not faced with the question whether\nchanged circumstances require modification of the injunc\ntion. The Government did not ask the District Court to\nmodify it. In fact, the Government did not ask the District\nCourt for any relief at all. Rather, it was the plaintiff who\nasked the District Court either (1) to “ ‘hold that the [land]\ntransfer violates the current injunction,’ ” or (2) to “ ‘modify\nthat injunction to prohibit the land transfer because it\nviolates the Establishment Clause.’ ” 364 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1177 (quoting plaintiff’s motion). The District Court did\nthe former, i.e., it interpreted the injunction as prohibiting\nthe Government from transferring the land for purposes of\ndisplaying the cross. And having granted the plaintiff’s\nrequest to enforce the injunction, it dismissed the plain\ntiff’s alternative request to modify the injunction as moot.\n   Thus, as I said at the outset, the only question before us\nis whether the law permits the District Court to hold that\nthe land transfer (presumably along with the subsequent\npublic display of the cross) falls within the scope of its\noriginal injunctive order, an order that says the Govern\nment must not “permi[t] the display of the Latin cross in\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

In my view the law authorizes the Dis\ntrict Court to do so.\n   The legal principles that answer the question presented\nare found not in the Constitution but in cases that concern\nthe law of injunctions. First, the law of injunctions grants\na district court considerable leeway to interpret the mean\ning and application of its own injunctive order. Members\nof this Court have written that the “construction given to”\nan “injunction by the issuing judge . . . is entitled to great\nweight.” Madsen v. Women’s Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S.\n753, 795 (1994) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment in part\nand dissenting in part). And the Courts of Appeals have\nconsistently held that district courts have considerable\ndiscretion in interpreting and applying their own injunc\ntive decrees. See, e.g., JTH Tax, Inc. v. H & R Block East\nern Tax Servs., Inc., 359 F. 3d 699, 705 (CA4 2004); Ala\nbama Nursing Home Assn v. Harris, 617 F. 2d 385, 388\n(CA5 1980). This principle is longstanding and well estab\nlished, as reflected in a prominent treatise writer’s sum\nmary of the case law: “The court granting the injunction is\nnecessarily invested with large discretion in enforcing\nobedience to its mandate, and . . . courts of appellate\npowers are exceedingly averse to interfering with the\nexercise of such judgment and discretion.” 2 J. High, Law\nof Injunctions §1458, pp. 1467–1468 (4th ed. 1905).\n   Second, a court should construe the scope of an injunc\ntion in light of its purpose and history, in other words,\n“what the decree was really designed to accomplish.”\nMayor of Vicksburg v. Henson, 231 U. S. 259, 273 (1913).\nCourts have long looked to “the objects for which the\n[injunctive] relief was granted, as well as the circum\nstances attending it,” in deciding whether an enjoined\nparty has complied with an injunction. 2 High, supra,\n§1446, at 1455, and n. 68 (citing cases); see also John B.\nStetson Co. v. Stephen L. Stetson Co., 128 F. 2d 981, 983\n4                     SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(CA2 1942). And they have long refused to “permit defen\ndants to evade responsibility for violating an injunction,\nby doing through subterfuge a thing which is not in terms\na violation, yet produces the same effect by accomplishing\nsubstantially that which they were enjoined from doing.”\nStodder v. Rosen Talking Mach. Co., 247 Mass. 60, 68, 141\nN. E. 569, 571 (1923).\n   These two principles adequately support the District\nCourt’s interpretation and application of the injunctive\nlanguage at issue here. As an initial matter, the plain text\nof the injunction is reasonably read to prohibit the trans\nfer. Right now, the cross is covered with a plywood box;\nafter the transfer, the box will be removed and the cross\nwill be displayed. The transfer thus “permits” the public\n“display” of the cross. Indeed, that is the statute’s\nobjective.\n   Consideration of the injunction’s purpose points in the\nsame direction. The injunction rested upon the District\nCourt’s determination that the display of the cross “con\nveys a message of endorsement of religion” to “a reason\nable observer” in violation of the Establishment Clause.\n212 F. Supp. 2d, at 1216–1217. (As I have said, for pre\nsent purposes we must assume that this is so.) The pur\npose of the injunction is to prevent the conveyance of such\na message to the reasonable observer.\n   With that purpose in mind, consider the following facts\nthat confronted the District Court when the plaintiff asked\nit to enforce the decree:\n\n    •\t The Government had designated the “white cross\n       . . . as well as a limited amount of adjoining [land]”\n       as a national memorial. Pub. L. 107–117, §8137(a),\n       115 Stat. 2278–2279.\n    •\t The new statute directed the transfer of the “prop\n       erty . . . designated . . . as a national memorial” to a\n       private entity with an interest in maintaining the\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

Pub. L. 108–87, §§8121(a) and\n      (b), 117 Stat. 1100.\n   •\t The transfer was made “subject to the condition\n      that the recipient maintain the conveyed property\n      as a memorial,” and the property reverts to the\n      United States if the Secretary determines that the\n      recipient has failed to do so. §8121(e), id., at 1100.\n   •\t After the transfer, the cross would sit on 1 acre of\n      privately owned land in a 1.6 million acre national\n      preserve, over 90% of which is federally owned.\n      212 F. Supp. 2d, at 1205.\n   •\t Congress had previously prevented the use of fed\n      eral funds to remove the cross from its present lo\n      cation. Pub. L. 107–248, §8065(b), 116 Stat. 1551;\n      Pub. L. 106–554, §133, 114 Stat. 2763A–230.\n\n  The District Court considered the facts before it through\nthe lens of the injunction’s original purpose. See 364\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1180 (explaining that the “[G]overnment’s\ncontinuing control over the Latin cross” and the involve\nment of private parties who “desir[e] its continued pres\nence in the Preserve,” “demonstrat[e]” that the transfer\nwould not end “the [G]overnment’s apparent endorsement\nof a particular religion”); id., at 1182 (considering the\nhistorical context of the transfer statute); see also Buono\nv. Kempthorne, 527 F. 3d 758, 783 (CA9 2008) (“carving\nout a tiny parcel of property in the midst of this vast Pre\nserve . . . will do nothing to minimize the impermissible\ngovernmental endorsement” perceived by the reasonable\nobserver). And it concluded that the land transfer would\nfrustrate that purpose. See 364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1182 (the\ntransfer would “keep the Latin cross atop Sunrise Rock\nwithout actually curing the continuing Establishment\n6                   SALAZAR v. BUONO\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nClause violation”); see also 527 F. 3d, at 783 (finding that\n“[n]othing in the present posture of the case alters . . .\nearlier conclusions” regarding what a reasonable observer\nwould perceive).      In my view, this is a reasonable\nconclusion.\n   The injunction forbids the Government to permit the\ndisplay of the cross on Sunrise Rock, and its basic purpose\nwas to prevent a reasonable observer from believing that\nthe Government had endorsed the cross. Under the cir\ncumstances presented to the District Court, the transfer\nwould have resulted in such a display and might well have\nconveyed such a message. Consequently, the District\nCourt’s decision that the land transfer violated the injunc\ntion as written and intended was not an abuse of discre\ntion. And that is what the Ninth Circuit properly held on\nappeal. What the Establishment Clause implications of\nthe changed circumstances may be is a matter not before\nus. Cf. Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U. S. 431, 442 (2004) (“If\nthe [enjoined defendant] establishes reason to modify the\ndecree, the court should make the necessary changes;\nwhere it has not done so, however, the decree should be\nenforced according to its terms”).\n   Because my conclusion rests primarily upon the law of\ninjunctions, because that law is fairly clear, and because\nwe cannot properly reach beyond that law to consider the\nunderlying Establishment Clause and standing questions,\nI can find no federal question of general significance in\nthis case. I believe we should not have granted the peti\ntion for certiorari. Having granted it, the Court should\nnow dismiss the writ as improvidently granted. Since the\nCourt has not done so, however, I believe that we should\nsimply affirm the Ninth Circuit’s judgment.\n   With respect, I dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145221/", "sha1": "047b9518e488b31d10b48ea0b5f6895d93a286ac", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2009-041", "time_retrieved": "2010-04-28T17:43:08"}
