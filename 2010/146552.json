Argued January 12, 2010—Decided May 17, 2010\nFederal law allows a district court to order the civil commitment of a\n  mentally ill, sexually dangerous federal prisoner beyond the date he\n  would otherwise be released. 18 U. S. C. §4248. The Government in\n  stituted civil-commitment proceedings under §4248 against respon\n  dents, each of whom moved to dismiss on the ground, inter alia, that,\n  in enacting the statute, Congress exceeded its powers under the Nec\n  essary and Proper Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 18. Agreeing,\n  the District Court granted dismissal, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed\n  on the legislative-power ground.\nHeld: The Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress authority suf\n ficient to enact §4248. Taken together, five considerations compel\n this conclusion. Pp. 5–22.\n    (1) The Clause grants Congress broad authority to pass laws in fur\n therance of its constitutionally enumerated powers. It makes clear\n that grants of specific federal legislative authority are accompanied\n by broad power to enact laws that are “convenient, or useful” or “con\n ducive” to the enumerated power’s “beneficial exercise,” e.g.,\n McCulloch v. Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1320585\"><a href=\"/opinion/1320585/mcculloch-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 413, 418, and that Congress\n can “legislate on that vast mass of incidental powers which must be\n involved in the constitution,” id., at 421. In determining whether the\n Clause authorizes a particular federal statute, there must be “means\n ends rationality” between the enacted statute and the source of fed\n eral power. Sabri v. United States, 541 U. S. 600, 605. The Constitu\n tion “addresse[s]” the “choice of means” “primarily . . . to the judg\n ment of Congress. If it can be seen that the means adopted are really\n calculated to attain the end, the degree of their necessity, the extent\n to which they conduce to the end, the closeness of the relationship be\n tween the means adopted and the end to be attained, are matters for\n2                   UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    congressional determination alone.” Burroughs v. United States, 290\n    U. S. 534, 547–548. Thus, although the Constitution nowhere grants\n    Congress express power to create federal crimes beyond those specifi\n    cally enumerated, to punish their violation, to imprison violators, to\n    provide appropriately for those imprisoned, or to maintain the secu\n    rity of those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected by the\n    federal imprisonment of others, Congress possesses broad authority\n    to do each of those things under the Clause. Pp. 5–9.\n       (2) Congress has long been involved in the delivery of mental\n    health care to federal prisoners, and has long provided for their civil\n    commitment. See, e.g., Act of Mar. 3, 1855, 10 Stat. 682; Insanity De\n    fense Reform Act of 1984, 18 U. S. C. §§4241–4247. A longstanding\n    history of related federal action does not demonstrate a statute’s con\n    stitutionality, see, e.g., Walz v. Tax Comm’n of City of New York, 397\n    U. S. 664, 678, but can be “helpful in reviewing the substance of a\n    congressional statutory scheme,” Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 21,\n    and, in particular, the reasonableness of the relation between the\n    new statute and pre-existing federal interests. Section 4248 differs\n    from earlier statutes in that it focuses directly upon persons who, due\n    to a mental illness, are sexually dangerous. Many of these individu\n    als, however, were likely already subject to civil commitment under\n    §4246, which, since 1949, has authorized the postsentence detention\n    of federal prisoners who suffer from a mental illness and who are\n    thereby dangerous (whether sexually or otherwise). The similarities\n    between §4246 and §4248 demonstrate that the latter is a modest\n    addition to a longstanding federal statutory framework. Pp. 9–14.\n       (3) There are sound reasons for §4248’s enactment. The Federal\n    Government, as custodian of its prisoners, has the constitutional\n    power to act in order to protect nearby (and other) communities from\n    the danger such prisoners may pose. Moreover, §4248 is “reasonably\n    adapted” to Congress’ power to act as a responsible federal custodian.\n    United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 121. Congress could have rea\n    sonably concluded that federal inmates who suffer from a mental ill\n    ness that causes them to “have serious difficulty in refraining from\n    sexually violent conduct,” §4247(a)(6), would pose an especially high\n    danger to the public if released. And Congress could also have rea\n    sonably concluded that a reasonable number of such individuals\n    would likely not be detained by the States if released from federal\n    custody. Congress’ desire to address these specific challenges, taken\n    together with its responsibilities as a federal custodian, supports the\n    conclusion that §4248 satisfies “review for means-end rationality,”\n    Sabri, supra, at 605. Pp. 14–16.\n       (4) Respondents’ contention that §4248 violates the Tenth Amend\n    ment because it invades the province of state sovereignty in an area\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  typically left to state control is rejected. That Amendment does not\n  “reserve to the States” those powers that are “delegated to the United\n  States by the Constitution,” including the powers delegated by the\n  Necessary and Proper Clause. See, e.g., New York v. United States,\n  505 U. S. 144, 159. And §4248 does not “invade” state sovereignty,\n  but rather requires accommodation of state interests: Among other\n  things, it directs the Attorney General to inform the States where the\n  federal prisoner “is domiciled or was tried” of his detention, §4248(d),\n  and gives either State the right, at any time, to assert its authority\n  over the individual, which will prompt the individual’s immediate\n  transfer to State custody, §4248(d)(1). In Greenwood v. United\n  States, 350 U. S. 366, 375–376, the Court rejected a similar challenge\n  to §4248’s predecessor, the 1949 statute described above. Because\n  the version of the statute at issue in Greenwood was less protective of\n  state interests than §4248, a fortiori, the current statute does not in\n  vade state interests. Pp. 16–18.\n    (5) Section 4248 is narrow in scope. The Court rejects respondents’\n  argument that, when legislating pursuant to the Necessary and\n  Proper Clause, Congress’ authority can be no more than one step re\n  moved from a specifically enumerated power. See, e.g., McCulloch,\n  supra, at 417. Nor will the Court’s holding today confer on Congress\n  a general “police power, which the Founders denied the National\n  Government and reposed in the States.” United States v. Morrison,\n  529 U. S. 598, 618. Section §4248 has been applied to only a small\n  fraction of federal prisoners, and its reach is limited to individuals al\n  ready “in the custody of the” Federal Government, §4248(a). Thus,\n  far from a “general police power,” §4248 is a reasonably adapted and\n  narrowly tailored means of pursuing the Government’s legitimate in\n  terest as a federal custodian in the responsible administration of its\n  prison system. See New York, supra, at 157. Pp. 18–22.\n    The Court does not reach or decide any claim that the statute or its\n  application denies equal protection, procedural or substantive due\n  process, or any other constitutional rights. Respondents are free to\n  pursue those claims on remand, and any others they have preserved.\n  P. 22.\n551 F. 3d 274, reversed and remanded.\n\n   BREYER, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

GRAYDON \n\n           EARL COMSTOCK, JR., ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [May 17, 2010]\n\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  A federal civil-commitment statute authorizes the De\npartment of Justice to detain a mentally ill, sexually\ndangerous federal prisoner beyond the date the prisoner\nwould otherwise be released. 18 U. S. C. §4248. We have\npreviously examined similar statutes enacted under state\nlaw to determine whether they violate the Due Process\nClause. See Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346, 356–358\n(1997); Kansas v. Crane, 534 U. S. 407 (2002). But this\ncase presents a different question. Here we ask whether\nthe Federal Government has the authority under Article I\nof the Constitution to enact this federal civil-commitment\nprogram or whether its doing so falls beyond the reach of a\ngovernment “of enumerated powers.” McCulloch v. Mary\nland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1320585\"><a href=\"/opinion/1320585/mcculloch-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 405 (1819). We conclude that the\nConstitution grants Congress the authority to enact §4248\nas “necessary and proper for carrying into Execution” the\npowers “vested by” the “Constitution in the Government of\nthe United States.” Art. I, §8, cl. 18.\n                            I\n  The federal statute before us allows a district court to\n2              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\norder the civil commitment of an individual who is cur\nrently “in the custody of the [Federal] Bureau of Prisons,”\n§4248, if that individual (1) has previously “engaged or\nattempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child\nmolestation,” (2) currently “suffers from a serious mental\nillness, abnormality, or disorder,” and (3) “as a result of”\nthat mental illness, abnormality, or disorder is “sexually\ndangerous to others,” in that “he would have serious diffi\nculty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child\nmolestation if released.” §§4247(a)(5)–(6).\n   In order to detain such a person, the Government (act\ning through the Department of Justice) must certify to a\nfederal district judge that the prisoner meets the condi\ntions just described, i.e., that he has engaged in sexually\nviolent activity or child molestation in the past and that\nhe suffers from a mental illness that makes him corre\nspondingly dangerous to others. §4248(a). When such a\ncertification is filed, the statute automatically stays the\nindividual’s release from prison, ibid., thereby giving the\nGovernment an opportunity to prove its claims at a hear\ning through psychiatric (or other) evidence, §§4247(b)–(c),\n4248(b). The statute provides that the prisoner “shall be\nrepresented by counsel” and shall have “an opportunity” at\nthe hearing “to testify, to present evidence, to subpoena\nwitnesses on his behalf, and to confront and cross\nexamine” the Government’s witnesses. §§4247(d), 4248(c).\n   If the Government proves its claims by “clear and con\nvincing evidence,” the court will order the prisoner’s con\ntinued commitment in “the custody of the Attorney Gen\neral,” who must “make all reasonable efforts to cause” the\nState where that person was tried, or the State where he\nis domiciled, to “assume responsibility for his custody,\ncare, and treatment.” §4248(d); cf. Sullivan v. Freeman,\n944 F. 2d 334, 337 (CA7 1991). If either State is willing to\nassume that responsibility, the Attorney General “shall\nrelease” the individual “to the appropriate official” of that\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nState. §4248(d). But if, “notwithstanding such efforts,\nneither such State will assume such responsibility,” then\n“the Attorney General shall place the person for treatment\nin a suitable [federal] facility.” Ibid.; cf. §4247(i)(A).\n   Confinement in the federal facility will last until either\n(1) the person’s mental condition improves to the point\nwhere he is no longer dangerous (with or without appro\npriate ongoing treatment), in which case he will be re\nleased; or (2) a State assumes responsibility for his cus\ntody, care, and treatment, in which case he will be\ntransferred to the custody of that State. §§4248(d)(1)–(2).\nThe statute establishes a system for ongoing psychiatric\nand judicial review of the individual’s case, including\njudicial hearings at the request of the confined person at\nsix-month intervals. §§4247(e)(1)(B), (h).\n   In November and December 2006, the Government\ninstituted proceedings in the Federal District Court for the\nEastern District of North Carolina against the five re\nspondents in this case. Three of the five had previously\npleaded guilty in federal court to possession of child por\nnography, see </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2251930\"><a href=\"/opinion/2251930/united-states-v-comstock/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Vigil, No.\n1:99CR00509–001 (D NM, Jan. 26, 2000); §§1153, 2243(a).\nWith respect to each of them, the Government claimed\nthat the respondent was about to be released from federal\nprison, that he had engaged in sexually violent conduct or\nchild molestation in the past, and that he suffered from a\nmental illness that made him sexually dangerous to oth\ners. App. 38–40, 44–52. During that same time period,\nthe Government instituted similar proceedings against the\nfifth respondent, who had been charged in federal court\nwith aggravated sexual abuse of a minor, but was found\nmentally incompetent to stand trial. See id., at 41–43;\nUnited States v. Catron, No. 04–778 (D Ariz., Mar. 27,\n2006); §4241(d).\n4              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Each of the five respondents moved to dismiss the civil\ncommitment proceeding on constitutional grounds. They\nclaimed that the commitment proceeding is, in fact, crimi\nnal, not civil, in nature and consequently that it violates\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause, the Ex Post Facto Clause,\nand the Sixth and Eighth Amendments. 507 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 528. They claimed that the statute denies them sub\nstantive due process and equal protection of the laws.\nIbid. They claimed that it violates their procedural due\nprocess rights by allowing a showing of sexual dangerous\nness to be made by clear and convincing evidence, instead\nof by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Ibid. And, finally,\nthey claimed that, in enacting the statute, Congress ex\nceeded the powers granted to it by Art. I, §8 of the Consti\ntution, including those granted by the Commerce Clause\nand the Necessary and Proper Clause. 507 F. Supp. 2d, at\n528–529.\n   The District Court, accepting two of the respondents’\nclaims, granted their motion to dismiss. It agreed with\nrespondents that the Constitution requires proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt, id., at 551–559 (citing In re Winship,\n397 U. S. 358 (1970)), and it agreed that, in enacting the\nstatute, Congress exceeded its Article I legislative powers,\n507 F. Supp. 2d, at 530–551. On appeal, the Court of\nAppeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the dismissal on\nthis latter, legislative-power ground. 551 F. 3d 274, 278–\n284 (2009). It did not decide the standard-of-proof ques\ntion, nor did it address any of respondents’ other constitu\ntional challenges. Id., at 276, n. 1.\n   The Government sought certiorari, and we granted its\nrequest, limited to the question of Congress’ authority\nunder Art. I, §8 of the Constitution. Pet. for Cert. i. Since\nthen, two other Courts of Appeals have considered that\nsame question, each deciding it in the Government’s favor,\nthereby creating a split of authority among the Circuits.\nSee United States v. Volungus, 595 F. 3d 1 (CA1 2010);\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nUnited States v. Tom, 565 F. 3d 497 (CA8 2009).\n                               II\n   The question presented is whether the Necessary and\nProper Clause, Art. I, §8, cl. 18, grants Congress authority\nsufficient to enact the statute before us. In resolving that\nquestion, we assume, but we do not decide, that other\nprovisions of the Constitution—such as the Due Process\nClause—do not prohibit civil commitment in these circum\nstances. Cf. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346; Addington v. Texas,\n441 U. S. 418 (1979). In other words, we assume for ar\ngument’s sake that the Federal Constitution would permit\na State to enact this statute, and we ask solely whether\nthe Federal Government, exercising its enumerated pow\ners, may enact such a statute as well. On that assump\ntion, we conclude that the Constitution grants Congress\nlegislative power sufficient to enact §4248. We base this\nconclusion on five considerations, taken together.\n   First, the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress\nbroad authority to enact federal legislation. Nearly 200\nyears ago, this Court stated that the Federal “[G]overn\nment is acknowledged by all to be one of enumerated\npowers,” McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 405, which means that\n“[e]very law enacted by Congress must be based on one or\nmore of” those powers, United States v. Morrison, 529\nU. S. 598, 607 (2000). But, at the same time, “a govern\nment, entrusted with such” powers “must also be en\ntrusted with ample means for their execution.”\nMcCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 408. Accordingly, the Necessary\nand Proper Clause makes clear that the Constitution’s\ngrants of specific federal legislative authority are accom\npanied by broad power to enact laws that are “convenient,\nor useful” or “conducive” to the authority’s “beneficial\nexercise.” Id., at 413, 418; see also id., at 421 (“[Congress\ncan] legislate on that vast mass of incidental powers which\nmust be involved in the constitution . . .”). Chief Justice\n6              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMarshall emphasized that the word “necessary” does not\nmean “absolutely necessary.” Id., at 413–415 (emphasis\ndeleted); Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U. S. 456, 462\n(2003) (“[W]e long ago rejected the view that the Neces\nsary and Proper Clause demands that an Act of Congress\nbe ‘ “absolutely necessary” ’ to the exercise of an enumer\nated power”). In language that has come to define the\nscope of the Necessary and Proper Clause, he wrote:\n    “Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of\n    the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,\n    which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not\n    prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the\n    constitution, are constitutional.” McCulloch, supra, at\n    421.\n   We have since made clear that, in determining whether\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress the\nlegislative authority to enact a particular federal statute,\nwe look to see whether the statute constitutes a means\nthat is rationally related to the implementation of a con\nstitutionally enumerated power. Sabri v. United States,\n541 U. S. 600, 605 (2004) (using term “means-ends ration\nality” to describe the necessary relationship); ibid. (up\nholding Congress’ “authority under the Necessary and\nProper Clause” to enact a criminal statute in furtherance\nof the federal power granted by the Spending Clause); see\nGonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 22 (2005) (holding that\nbecause “Congress had a rational basis” for concluding\nthat a statute implements Commerce Clause power, the\nstatute falls within the scope of congressional “authority to\n‘make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper’ to\n‘regulate Commerce . . . among the several States’ ” (ellip\nsis in original)); see also United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S.\n549, 557 (1995); Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Rec\nlamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 276 (1981).\n   Of course, as Chief Justice Marshall stated, a federal\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)              7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute, in addition to being authorized by Art. I, §8, must\nalso “not [be] prohibited” by the Constitution. McCulloch,\nsupra, at 421. But as we have already stated, the present\nstatute’s validity under provisions of the Constitution\nother than the Necessary and Proper Clause is an issue\nthat is not before us. Under the question presented, the\nrelevant inquiry is simply “whether the means chosen are\n‘reasonably adapted’ to the attainment of a legitimate end\nunder the commerce power” or under other powers that\nthe Constitution grants Congress the authority to imple\nment. Gonzales, supra, at 37 (SCALIA, J., concurring in\njudgment) (quoting United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100,\n121 (1941)).\n   We have also recognized that the Constitution “ad\ndresse[s]” the “choice of means”\n    “primarily . . . to the judgment of Congress. If it can\n    be seen that the means adopted are really calculated\n    to attain the end, the degree of their necessity, the ex\n    tent to which they conduce to the end, the closeness of\n    the relationship between the means adopted and the\n    end to be attained, are matters for congressional de\n    termination alone.” Burroughs v. United States, 290\n    U. S. 534, 547–548 (1934).\nSee also Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 355 (1903) (“[T]he\nConstitution . . . . leaves to Congress a large discretion as\nto the means that may be employed in executing a given\npower”); Morrison, supra, at 607 (applying a “presumption\nof constitutionality” when examining the scope of Con\ngressional power); McCulloch, supra, at 410, 421.\n   Thus, the Constitution, which nowhere speaks explicitly\nabout the creation of federal crimes beyond those related\nto “counterfeiting,” “treason,” or “Piracies and Felonies\ncommitted on the high Seas” or “against the Law of Na\ntions,” Art. I, §8, cls. 6, 10; Art. III, §3, nonetheless grants\nCongress broad authority to create such crimes. See\n8               UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nMcCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 416 (“All admit that the govern\nment may, legitimately, punish any violation of its laws;\nand yet, this is not among the enumerated powers of\nCongress”); see also United States v. Fox, 95 U. S. 670, 672\n(1878). And Congress routinely exercises its authority to\nenact criminal laws in furtherance of, for example, its\nenumerated powers to regulate interstate and foreign\ncommerce, to enforce civil rights, to spend funds for the\ngeneral welfare, to establish federal courts, to establish\npost offices, to regulate bankruptcy, to regulate naturali\nzation, and so forth. Art. I, §8, cls. 1, 3, 4, 7, 9; Amdts. 13–\n15. See, e.g., Lottery Case, supra (upholding criminal\nstatute enacted in furtherance of the Commerce Clause);\nEx parte Yarbrough, 110 U. S. 651 (1884) (upholding\nCongress’ authority to enact Rev. Stat. §5508, currently 18\nU. S. C. §241 (criminalizing civil-rights violations) and\nRev. Stat. §5520, currently 42 U. S.

S. C.\n§1691 et seq. (postal crimes); §151 et seq. (bankruptcy\ncrimes); 8 U. S. C. §§1324–1328 (immigration crimes).\n   Similarly, Congress, in order to help ensure the en\nforcement of federal criminal laws enacted in furtherance\nof its enumerated powers, “can cause a prison to be erected\nat any place within the jurisdiction of the United States,\nand direct that all persons sentenced to imprisonment\nunder the laws of the United States shall be confined\nthere.” Ex parte Karstendick, 93 U. S. 396, 400 (1876).\nMoreover, Congress, having established a prison system,\ncan enact laws that seek to ensure that system’s safe and\nresponsible administration by, for example, requiring\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprisoners to receive medical care and educational training,\nsee, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §§4005–4006; §4042(a)(3), and can\nalso ensure the safety of the prisoners, prison workers and\nvisitors, and those in surrounding communities by, for\nexample, creating further criminal laws governing entry,\nexit, and smuggling, and by employing prison guards to\nensure discipline and security. See, e.g., §1791 (prohibit\ning smuggling contraband); §751 et seq. (prohibiting es\ncape and abetting thereof); 28 CFR §541.10 et seq. (2009)\n(inmate discipline).\n   Neither Congress’ power to criminalize conduct, nor its\npower to imprison individuals who engage in that conduct,\nnor its power to enact laws governing prisons and prison\ners, is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. But Con\ngress nonetheless possesses broad authority to do each of\nthose things in the course of “carrying into Execution” the\nenumerated powers “vested by” the “Constitution in the\nGovernment of the United States,” Art. I, §8, cl. 18—\nauthority granted by the Necessary and Proper Clause.\n   Second, the civil-commitment statute before us consti\ntutes a modest addition to a set of federal prison-related\nmental-health statutes that have existed for many dec\nades. We recognize that even a longstanding history of\nrelated federal action does not demonstrate a statute’s\nconstitutionality. See, e.g., Walz v. Tax Comm’n of City of\nNew York, 397 U. S. 664, 678 (1970) (“[N]o one acquires a\nvested or protected right in violation of the Constitution by\nlong use . . .”); cf. Morrison, 529 U. S., at 612–614 (legisla\ntive history is neither necessary nor sufficient with respect\nto Art. I analysis). A history of involvement, however, can\nnonetheless be “helpful in reviewing the substance of a\ncongressional statutory scheme,” Gonzales, 545 U. S., at\n21; Walz, supra, at 678, and, in particular, the reason\nableness of the relation between the new statute and pre\nexisting federal interests.\n   Here, Congress has long been involved in the delivery of\n10              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmental health care to federal prisoners, and has long\nprovided for their civil commitment. In 1855 it estab\nlished Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital in the District of Colum\nbia to provide treatment to “the insane of the army and\nnavy . . . and of the District of Columbia.” Act of Mar. 3,\n1855, 10 Stat. 682; 39 Stat. 309. In 1857 it provided for\nconfinement at Saint Elizabeth’s of any person within the\nDistrict of Columbia who had been “charged with [a]\ncrime” and who was “insane” or later became “insane\nduring the continuance of his or her sentence in the\nUnited States penitentiary.” Act of Feb. 7, 1857, §§5–6, 11\nStat. 158; see 17 Op. Atty. Gen. 211, 212–213 (1881). In\n1874, expanding the geographic scope of its statutes,\nCongress provided for civil commitment in federal facili\nties (or in state facilities if a State so agreed) of “all per\nsons who have been or shall be convicted of any offense in\nany court of the United States” and who are or “shall\nbecome” insane “during the term of their imprisonment.”\nAct of June 23, 1874, ch. 465, 18 Stat. 251 (emphasis\nadded). And in 1882 Congress provided for similar com\nmitment of those “charged” with federal offenses who\nbecome “insane” while in the “custody” of the United\nStates. Act of Aug. 7, 1882, 22 Stat. 330 (emphasis\nadded). Thus, over the span of three decades, Congress\ncreated a national, federal civil-commitment program\nunder which any person who was either charged with or\nconvicted of any federal offense in any federal court could\nbe confined in a federal mental institution.\n   These statutes did not raise the question presented\nhere, for they all provided that commitment in a federal\nhospital would end upon the completion of the relevant\n“terms” of federal “imprisonment” as set forth in the un\nderlying criminal sentence or statute. §§2–3, 18 Stat. 252;\nsee 35 Op. Atty. Gen. 366, 368 (1927); cf. 30 Op. Atty. Gen.\n569, 571 (1916). But in the mid-1940’s that proviso was\neliminated.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  In 1945 the Judicial Conference of the United States\nproposed legislative reforms of the federal civil\ncommitment system. The Judicial Conference based its\nproposals upon what this Court has described as a “long\nstudy by a conspicuously able committee” (chaired by\nJudge Calvert Magruder and whose members included\nJudge Learned Hand), involving consultation “with federal\ndistrict and circuit judges” across the country as well as\nwith the Department of Justice. Greenwood v. United\nStates, 350 U. S. 366, 373 (1956); Greenwood v. United\nStates, 219 F. 2d 376, 380–384 (CA8 1955) (describing the\ncommittee’s work). The committee studied, among other\nthings, the “serious problem faced by the Bureau of Pris\nons, namely, what to do with insane criminals upon the\nexpiration of their terms of confinement, where it would be\ndangerous to turn them loose upon society and where no\nstate will assume responsibility for their custody.” Judi\ncial Conference, Report of Committee to Study Treatment\nAccorded by Federal Courts to Insane Persons Charged\nwith Crime 11 (1945) (hereinafter Committee Report),\nApp. 73. The committee provided examples of instances in\nwhich the Bureau of Prisons had struggled with the prob\nlem of “ ‘paranoid’ ” and “ ‘threatening’ ” individuals whom\nno State would accept. Id., at 9, App. 71. And it noted\nthat, in the Bureau’s “[e]xperience,” States would not\naccept an “appreciable number” of “mental[ly] incompe\ntent” individuals “nearing expiration” of their prison\nterms, because of their “lack of legal residence in any\nState,” even though those individuals “ought not . . . be at\nlarge because they constitute a menace to public safety.”\nH. R. Rep. No. 1319, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1949) (state\nment of James V. Bennett, Director); see also Letter from\nBennett to Judge Magruder, attachment to Committee\nReport, App. 83–88. The committee, hence the Judicial\nConference, therefore recommended that Congress enact\n“some provision of law authorizing the continued confine\n12               UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nment of such persons after their sentences expired.”\nCommittee Report 11, App. 73; see also Report of the\nJudicial Conference of Senior Circuit Judges 13 (1945).\n  Between 1948 and 1949, following its receipt of the\nJudicial Conference report, Congress modified the law.\nSee Act of June 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 855, 18 U. S. C. §§4241–\n4243 (1952 ed.); Act of Sept. 7, 1949, 63 Stat. 686, 18\nU. S. C. §§4244–4248. It provided for the civil commit\nment of individuals who are, or who become, mentally\nincompetent at any time after their arrest and before the\nexpiration of their federal sentence, §§4241, 4244, 4247–\n4248; and it set forth various procedural safeguards,\n§§4242, 4246, 4247. With respect to an individual whose\nprison term is about to expire, it specified the following:\n        “Whenever the Director of the Bureau of Prisons\n     shall certify that a prisoner whose sentence is about to\n     expire has been examined [and] . . . in the judgment of\n     the Director and the board of examiners the prisoner\n     is insane or mentally incompetent, and . . . if released\n     he will probably endanger the safety of the officers,\n     the property, or other interests of the United States,\n     and that suitable arrangements for the custody and\n     care of the prisoner are not otherwise available, the\n     Attorney General shall transmit the certificate to . . .\n     the court for the district in which the prisoner is con\n     fined. Whereupon the court shall cause the prisoner\n     to be examined . . . and shall . . . hold a hearing . . . . If\n     upon such hearing the court shall determine that the\n     conditions specified above exist, the court may commit\n     the prisoner to the custody of the Attorney General or\n     his authorized representative.” §4247.\nThe precondition that the mentally ill individual’s release\nwould “probably endanger the safety of the officers, the\nproperty, or other interests of the United States” was\nuniformly interpreted by the Judiciary to mean that his\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“release would endanger the safety of persons, property or\nthe public interest in general—not merely the interests\npeculiar to the United States as such.” United States v.\nCurry, 410 F. 2d 1372, 1374 (CA4 1969); see also Royal v.\nUnited States, 274 F. 2d 846, 851–852 (CA10 1960).\n  In 1984, Congress modified these basic statutes. See\nInsanity Defense Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 2057, 18\nU. S. C. §§4241–4247 (2006 ed.). As relevant here, it\naltered the provision just discussed, regarding the pris\noner’s danger to the “interests of the United States,” to\nconform more closely to the then-existing judicial interpre\ntation of that language, i.e., it altered the language so as\nto authorize (explicitly) civil commitment if, in addition to\nthe other conditions, the prisoner’s “release would create a\nsubstantial risk of bodily injury to another person or\nserious damage to the property of another.” §4246(d).\n  Congress also elaborated upon the required condition\n“that suitable arrangements . . . are not otherwise avail\nable” by directing the Attorney General to seek alternative\nplacement in state facilities, as we have set forth above.\nSee ibid.; supra, at 2–3. With these modifications, the\nstatutes continue to authorize the civil commitment of\nindividuals who are both mentally ill and dangerous, once\nthey have been charged with, or convicted of, a federal\ncrime. §§4241(d), 4246; see also §4243(d). They continue\nto provide for the continued civil commitment of those\nindividuals when they are “due for release” from federal\ncustody because their “sentence is about to expire.” §4246.\nAnd, as we have previously set forth, they establish vari\nous procedural and other requirements. E.g., §4247.\n  In 2006, Congress enacted the particular statute before\nus. §302, 120 Stat. 619, 18 U. S. C. §4248. It differs from\nearlier statutes in that it focuses directly upon persons\nwho, due to a mental illness, are sexually dangerous.\nNotably, many of these individuals were likely already\nsubject to civil commitment under §4246, which, since\n14             UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n1949, has authorized the postsentence detention of federal\nprisoners who suffer from a mental illness and who are\nthereby dangerous (whether sexually or otherwise). But\ncf. H. R. Rep. No. 109–218, pt. 1, p. 29 (2005). Aside from\nits specific focus on sexually dangerous persons, §4248 is\nsimilar to the provisions first enacted in 1949. Cf. §4246.\nIn that respect, it is a modest addition to a longstanding\nfederal statutory framework, which has been in place\nsince 1855.\n   Third, Congress reasonably extended its longstanding\ncivil-commitment system to cover mentally ill and sexually\ndangerous persons who are already in federal custody,\neven if doing so detains them beyond the termination of\ntheir criminal sentence. For one thing, the Federal Gov\nernment is the custodian of its prisoners. As federal cus\ntodian, it has the constitutional power to act in order to\nprotect nearby (and other) communities from the danger\nfederal prisoners may pose. Cf. Youngberg v. Romeo, 457\nU. S. 307, 320 (1982) (“In operating an institution such as\n[a prison system], there are occasions in which it is neces\nsary for the State to restrain the movement of residents—\nfor example, to protect them as well as others from vio\nlence” (emphasis added)). Indeed, at common law, one\n“who takes charge of a third person” is “under a duty to\nexercise reasonable care to control” that person to prevent\nhim from causing reasonably foreseeable “bodily harm to\nothers.”    Restatement (Second) of Torts §319, p. 129\n(1963–1964); see Volungus, 595 F. 3d, at 7–8 (citing cases);\nsee also United States v. S. A., 129 F. 3d 995, 999 (CA8\n1997) (“[Congress enacted §4246] to avert the public dan\nger likely to ensue from the release of mentally ill and\ndangerous detainees”). If a federal prisoner is infected\nwith a communicable disease that threatens others, surely\nit would be “necessary and proper” for the Federal Gov\nernment to take action, pursuant to its role as federal\ncustodian, to refuse (at least until the threat diminishes)\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto release that individual among the general public, where\nhe might infect others (even if not threatening an inter\nstate epidemic, cf. Art. I, §8, cl. 3). And if confinement of\nsuch an individual is a “necessary and proper” thing to do,\nthen how could it not be similarly “necessary and proper”\nto confine an individual whose mental illness threatens\nothers to the same degree?\n   Moreover, §4248 is “reasonably adapted,” Darby, 312\nU. S., at 121, to Congress’ power to act as a responsible\nfederal custodian (a power that rests, in turn, upon federal\ncriminal statutes that legitimately seek to implement\nconstitutionally enumerated authority, see supra, at 7–8).\nCongress could have reasonably concluded that federal\ninmates who suffer from a mental illness that causes them\nto “have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually\nviolent conduct,” §4247(a)(6), would pose an especially\nhigh danger to the public if released. Cf. H. R. Rep. No.\n109–218, at 22–23. And Congress could also have rea\nsonably concluded (as detailed in the Judicial Conference’s\nreport) that a reasonable number of such individuals\nwould likely not be detained by the States if released from\nfederal custody, in part because the Federal Government\nitself severed their claim to “legal residence in any State”\nby incarcerating them in remote federal prisons. H. R.\nRep. No. 1319, at 2; Committee Report 7–11, App. 69–75;\ncf. post, at 6 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment). Here\nCongress’ desire to address the specific challenges identi\nfied in the Reports cited above, taken together with its\nresponsibilities as a federal custodian, supports the con\nclusion that §4248 satisfies “review for means-end ration\nality,” i.e., that it satisfies the Constitution’s insistence\nthat a federal statute represent a rational means for im\nplementing a constitutional grant of legislative authority.\nSabri, 541 U. S., at 605 (citing McCulloch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1320585\"><a href=\"/opinion/1320585/mcculloch-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">).\nSee Jinks, 538 U. S., at 462–463 (opinion for the Court by\nSCALIA, J.) (holding that a statute is authorized by the\n16              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nNecessary and Proper Clause when it “provides an alter\nnative to [otherwise] unsatisfactory options” that are\n“obviously inefficient”).\n   Fourth, the statute properly accounts for state interests.\nRespondents and the dissent contend that §4248 violates\nthe Tenth Amendment because it “invades the province of\nstate sovereignty” in an area typically left to state control.\nNew York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 155 (1992); see\nBrief for Respondents 35–47; post, at 7–8, 19–23 (THOMAS,\nJ., dissenting). See also Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U. S. 715,\n736 (1972) (“The States have traditionally exercised broad\npower to commit persons found to be mentally ill”). But\nthe Tenth Amendment’s text is clear: “The powers not\ndelegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor\nprohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States\nrespectively, or to the people.” (Emphasis added.) The\npowers “delegated to the United States by the Constitu\ntion” include those specifically enumerated powers listed\nin Article I along with the implementation authority\ngranted by the Necessary and Proper Clause. Virtually by\ndefinition, these powers are not powers that the Constitu\ntion “reserved to the States.” See New York, supra, at 156,\n159 (“[I]f a power is delegated to Congress in the Constitu\ntion, the Tenth Amendment expressly disclaims any res\nervation of that power to the States . . . .” “In the end . . .\nit makes no difference whether one views the question at\nissue in these cases as one of ascertaining the limits of the\npower delegated to the Federal Government under the\naffirmative provisions of the Constitution or one of dis\ncerning the core of sovereignty retained by the States\nunder the Tenth Amendment”); Darby, supra, at 123–124;\nsee also Hodel, 452 U. S., at 276–277, 281; Maryland v.\nWirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 195–196 (1968); Lambert v. Yellow\nley, 272 U. S. 581, 596 (1926).\n   Nor does this statute invade state sovereignty or other\nwise improperly limit the scope of “powers that remain\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwith the States.” Post, at 7 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). To\nthe contrary, it requires accommodation of state interests:\nThe Attorney General must inform the State in which the\nfederal prisoner “is domiciled or was tried” that he is\ndetaining someone with respect to whom those States may\nwish to assert their authority, and he must encourage\nthose States to assume custody of the individual.\n§4248(d). He must also immediately “release” that person\n“to the appropriate official of” either State “if such State\nwill assume [such] responsibility.” Ibid. And either State\nhas the right, at any time, to assert its authority over the\nindividual, which will prompt the individual’s immediate\ntransfer to State custody. §4248(d)(1). Respondents con\ntend that the States are nonetheless “powerless to prevent\nthe detention of their citizens under §4248, even if deten\ntion is contrary to the States’ policy choices.” Brief for\nRespondents 11 (emphasis added). But that is not the\nmost natural reading of the statute, see §§4248(d)(1)–(e),\nand the Solicitor General acknowledges that “the Federal\nGovernment would have no appropriate role” with respect\nto an individual covered by the statute once “the transfer\nto State responsibility and State control has occurred.” Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 9.\n   In Greenwood, 350 U. S. 366, the Court rejected a chal\nlenge to the current statute’s predecessor—i.e., to the 1949\nstatute we described above, supra, at 11–12. The petition\ners in that case claimed, like the respondents here, that\nthe statute improperly interfered with state sovereignty.\nSee Brief for Petitioner in Greenwood v. United States,\nO. T. 1955, No. 460, pp. 2, 18–29. But the Court rejected\nthat argument. See Greenwood, supra, at 375–376. And\nthe version of the statute at issue in Greenwood was less\nprotective of state interests than the current statute. That\nstatute authorized federal custody so long as “suitable\narrangements” were “not otherwise available” in a State or\notherwise. 63 Stat. 687 (emphasis added). Cf. Brief for\n18              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nPetitioner in Greenwood, supra, at 25 (“What has really\nhappened is that the Federal government has been dissat\nisfied with the care given by the states to those mentally\nincompetent who have been released by the Federal au\nthorities”). Here, by contrast, as we have explained, §4248\nrequires the Attorney General to encourage the relevant\nStates to take custody of the individual without inquiring\ninto the “suitability” of their intended care or treatment,\nand to relinquish federal authority whenever a State\nasserts its own. §4248(d). Thus, if the statute at issue in\nGreenwood did not invade state interests, then, a fortiori,\nneither does §4248.\n   Fifth, the links between §4248 and an enumerated\nArticle I power are not too attenuated. Neither is the\nstatutory provision too sweeping in its scope. Invoking the\ncautionary instruction that we may not “pile inference\nupon inference” in order to sustain congressional action\nunder Article I, Lopez, 514 U. S., at 567, respondents\nargue that, when legislating pursuant to the Necessary\nand Proper Clause, Congress’ authority can be no more\nthan one step removed from a specifically enumerated\npower. See Brief for Respondents 21–22; Tr. of Oral Arg.\n27–28. But this argument is irreconcilable with our prece\ndents. Again, take Greenwood as an example. In that\ncase we upheld the (likely indefinite) civil commitment of\na mentally incompetent federal defendant who was ac\ncused of robbing a United States Post Office. 350 U. S., at\n369, 375. The underlying enumerated Article I power was\nthe power to “Establish Post Offices and Post Roads.”\nArt. I, §8, cl. 7. But, as Chief Justice Marshall recognized\nin McCulloch,\n     “the power ‘to establish post offices and post roads’\n     . . . is executed by the single act of making the estab\n     lishment. . . . [F]rom this has been inferred the power\n     and duty of carrying the mail along the post road,\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    from one post office to another.          And, from\n    this implied power, has again been inferred the right\n    to punish those who steal letters from the post office,\n    or rob the mail.” 4 Wheat., at 417 (emphasis added).\nAnd, as we have explained, from the implied power to\npunish we have further inferred both the power to im\nprison, see supra, at 8–9, and, in Greenwood, the federal\ncivil-commitment power.\n   Our necessary and proper jurisprudence contains multi\nple examples of similar reasoning. For example, in Sabri\nwe observed that “Congress has authority under the\nSpending Clause to appropriate federal moneys” and that\nit therefore “has corresponding authority under the Neces\nsary and Proper Clause to see to it that taxpayer dollars”\nare not “siphoned off” by “corrupt public officers.” 541\nU. S., at 605 (citation omitted). We then further held that,\nin aid of that implied power to criminalize graft of “tax\npayer dollars,” Congress has the additional prophylactic\npower to criminalize bribes or kickbacks even when the\nstolen funds have not been “traceably skimmed from\nspecific federal payments.” Ibid. Similarly, in United\nStates v. Hall, 98 U. S. 343 (1879), we held that the Neces\nsary and Proper Clause grants Congress the power, in\nfurtherance of Art. I, §8, cls. 11–13, to award “pensions to\nthe wounded and disabled” soldiers of the armed forces\nand their dependents, 98 U. S. at 351; and from that im\nplied power we further inferred the “[i]mplied power” “to\npass laws to . . . punish” anyone who fraudulently appro\npriated such pensions, id., at 346.

Of course, each of those\npowers, like the powers addressed in Sabri, Hall, and\nMcCulloch, is ultimately “derived from” an enumerated\npower, Hall, supra, at 345. And, as the dissent agrees,\nthat enumerated power is “the enumerated power that\njustifies the defendant’s statute of conviction,” post, at 17,\nn. 11. Neither we nor the dissent can point to a single\nspecific enumerated power “that justifies a criminal de\nfendant’s arrest or conviction,” post, at 12, in all cases\nbecause Congress relies on different enumerated powers\n(often, but not exclusively, its Commerce Clause power) to\nenact its various federal criminal statutes, see supra, at 7–\n8. But every such statute must itself be legitimately\npredicated on an enumerated power. And the same enu\nmerated power that justifies the creation of a federal\ncriminal statute, and that justifies the additional implied\nfederal powers that the dissent considers legitimate, justi\nfies civil commitment under §4248 as well. See supra, at\n14–16. Thus, we must reject respondents’ argument that\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause permits no more than a\nsingle step between an enumerated power and an Act of\nCongress.\n   Nor need we fear that our holding today confers on\nCongress a general “police power, which the Founders\ndenied the National Government and reposed in the\nStates.” Morrison, 529 U. S., at 618. As the Solicitor\nGeneral repeatedly confirmed at oral argument, §4248 is\nnarrow in scope. It has been applied to only a small frac\ntion of federal prisoners. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 24–25 (105\nindividuals have been subject to §4248 out of over 188,000\nfederal inmates); see also Dept. of Justice, Bureau of\nJustice Statistics, W. Sabol, H. West, & M.

S., at 157.\nThe Framers demonstrated considerable foresight in\ndrafting a Constitution capable of such resilience through\ntime. As Chief Justice Marshall observed nearly 200 years\nago, the Necessary and Proper Clause is part of “a consti\ntution intended to endure for ages to come, and, conse\nquently, to be adapted to the various crises of human\naffairs.” McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 415 (emphasis deleted).\n22              UNITED STATES v.

They in\nclude: (1) the breadth of the Necessary and Proper Clause,\n(2) the long history of federal involvement in this arena,\n(3) the sound reasons for the statute’s enactment in light\nof the Government’s custodial interest in safeguarding the\npublic from dangers posed by those in federal custody, (4)\nthe statute’s accommodation of state interests, and (5) the\nstatute’s narrow scope. Taken together, these considera\ntions lead us to conclude that the statute is a “necessary\nand proper” means of exercising the federal authority that\npermits Congress to create federal criminal laws, to pun\nish their violation, to imprison violators, to provide appro\npriately for those imprisoned, and to maintain the security\nof those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected\nby the federal imprisonment of others. The Constitution\nconsequently authorizes Congress to enact the statute.\n   We do not reach or decide any claim that the statute or\nits application denies equal protection of the laws, proce\ndural or substantive due process, or any other rights\nguaranteed by the Constitution. Respondents are free to\npursue those claims on remand, and any others they have\npreserved.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit with respect to Congress’ power to enact this stat\nute is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

S. C. §4248 are necessary and\nproper exercises of congressional authority.\n   Respondents argue that congressional authority under\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause can be no more than one\nstep removed from an enumerated power. This is incor\nrect. When the inquiry is whether a federal law has suffi\ncient links to an enumerated power to be within the scope\nof federal authority, the analysis depends not on the num\nber of links in the congressional-power chain but on the\nstrength of the chain.\n   Concluding that a relation can be put into a verbal\nformulation that fits somewhere along a causal chain of\nfederal powers is merely the beginning, not the end, of the\nconstitutional inquiry. See United States v. Lopez, 514\nU. S. 549, 566–567 (1995). The inferences must be con\ntrolled by some limitations lest, as Thomas Jefferson\nwarned, congressional powers become completely un\nbounded by linking one power to another ad infinitum in a\nveritable game of “ ‘this is the house that Jack built.’ ”\nLetter from Thomas Jefferson to Edward Livingston (Apr.\n30, 1800), 31 The Papers of Thomas Jefferson 547 (B.\nOberg ed. 2004); see also United States v. Patton, 451\nF. 3d 615, 628 (CA10 2006).\n2               UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n               KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   This separate writing serves two purposes. The first is\nto withhold assent from certain statements and proposi\ntions of the Court’s opinion. The second is to caution that\nthe Constitution does require the invalidation of congres\nsional attempts to extend federal powers in some\ninstances.\n                               I\n   The Court concludes that, when determining whether\nCongress has the authority to enact a specific law under\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause, we look “to see whether\nthe statute constitutes a means that is rationally related\nto the implementation of a constitutionally enumerated\npower.” Ante, at 6 (suggesting that Sabri v. United States,\n541 U. S. 600, 605 (2004), adopts a “means-ends rational\nity” test).\n   The terms “rationally related” and “rational basis” must\nbe employed with care, particularly if either is to be used\nas a stand-alone test. The phrase “rational basis” most\noften is employed to describe the standard for determining\nwhether legislation that does not proscribe fundamental\nliberties nonetheless violates the Due Process Clause.\nReferring to this due process inquiry, and in what must be\none of the most deferential formulations of the standard\nfor reviewing legislation in all the Court’s precedents, the\nCourt has said: “But the law need not be in every respect\nlogically consistent with its aims to be constitutional. It is\nenough that there is an evil at hand for correction, and\nthat it might be thought that the particular legislative\nmeasure was a rational way to correct it.” Williamson v.\nLee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 487–488 (1955).\nThis formulation was in a case presenting a due process\nchallenge and a challenge to a State’s exercise of its own\npowers, powers not confined by the principles that control\nthe limited nature of our National Government. The\nphrase, then, should not be extended uncritically to the\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n               KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\n\nissue before us.\n    The operative constitutional provision in this case is the\nNecessary and Proper Clause. This Court has not held\nthat the Lee Optical test, asking if “it might be thought\nthat the particular legislative measure was a rational way\nto correct” an evil, is the proper test in this context.\nRather, under the Necessary and Proper Clause, applica\ntion of a “rational basis” test should be at least as exacting\nas it has been in the Commerce Clause cases, if not more\nso. Indeed, the cases the Court cites in the portion of its\nopinion referring to “rational basis” are predominantly\nCommerce Clause cases, and none are due process cases.\nSee ante, at 6 (citing Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1 (2005);\nLopez, supra; Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recla\nmation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 276 (1981)).\n    There is an important difference between the two ques\ntions, but the Court does not make this distinction clear.\nRaich, Lopez, and Hodel were all Commerce Clause cases.\nThose precedents require a tangible link to commerce, not\na mere conceivable rational relation, as in Lee Optical.\n“ ‘[S]imply because Congress may conclude that a particu\nlar activity substantially affects interstate commerce does\nnot necessarily make it so.’ ” Lopez, supra, at 557, n. 2\n(quoting Hodel, supra, at 311 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in\njudgment)). The rational basis referred to in the Com\nmerce Clause context is a demonstrated link in fact, based\non empirical demonstration. While undoubtedly deferen\ntial, this may well be different from the rational-basis test\nas Lee Optical described it.\n    The Court relies on Sabri, supra, for its conclusion that\na “means-ends rationality” is all that is required for a\npower to come within the Necessary and Proper Clause’s\nreach. See ante, at 6. Sabri only refers to “means-ends\nrationality” in a parenthetical describing the holding in\nMcCulloch v. Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1320585\"><a href=\"/opinion/1320585/mcculloch-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1819); it certainly\ndid not import the Lee Optical rational-basis test into this\n4              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n              KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\n\narena through such a parenthetical. See Sabri, supra, at\n612 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (“A statute can\nhave a ‘rational’ connection to an enumerated power with\nout being obviously or clearly tied to that enumerated\npower”). It should be remembered, moreover, that the\nspending power is not designated as such in the Constitu\ntion but rather is implied from the power to lay and collect\ntaxes and other specified exactions in order, among other\npurposes, “to pay the Debts and provide for the common\nDefence and general Welfare of the United States.” Art. I,\n§8, cl. 1; see South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 206\n(1987). The limits upon the spending power have not been\nmuch discussed, but if the relevant standard is parallel to\nthe Commerce Clause cases, then the limits and the ana\nlytic approach in those precedents should be respected.\n   A separate concern stems from the Court’s explanation\nof the Tenth Amendment. Ante, at 16. I had thought it a\nbasic principle that the powers reserved to the States\nconsist of the whole, undefined residuum of power remain\ning after taking account of powers granted to the National\nGovernment. The Constitution delegates limited powers\nto the National Government and then reserves the re\nmainder for the States (or the people), not the other way\naround, as the Court’s analysis suggests. And the powers\nreserved to the States are so broad that they remain unde\nfined. Residual power, sometimes referred to (perhaps\nimperfectly) as the police power, belongs to the States and\nthe States alone.\n   It is correct in one sense to say that if the National\nGovernment has the power to act under the Necessary and\nProper Clause then that power is not one reserved to the\nStates. But the precepts of federalism embodied in the\nConstitution inform which powers are properly exercised\nby the National Government in the first place. See Lopez,\n514 U. S., at 580–581 (KENNEDY, J., concurring); see also\nMcCulloch, supra, at 421 (powers “consist[ent] with the\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             5\n\n               KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\n\nletter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional”). It\nis of fundamental importance to consider whether essen\ntial attributes of state sovereignty are compromised by the\nassertion of federal power under the Necessary and Proper\nClause; if so, that is a factor suggesting that the power is\nnot one properly within the reach of federal power.\n   The opinion of the Court should not be interpreted to\nhold that the only, or even the principal, constraints on\nthe exercise of congressional power are the Constitution’s\nexpress prohibitions. The Court’s discussion of the Tenth\nAmendment invites the inference that restrictions flowing\nfrom the federal system are of no import when defining\nthe limits of the National Government’s power, as it pro\nceeds by first asking whether the power is within the\nNational Government’s reach, and if so it discards federal\nism concerns entirely.\n   These remarks explain why the Court ignores important\nlimitations stemming from federalism principles. Those\nprinciples are essential to an understanding of the func\ntion and province of the States in our constitutional\nstructure.\n                              II\n   As stated at the outset, in this case Congress has acted\nwithin its powers to ensure that an abrupt end to the\nfederal detention of prisoners does not endanger third\nparties. Federal prisoners often lack a single home State\nto take charge of them due to their lengthy prison stays, so\nit is incumbent on the National Government to act. This\nobligation, parallel in some respects to duties defined in\ntort law, is not to put in motion a particular force (here an\nunstable and dangerous person) that endangers others.\nHaving acted within its constitutional authority to detain\nthe person, the National Government can acknowledge a\nduty to ensure that an abrupt end to the detention does\nnot prejudice the States and their citizens.\n6              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n              KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   I would note, as the Court’s opinion does, that §4248\ndoes not supersede the right and responsibility of the\nStates to identify persons who ought to be subject to civil\nconfinement. The federal program in question applies\nonly to those in federal custody and thus involves little\nintrusion upon the ordinary processes and powers of the\nStates.\n   This is not a case in which the National Government\ndemands that a State use its own governmental system to\nimplement federal commands. See Printz v. United States,\n521 U. S. 898 (1997). It is not a case in which the Na\ntional Government relieves the States of their own pri\nmary responsibility to enact laws and policies for the\nsafety and well being of their citizens. See United States\nv. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598 (2000). Nor is it a case in which\nthe exercise of national power intrudes upon functions and\nduties traditionally committed to the State. See Lopez,\nsupra, at 580–581 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).\n   Rather, this is a discrete and narrow exercise of author\nity over a small class of persons already subject to the\nfederal power. Importantly, §4248(d) requires the Attor\nney General to release any civil detainee “to the appropri\nate official of the State in which the person is domiciled or\nwas tried if such State will assume responsibility for his\ncustody, care, and treatment,” providing a strong assur\nance that the proffered reason for the legislation’s neces\nsity is not a mere artifice.\n   With these observations, I concur in the judgment of the\nCourt.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

S. C. §4248, in order to “carr[y] into Execution”\npowers specifically conferred on Congress by the Constitu\ntion, see Art. I, §8, cl. 18.\n   Section 4248 was enacted to protect the public from\nfederal prisoners who suffer from “a serious mental ill\nness, abnormality, or disorder” and who, if released, would\nhave “serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent\nconduct or child molestation.”        See §§4247(a)(5), (6),\n4248(d). Under this law, if neither the State of a pris\noner’s domicile nor the State in which the prisoner was\ntried will assume the responsibility for the prisoner’s\n“custody, care, and treatment,” the Federal Government is\nauthorized to undertake that responsibility. §4248(d).\nThe statute recognizes that, in many cases, no State will\nassume the heavy financial burden of civilly committing a\ndangerous federal prisoner who, as a result of lengthy\nfederal incarceration, no longer has any substantial ties to\nany State.\n2                   UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                    ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n  I entirely agree with the dissent that “[t]he Necessary\nand Proper Clause empowers Congress to enact only those\nlaws that ‘carr[y] into Execution’ one or more of the federal\npowers enumerated in the Constitution,” post, at 1, but\n§4248 satisfies that requirement because it is a necessary\nand proper means of carrying into execution the enumer\nated powers that support the federal criminal statutes\nunder which the affected prisoners were convicted. The\nNecessary and Proper Clause provides the constitutional\nauthority for most federal criminal statutes. In other\nwords, most federal criminal statutes rest upon a congres\nsional judgment that, in order to execute one or more of\nthe powers conferred on Congress, it is necessary and\nproper to criminalize certain conduct, and in order to do\nthat it is obviously necessary and proper to provide for the\noperation of a federal criminal justice system and a federal\nprison system.\n  All of this has been recognized since the beginning of\nour country.

Although the term “necessary” does\nnot mean “absolutely necessary” or indispensable, the\nterm requires an “appropriate” link between a power\nconferred by the Constitution and the law enacted by\nCongress.

And it is an obligation of this Court to enforce\ncompliance with that limitation.

Thus, Congress has no power to act unless\nthe Constitution authorizes it to do so. United States v.\nMorrison, 529 U. S. 598, 607 (2000) (“Every law enacted\n2                 UNITED STATES v.

The States, in turn, are\nfree to exercise all powers that the Constitution does not\nwithhold from them. Amdt. 10 (“The powers not delegated\nto the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by\nit to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or\nto the people”).1 This constitutional structure establishes\ndifferent default rules for Congress and the States: Con\ngress’ powers are “few and defined,” while those that\nbelong to the States “remain . . . numerous and indefinite.”\nThe Federalist No. 45, p. 328 (B. Wright ed. 1961) (J.\nMadison).\n   The Constitution plainly sets forth the “few and defined”\npowers that Congress may exercise. Article I “vest[s]” in\nCongress “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted,” §1, and\ncarefully enumerates those powers in §8. The final clause\nof §8, the Necessary and Proper Clause, authorizes Con\ngress “[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and\nproper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers,\nand all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the\nGovernment of the United States, or in any Department or\nOfficer thereof.” Art. I, §8, cl. 18. As the Clause’s place\nment at the end of §8 indicates, the “foregoing Powers” are\nthose granted to Congress in the preceding clauses of that\nsection. The “other Powers” to which the Clause refers are\nthose “vested” in Congress and the other branches by\nother specific provisions of the Constitution.\n   Chief Justice Marshall famously summarized Congress’\nauthority under the Necessary and Proper Clause in\nMcCulloch, which has stood for nearly 200 years as this\n——————\n  1 “With this careful last phrase, the [Tenth] Amendment avoids tak\n\ning any position on the division of power between the state govern\nments and the people of the States: It is up to the people of each State\nto determine which ‘reserved’ powers their state government may\nexercise.” U.

S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nCourt’s definitive interpretation of that text:\n    “Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of\n    the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,\n    which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not\n    prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the\n    constitution, are constitutional.” 4 Wheat., at 421.\n   McCulloch’s summation is descriptive of the Clause\nitself, providing that federal legislation is a valid exercise\nof Congress’ authority under the Clause if it satisfies a\ntwo-part test: First, the law must be directed toward a\n“legitimate” end, which McCulloch defines as one “within\nthe scope of the [C]onstitution”—that is, the powers ex\npressly delegated to the Federal Government by some\nprovision in the Constitution. Second, there must be a\nnecessary and proper fit between the “means” (the federal\nlaw) and the “end” (the enumerated power or powers) it is\ndesigned to serve. Ibid. McCulloch accords Congress a\ncertain amount of discretion in assessing means-end fit\nunder this second inquiry. The means Congress selects\nwill be deemed “necessary” if they are “appropriate” and\n“plainly adapted” to the exercise of an enumerated power,\nand “proper” if they are not otherwise “prohibited” by the\nConstitution and not “[in]consistent” with its “letter and\nspirit.” Ibid.\n   Critically, however, McCulloch underscores the linear\nrelationship the Clause establishes between the two in\nquiries: Unless the end itself is “legitimate,” the fit be\ntween means and end is irrelevant. In other words, no\nmatter how “necessary” or “proper” an Act of Congress\nmay be to its objective, Congress lacks authority to legis\nlate if the objective is anything other than “carrying into\nExecution” one or more of the Federal Government’s enu\nmerated powers. Art. I, §8, cl. 18.\n   This limitation was of utmost importance to the Fram\ners.     During the State ratification debates, Anti\n4                 UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nFederalists expressed concern that the Necessary and\nProper Clause would give Congress virtually unlimited\npower. See, e.g., Essays of Brutus, in 2 The Complete\nAnti-Federalist 421 (H. Storing ed. 1981). Federalist\nsupporters of the Constitution swiftly refuted that charge,\nexplaining that the Clause did not grant Congress any\nfreestanding authority, but instead made explicit what\nwas already implicit in the grant of each enumerated\npower. Referring to the “powers declared in the Constitu\ntion,” Alexander Hamilton noted that “it is expressly to\nexecute these powers that the sweeping clause . . . author\nizes the national legislature to pass all necessary and\nproper laws.” The Federalist No. 33, at 245. James Madi\nson echoed this view, stating that “the sweeping clause . . .\nonly extend[s] to the enumerated powers.” 3 J. Elliot, The\nDebates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption\nof the Federal Constitution 455 (2d ed. 1854) (hereinafter\nElliot). Statements by delegates to the state ratification\nconventions indicate that this understanding was widely\nheld by the founding generation. E.g., id., at 245–246\n(statement of George Nicholas) (“Suppose [the Necessary\nand Proper Clause] had been inserted, at the end of every\npower, that they should have power to make laws to carry\nthat power into execution; would that have increased their\npowers? If, therefore, it could not have increased their\npowers, if placed at the end of each power, it cannot in\ncrease them at the end of all”).2\n——————\n  2 See also 4 Elliot 141 (2d ed. 1836) (statement of William Maclaine)\n\n(“This clause specifies that [Congress] shall make laws to carry into\nexecution all the powers vested by this Constitution, consequently they\ncan make no laws to execute any other power”); 2 id., at 468 (statement\nof James Wilson) (“[W]hen it is said that Congress shall have power to\nmake all laws which shall be necessary and proper, those words are\nlimited and defined by the following, ‘for carrying into execution the\nforegoing powers.’ [The Clause] is saying no more than that the powers\nwe have already particularly given, shall be effectually carried into\nexecution”); Barnett, The Original Meaning of the Necessary and\n                    Cite as: 560 U.

Since\nthen, our precedents uniformly have maintained that the\nNecessary and Proper Clause is not an independent fount\nof congressional authority, but rather “a caveat that Con\ngress possesses all the means necessary to carry out the\nspecifically granted ‘foregoing’ powers of §8 ‘and all other\nPowers vested by this Constitution.’ ” Kinsella v.

Indeed, not even the Commerce\nClause—the enumerated power this Court has interpreted\nmost expansively, see, e.g., NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin\nSteel Corp., 301 U. S. 1, 37 (1937)—can justify federal civil\ndetention of sex offenders. Under the Court’s precedents,\nCongress may not regulate noneconomic activity (such as\nsexual violence) based solely on the effect such activity\nmay have, in individual cases or in the aggregate, on\ninterstate commerce. Morrison, 529 U. S., at 617–618;\nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U.

Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 426 (1979). As a conse\nquence, we have held that States may “take measures to\nrestrict the freedom of the dangerously mentally ill”—\nincluding those who are sexually dangerous—provided\nthat such commitments satisfy due process and other\nconstitutional requirements. Kansas v. Hendricks, 521\nU. S. 346, 363 (1997).\n  Section 4248 closely resembles the involuntary civil\ncommitment laws that States have enacted under their\nparens patriae and general police powers. Indeed, it is\nclear, on the face of the Act and in the Government’s\narguments urging its constitutionality, that §4248 is\naimed at protecting society from acts of sexual violence,\nnot toward “carrying into Execution” any enumerated\npower or powers of the Federal Government. See Adam\nWalsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, 120 Stat.\n587 (entitled “[a]n Act [t]o protect children from sexual\nexploitation and violent crime”), §102, id., at 590 (state\nment of purpose declaring that the Act was promulgated\n“to protect the public from sex offenders”); Brief for United\nStates 38–39 (asserting the Federal Government’s power\nto “protect the public from harm that might result upon\nthese prisoners’ release, even when that harm might arise\nfrom conduct that is otherwise beyond the general regula\ntory powers of the federal government” (emphasis added)).\n——————\n   5 For the reasons explained in Part III–A–2, infra, the enumerated\n\npower that justifies a particular defendant’s criminal arrest or convic\ntion cannot justify his subsequent civil detention under §4248.\n8                  UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n  To be sure, protecting society from violent sexual of\nfenders is certainly an important end. Sexual abuse is a\ndespicable act with untold consequences for the victim\npersonally and society generally. See, e.g., Kennedy v.\nLouisiana, 554 U. S. ___, ___, n. 2, (2008) (ALITO, J., dis\nsenting) (slip op., at 9, n. 2, 22–23). But the Constitution\ndoes not vest in Congress the authority to protect society\nfrom every bad act that might befall it.6 New York v.\nUnited States, 505 U. S. 144, 157 (1992) (“ ‘The question is\nnot what power the Federal Government ought to have\nbut what powers in fact have been given by the people’ ”\n(quoting United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1, 63 (1936)).\n  In my view, this should decide the question. Section\n4248 runs afoul of our settled understanding of Congress’\npower under the Necessary and Proper Clause. Congress\nmay act under that Clause only when its legislation\n“carr[ies] into Execution” one of the Federal Government’s\nenumerated powers. Art. I, §8, cl. 18. Section 4248 does\nnot execute any enumerated power. Section 4248 is there\nfore unconstitutional.\n                             III\n   The Court perfunctorily genuflects to McCulloch’s\nframework for assessing Congress’ Necessary and Proper\nClause authority, and to the principle of dual sovereignty\nit helps to maintain, then promptly abandons both in favor\nof a novel five-factor test supporting its conclusion that\n§4248 is a “ ‘necessary and proper’ ” adjunct to a jumble of\nunenumerated “authorit[ies].” Ante, at 22. The Court’s\nnewly minted test cannot be reconciled with the Clause’s\nplain text or with two centuries of our precedents inter\n——————\n  6 The absence of a constitutional delegation of general police power to\n\nCongress does not leave citizens vulnerable to the harms Congress\nseeks to regulate in §4248 because, as recent legislation indicates, the\nStates have the capacity to address the threat that sexual offenders\npose.

It also raises more questions than it answers.\nMust each of the five considerations exist before the Court\nsustains future federal legislation as proper exercises of\nCongress’ Necessary and Proper Clause authority? What\nif the facts of a given case support a finding of only four\nconsiderations? Or three? And if three or four will suffice,\nwhich three or four are imperative? At a minimum, this\nshift from the two-step McCulloch framework to this five\nconsideration approach warrants an explanation as to why\nMcCulloch is no longer good enough and which of the five\nconsiderations will bear the most weight in future cases,\nassuming some number less than five suffices. (Or, if not,\nwhy all five are required.) The Court provides no answers\nto these questions.\n                            A\n  I begin with the first and last “considerations” in the\nCourt’s inquiry. Ante, at 5. The Court concludes that\n§4248 is a valid exercise of Congress’ Necessary and\nProper Clause authority because that authority is “broad,”\nibid., and because “the links between §4248 and an enu\nmerated Article I power are not too attenuated,” ante, at\n18. In so doing, the Court first inverts, then misapplies,\nMcCulloch’s straightforward two-part test.\n                             1\n                             a\n  First, the Court describes Congress’ lawmaking power\nunder the Necessary and Proper Clause as “broad,” relying\non precedents that have upheld federal laws under the\nClause after finding a “ ‘rationa[l]’ ” fit between the law\nand an enumerated power. Ante, at 6 (quoting Sabri v.\nUnited States, 541 U. S. 600, 605 (2004)). It is true that\nthis Court’s precedents allow Congress a certain degree of\nlatitude in selecting the means for “carrying into Execu\n10                 UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ntion” an end that is “legitimate.”7 See, e.g., Jinks v. Rich\nland County, 538 U. S. 456, 462–463 (2003) (citing\nMcCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 417, 421). But in citing these\ncases, the Court puts the cart before the horse: The fit\nbetween means and ends matters only if the end is in fact\nlegitimate—i.e., only if it is one of the Federal Govern\nment’s enumerated powers.\n   By starting its inquiry with the degree of deference\nowed to Congress in selecting means to further a legiti\nmate end, the Court bypasses McCulloch’s first step and\nfails carefully to examine whether the end served by §4248\nis actually one of those powers. See Part III–A–2, infra.\n                             b\n  Second, instead of asking the simple question of what\nenumerated power §4248 “carr[ies] into Execution” at\nMcCulloch’s first step, the Court surveys other laws Con\ngress has enacted and concludes that, because §4248 is\nrelated to those laws, the “links” between §4248 and an\nenumerated power are not “too attenuated”; hence, §4248\nis a valid exercise of Congress’ Necessary and Proper\nClause authority. Ante, at 18. This unnecessarily con\nfuses the analysis and, if followed to its logical extreme,\nwould result in an unwarranted expansion of federal\n——————\n  7 JUSTICE KENNEDY concludes that the Necessary and Proper Clause\nrequires something beyond rational-basis scrutiny when assessing the\nfit between an enumerated power and the means Congress selects to\nexecute it. Ante, at 2–4 (opinion concurring in judgment). Other\narguments regarding the degree of fit between means and end have\nbeen lodged elsewhere. See, e.g., Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 61\n(2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (arguing that, for a law to be within the\nNecessary and Proper Clause, it must bear an “ ‘obvious, simple, and\ndirect relation’ ” to an exercise of Congress’ enumerated powers and\nmust not subvert basic principles of federalism and dual sovereignty).\nBut I find that debate beside the point here, because it concerns the\nanalysis employed at McCulloch’s second step, see McCulloch v.

From this, the Court assumes that §4248 must also be\na valid exercise of congressional power because it is “ ‘rea\nsonably adapted’ ” to those exercises of Congress’ inciden\ntal—and thus unenumerated—authorities. See ante, at 15\n(concluding that “§4248 is ‘reasonably adapted’ to Con\ngress’ power to act as a responsible federal custodian”\n(citation omitted)); ante, at 22 (concluding that “the stat\nute is a ‘necessary and proper’ means of exercising the\nfederal authority that permits Congress to create federal\ncriminal laws, to punish their violation, to imprison viola\ntors, to provide appropriately for those imprisoned, and to\nmaintain the security of those who are not imprisoned but\nwho may be affected by the federal imprisonment of oth\ners”). But that is not the question. The Necessary and\nProper Clause does not provide Congress with authority to\nenact any law simply because it furthers other laws Con\ngress has enacted in the exercise of its incidental author\nity; the Clause plainly requires a showing that every\nfederal statute “carr[ies] into Execution” one or more of\nthe Federal Government’s enumerated powers.8\n——————\n  8 McCulloch   makes this point clear. As the Court notes, ante, at 18–\n19, McCulloch states, in discussing a hypothetical, that from Congress’\nenumerated power to establish post offices and post roads “has been\ninferred the power and duty of carrying the mail,” and, “from this\nimplied power, has again been inferred the right to punish those who\nsteal letters from the post office, or rob the mail.” 4 Wheat., at 417.\nContrary to the Court’s interpretation, this dictum does not suggest\nthat the relationship between Congress’ implied power to punish postal\ncrimes and its implied power to carry the mail is alone sufficient to\nsatisfy review under the Necessary and Proper Clause. Instead,\nMcCulloch directly links the constitutionality of the former to Congress’\n12                 UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n  Federal laws that criminalize conduct that interferes\nwith enumerated powers, establish prisons for those who\nengage in that conduct, and set rules for the care and\ntreatment of prisoners awaiting trial or serving a criminal\nsentence satisfy this test because each helps to “carr[y]\ninto Execution” the enumerated powers that justify a\ncriminal defendant’s arrest or conviction. For example,\nCongress’ enumerated power “[t]o establish Post Offices\nand post Roads,” Art. I, §8, cl. 7, would lack force or practi\ncal effect if Congress lacked the authority to enact crimi\nnal laws “to punish those who steal letters from the post\noffice, or rob the mail.” McCulloch, supra, at 417. Simi\nlarly, that enumerated power would be compromised if\nthere were no prisons to hold persons who violate those\nlaws, or if those prisons were so poorly managed that\nprisoners could escape or demand their release on the\ngrounds that the conditions of their confinement violate\ntheir constitutional rights, at least as we have defined\nthem. See, e.g., Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.

More\nimportantly, McCulloch’s holding, as well as the holdings of this Court’s\nsubsequent decisions, make plain that congressional action is valid\nunder the Necessary and Proper Clause only if it carries into execution\none or more enumerated powers. Id., at 422 (upholding Congress’\nincorporation of a bank because it was a “means . . . to be employed\nonly for the purpose of carrying into execution the given powers” (em\nphasis added)); see Sabri v.

In other words, the Court analogizes\n§4248 to federal laws that authorize prison officials to care\nfor federal inmates while they serve sentences or await\ntrial. But while those laws help to “carr[y] into Execution”\nthe enumerated power that justifies the imposition of\ncriminal sanctions on the inmate, §4248 does not bear that\nessential characteristic for three reasons.\n   First, the statute’s definition of a “sexually dangerous\nperson” contains no element relating to the subject’s\ncrime. See §§4247(a)(5)–(6). It thus does not require a\nfederal court to find any connection between the reasons\nsupporting civil commitment and the enumerated power\nwith which that person’s criminal conduct interfered. As a\nconsequence, §4248 allows a court to civilly commit an\nindividual without finding that he was ever charged with\nor convicted of a federal crime involving sexual violence.\n§§4248(a), (d). That possibility is not merely hypothetical:\nThe Government concedes that nearly 20% of individuals\nagainst whom §4248 proceedings have been brought fit\nthis description.9 Tr. of Oral Arg. 23–25.\n   Second, §4248 permits the term of federal civil commit\nment to continue beyond the date on which a convicted\n——————\n  9 The statute does require the court to find that the subject “has en\n\ngaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child\nmolestation,” §4247(a)(5), but that factual predicate can be established\nby a state conviction, or by clear and convincing evidence that the\nperson committed a sex crime for which he was never charged.\n14             UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nprisoner’s sentence expires or the date on which the stat\nute of limitations on an untried defendant’s crime has run.\nThe statute therefore authorizes federal custody over a\nperson at a time when the Government would lack juris\ndiction to detain him for violating a criminal law that\nexecutes an enumerated power.\n   The statute this Court upheld in Greenwood v. United\nStates, 350 U. S. 366 (1956), provides a useful contrast.\nThat statute authorized the Federal Government to exer\ncise civil custody over a federal defendant declared men\ntally unfit to stand trial only “ ‘until the accused shall be\nmentally competent to stand trial or until the pending\ncharges against him are disposed of according to law.’ ”\nId., at 368, n. 2 (quoting 18 U. S. C. §4246 (1952 ed.)).\nThus, that statute’s “end” reasonably could be interpreted\nas preserving the Government’s power to enforce a crimi\nnal law against the accused. Section 4248 (2006 ed.),\nhowever, authorizes federal detention of a person even\nafter the Government loses the authority to prosecute him\nfor a federal crime.\n   Third, the definition of a “sexually dangerous person”\nrelevant to §4248 does not require the court to find that\nthe person is likely to violate a law executing an enumer\nated power in the future. Although the Federal Govern\nment has no express power to regulate sexual violence\ngenerally, Congress has passed a number of laws proscrib\ning such conduct in special circumstances. All of these\nstatutes contain jurisdictional elements that require a\nconnection to one of Congress’ enumerated powers—such\nas interstate commerce, e.g., §2252(a)(2)—or that limit the\nstatute’s coverage to jurisdictions in which Congress has\nplenary authority, e.g., §2243(a). Section 4248, by con\ntrast, authorizes civil commitment upon a showing that\nthe person is “sexually dangerous,” and presents a risk “to\nothers,” §4247(a)(5). It requires no evidence that this\nsexually dangerous condition will manifest itself in a way\n                      Cite as: 560 U.

I, §8, cl. 17, and federal territories, Art. IV, §3, cl. 2. In\naddition, Congress has “broad general powers to legislate in respect to\nIndian tribes,” United States v. Lara, 541 U.

Although the Necessary\nand Proper Clause did not authorize Congress to enact §4248, I do not\nrule out the possibility that Congress could provide for the civil com\nmitment of individuals who enter federal custody as a result of acts\ncommitted in these jurisdictions.

Cohen, 733\nF. 2d 128 (CADC 1984) (en banc) (upholding civil commitment of a\ndefendant under a District of Columbia statute authorizing the institu\ntionalization of persons acquitted by reason of insanity).

In any event, nothing in the Re\nstatement suggests that a common-law custodian has the\npowers that Congress seeks here. While the Restatement\nprovides that a custodian has a duty to take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that a person in his care does not cause\n“bodily harm to others,” 2 Restatement (Second) of Torts\n§319, p. 129 (1963–1964), that duty terminates once the\nlegal basis for custody expires:\n     “There is no duty so to control the conduct of a third\n     person as to prevent him from causing physical harm\n     to another unless\n        “(a) a special relation exists between the actor and\n     the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor\n     to control the third person’s conduct, or\n        “(b) a special relation exists between the actor and\n     the other which gives to the other a right to protec\n     tion.” Id., §315, at 122.\nOnce the Federal Government’s criminal jurisdiction over\na prisoner ends, so does any “special relation[ship]” be\ntween the Government and the former prisoner.12\n——————\n  11 The Court also cites Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U. S. 307 (1982), but\n\nthat case lends even less support than the Restatement. In Youngberg,\nan inmate at a state hospital argued that hospital workers violated his\nconstitutional rights when they applied restraints to keep him in his\nbed at the hospital infirmary. Id., at 310–311. In assessing that claim,\nthis Court noted that the hospital had a responsibility to “protect its\nresidents” from the danger of violence. Id., at 320 (emphasis added).\nThe Court never suggested that this responsibility extended to “nearby\n(and other) communities.” Ante, at 14. Moreover, the hospital was a\nstate institution. Nothing in Youngberg suggests that the Federal\nGovernment can detain a person beyond the date on which its criminal\njurisdiction expires for fear that he may later pose a threat to the\nsurrounding community.\n  12 Federal law permits a sentencing court to order that a defendant be\n\nplaced on a term of “supervised release” after his term of imprisonment\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                  17\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   For this reason, I cannot agree with JUSTICE ALITO that\n§4248 is a necessary and proper incident of Congress’\npower “to protect the public from dangers created by the\nfederal criminal justice and prison systems.” Ante, at 3\n(concurring in judgment). A federal criminal defendant’s\n“sexually dangerous” propensities are not “created by” the\nfact of his incarceration or his relationship with the fed\neral prison system. The fact that the Federal Government\nhas the authority to imprison a person for the purpose of\npunishing him for a federal crime—sex-related or other\nwise—does not provide the Government with the addi\ntional power to exercise indefinite civil control over that\nperson.13\n                             2\n  Second, the Court describes §4248 as a “modest” expan\nsion on a statutory framework with a long historical pedi\ngree. Ante, at 9. Yet even if the antiquity of a practice\ncould serve as a substitute for its constitutionality—and\nthe Court admits that it cannot, ibid.—the Court over\nstates the relevant history.\n  Congress’ first foray into this general area occurred in\n1855, when it established St. Elizabeth’s Hospital to pro\nvide treatment to “insane” persons in the military and the\n——————\nis complete. 18 U. S. C. §§3583, 3624(e). Contrary to the Government’s\nsuggestion, federal authority to exercise control over individuals\nserving terms of “supervised release” does not derive from the Govern\nment’s “relationship” with the prisoner, see Brief for United States 38,\nbut from the original criminal sentence itself. Supervised release thus\nserves to execute the enumerated power that justifies the defendant’s\nstatute of conviction, just like any other form of punishment imposed at\nsentencing.\n   13 The fact that Congress has the authority to “provide for the appre\n\nhension of escaped federal prisoners,” see ante, at 3 (ALITO, J., concur\nring in judgment), does not change this conclusion. That authority\nderives from Congress’ power to vindicate the enumerated power with\nwhich the escaped defendant’s crime of conviction interfered, not a\nfreestanding police power.\n18                UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nDistrict of Columbia. Act of Mar. 3, 1855, 10 Stat. 682.\nBut Congress was acting pursuant to enumerated powers\nwhen it took this step. See Art. I, §8, cl. 17 (granting\nCongress plenary authority over the District of Columbia);\nArt. I, §8, cl. 14 (authorizing Congress to “make Rules for\nthe Government and Regulation of the land and naval\nForces”). This enactment therefore provides no support\nfor Congress’ claimed power to detain sexually dangerous\npersons without an otherwise valid basis for jurisdiction.\n  Later, Congress provided for the federal civil commit\nment of “insane” persons charged with or convicted of a\nfederal crime. Act of Feb. 7, 1857, §§5–6, 11 Stat. 158; see\n17 Op. Atty. Gen. 211, 212–213 (1881); Act of June 23,\n1874, ch. 465, 18 Stat. 251; Act of Aug. 7, 1882, 22 Stat.\n330. As the Court explains, however, these statutes did\nnot authorize federal custody beyond the completion of the\n“term” of federal “imprisonment,” §§2–3, 18 Stat. 252; see\n35 Op. Atty. Gen. 366, 368 (1927); 30 Op. Atty. Gen. 569,\n570–571 (1916); Act of May 13, 1930, ch. 254, §6, 46 Stat.\n271, and thus shed no light on the question presented\nhere.\n  In 1949, Congress enacted a more comprehensive re\ngime, authorizing the civil commitment of mentally ill\npersons in BOP custody. See 18 U. S. C. §§4246, 4247\n(1952 ed.). This Court addressed that regime in Green\nwood, but never endorsed the proposition that the Federal\nGovernment could rely on that statute to detain a person\nin the absence of a pending criminal charge or ongoing\ncriminal sentence.14\n——————\n  14 In addition, at least some courts questioned the Federal Govern\n\nment’s power to detain a person in such circumstances.

S.,\nat 375; see supra, at 16. The Court was careful to state\nthat “[t]his commitment, and therefore the legislation\nauthorizing commitment in the context of this case, in\nvolve[d] an assertion of authority” within “congressional\npower under the Necessary and Proper Clause.” Green\nwood, 350 U. S., at 375 (emphasis added). But it painstak\ningly limited its holding to “the narrow constitutional\nissue raised by th[at] order of commitment.” Ibid.\n   The historical record thus supports the Federal Gov\nernment’s authority to detain a mentally ill person against\nwhom it has the authority to enforce a criminal law. But\nit provides no justification whatsoever for reading the\nNecessary and Proper Clause to grant Congress the power\nto authorize the detention of persons without a basis for\nfederal criminal jurisdiction.\n                              3\n  Finally, the Court offers two arguments regarding\n§4248’s impact on the relationship between the Federal\nGovernment and the States. First, the Court and both\nconcurrences suggest that Congress must have had the\npower to enact §4248 because a long period of federal\nincarceration might “seve[r]” a sexually dangerous pris\noner’s “claim to ‘legal residence’ ” in any particular State,\nante, at 15 (opinion of the Court), thus leaving the pris\noner without any “home State to take charge” of him upon\nrelease, ante, at 5 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment);\n——————\ning the statute to permit federal civil detention only for a period rea\nsonably related to a criminal prosecution); Wells v. Attorney General of\nUnited States, 201 F. 2d 556, 560 (CA10 1953) (same).\n20                 UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nsee ante, at 1 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment) (noting\nthat many federal prisoners, “as a result of lengthy federal\nincarceration, no longer ha[ve] any substantial ties to any\nState”). I disagree with the premise of that argument. As\nan initial matter, States plainly have the constitutional\nauthority to “take charge” of a federal prisoner released\nwithin their jurisdiction. See Amdt. 10 (stating that pow\ners not delegated to the Federal Government are “re\nserved” to the States, and to the people). In addition, the\nassumption that a State knowingly would fail to exercise\nthat authority is, in my view, implausible. The Govern\nment stated at oral argument that its “default position” is\nto release a federal prisoner to the State in which he was\nconvicted, Tr. of Oral Arg. 15; see also 28 CFR §2.33(b)\n(2009), and neither the Court nor the concurrences argue\nthat a State has the power to refuse such a person domi\ncile within its borders. Thus, they appear to assume that,\nin the absence of 18 U. S. C. §4248, a State would take no\naction when informed by the BOP that a sexually danger\nous federal prisoner was about to be released within its\njurisdiction. In light of the plethora of state laws enacted\nin recent decades to protect communities from sex offend\ners,15 the likelihood of such an occurrence seems quite\n——————\n  15 As we have noted before, all 50 States have developed “some varia\ntion” of a system “for mandatory registration of sex offenders and\ncorresponding community notification.” Smith v. Doe, 538 U. S. 84, 89–\n90 (2003). In addition, several States have taken further steps; some\nimpose residency restrictions on sex offenders, see, e.g., Kennedy v.\nLouisiana, 554 U. S. ___ , ___, n. 5 (2008) (ALITO, J., dissenting) (slip\nop., at 11, n. 5) (collecting statutes), and, most relevant here, 22 States\nhave enacted involuntary civil-commitment laws substantially similar\nto §4248, see Ariz.

But even in the event a State made such a deci\nsion, the Constitution assigns the responsibility for that\ndecision, and its consequences, to the state government\nalone.\n   Next, the Court submits that §4248 does not upset the\nbalance of federalism or invade the States’ reserved pow\ners because it “requires accommodation of state interests”\nby instructing the Attorney General to release a commit\nted person to the State in which he was domiciled or tried\nif that State wishes to “ ‘assume . . . responsibility’ ” for\nhim. Ante, at 17 (quoting §4248(d)). This right of first\nrefusal is mere window dressing. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5 (“It is\nnot the usual course that the State does take responsibil\nity”). More importantly, it is an altogether hollow assur\nance that §4248 preserves the principle of dual sover\neignty—the “letter and spirit” of the Constitution—as the\nNecessary and Proper Clause requires.16 McCulloch, 4\n——————\n§632.480 et seq.

(West 2007 and\nSupp. 2009).\n   16 The Court describes my argument as a claim that “§4248 violates\n\nthe Tenth Amendment.” Ante, at 16. Yet, I agree entirely with the\nCourt that “ ‘it makes no difference whether one views the question at\nissue [here] as one of ascertaining the limits of the power delegated to\nthe Federal Government under the affirmative provisions of the Consti\ntution or one of discerning the core of sovereignty retained by the\nStates under the Tenth Amendment.’ ” Ibid. (quoting New York v.\nUnited States, 505 U. S. 144, 159 (1992)). Section 4248 is unconstitu\ntional because it does not “carr[y] into Execution” an enumerated\npower. Therefore, it necessarily intrudes upon the powers our Consti\ntution reserves to the States and to the people.\n22             UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nWheat., at 421; Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898,\n923–924 (1997). For once it is determined that Congress\nhas the authority to provide for the civil detention of\nsexually dangerous persons, Congress “is acting within the\npowers granted it under the Constitution,” and “may\nimpose its will on the States.” Gregory, 501 U. S., at 460;\nsee Art. VI, cl. 2. Section 4248’s right of first refusal is\nthus not a matter of constitutional necessity, but an act of\nlegislative grace.\n   Nevertheless, 29 States appear as amici and argue that\n§4248 is constitutional. They tell us that they do not\nobject to Congress retaining custody of “sexually danger\nous persons” after their criminal sentences expire because\nthe cost of detaining such persons is “expensive”—\napproximately $64,000 per year—and these States would\nrather the Federal Government bear this expense.

(“[S]ex offender civil commitment\nprograms are expensive to operate”); id., at 4 (“these pro\ngrams are expensive”); id., at 8 (“[T]here are very practical\nreasons to prefer a system that includes a federal sex\noffender civil commitment program . . . . One such reason\nis the significant cost”).\n   Congress’ power, however, is fixed by the Constitution;\nit does not expand merely to suit the States’ policy prefer\nences, or to allow State officials to avoid difficult choices\nregarding the allocation of state funds. By assigning the\nFederal Government power over “certain enumerated\nobjects only,” the Constitution “leaves to the several States\na residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other ob\njects.” The Federalist No. 39, at 285 (J.

(stating that Congress\nhas “no general right to punish murder committed within\nany of the States”).\n                         *    *     *\n  Not long ago, this Court described the Necessary and\nProper Clause as “the last, best hope of those who defend\nultra vires congressional action.” Printz, supra, at 923.\nRegrettably, today’s opinion breathes new life into that\nClause, and—the Court’s protestations to the contrary\nnotwithstanding, see ante, at 18—comes perilously close to\ntransforming the Necessary and Proper Clause into a\nbasis for the federal police power that “we always have\nrejected,” Lopez, 514 U. S., at 584 (THOMAS, J., concur\nring) (citing Gregory, supra, at 457; Wirtz, 392 U. S., at\n196; Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S., at 37). In so\ndoing, the Court endorses the precise abuse of power\nArticle I is designed to prevent—the use of a limited grant\nof authority as a “pretext . . . for the accomplishment of\nobjects not intrusted to the government.” McCulloch,\nsupra, at 423.\n  I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 146552, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2010/05/17/United_States_v._Comstock.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2009                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued January 12, 2010—Decided May 17, 2010\nFederal law allows a district court to order the civil commitment of a\n  mentally ill, sexually dangerous federal prisoner beyond the date he\n  would otherwise be released. 18 U. S. C. §4248. The Government in\n  stituted civil-commitment proceedings under §4248 against respon\n  dents, each of whom moved to dismiss on the ground, inter alia, that,\n  in enacting the statute, Congress exceeded its powers under the Nec\n  essary and Proper Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 18. Agreeing,\n  the District Court granted dismissal, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed\n  on the legislative-power ground.\nHeld: The Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress authority suf\n ficient to enact §4248. Taken together, five considerations compel\n this conclusion. Pp. 5–22.\n    (1) The Clause grants Congress broad authority to pass laws in fur\n therance of its constitutionally enumerated powers. It makes clear\n that grants of specific federal legislative authority are accompanied\n by broad power to enact laws that are “convenient, or useful” or “con\n ducive” to the enumerated power’s “beneficial exercise,” e.g.,\n McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 413, 418, and that Congress\n can “legislate on that vast mass of incidental powers which must be\n involved in the constitution,” id., at 421. In determining whether the\n Clause authorizes a particular federal statute, there must be “means\n ends rationality” between the enacted statute and the source of fed\n eral power. Sabri v. United States, 541 U. S. 600, 605. The Constitu\n tion “addresse[s]” the “choice of means” “primarily . . . to the judg\n ment of Congress. If it can be seen that the means adopted are really\n calculated to attain the end, the degree of their necessity, the extent\n to which they conduce to the end, the closeness of the relationship be\n tween the means adopted and the end to be attained, are matters for\n2                   UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    congressional determination alone.” Burroughs v. United States, 290\n    U. S. 534, 547–548. Thus, although the Constitution nowhere grants\n    Congress express power to create federal crimes beyond those specifi\n    cally enumerated, to punish their violation, to imprison violators, to\n    provide appropriately for those imprisoned, or to maintain the secu\n    rity of those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected by the\n    federal imprisonment of others, Congress possesses broad authority\n    to do each of those things under the Clause. Pp. 5–9.\n       (2) Congress has long been involved in the delivery of mental\n    health care to federal prisoners, and has long provided for their civil\n    commitment. See, e.g., Act of Mar. 3, 1855, 10 Stat. 682; Insanity De\n    fense Reform Act of 1984, 18 U. S. C. §§4241–4247. A longstanding\n    history of related federal action does not demonstrate a statute’s con\n    stitutionality, see, e.g., Walz v. Tax Comm’n of City of New York, 397\n    U. S. 664, 678, but can be “helpful in reviewing the substance of a\n    congressional statutory scheme,” Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 21,\n    and, in particular, the reasonableness of the relation between the\n    new statute and pre-existing federal interests. Section 4248 differs\n    from earlier statutes in that it focuses directly upon persons who, due\n    to a mental illness, are sexually dangerous. Many of these individu\n    als, however, were likely already subject to civil commitment under\n    §4246, which, since 1949, has authorized the postsentence detention\n    of federal prisoners who suffer from a mental illness and who are\n    thereby dangerous (whether sexually or otherwise). The similarities\n    between §4246 and §4248 demonstrate that the latter is a modest\n    addition to a longstanding federal statutory framework. Pp. 9–14.\n       (3) There are sound reasons for §4248’s enactment. The Federal\n    Government, as custodian of its prisoners, has the constitutional\n    power to act in order to protect nearby (and other) communities from\n    the danger such prisoners may pose. Moreover, §4248 is “reasonably\n    adapted” to Congress’ power to act as a responsible federal custodian.\n    United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 121. Congress could have rea\n    sonably concluded that federal inmates who suffer from a mental ill\n    ness that causes them to “have serious difficulty in refraining from\n    sexually violent conduct,” §4247(a)(6), would pose an especially high\n    danger to the public if released. And Congress could also have rea\n    sonably concluded that a reasonable number of such individuals\n    would likely not be detained by the States if released from federal\n    custody. Congress’ desire to address these specific challenges, taken\n    together with its responsibilities as a federal custodian, supports the\n    conclusion that §4248 satisfies “review for means-end rationality,”\n    Sabri, supra, at 605. Pp. 14–16.\n       (4) Respondents’ contention that §4248 violates the Tenth Amend\n    ment because it invades the province of state sovereignty in an area\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  typically left to state control is rejected. That Amendment does not\n  “reserve to the States” those powers that are “delegated to the United\n  States by the Constitution,” including the powers delegated by the\n  Necessary and Proper Clause. See, e.g., New York v. United States,\n  505 U. S. 144, 159. And §4248 does not “invade” state sovereignty,\n  but rather requires accommodation of state interests: Among other\n  things, it directs the Attorney General to inform the States where the\n  federal prisoner “is domiciled or was tried” of his detention, §4248(d),\n  and gives either State the right, at any time, to assert its authority\n  over the individual, which will prompt the individual’s immediate\n  transfer to State custody, §4248(d)(1). In Greenwood v. United\n  States, 350 U. S. 366, 375–376, the Court rejected a similar challenge\n  to §4248’s predecessor, the 1949 statute described above. Because\n  the version of the statute at issue in Greenwood was less protective of\n  state interests than §4248, a fortiori, the current statute does not in\n  vade state interests. Pp. 16–18.\n    (5) Section 4248 is narrow in scope. The Court rejects respondents’\n  argument that, when legislating pursuant to the Necessary and\n  Proper Clause, Congress’ authority can be no more than one step re\n  moved from a specifically enumerated power. See, e.g., McCulloch,\n  supra, at 417. Nor will the Court’s holding today confer on Congress\n  a general “police power, which the Founders denied the National\n  Government and reposed in the States.” United States v. Morrison,\n  529 U. S. 598, 618. Section §4248 has been applied to only a small\n  fraction of federal prisoners, and its reach is limited to individuals al\n  ready “in the custody of the” Federal Government, §4248(a). Thus,\n  far from a “general police power,” §4248 is a reasonably adapted and\n  narrowly tailored means of pursuing the Government’s legitimate in\n  terest as a federal custodian in the responsible administration of its\n  prison system. See New York, supra, at 157. Pp. 18–22.\n    The Court does not reach or decide any claim that the statute or its\n  application denies equal protection, procedural or substantive due\n  process, or any other constitutional rights. Respondents are free to\n  pursue those claims on remand, and any others they have preserved.\n  P. 22.\n551 F. 3d 274, reversed and remanded.\n\n   BREYER, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

GRAYDON \n\n           EARL COMSTOCK, JR., ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [May 17, 2010]\n\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  A federal civil-commitment statute authorizes the De\npartment of Justice to detain a mentally ill, sexually\ndangerous federal prisoner beyond the date the prisoner\nwould otherwise be released. 18 U. S. C. §4248. We have\npreviously examined similar statutes enacted under state\nlaw to determine whether they violate the Due Process\nClause. See Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346, 356–358\n(1997); Kansas v. Crane, 534 U. S. 407 (2002). But this\ncase presents a different question. Here we ask whether\nthe Federal Government has the authority under Article I\nof the Constitution to enact this federal civil-commitment\nprogram or whether its doing so falls beyond the reach of a\ngovernment “of enumerated powers.” McCulloch v. Mary\nland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405 (1819). We conclude that the\nConstitution grants Congress the authority to enact §4248\nas “necessary and proper for carrying into Execution” the\npowers “vested by” the “Constitution in the Government of\nthe United States.” Art. I, §8, cl. 18.\n                            I\n  The federal statute before us allows a district court to\n2              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\norder the civil commitment of an individual who is cur\nrently “in the custody of the [Federal] Bureau of Prisons,”\n§4248, if that individual (1) has previously “engaged or\nattempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child\nmolestation,” (2) currently “suffers from a serious mental\nillness, abnormality, or disorder,” and (3) “as a result of”\nthat mental illness, abnormality, or disorder is “sexually\ndangerous to others,” in that “he would have serious diffi\nculty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child\nmolestation if released.” §§4247(a)(5)–(6).\n   In order to detain such a person, the Government (act\ning through the Department of Justice) must certify to a\nfederal district judge that the prisoner meets the condi\ntions just described, i.e., that he has engaged in sexually\nviolent activity or child molestation in the past and that\nhe suffers from a mental illness that makes him corre\nspondingly dangerous to others. §4248(a). When such a\ncertification is filed, the statute automatically stays the\nindividual’s release from prison, ibid., thereby giving the\nGovernment an opportunity to prove its claims at a hear\ning through psychiatric (or other) evidence, §§4247(b)–(c),\n4248(b). The statute provides that the prisoner “shall be\nrepresented by counsel” and shall have “an opportunity” at\nthe hearing “to testify, to present evidence, to subpoena\nwitnesses on his behalf, and to confront and cross\nexamine” the Government’s witnesses. §§4247(d), 4248(c).\n   If the Government proves its claims by “clear and con\nvincing evidence,” the court will order the prisoner’s con\ntinued commitment in “the custody of the Attorney Gen\neral,” who must “make all reasonable efforts to cause” the\nState where that person was tried, or the State where he\nis domiciled, to “assume responsibility for his custody,\ncare, and treatment.” §4248(d); cf. Sullivan v. Freeman,\n944 F. 2d 334, 337 (CA7 1991). If either State is willing to\nassume that responsibility, the Attorney General “shall\nrelease” the individual “to the appropriate official” of that\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nState. §4248(d). But if, “notwithstanding such efforts,\nneither such State will assume such responsibility,” then\n“the Attorney General shall place the person for treatment\nin a suitable [federal] facility.” Ibid.; cf. §4247(i)(A).\n   Confinement in the federal facility will last until either\n(1) the person’s mental condition improves to the point\nwhere he is no longer dangerous (with or without appro\npriate ongoing treatment), in which case he will be re\nleased; or (2) a State assumes responsibility for his cus\ntody, care, and treatment, in which case he will be\ntransferred to the custody of that State. §§4248(d)(1)–(2).\nThe statute establishes a system for ongoing psychiatric\nand judicial review of the individual’s case, including\njudicial hearings at the request of the confined person at\nsix-month intervals. §§4247(e)(1)(B), (h).\n   In November and December 2006, the Government\ninstituted proceedings in the Federal District Court for the\nEastern District of North Carolina against the five re\nspondents in this case. Three of the five had previously\npleaded guilty in federal court to possession of child por\nnography, see 507 F. Supp. 2d 522, 526, and n. 2 (2007);\n§2252A(a), and the fourth had pleaded guilty to sexual\nabuse of a minor, see United States v. Vigil, No.\n1:99CR00509–001 (D NM, Jan. 26, 2000); §§1153, 2243(a).\nWith respect to each of them, the Government claimed\nthat the respondent was about to be released from federal\nprison, that he had engaged in sexually violent conduct or\nchild molestation in the past, and that he suffered from a\nmental illness that made him sexually dangerous to oth\ners. App. 38–40, 44–52. During that same time period,\nthe Government instituted similar proceedings against the\nfifth respondent, who had been charged in federal court\nwith aggravated sexual abuse of a minor, but was found\nmentally incompetent to stand trial. See id., at 41–43;\nUnited States v. Catron, No. 04–778 (D Ariz., Mar. 27,\n2006); §4241(d).\n4              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Each of the five respondents moved to dismiss the civil\ncommitment proceeding on constitutional grounds. They\nclaimed that the commitment proceeding is, in fact, crimi\nnal, not civil, in nature and consequently that it violates\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause, the Ex Post Facto Clause,\nand the Sixth and Eighth Amendments. 507 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 528. They claimed that the statute denies them sub\nstantive due process and equal protection of the laws.\nIbid. They claimed that it violates their procedural due\nprocess rights by allowing a showing of sexual dangerous\nness to be made by clear and convincing evidence, instead\nof by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Ibid. And, finally,\nthey claimed that, in enacting the statute, Congress ex\nceeded the powers granted to it by Art. I, §8 of the Consti\ntution, including those granted by the Commerce Clause\nand the Necessary and Proper Clause. 507 F. Supp. 2d, at\n528–529.\n   The District Court, accepting two of the respondents’\nclaims, granted their motion to dismiss. It agreed with\nrespondents that the Constitution requires proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt, id., at 551–559 (citing In re Winship,\n397 U. S. 358 (1970)), and it agreed that, in enacting the\nstatute, Congress exceeded its Article I legislative powers,\n507 F. Supp. 2d, at 530–551. On appeal, the Court of\nAppeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the dismissal on\nthis latter, legislative-power ground. 551 F. 3d 274, 278–\n284 (2009). It did not decide the standard-of-proof ques\ntion, nor did it address any of respondents’ other constitu\ntional challenges. Id., at 276, n. 1.\n   The Government sought certiorari, and we granted its\nrequest, limited to the question of Congress’ authority\nunder Art. I, §8 of the Constitution. Pet. for Cert. i. Since\nthen, two other Courts of Appeals have considered that\nsame question, each deciding it in the Government’s favor,\nthereby creating a split of authority among the Circuits.\nSee United States v. Volungus, 595 F. 3d 1 (CA1 2010);\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nUnited States v. Tom, 565 F. 3d 497 (CA8 2009).\n                               II\n   The question presented is whether the Necessary and\nProper Clause, Art. I, §8, cl. 18, grants Congress authority\nsufficient to enact the statute before us. In resolving that\nquestion, we assume, but we do not decide, that other\nprovisions of the Constitution—such as the Due Process\nClause—do not prohibit civil commitment in these circum\nstances. Cf. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346; Addington v. Texas,\n441 U. S. 418 (1979). In other words, we assume for ar\ngument’s sake that the Federal Constitution would permit\na State to enact this statute, and we ask solely whether\nthe Federal Government, exercising its enumerated pow\ners, may enact such a statute as well. On that assump\ntion, we conclude that the Constitution grants Congress\nlegislative power sufficient to enact §4248. We base this\nconclusion on five considerations, taken together.\n   First, the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress\nbroad authority to enact federal legislation. Nearly 200\nyears ago, this Court stated that the Federal “[G]overn\nment is acknowledged by all to be one of enumerated\npowers,” McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 405, which means that\n“[e]very law enacted by Congress must be based on one or\nmore of” those powers, United States v. Morrison, 529\nU. S. 598, 607 (2000). But, at the same time, “a govern\nment, entrusted with such” powers “must also be en\ntrusted with ample means for their execution.”\nMcCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 408. Accordingly, the Necessary\nand Proper Clause makes clear that the Constitution’s\ngrants of specific federal legislative authority are accom\npanied by broad power to enact laws that are “convenient,\nor useful” or “conducive” to the authority’s “beneficial\nexercise.” Id., at 413, 418; see also id., at 421 (“[Congress\ncan] legislate on that vast mass of incidental powers which\nmust be involved in the constitution . . .”). Chief Justice\n6              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMarshall emphasized that the word “necessary” does not\nmean “absolutely necessary.” Id., at 413–415 (emphasis\ndeleted); Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U. S. 456, 462\n(2003) (“[W]e long ago rejected the view that the Neces\nsary and Proper Clause demands that an Act of Congress\nbe ‘ “absolutely necessary” ’ to the exercise of an enumer\nated power”). In language that has come to define the\nscope of the Necessary and Proper Clause, he wrote:\n    “Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of\n    the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,\n    which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not\n    prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the\n    constitution, are constitutional.” McCulloch, supra, at\n    421.\n   We have since made clear that, in determining whether\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress the\nlegislative authority to enact a particular federal statute,\nwe look to see whether the statute constitutes a means\nthat is rationally related to the implementation of a con\nstitutionally enumerated power. Sabri v. United States,\n541 U. S. 600, 605 (2004) (using term “means-ends ration\nality” to describe the necessary relationship); ibid. (up\nholding Congress’ “authority under the Necessary and\nProper Clause” to enact a criminal statute in furtherance\nof the federal power granted by the Spending Clause); see\nGonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 22 (2005) (holding that\nbecause “Congress had a rational basis” for concluding\nthat a statute implements Commerce Clause power, the\nstatute falls within the scope of congressional “authority to\n‘make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper’ to\n‘regulate Commerce . . . among the several States’ ” (ellip\nsis in original)); see also United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S.\n549, 557 (1995); Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Rec\nlamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 276 (1981).\n   Of course, as Chief Justice Marshall stated, a federal\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)              7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute, in addition to being authorized by Art. I, §8, must\nalso “not [be] prohibited” by the Constitution. McCulloch,\nsupra, at 421. But as we have already stated, the present\nstatute’s validity under provisions of the Constitution\nother than the Necessary and Proper Clause is an issue\nthat is not before us. Under the question presented, the\nrelevant inquiry is simply “whether the means chosen are\n‘reasonably adapted’ to the attainment of a legitimate end\nunder the commerce power” or under other powers that\nthe Constitution grants Congress the authority to imple\nment. Gonzales, supra, at 37 (SCALIA, J., concurring in\njudgment) (quoting United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100,\n121 (1941)).\n   We have also recognized that the Constitution “ad\ndresse[s]” the “choice of means”\n    “primarily . . . to the judgment of Congress. If it can\n    be seen that the means adopted are really calculated\n    to attain the end, the degree of their necessity, the ex\n    tent to which they conduce to the end, the closeness of\n    the relationship between the means adopted and the\n    end to be attained, are matters for congressional de\n    termination alone.” Burroughs v. United States, 290\n    U. S. 534, 547–548 (1934).\nSee also Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 355 (1903) (“[T]he\nConstitution . . . . leaves to Congress a large discretion as\nto the means that may be employed in executing a given\npower”); Morrison, supra, at 607 (applying a “presumption\nof constitutionality” when examining the scope of Con\ngressional power); McCulloch, supra, at 410, 421.\n   Thus, the Constitution, which nowhere speaks explicitly\nabout the creation of federal crimes beyond those related\nto “counterfeiting,” “treason,” or “Piracies and Felonies\ncommitted on the high Seas” or “against the Law of Na\ntions,” Art. I, §8, cls. 6, 10; Art. III, §3, nonetheless grants\nCongress broad authority to create such crimes. See\n8               UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nMcCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 416 (“All admit that the govern\nment may, legitimately, punish any violation of its laws;\nand yet, this is not among the enumerated powers of\nCongress”); see also United States v. Fox, 95 U. S. 670, 672\n(1878). And Congress routinely exercises its authority to\nenact criminal laws in furtherance of, for example, its\nenumerated powers to regulate interstate and foreign\ncommerce, to enforce civil rights, to spend funds for the\ngeneral welfare, to establish federal courts, to establish\npost offices, to regulate bankruptcy, to regulate naturali\nzation, and so forth. Art. I, §8, cls. 1, 3, 4, 7, 9; Amdts. 13–\n15. See, e.g., Lottery Case, supra (upholding criminal\nstatute enacted in furtherance of the Commerce Clause);\nEx parte Yarbrough, 110 U. S. 651 (1884) (upholding\nCongress’ authority to enact Rev. Stat. §5508, currently 18\nU. S. C. §241 (criminalizing civil-rights violations) and\nRev. Stat. §5520, currently 42 U. S. C. §1973j (criminaliz\ning voting-rights violations) in furtherance of the Four\nteenth and Fifteenth Amendments); Sabri, supra, (uphold\ning criminal statute enacted in furtherance of the\nSpending Clause); Jinks, supra, at 462, n. 2 (citing\nMcCulloch, supra, at 417) (describing perjury and witness\ntampering as federal crimes enacted in furtherance of the\npower to constitute federal tribunals); see also 18 U. S. C.\n§1691 et seq. (postal crimes); §151 et seq. (bankruptcy\ncrimes); 8 U. S. C. §§1324–1328 (immigration crimes).\n   Similarly, Congress, in order to help ensure the en\nforcement of federal criminal laws enacted in furtherance\nof its enumerated powers, “can cause a prison to be erected\nat any place within the jurisdiction of the United States,\nand direct that all persons sentenced to imprisonment\nunder the laws of the United States shall be confined\nthere.” Ex parte Karstendick, 93 U. S. 396, 400 (1876).\nMoreover, Congress, having established a prison system,\ncan enact laws that seek to ensure that system’s safe and\nresponsible administration by, for example, requiring\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprisoners to receive medical care and educational training,\nsee, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §§4005–4006; §4042(a)(3), and can\nalso ensure the safety of the prisoners, prison workers and\nvisitors, and those in surrounding communities by, for\nexample, creating further criminal laws governing entry,\nexit, and smuggling, and by employing prison guards to\nensure discipline and security. See, e.g., §1791 (prohibit\ning smuggling contraband); §751 et seq. (prohibiting es\ncape and abetting thereof); 28 CFR §541.10 et seq. (2009)\n(inmate discipline).\n   Neither Congress’ power to criminalize conduct, nor its\npower to imprison individuals who engage in that conduct,\nnor its power to enact laws governing prisons and prison\ners, is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. But Con\ngress nonetheless possesses broad authority to do each of\nthose things in the course of “carrying into Execution” the\nenumerated powers “vested by” the “Constitution in the\nGovernment of the United States,” Art. I, §8, cl. 18—\nauthority granted by the Necessary and Proper Clause.\n   Second, the civil-commitment statute before us consti\ntutes a modest addition to a set of federal prison-related\nmental-health statutes that have existed for many dec\nades. We recognize that even a longstanding history of\nrelated federal action does not demonstrate a statute’s\nconstitutionality. See, e.g., Walz v. Tax Comm’n of City of\nNew York, 397 U. S. 664, 678 (1970) (“[N]o one acquires a\nvested or protected right in violation of the Constitution by\nlong use . . .”); cf. Morrison, 529 U. S., at 612–614 (legisla\ntive history is neither necessary nor sufficient with respect\nto Art. I analysis). A history of involvement, however, can\nnonetheless be “helpful in reviewing the substance of a\ncongressional statutory scheme,” Gonzales, 545 U. S., at\n21; Walz, supra, at 678, and, in particular, the reason\nableness of the relation between the new statute and pre\nexisting federal interests.\n   Here, Congress has long been involved in the delivery of\n10              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmental health care to federal prisoners, and has long\nprovided for their civil commitment. In 1855 it estab\nlished Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital in the District of Colum\nbia to provide treatment to “the insane of the army and\nnavy . . . and of the District of Columbia.” Act of Mar. 3,\n1855, 10 Stat. 682; 39 Stat. 309. In 1857 it provided for\nconfinement at Saint Elizabeth’s of any person within the\nDistrict of Columbia who had been “charged with [a]\ncrime” and who was “insane” or later became “insane\nduring the continuance of his or her sentence in the\nUnited States penitentiary.” Act of Feb. 7, 1857, §§5–6, 11\nStat. 158; see 17 Op. Atty. Gen. 211, 212–213 (1881). In\n1874, expanding the geographic scope of its statutes,\nCongress provided for civil commitment in federal facili\nties (or in state facilities if a State so agreed) of “all per\nsons who have been or shall be convicted of any offense in\nany court of the United States” and who are or “shall\nbecome” insane “during the term of their imprisonment.”\nAct of June 23, 1874, ch. 465, 18 Stat. 251 (emphasis\nadded). And in 1882 Congress provided for similar com\nmitment of those “charged” with federal offenses who\nbecome “insane” while in the “custody” of the United\nStates. Act of Aug. 7, 1882, 22 Stat. 330 (emphasis\nadded). Thus, over the span of three decades, Congress\ncreated a national, federal civil-commitment program\nunder which any person who was either charged with or\nconvicted of any federal offense in any federal court could\nbe confined in a federal mental institution.\n   These statutes did not raise the question presented\nhere, for they all provided that commitment in a federal\nhospital would end upon the completion of the relevant\n“terms” of federal “imprisonment” as set forth in the un\nderlying criminal sentence or statute. §§2–3, 18 Stat. 252;\nsee 35 Op. Atty. Gen. 366, 368 (1927); cf. 30 Op. Atty. Gen.\n569, 571 (1916). But in the mid-1940’s that proviso was\neliminated.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  In 1945 the Judicial Conference of the United States\nproposed legislative reforms of the federal civil\ncommitment system. The Judicial Conference based its\nproposals upon what this Court has described as a “long\nstudy by a conspicuously able committee” (chaired by\nJudge Calvert Magruder and whose members included\nJudge Learned Hand), involving consultation “with federal\ndistrict and circuit judges” across the country as well as\nwith the Department of Justice. Greenwood v. United\nStates, 350 U. S. 366, 373 (1956); Greenwood v. United\nStates, 219 F. 2d 376, 380–384 (CA8 1955) (describing the\ncommittee’s work). The committee studied, among other\nthings, the “serious problem faced by the Bureau of Pris\nons, namely, what to do with insane criminals upon the\nexpiration of their terms of confinement, where it would be\ndangerous to turn them loose upon society and where no\nstate will assume responsibility for their custody.” Judi\ncial Conference, Report of Committee to Study Treatment\nAccorded by Federal Courts to Insane Persons Charged\nwith Crime 11 (1945) (hereinafter Committee Report),\nApp. 73. The committee provided examples of instances in\nwhich the Bureau of Prisons had struggled with the prob\nlem of “ ‘paranoid’ ” and “ ‘threatening’ ” individuals whom\nno State would accept. Id., at 9, App. 71. And it noted\nthat, in the Bureau’s “[e]xperience,” States would not\naccept an “appreciable number” of “mental[ly] incompe\ntent” individuals “nearing expiration” of their prison\nterms, because of their “lack of legal residence in any\nState,” even though those individuals “ought not . . . be at\nlarge because they constitute a menace to public safety.”\nH. R. Rep. No. 1319, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1949) (state\nment of James V. Bennett, Director); see also Letter from\nBennett to Judge Magruder, attachment to Committee\nReport, App. 83–88. The committee, hence the Judicial\nConference, therefore recommended that Congress enact\n“some provision of law authorizing the continued confine\n12               UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nment of such persons after their sentences expired.”\nCommittee Report 11, App. 73; see also Report of the\nJudicial Conference of Senior Circuit Judges 13 (1945).\n  Between 1948 and 1949, following its receipt of the\nJudicial Conference report, Congress modified the law.\nSee Act of June 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 855, 18 U. S. C. §§4241–\n4243 (1952 ed.); Act of Sept. 7, 1949, 63 Stat. 686, 18\nU. S. C. §§4244–4248. It provided for the civil commit\nment of individuals who are, or who become, mentally\nincompetent at any time after their arrest and before the\nexpiration of their federal sentence, §§4241, 4244, 4247–\n4248; and it set forth various procedural safeguards,\n§§4242, 4246, 4247. With respect to an individual whose\nprison term is about to expire, it specified the following:\n        “Whenever the Director of the Bureau of Prisons\n     shall certify that a prisoner whose sentence is about to\n     expire has been examined [and] . . . in the judgment of\n     the Director and the board of examiners the prisoner\n     is insane or mentally incompetent, and . . . if released\n     he will probably endanger the safety of the officers,\n     the property, or other interests of the United States,\n     and that suitable arrangements for the custody and\n     care of the prisoner are not otherwise available, the\n     Attorney General shall transmit the certificate to . . .\n     the court for the district in which the prisoner is con\n     fined. Whereupon the court shall cause the prisoner\n     to be examined . . . and shall . . . hold a hearing . . . . If\n     upon such hearing the court shall determine that the\n     conditions specified above exist, the court may commit\n     the prisoner to the custody of the Attorney General or\n     his authorized representative.” §4247.\nThe precondition that the mentally ill individual’s release\nwould “probably endanger the safety of the officers, the\nproperty, or other interests of the United States” was\nuniformly interpreted by the Judiciary to mean that his\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“release would endanger the safety of persons, property or\nthe public interest in general—not merely the interests\npeculiar to the United States as such.” United States v.\nCurry, 410 F. 2d 1372, 1374 (CA4 1969); see also Royal v.\nUnited States, 274 F. 2d 846, 851–852 (CA10 1960).\n  In 1984, Congress modified these basic statutes. See\nInsanity Defense Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 2057, 18\nU. S. C. §§4241–4247 (2006 ed.). As relevant here, it\naltered the provision just discussed, regarding the pris\noner’s danger to the “interests of the United States,” to\nconform more closely to the then-existing judicial interpre\ntation of that language, i.e., it altered the language so as\nto authorize (explicitly) civil commitment if, in addition to\nthe other conditions, the prisoner’s “release would create a\nsubstantial risk of bodily injury to another person or\nserious damage to the property of another.” §4246(d).\n  Congress also elaborated upon the required condition\n“that suitable arrangements . . . are not otherwise avail\nable” by directing the Attorney General to seek alternative\nplacement in state facilities, as we have set forth above.\nSee ibid.; supra, at 2–3. With these modifications, the\nstatutes continue to authorize the civil commitment of\nindividuals who are both mentally ill and dangerous, once\nthey have been charged with, or convicted of, a federal\ncrime. §§4241(d), 4246; see also §4243(d). They continue\nto provide for the continued civil commitment of those\nindividuals when they are “due for release” from federal\ncustody because their “sentence is about to expire.” §4246.\nAnd, as we have previously set forth, they establish vari\nous procedural and other requirements. E.g., §4247.\n  In 2006, Congress enacted the particular statute before\nus. §302, 120 Stat. 619, 18 U. S. C. §4248. It differs from\nearlier statutes in that it focuses directly upon persons\nwho, due to a mental illness, are sexually dangerous.\nNotably, many of these individuals were likely already\nsubject to civil commitment under §4246, which, since\n14             UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n1949, has authorized the postsentence detention of federal\nprisoners who suffer from a mental illness and who are\nthereby dangerous (whether sexually or otherwise). But\ncf. H. R. Rep. No. 109–218, pt. 1, p. 29 (2005). Aside from\nits specific focus on sexually dangerous persons, §4248 is\nsimilar to the provisions first enacted in 1949. Cf. §4246.\nIn that respect, it is a modest addition to a longstanding\nfederal statutory framework, which has been in place\nsince 1855.\n   Third, Congress reasonably extended its longstanding\ncivil-commitment system to cover mentally ill and sexually\ndangerous persons who are already in federal custody,\neven if doing so detains them beyond the termination of\ntheir criminal sentence. For one thing, the Federal Gov\nernment is the custodian of its prisoners. As federal cus\ntodian, it has the constitutional power to act in order to\nprotect nearby (and other) communities from the danger\nfederal prisoners may pose. Cf. Youngberg v. Romeo, 457\nU. S. 307, 320 (1982) (“In operating an institution such as\n[a prison system], there are occasions in which it is neces\nsary for the State to restrain the movement of residents—\nfor example, to protect them as well as others from vio\nlence” (emphasis added)). Indeed, at common law, one\n“who takes charge of a third person” is “under a duty to\nexercise reasonable care to control” that person to prevent\nhim from causing reasonably foreseeable “bodily harm to\nothers.”    Restatement (Second) of Torts §319, p. 129\n(1963–1964); see Volungus, 595 F. 3d, at 7–8 (citing cases);\nsee also United States v. S. A., 129 F. 3d 995, 999 (CA8\n1997) (“[Congress enacted §4246] to avert the public dan\nger likely to ensue from the release of mentally ill and\ndangerous detainees”). If a federal prisoner is infected\nwith a communicable disease that threatens others, surely\nit would be “necessary and proper” for the Federal Gov\nernment to take action, pursuant to its role as federal\ncustodian, to refuse (at least until the threat diminishes)\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto release that individual among the general public, where\nhe might infect others (even if not threatening an inter\nstate epidemic, cf. Art. I, §8, cl. 3). And if confinement of\nsuch an individual is a “necessary and proper” thing to do,\nthen how could it not be similarly “necessary and proper”\nto confine an individual whose mental illness threatens\nothers to the same degree?\n   Moreover, §4248 is “reasonably adapted,” Darby, 312\nU. S., at 121, to Congress’ power to act as a responsible\nfederal custodian (a power that rests, in turn, upon federal\ncriminal statutes that legitimately seek to implement\nconstitutionally enumerated authority, see supra, at 7–8).\nCongress could have reasonably concluded that federal\ninmates who suffer from a mental illness that causes them\nto “have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually\nviolent conduct,” §4247(a)(6), would pose an especially\nhigh danger to the public if released. Cf. H. R. Rep. No.\n109–218, at 22–23. And Congress could also have rea\nsonably concluded (as detailed in the Judicial Conference’s\nreport) that a reasonable number of such individuals\nwould likely not be detained by the States if released from\nfederal custody, in part because the Federal Government\nitself severed their claim to “legal residence in any State”\nby incarcerating them in remote federal prisons. H. R.\nRep. No. 1319, at 2; Committee Report 7–11, App. 69–75;\ncf. post, at 6 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment). Here\nCongress’ desire to address the specific challenges identi\nfied in the Reports cited above, taken together with its\nresponsibilities as a federal custodian, supports the con\nclusion that §4248 satisfies “review for means-end ration\nality,” i.e., that it satisfies the Constitution’s insistence\nthat a federal statute represent a rational means for im\nplementing a constitutional grant of legislative authority.\nSabri, 541 U. S., at 605 (citing McCulloch, 4 Wheat. 316).\nSee Jinks, 538 U. S., at 462–463 (opinion for the Court by\nSCALIA, J.) (holding that a statute is authorized by the\n16              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nNecessary and Proper Clause when it “provides an alter\nnative to [otherwise] unsatisfactory options” that are\n“obviously inefficient”).\n   Fourth, the statute properly accounts for state interests.\nRespondents and the dissent contend that §4248 violates\nthe Tenth Amendment because it “invades the province of\nstate sovereignty” in an area typically left to state control.\nNew York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 155 (1992); see\nBrief for Respondents 35–47; post, at 7–8, 19–23 (THOMAS,\nJ., dissenting). See also Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U. S. 715,\n736 (1972) (“The States have traditionally exercised broad\npower to commit persons found to be mentally ill”). But\nthe Tenth Amendment’s text is clear: “The powers not\ndelegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor\nprohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States\nrespectively, or to the people.” (Emphasis added.) The\npowers “delegated to the United States by the Constitu\ntion” include those specifically enumerated powers listed\nin Article I along with the implementation authority\ngranted by the Necessary and Proper Clause. Virtually by\ndefinition, these powers are not powers that the Constitu\ntion “reserved to the States.” See New York, supra, at 156,\n159 (“[I]f a power is delegated to Congress in the Constitu\ntion, the Tenth Amendment expressly disclaims any res\nervation of that power to the States . . . .” “In the end . . .\nit makes no difference whether one views the question at\nissue in these cases as one of ascertaining the limits of the\npower delegated to the Federal Government under the\naffirmative provisions of the Constitution or one of dis\ncerning the core of sovereignty retained by the States\nunder the Tenth Amendment”); Darby, supra, at 123–124;\nsee also Hodel, 452 U. S., at 276–277, 281; Maryland v.\nWirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 195–196 (1968); Lambert v. Yellow\nley, 272 U. S. 581, 596 (1926).\n   Nor does this statute invade state sovereignty or other\nwise improperly limit the scope of “powers that remain\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwith the States.” Post, at 7 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). To\nthe contrary, it requires accommodation of state interests:\nThe Attorney General must inform the State in which the\nfederal prisoner “is domiciled or was tried” that he is\ndetaining someone with respect to whom those States may\nwish to assert their authority, and he must encourage\nthose States to assume custody of the individual.\n§4248(d). He must also immediately “release” that person\n“to the appropriate official of” either State “if such State\nwill assume [such] responsibility.” Ibid. And either State\nhas the right, at any time, to assert its authority over the\nindividual, which will prompt the individual’s immediate\ntransfer to State custody. §4248(d)(1). Respondents con\ntend that the States are nonetheless “powerless to prevent\nthe detention of their citizens under §4248, even if deten\ntion is contrary to the States’ policy choices.” Brief for\nRespondents 11 (emphasis added). But that is not the\nmost natural reading of the statute, see §§4248(d)(1)–(e),\nand the Solicitor General acknowledges that “the Federal\nGovernment would have no appropriate role” with respect\nto an individual covered by the statute once “the transfer\nto State responsibility and State control has occurred.” Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 9.\n   In Greenwood, 350 U. S. 366, the Court rejected a chal\nlenge to the current statute’s predecessor—i.e., to the 1949\nstatute we described above, supra, at 11–12. The petition\ners in that case claimed, like the respondents here, that\nthe statute improperly interfered with state sovereignty.\nSee Brief for Petitioner in Greenwood v. United States,\nO. T. 1955, No. 460, pp. 2, 18–29. But the Court rejected\nthat argument. See Greenwood, supra, at 375–376. And\nthe version of the statute at issue in Greenwood was less\nprotective of state interests than the current statute. That\nstatute authorized federal custody so long as “suitable\narrangements” were “not otherwise available” in a State or\notherwise. 63 Stat. 687 (emphasis added). Cf. Brief for\n18              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nPetitioner in Greenwood, supra, at 25 (“What has really\nhappened is that the Federal government has been dissat\nisfied with the care given by the states to those mentally\nincompetent who have been released by the Federal au\nthorities”). Here, by contrast, as we have explained, §4248\nrequires the Attorney General to encourage the relevant\nStates to take custody of the individual without inquiring\ninto the “suitability” of their intended care or treatment,\nand to relinquish federal authority whenever a State\nasserts its own. §4248(d). Thus, if the statute at issue in\nGreenwood did not invade state interests, then, a fortiori,\nneither does §4248.\n   Fifth, the links between §4248 and an enumerated\nArticle I power are not too attenuated. Neither is the\nstatutory provision too sweeping in its scope. Invoking the\ncautionary instruction that we may not “pile inference\nupon inference” in order to sustain congressional action\nunder Article I, Lopez, 514 U. S., at 567, respondents\nargue that, when legislating pursuant to the Necessary\nand Proper Clause, Congress’ authority can be no more\nthan one step removed from a specifically enumerated\npower. See Brief for Respondents 21–22; Tr. of Oral Arg.\n27–28. But this argument is irreconcilable with our prece\ndents. Again, take Greenwood as an example. In that\ncase we upheld the (likely indefinite) civil commitment of\na mentally incompetent federal defendant who was ac\ncused of robbing a United States Post Office. 350 U. S., at\n369, 375. The underlying enumerated Article I power was\nthe power to “Establish Post Offices and Post Roads.”\nArt. I, §8, cl. 7. But, as Chief Justice Marshall recognized\nin McCulloch,\n     “the power ‘to establish post offices and post roads’\n     . . . is executed by the single act of making the estab\n     lishment. . . . [F]rom this has been inferred the power\n     and duty of carrying the mail along the post road,\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    from one post office to another.          And, from\n    this implied power, has again been inferred the right\n    to punish those who steal letters from the post office,\n    or rob the mail.” 4 Wheat., at 417 (emphasis added).\nAnd, as we have explained, from the implied power to\npunish we have further inferred both the power to im\nprison, see supra, at 8–9, and, in Greenwood, the federal\ncivil-commitment power.\n   Our necessary and proper jurisprudence contains multi\nple examples of similar reasoning. For example, in Sabri\nwe observed that “Congress has authority under the\nSpending Clause to appropriate federal moneys” and that\nit therefore “has corresponding authority under the Neces\nsary and Proper Clause to see to it that taxpayer dollars”\nare not “siphoned off” by “corrupt public officers.” 541\nU. S., at 605 (citation omitted). We then further held that,\nin aid of that implied power to criminalize graft of “tax\npayer dollars,” Congress has the additional prophylactic\npower to criminalize bribes or kickbacks even when the\nstolen funds have not been “traceably skimmed from\nspecific federal payments.” Ibid. Similarly, in United\nStates v. Hall, 98 U. S. 343 (1879), we held that the Neces\nsary and Proper Clause grants Congress the power, in\nfurtherance of Art. I, §8, cls. 11–13, to award “pensions to\nthe wounded and disabled” soldiers of the armed forces\nand their dependents, 98 U. S. at 351; and from that im\nplied power we further inferred the “[i]mplied power” “to\npass laws to . . . punish” anyone who fraudulently appro\npriated such pensions, id., at 346. See also Stewart v.\nKahn, 11 Wall. 493, 506–507 (1871).\n   Indeed even the dissent acknowledges that Congress\nhas the implied power to criminalize any conduct that\nmight interfere with the exercise of an enumerated power,\nand also the additional power to imprison people who\nviolate those (inferentially authorized) laws, and the\n20              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nadditional power to provide for the safe and reasonable\nmanagement of those prisons, and the additional power to\nregulate the prisoners’ behavior even after their release.\nSee post, at 12–13, 17, n. 11. Of course, each of those\npowers, like the powers addressed in Sabri, Hall, and\nMcCulloch, is ultimately “derived from” an enumerated\npower, Hall, supra, at 345. And, as the dissent agrees,\nthat enumerated power is “the enumerated power that\njustifies the defendant’s statute of conviction,” post, at 17,\nn. 11. Neither we nor the dissent can point to a single\nspecific enumerated power “that justifies a criminal de\nfendant’s arrest or conviction,” post, at 12, in all cases\nbecause Congress relies on different enumerated powers\n(often, but not exclusively, its Commerce Clause power) to\nenact its various federal criminal statutes, see supra, at 7–\n8. But every such statute must itself be legitimately\npredicated on an enumerated power. And the same enu\nmerated power that justifies the creation of a federal\ncriminal statute, and that justifies the additional implied\nfederal powers that the dissent considers legitimate, justi\nfies civil commitment under §4248 as well. See supra, at\n14–16. Thus, we must reject respondents’ argument that\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause permits no more than a\nsingle step between an enumerated power and an Act of\nCongress.\n   Nor need we fear that our holding today confers on\nCongress a general “police power, which the Founders\ndenied the National Government and reposed in the\nStates.” Morrison, 529 U. S., at 618. As the Solicitor\nGeneral repeatedly confirmed at oral argument, §4248 is\nnarrow in scope. It has been applied to only a small frac\ntion of federal prisoners. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 24–25 (105\nindividuals have been subject to §4248 out of over 188,000\nfederal inmates); see also Dept. of Justice, Bureau of\nJustice Statistics, W. Sabol, H. West, & M.

S., at 157.\nThe Framers demonstrated considerable foresight in\ndrafting a Constitution capable of such resilience through\ntime. As Chief Justice Marshall observed nearly 200 years\nago, the Necessary and Proper Clause is part of “a consti\ntution intended to endure for ages to come, and, conse\nquently, to be adapted to the various crises of human\naffairs.” McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 415 (emphasis deleted).\n22              UNITED STATES v.

They in\nclude: (1) the breadth of the Necessary and Proper Clause,\n(2) the long history of federal involvement in this arena,\n(3) the sound reasons for the statute’s enactment in light\nof the Government’s custodial interest in safeguarding the\npublic from dangers posed by those in federal custody, (4)\nthe statute’s accommodation of state interests, and (5) the\nstatute’s narrow scope. Taken together, these considera\ntions lead us to conclude that the statute is a “necessary\nand proper” means of exercising the federal authority that\npermits Congress to create federal criminal laws, to pun\nish their violation, to imprison violators, to provide appro\npriately for those imprisoned, and to maintain the security\nof those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected\nby the federal imprisonment of others. The Constitution\nconsequently authorizes Congress to enact the statute.\n   We do not reach or decide any claim that the statute or\nits application denies equal protection of the laws, proce\ndural or substantive due process, or any other rights\nguaranteed by the Constitution. Respondents are free to\npursue those claims on remand, and any others they have\npreserved.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit with respect to Congress’ power to enact this stat\nute is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

S. C. §4248 are necessary and\nproper exercises of congressional authority.\n   Respondents argue that congressional authority under\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause can be no more than one\nstep removed from an enumerated power. This is incor\nrect. When the inquiry is whether a federal law has suffi\ncient links to an enumerated power to be within the scope\nof federal authority, the analysis depends not on the num\nber of links in the congressional-power chain but on the\nstrength of the chain.\n   Concluding that a relation can be put into a verbal\nformulation that fits somewhere along a causal chain of\nfederal powers is merely the beginning, not the end, of the\nconstitutional inquiry. See United States v. Lopez, 514\nU. S. 549, 566–567 (1995). The inferences must be con\ntrolled by some limitations lest, as Thomas Jefferson\nwarned, congressional powers become completely un\nbounded by linking one power to another ad infinitum in a\nveritable game of “ ‘this is the house that Jack built.’ ”\nLetter from Thomas Jefferson to Edward Livingston (Apr.\n30, 1800), 31 The Papers of Thomas Jefferson 547 (B.\nOberg ed. 2004); see also United States v. Patton, 451\nF. 3d 615, 628 (CA10 2006).\n2               UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n               KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   This separate writing serves two purposes. The first is\nto withhold assent from certain statements and proposi\ntions of the Court’s opinion. The second is to caution that\nthe Constitution does require the invalidation of congres\nsional attempts to extend federal powers in some\ninstances.\n                               I\n   The Court concludes that, when determining whether\nCongress has the authority to enact a specific law under\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause, we look “to see whether\nthe statute constitutes a means that is rationally related\nto the implementation of a constitutionally enumerated\npower.” Ante, at 6 (suggesting that Sabri v. United States,\n541 U. S. 600, 605 (2004), adopts a “means-ends rational\nity” test).\n   The terms “rationally related” and “rational basis” must\nbe employed with care, particularly if either is to be used\nas a stand-alone test. The phrase “rational basis” most\noften is employed to describe the standard for determining\nwhether legislation that does not proscribe fundamental\nliberties nonetheless violates the Due Process Clause.\nReferring to this due process inquiry, and in what must be\none of the most deferential formulations of the standard\nfor reviewing legislation in all the Court’s precedents, the\nCourt has said: “But the law need not be in every respect\nlogically consistent with its aims to be constitutional. It is\nenough that there is an evil at hand for correction, and\nthat it might be thought that the particular legislative\nmeasure was a rational way to correct it.” Williamson v.\nLee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 487–488 (1955).\nThis formulation was in a case presenting a due process\nchallenge and a challenge to a State’s exercise of its own\npowers, powers not confined by the principles that control\nthe limited nature of our National Government. The\nphrase, then, should not be extended uncritically to the\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n               KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\n\nissue before us.\n    The operative constitutional provision in this case is the\nNecessary and Proper Clause. This Court has not held\nthat the Lee Optical test, asking if “it might be thought\nthat the particular legislative measure was a rational way\nto correct” an evil, is the proper test in this context.\nRather, under the Necessary and Proper Clause, applica\ntion of a “rational basis” test should be at least as exacting\nas it has been in the Commerce Clause cases, if not more\nso. Indeed, the cases the Court cites in the portion of its\nopinion referring to “rational basis” are predominantly\nCommerce Clause cases, and none are due process cases.\nSee ante, at 6 (citing Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1 (2005);\nLopez, supra; Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recla\nmation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 276 (1981)).\n    There is an important difference between the two ques\ntions, but the Court does not make this distinction clear.\nRaich, Lopez, and Hodel were all Commerce Clause cases.\nThose precedents require a tangible link to commerce, not\na mere conceivable rational relation, as in Lee Optical.\n“ ‘[S]imply because Congress may conclude that a particu\nlar activity substantially affects interstate commerce does\nnot necessarily make it so.’ ” Lopez, supra, at 557, n. 2\n(quoting Hodel, supra, at 311 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in\njudgment)). The rational basis referred to in the Com\nmerce Clause context is a demonstrated link in fact, based\non empirical demonstration. While undoubtedly deferen\ntial, this may well be different from the rational-basis test\nas Lee Optical described it.\n    The Court relies on Sabri, supra, for its conclusion that\na “means-ends rationality” is all that is required for a\npower to come within the Necessary and Proper Clause’s\nreach. See ante, at 6. Sabri only refers to “means-ends\nrationality” in a parenthetical describing the holding in\nMcCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819); it certainly\ndid not import the Lee Optical rational-basis test into this\n4              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n              KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\n\narena through such a parenthetical. See Sabri, supra, at\n612 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (“A statute can\nhave a ‘rational’ connection to an enumerated power with\nout being obviously or clearly tied to that enumerated\npower”). It should be remembered, moreover, that the\nspending power is not designated as such in the Constitu\ntion but rather is implied from the power to lay and collect\ntaxes and other specified exactions in order, among other\npurposes, “to pay the Debts and provide for the common\nDefence and general Welfare of the United States.” Art. I,\n§8, cl. 1; see South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 206\n(1987). The limits upon the spending power have not been\nmuch discussed, but if the relevant standard is parallel to\nthe Commerce Clause cases, then the limits and the ana\nlytic approach in those precedents should be respected.\n   A separate concern stems from the Court’s explanation\nof the Tenth Amendment. Ante, at 16. I had thought it a\nbasic principle that the powers reserved to the States\nconsist of the whole, undefined residuum of power remain\ning after taking account of powers granted to the National\nGovernment. The Constitution delegates limited powers\nto the National Government and then reserves the re\nmainder for the States (or the people), not the other way\naround, as the Court’s analysis suggests. And the powers\nreserved to the States are so broad that they remain unde\nfined. Residual power, sometimes referred to (perhaps\nimperfectly) as the police power, belongs to the States and\nthe States alone.\n   It is correct in one sense to say that if the National\nGovernment has the power to act under the Necessary and\nProper Clause then that power is not one reserved to the\nStates. But the precepts of federalism embodied in the\nConstitution inform which powers are properly exercised\nby the National Government in the first place. See Lopez,\n514 U. S., at 580–581 (KENNEDY, J., concurring); see also\nMcCulloch, supra, at 421 (powers “consist[ent] with the\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             5\n\n               KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\n\nletter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional”). It\nis of fundamental importance to consider whether essen\ntial attributes of state sovereignty are compromised by the\nassertion of federal power under the Necessary and Proper\nClause; if so, that is a factor suggesting that the power is\nnot one properly within the reach of federal power.\n   The opinion of the Court should not be interpreted to\nhold that the only, or even the principal, constraints on\nthe exercise of congressional power are the Constitution’s\nexpress prohibitions. The Court’s discussion of the Tenth\nAmendment invites the inference that restrictions flowing\nfrom the federal system are of no import when defining\nthe limits of the National Government’s power, as it pro\nceeds by first asking whether the power is within the\nNational Government’s reach, and if so it discards federal\nism concerns entirely.\n   These remarks explain why the Court ignores important\nlimitations stemming from federalism principles. Those\nprinciples are essential to an understanding of the func\ntion and province of the States in our constitutional\nstructure.\n                              II\n   As stated at the outset, in this case Congress has acted\nwithin its powers to ensure that an abrupt end to the\nfederal detention of prisoners does not endanger third\nparties. Federal prisoners often lack a single home State\nto take charge of them due to their lengthy prison stays, so\nit is incumbent on the National Government to act. This\nobligation, parallel in some respects to duties defined in\ntort law, is not to put in motion a particular force (here an\nunstable and dangerous person) that endangers others.\nHaving acted within its constitutional authority to detain\nthe person, the National Government can acknowledge a\nduty to ensure that an abrupt end to the detention does\nnot prejudice the States and their citizens.\n6              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n              KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   I would note, as the Court’s opinion does, that §4248\ndoes not supersede the right and responsibility of the\nStates to identify persons who ought to be subject to civil\nconfinement. The federal program in question applies\nonly to those in federal custody and thus involves little\nintrusion upon the ordinary processes and powers of the\nStates.\n   This is not a case in which the National Government\ndemands that a State use its own governmental system to\nimplement federal commands. See Printz v. United States,\n521 U. S. 898 (1997). It is not a case in which the Na\ntional Government relieves the States of their own pri\nmary responsibility to enact laws and policies for the\nsafety and well being of their citizens. See United States\nv. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598 (2000). Nor is it a case in which\nthe exercise of national power intrudes upon functions and\nduties traditionally committed to the State. See Lopez,\nsupra, at 580–581 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).\n   Rather, this is a discrete and narrow exercise of author\nity over a small class of persons already subject to the\nfederal power. Importantly, §4248(d) requires the Attor\nney General to release any civil detainee “to the appropri\nate official of the State in which the person is domiciled or\nwas tried if such State will assume responsibility for his\ncustody, care, and treatment,” providing a strong assur\nance that the proffered reason for the legislation’s neces\nsity is not a mere artifice.\n   With these observations, I concur in the judgment of the\nCourt.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

S. C. §4248, in order to “carr[y] into Execution”\npowers specifically conferred on Congress by the Constitu\ntion, see Art. I, §8, cl. 18.\n   Section 4248 was enacted to protect the public from\nfederal prisoners who suffer from “a serious mental ill\nness, abnormality, or disorder” and who, if released, would\nhave “serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent\nconduct or child molestation.”        See §§4247(a)(5), (6),\n4248(d). Under this law, if neither the State of a pris\noner’s domicile nor the State in which the prisoner was\ntried will assume the responsibility for the prisoner’s\n“custody, care, and treatment,” the Federal Government is\nauthorized to undertake that responsibility. §4248(d).\nThe statute recognizes that, in many cases, no State will\nassume the heavy financial burden of civilly committing a\ndangerous federal prisoner who, as a result of lengthy\nfederal incarceration, no longer has any substantial ties to\nany State.\n2                   UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                    ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n  I entirely agree with the dissent that “[t]he Necessary\nand Proper Clause empowers Congress to enact only those\nlaws that ‘carr[y] into Execution’ one or more of the federal\npowers enumerated in the Constitution,” post, at 1, but\n§4248 satisfies that requirement because it is a necessary\nand proper means of carrying into execution the enumer\nated powers that support the federal criminal statutes\nunder which the affected prisoners were convicted. The\nNecessary and Proper Clause provides the constitutional\nauthority for most federal criminal statutes. In other\nwords, most federal criminal statutes rest upon a congres\nsional judgment that, in order to execute one or more of\nthe powers conferred on Congress, it is necessary and\nproper to criminalize certain conduct, and in order to do\nthat it is obviously necessary and proper to provide for the\noperation of a federal criminal justice system and a federal\nprison system.\n  All of this has been recognized since the beginning of\nour country.

COMSTOCK\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nfor years in a federal prison, often had few ties to any\nState; it was a matter of speculation where they would\nchoose to go upon release; and accordingly no State was\nenthusiastic about volunteering to shoulder the burden of\ncivil commitment.\n  The Necessary and Proper Clause does not give Con\ngress carte blanche. Although the term “necessary” does\nnot mean “absolutely necessary” or indispensable, the\nterm requires an “appropriate” link between a power\nconferred by the Constitution and the law enacted by\nCongress. See McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 415\n(1819). And it is an obligation of this Court to enforce\ncompliance with that limitation. Id., at 423.\n  The law in question here satisfies that requirement.\nThis is not a case in which it is merely possible for a court\nto think of a rational basis on which Congress might have\nperceived an attenuated link between the powers underly\ning the federal criminal statutes and the challenged civil\ncommitment provision. Here, there is a substantial link to\nCongress’ constitutional powers.\n  For this reason, I concur in the judgment that Congress\nhad the constitutional authority to enact 18 U. S.

Because\n§4248 “Execut[es]” no enumerated power, I must respect\nfully dissent.\n                             I\n   “As every schoolchild learns, our Constitution estab\nlishes a system of dual sovereignty between the States and\nthe Federal Government.” Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S.\n452, 457 (1991). In our system, the Federal Government’s\npowers are enumerated, and hence limited. See, e.g.,\nMcCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405 (1819) (“This\ngovernment is acknowledged by all to be one of enumer\nated powers”). Thus, Congress has no power to act unless\nthe Constitution authorizes it to do so. United States v.\nMorrison, 529 U. S. 598, 607 (2000) (“Every law enacted\n2                 UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nby Congress must be based on one or more of its powers\nenumerated in the Constitution”). The States, in turn, are\nfree to exercise all powers that the Constitution does not\nwithhold from them. Amdt. 10 (“The powers not delegated\nto the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by\nit to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or\nto the people”).1 This constitutional structure establishes\ndifferent default rules for Congress and the States: Con\ngress’ powers are “few and defined,” while those that\nbelong to the States “remain . . . numerous and indefinite.”\nThe Federalist No. 45, p. 328 (B. Wright ed. 1961) (J.\nMadison).\n   The Constitution plainly sets forth the “few and defined”\npowers that Congress may exercise. Article I “vest[s]” in\nCongress “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted,” §1, and\ncarefully enumerates those powers in §8. The final clause\nof §8, the Necessary and Proper Clause, authorizes Con\ngress “[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and\nproper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers,\nand all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the\nGovernment of the United States, or in any Department or\nOfficer thereof.” Art. I, §8, cl. 18. As the Clause’s place\nment at the end of §8 indicates, the “foregoing Powers” are\nthose granted to Congress in the preceding clauses of that\nsection. The “other Powers” to which the Clause refers are\nthose “vested” in Congress and the other branches by\nother specific provisions of the Constitution.\n   Chief Justice Marshall famously summarized Congress’\nauthority under the Necessary and Proper Clause in\nMcCulloch, which has stood for nearly 200 years as this\n——————\n  1 “With this careful last phrase, the [Tenth] Amendment avoids tak\n\ning any position on the division of power between the state govern\nments and the people of the States: It is up to the people of each State\nto determine which ‘reserved’ powers their state government may\nexercise.” U.

Second, there must be a\nnecessary and proper fit between the “means” (the federal\nlaw) and the “end” (the enumerated power or powers) it is\ndesigned to serve. Ibid. McCulloch accords Congress a\ncertain amount of discretion in assessing means-end fit\nunder this second inquiry. The means Congress selects\nwill be deemed “necessary” if they are “appropriate” and\n“plainly adapted” to the exercise of an enumerated power,\nand “proper” if they are not otherwise “prohibited” by the\nConstitution and not “[in]consistent” with its “letter and\nspirit.” Ibid.\n   Critically, however, McCulloch underscores the linear\nrelationship the Clause establishes between the two in\nquiries: Unless the end itself is “legitimate,” the fit be\ntween means and end is irrelevant. In other words, no\nmatter how “necessary” or “proper” an Act of Congress\nmay be to its objective, Congress lacks authority to legis\nlate if the objective is anything other than “carrying into\nExecution” one or more of the Federal Government’s enu\nmerated powers. Art. I, §8, cl. 18.\n   This limitation was of utmost importance to the Fram\ners.     During the State ratification debates, Anti\n4                 UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nFederalists expressed concern that the Necessary and\nProper Clause would give Congress virtually unlimited\npower. See, e.g., Essays of Brutus, in 2 The Complete\nAnti-Federalist 421 (H. Storing ed. 1981). Federalist\nsupporters of the Constitution swiftly refuted that charge,\nexplaining that the Clause did not grant Congress any\nfreestanding authority, but instead made explicit what\nwas already implicit in the grant of each enumerated\npower. Referring to the “powers declared in the Constitu\ntion,” Alexander Hamilton noted that “it is expressly to\nexecute these powers that the sweeping clause . . . author\nizes the national legislature to pass all necessary and\nproper laws.” The Federalist No. 33, at 245. James Madi\nson echoed this view, stating that “the sweeping clause . . .\nonly extend[s] to the enumerated powers.” 3 J. Elliot, The\nDebates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption\nof the Federal Constitution 455 (2d ed. 1854) (hereinafter\nElliot). Statements by delegates to the state ratification\nconventions indicate that this understanding was widely\nheld by the founding generation. E.g., id., at 245–246\n(statement of George Nicholas) (“Suppose [the Necessary\nand Proper Clause] had been inserted, at the end of every\npower, that they should have power to make laws to carry\nthat power into execution; would that have increased their\npowers?

Indeed, not even the Commerce\nClause—the enumerated power this Court has interpreted\nmost expansively, see, e.g., NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin\nSteel Corp., 301 U. S. 1, 37 (1937)—can justify federal civil\ndetention of sex offenders. Under the Court’s precedents,\nCongress may not regulate noneconomic activity (such as\nsexual violence) based solely on the effect such activity\nmay have, in individual cases or in the aggregate, on\ninterstate commerce.

Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 426 (1979). As a conse\nquence, we have held that States may “take measures to\nrestrict the freedom of the dangerously mentally ill”—\nincluding those who are sexually dangerous—provided\nthat such commitments satisfy due process and other\nconstitutional requirements. Kansas v. Hendricks, 521\nU.

Indeed, it is\nclear, on the face of the Act and in the Government’s\narguments urging its constitutionality, that §4248 is\naimed at protecting society from acts of sexual violence,\nnot toward “carrying into Execution” any enumerated\npower or powers of the Federal Government. See Adam\nWalsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, 120 Stat.\n587 (entitled “[a]n Act [t]o protect children from sexual\nexploitation and violent crime”), §102, id., at 590 (state\nment of purpose declaring that the Act was promulgated\n“to protect the public from sex offenders”); Brief for United\nStates 38–39 (asserting the Federal Government’s power\nto “protect the public from harm that might result upon\nthese prisoners’ release, even when that harm might arise\nfrom conduct that is otherwise beyond the general regula\ntory powers of the federal government” (emphasis added)).\n——————\n   5 For the reasons explained in Part III–A–2, infra, the enumerated\n\npower that justifies a particular defendant’s criminal arrest or convic\ntion cannot justify his subsequent civil detention under §4248.\n8                  UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n  To be sure, protecting society from violent sexual of\nfenders is certainly an important end. Sexual abuse is a\ndespicable act with untold consequences for the victim\npersonally and society generally. See, e.g., Kennedy v.\nLouisiana, 554 U. S. ___, ___, n. 2, (2008) (ALITO, J., dis\nsenting) (slip op., at 9, n. 2, 22–23). But the Constitution\ndoes not vest in Congress the authority to protect society\nfrom every bad act that might befall it.6 New York v.\nUnited States, 505 U.

S. 1, 63 (1936)).\n  In my view, this should decide the question. Section\n4248 runs afoul of our settled understanding of Congress’\npower under the Necessary and Proper Clause. Congress\nmay act under that Clause only when its legislation\n“carr[ies] into Execution” one of the Federal Government’s\nenumerated powers. Art. I, §8, cl. 18. Section 4248 does\nnot execute any enumerated power. Section 4248 is there\nfore unconstitutional.\n                             III\n   The Court perfunctorily genuflects to McCulloch’s\nframework for assessing Congress’ Necessary and Proper\nClause authority, and to the principle of dual sovereignty\nit helps to maintain, then promptly abandons both in favor\nof a novel five-factor test supporting its conclusion that\n§4248 is a “ ‘necessary and proper’ ” adjunct to a jumble of\nunenumerated “authorit[ies].” Ante, at 22.

It also raises more questions than it answers.\nMust each of the five considerations exist before the Court\nsustains future federal legislation as proper exercises of\nCongress’ Necessary and Proper Clause authority? What\nif the facts of a given case support a finding of only four\nconsiderations? Or three? And if three or four will suffice,\nwhich three or four are imperative? At a minimum, this\nshift from the two-step McCulloch framework to this five\nconsideration approach warrants an explanation as to why\nMcCulloch is no longer good enough and which of the five\nconsiderations will bear the most weight in future cases,\nassuming some number less than five suffices. (Or, if not,\nwhy all five are required.) The Court provides no answers\nto these questions.\n                            A\n  I begin with the first and last “considerations” in the\nCourt’s inquiry. Ante, at 5. The Court concludes that\n§4248 is a valid exercise of Congress’ Necessary and\nProper Clause authority because that authority is “broad,”\nibid., and because “the links between §4248 and an enu\nmerated Article I power are not too attenuated,” ante, at\n18. In so doing, the Court first inverts, then misapplies,\nMcCulloch’s straightforward two-part test.\n                             1\n                             a\n  First, the Court describes Congress’ lawmaking power\nunder the Necessary and Proper Clause as “broad,” relying\non precedents that have upheld federal laws under the\nClause after finding a “ ‘rationa[l]’ ” fit between the law\nand an enumerated power. Ante, at 6 (quoting Sabri v.\nUnited States, 541 U. S. 600, 605 (2004)). It is true that\nthis Court’s precedents allow Congress a certain degree of\nlatitude in selecting the means for “carrying into Execu\n10                 UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ntion” an end that is “legitimate.”7 See, e.g., Jinks v. Rich\nland County, 538 U. S. 456, 462–463 (2003) (citing\nMcCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 417, 421). But in citing these\ncases, the Court puts the cart before the horse: The fit\nbetween means and ends matters only if the end is in fact\nlegitimate—i.e., only if it is one of the Federal Govern\nment’s enumerated powers.\n   By starting its inquiry with the degree of deference\nowed to Congress in selecting means to further a legiti\nmate end, the Court bypasses McCulloch’s first step and\nfails carefully to examine whether the end served by §4248\nis actually one of those powers. See Part III–A–2, infra.\n                             b\n  Second, instead of asking the simple question of what\nenumerated power §4248 “carr[ies] into Execution” at\nMcCulloch’s first step, the Court surveys other laws Con\ngress has enacted and concludes that, because §4248 is\nrelated to those laws, the “links” between §4248 and an\nenumerated power are not “too attenuated”; hence, §4248\nis a valid exercise of Congress’ Necessary and Proper\nClause authority. Ante, at 18. This unnecessarily con\nfuses the analysis and, if followed to its logical extreme,\nwould result in an unwarranted expansion of federal\n——————\n  7 JUSTICE KENNEDY concludes that the Necessary and Proper Clause\nrequires something beyond rational-basis scrutiny when assessing the\nfit between an enumerated power and the means Congress selects to\nexecute it. Ante, at 2–4 (opinion concurring in judgment). Other\narguments regarding the degree of fit between means and end have\nbeen lodged elsewhere. See, e.g., Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 61\n(2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (arguing that, for a law to be within the\nNecessary and Proper Clause, it must bear an “ ‘obvious, simple, and\ndirect relation’ ” to an exercise of Congress’ enumerated powers and\nmust not subvert basic principles of federalism and dual sovereignty).\nBut I find that debate beside the point here, because it concerns the\nanalysis employed at McCulloch’s second step, see McCulloch v. Mary\nland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), while the Court’s decision today errs by\nskipping the first.\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

From this, the Court assumes that §4248 must also be\na valid exercise of congressional power because it is “ ‘rea\nsonably adapted’ ” to those exercises of Congress’ inciden\ntal—and thus unenumerated—authorities. See ante, at 15\n(concluding that “§4248 is ‘reasonably adapted’ to Con\ngress’ power to act as a responsible federal custodian”\n(citation omitted)); ante, at 22 (concluding that “the stat\nute is a ‘necessary and proper’ means of exercising the\nfederal authority that permits Congress to create federal\ncriminal laws, to punish their violation, to imprison viola\ntors, to provide appropriately for those imprisoned, and to\nmaintain the security of those who are not imprisoned but\nwho may be affected by the federal imprisonment of oth\ners”). But that is not the question. The Necessary and\nProper Clause does not provide Congress with authority to\nenact any law simply because it furthers other laws Con\ngress has enacted in the exercise of its incidental author\nity; the Clause plainly requires a showing that every\nfederal statute “carr[ies] into Execution” one or more of\nthe Federal Government’s enumerated powers.8\n——————\n  8 McCulloch   makes this point clear. As the Court notes, ante, at 18–\n19, McCulloch states, in discussing a hypothetical, that from Congress’\nenumerated power to establish post offices and post roads “has been\ninferred the power and duty of carrying the mail,” and, “from this\nimplied power, has again been inferred the right to punish those who\nsteal letters from the post office, or rob the mail.” 4 Wheat., at 417.\nContrary to the Court’s interpretation, this dictum does not suggest\nthat the relationship between Congress’ implied power to punish postal\ncrimes and its implied power to carry the mail is alone sufficient to\nsatisfy review under the Necessary and Proper Clause. Instead,\nMcCulloch directly links the constitutionality of the former to Congress’\n12                 UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n  Federal laws that criminalize conduct that interferes\nwith enumerated powers, establish prisons for those who\nengage in that conduct, and set rules for the care and\ntreatment of prisoners awaiting trial or serving a criminal\nsentence satisfy this test because each helps to “carr[y]\ninto Execution” the enumerated powers that justify a\ncriminal defendant’s arrest or conviction. For example,\nCongress’ enumerated power “[t]o establish Post Offices\nand post Roads,” Art. I, §8, cl. 7, would lack force or practi\ncal effect if Congress lacked the authority to enact crimi\nnal laws “to punish those who steal letters from the post\noffice, or rob the mail.” McCulloch, supra, at 417. Simi\nlarly, that enumerated power would be compromised if\nthere were no prisons to hold persons who violate those\nlaws, or if those prisons were so poorly managed that\nprisoners could escape or demand their release on the\ngrounds that the conditions of their confinement violate\ntheir constitutional rights, at least as we have defined\nthem.

More\nimportantly, McCulloch’s holding, as well as the holdings of this Court’s\nsubsequent decisions, make plain that congressional action is valid\nunder the Necessary and Proper Clause only if it carries into execution\none or more enumerated powers. Id., at 422 (upholding Congress’\nincorporation of a bank because it was a “means . . . to be employed\nonly for the purpose of carrying into execution the given powers” (em\nphasis added)); see Sabri v.

In other words, the Court analogizes\n§4248 to federal laws that authorize prison officials to care\nfor federal inmates while they serve sentences or await\ntrial. But while those laws help to “carr[y] into Execution”\nthe enumerated power that justifies the imposition of\ncriminal sanctions on the inmate, §4248 does not bear that\nessential characteristic for three reasons.\n   First, the statute’s definition of a “sexually dangerous\nperson” contains no element relating to the subject’s\ncrime. See §§4247(a)(5)–(6). It thus does not require a\nfederal court to find any connection between the reasons\nsupporting civil commitment and the enumerated power\nwith which that person’s criminal conduct interfered. As a\nconsequence, §4248 allows a court to civilly commit an\nindividual without finding that he was ever charged with\nor convicted of a federal crime involving sexual violence.\n§§4248(a), (d). That possibility is not merely hypothetical:\nThe Government concedes that nearly 20% of individuals\nagainst whom §4248 proceedings have been brought fit\nthis description.9 Tr. of Oral Arg. 23–25.\n   Second, §4248 permits the term of federal civil commit\nment to continue beyond the date on which a convicted\n——————\n  9 The statute does require the court to find that the subject “has en\n\ngaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child\nmolestation,” §4247(a)(5), but that factual predicate can be established\nby a state conviction, or by clear and convincing evidence that the\nperson committed a sex crime for which he was never charged.\n14             UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nprisoner’s sentence expires or the date on which the stat\nute of limitations on an untried defendant’s crime has run.\nThe statute therefore authorizes federal custody over a\nperson at a time when the Government would lack juris\ndiction to detain him for violating a criminal law that\nexecutes an enumerated power.\n   The statute this Court upheld in Greenwood v. United\nStates, 350 U. S. 366 (1956), provides a useful contrast.\nThat statute authorized the Federal Government to exer\ncise civil custody over a federal defendant declared men\ntally unfit to stand trial only “ ‘until the accused shall be\nmentally competent to stand trial or until the pending\ncharges against him are disposed of according to law.’ ”\nId., at 368, n. 2 (quoting 18 U. S. C. §4246 (1952 ed.)).\nThus, that statute’s “end” reasonably could be interpreted\nas preserving the Government’s power to enforce a crimi\nnal law against the accused. Section 4248 (2006 ed.),\nhowever, authorizes federal detention of a person even\nafter the Government loses the authority to prosecute him\nfor a federal crime.\n   Third, the definition of a “sexually dangerous person”\nrelevant to §4248 does not require the court to find that\nthe person is likely to violate a law executing an enumer\nated power in the future. Although the Federal Govern\nment has no express power to regulate sexual violence\ngenerally, Congress has passed a number of laws proscrib\ning such conduct in special circumstances. All of these\nstatutes contain jurisdictional elements that require a\nconnection to one of Congress’ enumerated powers—such\nas interstate commerce, e.g., §2252(a)(2)—or that limit the\nstatute’s coverage to jurisdictions in which Congress has\nplenary authority, e.g., §2243(a). Section 4248, by con\ntrast, authorizes civil commitment upon a showing that\nthe person is “sexually dangerous,” and presents a risk “to\nothers,” §4247(a)(5). It requires no evidence that this\nsexually dangerous condition will manifest itself in a way\n                      Cite as: 560 U.

I, §8, cl. 17, and federal territories, Art. IV, §3, cl. 2. In\naddition, Congress has “broad general powers to legislate in respect to\nIndian tribes,” United States v. Lara, 541 U. S. 193, 200 (2004) (citing\nArt. I, §8, cl. 3; Art. II, §2, cl. 2), including certain special responsibili\nties over “Indian country,” 18 U. S. C. §1151. Although the Necessary\nand Proper Clause did not authorize Congress to enact §4248, I do not\nrule out the possibility that Congress could provide for the civil com\nmitment of individuals who enter federal custody as a result of acts\ncommitted in these jurisdictions. See, e.g., United States v. Cohen, 733\nF. 2d 128 (CADC 1984) (en banc) (upholding civil commitment of a\ndefendant under a District of Columbia statute authorizing the institu\ntionalization of persons acquitted by reason of insanity). Although two\nof the respondents in this case were either charged with or convicted of\ncriminal acts committed in such jurisdictions, see ante, at 3; 507\nF. Supp. 2d 522, 527, and n. 2 (EDNC 2007), that question is not\npresented here because §4248 does not make that fact essential to an\nindividual’s placement in civil detention.\n16                UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthey may pose,11 ante, at 14. That citation is puzzling\nbecause federal authority derives from the Constitution,\nnot the common law. In any event, nothing in the Re\nstatement suggests that a common-law custodian has the\npowers that Congress seeks here. While the Restatement\nprovides that a custodian has a duty to take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that a person in his care does not cause\n“bodily harm to others,” 2 Restatement (Second) of Torts\n§319, p. 129 (1963–1964), that duty terminates once the\nlegal basis for custody expires:\n     “There is no duty so to control the conduct of a third\n     person as to prevent him from causing physical harm\n     to another unless\n        “(a) a special relation exists between the actor and\n     the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor\n     to control the third person’s conduct, or\n        “(b) a special relation exists between the actor and\n     the other which gives to the other a right to protec\n     tion.” Id., §315, at 122.\nOnce the Federal Government’s criminal jurisdiction over\na prisoner ends, so does any “special relation[ship]” be\ntween the Government and the former prisoner.12\n——————\n  11 The Court also cites Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U. S. 307 (1982), but\n\nthat case lends even less support than the Restatement. In Youngberg,\nan inmate at a state hospital argued that hospital workers violated his\nconstitutional rights when they applied restraints to keep him in his\nbed at the hospital infirmary. Id., at 310–311. In assessing that claim,\nthis Court noted that the hospital had a responsibility to “protect its\nresidents” from the danger of violence. Id., at 320 (emphasis added).\nThe Court never suggested that this responsibility extended to “nearby\n(and other) communities.” Ante, at 14. Moreover, the hospital was a\nstate institution. Nothing in Youngberg suggests that the Federal\nGovernment can detain a person beyond the date on which its criminal\njurisdiction expires for fear that he may later pose a threat to the\nsurrounding community.\n  12 Federal law permits a sentencing court to order that a defendant be\n\nplaced on a term of “supervised release” after his term of imprisonment\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                  17\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   For this reason, I cannot agree with JUSTICE ALITO that\n§4248 is a necessary and proper incident of Congress’\npower “to protect the public from dangers created by the\nfederal criminal justice and prison systems.” Ante, at 3\n(concurring in judgment). A federal criminal defendant’s\n“sexually dangerous” propensities are not “created by” the\nfact of his incarceration or his relationship with the fed\neral prison system. The fact that the Federal Government\nhas the authority to imprison a person for the purpose of\npunishing him for a federal crime—sex-related or other\nwise—does not provide the Government with the addi\ntional power to exercise indefinite civil control over that\nperson.13\n                             2\n  Second, the Court describes §4248 as a “modest” expan\nsion on a statutory framework with a long historical pedi\ngree. Ante, at 9. Yet even if the antiquity of a practice\ncould serve as a substitute for its constitutionality—and\nthe Court admits that it cannot, ibid.—the Court over\nstates the relevant history.\n  Congress’ first foray into this general area occurred in\n1855, when it established St. Elizabeth’s Hospital to pro\nvide treatment to “insane” persons in the military and the\n——————\nis complete. 18 U. S. C. §§3583, 3624(e). Contrary to the Government’s\nsuggestion, federal authority to exercise control over individuals\nserving terms of “supervised release” does not derive from the Govern\nment’s “relationship” with the prisoner, see Brief for United States 38,\nbut from the original criminal sentence itself. Supervised release thus\nserves to execute the enumerated power that justifies the defendant’s\nstatute of conviction, just like any other form of punishment imposed at\nsentencing.\n   13 The fact that Congress has the authority to “provide for the appre\n\nhension of escaped federal prisoners,” see ante, at 3 (ALITO, J., concur\nring in judgment), does not change this conclusion. That authority\nderives from Congress’ power to vindicate the enumerated power with\nwhich the escaped defendant’s crime of conviction interfered, not a\nfreestanding police power.\n18                UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nDistrict of Columbia. Act of Mar. 3, 1855, 10 Stat. 682.\nBut Congress was acting pursuant to enumerated powers\nwhen it took this step. See Art. I, §8, cl. 17 (granting\nCongress plenary authority over the District of Columbia);\nArt. I, §8, cl. 14 (authorizing Congress to “make Rules for\nthe Government and Regulation of the land and naval\nForces”). This enactment therefore provides no support\nfor Congress’ claimed power to detain sexually dangerous\npersons without an otherwise valid basis for jurisdiction.\n  Later, Congress provided for the federal civil commit\nment of “insane” persons charged with or convicted of a\nfederal crime. Act of Feb. 7, 1857, §§5–6, 11 Stat. 158; see\n17 Op. Atty. Gen. 211, 212–213 (1881); Act of June 23,\n1874, ch. 465, 18 Stat. 251; Act of Aug. 7, 1882, 22 Stat.\n330. As the Court explains, however, these statutes did\nnot authorize federal custody beyond the completion of the\n“term” of federal “imprisonment,” §§2–3, 18 Stat. 252; see\n35 Op. Atty. Gen. 366, 368 (1927); 30 Op. Atty. Gen. 569,\n570–571 (1916); Act of May 13, 1930, ch. 254, §6, 46 Stat.\n271, and thus shed no light on the question presented\nhere.\n  In 1949, Congress enacted a more comprehensive re\ngime, authorizing the civil commitment of mentally ill\npersons in BOP custody. See 18 U. S. C. §§4246, 4247\n(1952 ed.). This Court addressed that regime in Green\nwood, but never endorsed the proposition that the Federal\nGovernment could rely on that statute to detain a person\nin the absence of a pending criminal charge or ongoing\ncriminal sentence.14\n——————\n  14 In addition, at least some courts questioned the Federal Govern\n\nment’s power to detain a person in such circumstances. See Dixon v.\nSteele, 104 F. Supp. 904, 908 (WD Mo. 1952) (holding that the Federal\nGovernment lacked authority to detain an individual declared mentally\nunfit to stand trial once it was determined that he was unlikely to\nrecover in time to be prosecuted); Higgins v. United States, 205 F. 2d\n650, 653 (CA9 1953) (avoiding this constitutional question by interpret\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

S.,\nat 375; see supra, at 16. The Court was careful to state\nthat “[t]his commitment, and therefore the legislation\nauthorizing commitment in the context of this case, in\nvolve[d] an assertion of authority” within “congressional\npower under the Necessary and Proper Clause.” Green\nwood, 350 U. S., at 375 (emphasis added). But it painstak\ningly limited its holding to “the narrow constitutional\nissue raised by th[at] order of commitment.” Ibid.\n   The historical record thus supports the Federal Gov\nernment’s authority to detain a mentally ill person against\nwhom it has the authority to enforce a criminal law. But\nit provides no justification whatsoever for reading the\nNecessary and Proper Clause to grant Congress the power\nto authorize the detention of persons without a basis for\nfederal criminal jurisdiction.\n                              3\n  Finally, the Court offers two arguments regarding\n§4248’s impact on the relationship between the Federal\nGovernment and the States. First, the Court and both\nconcurrences suggest that Congress must have had the\npower to enact §4248 because a long period of federal\nincarceration might “seve[r]” a sexually dangerous pris\noner’s “claim to ‘legal residence’ ” in any particular State,\nante, at 15 (opinion of the Court), thus leaving the pris\noner without any “home State to take charge” of him upon\nrelease, ante, at 5 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment);\n——————\ning the statute to permit federal civil detention only for a period rea\nsonably related to a criminal prosecution); Wells v. Attorney General of\nUnited States, 201 F. 2d 556, 560 (CA10 1953) (same).\n20                 UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nsee ante, at 1 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment) (noting\nthat many federal prisoners, “as a result of lengthy federal\nincarceration, no longer ha[ve] any substantial ties to any\nState”). I disagree with the premise of that argument. As\nan initial matter, States plainly have the constitutional\nauthority to “take charge” of a federal prisoner released\nwithin their jurisdiction. See Amdt. 10 (stating that pow\ners not delegated to the Federal Government are “re\nserved” to the States, and to the people). In addition, the\nassumption that a State knowingly would fail to exercise\nthat authority is, in my view, implausible. The Govern\nment stated at oral argument that its “default position” is\nto release a federal prisoner to the State in which he was\nconvicted, Tr. of Oral Arg. 15; see also 28 CFR §2.33(b)\n(2009), and neither the Court nor the concurrences argue\nthat a State has the power to refuse such a person domi\ncile within its borders. Thus, they appear to assume that,\nin the absence of 18 U. S. C. §4248, a State would take no\naction when informed by the BOP that a sexually danger\nous federal prisoner was about to be released within its\njurisdiction. In light of the plethora of state laws enacted\nin recent decades to protect communities from sex offend\ners,15 the likelihood of such an occurrence seems quite\n——————\n  15 As we have noted before, all 50 States have developed “some varia\ntion” of a system “for mandatory registration of sex offenders and\ncorresponding community notification.” Smith v. Doe, 538 U. S. 84, 89–\n90 (2003). In addition, several States have taken further steps; some\nimpose residency restrictions on sex offenders, see, e.g., Kennedy v.\nLouisiana, 554 U. S. ___ , ___, n. 5 (2008) (ALITO, J., dissenting) (slip\nop., at 11, n. 5) (collecting statutes), and, most relevant here, 22 States\nhave enacted involuntary civil-commitment laws substantially similar\nto §4248, see Ariz.

But even in the event a State made such a deci\nsion, the Constitution assigns the responsibility for that\ndecision, and its consequences, to the state government\nalone.\n   Next, the Court submits that §4248 does not upset the\nbalance of federalism or invade the States’ reserved pow\ners because it “requires accommodation of state interests”\nby instructing the Attorney General to release a commit\nted person to the State in which he was domiciled or tried\nif that State wishes to “ ‘assume . . . responsibility’ ” for\nhim. Ante, at 17 (quoting §4248(d)). This right of first\nrefusal is mere window dressing. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5 (“It is\nnot the usual course that the State does take responsibil\nity”). More importantly, it is an altogether hollow assur\nance that §4248 preserves the principle of dual sover\neignty—the “letter and spirit” of the Constitution—as the\nNecessary and Proper Clause requires.16 McCulloch, 4\n——————\n§632.480 et seq.

(West 2007 and\nSupp. 2009).\n   16 The Court describes my argument as a claim that “§4248 violates\n\nthe Tenth Amendment.” Ante, at 16. Yet, I agree entirely with the\nCourt that “ ‘it makes no difference whether one views the question at\nissue [here] as one of ascertaining the limits of the power delegated to\nthe Federal Government under the affirmative provisions of the Consti\ntution or one of discerning the core of sovereignty retained by the\nStates under the Tenth Amendment.’ ” Ibid. (quoting New York v.\nUnited States, 505 U. S. 144, 159 (1992)). Section 4248 is unconstitu\ntional because it does not “carr[y] into Execution” an enumerated\npower. Therefore, it necessarily intrudes upon the powers our Consti\ntution reserves to the States and to the people.\n22             UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nWheat., at 421; Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898,\n923–924 (1997). For once it is determined that Congress\nhas the authority to provide for the civil detention of\nsexually dangerous persons, Congress “is acting within the\npowers granted it under the Constitution,” and “may\nimpose its will on the States.” Gregory, 501 U. S., at 460;\nsee Art. VI, cl. 2. Section 4248’s right of first refusal is\nthus not a matter of constitutional necessity, but an act of\nlegislative grace.\n   Nevertheless, 29 States appear as amici and argue that\n§4248 is constitutional. They tell us that they do not\nobject to Congress retaining custody of “sexually danger\nous persons” after their criminal sentences expire because\nthe cost of detaining such persons is “expensive”—\napproximately $64,000 per year—and these States would\nrather the Federal Government bear this expense. Brief\nfor Kansas et al. 2; ibid. (“[S]ex offender civil commitment\nprograms are expensive to operate”); id., at 4 (“these pro\ngrams are expensive”); id., at 8 (“[T]here are very practical\nreasons to prefer a system that includes a federal sex\noffender civil commitment program . . . . One such reason\nis the significant cost”).\n   Congress’ power, however, is fixed by the Constitution;\nit does not expand merely to suit the States’ policy prefer\nences, or to allow State officials to avoid difficult choices\nregarding the allocation of state funds. By assigning the\nFederal Government power over “certain enumerated\nobjects only,” the Constitution “leaves to the several States\na residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other ob\njects.” The Federalist No. 39, at 285 (J. Madison). The\npurpose of this design is to preserve the “balance of power\nbetween the States and the Federal Government . . . [that]\nprotect[s] our fundamental liberties.” Garcia v.
