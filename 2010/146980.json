STEPHEN \n\n              UPTON, WARDEN \n\nON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES\n     COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n              No. 09–8852. Decided May 24, 2010\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Petitioner Lawrence Jefferson, who has been sentenced\nto death, claimed in both state and federal courts that his\nlawyers were constitutionally inadequate because they\nfailed to investigate a traumatic head injury that he suf\nfered as a child. The state court rejected that claim after\nmaking a finding that the attorneys were advised by an\nexpert that such investigation was unnecessary. Under\nthe governing federal statute, that factual finding is pre\nsumed correct unless any one of eight exceptions applies.\nSee 28 U. S. C. §§2254(d)(1)–(8) (1994 ed.). But the Court\nof Appeals considered only one of those exceptions (specifi\ncally §2254(d)(8)). And on that basis, it considered itself\n“duty-bound” to accept the state court’s finding, and re\njected Jefferson’s claim. Because the Court of Appeals did\nnot fully consider several remaining potentially applicable\nexceptions, we vacate its judgment and remand.\n                              I\n  When Jefferson was a child, he “suffered a serious in\njury to his head.” Jefferson v.

The accident left his\nskull swollen and misshapen and his forehead visibly\nscarred. Jefferson v. Hall, 570 F. 3d 1283, 1311, 1315, n. 4\n(CA11 2009) (Carnes, J., dissenting). During the District\nCourt proceedings below, uncontroverted experts testified\n2                    JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nthat, as a result of his head injury, Jefferson has “perma\nnent brain damage” that “causes abnormal behavior” over\nwhich he “has no or substantially limited control.” 490\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1321–1322. According to these experts,\nJefferson’s condition causes “ ‘emotional dullness,’ ” “ ‘rest\nless or aggressive characteristics,’ ” “ ‘impulsiveness,’ ”\n“ ‘temper outbursts,’ ” “ ‘markedly diminished impulse\ncontrol,’ ” “ ‘impaired social judgment,’ ” and “ ‘transient\noutbursts of rage which are totally inconsistent with his\nnormal behavioral pattern.’ ” Id., at 1322, 1327.\n    The experts further testified that Jefferson’s “ ‘severe\ncognitive disabilities’ ” “ ‘profoundly alter’ ” his “ ‘ability to\nplan and coordinate his actions, to be aware of the conse\nquences of his behavior, and to engage in premeditated or\nintentional acts.’ ” Id., at 1327. But they testified he is\nneither psychotic nor retarded. Id., at 1319. Thus, they\nsaid, to a lay observer or even to a professional psycholo\ngist, Jefferson does not outwardly appear mentally im\npaired. Indeed, according to the experts, “ ‘the behavior\nthat may result from’ ” his condition “ ‘could, without the\nadministration of proper testing, be mistaken for voli\ntional.’ ” Id., at 1322.\n    Jefferson faced a death sentence for killing his co\nworker while the two men were fishing. Id., at 1271–1272.\nPrior to trial, he was examined by a psychologist named\nDr. Gary Dudley, who prepared a formal report in which\nhe concluded that Jefferson’s mental deficiencies do not\nimpair “ ‘his judgment or decision-making capacity.’ ” 570\nF. 3d, at 1294 (quoting report). But Dr. Dudley’s report\nincluded a caveat: “ ‘One possibility that could not be\nexplored because of [Jefferson’s] incarceration has to do\nwith the sequelae,’ ” i.e., pathologies, related to a “ ‘head\ninjury experienced during childhood.’ ” Ibid. “ ‘In my\nopinion,’ ” he wrote, “ ‘it would be worthwhile to conduct\nneuropsychological evaluation of this individual to rule out\nan organic etiology,’ ” i.e., to rule out brain damage. Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n   Although “it is undisputed that the testing” Dr. Dudley\nrecommended “could have easily been performed,” 490\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1322, and that Jefferson’s attorneys pos\nsessed police reports and hospital records recounting his\nhead injury, id., at 1323, the attorneys did not have Jef\nferson tested. At sentencing, they presented only testi\nmony from two prison guards, who stated that Jefferson\nwas an unproblematic inmate, and from three members of\nJefferson’s family, who testified that he is a “responsible,\ngenerous, gentle, and kind” person and “a good father.”\n570 F. 3d, at 1290–1291. And while Jefferson’s mother\nbriefly mentioned the car accident, “she was not ques\ntioned and did not offer any testimony regarding the\nimpact, if any, that the accident had on him.” Id., at 1291.\nThus, “[a]s far as the jury knew, Jefferson did not suffer\nfrom brain damage or neurological impairment; he had no\norganic disorders”; and “his emotional stability, impulse\ncontrol, and judgment were perfectly normal.” Id., at 1311\n(Carnes, J., dissenting).\n   Jefferson sought habeas relief in state court, arguing\nthat his two trial attorneys unreasonably failed to pursue\nbrain-damage testing. In response, the trial attorneys\ntestified that they did not pursue such testing because,\nafter delivering his formal written report, Dr. Dudley later\ntold them that further investigation “ ‘may be a waste of\ntime because the rest of [his] report’ ” had “ ‘said that\n[Jefferson] was non psychotic.’ ” 570 F. 3d, at 1295 (quot\ning testimony). Dr. Dudley did not testify in person at the\nhearing, but he submitted a sworn affidavit denying that\nhe had ever made such statements. He said “it had al\nways been his expert opinion ‘that neuropsychological\ntesting was necessary’ ” and that when he wrote as much\nin his formal report “he ‘meant it.’ ” Id., at 1312 (Carnes,\nJ., dissenting) (quoting affidavit). He added, “ ‘I never,\nbefore or after that report, suggested to [Jefferson’s attor\nneys] that such an evaluation was not necessary or that it\n4                   JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nwould not be worthwhile.’ ” Ibid.; cf. Pet. for Cert. 17,\nn. 12.\n   Jefferson contends, and the State has not disputed, that\nafter the hearing concluded the state-court judge con\ntacted the attorneys for the State ex parte. And in a pri\nvate conversation that included neither Jefferson nor his\nattorneys, the judge asked the State’s attorneys to draft\nthe opinion of the court. See id., at 3, 12. According to\nJefferson, no such request was made of him, nor was he\ninformed of the request made to opposing counsel. Id., at\n12, n. 8, 13; see also Jefferson v. Zant, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1364720\"><a href=\"/opinion/1364720/jefferson-v-zant/\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ga.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 431\nS. E. 2d 110, 111 (1993) (“Jefferson contends [the order]\namounts to no more and no less than a reply brief to which\n[he] has not had a chance to respond”).\n   The attorneys for the State prepared an opinion finding\nthat “Dr. Dudley led [Jefferson’s trial attorneys] to believe\nthat further investigation would simply be a waste of time\nbecause Petitioner [i]s not psychotic.” Jefferson v. Zant,\nCiv. Action No. 87–V–1241 (Super. Ct. Butts Cty., Ga.,\nOct. 7, 1992), p. 16, App. 4 to Pet. for Cert. 16 (hereinafter\nState Order); see also id., at 37. The opinion “specifically\ncredits the testimony of [the trial attorneys] with regard to\ntheir efforts to investigate Petitioner’s mental condition.”\nId., at 18; see also id., at 36. And relying on these find\nings, it concludes that Jefferson’s attorneys “made a rea\nsonable investigation into [his] mental health” and were\nthus not ineffective. Id., at 37.\n   Notably, as the Georgia Supreme Court acknowledged,\nthe State’s opinion discusses statements purportedly made\non Jefferson’s behalf by a witness “who did not testify” or\nparticipate in the proceedings. 263 Ga., at 318, 431 S. E.\n2d, at 112; see State Order 24–25. Nonetheless, the opin\nion “was adopted verbatim by the [state] court.” 263 Ga.,\nat 316, 431 S. E. 2d, at 111. And while the State Supreme\nCourt recognized that we have “ ‘criticized’ ” such a prac\ntice, it affirmed the judgment. Id., at 317, 320, 431 S. E.\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

S. 564, 572 (1985)).\n                               II\n   Jefferson next sought federal habeas relief in the Dis\ntrict Court. In his opening brief, he argued that “there is\nno reason under principles of comity or otherwise to give\nany deference to the findings of the State Habeas Corpus\nCourt.” Brief for Petitioner in No. 1:96–CV–989–CC (ND\nGa.), Doc. 105, p. 4, and n. 1 (hereinafter District Court\nBrief). In support of that argument, he claimed that the\nstate court “merely signed an order drafted by the State\nwithout revision of a single word,” even though the order\n“described witnesses who never testified.” Ibid. And he\nsaid that such a process “rais[es] serious doubts as to\nwhether [the judge] even read, much less carefully consid\nered, the proposed order submitted by the State.” Ibid.\n   The District Court ruled in Jefferson’s favor. It noted\nthat under the relevant statute “factual findings of state\ncourts are presumed to be correct unless one of . . . eight\nenumerated exceptions . . . applies.” 490 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1280; see also id., at 1280, n. 5 (listing the exceptions).\nAnd it acknowledged “the state habeas corpus court’s\nfailure to explain the basis” for its credibility findings. Id.,\nat 1324, n. 17. But it accepted Jefferson’s claim of ineffec\ntive assistance of counsel without disturbing the state\ncourt’s factual findings because it believed he should\nprevail even accepting those findings as true. Id., at\n1324–1325.\n   On appeal, Jefferson defended the District Court’s judg\nment primarily on its own terms. But he also argued that\nthe state court’s factfinding was “dubious at best” in light\nof the process that court employed, and that the Court of\nAppeals therefore “should harbor serious doubts about the\nfindings of fact and credibility determinations in the state\ncourt record.” Brief for Petitioner/Appellee in No. 07–\n6                   JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n12502 (CA11), pp. 31–32, n. 10 (hereinafter Appeals Brief).\n  A divided Court of Appeals panel reversed, and Jeffer\nson filed this petition for certiorari asking us to review his\nclaim of ineffective assistance of counsel. And, in so doing,\nhe challenges—as he did in the State Supreme Court, the\nDistrict Court, and the Court of Appeals—“the fact find\nings of the state court,” given what he describes as the\ndeficient procedure employed by that court while reviewing\nhis claim. Pet. for Cert. 11–13, 17, n. 12, 18, n. 13 (re\ncounting “ ‘reason[s] to doubt’ ” the state court’s findings).\nCf. Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation,\n513 U. S. 374, 379 (1995) (stating standard for preserving\nan issue for review in this Court).\n                               III\n   This habeas application was filed prior to the enactment\nof the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 and is therefore governed by federal habeas law as it\nexisted prior to that point. Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S.\n320, 326–336 (1997). In 1963, we set forth the “appropri\nate standard” to be applied by a “federal court in habeas\ncorpus” when “the facts” pertinent to a habeas application\n“are in dispute.” Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 312.\nWe held that when “the habeas applicant was afforded a\nfull and fair hearing by the state court resulting in reliable\nfindings” the district court “ordinarily should . . . accept\nthe facts as found” by the state-court judge. Id., at 318.\nHowever, “if the habeas applicant did not receive a full\nand fair evidentiary hearing in a state court, either at the\ntime of the trial or in a collateral proceeding,” we held that\nthe federal court “must hold an evidentiary hearing” to\nresolve any facts that “are in dispute.” Id., at 312. We\nfurther “explain[ed] the controlling criteria” by enumerat\ning six circumstances in which such an evidentiary hear\ning would be required:\n    “(1) the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n    in the state hearing; (2) the state factual determina\n    tion is not fairly supported by the record as a whole;\n    (3) the fact-finding procedure employed by the state\n    court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hear\n    ing; (4) there is a substantial allegation of newly dis\n    covered evidence; (5) the material facts were not ade\n    quately developed at the state-court hearing; or (6) for\n    any reason it appears that the state trier of fact did not\n    afford the habeas applicant a full and fair fact hear\n    ing.” Id., at 313 (emphasis added).\n  Three years later, in 1966, Congress enacted an\namendment to the federal habeas statute that “was an\nalmost verbatim codification of the standards delineated\nin Townsend v. Sain.” Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 111\n(1985). That codification read in relevant part as follows:\n      “In any proceeding instituted in a Federal court by\n    an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person\n    in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court,\n    a determination . . . of a factual issue, made by a State\n    court of competent jurisdiction . . . , shall be presumed\n    to be correct, unless the applicant shall establish or\n    it shall otherwise appear, or the respondent shall\n    admit—\n      “(1) that the merits of the factual dispute were not\n    resolved in the State court hearing;\n      “(2) that the factfinding procedure employed by the\n    State court was not adequate to afford a full and fair\n    hearing;\n      “(3) that the material facts were not adequately de\n    veloped at the State court hearing;\n      “(4) that the State court lacked jurisdiction of the\n    subject matter or over the person of the applicant in\n    the State court proceeding;\n      “(5) that the applicant was an indigent and the\n    State court, in deprivation of his constitutional right,\n8                   JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n    failed to appoint counsel to represent him in the State\n    court proceeding;\n       “(6) that the applicant did not receive a full, fair,\n    and adequate hearing in the State court proceeding; or\n       “(7) that the applicant was otherwise denied due\n    process of law in the State court proceeding;\n       “(8) or unless . . . the Federal court on a considera\n    tion of [the relevant] part of the record as a whole con\n    cludes that such factual determination is not fairly\n    supported by the record.” §2254(d) (emphasis added).\nAs is clear from the statutory text quoted above, and as\nthe District Court correctly stated, if any “one of the eight\nenumerated exceptions . . . applies” then “the state court’s\nfactfinding is not presumed correct.” 490 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1280; accord, Miller, supra, at 105 (“Under 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(d), state-court findings of fact ‘shall be presumed to\nbe correct’ in a federal habeas corpus proceeding unless\none of eight enumerated exceptions applies”); see also 1 R.\nHertz & J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and\nProcedure §20.2c, pp. 915–918 (5th ed. 2005).\n  Jefferson has consistently argued that the federal courts\n“should harbor serious doubts about” and should not “give\nany deference to” the “findings of fact and credibility\ndeterminations” made by the state habeas court because\nthose findings were drafted exclusively by the attorneys\nfor the State pursuant to an ex parte request from the\nstate-court judge, who made no such request of Jefferson,\nfailed to notify Jefferson of the request made to opposing\ncounsel, and adopted the State’s proposed opinion verba\ntim even though it recounted evidence from a nonexistent\nwitness. See, e.g., Appeals Brief 32, n. 10; District Court\nBrief 4, n. 1; Pet. for Cert. 12. These are arguments that\nthe state court’s process was deficient. In other words,\nthey are arguments that Jefferson “did not receive a full\nand fair evidentiary hearing in . . . state court.” Town\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             9\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nsend, supra, at 312. Or, to use the statutory language,\nthey are arguments that the state court’s “factfinding\nprocedure,” “hearing,” and “proceeding” were not “full,\nfair, and adequate.” §§2254(d)(2), (6), (7).\n   But the Court of Appeals did not consider the state\ncourt’s process when it applied the statutory presumption\nof correctness. Instead, it invoked Circuit precedent that\napplied only paragraph (8) of §2254(d), which, codifying\nthe second Townsend exception, 372 U. S., at 313, lifts the\npresumption of correctness for findings that are “not fairly\nsupported by the record.” See 570 F. 3d, at 1300 (quoting\nJackson v. Herring, 42 F. 3d 1350, 1366 (CA11 1995), in\nturn quoting 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(8)). And even though\nthe Court of Appeals “recognize[d]” that Jefferson had\nargued that the state court’s process had produced factual\nfindings that were “ ‘dubious at best,’ ” and that federal\ncourts should therefore “ ‘harbor serious doubts about’ ” the\nstate court’s “ ‘findings of fact and credibility,’ ” the Court\nof Appeals nonetheless held that the state court’s findings\nare “ ‘entitled to a presumption of correctness’ ” that it was\n“duty-bound” to apply. 570 F. 3d, at 1304, n. 8 (quoting\nAppeals Brief 32, n. 10). The Court of Appeals explicitly\nstated that it considered itself “duty-bound” to defer to the\nstate court’s findings because “Jefferson has not argued\nthat any of the state courts’ factual findings were ‘not\nfairly supported by the record,’ ” a direct reference to\n§2254(d)(8) and to the second Townsend exception. 570\nF. 3d, at 1304, n. 8 (emphasis added). And it then con\ncluded: “Based on these factual findings of the state ha\nbeas courts—all of which are fairly supported by the re\ncord—we believe that Jefferson’s counsel were reasonable\nin deciding not to pursue neuropsychological testing.” Id.,\nat 1304 (emphasis added).\n   In our view, the Court of Appeals did not properly con\nsider the legal status of the state court’s factual findings.\nUnder Townsend, as codified by the governing statute, a\n10                 JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nfederal court is not “duty-bound” to accept any and all\nstate-court findings that are “fairly supported by the\nrecord.” Those words come from §2254(d)(8), which is only\none of eight enumerated exceptions to the presumption of\ncorrectness. But there are seven others, see §§2254(d)(1)–\n(7), none of which the Court of Appeals considered when\naddressing Jefferson’s claim. To be sure, we have previ\nously stated in cases applying §2254(d)(8) that “a federal\ncourt” may not overturn a state court’s factual conclusion\n“unless the conclusion is not ‘fairly supported by the re\ncord.’ ” Parker v. Dugger, 498 U. S. 308, 320 (1991) (grant\ning federal habeas relief after rejecting state court’s find\ning under §2254(d)(8)); see also Demosthenes v. Baal, 495\nU. S. 731 (1990) (per curiam) (applying §2254(d)(8)); cf.\npost, at 10 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). But in those cases\nthere was no suggestion that any other provisions enu\nmerated in §2254(d) were at issue. That is not the case\nhere. In treating §2254(d)(8) as the exclusive statutory\nexception, and by failing to address Jefferson’s argument\nthat the state court’s procedures deprived its findings of\ndeference, the Court of Appeals applied the statute and\nour precedents incorrectly.\n   Although we have stated that a court’s “verbatim adop\ntion of findings of fact prepared by prevailing parties”\nshould be treated as findings of the court, we have also\ncriticized that practice. Anderson, 470 U. S., at 572. And\nwe have not considered the lawfulness of, nor the applica\ntion of the habeas statute to, the use of such a practice\nwhere (1) a judge solicits the proposed findings ex parte,\n(2) does not provide the opposing party an opportunity to\ncriticize the findings or to submit his own, or (3) adopts\nfindings that contain internal evidence suggesting that\nthe judge may not have read them. Cf. id., at 568; Ga.\nCode of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3(A)(4) (1993) (prohibit\ning ex parte judicial communications).\n   We decline to determine in the first instance whether\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Decided May 24, 2010\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\ndissenting.\n   The question presented by Jefferson’s petition for writ of\ncertiorari is whether his trial attorneys rendered ineffec\ntive assistance of counsel when they declined to pursue\nfurther investigation of Jefferson’s childhood head injury.\nIn my view the Court should either answer that question\nor (as I would prefer) deny the petition. Instead, it sum\nmarily vacates the judgment of the Court of Appeals on an\naltogether different ground that was neither raised nor\npassed upon below and that is not fairly included within\nthe sole question presented. To make matters worse, the\nCourt conjures up an “error” with respect to that ground\nby misquoting and mischaracterizing the Court of Appeals’\nopinion, ante, at 9–10, and by overlooking relevant author\nity from this Court. I respectfully dissent.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n  The prior version of 28 U. S. C. §2254(d) (1994 ed.)\napplicable in this case provided that in federal habeas\nproceedings the factual determinations of a state court\n“shall be presumed to be correct,” unless the applicant\nproves, the respondent admits, or a federal court deter\nmines that one of eight exceptions set forth in §2254(d)(1)–\n(8) applies. The Court concludes that the Eleventh Circuit\n2                      JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nmisapplied that provision and our precedents by treating\none of those exceptions, §2254(d)(8), “as the exclusive\nstatutory exception” to the presumption of correctness,\nand by failing to address whether §2254(d)(2), (6), or (7)\nmight also bar application of that presumption.1 Ante, at\n10.\n   The Court’s opinion, however, is the first anyone (in\ncluding Jefferson) has heard of this argument. Jefferson’s\nbriefs below contain no discussion or even citation of sub\nsection (d)—let alone of paragraphs (2), (6), or (7)—and the\ncourts below understandably never passed upon the appli\ncation of those provisions. Under our longstanding prac\ntice, that should be the end of the matter. See, e.g., Penn\nsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U. S. 206, 212–\n213 (1998).\n   But the Court insists, ante, at 5–6, 8–9, that if we squint\nat them long enough we can see in Jefferson’s briefs below\na challenge to the state court’s fact-finding process cogni\nzable under §2254(d)(2), (6), and (7). But the handful of\nisolated, vague statements it musters (buried in hundreds\nof pages of briefs) show no such thing. The Court’s only\nevidence that Jefferson presented the point to the District\nCourt, ante, at 5, 8, consists of a single sentence of text\n(and an accompanying two-sentence footnote) in the “Prior\nProceedings” section of his 180-page brief. Final Eviden\ntiary Brief and Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions\n——————\n    1 These\n          four exceptions in 28 U. S. C. §2254(d) (1994 ed.) were:\n  “(2) that the factfinding procedure employed by the State court was\nnot adequate to afford a full and fair hearing;\n             .           .           .          .           .\n  “(6) that the applicant did not receive a full, fair, and adequate\nhearing in the State court proceeding; or\n  “(7) that the applicant was otherwise denied due process of law in the\nState court proceeding;\n  “(8) or unless . . . the Federal court on a consideration of [the rele\nvant] part of the record as a whole concludes that such factual determi\nnation is not fairly supported by the record . . . .”\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nof Law, Record in No. 1:96–CV–989–CC (ND Ga.), Doc.\n105 (hereinafter District Court Brief). The sentence is: “In\nentering the State Habeas Corpus Order Judge Newton\nmerely signed an order drafted by the State without revi\nsion of a single word.” Id., at 4. The footnote adds:\n       “[T]he order signed by Judge Newton described wit\n    nesses who never testified, raising serious doubt as to\n    whether he even read, much less carefully considered,\n    the proposed order submitted by the State. In this\n    circumstance, there is no reason under principles of\n    comity or otherwise to give any deference to the find\n    ings of the State Habeas Court, because there was ap\n    parently no serious consideration or deliberation of\n    the factual and legal issues raised.” Ibid., n. 1.\nThis passing suggestion that deference would be unwar\nranted is, to put it mildly, an elliptical way to argue that\nthe state fact-finding procedure was inadequate,\n§2254(d)(2), that Jefferson was denied a full, fair, and\nadequate hearing, §2254(d)(6), or that Jefferson was de\nnied due process of law, §2254(d)(7). And it only appeared,\nI emphasize again, in the “Prior Proceedings” section of\nthe brief. The argument section of Jefferson’s District\nCourt Brief, consisting of 164 pages and containing sepa\nrate assignments of error from III to XLIV (44), makes no\nmention of the ground upon which the Court today relies.\nAnd the assignment of error that is the basis for the ques\ntion presented in Jefferson’s petition, VI, id., at 47–80, did\nnot dispute the state courts’ factual findings under\n§2254(d), but only challenged the state courts’ legal con\nclusion that his attorneys’ failure to conduct a fuller inves\ntigation into the head injury he suffered as a child was not\ndeficient performance under Strickland v. Washington,\n466 U. S. 668 (1984).\n   Jefferson also did not raise the point in the Eleventh\nCircuit. His brief to that court acknowledged that the\n4                   JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nstate courts’ “[f]indings of fact and credibility determina\ntions are reviewed for clear error.” Brief for Peti\ntioner/Appellee, No. 07–12502, pp. 16–17 (hereinafter\nAppeals Brief). It declared that “The District Court Cor\nrectly Deferred to the Fact Findings of the State Court” in\nadjudicating his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.\nId., at 21 (capitalization and boldface type deleted); see\nalso id., at 29, and n. 7, 31. And it conceded that with\nrespect to the ineffective-assistance claim, “[t]he relevant\nfacts are not in dispute.” Id., at 24. Jefferson did charac\nterize the state habeas court’s factual findings as gener\nally “dubious” and suggested there were “serious doubts”\nabout them, id., at 32, n. 10. But not once did he argue\nthat the dubiousness of the findings was the consequence\nof a failure to meet the requirements of §2254(d)(2), (6), or\n(7)—or even more generally that the findings should not\nbe presumed correct under §2254(d). Instead, he pressed\nthe same argument he made in the District Court: Even if\nthe state courts’ factual findings were correct, his trial\nattorneys rendered ineffective assistance in deciding to\nforgo further investigation of his childhood head injury.\nId., at 31–33, 50–51.\n   Nor did the courts below pass upon the argument the\nCourt now addresses. The District Court did not dispute\nthe state courts’ factual findings. Jefferson v. Terry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2576805\"><a href=\"/opinion/2576805/jefferson-v-terry/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

It accepted\nthose findings as true, including the state habeas court’s\ncredibility findings, id., at 1323–1324, and n. 17, but held\n“as a matter of law” that it was objectively unreasonable\nfor Jefferson’s attorneys “not to investigate” further into\nthe effect, if any, of the accident on Jefferson’s mental\ncapacity and health, id., at 1324. Concluding that Jeffer\nson was thereby prejudiced, the court ordered a new sen\ntencing hearing. Id., at 1328.\n   The Court of Appeals disagreed with that determination\nand reversed, holding that his trial attorneys’ performance\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nwas not objectively unreasonable under Strickland. Jef\nferson v. Hall, 570 F. 3d 1283, 1301–1309 (CA11 2009).\nThat court correctly stated the applicable framework\nunder §2254(d):\n       “Pre-AEDPA, questions of law and mixed questions\n    of law and fact resolved by state habeas courts are re\n    viewed de novo, while the state courts’ factual findings\n    are ‘subject to the presumption of correctness.’\n    Freund v. Butterworth, 165 F. 3d 839, 861 (11th Cir.\n    1999). Although these findings may be disregarded if,\n    for example, they are not ‘fairly supported by the re\n    cord,’ Jackson v. Herring, 42 F. 3d 1350, 1366 (11th\n    Cir. 1995) (quoting 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(8)), this Court\n    has construed the ‘presumption of correctness’ stan\n    dard to be the same as the ‘clear error’ standard of\n    review.” Id., at 1300 (emphasis added; footnote\n    omitted).\nConfronted with no argument that §2254(d)(1)–(7) applied\nor that it must disregard the state courts’ factual findings,\nthe Court of Appeals understandably did not pass upon\nthose questions.\n  The Court of Appeals did consider the record on its own,\nas required by §2254(d)(8), to determine whether the state\ncourts’ factual determinations were fairly supported by the\nrecord. Id., at 1303–1304, and n. 8. In doing so, the court\n“specifically note[d] that neither Jefferson nor the district\ncourt questioned the state court’s factual finding that [the\ndefense’s psychiatric expert] led [one of Jefferson’s attor\nney’s] to believe that further investigation would simply\nbe a waste of time, . . . despite [his attorney’s] testimony\nthat [the expert] told him it ‘may’ be a waste of time.” Id.,\nat 1303, n. 8. It added that Jefferson did not “point to any\nparticular finding that was clearly erroneous,” id., at 1304,\nn. 8—applying the same standard Jefferson had proposed\nin his brief, see supra, at 3. Even the dissent agreed that\n6                  JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe court was “obliged to accept” the state courts’ credibil\nity determination, despite the “reasons to doubt it.” 570\nF. 3d, at 1312 (opinion of Carnes, J.). The dissent did not\ncite §2254(d)(2), (6), or (7), but instead focused on the\nsame question of constitutional law that occupied Jeffer\nson’s briefs, the District Court’s opinion, and the major\nity’s opinion: whether, accepting the factual findings and\ncredibility determination of the state courts as true, Jef\nferson’s attorneys rendered ineffective assistance of coun\nsel. That is only the question that occupied the courts and\nthe parties below.\n                              B\n  It is bad enough that the Court decides an issue not\nraised or resolved in the lower courts. It is much worse\nthat it decides an issue Jefferson has not even asked us to\naddress. Under this Court’s Rule 14.1(a), “[o]nly the\nquestions set forth in the petition, or fairly included\ntherein, will be considered by the Court.” We apply that\nrule in all but “the most exceptional cases, where reasons\nof urgency or of economy suggest the need to address the\nunpresented question under consideration.” Yee v. Escon\ndido, 503 U.

Nor does that\nquestion necessarily encompass whether the Court of\nAppeals misapplied that version of §2254(d) in determin\ning the deference due to the state courts’ factual findings.\nThe statutory question may be “related to,” and “perhaps\ncomplementary to the one petitioner presented,” but it is\nnot “fairly included therein.” Yee, supra, at 537 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   As for the body of Jefferson’s petition: Far from invoking\n§2254(d)’s exceptions to the presumption of correctness to\nsupport the Sixth Amendment claim, the petition does not\neven mention subsection (d), let alone paragraphs (2), (6),\nor (7). There is no argument, anywhere in the section\nentitled “Reasons for Granting the Writ,” that the state\ncourts’ factual findings are not entitled to a presumption\nof correctness.\n   The Court claims, ante, at 6, that Jefferson sufficiently\npresented the statutory issue by his characterizations of\nthe state courts’ factual findings in the “Statement of the\nCase” section of his petition, see Pet. for Cert. 11–13, 17,\nn. 12, 18, n. 13. Even if that were so, “ ‘the fact that [peti\ntioner] discussed this issue in the text of [his] petition for\ncertiorari does not bring it before us. Rule 14.1(a) requires\nthat a subsidiary question be fairly included in the ques\ntion presented for our review.’ ” Wood v. Allen, 558 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 13) (quoting Izumi Seimitsu\nKogyo Kabushiki Kaisha v. U. S. Philips Corp., 510 U. S.\n27, 31, n. 5 (1993) (per curiam)). But in any event, the\ncited passages do not remotely present the statutory issue.\nThey contain no argument that §2254(d)’s presumption is\ninapplicable because of §2254(d)(2), (6), or (7), but merely\ndescribe the proceedings below, see Pet. for Cert. 11–13,\nand assert that there might be reasons to doubt the state\n8                  JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncourt findings (but for the §2254(d) presumption), see id.,\nat 17, n. 12, 18, n. 13.\n  “The premise of our adversarial system is that appellate\ncourts do not sit as self-directed boards of legal inquiry\nand research, but essentially as arbiters of legal questions\npresented and argued by the parties before them.” Car\nducci v. Regan, 714 F. 2d 171, 177 (CADC 1983) (opinion\nof Scalia, J.). Our refusal to abide by standard rules of\nappellate practice is unfair to the Eleventh Circuit, whose\njudgment the Court vacates, and especially to the respon\ndent here, who suffers a loss in this Court without ever\nhaving an opportunity to address the merits of the statu\ntory question the Court decides.\n                             II\n   The Court’s approach would be objectionable even if it\nwere correct that the Court of Appeals went astray. But\nit is not. The Court of Appeals did not treat §2254(d)(8)\nas “the exclusive statutory exception” to the presumption\nof correctness. Ante, at 10. It is true that the major\nity’s opinion—as well as the dissent’s—discussed only\n§2254(d)(8). But that is because only §2254(d)(8), and\nnot §2254(d)(2), (6), or (7), was ever brought to the\ncourt’s attention. On the fair reading we owe the Elev\nenth Circuit’s opinion, there simply was no error in its\napplication of §2254(d).\n   The Court asserts, however, that the Eleventh Circuit\nignored the other seven paragraphs in §2254(d) when it\n“invoked Circuit precedent that applied only paragraph (8)\nof §2254(d).” Ante, at 9. It did nothing of the sort. The\nCourt of Appeals said that a state court’s factual findings\n“may be disregarded if, for example, they are not ‘fairly\nsupported by the record,’ Jackson v. Herring, 42 F. 3d\n1350, 1366 (11th Cir. 1995) (quoting 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(d)(8)).” 570 F. 3d, at 1300 (emphasis added). The\nCourt of Appeals thus expressly acknowledged that\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n§2254(d)(8) was but one example of the grounds for disre\ngarding a state court’s factual findings. And the Circuit\nprecedent it cited, Jackson v. Herring, similarly did not\nimply, much less hold, that §2254(d)(8) provided the only\ngrounds for setting aside a state court’s factual findings\nunder §2254(d). See 42 F. 3d, at 1366.\n  Next, the Court states:\n    “And even though the Court of Appeals ‘recognize[d]’\n    that Jefferson had argued that the state court’s proc\n    ess had produced factual findings that were ‘ “dubious\n    at best,” ’ and that federal courts should therefore\n    ‘ “harbor serious doubts about” ’ the state court’s\n    ‘ “findings of fact and credibility,” ’ the Court of Ap\n    peals nonetheless held that the state court’s findings\n    are ‘ “entitled to a presumption of correctness” ’ that it\n    was ‘ “duty-bound” ’ to apply. 570 F. 3d, at 1304, n. 8\n    (quoting Appeals Brief 32, n. 10).” Ante, at 9.\nAgain, the Court has plucked isolated language from here\nand there in the Court of Appeals’ opinion, to produce a\nreading which suggests that the Court of Appeals agreed\nwith, or at least did not contest, Jefferson’s claim of “seri\nous doubts.” That is not so. In the first paragraph of\nfootnote eight of its opinion, the panel reasoned that it was\n“duty-bound to accept” the state courts’ factual findings\nbecause it concluded they “are clear, unambiguous, and\nfairly supported by the record.” 570 F. 3d, at 1303–1304,\nn. 8. That language precedes the panel’s analysis—in the\nsecond paragraph of footnote eight—regarding Jefferson’s\nstatements that the findings were “dubious” and raised\n“serious doubts.” The Court omits the panel’s actual\nexplanation for declining to credit Jefferson’s general\ncharacterization of the quality of the record, which is:\n“Jefferson does not point to any particular factual finding\nthat was clearly erroneous, and Jefferson even says in the\nargument section of his brief that, ‘[t]he relevant facts are\n10                       JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nnot in dispute.’ ” Id., at 1304, n. 8.\n  By the way, even if the Court of Appeals had carelessly\ndescribed application of the pre-AEDPA version of\n§2254(d) in the manner which the Court suggests, that\nwould have been no worse than what we have done. For\nexample, in Demosthenes v. Baal, 495 U. S. 731, 735\n(1990) (per curiam), we stated that a federal court may not\noverturn a state habeas court’s factual determinations\n“unless it concludes that they are not ‘fairly supported by\nthe record.’ See 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(8).” And in Parker v.\nDugger, 498 U. S. 308, 320 (1991), we explained that a\nfederal habeas court “is not to overturn a factual conclu\nsion of a state court, including a state appellate court,\nunless the conclusion is not ‘fairly supported by the\nrecord.’ ”2\n                       *   *    *\n   Generally speaking, we have no power to set aside the\nduly entered judgment of a lower federal court unless we\nfind it to have been in error. More specifically, except\nwhere there has been an intervening legal development\n(such as a subsequently announced opinion of ours) that\n——————\n  2 The  Court attempts to distinguish these two cases on the ground\nthat they contained “no suggestion that any other provisions enumer\nated in §2254(d) were at issue,” whereas “[t]hat is not the case here.”\nAnte, at 10. That is simply not so. As already noted, there was no\n“suggestion” here (let alone an actual argument) that paragraphs (2),\n(6), or (7) were in issue. And if the Court means no more than that\npetitioner here made some process-type noises, the same was true—and\nindeed more true—of Parker and Demosthenes. In Parker, we stated\nthe “crux of [petitioner’s] contentions” was that the state courts “fail[ed]\nto treat adequately” the evidence he presented. 498 U. S., at 313. In\nDemosthenes, the Ninth Circuit had said that the state court’s process\nfor determining whether the capital inmate was competent was defi\ncient because “ ‘a full evidentiary hearing on competence should have\nbeen held.’ ” 495 U. S., at 736 (quoting Order in Baal v. Godinez, No.\n90–15716 (CA9, June 2, 1990), p. 5).\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Decided May 24, 2010\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Petitioner Lawrence Jefferson, who has been sentenced\nto death, claimed in both state and federal courts that his\nlawyers were constitutionally inadequate because they\nfailed to investigate a traumatic head injury that he suf\nfered as a child. The state court rejected that claim after\nmaking a finding that the attorneys were advised by an\nexpert that such investigation was unnecessary. Under\nthe governing federal statute, that factual finding is pre\nsumed correct unless any one of eight exceptions applies.\nSee 28 U. S. C. §§2254(d)(1)–(8) (1994 ed.). But the Court\nof Appeals considered only one of those exceptions (specifi\ncally §2254(d)(8)). And on that basis, it considered itself\n“duty-bound” to accept the state court’s finding, and re\njected Jefferson’s claim.

UPTON\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nthat, as a result of his head injury, Jefferson has “perma\nnent brain damage” that “causes abnormal behavior” over\nwhich he “has no or substantially limited control.” 490\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1321–1322. According to these experts,\nJefferson’s condition causes “ ‘emotional dullness,’ ” “ ‘rest\nless or aggressive characteristics,’ ” “ ‘impulsiveness,’ ”\n“ ‘temper outbursts,’ ” “ ‘markedly diminished impulse\ncontrol,’ ” “ ‘impaired social judgment,’ ” and “ ‘transient\noutbursts of rage which are totally inconsistent with his\nnormal behavioral pattern.’ ” Id., at 1322, 1327.\n    The experts further testified that Jefferson’s “ ‘severe\ncognitive disabilities’ ” “ ‘profoundly alter’ ” his “ ‘ability to\nplan and coordinate his actions, to be aware of the conse\nquences of his behavior, and to engage in premeditated or\nintentional acts.’ ” Id., at 1327. But they testified he is\nneither psychotic nor retarded. Id., at 1319. Thus, they\nsaid, to a lay observer or even to a professional psycholo\ngist, Jefferson does not outwardly appear mentally im\npaired. Indeed, according to the experts, “ ‘the behavior\nthat may result from’ ” his condition “ ‘could, without the\nadministration of proper testing, be mistaken for voli\ntional.’ ” Id., at 1322.\n    Jefferson faced a death sentence for killing his co\nworker while the two men were fishing. Id., at 1271–1272.\nPrior to trial, he was examined by a psychologist named\nDr. Gary Dudley, who prepared a formal report in which\nhe concluded that Jefferson’s mental deficiencies do not\nimpair “ ‘his judgment or decision-making capacity.’ ” 570\nF. 3d, at 1294 (quoting report). But Dr. Dudley’s report\nincluded a caveat: “ ‘One possibility that could not be\nexplored because of [Jefferson’s] incarceration has to do\nwith the sequelae,’ ” i.e., pathologies, related to a “ ‘head\ninjury experienced during childhood.’ ” Ibid. “ ‘In my\nopinion,’ ” he wrote, “ ‘it would be worthwhile to conduct\nneuropsychological evaluation of this individual to rule out\nan organic etiology,’ ” i.e., to rule out brain damage. Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n   Although “it is undisputed that the testing” Dr. Dudley\nrecommended “could have easily been performed,” 490\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1322, and that Jefferson’s attorneys pos\nsessed police reports and hospital records recounting his\nhead injury, id., at 1323, the attorneys did not have Jef\nferson tested. At sentencing, they presented only testi\nmony from two prison guards, who stated that Jefferson\nwas an unproblematic inmate, and from three members of\nJefferson’s family, who testified that he is a “responsible,\ngenerous, gentle, and kind” person and “a good father.”\n570 F. 3d, at 1290–1291. And while Jefferson’s mother\nbriefly mentioned the car accident, “she was not ques\ntioned and did not offer any testimony regarding the\nimpact, if any, that the accident had on him.” Id., at 1291.\nThus, “[a]s far as the jury knew, Jefferson did not suffer\nfrom brain damage or neurological impairment; he had no\norganic disorders”; and “his emotional stability, impulse\ncontrol, and judgment were perfectly normal.” Id., at 1311\n(Carnes, J., dissenting).\n   Jefferson sought habeas relief in state court, arguing\nthat his two trial attorneys unreasonably failed to pursue\nbrain-damage testing. In response, the trial attorneys\ntestified that they did not pursue such testing because,\nafter delivering his formal written report, Dr. Dudley later\ntold them that further investigation “ ‘may be a waste of\ntime because the rest of [his] report’ ” had “ ‘said that\n[Jefferson] was non psychotic.’ ” 570 F. 3d, at 1295 (quot\ning testimony). Dr. Dudley did not testify in person at the\nhearing, but he submitted a sworn affidavit denying that\nhe had ever made such statements. He said “it had al\nways been his expert opinion ‘that neuropsychological\ntesting was necessary’ ” and that when he wrote as much\nin his formal report “he ‘meant it.’ ” Id., at 1312 (Carnes,\nJ., dissenting) (quoting affidavit). He added, “ ‘I never,\nbefore or after that report, suggested to [Jefferson’s attor\nneys] that such an evaluation was not necessary or that it\n4                   JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nwould not be worthwhile.’ ” Ibid.; cf. Pet. for Cert. 17,\nn. 12.\n   Jefferson contends, and the State has not disputed, that\nafter the hearing concluded the state-court judge con\ntacted the attorneys for the State ex parte. And in a pri\nvate conversation that included neither Jefferson nor his\nattorneys, the judge asked the State’s attorneys to draft\nthe opinion of the court. See id., at 3, 12. According to\nJefferson, no such request was made of him, nor was he\ninformed of the request made to opposing counsel. Id., at\n12, n. 8, 13; see also Jefferson v. Zant, 263 Ga. 316, 431\nS. E. 2d 110, 111 (1993) (“Jefferson contends [the order]\namounts to no more and no less than a reply brief to which\n[he] has not had a chance to respond”).\n   The attorneys for the State prepared an opinion finding\nthat “Dr. Dudley led [Jefferson’s trial attorneys] to believe\nthat further investigation would simply be a waste of time\nbecause Petitioner [i]s not psychotic.” Jefferson v. Zant,\nCiv. Action No. 87–V–1241 (Super. Ct. Butts Cty., Ga.,\nOct. 7, 1992), p. 16, App. 4 to Pet. for Cert. 16 (hereinafter\nState Order); see also id., at 37. The opinion “specifically\ncredits the testimony of [the trial attorneys] with regard to\ntheir efforts to investigate Petitioner’s mental condition.”\nId., at 18; see also id., at 36. And relying on these find\nings, it concludes that Jefferson’s attorneys “made a rea\nsonable investigation into [his] mental health” and were\nthus not ineffective. Id., at 37.\n   Notably, as the Georgia Supreme Court acknowledged,\nthe State’s opinion discusses statements purportedly made\non Jefferson’s behalf by a witness “who did not testify” or\nparticipate in the proceedings. 263 Ga., at 318, 431 S. E.\n2d, at 112; see State Order 24–25. Nonetheless, the opin\nion “was adopted verbatim by the [state] court.” 263 Ga.,\nat 316, 431 S. E. 2d, at 111. And while the State Supreme\nCourt recognized that we have “ ‘criticized’ ” such a prac\ntice, it affirmed the judgment. Id., at 317, 320, 431 S. E.\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

S. 564, 572 (1985)).\n                               II\n   Jefferson next sought federal habeas relief in the Dis\ntrict Court. In his opening brief, he argued that “there is\nno reason under principles of comity or otherwise to give\nany deference to the findings of the State Habeas Corpus\nCourt.” Brief for Petitioner in No. 1:96–CV–989–CC (ND\nGa.), Doc. 105, p. 4, and n. 1 (hereinafter District Court\nBrief). In support of that argument, he claimed that the\nstate court “merely signed an order drafted by the State\nwithout revision of a single word,” even though the order\n“described witnesses who never testified.” Ibid. And he\nsaid that such a process “rais[es] serious doubts as to\nwhether [the judge] even read, much less carefully consid\nered, the proposed order submitted by the State.” Ibid.\n   The District Court ruled in Jefferson’s favor. It noted\nthat under the relevant statute “factual findings of state\ncourts are presumed to be correct unless one of . . . eight\nenumerated exceptions . . . applies.” 490 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1280; see also id., at 1280, n. 5 (listing the exceptions).\nAnd it acknowledged “the state habeas corpus court’s\nfailure to explain the basis” for its credibility findings. Id.,\nat 1324, n. 17. But it accepted Jefferson’s claim of ineffec\ntive assistance of counsel without disturbing the state\ncourt’s factual findings because it believed he should\nprevail even accepting those findings as true. Id., at\n1324–1325.\n   On appeal, Jefferson defended the District Court’s judg\nment primarily on its own terms. But he also argued that\nthe state court’s factfinding was “dubious at best” in light\nof the process that court employed, and that the Court of\nAppeals therefore “should harbor serious doubts about the\nfindings of fact and credibility determinations in the state\ncourt record.” Brief for Petitioner/Appellee in No. 07–\n6                   JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n12502 (CA11), pp. 31–32, n. 10 (hereinafter Appeals Brief).\n  A divided Court of Appeals panel reversed, and Jeffer\nson filed this petition for certiorari asking us to review his\nclaim of ineffective assistance of counsel. And, in so doing,\nhe challenges—as he did in the State Supreme Court, the\nDistrict Court, and the Court of Appeals—“the fact find\nings of the state court,” given what he describes as the\ndeficient procedure employed by that court while reviewing\nhis claim. Pet. for Cert. 11–13, 17, n. 12, 18, n. 13 (re\ncounting “ ‘reason[s] to doubt’ ” the state court’s findings).\nCf. Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation,\n513 U. S. 374, 379 (1995) (stating standard for preserving\nan issue for review in this Court).\n                               III\n   This habeas application was filed prior to the enactment\nof the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 and is therefore governed by federal habeas law as it\nexisted prior to that point. Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S.\n320, 326–336 (1997). In 1963, we set forth the “appropri\nate standard” to be applied by a “federal court in habeas\ncorpus” when “the facts” pertinent to a habeas application\n“are in dispute.” Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 312.\nWe held that when “the habeas applicant was afforded a\nfull and fair hearing by the state court resulting in reliable\nfindings” the district court “ordinarily should . . . accept\nthe facts as found” by the state-court judge. Id., at 318.\nHowever, “if the habeas applicant did not receive a full\nand fair evidentiary hearing in a state court, either at the\ntime of the trial or in a collateral proceeding,” we held that\nthe federal court “must hold an evidentiary hearing” to\nresolve any facts that “are in dispute.” Id., at 312. We\nfurther “explain[ed] the controlling criteria” by enumerat\ning six circumstances in which such an evidentiary hear\ning would be required:\n    “(1) the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n    in the state hearing; (2) the state factual determina\n    tion is not fairly supported by the record as a whole;\n    (3) the fact-finding procedure employed by the state\n    court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hear\n    ing; (4) there is a substantial allegation of newly dis\n    covered evidence; (5) the material facts were not ade\n    quately developed at the state-court hearing; or (6) for\n    any reason it appears that the state trier of fact did not\n    afford the habeas applicant a full and fair fact hear\n    ing.” Id., at 313 (emphasis added).\n  Three years later, in 1966, Congress enacted an\namendment to the federal habeas statute that “was an\nalmost verbatim codification of the standards delineated\nin Townsend v. Sain.” Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 111\n(1985). That codification read in relevant part as follows:\n      “In any proceeding instituted in a Federal court by\n    an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person\n    in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court,\n    a determination . . . of a factual issue, made by a State\n    court of competent jurisdiction . . . , shall be presumed\n    to be correct, unless the applicant shall establish or\n    it shall otherwise appear, or the respondent shall\n    admit—\n      “(1) that the merits of the factual dispute were not\n    resolved in the State court hearing;\n      “(2) that the factfinding procedure employed by the\n    State court was not adequate to afford a full and fair\n    hearing;\n      “(3) that the material facts were not adequately de\n    veloped at the State court hearing;\n      “(4) that the State court lacked jurisdiction of the\n    subject matter or over the person of the applicant in\n    the State court proceeding;\n      “(5) that the applicant was an indigent and the\n    State court, in deprivation of his constitutional right,\n8                   JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n    failed to appoint counsel to represent him in the State\n    court proceeding;\n       “(6) that the applicant did not receive a full, fair,\n    and adequate hearing in the State court proceeding; or\n       “(7) that the applicant was otherwise denied due\n    process of law in the State court proceeding;\n       “(8) or unless . . . the Federal court on a considera\n    tion of [the relevant] part of the record as a whole con\n    cludes that such factual determination is not fairly\n    supported by the record.” §2254(d) (emphasis added).\nAs is clear from the statutory text quoted above, and as\nthe District Court correctly stated, if any “one of the eight\nenumerated exceptions . . . applies” then “the state court’s\nfactfinding is not presumed correct.” 490 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1280; accord, Miller, supra, at 105 (“Under 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(d), state-court findings of fact ‘shall be presumed to\nbe correct’ in a federal habeas corpus proceeding unless\none of eight enumerated exceptions applies”); see also 1 R.\nHertz & J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and\nProcedure §20.2c, pp. 915–918 (5th ed. 2005).\n  Jefferson has consistently argued that the federal courts\n“should harbor serious doubts about” and should not “give\nany deference to” the “findings of fact and credibility\ndeterminations” made by the state habeas court because\nthose findings were drafted exclusively by the attorneys\nfor the State pursuant to an ex parte request from the\nstate-court judge, who made no such request of Jefferson,\nfailed to notify Jefferson of the request made to opposing\ncounsel, and adopted the State’s proposed opinion verba\ntim even though it recounted evidence from a nonexistent\nwitness. See, e.g., Appeals Brief 32, n. 10; District Court\nBrief 4, n. 1; Pet. for Cert. 12. These are arguments that\nthe state court’s process was deficient. In other words,\nthey are arguments that Jefferson “did not receive a full\nand fair evidentiary hearing in . . . state court.” Town\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             9\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nsend, supra, at 312. Or, to use the statutory language,\nthey are arguments that the state court’s “factfinding\nprocedure,” “hearing,” and “proceeding” were not “full,\nfair, and adequate.” §§2254(d)(2), (6), (7).\n   But the Court of Appeals did not consider the state\ncourt’s process when it applied the statutory presumption\nof correctness. Instead, it invoked Circuit precedent that\napplied only paragraph (8) of §2254(d), which, codifying\nthe second Townsend exception, 372 U. S., at 313, lifts the\npresumption of correctness for findings that are “not fairly\nsupported by the record.” See 570 F. 3d, at 1300 (quoting\nJackson v. Herring, 42 F. 3d 1350, 1366 (CA11 1995), in\nturn quoting 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(8)). And even though\nthe Court of Appeals “recognize[d]” that Jefferson had\nargued that the state court’s process had produced factual\nfindings that were “ ‘dubious at best,’ ” and that federal\ncourts should therefore “ ‘harbor serious doubts about’ ” the\nstate court’s “ ‘findings of fact and credibility,’ ” the Court\nof Appeals nonetheless held that the state court’s findings\nare “ ‘entitled to a presumption of correctness’ ” that it was\n“duty-bound” to apply. 570 F. 3d, at 1304, n. 8 (quoting\nAppeals Brief 32, n. 10). The Court of Appeals explicitly\nstated that it considered itself “duty-bound” to defer to the\nstate court’s findings because “Jefferson has not argued\nthat any of the state courts’ factual findings were ‘not\nfairly supported by the record,’ ” a direct reference to\n§2254(d)(8) and to the second Townsend exception. 570\nF. 3d, at 1304, n. 8 (emphasis added). And it then con\ncluded: “Based on these factual findings of the state ha\nbeas courts—all of which are fairly supported by the re\ncord—we believe that Jefferson’s counsel were reasonable\nin deciding not to pursue neuropsychological testing.” Id.,\nat 1304 (emphasis added).\n   In our view, the Court of Appeals did not properly con\nsider the legal status of the state court’s factual findings.\nUnder Townsend, as codified by the governing statute, a\n10                 JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nfederal court is not “duty-bound” to accept any and all\nstate-court findings that are “fairly supported by the\nrecord.” Those words come from §2254(d)(8), which is only\none of eight enumerated exceptions to the presumption of\ncorrectness. But there are seven others, see §§2254(d)(1)–\n(7), none of which the Court of Appeals considered when\naddressing Jefferson’s claim. To be sure, we have previ\nously stated in cases applying §2254(d)(8) that “a federal\ncourt” may not overturn a state court’s factual conclusion\n“unless the conclusion is not ‘fairly supported by the re\ncord.’ ” Parker v. Dugger, 498 U. S. 308, 320 (1991) (grant\ning federal habeas relief after rejecting state court’s find\ning under §2254(d)(8)); see also Demosthenes v. Baal, 495\nU. S. 731 (1990) (per curiam) (applying §2254(d)(8)); cf.\npost, at 10 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). But in those cases\nthere was no suggestion that any other provisions enu\nmerated in §2254(d) were at issue. That is not the case\nhere. In treating §2254(d)(8) as the exclusive statutory\nexception, and by failing to address Jefferson’s argument\nthat the state court’s procedures deprived its findings of\ndeference, the Court of Appeals applied the statute and\nour precedents incorrectly.\n   Although we have stated that a court’s “verbatim adop\ntion of findings of fact prepared by prevailing parties”\nshould be treated as findings of the court, we have also\ncriticized that practice. Anderson, 470 U. S., at 572. And\nwe have not considered the lawfulness of, nor the applica\ntion of the habeas statute to, the use of such a practice\nwhere (1) a judge solicits the proposed findings ex parte,\n(2) does not provide the opposing party an opportunity to\ncriticize the findings or to submit his own, or (3) adopts\nfindings that contain internal evidence suggesting that\nthe judge may not have read them. Cf. id., at 568; Ga.\nCode of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3(A)(4) (1993) (prohibit\ning ex parte judicial communications).\n   We decline to determine in the first instance whether\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

But the precise nature of what tran\nspired during the state-court proceedings is not fully\nknown. See 263 Ga. at 316–317, 431 S. E. 2d, at 111\n(noting dispute as to whether Jefferson “had a chance to\nrespond” to the final order); see also Pet. for Cert. 13.\n   Accordingly, we believe it necessary for the lower courts\nto determine on remand whether the state court’s factual\nfindings warrant a presumption of correctness, and to\nconduct any further proceedings as may be appropriate in\nlight of their resolution of that issue. See Townsend,\nsupra, at 313–319; Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U. S. 1\n(1992).

Decided May 24, 2010\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\ndissenting.\n   The question presented by Jefferson’s petition for writ of\ncertiorari is whether his trial attorneys rendered ineffec\ntive assistance of counsel when they declined to pursue\nfurther investigation of Jefferson’s childhood head injury.\nIn my view the Court should either answer that question\nor (as I would prefer) deny the petition. Instead, it sum\nmarily vacates the judgment of the Court of Appeals on an\naltogether different ground that was neither raised nor\npassed upon below and that is not fairly included within\nthe sole question presented. To make matters worse, the\nCourt conjures up an “error” with respect to that ground\nby misquoting and mischaracterizing the Court of Appeals’\nopinion, ante, at 9–10, and by overlooking relevant author\nity from this Court. I respectfully dissent.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n  The prior version of 28 U. S. C. §2254(d) (1994 ed.)\napplicable in this case provided that in federal habeas\nproceedings the factual determinations of a state court\n“shall be presumed to be correct,” unless the applicant\nproves, the respondent admits, or a federal court deter\nmines that one of eight exceptions set forth in §2254(d)(1)–\n(8) applies. The Court concludes that the Eleventh Circuit\n2                      JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nmisapplied that provision and our precedents by treating\none of those exceptions, §2254(d)(8), “as the exclusive\nstatutory exception” to the presumption of correctness,\nand by failing to address whether §2254(d)(2), (6), or (7)\nmight also bar application of that presumption.1 Ante, at\n10.\n   The Court’s opinion, however, is the first anyone (in\ncluding Jefferson) has heard of this argument. Jefferson’s\nbriefs below contain no discussion or even citation of sub\nsection (d)—let alone of paragraphs (2), (6), or (7)—and the\ncourts below understandably never passed upon the appli\ncation of those provisions. Under our longstanding prac\ntice, that should be the end of the matter. See, e.g., Penn\nsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U. S. 206, 212–\n213 (1998).\n   But the Court insists, ante, at 5–6, 8–9, that if we squint\nat them long enough we can see in Jefferson’s briefs below\na challenge to the state court’s fact-finding process cogni\nzable under §2254(d)(2), (6), and (7). But the handful of\nisolated, vague statements it musters (buried in hundreds\nof pages of briefs) show no such thing. The Court’s only\nevidence that Jefferson presented the point to the District\nCourt, ante, at 5, 8, consists of a single sentence of text\n(and an accompanying two-sentence footnote) in the “Prior\nProceedings” section of his 180-page brief. Final Eviden\ntiary Brief and Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions\n——————\n    1 These\n          four exceptions in 28 U. S. C. §2254(d) (1994 ed.) were:\n  “(2) that the factfinding procedure employed by the State court was\nnot adequate to afford a full and fair hearing;\n             .           .           .          .           .\n  “(6) that the applicant did not receive a full, fair, and adequate\nhearing in the State court proceeding; or\n  “(7) that the applicant was otherwise denied due process of law in the\nState court proceeding;\n  “(8) or unless . . . the Federal court on a consideration of [the rele\nvant] part of the record as a whole concludes that such factual determi\nnation is not fairly supported by the record . . . .”\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nof Law, Record in No. 1:96–CV–989–CC (ND Ga.), Doc.\n105 (hereinafter District Court Brief). The sentence is: “In\nentering the State Habeas Corpus Order Judge Newton\nmerely signed an order drafted by the State without revi\nsion of a single word.” Id., at 4. The footnote adds:\n       “[T]he order signed by Judge Newton described wit\n    nesses who never testified, raising serious doubt as to\n    whether he even read, much less carefully considered,\n    the proposed order submitted by the State. In this\n    circumstance, there is no reason under principles of\n    comity or otherwise to give any deference to the find\n    ings of the State Habeas Court, because there was ap\n    parently no serious consideration or deliberation of\n    the factual and legal issues raised.” Ibid., n. 1.\nThis passing suggestion that deference would be unwar\nranted is, to put it mildly, an elliptical way to argue that\nthe state fact-finding procedure was inadequate,\n§2254(d)(2), that Jefferson was denied a full, fair, and\nadequate hearing, §2254(d)(6), or that Jefferson was de\nnied due process of law, §2254(d)(7). And it only appeared,\nI emphasize again, in the “Prior Proceedings” section of\nthe brief. The argument section of Jefferson’s District\nCourt Brief, consisting of 164 pages and containing sepa\nrate assignments of error from III to XLIV (44), makes no\nmention of the ground upon which the Court today relies.\nAnd the assignment of error that is the basis for the ques\ntion presented in Jefferson’s petition, VI, id., at 47–80, did\nnot dispute the state courts’ factual findings under\n§2254(d), but only challenged the state courts’ legal con\nclusion that his attorneys’ failure to conduct a fuller inves\ntigation into the head injury he suffered as a child was not\ndeficient performance under Strickland v. Washington,\n466 U. S. 668 (1984).\n   Jefferson also did not raise the point in the Eleventh\nCircuit. His brief to that court acknowledged that the\n4                   JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nstate courts’ “[f]indings of fact and credibility determina\ntions are reviewed for clear error.” Brief for Peti\ntioner/Appellee, No. 07–12502, pp. 16–17 (hereinafter\nAppeals Brief). It declared that “The District Court Cor\nrectly Deferred to the Fact Findings of the State Court” in\nadjudicating his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.\nId., at 21 (capitalization and boldface type deleted); see\nalso id., at 29, and n. 7, 31. And it conceded that with\nrespect to the ineffective-assistance claim, “[t]he relevant\nfacts are not in dispute.” Id., at 24. Jefferson did charac\nterize the state habeas court’s factual findings as gener\nally “dubious” and suggested there were “serious doubts”\nabout them, id., at 32, n. 10. But not once did he argue\nthat the dubiousness of the findings was the consequence\nof a failure to meet the requirements of §2254(d)(2), (6), or\n(7)—or even more generally that the findings should not\nbe presumed correct under §2254(d). Instead, he pressed\nthe same argument he made in the District Court: Even if\nthe state courts’ factual findings were correct, his trial\nattorneys rendered ineffective assistance in deciding to\nforgo further investigation of his childhood head injury.\nId., at 31–33, 50–51.\n   Nor did the courts below pass upon the argument the\nCourt now addresses. The District Court did not dispute\nthe state courts’ factual findings. Jefferson v. Terry, 490\nF. Supp. 2d 1261, 1319–1320 (ND Ga. 2007). It accepted\nthose findings as true, including the state habeas court’s\ncredibility findings, id., at 1323–1324, and n. 17, but held\n“as a matter of law” that it was objectively unreasonable\nfor Jefferson’s attorneys “not to investigate” further into\nthe effect, if any, of the accident on Jefferson’s mental\ncapacity and health, id., at 1324. Concluding that Jeffer\nson was thereby prejudiced, the court ordered a new sen\ntencing hearing. Id., at 1328.\n   The Court of Appeals disagreed with that determination\nand reversed, holding that his trial attorneys’ performance\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nwas not objectively unreasonable under Strickland. Jef\nferson v. Hall, 570 F. 3d 1283, 1301–1309 (CA11 2009).\nThat court correctly stated the applicable framework\nunder §2254(d):\n       “Pre-AEDPA, questions of law and mixed questions\n    of law and fact resolved by state habeas courts are re\n    viewed de novo, while the state courts’ factual findings\n    are ‘subject to the presumption of correctness.’\n    Freund v. Butterworth, 165 F. 3d 839, 861 (11th Cir.\n    1999). Although these findings may be disregarded if,\n    for example, they are not ‘fairly supported by the re\n    cord,’ Jackson v. Herring, 42 F. 3d 1350, 1366 (11th\n    Cir. 1995) (quoting 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(8)), this Court\n    has construed the ‘presumption of correctness’ stan\n    dard to be the same as the ‘clear error’ standard of\n    review.” Id., at 1300 (emphasis added; footnote\n    omitted).\nConfronted with no argument that §2254(d)(1)–(7) applied\nor that it must disregard the state courts’ factual findings,\nthe Court of Appeals understandably did not pass upon\nthose questions.\n  The Court of Appeals did consider the record on its own,\nas required by §2254(d)(8), to determine whether the state\ncourts’ factual determinations were fairly supported by the\nrecord. Id., at 1303–1304, and n. 8. In doing so, the court\n“specifically note[d] that neither Jefferson nor the district\ncourt questioned the state court’s factual finding that [the\ndefense’s psychiatric expert] led [one of Jefferson’s attor\nney’s] to believe that further investigation would simply\nbe a waste of time, . . . despite [his attorney’s] testimony\nthat [the expert] told him it ‘may’ be a waste of time.” Id.,\nat 1303, n. 8. It added that Jefferson did not “point to any\nparticular finding that was clearly erroneous,” id., at 1304,\nn. 8—applying the same standard Jefferson had proposed\nin his brief, see supra, at 3. Even the dissent agreed that\n6                  JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe court was “obliged to accept” the state courts’ credibil\nity determination, despite the “reasons to doubt it.” 570\nF. 3d, at 1312 (opinion of Carnes, J.). The dissent did not\ncite §2254(d)(2), (6), or (7), but instead focused on the\nsame question of constitutional law that occupied Jeffer\nson’s briefs, the District Court’s opinion, and the major\nity’s opinion: whether, accepting the factual findings and\ncredibility determination of the state courts as true, Jef\nferson’s attorneys rendered ineffective assistance of coun\nsel. That is only the question that occupied the courts and\nthe parties below.\n                              B\n  It is bad enough that the Court decides an issue not\nraised or resolved in the lower courts. It is much worse\nthat it decides an issue Jefferson has not even asked us to\naddress. Under this Court’s Rule 14.1(a), “[o]nly the\nquestions set forth in the petition, or fairly included\ntherein, will be considered by the Court.” We apply that\nrule in all but “the most exceptional cases, where reasons\nof urgency or of economy suggest the need to address the\nunpresented question under consideration.” Yee v. Escon\ndido, 503 U. S. 519, 535 (1992) (citation and internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n  Jefferson’s petition for writ of certiorari presents a\nsingle question:\n      “[W]hether the majority opinion, in affording trial\n    counsel’s decision to limit the scope of investigation in\n    a death penalty case ‘higher-than-strong presumption\n    of reasonableness’ [sic] conflicts with this Court’s\n    precedent as announced in Williams v. Taylor, 529\n    U. S. 362 (2000), Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510\n    (2003), Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374 (2005), and\n    Porter v. McCollum, 130 S. Ct. 447 (2009).” Pet. for\n    Cert. i.\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nThis is a straightforward request for error correction on a\nconstitutional claim in light of those four decisions, and\nneither the request nor those cases have anything to do\nwith the pre-AEDPA version of §2254(d). Nor does that\nquestion necessarily encompass whether the Court of\nAppeals misapplied that version of §2254(d) in determin\ning the deference due to the state courts’ factual findings.\nThe statutory question may be “related to,” and “perhaps\ncomplementary to the one petitioner presented,” but it is\nnot “fairly included therein.” Yee, supra, at 537 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   As for the body of Jefferson’s petition: Far from invoking\n§2254(d)’s exceptions to the presumption of correctness to\nsupport the Sixth Amendment claim, the petition does not\neven mention subsection (d), let alone paragraphs (2), (6),\nor (7). There is no argument, anywhere in the section\nentitled “Reasons for Granting the Writ,” that the state\ncourts’ factual findings are not entitled to a presumption\nof correctness.\n   The Court claims, ante, at 6, that Jefferson sufficiently\npresented the statutory issue by his characterizations of\nthe state courts’ factual findings in the “Statement of the\nCase” section of his petition, see Pet. for Cert. 11–13, 17,\nn. 12, 18, n. 13. Even if that were so, “ ‘the fact that [peti\ntioner] discussed this issue in the text of [his] petition for\ncertiorari does not bring it before us. Rule 14.1(a) requires\nthat a subsidiary question be fairly included in the ques\ntion presented for our review.’ ” Wood v. Allen, 558 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 13) (quoting Izumi Seimitsu\nKogyo Kabushiki Kaisha v. U. S. Philips Corp., 510 U. S.\n27, 31, n. 5 (1993) (per curiam)). But in any event, the\ncited passages do not remotely present the statutory issue.\nThey contain no argument that §2254(d)’s presumption is\ninapplicable because of §2254(d)(2), (6), or (7), but merely\ndescribe the proceedings below, see Pet. for Cert. 11–13,\nand assert that there might be reasons to doubt the state\n8                  JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncourt findings (but for the §2254(d) presumption), see id.,\nat 17, n. 12, 18, n. 13.\n  “The premise of our adversarial system is that appellate\ncourts do not sit as self-directed boards of legal inquiry\nand research, but essentially as arbiters of legal questions\npresented and argued by the parties before them.” Car\nducci v. Regan, 714 F. 2d 171, 177 (CADC 1983) (opinion\nof Scalia, J.). Our refusal to abide by standard rules of\nappellate practice is unfair to the Eleventh Circuit, whose\njudgment the Court vacates, and especially to the respon\ndent here, who suffers a loss in this Court without ever\nhaving an opportunity to address the merits of the statu\ntory question the Court decides.\n                             II\n   The Court’s approach would be objectionable even if it\nwere correct that the Court of Appeals went astray. But\nit is not. The Court of Appeals did not treat §2254(d)(8)\nas “the exclusive statutory exception” to the presumption\nof correctness. Ante, at 10. It is true that the major\nity’s opinion—as well as the dissent’s—discussed only\n§2254(d)(8). But that is because only §2254(d)(8), and\nnot §2254(d)(2), (6), or (7), was ever brought to the\ncourt’s attention. On the fair reading we owe the Elev\nenth Circuit’s opinion, there simply was no error in its\napplication of §2254(d).\n   The Court asserts, however, that the Eleventh Circuit\nignored the other seven paragraphs in §2254(d) when it\n“invoked Circuit precedent that applied only paragraph (8)\nof §2254(d).” Ante, at 9. It did nothing of the sort. The\nCourt of Appeals said that a state court’s factual findings\n“may be disregarded if, for example, they are not ‘fairly\nsupported by the record,’ Jackson v. Herring, 42 F. 3d\n1350, 1366 (11th Cir. 1995) (quoting 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(d)(8)).” 570 F. 3d, at 1300 (emphasis added). The\nCourt of Appeals thus expressly acknowledged that\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n§2254(d)(8) was but one example of the grounds for disre\ngarding a state court’s factual findings. And the Circuit\nprecedent it cited, Jackson v. Herring, similarly did not\nimply, much less hold, that §2254(d)(8) provided the only\ngrounds for setting aside a state court’s factual findings\nunder §2254(d). See 42 F. 3d, at 1366.\n  Next, the Court states:\n    “And even though the Court of Appeals ‘recognize[d]’\n    that Jefferson had argued that the state court’s proc\n    ess had produced factual findings that were ‘ “dubious\n    at best,” ’ and that federal courts should therefore\n    ‘ “harbor serious doubts about” ’ the state court’s\n    ‘ “findings of fact and credibility,” ’ the Court of Ap\n    peals nonetheless held that the state court’s findings\n    are ‘ “entitled to a presumption of correctness” ’ that it\n    was ‘ “duty-bound” ’ to apply. 570 F. 3d, at 1304, n. 8\n    (quoting Appeals Brief 32, n. 10).” Ante, at 9.\nAgain, the Court has plucked isolated language from here\nand there in the Court of Appeals’ opinion, to produce a\nreading which suggests that the Court of Appeals agreed\nwith, or at least did not contest, Jefferson’s claim of “seri\nous doubts.” That is not so. In the first paragraph of\nfootnote eight of its opinion, the panel reasoned that it was\n“duty-bound to accept” the state courts’ factual findings\nbecause it concluded they “are clear, unambiguous, and\nfairly supported by the record.” 570 F. 3d, at 1303–1304,\nn. 8. That language precedes the panel’s analysis—in the\nsecond paragraph of footnote eight—regarding Jefferson’s\nstatements that the findings were “dubious” and raised\n“serious doubts.” The Court omits the panel’s actual\nexplanation for declining to credit Jefferson’s general\ncharacterization of the quality of the record, which is:\n“Jefferson does not point to any particular factual finding\nthat was clearly erroneous, and Jefferson even says in the\nargument section of his brief that, ‘[t]he relevant facts are\n10                       JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nnot in dispute.’ ” Id., at 1304, n. 8.\n  By the way, even if the Court of Appeals had carelessly\ndescribed application of the pre-AEDPA version of\n§2254(d) in the manner which the Court suggests, that\nwould have been no worse than what we have done. For\nexample, in Demosthenes v. Baal, 495 U. S. 731, 735\n(1990) (per curiam), we stated that a federal court may not\noverturn a state habeas court’s factual determinations\n“unless it concludes that they are not ‘fairly supported by\nthe record.’ See 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(8).” And in Parker v.\nDugger, 498 U. S. 308, 320 (1991), we explained that a\nfederal habeas court “is not to overturn a factual conclu\nsion of a state court, including a state appellate court,\nunless the conclusion is not ‘fairly supported by the\nrecord.’ ”2\n                       *   *    *\n   Generally speaking, we have no power to set aside the\nduly entered judgment of a lower federal court unless we\nfind it to have been in error. More specifically, except\nwhere there has been an intervening legal development\n(such as a subsequently announced opinion of ours) that\n——————\n  2 The  Court attempts to distinguish these two cases on the ground\nthat they contained “no suggestion that any other provisions enumer\nated in §2254(d) were at issue,” whereas “[t]hat is not the case here.”\nAnte, at 10. That is simply not so. As already noted, there was no\n“suggestion” here (let alone an actual argument) that paragraphs (2),\n(6), or (7) were in issue. And if the Court means no more than that\npetitioner here made some process-type noises, the same was true—and\nindeed more true—of Parker and Demosthenes. In Parker, we stated\nthe “crux of [petitioner’s] contentions” was that the state courts “fail[ed]\nto treat adequately” the evidence he presented. 498 U. S., at 313. In\nDemosthenes, the Ninth Circuit had said that the state court’s process\nfor determining whether the capital inmate was competent was defi\ncient because “ ‘a full evidentiary hearing on competence should have\nbeen held.’ ” 495 U. S., at 736 (quoting Order in Baal v. Godinez, No.\n90–15716 (CA9, June 2, 1990), p. 5).\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nmight alter the judgment below, we cannot grant a peti\ntion for certiorari, vacate the judgment below, and remand\nthe case (GVR) simply to obtain a re-do. Webster v.\nCooper, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (SCALIA, J., dissenting)\n(slip op., at 3). Yet today the Court vacates the judgment\nof the Eleventh Circuit on the basis of an error that court\ndid not commit, with respect to a statutory issue that had\nnever previously been raised, and remands for more ex\ntensive consideration of a new argument that might affect\nthe judgment. Under the taxonomy of our increasingly\nunprincipled GVR practice, this creature is of the same\ngenus as the “Summary Remand for a More Extensive\nOpinion than Petitioner Requested” (SRMEOPR). Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 4). But it is a distinctly odious species,\ndeserving of its own name: Summary Remand to Ponder a\nPoint Raised Neither Here nor Below (SRPPRNHB).\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/146980/", "sha1": "142c00b296fc9079d99659aca29371d2bc9b9bf5", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2009-058", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-24T07:36:17"}
