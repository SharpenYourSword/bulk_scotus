CITY OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 08–974.      Argued February 22, 2010—Decided May 24, 2010\nIn 1995, respondent the City of Chicago gave a written examination to\n  applicants seeking firefighter positions. In January 1996, the City\n  announced it would draw candidates randomly from a list of appli\n  cants who scored at least 89 out of 100 points on the examination,\n  whom it designated as “well qualified.” It informed those who scored\n  below 65 that they had failed and would not be considered further. It\n  informed applicants who scored between 65 and 88, whom it desig\n  nated as “qualified,” that it was unlikely they would be called for fur\n  ther processing but that the City would keep them on the eligibility\n  list for as long as that list was used. That May, the City selected its\n  first class of applicants to advance, and it repeated this process mul\n  tiple times over the next six years. Beginning in March 1997, several\n  African-American applicants who scored in the “qualified” range but\n  had not been hired filed discrimination charges with the Equal Em\n  ployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and received right-to-sue\n  letters. They then filed suit, alleging (as relevant here) that the\n  City’s practice of selecting only applicants who scored 89 or above\n  had a disparate impact on African-Americans in violation of Title VII\n  of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, see 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i).\n  The District Court certified a class—petitioners here—of African-\n  Americans who scored in the “qualified” range but were not hired.\n  The court denied the City’s summary judgment motion, rejecting its\n  claim that petitioners had failed to file EEOC charges within 300\n  days “after the unlawful employment practice occurred,” §2000e–\n  5(e)(1), and finding instead that the City’s “ongoing reliance” on the\n  1995 test results constituted a continuing Title VII violation. The\n  litigation then proceeded, and petitioners prevailed on the merits.\n  The Seventh Circuit reversed the judgment in their favor, holding\n2                          LEWIS v. CHICAGO\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    that the suit was untimely because the earliest EEOC charge was\n    filed more than 300 days after the only discriminatory act—sorting\n    the scores into the “well qualified,” “qualified,” and “not qualified”\n    categories. The later hiring decisions, the Seventh Circuit held, were\n    an automatic consequence of the test scores, not new discriminatory\n    acts.\nHeld: A plaintiff who does not file a timely charge challenging the adop\n tion of a practice may assert a disparate-impact claim in a timely\n charge challenging the employer’s later application of that practice as\n long as he alleges each of the elements of a disparate-impact claim.\n Pp. 4–11.\n    (a) Determining whether petitioners’ charges were timely requires\n “identify[ing] precisely the ‘unlawful employment practice’ of which”\n they complain. Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U. S. 250, 257.\n With the exception of the first selection round, all agree that the chal\n lenged practice here—the City’s selection of firefighter hires on the\n basis announced in 1996—occurred within the charging period.\n Thus, the question is not whether a claim predicated on that conduct\n is timely, but whether the practice thus defined can be the basis for a\n disparate-impact claim at all. It can. A Title VII plaintiff establishes\n a prima facie claim by showing that the employer “uses a particular\n employment practice that causes a disparate impact” on one of the\n prohibited bases. §2000e–2(k). The term “employment practice”\n clearly encompasses the conduct at issue: exclusion of passing appli\n cants who scored below 89 when selecting those who would advance.\n The City “use[d]” that practice each time it filled a new class of fire\n fighters, and petitioners allege that doing so caused a disparate im\n pact. It is irrelevant that subsection (k) does not address “accrual” of\n disparate-impact claims, since the issue here is not when the claims\n accrued but whether the claims stated a violation. They did.\n Whether petitioners proved a violation is not before the Court.\n Pp. 4–7.\n    (b) The City argues that the only actionable discrimination oc\n curred in 1996 when it used the test results to create the hiring list,\n which it concedes was unlawful. It may be true that the City’s adop\n tion in 1996 of the cutoff score gave rise to a freestanding disparate\n impact claim. If so, because no timely charge was filed, the City is\n now “entitled to treat that past act as lawful,” United Air Lines, Inc.\n v. Evans, 431 U. S. 553, 558. But it does not follow that no new viola\n tion occurred—and no new claims could arise—when the City later\n implemented the 1996 decision. Evans and later cases the City cites\n establish only that a Title VII plaintiff must show a “present viola\n tion” within the limitations period. For disparate-treatment claims—\n which require discriminatory intent—the plaintiff must demonstrate\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  deliberate discrimination within the limitations period. But no such\n  demonstration is needed for claims, such as this one, that do not re\n  quire discriminatory intent. Cf., e.g., Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &\n  Rubber Co., 550 U. S. 618, 640. Contrary to the Seventh Circuit’s\n  reasoning, even if both types of claims take aim at prohibited dis\n  crimination, it does not follow that their reach is coextensive. Pp. 7–\n  10.\n    (c) The City and its amici warn that this reading will result in a\n  host of practical problems for employers and employees alike. The\n  Court, however, must give effect to the law Congress enacted, not as\n  sess the consequences of each approach and adopt the one that pro\n  duces the least mischief. Pp. 10–11.\n    (d) It is left to the Seventh Circuit to determine whether the judg\n  ment must be modified to the extent that the District Court awarded\n  relief based on the first round of hiring, which occurred outside the\n  charging period even for the earliest EEOC charge.

LEWIS, JR., ET AL., PETITIONERS v. CITY\n             OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n                                 [May 24, 2010]\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits em\nployers from using employment practices that cause a\ndisparate impact on the basis of race (among other bases).\n42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i). It also requires plaintiffs,\nbefore beginning a federal lawsuit, to file a timely charge\nof discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportu\nnity Commission (EEOC). §2000e–5(e)(1). We consider\nwhether a plaintiff who does not file a timely charge chal\nlenging the adoption of a practice—here, an employer’s\ndecision to exclude employment applicants who did not\nachieve a certain score on an examination—may assert a\ndisparate-impact claim in a timely charge challenging the\nemployer’s later application of that practice.\n                              I\n   In July 1995, the City of Chicago administered a written\nexamination to over 26,000 applicants seeking to serve in\nthe Chicago Fire Department. After scoring the examina\ntions, the City reported the results. It announced in a\nJanuary 26, 1996, press release that it would begin draw\ning randomly from the top tier of scorers, i.e., those who\n2                       LEWIS v. CHICAGO\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nscored 89 or above (out of 100), whom the City called “well\nqualified.” Those drawn from this group would proceed to\nthe next phase—a physical-abilities test, background\ncheck, medical examination, and drug test—and if they\ncleared those hurdles would be hired as candidate fire\nfighters. Those who scored below 65, on the other hand,\nlearned by letters sent the same day that they had failed\nthe test. Each was told he had not achieved a passing\nscore, would no longer be considered for a firefighter\nposition, and would not be contacted again about the\nexamination.\n   The applicants in-between—those who scored between\n65 and 88, whom the City called “qualified”1—were noti\nfied that they had passed the examination but that, based\non the City’s projected hiring needs and the number of\n“well-qualified” applicants, it was not likely they would be\ncalled for further processing. The individual notices\nadded, however, that because it was not possible to predict\nhow many applicants would be hired in the next few years,\neach “qualified” applicant’s name would be kept on the\neligibility list maintained by the Department of Personnel\nfor as long as that list was used. Eleven days later, the\nCity officially adopted an “Eligible List” reflecting the\nbreakdown described above.\n   On May 16, 1996, the City selected its first class of\napplicants to advance to the next stage. It selected a\nsecond on October 1, 1996, and repeated the process nine\nmore times over the next six years. As it had announced,\nin each round the City drew randomly from among those\nwho scored in the “well-qualified” range on the 1995 test.\nIn the last round it exhausted that pool, so it filled the\n\n——————\n    1 Certain\n            paramedics who scored between 65 and 88 were deemed\n“well qualified” pursuant to a collective-bargaining agreement, and\ncertain veterans in the “qualified” range had 5 points added to their\nscores and therefore became “well qualified.”\n                    Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                  3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nremaining slots with “qualified” candidates instead.\n   On March 31, 1997, Crawford M. Smith, an African-\nAmerican applicant who scored in the “qualified” range\nand had not been hired as a candidate firefighter, filed a\ncharge of discrimination with the EEOC. Five others\nfollowed suit, and on July 28, 1998, the EEOC issued all\nsix of them right-to-sue letters. Two months later, they\nfiled this civil action against the City, alleging (as relevant\nhere) that its practice of selecting for advancement only\napplicants who scored 89 or above caused a disparate\nimpact on African-Americans in violation of Title VII. The\nDistrict Court certified a class—petitioners here—\nconsisting of the more than 6,000 African-Americans who\nscored in the “qualified” range on the 1995 examination\nbut had not been hired.2\n   The City sought summary judgment on the ground that\npetitioners had failed to file EEOC charges within 300\ndays after their claims accrued. See §2000e–5(e)(1). The\nDistrict Court denied the motion, concluding that the\nCity’s “ongoing reliance” on the 1995 test results consti\ntuted a “continuing violation” of Title VII. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 45a. The City stipulated that the 89-point cutoff had\na “severe disparate impact against African Americans,”\nFinal Pretrial Order, Record, Doc. 223, Schedule A, p. 2,\nbut argued that its cutoff score was justified by business\nnecessity. After an 8-day bench trial, the District Court\nruled for petitioners, rejecting the City’s business\nnecessity defense. It ordered the City to hire 132 ran\ndomly selected members of the class (reflecting the num\nber of African-Americans the Court found would have been\nhired but for the City’s practices) and awarded backpay to\nbe divided among the remaining class members.\n   The Seventh Circuit reversed. 528 F. 3d 488 (2008). It\n——————\n  2 In addition to the class members, the African American Fire Fight\n\ners League of Chicago, Inc., also joined the suit as a plaintiff.\n4                        LEWIS v. CHICAGO\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nheld that petitioners’ suit was untimely because the earli\nest EEOC charge was filed more than 300 days after the\nonly discriminatory act: sorting the scores into the “well\nqualified,” “qualified,” and “not-qualified” categories. The\nhiring decisions down the line were immaterial, it rea\nsoned, because “[t]he hiring only of applicants classified\n‘well qualified’ was the automatic consequence of the test\nscores rather than the product of a fresh act of discrimina\ntion.” Id., at 491. We granted certiorari. 557 U. S. __\n(2009).\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n   Before beginning a Title VII suit, a plaintiff must first\nfile a timely EEOC charge. In this case, petitioners’\ncharges were due within 300 days “after the alleged\nunlawful employment practice occurred.” §2000e–5(e)(1).3\nDetermining whether a plaintiff’s charge is timely thus\nrequires “identify[ing] precisely the ‘unlawful employment\npractice’ of which he complains.” Delaware State College\nv. Ricks, 449 U. S. 250, 257 (1980). Petitioners here chal\nlenge the City’s practice of picking only those who had\nscored 89 or above on the 1995 examination when it later\nchose applicants to advance. Setting aside the first round\nof selection in May 1996, which all agree is beyond the cut\noff, no one disputes that the conduct petitioners challenge\noccurred within the charging period.4 The real question,\n——————\n   3 All agree that a 300-day deadline applies to petitioners’ charges\n\npursuant to 29 CFR §§1601.13(a)(4), (b)(1), 1601.80 (2009). Cf. EEOC\nv. Commercial Office Products Co., 486 U. S. 107, 112, 114–122 (1988).\n   4 Because the District Court certified petitioners as a class, and be\n\ncause a court may award class-wide relief even to unnamed class\nmembers who have not filed EEOC charges, see Franks v. Bowman\nTransp. Co., 424 U. S. 747, 771 (1976), petitioners assert and the City\ndoes not dispute that the date of the earliest EEOC charge filed by a\nnamed plaintiff—that filed by Smith on March 31, 1997—controls the\ntimeliness of the class’s claims. We assume without deciding that this\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthen, is not whether a claim predicated on that conduct is\ntimely, but whether the practice thus defined can be the\nbasis for a disparate-impact claim at all.\n  We conclude that it can. As originally enacted, Title VII\ndid not expressly prohibit employment practices that\ncause a disparate impact. That enactment made it an\n“unlawful employment practice” for an employer “to fail or\nrefuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise\nto discriminate against any individual with respect to his\ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employ\nment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex,\nor national origin,” §2000e–2(a)(1), or “to limit, segregate,\nor classify his employees or applicants for employment in\nany way which would deprive or tend to deprive any indi\nvidual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely\naffect his status as an employee, because of” any of the\nsame reasons, §2000e–2(a)(2). In Griggs v. Duke Power\nCo., 401 U. S. 424, 431 (1971), we interpreted the latter\nprovision to “proscrib[e] not only overt discrimination but\nalso practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in\noperation.”\n  Two decades later, Congress codified the requirements\nof the “disparate impact” claims Griggs had recognized.\nPub. L. 102–166, §105, 105 Stat. 1074, 42 U. S. C. §2000e–\n2(k). That provision states:\n     “(1)(A) An unlawful employment practice based on dis\n     parate impact is established under this subchapter\n     only if—\n       “(i) a complaining party demonstrates that a re\n       spondent uses a particular employment practice\n       that causes a disparate impact on the basis of race,\n       color, religion, sex, or national origin and the re\n       spondent fails to demonstrate that the challenged\n       practice is job related for the position in question\n——————\nis correct.\n6                    LEWIS v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n      and consistent with business necessity . . . .”\nThus, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie disparate\nimpact claim by showing that the employer “uses a par\nticular employment practice that causes a disparate im\npact” on one of the prohibited bases. Ibid. (emphasis\nadded). See Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(slip op., at 18).\n   Petitioners’ claim satisfies that requirement. Title VII\ndoes not define “employment practice,” but we think it\nclear that the term encompasses the conduct of which\npetitioners complain: the exclusion of passing applicants\nwho scored below 89 (until the supply of scores 89 or above\nwas exhausted) when selecting those who would advance.\nThe City “use[d]” that practice in each round of selection.\nAlthough the City had adopted the eligibility list (embody\ning the score cutoffs) earlier and announced its intention\nto draw from that list, it made use of the practice of ex\ncluding those who scored 88 or below each time it filled a\nnew class of firefighters. Petitioners alleged that this\nexclusion caused a disparate impact. Whether they ade\nquately proved that is not before us. What matters is that\ntheir allegations, based on the City’s actual implementa\ntion of its policy, stated a cognizable claim.\n   The City argues that subsection (k) is inapposite be\ncause it does not address “accrual” of disparate-impact\nclaims. Section 2000e–5(e)(1), it says, specifies when the\ntime to file a charge starts running. That is true but\nirrelevant. Aside from the first round of selection in May\n1996 (which all agree is beyond the 300-day charging\nperiod), the acts petitioners challenge—the City’s use of its\ncutoff score in selecting candidates—occurred within the\ncharging period. Accordingly, no one disputes that if\npetitioners could bring new claims based on those acts,\ntheir claims were timely. The issue, in other words, is not\nwhen petitioners’ claims accrued, but whether they could\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\naccrue at all.\n   The City responds that subsection (k) does not answer\nthat question either; that it speaks, as its title indicates,\nonly to the plaintiff’s “[b]urden of proof in disparate im\npact cases,” not to the elements of disparate-impact\nclaims, which the City says are be found in §2000e–2(a)(2).\nThat is incorrect. Subsection (k) does indeed address the\nburden of proof—not just who bears it, however, but also\nwhat it consists of. It does set forth the essential ingredi\nents of a disparate-impact claim: It says that a claim “is\nestablished” if an employer “uses” an “employment prac\ntice” that “causes a disparate impact” on one of the enu\nmerated bases. §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i). That it also sets\nforth a business-necessity defense employers may raise,\n§2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i), and explains how plaintiffs may\nprevail despite that defense, §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(ii), is ir\nrelevant. Unless and until the defendant pleads and\nproves a business-necessity defense, the plaintiff wins\nsimply by showing the stated elements.\n                               B\n   Notwithstanding the text of §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i) and\npetitioners’ description of the practice they claim was\nunlawful, the City argues that the unlawful employment\npractice here was something else entirely. The only ac\ntionable discrimination, it argues, occurred in 1996 when\nit “used the examination results to create the hiring eligi\nbility list, limited hiring to the ‘well qualified’ classifica\ntion, and notified petitioners.” Brief for Respondent 23.\nThat initial decision, it concedes, was unlawful. But be\ncause no timely charge challenged the decision, that can\nnot now be the basis for liability. And because, the City\nclaims, the exclusion of petitioners when selecting classes\nof firefighters followed inevitably from the earlier decision\nto adopt the cutoff score, no new violations could have\noccurred. The Seventh Circuit adopted the same analysis.\n8                    LEWIS v. CHICAGO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nSee 528 F. 3d, at 490–491.\n   The City’s premise is sound, but its conclusion does not\nfollow. It may be true that the City’s January 1996 deci\nsion to adopt the cutoff score (and to create a list of the\napplicants above it) gave rise to a freestanding disparate\nimpact claim. Cf. Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U. S. 440, 445–\n451 (1982). If that is so, the City is correct that since no\ntimely charge was filed attacking it, the City is now “enti\ntled to treat that past act as lawful.” United Air Lines,\nInc. v. Evans, 431 U. S. 553, 558 (1977). But it does not\nfollow that no new violation occurred—and no new claims\ncould arise—when the City implemented that decision\ndown the road. If petitioners could prove that the City\n“use[d]” the “practice” that “causes a disparate impact,”\nthey could prevail.\n   The City, like the Seventh Circuit, see 528 F. 3d, at\n490–491, insists that Evans and a line of cases following it\nrequire a different result. See also Ledbetter v. Goodyear\nTire & Rubber Co., 550 U. S. 618 (2007); Lorance v. AT&T\nTechnologies, Inc., 490 U. S. 900 (1989); Ricks, 449 U. S.\n250. Those cases, we are told, stand for the proposition\nthat present effects of prior actions cannot lead to Title VII\nliability.\n   We disagree. As relevant here, those cases establish\nonly that a Title VII plaintiff must show a “present viola\ntion” within the limitations period. Evans, supra, at 558\n(emphasis deleted). What that requires depends on the\nclaim asserted.     For disparate-treatment claims—and\nothers for which discriminatory intent is required—that\nmeans the plaintiff must demonstrate deliberate discrimi\nnation within the limitations period. See Ledbetter, supra,\nat 624–629; Lorance, supra, at 904–905; Ricks, supra, at\n256–258; Evans, supra, at 557–560; see also Chardon v.\nFernandez, 454 U. S. 6, 8 (1981) (per curiam). But for\nclaims that do not require discriminatory intent, no such\ndemonstration is needed. Cf. Ledbetter, supra, at 640;\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

Our opinions, it is true,\ndescribed the harms of which the unsuccessful plaintiffs in\nthose cases complained as “present effect[s]” of past dis\ncrimination. Ledbetter, supra, at 628; see also Lorance,\nsupra, at 907; Chardon, supra, at 8; Ricks, supra, at 258;\nEvans, supra, at 558. But the reason they could not be the\npresent effects of present discrimination was that the\ncharged discrimination required proof of discriminatory\nintent, which had not even been alleged. That reasoning\nhas no application when, as here, the charge is disparate\nimpact, which does not require discriminatory intent.\n   The Seventh Circuit resisted this conclusion, reasoning\nthat the difference between disparate-treatment and\ndisparate-impact claims is only superficial. Both take aim\nat the same evil—discrimination on a prohibited basis—\nbut simply seek to establish it by different means. 528\nF. 3d, at 491–492. Disparate-impact liability, the Court of\nAppeals explained, “ ‘is primarily intended to lighten the\nplaintiff’s heavy burden of proving intentional discrimina\ntion after employers learned to cover their tracks.’ ” Id., at\n492 (quoting Finnegan v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 967\nF. 2d 1161, 1164 (CA7 1992)). But even if the two theories\nwere directed at the same evil, it would not follow that\ntheir reach is therefore coextensive. If the effect of apply\ning Title VII’s text is that some claims that would be\ndoomed under one theory will survive under the other,\nthat is the product of the law Congress has written. It is\nnot for us to rewrite the statute so that it covers only what\nwe think is necessary to achieve what we think Congress\nreally intended. See Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Ser\nvices, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 79–80 (1998).\n   The City also argues that, even if petitioners could have\nproved a present disparate-impact violation, they never\ndid so under the proper test. The parties litigated the\nmerits—and the City stipulated that the cutoff score\ncaused disparate impact—after the District Court adopted\n10                   LEWIS v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npetitioners’ “continuing violation” theory. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 45a. That theory, which petitioners have since\nabandoned, treated the adoption and application of the\ncutoff score as a single, ongoing wrong. As a result, the\nCity says, “petitioners never proved, or even attempted to\nprove, that use of the [eligibility] list had disparate im\npact,” Brief for Respondent 32 (emphasis added), since the\ntheory they advanced did not require them to do so. If the\nCourt of Appeals determines that the argument has been\npreserved it may be available on remand. But it has no\nbearing here. The only question presented to us is\nwhether the claim petitioners brought is cognizable.\nBecause we conclude that it is, our inquiry is at an end.\n                              C\n  The City and its amici warn that our reading will result\nin a host of practical problems for employers and employ\nees alike. Employers may face new disparate-impact suits\nfor practices they have used regularly for years. Evidence\nessential to their business-necessity defenses might be\nunavailable (or in the case of witnesses’ memories, unreli\nable) by the time the later suits are brought. And affected\nemployees and prospective employees may not even know\nthey have claims if they are unaware the employer is still\napplying the disputed practice.\n  Truth to tell, however, both readings of the statute\nproduce puzzling results. Under the City’s reading, if an\nemployer adopts an unlawful practice and no timely\ncharge is brought, it can continue using the practice in\ndefinitely, with impunity, despite ongoing disparate im\npact. Equitable tolling or estoppel may allow some af\nfected employees or applicants to sue, but many others\nwill be left out in the cold. Moreover, the City’s reading\nmay induce plaintiffs aware of the danger of delay to file\ncharges upon the announcement of a hiring practice,\nbefore they have any basis for believing it will produce a\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndisparate impact.\n  In all events, it is not our task to assess the conse\nquences of each approach and adopt the one that produces\nthe least mischief. Our charge is to give effect to the law\nCongress enacted. By enacting §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i), Con\ngress allowed claims to be brought against an employer\nwho uses a practice that causes disparate impact, what\never the employer’s motives and whether or not he has\nemployed the same practice in the past. If that effect was\nunintended, it is a problem for Congress, not one that\nfederal courts can fix.\n                            III\n   The City asserts that one aspect of the District Court’s\njudgment still must be changed. The first round of hiring\nfirefighters occurred outside the charging period even for\nthe earliest EEOC charge. Yet the District Court, apply\ning the continuing-violation theory, awarded relief based\non those acts. Petitioners do not disagree, and they do not\noppose the City’s request for a remand to resolve this\nissue. We therefore leave it to the Seventh Circuit to\ndetermine, to the extent that point was properly pre\nserved, whether the judgment must be modified in light of\nour decision.\n                     *    *     *\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                        It is so ordered.\n</pre>", "id": 146985, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2010/05/24/Lewis_v._Chicago.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2009                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

CITY OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 08–974.      Argued February 22, 2010—Decided May 24, 2010\nIn 1995, respondent the City of Chicago gave a written examination to\n  applicants seeking firefighter positions. In January 1996, the City\n  announced it would draw candidates randomly from a list of appli\n  cants who scored at least 89 out of 100 points on the examination,\n  whom it designated as “well qualified.” It informed those who scored\n  below 65 that they had failed and would not be considered further. It\n  informed applicants who scored between 65 and 88, whom it desig\n  nated as “qualified,” that it was unlikely they would be called for fur\n  ther processing but that the City would keep them on the eligibility\n  list for as long as that list was used. That May, the City selected its\n  first class of applicants to advance, and it repeated this process mul\n  tiple times over the next six years. Beginning in March 1997, several\n  African-American applicants who scored in the “qualified” range but\n  had not been hired filed discrimination charges with the Equal Em\n  ployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and received right-to-sue\n  letters. They then filed suit, alleging (as relevant here) that the\n  City’s practice of selecting only applicants who scored 89 or above\n  had a disparate impact on African-Americans in violation of Title VII\n  of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, see 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i).\n  The District Court certified a class—petitioners here—of African-\n  Americans who scored in the “qualified” range but were not hired.\n  The court denied the City’s summary judgment motion, rejecting its\n  claim that petitioners had failed to file EEOC charges within 300\n  days “after the unlawful employment practice occurred,” §2000e–\n  5(e)(1), and finding instead that the City’s “ongoing reliance” on the\n  1995 test results constituted a continuing Title VII violation. The\n  litigation then proceeded, and petitioners prevailed on the merits.\n  The Seventh Circuit reversed the judgment in their favor, holding\n2                          LEWIS v. CHICAGO\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    that the suit was untimely because the earliest EEOC charge was\n    filed more than 300 days after the only discriminatory act—sorting\n    the scores into the “well qualified,” “qualified,” and “not qualified”\n    categories. The later hiring decisions, the Seventh Circuit held, were\n    an automatic consequence of the test scores, not new discriminatory\n    acts.\nHeld: A plaintiff who does not file a timely charge challenging the adop\n tion of a practice may assert a disparate-impact claim in a timely\n charge challenging the employer’s later application of that practice as\n long as he alleges each of the elements of a disparate-impact claim.\n Pp. 4–11.\n    (a) Determining whether petitioners’ charges were timely requires\n “identify[ing] precisely the ‘unlawful employment practice’ of which”\n they complain. Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U. S. 250, 257.\n With the exception of the first selection round, all agree that the chal\n lenged practice here—the City’s selection of firefighter hires on the\n basis announced in 1996—occurred within the charging period.\n Thus, the question is not whether a claim predicated on that conduct\n is timely, but whether the practice thus defined can be the basis for a\n disparate-impact claim at all. It can. A Title VII plaintiff establishes\n a prima facie claim by showing that the employer “uses a particular\n employment practice that causes a disparate impact” on one of the\n prohibited bases. §2000e–2(k). The term “employment practice”\n clearly encompasses the conduct at issue: exclusion of passing appli\n cants who scored below 89 when selecting those who would advance.\n The City “use[d]” that practice each time it filled a new class of fire\n fighters, and petitioners allege that doing so caused a disparate im\n pact. It is irrelevant that subsection (k) does not address “accrual” of\n disparate-impact claims, since the issue here is not when the claims\n accrued but whether the claims stated a violation. They did.\n Whether petitioners proved a violation is not before the Court.\n Pp. 4–7.\n    (b) The City argues that the only actionable discrimination oc\n curred in 1996 when it used the test results to create the hiring list,\n which it concedes was unlawful. It may be true that the City’s adop\n tion in 1996 of the cutoff score gave rise to a freestanding disparate\n impact claim. If so, because no timely charge was filed, the City is\n now “entitled to treat that past act as lawful,” United Air Lines, Inc.\n v. Evans, 431 U. S. 553, 558. But it does not follow that no new viola\n tion occurred—and no new claims could arise—when the City later\n implemented the 1996 decision. Evans and later cases the City cites\n establish only that a Title VII plaintiff must show a “present viola\n tion” within the limitations period. For disparate-treatment claims—\n which require discriminatory intent—the plaintiff must demonstrate\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  deliberate discrimination within the limitations period. But no such\n  demonstration is needed for claims, such as this one, that do not re\n  quire discriminatory intent. Cf., e.g., Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &\n  Rubber Co., 550 U. S. 618, 640. Contrary to the Seventh Circuit’s\n  reasoning, even if both types of claims take aim at prohibited dis\n  crimination, it does not follow that their reach is coextensive. Pp. 7–\n  10.\n    (c) The City and its amici warn that this reading will result in a\n  host of practical problems for employers and employees alike. The\n  Court, however, must give effect to the law Congress enacted, not as\n  sess the consequences of each approach and adopt the one that pro\n  duces the least mischief. Pp. 10–11.\n    (d) It is left to the Seventh Circuit to determine whether the judg\n  ment must be modified to the extent that the District Court awarded\n  relief based on the first round of hiring, which occurred outside the\n  charging period even for the earliest EEOC charge.

LEWIS, JR., ET AL., PETITIONERS v. CITY\n             OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n                                 [May 24, 2010]\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits em\nployers from using employment practices that cause a\ndisparate impact on the basis of race (among other bases).\n42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i). It also requires plaintiffs,\nbefore beginning a federal lawsuit, to file a timely charge\nof discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportu\nnity Commission (EEOC). §2000e–5(e)(1). We consider\nwhether a plaintiff who does not file a timely charge chal\nlenging the adoption of a practice—here, an employer’s\ndecision to exclude employment applicants who did not\nachieve a certain score on an examination—may assert a\ndisparate-impact claim in a timely charge challenging the\nemployer’s later application of that practice.\n                              I\n   In July 1995, the City of Chicago administered a written\nexamination to over 26,000 applicants seeking to serve in\nthe Chicago Fire Department. After scoring the examina\ntions, the City reported the results. It announced in a\nJanuary 26, 1996, press release that it would begin draw\ning randomly from the top tier of scorers, i.e., those who\n2                       LEWIS v. CHICAGO\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nscored 89 or above (out of 100), whom the City called “well\nqualified.” Those drawn from this group would proceed to\nthe next phase—a physical-abilities test, background\ncheck, medical examination, and drug test—and if they\ncleared those hurdles would be hired as candidate fire\nfighters. Those who scored below 65, on the other hand,\nlearned by letters sent the same day that they had failed\nthe test. Each was told he had not achieved a passing\nscore, would no longer be considered for a firefighter\nposition, and would not be contacted again about the\nexamination.\n   The applicants in-between—those who scored between\n65 and 88, whom the City called “qualified”1—were noti\nfied that they had passed the examination but that, based\non the City’s projected hiring needs and the number of\n“well-qualified” applicants, it was not likely they would be\ncalled for further processing. The individual notices\nadded, however, that because it was not possible to predict\nhow many applicants would be hired in the next few years,\neach “qualified” applicant’s name would be kept on the\neligibility list maintained by the Department of Personnel\nfor as long as that list was used. Eleven days later, the\nCity officially adopted an “Eligible List” reflecting the\nbreakdown described above.\n   On May 16, 1996, the City selected its first class of\napplicants to advance to the next stage. It selected a\nsecond on October 1, 1996, and repeated the process nine\nmore times over the next six years. As it had announced,\nin each round the City drew randomly from among those\nwho scored in the “well-qualified” range on the 1995 test.\nIn the last round it exhausted that pool, so it filled the\n\n——————\n    1 Certain\n            paramedics who scored between 65 and 88 were deemed\n“well qualified” pursuant to a collective-bargaining agreement, and\ncertain veterans in the “qualified” range had 5 points added to their\nscores and therefore became “well qualified.”\n                    Cite as: 560 U.

Smith, an African-\nAmerican applicant who scored in the “qualified” range\nand had not been hired as a candidate firefighter, filed a\ncharge of discrimination with the EEOC. Five others\nfollowed suit, and on July 28, 1998, the EEOC issued all\nsix of them right-to-sue letters. Two months later, they\nfiled this civil action against the City, alleging (as relevant\nhere) that its practice of selecting for advancement only\napplicants who scored 89 or above caused a disparate\nimpact on African-Americans in violation of Title VII. The\nDistrict Court certified a class—petitioners here—\nconsisting of the more than 6,000 African-Americans who\nscored in the “qualified” range on the 1995 examination\nbut had not been hired.2\n   The City sought summary judgment on the ground that\npetitioners had failed to file EEOC charges within 300\ndays after their claims accrued. See §2000e–5(e)(1). The\nDistrict Court denied the motion, concluding that the\nCity’s “ongoing reliance” on the 1995 test results consti\ntuted a “continuing violation” of Title VII. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 45a. The City stipulated that the 89-point cutoff had\na “severe disparate impact against African Americans,”\nFinal Pretrial Order, Record, Doc. 223, Schedule A, p. 2,\nbut argued that its cutoff score was justified by business\nnecessity. After an 8-day bench trial, the District Court\nruled for petitioners, rejecting the City’s business\nnecessity defense. It ordered the City to hire 132 ran\ndomly selected members of the class (reflecting the num\nber of African-Americans the Court found would have been\nhired but for the City’s practices) and awarded backpay to\nbe divided among the remaining class members.\n   The Seventh Circuit reversed. 528 F. 3d 488 (2008). It\n——————\n  2 In addition to the class members, the African American Fire Fight\n\ners League of Chicago, Inc., also joined the suit as a plaintiff.\n4                        LEWIS v. CHICAGO\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nheld that petitioners’ suit was untimely because the earli\nest EEOC charge was filed more than 300 days after the\nonly discriminatory act: sorting the scores into the “well\nqualified,” “qualified,” and “not-qualified” categories. The\nhiring decisions down the line were immaterial, it rea\nsoned, because “[t]he hiring only of applicants classified\n‘well qualified’ was the automatic consequence of the test\nscores rather than the product of a fresh act of discrimina\ntion.” Id., at 491. We granted certiorari. 557 U. S. __\n(2009).\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n   Before beginning a Title VII suit, a plaintiff must first\nfile a timely EEOC charge. In this case, petitioners’\ncharges were due within 300 days “after the alleged\nunlawful employment practice occurred.” §2000e–5(e)(1).3\nDetermining whether a plaintiff’s charge is timely thus\nrequires “identify[ing] precisely the ‘unlawful employment\npractice’ of which he complains.” Delaware State College\nv. Ricks, 449 U. S. 250, 257 (1980). Petitioners here chal\nlenge the City’s practice of picking only those who had\nscored 89 or above on the 1995 examination when it later\nchose applicants to advance. Setting aside the first round\nof selection in May 1996, which all agree is beyond the cut\noff, no one disputes that the conduct petitioners challenge\noccurred within the charging period.4 The real question,\n——————\n   3 All agree that a 300-day deadline applies to petitioners’ charges\n\npursuant to 29 CFR §§1601.13(a)(4), (b)(1), 1601.80 (2009). Cf. EEOC\nv. Commercial Office Products Co., 486 U. S. 107, 112, 114–122 (1988).\n   4 Because the District Court certified petitioners as a class, and be\n\ncause a court may award class-wide relief even to unnamed class\nmembers who have not filed EEOC charges, see Franks v. Bowman\nTransp. Co., 424 U. S. 747, 771 (1976), petitioners assert and the City\ndoes not dispute that the date of the earliest EEOC charge filed by a\nnamed plaintiff—that filed by Smith on March 31, 1997—controls the\ntimeliness of the class’s claims. We assume without deciding that this\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthen, is not whether a claim predicated on that conduct is\ntimely, but whether the practice thus defined can be the\nbasis for a disparate-impact claim at all.\n  We conclude that it can. As originally enacted, Title VII\ndid not expressly prohibit employment practices that\ncause a disparate impact. That enactment made it an\n“unlawful employment practice” for an employer “to fail or\nrefuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise\nto discriminate against any individual with respect to his\ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employ\nment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex,\nor national origin,” §2000e–2(a)(1), or “to limit, segregate,\nor classify his employees or applicants for employment in\nany way which would deprive or tend to deprive any indi\nvidual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely\naffect his status as an employee, because of” any of the\nsame reasons, §2000e–2(a)(2). In Griggs v. Duke Power\nCo., 401 U. S. 424, 431 (1971), we interpreted the latter\nprovision to “proscrib[e] not only overt discrimination but\nalso practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in\noperation.”\n  Two decades later, Congress codified the requirements\nof the “disparate impact” claims Griggs had recognized.\nPub. L. 102–166, §105, 105 Stat. 1074, 42 U. S. C. §2000e–\n2(k). That provision states:\n     “(1)(A) An unlawful employment practice based on dis\n     parate impact is established under this subchapter\n     only if—\n       “(i) a complaining party demonstrates that a re\n       spondent uses a particular employment practice\n       that causes a disparate impact on the basis of race,\n       color, religion, sex, or national origin and the re\n       spondent fails to demonstrate that the challenged\n       practice is job related for the position in question\n——————\nis correct.\n6                    LEWIS v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n      and consistent with business necessity . . . .”\nThus, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie disparate\nimpact claim by showing that the employer “uses a par\nticular employment practice that causes a disparate im\npact” on one of the prohibited bases. Ibid. (emphasis\nadded). See Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(slip op., at 18).\n   Petitioners’ claim satisfies that requirement. Title VII\ndoes not define “employment practice,” but we think it\nclear that the term encompasses the conduct of which\npetitioners complain: the exclusion of passing applicants\nwho scored below 89 (until the supply of scores 89 or above\nwas exhausted) when selecting those who would advance.\nThe City “use[d]” that practice in each round of selection.\nAlthough the City had adopted the eligibility list (embody\ning the score cutoffs) earlier and announced its intention\nto draw from that list, it made use of the practice of ex\ncluding those who scored 88 or below each time it filled a\nnew class of firefighters. Petitioners alleged that this\nexclusion caused a disparate impact. Whether they ade\nquately proved that is not before us. What matters is that\ntheir allegations, based on the City’s actual implementa\ntion of its policy, stated a cognizable claim.\n   The City argues that subsection (k) is inapposite be\ncause it does not address “accrual” of disparate-impact\nclaims. Section 2000e–5(e)(1), it says, specifies when the\ntime to file a charge starts running. That is true but\nirrelevant. Aside from the first round of selection in May\n1996 (which all agree is beyond the 300-day charging\nperiod), the acts petitioners challenge—the City’s use of its\ncutoff score in selecting candidates—occurred within the\ncharging period. Accordingly, no one disputes that if\npetitioners could bring new claims based on those acts,\ntheir claims were timely. The issue, in other words, is not\nwhen petitioners’ claims accrued, but whether they could\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\naccrue at all.\n   The City responds that subsection (k) does not answer\nthat question either; that it speaks, as its title indicates,\nonly to the plaintiff’s “[b]urden of proof in disparate im\npact cases,” not to the elements of disparate-impact\nclaims, which the City says are be found in §2000e–2(a)(2).\nThat is incorrect. Subsection (k) does indeed address the\nburden of proof—not just who bears it, however, but also\nwhat it consists of. It does set forth the essential ingredi\nents of a disparate-impact claim: It says that a claim “is\nestablished” if an employer “uses” an “employment prac\ntice” that “causes a disparate impact” on one of the enu\nmerated bases. §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i). That it also sets\nforth a business-necessity defense employers may raise,\n§2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i), and explains how plaintiffs may\nprevail despite that defense, §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(ii), is ir\nrelevant. Unless and until the defendant pleads and\nproves a business-necessity defense, the plaintiff wins\nsimply by showing the stated elements.\n                               B\n   Notwithstanding the text of §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i) and\npetitioners’ description of the practice they claim was\nunlawful, the City argues that the unlawful employment\npractice here was something else entirely. The only ac\ntionable discrimination, it argues, occurred in 1996 when\nit “used the examination results to create the hiring eligi\nbility list, limited hiring to the ‘well qualified’ classifica\ntion, and notified petitioners.” Brief for Respondent 23.\nThat initial decision, it concedes, was unlawful. But be\ncause no timely charge challenged the decision, that can\nnot now be the basis for liability. And because, the City\nclaims, the exclusion of petitioners when selecting classes\nof firefighters followed inevitably from the earlier decision\nto adopt the cutoff score, no new violations could have\noccurred. The Seventh Circuit adopted the same analysis.\n8                    LEWIS v. CHICAGO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nSee 528 F. 3d, at 490–491.\n   The City’s premise is sound, but its conclusion does not\nfollow. It may be true that the City’s January 1996 deci\nsion to adopt the cutoff score (and to create a list of the\napplicants above it) gave rise to a freestanding disparate\nimpact claim. Cf. Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U. S. 440, 445–\n451 (1982). If that is so, the City is correct that since no\ntimely charge was filed attacking it, the City is now “enti\ntled to treat that past act as lawful.” United Air Lines,\nInc. v. Evans, 431 U. S. 553, 558 (1977). But it does not\nfollow that no new violation occurred—and no new claims\ncould arise—when the City implemented that decision\ndown the road. If petitioners could prove that the City\n“use[d]” the “practice” that “causes a disparate impact,”\nthey could prevail.\n   The City, like the Seventh Circuit, see 528 F. 3d, at\n490–491, insists that Evans and a line of cases following it\nrequire a different result. See also Ledbetter v. Goodyear\nTire & Rubber Co., 550 U. S. 618 (2007); Lorance v. AT&T\nTechnologies, Inc., 490 U. S. 900 (1989); Ricks, 449 U. S.\n250. Those cases, we are told, stand for the proposition\nthat present effects of prior actions cannot lead to Title VII\nliability.\n   We disagree. As relevant here, those cases establish\nonly that a Title VII plaintiff must show a “present viola\ntion” within the limitations period. Evans, supra, at 558\n(emphasis deleted). What that requires depends on the\nclaim asserted.     For disparate-treatment claims—and\nothers for which discriminatory intent is required—that\nmeans the plaintiff must demonstrate deliberate discrimi\nnation within the limitations period. See Ledbetter, supra,\nat 624–629; Lorance, supra, at 904–905; Ricks, supra, at\n256–258; Evans, supra, at 557–560; see also Chardon v.\nFernandez, 454 U. S. 6, 8 (1981) (per curiam). But for\nclaims that do not require discriminatory intent, no such\ndemonstration is needed. Cf. Ledbetter, supra, at 640;\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nLorance, supra, at 904, 908–909. Our opinions, it is true,\ndescribed the harms of which the unsuccessful plaintiffs in\nthose cases complained as “present effect[s]” of past dis\ncrimination. Ledbetter, supra, at 628; see also Lorance,\nsupra, at 907; Chardon, supra, at 8; Ricks, supra, at 258;\nEvans, supra, at 558. But the reason they could not be the\npresent effects of present discrimination was that the\ncharged discrimination required proof of discriminatory\nintent, which had not even been alleged. That reasoning\nhas no application when, as here, the charge is disparate\nimpact, which does not require discriminatory intent.\n   The Seventh Circuit resisted this conclusion, reasoning\nthat the difference between disparate-treatment and\ndisparate-impact claims is only superficial. Both take aim\nat the same evil—discrimination on a prohibited basis—\nbut simply seek to establish it by different means. 528\nF. 3d, at 491–492. Disparate-impact liability, the Court of\nAppeals explained, “ ‘is primarily intended to lighten the\nplaintiff’s heavy burden of proving intentional discrimina\ntion after employers learned to cover their tracks.’ ” Id., at\n492 (quoting Finnegan v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 967\nF. 2d 1161, 1164 (CA7 1992)). But even if the two theories\nwere directed at the same evil, it would not follow that\ntheir reach is therefore coextensive. If the effect of apply\ning Title VII’s text is that some claims that would be\ndoomed under one theory will survive under the other,\nthat is the product of the law Congress has written. It is\nnot for us to rewrite the statute so that it covers only what\nwe think is necessary to achieve what we think Congress\nreally intended. See Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Ser\nvices, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 79–80 (1998).\n   The City also argues that, even if petitioners could have\nproved a present disparate-impact violation, they never\ndid so under the proper test. The parties litigated the\nmerits—and the City stipulated that the cutoff score\ncaused disparate impact—after the District Court adopted\n10                   LEWIS v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npetitioners’ “continuing violation” theory. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 45a. That theory, which petitioners have since\nabandoned, treated the adoption and application of the\ncutoff score as a single, ongoing wrong. As a result, the\nCity says, “petitioners never proved, or even attempted to\nprove, that use of the [eligibility] list had disparate im\npact,” Brief for Respondent 32 (emphasis added), since the\ntheory they advanced did not require them to do so. If the\nCourt of Appeals determines that the argument has been\npreserved it may be available on remand. But it has no\nbearing here. The only question presented to us is\nwhether the claim petitioners brought is cognizable.\nBecause we conclude that it is, our inquiry is at an end.\n                              C\n  The City and its amici warn that our reading will result\nin a host of practical problems for employers and employ\nees alike. Employers may face new disparate-impact suits\nfor practices they have used regularly for years. Evidence\nessential to their business-necessity defenses might be\nunavailable (or in the case of witnesses’ memories, unreli\nable) by the time the later suits are brought. And affected\nemployees and prospective employees may not even know\nthey have claims if they are unaware the employer is still\napplying the disputed practice.\n  Truth to tell, however, both readings of the statute\nproduce puzzling results. Under the City’s reading, if an\nemployer adopts an unlawful practice and no timely\ncharge is brought, it can continue using the practice in\ndefinitely, with impunity, despite ongoing disparate im\npact. Equitable tolling or estoppel may allow some af\nfected employees or applicants to sue, but many others\nwill be left out in the cold. Moreover, the City’s reading\nmay induce plaintiffs aware of the danger of delay to file\ncharges upon the announcement of a hiring practice,\nbefore they have any basis for believing it will produce a\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndisparate impact.\n  In all events, it is not our task to assess the conse\nquences of each approach and adopt the one that produces\nthe least mischief. Our charge is to give effect to the law\nCongress enacted. By enacting §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i), Con\ngress allowed claims to be brought against an employer\nwho uses a practice that causes disparate impact, what\never the employer’s motives and whether or not he has\nemployed the same practice in the past. If that effect was\nunintended, it is a problem for Congress, not one that\nfederal courts can fix.\n                            III\n   The City asserts that one aspect of the District Court’s\njudgment still must be changed. The first round of hiring\nfirefighters occurred outside the charging period even for\nthe earliest EEOC charge. Yet the District Court, apply\ning the continuing-violation theory, awarded relief based\non those acts. Petitioners do not disagree, and they do not\noppose the City’s request for a remand to resolve this\nissue. We therefore leave it to the Seventh Circuit to\ndetermine, to the extent that point was properly pre\nserved, whether the judgment must be modified in light of\nour decision.\n                     *    *     *\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                        It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/146985/", "sha1": "a5931bd56395aee92b3d4bbee378de5425ce4c7b", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2009-053", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-24T07:36:18"}
