THOMPKINS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 08–1470. Argued March 1, 2010—Decided June 1, 2010\nAfter advising respondent Thompkins of his rights, in full compliance\n  with Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, Detective Helgert and an\n  other Michigan officer interrogated him about a shooting in which\n  one victim died. At no point did Thompkins say that he wanted to\n  remain silent, that he did not want to talk with the police, or that he\n  wanted an attorney. He was largely silent during the 3-hour interro\n  gation, but near the end, he answered “yes” when asked if he prayed\n  to God to forgive him for the shooting. He moved to suppress his\n  statements, claiming that he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right\n  to remain silent, that he had not waived that right, and that his in\n  culpatory statements were involuntary. The trial court denied the\n  motion. At trial on first-degree murder and other charges, the prose\n  cution called Eric Purifoy, who drove the van in which Thompkins\n  and a third accomplice were riding at the time of the shooting, and\n  who had been convicted of firearm offenses but acquitted of murder\n  and assault. Thompkins’ defense was that Purifoy was the shooter.\n  Purifoy testified that he did not see who fired the shots. During clos\n  ing arguments, the prosecution suggested that Purifoy lied about not\n  seeing the shooter and pondered whether Purifoy’s jury had made the\n  right decision. Defense counsel did not ask the court to instruct the\n  jury that it could consider evidence of the outcome of Purifoy’s trial\n  only to assess his credibility, not to establish Thompkins’ guilt. The\n  jury found Thompkins guilty, and he was sentenced to life in prison\n  without parole. In denying his motion for a new trial, the trial court\n  rejected as nonprejudicial his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim\n  for failure to request a limiting instruction about the outcome of Puri\n  foy’s trial. On appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected both\n  Thompkins’ Miranda and his ineffective-assistance claims. The Fed\n2                      BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    eral District Court denied his subsequent habeas request, reasoning\n    that Thompkins did not invoke his right to remain silent and was not\n    coerced into making statements during the interrogation, and that it\n    was not unreasonable, for purposes of the Antiterrorism and Effective\n    Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), see 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1), for\n    the State Court of Appeals to determine that he had waived his right\n    to remain silent. The Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that the state\n    court was unreasonable in finding an implied waiver of Thompkins’\n    right to remain silent and in rejecting his ineffective-assistance-of\n    counsel claim.\nHeld:\n    1. The state court’s decision rejecting Thompkins’ Miranda claim\n was correct under de novo review and therefore necessarily reason\n able under AEDPA’s more deferential standard of review. Pp. 7–17.\n       (a) Thompkins’ silence during the interrogation did not invoke\n his right to remain silent. A suspect’s Miranda right to counsel must\n be invoked “unambiguously.” Davis v. United States, 512 U. S. 452,\n 459. If the accused makes an “ambiguous or equivocal” statement or\n no statement, the police are not required to end the interrogation,\n ibid., or ask questions to clarify the accused’s intent, id., at 461–462.\n There is no principled reason to adopt different standards for deter\n mining when an accused has invoked the Miranda right to remain si\n lent and the Miranda right to counsel at issue in Davis. Both protect\n the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination by requiring an\n interrogation to cease when either right is invoked. The unambigu\n ous invocation requirement results in an objective inquiry that\n “avoid[s] difficulties of proof and . . . provide[s] guidance to officers”\n on how to proceed in the face of ambiguity. Davis, supra, at 458–459.\n Had Thompkins said that he wanted to remain silent or that he did\n not want to talk, he would have invoked his right to end the question\n ing. He did neither. Pp. 8–10.\n       (b) Thompkins waived his right to remain silent when he know\n ingly and voluntarily made a statement to police. A waiver must be\n “the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation,\n coercion, or deception” and “made with a full awareness of both the\n nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the de\n cision to abandon it.” Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 421. Such a\n waiver may be “implied” through a “defendant’s silence, coupled with\n an understanding of his rights and a course of conduct indicating\n waiver.” North Carolina v. Butler, 441 U. S. 369, 373. If the State\n establishes that a Miranda warning was given and that it was un\n derstood by the accused, an accused’s uncoerced statement estab\n lishes an implied waiver. The record here shows that Thompkins\n waived his right to remain silent. First, the lack of any contention\n                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nthat he did not understand his rights indicates that he knew what he\ngave up when he spoke. See Burbine, supra, at 421. Second, his an\nswer to the question about God is a “course of conduct indicating\nwaiver” of that right. Butler, supra, at 373. Had he wanted to re\nmain silent, he could have said nothing in response or unambigu\nously invoked his Miranda rights, ending the interrogation. That he\nmade a statement nearly three hours after receiving a Miranda\nwarning does not overcome the fact that he engaged in a course of\nconduct indicating waiver. Third, there is no evidence that his\nstatement was coerced. See Burbine, supra, at 421. He does not\nclaim that police threatened or injured him or that he was fearful.\nThe interrogation took place in a standard-sized room in the middle\nof the day, and there is no authority for the proposition that a 3-hour\ninterrogation is inherently coercive. Cf. Colorado v. Connelly, 479\nU. S. 157, 163–164, n. 1. The fact that the question referred to reli\ngious beliefs also does not render his statement involuntary. Id., at\n170. Pp. 10–15.\n      (c) Thompkins argues that, even if his answer to Helgert could\nconstitute a waiver of his right to remain silent, the police were not\nallowed to question him until they first obtained a waiver. However,\na rule requiring a waiver at the outset would be inconsistent with\nButler’s holding that courts can infer a waiver “from the actions and\nwords of the person interrogated.” 441 U. S., at 373. Any waiver, ex\npress or implied, may be contradicted by an invocation at any time,\nterminating further interrogation. When the suspect knows that\nMiranda rights can be invoked at any time, he or she can reassess his\nor her immediate and long-term interests as the interrogation pro\ngresses. After giving a Miranda warning, police may interrogate a\nsuspect who has neither invoked nor waived Miranda rights. Thus,\nthe police were not required to obtain a waiver of Thompkins’\nMiranda rights before interrogating him. Pp. 15–17.\n   2. Even if his counsel provided ineffective assistance, Thompkins\ncannot show prejudice under a de novo review of this record. To es\ntablish ineffective assistance, a defendant “must show both deficient\nperformance and prejudice.” Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___,\n___. To establish prejudice, a “defendant must show that there is a\nreasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors,\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different,” Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U. S. 668, 694, considering “the totality of the evi\ndence before the judge or jury,” id., at 695. Here, the Sixth Circuit\ndid not account for the other evidence presented against Thompkins.\nThe state court rejected his claim that he was prejudiced by evidence\nof Purifoy’s earlier conviction. Even if it used an incorrect legal stan\ndard, this Court need not determine whether AEDPA’s deferential\n4                      BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    standard of review applies here, since Thompkins cannot show preju\n    dice under de novo review, a more favorable standard for him. De\n    novo review can be used in this case because a habeas petitioner will\n    not be entitled to relief if his or her claim is rejected on de novo re\n    view. See §2254(a). Assuming that failure to request a limiting in\n    struction here was deficient representation, Thompkins cannot show\n    prejudice, for the record shows that it was not reasonably likely that\n    such an instruction would have made any difference in light of other\n    evidence of guilt. The surviving victim identified Thompkins as the\n    shooter, and the identification was supported by a surveillance cam\n    era photograph. A friend testified that Thompkins confessed to him,\n    and the details of that confession were corroborated by evidence that\n    Thompkins stripped and abandoned the van after the shooting. The\n    jury, moreover, was capable of assessing Purifoy’s credibility, as it\n    was instructed to do.

VAN \n\n           CHESTER THOMPKINS \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 1, 2010]\n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Cir\ncuit, in a habeas corpus proceeding challenging a Michi\ngan conviction for first-degree murder and certain other\noffenses, ruled that there had been two separate constitu\ntional errors in the trial that led to the jury’s guilty ver\ndict. First, the Court of Appeals determined that a state\nment by the accused, relied on at trial by the prosecution,\nhad been elicited in violation of Miranda v. Arizona, 384\nU. S. 436 (1966). Second, it found that failure to ask for\nan instruction relating to testimony from an accomplice\nwas ineffective assistance by defense counsel. See Strick\nland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Both of these\ncontentions had been rejected in Michigan courts and in\nthe habeas corpus proceedings before the United States\nDistrict Court. Certiorari was granted to review the deci\nsion by the Court of Appeals on both points. The warden\nof a Michigan correctional facility is the petitioner here,\nand Van Chester Thompkins, who was convicted, is the\nrespondent.\n2                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  On January 10, 2000, a shooting occurred outside a mall\nin Southfield, Michigan. Among the victims was Samuel\nMorris, who died from multiple gunshot wounds. The\nother victim, Frederick France, recovered from his injuries\nand later testified. Thompkins, who was a suspect, fled.\nAbout one year later he was found in Ohio and arrested\nthere.\n  Two Southfield police officers traveled to Ohio to inter\nrogate Thompkins, then awaiting transfer to Michigan.\nThe interrogation began around 1:30 p.m. and lasted\nabout three hours. The interrogation was conducted in a\nroom that was 8 by 10 feet, and Thompkins sat in a chair\nthat resembled a school desk (it had an arm on it that\nswings around to provide a surface to write on). App.\n144a–145a. At the beginning of the interrogation, one of\nthe officers, Detective Helgert, presented Thompkins with\na form derived from the Miranda rule. It stated:\n     “NOTIFICATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS\n                       AND STATEMENT\n    “1. You have the right to remain silent.\n    “2. Anything you say can and will be used against\n    you in a court of law.\n    “3. You have a right to talk to a lawyer before an\n    swering any questions and you have the right to have\n    a lawyer present with you while you are answering\n    any questions.\n    “4. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be\n    appointed to represent you before any questioning, if\n    you wish one.\n    “5. You have the right to decide at any time before or\n    during questioning to use your right to remain silent\n    and your right to talk with a lawyer while you are be\n    ing questioned.” Brief for Petitioner 60 (some capi\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    talization omitted).\n   Helgert asked Thompkins to read the fifth warning out\nloud. App. 8a. Thompkins complied. Helgert later said\nthis was to ensure that Thompkins could read, and Hel\ngert concluded that Thompkins understood English. Id.,\nat 9a. Helgert then read the other four Miranda warnings\nout loud and asked Thompkins to sign the form to demon\nstrate that he understood his rights. App. 8a–9a. Thomp\nkins declined to sign the form. The record contains con\nflicting evidence about whether Thompkins then verbally\nconfirmed that he understood the rights listed on the form.\nCompare id., at 9a (at a suppression hearing, Helgert\ntestified that Thompkins verbally confirmed that he un\nderstood his rights), with id., at 148a (at trial, Helgert\nstated, “I don’t know that I orally asked him” whether\nThompkins understood his rights).\n   Officers began an interrogation. At no point during the\ninterrogation did Thompkins say that he wanted to re\nmain silent, that he did not want to talk with the police, or\nthat he wanted an attorney. Id., at 10a. Thompkins was\n“[l]argely” silent during the interrogation, which lasted\nabout three hours. Id., at 19a. He did give a few limited\nverbal responses, however, such as “yeah,” “no,” or “I don’t\nknow.” And on occasion he communicated by nodding his\nhead. Id., at 23a. Thompkins also said that he “didn’t\nwant a peppermint” that was offered to him by the police\nand that the chair he was “sitting in was hard.” Id., at\n152a.\n   About 2 hours and 45 minutes into the interrogation,\nHelgert asked Thompkins, “Do you believe in God?” Id., at\n11a, 153a. Thompkins made eye contact with Helgert and\nsaid “Yes,” as his eyes “well[ed] up with tears.” Id., at 11a.\nHelgert asked, “Do you pray to God?” Thompkins said\n“Yes.” Id., at 11a, 153a. Helgert asked, “Do you pray to\nGod to forgive you for shooting that boy down?” Id., at\n4                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n153a. Thompkins answered “Yes” and looked away. Ibid.\nThompkins refused to make a written confession, and the\ninterrogation ended about 15 minutes later. Id., at 11a.\n  Thompkins was charged with first-degree murder,\nassault with intent to commit murder, and certain fire\narms-related offenses. He moved to suppress the state\nments made during the interrogation. He argued that he\nhad invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent,\nrequiring police to end the interrogation at once, see\nMichigan v. Mosley, 423 U. S. 96, 103 (1975) (citing\nMiranda, 384 U. S., at 474), that he had not waived his\nright to remain silent, and that his inculpatory statements\nwere involuntary. The trial court denied the motion.\n  At trial, the prosecution’s theory was that Thompkins\nshot the victims from the passenger seat of a van driven\nby Eric Purifoy. Purifoy testified that he had been driving\nthe van and that Thompkins was in the passenger seat\nwhile another man, one Myzell Woodward, was in the\nback. The defense strategy was to pin the blame on Puri\nfoy. Purifoy testified he did not see who fired the weapon\nbecause the van was stopped and he was bending over\nnear the floor when shots were fired. Purifoy explained\nthat, just after the shooting, Thompkins, holding a pistol,\ntold Purifoy, “What the hell you doing? Pull off.” Purifoy\nthen drove away from the scene. App. 170a.\n  So that the Thompkins jury could assess Purifoy’s credi\nbility and knowledge, the prosecution elicited testimony\nfrom Purifoy that he had been tried earlier for the shoot\ning under an aiding-and-abetting theory. Purifoy and\nDetective Helgert testified that a jury acquitted him of the\nmurder and assault charges, convicted him of carrying a\nconcealed weapon in a motor vehicle, and hung on two\nother firearms offenses to which he later pleaded guilty.\nAt Purifoy’s trial, the prosecution had argued that Purifoy\nwas the driver and Thompkins was the shooter. This was\nconsistent with the prosecution’s argument at Thomp\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nkins’s trial.\n   After Purifoy’s trial had ended—but before Thompkins’s\ntrial began—Purifoy sent Thompkins some letters. The\nletters expressed Purifoy’s disappointment that Thomp\nkins’s family thought Purifoy was a “snitch” and a “rat.”\nId., at 179a–180a. In one letter Purifoy offered to send a\ncopy of his trial transcript to Thompkins as proof that\nPurifoy did not place the blame on Thompkins for the\nshooting. Id., at 180a. The letters also contained state\nments by Purifoy that claimed they were both innocent.\nId., at 178a–179a. At Thompkins’s trial, the prosecution\nsuggested that one of Purifoy’s letters appeared to give\nThompkins a trial strategy. It was, the prosecution sug\ngested, that Woodward shot the victims, allowing Purifoy\nand Thompkins to say they dropped to the floor when the\nshooting started. Id., at 187a–189a.\n   During closing arguments, the prosecution suggested\nthat Purifoy lied when he testified that he did not see\nThompkins shoot the victims:\n    “Did Eric Purifoy’s Jury make the right decision? I’m\n    not here to judge that. You are not bound by what his\n    Jury found. Take his testimony for what it was, [a]\n    twisted attempt to help not just an acquaintance but\n    his tight buddy.” Id., at 202a.\nDefense counsel did not object. Defense counsel also did\nnot ask for an instruction informing the jury that it could\nconsider evidence of the outcome of Purifoy’s trial only to\nassess Purifoy’s credibility, not to establish Thompkins’s\nguilt.\n  The jury found Thompkins guilty on all counts. He was\nsentenced to life in prison without parole.\n                           B\n  The trial court denied a motion for new trial filed by\nThompkins’s appellate counsel. The trial court rejected\n6                 BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel for fail\nure to ask for a limiting instruction regarding the outcome\nof Purifoy’s trial, reasoning that this did not prejudice\nThompkins. Id., at 236a.\n   Thompkins appealed this ruling, along with the trial\ncourt’s refusal to suppress his pretrial statements under\nMiranda. The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected the\nMiranda claim, ruling that Thompkins had not invoked\nhis right to remain silent and had waived it. It also re\njected the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, finding\nthat Thompkins failed to show that evidence of Purifoy’s\nconviction for firearms offenses resulted in prejudice.

W. 2d\n676 (2004) (table).\n   Thompkins filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in\nthe United States District Court for the Eastern District of\nMichigan.      The District Court rejected Thompkins’s\nMiranda and ineffective-assistance claims. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 39a–72a. It noted that, under the Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), a fed\neral court cannot grant a petition for a writ of habeas\ncorpus unless the state court’s adjudication of the merits\nwas “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application\nof, clearly established Federal law.”           28 U. S. C.\n§2254(d)(1). The District Court reasoned that Thompkins\ndid not invoke his right to remain silent and was not\ncoerced into making statements during the interrogation.\nIt held further that the Michigan Court of Appeals was not\nunreasonable in determining that Thompkins had waived\nhis right to remain silent.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit\nreversed, ruling for Thompkins on both his Miranda and\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims. 547 F. 3d 572\n(2008). The Court of Appeals ruled that the state court, in\nrejecting Thompkins’s Miranda claim, unreasonably ap\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nplied clearly established federal law and based its decision\non an unreasonable determination of the facts. See 28\nU. S. C. §2254(d). The Court of Appeals acknowledged\nthat a waiver of the right to remain silent need not be\nexpress, as it can be “ ‘inferred from the actions and words\nof the person interrogated.’ ” 547 F. 3d, at 582 (quoting\nNorth Carolina v. Butler, 441 U. S. 369, 373 (1979)). The\npanel held, nevertheless, that the state court was unrea\nsonable in finding an implied waiver in the circumstances\nhere. The Court of Appeals found that the state court\nunreasonably determined the facts because “the evidence\ndemonstrates that Thompkins was silent for two hours\nand forty-five minutes.” 547 F. 3d, at 586. According to\nthe Court of Appeals, Thompkins’s “persistent silence for\nnearly three hours in response to questioning and re\npeated invitations to tell his side of the story offered a\nclear and unequivocal message to the officers: Thompkins\ndid not wish to waive his rights.” Id., at 588.\n  The Court of Appeals next determined that the state\ncourt unreasonably applied clearly established federal law\nby rejecting Thompkins’s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel\nclaim based on counsel’s failure to ask for a limiting in\nstruction regarding Purifoy’s acquittal. The Court of\nAppeals asserted that because Thompkins’s central strat\negy was to pin the blame on Purifoy, there was a reason\nable probability that the result of Thompkins’s trial would\nhave been different if there had been a limiting instruction\nregarding Purifoy’s acquittal.\n  We granted certiorari. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                            II\n  Under AEDPA, a federal court may not grant a habeas\ncorpus application “with respect to any claim that was\nadjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings,” 28\nU.

THOMPKINS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nclearly established Federal law, as determined by the\nSupreme Court of the United States,” §2254(d)(1), or “was\nbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in\nlight of the evidence presented in the State court proceed\ning,” §2254(d)(2). See Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S.\n___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 1). The relevant state-court\ndecision here is the Michigan Court of Appeals’ decision\naffirming Thompkins’s conviction and rejecting his\nMiranda and ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims on\nthe merits.\n                            III\n  The Miranda Court formulated a warning that must be\ngiven to suspects before they can be subjected to custodial\ninterrogation. The substance of the warning still must be\ngiven to suspects today. A suspect in custody must be\nadvised as follows:\n    “He must be warned prior to any questioning that he\n    has the right to remain silent, that anything he says\n    can be used against him in a court of law, that he has\n    the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he\n    cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for\n    him prior to any questioning if he so desires.” 384\n    U. S., at 479.\nAll concede that the warning given in this case was in full\ncompliance with these requirements. The dispute centers\non the response—or nonresponse—from the suspect.\n                             A\n   Thompkins makes various arguments that his answers\nto questions from the detectives were inadmissible. He\nfirst contends that he “invoke[d] his privilege” to remain\nsilent by not saying anything for a sufficient period of\ntime, so the interrogation should have “cease[d]” before he\nmade his inculpatory statements. Id., at 474; see Mosley,\n423 U. S., at 103 (police must “ ‘scrupulously hono[r]’ ” this\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)              9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“critical safeguard” when the accused invokes his or her\n“ ‘right to cut off questioning’ ” (quoting Miranda, supra, at\n474, 479)).\n    This argument is unpersuasive. In the context of invok\ning the Miranda right to counsel, the Court in Davis v.\nUnited States, 512 U. S. 452, 459 (1994), held that a sus\npect must do so “unambiguously.” If an accused makes a\nstatement concerning the right to counsel “that is ambigu\nous or equivocal” or makes no statement, the police are not\nrequired to end the interrogation, ibid., or ask questions to\nclarify whether the accused wants to invoke his or her\nMiranda rights, 512 U. S., at 461–462.\n    The Court has not yet stated whether an invocation of\nthe right to remain silent can be ambiguous or equivocal,\nbut there is no principled reason to adopt different stan\ndards for determining when an accused has invoked the\nMiranda right to remain silent and the Miranda right to\ncounsel at issue in Davis. See, e.g., Solem v. Stumes, 465\nU. S. 638, 648 (1984) (“[M]uch of the logic and language of\n[Mosley],” which discussed the Miranda right to remain\nsilent, “could be applied to the invocation of the [Miranda\nright to counsel]”). Both protect the privilege against\ncompulsory self-incrimination, Miranda, supra, at 467–\n473, by requiring an interrogation to cease when either\nright is invoked, Mosley, supra, at 103 (citing Miranda,\nsupra, at 474); Fare v. Michael C., 442 U. S. 707, 719\n(1979).\n    There is good reason to require an accused who wants to\ninvoke his or her right to remain silent to do so unambigu\nously. A requirement of an unambiguous invocation of\nMiranda rights results in an objective inquiry that\n“avoid[s] difficulties of proof and . . . provide[s] guidance to\nofficers” on how to proceed in the face of ambiguity. Davis,\n512 U. S., at 458–459. If an ambiguous act, omission, or\nstatement could require police to end the interrogation,\npolice would be required to make difficult decisions about\n10                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nan accused’s unclear intent and face the consequence of\nsuppression “if they guess wrong.” Id., at 461. Suppres\nsion of a voluntary confession in these circumstances\nwould place a significant burden on society’s interest in\nprosecuting criminal activity. See id., at 459–461; Moran\nv. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 427 (1986). Treating an am\nbiguous or equivocal act, omission, or statement as an\ninvocation of Miranda rights “might add marginally to\nMiranda’s goal of dispelling the compulsion inherent in\ncustodial interrogation.” Burbine, 475 U. S., at 425. But\n“as Miranda holds, full comprehension of the rights to\nremain silent and request an attorney are sufficient to\ndispel whatever coercion is inherent in the interrogation\nprocess.” Id., at 427; see Davis, supra, at 460.\n  Thompkins did not say that he wanted to remain silent\nor that he did not want to talk with the police. Had he\nmade either of these simple, unambiguous statements, he\nwould have invoked his “ ‘right to cut off questioning.’ ”\nMosley, supra, at 103 (quoting Miranda, supra, at 474).\nHere he did neither, so he did not invoke his right to re\nmain silent.\n                              B\n   We next consider whether Thompkins waived his right\nto remain silent. Even absent the accused’s invocation of\nthe right to remain silent, the accused’s statement during\na custodial interrogation is inadmissible at trial unless the\nprosecution can establish that the accused “in fact know\ningly and voluntarily waived [Miranda] rights” when\nmaking the statement. Butler, 441 U. S., at 373. The\nwaiver inquiry “has two distinct dimensions”: waiver must\nbe “voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free\nand deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion,\nor deception,” and “made with a full awareness of both the\nnature of the right being abandoned and the consequences\nof the decision to abandon it.” Burbine, supra, at 421.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Some language in Miranda could be read to indicate\nthat waivers are difficult to establish absent an explicit\nwritten waiver or a formal, express oral statement.\nMiranda said “a valid waiver will not be presumed simply\nfrom the silence of the accused after warnings are given or\nsimply from the fact that a confession was in fact eventu\nally obtained.” 384 U. S., at 475; see id., at 470 (“No effec\ntive waiver . . . can be recognized unless specifically made\nafter the [Miranda] warnings . . . have been given”). In\naddition, the Miranda Court stated that “a heavy burden\nrests on the government to demonstrate that the defen\ndant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege\nagainst self-incrimination and his right to retained or\nappointed counsel.” Id., at 475.\n   The course of decisions since Miranda, informed by the\napplication of Miranda warnings in the whole course of\nlaw enforcement, demonstrates that waivers can be estab\nlished even absent formal or express statements of waiver\nthat would be expected in, say, a judicial hearing to de\ntermine if a guilty plea has been properly entered. Cf.\nFed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11. The main purpose of Miranda is\nto ensure that an accused is advised of and understands\nthe right to remain silent and the right to counsel. See\nDavis, supra, at 460; Burbine, supra, at 427. Thus, “[i]f\nanything, our subsequent cases have reduced the impact\nof the Miranda rule on legitimate law enforcement while\nreaffirming the decision’s core ruling that unwarned\nstatements may not be used as evidence in the prosecu\ntion’s case in chief.” Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S.\n428, 443–444 (2000).\n   One of the first cases to decide the meaning and import\nof Miranda with respect to the question of waiver was\nNorth Carolina v. Butler. The Butler Court, after discuss\ning some of the problems created by the language in\nMiranda, established certain important propositions.\nButler interpreted the Miranda language concerning the\n12                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“heavy burden” to show waiver, 384 U. S., at 475, in ac\ncord with usual principles of determining waiver, which\ncan include waiver implied from all the circumstances.\nSee Butler, supra, at 373, 376. And in a later case, the\nCourt stated that this “heavy burden” is not more than the\nburden to establish waiver by a preponderance of the\nevidence. Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U. S. 157, 168 (1986).\n  The prosecution therefore does not need to show that a\nwaiver of Miranda rights was express. An “implicit\nwaiver” of the “right to remain silent” is sufficient to admit\na suspect’s statement into evidence. Butler, supra, at 376.\nButler made clear that a waiver of Miranda rights may be\nimplied through “the defendant’s silence, coupled with an\nunderstanding of his rights and a course of conduct indi\ncating waiver.” 441 U. S., at 373. The Court in Butler\ntherefore “retreated” from the “language and tenor of the\nMiranda opinion,” which “suggested that the Court would\nrequire that a waiver . . . be ‘specifically made.’ ” Con\nnecticut v. Barrett, 479 U. S. 523, 531–532 (1987) (Bren\nnan, J., concurring in judgment).\n  If the State establishes that a Miranda warning was\ngiven and the accused made an uncoerced statement, this\nshowing, standing alone, is insufficient to demonstrate “a\nvalid waiver” of Miranda rights. Miranda, supra, at 475.\nThe prosecution must make the additional showing that\nthe accused understood these rights. See Colorado v.\nSpring, 479 U. S. 564, 573–575 (1987); Barrett, supra, at\n530; Burbine, supra, at 421–422. Cf. Tague v. Louisiana,\n444 U. S. 469, 469, 471 (1980) (per curiam) (no evidence\nthat accused understood his Miranda rights); Carnley v.\nCochran, 369 U. S. 506, 516 (1962) (government could not\nshow that accused “understandingly” waived his right to\ncounsel in light of “silent record”). Where the prosecution\nshows that a Miranda warning was given and that it was\nunderstood by the accused, an accused’s uncoerced state\nment establishes an implied waiver of the right to remain\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsilent.\n   Although Miranda imposes on the police a rule that is\nboth formalistic and practical when it prevents them from\ninterrogating suspects without first providing them with a\nMiranda warning, see Burbine, 475 U. S., at 427, it does\nnot impose a formalistic waiver procedure that a suspect\nmust follow to relinquish those rights. As a general\nproposition, the law can presume that an individual who,\nwith a full understanding of his or her rights, acts in a\nmanner inconsistent with their exercise has made a delib\nerate choice to relinquish the protection those rights af\nford. See, e.g., Butler, supra, at 372–376; Connelly, supra,\nat 169–170 (“There is obviously no reason to require more\nin the way of a ‘voluntariness’ inquiry in the Miranda\nwaiver context than in the [due process] confession con\ntext”). The Court’s cases have recognized that a waiver of\nMiranda rights need only meet the standard of Johnson v.\nZerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 464 (1938). See Butler, supra, at\n374–375; Miranda, supra, at 475–476 (applying Zerbst\nstandard of intentional relinquishment of a known right).\nAs Butler recognized, 441 U. S., at 375–376, Miranda\nrights can therefore be waived through means less formal\nthan a typical waiver on the record in a courtroom, cf. Fed.\nRule Crim. Proc. 11, given the practical constraints and\nnecessities of interrogation and the fact that Miranda’s\nmain protection lies in advising defendants of their rights,\nsee Davis, 512 U. S., at 460; Burbine, 475 U. S., at 427.\n   The record in this case shows that Thompkins waived\nhis right to remain silent. There is no basis in this case to\nconclude that he did not understand his rights; and on\nthese facts it follows that he chose not to invoke or rely on\nthose rights when he did speak. First, there is no conten\ntion that Thompkins did not understand his rights; and\nfrom this it follows that he knew what he gave up when he\nspoke. See id., at 421. There was more than enough\nevidence in the record to conclude that Thompkins under\n14               BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstood his Miranda rights. Thompkins received a written\ncopy of the Miranda warnings; Detective Helgert deter\nmined that Thompkins could read and understand Eng\nlish; and Thompkins was given time to read the warnings.\nThompkins, furthermore, read aloud the fifth warning,\nwhich stated that “you have the right to decide at any time\nbefore or during questioning to use your right to remain\nsilent and your right to talk with a lawyer while you are\nbeing questioned.” Brief for Petitioner 60 (capitalization\nomitted). He was thus aware that his right to remain\nsilent would not dissipate after a certain amount of time\nand that police would have to honor his right to be silent\nand his right to counsel during the whole course of inter\nrogation. Those rights, the warning made clear, could be\nasserted at any time. Helgert, moreover, read the warn\nings aloud.\n   Second, Thompkins’s answer to Detective Helgert’s\nquestion about whether Thompkins prayed to God for\nforgiveness for shooting the victim is a “course of conduct\nindicating waiver” of the right to remain silent. Butler,\nsupra, at 373. If Thompkins wanted to remain silent, he\ncould have said nothing in response to Helgert’s questions,\nor he could have unambiguously invoked his Miranda\nrights and ended the interrogation. The fact that Thomp\nkins made a statement about three hours after receiving a\nMiranda warning does not overcome the fact that he\nengaged in a course of conduct indicating waiver. Police\nare not required to rewarn suspects from time to time.\nThompkins’s answer to Helgert’s question about praying\nto God for forgiveness for shooting the victim was suffi\ncient to show a course of conduct indicating waiver. This\nis confirmed by the fact that before then Thompkins\nhad given sporadic answers to questions throughout the\ninterrogation.\n   Third, there is no evidence that Thompkins’s statement\nwas coerced. See Burbine, supra, at 421. Thompkins does\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot claim that police threatened or injured him during the\ninterrogation or that he was in any way fearful. The\ninterrogation was conducted in a standard-sized room in\nthe middle of the afternoon. It is true that apparently he\nwas in a straight-backed chair for three hours, but there is\nno authority for the proposition that an interrogation of\nthis length is inherently coercive. Indeed, even where\ninterrogations of greater duration were held to be im\nproper, they were accompanied, as this one was not, by\nother facts indicating coercion, such as an incapacitated\nand sedated suspect, sleep and food deprivation, and\nthreats. Cf. Connelly, 479 U. S., at 163–164, n. 1. The fact\nthat Helgert’s question referred to Thompkins’s religious\nbeliefs also did not render Thompkins’s statement invol\nuntary. “[T]he Fifth Amendment privilege is not con\ncerned ‘with moral and psychological pressures to confess\nemanating from sources other than official coercion.’ ” Id.,\nat 170 (quoting Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, 305\n(1985)). In these circumstances, Thompkins knowingly\nand voluntarily made a statement to police, so he waived\nhis right to remain silent.\n                             C\n  Thompkins next argues that, even if his answer to\nDetective Helgert could constitute a waiver of his right to\nremain silent, the police were not allowed to question him\nuntil they obtained a waiver first. Butler forecloses this\nargument. The Butler Court held that courts can infer a\nwaiver of Miranda rights “from the actions and words of\nthe person interrogated.” 441 U. S., at 373. This principle\nwould be inconsistent with a rule that requires a waiver at\nthe outset. The Butler Court thus rejected the rule pro\nposed by the Butler dissent, which would have “requir[ed]\nthe police to obtain an express waiver of [Miranda rights]\nbefore proceeding with interrogation.” Id., at 379 (Bren\nnan, J., dissenting). This holding also makes sense given\n16               BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat “the primary protection afforded suspects subject[ed]\nto custodial interrogation is the Miranda warnings them\nselves.” Davis, 512 U. S., at 460. The Miranda rule and\nits requirements are met if a suspect receives adequate\nMiranda warnings, understands them, and has an oppor\ntunity to invoke the rights before giving any answers or\nadmissions. Any waiver, express or implied, may be con\ntradicted by an invocation at any time. If the right to\ncounsel or the right to remain silent is invoked at any\npoint during questioning, further interrogation must\ncease.\n   Interrogation provides the suspect with additional\ninformation that can put his or her decision to waive, or\nnot to invoke, into perspective. As questioning commences\nand then continues, the suspect has the opportunity to\nconsider the choices he or she faces and to make a more\ninformed decision, either to insist on silence or to cooper\nate. When the suspect knows that Miranda rights can be\ninvoked at any time, he or she has the opportunity to\nreassess his or her immediate and long-term interests.\nCooperation with the police may result in more favorable\ntreatment for the suspect; the apprehension of accom\nplices; the prevention of continuing injury and fear; begin\nning steps towards relief or solace for the victims; and the\nbeginning of the suspect’s own return to the law and the\nsocial order it seeks to protect.\n   In order for an accused’s statement to be admissible at\ntrial, police must have given the accused a Miranda warn\ning. See Miranda, 384 U. S., at 471. If that condition is\nestablished, the court can proceed to consider whether\nthere has been an express or implied waiver of Miranda\nrights. Id., at 476. In making its ruling on the admissibil\nity of a statement made during custodial questioning, the\ntrial court, of course, considers whether there is evidence\nto support the conclusion that, from the whole course of\nquestioning, an express or implied waiver has been estab\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlished. Thus, after giving a Miranda warning, police may\ninterrogate a suspect who has neither invoked nor waived\nhis or her Miranda rights. On these premises, it fol-\nlows the police were not required to obtain a waiver of\nThompkins’s Miranda rights before commencing the\ninterrogation.\n                             D\n   In sum, a suspect who has received and understood the\nMiranda warnings, and has not invoked his Miranda\nrights, waives the right to remain silent by making an\nuncoerced statement to the police. Thompkins did not\ninvoke his right to remain silent and stop the questioning.\nUnderstanding his rights in full, he waived his right to\nremain silent by making a voluntary statement to the\npolice. The police, moreover, were not required to obtain a\nwaiver of Thompkins’s right to remain silent before inter\nrogating him. The state court’s decision rejecting Thomp\nkins’s Miranda claim was thus correct under de novo\nreview and therefore necessarily reasonable under the\nmore deferential AEDPA standard of review, 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(d). See Knowles, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11)\n(state court’s decision was correct under de novo review\nand not unreasonable under AEDPA).\n                             IV\n  The second issue in this case is whether Thompkins’s\ncounsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to re\nquest a limiting instruction regarding how the jury could\nconsider the outcome of Purifoy’s trial. To establish inef\nfective assistance of counsel, a defendant “must show both\ndeficient performance and prejudice.” Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 10) (citing Strickland, 466 U. S., at 687). To establish\nprejudice, a “defendant must show that there is a reason\nable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been dif\n18               BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nferent.” Strickland, 466 U. S., at 694. In assessing preju\ndice, courts “must consider the totality of the evidence\nbefore the judge or jury.” Id., at 695. The Court of Ap\npeals, however, neglected to take into account the other\nevidence presented against Thompkins.\n   The Court of Appeals determined that the state court\nwas unreasonable, 28 U. S. C. §2254(d), when it found that\nThompkins suffered no prejudice from failure of defense\ncounsel to request an instruction regarding Purifoy’s\nearlier acquittal of the murder and assault charges. The\nstate court had rejected Thompkins’s claim that he was\nprejudiced by evidence of Purifoy’s earlier conviction for\nfirearms offenses, noting that “the record does not disclose\nan attempt to argue that conviction for an improper pur\npose.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 80a. It is unclear what preju\ndice standard the state court applied. The Court of Ap\npeals ruled that the state court used the incorrect\nstandard for assessing prejudice under Strickland because\n“[q]uestions of the prosecution’s purpose or intent are\ncompletely irrelevant in analyzing whether an error re\nsulted in prejudice, which by definition concerns the er\nror’s effect upon the outcome.” 547 F. 3d, at 591–592\n(emphasis deleted).\n   Even if the state court used an incorrect legal standard,\nwe need not determine whether AEDPA’s deferential\nstandard of review, 28 U. S. C. §2254(d), applies in this\nsituation. Cf. Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 397–398\n(2000). That is because, even if AEDPA deference does not\napply, Thompkins cannot show prejudice under de novo\nreview, the more favorable standard of review for Thomp\nkins. Courts cannot grant writs of habeas corpus under\n§2254 by engaging only in de novo review when it is un\nclear whether AEDPA deference applies, §2254(d). In\nthose situations, courts must resolve whether AEDPA\ndeference applies, because if it does, a habeas petitioner\nmay not be entitled to a writ of habeas corpus under\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n§2254(d). Courts can, however, deny writs of habeas\ncorpus under §2254 by engaging in de novo review when it\nis unclear whether AEDPA deference applies, because a\nhabeas petitioner will not be entitled to a writ of habeas\ncorpus if his or her claim is rejected on de novo review, see\n§2254(a).\n  It seems doubtful that failure to request the instruction\nabout the earlier acquittal or conviction was deficient\nrepresentation; but on the assumption that it was, on this\nrecord Thompkins cannot show prejudice. The record\nestablishes that it was not reasonably likely that the\ninstruction would have made any difference in light of all\nthe other evidence of guilt. The surviving victim, Freder\nick France, identified Thompkins as the shooter, and the\nidentification was supported by a photograph taken from a\nsurveillance camera. Thompkins’s friend Omar Stephens\ntestified that Thompkins confessed to him during a phone\nconversation, and the details of that confession were cor\nroborated by evidence that Thompkins stripped the van\nand abandoned it after the shooting. The jury, moreover,\nwas capable of assessing Purifoy’s credibility, as it was\ninstructed to do. The jury in Thompkins’s case could have\nconcluded that the earlier jury in Purifoy’s case made a\nmistake, or alternatively, that Purifoy was not in fact\nguilty of the crime for which he had been charged. There\nwas ample evidence in the record to support Thompkins’s\nguilt under either theory, and his jury was instructed to\nweigh all of the evidence in determining whether there\nwas guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Under our de novo\nreview of this record, Thompkins cannot show prejudice.\n                     *   *     *\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed,\nand the case is remanded with instructions to deny the\npetition.\n                                        It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

The\nCourt also concludes that a suspect who wishes to guard\nhis right to remain silent against such a finding of\n“waiver” must, counterintuitively, speak—and must do so\nwith sufficient precision to satisfy a clear-statement rule\nthat construes ambiguity in favor of the police. Both\npropositions mark a substantial retreat from the protec­\ntion against compelled self-incrimination that Miranda v.\nArizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), has long provided during\ncustodial interrogation. The broad rules the Court an­\nnounces today are also troubling because they are unnec­\nessary to decide this case, which is governed by the defer­\nential standard of review set forth in the Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28\nU. S. C. §2254(d). Because I believe Thompkins is entitled\nto relief under AEDPA on the ground that his statements\nwere admitted at trial without the prosecution having\ncarried its burden to show that he waived his right to\nremain silent; because longstanding principles of judicial\nrestraint counsel leaving for another day the questions of\n2                 BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nlaw the Court reaches out to decide; and because the\nCourt’s answers to those questions do not result from a\nfaithful application of our prior decisions, I respectfully\ndissent.\n                              I\n   We granted certiorari to review the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which held that\nThompkins was entitled to habeas relief under both\nMiranda and Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668\n(1984). 547 F. 3d 572 (2008). As to the Miranda claims,\nThompkins argues first that through his conduct during\nthe 3-hour custodial interrogation he effectively invoked\nhis right to remain silent, requiring police to cut off ques­\ntioning in accordance with Miranda and Michigan v.\nMosley, 423 U. S. 96 (1975). Thompkins also contends his\nstatements were in any case inadmissible because the\nprosecution failed to meet its heavy burden under\nMiranda of proving that he knowingly and intelligently\nwaived his right to remain silent. The Sixth Circuit\nagreed with Thompkins as to waiver and declined to reach\nthe question of invocation. 547 F. 3d, at 583–584, n. 4. In\nmy view, even if Thompkins cannot prevail on his invoca­\ntion claim under AEDPA, he is entitled to relief as to\nwaiver. Because I would affirm the judgment of the Sixth\nCircuit on that ground, I would not reach Thompkins’\nclaim that he received constitutionally ineffective assis­\ntance of counsel.\n   The strength of Thompkins’ Miranda claims depends in\nlarge part on the circumstances of the 3-hour interroga­\ntion, at the end of which he made inculpatory statements\nlater introduced at trial. The Court’s opinion downplays\nrecord evidence that Thompkins remained almost com­\npletely silent and unresponsive throughout that session.\nOne of the interrogating officers, Detective Helgert, testi­\nfied that although Thompkins was administered Miranda\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwarnings, the last of which he read aloud, Thompkins\nexpressly declined to sign a written acknowledgment that\nhe had been advised of and understood his rights. There\nis conflicting evidence in the record about whether\nThompkins ever verbally confirmed understanding his\nrights.1 The record contains no indication that the officers\nsought or obtained an express waiver.\n   As to the interrogation itself, Helgert candidly charac­\nterized it as “very, very one-sided” and “nearly a mono­\nlogue.” App. 10a, 17a. Thompkins was “[p]eculiar,”\n“[s]ullen,” and “[g]enerally quiet.” Id., at 149a. Helgert\nand his partner “did most of the talking,” as Thompkins\nwas “not verbally communicative” and “[l]argely” re­\nmained silent. Id., at 149a, 17a, 19a. To the extent\nThompkins gave any response, his answers consisted of “a\nword or two. A ‘yeah,’ or a ‘no,’ or ‘I don’t know.’ . . . And\nsometimes . . . he simply sat down . . . with [his] head in\n[his] hands looking down. Sometimes . . . he would look up\nand make eye-contact would be the only response.” Id., at\n23a–24a. After proceeding in this fashion for approxi­\nmately 2 hours and 45 minutes, Helgert asked Thompkins\nthree questions relating to his faith in God. The prosecu­\ntion relied at trial on Thompkins’ one-word answers of\n“yes.” See id., at 10a–11a.\n   Thompkins’ nonresponsiveness is particularly striking\nin the context of the officers’ interview strategy, later\n——————\n  1 At the suppression hearing, Detective Helgert testified that after\nreading Thompkins the warnings, “I believe I asked him if he under­\nstood the Rights, and I think I got a verbal answer to that as a ‘yes.’ ”\nApp. 9a. In denying the motion to suppress, the trial court relied on\nthat factual premise. Id., at 26a. In his later testimony at trial, Hel­\ngert remembered the encounter differently. Asked whether Thompkins\n“indicate[d] that he understood [the warnings]” after they had been\nread, Helgert stated “I don’t know that I orally asked him that ques­\ntion.” Id., at 148a. Nevertheless, the Michigan Court of Appeals stated\nthat Thompkins verbally acknowledged understanding his rights. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 75a.\n4                 BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nexplained as conveying to Thompkins that “this was his\nopportunity to explain his side [of the story]” because\n“[e]verybody else, including [his] co-[d]efendants, had\ngiven their version,” and asking him “[w]ho is going to\nspeak up for you if you don’t speak up for yourself?” Id., at\n10a, 21a. Yet, Helgert confirmed that the “only thing\n[Thompkins said] relative to his involvement [in the shoot­\ning]” occurred near the end of the interview—i.e., in re­\nsponse to the questions about God. Id., at 10a–11a (em­\nphasis added). The only other responses Helgert could\nremember Thompkins giving were that “ ‘[h]e didn’t want\na peppermint’ ” and “ ‘the chair that he was sitting in was\nhard.’ ” Id., at 152a. Nevertheless, the Michigan court\nconcluded on this record that Thompkins had not invoked\nhis right to remain silent because “he continued to talk\nwith the officer, albeit sporadically,” and that he voluntar­\nily waived that right. App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a.\n   Thompkins’ federal habeas petition is governed by\nAEDPA, under which a federal court may not grant the\nwrit unless the state court’s adjudication of the merits of\nthe claim at issue “was contrary to, or involved an unrea­\nsonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United States,”\nor “was based on an unreasonable determination of the\nfacts in light of the evidence presented in the State court\nproceeding.” §§2254(d)(1), (2).\n   The relevant clearly established federal law for purposes\nof §2254(d)(1) begins with our landmark Miranda decision,\nwhich “g[a]ve force to the Constitution’s protection against\ncompelled self-incrimination” by establishing “ ‘certain\nprocedural safeguards that require police to advise crimi­\nnal suspects of their rights under the Fifth and Four­\nteenth Amendments before commencing custodial interro­\ngation,’ ” Florida v. Powell, 559 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 7–8) (quoting Duckworth v. Eagan, 492 U. S.\n195, 201 (1989)). Miranda prescribed the now-familiar\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwarnings that police must administer prior to questioning.\nSee 384 U. S., at 479; ante, at 8. Miranda and our subse­\nquent cases also require police to “respect the accused’s\ndecision to exercise the rights outlined in the warnings.”\nMoran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 420 (1986). “If [an]\nindividual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or\nduring questioning, that he wishes to remain silent” or if\nhe “states that he wants an attorney,” the interrogation\n“must cease.” 384 U. S., at 473–474.\n  Even when warnings have been administered and a\nsuspect has not affirmatively invoked his rights, state­\nments made in custodial interrogation may not be admit­\nted as part of the prosecution’s case in chief “unless and\nuntil” the prosecution demonstrates that an individual\n“knowingly and intelligently waive[d] [his] rights.” Id., at\n479; accord, ante, at 10. “[A] heavy burden rests on the\ngovernment to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly\nand intelligently waived his privilege against self­\nincrimination and his right to retained or appointed coun­\nsel.” Miranda, 384 U. S., at 475. The government must\nsatisfy the “high standar[d] of proof for the waiver of\nconstitutional rights [set forth in] Johnson v. Zerbst, 304\nU. S. 458 (1938).” Ibid.\n  The question whether a suspect has validly waived his\nright is “entirely distinct” as a matter of law from whether\nhe invoked that right. Smith v. Illinois, 469 U. S. 91, 98\n(1984) (per curiam). The questions are related, however,\nin terms of the practical effect on the exercise of a sus­\npect’s rights. A suspect may at any time revoke his prior\nwaiver of rights—or, closer to the facts of this case, guard\nagainst the possibility of a future finding that he implicitly\nwaived his rights—by invoking the rights and thereby\nrequiring the police to cease questioning. Accord, ante, at\n16.\n6                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n                             II \n\n                             A\n\n   Like the Sixth Circuit, I begin with the question\nwhether Thompkins waived his right to remain silent.\nEven if Thompkins did not invoke that right, he is entitled\nto relief because Michigan did not satisfy its burden of\nestablishing waiver.\n   Miranda’s discussion of the prosecution’s burden in\nproving waiver speaks with particular clarity to the facts\nof this case and therefore merits reproducing at length:\n       “If [an] interrogation continues without the pres­\n    ence of an attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy\n    burden rests on the government to demonstrate that\n    the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his\n    privilege against self-incrimination and his right to\n    retained or appointed counsel. . . . Since the State is\n    responsible for establishing the isolated circumstances\n    under which [an] interrogation takes place and has\n    the only means of making available corroborated evi­\n    dence of warnings given during incommunicado inter­\n    rogation, the burden is rightly on its shoulders.\n       “An express statement that the individual is willing\n    to make a statement and does not want an attorney\n    followed closely by a statement could constitute a\n    waiver. But a valid waiver will not be presumed sim­\n    ply from the silence of the accused after warnings are\n    given or simply from the fact that a confession was in\n    fact eventually obtained.” 384 U. S., at 475.\n  Miranda went further in describing the facts likely\nto satisfy the prosecution’s burden of establishing the ad­\nmissibility of statements obtained after a lengthy\ninterrogation:\n      “Whatever the testimony of the authorities as to\n    waiver of rights by an accused, the fact of lengthy in­\n    terrogation or incommunicado incarceration before a\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             7\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n    statement is made is strong evidence that the accused\n    did not validly waive his rights. In these circum­\n    stances the fact that the individual eventually made a\n    statement is consistent with the conclusion that the\n    compelling influence of the interrogation finally forced\n    him to do so. It is inconsistent with any notion of a\n    voluntary relinquishment of the privilege.” Id., at\n    476.\n  This Court’s decisions subsequent to Miranda have\nemphasized the prosecution’s “heavy burden” in proving\nwaiver. See, e.g., Tague v. Louisiana, 444 U. S. 469, 470–\n471 (1980) (per curiam); Fare v. Michael C., 442 U. S. 707,\n724 (1979). We have also reaffirmed that a court may not\npresume waiver from a suspect’s silence or from the mere\nfact that a confession was eventually obtained. See North\nCarolina v. Butler, 441 U. S. 369, 373 (1979).\n  Even in concluding that Miranda does not invariably\nrequire an express waiver of the right to silence or the\nright to counsel, this Court in Butler made clear that the\nprosecution bears a substantial burden in establishing an\nimplied waiver. The Federal Bureau of Investigation had\nobtained statements after advising Butler of his rights and\nconfirming that he understood them. When presented\nwith a written waiver-of-rights form, Butler told the\nagents, “ ‘I will talk to you but I am not signing any form.’ ”\n441 U. S., at 371. He then made inculpatory statements,\nwhich he later sought to suppress on the ground that he\nhad not expressly waived his right to counsel.\n  Although this Court reversed the state-court judgment\nconcluding that the statements were inadmissible, we\nquoted at length portions of the Miranda opinion repro­\nduced above. We cautioned that even an “express written\nor oral statement of waiver of the right to remain silent or\nof the right to counsel” is not “inevitably . . . sufficient to\nestablish waiver,” emphasizing that “[t]he question is . . .\n8                    BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwhether the defendant in fact knowingly and voluntarily\nwaived the rights delineated in the Miranda case.” 441\nU. S., at 373. Miranda, we observed, “unequivocally said\n. . . mere silence is not enough.” 441 U. S., at 373. While\nwe stopped short in Butler of announcing a per se rule that\n“the defendant’s silence, coupled with an understanding of\nhis rights and a course of conduct indicating waiver, may\nnever support a conclusion that a defendant has waived\nhis rights,” we reiterated that “courts must presume that a\ndefendant did not waive his rights; the prosecution’s bur­\nden is great.” Ibid.2\n    Rarely do this Court’s precedents provide clearly estab­\nlished law so closely on point with the facts of a particular\ncase. Together, Miranda and Butler establish that a court\n“must presume that a defendant did not waive his\nright[s]”; the prosecution bears a “heavy burden” in at­\ntempting to demonstrate waiver; the fact of a “lengthy\ninterrogation” prior to obtaining statements is “strong\nevidence” against a finding of valid waiver; “mere silence”\nin response to questioning is “not enough”; and waiver\nmay not be presumed “simply from the fact that a confes­\nsion was in fact eventually obtained.” Miranda, supra, at\n475–476; Butler, supra, at 372–373.3\n——————\n    2 TheCourt cites Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U. S. 157, 168 (1986), for\nthe proposition that the prosecution’s “ ‘heavy burden’ ” under Miranda\n“is not more than the burden to establish waiver by a preponderance of\nthe evidence.” Ante, at 12. Connelly did reject a clear and convincing\nevidence standard of proof in favor of a preponderance burden. But\nnothing in Connelly displaced the core presumption against finding a\nwaiver of rights, and we have subsequently relied on Miranda’s charac­\nterization of the prosecution’s burden as “heavy.” See Arizona v.\nRoberson, 486 U. S. 675, 680 (1988).\n   3 Likely reflecting the great weight of the prosecution’s burden in\n\nproving implied waiver, many contemporary police training resources\ninstruct officers to obtain a waiver of rights prior to proceeding at all\nwith an interrogation. See, e.g., F. Inbau, J. Reid, J. Buckley, & B.\nJayne, Criminal Interrogation and Confessions 491 (4th ed. 2004)\n                    Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                   9\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n  It is undisputed here that Thompkins never expressly\nwaived his right to remain silent. His refusal to sign even\nan acknowledgment that he understood his Miranda\nrights evinces, if anything, an intent not to waive those\nrights. Cf. United States v. Plugh, 576 F. 3d 135, 142\n(CA2 2009) (suspect’s refusal to sign waiver-of-rights form\n“constituted an unequivocally negative answer to the\nquestion . . . whether he was willing to waive his rights”).\nThat Thompkins did not make the inculpatory statements\nat issue until after approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes\nof interrogation serves as “strong evidence” against\nwaiver. Miranda and Butler expressly preclude the possi­\nbility that the inculpatory statements themselves are\nsufficient to establish waiver.\n  In these circumstances, Thompkins’ “actions and words”\npreceding the inculpatory statements simply do not evi­\ndence a “course of conduct indicating waiver” sufficient to\ncarry the prosecution’s burden. See Butler, supra, at 373.4\n——————\n(hereinafter Inbau) (“Once [a] waiver is given, the police may proceed\nwith the interrogation”); D. Zulawski & D. Wicklander, Practical\nAspects of Interview and Interrogation 55 (2d ed. 2002) (“Only upon the\nwaiver of th[e] [Miranda] rights by the suspect can an interrogation\noccur”); see also Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense\nLawyers et al. as Amici Curiae 11–12 (hereinafter NACDL brief)\n(collecting authorities).\n  4 Although such decisions are not controlling under AEDPA, it is\n\nnotable that lower courts have similarly required a showing of words or\nconduct beyond inculpatory statements. See, e.g., United States v.\nWallace, 848 F. 2d 1464, 1475 (CA9 1988) (no implied waiver when\nwarned suspect “maintained her silence for . . . perhap[s] as many as\nten minutes” before answering a question); McDonald v. Lucas, 677\nF. 2d 518, 521–522 (CA5 1982) (no implied waiver when defendant\nrefused to sign waiver and there was “no evidence of words or actions\nimplying a waiver, except the [inculpatory] statement”). Generally,\ncourts have found implied waiver when a warned suspect has made\nincriminating statements “as part of a steady stream of speech or as\npart of a back-and-forth conversation with the police,” or when a\nwarned suspect who previously invoked his right “spontaneously\nrecommences the dialogue with his interviewers.” Bui v. DiPaolo, 170\n10                   BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nAlthough the Michigan court stated that Thompkins\n“sporadically” participated in the interview, App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 75a, that court’s opinion and the record before us\nare silent as to the subject matter or context of even a\nsingle question to which Thompkins purportedly re­\nsponded, other than the exchange about God and the\nstatements respecting the peppermint and the chair.\nUnlike in Butler, Thompkins made no initial declaration\nakin to “I will talk to you.” See also 547 F. 3d, at 586–587\n(case below) (noting that the case might be different if the\nrecord showed Thompkins had responded affirmatively to\nan invitation to tell his side of the story or described any\nparticular question that Thompkins answered). Indeed,\nMichigan and the United States concede that no waiver\noccurred in this case until Thompkins responded “yes” to\nthe questions about God. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7, 30. I\nbelieve it is objectively unreasonable under our clearly\nestablished precedents to conclude the prosecution met its\n“heavy burden” of proof on a record consisting of three one­\nword answers, following 2 hours and 45 minutes of silence\npunctuated by a few largely nonverbal responses to uni­\ndentified questions.\n                           B\n  Perhaps because our prior Miranda precedents so\nclearly favor Thompkins, the Court today goes beyond\nAEDPA’s deferential standard of review and announces a\nnew general principle of law. Any new rule, it must be\nemphasized, is unnecessary to the disposition of this case.\n\n——————\nF. 3d 232, 240 (CA1 1999) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also United States v.

Wold Engineering, P. C., 467 U. S. 138, 157\n(1984). Consistent with that rule, we have frequently\ndeclined to address questions beyond what is necessary to\nresolve a case under AEDPA. See, e.g., Tyler v. Cain, 533\nU. S. 656, 667–668 (2001) (declining to address question\nwhere any statement by this Court would be “dictum” in\nlight of AEDPA’s statutory constraints on habeas review);\ncf. Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 522 (2003) (noting that\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362 (2000), “made no new\nlaw” because the “case was before us on habeas review”).\nNo necessity exists to justify the Court’s broad announce­\nment today.\n   The Court concludes that when Miranda warnings have\nbeen given and understood, “an accused’s uncoerced\nstatement establishes an implied waiver of the right to\nremain silent.” Ante, at 12–13. More broadly still, the\nCourt states that, “[a]s a general proposition, the law can\npresume that an individual who, with a full understanding\nof his or her rights, acts in a manner inconsistent with\ntheir exercise has made a deliberate choice to relinquish\nthe protection those rights afford.” Ante, at 13.\n   These principles flatly contradict our longstanding\nviews that “a valid waiver will not be presumed . . . simply\nfrom the fact that a confession was in fact eventually\nobtained,” Miranda, 384 U. S., at 475, and that “[t]he\ncourts must presume that a defendant did not waive his\nrights,” Butler, 441 U. S., at 373. Indeed, we have in the\npast summarily reversed a state-court decision that in­\nverted Miranda’s antiwaiver presumption, characterizing\n12                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthe error as “readily apparent.” Tague, 444 U. S., at 470–\n471. At best, the Court today creates an unworkable and\nconflicting set of presumptions that will undermine\nMiranda’s goal of providing “concrete constitutional guide­\nlines for law enforcement agencies and courts to follow,”\n384 U. S., at 442. At worst, it overrules sub silentio an\nessential aspect of the protections Miranda has long pro­\nvided for the constitutional guarantee against self­\nincrimination.\n   The Court’s conclusion that Thompkins’ inculpatory\nstatements were sufficient to establish an implied waiver,\nante, at 14, finds no support in Butler. Butler itself distin­\nguished between a sufficient “course of conduct” and in­\nculpatory statements, reiterating Miranda’s admonition\nthat “ ‘a valid waiver will not be presumed simply from . . .\nthe fact that a confession was in fact eventually ob­\ntained.’ ” Butler, supra, at 373 (quoting Miranda, supra,\nat 475). Michigan suggests Butler’s silence “ ‘when ad­\nvised of his right to the assistance of a lawyer,’ ” combined\nwith our remand for the state court to apply the implied­\nwaiver standard, shows that silence followed by state­\nments can be a “ ‘course of conduct.’ ” Brief for Petitioner\n26 (quoting Butler, supra, at 371). But the evidence of\nimplied waiver in Butler was worlds apart from the evi­\ndence in this case, because Butler unequivocally said “I\nwill talk to you” after having been read Miranda warn­\nings. Thompkins, of course, made no such statement.\n   The Court also relies heavily on Burbine in characteriz­\ning the scope of the prosecution’s burden in proving\nwaiver. Consistent with Burbine, the Court observes, the\nprosecution must prove that waiver was “ ‘voluntary in the\nsense that it was the product of a free and deliberate\nchoice rather than intimidation’ ” and “ ‘made with a full\nawareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned\nand the consequences of the decision to abandon it.’ ” Ante,\nat 10 (quoting 475 U. S., at 421). I agree with the Court’s\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nstatement, so far as it goes. What it omits, however, is\nthat the prosecution also bears an antecedent burden of\nshowing there was, in fact, either an express waiver or a\n“course of conduct” sufficiently clear to support a finding of\nimplied waiver. Nothing in Burbine even hints at remov­\ning that obligation. The question in that case, rather, was\nwhether a suspect’s multiple express waivers of his rights\nwere invalid because police “misinformed an inquiring\nattorney about their plans concerning the suspect or be­\ncause they failed to inform the suspect of the attorney’s\nefforts to reach him.” Id., at 420; see also Colorado v.\nSpring, 479 U. S. 564, 573 (1987). The Court’s analysis in\nBurbine was predicated on the existence of waiver-in-fact.\n  Today’s dilution of the prosecution’s burden of proof to\nthe bare fact that a suspect made inculpatory statements\nafter Miranda warnings were given and understood takes\nan unprecedented step away from the “high standards of\nproof for the waiver of constitutional rights” this Court has\nlong demanded. Miranda, supra, at 475; cf. Brewer v.\nWilliams, 430 U. S. 387, 404 (1977) (“[C]ourts indulge in\nevery reasonable presumption against waiver”); Zerbst,\n304 U. S., at 464. When waiver is to be inferred during a\ncustodial interrogation, there are sound reasons to require\nevidence beyond inculpatory statements themselves.\nMiranda and our subsequent cases are premised on the\nidea that custodial interrogation is inherently coercive.\nSee 384 U. S., at 455 (“Even without employing brutality,\nthe ‘third degree’ or [other] specific strategems . . . the\nvery fact of custodial interrogation exacts a heavy toll on\nindividual liberty and trades on the weakness of individu­\nals”); Dickerson v.

The underlying constitutional guar­\nantee against self-incrimination reflects “many of our\nfundamental values and most noble aspirations,” our\nsociety’s “preference for an accusatorial rather than an\ninquisitorial system of criminal justice”; a “fear that self­\nincriminating statements will be elicited by inhumane\ntreatment and abuses” and a resulting “distrust of self­\ndeprecatory statements”; and a realization that while the\nprivilege is “sometimes a shelter to the guilty, [it] is often\na protection to the innocent.” Withrow v.

Such a result bears little sem­\nblance to the “fully effective” prophylaxis, 384 U. S., at\n444, that Miranda requires.\n                              A\n   Thompkins’ claim for relief under AEDPA rests on the\nclearly established federal law of Miranda and Mosley. In\nMiranda, the Court concluded that “[i]f [an] individual\nindicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during\nquestioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interro­\ngation must cease. . . . [A]ny statement taken after the\nperson invokes his privilege cannot be other than the\nproduct of compulsion, subtle or otherwise.” 384 U. S., at\n473–474. In Mosley, the Court said that a “critical safe­\nguard” of the right to remain silent is a suspect’s “ ‘right to\ncut off questioning.’ ” 423 U. S., at 103 (quoting Miranda,\nsupra, at 474). Thus, “the admissibility of statements\nobtained after the person in custody has decided to remain\nsilent depends under Miranda on whether his ‘right to cut\noff questioning’ was ‘scrupulously honored.’ ” 423 U. S., at\n104.5\n   Thompkins contends that in refusing to respond to\nquestions he effectively invoked his right to remain silent,\n——————\n  5 In holding that Mosley’s right had been “ ‘scrupulously honored,’ ”\n\nthe Court observed that he was properly advised of his rights and\nindicated his understanding in writing; that police “immediately\nceased” interrogation when Mosley stated he did not want to discuss\nthe crime and allowed an “interval of more than two hours” to pass\nbefore reapproaching Mosley “at another location about an unrelated\n[crime]”; and that Mosley was readministered “full and complete\nMiranda warnings at the outset of the second interrogation” and had a\n“full and fair opportunity to exercise th[o]se options.” 423 U. S., at 103–\n105.\n16               BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nsuch that police were required to terminate the interroga­\ntion prior to his inculpatory statements. In Michigan’s\nview, Thompkins cannot prevail under AEDPA because\nthis Court’s precedents have not previously established\nwhether a suspect’s ambiguous statements or actions\nrequire the police to stop questioning. We have held that\na suspect who has “ ‘invoked his right to have counsel\npresent . . . is not subject to further interrogation by the\nauthorities until counsel has been made available to him,\nunless [he] initiates further communication, exchanges, or\nconversations with the police.’ ” Maryland v. Shatzer, 559\nU. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5) (quoting Edwards v.\nArizona, 451 U. S. 477, 484–485 (1981)). Notwithstanding\nMiranda’s statement that “there can be no questioning” if\na suspect “indicates in any manner . . . that he wishes to\nconsult with an attorney,” 384 U. S., at 444–445, the Court\nin Davis v. United States, 512 U. S. 452, 461 (1994) estab­\nlished a clear-statement rule for invoking the right to\ncounsel. After a suspect has knowingly and voluntarily\nwaived his Miranda rights, Davis held, police may con­\ntinue questioning “until and unless the suspect clearly\nrequests an attorney.” 512 U. S., at 461 (emphasis added).\n   Because this Court has never decided whether Davis’\nclear-statement rule applies to an invocation of the right\nto silence, Michigan contends, there was no clearly estab­\nlished federal law prohibiting the state court from requir­\ning an unambiguous invocation. That the state court’s\ndecision was not objectively unreasonable is confirmed, in\nMichigan’s view, by the number of federal Courts of Ap­\npeals to have applied Davis to invocation of the right to\nsilence. Brief for Petitioner 44.\n   Under AEDPA’s deferential standard of review, it is\nindeed difficult to conclude that the state court’s applica­\ntion of our precedents was objectively unreasonable.\nAlthough the duration and consistency of Thompkins’\nrefusal to answer questions throughout the 3-hour inter­\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

Because Thompkins\nneither said “he wanted to remain silent” nor said “he did\nnot want to talk with the police,” the Court concludes, he\ndid not clearly invoke his right to silence. Ante, at 8–10.6\n   I disagree with this novel application of Davis. Neither\nthe rationale nor holding of that case compels today’s\nresult. Davis involved the right to counsel, not the right to\nsilence. The Court in Davis reasoned that extending\nEdwards’ “rigid” prophylactic rule to ambiguous requests\nfor a lawyer would transform Miranda into a “ ‘wholly\nirrational obstacl[e] to legitimate police investigative\nactivity’ ” by “needlessly prevent[ing] the police from ques­\ntioning a suspect in the absence of counsel even if [he] did\nnot wish to have a lawyer present.” Davis, supra, at 460.\nBut Miranda itself “distinguished between the procedural\nsafeguards triggered by a request to remain silent and a\nrequest for an attorney.” Mosley, supra, at 104, n. 10;\naccord, Edwards, supra, at 485. Mosley upheld the admis­\nsion of statements when police immediately stopped inter­\nrogating a suspect who invoked his right to silence, but\nreapproached him after a 2-hour delay and obtained in­\n——————\n  6 The Court also ignores a second available avenue to avoid reaching\n\nthe constitutional question. Because the Sixth Circuit declined to\ndecide Thompkins’ invocation claim, a remand would permit the lower\ncourt to address the question in the first instance. Cf. Cutter v. Wilkin\nson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005).\n18                   BERGHUIS v.

The different\neffects of invoking the rights are consistent with distinct\nstandards for invocation. To the extent Mosley contem­\nplates a more flexible form of prophylaxis than Edwards—\nand, in particular, does not categorically bar police from\nreapproaching a suspect who has invoked his right to\nremain silent—Davis’ concern about “ ‘wholly irrational\nobstacles’ ” to police investigation applies with less force.\n   In addition, the suspect’s equivocal reference to a lawyer\nin Davis occurred only after he had given express oral and\nwritten waivers of his rights. Davis’ holding is explicitly\npredicated on that fact. See 512 U. S., at 461 (“We there­\nfore hold that, after a knowing and voluntary waiver of the\nMiranda rights, law enforcement officers may continue\nquestioning until and unless the suspect clearly requests\nan attorney”). The Court ignores this aspect of Davis, as\nwell as the decisions of numerous federal and state courts\ndeclining to apply a clear-statement rule when a suspect\nhas not previously given an express waiver of rights.7\n   In my mind, a more appropriate standard for addressing\na suspect’s ambiguous invocation of the right to remain\nsilent is the constraint Mosley places on questioning a\nsuspect who has invoked that right: The suspect’s “ ‘right\nto cut off questioning’ ” must be “ ‘scrupulously honored.’ ”\nSee 423 U.

Under such\ncircumstances, “scrupulous” respect for the suspect’s\nrights will require police to terminate questioning under\nMosley.8\n   To be sure, such a standard does not provide police with\na bright-line rule. Cf. ante, at 9–10. But, as we have\npreviously recognized, Mosley itself does not offer clear\nguidance to police about when and how interrogation may\ncontinue after a suspect invokes his rights. See Solem v.\nStumes, 465 U. S. 638, 648 (1984); see also Shatzer, 559\nU. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concur­\nring in judgment) (slip op., at 3). Given that police have\nfor nearly 35 years applied Mosley’s fact-specific standard\nin questioning suspects who have invoked their right to\nremain silent; that our cases did not during that time\nresolve what statements or actions suffice to invoke that\nright; and that neither Michigan nor the Solicitor General\nhave provided evidence in this case that the status quo\nhas proved unworkable, I see little reason to believe to­\n——————\n  8 Indeed, this rule appears to reflect widespread contemporary police\npractice. Thompkins’ amici collect a range of training materials that\ninstruct police not to engage in prolonged interrogation after a suspect\nhas failed to respond to initial questioning. See NACDL Brief 32–34.\nOne widely used police manual, for example, teaches that a suspect\nwho “indicates,” “even by silence itself,” his unwillingness to answer\nquestions “has obviously exercised his constitutional privilege against\nself-incrimination.” Inbau 498.\n20                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nday’s clear-statement rule is necessary to ensure effective\nlaw enforcement.\n   Davis’ clear-statement rule is also a poor fit for the right\nto silence. Advising a suspect that he has a “right to\nremain silent” is unlikely to convey that he must speak\n(and must do so in some particular fashion) to ensure the\nright will be protected. Cf. Soffar v. Cockrell, 300 F. 3d\n588, 603 (CA5 2002) (en banc) (DeMoss, J., dissenting)\n(“What in the world must an individual do to exercise his\nconstitutional right to remain silent beyond actually, in\nfact, remaining silent?”). By contrast, telling a suspect “he\nhas the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he\ncannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him\nprior to any questioning if he so desires,” Miranda, 384\nU. S., at 479, implies the need for speech to exercise that\nright. Davis’ requirement that a suspect must “clearly\nreques[t] an attorney” to terminate questioning thus\naligns with a suspect’s likely understanding of the\nMiranda warnings in a way today’s rule does not. The\nCourt suggests Thompkins could have employed the “sim­\nple, unambiguous” means of saying “he wanted to remain\nsilent” or “did not want to talk with the police.” Ante, at\n10. But the Miranda warnings give no hint that a suspect\nshould use those magic words, and there is little reason to\nbelieve police—who have ample incentives to avoid invoca­\ntion—will provide such guidance.\n   Conversely, the Court’s concern that police will face\n“difficult decisions about an accused’s unclear intent” and\nsuffer the consequences of “ ‘guess[ing] wrong,’ ” ante, at 9–\n10 (quoting Davis, 512 U. S., at 461), is misplaced. If a\nsuspect makes an ambiguous statement or engages in\nconduct that creates uncertainty about his intent to invoke\nhis right, police can simply ask for clarification. See id., at\n467 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment). It is hardly an\nunreasonable burden for police to ask a suspect, for in­\nstance, “Do you want to talk to us?” The majority in Davis\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

Given this straight­\nforward mechanism by which police can “scrupulously\nhono[r]” a suspect’s right to silence, today’s clear­\nstatement rule can only be seen as accepting “as tolerable\nthe certainty that some poorly expressed requests [to\nremain silent] will be disregarded,” id., at 471 (opinion of\nSouter, J.), without any countervailing benefit. Police may\nwell prefer not to seek clarification of an ambiguous\nstatement out of fear that a suspect will invoke his rights.\nBut “our system of justice is not founded on a fear that a\nsuspect will exercise his rights. ‘If the exercise of constitu­\ntional rights will thwart the effectiveness of a system of\nlaw enforcement, then there is something very wrong with\nthat system.’ ” Burbine, 475 U. S., at 458 (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting) (quoting Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478,\n490 (1964)).\n   The Court asserts in passing that treating ambiguous\nstatements or acts as an invocation of the right to silence\nwill only “ ‘marginally’ ” serve Miranda’s goals. Ante, at\n10. Experience suggests the contrary. In the 16 years\nsince Davis was decided, ample evidence has accrued that\ncriminal suspects often use equivocal or colloquial lan­\nguage in attempting to invoke their right to silence. A\nnumber of lower courts that have (erroneously, in my\nview) imposed a clear-statement requirement for invoca­\ntion of the right to silence have rejected as ambiguous an\narray of statements whose meaning might otherwise be\nthought plain.9 At a minimum, these decisions suggest\n——————\n  9 See United States v. Sherrod, 445 F. 3d 980, 982 (CA7 2006) (sus­\n\npect’s statement “ ‘I’m not going to talk about nothin’ ’ ” was ambiguous,\n“as much a taunt—even a provocation—as it [was] an invocation of the\nright to remain silent”); Burket v.

Argued March 1, 2010—Decided June 1, 2010\nAfter advising respondent Thompkins of his rights, in full compliance\n  with Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, Detective Helgert and an\n  other Michigan officer interrogated him about a shooting in which\n  one victim died. At no point did Thompkins say that he wanted to\n  remain silent, that he did not want to talk with the police, or that he\n  wanted an attorney. He was largely silent during the 3-hour interro\n  gation, but near the end, he answered “yes” when asked if he prayed\n  to God to forgive him for the shooting. He moved to suppress his\n  statements, claiming that he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right\n  to remain silent, that he had not waived that right, and that his in\n  culpatory statements were involuntary. The trial court denied the\n  motion. At trial on first-degree murder and other charges, the prose\n  cution called Eric Purifoy, who drove the van in which Thompkins\n  and a third accomplice were riding at the time of the shooting, and\n  who had been convicted of firearm offenses but acquitted of murder\n  and assault. Thompkins’ defense was that Purifoy was the shooter.\n  Purifoy testified that he did not see who fired the shots. During clos\n  ing arguments, the prosecution suggested that Purifoy lied about not\n  seeing the shooter and pondered whether Purifoy’s jury had made the\n  right decision. Defense counsel did not ask the court to instruct the\n  jury that it could consider evidence of the outcome of Purifoy’s trial\n  only to assess his credibility, not to establish Thompkins’ guilt. The\n  jury found Thompkins guilty, and he was sentenced to life in prison\n  without parole. In denying his motion for a new trial, the trial court\n  rejected as nonprejudicial his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim\n  for failure to request a limiting instruction about the outcome of Puri\n  foy’s trial. On appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected both\n  Thompkins’ Miranda and his ineffective-assistance claims. The Fed\n2                      BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    eral District Court denied his subsequent habeas request, reasoning\n    that Thompkins did not invoke his right to remain silent and was not\n    coerced into making statements during the interrogation, and that it\n    was not unreasonable, for purposes of the Antiterrorism and Effective\n    Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), see 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1), for\n    the State Court of Appeals to determine that he had waived his right\n    to remain silent. The Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that the state\n    court was unreasonable in finding an implied waiver of Thompkins’\n    right to remain silent and in rejecting his ineffective-assistance-of\n    counsel claim.\nHeld:\n    1. The state court’s decision rejecting Thompkins’ Miranda claim\n was correct under de novo review and therefore necessarily reason\n able under AEDPA’s more deferential standard of review. Pp. 7–17.\n       (a) Thompkins’ silence during the interrogation did not invoke\n his right to remain silent. A suspect’s Miranda right to counsel must\n be invoked “unambiguously.” Davis v. United States, 512 U. S. 452,\n 459. If the accused makes an “ambiguous or equivocal” statement or\n no statement, the police are not required to end the interrogation,\n ibid., or ask questions to clarify the accused’s intent, id., at 461–462.\n There is no principled reason to adopt different standards for deter\n mining when an accused has invoked the Miranda right to remain si\n lent and the Miranda right to counsel at issue in Davis. Both protect\n the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination by requiring an\n interrogation to cease when either right is invoked. The unambigu\n ous invocation requirement results in an objective inquiry that\n “avoid[s] difficulties of proof and . . . provide[s] guidance to officers”\n on how to proceed in the face of ambiguity. Davis, supra, at 458–459.\n Had Thompkins said that he wanted to remain silent or that he did\n not want to talk, he would have invoked his right to end the question\n ing. He did neither. Pp. 8–10.\n       (b) Thompkins waived his right to remain silent when he know\n ingly and voluntarily made a statement to police. A waiver must be\n “the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation,\n coercion, or deception” and “made with a full awareness of both the\n nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the de\n cision to abandon it.” Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 421. Such a\n waiver may be “implied” through a “defendant’s silence, coupled with\n an understanding of his rights and a course of conduct indicating\n waiver.” North Carolina v. Butler, 441 U. S. 369, 373. If the State\n establishes that a Miranda warning was given and that it was un\n derstood by the accused, an accused’s uncoerced statement estab\n lishes an implied waiver. The record here shows that Thompkins\n waived his right to remain silent. First, the lack of any contention\n                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nthat he did not understand his rights indicates that he knew what he\ngave up when he spoke. See Burbine, supra, at 421. Second, his an\nswer to the question about God is a “course of conduct indicating\nwaiver” of that right. Butler, supra, at 373. Had he wanted to re\nmain silent, he could have said nothing in response or unambigu\nously invoked his Miranda rights, ending the interrogation. That he\nmade a statement nearly three hours after receiving a Miranda\nwarning does not overcome the fact that he engaged in a course of\nconduct indicating waiver. Third, there is no evidence that his\nstatement was coerced. See Burbine, supra, at 421. He does not\nclaim that police threatened or injured him or that he was fearful.\nThe interrogation took place in a standard-sized room in the middle\nof the day, and there is no authority for the proposition that a 3-hour\ninterrogation is inherently coercive. Cf. Colorado v. Connelly, 479\nU. S. 157, 163–164, n. 1. The fact that the question referred to reli\ngious beliefs also does not render his statement involuntary. Id., at\n170. Pp. 10–15.\n      (c) Thompkins argues that, even if his answer to Helgert could\nconstitute a waiver of his right to remain silent, the police were not\nallowed to question him until they first obtained a waiver. However,\na rule requiring a waiver at the outset would be inconsistent with\nButler’s holding that courts can infer a waiver “from the actions and\nwords of the person interrogated.” 441 U. S., at 373. Any waiver, ex\npress or implied, may be contradicted by an invocation at any time,\nterminating further interrogation. When the suspect knows that\nMiranda rights can be invoked at any time, he or she can reassess his\nor her immediate and long-term interests as the interrogation pro\ngresses. After giving a Miranda warning, police may interrogate a\nsuspect who has neither invoked nor waived Miranda rights. Thus,\nthe police were not required to obtain a waiver of Thompkins’\nMiranda rights before interrogating him. Pp. 15–17.\n   2. Even if his counsel provided ineffective assistance, Thompkins\ncannot show prejudice under a de novo review of this record. To es\ntablish ineffective assistance, a defendant “must show both deficient\nperformance and prejudice.” Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___,\n___. To establish prejudice, a “defendant must show that there is a\nreasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors,\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different,” Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U. S. 668, 694, considering “the totality of the evi\ndence before the judge or jury,” id., at 695. Here, the Sixth Circuit\ndid not account for the other evidence presented against Thompkins.\nThe state court rejected his claim that he was prejudiced by evidence\nof Purifoy’s earlier conviction. Even if it used an incorrect legal stan\ndard, this Court need not determine whether AEDPA’s deferential\n4                      BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    standard of review applies here, since Thompkins cannot show preju\n    dice under de novo review, a more favorable standard for him. De\n    novo review can be used in this case because a habeas petitioner will\n    not be entitled to relief if his or her claim is rejected on de novo re\n    view. See §2254(a). Assuming that failure to request a limiting in\n    struction here was deficient representation, Thompkins cannot show\n    prejudice, for the record shows that it was not reasonably likely that\n    such an instruction would have made any difference in light of other\n    evidence of guilt. The surviving victim identified Thompkins as the\n    shooter, and the identification was supported by a surveillance cam\n    era photograph. A friend testified that Thompkins confessed to him,\n    and the details of that confession were corroborated by evidence that\n    Thompkins stripped and abandoned the van after the shooting. The\n    jury, moreover, was capable of assessing Purifoy’s credibility, as it\n    was instructed to do.

First, the Court of Appeals determined that a state\nment by the accused, relied on at trial by the prosecution,\nhad been elicited in violation of Miranda v. Arizona, 384\nU. S. 436 (1966). Second, it found that failure to ask for\nan instruction relating to testimony from an accomplice\nwas ineffective assistance by defense counsel. See Strick\nland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Both of these\ncontentions had been rejected in Michigan courts and in\nthe habeas corpus proceedings before the United States\nDistrict Court. Certiorari was granted to review the deci\nsion by the Court of Appeals on both points. The warden\nof a Michigan correctional facility is the petitioner here,\nand Van Chester Thompkins, who was convicted, is the\nrespondent.\n2                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  On January 10, 2000, a shooting occurred outside a mall\nin Southfield, Michigan. Among the victims was Samuel\nMorris, who died from multiple gunshot wounds. The\nother victim, Frederick France, recovered from his injuries\nand later testified. Thompkins, who was a suspect, fled.\nAbout one year later he was found in Ohio and arrested\nthere.\n  Two Southfield police officers traveled to Ohio to inter\nrogate Thompkins, then awaiting transfer to Michigan.\nThe interrogation began around 1:30 p.m. and lasted\nabout three hours. The interrogation was conducted in a\nroom that was 8 by 10 feet, and Thompkins sat in a chair\nthat resembled a school desk (it had an arm on it that\nswings around to provide a surface to write on). App.\n144a–145a. At the beginning of the interrogation, one of\nthe officers, Detective Helgert, presented Thompkins with\na form derived from the Miranda rule. It stated:\n     “NOTIFICATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS\n                       AND STATEMENT\n    “1. You have the right to remain silent.\n    “2. Anything you say can and will be used against\n    you in a court of law.\n    “3. You have a right to talk to a lawyer before an\n    swering any questions and you have the right to have\n    a lawyer present with you while you are answering\n    any questions.\n    “4. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be\n    appointed to represent you before any questioning, if\n    you wish one.\n    “5. You have the right to decide at any time before or\n    during questioning to use your right to remain silent\n    and your right to talk with a lawyer while you are be\n    ing questioned.” Brief for Petitioner 60 (some capi\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

Helgert later said\nthis was to ensure that Thompkins could read, and Hel\ngert concluded that Thompkins understood English. Id.,\nat 9a. Helgert then read the other four Miranda warnings\nout loud and asked Thompkins to sign the form to demon\nstrate that he understood his rights. App. 8a–9a. Thomp\nkins declined to sign the form. The record contains con\nflicting evidence about whether Thompkins then verbally\nconfirmed that he understood the rights listed on the form.\nCompare id., at 9a (at a suppression hearing, Helgert\ntestified that Thompkins verbally confirmed that he un\nderstood his rights), with id., at 148a (at trial, Helgert\nstated, “I don’t know that I orally asked him” whether\nThompkins understood his rights).\n   Officers began an interrogation. At no point during the\ninterrogation did Thompkins say that he wanted to re\nmain silent, that he did not want to talk with the police, or\nthat he wanted an attorney. Id., at 10a. Thompkins was\n“[l]argely” silent during the interrogation, which lasted\nabout three hours. Id., at 19a. He did give a few limited\nverbal responses, however, such as “yeah,” “no,” or “I don’t\nknow.” And on occasion he communicated by nodding his\nhead. Id., at 23a. Thompkins also said that he “didn’t\nwant a peppermint” that was offered to him by the police\nand that the chair he was “sitting in was hard.” Id., at\n152a.\n   About 2 hours and 45 minutes into the interrogation,\nHelgert asked Thompkins, “Do you believe in God?” Id., at\n11a, 153a. Thompkins made eye contact with Helgert and\nsaid “Yes,” as his eyes “well[ed] up with tears.” Id., at 11a.\nHelgert asked, “Do you pray to God?” Thompkins said\n“Yes.” Id., at 11a, 153a. Helgert asked, “Do you pray to\nGod to forgive you for shooting that boy down?” Id., at\n4                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n153a. Thompkins answered “Yes” and looked away. Ibid.\nThompkins refused to make a written confession, and the\ninterrogation ended about 15 minutes later. Id., at 11a.\n  Thompkins was charged with first-degree murder,\nassault with intent to commit murder, and certain fire\narms-related offenses. He moved to suppress the state\nments made during the interrogation. He argued that he\nhad invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent,\nrequiring police to end the interrogation at once, see\nMichigan v. Mosley, 423 U. S. 96, 103 (1975) (citing\nMiranda, 384 U. S., at 474), that he had not waived his\nright to remain silent, and that his inculpatory statements\nwere involuntary. The trial court denied the motion.\n  At trial, the prosecution’s theory was that Thompkins\nshot the victims from the passenger seat of a van driven\nby Eric Purifoy. Purifoy testified that he had been driving\nthe van and that Thompkins was in the passenger seat\nwhile another man, one Myzell Woodward, was in the\nback. The defense strategy was to pin the blame on Puri\nfoy. Purifoy testified he did not see who fired the weapon\nbecause the van was stopped and he was bending over\nnear the floor when shots were fired. Purifoy explained\nthat, just after the shooting, Thompkins, holding a pistol,\ntold Purifoy, “What the hell you doing? Pull off.” Purifoy\nthen drove away from the scene. App. 170a.\n  So that the Thompkins jury could assess Purifoy’s credi\nbility and knowledge, the prosecution elicited testimony\nfrom Purifoy that he had been tried earlier for the shoot\ning under an aiding-and-abetting theory. Purifoy and\nDetective Helgert testified that a jury acquitted him of the\nmurder and assault charges, convicted him of carrying a\nconcealed weapon in a motor vehicle, and hung on two\nother firearms offenses to which he later pleaded guilty.\nAt Purifoy’s trial, the prosecution had argued that Purifoy\nwas the driver and Thompkins was the shooter. This was\nconsistent with the prosecution’s argument at Thomp\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nkins’s trial.\n   After Purifoy’s trial had ended—but before Thompkins’s\ntrial began—Purifoy sent Thompkins some letters. The\nletters expressed Purifoy’s disappointment that Thomp\nkins’s family thought Purifoy was a “snitch” and a “rat.”\nId., at 179a–180a. In one letter Purifoy offered to send a\ncopy of his trial transcript to Thompkins as proof that\nPurifoy did not place the blame on Thompkins for the\nshooting. Id., at 180a. The letters also contained state\nments by Purifoy that claimed they were both innocent.\nId., at 178a–179a. At Thompkins’s trial, the prosecution\nsuggested that one of Purifoy’s letters appeared to give\nThompkins a trial strategy. It was, the prosecution sug\ngested, that Woodward shot the victims, allowing Purifoy\nand Thompkins to say they dropped to the floor when the\nshooting started. Id., at 187a–189a.\n   During closing arguments, the prosecution suggested\nthat Purifoy lied when he testified that he did not see\nThompkins shoot the victims:\n    “Did Eric Purifoy’s Jury make the right decision? I’m\n    not here to judge that. You are not bound by what his\n    Jury found. Take his testimony for what it was, [a]\n    twisted attempt to help not just an acquaintance but\n    his tight buddy.” Id., at 202a.\nDefense counsel did not object. Defense counsel also did\nnot ask for an instruction informing the jury that it could\nconsider evidence of the outcome of Purifoy’s trial only to\nassess Purifoy’s credibility, not to establish Thompkins’s\nguilt.\n  The jury found Thompkins guilty on all counts. He was\nsentenced to life in prison without parole.\n                           B\n  The trial court denied a motion for new trial filed by\nThompkins’s appellate counsel. The trial court rejected\n6                 BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel for fail\nure to ask for a limiting instruction regarding the outcome\nof Purifoy’s trial, reasoning that this did not prejudice\nThompkins. Id., at 236a.\n   Thompkins appealed this ruling, along with the trial\ncourt’s refusal to suppress his pretrial statements under\nMiranda. The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected the\nMiranda claim, ruling that Thompkins had not invoked\nhis right to remain silent and had waived it. It also re\njected the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, finding\nthat Thompkins failed to show that evidence of Purifoy’s\nconviction for firearms offenses resulted in prejudice. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 74a–82a. The Michigan Supreme Court\ndenied discretionary review. 471 Mich. 866, 683 N. W. 2d\n676 (2004) (table).\n   Thompkins filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in\nthe United States District Court for the Eastern District of\nMichigan.      The District Court rejected Thompkins’s\nMiranda and ineffective-assistance claims. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 39a–72a. It noted that, under the Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), a fed\neral court cannot grant a petition for a writ of habeas\ncorpus unless the state court’s adjudication of the merits\nwas “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application\nof, clearly established Federal law.”           28 U. S. C.\n§2254(d)(1). The District Court reasoned that Thompkins\ndid not invoke his right to remain silent and was not\ncoerced into making statements during the interrogation.\nIt held further that the Michigan Court of Appeals was not\nunreasonable in determining that Thompkins had waived\nhis right to remain silent.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit\nreversed, ruling for Thompkins on both his Miranda and\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims. 547 F. 3d 572\n(2008). The Court of Appeals ruled that the state court, in\nrejecting Thompkins’s Miranda claim, unreasonably ap\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nplied clearly established federal law and based its decision\non an unreasonable determination of the facts. See 28\nU. S. C. §2254(d). The Court of Appeals acknowledged\nthat a waiver of the right to remain silent need not be\nexpress, as it can be “ ‘inferred from the actions and words\nof the person interrogated.’ ” 547 F. 3d, at 582 (quoting\nNorth Carolina v. Butler, 441 U. S. 369, 373 (1979)). The\npanel held, nevertheless, that the state court was unrea\nsonable in finding an implied waiver in the circumstances\nhere. The Court of Appeals found that the state court\nunreasonably determined the facts because “the evidence\ndemonstrates that Thompkins was silent for two hours\nand forty-five minutes.” 547 F. 3d, at 586. According to\nthe Court of Appeals, Thompkins’s “persistent silence for\nnearly three hours in response to questioning and re\npeated invitations to tell his side of the story offered a\nclear and unequivocal message to the officers: Thompkins\ndid not wish to waive his rights.” Id., at 588.\n  The Court of Appeals next determined that the state\ncourt unreasonably applied clearly established federal law\nby rejecting Thompkins’s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel\nclaim based on counsel’s failure to ask for a limiting in\nstruction regarding Purifoy’s acquittal. The Court of\nAppeals asserted that because Thompkins’s central strat\negy was to pin the blame on Purifoy, there was a reason\nable probability that the result of Thompkins’s trial would\nhave been different if there had been a limiting instruction\nregarding Purifoy’s acquittal.\n  We granted certiorari. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                            II\n  Under AEDPA, a federal court may not grant a habeas\ncorpus application “with respect to any claim that was\nadjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings,” 28\nU. S. C. §2254(d), unless the state court’s decision “was\ncontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\n8                 BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nclearly established Federal law, as determined by the\nSupreme Court of the United States,” §2254(d)(1), or “was\nbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in\nlight of the evidence presented in the State court proceed\ning,” §2254(d)(2). See Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S.\n___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 1). The relevant state-court\ndecision here is the Michigan Court of Appeals’ decision\naffirming Thompkins’s conviction and rejecting his\nMiranda and ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims on\nthe merits.\n                            III\n  The Miranda Court formulated a warning that must be\ngiven to suspects before they can be subjected to custodial\ninterrogation. The substance of the warning still must be\ngiven to suspects today. A suspect in custody must be\nadvised as follows:\n    “He must be warned prior to any questioning that he\n    has the right to remain silent, that anything he says\n    can be used against him in a court of law, that he has\n    the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he\n    cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for\n    him prior to any questioning if he so desires.” 384\n    U. S., at 479.\nAll concede that the warning given in this case was in full\ncompliance with these requirements. The dispute centers\non the response—or nonresponse—from the suspect.\n                             A\n   Thompkins makes various arguments that his answers\nto questions from the detectives were inadmissible. He\nfirst contends that he “invoke[d] his privilege” to remain\nsilent by not saying anything for a sufficient period of\ntime, so the interrogation should have “cease[d]” before he\nmade his inculpatory statements. Id., at 474; see Mosley,\n423 U. S., at 103 (police must “ ‘scrupulously hono[r]’ ” this\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)              9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“critical safeguard” when the accused invokes his or her\n“ ‘right to cut off questioning’ ” (quoting Miranda, supra, at\n474, 479)).\n    This argument is unpersuasive. In the context of invok\ning the Miranda right to counsel, the Court in Davis v.\nUnited States, 512 U. S. 452, 459 (1994), held that a sus\npect must do so “unambiguously.” If an accused makes a\nstatement concerning the right to counsel “that is ambigu\nous or equivocal” or makes no statement, the police are not\nrequired to end the interrogation, ibid., or ask questions to\nclarify whether the accused wants to invoke his or her\nMiranda rights, 512 U. S., at 461–462.\n    The Court has not yet stated whether an invocation of\nthe right to remain silent can be ambiguous or equivocal,\nbut there is no principled reason to adopt different stan\ndards for determining when an accused has invoked the\nMiranda right to remain silent and the Miranda right to\ncounsel at issue in Davis. See, e.g., Solem v. Stumes, 465\nU. S. 638, 648 (1984) (“[M]uch of the logic and language of\n[Mosley],” which discussed the Miranda right to remain\nsilent, “could be applied to the invocation of the [Miranda\nright to counsel]”). Both protect the privilege against\ncompulsory self-incrimination, Miranda, supra, at 467–\n473, by requiring an interrogation to cease when either\nright is invoked, Mosley, supra, at 103 (citing Miranda,\nsupra, at 474); Fare v. Michael C., 442 U. S. 707, 719\n(1979).\n    There is good reason to require an accused who wants to\ninvoke his or her right to remain silent to do so unambigu\nously. A requirement of an unambiguous invocation of\nMiranda rights results in an objective inquiry that\n“avoid[s] difficulties of proof and . . . provide[s] guidance to\nofficers” on how to proceed in the face of ambiguity. Davis,\n512 U. S., at 458–459. If an ambiguous act, omission, or\nstatement could require police to end the interrogation,\npolice would be required to make difficult decisions about\n10                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nan accused’s unclear intent and face the consequence of\nsuppression “if they guess wrong.” Id., at 461. Suppres\nsion of a voluntary confession in these circumstances\nwould place a significant burden on society’s interest in\nprosecuting criminal activity. See id., at 459–461; Moran\nv. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 427 (1986). Treating an am\nbiguous or equivocal act, omission, or statement as an\ninvocation of Miranda rights “might add marginally to\nMiranda’s goal of dispelling the compulsion inherent in\ncustodial interrogation.” Burbine, 475 U. S., at 425. But\n“as Miranda holds, full comprehension of the rights to\nremain silent and request an attorney are sufficient to\ndispel whatever coercion is inherent in the interrogation\nprocess.” Id., at 427; see Davis, supra, at 460.\n  Thompkins did not say that he wanted to remain silent\nor that he did not want to talk with the police. Had he\nmade either of these simple, unambiguous statements, he\nwould have invoked his “ ‘right to cut off questioning.’ ”\nMosley, supra, at 103 (quoting Miranda, supra, at 474).\nHere he did neither, so he did not invoke his right to re\nmain silent.\n                              B\n   We next consider whether Thompkins waived his right\nto remain silent. Even absent the accused’s invocation of\nthe right to remain silent, the accused’s statement during\na custodial interrogation is inadmissible at trial unless the\nprosecution can establish that the accused “in fact know\ningly and voluntarily waived [Miranda] rights” when\nmaking the statement. Butler, 441 U. S., at 373. The\nwaiver inquiry “has two distinct dimensions”: waiver must\nbe “voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free\nand deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion,\nor deception,” and “made with a full awareness of both the\nnature of the right being abandoned and the consequences\nof the decision to abandon it.” Burbine, supra, at 421.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Some language in Miranda could be read to indicate\nthat waivers are difficult to establish absent an explicit\nwritten waiver or a formal, express oral statement.\nMiranda said “a valid waiver will not be presumed simply\nfrom the silence of the accused after warnings are given or\nsimply from the fact that a confession was in fact eventu\nally obtained.” 384 U. S., at 475; see id., at 470 (“No effec\ntive waiver . . . can be recognized unless specifically made\nafter the [Miranda] warnings . . . have been given”). In\naddition, the Miranda Court stated that “a heavy burden\nrests on the government to demonstrate that the defen\ndant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege\nagainst self-incrimination and his right to retained or\nappointed counsel.” Id., at 475.\n   The course of decisions since Miranda, informed by the\napplication of Miranda warnings in the whole course of\nlaw enforcement, demonstrates that waivers can be estab\nlished even absent formal or express statements of waiver\nthat would be expected in, say, a judicial hearing to de\ntermine if a guilty plea has been properly entered. Cf.\nFed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11. The main purpose of Miranda is\nto ensure that an accused is advised of and understands\nthe right to remain silent and the right to counsel. See\nDavis, supra, at 460; Burbine, supra, at 427. Thus, “[i]f\nanything, our subsequent cases have reduced the impact\nof the Miranda rule on legitimate law enforcement while\nreaffirming the decision’s core ruling that unwarned\nstatements may not be used as evidence in the prosecu\ntion’s case in chief.” Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S.\n428, 443–444 (2000).\n   One of the first cases to decide the meaning and import\nof Miranda with respect to the question of waiver was\nNorth Carolina v. Butler. The Butler Court, after discuss\ning some of the problems created by the language in\nMiranda, established certain important propositions.\nButler interpreted the Miranda language concerning the\n12                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“heavy burden” to show waiver, 384 U. S., at 475, in ac\ncord with usual principles of determining waiver, which\ncan include waiver implied from all the circumstances.\nSee Butler, supra, at 373, 376. And in a later case, the\nCourt stated that this “heavy burden” is not more than the\nburden to establish waiver by a preponderance of the\nevidence. Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U. S. 157, 168 (1986).\n  The prosecution therefore does not need to show that a\nwaiver of Miranda rights was express. An “implicit\nwaiver” of the “right to remain silent” is sufficient to admit\na suspect’s statement into evidence. Butler, supra, at 376.\nButler made clear that a waiver of Miranda rights may be\nimplied through “the defendant’s silence, coupled with an\nunderstanding of his rights and a course of conduct indi\ncating waiver.” 441 U. S., at 373. The Court in Butler\ntherefore “retreated” from the “language and tenor of the\nMiranda opinion,” which “suggested that the Court would\nrequire that a waiver . . . be ‘specifically made.’ ” Con\nnecticut v. Barrett, 479 U. S. 523, 531–532 (1987) (Bren\nnan, J., concurring in judgment).\n  If the State establishes that a Miranda warning was\ngiven and the accused made an uncoerced statement, this\nshowing, standing alone, is insufficient to demonstrate “a\nvalid waiver” of Miranda rights. Miranda, supra, at 475.\nThe prosecution must make the additional showing that\nthe accused understood these rights. See Colorado v.\nSpring, 479 U. S. 564, 573–575 (1987); Barrett, supra, at\n530; Burbine, supra, at 421–422. Cf. Tague v. Louisiana,\n444 U. S. 469, 469, 471 (1980) (per curiam) (no evidence\nthat accused understood his Miranda rights); Carnley v.\nCochran, 369 U. S. 506, 516 (1962) (government could not\nshow that accused “understandingly” waived his right to\ncounsel in light of “silent record”). Where the prosecution\nshows that a Miranda warning was given and that it was\nunderstood by the accused, an accused’s uncoerced state\nment establishes an implied waiver of the right to remain\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsilent.\n   Although Miranda imposes on the police a rule that is\nboth formalistic and practical when it prevents them from\ninterrogating suspects without first providing them with a\nMiranda warning, see Burbine, 475 U. S., at 427, it does\nnot impose a formalistic waiver procedure that a suspect\nmust follow to relinquish those rights. As a general\nproposition, the law can presume that an individual who,\nwith a full understanding of his or her rights, acts in a\nmanner inconsistent with their exercise has made a delib\nerate choice to relinquish the protection those rights af\nford. See, e.g., Butler, supra, at 372–376; Connelly, supra,\nat 169–170 (“There is obviously no reason to require more\nin the way of a ‘voluntariness’ inquiry in the Miranda\nwaiver context than in the [due process] confession con\ntext”). The Court’s cases have recognized that a waiver of\nMiranda rights need only meet the standard of Johnson v.\nZerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 464 (1938). See Butler, supra, at\n374–375; Miranda, supra, at 475–476 (applying Zerbst\nstandard of intentional relinquishment of a known right).\nAs Butler recognized, 441 U. S., at 375–376, Miranda\nrights can therefore be waived through means less formal\nthan a typical waiver on the record in a courtroom, cf. Fed.\nRule Crim. Proc. 11, given the practical constraints and\nnecessities of interrogation and the fact that Miranda’s\nmain protection lies in advising defendants of their rights,\nsee Davis, 512 U. S., at 460; Burbine, 475 U. S., at 427.\n   The record in this case shows that Thompkins waived\nhis right to remain silent. There is no basis in this case to\nconclude that he did not understand his rights; and on\nthese facts it follows that he chose not to invoke or rely on\nthose rights when he did speak. First, there is no conten\ntion that Thompkins did not understand his rights; and\nfrom this it follows that he knew what he gave up when he\nspoke. See id., at 421. There was more than enough\nevidence in the record to conclude that Thompkins under\n14               BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstood his Miranda rights. Thompkins received a written\ncopy of the Miranda warnings; Detective Helgert deter\nmined that Thompkins could read and understand Eng\nlish; and Thompkins was given time to read the warnings.\nThompkins, furthermore, read aloud the fifth warning,\nwhich stated that “you have the right to decide at any time\nbefore or during questioning to use your right to remain\nsilent and your right to talk with a lawyer while you are\nbeing questioned.” Brief for Petitioner 60 (capitalization\nomitted). He was thus aware that his right to remain\nsilent would not dissipate after a certain amount of time\nand that police would have to honor his right to be silent\nand his right to counsel during the whole course of inter\nrogation. Those rights, the warning made clear, could be\nasserted at any time. Helgert, moreover, read the warn\nings aloud.\n   Second, Thompkins’s answer to Detective Helgert’s\nquestion about whether Thompkins prayed to God for\nforgiveness for shooting the victim is a “course of conduct\nindicating waiver” of the right to remain silent. Butler,\nsupra, at 373. If Thompkins wanted to remain silent, he\ncould have said nothing in response to Helgert’s questions,\nor he could have unambiguously invoked his Miranda\nrights and ended the interrogation. The fact that Thomp\nkins made a statement about three hours after receiving a\nMiranda warning does not overcome the fact that he\nengaged in a course of conduct indicating waiver. Police\nare not required to rewarn suspects from time to time.\nThompkins’s answer to Helgert’s question about praying\nto God for forgiveness for shooting the victim was suffi\ncient to show a course of conduct indicating waiver. This\nis confirmed by the fact that before then Thompkins\nhad given sporadic answers to questions throughout the\ninterrogation.\n   Third, there is no evidence that Thompkins’s statement\nwas coerced. See Burbine, supra, at 421. Thompkins does\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot claim that police threatened or injured him during the\ninterrogation or that he was in any way fearful. The\ninterrogation was conducted in a standard-sized room in\nthe middle of the afternoon. It is true that apparently he\nwas in a straight-backed chair for three hours, but there is\nno authority for the proposition that an interrogation of\nthis length is inherently coercive. Indeed, even where\ninterrogations of greater duration were held to be im\nproper, they were accompanied, as this one was not, by\nother facts indicating coercion, such as an incapacitated\nand sedated suspect, sleep and food deprivation, and\nthreats. Cf. Connelly, 479 U. S., at 163–164, n. 1. The fact\nthat Helgert’s question referred to Thompkins’s religious\nbeliefs also did not render Thompkins’s statement invol\nuntary. “[T]he Fifth Amendment privilege is not con\ncerned ‘with moral and psychological pressures to confess\nemanating from sources other than official coercion.’ ” Id.,\nat 170 (quoting Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, 305\n(1985)). In these circumstances, Thompkins knowingly\nand voluntarily made a statement to police, so he waived\nhis right to remain silent.\n                             C\n  Thompkins next argues that, even if his answer to\nDetective Helgert could constitute a waiver of his right to\nremain silent, the police were not allowed to question him\nuntil they obtained a waiver first. Butler forecloses this\nargument. The Butler Court held that courts can infer a\nwaiver of Miranda rights “from the actions and words of\nthe person interrogated.” 441 U. S., at 373. This principle\nwould be inconsistent with a rule that requires a waiver at\nthe outset. The Butler Court thus rejected the rule pro\nposed by the Butler dissent, which would have “requir[ed]\nthe police to obtain an express waiver of [Miranda rights]\nbefore proceeding with interrogation.” Id., at 379 (Bren\nnan, J., dissenting). This holding also makes sense given\n16               BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat “the primary protection afforded suspects subject[ed]\nto custodial interrogation is the Miranda warnings them\nselves.” Davis, 512 U. S., at 460. The Miranda rule and\nits requirements are met if a suspect receives adequate\nMiranda warnings, understands them, and has an oppor\ntunity to invoke the rights before giving any answers or\nadmissions. Any waiver, express or implied, may be con\ntradicted by an invocation at any time. If the right to\ncounsel or the right to remain silent is invoked at any\npoint during questioning, further interrogation must\ncease.\n   Interrogation provides the suspect with additional\ninformation that can put his or her decision to waive, or\nnot to invoke, into perspective. As questioning commences\nand then continues, the suspect has the opportunity to\nconsider the choices he or she faces and to make a more\ninformed decision, either to insist on silence or to cooper\nate. When the suspect knows that Miranda rights can be\ninvoked at any time, he or she has the opportunity to\nreassess his or her immediate and long-term interests.\nCooperation with the police may result in more favorable\ntreatment for the suspect; the apprehension of accom\nplices; the prevention of continuing injury and fear; begin\nning steps towards relief or solace for the victims; and the\nbeginning of the suspect’s own return to the law and the\nsocial order it seeks to protect.\n   In order for an accused’s statement to be admissible at\ntrial, police must have given the accused a Miranda warn\ning. See Miranda, 384 U. S., at 471. If that condition is\nestablished, the court can proceed to consider whether\nthere has been an express or implied waiver of Miranda\nrights. Id., at 476. In making its ruling on the admissibil\nity of a statement made during custodial questioning, the\ntrial court, of course, considers whether there is evidence\nto support the conclusion that, from the whole course of\nquestioning, an express or implied waiver has been estab\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlished. Thus, after giving a Miranda warning, police may\ninterrogate a suspect who has neither invoked nor waived\nhis or her Miranda rights. On these premises, it fol-\nlows the police were not required to obtain a waiver of\nThompkins’s Miranda rights before commencing the\ninterrogation.\n                             D\n   In sum, a suspect who has received and understood the\nMiranda warnings, and has not invoked his Miranda\nrights, waives the right to remain silent by making an\nuncoerced statement to the police. Thompkins did not\ninvoke his right to remain silent and stop the questioning.\nUnderstanding his rights in full, he waived his right to\nremain silent by making a voluntary statement to the\npolice. The police, moreover, were not required to obtain a\nwaiver of Thompkins’s right to remain silent before inter\nrogating him. The state court’s decision rejecting Thomp\nkins’s Miranda claim was thus correct under de novo\nreview and therefore necessarily reasonable under the\nmore deferential AEDPA standard of review, 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(d). See Knowles, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11)\n(state court’s decision was correct under de novo review\nand not unreasonable under AEDPA).\n                             IV\n  The second issue in this case is whether Thompkins’s\ncounsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to re\nquest a limiting instruction regarding how the jury could\nconsider the outcome of Purifoy’s trial. To establish inef\nfective assistance of counsel, a defendant “must show both\ndeficient performance and prejudice.” Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 10) (citing Strickland, 466 U. S., at 687). To establish\nprejudice, a “defendant must show that there is a reason\nable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been dif\n18               BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nferent.” Strickland, 466 U. S., at 694. In assessing preju\ndice, courts “must consider the totality of the evidence\nbefore the judge or jury.” Id., at 695. The Court of Ap\npeals, however, neglected to take into account the other\nevidence presented against Thompkins.\n   The Court of Appeals determined that the state court\nwas unreasonable, 28 U. S. C. §2254(d), when it found that\nThompkins suffered no prejudice from failure of defense\ncounsel to request an instruction regarding Purifoy’s\nearlier acquittal of the murder and assault charges. The\nstate court had rejected Thompkins’s claim that he was\nprejudiced by evidence of Purifoy’s earlier conviction for\nfirearms offenses, noting that “the record does not disclose\nan attempt to argue that conviction for an improper pur\npose.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 80a. It is unclear what preju\ndice standard the state court applied. The Court of Ap\npeals ruled that the state court used the incorrect\nstandard for assessing prejudice under Strickland because\n“[q]uestions of the prosecution’s purpose or intent are\ncompletely irrelevant in analyzing whether an error re\nsulted in prejudice, which by definition concerns the er\nror’s effect upon the outcome.” 547 F. 3d, at 591–592\n(emphasis deleted).\n   Even if the state court used an incorrect legal standard,\nwe need not determine whether AEDPA’s deferential\nstandard of review, 28 U. S. C. §2254(d), applies in this\nsituation. Cf. Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 397–398\n(2000). That is because, even if AEDPA deference does not\napply, Thompkins cannot show prejudice under de novo\nreview, the more favorable standard of review for Thomp\nkins. Courts cannot grant writs of habeas corpus under\n§2254 by engaging only in de novo review when it is un\nclear whether AEDPA deference applies, §2254(d). In\nthose situations, courts must resolve whether AEDPA\ndeference applies, because if it does, a habeas petitioner\nmay not be entitled to a writ of habeas corpus under\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n§2254(d). Courts can, however, deny writs of habeas\ncorpus under §2254 by engaging in de novo review when it\nis unclear whether AEDPA deference applies, because a\nhabeas petitioner will not be entitled to a writ of habeas\ncorpus if his or her claim is rejected on de novo review, see\n§2254(a).\n  It seems doubtful that failure to request the instruction\nabout the earlier acquittal or conviction was deficient\nrepresentation; but on the assumption that it was, on this\nrecord Thompkins cannot show prejudice. The record\nestablishes that it was not reasonably likely that the\ninstruction would have made any difference in light of all\nthe other evidence of guilt. The surviving victim, Freder\nick France, identified Thompkins as the shooter, and the\nidentification was supported by a photograph taken from a\nsurveillance camera. Thompkins’s friend Omar Stephens\ntestified that Thompkins confessed to him during a phone\nconversation, and the details of that confession were cor\nroborated by evidence that Thompkins stripped the van\nand abandoned it after the shooting. The jury, moreover,\nwas capable of assessing Purifoy’s credibility, as it was\ninstructed to do. The jury in Thompkins’s case could have\nconcluded that the earlier jury in Purifoy’s case made a\nmistake, or alternatively, that Purifoy was not in fact\nguilty of the crime for which he had been charged. There\nwas ample evidence in the record to support Thompkins’s\nguilt under either theory, and his jury was instructed to\nweigh all of the evidence in determining whether there\nwas guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Under our de novo\nreview of this record, Thompkins cannot show prejudice.\n                     *   *     *\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed,\nand the case is remanded with instructions to deny the\npetition.\n                                        It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

VAN \n\n           CHESTER THOMPKINS \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [June 1, 2010]\n\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS,\nJUSTICE GINSBURG, and JUSTICE BREYER join, dissenting.\n   The Court concludes today that a criminal suspect\nwaives his right to remain silent if, after sitting tacit and\nuncommunicative through nearly three hours of police\ninterrogation, he utters a few one-word responses. The\nCourt also concludes that a suspect who wishes to guard\nhis right to remain silent against such a finding of\n“waiver” must, counterintuitively, speak—and must do so\nwith sufficient precision to satisfy a clear-statement rule\nthat construes ambiguity in favor of the police. Both\npropositions mark a substantial retreat from the protec­\ntion against compelled self-incrimination that Miranda v.\nArizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), has long provided during\ncustodial interrogation. The broad rules the Court an­\nnounces today are also troubling because they are unnec­\nessary to decide this case, which is governed by the defer­\nential standard of review set forth in the Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28\nU. S. C. §2254(d). Because I believe Thompkins is entitled\nto relief under AEDPA on the ground that his statements\nwere admitted at trial without the prosecution having\ncarried its burden to show that he waived his right to\nremain silent; because longstanding principles of judicial\nrestraint counsel leaving for another day the questions of\n2                 BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nlaw the Court reaches out to decide; and because the\nCourt’s answers to those questions do not result from a\nfaithful application of our prior decisions, I respectfully\ndissent.\n                              I\n   We granted certiorari to review the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which held that\nThompkins was entitled to habeas relief under both\nMiranda and Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668\n(1984). 547 F. 3d 572 (2008). As to the Miranda claims,\nThompkins argues first that through his conduct during\nthe 3-hour custodial interrogation he effectively invoked\nhis right to remain silent, requiring police to cut off ques­\ntioning in accordance with Miranda and Michigan v.\nMosley, 423 U. S. 96 (1975). Thompkins also contends his\nstatements were in any case inadmissible because the\nprosecution failed to meet its heavy burden under\nMiranda of proving that he knowingly and intelligently\nwaived his right to remain silent. The Sixth Circuit\nagreed with Thompkins as to waiver and declined to reach\nthe question of invocation. 547 F. 3d, at 583–584, n. 4. In\nmy view, even if Thompkins cannot prevail on his invoca­\ntion claim under AEDPA, he is entitled to relief as to\nwaiver. Because I would affirm the judgment of the Sixth\nCircuit on that ground, I would not reach Thompkins’\nclaim that he received constitutionally ineffective assis­\ntance of counsel.\n   The strength of Thompkins’ Miranda claims depends in\nlarge part on the circumstances of the 3-hour interroga­\ntion, at the end of which he made inculpatory statements\nlater introduced at trial. The Court’s opinion downplays\nrecord evidence that Thompkins remained almost com­\npletely silent and unresponsive throughout that session.\nOne of the interrogating officers, Detective Helgert, testi­\nfied that although Thompkins was administered Miranda\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwarnings, the last of which he read aloud, Thompkins\nexpressly declined to sign a written acknowledgment that\nhe had been advised of and understood his rights. There\nis conflicting evidence in the record about whether\nThompkins ever verbally confirmed understanding his\nrights.1 The record contains no indication that the officers\nsought or obtained an express waiver.\n   As to the interrogation itself, Helgert candidly charac­\nterized it as “very, very one-sided” and “nearly a mono­\nlogue.” App. 10a, 17a. Thompkins was “[p]eculiar,”\n“[s]ullen,” and “[g]enerally quiet.” Id., at 149a. Helgert\nand his partner “did most of the talking,” as Thompkins\nwas “not verbally communicative” and “[l]argely” re­\nmained silent. Id., at 149a, 17a, 19a. To the extent\nThompkins gave any response, his answers consisted of “a\nword or two. A ‘yeah,’ or a ‘no,’ or ‘I don’t know.’ . . . And\nsometimes . . . he simply sat down . . . with [his] head in\n[his] hands looking down. Sometimes . . . he would look up\nand make eye-contact would be the only response.” Id., at\n23a–24a. After proceeding in this fashion for approxi­\nmately 2 hours and 45 minutes, Helgert asked Thompkins\nthree questions relating to his faith in God. The prosecu­\ntion relied at trial on Thompkins’ one-word answers of\n“yes.” See id., at 10a–11a.\n   Thompkins’ nonresponsiveness is particularly striking\nin the context of the officers’ interview strategy, later\n——————\n  1 At the suppression hearing, Detective Helgert testified that after\nreading Thompkins the warnings, “I believe I asked him if he under­\nstood the Rights, and I think I got a verbal answer to that as a ‘yes.’ ”\nApp. 9a. In denying the motion to suppress, the trial court relied on\nthat factual premise. Id., at 26a. In his later testimony at trial, Hel­\ngert remembered the encounter differently. Asked whether Thompkins\n“indicate[d] that he understood [the warnings]” after they had been\nread, Helgert stated “I don’t know that I orally asked him that ques­\ntion.” Id., at 148a. Nevertheless, the Michigan Court of Appeals stated\nthat Thompkins verbally acknowledged understanding his rights. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 75a.\n4                 BERGHUIS v.

Yet, Helgert confirmed that the “only thing\n[Thompkins said] relative to his involvement [in the shoot­\ning]” occurred near the end of the interview—i.e., in re­\nsponse to the questions about God. Id., at 10a–11a (em­\nphasis added). The only other responses Helgert could\nremember Thompkins giving were that “ ‘[h]e didn’t want\na peppermint’ ” and “ ‘the chair that he was sitting in was\nhard.’ ” Id., at 152a. Nevertheless, the Michigan court\nconcluded on this record that Thompkins had not invoked\nhis right to remain silent because “he continued to talk\nwith the officer, albeit sporadically,” and that he voluntar­\nily waived that right. App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a.\n   Thompkins’ federal habeas petition is governed by\nAEDPA, under which a federal court may not grant the\nwrit unless the state court’s adjudication of the merits of\nthe claim at issue “was contrary to, or involved an unrea­\nsonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United States,”\nor “was based on an unreasonable determination of the\nfacts in light of the evidence presented in the State court\nproceeding.” §§2254(d)(1), (2).\n   The relevant clearly established federal law for purposes\nof §2254(d)(1) begins with our landmark Miranda decision,\nwhich “g[a]ve force to the Constitution’s protection against\ncompelled self-incrimination” by establishing “ ‘certain\nprocedural safeguards that require police to advise crimi­\nnal suspects of their rights under the Fifth and Four­\nteenth Amendments before commencing custodial interro­\ngation,’ ” Florida v. Powell, 559 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 7–8) (quoting Duckworth v. Eagan, 492 U. S.\n195, 201 (1989)). Miranda prescribed the now-familiar\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

Miranda and our subse­\nquent cases also require police to “respect the accused’s\ndecision to exercise the rights outlined in the warnings.”\nMoran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 420 (1986). “If [an]\nindividual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or\nduring questioning, that he wishes to remain silent” or if\nhe “states that he wants an attorney,” the interrogation\n“must cease.” 384 U. S., at 473–474.\n  Even when warnings have been administered and a\nsuspect has not affirmatively invoked his rights, state­\nments made in custodial interrogation may not be admit­\nted as part of the prosecution’s case in chief “unless and\nuntil” the prosecution demonstrates that an individual\n“knowingly and intelligently waive[d] [his] rights.” Id., at\n479; accord, ante, at 10. “[A] heavy burden rests on the\ngovernment to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly\nand intelligently waived his privilege against self­\nincrimination and his right to retained or appointed coun­\nsel.” Miranda, 384 U. S., at 475. The government must\nsatisfy the “high standar[d] of proof for the waiver of\nconstitutional rights [set forth in] Johnson v. Zerbst, 304\nU. S. 458 (1938).” Ibid.\n  The question whether a suspect has validly waived his\nright is “entirely distinct” as a matter of law from whether\nhe invoked that right. Smith v. Illinois, 469 U. S. 91, 98\n(1984) (per curiam). The questions are related, however,\nin terms of the practical effect on the exercise of a sus­\npect’s rights. A suspect may at any time revoke his prior\nwaiver of rights—or, closer to the facts of this case, guard\nagainst the possibility of a future finding that he implicitly\nwaived his rights—by invoking the rights and thereby\nrequiring the police to cease questioning. Accord, ante, at\n16.\n6                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n                             II \n\n                             A\n\n   Like the Sixth Circuit, I begin with the question\nwhether Thompkins waived his right to remain silent.\nEven if Thompkins did not invoke that right, he is entitled\nto relief because Michigan did not satisfy its burden of\nestablishing waiver.\n   Miranda’s discussion of the prosecution’s burden in\nproving waiver speaks with particular clarity to the facts\nof this case and therefore merits reproducing at length:\n       “If [an] interrogation continues without the pres­\n    ence of an attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy\n    burden rests on the government to demonstrate that\n    the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his\n    privilege against self-incrimination and his right to\n    retained or appointed counsel. . . . Since the State is\n    responsible for establishing the isolated circumstances\n    under which [an] interrogation takes place and has\n    the only means of making available corroborated evi­\n    dence of warnings given during incommunicado inter­\n    rogation, the burden is rightly on its shoulders.\n       “An express statement that the individual is willing\n    to make a statement and does not want an attorney\n    followed closely by a statement could constitute a\n    waiver. But a valid waiver will not be presumed sim­\n    ply from the silence of the accused after warnings are\n    given or simply from the fact that a confession was in\n    fact eventually obtained.” 384 U. S., at 475.\n  Miranda went further in describing the facts likely\nto satisfy the prosecution’s burden of establishing the ad­\nmissibility of statements obtained after a lengthy\ninterrogation:\n      “Whatever the testimony of the authorities as to\n    waiver of rights by an accused, the fact of lengthy in­\n    terrogation or incommunicado incarceration before a\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             7\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n    statement is made is strong evidence that the accused\n    did not validly waive his rights. In these circum­\n    stances the fact that the individual eventually made a\n    statement is consistent with the conclusion that the\n    compelling influence of the interrogation finally forced\n    him to do so. It is inconsistent with any notion of a\n    voluntary relinquishment of the privilege.” Id., at\n    476.\n  This Court’s decisions subsequent to Miranda have\nemphasized the prosecution’s “heavy burden” in proving\nwaiver. See, e.g., Tague v. Louisiana, 444 U. S. 469, 470–\n471 (1980) (per curiam); Fare v. Michael C., 442 U. S. 707,\n724 (1979). We have also reaffirmed that a court may not\npresume waiver from a suspect’s silence or from the mere\nfact that a confession was eventually obtained. See North\nCarolina v. Butler, 441 U. S. 369, 373 (1979).\n  Even in concluding that Miranda does not invariably\nrequire an express waiver of the right to silence or the\nright to counsel, this Court in Butler made clear that the\nprosecution bears a substantial burden in establishing an\nimplied waiver. The Federal Bureau of Investigation had\nobtained statements after advising Butler of his rights and\nconfirming that he understood them. When presented\nwith a written waiver-of-rights form, Butler told the\nagents, “ ‘I will talk to you but I am not signing any form.’ ”\n441 U. S., at 371. He then made inculpatory statements,\nwhich he later sought to suppress on the ground that he\nhad not expressly waived his right to counsel.\n  Although this Court reversed the state-court judgment\nconcluding that the statements were inadmissible, we\nquoted at length portions of the Miranda opinion repro­\nduced above. We cautioned that even an “express written\nor oral statement of waiver of the right to remain silent or\nof the right to counsel” is not “inevitably . . . sufficient to\nestablish waiver,” emphasizing that “[t]he question is . . .\n8                    BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwhether the defendant in fact knowingly and voluntarily\nwaived the rights delineated in the Miranda case.” 441\nU. S., at 373. Miranda, we observed, “unequivocally said\n. . . mere silence is not enough.” 441 U. S., at 373. While\nwe stopped short in Butler of announcing a per se rule that\n“the defendant’s silence, coupled with an understanding of\nhis rights and a course of conduct indicating waiver, may\nnever support a conclusion that a defendant has waived\nhis rights,” we reiterated that “courts must presume that a\ndefendant did not waive his rights; the prosecution’s bur­\nden is great.” Ibid.2\n    Rarely do this Court’s precedents provide clearly estab­\nlished law so closely on point with the facts of a particular\ncase. Together, Miranda and Butler establish that a court\n“must presume that a defendant did not waive his\nright[s]”; the prosecution bears a “heavy burden” in at­\ntempting to demonstrate waiver; the fact of a “lengthy\ninterrogation” prior to obtaining statements is “strong\nevidence” against a finding of valid waiver; “mere silence”\nin response to questioning is “not enough”; and waiver\nmay not be presumed “simply from the fact that a confes­\nsion was in fact eventually obtained.” Miranda, supra, at\n475–476; Butler, supra, at 372–373.3\n——————\n    2 TheCourt cites Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U. S. 157, 168 (1986), for\nthe proposition that the prosecution’s “ ‘heavy burden’ ” under Miranda\n“is not more than the burden to establish waiver by a preponderance of\nthe evidence.” Ante, at 12. Connelly did reject a clear and convincing\nevidence standard of proof in favor of a preponderance burden. But\nnothing in Connelly displaced the core presumption against finding a\nwaiver of rights, and we have subsequently relied on Miranda’s charac­\nterization of the prosecution’s burden as “heavy.” See Arizona v.\nRoberson, 486 U. S. 675, 680 (1988).\n   3 Likely reflecting the great weight of the prosecution’s burden in\n\nproving implied waiver, many contemporary police training resources\ninstruct officers to obtain a waiver of rights prior to proceeding at all\nwith an interrogation. See, e.g., F. Inbau, J. Reid, J. Buckley, & B.\nJayne, Criminal Interrogation and Confessions 491 (4th ed. 2004)\n                    Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                   9\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n  It is undisputed here that Thompkins never expressly\nwaived his right to remain silent. His refusal to sign even\nan acknowledgment that he understood his Miranda\nrights evinces, if anything, an intent not to waive those\nrights. Cf. United States v. Plugh, 576 F. 3d 135, 142\n(CA2 2009) (suspect’s refusal to sign waiver-of-rights form\n“constituted an unequivocally negative answer to the\nquestion . . . whether he was willing to waive his rights”).\nThat Thompkins did not make the inculpatory statements\nat issue until after approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes\nof interrogation serves as “strong evidence” against\nwaiver. Miranda and Butler expressly preclude the possi­\nbility that the inculpatory statements themselves are\nsufficient to establish waiver.\n  In these circumstances, Thompkins’ “actions and words”\npreceding the inculpatory statements simply do not evi­\ndence a “course of conduct indicating waiver” sufficient to\ncarry the prosecution’s burden. See Butler, supra, at 373.4\n——————\n(hereinafter Inbau) (“Once [a] waiver is given, the police may proceed\nwith the interrogation”); D. Zulawski & D. Wicklander, Practical\nAspects of Interview and Interrogation 55 (2d ed. 2002) (“Only upon the\nwaiver of th[e] [Miranda] rights by the suspect can an interrogation\noccur”); see also Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense\nLawyers et al. as Amici Curiae 11–12 (hereinafter NACDL brief)\n(collecting authorities).\n  4 Although such decisions are not controlling under AEDPA, it is\n\nnotable that lower courts have similarly required a showing of words or\nconduct beyond inculpatory statements. See, e.g., United States v.\nWallace, 848 F. 2d 1464, 1475 (CA9 1988) (no implied waiver when\nwarned suspect “maintained her silence for . . . perhap[s] as many as\nten minutes” before answering a question); McDonald v. Lucas, 677\nF. 2d 518, 521–522 (CA5 1982) (no implied waiver when defendant\nrefused to sign waiver and there was “no evidence of words or actions\nimplying a waiver, except the [inculpatory] statement”). Generally,\ncourts have found implied waiver when a warned suspect has made\nincriminating statements “as part of a steady stream of speech or as\npart of a back-and-forth conversation with the police,” or when a\nwarned suspect who previously invoked his right “spontaneously\nrecommences the dialogue with his interviewers.” Bui v. DiPaolo, 170\n10                   BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nAlthough the Michigan court stated that Thompkins\n“sporadically” participated in the interview, App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 75a, that court’s opinion and the record before us\nare silent as to the subject matter or context of even a\nsingle question to which Thompkins purportedly re­\nsponded, other than the exchange about God and the\nstatements respecting the peppermint and the chair.\nUnlike in Butler, Thompkins made no initial declaration\nakin to “I will talk to you.” See also 547 F. 3d, at 586–587\n(case below) (noting that the case might be different if the\nrecord showed Thompkins had responded affirmatively to\nan invitation to tell his side of the story or described any\nparticular question that Thompkins answered). Indeed,\nMichigan and the United States concede that no waiver\noccurred in this case until Thompkins responded “yes” to\nthe questions about God. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7, 30. I\nbelieve it is objectively unreasonable under our clearly\nestablished precedents to conclude the prosecution met its\n“heavy burden” of proof on a record consisting of three one­\nword answers, following 2 hours and 45 minutes of silence\npunctuated by a few largely nonverbal responses to uni­\ndentified questions.\n                           B\n  Perhaps because our prior Miranda precedents so\nclearly favor Thompkins, the Court today goes beyond\nAEDPA’s deferential standard of review and announces a\nnew general principle of law. Any new rule, it must be\nemphasized, is unnecessary to the disposition of this case.\n\n——————\nF. 3d 232, 240 (CA1 1999) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also United States v.

Wold Engineering, P. C., 467 U. S. 138, 157\n(1984). Consistent with that rule, we have frequently\ndeclined to address questions beyond what is necessary to\nresolve a case under AEDPA. See, e.g., Tyler v. Cain, 533\nU. S. 656, 667–668 (2001) (declining to address question\nwhere any statement by this Court would be “dictum” in\nlight of AEDPA’s statutory constraints on habeas review);\ncf. Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 522 (2003) (noting that\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362 (2000), “made no new\nlaw” because the “case was before us on habeas review”).\nNo necessity exists to justify the Court’s broad announce­\nment today.\n   The Court concludes that when Miranda warnings have\nbeen given and understood, “an accused’s uncoerced\nstatement establishes an implied waiver of the right to\nremain silent.” Ante, at 12–13. More broadly still, the\nCourt states that, “[a]s a general proposition, the law can\npresume that an individual who, with a full understanding\nof his or her rights, acts in a manner inconsistent with\ntheir exercise has made a deliberate choice to relinquish\nthe protection those rights afford.” Ante, at 13.\n   These principles flatly contradict our longstanding\nviews that “a valid waiver will not be presumed . . . simply\nfrom the fact that a confession was in fact eventually\nobtained,” Miranda, 384 U. S., at 475, and that “[t]he\ncourts must presume that a defendant did not waive his\nrights,” Butler, 441 U. S., at 373. Indeed, we have in the\npast summarily reversed a state-court decision that in­\nverted Miranda’s antiwaiver presumption, characterizing\n12                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthe error as “readily apparent.” Tague, 444 U. S., at 470–\n471. At best, the Court today creates an unworkable and\nconflicting set of presumptions that will undermine\nMiranda’s goal of providing “concrete constitutional guide­\nlines for law enforcement agencies and courts to follow,”\n384 U. S., at 442. At worst, it overrules sub silentio an\nessential aspect of the protections Miranda has long pro­\nvided for the constitutional guarantee against self­\nincrimination.\n   The Court’s conclusion that Thompkins’ inculpatory\nstatements were sufficient to establish an implied waiver,\nante, at 14, finds no support in Butler. Butler itself distin­\nguished between a sufficient “course of conduct” and in­\nculpatory statements, reiterating Miranda’s admonition\nthat “ ‘a valid waiver will not be presumed simply from . . .\nthe fact that a confession was in fact eventually ob­\ntained.’ ” Butler, supra, at 373 (quoting Miranda, supra,\nat 475). Michigan suggests Butler’s silence “ ‘when ad­\nvised of his right to the assistance of a lawyer,’ ” combined\nwith our remand for the state court to apply the implied­\nwaiver standard, shows that silence followed by state­\nments can be a “ ‘course of conduct.’ ” Brief for Petitioner\n26 (quoting Butler, supra, at 371). But the evidence of\nimplied waiver in Butler was worlds apart from the evi­\ndence in this case, because Butler unequivocally said “I\nwill talk to you” after having been read Miranda warn­\nings. Thompkins, of course, made no such statement.\n   The Court also relies heavily on Burbine in characteriz­\ning the scope of the prosecution’s burden in proving\nwaiver. Consistent with Burbine, the Court observes, the\nprosecution must prove that waiver was “ ‘voluntary in the\nsense that it was the product of a free and deliberate\nchoice rather than intimidation’ ” and “ ‘made with a full\nawareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned\nand the consequences of the decision to abandon it.’ ” Ante,\nat 10 (quoting 475 U. S., at 421). I agree with the Court’s\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nstatement, so far as it goes. What it omits, however, is\nthat the prosecution also bears an antecedent burden of\nshowing there was, in fact, either an express waiver or a\n“course of conduct” sufficiently clear to support a finding of\nimplied waiver. Nothing in Burbine even hints at remov­\ning that obligation. The question in that case, rather, was\nwhether a suspect’s multiple express waivers of his rights\nwere invalid because police “misinformed an inquiring\nattorney about their plans concerning the suspect or be­\ncause they failed to inform the suspect of the attorney’s\nefforts to reach him.” Id., at 420; see also Colorado v.\nSpring, 479 U. S. 564, 573 (1987). The Court’s analysis in\nBurbine was predicated on the existence of waiver-in-fact.\n  Today’s dilution of the prosecution’s burden of proof to\nthe bare fact that a suspect made inculpatory statements\nafter Miranda warnings were given and understood takes\nan unprecedented step away from the “high standards of\nproof for the waiver of constitutional rights” this Court has\nlong demanded. Miranda, supra, at 475; cf. Brewer v.\nWilliams, 430 U. S. 387, 404 (1977) (“[C]ourts indulge in\nevery reasonable presumption against waiver”); Zerbst,\n304 U. S., at 464. When waiver is to be inferred during a\ncustodial interrogation, there are sound reasons to require\nevidence beyond inculpatory statements themselves.\nMiranda and our subsequent cases are premised on the\nidea that custodial interrogation is inherently coercive.\nSee 384 U. S., at 455 (“Even without employing brutality,\nthe ‘third degree’ or [other] specific strategems . . . the\nvery fact of custodial interrogation exacts a heavy toll on\nindividual liberty and trades on the weakness of individu­\nals”); Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 435 (2000).\nRequiring proof of a course of conduct beyond the inculpa­\ntory statements themselves is critical to ensuring that\nthose statements are voluntary admissions and not the\ndubious product of an overborne will.\n  Today’s decision thus ignores the important interests\n14                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nMiranda safeguards. The underlying constitutional guar­\nantee against self-incrimination reflects “many of our\nfundamental values and most noble aspirations,” our\nsociety’s “preference for an accusatorial rather than an\ninquisitorial system of criminal justice”; a “fear that self­\nincriminating statements will be elicited by inhumane\ntreatment and abuses” and a resulting “distrust of self­\ndeprecatory statements”; and a realization that while the\nprivilege is “sometimes a shelter to the guilty, [it] is often\na protection to the innocent.” Withrow v. Williams, 507\nU. S. 680, 692 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nFor these reasons, we have observed, a criminal law sys­\ntem “which comes to depend on the ‘confession’ will, in the\nlong run, be less reliable and more subject to abuses than\na system relying on independent investigation.” Ibid.\n(some internal quotation marks omitted). “By bracing\nagainst ‘the possibility of unreliable statements in every\ninstance of in-custody interrogation,’ ” Miranda’s prophy­\nlactic rules serve to “ ‘protect the fairness of the trial it­\nself.’ ” 507 U. S., at 692 (quoting Johnson v. New Jersey,\n384 U. S. 719, 730 (1966); Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412\nU. S. 218, 240 (1973)). Today’s decision bodes poorly for\nthe fundamental principles that Miranda protects.\n                              III\n   Thompkins separately argues that his conduct during\nthe interrogation invoked his right to remain silent, re­\nquiring police to terminate questioning. Like the Sixth\nCircuit, I would not reach this question because Thomp­\nkins is in any case entitled to relief as to waiver. But even\nif Thompkins would not prevail on his invocation claim\nunder AEDPA’s deferential standard of review, I cannot\nagree with the Court’s much broader ruling that a suspect\nmust clearly invoke his right to silence by speaking.\nTaken together with the Court’s reformulation of the\nprosecution’s burden of proof as to waiver, today’s novel\n                      Cite as: 560 U.

Such a result bears little sem­\nblance to the “fully effective” prophylaxis, 384 U. S., at\n444, that Miranda requires.\n                              A\n   Thompkins’ claim for relief under AEDPA rests on the\nclearly established federal law of Miranda and Mosley. In\nMiranda, the Court concluded that “[i]f [an] individual\nindicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during\nquestioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interro­\ngation must cease. . . . [A]ny statement taken after the\nperson invokes his privilege cannot be other than the\nproduct of compulsion, subtle or otherwise.” 384 U. S., at\n473–474. In Mosley, the Court said that a “critical safe­\nguard” of the right to remain silent is a suspect’s “ ‘right to\ncut off questioning.’ ” 423 U. S., at 103 (quoting Miranda,\nsupra, at 474). Thus, “the admissibility of statements\nobtained after the person in custody has decided to remain\nsilent depends under Miranda on whether his ‘right to cut\noff questioning’ was ‘scrupulously honored.’ ” 423 U. S., at\n104.5\n   Thompkins contends that in refusing to respond to\nquestions he effectively invoked his right to remain silent,\n——————\n  5 In holding that Mosley’s right had been “ ‘scrupulously honored,’ ”\n\nthe Court observed that he was properly advised of his rights and\nindicated his understanding in writing; that police “immediately\nceased” interrogation when Mosley stated he did not want to discuss\nthe crime and allowed an “interval of more than two hours” to pass\nbefore reapproaching Mosley “at another location about an unrelated\n[crime]”; and that Mosley was readministered “full and complete\nMiranda warnings at the outset of the second interrogation” and had a\n“full and fair opportunity to exercise th[o]se options.” 423 U.

THOMPKINS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nsuch that police were required to terminate the interroga­\ntion prior to his inculpatory statements. In Michigan’s\nview, Thompkins cannot prevail under AEDPA because\nthis Court’s precedents have not previously established\nwhether a suspect’s ambiguous statements or actions\nrequire the police to stop questioning. We have held that\na suspect who has “ ‘invoked his right to have counsel\npresent . . . is not subject to further interrogation by the\nauthorities until counsel has been made available to him,\nunless [he] initiates further communication, exchanges, or\nconversations with the police.’ ” Maryland v. Shatzer, 559\nU. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5) (quoting Edwards v.\nArizona, 451 U. S. 477, 484–485 (1981)). Notwithstanding\nMiranda’s statement that “there can be no questioning” if\na suspect “indicates in any manner . . . that he wishes to\nconsult with an attorney,” 384 U. S., at 444–445, the Court\nin Davis v. United States, 512 U. S. 452, 461 (1994) estab­\nlished a clear-statement rule for invoking the right to\ncounsel. After a suspect has knowingly and voluntarily\nwaived his Miranda rights, Davis held, police may con­\ntinue questioning “until and unless the suspect clearly\nrequests an attorney.” 512 U. S., at 461 (emphasis added).\n   Because this Court has never decided whether Davis’\nclear-statement rule applies to an invocation of the right\nto silence, Michigan contends, there was no clearly estab­\nlished federal law prohibiting the state court from requir­\ning an unambiguous invocation. That the state court’s\ndecision was not objectively unreasonable is confirmed, in\nMichigan’s view, by the number of federal Courts of Ap­\npeals to have applied Davis to invocation of the right to\nsilence. Brief for Petitioner 44.\n   Under AEDPA’s deferential standard of review, it is\nindeed difficult to conclude that the state court’s applica­\ntion of our precedents was objectively unreasonable.\nAlthough the duration and consistency of Thompkins’\nrefusal to answer questions throughout the 3-hour inter­\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

Because Thompkins\nneither said “he wanted to remain silent” nor said “he did\nnot want to talk with the police,” the Court concludes, he\ndid not clearly invoke his right to silence. Ante, at 8–10.6\n   I disagree with this novel application of Davis. Neither\nthe rationale nor holding of that case compels today’s\nresult. Davis involved the right to counsel, not the right to\nsilence. The Court in Davis reasoned that extending\nEdwards’ “rigid” prophylactic rule to ambiguous requests\nfor a lawyer would transform Miranda into a “ ‘wholly\nirrational obstacl[e] to legitimate police investigative\nactivity’ ” by “needlessly prevent[ing] the police from ques­\ntioning a suspect in the absence of counsel even if [he] did\nnot wish to have a lawyer present.” Davis, supra, at 460.\nBut Miranda itself “distinguished between the procedural\nsafeguards triggered by a request to remain silent and a\nrequest for an attorney.” Mosley, supra, at 104, n. 10;\naccord, Edwards, supra, at 485. Mosley upheld the admis­\nsion of statements when police immediately stopped inter­\nrogating a suspect who invoked his right to silence, but\nreapproached him after a 2-hour delay and obtained in­\n——————\n  6 The Court also ignores a second available avenue to avoid reaching\n\nthe constitutional question. Because the Sixth Circuit declined to\ndecide Thompkins’ invocation claim, a remand would permit the lower\ncourt to address the question in the first instance. Cf. Cutter v. Wilkin\nson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005).\n18                   BERGHUIS v.

The different\neffects of invoking the rights are consistent with distinct\nstandards for invocation. To the extent Mosley contem­\nplates a more flexible form of prophylaxis than Edwards—\nand, in particular, does not categorically bar police from\nreapproaching a suspect who has invoked his right to\nremain silent—Davis’ concern about “ ‘wholly irrational\nobstacles’ ” to police investigation applies with less force.\n   In addition, the suspect’s equivocal reference to a lawyer\nin Davis occurred only after he had given express oral and\nwritten waivers of his rights. Davis’ holding is explicitly\npredicated on that fact. See 512 U. S., at 461 (“We there­\nfore hold that, after a knowing and voluntary waiver of the\nMiranda rights, law enforcement officers may continue\nquestioning until and unless the suspect clearly requests\nan attorney”). The Court ignores this aspect of Davis, as\nwell as the decisions of numerous federal and state courts\ndeclining to apply a clear-statement rule when a suspect\nhas not previously given an express waiver of rights.7\n   In my mind, a more appropriate standard for addressing\na suspect’s ambiguous invocation of the right to remain\nsilent is the constraint Mosley places on questioning a\nsuspect who has invoked that right: The suspect’s “ ‘right\nto cut off questioning’ ” must be “ ‘scrupulously honored.’ ”\nSee 423 U. S., at 104. Such a standard is necessarily\nprecautionary and fact specific. The rule would acknowl­\n\n——————\n  7 See, e.g., United States v.

Under such\ncircumstances, “scrupulous” respect for the suspect’s\nrights will require police to terminate questioning under\nMosley.8\n   To be sure, such a standard does not provide police with\na bright-line rule. Cf. ante, at 9–10. But, as we have\npreviously recognized, Mosley itself does not offer clear\nguidance to police about when and how interrogation may\ncontinue after a suspect invokes his rights. See Solem v.\nStumes, 465 U. S. 638, 648 (1984); see also Shatzer, 559\nU. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concur­\nring in judgment) (slip op., at 3). Given that police have\nfor nearly 35 years applied Mosley’s fact-specific standard\nin questioning suspects who have invoked their right to\nremain silent; that our cases did not during that time\nresolve what statements or actions suffice to invoke that\nright; and that neither Michigan nor the Solicitor General\nhave provided evidence in this case that the status quo\nhas proved unworkable, I see little reason to believe to­\n——————\n  8 Indeed, this rule appears to reflect widespread contemporary police\npractice. Thompkins’ amici collect a range of training materials that\ninstruct police not to engage in prolonged interrogation after a suspect\nhas failed to respond to initial questioning. See NACDL Brief 32–34.\nOne widely used police manual, for example, teaches that a suspect\nwho “indicates,” “even by silence itself,” his unwillingness to answer\nquestions “has obviously exercised his constitutional privilege against\nself-incrimination.” Inbau 498.\n20                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nday’s clear-statement rule is necessary to ensure effective\nlaw enforcement.\n   Davis’ clear-statement rule is also a poor fit for the right\nto silence. Advising a suspect that he has a “right to\nremain silent” is unlikely to convey that he must speak\n(and must do so in some particular fashion) to ensure the\nright will be protected. Cf. Soffar v. Cockrell, 300 F. 3d\n588, 603 (CA5 2002) (en banc) (DeMoss, J., dissenting)\n(“What in the world must an individual do to exercise his\nconstitutional right to remain silent beyond actually, in\nfact, remaining silent?”). By contrast, telling a suspect “he\nhas the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he\ncannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him\nprior to any questioning if he so desires,” Miranda, 384\nU. S., at 479, implies the need for speech to exercise that\nright. Davis’ requirement that a suspect must “clearly\nreques[t] an attorney” to terminate questioning thus\naligns with a suspect’s likely understanding of the\nMiranda warnings in a way today’s rule does not. The\nCourt suggests Thompkins could have employed the “sim­\nple, unambiguous” means of saying “he wanted to remain\nsilent” or “did not want to talk with the police.” Ante, at\n10. But the Miranda warnings give no hint that a suspect\nshould use those magic words, and there is little reason to\nbelieve police—who have ample incentives to avoid invoca­\ntion—will provide such guidance.\n   Conversely, the Court’s concern that police will face\n“difficult decisions about an accused’s unclear intent” and\nsuffer the consequences of “ ‘guess[ing] wrong,’ ” ante, at 9–\n10 (quoting Davis, 512 U. S., at 461), is misplaced. If a\nsuspect makes an ambiguous statement or engages in\nconduct that creates uncertainty about his intent to invoke\nhis right, police can simply ask for clarification. See id., at\n467 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment). It is hardly an\nunreasonable burden for police to ask a suspect, for in­\nstance, “Do you want to talk to us?” The majority in Davis\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

Given this straight­\nforward mechanism by which police can “scrupulously\nhono[r]” a suspect’s right to silence, today’s clear­\nstatement rule can only be seen as accepting “as tolerable\nthe certainty that some poorly expressed requests [to\nremain silent] will be disregarded,” id., at 471 (opinion of\nSouter, J.), without any countervailing benefit. Police may\nwell prefer not to seek clarification of an ambiguous\nstatement out of fear that a suspect will invoke his rights.\nBut “our system of justice is not founded on a fear that a\nsuspect will exercise his rights. ‘If the exercise of constitu­\ntional rights will thwart the effectiveness of a system of\nlaw enforcement, then there is something very wrong with\nthat system.’ ” Burbine, 475 U. S., at 458 (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting) (quoting Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478,\n490 (1964)).\n   The Court asserts in passing that treating ambiguous\nstatements or acts as an invocation of the right to silence\nwill only “ ‘marginally’ ” serve Miranda’s goals. Ante, at\n10. Experience suggests the contrary. In the 16 years\nsince Davis was decided, ample evidence has accrued that\ncriminal suspects often use equivocal or colloquial lan­\nguage in attempting to invoke their right to silence. A\nnumber of lower courts that have (erroneously, in my\nview) imposed a clear-statement requirement for invoca­\ntion of the right to silence have rejected as ambiguous an\narray of statements whose meaning might otherwise be\nthought plain.9 At a minimum, these decisions suggest\n——————\n  9 See United States v.

S., at\n459 (quoting id., at 476 (opinion of Souter, J.)), they dem­\nonstrate that today’s decision will significantly burden the\nexercise of the right to silence. Notably, when a suspect\n“understands his (expressed) wishes to have been ignored\n. . . in contravention of the ‘rights’ just read to him by his\ninterrogator, he may well see further objection as futile\nand confession (true or not) as the only way to end his\ninterrogation.” Id., at 472–473.\n    For these reasons, I believe a precautionary require­\n——————\nremain silent); State v.
