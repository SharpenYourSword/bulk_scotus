JUVENILE MALE\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n               No. 09–940    Decided June 7, 2010 \n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   In 2005, respondent was charged in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Montana with juvenile\ndelinquency under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act\n(FJDA), 18 U. S. C. §5031 et seq. Respondent eventually\npleaded “true” to knowingly engaging in sexual acts with a\nperson under 12 years of age, which would have been a\ncrime under §§2241(c) and 1153(a) if committed by an\nadult. In June 2005, the District Court accepted respon\ndent’s plea and adjudged him delinquent. The court sen\ntenced respondent to two years’ official detention and\njuvenile delinquent supervision until his 21st birthday.\nThe court also ordered respondent to spend the first six\nmonths of his juvenile supervision in a prerelease center\nand to abide by the center’s conditions of residency.\n   In 2006, Congress enacted the Sex Offender Registra\ntion and Notification Act (SORNA), 120 Stat. 590, 42\nU. S. C. §16901 et seq. With respect to juvenile offenders,\nSORNA requires individuals who have been adjudicated\ndelinquent for certain serious sex offenses to register and\nto keep their registrations current in each jurisdiction\nwhere they live, work, and go to school. §§16911(8);\n16913. In February 2007, the Attorney General issued an\ninterim rule specifying that SORNA’s requirements “apply\nto all sex offenders, including sex offenders convicted of\nthe offense for which registration is required prior to the\nenactment of [SORNA].” 72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (codified at 28\nCFR §72.3 (2009)).\n   In July 2007, the District Court revoked respondent’s\n2            UNITED STATES v. JUVENILE MALE\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\njuvenile supervision, finding that respondent had failed to\ncomply with the requirements of the prerelease program.\nThe court sentenced respondent to an additional 6-month\nterm of official detention, to be followed by a period of\nsupervision until his 21st birthday. The Government,\ninvoking SORNA’s juvenile registration provisions, argued\nthat respondent should be required to register as a sex\noffender, at least for the duration of his juvenile supervi\nsion. As “special conditions” of his supervision, the court\nordered respondent to register as a sex offender and to\nkeep his registration current. App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a.\n  The Ninth Circuit vacated the sex-offender-registration\nrequirements of the District Court’s order. 590 F. 3d 924\n(2010). The Court of Appeals determined that “retroactive\napplication of SORNA’s provision covering individuals who\nwere adjudicated juvenile delinquents because of the\ncommission of certain sex offenses before SORNA’s pas\nsage violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United\nStates Constitution.” Id., at 927. The court thus held that\n“SORNA’s juvenile registration provision may not be\napplied retroactively to individuals adjudicated delinquent\nunder the [FJDA].” Id., at 928.\n  The United States asks us to grant certiorari to review\nthe Ninth Circuit’s determination that SORNA violates\nthe Ex Post Facto Clause as applied to individuals who\nwere adjudicated juvenile delinquents under the FJDA\nprior to SORNA’s enactment. Before we can address that\nquestion, however, we must resolve a threshold issue of\nmootness. Before the Ninth Circuit, respondent chal\nlenged only the conditions of his juvenile supervision\nrequiring him to register as a sex offender. But on May 2,\n2008, respondent’s term of supervision expired, and thus\nhe no longer is subject to those sex-offender-registration\nconditions. As such, this case likely is moot unless re\nspondent can show that a decision invalidating the sex\noffender-registration conditions of his juvenile supervision\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nwould be sufficiently likely to redress “collateral conse\nquences adequate to meet Article III’s injury-in-fact re\nquirement.” Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U. S. 1, 14 (1998).\n  Perhaps the most likely potential “collateral conse\nquenc[e]” that might be remedied by a judgment in re\nspondent’s favor is the requirement that respondent re\nmain registered as a sex offender under Montana law.\n(“By the time of the court of appeals’ decision, respondent\nhad become registered as a sex offender in Montana,\nwhere he continues to be registered today.” Pet. for Cert.\n29.) We thus must know whether a favorable decision in\nthis case would make it sufficiently likely that respondent\n“could remove his name and identifying information from\nthe Montana sex offender registry.” Ibid. Therefore, we\ncertify the following question to the Supreme Court of\nMontana, pursuant to Montana Rule of Appellate Proce\ndure 15 (2009):\n    Is respondent’s duty to remain registered as a sex of\n    fender under Montana law contingent upon the valid\n    ity of the conditions of his now-expired federal juve\n    nile-supervision order that required him to register as\n    a sex offender, see Mont. Code Ann. §§46–23–\n    502(6)(b), 41–5–1513(1)(c) (2005); State v.
