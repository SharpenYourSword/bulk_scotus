LANNING\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 08–998.     Argued March 22, 2010—Decided June 7, 2010\nDebtors filing for protection under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code\n must agree to a court-approved plan under which they pay creditors\n out of their future income. If the bankruptcy trustee or an unsecured\n creditor objects, a bankruptcy court may not approve the plan unless\n it provides for the full repayment of unsecured claims or “provides\n that all of the debtor’s projected disposable income to be received”\n over the plan’s duration “will be applied to make payments” in accor\n dance with plan terms. 11 U. S. C. §1325(b)(1). Before enactment of\n the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of\n 2005 (BAPCPA), the Code loosely defined “disposable income.”\n Though it did not define “projected disposable income,” most bank\n ruptcy courts calculated it using a mechanical approach, multiplying\n monthly income by the number of months in the plan and then de\n termining the “disposable” portion of the result. In exceptional cases,\n those courts also took into account foreseeable changes in a debtor’s\n income or expenses. BAPCPA defines “disposable income” as “cur\n rent monthly income received by the debtor” less “amounts reasona\n bly necessary to be expended” for, e.g., the debtor’s maintenance and\n support. §1325(b)(2)(A)(i). “Current monthly income,” in turn, is cal\n culated by averaging the debtor’s monthly income during a 6-month\n look-back period preceding the petition’s filing. See §101(10A)(A)(i).\n If a debtor’s income is below the median for his or her State,\n “amounts reasonably necessary” include the full amount needed for\n “maintenance or support,” see §1325(b)(2)(A)(i), but if the debtor’s in\n come exceeds the state median, only certain specified expenses are\n included, see §§707(b)(2), 1325(b)(3)(A).\n    A one-time buyout from respondent’s former employer caused her\n current monthly income for the six months preceding her Chapter 13\n2                       HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    petition to exceed her State’s median income. However, based on the\n    income from her new job, which was below the state median, and her\n    expenses, she reported a monthly disposable income of $149.03. She\n    thus filed a plan that would have required her to pay $144 per month\n    for 36 months. Petitioner, the Chapter 13 trustee, objected to confir\n    mation of the plan because the proposed payment amount was less\n    than the full amount of the claims against respondent, and because\n    she had not committed all of her “projected disposable income” to re\n    paying creditors. Petitioner claimed that the mechanical approach\n    was the proper way to calculate projected disposable income, and that\n    using that approach, respondent should pay $756 per month for 60\n    months. Her actual income was insufficient to make such payments.\n      The Bankruptcy Court endorsed a $144 payment over a 60-month\n    period, concluding that “projected” requires courts to consider the\n    debtor’s actual income. The Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate\n    Panel affirmed, as did the Tenth Circuit, which held that a court cal\n    culating “projected disposable income” should begin with the “pre\n    sumption” that the figure yielded by the mechanical approach is cor\n    rect, but that this figure may be rebutted by evidence of a substantial\n    change in the debtor’s circumstances.\nHeld: When a bankruptcy court calculates a debtor’s projected dispos\n able income, the court may account for changes in the debtor’s income\n or expenses that are known or virtually certain at the time of confir\n mation. Pp. 6–18.\n    (a) Respondent has the better interpretation of “projected dispos\n able income.” First, such a forward-looking approach is supported by\n the ordinary meaning of “projected.” See Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winter\n boer, 513 U. S. 179, 187. In ordinary usage future occurrences are\n not “projected” based on the assumption that the past will necessarily\n repeat itself. While a projection takes past events into account, ad\n justments are often made based on other factors that may affect the\n outcome. Second, “projected” appears in many federal statutes, yet\n Congress rarely uses it to mean simple multiplication. See, e.g., 7\n U. S. C. §1301(b)(8)(B). By contrast, as the Bankruptcy Code shows,\n Congress can make its mandate of simple multiplication unambigu\n ous—commonly using the term “multiplied.” See, e.g., 11 U. S. C.\n §1325(b)(3). Third, under pre-BAPCPA case law, the general rule\n was that courts would multiply a debtor’s current monthly income by\n the number of months in the commitment period as the first step in\n determining projected disposable income, but would also have discre\n tion to account for known or virtually certain changes in the debtor’s\n income. This is significant, since the Court “will not read the Bank\n ruptcy Code to erode past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indica\n tion that Congress intended such a departure,” Travelers Casualty &\n                   Cite as: 560 U.

S. 443, 454,\nand Congress did not amend the term “projected disposable income”\nin 2005. Pp. 6–10.\n   (b) The mechanical approach also clashes with §1325’s terms.\nFirst, §1325(b)(1)(B)’s reference to projected disposable income “to be\nreceived in the applicable commitment period” strongly favors the\nforward-looking approach. Because respondent would have far less\nthan $756 per month in disposable income during the plan period, pe\ntitioner’s projection does not accurately reflect disposable income “to\nbe received.” In such circumstances, the mechanical approach effec\ntively reads that phrase out of the statute. Second, §1325(b)(1)’s di\nrection to courts to determine projected disposable income “as of the\neffective date of the plan,”— i.e., the confirmation date—is more con\nsistent with the view that they are to consider postfiling information\nabout a debtor’s financial situation. Had Congress intended for pro\njected disposable income to be no more than a multiple of disposable\nincome, it could have specified the plan’s filing date as the effective\ndate. Third, §1325(b)(1)(B)’s requirement that projected disposable\nincome “will be applied to make payments” is rendered a hollow\ncommand if, as of the plan’s effective date, the debtor lacks the\nmeans to pay creditors in the calculated monthly amounts. Pp. 11–\n12.\n   (c) The arguments supporting the mechanical approach are unper\nsuasive. The claim that the Code’s detailed and precise “disposable\nincome” definition would have no purpose without the mechanical\napproach overlooks the important role that this statutory formula\nplays under the forward-looking approach, which begins with a dis\nposable income calculation. The Tenth Circuit’s rebuttable “pre\nsumption” analysis simply heeds the ordinary meaning of “projected.”\nThis Court rejects petitioner’s argument that only the mechanical\napproach is consistent with §1129(a)(15)(B), which refers to “pro\njected disposable income of the debtor (as defined in section\n1325(b)(2)).” And the Court declines to infer from the fact that\n§1325(b)(3) incorporates §707—which allows courts to consider “spe\ncial circumstances,” but only with respect to calculating expenses—\nthat Congress intended to eliminate, sub silentio, the discretion that\ncourts previously exercised to account for known or virtually certain\nchanges. Pp. 12–14.\n   (d) Petitioner’s proposed strategies for avoiding or mitigating the\nharsh results that the mechanical approach may produce for debt\nors—a debtor could delay filing a petition so as to place any extraor\ndinary income outside the 6-month period; a debtor with unusually\nhigh income during that period could seek leave to delay filing a\nschedule of current income and ask the bankruptcy court to select a\n4                       HAMILTON v.

S. C. §§101(30),\n109(e). Unlike debtors who file under Chapter 7 and must\nliquidate their nonexempt assets in order to pay creditors,\nsee §§704(a)(1), 726, Chapter 13 debtors are permitted to\nkeep their property, but they must agree to a court­\napproved plan under which they pay creditors out of their\nfuture income, see §§1306(b), 1321, 1322(a)(1), 1328(a). A\nbankruptcy trustee oversees the filing and execution of a\nChapter 13 debtor’s plan. §1322(a)(1); see also 28 U. S. C.\n§586(a)(3).\n   Section 1325 of Title 11 specifies circumstances under\nwhich a bankruptcy court “shall” and “may not” confirm a\nplan. §1325(a),(b). If an unsecured creditor or the bank­\nruptcy trustee objects to confirmation, §1325(b)(1) requires\nthe debtor either to pay unsecured creditors in full or to\npay all “projected disposable income” to be received by the\ndebtor over the duration of the plan.\n2                  HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  We granted certiorari to decide how a bankruptcy court\nshould calculate a debtor’s “projected disposable income.”\nSome lower courts have taken what the parties term the\n“mechanical approach,” while most have adopted what has\nbeen called the “forward-looking approach.” We hold that\nthe “forward-looking approach” is correct.\n                              I\n   As previously noted, §1325 provides that if a trustee or\nan unsecured creditor objects to a Chapter 13 debtor’s\nplan, a bankruptcy court may not approve the plan unless\nit provides for the full repayment of unsecured claims or\n“provides that all of the debtor’s projected disposable\nincome to be received” over the duration of the plan “will\nbe applied to make payments” in accordance with the\nterms of the plan. 11 U. S. C. §1325(b)(1); see also\n§1325(b)(1) (2000 ed.). Before the enactment of the Bank­\nruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of\n2005 (BAPCPA), 119 Stat. 23, the Bankruptcy Code (Code)\nloosely defined “disposable income” as “income which is\nreceived by the debtor and which is not reasonably neces­\nsary to be expended” for the “maintenance or support of\nthe debtor,” for qualifying charitable contributions, or for\nbusiness expenditures. §1325(b)(2)(A), (B).\n   The Code did not define the term “projected disposable\nincome,” and in most cases, bankruptcy courts used a\nmechanical approach in calculating projected disposable\nincome. That is, they first multiplied monthly income by\nthe number of months in the plan and then determined\nwhat portion of the result was “excess” or “disposable.”\nSee 2 K. Lundin, Chapter 13 Bankruptcy §164.1, p. 164–1,\nand n. 4 (3d ed. 2000) (hereinafter Lundin (2000 ed.))\n(citing cases).\n   In exceptional cases, however, bankruptcy courts took\ninto account foreseeable changes in a debtor’s income or\nexpenses.     See In re Heath, 182 B. R. 557, 559–561\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n(Bkrtcy. App. Panel CA9 1995); In re Richardson, 283\nB. R. 783, 799 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Kan. 2002); Tr. of Oral Arg. 7.\nAccord, 1 Lundin §35.10, at 35–14 (2000 ed.) (“The debtor\nshould take some care to project estimated future income\non Schedule I to include anticipated increases or decreases\n[in income] so that the schedule will be consistent with\nany evidence of income the debtor would offer at a con­\ntested confirmation hearing”).\n   BAPCPA left the term “projected disposable income”\nundefined but specified in some detail how “disposable\nincome” is to be calculated. “Disposable income” is now\ndefined as “current monthly income received by the\ndebtor” less “amounts reasonably necessary to be ex­\npended” for the debtor’s maintenance and support, for\nqualifying charitable contributions, and for business ex­\npenditures. §1325(b)(2)(A)(i) and (ii) (2006 ed.). “Current\nmonthly income,” in turn, is calculated by averaging the\ndebtor’s monthly income during what the parties refer to\nas the 6-month look-back period, which generally consists\nof the six full months preceding the filing of the bank­\nruptcy petition.     See §101(10A)(A)(i).1      The phrase\n“amounts reasonably necessary to be expended” in\n§1325(b)(2) is also newly defined. For a debtor whose\nincome is below the median for his or her State, the\nphrase includes the full amount needed for “maintenance\nor support,” see §1325(b)(2)(A)(i), but for a debtor with\nincome that exceeds the state median, only certain speci­\nfied expenses are included,2 see §§707(b)(2), 1325(b)(3)(A).\n——————\n  1 However,  if a debtor does not file the required schedule (Schedule I),\nthe bankruptcy court may select a different 6-month period. See\n§101(10A)(A)(ii).\n  2 The formula for above-median-income debtors is known as the\n\n“means test” and is reflected in a schedule (Form 22C) that a Chapter\n13 debtor must file. See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. Official Form 22C\n(2009); In re Liverman, 383 B. R. 604, 606, n. 1, 608–609 (Bkrtcy. Ct.\nNJ 2008).\n4                 HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             II \n\n                             A\n\n   Respondent had $36,793.36 in unsecured debt when she\nfiled for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in October\n2006. In the six months before her filing, she received a\none-time buyout from her former employer, and this pay­\nment greatly inflated her gross income for April 2006 (to\n$11,990.03) and for May 2006 (to $15,356.42). App. 84,\n107. As a result of these payments, respondent’s current\nmonthly income, as averaged from April through October\n2006, was $5,343.70—a figure that exceeds the median\nincome for a family of one in Kansas. See id., at 78. Re­\nspondent’s monthly expenses, calculated pursuant to\n§707(b)(2), were $4,228.71. Id., at 83. She reported a\nmonthly “disposable income” of $1,114.98 on Form 22C.\nIbid.\n   On the form used for reporting monthly income (Sched­\nule I), she reported income from her new job of $1,922 per\nmonth—which is below the state median. Id., at 66; see\nalso id., at 78. On the form used for reporting monthly\nexpenses (Schedule J), she reported actual monthly ex­\npenses of $1,772.97. Id., at 68. Subtracting the Schedule\nJ figure from the Schedule I figure resulted in monthly\ndisposable income of $149.03.\n   Respondent filed a plan that would have required her to\npay $144 per month for 36 months. See id., at 93. Peti­\ntioner, a private Chapter 13 trustee, objected to confirma­\ntion of the plan because the amount respondent proposed\nto pay was less than the full amount of the claims against\nher, see §1325(b)(1)(A), and because, in petitioner’s view,\nrespondent was not committing all of her “projected dis­\nposable income” to the repayment of creditors, see\n§1325(b)(1)(B). According to petitioner, the proper way to\ncalculate projected disposable income was simply to mul­\ntiply disposable income, as calculated on Form 22C, by the\nnumber of months in the commitment period.

S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthis mechanical approach, petitioner calculated that credi­\ntors would be paid in full if respondent made monthly\npayments of $756 for a period of 60 months. Id., at 108.\nThere is no dispute that respondent’s actual income was\ninsufficient to make payments in that amount. Tr. of Oral\nArg. 3–4.\n                              B\n   The Bankruptcy Court endorsed respondent’s proposed\nmonthly payment of $144 but required a 60-month plan\nperiod. No. 06–41037 etc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1451999</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *8 (Bkrtcy.\nCt. Kan. 2007). The court agreed with the majority view\nthat the word “projected” in §1325(b)(1)(B) requires courts\n“to consider at confirmation the debtor’s actual income as\nit was reported on Schedule I.” Id., at *5 (emphasis\nadded). This conclusion was warranted by the text of\n§1325(b)(1), the Bankruptcy Court reasoned, and was\nnecessary to avoid the absurd result of denying bank­\nruptcy protection to individuals with deteriorating fi­\nnances in the six months before filing. Ibid.\n   Petitioner appealed to the Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy\nAppellate Panel, which affirmed. 380 B. R. 17, 19 (2007).\nThe Panel noted that, although Congress redefined “dis­\nposable income” in 2005, it chose not to alter the pre­\nexisting term “projected disposable income.” Id., at 24.\nThus, the Panel concluded, there was no reason to believe\nthat Congress intended to alter the pre-BAPCPA practice\nunder which bankruptcy courts determined projected\ndisposable income by reference to Schedules I and J but\nconsidered other evidence when there was reason to be­\nlieve that the schedules did not reflect a debtor’s actual\nability to pay. Ibid.\n   The Tenth Circuit affirmed. 545 F. 3d 1269, 1270\n(2008). According to the Tenth Circuit, a court, in calcu­\nlating “projected disposable income,” should begin with the\n“presumption” that the figure yielded by the mechanical\n6                 HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\napproach is correct, but the Court concluded that this\nfigure may be rebutted by evidence of a substantial change\nin the debtor’s circumstances. Id., at 1278–1279.\n   This petition followed, and we granted certiorari. 558\nU. S. ___ (2009).\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n   The parties differ sharply in their interpretation of\n§1325’s reference to “projected disposable income.” Peti­\ntioner, advocating the mechanical approach, contends that\n“projected disposable income” means past average monthly\ndisposable income multiplied by the number of months in\na debtor’s plan. Respondent, who favors the forward­\nlooking approach, agrees that the method outlined by\npetitioner should be determinative in most cases, but she\nargues that in exceptional cases, where significant\nchanges in a debtor’s financial circumstances are known or\nvirtually certain, a bankruptcy court has discretion to\nmake an appropriate adjustment. Respondent has the\nstronger argument.\n   First, respondent’s argument is supported by the ordi­\nnary meaning of the term “projected.” “When terms used\nin a statute are undefined, we give them their ordinary\nmeaning.” Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179,\n187 (1995). Here, the term “projected” is not defined, and\nin ordinary usage future occurrences are not “projected”\nbased on the assumption that the past will necessarily\nrepeat itself. For example, projections concerning a com­\npany’s future sales or the future cash flow from a license\ntake into account anticipated events that may change past\ntrends. See, e.g., Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights,\nLtd., 551 U. S. 308, 316 (2007) (describing adjustments to\n“projected sales” in light of falling demand); Innovair\nAviation, Ltd. v.

On the night of an election,\nexperts do not “project” the percentage of the votes that a\ncandidate will receive by simply assuming that the candi­\ndate will get the same percentage as he or she won in the\nfirst few reporting precincts. And sports analysts do not\nproject that a team’s winning percentage at the end of a\nnew season will be the same as the team’s winning per­\ncentage last year or the team’s winning percentage at the\nend of the first month of competition. While a projection\ntakes past events into account, adjustments are often\nmade based on other factors that may affect the final\noutcome. See In re Kibbe, 361 B. R. 302, 312, n. 9 (Bkrtcy.\nApp. Panel CA1 2007) (contrasting “multiplied,” which\n“requires only mathematical acumen,” with “projected,”\nwhich requires “mathematic acumen adjusted by delibera­\ntion and discretion”).\n   Second, the word “projected” appears in many federal\nstatutes, yet Congress rarely has used it to mean simple\nmultiplication. For example, the Agricultural Adjustment\nAct of 1938 defined “projected national yield,” “projected\ncounty yield,” and “projected farm yield” as entailing\nhistorical averages “adjusted for abnormal weather condi­\ntions,” “trends in yields,” and “any significant changes in\nproduction practices.” 7 U. S. C. §1301(b)(8)(B), (13)(J),\n(K).3\n——————\n  3 See also, e.g., 8 U. S. C. §1364(a), (c)(2) (requiring the triennial im­\nmigration-impact report to include information “projected for the\nsucceeding five-year period, based on reasonable estimates substanti­\nated by the best available evidence”); 10 U. S. C. A. §2433a(a)(2)(B)\n(2010 Cum. Supp.) (“projected cost of completing the [defense acquisi­\ntion] program based on reasonable modification of [current] require­\nments”); 15 U. S. C. §719c(c)(2) (2006 ed.) (“projected natural gas supply\nand demand”); 25 U. S. C. §2009(c)(1), (2) (requiring the Director of the\nOffice of Indian Education Programs to submit an annual report\ncontaining certain projections and “a description of the methods and\nformulas used to calculate the amounts projected”).\n8                  HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   By contrast, we need look no further than the Bank­\nruptcy Code to see that when Congress wishes to mandate\nsimple multiplication, it does so unambiguously—most\ncommonly by using the term “multiplied.” See, e.g., 11\nU. S. C. §1325(b)(3) (“current monthly income, when mul­\ntiplied by 12”); §§704(b)(2), 707(b)(6), (7)(A) (same);\n§707(b)(2)(A)(i), (B)(iv) (“multiplied by 60”). Accord, 2\nU. S. C. §58(b)(1)(B) (“multiplied by the number of months\nin such year”); 5 U. S. C. §8415(a) (“multiplied by such\nindividual’s total service”); 42 U. S. C. §403(f)(3) (“multi­\nplied by the number of months in such year”).\n   Third, pre-BAPCPA case law points in favor of the\n“forward-looking” approach. Prior to BAPCPA, the gen­\neral rule was that courts would multiply a debtor’s current\nmonthly income by the number of months in the commit­\nment period as the first step in determining projected\ndisposable income. See, e.g., In re Killough, 900 F. 2d 61,\n62–63 (CA5 1990) (per curiam); In re Anderson, 21 F. 3d\n355, 357 (CA9 1994); In re Solomon, 67 F. 3d 1128, 1132\n(CA4 1995). See 2 Lundin §164.1, at 164–1 (2000 ed.)\n(“Most courts focus on the debtor’s current income and\nextend current income (and expenditures) over the life of\nthe plan to calculate projected disposable income”). But\ncourts also had discretion to account for known or virtu­\nally certain changes in the debtor’s income. See Heath,\n182 B. R., at 559–561; Richardson, 283 B. R., at 799; In re\nJames, 260 B. R. 498, 514–515 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Idaho 2001);\nIn re Jobe, 197 B. R. 823, 826–827 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Tex.\n1996); In re Crompton, 73 B. R. 800, 808 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED\nPa. 1987); see also In re Schyma, 68 B. R. 52, 63 (Bkrtcy.\nCt. Minn. 1985) (“[T]he prospect of dividends . . . is not so\ncertain as to require Debtors or the Court to consider them\nas regular or disposable income”); In re Krull, 54 B.

See 8 Collier on Bankruptcy\n¶1325.08[4][a], p. 1325–50 (15th ed. rev. 2004) (hereinaf­\nter Collier) (“As a practical matter, unless there are\nchanges which can be clearly foreseen, the court must\nsimply multiply the debtor’s known monthly income by 36\nand determine whether the amount to be paid under the\nplan equals or exceeds that amount” (emphasis added)); 3\nW. Norton, Bankruptcy Law and Practice §75.10, p. 64\n(1991) (“It has been held that the court should focus upon\npresent monthly income and expenditures and, absent\nextraordinary circumstances, project these current\namounts over the life of the plan to determine projected\ndisposable income” (emphasis added)); 2 Lundin §164.1, at\n164–28 to 164–31 (2000 ed.) (describing how reported\ndecisions treated anticipated changes in income, particu­\nlarly where such changes were “too speculative to be pro­\njected”); see also In re Greer, 388 B. R. 889, 892 (Bkrtcy.\n——————\n   4 When pre-BAPCPA courts declined to make adjustments based on\n\npossible changes in a debtor’s future income or expenses, they did so\nbecause the changes were not sufficiently foreseeable, not because they\nconcluded that they lacked discretion to depart from a strictly mechani­\ncal approach. In In re Solomon, 67 F. 3d 1128 (1995), for example, the\nFourth Circuit refused to make such an adjustment because it deemed\ndisbursements from an individual retirement account during the plan\nperiod to be “speculative” and “hypothetical.” Id., at 1132. There is no\nreason to assume that the result would have been the same if future\ndisbursements had been more assured. That was certainly true of In re\nKillough, 900 F. 2d 61 (1990), in which the Fifth Circuit declined to\nrequire inclusion of overtime pay in projected disposable income be­\ncause it “was not definite enough.” Id., at 65; see also id., at 66\n(“[T]here may be instances where income obtained through working\novertime can and should appropriately be included in a debtor’s pro­\njected disposable income”).

Indeed, petitioner\nconcedes that courts possessed this discretion prior to\nBAPCPA. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7.\n   Pre-BAPCPA bankruptcy practice is telling because we\n“ ‘will not read the Bankruptcy Code to erode past bank­\nruptcy practice absent a clear indication that Congress\nintended such a departure.’ ” Travelers Casualty & Surety\nCo. of America v. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co., 549 U. S. 443,\n454 (2007); Lamie v. United States Trustee, 540 U. S. 526,\n539 (2004); Cohen v. de la Cruz, 523 U. S. 213, 221 (1998);\nsee also Grogan v. Garner, 498 U. S. 279, 290 (1991); Kelly\nv. Robinson, 479 U. S. 36, 47 (1986). Congress did not\namend the term “projected disposable income” in 2005,\nand pre-BAPCPA bankruptcy practice reflected a widely\nacknowledged and well-documented view that courts may\ntake into account known or virtually certain changes to\ndebtors’ income or expenses when projecting disposable\nincome. In light of this historical practice, we would ex­\npect that, had Congress intended for “projected” to carry a\nspecialized—and indeed, unusual—meaning in Chapter\n13, Congress would have said so expressly. Cf., e.g., 26\nU. S. C. §279(c)(3)(A), (B) (expressly defining “projected\nearnings” as reflecting a 3-year historical average).\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               B\n   The mechanical approach also clashes repeatedly with\nthe terms of 11 U. S. C. §1325.\n   First, §1325(b)(1)(B)’s reference to projected disposable\nincome “to be received in the applicable commitment\nperiod” strongly favors the forward-looking approach.\nThere is no dispute that respondent would in fact receive\nfar less than $756 per month in disposable income during\nthe plan period, so petitioner’s projection does not accu­\nrately reflect “income to be received” during that period.\nSee In re Nowlin, 576 F. 3d 258, 263 (CA5 2009). The\nmechanical approach effectively reads this phrase out of\nthe statute when a debtor’s current disposable income is\nsubstantially higher than the income that the debtor\npredictably will receive during the plan period. See\nKawaauhau v. Geiger, 523 U. S. 57, 62 (1998) (“[W]e are\nhesitant to adopt an interpretation of a congressional\nenactment which renders superfluous another portion of\nthat same law” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   Second, §1325(b)(1) directs courts to determine projected\ndisposable income “as of the effective date of the plan,”\nwhich is the date on which the plan is confirmed and\nbecomes binding, see §1327(a). Had Congress intended for\nprojected disposable income to be nothing more than a\nmultiple of disposable income in all cases, we see no rea­\nson why Congress would not have required courts to de­\ntermine that value as of the filing date of the plan. See\nFed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3015(b) (requiring that a plan be\nfiled within 14 days of the filing of a petition), online at\nhttp://www.uscourts.gov/RulesAndPolicies/FederalRulema\nking/Overview/BankruptcyRules.aspx (all Internet mate­\nrials as visited June 3, 2010, and available in Clerk of\nCourt’s case file). In the very next section of the Code, for\nexample, Congress specified that a debtor shall commence\npayments “not later than 30 days after the date of the\nfiling of the plan.” §1326(a)(1) (emphasis added). Con­\n12                HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngress’ decision to require courts to measure projected\ndisposable income “as of the effective date of the plan” is\nmore consistent with the view that Congress expected\ncourts to consider postfiling information about the debtor’s\nfinancial circumstances.        See 545 F. 3d, at 1279\n(“[D]etermining whether or not a debtor has committed all\nprojected disposable income to repayment of the unsecured\ncreditors ‘as of the effective date of the plan’ suggests\nconsideration of the debtor’s actual financial circum­\nstances as of the effective date of the plan”).\n   Third, the requirement that projected disposable income\n“will be applied to make payments” is most naturally read\nto contemplate that the debtor will actually pay creditors\nin the calculated monthly amounts. §1325(b)(1)(B). But\nwhen, as of the effective date of a plan, the debtor lacks\nthe means to do so, this language is rendered a hollow\ncommand.\n                             C\n   The arguments advanced in favor of the mechanical\napproach are unpersuasive. Noting that the Code now\nprovides a detailed and precise definition of “disposable\nincome,” proponents of the mechanical approach maintain\nthat any departure from this method leaves that definition\n“ ‘with no apparent purpose.’ ” In re Kagenveama, 541 F.\n3d 868, 873 (CA9 2008). This argument overlooks the\nimportant role that the statutory formula for calculating\n“disposable income” plays under the forward-looking\napproach. As the Tenth Circuit recognized in this case, a\ncourt taking the forward-looking approach should begin by\ncalculating disposable income, and in most cases, nothing\nmore is required. It is only in unusual cases that a court\nmay go further and take into account other known or\nvirtually certain information about the debtor’s future\n                    Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nincome or expenses.5\n  Petitioner faults the Tenth Circuit for referring to a\nrebuttable “presumption” that the figure produced by the\nmechanical approach accurately represents a debtor’s\n“projected disposable income.” See 545 F. 3d, at 1278–\n1279. Petitioner notes that the Code makes no reference\nto any such presumption but that related Code provisions\nexpressly create other rebuttable presumptions.         See\n§707(b)(2)(A)(i) and (B)(i). He thus suggests that the\nTenth Circuit improperly supplemented the text of the\nCode.\n  The Tenth Circuit’s analysis, however, simply heeds the\nordinary meaning of the term “projected.” As noted, a\nperson making a projection uses past occurrences as a\nstarting point, and that is precisely what the Tenth Cir­\ncuit prescribed. See, e.g., Nowlin, supra, at 260, 263.\n  Petitioner argues that only the mechanical approach is\nconsistent with §1129(a)(15)(B), which refers to “projected\ndisposable income of the debtor (as defined in section\n1325(b)(2)).”    This cross-reference, petitioner argues,\nshows that Congress intended for the term “projected\ndisposable income” to incorporate, presumably in all con­\ntexts, the defined term “disposable income.” It is evident\nthat §1129(a)(15)(B) refers to the defined term “dis-\nposable income,” see §1325(b)(2), but that fact offers\nno insight into the meaning of the word “projected”\nin §§1129(a)(15)(B) and 1325(b)(1)(B). We fail to see\nhow that word acquires a specialized meaning as a\nresult of this cross-reference—particularly where both\n§§1129(a)(15)(B) and 1325(b)(1)(B) refer to projected dis­\nposable income “to be received” during the relevant period.\nSee supra, at 11.\n——————\n  5 For the same reason, the phrase “[f]or purposes of this subsection”\n\nin §1325(b)(2) is not rendered superfluous by the forward-looking\napproach.\n14                HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Petitioner also notes that §707 allows courts to take\n“special circumstances” into consideration, but that\n§1325(b)(3) incorporates §707 only with respect to calcu­\nlating expenses. See In re Wilson, 397 B. R. 299, 314–315\n(Bkrtcy. Ct. MDNC 2008). Thus, he argues, a “special\ncircumstances” exception should not be inferred with\nrespect to the debtor’s income. We decline to infer from\n§1325’s incorporation of §707 that Congress intended to\neliminate, sub silentio, the discretion that courts previ­\nously exercised when projecting disposable income to\naccount for known or virtually certain changes. Accord,\nIn re Liverman, 383 B. R. 604, 613, and n. 15 (Bkrtcy. Ct.\nNJ 2008).\n                            D\n   In cases in which a debtor’s disposable income during\nthe 6-month look-back period is either substantially lower\nor higher than the debtor’s disposable income during the\nplan period, the mechanical approach would produce\nsenseless results that we do not think Congress intended.\nIn cases in which the debtor’s disposable income is higher\nduring the plan period, the mechanical approach would\ndeny creditors payments that the debtor could easily\nmake. And where, as in the present case, the debtor’s\ndisposable income during the plan period is substantially\nlower, the mechanical approach would deny the protection\nof Chapter 13 to debtors who meet the chapter’s main\neligibility requirements. Here, for example, respondent is\nan “individual whose income is sufficiently stable and\nregular” to allow her “to make payments under a plan,”\n§101(30), and her debts fall below the limits set out in\n§109(e). But if the mechanical approach were used, she\ncould not file a confirmable plan. Under §1325(a)(6), a\nplan cannot be confirmed unless “the debtor will be able to\nmake all payments under the plan and comply with the\nplan.” And as petitioner concedes, respondent could not\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

He\nproposes no comparable strategies for creditors harmed by\nthe mechanical approach, and in any event none of the\nmaneuvers that he proposes for debtors is satisfactory.\n                               1\n   Petitioner first suggests that a debtor may delay filing a\npetition so as to place any extraordinary income outside\nthe 6-month look-back period. We see at least two prob­\nlems with this proposal.\n   First, delay is often not a viable option for a debtor\nsliding into bankruptcy.\n      “Potential Chapter 13 debtors typically find a law­\n    yer’s office when they are one step from financial\n    Armageddon: There is a foreclosure sale of the\n    debtor’s home the next day; the debtor’s only car\n    was mysteriously repossessed in the dark of last\n    night; a garnishment has reduced the debtor’s\n    take-home pay below the ordinary requirements\n    of food and rent.       Instantaneous relief is ex-\n    pected, if not necessary.” K. Lundin & W.

See 11 U. S. C. §1325(a)(7) (requiring,\nas a condition of confirmation, that “the action of the\ndebtor in filing the petition was in good faith”); see also,\n16                     HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ne.g., In re Myers, 491 F. 3d 120, 125 (CA3 2007) (citing\n“ ‘the timing of the petition’ ” as a factor to be considered in\nassessing a debtor’s compliance with the good-faith re­\nquirement). Accord, Neufeld v. Freeman, 794 F. 2d 149,\n153 (CA4 1986) (a debtor’s prepetition conduct may inform\nthe court’s good-faith inquiry).\n                             2\n  Petitioner next argues that a debtor with unusually\nhigh income during the 6 months prior to the filing of a\npetition, could seek leave to delay filing a schedule of\ncurrent income (Schedule I) and then ask the bankruptcy\ncourt to exercise its authority under §101(10A)(A)(ii) to\nselect a 6-month period that is more representative of the\ndebtor’s future disposable income. We see little merit in\nthis convoluted strategy. If the Code required the use of\nthe mechanical approach in all cases, this strategy would\nimproperly undermine what the Code demands. And if, as\nwe believe, the Code does not insist upon rigid adherence\nto the mechanical approach in all cases, this strategy is\nnot needed. In any event, even if this strategy were al­\nlowed, it would not help all debtors whose disposable\nincome during the plan period is sharply lower than their\nprevious disposable income.6\n                             3\n   Petitioner suggests that a debtor can dismiss the peti­\ntion and refile at a later, more favorable date. But peti­\ntioner offers only the tepid assurance that courts “gener­\nally” do not find this practice to be abusive. Brief for\nPetitioner 53.

R. 516, 520\n(Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Tenn. 2002) (noting that courts should\nconsider, among other factors, “whether this is the first or\n[a] subsequent filin[g]” when assessing a debtor’s compli­\nance with the good-faith requirement).\n                                4\n   Petitioner argues that respondent might have been able\nto obtain relief by filing under Chapter 7 or by converting\nher Chapter 13 petition to one under Chapter 7. The\navailability of Chapter 7 to debtors like respondent who\nhave above-median incomes is limited. In respondent’s\ncase, a presumption of abuse would attach under\n§707(b)(2)(A)(i) because her disposable income, “multiplied\nby 60,” exceeds the amounts specified in subclauses (I) and\n(II). See also §707(b)(1) (allowing a court to dismiss a\npetition filed by a debtor “whose debts are primarily con­\nsumer debts . . . if it finds that the granting of relief would\nbe an abuse of the provisions of this chapter”); App. 86–88\n(“Notice to Individual Consumer Debtor under §342(b) of\nthe Bankruptcy Code”) (“If your income is greater than the\nmedian income for your state of residence and family size,\nin some cases, creditors have the right to file a motion\nrequesting that the court dismiss your case under §707(b)\nof the Code”).

LANNING\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfies as examples of “special circumstances” a “serious\nmedical condition or a call or order to active duty in the\nArmed Forces,” ibid., and petitioner directs us to no au­\nthority for the proposition that a prepetition decline in\nincome would qualify as a “special circumstance.” In any\nevent, the “special circumstances” exception is available\nonly to the extent that “there is no reasonable alternative,”\nibid., a proposition we reject with our interpretation of\n§1325(b)(1) today.8\n   In sum, each of the strategies that petitioner identifies\nfor mitigating the anomalous effects of the mechanical\napproach is flawed.

S. C. §1325(b)(1)(B). The Code provides a formula for\n“project[ing]” what a debtor’s “disposable income” will be,\nwhich so far as his earnings are concerned turns only on\nhis past income. The Court concludes that this formula\nshould not apply in “exceptional cases” where “known or\nvirtually certain” changes in the debtor’s circumstances\nmake it a poor predictor. Ante, at 6. Because that conclu\nsion is contrary to the Code’s text, I respectfully dissent.\n                              I\n                              A\n  A bankruptcy court cannot confirm a Chapter 13 plan\nover the objection of the trustee unless, as of the plan’s\neffective date, either (A) the property to be distributed on\naccount of the unsecured claim at issue exceeds its amount\nor (B) the “the plan provides that all of the debtor’s pro\njected disposable income to be received in the applicable\ncommitment period beginning on the date that the first\npayment is due under the plan will be applied to make\n2                     HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                        SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\npayments to unsecured creditors under the plan.”\n§1325(b)(1)(B). The Code does not define “projected dis\nposable income,” but it does define “disposable income.”\nThe next paragraph of §1325(b) provides that “[f]or pur\nposes of this subsection, the term ‘disposable income’\nmeans current monthly income received by the debtor,”\nexcluding certain payments received for child support,\n“less amounts reasonably necessary to be expended” on\nthree categories of expenses. §1325(b)(2). The Code in\nturn defines “current monthly income” as “the average\nmonthly income from all sources that the debtor re\nceives . . . derived during the 6-month period ending on”\none of two dates.1 §101(10A)(A). Whichever date applies,\na debtor’s “current monthly income,” and thus the income\ncomponent of his “disposable income,” is a sum certain, a\nrate fixed once for all based on historical figures.\n   This definition of “disposable income” applies to the use\nof that term in the longer phrase “projected disposable\nincome” in §1325(b)(1)(B), since the definition says that it\napplies to subsection (b). Cf. §1129(a)(15)(B) (referring to\n“the projected disposable income of the debtor (as defined\nin section 1325(b)(2))”). The puzzle is what to make of the\nword “projected.”\n   In the Court’s view, this modifier makes all the differ\nence. Projections, it explains, ordinarily account for later\ndevelopments, not just past data. Ante, at 6–7. Thus, the\nCourt concludes, in determining “projected disposable\nincome” a bankruptcy court may depart from §1325(b)(2)’s\n——————\n    1 If\n      the debtor files a schedule of current income, as ordinarily re\nquired by §521(a)(1)(B)(ii), then the 6-month period ends on the last\nday of the month preceding the date the case is commenced,\n§101(10A)(A)(i)—that is, when the petition is filed, §§301(a), 302(a),\n303(b). If the debtor does not file such a schedule on time—which the\nbankruptcy court apparently may excuse him from doing,\n§521(a)(1)(B)(ii)—the 6-month period ends on the date the bankruptcy\ncourt determines the debtor’s current income. §101(10A)(A)(ii).\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

Ante, at 6.\n   That interpretation runs aground because it either\nrenders superfluous text Congress included or requires\nadding text Congress did not. It would be pointless to\ndefine disposable income in such detail, based on data\nduring a specific 6-month period, if a court were free to set\nthe resulting figure aside whenever it appears to be a poor\npredictor. And since “disposable income” appears nowhere\nelse in §1325(b), then unless §1325(b)(2)’s definition ap\nplies to “projected disposable income” in §1325(b)(1)(B), it\ndoes not apply at all.\n   The Court insists its interpretation does not render\n§1325(b)(2)’s incorporation of “current monthly income” a\nnullity: A bankruptcy court must still begin with that\nfigure, but is simply free to fiddle with it if a “significant”\nchange in the debtor’s circumstances is “known or virtu\nally certain.” Ante, at 6, 12. That construction conven\niently avoids superfluity, but only by utterly abandoning\nthe text the Court purports to construe. Nothing in the\ntext supports treating the definition of disposable income\nCongress supplied as a suggestion. And even if the word\n“projected” did allow (or direct) a court to disregard\n§1325(b)(2)’s fixed formula and to consider other data,\nthere would be no basis in the text for the restrictions the\nCourt reads in, regarding when and to what extent a court\nmay (or must) do so. If the statute authorizes estimations,\nit authorizes them in every case, not just those where\nchanges to the debtor’s income are both “significant” and\neither “known or virtually certain.” Ibid. If the evidence\nindicates it is merely more likely than not that the\ndebtor’s income will increase by some minimal amount,\nthere is no reading of the word “projected” that permits (or\nrequires) a court to ignore that change. The Court, in\nshort, can arrive at its compromise construction only by\n4                  HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nrewriting the statute.\n                              B\n   The only reasonable reading that avoids deleting words\nCongress enacted, or adding others it did not, is this:\nSetting aside expenses excludable under §1325(b)(2)(A)\nand (B), which are not at issue here, a court must calcu\nlate the debtor’s “projected disposable income” by multi\nplying his current monthly income by the number of\nmonths in the “applicable commitment period.” The word\n“projected” in this context, I agree, most sensibly refers to\na calculation, prediction, or estimation of future events,\nsee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12–13 (col\nlecting dictionary definitions); see also Webster’s New\nInternational Dictionary 1978 (2d ed. 1957). But one\nassuredly can calculate, predict, or estimate future figures\nbased on the past. And here Congress has commanded\nthat a specific historical figure shall be the basis for the\nprojection.\n   The Court rejects this reading as unrealistic. A projec\ntion, the Court explains, may be based in part on past\ndata, but “adjustments are often made based on other\nfactors that may affect the final outcome.” Ante, at 7.\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results. No\ngambler would bet the farm using “project[ions]” that are\nbased only on a football team’s play before its star quar\nterback was injured. And no pundit would keep his post if\nhe “projected” election results relying only on prior cycles,\nignoring recent polls. So too, the Court appears to reason,\nit makes no sense to say a court “project[s]” a debtor’s\n“disposable income” when it considers only what he earned\nin a specific 6-month period in the past. Ante, at 6–7.\n   Such analogies do not establish that carrying current\nmonthly income forward to determine a debtor’s future\nability to pay is not a “projection.” They show only that\nrelying exclusively on past data for the projection may be a\n                   Cite as: 560 U.

One who is asked to predict future results, but\nis armed with no other information than prior perform\nance, can still make a projection; it may simply be off the\nmark. Congress, of course, could have tried to prevent\nthat possibility by prescribing, as it has done in other\ncontexts, that a debtor’s projected disposable income be\ndetermined based on the “best available evidence,” 8\nU. S. C. §1364(c)(2), or “any . . . relevant information,” 25\nU. S. C. §2009(c)(1). But it included no such prescription\nhere, and instead identified the data a court should con\nsider. Perhaps Congress concluded that other information\na bankruptcy court might consider is too uncertain or too\neasily manipulated. Or perhaps it thought the cost of\nconsidering such information outweighed the benefits. Cf.\n7 U. S. C. §1301(b)(13)(J)–(M) (requiring national and\nlocal “projected” yields of various crops to be adjusted only\nfor abnormal weather, trends in yields, and production\npractices, apparently to the exclusion of other presumably\nrelevant variables such as a sudden increase or decrease\nin the number of producers, farm subsidies, etc.). In all\nevents, neither the reasons for nor the wisdom of the\nprojection method Congress chose has any bearing on\nwhat the statute means.\n   The Court contends that if Congress really meant courts\nto multiply a static figure by a set number of months, it\nwould have used the word “multiplied,” as it has done\nelsewhere—indeed, elsewhere in the same subsection, see,\ne.g., 11 U. S. C. §1325(b)(3)—instead of the word “pro\njected.”2 Ante, at 8. I do not dispute that, as a general\nmatter, we should presume that Congress does not ordi\nnarily use two words in the same context to denote the\n——————\n  2 Of course, since the number of months in the commitment period\n\nmay vary, Congress could not simply have substituted a single word,\nbut would have had to write “disposable income multiplied by the\nnumber of months in the applicable commitment period” or some such\nphrase.\n6                      HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsame thing. But if forced to choose between (A) assuming\nCongress enacted text that serves no purpose at all, (B)\nascribing an unheard-of meaning to the word “projected”\n(loaded with made-to-order restrictions) simply to avoid\nundesirable results, or (C) assuming Congress employed\nsynonyms to express a single idea, the last is obviously the\nleast evil.\n   In any event, we are not put to that choice here. While\nunder my reading a court must determine the income half\nof the “projected disposable income” equation by multiply\ning a fixed number, that is not necessarily true of the\nexpenses excludable under §1325(b)(2)(A) and (B). Unlike\nthe debtor’s current monthly income, none of the three\ntypes of expenses—payments for the support of the debtor\nand his dependents, charitable contributions, and ex\npenses to keep an existing business above water—is ex\nplicitly defined in terms of historical figures (at least for\ndebtors with incomes below the state median). The first of\nthose cannot possibly (in many cases) be determined based\non the same 6-month period from which current monthly\nincome is derived,3 and the texts of the other two are\nconsistent with determining expenses based on expecta\ntions. See §1325(b)(2)(A)(ii) (charitable expenses to quali\nfied entities limited to “15 percent of gross income of the\ndebtor for the year in which the contributions are made”);\n§1325(b)(2)(B) (“expenditures necessary for the continua\ntion, preservation, and operation” of a business in which\nthe debtor is engaged).\n   In short, a debtor’s projected disposable income consists\nof two parts: one (current monthly income) that is fixed\n——————\n  3 For a debtor whose income is below the state median, excludable\n\nexpenses include domestic-support obligations “that first becom[e]\npayable after the date the petition is filed,” §1325(b)(2)(A)(i)—that is,\nafter the six-month window relevant to the debtor’s current monthly\nincome has closed (unless the debtor does not file a current-income\nschedule), see §101(10A)(A)(i).\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nonce for all based on historical data, and another (the\nenumerated expenses) that at least arguably depends on\nestimations of the debtor’s future circumstances. The\nstatute thus requires the court to predict the difference\nbetween two figures, each of which depends on the dura\ntion of the commitment period, and one of which also turns\npartly on facts besides historical data. In light of all this,\nit seems to me not at all unusual to describe this process\nas projection, not merely multiplication.\n                              C\n   The Court’s remaining arguments about the statute’s\nmeaning are easily dispatched. A “mechanical” reading of\nprojected disposable income, it contends, renders superflu\nous the phrase “to be received in the applicable commit\nment period” in §1325(b)(1)(B). Ante, at 11. Not at all.\nThat phrase defines the period for which a debtor’s dis\nposable income must be calculated (i.e., the period over\nwhich the projection extends), and thus the amount the\ndebtor must ultimately pay his unsecured creditors.\n   Similarly insubstantial is the Court’s claim regarding\nthe requirement that the plan provide that the debtor’s\nprojected disposable income “will be applied to make\npayments”      toward     unsecured    creditors’    claims,\n§1325(b)(1)(B). The Court says this requirement makes no\nsense unless the debtor is actually able to pay an amount\nequal to his projected disposable income. Ante, at 12. But\nit makes no sense only if one assumes that the debtor is\nentitled to confirmation in the first place; and that as\nsumption is wrong. The requirement that the debtor pay\nat least his projected disposable income is a prerequisite to\nconfirmation. The “will be applied” proviso does not re\nquire a debtor to pay what he cannot; it simply withholds\nChapter 13 relief when he cannot pay.\n   The Court also argues that §1325(b)(1)’s directive to\ndetermine projected disposable income “as of the effective\n8                  HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ndate of the plan” makes no sense if mere multiplication of\nexisting numbers is required. Ante, at 11–12. As I have\nexplained, however, “projected disposable income” may in\nsome cases require more than multiplication (as to ex\npenses), and the estimations involved may vary from the\ndate of the plan’s filing until the date it takes effect.\nMoreover, the provision also applies to the alternative\navenue to confirmation in §1325(b)(1)(A), which requires\nthat “the value of the property to be distributed under the\nplan” to an unsecured creditor equals or exceeds the credi\ntor’s claim. As to that requirement, the effective-date\nrequirement makes perfect sense.\n   Text aside, the Court also observes that Circuit practice\nprior to the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer\nProtection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), 119 Stat. 23, aligns\nwith the atextual approach the Court adopts today. Ante,\nat 8–10. That is unsurprising, since the prior version of\nthe relevant provisions was completely consistent with\nthat approach. The Court is correct that BAPCPA “did not\namend the term ‘projected disposable income,’ ” ante, at 10.\nBut it did amend the definition of that term. Before 2005,\n§1325(b)(2) defined “disposable income” simply as “income\nwhich is received by the debtor and which is not reasona\nbly necessary to be expended” on the same basic types of\nexpenses excluded by the current statute. §1325(b)(2)\n(2000 ed.). Nothing in that terse definition compelled a\ncourt to rely exclusively on past data, let alone a specific 6\nmonth period. But in BAPCPA—the same Act in which\nCongress defined “current monthly income” in\n§101(10A)(A)—Congress redefined “disposable income” in\n§1325(b)(2) to incorporate that backward-looking defini\ntion. See Pub. L. 109–8, §102(b), (h), 119 Stat. 32–34.\nGiven these significant changes, the fact that the Court’s\napproach conforms with pre-BAPCPA practice not only\ndoes not recommend it, see e.g., Pennsylvania Dept. of\nPublic Welfare v. Davenport, 495 U. S. 552, 563–564\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n(1990), but renders it suspect.\n                              II\n  Unable to assemble a compelling case based on what the\nstatute says, the Court falls back on the “senseless re\nsults” it would produce—results the Court “do[es] not\nthink Congress intended.” Ante, at 14. Even if it were\ntrue that a “mechanical” reading resulted in undesirable\noutcomes, that would make no difference. Lewis v. Chi\ncago, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 11). For even\nassuming (though I do not believe it) that we could know\nwhich results Congress thought it was achieving (or avoid\ning) apart from the only congressional expression of its\nthoughts, the text, those results would be entirely irrele\nvant to what the statute means.\n  In any event, the effects the Court fears are neither as\ninevitable nor as “senseless” as the Court portrays. The\nCourt’s first concern is that if actual or anticipated\nchanges in the debtor’s earnings are ignored, then a debtor\nwhose income increases after the critical 6-month window\nwill not be required to pay all he can afford. Ante, at 14.\nBut as Lanning points out, Brief for Respondent 22–23,\nChapter 13 authorizes the Bankruptcy Court, at the re\nquest of unsecured creditors, to modify the plan “[a]t any\ntime after confirmation” to “increase . . . the amount of\npayments” on a class of claims or “reduce the time for such\npayments.” §1329(a)(1)–(2) (2006 ed.). The Court offers\nno explanation of why modification would not be available\nin such instances, and sufficient to resolve the concern.\n  The Court also cringes at the prospect that a debtor\nwhose income suddenly declines after the 6-month window\nor who, as in this case, receives a one-off windfall during\nthat window, will be barred from Chapter 13 relief be\ncause he will be unable to devote his “disposable income”\n(which turns on his prior earnings) to paying his unse\ncured creditors going forward. Ante, at 14–15. At least for\n10                HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ndebtors whose circumstances deteriorate after confirma\ntion, however, the Code already provides an answer. Just\nas a creditor can request an upward modification in light\nof postconfirmation developments, so too can a debtor ask\nfor a downward adjustment. §1329(a). Cf. §1329(b)(1)\n(requiring that modifications meet requirements of\n§§1322(a)–(b), 1323(c), and 1325(a), but not §1325(b)).\n   Moreover, even apart from the availability of modifica\ntion it requires little imagination to see why Congress\nmight want to withhold relief from debtors whose situa\ntions have suddenly deteriorated (after or even toward the\nend of the 6-month window), or who in the midst of dire\nstraits have been blessed (within the 6-month window) by\nan influx of unusually high income. Bankruptcy protec\ntion is not a birthright, and Congress could reasonably\nconclude that those who have just hit the skids do not yet\nneed a reprieve from repaying their debts; perhaps they\nwill recover. And perhaps the debtor who has received a\none-time bonus will thereby be enabled to stay afloat.\nHow long to wait before throwing the debtor a lifeline is\ninherently a policy choice. Congress confined the calcula\ntion of current monthly income to a 6-month period (ordi\nnarily ending before the case is commenced), but it could\nhave picked 2 or 12 months (or a different end date) in\nstead. Whatever the wisdom of the window it chose, we\nshould not assume it did not know what it was doing and\naccordingly refuse to give effect to its words.\n   Even if one insists on making provision for such debtors,\nthe Court is wrong to write off four alternative strategies\nthe trustee suggests, Brief for Petitioner 50–54:\n   ● Presumably some debtors whose income has only\nrecently been reduced, or who have just received a jolt that\ncauses a temporary uptick in their average income, can\ndelay filing a Chapter 13 petition until their “current\nmonthly income” catches up with their present circum\nstances. The Court speculates that delay might “giv[e] the\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

See §101(10A)(A)(ii). The Court\ndismisses this alternative, explaining that if the Code\nrequires a mechanical approach this solution would “im\nproperly undermine” it, and if the Code allows exceptions\nfor changed circumstances the solution is unnecessary.\nAnte, at 16. The second premise is correct, but the first is\nnot. Congress does not pursue its purposes at all costs.\nRodriguez v. United States, 480 U. S. 522, 525–526 (1987)\n(per curiam). Here it may have struck the very balance\nthe Court thinks critical by creating a fixed formula but\nleaving leeway as to the time to which it applies.5\n——————\n  4 Neither of the two Court of Appeals cases the Court cites—In re\n\nMyers, 491 F. 3d 120, 125 (CA3 2007), and Neufeld v. Freeman, 794\nF. 2d 149, 153 (CA4 1986)—involved a debtor’s delaying his petition\nuntil his circumstances would permit the court to confirm a repayment\nplan.\n  5 The Court observes that not every debtor will benefit from this ex\n\nception, ante, at 16, and n. 6, since §521(i)(3) provides that a bank\nruptcy court may not grant a request (which may be made after the\ndeadline for filing the current-income schedule) for an extension of\nmore than 45 days to file such a schedule. But the statute appears to\nassume that a court may excuse the filing of such a schedule altogether:\nA debtor is required to file a schedule in the first instance “unless the\ncourt orders otherwise,” §521(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added).             And\n§101(10A)(A)(ii)’s provision of a method for calculating current monthly\nincome “if the debtor does not file the schedule of current income\nrequired by section 521(a)(1)(B)(ii)” makes little sense unless a court\ncan excuse the failure to do so, since an unexcused failure to do so\nwould be a basis for dismissing the case, see §521(i).

The\nCourt worries that this alternative also might be deemed\nabusive, again with no pertinent authority for the specula\ntion.6 Its concern is based primarily on its belief that this\n“circumvents the statutory limits on a court’s ability to\nshift the look-back period.” Ante, at 16–17. That belief is\nmistaken, both because the Court exaggerates the statu\ntory limitations on adjusting the look-back period, and\nbecause, just as it does not defeat the disposable-income\nformula’s rigidity to allow adjustments regarding the time\nof determining that figure, it would not undermine the\nlimitations on adjustment applicable in a pending case to\nallow the debtor to dismiss and refile.7\n——————\nzation for limited extensions, since that applies to extensions sought up\nto 45 days after the filing deadline, whereas §521(a)(1)(B) seems to\napply only before the deadline.\n   6 The sole authority the Court supplies—a single Bankruptcy Court\n\ndecision predating BAPCPA—provides no support. See In re Glenn,\n288 B. R. 516, 519–521 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Tenn. 2002). Although ac\nknowledging that “[m]ultiple filings by a debtor are not, in and of\nthemselves, improper,” the court did note that “whether this is the first\nor subsequent filin[g]” by the debtor is one among the “totality of the\ncircumstances” to be considered in a good-faith analysis.

The debtor in the case at hand had\nfiled three previous Chapter 13 petitions, “each on the eve of a sched\nuled foreclosure,” and according to the court “never had any intention of\nfollowing through with any of the Chapter 13 cases,” but had used the\nbankruptcy process “to hold [his creditor] hostage, while remaining in\nhis residence without paying for it.” Id., at 520–521.\n   7 The Court also notes that the Code precludes a debtor who has had\n\na case pending in the last 180 days from refiling if his prior case was\ndismissed because he willfully failed to obey the court’s orders or to\nappear before the court, §109(g)(1), or if he voluntarily dismissed the\nprior suit “following the filing of a request for relief from the automatic\nstay” under §362, §109(g)(2). Ante, at 17, n. 7. But the Court does not\nexplain why these barriers have any bearing on whether refiling for\nbankruptcy would be abusive when the barriers do not apply.\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

The\nCourt declares this cold comfort, noting that some debt\nors—including Lanning—will have incomes too high to\nqualify for Chapter 7. Ante, at 17–18. Some such debtors,\nhowever, may be able to show “special circumstances,”\n§707(b)(2)(B), and still take advantage of Chapter 7. Aside\nfrom noting the absence of authority on the issue, the\nCourt’s answer is unsatisfyingly circular: It notes that the\nspecial-circumstances exception is available only if the\ndebtor has “no reasonable alternative,” §707(b)(2)(B)(i),\nwhich will not be true after today given the Court’s hold\ning that bankruptcy courts can consider changes in a\ndebtor’s income. As for those who cannot establish special\ncircumstances, it is hard to understand why there is cause\nfor concern. Congress has evidently concluded that such\ndebtors do not need the last-ditch relief of liquidation, and\nthat they are not suitable candidates for repaying their\ndebts (at least in part) under Chapter 13’s protective\numbrella. We have neither reason nor warrant to second\nguess either determination.\n                         *     *     *\n  Underlying the Court’s interpretation is an understand\nable urge: Sometimes the best reading of a text yields\nresults that one thinks must be a mistake, and bending\nthat reading just a little bit will allow all the pieces to fit\ntogether. But taking liberties with text in light of outcome\nmakes sense only if we assume that we know better than\nCongress which outcomes are mistaken. And by refusing\nto hold that Congress meant what it said, but see Con\nnecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253–254\n(1992), we deprive it of the ability to say what it means in\nthe future.     It may be that no interpretation of\n§1325(b)(1)(B) is entirely satisfying.

Argued March 22, 2010—Decided June 7, 2010\nDebtors filing for protection under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code\n must agree to a court-approved plan under which they pay creditors\n out of their future income. If the bankruptcy trustee or an unsecured\n creditor objects, a bankruptcy court may not approve the plan unless\n it provides for the full repayment of unsecured claims or “provides\n that all of the debtor’s projected disposable income to be received”\n over the plan’s duration “will be applied to make payments” in accor\n dance with plan terms. 11 U. S. C. §1325(b)(1). Before enactment of\n the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of\n 2005 (BAPCPA), the Code loosely defined “disposable income.”\n Though it did not define “projected disposable income,” most bank\n ruptcy courts calculated it using a mechanical approach, multiplying\n monthly income by the number of months in the plan and then de\n termining the “disposable” portion of the result. In exceptional cases,\n those courts also took into account foreseeable changes in a debtor’s\n income or expenses. BAPCPA defines “disposable income” as “cur\n rent monthly income received by the debtor” less “amounts reasona\n bly necessary to be expended” for, e.g., the debtor’s maintenance and\n support. §1325(b)(2)(A)(i). “Current monthly income,” in turn, is cal\n culated by averaging the debtor’s monthly income during a 6-month\n look-back period preceding the petition’s filing. See §101(10A)(A)(i).\n If a debtor’s income is below the median for his or her State,\n “amounts reasonably necessary” include the full amount needed for\n “maintenance or support,” see §1325(b)(2)(A)(i), but if the debtor’s in\n come exceeds the state median, only certain specified expenses are\n included, see §§707(b)(2), 1325(b)(3)(A).\n    A one-time buyout from respondent’s former employer caused her\n current monthly income for the six months preceding her Chapter 13\n2                       HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    petition to exceed her State’s median income. However, based on the\n    income from her new job, which was below the state median, and her\n    expenses, she reported a monthly disposable income of $149.03. She\n    thus filed a plan that would have required her to pay $144 per month\n    for 36 months. Petitioner, the Chapter 13 trustee, objected to confir\n    mation of the plan because the proposed payment amount was less\n    than the full amount of the claims against respondent, and because\n    she had not committed all of her “projected disposable income” to re\n    paying creditors. Petitioner claimed that the mechanical approach\n    was the proper way to calculate projected disposable income, and that\n    using that approach, respondent should pay $756 per month for 60\n    months. Her actual income was insufficient to make such payments.\n      The Bankruptcy Court endorsed a $144 payment over a 60-month\n    period, concluding that “projected” requires courts to consider the\n    debtor’s actual income. The Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate\n    Panel affirmed, as did the Tenth Circuit, which held that a court cal\n    culating “projected disposable income” should begin with the “pre\n    sumption” that the figure yielded by the mechanical approach is cor\n    rect, but that this figure may be rebutted by evidence of a substantial\n    change in the debtor’s circumstances.\nHeld: When a bankruptcy court calculates a debtor’s projected dispos\n able income, the court may account for changes in the debtor’s income\n or expenses that are known or virtually certain at the time of confir\n mation. Pp. 6–18.\n    (a) Respondent has the better interpretation of “projected dispos\n able income.” First, such a forward-looking approach is supported by\n the ordinary meaning of “projected.” See Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winter\n boer, 513 U. S. 179, 187. In ordinary usage future occurrences are\n not “projected” based on the assumption that the past will necessarily\n repeat itself. While a projection takes past events into account, ad\n justments are often made based on other factors that may affect the\n outcome. Second, “projected” appears in many federal statutes, yet\n Congress rarely uses it to mean simple multiplication. See, e.g., 7\n U. S. C. §1301(b)(8)(B). By contrast, as the Bankruptcy Code shows,\n Congress can make its mandate of simple multiplication unambigu\n ous—commonly using the term “multiplied.” See, e.g., 11 U. S. C.\n §1325(b)(3). Third, under pre-BAPCPA case law, the general rule\n was that courts would multiply a debtor’s current monthly income by\n the number of months in the commitment period as the first step in\n determining projected disposable income, but would also have discre\n tion to account for known or virtually certain changes in the debtor’s\n income. This is significant, since the Court “will not read the Bank\n ruptcy Code to erode past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indica\n tion that Congress intended such a departure,” Travelers Casualty &\n                   Cite as: 560 U.

S. 443, 454,\nand Congress did not amend the term “projected disposable income”\nin 2005. Pp. 6–10.\n   (b) The mechanical approach also clashes with §1325’s terms.\nFirst, §1325(b)(1)(B)’s reference to projected disposable income “to be\nreceived in the applicable commitment period” strongly favors the\nforward-looking approach. Because respondent would have far less\nthan $756 per month in disposable income during the plan period, pe\ntitioner’s projection does not accurately reflect disposable income “to\nbe received.” In such circumstances, the mechanical approach effec\ntively reads that phrase out of the statute. Second, §1325(b)(1)’s di\nrection to courts to determine projected disposable income “as of the\neffective date of the plan,”— i.e., the confirmation date—is more con\nsistent with the view that they are to consider postfiling information\nabout a debtor’s financial situation. Had Congress intended for pro\njected disposable income to be no more than a multiple of disposable\nincome, it could have specified the plan’s filing date as the effective\ndate. Third, §1325(b)(1)(B)’s requirement that projected disposable\nincome “will be applied to make payments” is rendered a hollow\ncommand if, as of the plan’s effective date, the debtor lacks the\nmeans to pay creditors in the calculated monthly amounts. Pp. 11–\n12.\n   (c) The arguments supporting the mechanical approach are unper\nsuasive. The claim that the Code’s detailed and precise “disposable\nincome” definition would have no purpose without the mechanical\napproach overlooks the important role that this statutory formula\nplays under the forward-looking approach, which begins with a dis\nposable income calculation. The Tenth Circuit’s rebuttable “pre\nsumption” analysis simply heeds the ordinary meaning of “projected.”\nThis Court rejects petitioner’s argument that only the mechanical\napproach is consistent with §1129(a)(15)(B), which refers to “pro\njected disposable income of the debtor (as defined in section\n1325(b)(2)).” And the Court declines to infer from the fact that\n§1325(b)(3) incorporates §707—which allows courts to consider “spe\ncial circumstances,” but only with respect to calculating expenses—\nthat Congress intended to eliminate, sub silentio, the discretion that\ncourts previously exercised to account for known or virtually certain\nchanges. Pp. 12–14.\n   (d) Petitioner’s proposed strategies for avoiding or mitigating the\nharsh results that the mechanical approach may produce for debt\nors—a debtor could delay filing a petition so as to place any extraor\ndinary income outside the 6-month period; a debtor with unusually\nhigh income during that period could seek leave to delay filing a\nschedule of current income and ask the bankruptcy court to select a\n4                       HAMILTON v.

S. C. §§101(30),\n109(e). Unlike debtors who file under Chapter 7 and must\nliquidate their nonexempt assets in order to pay creditors,\nsee §§704(a)(1), 726, Chapter 13 debtors are permitted to\nkeep their property, but they must agree to a court­\napproved plan under which they pay creditors out of their\nfuture income, see §§1306(b), 1321, 1322(a)(1), 1328(a). A\nbankruptcy trustee oversees the filing and execution of a\nChapter 13 debtor’s plan. §1322(a)(1); see also 28 U. S. C.\n§586(a)(3).\n   Section 1325 of Title 11 specifies circumstances under\nwhich a bankruptcy court “shall” and “may not” confirm a\nplan. §1325(a),(b). If an unsecured creditor or the bank­\nruptcy trustee objects to confirmation, §1325(b)(1) requires\nthe debtor either to pay unsecured creditors in full or to\npay all “projected disposable income” to be received by the\ndebtor over the duration of the plan.\n2                  HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  We granted certiorari to decide how a bankruptcy court\nshould calculate a debtor’s “projected disposable income.”\nSome lower courts have taken what the parties term the\n“mechanical approach,” while most have adopted what has\nbeen called the “forward-looking approach.” We hold that\nthe “forward-looking approach” is correct.\n                              I\n   As previously noted, §1325 provides that if a trustee or\nan unsecured creditor objects to a Chapter 13 debtor’s\nplan, a bankruptcy court may not approve the plan unless\nit provides for the full repayment of unsecured claims or\n“provides that all of the debtor’s projected disposable\nincome to be received” over the duration of the plan “will\nbe applied to make payments” in accordance with the\nterms of the plan. 11 U. S. C. §1325(b)(1); see also\n§1325(b)(1) (2000 ed.). Before the enactment of the Bank­\nruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of\n2005 (BAPCPA), 119 Stat. 23, the Bankruptcy Code (Code)\nloosely defined “disposable income” as “income which is\nreceived by the debtor and which is not reasonably neces­\nsary to be expended” for the “maintenance or support of\nthe debtor,” for qualifying charitable contributions, or for\nbusiness expenditures. §1325(b)(2)(A), (B).\n   The Code did not define the term “projected disposable\nincome,” and in most cases, bankruptcy courts used a\nmechanical approach in calculating projected disposable\nincome. That is, they first multiplied monthly income by\nthe number of months in the plan and then determined\nwhat portion of the result was “excess” or “disposable.”\nSee 2 K. Lundin, Chapter 13 Bankruptcy §164.1, p. 164–1,\nand n. 4 (3d ed. 2000) (hereinafter Lundin (2000 ed.))\n(citing cases).\n   In exceptional cases, however, bankruptcy courts took\ninto account foreseeable changes in a debtor’s income or\nexpenses.

App. Panel CA9 1995); In re Richardson, 283\nB. R. 783, 799 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Kan. 2002); Tr. of Oral Arg. 7.\nAccord, 1 Lundin §35.10, at 35–14 (2000 ed.) (“The debtor\nshould take some care to project estimated future income\non Schedule I to include anticipated increases or decreases\n[in income] so that the schedule will be consistent with\nany evidence of income the debtor would offer at a con­\ntested confirmation hearing”).\n   BAPCPA left the term “projected disposable income”\nundefined but specified in some detail how “disposable\nincome” is to be calculated. “Disposable income” is now\ndefined as “current monthly income received by the\ndebtor” less “amounts reasonably necessary to be ex­\npended” for the debtor’s maintenance and support, for\nqualifying charitable contributions, and for business ex­\npenditures. §1325(b)(2)(A)(i) and (ii) (2006 ed.). “Current\nmonthly income,” in turn, is calculated by averaging the\ndebtor’s monthly income during what the parties refer to\nas the 6-month look-back period, which generally consists\nof the six full months preceding the filing of the bank­\nruptcy petition.     See §101(10A)(A)(i).1      The phrase\n“amounts reasonably necessary to be expended” in\n§1325(b)(2) is also newly defined. For a debtor whose\nincome is below the median for his or her State, the\nphrase includes the full amount needed for “maintenance\nor support,” see §1325(b)(2)(A)(i), but for a debtor with\nincome that exceeds the state median, only certain speci­\nfied expenses are included,2 see §§707(b)(2), 1325(b)(3)(A).\n——————\n  1 However,  if a debtor does not file the required schedule (Schedule I),\nthe bankruptcy court may select a different 6-month period. See\n§101(10A)(A)(ii).\n  2 The formula for above-median-income debtors is known as the\n\n“means test” and is reflected in a schedule (Form 22C) that a Chapter\n13 debtor must file. See Fed.

In the six months before her filing, she received a\none-time buyout from her former employer, and this pay­\nment greatly inflated her gross income for April 2006 (to\n$11,990.03) and for May 2006 (to $15,356.42). App. 84,\n107. As a result of these payments, respondent’s current\nmonthly income, as averaged from April through October\n2006, was $5,343.70—a figure that exceeds the median\nincome for a family of one in Kansas. See id., at 78. Re­\nspondent’s monthly expenses, calculated pursuant to\n§707(b)(2), were $4,228.71. Id., at 83. She reported a\nmonthly “disposable income” of $1,114.98 on Form 22C.\nIbid.\n   On the form used for reporting monthly income (Sched­\nule I), she reported income from her new job of $1,922 per\nmonth—which is below the state median. Id., at 66; see\nalso id., at 78. On the form used for reporting monthly\nexpenses (Schedule J), she reported actual monthly ex­\npenses of $1,772.97. Id., at 68. Subtracting the Schedule\nJ figure from the Schedule I figure resulted in monthly\ndisposable income of $149.03.\n   Respondent filed a plan that would have required her to\npay $144 per month for 36 months. See id., at 93. Peti­\ntioner, a private Chapter 13 trustee, objected to confirma­\ntion of the plan because the amount respondent proposed\nto pay was less than the full amount of the claims against\nher, see §1325(b)(1)(A), and because, in petitioner’s view,\nrespondent was not committing all of her “projected dis­\nposable income” to the repayment of creditors, see\n§1325(b)(1)(B). According to petitioner, the proper way to\ncalculate projected disposable income was simply to mul­\ntiply disposable income, as calculated on Form 22C, by the\nnumber of months in the commitment period.

Id., at 108.\nThere is no dispute that respondent’s actual income was\ninsufficient to make payments in that amount. Tr. of Oral\nArg. 3–4.\n                              B\n   The Bankruptcy Court endorsed respondent’s proposed\nmonthly payment of $144 but required a 60-month plan\nperiod. No. 06–41037 etc., 2007 WL 1451999, *8 (Bkrtcy.\nCt. Kan. 2007). The court agreed with the majority view\nthat the word “projected” in §1325(b)(1)(B) requires courts\n“to consider at confirmation the debtor’s actual income as\nit was reported on Schedule I.” Id., at *5 (emphasis\nadded). This conclusion was warranted by the text of\n§1325(b)(1), the Bankruptcy Court reasoned, and was\nnecessary to avoid the absurd result of denying bank­\nruptcy protection to individuals with deteriorating fi­\nnances in the six months before filing. Ibid.\n   Petitioner appealed to the Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy\nAppellate Panel, which affirmed. 380 B. R. 17, 19 (2007).\nThe Panel noted that, although Congress redefined “dis­\nposable income” in 2005, it chose not to alter the pre­\nexisting term “projected disposable income.” Id., at 24.\nThus, the Panel concluded, there was no reason to believe\nthat Congress intended to alter the pre-BAPCPA practice\nunder which bankruptcy courts determined projected\ndisposable income by reference to Schedules I and J but\nconsidered other evidence when there was reason to be­\nlieve that the schedules did not reflect a debtor’s actual\nability to pay. Ibid.\n   The Tenth Circuit affirmed. 545 F. 3d 1269, 1270\n(2008). According to the Tenth Circuit, a court, in calcu­\nlating “projected disposable income,” should begin with the\n“presumption” that the figure yielded by the mechanical\n6                 HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\napproach is correct, but the Court concluded that this\nfigure may be rebutted by evidence of a substantial change\nin the debtor’s circumstances. Id., at 1278–1279.\n   This petition followed, and we granted certiorari. 558\nU.

Respondent, who favors the forward­\nlooking approach, agrees that the method outlined by\npetitioner should be determinative in most cases, but she\nargues that in exceptional cases, where significant\nchanges in a debtor’s financial circumstances are known or\nvirtually certain, a bankruptcy court has discretion to\nmake an appropriate adjustment. Respondent has the\nstronger argument.\n   First, respondent’s argument is supported by the ordi­\nnary meaning of the term “projected.” “When terms used\nin a statute are undefined, we give them their ordinary\nmeaning.” Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179,\n187 (1995). Here, the term “projected” is not defined, and\nin ordinary usage future occurrences are not “projected”\nbased on the assumption that the past will necessarily\nrepeat itself. For example, projections concerning a com­\npany’s future sales or the future cash flow from a license\ntake into account anticipated events that may change past\ntrends. See, e.g., Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights,\nLtd., 551 U. S. 308, 316 (2007) (describing adjustments to\n“projected sales” in light of falling demand); Innovair\nAviation, Ltd. v. United States, 83 Fed. Cl. 498, 502, 504–\n506 (2008) (calculating projected cash flow and noting that\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                      7\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\npast sales are “not necessarily the number of sales” that\nwill be made in the future). On the night of an election,\nexperts do not “project” the percentage of the votes that a\ncandidate will receive by simply assuming that the candi­\ndate will get the same percentage as he or she won in the\nfirst few reporting precincts. And sports analysts do not\nproject that a team’s winning percentage at the end of a\nnew season will be the same as the team’s winning per­\ncentage last year or the team’s winning percentage at the\nend of the first month of competition. While a projection\ntakes past events into account, adjustments are often\nmade based on other factors that may affect the final\noutcome. See In re Kibbe, 361 B. R. 302, 312, n. 9 (Bkrtcy.\nApp. Panel CA1 2007) (contrasting “multiplied,” which\n“requires only mathematical acumen,” with “projected,”\nwhich requires “mathematic acumen adjusted by delibera­\ntion and discretion”).\n   Second, the word “projected” appears in many federal\nstatutes, yet Congress rarely has used it to mean simple\nmultiplication. For example, the Agricultural Adjustment\nAct of 1938 defined “projected national yield,” “projected\ncounty yield,” and “projected farm yield” as entailing\nhistorical averages “adjusted for abnormal weather condi­\ntions,” “trends in yields,” and “any significant changes in\nproduction practices.” 7 U. S. C. §1301(b)(8)(B), (13)(J),\n(K).3\n——————\n  3 See also, e.g., 8 U. S. C. §1364(a), (c)(2) (requiring the triennial im­\nmigration-impact report to include information “projected for the\nsucceeding five-year period, based on reasonable estimates substanti­\nated by the best available evidence”); 10 U. S. C. A. §2433a(a)(2)(B)\n(2010 Cum. Supp.) (“projected cost of completing the [defense acquisi­\ntion] program based on reasonable modification of [current] require­\nments”); 15 U. S. C. §719c(c)(2) (2006 ed.) (“projected natural gas supply\nand demand”); 25 U. S. C. §2009(c)(1), (2) (requiring the Director of the\nOffice of Indian Education Programs to submit an annual report\ncontaining certain projections and “a description of the methods and\nformulas used to calculate the amounts projected”).\n8                  HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   By contrast, we need look no further than the Bank­\nruptcy Code to see that when Congress wishes to mandate\nsimple multiplication, it does so unambiguously—most\ncommonly by using the term “multiplied.” See, e.g., 11\nU. S. C. §1325(b)(3) (“current monthly income, when mul­\ntiplied by 12”); §§704(b)(2), 707(b)(6), (7)(A) (same);\n§707(b)(2)(A)(i), (B)(iv) (“multiplied by 60”). Accord, 2\nU. S. C. §58(b)(1)(B) (“multiplied by the number of months\nin such year”); 5 U. S. C. §8415(a) (“multiplied by such\nindividual’s total service”); 42 U. S. C. §403(f)(3) (“multi­\nplied by the number of months in such year”).\n   Third, pre-BAPCPA case law points in favor of the\n“forward-looking” approach. Prior to BAPCPA, the gen­\neral rule was that courts would multiply a debtor’s current\nmonthly income by the number of months in the commit­\nment period as the first step in determining projected\ndisposable income. See, e.g., In re Killough, 900 F. 2d 61,\n62–63 (CA5 1990) (per curiam); In re Anderson, 21 F. 3d\n355, 357 (CA9 1994); In re Solomon, 67 F. 3d 1128, 1132\n(CA4 1995). See 2 Lundin §164.1, at 164–1 (2000 ed.)\n(“Most courts focus on the debtor’s current income and\nextend current income (and expenditures) over the life of\nthe plan to calculate projected disposable income”). But\ncourts also had discretion to account for known or virtu­\nally certain changes in the debtor’s income. See Heath,\n182 B. R., at 559–561; Richardson, 283 B. R., at 799; In re\nJames, 260 B. R. 498, 514–515 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Idaho 2001);\nIn re Jobe, 197 B. R. 823, 826–827 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Tex.\n1996); In re Crompton, 73 B. R. 800, 808 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED\nPa. 1987); see also In re Schyma, 68 B. R. 52, 63 (Bkrtcy.\nCt. Minn. 1985) (“[T]he prospect of dividends . . . is not so\ncertain as to require Debtors or the Court to consider them\nas regular or disposable income”); In re Krull, 54 B. R. 375,\n378 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Colo. 1985) (“Since there are no changes\nin income which can be clearly foreseen, the Court must\nsimply multiply the debtor’s current disposable income by\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

See 8 Collier on Bankruptcy\n¶1325.08[4][a], p. 1325–50 (15th ed. rev. 2004) (hereinaf­\nter Collier) (“As a practical matter, unless there are\nchanges which can be clearly foreseen, the court must\nsimply multiply the debtor’s known monthly income by 36\nand determine whether the amount to be paid under the\nplan equals or exceeds that amount” (emphasis added)); 3\nW. Norton, Bankruptcy Law and Practice §75.10, p. 64\n(1991) (“It has been held that the court should focus upon\npresent monthly income and expenditures and, absent\nextraordinary circumstances, project these current\namounts over the life of the plan to determine projected\ndisposable income” (emphasis added)); 2 Lundin §164.1, at\n164–28 to 164–31 (2000 ed.) (describing how reported\ndecisions treated anticipated changes in income, particu­\nlarly where such changes were “too speculative to be pro­\njected”); see also In re Greer, 388 B. R. 889, 892 (Bkrtcy.\n——————\n   4 When pre-BAPCPA courts declined to make adjustments based on\n\npossible changes in a debtor’s future income or expenses, they did so\nbecause the changes were not sufficiently foreseeable, not because they\nconcluded that they lacked discretion to depart from a strictly mechani­\ncal approach. In In re Solomon, 67 F. 3d 1128 (1995), for example, the\nFourth Circuit refused to make such an adjustment because it deemed\ndisbursements from an individual retirement account during the plan\nperiod to be “speculative” and “hypothetical.” Id., at 1132. There is no\nreason to assume that the result would have been the same if future\ndisbursements had been more assured. That was certainly true of In re\nKillough, 900 F. 2d 61 (1990), in which the Fifth Circuit declined to\nrequire inclusion of overtime pay in projected disposable income be­\ncause it “was not definite enough.” Id., at 65; see also id., at 66\n(“[T]here may be instances where income obtained through working\novertime can and should appropriately be included in a debtor’s pro­\njected disposable income”). See also Education Assistance Corp. v.\nZellner, 827 F. 2d 1222, 1226 (CA8 1987) (affirming bankruptcy court’s\nexclusion of future tax returns and salary increases from debtor’s\nprojected disposable income because they were “speculative”).\n10                 HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCt. CD Ill. 2008) (“ ‘As a practical matter, unless there are\nchanges which can be clearly foreseen, the court must\nsimply multiply the debtor’s current monthly income by\nthirty-six’ ” (quoting 5 Collier ¶1325.08[4][a] (15th ed. rev.\n1995))); James, supra, at 514 (same) (quoting 8 Collier\n¶1325.08[4][a] (15th ed. rev. 2000)); Crompton, supra, at\n808 (same) (citing 5 Collier ¶1325.08[4][a], [b], at 1325–47\nto 1325–48 (15th ed. 1986)).

Indeed, petitioner\nconcedes that courts possessed this discretion prior to\nBAPCPA. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7.\n   Pre-BAPCPA bankruptcy practice is telling because we\n“ ‘will not read the Bankruptcy Code to erode past bank­\nruptcy practice absent a clear indication that Congress\nintended such a departure.’ ” Travelers Casualty & Surety\nCo. of America v. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co., 549 U. S. 443,\n454 (2007); Lamie v. United States Trustee, 540 U. S. 526,\n539 (2004); Cohen v. de la Cruz, 523 U. S. 213, 221 (1998);\nsee also Grogan v. Garner, 498 U. S. 279, 290 (1991); Kelly\nv. Robinson, 479 U. S. 36, 47 (1986). Congress did not\namend the term “projected disposable income” in 2005,\nand pre-BAPCPA bankruptcy practice reflected a widely\nacknowledged and well-documented view that courts may\ntake into account known or virtually certain changes to\ndebtors’ income or expenses when projecting disposable\nincome. In light of this historical practice, we would ex­\npect that, had Congress intended for “projected” to carry a\nspecialized—and indeed, unusual—meaning in Chapter\n13, Congress would have said so expressly. Cf., e.g., 26\nU. S. C. §279(c)(3)(A), (B) (expressly defining “projected\nearnings” as reflecting a 3-year historical average).\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               B\n   The mechanical approach also clashes repeatedly with\nthe terms of 11 U. S. C. §1325.\n   First, §1325(b)(1)(B)’s reference to projected disposable\nincome “to be received in the applicable commitment\nperiod” strongly favors the forward-looking approach.\nThere is no dispute that respondent would in fact receive\nfar less than $756 per month in disposable income during\nthe plan period, so petitioner’s projection does not accu­\nrately reflect “income to be received” during that period.\nSee In re Nowlin, 576 F. 3d 258, 263 (CA5 2009). The\nmechanical approach effectively reads this phrase out of\nthe statute when a debtor’s current disposable income is\nsubstantially higher than the income that the debtor\npredictably will receive during the plan period. See\nKawaauhau v. Geiger, 523 U. S. 57, 62 (1998) (“[W]e are\nhesitant to adopt an interpretation of a congressional\nenactment which renders superfluous another portion of\nthat same law” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   Second, §1325(b)(1) directs courts to determine projected\ndisposable income “as of the effective date of the plan,”\nwhich is the date on which the plan is confirmed and\nbecomes binding, see §1327(a). Had Congress intended for\nprojected disposable income to be nothing more than a\nmultiple of disposable income in all cases, we see no rea­\nson why Congress would not have required courts to de­\ntermine that value as of the filing date of the plan. See\nFed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3015(b) (requiring that a plan be\nfiled within 14 days of the filing of a petition), online at\nhttp://www.uscourts.gov/RulesAndPolicies/FederalRulema\nking/Overview/BankruptcyRules.aspx (all Internet mate­\nrials as visited June 3, 2010, and available in Clerk of\nCourt’s case file). In the very next section of the Code, for\nexample, Congress specified that a debtor shall commence\npayments “not later than 30 days after the date of the\nfiling of the plan.” §1326(a)(1) (emphasis added). Con­\n12                HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngress’ decision to require courts to measure projected\ndisposable income “as of the effective date of the plan” is\nmore consistent with the view that Congress expected\ncourts to consider postfiling information about the debtor’s\nfinancial circumstances.        See 545 F. 3d, at 1279\n(“[D]etermining whether or not a debtor has committed all\nprojected disposable income to repayment of the unsecured\ncreditors ‘as of the effective date of the plan’ suggests\nconsideration of the debtor’s actual financial circum­\nstances as of the effective date of the plan”).\n   Third, the requirement that projected disposable income\n“will be applied to make payments” is most naturally read\nto contemplate that the debtor will actually pay creditors\nin the calculated monthly amounts. §1325(b)(1)(B). But\nwhen, as of the effective date of a plan, the debtor lacks\nthe means to do so, this language is rendered a hollow\ncommand.\n                             C\n   The arguments advanced in favor of the mechanical\napproach are unpersuasive. Noting that the Code now\nprovides a detailed and precise definition of “disposable\nincome,” proponents of the mechanical approach maintain\nthat any departure from this method leaves that definition\n“ ‘with no apparent purpose.’ ” In re Kagenveama, 541 F.\n3d 868, 873 (CA9 2008). This argument overlooks the\nimportant role that the statutory formula for calculating\n“disposable income” plays under the forward-looking\napproach. As the Tenth Circuit recognized in this case, a\ncourt taking the forward-looking approach should begin by\ncalculating disposable income, and in most cases, nothing\nmore is required. It is only in unusual cases that a court\nmay go further and take into account other known or\nvirtually certain information about the debtor’s future\n                    Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nincome or expenses.5\n  Petitioner faults the Tenth Circuit for referring to a\nrebuttable “presumption” that the figure produced by the\nmechanical approach accurately represents a debtor’s\n“projected disposable income.” See 545 F. 3d, at 1278–\n1279. Petitioner notes that the Code makes no reference\nto any such presumption but that related Code provisions\nexpressly create other rebuttable presumptions.         See\n§707(b)(2)(A)(i) and (B)(i). He thus suggests that the\nTenth Circuit improperly supplemented the text of the\nCode.\n  The Tenth Circuit’s analysis, however, simply heeds the\nordinary meaning of the term “projected.” As noted, a\nperson making a projection uses past occurrences as a\nstarting point, and that is precisely what the Tenth Cir­\ncuit prescribed. See, e.g., Nowlin, supra, at 260, 263.\n  Petitioner argues that only the mechanical approach is\nconsistent with §1129(a)(15)(B), which refers to “projected\ndisposable income of the debtor (as defined in section\n1325(b)(2)).”    This cross-reference, petitioner argues,\nshows that Congress intended for the term “projected\ndisposable income” to incorporate, presumably in all con­\ntexts, the defined term “disposable income.” It is evident\nthat §1129(a)(15)(B) refers to the defined term “dis-\nposable income,” see §1325(b)(2), but that fact offers\nno insight into the meaning of the word “projected”\nin §§1129(a)(15)(B) and 1325(b)(1)(B). We fail to see\nhow that word acquires a specialized meaning as a\nresult of this cross-reference—particularly where both\n§§1129(a)(15)(B) and 1325(b)(1)(B) refer to projected dis­\nposable income “to be received” during the relevant period.\nSee supra, at 11.\n——————\n  5 For the same reason, the phrase “[f]or purposes of this subsection”\n\nin §1325(b)(2) is not rendered superfluous by the forward-looking\napproach.\n14                HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Petitioner also notes that §707 allows courts to take\n“special circumstances” into consideration, but that\n§1325(b)(3) incorporates §707 only with respect to calcu­\nlating expenses. See In re Wilson, 397 B. R. 299, 314–315\n(Bkrtcy. Ct. MDNC 2008). Thus, he argues, a “special\ncircumstances” exception should not be inferred with\nrespect to the debtor’s income. We decline to infer from\n§1325’s incorporation of §707 that Congress intended to\neliminate, sub silentio, the discretion that courts previ­\nously exercised when projecting disposable income to\naccount for known or virtually certain changes. Accord,\nIn re Liverman, 383 B. R. 604, 613, and n. 15 (Bkrtcy. Ct.\nNJ 2008).\n                            D\n   In cases in which a debtor’s disposable income during\nthe 6-month look-back period is either substantially lower\nor higher than the debtor’s disposable income during the\nplan period, the mechanical approach would produce\nsenseless results that we do not think Congress intended.\nIn cases in which the debtor’s disposable income is higher\nduring the plan period, the mechanical approach would\ndeny creditors payments that the debtor could easily\nmake. And where, as in the present case, the debtor’s\ndisposable income during the plan period is substantially\nlower, the mechanical approach would deny the protection\nof Chapter 13 to debtors who meet the chapter’s main\neligibility requirements. Here, for example, respondent is\nan “individual whose income is sufficiently stable and\nregular” to allow her “to make payments under a plan,”\n§101(30), and her debts fall below the limits set out in\n§109(e). But if the mechanical approach were used, she\ncould not file a confirmable plan. Under §1325(a)(6), a\nplan cannot be confirmed unless “the debtor will be able to\nmake all payments under the plan and comply with the\nplan.” And as petitioner concedes, respondent could not\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

He\nproposes no comparable strategies for creditors harmed by\nthe mechanical approach, and in any event none of the\nmaneuvers that he proposes for debtors is satisfactory.\n                               1\n   Petitioner first suggests that a debtor may delay filing a\npetition so as to place any extraordinary income outside\nthe 6-month look-back period. We see at least two prob­\nlems with this proposal.\n   First, delay is often not a viable option for a debtor\nsliding into bankruptcy.\n      “Potential Chapter 13 debtors typically find a law­\n    yer’s office when they are one step from financial\n    Armageddon: There is a foreclosure sale of the\n    debtor’s home the next day; the debtor’s only car\n    was mysteriously repossessed in the dark of last\n    night; a garnishment has reduced the debtor’s\n    take-home pay below the ordinary requirements\n    of food and rent.       Instantaneous relief is ex-\n    pected, if not necessary.” K. Lundin & W.

See 11 U. S. C. §1325(a)(7) (requiring,\nas a condition of confirmation, that “the action of the\ndebtor in filing the petition was in good faith”); see also,\n16                     HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ne.g., In re Myers, 491 F. 3d 120, 125 (CA3 2007) (citing\n“ ‘the timing of the petition’ ” as a factor to be considered in\nassessing a debtor’s compliance with the good-faith re­\nquirement). Accord, Neufeld v. Freeman, 794 F. 2d 149,\n153 (CA4 1986) (a debtor’s prepetition conduct may inform\nthe court’s good-faith inquiry).\n                             2\n  Petitioner next argues that a debtor with unusually\nhigh income during the 6 months prior to the filing of a\npetition, could seek leave to delay filing a schedule of\ncurrent income (Schedule I) and then ask the bankruptcy\ncourt to exercise its authority under §101(10A)(A)(ii) to\nselect a 6-month period that is more representative of the\ndebtor’s future disposable income. We see little merit in\nthis convoluted strategy. If the Code required the use of\nthe mechanical approach in all cases, this strategy would\nimproperly undermine what the Code demands. And if, as\nwe believe, the Code does not insist upon rigid adherence\nto the mechanical approach in all cases, this strategy is\nnot needed. In any event, even if this strategy were al­\nlowed, it would not help all debtors whose disposable\nincome during the plan period is sharply lower than their\nprevious disposable income.6\n                             3\n   Petitioner suggests that a debtor can dismiss the peti­\ntion and refile at a later, more favorable date. But peti­\ntioner offers only the tepid assurance that courts “gener­\nally” do not find this practice to be abusive. Brief for\nPetitioner 53.

The\navailability of Chapter 7 to debtors like respondent who\nhave above-median incomes is limited. In respondent’s\ncase, a presumption of abuse would attach under\n§707(b)(2)(A)(i) because her disposable income, “multiplied\nby 60,” exceeds the amounts specified in subclauses (I) and\n(II). See also §707(b)(1) (allowing a court to dismiss a\npetition filed by a debtor “whose debts are primarily con­\nsumer debts . . . if it finds that the granting of relief would\nbe an abuse of the provisions of this chapter”); App. 86–88\n(“Notice to Individual Consumer Debtor under §342(b) of\nthe Bankruptcy Code”) (“If your income is greater than the\nmedian income for your state of residence and family size,\nin some cases, creditors have the right to file a motion\nrequesting that the court dismiss your case under §707(b)\nof the Code”).

S. C. §1325(b)(1)(B). The Code provides a formula for\n“project[ing]” what a debtor’s “disposable income” will be,\nwhich so far as his earnings are concerned turns only on\nhis past income. The Court concludes that this formula\nshould not apply in “exceptional cases” where “known or\nvirtually certain” changes in the debtor’s circumstances\nmake it a poor predictor. Ante, at 6. Because that conclu\nsion is contrary to the Code’s text, I respectfully dissent.\n                              I\n                              A\n  A bankruptcy court cannot confirm a Chapter 13 plan\nover the objection of the trustee unless, as of the plan’s\neffective date, either (A) the property to be distributed on\naccount of the unsecured claim at issue exceeds its amount\nor (B) the “the plan provides that all of the debtor’s pro\njected disposable income to be received in the applicable\ncommitment period beginning on the date that the first\npayment is due under the plan will be applied to make\n2                     HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                        SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\npayments to unsecured creditors under the plan.”\n§1325(b)(1)(B). The Code does not define “projected dis\nposable income,” but it does define “disposable income.”\nThe next paragraph of §1325(b) provides that “[f]or pur\nposes of this subsection, the term ‘disposable income’\nmeans current monthly income received by the debtor,”\nexcluding certain payments received for child support,\n“less amounts reasonably necessary to be expended” on\nthree categories of expenses. §1325(b)(2). The Code in\nturn defines “current monthly income” as “the average\nmonthly income from all sources that the debtor re\nceives . . . derived during the 6-month period ending on”\none of two dates.1 §101(10A)(A). Whichever date applies,\na debtor’s “current monthly income,” and thus the income\ncomponent of his “disposable income,” is a sum certain, a\nrate fixed once for all based on historical figures.\n   This definition of “disposable income” applies to the use\nof that term in the longer phrase “projected disposable\nincome” in §1325(b)(1)(B), since the definition says that it\napplies to subsection (b). Cf. §1129(a)(15)(B) (referring to\n“the projected disposable income of the debtor (as defined\nin section 1325(b)(2))”). The puzzle is what to make of the\nword “projected.”\n   In the Court’s view, this modifier makes all the differ\nence. Projections, it explains, ordinarily account for later\ndevelopments, not just past data. Ante, at 6–7. Thus, the\nCourt concludes, in determining “projected disposable\nincome” a bankruptcy court may depart from §1325(b)(2)’s\n——————\n    1 If\n      the debtor files a schedule of current income, as ordinarily re\nquired by §521(a)(1)(B)(ii), then the 6-month period ends on the last\nday of the month preceding the date the case is commenced,\n§101(10A)(A)(i)—that is, when the petition is filed, §§301(a), 302(a),\n303(b). If the debtor does not file such a schedule on time—which the\nbankruptcy court apparently may excuse him from doing,\n§521(a)(1)(B)(ii)—the 6-month period ends on the date the bankruptcy\ncourt determines the debtor’s current income. §101(10A)(A)(ii).\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

Ante, at 6.\n   That interpretation runs aground because it either\nrenders superfluous text Congress included or requires\nadding text Congress did not. It would be pointless to\ndefine disposable income in such detail, based on data\nduring a specific 6-month period, if a court were free to set\nthe resulting figure aside whenever it appears to be a poor\npredictor. And since “disposable income” appears nowhere\nelse in §1325(b), then unless §1325(b)(2)’s definition ap\nplies to “projected disposable income” in §1325(b)(1)(B), it\ndoes not apply at all.\n   The Court insists its interpretation does not render\n§1325(b)(2)’s incorporation of “current monthly income” a\nnullity: A bankruptcy court must still begin with that\nfigure, but is simply free to fiddle with it if a “significant”\nchange in the debtor’s circumstances is “known or virtu\nally certain.” Ante, at 6, 12. That construction conven\niently avoids superfluity, but only by utterly abandoning\nthe text the Court purports to construe. Nothing in the\ntext supports treating the definition of disposable income\nCongress supplied as a suggestion. And even if the word\n“projected” did allow (or direct) a court to disregard\n§1325(b)(2)’s fixed formula and to consider other data,\nthere would be no basis in the text for the restrictions the\nCourt reads in, regarding when and to what extent a court\nmay (or must) do so. If the statute authorizes estimations,\nit authorizes them in every case, not just those where\nchanges to the debtor’s income are both “significant” and\neither “known or virtually certain.” Ibid. If the evidence\nindicates it is merely more likely than not that the\ndebtor’s income will increase by some minimal amount,\nthere is no reading of the word “projected” that permits (or\nrequires) a court to ignore that change. The Court, in\nshort, can arrive at its compromise construction only by\n4                  HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nrewriting the statute.\n                              B\n   The only reasonable reading that avoids deleting words\nCongress enacted, or adding others it did not, is this:\nSetting aside expenses excludable under §1325(b)(2)(A)\nand (B), which are not at issue here, a court must calcu\nlate the debtor’s “projected disposable income” by multi\nplying his current monthly income by the number of\nmonths in the “applicable commitment period.” The word\n“projected” in this context, I agree, most sensibly refers to\na calculation, prediction, or estimation of future events,\nsee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12–13 (col\nlecting dictionary definitions); see also Webster’s New\nInternational Dictionary 1978 (2d ed. 1957). But one\nassuredly can calculate, predict, or estimate future figures\nbased on the past. And here Congress has commanded\nthat a specific historical figure shall be the basis for the\nprojection.\n   The Court rejects this reading as unrealistic. A projec\ntion, the Court explains, may be based in part on past\ndata, but “adjustments are often made based on other\nfactors that may affect the final outcome.” Ante, at 7.\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results. No\ngambler would bet the farm using “project[ions]” that are\nbased only on a football team’s play before its star quar\nterback was injured. And no pundit would keep his post if\nhe “projected” election results relying only on prior cycles,\nignoring recent polls. So too, the Court appears to reason,\nit makes no sense to say a court “project[s]” a debtor’s\n“disposable income” when it considers only what he earned\nin a specific 6-month period in the past. Ante, at 6–7.\n   Such analogies do not establish that carrying current\nmonthly income forward to determine a debtor’s future\nability to pay is not a “projection.” They show only that\nrelying exclusively on past data for the projection may be a\n                   Cite as: 560 U.

One who is asked to predict future results, but\nis armed with no other information than prior perform\nance, can still make a projection; it may simply be off the\nmark. Congress, of course, could have tried to prevent\nthat possibility by prescribing, as it has done in other\ncontexts, that a debtor’s projected disposable income be\ndetermined based on the “best available evidence,” 8\nU. S. C. §1364(c)(2), or “any . . . relevant information,” 25\nU. S. C. §2009(c)(1). But it included no such prescription\nhere, and instead identified the data a court should con\nsider. Perhaps Congress concluded that other information\na bankruptcy court might consider is too uncertain or too\neasily manipulated. Or perhaps it thought the cost of\nconsidering such information outweighed the benefits. Cf.\n7 U. S. C. §1301(b)(13)(J)–(M) (requiring national and\nlocal “projected” yields of various crops to be adjusted only\nfor abnormal weather, trends in yields, and production\npractices, apparently to the exclusion of other presumably\nrelevant variables such as a sudden increase or decrease\nin the number of producers, farm subsidies, etc.). In all\nevents, neither the reasons for nor the wisdom of the\nprojection method Congress chose has any bearing on\nwhat the statute means.\n   The Court contends that if Congress really meant courts\nto multiply a static figure by a set number of months, it\nwould have used the word “multiplied,” as it has done\nelsewhere—indeed, elsewhere in the same subsection, see,\ne.g., 11 U. S. C. §1325(b)(3)—instead of the word “pro\njected.”2 Ante, at 8. I do not dispute that, as a general\nmatter, we should presume that Congress does not ordi\nnarily use two words in the same context to denote the\n——————\n  2 Of course, since the number of months in the commitment period\n\nmay vary, Congress could not simply have substituted a single word,\nbut would have had to write “disposable income multiplied by the\nnumber of months in the applicable commitment period” or some such\nphrase.\n6                      HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsame thing. But if forced to choose between (A) assuming\nCongress enacted text that serves no purpose at all, (B)\nascribing an unheard-of meaning to the word “projected”\n(loaded with made-to-order restrictions) simply to avoid\nundesirable results, or (C) assuming Congress employed\nsynonyms to express a single idea, the last is obviously the\nleast evil.\n   In any event, we are not put to that choice here. While\nunder my reading a court must determine the income half\nof the “projected disposable income” equation by multiply\ning a fixed number, that is not necessarily true of the\nexpenses excludable under §1325(b)(2)(A) and (B). Unlike\nthe debtor’s current monthly income, none of the three\ntypes of expenses—payments for the support of the debtor\nand his dependents, charitable contributions, and ex\npenses to keep an existing business above water—is ex\nplicitly defined in terms of historical figures (at least for\ndebtors with incomes below the state median). The first of\nthose cannot possibly (in many cases) be determined based\non the same 6-month period from which current monthly\nincome is derived,3 and the texts of the other two are\nconsistent with determining expenses based on expecta\ntions. See §1325(b)(2)(A)(ii) (charitable expenses to quali\nfied entities limited to “15 percent of gross income of the\ndebtor for the year in which the contributions are made”);\n§1325(b)(2)(B) (“expenditures necessary for the continua\ntion, preservation, and operation” of a business in which\nthe debtor is engaged).\n   In short, a debtor’s projected disposable income consists\nof two parts: one (current monthly income) that is fixed\n——————\n  3 For a debtor whose income is below the state median, excludable\n\nexpenses include domestic-support obligations “that first becom[e]\npayable after the date the petition is filed,” §1325(b)(2)(A)(i)—that is,\nafter the six-month window relevant to the debtor’s current monthly\nincome has closed (unless the debtor does not file a current-income\nschedule), see §101(10A)(A)(i).\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nonce for all based on historical data, and another (the\nenumerated expenses) that at least arguably depends on\nestimations of the debtor’s future circumstances. The\nstatute thus requires the court to predict the difference\nbetween two figures, each of which depends on the dura\ntion of the commitment period, and one of which also turns\npartly on facts besides historical data. In light of all this,\nit seems to me not at all unusual to describe this process\nas projection, not merely multiplication.\n                              C\n   The Court’s remaining arguments about the statute’s\nmeaning are easily dispatched. A “mechanical” reading of\nprojected disposable income, it contends, renders superflu\nous the phrase “to be received in the applicable commit\nment period” in §1325(b)(1)(B). Ante, at 11. Not at all.\nThat phrase defines the period for which a debtor’s dis\nposable income must be calculated (i.e., the period over\nwhich the projection extends), and thus the amount the\ndebtor must ultimately pay his unsecured creditors.\n   Similarly insubstantial is the Court’s claim regarding\nthe requirement that the plan provide that the debtor’s\nprojected disposable income “will be applied to make\npayments”      toward     unsecured    creditors’    claims,\n§1325(b)(1)(B). The Court says this requirement makes no\nsense unless the debtor is actually able to pay an amount\nequal to his projected disposable income. Ante, at 12. But\nit makes no sense only if one assumes that the debtor is\nentitled to confirmation in the first place; and that as\nsumption is wrong. The requirement that the debtor pay\nat least his projected disposable income is a prerequisite to\nconfirmation. The “will be applied” proviso does not re\nquire a debtor to pay what he cannot; it simply withholds\nChapter 13 relief when he cannot pay.\n   The Court also argues that §1325(b)(1)’s directive to\ndetermine projected disposable income “as of the effective\n8                  HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ndate of the plan” makes no sense if mere multiplication of\nexisting numbers is required. Ante, at 11–12. As I have\nexplained, however, “projected disposable income” may in\nsome cases require more than multiplication (as to ex\npenses), and the estimations involved may vary from the\ndate of the plan’s filing until the date it takes effect.\nMoreover, the provision also applies to the alternative\navenue to confirmation in §1325(b)(1)(A), which requires\nthat “the value of the property to be distributed under the\nplan” to an unsecured creditor equals or exceeds the credi\ntor’s claim. As to that requirement, the effective-date\nrequirement makes perfect sense.\n   Text aside, the Court also observes that Circuit practice\nprior to the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer\nProtection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), 119 Stat. 23, aligns\nwith the atextual approach the Court adopts today. Ante,\nat 8–10. That is unsurprising, since the prior version of\nthe relevant provisions was completely consistent with\nthat approach. The Court is correct that BAPCPA “did not\namend the term ‘projected disposable income,’ ” ante, at 10.\nBut it did amend the definition of that term. Before 2005,\n§1325(b)(2) defined “disposable income” simply as “income\nwhich is received by the debtor and which is not reasona\nbly necessary to be expended” on the same basic types of\nexpenses excluded by the current statute. §1325(b)(2)\n(2000 ed.). Nothing in that terse definition compelled a\ncourt to rely exclusively on past data, let alone a specific 6\nmonth period. But in BAPCPA—the same Act in which\nCongress defined “current monthly income” in\n§101(10A)(A)—Congress redefined “disposable income” in\n§1325(b)(2) to incorporate that backward-looking defini\ntion. See Pub. L. 109–8, §102(b), (h), 119 Stat. 32–34.\nGiven these significant changes, the fact that the Court’s\napproach conforms with pre-BAPCPA practice not only\ndoes not recommend it, see e.g., Pennsylvania Dept. of\nPublic Welfare v. Davenport, 495 U. S. 552, 563–564\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n(1990), but renders it suspect.\n                              II\n  Unable to assemble a compelling case based on what the\nstatute says, the Court falls back on the “senseless re\nsults” it would produce—results the Court “do[es] not\nthink Congress intended.” Ante, at 14. Even if it were\ntrue that a “mechanical” reading resulted in undesirable\noutcomes, that would make no difference. Lewis v. Chi\ncago, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 11). For even\nassuming (though I do not believe it) that we could know\nwhich results Congress thought it was achieving (or avoid\ning) apart from the only congressional expression of its\nthoughts, the text, those results would be entirely irrele\nvant to what the statute means.\n  In any event, the effects the Court fears are neither as\ninevitable nor as “senseless” as the Court portrays. The\nCourt’s first concern is that if actual or anticipated\nchanges in the debtor’s earnings are ignored, then a debtor\nwhose income increases after the critical 6-month window\nwill not be required to pay all he can afford. Ante, at 14.\nBut as Lanning points out, Brief for Respondent 22–23,\nChapter 13 authorizes the Bankruptcy Court, at the re\nquest of unsecured creditors, to modify the plan “[a]t any\ntime after confirmation” to “increase . . . the amount of\npayments” on a class of claims or “reduce the time for such\npayments.” §1329(a)(1)–(2) (2006 ed.). The Court offers\nno explanation of why modification would not be available\nin such instances, and sufficient to resolve the concern.\n  The Court also cringes at the prospect that a debtor\nwhose income suddenly declines after the 6-month window\nor who, as in this case, receives a one-off windfall during\nthat window, will be barred from Chapter 13 relief be\ncause he will be unable to devote his “disposable income”\n(which turns on his prior earnings) to paying his unse\ncured creditors going forward. Ante, at 14–15. At least for\n10                HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ndebtors whose circumstances deteriorate after confirma\ntion, however, the Code already provides an answer. Just\nas a creditor can request an upward modification in light\nof postconfirmation developments, so too can a debtor ask\nfor a downward adjustment. §1329(a). Cf. §1329(b)(1)\n(requiring that modifications meet requirements of\n§§1322(a)–(b), 1323(c), and 1325(a), but not §1325(b)).\n   Moreover, even apart from the availability of modifica\ntion it requires little imagination to see why Congress\nmight want to withhold relief from debtors whose situa\ntions have suddenly deteriorated (after or even toward the\nend of the 6-month window), or who in the midst of dire\nstraits have been blessed (within the 6-month window) by\nan influx of unusually high income. Bankruptcy protec\ntion is not a birthright, and Congress could reasonably\nconclude that those who have just hit the skids do not yet\nneed a reprieve from repaying their debts; perhaps they\nwill recover. And perhaps the debtor who has received a\none-time bonus will thereby be enabled to stay afloat.\nHow long to wait before throwing the debtor a lifeline is\ninherently a policy choice. Congress confined the calcula\ntion of current monthly income to a 6-month period (ordi\nnarily ending before the case is commenced), but it could\nhave picked 2 or 12 months (or a different end date) in\nstead. Whatever the wisdom of the window it chose, we\nshould not assume it did not know what it was doing and\naccordingly refuse to give effect to its words.\n   Even if one insists on making provision for such debtors,\nthe Court is wrong to write off four alternative strategies\nthe trustee suggests, Brief for Petitioner 50–54:\n   ● Presumably some debtors whose income has only\nrecently been reduced, or who have just received a jolt that\ncauses a temporary uptick in their average income, can\ndelay filing a Chapter 13 petition until their “current\nmonthly income” catches up with their present circum\nstances. The Court speculates that delay might “giv[e] the\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

See §101(10A)(A)(ii). The Court\ndismisses this alternative, explaining that if the Code\nrequires a mechanical approach this solution would “im\nproperly undermine” it, and if the Code allows exceptions\nfor changed circumstances the solution is unnecessary.\nAnte, at 16. The second premise is correct, but the first is\nnot. Congress does not pursue its purposes at all costs.\nRodriguez v. United States, 480 U. S. 522, 525–526 (1987)\n(per curiam). Here it may have struck the very balance\nthe Court thinks critical by creating a fixed formula but\nleaving leeway as to the time to which it applies.5\n——————\n  4 Neither of the two Court of Appeals cases the Court cites—In re\n\nMyers, 491 F. 3d 120, 125 (CA3 2007), and Neufeld v. Freeman, 794\nF. 2d 149, 153 (CA4 1986)—involved a debtor’s delaying his petition\nuntil his circumstances would permit the court to confirm a repayment\nplan.\n  5 The Court observes that not every debtor will benefit from this ex\n\nception, ante, at 16, and n. 6, since §521(i)(3) provides that a bank\nruptcy court may not grant a request (which may be made after the\ndeadline for filing the current-income schedule) for an extension of\nmore than 45 days to file such a schedule. But the statute appears to\nassume that a court may excuse the filing of such a schedule altogether:\nA debtor is required to file a schedule in the first instance “unless the\ncourt orders otherwise,” §521(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added).             And\n§101(10A)(A)(ii)’s provision of a method for calculating current monthly\nincome “if the debtor does not file the schedule of current income\nrequired by section 521(a)(1)(B)(ii)” makes little sense unless a court\ncan excuse the failure to do so, since an unexcused failure to do so\nwould be a basis for dismissing the case, see §521(i). Allowing courts to\nexcuse such schedules does not render superfluous §521(i)(3)’s authori\n12                     HAMILTON v.

The\nCourt worries that this alternative also might be deemed\nabusive, again with no pertinent authority for the specula\ntion.6 Its concern is based primarily on its belief that this\n“circumvents the statutory limits on a court’s ability to\nshift the look-back period.” Ante, at 16–17. That belief is\nmistaken, both because the Court exaggerates the statu\ntory limitations on adjusting the look-back period, and\nbecause, just as it does not defeat the disposable-income\nformula’s rigidity to allow adjustments regarding the time\nof determining that figure, it would not undermine the\nlimitations on adjustment applicable in a pending case to\nallow the debtor to dismiss and refile.7\n——————\nzation for limited extensions, since that applies to extensions sought up\nto 45 days after the filing deadline, whereas §521(a)(1)(B) seems to\napply only before the deadline.\n   6 The sole authority the Court supplies—a single Bankruptcy Court\n\ndecision predating BAPCPA—provides no support. See In re Glenn,\n288 B. R. 516, 519–521 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Tenn. 2002). Although ac\nknowledging that “[m]ultiple filings by a debtor are not, in and of\nthemselves, improper,” the court did note that “whether this is the first\nor subsequent filin[g]” by the debtor is one among the “totality of the\ncircumstances” to be considered in a good-faith analysis. Id., at 520\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The debtor in the case at hand had\nfiled three previous Chapter 13 petitions, “each on the eve of a sched\nuled foreclosure,” and according to the court “never had any intention of\nfollowing through with any of the Chapter 13 cases,” but had used the\nbankruptcy process “to hold [his creditor] hostage, while remaining in\nhis residence without paying for it.” Id., at 520–521.\n   7 The Court also notes that the Code precludes a debtor who has had\n\na case pending in the last 180 days from refiling if his prior case was\ndismissed because he willfully failed to obey the court’s orders or to\nappear before the court, §109(g)(1), or if he voluntarily dismissed the\nprior suit “following the filing of a request for relief from the automatic\nstay” under §362, §109(g)(2). Ante, at 17, n. 7. But the Court does not\nexplain why these barriers have any bearing on whether refiling for\nbankruptcy would be abusive when the barriers do not apply.\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            13\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   ● A debtor unable to pursue any of these avenues to\nChapter 13 might still seek relief under Chapter 7. The\nCourt declares this cold comfort, noting that some debt\nors—including Lanning—will have incomes too high to\nqualify for Chapter 7. Ante, at 17–18. Some such debtors,\nhowever, may be able to show “special circumstances,”\n§707(b)(2)(B), and still take advantage of Chapter 7. Aside\nfrom noting the absence of authority on the issue, the\nCourt’s answer is unsatisfyingly circular: It notes that the\nspecial-circumstances exception is available only if the\ndebtor has “no reasonable alternative,” §707(b)(2)(B)(i),\nwhich will not be true after today given the Court’s hold\ning that bankruptcy courts can consider changes in a\ndebtor’s income. As for those who cannot establish special\ncircumstances, it is hard to understand why there is cause\nfor concern. Congress has evidently concluded that such\ndebtors do not need the last-ditch relief of liquidation, and\nthat they are not suitable candidates for repaying their\ndebts (at least in part) under Chapter 13’s protective\numbrella. We have neither reason nor warrant to second\nguess either determination.\n                         *     *     *\n  Underlying the Court’s interpretation is an understand\nable urge: Sometimes the best reading of a text yields\nresults that one thinks must be a mistake, and bending\nthat reading just a little bit will allow all the pieces to fit\ntogether. But taking liberties with text in light of outcome\nmakes sense only if we assume that we know better than\nCongress which outcomes are mistaken. And by refusing\nto hold that Congress meant what it said, but see Con\nnecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253–254\n(1992), we deprive it of the ability to say what it means in\nthe future.     It may be that no interpretation of\n§1325(b)(1)(B) is entirely satisfying. But it is in the hard\ncases, even more than the easy ones, that we should faith\n14                HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nfully apply our settled interpretive principles, and trust\nthat Congress will correct the law if what it previously\nprescribed is wrong.\n  I respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/147953/", "sha1": "3e9f45d8cf9618fb80e33aaf92d260d57b949f0a", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-06-07T07:37:43"}
