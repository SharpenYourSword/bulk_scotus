THOMAS, WARDEN\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 09–5201. Argued March 30, 2010—Decided June 7, 2010\nThe federal sentencing statute at issue provides that a “prisoner . . .\n  serving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year . . . may receive\n  credit toward the service of [that] sentence . . . of up to 54 days at the\n  end of each year” subject to the Bureau of Prison’s (BOP) “determina\n  tion . . . that, during that year, the prisoner” has behaved in an ex\n  emplary fashion. 18 U. S. C. §3624(b)(1). Credit “for the last year or\n  portion of a year of the term of imprisonment [is] prorated . . . .” Ibid.\n  The BOP applies this statute using a methodology that awards 54\n  days of credit at the end of each year the prisoner serves and sets\n  those days to the side. When the difference between the time re\n  maining in the sentence and the amount of accumulated credit is less\n  than one year, the BOP awards a prorated amount of credit for that\n  final year proportional to the awards in other years.\n     Petitioners claim that the BOP’s calculation method is unlawful\n  because §3624(b)(1) requires a calculation based on the length of the\n  term of imprisonment imposed by the sentencing judge, not the\n  length of time that the prisoner actually serves. The District Court\n  rejected this challenge in each of petitioner’s cases, and the Ninth\n  Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Because the BOP’s method for calculating good time credit re\n flects the most natural reading of the statute, it is lawful. Pp. 5–17.\n    (a) The statute’s language and purpose, taken together, support the\n BOP’s method. That method tracks §3624(b)’s language by providing\n a prisoner a maximum credit of 54 days for each full year of impris\n onment and a proportionally adjusted amount of credit for any addi\n tional time served that is less than a full year. As §3624(b) directs,\n the BOP awards the credit “at the end of each year” of imprisonment.\n Petitioners’ approach cannot be reconciled with the statute. Because\n2                          BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    it awards credit for the sentence imposed, regardless of how much\n    time is actually served, a prisoner could receive credit for a year that\n    he does not spend in prison. Moreover the calculation of credit for\n    such a year would not be made “at the end of” that year. Nor could\n    the BOP determine whether the prisoner had exemplary behavior\n    “during that year.” This language did not find its way into the stat\n    ute by accident. The differences between the prior provision (re\n    pealed in 1984)—which granted the prisoner a deduction at the out\n    set of his sentence, subject to forfeiture for breaking prison rules—\n    and the present statute—under which “credit” is “earned” “at the end\n    of” the year based on an evaluation of behavior “during that year”—\n    show an intent to move from a prospective entitlement to a retrospec\n    tive award. The BOP’s method also furthers the basic purpose of the\n    statute. Section 3624 was part of the comprehensive Sentencing Re\n    form Act of 1984, which sought to achieve both increased sentencing\n    uniformity and greater honesty by “mak[ing] all sentences basically\n    determinate.” Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 367. There\n    after, the sentence the judge imposed would be the one the offender\n    actually served, with a sole statutory exception for good time credits.\n    Ibid. Section 3624(b) states the reason for the exception: to provide\n    an incentive for prisoners to “compl[y] with institutional disciplinary\n    regulations.” The exception is limited and tailored to its purpose—\n    credit is earned at the end of the year after compliance with institu\n    tional rules is demonstrated and thereby rewards and reinforces a\n    readily identifiable period of good behavior. The BOP’s approach fur\n    thers §3624’s objectives by tying the award directly to good behavior\n    during the preceding year. In contrast, petitioners’ approach would\n    allow a prisoner to earn credit for both the portion of his sentence\n    that he served and the portion offset with earned credit, which would\n    loosen the statute’s connection between good behavior and the good\n    time award. Pp. 5–8.\n       (b) Arguments to the contrary are unconvincing. Context indicates\n    that the phrase “term of imprisonment” as used in the portion of\n    §3624(b) at issue here refers to prison time actually served not, as pe\n    titioners contend, to the sentence imposed by the judge. Petitioners’\n    reliance on legislative history is misplaced. A U. S. Sentencing Com\n    mission Supplementary Report is not helpful to them either, because\n    there is no indication that the Commission, in that report or in the\n    Guidelines themselves, considered or referred to the particular ques\n    tion whether to base good time credit on time served or the sentence\n    imposed. Nor, in light of the statute’s text, structure, history, and\n    purpose, is this a case in which there is a “grievous ambiguity or un\n    certainty in the statute,” Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125,\n    139, permitting application of the rule of lenity. Because the BOP’s\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

Cf. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Re\n  sources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 844–845. And because\n  the BOP’s approach reflects the statute’s most natural reading and is\n  the most consistent with its purpose, it is also preferable to the dis\n  sent’s alternative interpretation.

S. C. §3624(b). Petition\ners, two federal prisoners, challenge the method that the\nFederal Bureau of Prisons uses for calculating this “good\ntime credit.” We conclude that the Bureau’s method re\nflects the most natural reading of the statute, and we\nreject petitioners’ legal challenge.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n  A federal sentencing statute provides: \n\n    “[A] prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of\n    more than 1 year . . . may receive credit toward the\n    service of the prisoner’s sentence, beyond the time\n    served, of up to 54 days at the end of each year of the\n    prisoner’s term of imprisonment, beginning at the end\n    of the first year of the term . . . . [C]redit for the last\n    year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment\n    shall be prorated and credited within the last six\n    weeks of the sentence.” §3624(b)(1).\n2                   BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons (BOP) applies this statute using a\nmethodology that petitioners in this case challenge as\nunlawful. In order to explain the BOP method, we shall\nuse a simplified example that captures its essential ele\nments. The unsimplified calculations described by the\nBOP in its policy statement, see App. 96–100, will reach\napproximately the same results as, and are essentially the\nmathematical equivalent of, the simplified system we\ndescribe (there may be other ways to describe the calcula\ntion as well). To the extent that there are any differences\nbetween the methodology employed by the BOP and that\nreflected in our example, they are of no consequence to the\nresolution of petitioners’ challenge and are therefore not\nbefore us. Similarly, although petitioners committed their\ncrimes before the current version of §3624 was enacted\nand are therefore subject to a previous version that dif\nfered slightly in certain details, see 18 U. S. C. §3624\n(1988 ed.), the differences between the two versions are\nimmaterial to the questions presented by this case. The\nparties refer to the current version as the relevant provi\nsion of law, see Brief for Petitioners 2–3; Brief for Respon\ndent 8, n. 2, and we shall do the same.\n   In our example we shall imagine a prisoner who has\nreceived a sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment. We shall\nassume that his behavior throughout his confinement is\nexemplary and that prison authorities will consequently\nconsider him to merit the maximum good time credit that\nthe statute will allow. And we shall ignore leap years.\n   Thus, at the end of the first year (Year 1) that prisoner\nwould earn the statute’s maximum credit of 54 days. The\nrelevant official (whom we shall call the “good time calcu\nlator”) would note that fact and, in effect, preliminarily\nput the 54 days to the side. At the end of Year 2 the pris\noner would earn an additional 54 days of good time credit.\nThe good time calculator would add this 54 days to the\nfirst 54 days, note the provisional total of 108 days, and\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nagain put the 108 days’ credit to the side. By the end of\nYear 8, the prisoner would have earned a total of 432 days\nof good time credit (8 years times 54 days). At that time,\nthe good time calculator would note that the difference\nbetween the time remaining in the sentence (2 years, or\n730 days) and the amount of accumulated good time credit\n(432 days) is less than 1 year (730 minus 432 equals 298\ndays, which is less than 365). The 432 days of good time\ncredit that the prisoner has earned by the end of Year 8\nare sufficient to wipe out all of the last year of the 10-year\nprison term and to shorten the prisoner’s 9th year of im\nprisonment by 67 days.\n   Year 9 of the sentence will consequently become the\nprisoner’s last year of imprisonment. Further, because the\nprisoner has already earned 67 days of credit against that\nyear (432 days already earned minus 365 days applied to\nYear 10 leaves 67 days to apply to Year 9), the prisoner\nwill have no more than 298 days left to serve in Year 9.\nNow the good time calculator will have to work out just\nhow much good time the prisoner can earn, and credit\nagainst, these remaining 298 days.\n   As we said, the statute provides that “good time” for this\n“last year or portion” thereof shall be “prorated.” Thus,\nthe good time calculator must divide the 298 days into two\nparts: (1) days that the prisoner will have to serve in\nprison, and (2) credit for good behavior the prisoner will\nearn during the days served in Year 9. In other words, the\nnumber of days to be served in Year 9 plus the number of\ngood time credit days earned will be equal to the number\nof days left in the sentence, namely, 298. And to keep the\naward of credit in the last year proportional to awards in\nother years, the ratio of these two parts of Year 9 (i.e., the\nnumber of good time days divided by the number of days\nserved) must be 54/365, the same ratio that the BOP\napplies to full years served. We can use some elementary\nalgebra, described in the Appendix, infra, to work out the\n4                   BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrest. The result is that if the prisoner serves 260 days, he\ncan earn an additional 38 days of credit for good behavior.\nThat is to say, of the 298 days remaining in his sentence,\nthe prisoner will have to serve 260 days in confinement,\nafter which point, his sentence will be fully accounted for\n(given the additional 38 days’ credit earned), and he will\nbe released. In sum, a prisoner subject to a 10-year\n(3,650-day) sentence who earns the maximum number of\ndays the statute permits will serve 3,180 days in confine\nment and receive 470 days of “good time” credit, about\n15% of the prison time actually served.\n                               B\n   In this case petitioners claim that the BOP’s calculation\nmethod is unlawful. They say that §3624(b)(1) (2006 ed.)\nrequires a straightforward calculation based upon the\nlength of the term of imprisonment that the sentencing\njudge imposes, not the length of time that the prisoner\nactually serves. Thus, if a sentencing judge imposes a\nprison term of 10 years (as in our example), then, in peti\ntioners’ view, the statute permits a maximum good time\naward of 540 days (10 years times 54 days), not the 470\ndays that the method described above would allow. And if\nthe judge imposes a prison term of 10 years and 6 months,\nthen the statute permits 567 days (540 days for the 10\nyears plus 27 days for the extra 6 months), not the 494\ndays that the method above would allow. According to\npetitioners, the BOP’s method causes model prisoners to\nlose seven days of good time credit per year of imprison\nment, and because their sentences are fairly long (one,\nMichael Barber, was sentenced to 26 years and 8 months;\nthe other, Tahir Jihad-Black, was sentenced to 21 years\nand 10 months), the difference in their cases amounts to\nseveral months of additional prison time.\n   The District Court in each of these cases rejected the\nprisoner’s challenge.

No. 08–227\nMO (D Ore., Oct. 27, 2008), App. 25. And in each instance\nthe Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court. Tablada\nv. Thomas, No. 07–35538 (CA9, Apr. 10, 2009), App. 11;\nsee also Tablada v. Thomas, 533 F. 3d 800 (CA9 2008).\nBecause the BOP’s administration of good time credits\naffects the interests of a large number of federal prisoners,\nwe granted the consolidated petition for certiorari to con\nsider petitioners’ challenge.\n                              II\n   Having now considered petitioners’ arguments, we\nconclude that that we must reject their legal challenge.\nThe statute’s language and its purpose, taken together,\nconvince us that the BOP’s calculation method is lawful.\nFor one thing, that method tracks the language of\n§3624(b). That provision says that a prisoner (serving a\nsentence of imprisonment of more than a year and less\nthan life) “may receive credit . . . of up to 54 days at the\nend of each year” subject to the “determination by the\nBureau of Prisons that, during that year, the prisoner” has\nbehaved in an exemplary fashion. Ibid. (emphasis added).\nAnd it says that credit for the “last year or portion of a\nyear . . . shall be prorated and credited within the last six\nweeks of the sentence.” Ibid. As the example in Part I\nmakes clear, the BOP’s interpretation provides a prisoner\nentitled to a maximum annual credit with 54 days of good\ntime credit for each full year of imprisonment that he\nserves and a proportionally adjusted amount of credit for\nany additional time served that is less than a full year.\nAnd, as §3624(b) directs, the BOP awards the credit at the\nend of each year of imprisonment (except, of course, for\nYear 9, which is subject to the statute’s special instruction\nrequiring proration and crediting during the last six weeks\nof the sentence).\n   We are unable similarly to reconcile petitioners’ ap\n6                    BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nproach with the statute. Their system awards credit for\nthe sentence imposed, regardless of how much time is\nactually served. Thus, a prisoner under petitioners’ sys\ntem could receive 54 days of credit for Year 10 despite the\nfact that he would be released after less than 81⁄2 years in\nprison. The good time calculation for Year 10 would not be\nmade “at the end of” Year 10 (nor within the last six weeks\nof a sentence ending during that year). Neither could the\nBOP determine whether the prisoner had behaved in\nexemplary fashion “during that year.” 18 U. S. C. §3624(b)\n(emphasis added); see also White v. Scibana, 390 F. 3d\n997, 1001 (CA7 2004) (“The Bureau cannot evaluate a\nprisoner’s behavior and award credit for good conduct if\nthe prisoner is not still in prison”); cf. McGinnis v. Royster,\n410 U. S. 263, 273 (1973) (“Where there is no evaluation\nby state officials and little or no rehabilitative participa\ntion for anyone to evaluate, there is a rational justification\nfor declining to give good-time credit”).\n   We cannot say that this language (“at the end of,” “dur\ning that year”) found its way into the statute by accident.\nUnder the previous good time provision, a prisoner was\n“entitled to a deduction from the term of his sentence\nbeginning with the day on which the sentence commences\nto run.” 18 U. S. C. §4161 (1982 ed.) (repealed 1984). This\ndeduction, granted at the outset of a prisoner’s sentence,\nwas then made subject to forfeiture if the prisoner “com\nmit[ted] any offense or violate[d] the rules of the institu\ntion.” §4165 (repealed 1984). The present statute, §3624\n(2006 ed.), in contrast, creates a system under which\n“credit” is “earned” “at the end of” the year based on an\nevaluation of behavior “during that year.” We agree with\nthe Government that “[t]he textual differences between\nthe two statutes reveal a purpose to move from a system of\nprospective entitlement to a system of retrospective\naward.” Brief for Respondent 33; see also White, supra, at\n1002, n. 3.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   For another thing, the BOP’s method better furthers the\nstatute’s basic purpose. The “good time” provision in\n§3624 is part of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98\nStat. 1987, 18 U. S. C. §3551 et seq., 28 U. S. C. §§991–\n998, a comprehensive law that reformed federal sentenc\ning practice and directed the newly created United States\nSentencing Commission “to devise guidelines to be used\nfor sentencing” in district courts, Mistretta v. United\nStates, 488 U. S. 361, 367 (1989). Under the previous\nregime, the United States Parole Commission, “as a gen\neral rule, [could] conditionally release a prisoner any time\nafter he serve[d] one-third of the judicially fixed term.”\nUnited States v. Grayson, 438 U. S. 41, 47 (1978). If, for\nexample, a judge imposed a prison term of 15 years, the\nParole Commission might have released the prisoner after\nonly 5 years. And it routinely did so. See United States\nSentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual §1A3, p. s., p.\n1.2 (Oct. 1987) (USSG) (“[D]efendants often serv[ed] only\nabout one-third of the sentence handed down by the\ncourt”). The result was “confusion and implicit deception.”\nIbid. With the Sentencing Reform Act, Congress sought to\nachieve both increased sentencing uniformity and greater\nhonesty by “mak[ing] all sentences basically determinate,”\nMistretta, supra, at 367. See USSG §1A3, p. s., at 1.2\n(statutory objectives included “honesty in sentencing,”\n“uniformity,” and “proportionality” (emphasis deleted)).\n   Thereafter, the sentence the judge imposed would be the\nsentence the offender actually served, with a sole statutory\nexception for good time credits. Mistretta, supra, at 367 (a\n“prisoner is to be released at the completion of his sen\ntence reduced only by any credit earned by good behavior\nwhile in custody” (citing §3624(b)). The reason for this\nexception is provided in §3624(b) itself: to provide an\nincentive for prisoners to “compl[y] with institutional\ndisciplinary regulations.” The good time exception is\nlimited (to 54 days per year) and tailored to its purpose—\n8                    BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncredit is earned at the end of the year after compliance\nwith institutional rules is demonstrated and thereby\nrewards and reinforces a readily identifiable period of good\nbehavior.\n   The BOP’s approach furthers the objective of §3624. It\nties the award of good time credits directly to good behav\nior during the preceding year of imprisonment. By con\ntrast, petitioners’ approach, insofar is it would award up to\n54 days per year of time sentenced as opposed to time\nserved, allows a prisoner to earn credit for both the portion\nof his sentence that he serves and the portion of his sen\ntence that he offsets with earned good time credit. In\nother words, petitioners argue that the BOP should award\ngood time credit not only for the days a prisoner spends in\nprison and behaves appropriately, but also for days that\nhe will not spend in prison at all, such as Year 10 in our\nexample. By doing so, it loosens the statute’s connection\nbetween good behavior and the award of good time and\ntransforms the nature of the exception to the basic sen\ntence-imposed-is-sentence-served rule. And to that extent,\nit is inconsistent with the statute’s basic purpose.\n                              III \n\n                               A\n\n  We are not convinced by petitioners’ several arguments\nagainst the BOP’s methodology. First, petitioners point to\nthe statement in §3624(b) that a prisoner “may receive\ncredit . . . at the end of each year of the prisoner’s term of\nimprisonment.” (Emphasis added.) The words “term of\nimprisonment,” they say, must refer to the years of the\nterm that the sentencing judge imposed (10 years in our\nexample), not the (less-than-10) years of the term that the\nprisoner actually served once good time credits were taken\ninto account. After all, the very first phrase of that provi\nsion makes eligible for good time credits “a prisoner who is\nserving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year other\n                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)              9\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nthan a term of imprisonment for the duration of the pris\noner’s life.” Ibid. (emphasis added; footnote omitted). The\nwords “term of imprisonment” in this phrase almost cer\ntainly refer to the sentence imposed, not to the time actu\nally served (otherwise prisoners sentenced to a year and a\nday would become ineligible for credit as soon as they\nearned it). And, as petitioners emphasize, we have recog\nnized a “presumption that a given term is used to mean\nthe same thing throughout a statute,” Brown v. Gardner,\n513 U. S. 115, 118 (1994).\n  The problem for petitioners, however, is that this pre\nsumption is not absolute. It yields readily to indications\nthat the same phrase used in different parts of the same\nstatute means different things, particularly where the\nphrase is one that speakers can easily use in different\nways without risk of confusion. Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers,\nInc. v. United States, 286 U. S. 427, 433 (1932); General\nDynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 595–\n596 (2004). See, e.g., id., at 596–597 (“age” has different\nmeanings in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of\n1967); United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co.,\n532 U. S. 200, 213 (2001) (same for “ ‘wages paid’ ” in the\nInternal Revenue Code); Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519\nU. S. 337, 343–344 (1997) (same for “employee” in Title\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964).\n  The phrase “term of imprisonment” is just such a\nphrase. It can refer to the sentence that the judge im\nposes, see, e.g., §3624(a) (“A prisoner shall be released” at\nthe end of “the prisoner’s term of imprisonment, less any\ntime credited” for good behavior), but it also can refer to\nthe time that the prisoner actually serves. Thus, §3624(d)\nof the statute before us requires BOP to “furnish [a] pris\noner with . . . suitable clothing[,] . . . money, . . . and . . .\ntransportation” “[u]pon the release of [the] prisoner on the\nexpiration of the prisoner’s term of imprisonment.” (Em\nphasis added.) The statute here means to assure that the\n10                   BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprisoner is provided with these necessities at the time of\nhis actual release from prison (sometime during Year 9 in\nour example), not at the end of the term that the judge\nimposed (which would be over a year later). Since the\nstatute uses the same phrase “term of imprisonment” in\ntwo different ways, the presumption cannot help petition\ners here. And, for the reasons we have given, see Part II,\nsupra, context here indicates that the particular instance\nof the phrase “term of imprisonment” at issue refers to\nprison time actually served rather than the sentence\nimposed by the judge.\n   Second, petitioners seek to draw support from the stat\nute’s legislative history. But those who consider legisla\ntive history significant cannot find that history helpful to\npetitioners here. Petitioners point, for example, to a\nstatement in the Senate Report accompanying the Sen\ntencing Reform Act, which says that the “method of calcu\nlation” of good time “will be considerably less complicated\nthan under current law in many respects,” and that “credit\ntoward early release is earned at a steady and easily\ndetermined rate that will have an obvious impact on the\nprisoner’s release date.” S. Rep. No. 98–225, p. 146–147\n(1983); see Brief for Petitioners 31–32. But these state\nments are consistent with the BOP’s interpretation of the\nstatute. Its method, as we understand it, is not particu\nlarly difficult to apply and it is certainly less complex than\nprior law, which provided for the accumulation of two\ndifferent kinds of good time credit (general and industrial),\ncalculated in different manners (prospectively and retro\nspectively), and awarded at different rates, depending on\nthe length of sentence imposed on the prisoner (5 to 10\ndays per month for general) or the year of employment (3\nor 5 days per month for industrial). See 18 U. S. C.\n§§4161, 4162 (1982 ed.).\n   Petitioners also point to various statements contained in\nthe Act’s Conference Report and made by individual legis\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlators that describe good time credit as providing sentence\nreductions of 15%. See Brief for Petitioners 34–36 (citing,\ne.g., H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 98–1159, p. 415 (1984); 131\nCong. Rec. 488 (1985) (remarks of Rep. Hamilton)). But\nthere is nothing in the context of these statements to\nsuggest that they amounted to anything other than rough\napproximations or that they were made with the present\ncontroversy in mind. See, e.g., H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 98–\n1159, at 415 (noting simply that an increase in the amount\nof maximum annual credit from 36 days to 54 days “in\ncreases ‘good time’ that accrues from 10 percent to 15\npercent”); 131 Cong. Rec. 488 (1985) (statement of Rep.\nHamilton) (“Under [pre-Sentencing Reform Act] law, about\n80% of all criminals are paroled after serving one third of\ntheir time. Now sentences will be reduced only 15% for\ngood behavior”). And whatever interpretive force one\nattaches to legislative history, the Court normally gives\nlittle weight to statements, such as those of the individual\nlegislators, made after the bill in question has become law.\nSee, e.g., Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S. 291, 298 (1995).\n   Third, petitioners rely on a statement in the United\nStates Sentencing Commission’s Supplementary Report on\nthe Initial Sentencing Guidelines and Policy Statements\nissued in 1987 (hereinafter Supplementary Report). In\nthat Report, the Commission summarized its analysis of\nrecent pre-Guidelines sentencing practice, which it had\nused to help draft the Guidelines. The results of the\nanalysis were presented in a table that permits compari\nson of the likely prison-time consequences of the new\nGuidelines with prison time actually served under pre-\nGuidelines practice (specifically, by identifying the Guide\nlines “offense level that is closest to the average time . . .\nserved by first-time offenders” convicted of a particular\ncrime, Supplementary Report 23). Because the Guidelines\n“refer to sentences prior to the awarding of good time” (i.e.,\nbecause a Guidelines sentence of, say, 30 months’ impris\n12                 BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nonment does not necessarily mean that the offender will\nserve the entire 30 months in prison), the Commission\nadjusted the average time served “by dividing by 0.85 good\ntime when the term exceeded 12 months.” Ibid. This\nadjustment, the Commission explained, “made sentences\nin the [t]able comparable with those in the guidelines.”\nIbid.\n   Pointing to this adjustment and a reference in later\neditions of the Guidelines to a potential credit of “ap\nproximately fifteen percent for good behavior,” see, e.g.,\nUSSG §1A3, p. s., at 3 (Nov. 2009), petitioners maintain\nthat the Commission set its Guideline ranges with the\nexpectation that well-behaved prisoners would receive\ngood time credit of up to 15% of the sentence imposed, not\n15% of the time actually served. They add that, in setting\nthe Guidelines ranges in this way, the Commission exer\ncised congressionally delegated power to interpret the\nSentencing Reform Act, see Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 371–\n379 (approving Congress’ delegation of the power to prom\nulgate sentencing guidelines), and that as long as that\ninterpretation is reasonable, courts must defer to it. See\nChevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Coun\ncil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843–844 (1984).\n   Again, however, we can find no indication that the\nCommission, in writing its Supplementary Report or in\nthe Guidelines themselves, considered or referred to the\nparticular question here before us, that is whether good\ntime credit is to be based on time served or the sentence\nimposed. The Guidelines Manual itself, a more authorita\ntive account of the Commission’s interpretive views than\nthe Supplementary Report, says nothing directly on that\nsubject. Moreover, with respect to comparisons between\nGuidelines sentences and pre-Guidelines practice, the\noriginal 1987 Manual cautioned that the Guidelines did\nnot “simply cop[y] estimates of existing practice as re\nvealed by the data,” but rather “departed from the data at\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndifferent points for various important reasons.” USSG\n§1A3, p. s., at 1.4; see also id., §1A4(g), p. s., at 1.11\n(while “Guideline sentences in many instances will ap\nproximate existing [i.e., pre-Guidelines] practice,” the\nCommission did “not conside[r] itself bound by existing\nsentencing practice” (emphasis added)). Because the\nCommission has expressed no view on the question before\nus, we need not decide whether it would be entitled to\ndeference had it done so. If it turns out that the calcula\ntion of good time credit based on prison time served rather\nthan the sentence imposed produces results that are more\nsevere than the Commission finds appropriate, the Com\nmission remains free to adjust sentencing levels accord\ningly. See id., §1A2, at 1.2 (acknowledging that “the\nguideline-writing process is evolutionary” and that the\nCommission functions “as a permanent agency to monitor\nsentencing practices in the federal courts throughout the\nnation”).\n   Fourth, petitioners ask us to invoke the rule of lenity\nand construe §3624 (2006 ed.) in their favor, that is, in a\nway that will maximize the amount of available good time\ncredit. We may assume for present purposes that §3624(b)\ncan be construed as imposing a criminal penalty. See\nBifulco v. United States, 447 U. S. 381, 387 (1980) (rule of\nlenity applies to “interpretations of . . . the penalties”\nimposed by “criminal prohibitions”); but see Sash v. Zenk,\n428 F. 3d 132, 134 (CA2 2005) (Sotomayor, J.) (holding\nthat §3624(b) is not a criminal statute for the purposes of\nthe rule of lenity). Even so, the rule of lenity only applies\nif, after considering text, structure, history, and purpose,\nthere remains a “grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the\nstatute,” Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 139\n(1998) (internal quotation marks omitted), such that the\nCourt must simply “ ‘guess as to what Congress intended.’ ”\nBifulco, supra, at 387 (quoting Ladner v. United States,\n358 U. S. 169, 178 (1958)). See United States v. Hayes,\n14                  BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 13); United States v.\nR. L. C., 503 U. S. 291, 305–306 (1992) (plurality opinion).\nHaving so considered the statute, we do not believe that\nthere remains a “grievous ambiguity or uncertainty” in the\nstatutory provision before us. Nor need we now simply\n“guess” what the statute means.\n  Finally, we note that petitioners urge us not to defer to\nthe BOP’s implementation of §3624(b). In our view, the\nBOP’s calculation system applies that statute as its lan\nguage is most naturally read, and in accordance with what\nthat language makes clear is its basic purpose. No one\ndoubts that the BOP has the legal power to implement the\nstatute in accordance with its language and purposes;\nhence we need not determine the extent to which Congress\nhas granted the BOP authority to interpret the statute\nmore broadly, or differently than it has done here. Cf.\nChevron, supra, at 844–845.\n                              B\n  Acknowledging that petitioners’ arguments cannot carry\nthe day, the dissent has proposed a “third possibility,”\npost, at 2 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.), not raised by either\nparty nor, to our knowledge, used elsewhere in the Crimi\nnal Code. The dissent reads the statutory phrase “term of\nimprisonment” to refer to “the administrative period along\nwhich progress toward eventual freedom is marked.” Post,\nat 3. It derives from this reading the following method of\ncalculation as applied to our 10-year example. First, “[t]he\nsentence is divided into 10 365-day segments.” Ibid. At\nthe end of the first segment, a prisoner may receive up to\n54 days of credit for good behavior. These credits immedi\nately “go toward completion of the next year” so that the\nprisoner need only serve “another 311 days behind bars\nbefore the second year of his term of imprisonment is at an\nend.” Ibid. This process repeats itself until the “10th\nsegment,” in which a prisoner receives an unspecified\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“credit in a prorated amount.” Ibid. In the end, the pris\noner will have served 10 “administrative segments,” ibid.,\ncollectively comprising 3,117 days in prison and 533 days\nof credit.\n   The dissent claims “[r]eading ‘term of imprisonment’\nthis way is consistent with all parts of the statute.” Post,\nat 4. We see at least four problems. First, the opening\nsentence of §3624(a) instructs that “[a] prisoner shall be\nreleased” upon “the expiration of the prisoner’s term of\nimprisonment, less any time credited” for good behavior.\nBut if a prisoner’s “term of imprisonment” is the “period\nthat a prisoner must complete in order to earn his free\ndom,” post, at 4, and it is “accounted for through a combi\nnation of prison time and credits,” post, at 3, then a pris\noner should be released exactly at the end of his term of\nimprisonment (without any further adjustment). Because\nthe dissent’s approach would require us to read words out\nof the statute, or give prisoners double credit, its definition\ncannot be used here.\n   Second, §3624(b)(1) tells us that a prisoner receives\ncredit “at the end of each year” based on behavior “during\nthat year.” Under the dissent’s approach, however, a\nprisoner may receive credit at the end of each “administra\ntive segmen[t]” presumably based on his behavior during\nthat segment. And because an “administrative segmen[t]”\nis made up of some “combination of service and credits,”\npost, at 4, each one lasts less than a calendar year. We do\nnot see how a system in which “a prisoner may complete a\nparticular year of his term in less than 365 calendar days,”\nibid., and receive full good time credit for doing so, can\npossibly represent the most natural reading of this statu\ntory language. Nor do we know, because the BOP has not\nhad an opportunity to tell us, whether a system in which a\n“year” lasts anywhere from 311 to 365 calendar days (and\nin which the “years” of a single prisoner’s sentence may all\nbe of different lengths), is easily administrable. (We doubt\n16                  BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat this system will be more comprehensible to prisoners\nthan one, like the BOP’s, that provides credit for actual\nyears.)\n   Third, under the dissent’s approach, credit is earned at\ndifferent rates during a single sentence. For the first\n“administrative segmen[t]” in its 10-year example, the\nprisoner serves 365 days and earns 54 days of credit. The\nratio of credit earned to days served is .148. For the sec\nond “administrative segmen[t],” the prisoner serves 311\ndays and earns 54 days of credit. This time, the ratio of\ncredit earned to days served is .174. (For the last “admin\nistrative segmen[t],” the dissent tells us the prisoner will\nreceive “credit in a prorated amount,” but it does not tell\nus which ratio should be used for the proration. Post, at\n3.) The use of different rates finds no support in the stat\nute. The dissent objects that the statute “prescribes no\nparticular rate,” post, at 7, but in fact it does—54 days of\ncredit per year of good behavior—and it further requires\nthat credit for the last year be “prorated” using the same\nproportion. Moreover, the dissent’s application of different\nrates leads to odd results. For example, a model prisoner\nsentenced on two separate 5-year terms (with a break in\nbetween) will serve a different number of days from one\nsentenced to a single 10-year term. How can this be if\nboth prisoners are earning 54 days of credit for each of\ntheir 10 years in prison?\n   Fourth, §3624(b)(2) provides that good time credit “shall\nvest on the date the prisoner is released from custody.”\n(This provision does not apply to prisoners, like petition\ners, who committed their offenses before it was amended\nin 1996, but the dissent plainly intends for its approach to\napply more broadly. See post, at 9 (noting the effect on\n“almost 200,000 federal prisoners”).) Yet under the dis\nsent’s approach, credit appears to vest immediately. See\npost, at 3 (Days of credit for the first year “go toward\ncompletion of the next year” so that the prisoner “would\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nneed another 311 days behind bars before the second year\nof his term of imprisonment is at an end”). And if it does\nnot, then the situation quickly becomes complicated.\nWhat happens if, say, on the last day of the 10th “adminis\ntrative segmen[t]” (somewhere in the 8th calendar year), a\nprisoner badly misbehaves and prison officials punish him\nby taking away all of his previously earned credit? Cf. 28\nCFR §541.13 (2009) (prescribing sanctions for prohibited\nacts). Does the BOP retroactively adjust the duration of\nall of his administrative segments to 365 days so that the\nprisoner now finds himself in the middle of the 8th “ad\nministrative segmen[t]”? (Again we do not know if the\nBOP would find such a system administrable, and we\ndoubt that this system would be more comprehensible to a\nprisoner.) If so, does the prisoner have a second opportu\nnity to earn credit for good behavior for the 9th “adminis\ntrative segmen[t]” that he had previously completed but\nnow must account for again? Cf. §3624(b)(1) (“Credit that\nhas not been earned may not later be granted”). Or, hav\ning previously awarded (and taken away) credit for that\nsegment, are prison authorities left without any incentive\nto offer for good behavior?\n  Finally, the dissent, like petitioners, invokes the rule of\nlenity to support its interpretation. But, the best efforts of\nthe dissent notwithstanding, we still see no “grievous\nambiguity or uncertainty” that would trigger the rule’s\napplication. We remain convinced that the BOP’s ap\nproach reflects the most natural reading of the statutory\nlanguage and the most consistent with its purpose. What\never the merits of the dissent’s policy arguments, the\nstatute does not require the BOP to accept them.\n\n For all of these reasons, we conclude that the BOP’s\nmethodology is lawful. The Ninth Circuit’s judgment is\n\n                                                    Affirmed.\n18                   BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\n\n                        APPENDIX\n\n  A fuller example of the BOP’s method for calculat\n  ing “credit for the last year or portion of a year of\n                the term of imprisonment”\n   The defendant is sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment.\nAs a prisoner he exhibits exemplary behavior and is\nawarded the maximum credit of 54 days at the end of each\nyear served in prison. At the end of Year 8, the prisoner\nhas 2 years remaining in his sentence and has accumu\nlated 432 days of good time credit. Because the difference\nbetween the time remaining in his sentence and the\namount of accumulated credit (i.e., 730 - 432) is less than a\nyear (298 days), Year 9 is the last year he will spend in\nprison. (Year 10 has been completely offset by 365 of the\n432 days of accumulated credit.) Further, Year 9 will be a\npartial year of 298 days (the other 67 days of the year\nbeing offset by the remainder of the accumulated credit).\n   Here is where the elementary algebra comes in. We\nknow that x, the good time, plus y, the remaining time\nserved, must add up to 298. This gives us our first equa\ntion: x + y = 298.\n   We also know that the ratio of good time earned in the\nportion of the final year to the amount of time served in\nthat year must equal the ratio of a full year’s good time\ncredit to the amount of time served in a full year. The\nlatter ratio is 54/365 or .148. Thus, we know that\nx/y = .148, or to put it another way, x = .148y. Because we\nknow the value of x in terms of y, we can make a substitu\ntion in our first equation to get .148y + y = 298. We then\nadd the two y terms together (1.148y = 298), and we solve\nfor y, which gives us y = 260. Now we can plug that value\ninto our first equation to solve for x (the good time credit).\nIf we subtract 260 from 298, we find that x = 38.\n   The offender will have to serve 260 days in prison in\nYear 9, and he will receive 38 days additional good time\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

The prisoner’s total good time\nis 470 days (432 + 38 = 470). His total time served is 3180\ndays.\n   As a final matter, while we have described the foregoing\nas the method to calculate credit for the portion of the last\nyear to more transparently track the relevant statutory\nlanguage, we note that the mathematical formula can be\nused to calculate the amount of maximum available credit\nfor an entire sentence. Using the equations supplied\nabove, if we divide the total number of days in a sentence\nby 1.148, we get the minimum number of days that a\ndefendant must serve in that sentence. If we then sub\ntract the number of days served from the total number of\ndays in the sentence, we arrive at the maximum number\nof good time credit days the prisoner can earn. The stat\nute, however, awards them on a yearly basis (but for the\n“last year or portion” thereof).\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Absent\na clear congressional directive, the statute ought not to be\nread as the Court reads it. For the Court’s interpreta\ntion—an interpretation that in my submission is quite\nincorrect—imposes tens of thousands of years of additional\nprison time on federal prisoners according to a mathe\nmatical formula they will be unable to understand. And if\nthe only way to call attention to the human implications of\nthis case is to speak in terms of economics, then it should\nbe noted that the Court’s interpretation comes at a cost to\nthe taxpayers of untold millions of dollars.

THOMAS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n    “[A] prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of\n    more than 1 year[,] other than a term of imprisonment\n    for the duration of the prisoner’s life, may receive\n    credit toward the service of the prisoner’s sentence,\n    beyond the time served, of up to 54 days at the end of\n    each year of the prisoner’s term of imprisonment, be\n    ginning at the end of the first year of the term, subject\n    to determination by the Bureau of Prisons that, dur\n    ing that year, the prisoner has displayed exemplary\n    compliance with institutional disciplinary regula\n    tions. . . .

C. §3624(b)(1) (emphasis added).\nAccording to the Court, the phrase “term of imprisonment”\nmust mean “time actually served” the third time that it\nappears in this particular subsection. But the Court gives\nthe phrase a different interpretation the first two times it\nis used in the very same sentence. This in itself indicates\nthat something is quite wrong here.\n   Petitioners invite the Court to read “term of imprison\nment” to mean “the sentence imposed.” This, too, seems\nunworkable. And it can be acknowledged that the Court’s\nrejection of this interpretation is correct.\n   The choice, however, is not just between the Court’s\nreading and that offered by petitioners. There is a third\npossibility, one more consistent with the statute than\neither of these two alternatives.\n   A fair reading of the statute, and a necessary reading to\naccomplish its purpose best, is to interpret the phrase\n“term of imprisonment” to refer to the span of time that a\nprisoner must account for in order to obtain release. The\nlength of the term is set at the outset by the criminal\nsentence imposed. The prisoner earns release when that\nterm has been fully completed. Most of the term will be\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nsatisfied through time spent behind bars. Assuming the\nprisoner is well behaved, however, he may earn good time\ncredits along the way; and those credits may substitute for\nactual prison time. Each year of the term comprises a full\n365 days, which must be accounted for through a combina\ntion of prison time and credits. Thus conceived, a pris\noner’s “term” is the administrative period along which\nprogress toward eventual freedom is marked.\n   Consider the Court’s example of a prisoner subject to a\nten-year sentence. See ante, at 2–4. The sentence is\ndivided into ten 365-day segments. Each segment consti\ntutes a year of the term. The prisoner will spend the first\n365 days behind bars. In the statute’s words, he has\nreached “the end of the first year of the term.” Now is the\ntime for credit to be awarded, and he may receive up to 54\ndays if sufficiently well behaved. Because he has already\ncompleted a full year of his term, those credits go toward\ncompletion of the next year. If, based on good behavior, he\nhas earned the maximum of 54 days, he would need an\nother 311 days behind bars before the second year of his\nterm of imprisonment is at an end (because 54 + 311 =\n365). If he has earned fewer than 54 days, a longer incar\nceration will be required to reach 365. Regardless, once\nthe prisoner reaches the end of the second year of his\nterm, he will again be eligible to receive good time credits.\n   This process repeats itself for the third year of the term,\nand so on. In the final year of his term (in this example,\nthe tenth segment into which his term has been divided),\nthe prisoner will receive credit in a prorated amount, to be\nawarded “within the last six weeks of the sentence.” This\nensures that the prisoner does not reach the end of year\nten, only to find that he has just earned 54 days of credit\nhe no longer needs.\n   The controlling rule is that each year of the prisoner’s\nterm—each of the ten administrative segments—\ncomprises 365 days that must be completed through a\n4                   BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ncombination of service and credits. By combining actual\nprison time with the credits he has earned, a prisoner may\ncomplete a particular year of his term in less than 365\ncalendar days. As a result, credits may enable a well\nbehaved prisoner to complete his ten-year sentence before\nten calendar years have elapsed. For a ten-year (3,650\nday) sentence, a prisoner will serve 3,117 days behind bars\nif he earns a maximum of approximately 533 credits. This\nis 63 more days of credit than under the Court’s reading—\nmore than 6 additional credit days for every year of the\nsentence imposed.\n   Reading “term of imprisonment” this way is consistent\nwith all parts of the statute. The prisoner receives his\ncredit “at the end of each year of [his] term of imprison\nment,” a process that “begin[s] at the end of the first year\nof the term.” Credit is only awarded if the prisoner has\nproven well behaved “during that year.” This interpreta\ntion fulfills the “objective of §3624”—rewarding a prisoner\nfor exemplary conduct during the preceding year. See\nante, at 8.\n   This approach also has a textual integrity that the\nCourt’s reading does not: It gives “term of imprisonment”\nthe same meaning each time it is used by the statute.\nEvery time it appears in §3624(b)(1), “term of imprison\nment” refers to the administrative period that a prisoner\nmust complete in order to earn his freedom. The Court, by\ncontrast, would read this phrase to mean “time actually\nserved” the third time it is used, but “the sentence im\nposed” the first two times it is used (“ ‘a prisoner who is\nserving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year[,]\nother than a term of imprisonment for the duration of the\nprisoner’s life’ ”). See ante, at 8–9. The Court’s interpreta\ntion thus runs afoul of the “ ‘presumption that a given\nterm is used to mean the same thing throughout a stat\nute.’ ” Ante, at 9 (quoting Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S.\n115, 118 (1994)). The inconsistency here is particularly\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\negregious because all three uses appear in the same sen\ntence. See id., at 118 (“[The] presumption [is] surely at its\nmost vigorous when a term is repeated within a given\nsentence”).\n   The Court responds by noting another part of the stat\nute, a provision stating that prisoners shall receive cloth\ning, money, and transportation “[u]pon the release of [the]\nprisoner on the expiration of the prisoner’s term of impris\nonment.” §3624(d). A prisoner is released at the end of\nhis actual time behind bars, says the Court, and so “term\nof imprisonment” must here refer to time actually served.\nYet release also comes at the end of a prisoner’s “term” in\nthe sense described above—that is, when the balance of\nthe sentence has been reduced to zero through a combina\ntion of prison time and good time credits. Indeed, this\nadministrative use of the phrase fits well with the word\n“expiration,” which in its most natural sense in this con\ntext refers to the close of a formal accounting period. See\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 619 (8th ed. 2004) (“A coming to\nan end; esp., a formal termination on a closing date”). By\ncontrast, it is awkward at best to say, as the Court would\nhave it, that a prisoner’s actual time behind bars is some\nthing that “expires.”\n   The Court’s approach produces yet another oddity. The\nstatute requires that prorated credit be awarded for “the\nlast year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment.”\nOne might naturally assume that the last year of a ten\nyear term would be year ten. That is how things work\nunder the approach described above, in which a ten-year\nsentence is subdivided into ten administrative segments.\n   But under the Court’s reading, a prisoner serving a ten\nyear sentence will never reach year ten of his term; year\nten simply does not exist. According to the Court, year\nnine is the final year, and even year nine is not a full year:\nIt lasts “no more than 298 days.” Ante, at 3. If this\nsounds confusing, it will be all the more so to the prisoner\n6                   BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nwho has just received his sentence and turns to the statute\nbooks to figure out when to expect his freedom.\n   The Court does not even attempt to defend these flaws.\nInstead, it points to four supposed defects in the approach\ndescribed above. None withstands examination.\n   First, the Court notes that the statute requires the\nrelease of a prisoner “upon ‘the expiration of the prisoner’s\nterm of imprisonment, less any time credited’ for good\nbehavior.” Ante, at 15 (quoting §3624(a)). But if “term of\nimprisonment” truly refers to the entire span that a pris\noner must complete to earn his freedom—a period that\naccounts both for actual time and for good time credits—\nthen why would the “less any time credited” language be\nappropriate? The answer is that this provision—which\nappears at the very beginning of the section entitled “Re\nlease of a prisoner”—announces to a prisoner when release\nmay be expected: when the prisoner’s term expires, taking\ninto account credit days “as provided in subsection (b).”\n§3624(a) (bold face deleted). This use of language is com\nmon. A debtor who says “I will write a check for what I\nowe you, less what you owe me” is simply saying “I will\npay what I owe, taking into account your debts to me.”\nPerhaps the same meaning could have been conveyed\nusing different words, but this is hardly probative.\n   Second, the Court alleges that the above approach con\nflicts with the statute’s requirement that credit be\nawarded “at the end of each year” based upon behavior\n“during that year.” After all, if a year of the term can be\nsatisfied in part through credit, then it may last less than\na full calendar year. Yet the statute does not require that\ncredit be awarded at the end of a calendar year for good\nbehavior during a calendar year. What it requires is that\ncredit be awarded “at the end of each year of the prisoner’s\nterm of imprisonment” for good behavior “during that\nyear.” And this is precisely what the above approach does.\n   Third, the Court frets that, under the approach above,\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nprisoners will earn credit at different rates during a single\nsentence. It admonishes that “[t]he use of different rates\nfinds no support in the statute.” Ante, at 16. This re\nsponse is telling. The statute, in fact, prescribes no par\nticular rate—and certainly no formula based on a rate—\nexcept as embodied in one clear directive: Prisoners are\neligible to earn “up to 54 days at the end of each year of\nthe prisoner’s term of imprisonment.” As to that com\nmand, the above approach is perfectly faithful.\n   Fourth, the Court suggests that the above approach\ncauses credit to vest immediately, contrary to the statute.\nAgain, this is not true. As per the statute, credit only\nvests “on the date the prisoner is released from custody,”\n§3624(b)(2), meaning that it can be revoked at any time\nbefore that date. This gives prisoners approaching their\nrelease date an extra incentive to behave.\n   As a fallback, the Court wonders what would happen if\na prisoner misbehaved on the final day of his ten-year\nsentence. Would the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) be forced to\n“retroactively adjust the duration of all of his [term years]\nto 365 days”? Ante, at 17. The answer is what one might\nsuppose: A prisoner whose credits are revoked will find\nhimself precisely where he would have been if those cred\nits had never been earned. All years of the term remain\n365 days, as they always have. But a misbehaving pris\noner who had formerly earned, say, 500 credits will find\nhimself without the benefit of those 500 days. That will\nleave him with more of his term to complete—500 days\nmore, to be precise. If he behaves well again, he can re\nsume earning credit for the remainder of his term, but he\nhas lost the opportunity to earn credits for any prior years.\nSee §3624(b)(1). This is not at all confusing for a prisoner;\nand certainly it is as straightforward, if not more so, than\nthe Court’s approach. The Court’s view causes a prisoner’s\n“term of imprisonment” to shrink over time according to\nan algebraic formula, only to expand again if he misbe\n8                    BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nhaves.\n   Finally, the Court speculates that BOP might find the\nabove approach difficult to administer. The Court identi\nfies no basis for this claim, nor does one exist. The infor\nmation used to calculate a prisoner’s term under the above\napproach is the same as it is under the Court’s approach.\nTrue, a prisoner may become eligible to be awarded credit\non different calendar days during the course of his term.\nBut under the Court’s approach, this also happens when\nawarding credit in the final year. And, it goes without\nsaying, federal prisoners begin their incarceration on\ndifferent calendar days anyway, so that under any ap\nproach, BOP will be forced to evaluate prisoners through\nout the calendar year.\n                               II\n   The Court’s reading of §3624(b)(1), therefore, is less\nconsistent with the text than the reading explained above.\nBut even if these interpretations were in equipoise, under\nany fair application the rule of lenity should tip the bal\nance in petitioners’ favor. When a penal statute is suscep\ntible of two interpretations, the one more favorable to the\ndefendant must be chosen unless “text, structure, and\nhistory . . . establish that the [harsher] position is unam\nbiguously correct.” United States v. Granderson, 511 U. S.\n39, 54 (1994). Resolving ambiguity in favor of lenity en\nsures that statutes provide “fair warning[,] . . . in language\nthat the common world will understand, of what the law\nintends to do if a certain line is passed.” United States v.\nBass, 404 U. S. 336, 348 (1971) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The rule thus applies “not only to interpreta\ntions of the substantive ambit of criminal prohibitions, but\nalso to the penalties they impose.” Bifulco v. United\nStates, 447 U. S. 381, 387 (1980).\n   The Court assumes without deciding that §3624(b) is\npenal in nature. See ante, at 13. No assumption is neces\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nsary: The statutory provision awarding good time credits\n“in fact is one determinant of [a] prison term,” so that a\nprisoner’s “effective sentence is altered once this determi\nnant is changed.” Weaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24, 32\n(1981). In Weaver, the Court considered whether an\namendment to Florida’s statutory formula for calculating\ngood time credits implicated the Ex Post Facto Clause.\nThe Court concluded that it did, as the new statute “sub\nstantially alter[ed] the consequences attached to a crime\nalready completed, and therefore change[d] ‘the quantum\nof punishment.’ ” Id., at 33 (quoting Dobbert v. Florida,\n432 U. S. 282, 294 (1977)). For the same reason, the penal\neffect of §3624(b)(1) is substantial enough to implicate the\nrule of lenity. We should not disadvantage almost 200,000\nfederal prisoners unless Congress clearly warned them\nthey would face that harsh result.\n                              III\n   The Government—although not the Court—argues that\nwe should embrace its interpretation out of deference to\nBOP. BOP has been charged by the Attorney General\nwith responsibility for “[a]pproving inmate disciplinary\nand good time regulations.” 28 CFR §0.96(s) (2009). BOP\nhas long followed the same credit-calculation method now\nadvocated by the Court. The Government argues that we\nshould defer to BOP’s choice as a permissible exercise of\nits delegated responsibility.\n   This argument fails on multiple levels. There is no\nindication that BOP has exercised the sort of interpretive\nauthority that would merit deference under Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U. S. 837 (1984). The statute does not create a legis\nlative gap for BOP to fill. To the contrary, the procedures\nthat govern the timing of credit awards are spelled out in\ngreat detail. Cf. Lopez v. Davis, 531 U. S. 230, 241–242\n(2001) (where statute says that BOP “may” grant early\n10                  BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nrelease to certain prisoners, without specifying further\ncriteria, Congress deliberately created a “statutory gap”).\nThe statute even goes so far as to explain what to do “[i]f\nthe date for a prisoner’s release falls on a Saturday, a\nSunday, or a legal holiday.” §3624(a). This legislative\nspecificity as to timing contrasts with other provisions\nthat do delegate authority to BOP. E.g., §3624(b)(1)\n(awarding of credit is “subject to determination” by BOP\nthat the prisoner “has displayed exemplary compliance\nwith institutional disciplinary regulations”).\n   BOP has not claimed that its view is the product of any\n“formal administrative procedure tending to foster the\nfairness and deliberation that should underlie a pro\nnouncement” with the force of law. United States v. Mead\nCorp., 533 U. S. 218, 230 (2001). In 2005, BOP made final\nan administrative rule adopting its preferred methodology.\n70 Fed. Reg. 66752 (adopting 28 CFR §523.20). But when\npressed during an earlier stage of this litigation, BOP\nconceded that it had “failed to articulate in the adminis\ntrative record the rationale upon which it relied when it\npromulgated” the rule. Tablada v. Thomas, 533 F. 3d 800,\n805 (CA9 2008). The Court of Appeals accepted BOP’s\nconcession, ibid., and that aspect of its ruling has not been\nappealed.\n   As a fallback position, the Government argues that\nBOP’s interpretation should receive at least some defer\nence under Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134 (1944).\nBut under Skidmore, an agency decision only merits “re\nspect proportional to its ‘power to persuade.’ ” Mead,\nsupra, at 235 (quoting Skidmore, supra, at 140). BOP’s\nposition is of long standing, but the administrative record\nis noteworthy for what it does not contain—namely, any\nreasoned justification for preferring BOP’s methodology\nover statutorily permissible alternatives. BOP has consis\ntently adhered to its mistaken belief that its approach is\nthe only one that can be squared with the text. See 62\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nFed. Reg. 50786 (1997) (explanation to interim rule assert\ning that the correct methodology “had been clearly stated\nby statute since the implementation of the Sentencing\nReform Act of 1984”). For example, at no point did BOP\nconsider, much less consciously reject, the interpretation\noutlined here. Cf. Reno v. Koray, 515 U. S. 50, 60–61\n(1995) (deferring to BOP’s reasoned decision to reject one\ninterpretation in favor of another). An agency need not\nconsider all possible alternatives. But deference is not\nowed to an agency view, however consistently held, that\nfrom the start has been premised on legal error. See\nMead, supra, at 228; Skidmore, supra, at 140.\n                        *     *     *\n  The straightforward interpretation urged here accords\nwith the purpose of the statute, which is to give prisoners\nincentive for good behavior and dignity from its promised\nreward. Prisoners can add 54 days to each year. And\nwhen they do so, they have something tangible. In place\nof that simple calculation, of clear meaning, of a calendar\nthat can be marked, the Court insists on something differ\nent. It advocates an interpretation that uses different\ndefinitions for the same phrase in the same sentence;\ndenies prisoners the benefit of the rule of lenity; and caps\noff its decision with an appendix that contains an alge\nbraic formula to hang on a cell wall.\n  To a prisoner, time behind bars is not some theoreti\ncal or mathematical concept. It is something real, even\nterrifying. Survival itself may be at stake. See Dept.\nof Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, C.

Argued March 30, 2010—Decided June 7, 2010\nThe federal sentencing statute at issue provides that a “prisoner . . .\n  serving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year . . . may receive\n  credit toward the service of [that] sentence . . . of up to 54 days at the\n  end of each year” subject to the Bureau of Prison’s (BOP) “determina\n  tion . . . that, during that year, the prisoner” has behaved in an ex\n  emplary fashion. 18 U. S. C. §3624(b)(1). Credit “for the last year or\n  portion of a year of the term of imprisonment [is] prorated . . . .” Ibid.\n  The BOP applies this statute using a methodology that awards 54\n  days of credit at the end of each year the prisoner serves and sets\n  those days to the side. When the difference between the time re\n  maining in the sentence and the amount of accumulated credit is less\n  than one year, the BOP awards a prorated amount of credit for that\n  final year proportional to the awards in other years.\n     Petitioners claim that the BOP’s calculation method is unlawful\n  because §3624(b)(1) requires a calculation based on the length of the\n  term of imprisonment imposed by the sentencing judge, not the\n  length of time that the prisoner actually serves. The District Court\n  rejected this challenge in each of petitioner’s cases, and the Ninth\n  Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Because the BOP’s method for calculating good time credit re\n flects the most natural reading of the statute, it is lawful. Pp. 5–17.\n    (a) The statute’s language and purpose, taken together, support the\n BOP’s method. That method tracks §3624(b)’s language by providing\n a prisoner a maximum credit of 54 days for each full year of impris\n onment and a proportionally adjusted amount of credit for any addi\n tional time served that is less than a full year. As §3624(b) directs,\n the BOP awards the credit “at the end of each year” of imprisonment.\n Petitioners’ approach cannot be reconciled with the statute. Because\n2                          BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    it awards credit for the sentence imposed, regardless of how much\n    time is actually served, a prisoner could receive credit for a year that\n    he does not spend in prison. Moreover the calculation of credit for\n    such a year would not be made “at the end of” that year. Nor could\n    the BOP determine whether the prisoner had exemplary behavior\n    “during that year.” This language did not find its way into the stat\n    ute by accident. The differences between the prior provision (re\n    pealed in 1984)—which granted the prisoner a deduction at the out\n    set of his sentence, subject to forfeiture for breaking prison rules—\n    and the present statute—under which “credit” is “earned” “at the end\n    of” the year based on an evaluation of behavior “during that year”—\n    show an intent to move from a prospective entitlement to a retrospec\n    tive award. The BOP’s method also furthers the basic purpose of the\n    statute. Section 3624 was part of the comprehensive Sentencing Re\n    form Act of 1984, which sought to achieve both increased sentencing\n    uniformity and greater honesty by “mak[ing] all sentences basically\n    determinate.” Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 367. There\n    after, the sentence the judge imposed would be the one the offender\n    actually served, with a sole statutory exception for good time credits.\n    Ibid. Section 3624(b) states the reason for the exception: to provide\n    an incentive for prisoners to “compl[y] with institutional disciplinary\n    regulations.” The exception is limited and tailored to its purpose—\n    credit is earned at the end of the year after compliance with institu\n    tional rules is demonstrated and thereby rewards and reinforces a\n    readily identifiable period of good behavior. The BOP’s approach fur\n    thers §3624’s objectives by tying the award directly to good behavior\n    during the preceding year. In contrast, petitioners’ approach would\n    allow a prisoner to earn credit for both the portion of his sentence\n    that he served and the portion offset with earned credit, which would\n    loosen the statute’s connection between good behavior and the good\n    time award. Pp. 5–8.\n       (b) Arguments to the contrary are unconvincing. Context indicates\n    that the phrase “term of imprisonment” as used in the portion of\n    §3624(b) at issue here refers to prison time actually served not, as pe\n    titioners contend, to the sentence imposed by the judge. Petitioners’\n    reliance on legislative history is misplaced. A U. S. Sentencing Com\n    mission Supplementary Report is not helpful to them either, because\n    there is no indication that the Commission, in that report or in the\n    Guidelines themselves, considered or referred to the particular ques\n    tion whether to base good time credit on time served or the sentence\n    imposed. Nor, in light of the statute’s text, structure, history, and\n    purpose, is this a case in which there is a “grievous ambiguity or un\n    certainty in the statute,” Muscarello v.

S. C. §3624(b). Petition\ners, two federal prisoners, challenge the method that the\nFederal Bureau of Prisons uses for calculating this “good\ntime credit.” We conclude that the Bureau’s method re\nflects the most natural reading of the statute, and we\nreject petitioners’ legal challenge.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n  A federal sentencing statute provides: \n\n    “[A] prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of\n    more than 1 year . . . may receive credit toward the\n    service of the prisoner’s sentence, beyond the time\n    served, of up to 54 days at the end of each year of the\n    prisoner’s term of imprisonment, beginning at the end\n    of the first year of the term . . . . [C]redit for the last\n    year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment\n    shall be prorated and credited within the last six\n    weeks of the sentence.” §3624(b)(1).\n2                   BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons (BOP) applies this statute using a\nmethodology that petitioners in this case challenge as\nunlawful. In order to explain the BOP method, we shall\nuse a simplified example that captures its essential ele\nments. The unsimplified calculations described by the\nBOP in its policy statement, see App. 96–100, will reach\napproximately the same results as, and are essentially the\nmathematical equivalent of, the simplified system we\ndescribe (there may be other ways to describe the calcula\ntion as well). To the extent that there are any differences\nbetween the methodology employed by the BOP and that\nreflected in our example, they are of no consequence to the\nresolution of petitioners’ challenge and are therefore not\nbefore us. Similarly, although petitioners committed their\ncrimes before the current version of §3624 was enacted\nand are therefore subject to a previous version that dif\nfered slightly in certain details, see 18 U. S. C. §3624\n(1988 ed.), the differences between the two versions are\nimmaterial to the questions presented by this case. The\nparties refer to the current version as the relevant provi\nsion of law, see Brief for Petitioners 2–3; Brief for Respon\ndent 8, n. 2, and we shall do the same.\n   In our example we shall imagine a prisoner who has\nreceived a sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment. We shall\nassume that his behavior throughout his confinement is\nexemplary and that prison authorities will consequently\nconsider him to merit the maximum good time credit that\nthe statute will allow. And we shall ignore leap years.\n   Thus, at the end of the first year (Year 1) that prisoner\nwould earn the statute’s maximum credit of 54 days. The\nrelevant official (whom we shall call the “good time calcu\nlator”) would note that fact and, in effect, preliminarily\nput the 54 days to the side. At the end of Year 2 the pris\noner would earn an additional 54 days of good time credit.\nThe good time calculator would add this 54 days to the\nfirst 54 days, note the provisional total of 108 days, and\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nagain put the 108 days’ credit to the side. By the end of\nYear 8, the prisoner would have earned a total of 432 days\nof good time credit (8 years times 54 days). At that time,\nthe good time calculator would note that the difference\nbetween the time remaining in the sentence (2 years, or\n730 days) and the amount of accumulated good time credit\n(432 days) is less than 1 year (730 minus 432 equals 298\ndays, which is less than 365). The 432 days of good time\ncredit that the prisoner has earned by the end of Year 8\nare sufficient to wipe out all of the last year of the 10-year\nprison term and to shorten the prisoner’s 9th year of im\nprisonment by 67 days.\n   Year 9 of the sentence will consequently become the\nprisoner’s last year of imprisonment. Further, because the\nprisoner has already earned 67 days of credit against that\nyear (432 days already earned minus 365 days applied to\nYear 10 leaves 67 days to apply to Year 9), the prisoner\nwill have no more than 298 days left to serve in Year 9.\nNow the good time calculator will have to work out just\nhow much good time the prisoner can earn, and credit\nagainst, these remaining 298 days.\n   As we said, the statute provides that “good time” for this\n“last year or portion” thereof shall be “prorated.” Thus,\nthe good time calculator must divide the 298 days into two\nparts: (1) days that the prisoner will have to serve in\nprison, and (2) credit for good behavior the prisoner will\nearn during the days served in Year 9. In other words, the\nnumber of days to be served in Year 9 plus the number of\ngood time credit days earned will be equal to the number\nof days left in the sentence, namely, 298. And to keep the\naward of credit in the last year proportional to awards in\nother years, the ratio of these two parts of Year 9 (i.e., the\nnumber of good time days divided by the number of days\nserved) must be 54/365, the same ratio that the BOP\napplies to full years served. We can use some elementary\nalgebra, described in the Appendix, infra, to work out the\n4                   BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrest. The result is that if the prisoner serves 260 days, he\ncan earn an additional 38 days of credit for good behavior.\nThat is to say, of the 298 days remaining in his sentence,\nthe prisoner will have to serve 260 days in confinement,\nafter which point, his sentence will be fully accounted for\n(given the additional 38 days’ credit earned), and he will\nbe released. In sum, a prisoner subject to a 10-year\n(3,650-day) sentence who earns the maximum number of\ndays the statute permits will serve 3,180 days in confine\nment and receive 470 days of “good time” credit, about\n15% of the prison time actually served.\n                               B\n   In this case petitioners claim that the BOP’s calculation\nmethod is unlawful. They say that §3624(b)(1) (2006 ed.)\nrequires a straightforward calculation based upon the\nlength of the term of imprisonment that the sentencing\njudge imposes, not the length of time that the prisoner\nactually serves. Thus, if a sentencing judge imposes a\nprison term of 10 years (as in our example), then, in peti\ntioners’ view, the statute permits a maximum good time\naward of 540 days (10 years times 54 days), not the 470\ndays that the method described above would allow. And if\nthe judge imposes a prison term of 10 years and 6 months,\nthen the statute permits 567 days (540 days for the 10\nyears plus 27 days for the extra 6 months), not the 494\ndays that the method above would allow. According to\npetitioners, the BOP’s method causes model prisoners to\nlose seven days of good time credit per year of imprison\nment, and because their sentences are fairly long (one,\nMichael Barber, was sentenced to 26 years and 8 months;\nthe other, Tahir Jihad-Black, was sentenced to 21 years\nand 10 months), the difference in their cases amounts to\nseveral months of additional prison time.\n   The District Court in each of these cases rejected the\nprisoner’s challenge.

Thomas, 533 F. 3d 800 (CA9 2008).\nBecause the BOP’s administration of good time credits\naffects the interests of a large number of federal prisoners,\nwe granted the consolidated petition for certiorari to con\nsider petitioners’ challenge.\n                              II\n   Having now considered petitioners’ arguments, we\nconclude that that we must reject their legal challenge.\nThe statute’s language and its purpose, taken together,\nconvince us that the BOP’s calculation method is lawful.\nFor one thing, that method tracks the language of\n§3624(b). That provision says that a prisoner (serving a\nsentence of imprisonment of more than a year and less\nthan life) “may receive credit . . . of up to 54 days at the\nend of each year” subject to the “determination by the\nBureau of Prisons that, during that year, the prisoner” has\nbehaved in an exemplary fashion. Ibid. (emphasis added).\nAnd it says that credit for the “last year or portion of a\nyear . . . shall be prorated and credited within the last six\nweeks of the sentence.” Ibid. As the example in Part I\nmakes clear, the BOP’s interpretation provides a prisoner\nentitled to a maximum annual credit with 54 days of good\ntime credit for each full year of imprisonment that he\nserves and a proportionally adjusted amount of credit for\nany additional time served that is less than a full year.\nAnd, as §3624(b) directs, the BOP awards the credit at the\nend of each year of imprisonment (except, of course, for\nYear 9, which is subject to the statute’s special instruction\nrequiring proration and crediting during the last six weeks\nof the sentence).\n   We are unable similarly to reconcile petitioners’ ap\n6                    BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nproach with the statute. Their system awards credit for\nthe sentence imposed, regardless of how much time is\nactually served. Thus, a prisoner under petitioners’ sys\ntem could receive 54 days of credit for Year 10 despite the\nfact that he would be released after less than 81⁄2 years in\nprison. The good time calculation for Year 10 would not be\nmade “at the end of” Year 10 (nor within the last six weeks\nof a sentence ending during that year). Neither could the\nBOP determine whether the prisoner had behaved in\nexemplary fashion “during that year.” 18 U. S. C. §3624(b)\n(emphasis added); see also White v. Scibana, 390 F. 3d\n997, 1001 (CA7 2004) (“The Bureau cannot evaluate a\nprisoner’s behavior and award credit for good conduct if\nthe prisoner is not still in prison”); cf. McGinnis v. Royster,\n410 U. S. 263, 273 (1973) (“Where there is no evaluation\nby state officials and little or no rehabilitative participa\ntion for anyone to evaluate, there is a rational justification\nfor declining to give good-time credit”).\n   We cannot say that this language (“at the end of,” “dur\ning that year”) found its way into the statute by accident.\nUnder the previous good time provision, a prisoner was\n“entitled to a deduction from the term of his sentence\nbeginning with the day on which the sentence commences\nto run.” 18 U. S. C. §4161 (1982 ed.) (repealed 1984). This\ndeduction, granted at the outset of a prisoner’s sentence,\nwas then made subject to forfeiture if the prisoner “com\nmit[ted] any offense or violate[d] the rules of the institu\ntion.” §4165 (repealed 1984). The present statute, §3624\n(2006 ed.), in contrast, creates a system under which\n“credit” is “earned” “at the end of” the year based on an\nevaluation of behavior “during that year.” We agree with\nthe Government that “[t]he textual differences between\nthe two statutes reveal a purpose to move from a system of\nprospective entitlement to a system of retrospective\naward.” Brief for Respondent 33; see also White, supra, at\n1002, n. 3.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   For another thing, the BOP’s method better furthers the\nstatute’s basic purpose. The “good time” provision in\n§3624 is part of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98\nStat. 1987, 18 U. S. C. §3551 et seq., 28 U. S. C. §§991–\n998, a comprehensive law that reformed federal sentenc\ning practice and directed the newly created United States\nSentencing Commission “to devise guidelines to be used\nfor sentencing” in district courts, Mistretta v. United\nStates, 488 U. S. 361, 367 (1989). Under the previous\nregime, the United States Parole Commission, “as a gen\neral rule, [could] conditionally release a prisoner any time\nafter he serve[d] one-third of the judicially fixed term.”\nUnited States v. Grayson, 438 U. S. 41, 47 (1978). If, for\nexample, a judge imposed a prison term of 15 years, the\nParole Commission might have released the prisoner after\nonly 5 years. And it routinely did so. See United States\nSentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual §1A3, p. s., p.\n1.2 (Oct. 1987) (USSG) (“[D]efendants often serv[ed] only\nabout one-third of the sentence handed down by the\ncourt”). The result was “confusion and implicit deception.”\nIbid. With the Sentencing Reform Act, Congress sought to\nachieve both increased sentencing uniformity and greater\nhonesty by “mak[ing] all sentences basically determinate,”\nMistretta, supra, at 367. See USSG §1A3, p. s., at 1.2\n(statutory objectives included “honesty in sentencing,”\n“uniformity,” and “proportionality” (emphasis deleted)).\n   Thereafter, the sentence the judge imposed would be the\nsentence the offender actually served, with a sole statutory\nexception for good time credits. Mistretta, supra, at 367 (a\n“prisoner is to be released at the completion of his sen\ntence reduced only by any credit earned by good behavior\nwhile in custody” (citing §3624(b)). The reason for this\nexception is provided in §3624(b) itself: to provide an\nincentive for prisoners to “compl[y] with institutional\ndisciplinary regulations.” The good time exception is\nlimited (to 54 days per year) and tailored to its purpose—\n8                    BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncredit is earned at the end of the year after compliance\nwith institutional rules is demonstrated and thereby\nrewards and reinforces a readily identifiable period of good\nbehavior.\n   The BOP’s approach furthers the objective of §3624. It\nties the award of good time credits directly to good behav\nior during the preceding year of imprisonment. By con\ntrast, petitioners’ approach, insofar is it would award up to\n54 days per year of time sentenced as opposed to time\nserved, allows a prisoner to earn credit for both the portion\nof his sentence that he serves and the portion of his sen\ntence that he offsets with earned good time credit. In\nother words, petitioners argue that the BOP should award\ngood time credit not only for the days a prisoner spends in\nprison and behaves appropriately, but also for days that\nhe will not spend in prison at all, such as Year 10 in our\nexample. By doing so, it loosens the statute’s connection\nbetween good behavior and the award of good time and\ntransforms the nature of the exception to the basic sen\ntence-imposed-is-sentence-served rule. And to that extent,\nit is inconsistent with the statute’s basic purpose.\n                              III \n\n                               A\n\n  We are not convinced by petitioners’ several arguments\nagainst the BOP’s methodology. First, petitioners point to\nthe statement in §3624(b) that a prisoner “may receive\ncredit . . . at the end of each year of the prisoner’s term of\nimprisonment.” (Emphasis added.) The words “term of\nimprisonment,” they say, must refer to the years of the\nterm that the sentencing judge imposed (10 years in our\nexample), not the (less-than-10) years of the term that the\nprisoner actually served once good time credits were taken\ninto account. After all, the very first phrase of that provi\nsion makes eligible for good time credits “a prisoner who is\nserving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year other\n                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)              9\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nthan a term of imprisonment for the duration of the pris\noner’s life.” Ibid. (emphasis added; footnote omitted). The\nwords “term of imprisonment” in this phrase almost cer\ntainly refer to the sentence imposed, not to the time actu\nally served (otherwise prisoners sentenced to a year and a\nday would become ineligible for credit as soon as they\nearned it). And, as petitioners emphasize, we have recog\nnized a “presumption that a given term is used to mean\nthe same thing throughout a statute,” Brown v. Gardner,\n513 U. S. 115, 118 (1994).\n  The problem for petitioners, however, is that this pre\nsumption is not absolute. It yields readily to indications\nthat the same phrase used in different parts of the same\nstatute means different things, particularly where the\nphrase is one that speakers can easily use in different\nways without risk of confusion. Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers,\nInc. v. United States, 286 U. S. 427, 433 (1932); General\nDynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 595–\n596 (2004). See, e.g., id., at 596–597 (“age” has different\nmeanings in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of\n1967); United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co.,\n532 U. S. 200, 213 (2001) (same for “ ‘wages paid’ ” in the\nInternal Revenue Code); Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519\nU. S. 337, 343–344 (1997) (same for “employee” in Title\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964).\n  The phrase “term of imprisonment” is just such a\nphrase. It can refer to the sentence that the judge im\nposes, see, e.g., §3624(a) (“A prisoner shall be released” at\nthe end of “the prisoner’s term of imprisonment, less any\ntime credited” for good behavior), but it also can refer to\nthe time that the prisoner actually serves. Thus, §3624(d)\nof the statute before us requires BOP to “furnish [a] pris\noner with . . . suitable clothing[,] . . . money, . . . and . . .\ntransportation” “[u]pon the release of [the] prisoner on the\nexpiration of the prisoner’s term of imprisonment.” (Em\nphasis added.) The statute here means to assure that the\n10                   BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprisoner is provided with these necessities at the time of\nhis actual release from prison (sometime during Year 9 in\nour example), not at the end of the term that the judge\nimposed (which would be over a year later). Since the\nstatute uses the same phrase “term of imprisonment” in\ntwo different ways, the presumption cannot help petition\ners here. And, for the reasons we have given, see Part II,\nsupra, context here indicates that the particular instance\nof the phrase “term of imprisonment” at issue refers to\nprison time actually served rather than the sentence\nimposed by the judge.\n   Second, petitioners seek to draw support from the stat\nute’s legislative history. But those who consider legisla\ntive history significant cannot find that history helpful to\npetitioners here. Petitioners point, for example, to a\nstatement in the Senate Report accompanying the Sen\ntencing Reform Act, which says that the “method of calcu\nlation” of good time “will be considerably less complicated\nthan under current law in many respects,” and that “credit\ntoward early release is earned at a steady and easily\ndetermined rate that will have an obvious impact on the\nprisoner’s release date.” S. Rep. No. 98–225, p. 146–147\n(1983); see Brief for Petitioners 31–32. But these state\nments are consistent with the BOP’s interpretation of the\nstatute. Its method, as we understand it, is not particu\nlarly difficult to apply and it is certainly less complex than\nprior law, which provided for the accumulation of two\ndifferent kinds of good time credit (general and industrial),\ncalculated in different manners (prospectively and retro\nspectively), and awarded at different rates, depending on\nthe length of sentence imposed on the prisoner (5 to 10\ndays per month for general) or the year of employment (3\nor 5 days per month for industrial). See 18 U. S. C.\n§§4161, 4162 (1982 ed.).\n   Petitioners also point to various statements contained in\nthe Act’s Conference Report and made by individual legis\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlators that describe good time credit as providing sentence\nreductions of 15%. See Brief for Petitioners 34–36 (citing,\ne.g., H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 98–1159, p. 415 (1984); 131\nCong. Rec. 488 (1985) (remarks of Rep. Hamilton)). But\nthere is nothing in the context of these statements to\nsuggest that they amounted to anything other than rough\napproximations or that they were made with the present\ncontroversy in mind. See, e.g., H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 98–\n1159, at 415 (noting simply that an increase in the amount\nof maximum annual credit from 36 days to 54 days “in\ncreases ‘good time’ that accrues from 10 percent to 15\npercent”); 131 Cong. Rec. 488 (1985) (statement of Rep.\nHamilton) (“Under [pre-Sentencing Reform Act] law, about\n80% of all criminals are paroled after serving one third of\ntheir time. Now sentences will be reduced only 15% for\ngood behavior”). And whatever interpretive force one\nattaches to legislative history, the Court normally gives\nlittle weight to statements, such as those of the individual\nlegislators, made after the bill in question has become law.\nSee, e.g., Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S. 291, 298 (1995).\n   Third, petitioners rely on a statement in the United\nStates Sentencing Commission’s Supplementary Report on\nthe Initial Sentencing Guidelines and Policy Statements\nissued in 1987 (hereinafter Supplementary Report). In\nthat Report, the Commission summarized its analysis of\nrecent pre-Guidelines sentencing practice, which it had\nused to help draft the Guidelines. The results of the\nanalysis were presented in a table that permits compari\nson of the likely prison-time consequences of the new\nGuidelines with prison time actually served under pre-\nGuidelines practice (specifically, by identifying the Guide\nlines “offense level that is closest to the average time . . .\nserved by first-time offenders” convicted of a particular\ncrime, Supplementary Report 23). Because the Guidelines\n“refer to sentences prior to the awarding of good time” (i.e.,\nbecause a Guidelines sentence of, say, 30 months’ impris\n12                 BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nonment does not necessarily mean that the offender will\nserve the entire 30 months in prison), the Commission\nadjusted the average time served “by dividing by 0.85 good\ntime when the term exceeded 12 months.” Ibid. This\nadjustment, the Commission explained, “made sentences\nin the [t]able comparable with those in the guidelines.”\nIbid.\n   Pointing to this adjustment and a reference in later\neditions of the Guidelines to a potential credit of “ap\nproximately fifteen percent for good behavior,” see, e.g.,\nUSSG §1A3, p. s., at 3 (Nov. 2009), petitioners maintain\nthat the Commission set its Guideline ranges with the\nexpectation that well-behaved prisoners would receive\ngood time credit of up to 15% of the sentence imposed, not\n15% of the time actually served. They add that, in setting\nthe Guidelines ranges in this way, the Commission exer\ncised congressionally delegated power to interpret the\nSentencing Reform Act, see Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 371–\n379 (approving Congress’ delegation of the power to prom\nulgate sentencing guidelines), and that as long as that\ninterpretation is reasonable, courts must defer to it. See\nChevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Coun\ncil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843–844 (1984).\n   Again, however, we can find no indication that the\nCommission, in writing its Supplementary Report or in\nthe Guidelines themselves, considered or referred to the\nparticular question here before us, that is whether good\ntime credit is to be based on time served or the sentence\nimposed. The Guidelines Manual itself, a more authorita\ntive account of the Commission’s interpretive views than\nthe Supplementary Report, says nothing directly on that\nsubject. Moreover, with respect to comparisons between\nGuidelines sentences and pre-Guidelines practice, the\noriginal 1987 Manual cautioned that the Guidelines did\nnot “simply cop[y] estimates of existing practice as re\nvealed by the data,” but rather “departed from the data at\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndifferent points for various important reasons.” USSG\n§1A3, p. s., at 1.4; see also id., §1A4(g), p. s., at 1.11\n(while “Guideline sentences in many instances will ap\nproximate existing [i.e., pre-Guidelines] practice,” the\nCommission did “not conside[r] itself bound by existing\nsentencing practice” (emphasis added)). Because the\nCommission has expressed no view on the question before\nus, we need not decide whether it would be entitled to\ndeference had it done so. If it turns out that the calcula\ntion of good time credit based on prison time served rather\nthan the sentence imposed produces results that are more\nsevere than the Commission finds appropriate, the Com\nmission remains free to adjust sentencing levels accord\ningly. See id., §1A2, at 1.2 (acknowledging that “the\nguideline-writing process is evolutionary” and that the\nCommission functions “as a permanent agency to monitor\nsentencing practices in the federal courts throughout the\nnation”).\n   Fourth, petitioners ask us to invoke the rule of lenity\nand construe §3624 (2006 ed.) in their favor, that is, in a\nway that will maximize the amount of available good time\ncredit. We may assume for present purposes that §3624(b)\ncan be construed as imposing a criminal penalty. See\nBifulco v. United States, 447 U. S. 381, 387 (1980) (rule of\nlenity applies to “interpretations of . . . the penalties”\nimposed by “criminal prohibitions”); but see Sash v. Zenk,\n428 F. 3d 132, 134 (CA2 2005) (Sotomayor, J.) (holding\nthat §3624(b) is not a criminal statute for the purposes of\nthe rule of lenity). Even so, the rule of lenity only applies\nif, after considering text, structure, history, and purpose,\nthere remains a “grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the\nstatute,” Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 139\n(1998) (internal quotation marks omitted), such that the\nCourt must simply “ ‘guess as to what Congress intended.’ ”\nBifulco, supra, at 387 (quoting Ladner v. United States,\n358 U. S. 169, 178 (1958)). See United States v. Hayes,\n14                  BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 13); United States v.\nR. L. C., 503 U. S. 291, 305–306 (1992) (plurality opinion).\nHaving so considered the statute, we do not believe that\nthere remains a “grievous ambiguity or uncertainty” in the\nstatutory provision before us. Nor need we now simply\n“guess” what the statute means.\n  Finally, we note that petitioners urge us not to defer to\nthe BOP’s implementation of §3624(b). In our view, the\nBOP’s calculation system applies that statute as its lan\nguage is most naturally read, and in accordance with what\nthat language makes clear is its basic purpose. No one\ndoubts that the BOP has the legal power to implement the\nstatute in accordance with its language and purposes;\nhence we need not determine the extent to which Congress\nhas granted the BOP authority to interpret the statute\nmore broadly, or differently than it has done here. Cf.\nChevron, supra, at 844–845.\n                              B\n  Acknowledging that petitioners’ arguments cannot carry\nthe day, the dissent has proposed a “third possibility,”\npost, at 2 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.), not raised by either\nparty nor, to our knowledge, used elsewhere in the Crimi\nnal Code. The dissent reads the statutory phrase “term of\nimprisonment” to refer to “the administrative period along\nwhich progress toward eventual freedom is marked.” Post,\nat 3. It derives from this reading the following method of\ncalculation as applied to our 10-year example. First, “[t]he\nsentence is divided into 10 365-day segments.” Ibid. At\nthe end of the first segment, a prisoner may receive up to\n54 days of credit for good behavior. These credits immedi\nately “go toward completion of the next year” so that the\nprisoner need only serve “another 311 days behind bars\nbefore the second year of his term of imprisonment is at an\nend.” Ibid. This process repeats itself until the “10th\nsegment,” in which a prisoner receives an unspecified\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“credit in a prorated amount.” Ibid. In the end, the pris\noner will have served 10 “administrative segments,” ibid.,\ncollectively comprising 3,117 days in prison and 533 days\nof credit.\n   The dissent claims “[r]eading ‘term of imprisonment’\nthis way is consistent with all parts of the statute.” Post,\nat 4. We see at least four problems. First, the opening\nsentence of §3624(a) instructs that “[a] prisoner shall be\nreleased” upon “the expiration of the prisoner’s term of\nimprisonment, less any time credited” for good behavior.\nBut if a prisoner’s “term of imprisonment” is the “period\nthat a prisoner must complete in order to earn his free\ndom,” post, at 4, and it is “accounted for through a combi\nnation of prison time and credits,” post, at 3, then a pris\noner should be released exactly at the end of his term of\nimprisonment (without any further adjustment). Because\nthe dissent’s approach would require us to read words out\nof the statute, or give prisoners double credit, its definition\ncannot be used here.\n   Second, §3624(b)(1) tells us that a prisoner receives\ncredit “at the end of each year” based on behavior “during\nthat year.” Under the dissent’s approach, however, a\nprisoner may receive credit at the end of each “administra\ntive segmen[t]” presumably based on his behavior during\nthat segment. And because an “administrative segmen[t]”\nis made up of some “combination of service and credits,”\npost, at 4, each one lasts less than a calendar year. We do\nnot see how a system in which “a prisoner may complete a\nparticular year of his term in less than 365 calendar days,”\nibid., and receive full good time credit for doing so, can\npossibly represent the most natural reading of this statu\ntory language. Nor do we know, because the BOP has not\nhad an opportunity to tell us, whether a system in which a\n“year” lasts anywhere from 311 to 365 calendar days (and\nin which the “years” of a single prisoner’s sentence may all\nbe of different lengths), is easily administrable. (We doubt\n16                  BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat this system will be more comprehensible to prisoners\nthan one, like the BOP’s, that provides credit for actual\nyears.)\n   Third, under the dissent’s approach, credit is earned at\ndifferent rates during a single sentence. For the first\n“administrative segmen[t]” in its 10-year example, the\nprisoner serves 365 days and earns 54 days of credit. The\nratio of credit earned to days served is .148. For the sec\nond “administrative segmen[t],” the prisoner serves 311\ndays and earns 54 days of credit. This time, the ratio of\ncredit earned to days served is .174. (For the last “admin\nistrative segmen[t],” the dissent tells us the prisoner will\nreceive “credit in a prorated amount,” but it does not tell\nus which ratio should be used for the proration. Post, at\n3.) The use of different rates finds no support in the stat\nute. The dissent objects that the statute “prescribes no\nparticular rate,” post, at 7, but in fact it does—54 days of\ncredit per year of good behavior—and it further requires\nthat credit for the last year be “prorated” using the same\nproportion. Moreover, the dissent’s application of different\nrates leads to odd results. For example, a model prisoner\nsentenced on two separate 5-year terms (with a break in\nbetween) will serve a different number of days from one\nsentenced to a single 10-year term. How can this be if\nboth prisoners are earning 54 days of credit for each of\ntheir 10 years in prison?\n   Fourth, §3624(b)(2) provides that good time credit “shall\nvest on the date the prisoner is released from custody.”\n(This provision does not apply to prisoners, like petition\ners, who committed their offenses before it was amended\nin 1996, but the dissent plainly intends for its approach to\napply more broadly. See post, at 9 (noting the effect on\n“almost 200,000 federal prisoners”).) Yet under the dis\nsent’s approach, credit appears to vest immediately. See\npost, at 3 (Days of credit for the first year “go toward\ncompletion of the next year” so that the prisoner “would\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nneed another 311 days behind bars before the second year\nof his term of imprisonment is at an end”). And if it does\nnot, then the situation quickly becomes complicated.\nWhat happens if, say, on the last day of the 10th “adminis\ntrative segmen[t]” (somewhere in the 8th calendar year), a\nprisoner badly misbehaves and prison officials punish him\nby taking away all of his previously earned credit? Cf. 28\nCFR §541.13 (2009) (prescribing sanctions for prohibited\nacts). Does the BOP retroactively adjust the duration of\nall of his administrative segments to 365 days so that the\nprisoner now finds himself in the middle of the 8th “ad\nministrative segmen[t]”? (Again we do not know if the\nBOP would find such a system administrable, and we\ndoubt that this system would be more comprehensible to a\nprisoner.) If so, does the prisoner have a second opportu\nnity to earn credit for good behavior for the 9th “adminis\ntrative segmen[t]” that he had previously completed but\nnow must account for again? Cf. §3624(b)(1) (“Credit that\nhas not been earned may not later be granted”). Or, hav\ning previously awarded (and taken away) credit for that\nsegment, are prison authorities left without any incentive\nto offer for good behavior?\n  Finally, the dissent, like petitioners, invokes the rule of\nlenity to support its interpretation. But, the best efforts of\nthe dissent notwithstanding, we still see no “grievous\nambiguity or uncertainty” that would trigger the rule’s\napplication. We remain convinced that the BOP’s ap\nproach reflects the most natural reading of the statutory\nlanguage and the most consistent with its purpose. What\never the merits of the dissent’s policy arguments, the\nstatute does not require the BOP to accept them.\n\n For all of these reasons, we conclude that the BOP’s\nmethodology is lawful. The Ninth Circuit’s judgment is\n\n                                                    Affirmed.\n18                   BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\n\n                        APPENDIX\n\n  A fuller example of the BOP’s method for calculat\n  ing “credit for the last year or portion of a year of\n                the term of imprisonment”\n   The defendant is sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment.\nAs a prisoner he exhibits exemplary behavior and is\nawarded the maximum credit of 54 days at the end of each\nyear served in prison. At the end of Year 8, the prisoner\nhas 2 years remaining in his sentence and has accumu\nlated 432 days of good time credit. Because the difference\nbetween the time remaining in his sentence and the\namount of accumulated credit (i.e., 730 - 432) is less than a\nyear (298 days), Year 9 is the last year he will spend in\nprison. (Year 10 has been completely offset by 365 of the\n432 days of accumulated credit.) Further, Year 9 will be a\npartial year of 298 days (the other 67 days of the year\nbeing offset by the remainder of the accumulated credit).\n   Here is where the elementary algebra comes in. We\nknow that x, the good time, plus y, the remaining time\nserved, must add up to 298. This gives us our first equa\ntion: x + y = 298.\n   We also know that the ratio of good time earned in the\nportion of the final year to the amount of time served in\nthat year must equal the ratio of a full year’s good time\ncredit to the amount of time served in a full year. The\nlatter ratio is 54/365 or .148. Thus, we know that\nx/y = .148, or to put it another way, x = .148y. Because we\nknow the value of x in terms of y, we can make a substitu\ntion in our first equation to get .148y + y = 298. We then\nadd the two y terms together (1.148y = 298), and we solve\nfor y, which gives us y = 260. Now we can plug that value\ninto our first equation to solve for x (the good time credit).\nIf we subtract 260 from 298, we find that x = 38.\n   The offender will have to serve 260 days in prison in\nYear 9, and he will receive 38 days additional good time\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                Appendix to opinion of the Court\n\ncredit for that time served. The prisoner’s total good time\nis 470 days (432 + 38 = 470). His total time served is 3180\ndays.\n   As a final matter, while we have described the foregoing\nas the method to calculate credit for the portion of the last\nyear to more transparently track the relevant statutory\nlanguage, we note that the mathematical formula can be\nused to calculate the amount of maximum available credit\nfor an entire sentence. Using the equations supplied\nabove, if we divide the total number of days in a sentence\nby 1.148, we get the minimum number of days that a\ndefendant must serve in that sentence. If we then sub\ntract the number of days served from the total number of\ndays in the sentence, we arrive at the maximum number\nof good time credit days the prisoner can earn. The stat\nute, however, awards them on a yearly basis (but for the\n“last year or portion” thereof).\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

See Pet. for Cert. 11, and n. 2. It adopts this\nreading despite the existence of an alternative interpreta\ntion that is more consistent with the statute’s text. Absent\na clear congressional directive, the statute ought not to be\nread as the Court reads it. For the Court’s interpreta\ntion—an interpretation that in my submission is quite\nincorrect—imposes tens of thousands of years of additional\nprison time on federal prisoners according to a mathe\nmatical formula they will be unable to understand. And if\nthe only way to call attention to the human implications of\nthis case is to speak in terms of economics, then it should\nbe noted that the Court’s interpretation comes at a cost to\nthe taxpayers of untold millions of dollars. See id., at 11.\nThe interpretation the Court adopts, moreover, will be\ndevastating to the prisoners who have behaved the best\nand will undermine the purpose of the statute. These\nconsiderations, and those stated below, require this re\nspectful dissent.\n                            I\n  The federal sentencing statute at issue here provides:\n2                    BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n    “[A] prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of\n    more than 1 year[,] other than a term of imprisonment\n    for the duration of the prisoner’s life, may receive\n    credit toward the service of the prisoner’s sentence,\n    beyond the time served, of up to 54 days at the end of\n    each year of the prisoner’s term of imprisonment, be\n    ginning at the end of the first year of the term, subject\n    to determination by the Bureau of Prisons that, dur\n    ing that year, the prisoner has displayed exemplary\n    compliance with institutional disciplinary regula\n    tions. . . . [C]redit for the last year or portion of a year\n    of the term of imprisonment shall be prorated and\n    credited within the last six weeks of the sentence.” 18\n    U. S. C. §3624(b)(1) (emphasis added).\nAccording to the Court, the phrase “term of imprisonment”\nmust mean “time actually served” the third time that it\nappears in this particular subsection. But the Court gives\nthe phrase a different interpretation the first two times it\nis used in the very same sentence. This in itself indicates\nthat something is quite wrong here.\n   Petitioners invite the Court to read “term of imprison\nment” to mean “the sentence imposed.” This, too, seems\nunworkable. And it can be acknowledged that the Court’s\nrejection of this interpretation is correct.\n   The choice, however, is not just between the Court’s\nreading and that offered by petitioners. There is a third\npossibility, one more consistent with the statute than\neither of these two alternatives.\n   A fair reading of the statute, and a necessary reading to\naccomplish its purpose best, is to interpret the phrase\n“term of imprisonment” to refer to the span of time that a\nprisoner must account for in order to obtain release. The\nlength of the term is set at the outset by the criminal\nsentence imposed. The prisoner earns release when that\nterm has been fully completed. Most of the term will be\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nsatisfied through time spent behind bars. Assuming the\nprisoner is well behaved, however, he may earn good time\ncredits along the way; and those credits may substitute for\nactual prison time. Each year of the term comprises a full\n365 days, which must be accounted for through a combina\ntion of prison time and credits. Thus conceived, a pris\noner’s “term” is the administrative period along which\nprogress toward eventual freedom is marked.\n   Consider the Court’s example of a prisoner subject to a\nten-year sentence. See ante, at 2–4. The sentence is\ndivided into ten 365-day segments. Each segment consti\ntutes a year of the term. The prisoner will spend the first\n365 days behind bars. In the statute’s words, he has\nreached “the end of the first year of the term.” Now is the\ntime for credit to be awarded, and he may receive up to 54\ndays if sufficiently well behaved. Because he has already\ncompleted a full year of his term, those credits go toward\ncompletion of the next year. If, based on good behavior, he\nhas earned the maximum of 54 days, he would need an\nother 311 days behind bars before the second year of his\nterm of imprisonment is at an end (because 54 + 311 =\n365). If he has earned fewer than 54 days, a longer incar\nceration will be required to reach 365. Regardless, once\nthe prisoner reaches the end of the second year of his\nterm, he will again be eligible to receive good time credits.\n   This process repeats itself for the third year of the term,\nand so on. In the final year of his term (in this example,\nthe tenth segment into which his term has been divided),\nthe prisoner will receive credit in a prorated amount, to be\nawarded “within the last six weeks of the sentence.” This\nensures that the prisoner does not reach the end of year\nten, only to find that he has just earned 54 days of credit\nhe no longer needs.\n   The controlling rule is that each year of the prisoner’s\nterm—each of the ten administrative segments—\ncomprises 365 days that must be completed through a\n4                   BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ncombination of service and credits. By combining actual\nprison time with the credits he has earned, a prisoner may\ncomplete a particular year of his term in less than 365\ncalendar days. As a result, credits may enable a well\nbehaved prisoner to complete his ten-year sentence before\nten calendar years have elapsed. For a ten-year (3,650\nday) sentence, a prisoner will serve 3,117 days behind bars\nif he earns a maximum of approximately 533 credits. This\nis 63 more days of credit than under the Court’s reading—\nmore than 6 additional credit days for every year of the\nsentence imposed.\n   Reading “term of imprisonment” this way is consistent\nwith all parts of the statute. The prisoner receives his\ncredit “at the end of each year of [his] term of imprison\nment,” a process that “begin[s] at the end of the first year\nof the term.” Credit is only awarded if the prisoner has\nproven well behaved “during that year.” This interpreta\ntion fulfills the “objective of §3624”—rewarding a prisoner\nfor exemplary conduct during the preceding year. See\nante, at 8.\n   This approach also has a textual integrity that the\nCourt’s reading does not: It gives “term of imprisonment”\nthe same meaning each time it is used by the statute.\nEvery time it appears in §3624(b)(1), “term of imprison\nment” refers to the administrative period that a prisoner\nmust complete in order to earn his freedom. The Court, by\ncontrast, would read this phrase to mean “time actually\nserved” the third time it is used, but “the sentence im\nposed” the first two times it is used (“ ‘a prisoner who is\nserving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year[,]\nother than a term of imprisonment for the duration of the\nprisoner’s life’ ”). See ante, at 8–9. The Court’s interpreta\ntion thus runs afoul of the “ ‘presumption that a given\nterm is used to mean the same thing throughout a stat\nute.’ ” Ante, at 9 (quoting Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S.\n115, 118 (1994)). The inconsistency here is particularly\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\negregious because all three uses appear in the same sen\ntence. See id., at 118 (“[The] presumption [is] surely at its\nmost vigorous when a term is repeated within a given\nsentence”).\n   The Court responds by noting another part of the stat\nute, a provision stating that prisoners shall receive cloth\ning, money, and transportation “[u]pon the release of [the]\nprisoner on the expiration of the prisoner’s term of impris\nonment.” §3624(d). A prisoner is released at the end of\nhis actual time behind bars, says the Court, and so “term\nof imprisonment” must here refer to time actually served.\nYet release also comes at the end of a prisoner’s “term” in\nthe sense described above—that is, when the balance of\nthe sentence has been reduced to zero through a combina\ntion of prison time and good time credits. Indeed, this\nadministrative use of the phrase fits well with the word\n“expiration,” which in its most natural sense in this con\ntext refers to the close of a formal accounting period. See\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 619 (8th ed. 2004) (“A coming to\nan end; esp., a formal termination on a closing date”). By\ncontrast, it is awkward at best to say, as the Court would\nhave it, that a prisoner’s actual time behind bars is some\nthing that “expires.”\n   The Court’s approach produces yet another oddity. The\nstatute requires that prorated credit be awarded for “the\nlast year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment.”\nOne might naturally assume that the last year of a ten\nyear term would be year ten. That is how things work\nunder the approach described above, in which a ten-year\nsentence is subdivided into ten administrative segments.\n   But under the Court’s reading, a prisoner serving a ten\nyear sentence will never reach year ten of his term; year\nten simply does not exist. According to the Court, year\nnine is the final year, and even year nine is not a full year:\nIt lasts “no more than 298 days.” Ante, at 3. If this\nsounds confusing, it will be all the more so to the prisoner\n6                   BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nwho has just received his sentence and turns to the statute\nbooks to figure out when to expect his freedom.\n   The Court does not even attempt to defend these flaws.\nInstead, it points to four supposed defects in the approach\ndescribed above. None withstands examination.\n   First, the Court notes that the statute requires the\nrelease of a prisoner “upon ‘the expiration of the prisoner’s\nterm of imprisonment, less any time credited’ for good\nbehavior.” Ante, at 15 (quoting §3624(a)). But if “term of\nimprisonment” truly refers to the entire span that a pris\noner must complete to earn his freedom—a period that\naccounts both for actual time and for good time credits—\nthen why would the “less any time credited” language be\nappropriate? The answer is that this provision—which\nappears at the very beginning of the section entitled “Re\nlease of a prisoner”—announces to a prisoner when release\nmay be expected: when the prisoner’s term expires, taking\ninto account credit days “as provided in subsection (b).”\n§3624(a) (bold face deleted). This use of language is com\nmon. A debtor who says “I will write a check for what I\nowe you, less what you owe me” is simply saying “I will\npay what I owe, taking into account your debts to me.”\nPerhaps the same meaning could have been conveyed\nusing different words, but this is hardly probative.\n   Second, the Court alleges that the above approach con\nflicts with the statute’s requirement that credit be\nawarded “at the end of each year” based upon behavior\n“during that year.” After all, if a year of the term can be\nsatisfied in part through credit, then it may last less than\na full calendar year. Yet the statute does not require that\ncredit be awarded at the end of a calendar year for good\nbehavior during a calendar year. What it requires is that\ncredit be awarded “at the end of each year of the prisoner’s\nterm of imprisonment” for good behavior “during that\nyear.” And this is precisely what the above approach does.\n   Third, the Court frets that, under the approach above,\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nprisoners will earn credit at different rates during a single\nsentence. It admonishes that “[t]he use of different rates\nfinds no support in the statute.” Ante, at 16. This re\nsponse is telling. The statute, in fact, prescribes no par\nticular rate—and certainly no formula based on a rate—\nexcept as embodied in one clear directive: Prisoners are\neligible to earn “up to 54 days at the end of each year of\nthe prisoner’s term of imprisonment.” As to that com\nmand, the above approach is perfectly faithful.\n   Fourth, the Court suggests that the above approach\ncauses credit to vest immediately, contrary to the statute.\nAgain, this is not true. As per the statute, credit only\nvests “on the date the prisoner is released from custody,”\n§3624(b)(2), meaning that it can be revoked at any time\nbefore that date. This gives prisoners approaching their\nrelease date an extra incentive to behave.\n   As a fallback, the Court wonders what would happen if\na prisoner misbehaved on the final day of his ten-year\nsentence. Would the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) be forced to\n“retroactively adjust the duration of all of his [term years]\nto 365 days”? Ante, at 17. The answer is what one might\nsuppose: A prisoner whose credits are revoked will find\nhimself precisely where he would have been if those cred\nits had never been earned. All years of the term remain\n365 days, as they always have. But a misbehaving pris\noner who had formerly earned, say, 500 credits will find\nhimself without the benefit of those 500 days. That will\nleave him with more of his term to complete—500 days\nmore, to be precise. If he behaves well again, he can re\nsume earning credit for the remainder of his term, but he\nhas lost the opportunity to earn credits for any prior years.\nSee §3624(b)(1). This is not at all confusing for a prisoner;\nand certainly it is as straightforward, if not more so, than\nthe Court’s approach. The Court’s view causes a prisoner’s\n“term of imprisonment” to shrink over time according to\nan algebraic formula, only to expand again if he misbe\n8                    BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nhaves.\n   Finally, the Court speculates that BOP might find the\nabove approach difficult to administer. The Court identi\nfies no basis for this claim, nor does one exist. The infor\nmation used to calculate a prisoner’s term under the above\napproach is the same as it is under the Court’s approach.\nTrue, a prisoner may become eligible to be awarded credit\non different calendar days during the course of his term.\nBut under the Court’s approach, this also happens when\nawarding credit in the final year. And, it goes without\nsaying, federal prisoners begin their incarceration on\ndifferent calendar days anyway, so that under any ap\nproach, BOP will be forced to evaluate prisoners through\nout the calendar year.\n                               II\n   The Court’s reading of §3624(b)(1), therefore, is less\nconsistent with the text than the reading explained above.\nBut even if these interpretations were in equipoise, under\nany fair application the rule of lenity should tip the bal\nance in petitioners’ favor. When a penal statute is suscep\ntible of two interpretations, the one more favorable to the\ndefendant must be chosen unless “text, structure, and\nhistory . . . establish that the [harsher] position is unam\nbiguously correct.” United States v. Granderson, 511 U. S.\n39, 54 (1994). Resolving ambiguity in favor of lenity en\nsures that statutes provide “fair warning[,] . . . in language\nthat the common world will understand, of what the law\nintends to do if a certain line is passed.” United States v.\nBass, 404 U. S. 336, 348 (1971) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The rule thus applies “not only to interpreta\ntions of the substantive ambit of criminal prohibitions, but\nalso to the penalties they impose.” Bifulco v. United\nStates, 447 U. S. 381, 387 (1980).\n   The Court assumes without deciding that §3624(b) is\npenal in nature. See ante, at 13. No assumption is neces\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nsary: The statutory provision awarding good time credits\n“in fact is one determinant of [a] prison term,” so that a\nprisoner’s “effective sentence is altered once this determi\nnant is changed.” Weaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24, 32\n(1981). In Weaver, the Court considered whether an\namendment to Florida’s statutory formula for calculating\ngood time credits implicated the Ex Post Facto Clause.\nThe Court concluded that it did, as the new statute “sub\nstantially alter[ed] the consequences attached to a crime\nalready completed, and therefore change[d] ‘the quantum\nof punishment.’ ” Id., at 33 (quoting Dobbert v. Florida,\n432 U. S. 282, 294 (1977)). For the same reason, the penal\neffect of §3624(b)(1) is substantial enough to implicate the\nrule of lenity. We should not disadvantage almost 200,000\nfederal prisoners unless Congress clearly warned them\nthey would face that harsh result.\n                              III\n   The Government—although not the Court—argues that\nwe should embrace its interpretation out of deference to\nBOP. BOP has been charged by the Attorney General\nwith responsibility for “[a]pproving inmate disciplinary\nand good time regulations.” 28 CFR §0.96(s) (2009). BOP\nhas long followed the same credit-calculation method now\nadvocated by the Court. The Government argues that we\nshould defer to BOP’s choice as a permissible exercise of\nits delegated responsibility.\n   This argument fails on multiple levels. There is no\nindication that BOP has exercised the sort of interpretive\nauthority that would merit deference under Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U. S. 837 (1984). The statute does not create a legis\nlative gap for BOP to fill. To the contrary, the procedures\nthat govern the timing of credit awards are spelled out in\ngreat detail. Cf. Lopez v. Davis, 531 U. S. 230, 241–242\n(2001) (where statute says that BOP “may” grant early\n10                  BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nrelease to certain prisoners, without specifying further\ncriteria, Congress deliberately created a “statutory gap”).\nThe statute even goes so far as to explain what to do “[i]f\nthe date for a prisoner’s release falls on a Saturday, a\nSunday, or a legal holiday.” §3624(a). This legislative\nspecificity as to timing contrasts with other provisions\nthat do delegate authority to BOP. E.g., §3624(b)(1)\n(awarding of credit is “subject to determination” by BOP\nthat the prisoner “has displayed exemplary compliance\nwith institutional disciplinary regulations”).\n   BOP has not claimed that its view is the product of any\n“formal administrative procedure tending to foster the\nfairness and deliberation that should underlie a pro\nnouncement” with the force of law. United States v. Mead\nCorp., 533 U. S. 218, 230 (2001). In 2005, BOP made final\nan administrative rule adopting its preferred methodology.\n70 Fed. Reg. 66752 (adopting 28 CFR §523.20). But when\npressed during an earlier stage of this litigation, BOP\nconceded that it had “failed to articulate in the adminis\ntrative record the rationale upon which it relied when it\npromulgated” the rule. Tablada v. Thomas, 533 F. 3d 800,\n805 (CA9 2008). The Court of Appeals accepted BOP’s\nconcession, ibid., and that aspect of its ruling has not been\nappealed.\n   As a fallback position, the Government argues that\nBOP’s interpretation should receive at least some defer\nence under Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134 (1944).\nBut under Skidmore, an agency decision only merits “re\nspect proportional to its ‘power to persuade.’ ” Mead,\nsupra, at 235 (quoting Skidmore, supra, at 140). BOP’s\nposition is of long standing, but the administrative record\nis noteworthy for what it does not contain—namely, any\nreasoned justification for preferring BOP’s methodology\nover statutorily permissible alternatives. BOP has consis\ntently adhered to its mistaken belief that its approach is\nthe only one that can be squared with the text. See 62\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nFed. Reg. 50786 (1997) (explanation to interim rule assert\ning that the correct methodology “had been clearly stated\nby statute since the implementation of the Sentencing\nReform Act of 1984”). For example, at no point did BOP\nconsider, much less consciously reject, the interpretation\noutlined here. Cf. Reno v. Koray, 515 U. S. 50, 60–61\n(1995) (deferring to BOP’s reasoned decision to reject one\ninterpretation in favor of another). An agency need not\nconsider all possible alternatives. But deference is not\nowed to an agency view, however consistently held, that\nfrom the start has been premised on legal error. See\nMead, supra, at 228; Skidmore, supra, at 140.\n                        *     *     *\n  The straightforward interpretation urged here accords\nwith the purpose of the statute, which is to give prisoners\nincentive for good behavior and dignity from its promised\nreward. Prisoners can add 54 days to each year. And\nwhen they do so, they have something tangible. In place\nof that simple calculation, of clear meaning, of a calendar\nthat can be marked, the Court insists on something differ\nent. It advocates an interpretation that uses different\ndefinitions for the same phrase in the same sentence;\ndenies prisoners the benefit of the rule of lenity; and caps\noff its decision with an appendix that contains an alge\nbraic formula to hang on a cell wall.\n  To a prisoner, time behind bars is not some theoreti\ncal or mathematical concept. It is something real, even\nterrifying. Survival itself may be at stake. See Dept.\nof Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, C.
