FLORIDA\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 09–5327. Argued March 1, 2010—Decided June 14, 2010\nPetitioner Holland was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced\n  to death in Florida state court. After the State Supreme Court af\n  firmed on direct appeal and denied collateral relief, Holland filed a\n  pro se federal habeas corpus petition, which was approximately five\n  weeks late under the 1-year statute of limitations set forth in the An\n  titerrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28\n  U. S. C. §2244(d). The record facts reveal, inter alia, that Holland’s\n  court-appointed attorney, Bradley Collins, had failed to file a timely\n  federal petition, despite Holland’s many letters emphasizing the im\n  portance of doing so; that Collins apparently did not do the research\n  necessary to find out the proper filing date, despite the fact that Hol\n  land had identified the applicable legal rules for him; that Collins\n  failed to inform Holland in a timely manner that the State Supreme\n  Court had decided his case, despite Holland’s many pleas for that in\n  formation; and that Collins failed to communicate with Holland over\n  a period of years, despite Holland’s pleas for responses to his letters.\n  Meanwhile, Holland repeatedly requested that the state courts and\n  the Florida bar remove Collins from his case. Based on these and\n  other record facts, Holland asked the Federal District Court to toll\n  the AEDPA limitations period for equitable reasons. It refused, hold\n  ing that he had not demonstrated the due diligence necessary to in\n  voke equitable tolling. Affirming, the Eleventh Circuit held that, re\n  gardless of diligence, Holland’s case did not constitute “extraordinary\n  circumstances.” Specifically, it held that when a petitioner seeks to\n  excuse a late filing based on his attorney’s unprofessional conduct,\n  that conduct, even if grossly negligent, cannot justify equitable toll\n  ing absent proof of bad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, mental im\n  pairment, or the like.\n2                       HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld:\n    1. Section 2244(d), the AEDPA statute of limitations, is subject to\n equitable tolling in appropriate cases. Pp. 12–21.\n       (a) Several considerations support the Court’s holding. First, be\n cause AEDPA’s “statute of limitations defense . . . is not ‘jurisdic\n tional,’ ” Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198, 205, 213, it is subject to a\n “rebuttable presumption” in favor “of equitable tolling,” Irwin v. De\n partment of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95–96. That presump\n tion’s strength is reinforced here by the fact that “equitable princi\n ples” have traditionally “governed” substantive habeas law. Munaf v.\n Geren, 553 U. S. 674, ___, and the fact that Congress enacted AEDPA\n after Irwin and therefore was likely aware that courts, when inter\n preting AEDPA’s timing provisions, would apply the presumption,\n see, e.g., Merck & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U. S. ___, ___. Second,\n §2244(d) differs significantly from the statutes at issue in United\n States v. Brockamp, 519 U. S. 347, 350–352, and United States v.\n Beggerly, 524 U. S. 38, 49, in which the Court held that Irwin’s pre\n sumption had been overcome. For example, unlike the subject mat\n ters at issue in those cases—tax collection and land claims—\n AEDPA’s subject matter, habeas corpus, pertains to an area of the\n law where equity finds a comfortable home. See Munaf, supra, at\n ___. Brockamp, supra, at 352, distinguished. Moreover, AEDPA’s\n limitations period is neither unusually generous nor unusually com\n plex. Finally, the Court disagrees with respondent’s argument that\n equitable tolling undermines AEDPA’s basic purpose of eliminating\n delays in the federal habeas review process, see, e.g., Day, supra, at\n 205–206. AEDPA seeks to do so without undermining basic habeas\n corpus principles and by harmonizing the statute with prior law, un\n der which a petition’s timeliness was always determined under equi\n table principles. See, e.g., Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 483.\n Such harmonization, along with the Great Writ’s importance as the\n only writ explicitly protected by the Constitution, counsels hesitancy\n before interpreting AEDPA’s silence on equitable tolling as congres\n sional intent to close courthouse doors that a strong equitable claim\n would keep open. Pp. 12–16.\n       (b) The Eleventh Circuit’s per se standard is too rigid. A “peti\n tioner” is “entitled to equitable tolling” if he shows “(1) that he has\n been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary\n circumstance stood in his way” and prevented timely filing. Pace v.\n DiGuglielmo, 544 U. S. 408, 418. Such “extraordinary circumstances”\n are not limited to those that satisfy the Eleventh Circuit’s test.\n Courts must often “exercise [their] equity powers . . . on a case-by\n case basis,” Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U. S. 360, 375, demonstrating\n “flexibility” and avoiding “mechanical rules,” Holmberg v. Armbrecht,\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  327 U. S. 392, 396, in order to “relieve hardships . . . aris[ing] from a\n  hard and fast adherence” to more absolute legal rules, Hazel-Atlas\n  Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U. S. 238, 248. The Court’s\n  cases recognize that equity courts can and do draw upon decisions\n  made in other similar cases for guidance, exercising judgment in light\n  of precedent, but with awareness of the fact that specific circum\n  stances, often hard to predict, could warrant special treatment in an\n  appropriate case. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 753, distin\n  guished. No pre-existing rule of law or precedent demands the Elev\n  enth Circuit’s rule. That rule is difficult to reconcile with more gen\n  eral equitable principles in that it fails to recognize that, at least\n  sometimes, an attorney’s unprofessional conduct can be so egregious\n  as to create an extraordinary circumstance warranting equitable toll\n  ing, as several other federal courts have specifically held. Although\n  equitable tolling is not warranted for “a garden variety claim of ex\n  cusable neglect,” Irwin, supra, at 96, this case presents far more seri\n  ous instances of attorney misconduct than that. Pp. 16–19.\n    2. While the record facts suggest that this case may well present\n  “extraordinary” circumstances, the Court does not state its conclusion\n  absolutely because more proceedings may be necessary. The District\n  Court incorrectly rested its ruling not on a lack of such circum\n  stances, but on a lack of diligence. Here, Holland diligently pursued\n  his rights by writing Collins numerous letters seeking crucial infor\n  mation and providing direction, by repeatedly requesting that Collins\n  be removed from his case, and by filing his own pro se habeas petition\n  on the day he learned his AEDPA filing period had expired. Because\n  the District Court erroneously concluded that Holland was not dili\n  gent, and because the Court of Appeals erroneously relied on an\n  overly rigid per se approach, no lower court has yet considered\n  whether the facts of this case indeed constitute extraordinary cir\n  cumstances sufficient to warrant equitable tolling. The Eleventh\n  Circuit may determine on remand whether such tolling is appropri\n  ate, or whether an evidentiary hearing and other proceedings might\n  indicate that the State should prevail.

FLORIDA\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 14, 2010] \n\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  We here decide that the timeliness provision in the\nfederal habeas corpus statute is subject to equitable toll\ning. See Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. §2244(d). We also consider its\napplication in this case. In the Court of Appeals’ view,\nwhen a petitioner seeks to excuse a late filing on the basis\nof his attorney’s unprofessional conduct, that conduct,\neven if it is “negligent” or “grossly negligent,” cannot “rise\nto the level of egregious attorney misconduct” that would\nwarrant equitable tolling unless the petitioner offers\n“proof of bad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, mental\nimpairment or so forth.” 539 F. 3d 1334, 1339 (CA11\n2008) (per curiam). In our view, this standard is too rigid.\nSee Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89,\n96 (1990); see also Lawrence v. Florida, 549 U. S. 327, 336\n(2007). We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals and remand for further proceedings.\n                            I\n  AEDPA states that “[a] 1-year period of limitation shall\napply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a\nperson in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State\n2                   HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt.” §2244(d)(1). It also says that “[t]he time during\nwhich a properly filed application for State post-conviction\n. . . review” is “pending shall not be counted” against the 1\nyear period. §2244(d)(2).\n    On January 19, 2006, Albert Holland filed a pro se\nhabeas corpus petition in the Federal District Court for\nthe Southern District of Florida. Both Holland (the peti\ntioner) and the State of Florida (the respondent) agree\nthat, unless equitably tolled, the statutory limitations\nperiod applicable to Holland’s petition expired approxi\nmately five weeks before the petition was filed. See Brief\nfor Respondent 9, and n. 7; Brief for Petitioner 5, and n. 4.\nHolland asked the District Court to toll the limitations\nperiod for equitable reasons. We shall set forth in some\ndetail the record facts that underlie Holland’s claim.\n                                A\n   In 1997, Holland was convicted of first-degree murder\nand sentenced to death. The Florida Supreme Court\naffirmed that judgment. Holland v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1704897\"><a href=\"/opinion/1704897/holland-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">773</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1065</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Fla. 2000). On October 1, 2001, this Court denied Hol\nland’s petition for certiorari. 534 U. S. 834. And on that\ndate—the date that our denial of the petition ended fur\nther direct review of Holland’s conviction—the 1-year\nAEDPA limitations clock began to run. See 28 U. S. C.\n§2244(d)(1)(A); Jimenez v. Quarterman, 555 U. S. ___, ___\n(2009) (slip op., at 6).\n   Thirty-seven days later, on November 7, 2001, Florida\nappointed attorney Bradley Collins to represent Holland\nin all state and federal postconviction proceedings. Cf.\nFla. Stat. §§27.710, 27.711(2) (2007). By September 19,\n2002—316 days after his appointment and 12 days before\nthe 1-year AEDPA limitations period expired—Collins,\nacting on Holland’s behalf, filed a motion for postconvic\ntion relief in the state trial court. Cf. Brief for Respondent\n9, n. 7. That filing automatically stopped the running of\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe AEDPA limitations period, §2244(d)(2), with, as we\nhave said, 12 days left on the clock.\n  For the next three years, Holland’s petition remained\npending in the state courts. During that time, Holland\nwrote Collins letters asking him to make certain that all of\nhis claims would be preserved for any subsequent federal\nhabeas corpus review. Collins wrote back, stating, “I\nwould like to reassure you that we are aware of state-time\nlimitations and federal exhaustion requirements.” App.\n55. He also said that he would “presen[t] . . . to the . . .\nfederal courts” any of Holland’s claims that the state\ncourts denied. Ibid. In a second letter Collins added,\n“should your Motion for Post-Conviction Relief be denied”\nby the state courts, “your state habeas corpus claims will\nthen be ripe for presentation in a petition for writ of ha\nbeas corpus in federal court.” Id., at 61.\n  In mid-May 2003 the state trial court denied Holland\nrelief, and Collins appealed that denial to the Florida\nSupreme Court. Almost two years later, in February\n2005, the Florida Supreme Court heard oral argument in\nthe case. See 539 F. 3d, at 1337. But during that 2-year\nperiod, relations between Collins and Holland began to\nbreak down. Indeed, between April 2003 and January\n2006, Collins communicated with Holland only three\ntimes—each time by letter. See No. 1:06–cv–20182–PAS\n(SD Fla., Apr. 27, 2007), p. 7, n. 6 (hereinafter District\nCourt opinion), App. 91, n. 6.\n  Holland, unhappy with this lack of communication,\ntwice wrote to the Florida Supreme Court, asking it to\nremove Collins from his case. In the second letter, filed on\nJune 17, 2004, he said that he and Collins had experi\nenced “a complete breakdown in communication.” App.\n160. Holland informed the court that Collins had “not\nkept [him] updated on the status of [his] capital case” and\nthat Holland had “not seen or spoken to” Collins “since\nApril 2003.” Id., at 150. He wrote, “Mr. Collins has aban\n4                  HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndoned [me]” and said, “[I have] no idea what is going on\nwith [my] capital case on appeal.” Id., at 152. He added\nthat “Collins has never made any reasonable effort to\nestablish any relationship of trust or confidence with\n[me],” id., at 155, and stated that he “does not trust” or\nhave “any confidence in Mr. Collin’s ability to represent\n[him],” id., at 152. Holland concluded by asking that\nCollins be “dismissed (removed) off his capital case” or\nthat he be given a hearing in order to demonstrate Collins’\ndeficiencies. Id., at 155, 161. The State responded that\nHolland could not file any pro se papers with the court\nwhile he was represented by counsel, including papers\nseeking new counsel. Id., at 42–45. The Florida Supreme\nCourt agreed and denied Holland’s requests. Id., at 46.\n  During this same period Holland wrote various letters to\nthe Clerk of the Florida Supreme Court. In the last of\nthese he wrote, “[I]f I had a competent, conflict-free, post\nconviction, appellate attorney representing me, I would not\nhave to write you this letter. I’m not trying to get on your\nnerves. I just would like to know exactly what is happen\ning with my case on appeal to the Supreme Court of Flor\nida.” Id., at 147. During that same time period, Holland\nalso filed a complaint against Collins with the Florida Bar\nAssociation, but the complaint was denied. Id., at 65–67.\n  Collins argued Holland’s appeal before the Florida\nSupreme Court on February 10, 2005. 539 F. 3d, at 1337.\nShortly thereafter, Holland wrote to Collins emphasizing\nthe importance of filing a timely petition for habeas corpus\nin federal court once the Florida Supreme Court issued its\nruling. Specifically, on March 3, 2005, Holland wrote:\n    “Dear Mr. Collins, P. A.:\n      “How are you? Fine I hope.\n      “I write this letter to ask that you please write me\n    back, as soon as possible to let me know what the\n    status of my case is on appeal to the Supreme Court of\n                Cite as: 560 U.

Fine I hope.\n      “On March 3, 2005 I wrote you a letter, asking that\n    you let me know the status of my case on appeal to the\n    Supreme Court of Florida.\n      “Also, have you begun preparing my 28 U. S. C.\n    §2254 writ of Habeas Corpus petition? Please let me\n    know, as soon as possible.\n      “Thank you.” Id., at 212 (emphasis added).\nBut again, Collins did not reply.\n  Five months later, in November 2005, the Florida Su\npreme Court affirmed the lower court decision denying\nHolland relief.

Three weeks after that, on December 1, 2005, the\ncourt issued its mandate, making its decision final. 539\nF. 3d, at 1337. At that point, the AEDPA federal habeas\nclock again began to tick—with 12 days left on the 1-year\nmeter. See Coates v. Byrd, 211 F. 3d 1225 (CA11 2000)\n(per curiam) (AEDPA clock restarts when state court\ncompletes postconviction review); Lawrence, 549 U. S. 327\n(same). Twelve days later, on December 13, 2005, Hol\nland’s AEDPA time limit expired.\n                         B\n  Four weeks after the AEDPA time limit expired, on\n6                  HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nJanuary 9, 2006, Holland, still unaware of the Florida\nSupreme Court ruling issued in his case two months ear\nlier, wrote Collins a third letter:\n    “Dear Mr. Bradley M. Collins:\n       “How are you? Fine I hope.\n       “I write this letter to ask that you please let me\n    know the status of my appeals before the Supreme\n    Court of Florida.

S. C.\n    Rule 2254 Federal Habeas Corpus Petition will have\n    to be timely filed in and that court’s address?\n       “Thank you very much.” App. 214.\nCollins did not answer.\n  Nine days later, on January 18, 2006, Holland, working\nin the prison library, learned for the first time that the\nFlorida Supreme Court had issued a final determination\nin his case and that its mandate had issued—five weeks\nprior. 539 F. 3d, at 1337. He immediately wrote out his\nown pro se federal habeas petition and mailed it to the\nFederal District Court for the Southern District of Florida\nthe next day. Ibid. The petition begins by stating,\n      “Comes now Albert R. Holland, Jr., a Florida death\n    row inmate and states that court appointed counsel\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Rule 2254\n    Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus on my behalf.”\n    App. 181.\nIt then describes the various constitutional claims that\nHolland hoped to assert in federal court.\n  The same day that he mailed that petition, Holland\nreceived a letter from Collins telling him that Collins\nintended to file a petition for certiorari in this Court from\nthe State Supreme Court’s most recent ruling. Holland\nanswered immediately:\n    “Dear Mr. Bradley M. Collins:\n         .           .           .          .             .\n      “Since recently, the Supreme Court of Florida has\n    denied my [postconviction] and state writ of Habeas\n    Corpus Petition. I am left to understand that you are\n    planning to seek certiorari on these matters.\n      “It’s my understanding that the AEDPA time limi\n    tations is not tolled during discretionary appellate re\n    views, such as certiorari applications resulting from\n    denial of state post conviction proceedings.\n      “Therefore, I advise you not to file certiorari if doing\n    so affects or jeopardizes my one year grace period as\n    prescribed by the AEDPA.\n      “Thank you very much.” Id., at 216 (some emphasis\n    deleted).\nHolland was right about the law. See Coates, supra, at\n1226–1227 (AEDPA not tolled during pendency of petition\nfor certiorari from judgment denying state postconviction\nreview); accord, Lawrence v. Florida, 421 F. 3d 1221, 1225\n(CA11 2005), aff’d, 549 U. S., at 331–336.\n  On January 26, 2006, Holland tried to call Collins from\nprison. But he called collect and Collins’ office would not\naccept the call. App. 218. Five days later, Collins wrote to\nHolland and told him for the very first time that, as\n8                  HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCollins understood AEDPA law, the limitations period\napplicable to Holland’s federal habeas application had in\nfact expired in 2000—before Collins had begun to repre\nsent Holland. Specifically, Collins wrote:\n    “Dear Mr. Holland:\n       “I am in receipt of your letter dated January 20,\n    2006 concerning operation of AEDPA time limitations.\n    One hurdle in our upcoming efforts at obtaining fed\n    eral habeas corpus relief will be that the one-year\n    statutory time frame for filing such a petition began to\n    run after the case was affirmed on October 5, 2000\n    [when your] Judgment and Sentence . . . were af\n    firmed by the Florida Supreme Court. However, it\n    was not until November 7, 2001, that I received the\n    Order appointing me to the case. As you can see, I\n    was appointed about a year after your case became fi\n    nal. . . .\n       “[T]he AEDPA time period [thus] had run before my\n    appointment and therefore before your [postconvic\n    tion] motion was filed.” Id., at 78–79 (emphasis\n    added).\n  Collins was wrong about the law. As we have said,\nHolland’s 1-year limitations period did not begin to run\nuntil this Court denied Holland’s petition for certiorari\nfrom the state courts’ denial of relief on direct review,\nwhich occurred on October 1, 2001. See 28 U. S. C.\n§2244(d)(1)(A); Jimenez, 555 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6);\nBond v. Moore, 309 F. 3d 770, 774 (CA11 2002). And when\nCollins was appointed (on November 7, 2001) the AEDPA\nclock therefore had 328 days left to go.\n  Holland immediately wrote back to Collins, pointing this\nout.\n    “Dear Mr. Collins:\n      “I received your letter dated January 31, 2006. You\n    are incorrect in stating that ‘the one-year statutory\n             Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             9\n\n                 Opinion of the Court\n\ntime frame for filing my 2254 petition began to run af\nter my case was affirmed on October 5, 2000, by the\nFlorida Supreme Court.’ As stated on page three of\n[the recently filed] Petition for a writ of certiorari, Oc\ntober 1, 2001 is when the United States Supreme\nCourt denied my initial petition for writ of certiorari\nand that is when my case became final. That meant\nthat the time would be tolled once I filed my [postcon\nviction] motion in the trial court.\n   “Also, Mr. Collins you never told me that my time\nran out (expired). I told you to timely file my 28\nU. S. C. 2254 Habeas Corpus Petition before the dead\nline, so that I would not be time-barred.\n   “You never informed me of oral arguments or of the\nSupreme Court of Florida’s November 10, 2005 deci\nsion denying my postconviction appeals. You never\nkept me informed about the status of my case, al\nthough you told me that you would immediately in\nform me of the court’s decision as soon as you heard\nanything.\n   “Mr. Collins, I filed a motion on January 19, 2006\n[in federal court] to preserve my rights, because I did\nnot want to be time-barred. Have you heard anything\nabout the aforesaid motion? Do you know what the\nstatus of aforesaid motion is?\n   “Mr. Collins, please file my 2254 Habeas Petition\nimmediately. Please do not wait any longer, even\nthough it will be untimely filed at least it will be filed\nwithout wasting anymore time. (valuable time).\n   “Again, please file my 2254 Petition at once.\n   “Your letter is the first time that you have ever\nmentioned anything to me about my time had run out,\nbefore you were appointed to represent me, and that\nmy one-year started to run on October 5, 2000.\n   “Please find out the status of my motion that I filed\non January 19, 2006 and let me know.\n10                  HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n      “Thank you very much.” App. 222–223.\nCollins did not answer this letter. Nor did he file a federal\nhabeas petition as Holland requested.\n   On March 1, 2006, Holland filed another complaint\nagainst Collins with the Florida Bar Association. See\nRecord, Doc. 41, Exh. 1, p. 8. This time the bar asked\nCollins to respond, which he did, through his own attor\nney, on March 21. Id., at 2. And the very next day, over\nthree months after Holland’s AEDPA statute of limita\ntions had expired, Collins mailed a proposed federal ha\nbeas petition to Holland, asking him to review it. See id.,\nDoc. 20, Exh. W.\n   But by that point Holland had already filed a pro se\nmotion in the District Court asking that Collins be dis\nmissed as his attorney. App. 192. The State responded to\nthat request by arguing once again that Holland could not\nfile a pro se motion seeking to have Collins removed while\nhe was represented by counsel, i.e., represented by Collins.\nSee id., at 47–51. But this time the court considered\nHolland’s motion, permitted Collins to withdraw from the\ncase, and appointed a new lawyer for Holland. See Re\ncord, Docs. 9–10, 17–18, 22. And it also received briefing\non whether the circumstances of the case justified the\nequitable tolling of the AEDPA limitations period for a\nsufficient period of time (approximately five weeks) to\nmake Holland’s petition timely.\n                              C\n  After considering the briefs, the Federal District Court\nheld that the facts did not warrant equitable tolling and\nthat consequently Holland’s petition was untimely. The\ncourt, noting that Collins had prepared numerous filings\non Holland’s behalf in the state courts, and suggesting\nthat Holland was a difficult client, intimated, but did not\nhold, that Collins’ professional conduct in the case was at\nworst merely “negligent.” See District Court opinion 7–8,\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nApp. 90–93. But the court rested its holding on an alter\nnative rationale: It wrote that, even if Collins’ “behavior\ncould be characterized as an ‘extraordinary circum\nstance,’ ” Holland “did not seek any help from the court\nsystem to find out the date [the] mandate issued denying\nhis state habeas petition, nor did he seek aid from ‘outside\nsupporters.’ ” Id., at 8, App. 92. Hence, the court held,\nHolland did not “demonstrate” the “due diligence” neces\nsary to invoke “equitable tolling.” Ibid.\n    On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit agreed with the District\nCourt that Holland’s habeas petition was untimely. The\nCourt of Appeals first agreed with Holland that\n“ ‘[e]quitable tolling can be applied to . . . AEDPA’s statu\ntory deadline.’ ” 539 F. 3d, at 1338 (quoting Helton v.\nSecretary for Dept. of Corrections, 259 F. 3d 1310, 1312\n(CA11 2001)). But it also held that equitable tolling could\nnot be applied in a case, like Holland’s, that involves no\nmore than “[p]ure professional negligence” on the part of a\npetitioner’s attorney because such behavior can never\nconstitute an “extraordinary circumstance.” 539 F. 3d, at\n1339. The court wrote:\n    “We will assume that Collins’s alleged conduct is neg\n    ligent, even grossly negligent. But in our view, no al\n    legation of lawyer negligence or of failure to meet a\n    lawyer’s standard of care—in the absence of an allega\n    tion and proof of bad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty,\n    mental impairment or so forth on the lawyer’s part—\n    can rise to the level of egregious attorney misconduct\n    that would entitle Petitioner to equitable tolling.”\n    Ibid.\nHolland made “no allegation” that Collins had made a\n“knowing or reckless factual misrepresentation,” or that\nhe exhibited “dishonesty,” “divided loyalty,” or “mental\nimpairment.” Ibid. Hence, the court held, equitable toll\ning was per se inapplicable to Holland’s habeas petition.\n12                  HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe court did not address the District Court’s ruling with\nrespect to Holland’s diligence.\n  Holland petitioned for certiorari. Because the Court of\nAppeals’ application of the equitable tolling doctrine to\ninstances of professional misconduct conflicts with the\napproach taken by other Circuits, we granted the petition.\nCompare 539 F. 3d 1334 (case below), with, e.g., Bal\ndayaque v. United States, 338 F. 3d 145, 152–153 (CA2\n2003) (applying a less categorical approach); Spitsyn v.\nMoore, 345 F. 3d 796, 801–802 (CA9 2003) (same).\n                             II\n   We have not decided whether AEDPA’s statutory limita\ntions period may be tolled for equitable reasons. See\nLawrence, 549 U. S., at 336; Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544\nU. S. 408, 418, n. 8 (2005). Now, like all 11 Courts of\nAppeals that have considered the question, we hold that\n§2244(d) is subject to equitable tolling in appropriate\ncases. See Neverson v. Farquharson, 366 F. 3d 32, 41\n(CA1 2004); Smith v. McGinnis, 208 F. 3d 13, 17 (CA2\n2000) (per curiam); Miller v. New Jersey Dept. of Correc\ntions, 145 F. 3d 616, 617 (CA3 1998); Harris v. Hutchin\nson, 209 F. 3d 325, 329–330 (CA4 2000); Davis v. Johnson,\n158 F. 3d 806, 810 (CA5 1998); McClendon v. Sherman,\n329 F. 3d 490, 492 (CA6 2003); Taliani v. Chrans, 189\nF. 3d 597, 598 (CA7 1999); Moore v. United States, 173\nF. 3d 1131, 1134 (CA8 1999); Calderon v. United States\nDist. Ct. for Central Dist. of Cal., 128 F. 3d 1283, 1289\n(CA9 1997); Miller v. Marr, 141 F. 3d 976, 978 (CA10\n1998); Sandvik v. United States, 177 F. 3d 1269, 1272\n(CA11 1999) (per curiam).\n   We base our conclusion on the following considerations.\nFirst, the AEDPA “statute of limitations defense . . . is not\n‘jurisdictional.’ ” Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198, 205\n(2006). It does not set forth “an inflexible rule requiring\ndismissal whenever” its “clock has run.” Id., at 208. See\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nalso id., at 213 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“We have repeat\nedly stated that the enactment of time-limitation periods\nsuch as that in §2244(d), without further elaboration,\nproduces defenses that are nonjurisdictional and thus\nsubject to waiver and forfeiture” (citing cases)); Brief for\nRespondent 22 (describing AEDPA limitations period as\n“non-jurisdictional”).\n   We have previously made clear that a nonjurisdictional\nfederal statute of limitations is normally subject to a\n“rebuttable presumption” in favor “of equitable tolling.”\nIrwin, 498 U. S., at 95–96; see also Young v. United States,\n535 U. S. 43, 49 (2002) (“It is hornbook law that limita\ntions periods are ‘customarily subject to “equitable toll\ning” ’ ” (quoting Irwin, supra, at 95)).\n   In the case of AEDPA, the presumption’s strength is\nreinforced by the fact that “ ‘equitable principles’ ” have\ntraditionally “ ‘governed’ ” the substantive law of habeas\ncorpus, Munaf v. Geren, 553 U. S. 674, 693 (2008), for we\nwill “not construe a statute to displace courts’ traditional\nequitable authority absent the ‘clearest command,’ ” Miller\nv. French, 530 U. S. 327, 340 (2000) (quoting Califano v.\nYamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 705 (1979)). The presumption’s\nstrength is yet further reinforced by the fact that Congress\nenacted AEDPA after this Court decided Irwin and there\nfore was likely aware that courts, when interpreting\nAEDPA’s timing provisions, would apply the presumption.\nSee, e.g., Merck & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U. S. ___, ___\n(2010) (slip op., at 12).\n   Second, the statute here differs significantly from the\nstatutes at issue in United States v. Brockamp, 519 U. S.\n347 (1997), and United States v. Beggerly, 524 U. S. 38\n(1998), two cases in which we held that Irwin’s presump\ntion had been overcome. In Brockamp, we interpreted a\nstatute of limitations that was silent on the question of\nequitable tolling as foreclosing application of that doctrine.\nBut in doing so we emphasized that the statute at issue (1)\n14                  HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“se[t] forth its time limitations in unusually emphatic\nform”; (2) used “highly detailed” and “technical” language\n“that, linguistically speaking, cannot easily be read as\ncontaining implicit exceptions”; (3) “reiterate[d] its limita\ntions several times in several different ways”; (4) related\nto an “underlying subject matter,” nationwide tax collec\ntion, with respect to which the practical consequences of\npermitting tolling would have been substantial; and (5)\nwould, if tolled, “require tolling, not only procedural limi\ntations, but also substantive limitations on the amount of\nrecovery—a kind of tolling for which we . . . found no\ndirect precedent.” 519 U. S., at 350–352. And in Beggerly\nwe held that Irwin’s presumption was overcome where (1)\nthe 12-year statute of limitations at issue was “unusually\ngenerous” and (2) the underlying claim “deal[t] with own\nership of land” and thereby implicated landowners’ need to\n“know with certainty what their rights are, and the period\nduring which those rights may be subject to challenge.”\n524 U. S., at 48–49.\n   By way of contrast, AEDPA’s statute of limitations,\nunlike the statute at issue in Brockamp, does not contain\nlanguage that is “unusually emphatic,” nor does it “re\niterat[e]” its time limitation. Neither would application of\nequitable tolling here affect the “substance” of a peti\ntioner’s claim. Moreover, in contrast to the 12-year limita\ntions period at issue in Beggerly, AEDPA’s limitations\nperiod is not particularly long. And unlike the subject\nmatters at issue in both Brockamp and Beggerly—tax\ncollection and land claims—AEDPA’s subject matter,\nhabeas corpus, pertains to an area of the law where equity\nfinds a comfortable home. See Munaf, supra, at 693. In\nshort, AEDPA’s 1-year limit reads like an ordinary, run-of\nthe-mill statute of limitations. See Calderon, supra, at\n1288.\n   Respondent, citing Brockamp, argues that AEDPA\nshould be interpreted to foreclose equitable tolling because\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe statute sets forth “explicit exceptions to its basic time\nlimits” that do “not include ‘equitable tolling.’ ” 519 U. S.,\nat 351; see Brief for Respondent 27. The statute does\ncontain multiple provisions relating to the events that\ntrigger its running. See §2244(d)(1); Clay v. United States,\n537 U. S. 522, 529 (2003); see also Cada v. Baxter Health\ncare Corp., 920 F. 2d 446, 450 (CA7 1990) (“We must . . .\ndistinguish between the accrual of the plaintiff’s claim and\nthe tolling of the statute of limitations . . .”); Wims v.\nUnited States, 225 F. 3d 186, 190 (CA2 2000) (same);\nWolin v. Smith Barney Inc., 83 F. 3d 847, 852 (CA7 1996)\n(same). And we concede that it is silent as to equitable\ntolling while containing one provision that expressly refers\nto a different kind of tolling. See §2244(d)(2) (stating that\n“[t]he time during which” a petitioner has a pending re\nquest for state postconviction relief “shall not be counted\ntoward” his “period of limitation” under AEDPA). But the\nfact that Congress expressly referred to tolling during\nstate collateral review proceedings is easily explained\nwithout rebutting the presumption in favor of equitable\ntolling. A petitioner cannot bring a federal habeas claim\nwithout first exhausting state remedies—a process that\nfrequently takes longer than one year. See Rose v. Lundy,\n455 U. S. 509 (1982); §2254(b)(1)(A). Hence, Congress had\nto explain how the limitations statute accounts for the\ntime during which such state proceedings are pending.\nThis special need for an express provision undermines any\ntemptation to invoke the interpretive maxim inclusio\nunius est exclusio alterius (to include one item (i.e., sus\npension during state-court collateral review) is to exclude\nother similar items (i.e., equitable tolling)). See Young,\nsupra, at 53 (rejecting claim that an “express tolling provi\nsion, appearing in the same subsection as the [limitations]\nperiod, demonstrates a statutory intent not to toll the\n[limitations] period”).\n   Third, and finally, we disagree with respondent that\n16                  HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nequitable tolling undermines AEDPA’s basic purposes.\nWe recognize that AEDPA seeks to eliminate delays in the\nfederal habeas review process. See Day, 547 U. S., at 205–\n206; Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 337 (2003). But\nAEDPA seeks to do so without undermining basic habeas\ncorpus principles and while seeking to harmonize the new\nstatute with prior law, under which a petition’s timeliness\nwas always determined under equitable principles. See\nSlack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 483 (2000) (“AEDPA’s\npresent provisions . . . incorporate earlier habeas corpus\nprinciples”); see also Day, 547 U. S., at 202, n. 1; id., at\n214 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); 2 R. Hertz & J. Liebman,\nFederal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure §24.2, pp.\n1123–1136 (5th ed. 2005). When Congress codified new\nrules governing this previously judicially managed area of\nlaw, it did so without losing sight of the fact that the “writ\nof habeas corpus plays a vital role in protecting constitu\ntional rights.” Slack, 529 U. S., at 483. It did not seek to\nend every possible delay at all costs. Cf. id., at 483–488.\nThe importance of the Great Writ, the only writ explicitly\nprotected by the Constitution, Art. I, §9, cl. 2, along with\ncongressional efforts to harmonize the new statute with\nprior law, counsels hesitancy before interpreting AEDPA’s\nstatutory silence as indicating a congressional intent to\nclose courthouse doors that a strong equitable claim would\nordinarily keep open.\n   For these reasons we conclude that neither AEDPA’s\ntextual characteristics nor the statute’s basic purposes\n“rebut” the basic presumption set forth in Irwin. And we\ntherefore join the Courts of Appeals in holding that\n§2244(d) is subject to equitable tolling.\n                              III\n  We have previously made clear that a “petitioner” is\n“entitled to equitable tolling” only if he shows “(1) that he\nhas been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nextraordinary circumstance stood in his way” and pre\nvented timely filing. Pace, 544 U. S., at 418 (emphasis\ndeleted). In this case, the “extraordinary circumstances”\nat issue involve an attorney’s failure to satisfy professional\nstandards of care. The Court of Appeals held that, where\nthat is so, even attorney conduct that is “grossly negligent”\ncan never warrant tolling absent “bad faith, dishonesty,\ndivided loyalty, mental impairment or so forth on the\nlawyer’s part.” 539 F. 3d, at 1339. But in our view, the\nCourt of Appeals’ standard is too rigid.\n   We have said that courts of equity “must be governed by\nrules and precedents no less than the courts of law.”\nLonchar v. Thomas, 517 U. S. 314, 323 (1996) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). But we have also made clear\nthat often the “exercise of a court’s equity powers . . . must\nbe made on a case-by-case basis.” Baggett v. Bullitt, 377\nU. S. 360, 375 (1964). In emphasizing the need for “flexi\nbility,” for avoiding “mechanical rules,” Holmberg v. Arm\nbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 396 (1946), we have followed a tradi\ntion in which courts of equity have sought to “relieve\nhardships which, from time to time, arise from a hard and\nfast adherence” to more absolute legal rules, which, if\nstrictly applied, threaten the “evils of archaic rigidity,”\nHazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U. S.\n238, 248 (1944). The “flexibility” inherent in “equitable\nprocedure” enables courts “to meet new situations [that]\ndemand equitable intervention, and to accord all the relief\nnecessary to correct . . . particular injustices.” Ibid. (per\nmitting postdeadline filing of bill of review). Taken to\ngether, these cases recognize that courts of equity can and\ndo draw upon decisions made in other similar cases for\nguidance. Such courts exercise judgment in light of prior\nprecedent, but with awareness of the fact that specific\ncircumstances, often hard to predict in advance, could\nwarrant special treatment in an appropriate case.\n   We recognize that, in the context of procedural default,\n18                  HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwe have previously stated, without qualification, that a\npetitioner “must ‘bear the risk of attorney error.’ ” Cole\nman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 752–753 (1991). But\nColeman was “a case about federalism,” id., at 726, in that\nit asked whether federal courts may excuse a petitioner’s\nfailure to comply with a state court’s procedural rules,\nnotwithstanding the state court’s determination that its\nown rules had been violated. Equitable tolling, by con\ntrast, asks whether federal courts may excuse a peti\ntioner’s failure to comply with federal timing rules, an\ninquiry that does not implicate a state court’s interpreta\ntion of state law.        Cf. Lawrence, 549 U. S., at 341\n(GINSBURG, J., dissenting). Holland does not argue that\nhis attorney’s misconduct provides a substantive ground\nfor relief, cf. §2254(i), nor is this a case that asks whether\nAEDPA’s statute of limitations should be recognized at all,\ncf. Day, supra, at 209. Rather, this case asks how equity\nshould be applied once the statute is recognized. And\ngiven equity’s resistance to rigid rules, we cannot read\nColeman as requiring a per se approach in this context.\n   In short, no pre-existing rule of law or precedent de\nmands a rule like the one set forth by the Eleventh Circuit\nin this case. That rule is difficult to reconcile with more\ngeneral equitable principles in that it fails to recognize\nthat, at least sometimes, professional misconduct that\nfails to meet the Eleventh Circuit’s standard could none\ntheless amount to egregious behavior and create an ex\ntraordinary circumstance that warrants equitable tolling.\nAnd, given the long history of judicial application of equi\ntable tolling, courts can easily find precedents that can\nguide their judgments. Several lower courts have specifi\ncally held that unprofessional attorney conduct may, in\ncertain circumstances, prove “egregious” and can be “ex\ntraordinary” even though the conduct in question may not\nsatisfy the Eleventh Circuit’s rule. See, e.g., Nara v.\nFrank, 264 F. 3d 310, 320 (CA3 2001) (ordering hearing as\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto whether client who was “effectively abandoned” by\nlawyer merited tolling); Calderon, 128 F. 3d, at 1289\n(allowing tolling where client was prejudiced by a last\nminute change in representation that was beyond his\ncontrol); Baldayaque, 338 F. 3d, at 152–153 (finding that\nwhere an attorney failed to perform an essential service,\nto communicate with the client, and to do basic legal\nresearch, tolling could, under the circumstances, be war\nranted); Spitsyn, 345 F. 3d, at 800–802 (finding that “ex\ntraordinary circumstances” may warrant tolling where\nlawyer denied client access to files, failed to prepare a\npetition, and did not respond to his client’s communica\ntions); United States v. Martin, 408 F. 3d 1089, 1096 (CA8\n2005) (client entitled to equitable tolling where his attor\nney retained files, made misleading statements, and en\ngaged in similar conduct).\n   We have previously held that “a garden variety claim of\nexcusable neglect,” Irwin, 498 U. S., at 96, such as a sim\nple “miscalculation” that leads a lawyer to miss a filing\ndeadline, Lawrence, supra, at 336, does not warrant equi\ntable tolling. But the case before us does not involve, and\nwe are not considering, a “garden variety claim” of attor\nney negligence. Rather, the facts of this case present far\nmore serious instances of attorney misconduct. And, as\nwe have said, although the circumstances of a case must\nbe “extraordinary” before equitable tolling can be applied,\nwe hold that such circumstances are not limited to those\nthat satisfy the test that the Court of Appeals used in this\ncase.\n                            IV\n  The record facts that we have set forth in Part I of this\nopinion suggest that this case may well be an “extraordi\nnary” instance in which petitioner’s attorney’s conduct\nconstituted far more than “garden variety” or “excusable\nneglect.” To be sure, Collins failed to file Holland’s peti\n20                  HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion on time and appears to have been unaware of the date\non which the limitations period expired—two facts that,\nalone, might suggest simple negligence. But, in these\ncircumstances, the record facts we have elucidated suggest\nthat the failure amounted to more: Here, Collins failed to\nfile Holland’s federal petition on time despite Holland’s\nmany letters that repeatedly emphasized the importance\nof his doing so. Collins apparently did not do the research\nnecessary to find out the proper filing date, despite Hol\nland’s letters that went so far as to identify the applicable\nlegal rules. Collins failed to inform Holland in a timely\nmanner about the crucial fact that the Florida Supreme\nCourt had decided his case, again despite Holland’s many\npleas for that information. And Collins failed to communi\ncate with his client over a period of years, despite various\npleas from Holland that Collins respond to his letters.\n   A group of teachers of legal ethics tells us that these\nvarious failures violated fundamental canons of profes\nsional responsibility, which require attorneys to perform\nreasonably competent legal work, to communicate with\ntheir clients, to implement clients’ reasonable requests, to\nkeep their clients informed of key developments in their\ncases, and never to abandon a client. See Brief for Legal\nEthics Professors et al. as Amici Curiae (describing ethical\nrules set forth in case law, the Restatements of Agency,\nthe Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers\n(1998), and in the ABA Model Rules of Professional Con\nduct (2009)). And in this case, the failures seriously preju\ndiced a client who thereby lost what was likely his single\nopportunity for federal habeas review of the lawfulness of\nhis imprisonment and of his death sentence.\n   We do not state our conclusion in absolute form, how\never, because more proceedings may be necessary. The\nDistrict Court rested its ruling not on a lack of extraordi\nnary circumstances, but rather on a lack of diligence—a\nruling that respondent does not defend. See Brief for\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nRespondent 38, n. 19; Tr. of Oral Arg. 43, 52. We think\nthat the District Court’s conclusion was incorrect. The\ndiligence required for equitable tolling purposes is “ ‘rea\nsonable diligence,’ ” see, e.g., Lonchar, 517 U. S., at 326,\nnot “ ‘ “maximum feasible diligence,” ’ ” Starns v. Andrews,\n524 F. 3d 612, 618 (CA5 2008) (quoting Moore v. Knight,\n368 F. 3d 936, 940 (CA7 2004)). Here, Holland not only\nwrote his attorney numerous letters seeking crucial in\nformation and providing direction; he also repeatedly\ncontacted the state courts, their clerks, and the Florida\nState Bar Association in an effort to have Collins—the\ncentral impediment to the pursuit of his legal remedy—\nremoved from his case. And, the very day that Holland\ndiscovered that his AEDPA clock had expired due to\nCollins’ failings, Holland prepared his own habeas petition\npro se and promptly filed it with the District Court.\n   Because the District Court erroneously relied on a lack\nof diligence, and because the Court of Appeals erroneously\nrelied on an overly rigid per se approach, no lower court\nhas yet considered in detail the facts of this case to deter\nmine whether they indeed constitute extraordinary cir\ncumstances sufficient to warrant equitable relief. We are\n“[m]indful that this is a court of final review and not first\nview.” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U. S.\n103, 110 (2001) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). And we also recognize the prudence, when faced\nwith an “equitable, often fact-intensive” inquiry, of allow\ning the lower courts “to undertake it in the first instance.”\nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U. S. 524, 540 (2005) (STEVENS,\nJ., dissenting). Thus, because we conclude that the Dis\ntrict Court’s determination must be set aside, we leave it\nto the Court of Appeals to determine whether the facts in\nthis record entitle Holland to equitable tolling, or whether\nfurther proceedings, including an evidentiary hearing,\nmight indicate that respondent should prevail.\n   The judgment below is reversed, and the case is re\n22                HOLLAND v.

FLORIDA\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [June 14, 2010] \n\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO, concurring in part and concurring in the\njudgment.\n  This case raises two broad questions: first, whether the\nstatute of limitations set out in the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C.\n§2244(d), is subject to equitable tolling; and second, as\nsuming an affirmative answer to the first question,\nwhether petitioner in this particular case has alleged facts\nthat are sufficient to satisfy the “extraordinary circum\nstances” prong of the equitable tolling test. I agree with\nthe Court’s conclusion that equitable tolling is available\nunder AEDPA. I also agree with much of the Court’s\ndiscussion concerning whether equitable tolling is avail\nable on the facts of this particular case. In particular, I\nagree that the Court of Appeals erred by essentially limit\ning the relevant inquiry to the question whether “gross\nnegligence” of counsel may be an extraordinary circum\nstance warranting equitable tolling. As the Court makes\nclear, petitioner in this case has alleged certain facts that\ngo well beyond any form of attorney negligence, see ante,\nat 3–4, 19, and the Court of Appeals does not appear to\nhave asked whether those particular facts provide an\nindependent basis for tolling. Accordingly, I concur in the\nCourt’s decision to reverse the judgment below and re\nmand so that the lower courts may properly apply the\ncorrect legal standard.\n2                   HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n  Although I agree that the Court of Appeals applied the\nwrong standard, I think that the majority does not do\nenough to explain the right standard. It is of course true\nthat equitable tolling requires “extraordinary circum\nstances,” but that conclusory formulation does not provide\nmuch guidance to lower courts charged with reviewing the\nmany habeas petitions filed every year. I therefore write\nseparately to set forth my understanding of the principles\ngoverning the availability of equitable tolling in cases\ninvolving attorney misconduct.\n                               I\n   “Generally, a litigant seeking equitable tolling bears the\nburden of establishing two elements: (1) that he has been\npursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraor\ndinary circumstance stood in his way.” Pace v. DiGug\nlielmo, 544 U. S. 408, 418 (2005). The dispute in this case\nconcerns whether and when attorney misconduct amounts\nto an “extraordinary circumstance” that stands in a peti\ntioner’s way and prevents the petitioner from filing a\ntimely petition. I agree with the majority that it is not\npractical to attempt to provide an exhaustive compilation\nof the kinds of situations in which attorney misconduct\nmay provide a basis for equitable tolling. In my view,\nhowever, it is useful to note that several broad principles\nmay be distilled from this Court’s precedents.\n   First, our prior cases make it abundantly clear that\nattorney negligence is not an extraordinary circumstance\nwarranting equitable tolling. In Lawrence v. Florida, 549\nU. S. 327, 336 (2007), the Court expressly rejected the\npetitioner’s contention that “his counsel’s mistake in mis\ncalculating the limitations period entitle[d] him to equita\nble tolling.” “Attorney miscalculation,” the Court held, “is\nsimply not sufficient to warrant equitable tolling, particu\nlarly in the postconviction context where prisoners have no\nconstitutional right to counsel.” Id., at 336–337 (citing\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nColeman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 756–757 (1991)\n(emphasis added)).\n   The basic rationale for Lawrence’s holding is that the\nmistakes of counsel are constructively attributable to the\nclient, at least in the postconviction context. The Law\nrence Court’s reliance on Coleman is instructive. In Cole\nman, the Court addressed whether attorney error provided\ncause for a procedural default based on a late filing. See\n501 U. S., at 752. Because “[t]here is no constitutional\nright to an attorney in state post-conviction proceedings,”\nthe Court explained, “a petitioner cannot claim constitu\ntionally ineffective assistance of counsel in such proceed\nings.” Ibid. In such circumstances, the Court reasoned,\nthere was “ ‘no inequity in requiring [the petitioner] to\nbear the risk of attorney error that results in a procedural\ndefault.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478,\n488 (1986)); accord, Coleman, 501 U. S., at 753 (“ ‘[C]ause’\nunder the cause and prejudice test must be something\nexternal to the petitioner, something that cannot fairly be\nattributed to him”); ibid. (“Attorney ignorance or inadver\ntence is not ‘cause’ because the attorney is the petitioner’s\nagent when acting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the\nlitigation, and the petitioner must ‘bear the risk of attor\nney error’ ”); id., at 754 (what matters is whether “the\nerror [of counsel] must be seen as an external factor, i.e.,\n‘imputed to the State’ ”); ibid. (“In the absence of a consti\ntutional violation, the petitioner bears the risk in federal\nhabeas for all attorney errors made in the course of the\nrepresentation”); id., at 757 (“Because Coleman had no\nright to counsel to pursue his appeal in state habeas, any\nattorney error that led to the default of Coleman’s claims\nin state court cannot constitute cause to excuse the default\nin federal habeas”). As Lawrence makes clear, the same\nanalysis applies when a petitioner seeks equitable tolling\nbased on attorney error in the postconviction context. See\n549 U. S., at 336–337 (citing Coleman).\n4                   HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n   While Lawrence addressed an allegation of attorney\nmiscalculation, its rationale fully applies to other forms of\nattorney negligence. Instead of miscalculating the filing\ndeadline, for example, an attorney could compute the\ndeadline correctly but forget to file the habeas petition on\ntime, mail the petition to the wrong address, or fail to do\nthe requisite research to determine the applicable dead\nline. In any case, however, counsel’s error would be con\nstructively attributable to the client.\n   Second, the mere fact that a missed deadline involves\n“gross negligence” on the part of counsel does not by itself\nestablish an extraordinary circumstance. As explained\nabove, the principal rationale for disallowing equitable\ntolling based on ordinary attorney miscalculation is that\nthe error of an attorney is constructively attributable to\nthe client and thus is not a circumstance beyond the liti\ngant’s control. See Lawrence, supra, at 336–337; Coleman,\nsupra, at 752–754; see also Powell v. Davis, 415 F. 3d 722,\n727 (CA7 2005); Johnson v. McBride, 381 F. 3d 587, 589–\n590 (CA7 2004); Harris v. Hutchinson, 209 F. 3d 325, 330\n(CA4 2000). That rationale plainly applies regardless\nwhether the attorney error in question involves ordinary\nor gross negligence. See Coleman, 501 U. S., at 754 (“[I]t\nis not the gravity of the attorney’s error that matters, but\nthat it constitutes a violation of petitioner’s right to coun\nsel, so that the error must be seen as an external factor,\ni.e., ‘imputed to the State’ ”); id., at 752 (rejecting the\ncontention that “[t]he late filing was . . . the result of\nattorney error of sufficient magnitude to excuse the de\nfault in federal habeas”).\n   Allowing equitable tolling in cases involving gross\nrather than ordinary attorney negligence would not only\nfail to make sense in light of our prior cases; it would also\nbe impractical in the extreme. Missing the statute of\nlimitations will generally, if not always, amount to negli\ngence, see Lawrence, 549 U. S., at 336, and it has been\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                       Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\naptly said that gross negligence is ordinary negligence\nwith a vituperative epithet added. Therefore, if gross\nnegligence may be enough for equitable tolling, there will\nbe a basis for arguing that tolling is appropriate in almost\nevery counseled case involving a missed deadline. See\nibid. (argument that attorney miscalculation is an ex\ntraordinary circumstance, if credited, “would essentially\nequitably toll limitations periods for every person whose\nattorney missed a deadline”). This would not just impose\na severe burden on the district courts; it would also make\nthe availability of tolling turn on the highly artificial\ndistinction between gross and ordinary negligence. That\nline would be hard to administer, would needlessly con\nsume scarce judicial resources, and would almost certainly\nyield inconsistent and often unsatisfying results. See\nBaldayaque v. United States, 338 F. 3d 145, 155 (CA2\n2003) (Jacobs, J., concurring) (noting that the “distinction\nbetween ordinary and extraordinary attorney malpractice\n. . . is elusive, hard to apply, and counterintuitive”).\n    Finally, it is worth noting that a rule that distinguishes\nbetween ordinary and gross attorney negligence for pur\nposes of the equitable tolling analysis would have demon\nstrably “inequitable” consequences. For example, it is\nhard to see why a habeas petitioner should be effectively\npenalized just because his counsel was negligent rather\nthan grossly negligent, or why the State should be penal\nized just because petitioner’s counsel was grossly negligent\nrather than moderately negligent. Regardless of how one\ncharacterizes counsel’s deficient performance in such\ncases, the petitioner is not personally at fault for the\nuntimely filing, attorney error is a but-for cause of the late\nfiling, and the governmental interest in enforcing the\nstatutory limitations period is the same.\n                           II\n  Although attorney negligence, however styled, does not\n6                   HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nprovide a basis for equitable tolling, the AEDPA statute of\nlimitations may be tolled if the missed deadline results\nfrom attorney misconduct that is not constructively at\ntributable to the petitioner. In this case, petitioner alleges\nfacts that amount to such misconduct. See ante, at 19\n(acknowledging that ordinary attorney negligence does not\nwarrant equitable tolling, but observing that “the facts of\nthis case present far more serious instances of attorney\nmisconduct”). In particular, he alleges that his attorney\nessentially “abandoned” him, as evidenced by counsel’s\nnear-total failure to communicate with petitioner or to\nrespond to petitioner’s many inquiries and requests over a\nperiod of several years. See ante, at 3–4. Petitioner also\nappears to allege that he made reasonable efforts to ter\nminate counsel due to his inadequate representation and\nto proceed pro se, and that such efforts were successfully\nopposed by the State on the perverse ground that peti\ntioner failed to act through appointed counsel. See ante,\nat 4; Brief for Petitioner 50–51 (stating that petitioner\nfiled “two pro se motions in the Florida Supreme Court to\nremove Collins as counsel (one which, if granted, would\nhave allowed [petitioner] to proceed pro se)” (emphasis\ndeleted)).\n   If true, petitioner’s allegations would suffice to establish\nextraordinary circumstances beyond his control. Common\nsense dictates that a litigant cannot be held constructively\nresponsible for the conduct of an attorney who is not oper\nating as his agent in any meaningful sense of that word.\nSee Coleman, supra, at 754 (relying on “well-settled prin\nciples of agency law” to determine whether attorney error\nwas attributable to client); Baldayaque, supra, at 154\n(Jacobs, J., concurring) (“[W]hen an ‘agent acts in a man\nner completely adverse to the principal’s interest,’ the\n‘principal is not charged with [the] agent’s misdeeds’ ”).\nThat is particularly so if the litigant’s reasonable efforts to\nterminate the attorney’s representation have been\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

S. C. §2244(d). The\nCourt concludes that this time limit is also subject to\nequitable tolling, even for attorney errors that are ordinar\nily attributable to the client. And it rejects the Court of\nAppeals’ conclusion that Albert Holland is not entitled to\ntolling, without explaining why the test that court applied\nwas wrong or what rule it should have applied instead. In\nmy view §2244(d) leaves no room for equitable exceptions,\nand Holland could not qualify even if it did.\n                              I\n  The Court is correct, ante, at 13, that we ordinarily\npresume federal limitations periods are subject to equita\nble tolling unless tolling would be inconsistent with the\nstatute. Young v. United States, 535 U. S. 43, 49 (2002).\nThat is especially true of limitations provisions applicable\nto actions that are traditionally governed by equitable\nprinciples—a category that includes habeas proceedings.\nSee id., at 50. If §2244(d) merely created a limitations\nperiod for federal habeas applicants, I agree that applying\nequitable tolling would be appropriate.\n2                       HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   But §2244(d) does much more than that, establishing a\ndetailed scheme regarding the filing deadline that ad\ndresses an array of contingencies. In an ordinary case, the\nclock starts when the state-court judgment becomes final\non direct review. §2244(d)(1)(A).1 But the statute delays\nthe start date—thus effectively tolling the limitations\nperiod—in cases where (1) state action unlawfully im\npeded the prisoner from filing his habeas application, (2)\nthe prisoner asserts a constitutional right newly recog\nnized by this Court and made retroactive to collateral\ncases, or (3) the factual predicate for the prisoner’s claim\ncould not previously have been discovered through due\ndiligence. §2244(d)(1)(B)–(D). It also expressly tolls the\nlimitations period during the pendency of a properly filed\napplication for state collateral relief. §2244(d)(2). Con\ngress, in short, has considered and accounted for specific\ncircumstances that in its view excuse an applicant’s delay.\n   The question, therefore, is not whether §2244(d)’s time\n——————\n    1 Title\n          28 U.

It is fair enough to infer, when a\nstatute of limitations says nothing about equitable tolling,\nthat Congress did not displace the default rule. But when\nCongress has codified that default rule and specified the\ninstances where it applies, we have no warrant to extend\nit to other cases. See United States v. Beggerly, 524 U. S.\n38, 48–49 (1998). Unless the Court believes §2244(d)\ncontains an implicit, across-the-board exception that\nsubsumes (and thus renders unnecessary) §2244(d)(1)(B)–\n(D) and (d)(2), it must rely on the untenable assumption\nthat when Congress enumerated the events that toll the\nlimitations period—with no indication the list is merely\nillustrative—it implicitly authorized courts to add others\nas they see fit. We should assume the opposite: that by\nspecifying situations in which an equitable principle ap\nplies to a specific requirement, Congress has displaced\ncourts’ discretion to develop ad hoc exceptions. Cf. Lon\nchar v. Thomas, 517 U. S. 314, 326–328 (1996).\n   The Court’s responses are unpersuasive. It brushes\naside §2244(d)(1)(B)–(D), apparently because those subdi\nvisions merely delay the start of the limitations period but\ndo not suspend a limitations period already underway.\nAnte, at 15. But the Court does not explain why that\ndistinction makes any difference,2 and we have described a\n——————\n  2 The Court cites several Court of Appeals cases that support its trig\n\ngering-tolling distinction, ante, at 15, but no case of ours that does so.\nClay v.

Lundy,\n455 U. S. 509 (1982), that a federal habeas application\ncannot be filed while state proceedings are pending. But\nthere is no contradiction to resolve unless, in the absence\nof a statutory tolling provision, equitable tolling would not\napply to a state prisoner barred from filing a federal ha\nbeas application while he exhausts his state remedies.\nThe Court offers no reason why it would not, and our\nholding in Young, 535 U.

C. §507(a)(8)(A)(ii) (2000 ed.)—albeit a provision\nwithin the same subparagraph as the provision at issue,\n§507(a)(8)(A)(i)—did not rebut the presumption of equitable tolling.\nSee 535 U. S., at 53. Moreover, Young stressed that §507(a)(8)(A)(ii)\nauthorized tolling in instances where equity would not have allowed it,\nwhich reinforced the presumption in favor of tolling. Ibid. Here, the\nCourt does not suggest that any of §2244(d)’s exceptions go beyond\nwhat equity would have allowed.\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

Florida, 549 U. S. 327, 336 (2007) (quoting Pace v.\nDiGuglielmo, 544 U. S. 408, 418 (2005)). Because the\nattorney is the litigant’s agent, the attorney’s acts (or\nfailures to act) within the scope of the representation are\ntreated as those of his client, see Link v. Wabash R. Co.,\n370 U. S. 626, 633–634, and n. 10 (1962), and thus such\nacts (or failures to act) are necessarily not extraordinary\ncircumstances.\n   To be sure, the rule that an attorney’s acts and over\nsights are attributable to the client is relaxed where the\nclient has a constitutional right to effective assistance of\ncounsel. Where a State is constitutionally obliged to\nprovide an attorney but fails to provide an effective one,\nthe attorney’s failures that fall below the standard set\nforth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984),\nare chargeable to the State, not to the prisoner. See\nMurray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 488 (1986). But where\nthe client has no right to counsel—which in habeas pro\nceedings he does not—the rule holding him responsible for\nhis attorney’s acts applies with full force. See Coleman v.\nThompson, 501 U. S. 722, 752–754 (1991).4 Thus, when a\nstate habeas petitioner’s appeal is filed too late because of\nattorney error, the petitioner is out of luck—no less than if\nhe had proceeded pro se and neglected to file the appeal\nhimself.5\n——————\n  4 The  Court dismisses Coleman as “a case about federalism” and\ntherefore inapposite here. Ante, at 18 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). I fail to see how federalism concerns are not implicated by\nad hoc exceptions to the statute of limitations for attempts to overturn\nstate-court convictions. In any event, Coleman did not invent, but\nmerely applied, the already established principle that an attorney’s acts\nare his client’s. See 501 U.

Nor was that an oversight:\nSection 2244(d)(1)(B) expressly allows tolling for state\ncreated impediments that prevent a prisoner from filing\nhis application, but only if the impediment violates the\nConstitution or federal law.\n   If there were any doubt that equitable tolling is un\navailable under §2244(d) to excuse attorney error, we\neliminated it in Lawrence. The petitioner there asserted\nthat his attorney’s miscalculation of the limitations period\nfor federal habeas applications caused him to miss the\nfiling deadline. The attorney’s error stemmed from his\nmistaken belief that—contrary to Circuit precedent (which\nwe approved in Lawrence)—the limitations period is tolled\nduring the pendency of a petition for certiorari from a\nstate postconviction proceeding. 549 U. S., at 336; see also\nBrief for Petitioner in Lawrence v. Florida, O. T. 2006, No.\n05–8820, pp. 31, 36. Assuming arguendo that equitable\ntolling could ever apply to §2244(d), we held that such\nattorney error did not warrant it, especially since the\npetitioner was not constitutionally entitled to counsel.\nLawrence, supra, at 336–337.\n   Faithful application of Lawrence should make short\nwork of Holland’s claim. Although Holland alleges a wide\narray of misconduct by his counsel, Bradley Collins, the\nonly pertinent part appears extremely similar, if not iden\n——————\nColeman, retained, see Brief for Respondent in Coleman v. Thompson,\nO. T. 1990, No. 89–7662, pp. 33–34, 40, is irrelevant. The Sixth\nAmendment right to effective assistance of counsel, we have held,\napplies even to an attorney the defendant himself hires. See Cuyler v.\nSullivan, 446 U. S. 335, 342–345 (1980). The basis for Coleman was\nnot that Coleman had hired his own counsel, but that the State owed\nhim no obligation to provide one. See 501 U. S., at 754. It would be\nutterly perverse, of course, to penalize the State for providing habeas\npetitioners with representation, when the State could avoid equitable\ntolling by providing none at all.\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

The relevant\ntime period extends at most from November 10, 2005—\nwhen the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the denial of\nHolland’s state habeas petition6—to December 15, 2005,\nthe latest date on which §2244(d)’s limitations period\ncould have expired.7 Within that period, Collins could\nhave alerted Holland to the Florida Supreme Court’s\ndecision, and either Collins or Holland himself could have\nfiled a timely federal habeas application. Collins did not\ndo so, but instead filed a petition for certiorari several\nmonths later.\n   Why Collins did not notify Holland or file a timely fed\neral application for him is unclear, but none of the plausi\nble explanations would support equitable tolling. By far\nthe most likely explanation is that Collins made exactly\nthe same mistake as the attorney in Lawrence—i.e., he\nassumed incorrectly that the pendency of a petition for\ncertiorari in this Court seeking review of the denial of\nHolland’s state habeas petition would toll AEDPA’s time\nbar under §2244(d)(2). In December 2002, Collins had\nexplained to Holland by letter that if his state habeas\npetition was denied and this Court denied certiorari in\nthat proceeding, Holland’s claims “will then be ripe for\npresentation in a petition for writ of habeas corpus in\nfederal court.” App. 61 (emphasis added). Holland him\nself interprets that statement as proof that, at that time,\n“Collins was under the belief that [Holland’s] time to file\n\n——————\n  6 The Florida Supreme Court did not issue its mandate, and the limi\n\ntations period did not resume, see Lawrence, 549 U. S., at 331, until\nDecember 1, 2005. But once the Florida Supreme Court issued its\ndecision (with the mandate still to come), Collins could have notified\nHolland, who in turn could have filed a pro se federal application.\n  7 The parties dispute when Holland’s state habeas petition was filed,\n\nand thus when the limitations period expired. Brief for Petitioner 4–5,\nand n. 4; Brief for Respondent 8, 9, n. 7. The discrepancy is immaterial,\nbut I give Holland the benefit of the doubt.\n8                   HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nhis federal habeas petition would continue to be tolled\nuntil this Court denied certiorari” in his state postconvic\ntion proceeding. Pet. for Cert. 12, n. 10. That misunder\nstanding would entirely account for Collins’s conduct—\nfiling a certiorari petition instead of a habeas application,\nand waiting nearly three months to do so. But it would\nalso be insufficient, as Lawrence held it was, to warrant\ntolling.\n   The other conceivable explanations for Collins’s failure\nfare no better. It may be that Collins believed—as he\nexplained to Holland in a January 2006 letter, after Hol\nland had informed him that a certiorari petition in a state\npostconviction proceeding would not stop the clock—that\nthe certiorari petition in Holland’s direct appeal also did\nnot toll the time bar. Consequently, Collins wrote, Hol\nland’s time to file a federal application had expired even\nbefore Collins was appointed. App. 78–79. As the Court\nexplains, ante, at 8, this view too was wrong, but it is no\nmore a basis for equitable tolling than the attorney’s\nmisunderstanding in Lawrence.\n   Or it may be that Collins (despite what he wrote to\nHolland) correctly understood the rule but simply ne\nglected to notify Holland; perhaps he missed the state\ncourt’s ruling in his mail, or perhaps it simply slipped his\nmind. Such an oversight is unfortunate, but it amounts to\n“garden variety” negligence, not a basis for equitable\ntolling. Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S.\n89, 96 (1990). Surely it is no more extraordinary than the\nattorney’s error in Lawrence, which rudimentary research\nand arithmetic would have avoided.\n   The Court insists that Collins’s misconduct goes beyond\ngarden-variety neglect and mine-run miscalculation.\nAnte, at 19. But the only differences it identifies had no\neffect on Holland’s ability to file his federal application on\ntime. The Court highlights Collins’s nonresponsiveness\nwhile Holland’s state postconviction motions were still\n                      Cite as: 560 U.

But even taken at face value,\nCollins’s silence prior to November 10, 2005, did not pre\nvent Holland from filing a timely federal application once\nthe Florida courts were finished with his case. The Court\nalso appears to think significant Collins’s correspondence\nwith Holland in January 2006, after the limitations period\nhad elapsed. Ante, at 5–10, 20. But unless Holland can\nestablish that the time-bar should be tolled due to events\nbefore December 15, 2005, any misconduct by Collins after\nthe limitations period elapsed is irrelevant. Even if\nCollins’s conduct before November 10 and after December\n15 was “extraordinary,” Holland has not shown that it\n“stood in his way and prevented timely filing.” Lawrence,\n549 U. S., at 336 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  For his part, Holland now asserts that Collins did not\nmerely forget to keep his client informed, but deliberately\ndeceived him. As the Court of Appeals concluded, how\never, Holland did not allege deception in seeking equitable\ntolling below. See 539 F. 3d 1334, 1339 (CA11 2008) (per\ncuriam).8 In any event, the deception of which he com\nplains consists only of Collins’s assurance early in the\nrepresentation that he would protect Holland’s ability to\nassert his claims in federal court, see App. 55, 62, coupled\nwith Collins’s later failure to do so. That, of course, does\nnot by itself amount to deception, and Holland offers no\nevidence that Collins meant to mislead him. Moreover,\nHolland can hardly claim to have been caught off guard.\nCollins’s failures to respond to Holland’s repeated requests\nfor information before the State Supreme Court ruled gave\nHolland even greater reason to suspect that Collins had\nfallen asleep at the switch. Holland indeed was under no\n——————\n   8 Holland insists that he did allege deception below, see Brief for Peti\n\ntioner 31, n. 29, but cites only a conclusory allegation in an unrelated\nmotion (a motion for appointment of new counsel). See App. 194. His\nreply to the State’s response to the order to show cause, drafted by new\ncounsel, did not allege deception. 1 Record, Doc. 35.\n10                      HOLLAND v.

It concludes only that the\nEleventh Circuit applied the wrong rule and remands the\ncase for a re-do. That would be appropriate if the Court\nidentified a legal error in the Eleventh Circuit’s analysis\nand set forth the proper standard it should have applied.\n  The Court does neither. It rejects as “too rigid,” ante, at\n17, the Eleventh Circuit’s test—which requires, beyond\nordinary attorney negligence, “an allegation and proof of\nbad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, mental impairment\nor so forth on the lawyer’s part,” 539 F. 3d, at 1339. But\nthe Court never explains why that “or so forth” test, which\nexplicitly leaves room for other kinds of egregious attorney\n——————\n  9 The  concurrence argues that Holland’s allegations suffice because\nthey show, if true, that Collins “essentially ‘abandoned’ ” Holland by\nfailing to respond to Holland’s inquiries, and therefore ceased to act as\nHolland’s agent. Ante, at 6 (ALITO, J., concurring in part and concur\nring in judgment). But Collins’s failure to communicate has no bearing\nunless it ended the agency relationship before the relevant window.\nThe concurrence does not explain why it would—does not contend, for\nexample, that Collins’s conduct amounted to disloyalty or renunciation\nof his role, which would terminate Collins’s authority, see Restatement\n(Second) of Agency §§112, 118 (1957). Collins’s alleged nonresponsive\nness did not help Holland’s cause, but it was no more “adverse to\n[Holland’s] interest” or “beyond [Holland’s] control,” ante, at 6, 7 (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted), and thus no more a basis for holding\nHolland harmless from the consequences of his counsel’s conduct, than\nmine-run attorney mistakes, cf. Irwin v. Department of Veterans Af\nfairs, 498 U. S. 89, 96 (1990). The concurrence also relies upon Hol\nland’s requests to replace Collins with new appointed counsel. But if\nthose requests could prevent imputing Collins’s acts to Holland, every\nhabeas applicant who unsuccessfully asks for a new state-provided\nlawyer (but who does not seek to proceed pro se when that request is\ndenied) would not be bound by his attorney’s subsequent acts.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nerror, is insufficiently elastic.\n   Moreover, even if the Eleventh Circuit had adopted an\nentirely inflexible rule, it is simply untrue that, as the\nCourt appears to believe, ante, at 17, all general rules are\nipso facto incompatible with equity. We have rejected that\ncanard before, see, e.g., Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo,\nS. A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U. S. 308, 321–322\n(1999), and we have relied on the existence of general\nrules regarding equitable tolling in particular, see, e.g.,\nYoung, 535 U. S., at 53. As we observed in rejecting\nad hoc equitable restrictions on habeas relief, “the alterna\ntive is to use each equity chancellor’s conscience as a\nmeasure of equity, which alternative would be as arbitrary\nand uncertain as measuring distance by the length of each\nchancellor’s foot.” Lonchar, 517 U. S., at 323.\n   Consistent with its failure to explain the error in the\nEleventh Circuit’s test, the Court offers almost no clue\nabout what test that court should have applied. The Court\nunhelpfully advises the Court of Appeals that its test is\ntoo narrow, with no explanation besides the assertion that\nits test left out cases where tolling might be warranted,\nand no precise indication of what those cases might be.\nAnte, at 18 (“[A]t least sometimes, professional misconduct\nthat fails to meet the Eleventh Circuit’s standard could\nnonetheless amount to egregious behavior and create an\nextraordinary circumstance that warrants equitable toll\ning”). The Court says that “courts can easily find prece\ndents that can guide their judgments,” ibid., citing several\nCourt of Appeals opinions that (in various contexts) permit\ntolling for attorney error—but notably omitting opinions\nthat disallow it, such as the Seventh Circuit’s opinion in\nPowell v. Davis, 415 F. 3d 722, 727 (2005), which would\nhave “guide[d] . . . judgmen[t]” precisely where this court\narrived: “[A]ttorney misconduct, whether labeled negli\ngent, grossly negligent, or willful, is attributable to the\nclient and thus is not a circumstance beyond a petitioner’s\n12                  HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncontrol that might excuse an untimely petition.” Ibid.\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The only thing the Court offers that approaches sub\nstantive instruction is its implicit approval of “fundamen\ntal canons of professional responsibility,” articulated by an\nad hoc group of legal-ethicist amici consisting mainly of\nprofessors of that least analytically rigorous and hence\nmost subjective of law-school subjects, legal ethics. Ante,\nat 20. The Court does not even try to justify importing\ninto equity the “prevailing professional norms” we have\nheld implicit in the right to counsel, Strickland, 466 U. S.,\nat 688. In his habeas action Holland has no right to coun\nsel. I object to this transparent attempt to smuggle Strick\nland into a realm the Sixth Amendment does not reach.\n                               C\n   The Court’s refusal to articulate an intelligible rule\nregarding the only issue actually before us stands in sharp\ncontrast to its insistence on deciding an issue that is not\nbefore us: whether Holland satisfied the second prerequi\nsite for equitable tolling by demonstrating that he pursued\nhis rights diligently, see Pace, 544 U. S., at 418–419. As\nthe Court admits, only the District Court addressed that\nquestion below; the Eleventh Circuit had no need to reach\nit. More importantly, it is not even arguably included\nwithin the question presented, which concerns only\nwhether an attorney’s gross negligence can constitute an\n“extraordinary circumstance” of the kind we have held\nessential for equitable tolling. Pet. for Cert. i. Whether\ntolling is ever available is fairly included in that question,\nbut whether Holland has overcome an additional, inde\npendent hurdle to tolling is not.\n   The Court offers no justification for deciding this dis\ntinct issue. The closest it comes is its observation that the\nState “does not defend” the District Court’s ruling regard\ning diligence. Ante, at 20. But the State had no reason to\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

Nor, contrary to the Court’s\nimplication, has the State conceded the issue. The foot\nnote of the State’s brief which the Court cites did just the\nopposite: After observing that only the extraordinary\ncircumstance prong of the equitable-tolling test is at issue,\nthe State (perhaps astutely apprehensive that the Court\nmight ignore that fact) added that “to the extent the Court\nconsiders the matter” of Holland’s diligence, “Respondent\nrelies on the findings of the district court below.” Brief for\nRespondent 38, n. 19. The Court also cites a statement by\nthe State’s counsel at oral argument, Tr. of Oral Arg. 43,\nand Holland’s counsel’s characterization of it as a conces\nsion, id., at 52. But the remark, in context, shows only\nthat the State does not dispute diligence in this Court,\nwhere the only issue is extraordinary circumstances:\n    “Well, that goes to the issue . . . of diligence, of course, \n\n    which is not the issue we’re looking at. We’re looking\n\n    at the extraordinary circumstances, not the dili\n\n    gence. . . .\n\n    “[W]e’ll concede diligence for the moment . . . . ” Id., \n\n    at 43. \n\n   Notwithstanding the Court’s confidence that the District\nCourt was wrong, it is not even clear that Holland acted\nwith the requisite diligence. Although Holland repeatedly\ncontacted Collins and the state courts, there were other\nreasonable measures Holland could have pursued. For\nexample, as we suggested in Pace, supra, at 416—decided\nwhile Holland’s state habeas petition was still pending—\nHolland might have filed a “ ‘protective’ ” federal habeas\napplication and asked the District Court to stay the fed\neral action until his state proceedings had concluded. He\nalso presumably could have checked the court records in\nthe prison’s writ room—from which he eventually learned\nof the state court’s decision, 539 F. 3d, at 1337—on a more\n14                       HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nregular basis. And he could have sought permission from\nthe state courts to proceed pro se and thus remove Collins\nfrom the equation.10 This is not to say the District Court\nwas correct to conclude Holland was not diligent; but the\nanswer is not as obvious as the Court would make it seem.\n                         *     *    *\n  The Court’s impulse to intervene when a litigant’s law\nyer has made mistakes is understandable; the temptation\nto tinker with technical rules to achieve what appears a\njust result is often strong, especially when the client faces\n\n——————\n  10 Holland made many pro se filings in state court (which were\n\nstricken because Holland was still represented), and he sought to have\nnew counsel appointed in Collins’s place, but did not seek to proceed\npro se. The Court does not dispute this, nor does Holland. The most he\nasserts is that one of the pro se motions he filed, if granted, would have\nentitled him to proceed pro se, see Brief for Petitioner 50–51—an\nassertion he appears not to have made in the District Court, see 1\nRecord, Doc. 35, at 15. The concurrence equates that assertion with an\nallegation that he actually sought to litigate his case on his own behalf.\nAnte, at 6. It is not the same. The filing Holland refers to, see Brief for\nPetitioner 12, and n. 13, like his earlier filings, requested that Collins\nbe replaced by new counsel. App. 149–163. The motion also asked for a\nhearing pursuant to Nelson v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1672498\"><a href=\"/opinion/1672498/nelson-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 259 (Fla. App.\n1973), to show Collins’s poor performance, App. 149–150, but that did\nnot amount to a request to proceed pro se. Nelson held that a defendant\nfacing trial who seeks to discharge his court-appointed counsel for\nineffectiveness is entitled to a hearing to determine if new counsel is\nrequired. 274 So. 2d, at 259. If the defendant fails to make that\nshowing, but “continues to demand a dismissal of his court appointed\ncounsel,” Nelson explained that “a trial judge may in his discretion\ndischarge counsel and require the defendant to proceed to trial without\nrepresentation by court appointed counsel.” Ibid.; see also Hardwick v.\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1753148\"><a href=\"/opinion/1753148/hardwick-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1071</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1074–1075 (Fla. 1988). There is no reason why\nrequesting that procedure in state habeas proceedings should be\nconstrued as a request to proceed pro se. Holland, unlike a defendant\nstill facing trial, did not need permission to fire Collins, since there was\nno right to representation to waive. Once his request for a new attor\nney was denied, Holland himself could have informed Collins that his\nservices were no longer required.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

After the State Supreme Court af\n  firmed on direct appeal and denied collateral relief, Holland filed a\n  pro se federal habeas corpus petition, which was approximately five\n  weeks late under the 1-year statute of limitations set forth in the An\n  titerrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28\n  U. S. C. §2244(d). The record facts reveal, inter alia, that Holland’s\n  court-appointed attorney, Bradley Collins, had failed to file a timely\n  federal petition, despite Holland’s many letters emphasizing the im\n  portance of doing so; that Collins apparently did not do the research\n  necessary to find out the proper filing date, despite the fact that Hol\n  land had identified the applicable legal rules for him; that Collins\n  failed to inform Holland in a timely manner that the State Supreme\n  Court had decided his case, despite Holland’s many pleas for that in\n  formation; and that Collins failed to communicate with Holland over\n  a period of years, despite Holland’s pleas for responses to his letters.\n  Meanwhile, Holland repeatedly requested that the state courts and\n  the Florida bar remove Collins from his case. Based on these and\n  other record facts, Holland asked the Federal District Court to toll\n  the AEDPA limitations period for equitable reasons. It refused, hold\n  ing that he had not demonstrated the due diligence necessary to in\n  voke equitable tolling. Affirming, the Eleventh Circuit held that, re\n  gardless of diligence, Holland’s case did not constitute “extraordinary\n  circumstances.” Specifically, it held that when a petitioner seeks to\n  excuse a late filing based on his attorney’s unprofessional conduct,\n  that conduct, even if grossly negligent, cannot justify equitable toll\n  ing absent proof of bad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, mental im\n  pairment, or the like.\n2                       HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld:\n    1. Section 2244(d), the AEDPA statute of limitations, is subject to\n equitable tolling in appropriate cases. Pp. 12–21.\n       (a) Several considerations support the Court’s holding. First, be\n cause AEDPA’s “statute of limitations defense . . . is not ‘jurisdic\n tional,’ ” Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198, 205, 213, it is subject to a\n “rebuttable presumption” in favor “of equitable tolling,” Irwin v. De\n partment of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95–96. That presump\n tion’s strength is reinforced here by the fact that “equitable princi\n ples” have traditionally “governed” substantive habeas law. Munaf v.\n Geren, 553 U. S. 674, ___, and the fact that Congress enacted AEDPA\n after Irwin and therefore was likely aware that courts, when inter\n preting AEDPA’s timing provisions, would apply the presumption,\n see, e.g., Merck & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U. S. ___, ___. Second,\n §2244(d) differs significantly from the statutes at issue in United\n States v. Brockamp, 519 U. S. 347, 350–352, and United States v.\n Beggerly, 524 U. S. 38, 49, in which the Court held that Irwin’s pre\n sumption had been overcome. For example, unlike the subject mat\n ters at issue in those cases—tax collection and land claims—\n AEDPA’s subject matter, habeas corpus, pertains to an area of the\n law where equity finds a comfortable home. See Munaf, supra, at\n ___. Brockamp, supra, at 352, distinguished. Moreover, AEDPA’s\n limitations period is neither unusually generous nor unusually com\n plex. Finally, the Court disagrees with respondent’s argument that\n equitable tolling undermines AEDPA’s basic purpose of eliminating\n delays in the federal habeas review process, see, e.g., Day, supra, at\n 205–206. AEDPA seeks to do so without undermining basic habeas\n corpus principles and by harmonizing the statute with prior law, un\n der which a petition’s timeliness was always determined under equi\n table principles. See, e.g., Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 483.\n Such harmonization, along with the Great Writ’s importance as the\n only writ explicitly protected by the Constitution, counsels hesitancy\n before interpreting AEDPA’s silence on equitable tolling as congres\n sional intent to close courthouse doors that a strong equitable claim\n would keep open. Pp. 12–16.\n       (b) The Eleventh Circuit’s per se standard is too rigid. A “peti\n tioner” is “entitled to equitable tolling” if he shows “(1) that he has\n been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary\n circumstance stood in his way” and prevented timely filing. Pace v.\n DiGuglielmo, 544 U. S. 408, 418. Such “extraordinary circumstances”\n are not limited to those that satisfy the Eleventh Circuit’s test.\n Courts must often “exercise [their] equity powers . . . on a case-by\n case basis,” Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U. S. 360, 375, demonstrating\n “flexibility” and avoiding “mechanical rules,” Holmberg v. Armbrecht,\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  327 U. S. 392, 396, in order to “relieve hardships . . . aris[ing] from a\n  hard and fast adherence” to more absolute legal rules, Hazel-Atlas\n  Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U. S. 238, 248. The Court’s\n  cases recognize that equity courts can and do draw upon decisions\n  made in other similar cases for guidance, exercising judgment in light\n  of precedent, but with awareness of the fact that specific circum\n  stances, often hard to predict, could warrant special treatment in an\n  appropriate case. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 753, distin\n  guished. No pre-existing rule of law or precedent demands the Elev\n  enth Circuit’s rule. That rule is difficult to reconcile with more gen\n  eral equitable principles in that it fails to recognize that, at least\n  sometimes, an attorney’s unprofessional conduct can be so egregious\n  as to create an extraordinary circumstance warranting equitable toll\n  ing, as several other federal courts have specifically held. Although\n  equitable tolling is not warranted for “a garden variety claim of ex\n  cusable neglect,” Irwin, supra, at 96, this case presents far more seri\n  ous instances of attorney misconduct than that. Pp. 16–19.\n    2. While the record facts suggest that this case may well present\n  “extraordinary” circumstances, the Court does not state its conclusion\n  absolutely because more proceedings may be necessary. The District\n  Court incorrectly rested its ruling not on a lack of such circum\n  stances, but on a lack of diligence. Here, Holland diligently pursued\n  his rights by writing Collins numerous letters seeking crucial infor\n  mation and providing direction, by repeatedly requesting that Collins\n  be removed from his case, and by filing his own pro se habeas petition\n  on the day he learned his AEDPA filing period had expired. Because\n  the District Court erroneously concluded that Holland was not dili\n  gent, and because the Court of Appeals erroneously relied on an\n  overly rigid per se approach, no lower court has yet considered\n  whether the facts of this case indeed constitute extraordinary cir\n  cumstances sufficient to warrant equitable tolling. The Eleventh\n  Circuit may determine on remand whether such tolling is appropri\n  ate, or whether an evidentiary hearing and other proceedings might\n  indicate that the State should prevail.

FLORIDA\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 14, 2010] \n\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  We here decide that the timeliness provision in the\nfederal habeas corpus statute is subject to equitable toll\ning. See Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. §2244(d). We also consider its\napplication in this case. In the Court of Appeals’ view,\nwhen a petitioner seeks to excuse a late filing on the basis\nof his attorney’s unprofessional conduct, that conduct,\neven if it is “negligent” or “grossly negligent,” cannot “rise\nto the level of egregious attorney misconduct” that would\nwarrant equitable tolling unless the petitioner offers\n“proof of bad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, mental\nimpairment or so forth.” 539 F. 3d 1334, 1339 (CA11\n2008) (per curiam). In our view, this standard is too rigid.\nSee Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89,\n96 (1990); see also Lawrence v. Florida, 549 U. S. 327, 336\n(2007). We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals and remand for further proceedings.\n                            I\n  AEDPA states that “[a] 1-year period of limitation shall\napply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a\nperson in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State\n2                   HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt.” §2244(d)(1). It also says that “[t]he time during\nwhich a properly filed application for State post-conviction\n. . . review” is “pending shall not be counted” against the 1\nyear period. §2244(d)(2).\n    On January 19, 2006, Albert Holland filed a pro se\nhabeas corpus petition in the Federal District Court for\nthe Southern District of Florida. Both Holland (the peti\ntioner) and the State of Florida (the respondent) agree\nthat, unless equitably tolled, the statutory limitations\nperiod applicable to Holland’s petition expired approxi\nmately five weeks before the petition was filed. See Brief\nfor Respondent 9, and n. 7; Brief for Petitioner 5, and n. 4.\nHolland asked the District Court to toll the limitations\nperiod for equitable reasons. We shall set forth in some\ndetail the record facts that underlie Holland’s claim.\n                                A\n   In 1997, Holland was convicted of first-degree murder\nand sentenced to death. The Florida Supreme Court\naffirmed that judgment. Holland v. State, 773 So. 2d 1065\n(Fla. 2000). On October 1, 2001, this Court denied Hol\nland’s petition for certiorari. 534 U. S. 834. And on that\ndate—the date that our denial of the petition ended fur\nther direct review of Holland’s conviction—the 1-year\nAEDPA limitations clock began to run. See 28 U. S. C.\n§2244(d)(1)(A); Jimenez v. Quarterman, 555 U. S. ___, ___\n(2009) (slip op., at 6).\n   Thirty-seven days later, on November 7, 2001, Florida\nappointed attorney Bradley Collins to represent Holland\nin all state and federal postconviction proceedings. Cf.\nFla. Stat. §§27.710, 27.711(2) (2007). By September 19,\n2002—316 days after his appointment and 12 days before\nthe 1-year AEDPA limitations period expired—Collins,\nacting on Holland’s behalf, filed a motion for postconvic\ntion relief in the state trial court. Cf. Brief for Respondent\n9, n. 7. That filing automatically stopped the running of\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe AEDPA limitations period, §2244(d)(2), with, as we\nhave said, 12 days left on the clock.\n  For the next three years, Holland’s petition remained\npending in the state courts. During that time, Holland\nwrote Collins letters asking him to make certain that all of\nhis claims would be preserved for any subsequent federal\nhabeas corpus review. Collins wrote back, stating, “I\nwould like to reassure you that we are aware of state-time\nlimitations and federal exhaustion requirements.” App.\n55. He also said that he would “presen[t] . . . to the . . .\nfederal courts” any of Holland’s claims that the state\ncourts denied. Ibid. In a second letter Collins added,\n“should your Motion for Post-Conviction Relief be denied”\nby the state courts, “your state habeas corpus claims will\nthen be ripe for presentation in a petition for writ of ha\nbeas corpus in federal court.” Id., at 61.\n  In mid-May 2003 the state trial court denied Holland\nrelief, and Collins appealed that denial to the Florida\nSupreme Court. Almost two years later, in February\n2005, the Florida Supreme Court heard oral argument in\nthe case. See 539 F. 3d, at 1337. But during that 2-year\nperiod, relations between Collins and Holland began to\nbreak down. Indeed, between April 2003 and January\n2006, Collins communicated with Holland only three\ntimes—each time by letter. See No. 1:06–cv–20182–PAS\n(SD Fla., Apr. 27, 2007), p. 7, n. 6 (hereinafter District\nCourt opinion), App. 91, n. 6.\n  Holland, unhappy with this lack of communication,\ntwice wrote to the Florida Supreme Court, asking it to\nremove Collins from his case. In the second letter, filed on\nJune 17, 2004, he said that he and Collins had experi\nenced “a complete breakdown in communication.” App.\n160. Holland informed the court that Collins had “not\nkept [him] updated on the status of [his] capital case” and\nthat Holland had “not seen or spoken to” Collins “since\nApril 2003.” Id., at 150. He wrote, “Mr. Collins has aban\n4                  HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndoned [me]” and said, “[I have] no idea what is going on\nwith [my] capital case on appeal.” Id., at 152. He added\nthat “Collins has never made any reasonable effort to\nestablish any relationship of trust or confidence with\n[me],” id., at 155, and stated that he “does not trust” or\nhave “any confidence in Mr. Collin’s ability to represent\n[him],” id., at 152. Holland concluded by asking that\nCollins be “dismissed (removed) off his capital case” or\nthat he be given a hearing in order to demonstrate Collins’\ndeficiencies. Id., at 155, 161. The State responded that\nHolland could not file any pro se papers with the court\nwhile he was represented by counsel, including papers\nseeking new counsel. Id., at 42–45. The Florida Supreme\nCourt agreed and denied Holland’s requests. Id., at 46.\n  During this same period Holland wrote various letters to\nthe Clerk of the Florida Supreme Court. In the last of\nthese he wrote, “[I]f I had a competent, conflict-free, post\nconviction, appellate attorney representing me, I would not\nhave to write you this letter. I’m not trying to get on your\nnerves. I just would like to know exactly what is happen\ning with my case on appeal to the Supreme Court of Flor\nida.” Id., at 147. During that same time period, Holland\nalso filed a complaint against Collins with the Florida Bar\nAssociation, but the complaint was denied. Id., at 65–67.\n  Collins argued Holland’s appeal before the Florida\nSupreme Court on February 10, 2005. 539 F. 3d, at 1337.\nShortly thereafter, Holland wrote to Collins emphasizing\nthe importance of filing a timely petition for habeas corpus\nin federal court once the Florida Supreme Court issued its\nruling. Specifically, on March 3, 2005, Holland wrote:\n    “Dear Mr. Collins, P. A.:\n      “How are you? Fine I hope.\n      “I write this letter to ask that you please write me\n    back, as soon as possible to let me know what the\n    status of my case is on appeal to the Supreme Court of\n                Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n    Florida.\n      “If the Florida Supreme Court denies my [postcon\n    viction] and State Habeas Corpus appeals, please file\n    my 28 U. S. C. 2254 writ of Habeas Corpus petition,\n    before my deadline to file it runs out (expires).\n      “Thank you very much.\n      “Please have a nice day.” App. 210 (emphasis\n    added).\nCollins did not answer this letter.\n  On June 15, 2005, Holland wrote again:\n    “Dear Mr. Collins:\n      “How are you? Fine I hope.\n      “On March 3, 2005 I wrote you a letter, asking that\n    you let me know the status of my case on appeal to the\n    Supreme Court of Florida.\n      “Also, have you begun preparing my 28 U. S. C.\n    §2254 writ of Habeas Corpus petition? Please let me\n    know, as soon as possible.\n      “Thank you.” Id., at 212 (emphasis added).\nBut again, Collins did not reply.\n  Five months later, in November 2005, the Florida Su\npreme Court affirmed the lower court decision denying\nHolland relief. Holland v. State, 916 So. 2d 750 (per cu\nriam). Three weeks after that, on December 1, 2005, the\ncourt issued its mandate, making its decision final. 539\nF. 3d, at 1337. At that point, the AEDPA federal habeas\nclock again began to tick—with 12 days left on the 1-year\nmeter. See Coates v. Byrd, 211 F. 3d 1225 (CA11 2000)\n(per curiam) (AEDPA clock restarts when state court\ncompletes postconviction review); Lawrence, 549 U. S. 327\n(same). Twelve days later, on December 13, 2005, Hol\nland’s AEDPA time limit expired.\n                         B\n  Four weeks after the AEDPA time limit expired, on\n6                  HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nJanuary 9, 2006, Holland, still unaware of the Florida\nSupreme Court ruling issued in his case two months ear\nlier, wrote Collins a third letter:\n    “Dear Mr. Bradley M. Collins:\n       “How are you? Fine I hope.\n       “I write this letter to ask that you please let me\n    know the status of my appeals before the Supreme\n    Court of Florida. Have my appeals been decided yet?\n       “Please send me the [necessary information] . . . so\n    that I can determine when the deadline will be to file\n    my 28 U. S. C. Rule 2254 Federal Habeas Corpus Pe\n    tition, in accordance with all United States Supreme\n    Court and Eleventh Circuit case law and applicable\n    ‘Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act,’ if my\n    appeals before the Supreme Court of Florida are de\n    nied.\n       “Please be advised that I want to preserve my privi\n    lege to federal review of all of my state convictions\n    and sentences.\n       “Mr. Collins, would you please also inform me as to\n    which United States District Court my 28 U. S. C.\n    Rule 2254 Federal Habeas Corpus Petition will have\n    to be timely filed in and that court’s address?\n       “Thank you very much.” App. 214.\nCollins did not answer.\n  Nine days later, on January 18, 2006, Holland, working\nin the prison library, learned for the first time that the\nFlorida Supreme Court had issued a final determination\nin his case and that its mandate had issued—five weeks\nprior. 539 F. 3d, at 1337. He immediately wrote out his\nown pro se federal habeas petition and mailed it to the\nFederal District Court for the Southern District of Florida\nthe next day. Ibid. The petition begins by stating,\n      “Comes now Albert R. Holland, Jr., a Florida death\n    row inmate and states that court appointed counsel\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    has failed to undertake timely action to seek Federal\n    Review in my case by filing a 28 U. S. C. Rule 2254\n    Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus on my behalf.”\n    App. 181.\nIt then describes the various constitutional claims that\nHolland hoped to assert in federal court.\n  The same day that he mailed that petition, Holland\nreceived a letter from Collins telling him that Collins\nintended to file a petition for certiorari in this Court from\nthe State Supreme Court’s most recent ruling. Holland\nanswered immediately:\n    “Dear Mr. Bradley M. Collins:\n         .           .           .          .             .\n      “Since recently, the Supreme Court of Florida has\n    denied my [postconviction] and state writ of Habeas\n    Corpus Petition. I am left to understand that you are\n    planning to seek certiorari on these matters.\n      “It’s my understanding that the AEDPA time limi\n    tations is not tolled during discretionary appellate re\n    views, such as certiorari applications resulting from\n    denial of state post conviction proceedings.\n      “Therefore, I advise you not to file certiorari if doing\n    so affects or jeopardizes my one year grace period as\n    prescribed by the AEDPA.\n      “Thank you very much.” Id., at 216 (some emphasis\n    deleted).\nHolland was right about the law. See Coates, supra, at\n1226–1227 (AEDPA not tolled during pendency of petition\nfor certiorari from judgment denying state postconviction\nreview); accord, Lawrence v. Florida, 421 F. 3d 1221, 1225\n(CA11 2005), aff’d, 549 U. S., at 331–336.\n  On January 26, 2006, Holland tried to call Collins from\nprison. But he called collect and Collins’ office would not\naccept the call. App. 218. Five days later, Collins wrote to\nHolland and told him for the very first time that, as\n8                  HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCollins understood AEDPA law, the limitations period\napplicable to Holland’s federal habeas application had in\nfact expired in 2000—before Collins had begun to repre\nsent Holland. Specifically, Collins wrote:\n    “Dear Mr. Holland:\n       “I am in receipt of your letter dated January 20,\n    2006 concerning operation of AEDPA time limitations.\n    One hurdle in our upcoming efforts at obtaining fed\n    eral habeas corpus relief will be that the one-year\n    statutory time frame for filing such a petition began to\n    run after the case was affirmed on October 5, 2000\n    [when your] Judgment and Sentence . . . were af\n    firmed by the Florida Supreme Court. However, it\n    was not until November 7, 2001, that I received the\n    Order appointing me to the case. As you can see, I\n    was appointed about a year after your case became fi\n    nal. . . .\n       “[T]he AEDPA time period [thus] had run before my\n    appointment and therefore before your [postconvic\n    tion] motion was filed.” Id., at 78–79 (emphasis\n    added).\n  Collins was wrong about the law. As we have said,\nHolland’s 1-year limitations period did not begin to run\nuntil this Court denied Holland’s petition for certiorari\nfrom the state courts’ denial of relief on direct review,\nwhich occurred on October 1, 2001. See 28 U. S. C.\n§2244(d)(1)(A); Jimenez, 555 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6);\nBond v. Moore, 309 F. 3d 770, 774 (CA11 2002). And when\nCollins was appointed (on November 7, 2001) the AEDPA\nclock therefore had 328 days left to go.\n  Holland immediately wrote back to Collins, pointing this\nout.\n    “Dear Mr. Collins:\n      “I received your letter dated January 31, 2006. You\n    are incorrect in stating that ‘the one-year statutory\n             Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             9\n\n                 Opinion of the Court\n\ntime frame for filing my 2254 petition began to run af\nter my case was affirmed on October 5, 2000, by the\nFlorida Supreme Court.’ As stated on page three of\n[the recently filed] Petition for a writ of certiorari, Oc\ntober 1, 2001 is when the United States Supreme\nCourt denied my initial petition for writ of certiorari\nand that is when my case became final. That meant\nthat the time would be tolled once I filed my [postcon\nviction] motion in the trial court.\n   “Also, Mr. Collins you never told me that my time\nran out (expired). I told you to timely file my 28\nU. S. C. 2254 Habeas Corpus Petition before the dead\nline, so that I would not be time-barred.\n   “You never informed me of oral arguments or of the\nSupreme Court of Florida’s November 10, 2005 deci\nsion denying my postconviction appeals. You never\nkept me informed about the status of my case, al\nthough you told me that you would immediately in\nform me of the court’s decision as soon as you heard\nanything.\n   “Mr. Collins, I filed a motion on January 19, 2006\n[in federal court] to preserve my rights, because I did\nnot want to be time-barred. Have you heard anything\nabout the aforesaid motion? Do you know what the\nstatus of aforesaid motion is?\n   “Mr. Collins, please file my 2254 Habeas Petition\nimmediately. Please do not wait any longer, even\nthough it will be untimely filed at least it will be filed\nwithout wasting anymore time. (valuable time).\n   “Again, please file my 2254 Petition at once.\n   “Your letter is the first time that you have ever\nmentioned anything to me about my time had run out,\nbefore you were appointed to represent me, and that\nmy one-year started to run on October 5, 2000.\n   “Please find out the status of my motion that I filed\non January 19, 2006 and let me know.\n10                  HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n      “Thank you very much.” App. 222–223.\nCollins did not answer this letter. Nor did he file a federal\nhabeas petition as Holland requested.\n   On March 1, 2006, Holland filed another complaint\nagainst Collins with the Florida Bar Association. See\nRecord, Doc. 41, Exh. 1, p. 8. This time the bar asked\nCollins to respond, which he did, through his own attor\nney, on March 21. Id., at 2. And the very next day, over\nthree months after Holland’s AEDPA statute of limita\ntions had expired, Collins mailed a proposed federal ha\nbeas petition to Holland, asking him to review it. See id.,\nDoc. 20, Exh. W.\n   But by that point Holland had already filed a pro se\nmotion in the District Court asking that Collins be dis\nmissed as his attorney. App. 192. The State responded to\nthat request by arguing once again that Holland could not\nfile a pro se motion seeking to have Collins removed while\nhe was represented by counsel, i.e., represented by Collins.\nSee id., at 47–51. But this time the court considered\nHolland’s motion, permitted Collins to withdraw from the\ncase, and appointed a new lawyer for Holland. See Re\ncord, Docs. 9–10, 17–18, 22. And it also received briefing\non whether the circumstances of the case justified the\nequitable tolling of the AEDPA limitations period for a\nsufficient period of time (approximately five weeks) to\nmake Holland’s petition timely.\n                              C\n  After considering the briefs, the Federal District Court\nheld that the facts did not warrant equitable tolling and\nthat consequently Holland’s petition was untimely. The\ncourt, noting that Collins had prepared numerous filings\non Holland’s behalf in the state courts, and suggesting\nthat Holland was a difficult client, intimated, but did not\nhold, that Collins’ professional conduct in the case was at\nworst merely “negligent.” See District Court opinion 7–8,\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nApp. 90–93. But the court rested its holding on an alter\nnative rationale: It wrote that, even if Collins’ “behavior\ncould be characterized as an ‘extraordinary circum\nstance,’ ” Holland “did not seek any help from the court\nsystem to find out the date [the] mandate issued denying\nhis state habeas petition, nor did he seek aid from ‘outside\nsupporters.’ ” Id., at 8, App. 92. Hence, the court held,\nHolland did not “demonstrate” the “due diligence” neces\nsary to invoke “equitable tolling.” Ibid.\n    On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit agreed with the District\nCourt that Holland’s habeas petition was untimely. The\nCourt of Appeals first agreed with Holland that\n“ ‘[e]quitable tolling can be applied to . . . AEDPA’s statu\ntory deadline.’ ” 539 F. 3d, at 1338 (quoting Helton v.\nSecretary for Dept. of Corrections, 259 F. 3d 1310, 1312\n(CA11 2001)). But it also held that equitable tolling could\nnot be applied in a case, like Holland’s, that involves no\nmore than “[p]ure professional negligence” on the part of a\npetitioner’s attorney because such behavior can never\nconstitute an “extraordinary circumstance.” 539 F. 3d, at\n1339. The court wrote:\n    “We will assume that Collins’s alleged conduct is neg\n    ligent, even grossly negligent. But in our view, no al\n    legation of lawyer negligence or of failure to meet a\n    lawyer’s standard of care—in the absence of an allega\n    tion and proof of bad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty,\n    mental impairment or so forth on the lawyer’s part—\n    can rise to the level of egregious attorney misconduct\n    that would entitle Petitioner to equitable tolling.”\n    Ibid.\nHolland made “no allegation” that Collins had made a\n“knowing or reckless factual misrepresentation,” or that\nhe exhibited “dishonesty,” “divided loyalty,” or “mental\nimpairment.” Ibid. Hence, the court held, equitable toll\ning was per se inapplicable to Holland’s habeas petition.\n12                  HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe court did not address the District Court’s ruling with\nrespect to Holland’s diligence.\n  Holland petitioned for certiorari. Because the Court of\nAppeals’ application of the equitable tolling doctrine to\ninstances of professional misconduct conflicts with the\napproach taken by other Circuits, we granted the petition.\nCompare 539 F. 3d 1334 (case below), with, e.g., Bal\ndayaque v. United States, 338 F. 3d 145, 152–153 (CA2\n2003) (applying a less categorical approach); Spitsyn v.\nMoore, 345 F. 3d 796, 801–802 (CA9 2003) (same).\n                             II\n   We have not decided whether AEDPA’s statutory limita\ntions period may be tolled for equitable reasons. See\nLawrence, 549 U. S., at 336; Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544\nU. S. 408, 418, n. 8 (2005). Now, like all 11 Courts of\nAppeals that have considered the question, we hold that\n§2244(d) is subject to equitable tolling in appropriate\ncases. See Neverson v. Farquharson, 366 F. 3d 32, 41\n(CA1 2004); Smith v. McGinnis, 208 F. 3d 13, 17 (CA2\n2000) (per curiam); Miller v. New Jersey Dept. of Correc\ntions, 145 F. 3d 616, 617 (CA3 1998); Harris v. Hutchin\nson, 209 F. 3d 325, 329–330 (CA4 2000); Davis v. Johnson,\n158 F. 3d 806, 810 (CA5 1998); McClendon v. Sherman,\n329 F. 3d 490, 492 (CA6 2003); Taliani v. Chrans, 189\nF. 3d 597, 598 (CA7 1999); Moore v. United States, 173\nF. 3d 1131, 1134 (CA8 1999); Calderon v. United States\nDist.

United States, 177 F. 3d 1269, 1272\n(CA11 1999) (per curiam).\n   We base our conclusion on the following considerations.\nFirst, the AEDPA “statute of limitations defense . . . is not\n‘jurisdictional.’ ” Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198, 205\n(2006). It does not set forth “an inflexible rule requiring\ndismissal whenever” its “clock has run.” Id., at 208. See\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nalso id., at 213 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“We have repeat\nedly stated that the enactment of time-limitation periods\nsuch as that in §2244(d), without further elaboration,\nproduces defenses that are nonjurisdictional and thus\nsubject to waiver and forfeiture” (citing cases)); Brief for\nRespondent 22 (describing AEDPA limitations period as\n“non-jurisdictional”).\n   We have previously made clear that a nonjurisdictional\nfederal statute of limitations is normally subject to a\n“rebuttable presumption” in favor “of equitable tolling.”\nIrwin, 498 U. S., at 95–96; see also Young v. United States,\n535 U. S. 43, 49 (2002) (“It is hornbook law that limita\ntions periods are ‘customarily subject to “equitable toll\ning” ’ ” (quoting Irwin, supra, at 95)).\n   In the case of AEDPA, the presumption’s strength is\nreinforced by the fact that “ ‘equitable principles’ ” have\ntraditionally “ ‘governed’ ” the substantive law of habeas\ncorpus, Munaf v. Geren, 553 U. S. 674, 693 (2008), for we\nwill “not construe a statute to displace courts’ traditional\nequitable authority absent the ‘clearest command,’ ” Miller\nv. French, 530 U. S. 327, 340 (2000) (quoting Califano v.\nYamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 705 (1979)). The presumption’s\nstrength is yet further reinforced by the fact that Congress\nenacted AEDPA after this Court decided Irwin and there\nfore was likely aware that courts, when interpreting\nAEDPA’s timing provisions, would apply the presumption.\nSee, e.g., Merck & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U. S. ___, ___\n(2010) (slip op., at 12).\n   Second, the statute here differs significantly from the\nstatutes at issue in United States v. Brockamp, 519 U. S.\n347 (1997), and United States v. Beggerly, 524 U. S. 38\n(1998), two cases in which we held that Irwin’s presump\ntion had been overcome. In Brockamp, we interpreted a\nstatute of limitations that was silent on the question of\nequitable tolling as foreclosing application of that doctrine.\nBut in doing so we emphasized that the statute at issue (1)\n14                  HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“se[t] forth its time limitations in unusually emphatic\nform”; (2) used “highly detailed” and “technical” language\n“that, linguistically speaking, cannot easily be read as\ncontaining implicit exceptions”; (3) “reiterate[d] its limita\ntions several times in several different ways”; (4) related\nto an “underlying subject matter,” nationwide tax collec\ntion, with respect to which the practical consequences of\npermitting tolling would have been substantial; and (5)\nwould, if tolled, “require tolling, not only procedural limi\ntations, but also substantive limitations on the amount of\nrecovery—a kind of tolling for which we . . . found no\ndirect precedent.” 519 U. S., at 350–352. And in Beggerly\nwe held that Irwin’s presumption was overcome where (1)\nthe 12-year statute of limitations at issue was “unusually\ngenerous” and (2) the underlying claim “deal[t] with own\nership of land” and thereby implicated landowners’ need to\n“know with certainty what their rights are, and the period\nduring which those rights may be subject to challenge.”\n524 U. S., at 48–49.\n   By way of contrast, AEDPA’s statute of limitations,\nunlike the statute at issue in Brockamp, does not contain\nlanguage that is “unusually emphatic,” nor does it “re\niterat[e]” its time limitation. Neither would application of\nequitable tolling here affect the “substance” of a peti\ntioner’s claim. Moreover, in contrast to the 12-year limita\ntions period at issue in Beggerly, AEDPA’s limitations\nperiod is not particularly long. And unlike the subject\nmatters at issue in both Brockamp and Beggerly—tax\ncollection and land claims—AEDPA’s subject matter,\nhabeas corpus, pertains to an area of the law where equity\nfinds a comfortable home. See Munaf, supra, at 693. In\nshort, AEDPA’s 1-year limit reads like an ordinary, run-of\nthe-mill statute of limitations. See Calderon, supra, at\n1288.\n   Respondent, citing Brockamp, argues that AEDPA\nshould be interpreted to foreclose equitable tolling because\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe statute sets forth “explicit exceptions to its basic time\nlimits” that do “not include ‘equitable tolling.’ ” 519 U. S.,\nat 351; see Brief for Respondent 27. The statute does\ncontain multiple provisions relating to the events that\ntrigger its running. See §2244(d)(1); Clay v. United States,\n537 U. S. 522, 529 (2003); see also Cada v. Baxter Health\ncare Corp., 920 F. 2d 446, 450 (CA7 1990) (“We must . . .\ndistinguish between the accrual of the plaintiff’s claim and\nthe tolling of the statute of limitations . . .”); Wims v.\nUnited States, 225 F. 3d 186, 190 (CA2 2000) (same);\nWolin v. Smith Barney Inc., 83 F. 3d 847, 852 (CA7 1996)\n(same). And we concede that it is silent as to equitable\ntolling while containing one provision that expressly refers\nto a different kind of tolling. See §2244(d)(2) (stating that\n“[t]he time during which” a petitioner has a pending re\nquest for state postconviction relief “shall not be counted\ntoward” his “period of limitation” under AEDPA). But the\nfact that Congress expressly referred to tolling during\nstate collateral review proceedings is easily explained\nwithout rebutting the presumption in favor of equitable\ntolling. A petitioner cannot bring a federal habeas claim\nwithout first exhausting state remedies—a process that\nfrequently takes longer than one year. See Rose v. Lundy,\n455 U. S. 509 (1982); §2254(b)(1)(A). Hence, Congress had\nto explain how the limitations statute accounts for the\ntime during which such state proceedings are pending.\nThis special need for an express provision undermines any\ntemptation to invoke the interpretive maxim inclusio\nunius est exclusio alterius (to include one item (i.e., sus\npension during state-court collateral review) is to exclude\nother similar items (i.e., equitable tolling)). See Young,\nsupra, at 53 (rejecting claim that an “express tolling provi\nsion, appearing in the same subsection as the [limitations]\nperiod, demonstrates a statutory intent not to toll the\n[limitations] period”).\n   Third, and finally, we disagree with respondent that\n16                  HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nequitable tolling undermines AEDPA’s basic purposes.\nWe recognize that AEDPA seeks to eliminate delays in the\nfederal habeas review process. See Day, 547 U. S., at 205–\n206; Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 337 (2003). But\nAEDPA seeks to do so without undermining basic habeas\ncorpus principles and while seeking to harmonize the new\nstatute with prior law, under which a petition’s timeliness\nwas always determined under equitable principles. See\nSlack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 483 (2000) (“AEDPA’s\npresent provisions . . . incorporate earlier habeas corpus\nprinciples”); see also Day, 547 U. S., at 202, n. 1; id., at\n214 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); 2 R. Hertz & J. Liebman,\nFederal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure §24.2, pp.\n1123–1136 (5th ed. 2005). When Congress codified new\nrules governing this previously judicially managed area of\nlaw, it did so without losing sight of the fact that the “writ\nof habeas corpus plays a vital role in protecting constitu\ntional rights.” Slack, 529 U. S., at 483. It did not seek to\nend every possible delay at all costs. Cf. id., at 483–488.\nThe importance of the Great Writ, the only writ explicitly\nprotected by the Constitution, Art. I, §9, cl. 2, along with\ncongressional efforts to harmonize the new statute with\nprior law, counsels hesitancy before interpreting AEDPA’s\nstatutory silence as indicating a congressional intent to\nclose courthouse doors that a strong equitable claim would\nordinarily keep open.\n   For these reasons we conclude that neither AEDPA’s\ntextual characteristics nor the statute’s basic purposes\n“rebut” the basic presumption set forth in Irwin. And we\ntherefore join the Courts of Appeals in holding that\n§2244(d) is subject to equitable tolling.\n                              III\n  We have previously made clear that a “petitioner” is\n“entitled to equitable tolling” only if he shows “(1) that he\nhas been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nextraordinary circumstance stood in his way” and pre\nvented timely filing. Pace, 544 U. S., at 418 (emphasis\ndeleted). In this case, the “extraordinary circumstances”\nat issue involve an attorney’s failure to satisfy professional\nstandards of care. The Court of Appeals held that, where\nthat is so, even attorney conduct that is “grossly negligent”\ncan never warrant tolling absent “bad faith, dishonesty,\ndivided loyalty, mental impairment or so forth on the\nlawyer’s part.” 539 F. 3d, at 1339. But in our view, the\nCourt of Appeals’ standard is too rigid.\n   We have said that courts of equity “must be governed by\nrules and precedents no less than the courts of law.”\nLonchar v. Thomas, 517 U. S. 314, 323 (1996) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). But we have also made clear\nthat often the “exercise of a court’s equity powers . . . must\nbe made on a case-by-case basis.” Baggett v. Bullitt, 377\nU. S. 360, 375 (1964). In emphasizing the need for “flexi\nbility,” for avoiding “mechanical rules,” Holmberg v. Arm\nbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 396 (1946), we have followed a tradi\ntion in which courts of equity have sought to “relieve\nhardships which, from time to time, arise from a hard and\nfast adherence” to more absolute legal rules, which, if\nstrictly applied, threaten the “evils of archaic rigidity,”\nHazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U. S.\n238, 248 (1944). The “flexibility” inherent in “equitable\nprocedure” enables courts “to meet new situations [that]\ndemand equitable intervention, and to accord all the relief\nnecessary to correct . . . particular injustices.” Ibid. (per\nmitting postdeadline filing of bill of review). Taken to\ngether, these cases recognize that courts of equity can and\ndo draw upon decisions made in other similar cases for\nguidance. Such courts exercise judgment in light of prior\nprecedent, but with awareness of the fact that specific\ncircumstances, often hard to predict in advance, could\nwarrant special treatment in an appropriate case.\n   We recognize that, in the context of procedural default,\n18                  HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwe have previously stated, without qualification, that a\npetitioner “must ‘bear the risk of attorney error.’ ” Cole\nman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 752–753 (1991). But\nColeman was “a case about federalism,” id., at 726, in that\nit asked whether federal courts may excuse a petitioner’s\nfailure to comply with a state court’s procedural rules,\nnotwithstanding the state court’s determination that its\nown rules had been violated. Equitable tolling, by con\ntrast, asks whether federal courts may excuse a peti\ntioner’s failure to comply with federal timing rules, an\ninquiry that does not implicate a state court’s interpreta\ntion of state law.        Cf. Lawrence, 549 U. S., at 341\n(GINSBURG, J., dissenting). Holland does not argue that\nhis attorney’s misconduct provides a substantive ground\nfor relief, cf. §2254(i), nor is this a case that asks whether\nAEDPA’s statute of limitations should be recognized at all,\ncf. Day, supra, at 209. Rather, this case asks how equity\nshould be applied once the statute is recognized. And\ngiven equity’s resistance to rigid rules, we cannot read\nColeman as requiring a per se approach in this context.\n   In short, no pre-existing rule of law or precedent de\nmands a rule like the one set forth by the Eleventh Circuit\nin this case. That rule is difficult to reconcile with more\ngeneral equitable principles in that it fails to recognize\nthat, at least sometimes, professional misconduct that\nfails to meet the Eleventh Circuit’s standard could none\ntheless amount to egregious behavior and create an ex\ntraordinary circumstance that warrants equitable tolling.\nAnd, given the long history of judicial application of equi\ntable tolling, courts can easily find precedents that can\nguide their judgments. Several lower courts have specifi\ncally held that unprofessional attorney conduct may, in\ncertain circumstances, prove “egregious” and can be “ex\ntraordinary” even though the conduct in question may not\nsatisfy the Eleventh Circuit’s rule. See, e.g., Nara v.\nFrank, 264 F. 3d 310, 320 (CA3 2001) (ordering hearing as\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto whether client who was “effectively abandoned” by\nlawyer merited tolling); Calderon, 128 F. 3d, at 1289\n(allowing tolling where client was prejudiced by a last\nminute change in representation that was beyond his\ncontrol); Baldayaque, 338 F. 3d, at 152–153 (finding that\nwhere an attorney failed to perform an essential service,\nto communicate with the client, and to do basic legal\nresearch, tolling could, under the circumstances, be war\nranted); Spitsyn, 345 F. 3d, at 800–802 (finding that “ex\ntraordinary circumstances” may warrant tolling where\nlawyer denied client access to files, failed to prepare a\npetition, and did not respond to his client’s communica\ntions); United States v. Martin, 408 F. 3d 1089, 1096 (CA8\n2005) (client entitled to equitable tolling where his attor\nney retained files, made misleading statements, and en\ngaged in similar conduct).\n   We have previously held that “a garden variety claim of\nexcusable neglect,” Irwin, 498 U. S., at 96, such as a sim\nple “miscalculation” that leads a lawyer to miss a filing\ndeadline, Lawrence, supra, at 336, does not warrant equi\ntable tolling. But the case before us does not involve, and\nwe are not considering, a “garden variety claim” of attor\nney negligence. Rather, the facts of this case present far\nmore serious instances of attorney misconduct. And, as\nwe have said, although the circumstances of a case must\nbe “extraordinary” before equitable tolling can be applied,\nwe hold that such circumstances are not limited to those\nthat satisfy the test that the Court of Appeals used in this\ncase.\n                            IV\n  The record facts that we have set forth in Part I of this\nopinion suggest that this case may well be an “extraordi\nnary” instance in which petitioner’s attorney’s conduct\nconstituted far more than “garden variety” or “excusable\nneglect.” To be sure, Collins failed to file Holland’s peti\n20                  HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion on time and appears to have been unaware of the date\non which the limitations period expired—two facts that,\nalone, might suggest simple negligence. But, in these\ncircumstances, the record facts we have elucidated suggest\nthat the failure amounted to more: Here, Collins failed to\nfile Holland’s federal petition on time despite Holland’s\nmany letters that repeatedly emphasized the importance\nof his doing so. Collins apparently did not do the research\nnecessary to find out the proper filing date, despite Hol\nland’s letters that went so far as to identify the applicable\nlegal rules. Collins failed to inform Holland in a timely\nmanner about the crucial fact that the Florida Supreme\nCourt had decided his case, again despite Holland’s many\npleas for that information. And Collins failed to communi\ncate with his client over a period of years, despite various\npleas from Holland that Collins respond to his letters.\n   A group of teachers of legal ethics tells us that these\nvarious failures violated fundamental canons of profes\nsional responsibility, which require attorneys to perform\nreasonably competent legal work, to communicate with\ntheir clients, to implement clients’ reasonable requests, to\nkeep their clients informed of key developments in their\ncases, and never to abandon a client. See Brief for Legal\nEthics Professors et al. as Amici Curiae (describing ethical\nrules set forth in case law, the Restatements of Agency,\nthe Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers\n(1998), and in the ABA Model Rules of Professional Con\nduct (2009)). And in this case, the failures seriously preju\ndiced a client who thereby lost what was likely his single\nopportunity for federal habeas review of the lawfulness of\nhis imprisonment and of his death sentence.\n   We do not state our conclusion in absolute form, how\never, because more proceedings may be necessary. The\nDistrict Court rested its ruling not on a lack of extraordi\nnary circumstances, but rather on a lack of diligence—a\nruling that respondent does not defend. See Brief for\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nRespondent 38, n. 19; Tr. of Oral Arg. 43, 52. We think\nthat the District Court’s conclusion was incorrect. The\ndiligence required for equitable tolling purposes is “ ‘rea\nsonable diligence,’ ” see, e.g., Lonchar, 517 U. S., at 326,\nnot “ ‘ “maximum feasible diligence,” ’ ” Starns v. Andrews,\n524 F. 3d 612, 618 (CA5 2008) (quoting Moore v. Knight,\n368 F. 3d 936, 940 (CA7 2004)). Here, Holland not only\nwrote his attorney numerous letters seeking crucial in\nformation and providing direction; he also repeatedly\ncontacted the state courts, their clerks, and the Florida\nState Bar Association in an effort to have Collins—the\ncentral impediment to the pursuit of his legal remedy—\nremoved from his case. And, the very day that Holland\ndiscovered that his AEDPA clock had expired due to\nCollins’ failings, Holland prepared his own habeas petition\npro se and promptly filed it with the District Court.\n   Because the District Court erroneously relied on a lack\nof diligence, and because the Court of Appeals erroneously\nrelied on an overly rigid per se approach, no lower court\nhas yet considered in detail the facts of this case to deter\nmine whether they indeed constitute extraordinary cir\ncumstances sufficient to warrant equitable relief. We are\n“[m]indful that this is a court of final review and not first\nview.” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U. S.\n103, 110 (2001) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). And we also recognize the prudence, when faced\nwith an “equitable, often fact-intensive” inquiry, of allow\ning the lower courts “to undertake it in the first instance.”\nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U. S. 524, 540 (2005) (STEVENS,\nJ., dissenting). Thus, because we conclude that the Dis\ntrict Court’s determination must be set aside, we leave it\nto the Court of Appeals to determine whether the facts in\nthis record entitle Holland to equitable tolling, or whether\nfurther proceedings, including an evidentiary hearing,\nmight indicate that respondent should prevail.\n   The judgment below is reversed, and the case is re\n22                HOLLAND v.

FLORIDA\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [June 14, 2010] \n\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO, concurring in part and concurring in the\njudgment.\n  This case raises two broad questions: first, whether the\nstatute of limitations set out in the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C.\n§2244(d), is subject to equitable tolling; and second, as\nsuming an affirmative answer to the first question,\nwhether petitioner in this particular case has alleged facts\nthat are sufficient to satisfy the “extraordinary circum\nstances” prong of the equitable tolling test. I agree with\nthe Court’s conclusion that equitable tolling is available\nunder AEDPA. I also agree with much of the Court’s\ndiscussion concerning whether equitable tolling is avail\nable on the facts of this particular case. In particular, I\nagree that the Court of Appeals erred by essentially limit\ning the relevant inquiry to the question whether “gross\nnegligence” of counsel may be an extraordinary circum\nstance warranting equitable tolling. As the Court makes\nclear, petitioner in this case has alleged certain facts that\ngo well beyond any form of attorney negligence, see ante,\nat 3–4, 19, and the Court of Appeals does not appear to\nhave asked whether those particular facts provide an\nindependent basis for tolling. Accordingly, I concur in the\nCourt’s decision to reverse the judgment below and re\nmand so that the lower courts may properly apply the\ncorrect legal standard.\n2                   HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n  Although I agree that the Court of Appeals applied the\nwrong standard, I think that the majority does not do\nenough to explain the right standard. It is of course true\nthat equitable tolling requires “extraordinary circum\nstances,” but that conclusory formulation does not provide\nmuch guidance to lower courts charged with reviewing the\nmany habeas petitions filed every year. I therefore write\nseparately to set forth my understanding of the principles\ngoverning the availability of equitable tolling in cases\ninvolving attorney misconduct.\n                               I\n   “Generally, a litigant seeking equitable tolling bears the\nburden of establishing two elements: (1) that he has been\npursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraor\ndinary circumstance stood in his way.” Pace v. DiGug\nlielmo, 544 U. S. 408, 418 (2005). The dispute in this case\nconcerns whether and when attorney misconduct amounts\nto an “extraordinary circumstance” that stands in a peti\ntioner’s way and prevents the petitioner from filing a\ntimely petition. I agree with the majority that it is not\npractical to attempt to provide an exhaustive compilation\nof the kinds of situations in which attorney misconduct\nmay provide a basis for equitable tolling. In my view,\nhowever, it is useful to note that several broad principles\nmay be distilled from this Court’s precedents.\n   First, our prior cases make it abundantly clear that\nattorney negligence is not an extraordinary circumstance\nwarranting equitable tolling. In Lawrence v. Florida, 549\nU. S. 327, 336 (2007), the Court expressly rejected the\npetitioner’s contention that “his counsel’s mistake in mis\ncalculating the limitations period entitle[d] him to equita\nble tolling.” “Attorney miscalculation,” the Court held, “is\nsimply not sufficient to warrant equitable tolling, particu\nlarly in the postconviction context where prisoners have no\nconstitutional right to counsel.” Id., at 336–337 (citing\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nColeman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 756–757 (1991)\n(emphasis added)).\n   The basic rationale for Lawrence’s holding is that the\nmistakes of counsel are constructively attributable to the\nclient, at least in the postconviction context. The Law\nrence Court’s reliance on Coleman is instructive. In Cole\nman, the Court addressed whether attorney error provided\ncause for a procedural default based on a late filing. See\n501 U. S., at 752. Because “[t]here is no constitutional\nright to an attorney in state post-conviction proceedings,”\nthe Court explained, “a petitioner cannot claim constitu\ntionally ineffective assistance of counsel in such proceed\nings.” Ibid. In such circumstances, the Court reasoned,\nthere was “ ‘no inequity in requiring [the petitioner] to\nbear the risk of attorney error that results in a procedural\ndefault.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478,\n488 (1986)); accord, Coleman, 501 U. S., at 753 (“ ‘[C]ause’\nunder the cause and prejudice test must be something\nexternal to the petitioner, something that cannot fairly be\nattributed to him”); ibid. (“Attorney ignorance or inadver\ntence is not ‘cause’ because the attorney is the petitioner’s\nagent when acting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the\nlitigation, and the petitioner must ‘bear the risk of attor\nney error’ ”); id., at 754 (what matters is whether “the\nerror [of counsel] must be seen as an external factor, i.e.,\n‘imputed to the State’ ”); ibid. (“In the absence of a consti\ntutional violation, the petitioner bears the risk in federal\nhabeas for all attorney errors made in the course of the\nrepresentation”); id., at 757 (“Because Coleman had no\nright to counsel to pursue his appeal in state habeas, any\nattorney error that led to the default of Coleman’s claims\nin state court cannot constitute cause to excuse the default\nin federal habeas”). As Lawrence makes clear, the same\nanalysis applies when a petitioner seeks equitable tolling\nbased on attorney error in the postconviction context. See\n549 U. S., at 336–337 (citing Coleman).\n4                   HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n   While Lawrence addressed an allegation of attorney\nmiscalculation, its rationale fully applies to other forms of\nattorney negligence. Instead of miscalculating the filing\ndeadline, for example, an attorney could compute the\ndeadline correctly but forget to file the habeas petition on\ntime, mail the petition to the wrong address, or fail to do\nthe requisite research to determine the applicable dead\nline. In any case, however, counsel’s error would be con\nstructively attributable to the client.\n   Second, the mere fact that a missed deadline involves\n“gross negligence” on the part of counsel does not by itself\nestablish an extraordinary circumstance. As explained\nabove, the principal rationale for disallowing equitable\ntolling based on ordinary attorney miscalculation is that\nthe error of an attorney is constructively attributable to\nthe client and thus is not a circumstance beyond the liti\ngant’s control. See Lawrence, supra, at 336–337; Coleman,\nsupra, at 752–754; see also Powell v. Davis, 415 F. 3d 722,\n727 (CA7 2005); Johnson v. McBride, 381 F. 3d 587, 589–\n590 (CA7 2004); Harris v. Hutchinson, 209 F. 3d 325, 330\n(CA4 2000). That rationale plainly applies regardless\nwhether the attorney error in question involves ordinary\nor gross negligence. See Coleman, 501 U. S., at 754 (“[I]t\nis not the gravity of the attorney’s error that matters, but\nthat it constitutes a violation of petitioner’s right to coun\nsel, so that the error must be seen as an external factor,\ni.e., ‘imputed to the State’ ”); id., at 752 (rejecting the\ncontention that “[t]he late filing was . . . the result of\nattorney error of sufficient magnitude to excuse the de\nfault in federal habeas”).\n   Allowing equitable tolling in cases involving gross\nrather than ordinary attorney negligence would not only\nfail to make sense in light of our prior cases; it would also\nbe impractical in the extreme. Missing the statute of\nlimitations will generally, if not always, amount to negli\ngence, see Lawrence, 549 U. S., at 336, and it has been\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                       Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\naptly said that gross negligence is ordinary negligence\nwith a vituperative epithet added. Therefore, if gross\nnegligence may be enough for equitable tolling, there will\nbe a basis for arguing that tolling is appropriate in almost\nevery counseled case involving a missed deadline. See\nibid. (argument that attorney miscalculation is an ex\ntraordinary circumstance, if credited, “would essentially\nequitably toll limitations periods for every person whose\nattorney missed a deadline”). This would not just impose\na severe burden on the district courts; it would also make\nthe availability of tolling turn on the highly artificial\ndistinction between gross and ordinary negligence. That\nline would be hard to administer, would needlessly con\nsume scarce judicial resources, and would almost certainly\nyield inconsistent and often unsatisfying results. See\nBaldayaque v. United States, 338 F. 3d 145, 155 (CA2\n2003) (Jacobs, J., concurring) (noting that the “distinction\nbetween ordinary and extraordinary attorney malpractice\n. . . is elusive, hard to apply, and counterintuitive”).\n    Finally, it is worth noting that a rule that distinguishes\nbetween ordinary and gross attorney negligence for pur\nposes of the equitable tolling analysis would have demon\nstrably “inequitable” consequences. For example, it is\nhard to see why a habeas petitioner should be effectively\npenalized just because his counsel was negligent rather\nthan grossly negligent, or why the State should be penal\nized just because petitioner’s counsel was grossly negligent\nrather than moderately negligent. Regardless of how one\ncharacterizes counsel’s deficient performance in such\ncases, the petitioner is not personally at fault for the\nuntimely filing, attorney error is a but-for cause of the late\nfiling, and the governmental interest in enforcing the\nstatutory limitations period is the same.\n                           II\n  Although attorney negligence, however styled, does not\n6                   HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nprovide a basis for equitable tolling, the AEDPA statute of\nlimitations may be tolled if the missed deadline results\nfrom attorney misconduct that is not constructively at\ntributable to the petitioner. In this case, petitioner alleges\nfacts that amount to such misconduct. See ante, at 19\n(acknowledging that ordinary attorney negligence does not\nwarrant equitable tolling, but observing that “the facts of\nthis case present far more serious instances of attorney\nmisconduct”). In particular, he alleges that his attorney\nessentially “abandoned” him, as evidenced by counsel’s\nnear-total failure to communicate with petitioner or to\nrespond to petitioner’s many inquiries and requests over a\nperiod of several years. See ante, at 3–4. Petitioner also\nappears to allege that he made reasonable efforts to ter\nminate counsel due to his inadequate representation and\nto proceed pro se, and that such efforts were successfully\nopposed by the State on the perverse ground that peti\ntioner failed to act through appointed counsel. See ante,\nat 4; Brief for Petitioner 50–51 (stating that petitioner\nfiled “two pro se motions in the Florida Supreme Court to\nremove Collins as counsel (one which, if granted, would\nhave allowed [petitioner] to proceed pro se)” (emphasis\ndeleted)).\n   If true, petitioner’s allegations would suffice to establish\nextraordinary circumstances beyond his control. Common\nsense dictates that a litigant cannot be held constructively\nresponsible for the conduct of an attorney who is not oper\nating as his agent in any meaningful sense of that word.\nSee Coleman, supra, at 754 (relying on “well-settled prin\nciples of agency law” to determine whether attorney error\nwas attributable to client); Baldayaque, supra, at 154\n(Jacobs, J., concurring) (“[W]hen an ‘agent acts in a man\nner completely adverse to the principal’s interest,’ the\n‘principal is not charged with [the] agent’s misdeeds’ ”).\nThat is particularly so if the litigant’s reasonable efforts to\nterminate the attorney’s representation have been\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

S. C. §2244(d). The\nCourt concludes that this time limit is also subject to\nequitable tolling, even for attorney errors that are ordinar\nily attributable to the client. And it rejects the Court of\nAppeals’ conclusion that Albert Holland is not entitled to\ntolling, without explaining why the test that court applied\nwas wrong or what rule it should have applied instead. In\nmy view §2244(d) leaves no room for equitable exceptions,\nand Holland could not qualify even if it did.\n                              I\n  The Court is correct, ante, at 13, that we ordinarily\npresume federal limitations periods are subject to equita\nble tolling unless tolling would be inconsistent with the\nstatute. Young v. United States, 535 U. S. 43, 49 (2002).\nThat is especially true of limitations provisions applicable\nto actions that are traditionally governed by equitable\nprinciples—a category that includes habeas proceedings.\nSee id., at 50. If §2244(d) merely created a limitations\nperiod for federal habeas applicants, I agree that applying\nequitable tolling would be appropriate.\n2                       HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   But §2244(d) does much more than that, establishing a\ndetailed scheme regarding the filing deadline that ad\ndresses an array of contingencies. In an ordinary case, the\nclock starts when the state-court judgment becomes final\non direct review. §2244(d)(1)(A).1 But the statute delays\nthe start date—thus effectively tolling the limitations\nperiod—in cases where (1) state action unlawfully im\npeded the prisoner from filing his habeas application, (2)\nthe prisoner asserts a constitutional right newly recog\nnized by this Court and made retroactive to collateral\ncases, or (3) the factual predicate for the prisoner’s claim\ncould not previously have been discovered through due\ndiligence. §2244(d)(1)(B)–(D). It also expressly tolls the\nlimitations period during the pendency of a properly filed\napplication for state collateral relief. §2244(d)(2). Con\ngress, in short, has considered and accounted for specific\ncircumstances that in its view excuse an applicant’s delay.\n   The question, therefore, is not whether §2244(d)’s time\n——————\n    1 Title\n          28 U.

It is fair enough to infer, when a\nstatute of limitations says nothing about equitable tolling,\nthat Congress did not displace the default rule. But when\nCongress has codified that default rule and specified the\ninstances where it applies, we have no warrant to extend\nit to other cases. See United States v. Beggerly, 524 U. S.\n38, 48–49 (1998). Unless the Court believes §2244(d)\ncontains an implicit, across-the-board exception that\nsubsumes (and thus renders unnecessary) §2244(d)(1)(B)–\n(D) and (d)(2), it must rely on the untenable assumption\nthat when Congress enumerated the events that toll the\nlimitations period—with no indication the list is merely\nillustrative—it implicitly authorized courts to add others\nas they see fit. We should assume the opposite: that by\nspecifying situations in which an equitable principle ap\nplies to a specific requirement, Congress has displaced\ncourts’ discretion to develop ad hoc exceptions. Cf. Lon\nchar v. Thomas, 517 U. S. 314, 326–328 (1996).\n   The Court’s responses are unpersuasive. It brushes\naside §2244(d)(1)(B)–(D), apparently because those subdi\nvisions merely delay the start of the limitations period but\ndo not suspend a limitations period already underway.\nAnte, at 15. But the Court does not explain why that\ndistinction makes any difference,2 and we have described a\n——————\n  2 The Court cites several Court of Appeals cases that support its trig\n\ngering-tolling distinction, ante, at 15, but no case of ours that does so.\nClay v.

Lundy,\n455 U. S. 509 (1982), that a federal habeas application\ncannot be filed while state proceedings are pending. But\nthere is no contradiction to resolve unless, in the absence\nof a statutory tolling provision, equitable tolling would not\napply to a state prisoner barred from filing a federal ha\nbeas application while he exhausts his state remedies.\nThe Court offers no reason why it would not, and our\nholding in Young, 535 U. S., at 50–51, that tolling was\njustified by the Government’s inability to pursue a claim\nbecause of the Bankruptcy Code’s automatic stay, 11\nU. S.

But in the\npertinent passage, Young explained only that the inclusion of an\nexpress tolling rule in a different provision regarding a different limita\ntions period, 11 U. S. C. §507(a)(8)(A)(ii) (2000 ed.)—albeit a provision\nwithin the same subparagraph as the provision at issue,\n§507(a)(8)(A)(i)—did not rebut the presumption of equitable tolling.\nSee 535 U. S., at 53. Moreover, Young stressed that §507(a)(8)(A)(ii)\nauthorized tolling in instances where equity would not have allowed it,\nwhich reinforced the presumption in favor of tolling. Ibid. Here, the\nCourt does not suggest that any of §2244(d)’s exceptions go beyond\nwhat equity would have allowed.\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

Florida, 549 U. S. 327, 336 (2007) (quoting Pace v.\nDiGuglielmo, 544 U. S. 408, 418 (2005)). Because the\nattorney is the litigant’s agent, the attorney’s acts (or\nfailures to act) within the scope of the representation are\ntreated as those of his client, see Link v. Wabash R. Co.,\n370 U. S. 626, 633–634, and n. 10 (1962), and thus such\nacts (or failures to act) are necessarily not extraordinary\ncircumstances.\n   To be sure, the rule that an attorney’s acts and over\nsights are attributable to the client is relaxed where the\nclient has a constitutional right to effective assistance of\ncounsel. Where a State is constitutionally obliged to\nprovide an attorney but fails to provide an effective one,\nthe attorney’s failures that fall below the standard set\nforth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984),\nare chargeable to the State, not to the prisoner. See\nMurray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 488 (1986). But where\nthe client has no right to counsel—which in habeas pro\nceedings he does not—the rule holding him responsible for\nhis attorney’s acts applies with full force. See Coleman v.\nThompson, 501 U. S. 722, 752–754 (1991).4 Thus, when a\nstate habeas petitioner’s appeal is filed too late because of\nattorney error, the petitioner is out of luck—no less than if\nhe had proceeded pro se and neglected to file the appeal\nhimself.5\n——————\n  4 The  Court dismisses Coleman as “a case about federalism” and\ntherefore inapposite here. Ante, at 18 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). I fail to see how federalism concerns are not implicated by\nad hoc exceptions to the statute of limitations for attempts to overturn\nstate-court convictions. In any event, Coleman did not invent, but\nmerely applied, the already established principle that an attorney’s acts\nare his client’s. See 501 U. S., at 754.\n  5 That Holland’s counsel was appointed, rather than, like counsel in\n6                      HOLLAND v.

Nor was that an oversight:\nSection 2244(d)(1)(B) expressly allows tolling for state\ncreated impediments that prevent a prisoner from filing\nhis application, but only if the impediment violates the\nConstitution or federal law.\n   If there were any doubt that equitable tolling is un\navailable under §2244(d) to excuse attorney error, we\neliminated it in Lawrence. The petitioner there asserted\nthat his attorney’s miscalculation of the limitations period\nfor federal habeas applications caused him to miss the\nfiling deadline. The attorney’s error stemmed from his\nmistaken belief that—contrary to Circuit precedent (which\nwe approved in Lawrence)—the limitations period is tolled\nduring the pendency of a petition for certiorari from a\nstate postconviction proceeding. 549 U. S., at 336; see also\nBrief for Petitioner in Lawrence v. Florida, O. T. 2006, No.\n05–8820, pp. 31, 36. Assuming arguendo that equitable\ntolling could ever apply to §2244(d), we held that such\nattorney error did not warrant it, especially since the\npetitioner was not constitutionally entitled to counsel.\nLawrence, supra, at 336–337.\n   Faithful application of Lawrence should make short\nwork of Holland’s claim. Although Holland alleges a wide\narray of misconduct by his counsel, Bradley Collins, the\nonly pertinent part appears extremely similar, if not iden\n——————\nColeman, retained, see Brief for Respondent in Coleman v. Thompson,\nO. T. 1990, No. 89–7662, pp. 33–34, 40, is irrelevant. The Sixth\nAmendment right to effective assistance of counsel, we have held,\napplies even to an attorney the defendant himself hires. See Cuyler v.\nSullivan, 446 U. S. 335, 342–345 (1980). The basis for Coleman was\nnot that Coleman had hired his own counsel, but that the State owed\nhim no obligation to provide one. See 501 U. S., at 754. It would be\nutterly perverse, of course, to penalize the State for providing habeas\npetitioners with representation, when the State could avoid equitable\ntolling by providing none at all.\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

The relevant\ntime period extends at most from November 10, 2005—\nwhen the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the denial of\nHolland’s state habeas petition6—to December 15, 2005,\nthe latest date on which §2244(d)’s limitations period\ncould have expired.7 Within that period, Collins could\nhave alerted Holland to the Florida Supreme Court’s\ndecision, and either Collins or Holland himself could have\nfiled a timely federal habeas application. Collins did not\ndo so, but instead filed a petition for certiorari several\nmonths later.\n   Why Collins did not notify Holland or file a timely fed\neral application for him is unclear, but none of the plausi\nble explanations would support equitable tolling. By far\nthe most likely explanation is that Collins made exactly\nthe same mistake as the attorney in Lawrence—i.e., he\nassumed incorrectly that the pendency of a petition for\ncertiorari in this Court seeking review of the denial of\nHolland’s state habeas petition would toll AEDPA’s time\nbar under §2244(d)(2). In December 2002, Collins had\nexplained to Holland by letter that if his state habeas\npetition was denied and this Court denied certiorari in\nthat proceeding, Holland’s claims “will then be ripe for\npresentation in a petition for writ of habeas corpus in\nfederal court.” App. 61 (emphasis added). Holland him\nself interprets that statement as proof that, at that time,\n“Collins was under the belief that [Holland’s] time to file\n\n——————\n  6 The Florida Supreme Court did not issue its mandate, and the limi\n\ntations period did not resume, see Lawrence, 549 U. S., at 331, until\nDecember 1, 2005. But once the Florida Supreme Court issued its\ndecision (with the mandate still to come), Collins could have notified\nHolland, who in turn could have filed a pro se federal application.\n  7 The parties dispute when Holland’s state habeas petition was filed,\n\nand thus when the limitations period expired. Brief for Petitioner 4–5,\nand n. 4; Brief for Respondent 8, 9, n. 7. The discrepancy is immaterial,\nbut I give Holland the benefit of the doubt.\n8                   HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nhis federal habeas petition would continue to be tolled\nuntil this Court denied certiorari” in his state postconvic\ntion proceeding. Pet. for Cert. 12, n. 10. That misunder\nstanding would entirely account for Collins’s conduct—\nfiling a certiorari petition instead of a habeas application,\nand waiting nearly three months to do so. But it would\nalso be insufficient, as Lawrence held it was, to warrant\ntolling.\n   The other conceivable explanations for Collins’s failure\nfare no better. It may be that Collins believed—as he\nexplained to Holland in a January 2006 letter, after Hol\nland had informed him that a certiorari petition in a state\npostconviction proceeding would not stop the clock—that\nthe certiorari petition in Holland’s direct appeal also did\nnot toll the time bar. Consequently, Collins wrote, Hol\nland’s time to file a federal application had expired even\nbefore Collins was appointed. App. 78–79. As the Court\nexplains, ante, at 8, this view too was wrong, but it is no\nmore a basis for equitable tolling than the attorney’s\nmisunderstanding in Lawrence.\n   Or it may be that Collins (despite what he wrote to\nHolland) correctly understood the rule but simply ne\nglected to notify Holland; perhaps he missed the state\ncourt’s ruling in his mail, or perhaps it simply slipped his\nmind. Such an oversight is unfortunate, but it amounts to\n“garden variety” negligence, not a basis for equitable\ntolling. Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S.\n89, 96 (1990). Surely it is no more extraordinary than the\nattorney’s error in Lawrence, which rudimentary research\nand arithmetic would have avoided.\n   The Court insists that Collins’s misconduct goes beyond\ngarden-variety neglect and mine-run miscalculation.\nAnte, at 19. But the only differences it identifies had no\neffect on Holland’s ability to file his federal application on\ntime. The Court highlights Collins’s nonresponsiveness\nwhile Holland’s state postconviction motions were still\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     9\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\npending. Ante, at 19–20. But even taken at face value,\nCollins’s silence prior to November 10, 2005, did not pre\nvent Holland from filing a timely federal application once\nthe Florida courts were finished with his case. The Court\nalso appears to think significant Collins’s correspondence\nwith Holland in January 2006, after the limitations period\nhad elapsed. Ante, at 5–10, 20. But unless Holland can\nestablish that the time-bar should be tolled due to events\nbefore December 15, 2005, any misconduct by Collins after\nthe limitations period elapsed is irrelevant. Even if\nCollins’s conduct before November 10 and after December\n15 was “extraordinary,” Holland has not shown that it\n“stood in his way and prevented timely filing.” Lawrence,\n549 U. S., at 336 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  For his part, Holland now asserts that Collins did not\nmerely forget to keep his client informed, but deliberately\ndeceived him. As the Court of Appeals concluded, how\never, Holland did not allege deception in seeking equitable\ntolling below. See 539 F. 3d 1334, 1339 (CA11 2008) (per\ncuriam).8 In any event, the deception of which he com\nplains consists only of Collins’s assurance early in the\nrepresentation that he would protect Holland’s ability to\nassert his claims in federal court, see App. 55, 62, coupled\nwith Collins’s later failure to do so. That, of course, does\nnot by itself amount to deception, and Holland offers no\nevidence that Collins meant to mislead him. Moreover,\nHolland can hardly claim to have been caught off guard.\nCollins’s failures to respond to Holland’s repeated requests\nfor information before the State Supreme Court ruled gave\nHolland even greater reason to suspect that Collins had\nfallen asleep at the switch. Holland indeed was under no\n——————\n   8 Holland insists that he did allege deception below, see Brief for Peti\n\ntioner 31, n. 29, but cites only a conclusory allegation in an unrelated\nmotion (a motion for appointment of new counsel). See App. 194. His\nreply to the State’s response to the order to show cause, drafted by new\ncounsel, did not allege deception. 1 Record, Doc. 35.\n10                      HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nillusion to the contrary, as his repeated efforts to replace\nCollins reflect.9\n                              B\n  Despite its insistence that Lawrence does not control\nthis case, the Court does not actually hold that Holland is\nentitled to equitable tolling. It concludes only that the\nEleventh Circuit applied the wrong rule and remands the\ncase for a re-do. That would be appropriate if the Court\nidentified a legal error in the Eleventh Circuit’s analysis\nand set forth the proper standard it should have applied.\n  The Court does neither. It rejects as “too rigid,” ante, at\n17, the Eleventh Circuit’s test—which requires, beyond\nordinary attorney negligence, “an allegation and proof of\nbad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, mental impairment\nor so forth on the lawyer’s part,” 539 F. 3d, at 1339. But\nthe Court never explains why that “or so forth” test, which\nexplicitly leaves room for other kinds of egregious attorney\n——————\n  9 The  concurrence argues that Holland’s allegations suffice because\nthey show, if true, that Collins “essentially ‘abandoned’ ” Holland by\nfailing to respond to Holland’s inquiries, and therefore ceased to act as\nHolland’s agent. Ante, at 6 (ALITO, J., concurring in part and concur\nring in judgment). But Collins’s failure to communicate has no bearing\nunless it ended the agency relationship before the relevant window.\nThe concurrence does not explain why it would—does not contend, for\nexample, that Collins’s conduct amounted to disloyalty or renunciation\nof his role, which would terminate Collins’s authority, see Restatement\n(Second) of Agency §§112, 118 (1957). Collins’s alleged nonresponsive\nness did not help Holland’s cause, but it was no more “adverse to\n[Holland’s] interest” or “beyond [Holland’s] control,” ante, at 6, 7 (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted), and thus no more a basis for holding\nHolland harmless from the consequences of his counsel’s conduct, than\nmine-run attorney mistakes, cf. Irwin v. Department of Veterans Af\nfairs, 498 U. S. 89, 96 (1990). The concurrence also relies upon Hol\nland’s requests to replace Collins with new appointed counsel. But if\nthose requests could prevent imputing Collins’s acts to Holland, every\nhabeas applicant who unsuccessfully asks for a new state-provided\nlawyer (but who does not seek to proceed pro se when that request is\ndenied) would not be bound by his attorney’s subsequent acts.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nerror, is insufficiently elastic.\n   Moreover, even if the Eleventh Circuit had adopted an\nentirely inflexible rule, it is simply untrue that, as the\nCourt appears to believe, ante, at 17, all general rules are\nipso facto incompatible with equity. We have rejected that\ncanard before, see, e.g., Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo,\nS. A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U. S. 308, 321–322\n(1999), and we have relied on the existence of general\nrules regarding equitable tolling in particular, see, e.g.,\nYoung, 535 U. S., at 53. As we observed in rejecting\nad hoc equitable restrictions on habeas relief, “the alterna\ntive is to use each equity chancellor’s conscience as a\nmeasure of equity, which alternative would be as arbitrary\nand uncertain as measuring distance by the length of each\nchancellor’s foot.” Lonchar, 517 U. S., at 323.\n   Consistent with its failure to explain the error in the\nEleventh Circuit’s test, the Court offers almost no clue\nabout what test that court should have applied. The Court\nunhelpfully advises the Court of Appeals that its test is\ntoo narrow, with no explanation besides the assertion that\nits test left out cases where tolling might be warranted,\nand no precise indication of what those cases might be.\nAnte, at 18 (“[A]t least sometimes, professional misconduct\nthat fails to meet the Eleventh Circuit’s standard could\nnonetheless amount to egregious behavior and create an\nextraordinary circumstance that warrants equitable toll\ning”). The Court says that “courts can easily find prece\ndents that can guide their judgments,” ibid., citing several\nCourt of Appeals opinions that (in various contexts) permit\ntolling for attorney error—but notably omitting opinions\nthat disallow it, such as the Seventh Circuit’s opinion in\nPowell v. Davis, 415 F. 3d 722, 727 (2005), which would\nhave “guide[d] . . . judgmen[t]” precisely where this court\narrived: “[A]ttorney misconduct, whether labeled negli\ngent, grossly negligent, or willful, is attributable to the\nclient and thus is not a circumstance beyond a petitioner’s\n12                  HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncontrol that might excuse an untimely petition.” Ibid.\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The only thing the Court offers that approaches sub\nstantive instruction is its implicit approval of “fundamen\ntal canons of professional responsibility,” articulated by an\nad hoc group of legal-ethicist amici consisting mainly of\nprofessors of that least analytically rigorous and hence\nmost subjective of law-school subjects, legal ethics. Ante,\nat 20. The Court does not even try to justify importing\ninto equity the “prevailing professional norms” we have\nheld implicit in the right to counsel, Strickland, 466 U. S.,\nat 688. In his habeas action Holland has no right to coun\nsel. I object to this transparent attempt to smuggle Strick\nland into a realm the Sixth Amendment does not reach.\n                               C\n   The Court’s refusal to articulate an intelligible rule\nregarding the only issue actually before us stands in sharp\ncontrast to its insistence on deciding an issue that is not\nbefore us: whether Holland satisfied the second prerequi\nsite for equitable tolling by demonstrating that he pursued\nhis rights diligently, see Pace, 544 U. S., at 418–419. As\nthe Court admits, only the District Court addressed that\nquestion below; the Eleventh Circuit had no need to reach\nit. More importantly, it is not even arguably included\nwithin the question presented, which concerns only\nwhether an attorney’s gross negligence can constitute an\n“extraordinary circumstance” of the kind we have held\nessential for equitable tolling. Pet. for Cert. i. Whether\ntolling is ever available is fairly included in that question,\nbut whether Holland has overcome an additional, inde\npendent hurdle to tolling is not.\n   The Court offers no justification for deciding this dis\ntinct issue. The closest it comes is its observation that the\nState “does not defend” the District Court’s ruling regard\ning diligence. Ante, at 20. But the State had no reason to\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)              13\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ndo so—any more than it had reason to address the merits\nof Holland’s habeas claims. Nor, contrary to the Court’s\nimplication, has the State conceded the issue. The foot\nnote of the State’s brief which the Court cites did just the\nopposite: After observing that only the extraordinary\ncircumstance prong of the equitable-tolling test is at issue,\nthe State (perhaps astutely apprehensive that the Court\nmight ignore that fact) added that “to the extent the Court\nconsiders the matter” of Holland’s diligence, “Respondent\nrelies on the findings of the district court below.” Brief for\nRespondent 38, n. 19. The Court also cites a statement by\nthe State’s counsel at oral argument, Tr. of Oral Arg. 43,\nand Holland’s counsel’s characterization of it as a conces\nsion, id., at 52. But the remark, in context, shows only\nthat the State does not dispute diligence in this Court,\nwhere the only issue is extraordinary circumstances:\n    “Well, that goes to the issue . . . of diligence, of course, \n\n    which is not the issue we’re looking at. We’re looking\n\n    at the extraordinary circumstances, not the dili\n\n    gence. . . .\n\n    “[W]e’ll concede diligence for the moment . . . . ” Id., \n\n    at 43. \n\n   Notwithstanding the Court’s confidence that the District\nCourt was wrong, it is not even clear that Holland acted\nwith the requisite diligence. Although Holland repeatedly\ncontacted Collins and the state courts, there were other\nreasonable measures Holland could have pursued. For\nexample, as we suggested in Pace, supra, at 416—decided\nwhile Holland’s state habeas petition was still pending—\nHolland might have filed a “ ‘protective’ ” federal habeas\napplication and asked the District Court to stay the fed\neral action until his state proceedings had concluded. He\nalso presumably could have checked the court records in\nthe prison’s writ room—from which he eventually learned\nof the state court’s decision, 539 F. 3d, at 1337—on a more\n14                       HOLLAND v. FLORIDA\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nregular basis. And he could have sought permission from\nthe state courts to proceed pro se and thus remove Collins\nfrom the equation.10 This is not to say the District Court\nwas correct to conclude Holland was not diligent; but the\nanswer is not as obvious as the Court would make it seem.\n                         *     *    *\n  The Court’s impulse to intervene when a litigant’s law\nyer has made mistakes is understandable; the temptation\nto tinker with technical rules to achieve what appears a\njust result is often strong, especially when the client faces\n\n——————\n  10 Holland made many pro se filings in state court (which were\n\nstricken because Holland was still represented), and he sought to have\nnew counsel appointed in Collins’s place, but did not seek to proceed\npro se. The Court does not dispute this, nor does Holland. The most he\nasserts is that one of the pro se motions he filed, if granted, would have\nentitled him to proceed pro se, see Brief for Petitioner 50–51—an\nassertion he appears not to have made in the District Court, see 1\nRecord, Doc. 35, at 15. The concurrence equates that assertion with an\nallegation that he actually sought to litigate his case on his own behalf.\nAnte, at 6. It is not the same. The filing Holland refers to, see Brief for\nPetitioner 12, and n. 13, like his earlier filings, requested that Collins\nbe replaced by new counsel. App. 149–163. The motion also asked for a\nhearing pursuant to Nelson v. State, 274 So. 2d 256, 259 (Fla. App.\n1973), to show Collins’s poor performance, App. 149–150, but that did\nnot amount to a request to proceed pro se. Nelson held that a defendant\nfacing trial who seeks to discharge his court-appointed counsel for\nineffectiveness is entitled to a hearing to determine if new counsel is\nrequired. 274 So. 2d, at 259. If the defendant fails to make that\nshowing, but “continues to demand a dismissal of his court appointed\ncounsel,” Nelson explained that “a trial judge may in his discretion\ndischarge counsel and require the defendant to proceed to trial without\nrepresentation by court appointed counsel.” Ibid.; see also Hardwick v.\nState, 521 So. 2d 1071, 1074–1075 (Fla. 1988). There is no reason why\nrequesting that procedure in state habeas proceedings should be\nconstrued as a request to proceed pro se. Holland, unlike a defendant\nstill facing trial, did not need permission to fire Collins, since there was\nno right to representation to waive. Once his request for a new attor\nney was denied, Holland himself could have informed Collins that his\nservices were no longer required.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

But the Constitution does not em\npower federal courts to rewrite, in the name of equity,\nrules that Congress has made. Endowing unelected\njudges with that power is irreconcilable with our system,\nfor it “would literally place the whole rights and property\nof the community under the arbitrary will of the judge,”\narming him with “a despotic and sovereign authority,” 1 J.\nStory, Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence §19, p. 19\n(14th ed. 1918). The danger is doubled when we disregard\nour own precedent, leaving only our own consciences\nto constrain our discretion.
