FLOR-\n\n IDA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTEC-\n\n                 TION ET AL. \n\n\n        CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA\n\n    No. 08–1151. Argued December 2, 2009—Decided June 17, 2010\nFlorida owns in trust for the public the land permanently submerged\n  beneath navigable waters and the foreshore. The mean high-water\n  line is the ordinary boundary between private beachfront, or littoral\n  property, and state-owned land. Littoral owners have, inter alia,\n  rights to have access to the water, to use the water for certain pur\n  poses, to have an unobstructed view of the water, and to receive ac\n  cretions and relictions (collectively, accretions) to the littoral prop\n  erty. An accretion occurs gradually and imperceptibly, while a\n  sudden change is an avulsion. The littoral owner automatically takes\n  title to dry land added to his property by accretion. With avulsion,\n  however, the seaward boundary of littoral property remains what it\n  was: the mean high-water line before the event. Thus, when an avul\n  sion has added new land, the littoral owner has no right to subse\n  quent accretions, because the property abutting the water belongs to\n  the owner of the seabed (ordinarily the State).\n     Florida’s Beach and Shore Preservation Act establishes procedures\n  for depositing sand on eroded beaches (restoration) and maintaining\n  the deposited sand (nourishment). When such a project is under\n  taken, the State entity that holds title to the seabed sets a fixed “ero\n  sion control line” to replace the fluctuating mean high-water line as\n  the boundary between littoral and state property. Once the new line\n  is recorded, the common law ceases to apply. Thereafter, when accre\n  tion moves the mean high-water line seaward, the littoral property\n  remains bounded by the permanent erosion-control line.\n     Respondents the city of Destin and Walton County sought permits\n  to restore 6.9 miles of beach eroded by several hurricanes, adding\n  about 75 feet of dry sand seaward of the mean high-water line (to be\n2        STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v.

Petitioner, a nonprofit corpo\n    ration formed by owners of beachfront property bordering the project\n    (hereinafter Members) brought an unsuccessful administrative chal\n    lenge. Respondent the Florida Department of Environmental Protec\n    tion approved the permits, and this suit followed. The State Court of\n    Appeal concluded that the Department’s order had eliminated the\n    Members’ littoral rights (1) to receive accretions to their property and\n    (2) to have their property’s contact with the water remain intact.\n    Concluding that this would be an unconstitutional taking and would\n    require an additional administrative requirement to be met, it set\n    aside the order, remanded the proceeding, and certified to the Florida\n    Supreme Court the question whether the Act unconstitutionally de\n    prived the Members of littoral rights without just compensation. The\n    State Supreme Court answered “no” and quashed the remand, con\n    cluding that the Members did not own the property supposedly\n    taken. Petitioner sought rehearing on the ground that the Florida\n    Supreme Court’s decision effected a taking of the Members’ littoral\n    rights contrary to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments; rehearing\n    was denied.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1747260\"><a href=\"/opinion/1747260/walton-county-v-stop-beach-renourishment/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1102</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, affirmed.\n    JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to\n  Parts I, IV, and V, concluding that the Florida Supreme Court did not\n  take property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and\n  Fourteenth Amendments. Pp. 24–29.\n    (a) Respondents’ arguments that petitioner does not own the prop\n  erty and that the case is not ripe were not raised in the briefs in op\n  position and thus are deemed waived. Pp. 24–25.\n    (b) There can be no taking unless petitioner can show that, before\n  the Florida Supreme Court’s decision, littoral property owners had\n  rights to future accretions and to contact with the water superior to\n  the State’s right to fill in its submerged land. That showing cannot\n  be made. Two core Florida property-law principles intersect here.\n  First, the State as owner of the submerged land adjacent to littoral\n  property has the right to fill that land, so long as it does not interfere\n  with the rights of the public and of littoral landowners. Second, if an\n  avulsion exposes land seaward of littoral property that had previ\n  ously been submerged, that land belongs to the State even if it inter\n  rupts the littoral owner’s contact with the water. Prior Florida law\n  suggests that there is no exception to this rule when the State causes\n  the avulsion. Thus, Florida law as it stood before the decision below\n  allowed the State to fill in its own seabed, and the resulting sudden\n  exposure of previously submerged land was treated like an avulsion\n  for ownership purposes. The right to accretions was therefore subor\n                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ndinate to the State’s right to fill. Pp. 25–27.\n   (c) The decision below is consistent with these principles. Cf. Lucas\nv. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 1028–1029. It did\nnot abolish the Members’ right to future accretions, but merely held\nthat the right was not implicated by the beach-restoration project be\ncause of the doctrine of avulsion. Relying on dicta in the Florida Su\npreme Court’s Sand Key decision, petitioner contends that the State\ntook the Members’ littoral right to have the boundary always be the\nmean high-water line. But petitioner’s interpretation of that dictum\ncontradicts the clear law governing avulsion. One cannot say the\nFlorida Supreme Court contravened established property law by re\njecting it. Pp. 27–29.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE THOMAS, and\nJUSTICE ALITO, concluded in Parts II and III that if a court declares\nthat what was once an established right of private property no longer\nexists, it has taken that property in violation of the Takings Clause.\nPp. 7–24.\n   (a) Though the classic taking is a transfer of property by eminent\ndomain, the Clause applies to other state actions that achieve the\nsame thing, including those that recharacterize as public property\nwhat was previously private property, see Webb’s Fabulous Pharma\ncies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U. S. 155, 163–165. The Clause is not ad\ndressed to the action of a specific branch or branches. It is concerned\nsimply with the act, not with the governmental actor. This Court’s\nprecedents provide no support for the proposition that takings ef\nfected by the judicial branch are entitled to special treatment, and in\nfact suggest the contrary. See PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins,\n447 U. S. 74, Webb’s Fabulous Pharmacies, supra. Pp. 7–20.\n   (b) For a judicial taking, respondents would add to the normal tak\nings inquiry the requirement that the court’s decision have no “fair\nand substantial basis.” This test is not obviously appropriate, but it\nis no different in this context from the requirement that the property\nowner prove an established property right. Respondents’ additional\narguments—that federal courts lack the knowledge of state law re\nquired to decide whether a state judicial decision purporting to clarify\nproperty rights has instead taken them; that common-law judging\nshould not be deprived of needed flexibility; and that applying the\nTakings Clause to judicial decisions would force lower federal courts\nto review final state-court judgments, in violation of the Rooker-\nFeldman doctrine, see Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413,\n415–416, District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U. S.\n462, 476—are unpersuasive. And petitioner’s proposed “unpredict\nability test”—that a judicial taking consists of a decision that “consti\ntutes a sudden change in state law, unpredictable in terms of rele\n4        STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n           IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                            Syllabus \n\n\n    vant precedents,” Hughes v. Washington, 389 U. S. 290, 296 (Stewart,\n    J., concurring)—is misdirected. What counts is not whether there is\n    precedent for the allegedly confiscatory decision, but whether the\n    property right allegedly taken was well established. Pp. 20–24.\n       JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, agreed that the\n    Florida Supreme Court did not take property without just compensa\n    tion, but concluded that this case does not require the Court to de\n    termine whether, or when, a judicial decision determining property\n    owners’ rights can violate the Takings Clause. If and when future\n    cases show that the usual principles, including constitutional ones\n    that constrain the judiciary like due process, are inadequate to pro\n    tect property owners, then the question whether a judicial decision\n    can effect a taking would be properly presented. Pp. 1–10.\n       JUSTICE BREYER, joined by JUSTICE GINSBURG, agreed that no un\n    constitutional taking occurred here, but concluded that it is unneces\n    sary to decide more than that to resolve this case. Difficult questions\n    of constitutional law—e.g., whether federal courts may review a state\n    court’s decision to determine if it unconstitutionally takes private\n    property without compensation, and what the proper test is for evalu\n    ating whether a state-court property decision enacts an unconstitu\n    tional taking—need not be addressed in order to dispose “of the im\n    mediate case.” Whitehouse v. Illinois Central R. Co., 349 U. S. 366,\n    373. Such questions are better left for another day.

When\nspeaking of the Florida law applicable to this case, we follow the\nFlorida Supreme Court’s terminology.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n280 (1904) (hereinafter Farnham).\n   At the center of this case is the right to accretions and\nrelictions. Accretions are additions of alluvion (sand,\nsediment, or other deposits) to waterfront land; relictions\nare lands once covered by water that become dry when the\nwater recedes. F. Maloney, S. Plager, & F. Baldwin, Wa\nter Law and Administration: The Florida Experience §126,\npp. 385–386 (1968) (hereinafter Maloney); 1 Farnham §69,\nat 320. (For simplicity’s sake, we shall refer to accretions\nand relictions collectively as accretions, and the process\nwhereby they occur as accretion.) In order for an addition\nto dry land to qualify as an accretion, it must have oc\ncurred gradually and imperceptibly—that is, so slowly\nthat one could not see the change occurring, though over\ntime the difference became apparent. Sand Key, supra, at\n936; County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"89097\"><a href=\"/opinion/89097/county-of-st-clair-v-lovingston/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 66–67\n(1874). When, on the other hand, there is a “sudden or\nperceptible loss of or addition to land by the action of the\nwater or a sudden change in the bed of a lake or the course\nof a stream,” the change is called an avulsion. Sand Key,\nsupra, at 936; see also 1 Farnham §69, at 320.\n   In Florida, as at common law, the littoral owner auto\nmatically takes title to dry land added to his property by\naccretion; but formerly submerged land that has become\ndry land by avulsion continues to belong to the owner of\nthe seabed (usually the State). See, e.g., Sand Key, supra,\nat 937; Maloney §126.6, at 392; 2 W. Blackstone, Commen\ntaries on the Laws of England 261–262 (1766) (hereinafter\nBlackstone). Thus, regardless of whether an avulsive\nevent exposes land previously submerged or submerges\nland previously exposed, the boundary between littoral\nproperty and sovereign land does not change; it remains\n(ordinarily) what was the mean high-water line before the\nevent. See Bryant v. Peppe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1154962\"><a href=\"/opinion/1154962/bryant-v-peppe/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 838–839 (Fla.\n1970); J.

Those accretions no longer\nadd to his property, since the property abutting the water\nbelongs not to him but to the State. See Maloney §126.6,\nat 393; 1 Farnham §71a, at 328.\n                              B\n   In 1961, Florida’s Legislature passed the Beach and\nShore Preservation Act, 1961 Fla. Laws ch. 61–246, as\namended, Fla. Stat. §§161.011–161.45 (2007). The Act\nestablishes procedures for “beach restoration and nour\nishment projects,” §161.088, designed to deposit sand on\neroded beaches (restoration) and to maintain the deposited\nsand (nourishment). §§161.021(3), (4). A local govern\nment may apply to the Department of Environmental\nProtection for the funds and the necessary permits to\nrestore a beach, see §§161.101(1), 161.041(1). When the\nproject involves placing fill on the State’s submerged\nlands, authorization is required from the Board of Trus\ntees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund, see\n§253.77(1), which holds title to those lands, §253.12(1).\n   Once a beach restoration “is determined to be under\ntaken,” the Board sets what is called “an erosion control\nline.” §§161.161(3)–(5). It must be set by reference to the\nexisting mean high-water line, though in theory it can be\nlocated seaward or landward of that.2 See §161.161(5).\nMuch of the project work occurs seaward of the erosion\ncontrol line, as sand is dumped on what was once sub\nmerged land. See App. 87–88.

Once the erosion-control line\nis recorded, the common law ceases to increase upland\nproperty by accretion (or decrease it by erosion).\n§161.191(2). Thus, when accretion to the shore moves the\nmean high-water line seaward, the property of beachfront\nlandowners is not extended to that line (as the prior law\nprovided), but remains bounded by the permanent erosion\ncontrol line. Those landowners “continue to be entitled,”\nhowever, “to all common-law riparian rights” other than\nthe right to accretions. §161.201. If the beach erodes back\nlandward of the erosion-control line over a substantial\nportion of the shoreline covered by the project, the Board\nmay, on its own initiative, or must, if asked by the owners\nor lessees of a majority of the property affected, direct the\nagency responsible for maintaining the beach to return the\nbeach to the condition contemplated by the project.

The Takings Clause—“nor shall private\nproperty be taken for public use, without just compensa\ntion,” U. S. Const., Amdt. 5—applies as fully to the taking\nof a landowner’s riparian rights as it does to the taking of\nan estate in land.5 See Yates v.

Robertson, 520 U. S. 83, 89, n. 3 (1997) (per curiam). But\nwhere the state-court decision itself is claimed to constitute a violation\nof federal law, the state court’s refusal to address that claim put for\nward in a petition for rehearing will not bar our review. See Brinker\nhoff-Faris Trust & Sav. Co. v. Hill, 281 U. S. 673, 677–678 (1930).\n  5 We thus need not resolve whether the right of accretion is an ease\n\nment, as petitioner claims, or, as Florida claims, a contingent future\ninterest.\n8     STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v.

Thus, when the\ngovernment uses its own property in such a way that it\ndestroys private property, it has taken that property. See\nUnited States v. Causby, 328 U. S. 256, 261–262 (1946);\nPumpelly v. Green Bay Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88448\"><a href=\"/opinion/88448/pumpelly-v-green-bay-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 177–178 (1872).\nSimilarly, our doctrine of regulatory takings “aims to\nidentify regulatory actions that are functionally equivalent\nto the classic taking.” Lingle v. Chevron U. S. A. Inc., 544\nU. S. 528, 539 (2005). Thus, it is a taking when a state\nregulation forces a property owner to submit to a perma\nnent physical occupation, Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhat\ntan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419, 425–426 (1982), or de\nprives him of all economically beneficial use of his\nproperty, Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505\nU. S. 1003, 1019 (1992). Finally (and here we approach\nthe situation before us), States effect a taking if they\nrecharacterize as public property what was previously\nprivate property. See Webb’s Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v.\nBeckwith, 449 U. S. 155, 163–165 (1980).\n   The Takings Clause (unlike, for instance, the Ex Post\nFacto Clauses, see Art. I, §9, cl. 3; §10, cl. 1) is not ad\ndressed to the action of a specific branch or branches. It is\nconcerned simply with the act, and not with the govern\nmental actor (“nor shall private property be taken” (em\nphasis added)). There is no textual justification for saying\nthat the existence or the scope of a State’s power to expro\npriate private property without just compensation varies\naccording to the branch of government effecting the expro\npriation. Nor does common sense recommend such a\nprinciple. It would be absurd to allow a State to do by\njudicial decree what the Takings Clause forbids it to do by\nlegislative fiat. See Stevens v. Cannon Beach, 510 U. S.\n1207, 1211–1212 (1994) (SCALIA, J., dissenting from denial\nof certiorari).\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Robins, 447 U. S. 74\n(1980), involved a decision of the California Supreme\nCourt overruling one of its prior decisions which had held\nthat the California Constitution’s guarantees of freedom of\nspeech and of the press, and of the right to petition the\ngovernment, did not require the owner of private property\nto accord those rights on his premises. The appellants,\nowners of a shopping center, contended that their private\nproperty rights could not “be denied by invocation of a\nstate constitutional provision or by judicial reconstruction\nof a State’s laws of private property,” id., at 79 (emphasis\nadded). We held that there had been no taking, citing\ncases involving legislative and executive takings, and\napplying standard Takings Clause analysis. See id., at\n82–84. We treated the California Supreme Court’s appli\ncation of the constitutional provisions as a regulation of\nthe use of private property, and evaluated whether that\nregulation violated the property owners’ “right to exclude\nothers,” id., at 80 (internal quotation marks omitted). Our\nopinion addressed only the claimed taking by the constitu\ntional provision. Its failure to speak separately to the\nclaimed taking by “judicial reconstruction of a State’s laws\nof private property” certainly does not suggest that a\ntaking by judicial action cannot occur, and arguably sug\ngests that the same analysis applicable to taking by con\nstitutional provision would apply.\n   Webb’s Fabulous Pharmacies, supra, is even closer in\npoint. There the purchaser of an insolvent corporation\nhad interpleaded the corporation’s creditors, placing the\npurchase price in an interest-bearing account in the regis\ntry of the Circuit Court of Seminole County, to be distrib\nuted in satisfaction of claims approved by a receiver.

We held this to\nbe a taking. We noted that “[t]he usual and general rule is\nthat any interest on an interpleaded and deposited fund\nfollows the principal and is to be allocated to those who\nare ultimately to be the owners of that principal,” 449\nU. S., at 162. “Neither the Florida Legislature by statute,\nnor the Florida courts by judicial decree,” we said, “may\naccomplish the result the county seeks simply by rechar\nacterizing the principal as ‘public money.’ ” Id., at 164.\n   In sum, the Takings Clause bars the State from taking\nprivate property without paying for it, no matter which\nbranch is the instrument of the taking. To be sure, the\nmanner of state action may matter: Condemnation by\neminent domain, for example, is always a taking, while a\nlegislative, executive, or judicial restriction of property use\nmay or may not be, depending on its nature and extent.\nBut the particular state actor is irrelevant. If a legislature\nor a court declares that what was once an established\nright of private property no longer exists, it has taken that\nproperty, no less than if the State had physically appro\npriated it or destroyed its value by regulation. “[A] State,\nby ipse dixit, may not transform private property into\npublic property without compensation.” Ibid.\n                             B\n  JUSTICE BREYER’s concurrence says that we need nei\nther (1) to decide whether the judiciary can ever effect a\ntaking, nor (2) to establish the standard for determining\nwhether it has done so. See post, at 1–2 (opinion concur\nring in part and concurring in judgment). The second part\nof this is surely incompatible with JUSTICE BREYER’s\nconclusion that the “Florida Supreme Court’s decision in\nthis case did not amount to a ‘judicial taking.’ ” Post, at 3.\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

To the contrary,\nwe have often recognized the existence of a constitutional\nright, or established the test for violation of such a right\n(or both), and then gone on to find that the claim at issue\nfails. See, e.g., New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325, 333,\n341–343 (1985) (holding that the Fourth Amendment\napplies to searches and seizures conducted by public\nschool officials, establishing the standard for finding a\nviolation, but concluding that the claim at issue failed);\nStrickland v.

In constitutional-tort suits against public officials,\nwe have found the defendants entitled to immunity only\nafter holding that their action violated the Constitution.\nSee, e.g., Wilson v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 605–606 (1999).\nIndeed, up until last Term, we required federal courts to\naddress the constitutional question before the immunity\nquestion. See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.

S. ___, ___\n(2009) (slip op., at 10).\n   “Assuming without deciding” would be less appropriate\nhere than it was in many of those earlier cases, which\nestablished constitutional rights quite separate from any\nthat had previously been acknowledged. Compared to\nStrickland’s proclamation of a right to effective assistance\nof counsel, for example, proclaiming that a taking can\noccur through judicial action addresses a point of relative\ndetail.\n   In sum, JUSTICE BREYER cannot decide that petitioner’s\nclaim fails without first deciding what a valid claim would\nconsist of. His agreement with Part IV of our opinion\nnecessarily implies agreement with the test for a judicial\ntaking (elaborated in Part II–A) which Part IV applies:\nwhether the state court has “declare[d] that what was\nonce an established right of private property no longer\nexists,” supra, at 10.

Or he could avoid the need to agree with or craft a\nhypothetical standard by denying the right. But embrac\ning a standard while being coy about the right is, well,\nodd; and deciding this case while addressing neither the\nstandard nor the right is quite impossible.\n  JUSTICE BREYER responds that he simply advocates\nresolving this case without establishing “the precise stan\ndard under which a party wins or loses.” Post, at 3 (em\nphasis added). But he relies upon no standard at all,\nprecise or imprecise. He simply pronounces that this is\nnot a judicial taking if there is such a thing as a judicial\ntaking. The cases he cites to support this Queen-of-Hearts\napproach provide no precedent. In each of them the exis\ntence of the right in question was settled,7 and we faced a\nchoice between competing standards that had been applied\nby the courts.8 We simply held that the right in question\nhad not been infringed under any of them. There is no\nestablished right here, and no competing standards.\n\n\n\n——————\n   7 See Smith v. Spisak, 558 U.

That approach is invalid\nfor the reasons we have discussed.\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY says that we need not take what he\nconsiders the bold and risky step of holding that the Tak\nings Clause applies to judicial action, because the Due\nProcess Clause “would likely prevent a State from doing\nby judicial decree what the Takings Clause forbids it to do\nby legislative fiat,” post, at 4–5 (opinion concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). He invokes the Due Process Clause “in both its\nsubstantive and procedural aspects,” post, at 3, not speci\nfying which of his arguments relates to which.\n  The first respect in which JUSTICE KENNEDY thinks the\nDue Process Clause can do the job seems to sound in\nProcedural Due Process. Because, he says, “[c]ourts,\nunlike the executive or legislature, are not designed to\nmake policy decisions” about expropriation, “[t]he Court\nwould be on strong footing in ruling that a judicial deci\nsion that eliminates or substantially changes established\nproperty rights” violates the Due Process Clause. Post, at\n4. Let us be clear what is being proposed here. This Court\nhas held that the separation-of-powers principles that the\nConstitution imposes upon the Federal Government do not\napply against the States. See Dreyer v. Illinois, 187 U. S.\n71, 83–84 (1902). But in order to avoid the bold and risky\nstep of saying that the Takings Clause applies to all gov\nernment takings, JUSTICE KENNEDY would have us use\nProcedural Due Process to impose judicially crafted sepa\nration-of-powers limitations upon the States: courts can\nnot be used to perform the governmental function of ex\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

The asserted reasons for the due-process\nlimitation are that the legislative and executive branches\n“are accountable in their political capacity” for takings,\npost, at 2, and “[c]ourts . . . are not designed to make policy\ndecisions” about takings, post, at 4. These reasons may\nhave a lot to do with sound separation-of-powers principles\nthat ought to govern a democratic society, but they have\nnothing whatever to do with the protection of individual\nrights that is the object of the Due Process Clause.\n   Of course even taking those reasons at face value, it is\nstrange to proclaim a democracy deficit and lack of special\ncompetence for the judicial taking of an individual prop\nerty right, when this Court has had no trouble deciding\nmatters of much greater moment, contrary to congres\nsional desire or the legislated desires of most of the States,\nwith no special competence except the authority we pos\nsess to enforce the Constitution. In any case, our opinion\ndoes not trust judges with the relatively small power\nJUSTICE KENNEDY now objects to. It is we who propose\nsetting aside judicial decisions that take private property;\nit is he who insists that judges cannot be so limited. Un\nder his regime, the citizen whose property has been judi\ncially redefined to belong to the State would presumably\nbe given the Orwellian explanation: “The court did not\ntake your property. Because it is neither politically ac\ncountable nor competent to make such a decision, it can\nnot take property.”\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY’s injection of separation-of-powers\nprinciples into the Due Process Clause would also have the\nironic effect of preventing the assignment of the expropria\ntion function to the branch of government whose proce\ndures are, by far, the most protective of individual rights.\nSo perhaps even this first respect in which JUSTICE KEN-\nNEDY would have the Due Process Clause do the work of\nthe Takings Clause pertains to Substantive, rather than\nProcedural, Due Process. His other arguments undoubt\n16    STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n        IDA DEPT.

Oliver, 510 U. S. 266, 273\n(1994) (four-Justice plurality opinion) (quoting Graham v.\nConnor, 490 U. S. 386, 395 (1989)); see also 510 U. S., at\n281 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment) (“I agree with\nthe plurality that an allegation of arrest without probable\ncause must be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment\nwithout reference to more general considerations of due\nprocess”). The second problem is that we have held for\nmany years (logically or not) that the “liberties” protected\nby Substantive Due Process do not include economic liber\nties. See, e.g., Lincoln Fed. Labor Union v. Northwestern\nIron & Metal Co., 335 U. S. 525, 536 (1949). JUSTICE\nKENNEDY’s language (“If a judicial decision . . . eliminates\nan established property right, the judgment could be set\naside as a deprivation of property without due process of\nlaw,” post, at 3) propels us back to what is referred to\n(usually deprecatingly) as “the Lochner era.” See Lochner\nv. New York, 198 U. S 45, 56–58 (1905). That is a step of\nmuch greater novelty, and much more unpredictable\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

And the third and last problem with using Sub\nstantive Due Process is that either (1) it will not do all\nthat the Takings Clause does, or (2) if it does all that the\nTakings Clause does, it will encounter the same supposed\ndifficulties that JUSTICE KENNEDY finds troublesome.\n   We do not grasp the relevance of JUSTICE KENNEDY’s\nspeculation, post, at 6, that the Framers did not envision\nthe Takings Clause would apply to judicial action. They\ndoubtless did not, since the Constitution was adopted in\nan era when courts had no power to “change” the common\nlaw. See 1 Blackstone 69–70 (1765); Rogers v. Tennessee,\n532 U. S. 451, 472–478 (2001) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\nWhere the text they adopted is clear, however (“nor shall\nprivate property be taken for public use”), what counts is\nnot what they envisioned but what they wrote. Of course\neven after courts, in the 19th century, did assume the\npower to change the common law, it is not true that the\nnew “common-law tradition . . . allows for incremental\nmodifications to property law,” post, at 4, so that “owners\nmay reasonably expect or anticipate courts to make cer\ntain changes in property law,” post, at 6. In the only sense\nin which this could be relevant to what we are discussing,\nthat is an astounding statement. We are talking here\nabout judicial elimination of established private property\nrights.    If that is indeed a “common-law tradition,”\nJUSTICE KENNEDY ought to be able to provide a more solid\nexample for it than the only one he cites, post, at 5, a\nstate-court change (from “noxious” to “harmful”) of the test\nfor determining whether a neighbor’s vegetation is a tor\ntious nuisance. Fancher v. Fagella, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1058608\"><a href=\"/opinion/1058608/fancher-v-fagella/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Va.</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 555–556,\n650 S.

But perhaps he does not\nreally mean that it is a common-law tradition to eliminate\nproperty rights, since he immediately follows his state\nment that “owners may reasonably expect or anticipate\ncourts to make certain changes in property law” with the\n18    STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n        IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                                the Court\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J. \n\n\ncontradictory statement that “courts cannot abandon\nsettled principles,” post, at 6. If no “settled principl[e]” has\nbeen abandoned, it is hard to see how property law could\nhave been “change[d],” rather than merely clarified.\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY has added “two additional practical\nconsiderations that the Court would need to address be\nfore recognizing judicial takings,” post, at 7. One of them\nis simple and simply answered: the assertion that “it is\nunclear what remedy a reviewing court could enter after\nfinding a judicial taking,” post, at 8. JUSTICE KENNEDY\nworries that we may only be able to mandate compensa\ntion. That remedy is even rare for a legislative or execu\ntive taking, and we see no reason why it would be the\nexclusive remedy for a judicial taking. If we were to hold\nthat the Florida Supreme Court had effected an uncom\npensated taking in the present case, we would simply\nreverse the Florida Supreme Court’s judgment that the\nBeach and Shore Preservation Act can be applied to the\nproperty in question. JUSTICE KENNEDY’s other point,\npost, at 7–8—that we will have to decide when the claim of\na judicial taking must be asserted—hardly presents an\nawe-inspiring prospect. These, and all the other “difficul\nties,” post, at 1, “difficult questions,” post, at 5, and “prac\ntical considerations” post, at 7, that JUSTICE KENNEDY\nworries may perhaps stand in the way of recognizing a\njudicial taking, are either nonexistent or insignificant.\n   Finally, we cannot avoid comment upon JUSTICE\nKENNEDY’s donning of the mantle of judicial restraint—\nhis assertion that it is we, and not he, who would empower\nthe courts and encourage their expropriation of private\nproperty. He warns that if judges know that their action\nis covered by the Takings Clause, they will issue “sweep\ning new rule[s] to adjust the rights of property owners,”\ncomfortable in the knowledge that their innovations will\nbe preserved upon payment by the State. Post, at 6. That\nis quite impossible. As we have said, if we were to hold\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                                 the Court\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nthat the Florida Supreme Court had effected an uncom\npensated taking in this case, we would not validate the\ntaking by ordering Florida to pay compensation. We\nwould simply reverse the Florida Supreme Court’s judg\nment that the Beach and Shore Preservation Act can be\napplied to the Members’ property. The power to effect a\ncompensated taking would then reside, where it has al\nways resided, not in the Florida Supreme Court but in the\nFlorida Legislature—which could either provide compen\nsation or acquiesce in the invalidity of the offending fea\ntures of the Act. Cf. Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury,\n489 U. S. 803, 817–818 (1989). The only realistic incentive\nthat subjection to the Takings Clause might provide to any\ncourt would be the incentive to get reversed, which in our\nexperience few judges value.\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY, however, while dismissive of the\nTakings Clause, places no other constraints on judicial\naction. He puts forward some extremely vague applica\ntions of Substantive Due Process, and does not even say\nthat they (whatever they are) will for sure apply. (“It is\nthus natural to read the Due Process Clause as limiting\nthe power of courts to eliminate or change established\nproperty rights,” post, at 3; “courts . . . may not have the\npower to eliminate established property rights by judicial\ndecision,” post, at 4; “the Due Process Clause would likely\nprevent a State from doing by judicial decree what the\nTakings Clause forbids it to do by legislative fiat,” post, at\n4–5 (internal quotation marks omitted); we must defer\napplying the Takings Clause until “[i]f and when future\ncases show that the usual principles, including constitu\ntional principles that constrain the judiciary like due\nprocess, are somehow inadequate to protect property\nowners,” post, at 10.)\n   Moreover, and more importantly, JUSTICE KENNEDY\nplaces no constraints whatever upon this Court. Not only\ndoes his concurrence only think about applying Substan\n20    STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n        IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                                the Court\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J. \n\n\ntive Due Process; but because Substantive Due Process is\nsuch a wonderfully malleable concept, see, e.g., Lawrence\nv. Texas, 539 U. S. 558, 562 (2003) (referring to “liberty of\nthe person both in its spatial and in its more transcendent\ndimensions”), even a firm commitment to apply it would be\na firm commitment to nothing in particular. JUSTICE\nKENNEDY’s desire to substitute Substantive Due Process\nfor the Takings Clause suggests, and the rest of what he\nwrites confirms, that what holds him back from giving the\nTakings Clause its natural meaning is not the intrusive\nness of applying it to judicial action, but the definiteness of\ndoing so; not a concern to preserve the powers of the\nStates’ political branches, but a concern to preserve this\nCourt’s discretion to say that property may be taken, or\nmay not be taken, as in the Court’s view the circumstances\nsuggest. We must not say that we are bound by the Con\nstitution never to sanction judicial elimination of clearly\nestablished property rights. Where the power of this\nCourt is concerned, one must never say never. See, e.g.,\nVieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267, 302–305 (2004) (plurality\nopinion); Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 750–751\n(2004) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment). The great attraction of Substantive Due Proc\ness as a substitute for more specific constitutional guaran\ntees is that it never means never—because it never means\nanything precise.\n                             III\n   Respondents put forward a number of arguments which\ncontradict, to a greater or lesser degree, the principle\ndiscussed above, that the existence of a taking does not\ndepend upon the branch of government that effects it.\nFirst, in a case claiming a judicial taking they would add\nto our normal takings inquiry a requirement that the\ncourt’s decision have no “fair and substantial basis.” This\nis taken from our jurisprudence dealing with the question\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                    21\n\n                                     the Court\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nwhether a state-court decision rests upon adequate and\nindependent state grounds, placing it beyond our jurisdic\ntion to review. See E. Gressman, K. Geller, S. Shapiro, T.\nBishop, & E. Hartnett, Supreme Court Practice, ch. 3.26,\np. 222 (9th ed. 2007). To assure that there is no “evasion”\nof our authority to review federal questions, we insist that\nthe nonfederal ground of decision have “fair support.”\nBroad River Power Co. v. South Carolina ex rel. Daniel,\n281 U. S. 537, 540 (1930); see also Ward v. Board of\nComm’rs of Love Cty., 253 U. S. 17, 22–23 (1920). A test\ndesigned to determine whether there has been an evasion\nis not obviously appropriate for determining whether there\nhas been a taking of property. But if it is to be extended\nthere it must mean (in the present context) that there is a\n“fair and substantial basis” for believing that petitioner’s\nMembers did not have a property right to future accretions\nwhich the Act would take away. This is no different, we\nthink, from our requirement that petitioners’ Members\nmust prove the elimination of an established property\nright.9\n   Next, respondents argue that federal courts lack the\nknowledge of state law required to decide whether a judi\n——————\n   9 JUSTICE BREYER complains that we do not set forth “procedural limi\n\ntations or canons of deference” to restrict federal-court review of state\ncourt property decisions. See post, at 2. (1) To the extent this is true it\nis unsurprising, but (2) fundamentally, it is false: (1) It is true that we\nmake our own determination, without deference to state judges,\nwhether the challenged decision deprives the claimant of an established\nproperty right. That is unsurprising because it is what this Court does\nwhen determining state-court compliance with all constitutional\nimperatives. We do not defer to the judgment of state judges in deter\nmining whether, for example, a state-court decision has deprived a\ndefendant of due process or subjected him to double jeopardy. (2) The\ntest we have adopted, however (deprivation of an established property\nright), contains within itself a considerable degree of deference to state\ncourts. A property right is not established if there is doubt about its\nexistence; and when there is doubt we do not make our own assessment\nbut accept the determination of the state court.\n22    STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n        IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                                the Court\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J. \n\n\ncial decision that purports merely to clarify property\nrights has instead taken them. But federal courts must\noften decide what state property rights exist in nontakings\ncontexts, see, e.g., Board of Regents of State Colleges v.\nRoth, 408 U. S. 564, 577–578 (1972) (Due Process Clause).\nAnd indeed they must decide it to resolve claims that\nlegislative or executive action has effected a taking. For\nexample, a regulation that deprives a property owner of all\neconomically beneficial use of his property is not a taking\nif the restriction “inhere[s] in the title itself, in the restric\ntions that background principles of the State’s law of\nproperty and nuisance already place upon land owner\nship.” Lucas, 505 U. S., at 1029. A constitutional provi\nsion that forbids the uncompensated taking of property is\nquite simply insusceptible of enforcement by federal courts\nunless they have the power to decide what property rights\nexist under state law.\n   Respondents also warn us against depriving common\nlaw judging of needed flexibility. That argument has little\nappeal when directed against the enforcement of a consti\ntutional guarantee adopted in an era when, as we said\nsupra, at 17, courts had no power to “change” the common\nlaw. But in any case, courts have no peculiar need of\nflexibility. It is no more essential that judges be free to\noverrule prior cases that establish property entitlements\nthan that state legislators be free to revise pre-existing\nstatutes that confer property entitlements, or agency\nheads pre-existing regulations that do so. And insofar as\ncourts merely clarify and elaborate property entitlements\nthat were previously unclear, they cannot be said to have\ntaken an established property right.\n   Finally, the city and county argue that applying the\nTakings Clause to judicial decisions would force lower\nfederal courts to review final state-court judgments, in\nviolation of the so-called Rooker-Feldman doctrine. See\nRooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413, 415–416\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           23\n\n                                 the Court\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n(1923); District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman,\n460 U. S. 462, 476 (1983). That does not necessarily fol\nlow. The finality principles that we regularly apply to\ntakings claims, see Williamson County Regional Planning\nComm’n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172,\n186–194 (1985), would require the claimant to appeal a\nclaimed taking by a lower court to the state supreme\ncourt, whence certiorari would come to this Court. If\ncertiorari were denied, the claimant would no more be able\nto launch a lower-court federal suit against the taking\neffected by the state supreme-court opinion than he would\nbe able to launch such a suit against a legislative or execu\ntive taking approved by the state supreme-court opinion;\nthe matter would be res judicata. And where the claimant\nwas not a party to the original suit, he would be able to\nchallenge in federal court the taking effected by the state\nsupreme-court opinion to the same extent that he would\nbe able to challenge in federal court a legislative or execu\ntive taking previously approved by a state supreme-court\nopinion.\n   For its part, petitioner proposes an unpredictability test.\nQuoting Justice Stewart’s concurrence in Hughes v. Wash\nington, 389 U. S. 290, 296 (1967), petitioner argues that a\njudicial taking consists of a decision that “ ‘constitutes a\nsudden change in state law, unpredictable in terms of\nrelevant precedents.’ ” See Brief for Petitioner 17, 34–50.\nThe focus of petitioner’s test is misdirected. What counts\nis not whether there is precedent for the allegedly confis\ncatory decision, but whether the property right allegedly\ntaken was established. A “predictability of change” test\nwould cover both too much and too little. Too much, be\ncause a judicial property decision need not be predictable,\nso long as it does not declare that what had been private\nproperty under established law no longer is. A decision\nthat clarifies property entitlements (or the lack thereof)\nthat were previously unclear might be difficult to predict,\n24     STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n         IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\nbut it does not eliminate established property rights. And\nthe predictability test covers too little, because a judicial\nelimination of established private-property rights that is\nforeshadowed by dicta or even by holdings years in ad\nvance is nonetheless a taking. If, for example, a state\ncourt held in one case, to which the complaining property\nowner was not a party, that it had the power to limit the\nacreage of privately owned real estate to 100 acres, and\nthen, in a second case, applied that principle to declare the\ncomplainant’s 101st acre to be public property, the State\nwould have taken an acre from the complainant even\nthough the decision was predictable.\n                              IV\n  We come at last to petitioner’s takings attack on the\ndecision below. At the outset, respondents raise two pre\nliminary points which need not detain us long. The city\nand the county argue that petitioner cannot state a cause\nof action for a taking because, though the Members own\nprivate property, petitioner itself does not; and that the\nclaim is unripe because petitioner has not sought just\ncompensation. Neither objection appeared in the briefs in\nopposition to the petition for writ of certiorari, and since\nneither is jurisdictional,10 we deem both waived. See this\nCourt’s Rule 15.2; cf. Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U. S.\n808, 815–816 (1985).\n  Petitioner argues that the Florida Supreme Court took\ntwo of the property rights of the Members by declaring\nthat those rights did not exist: the right to accretions, and\nthe right to have littoral property touch the water (which\n——————\n  10 Petitioner meets the two requirements necessary for an association\n\nto assert the Article III standing of its Members. See Food and Com\nmercial Workers v. Brown Group, Inc., 517 U. S. 544, 555–557 (1996).\nAnd the claim here is ripe insofar as Article III standing is concerned,\nsince (accepting petitioner’s version of Florida law as true) petitioner\nhas been deprived of property.\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                  25\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\npetitioner distinguishes from the mere right of access to\nthe water).11 Under petitioner’s theory, because no prior\nFlorida decision had said that the State’s filling of sub\nmerged tidal lands could have the effect of depriving a\nlittoral owner of contact with the water and denying him\nfuture accretions, the Florida Supreme Court’s judgment\nin the present case abolished those two easements to\nwhich littoral property owners had been entitled. This\nputs the burden on the wrong party. There is no taking\nunless petitioner can show that, before the Florida Su\npreme Court’s decision, littoral-property owners had rights\nto future accretions and contact with the water superior to\nthe State’s right to fill in its submerged land. Though\nsome may think the question close, in our view the show\ning cannot be made.\n   Two core principles of Florida property law intersect in\nthis case. First, the State as owner of the submerged land\nadjacent to littoral property has the right to fill that land,\nso long as it does not interfere with the rights of the public\nand the rights of littoral landowners. See Hayes v. Bow\nman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1736390\"><a href=\"/opinion/1736390/hayes-v-bowman/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">795</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 799–800 (Fla. 1957) (right to fill con\nveyed by State to private party); State ex rel.

Petitioner’s arguments on this score are\nsimply versions of two arguments it makes against the Florida Su\npreme Court’s opinion: that the Department has replaced the Members’\nlittoral property rights with versions that are inferior because statu\ntory; and that the Members previously had the right to have their\nproperty contact the water. We reject both, infra, at 28–29, and n. 12.\nSecond, petitioner attempts to raise a challenge to the Act as a depriva\ntion of property without due process. Petitioner did not raise this\nchallenge before the Florida Supreme Court, and only obliquely raised\nit in the petition for certiorari. We therefore do not reach it. See\nAdams, 520 U. S., at 86–87.\n26    STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n        IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n(same). Second, as we described supra, at 3–4, if an avul\nsion exposes land seaward of littoral property that had\npreviously been submerged, that land belongs to the State\neven if it interrupts the littoral owner’s contact with the\nwater. See Bryant, 238 So. 2d, at 837, 838–839. The issue\nhere is whether there is an exception to this rule when the\nState is the cause of the avulsion. Prior law suggests\nthere is not. In Martin v. Busch, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fla.</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1927), the Florida Supreme Court held that when the\nState drained water from a lakebed belonging to the State,\ncausing land that was formerly below the mean high\nwater line to become dry land, that land continued to\nbelong to the State. Id., at 574, 112 So., at 287; see also\nBryant, supra, at 838–839 (analogizing the situation in\nMartin to an avulsion). “ ‘The riparian rights doctrine of\naccretion and reliction,’ ” the Florida Supreme Court later\nexplained, “ ‘does not apply to such lands.’ ” Bryant, supra,\nat 839 (quoting Martin, supra, at 578, 112 So., at 288\n(Brown, J., concurring)). This is not surprising, as there can\nbe no accretions to land that no longer abuts the water.\n   Thus, Florida law as it stood before the decision below\nallowed the State to fill in its own seabed, and the result\ning sudden exposure of previously submerged land was\ntreated like an avulsion for purposes of ownership. The\nright to accretions was therefore subordinate to the State’s\nright to fill. Thiesen v. Gulf, Florida & Alabama R. Co.\nsuggests the same result. That case involved a claim by a\nriparian landowner that a railroad’s state-authorized\nfilling of submerged land and construction of tracks upon\nit interfered with the riparian landowners’ rights to access\nand to wharf out to a shipping channel. The Florida Su\npreme Court determined that the claimed right to wharf\nout did not exist in Florida, and that therefore only the\nright of access was compensable. 75 Fla., at 58–65, 78 So.,\nat 501–503. Significantly, although the court recognized\nthat the riparian-property owners had rights to accretion,\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           27\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsee id., at 64–65, 78 So., at 502–503, the only rights it\neven suggested would be infringed by the railroad were\nthe right of access (which the plaintiff had claimed) and\nthe rights of view and use of the water (which it seems the\nplaintiff had not claimed), see id., at 58–59, 78, 78 So., at\n501, 507.\n  The Florida Supreme Court decision before us is consis\ntent with these background principles of state property\nlaw. Cf. Lucas, 505 U. S., at 1028–1029; Scranton v.\nWheeler, 179 U. S. 141, 163 (1900). It did not abolish the\nMembers’ right to future accretions, but merely held that\nthe right was not implicated by the beach-restoration\nproject, because the doctrine of avulsion applied. See 998\nSo. 2d, at 1117, 1120–1121. The Florida Supreme Court’s\nopinion describes beach restoration as the reclamation by\nthe State of the public’s land, just as Martin had described\nthe lake drainage in that case. Although the opinion does\nnot cite Martin and is not always clear on this point, it\nsuffices that its characterization of the littoral right to\naccretion is consistent with Martin and the other relevant\nprinciples of Florida law we have discussed.\n  What we have said shows that the rule of Sand Key,\nwhich petitioner repeatedly invokes, is inapposite. There\nthe Florida Supreme Court held that an artificial accretion\ndoes not change the right of a littoral-property owner to\nclaim the accreted land as his own (as long as the owner\ndid not cause the accretion himself). 512 So. 2d, at 937–\n938. The reason Martin did not apply, Sand Key ex\nplained, is that the drainage that had occurred in Martin\ndid not lower the water level by “ ‘imperceptible degrees,’ ”\nand so did not qualify as an accretion. 512 So. 2d, at 940–\n941.\n  The result under Florida law may seem counter\nintuitive. After all, the Members’ property has been de\nprived of its character (and value) as oceanfront property\nby the State’s artificial creation of an avulsion. Perhaps\n28    STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n        IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nstate-created avulsions ought to be treated differently\nfrom other avulsions insofar as the property right to accre\ntion is concerned. But nothing in prior Florida law makes\nsuch a distinction, and Martin suggests, if it does not\nindeed hold, the contrary. Even if there might be different\ninterpretations of Martin and other Florida property-law\ncases that would prevent this arguably odd result, we are\nnot free to adopt them. The Takings Clause only protects\nproperty rights as they are established under state law,\nnot as they might have been established or ought to have\nbeen established. We cannot say that the Florida Su\npreme Court’s decision eliminated a right of accretion\nestablished under Florida law.\n   Petitioner also contends that the State took the Mem\nbers’ littoral right to have their property continually main\ntain contact with the water. To be clear, petitioner does\nnot allege that the State relocated the property line, as\nwould have happened if the erosion-control line were\nlandward of the old mean high-water line (instead of\nidentical to it). Petitioner argues instead that the Mem\nbers have a separate right for the boundary of their prop\nerty to be always the mean high-water line. Petitioner\npoints to dicta in Sand Key that refers to “the right to have\nthe property’s contact with the water remain intact,” 512\nSo. 2d, at 936. Even there, the right was included in the\ndefinition of the right to access, ibid., which is consistent\nwith the Florida Supreme Court’s later description that\n“there is no independent right of contact with the water”\nbut it “exists to preserve the upland owner’s core littoral\nright of access to the water,” 998 So. 2d, at 1119. Peti\ntioner’s expansive interpretation of the dictum in Sand\nKey would cause it to contradict the clear Florida law\ngoverning avulsion.

As JUSTICE BREYER observes, however,\nthis case does not require the Court to determine whether,\nor when, a judicial decision determining the rights of\nproperty owners can violate the Takings Clause of the\nFifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. This\nseparate opinion notes certain difficulties that should be\nconsidered before accepting the theory that a judicial\ndecision that eliminates an “established property right,”\nante, at 21, constitutes a violation of the Takings Clause.\n   The Takings Clause is an essential part of the constitu\ntional structure, for it protects private property from\nexpropriation without just compensation; and the right to\nown and hold property is necessary to the exercise and\npreservation of freedom. The right to retain property\nwithout the fact or even the threat of that sort of expro\npriation is, of course, applicable to the States under the\nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Chi\ncago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226, 239 (1897).\n2     STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n        IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                   Opinion of KENNEDY, J. \n\n\n   The right of the property owner is subject, however, to\nthe rule that the government does have power to take\nproperty for a public use, provided that it pays just com\npensation.     See First English Evangelical Lutheran\nChurch of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S.\n304, 314–315 (1987). This is a vast governmental power.\nAnd typically, legislative bodies grant substantial discre\ntion to executive officers to decide what property can be\ntaken for authorized projects and uses. As a result, if an\nauthorized executive agency or official decides that Black\nacre is the right place for a fire station or Greenacre is the\nbest spot for a freeway interchange, then the weight and\nauthority of the State are used to take the property, even\nagainst the wishes of the owner, who must be satisfied\nwith just compensation.\n   In the exercise of their duty to protect the fisc, both the\nlegislative and executive branches monitor, or should\nmonitor, the exercise of this substantial power. Those\nbranches are accountable in their political capacity for the\nproper discharge of this obligation.\n   To enable officials to better exercise this great power in\na responsible way, some States allow their officials to take\na second look after property has been condemned and a\njury returns a verdict setting the amount of just compen\nsation. See, e.g., Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. §1268.510\n(2007).    If the condemning authority, usually acting\nthrough the executive, deems the compensation too high to\npay for the project, it can decide not to take the property\nat all. The landowner is reimbursed for certain costs and\nexpenses of litigation and the property remains in his or\nher hands. See, e.g., §1268.610(a).\n   This is just one aspect of the exercise of the power to\nselect what property to condemn and the responsibility to\nensure that the taking makes financial sense from the\nState’s point of view. And, as a matter of custom and\npractice, these are matters for the political branches—the\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nlegislature and the executive—not the courts. See First\nEnglish, supra, at 321 (“[T]he decision to exercise the\npower of eminent domain is a legislative function”).\n   If a judicial decision, as opposed to an act of the execu\ntive or the legislature, eliminates an established property\nright, the judgment could be set aside as a deprivation of\nproperty without due process of law. The Due Process\nClause, in both its substantive and procedural aspects, is a\ncentral limitation upon the exercise of judicial power. And\nthis Court has long recognized that property regulations\ncan be invalidated under the Due Process Clause. See,\ne.g., Lingle v. Chevron U. S. A. Inc., 544 U. S. 528, 542\n(2005); Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369 U. S. 590, 591, 592–\n593 (1962); Demorest v. City Bank Farmers Trust Co., 321\nU. S. 36, 42–43 (1944); Broad River Power Co. v. South\nCarolina ex rel. Daniel, 281 U. S. 537, 539, 540–541\n(1930); Washington ex rel. Seattle Title Trust Co. v.\nRoberge, 278 U. S. 116, 121 (1928); Nectow v. Cambridge,\n277 U. S. 183, 188 (1928); Village of Euclid v. Ambler\nRealty Co., 272 U. S. 365, 395 (1926); see also Pennsyl\nvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 413 (1922) (there\nmust be limits on government’s ability to diminish prop\nerty values by regulation “or the contract and due process\nclauses are gone”). It is thus natural to read the Due\nProcess Clause as limiting the power of courts to eliminate\nor change established property rights.\n   The Takings Clause also protects property rights, and it\n“operates as a conditional limitation, permitting the gov\nernment to do what it wants so long as it pays the charge.”\nEastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U. S. 498, 545 (1998)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in\npart). Unlike the Due Process Clause, therefore, the\nTakings Clause implicitly recognizes a governmental\npower while placing limits upon that power. Thus, if the\nCourt were to hold that a judicial taking exists, it would\npresuppose that a judicial decision eliminating established\n4     STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n        IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                   Opinion of KENNEDY, J. \n\n\nproperty rights is “otherwise constitutional” so long as the\nState compensates the aggrieved property owners. Ibid.\nThere is no clear authority for this proposition.\n   When courts act without direction from the executive or\nlegislature, they may not have the power to eliminate\nestablished property rights by judicial decision. “Given\nthat the constitutionality” of a judicial decision altering\nproperty rights “appears to turn on the legitimacy” of\nwhether the court’s judgment eliminates or changes estab\nlished property rights “rather than on the availability of\ncompensation, . . . the more appropriate constitutional\nanalysis arises under general due process principles\nrather than under the Takings Clause.” Ibid. Courts,\nunlike the executive or legislature, are not designed to\nmake policy decisions about “the need for, and likely effec\ntiveness of, regulatory actions.” Lingle, supra, at 545.\nState courts generally operate under a common-law tradi\ntion that allows for incremental modifications to property\nlaw, but “this tradition cannot justify a carte blanch judi\ncial authority to change property definitions wholly free of\nconstitutional limitations.” Walston, The Constitution and\nProperty: Due Process, Regulatory Takings, and Judicial\nTakings, 2001 Utah L. Rev. 379, 435.\n   The Court would be on strong footing in ruling that a\njudicial decision that eliminates or substantially changes\nestablished property rights, which are a legitimate expec\ntation of the owner, is “arbitrary or irrational” under the\nDue Process Clause. Lingle, 544 U. S., at 542; see id., at\n548–549 (KENNEDY, J., concurring); see also Perry v.\nSindermann, 408 U. S. 593, 601 (1972) (“ ‘[P]roperty’ ”\ninterests protected by the Due Process Clauses are those\n“that are secured by ‘existing rules or understandings’ ”\n(quoting Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408\nU. S. 564, 577 (1972))). Thus, without a judicial takings\ndoctrine, the Due Process Clause would likely prevent a\nState from doing “by judicial decree what the Takings\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nClause forbids it to do by legislative fiat.” Ante, at 8. The\nobjection that a due process claim might involve close\nquestions concerning whether a judicial decree extends\nbeyond what owners might have expected is not a sound\nargument; for the same close questions would arise with\nrespect to whether a judicial decision is a taking. See\nApfel, supra, at 541 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.) (“Cases\nattempting to decide when a regulation becomes a taking\nare among the most litigated and perplexing in current\nlaw”); Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438\nU. S. 104, 123 (1978) (“The question of what constitutes a\n‘taking’ for purposes of the Fifth Amendment has proved\nto be a problem of considerable difficulty”).\n   To announce that courts too can effect a taking when\nthey decide cases involving property rights, would raise\ncertain difficult questions. Since this case does not require\nthose questions to be addressed, in my respectful view, the\nCourt should not reach beyond the necessities of the case\nto announce a sweeping rule that court decisions can be\ntakings, as that phrase is used in the Takings Clause. The\nevident reason for recognizing a judicial takings doctrine\nwould be to constrain the power of the judicial branch. Of\ncourse, the judiciary must respect private ownership. But\nwere this Court to say that judicial decisions become\ntakings when they overreach, this might give more power\nto courts, not less.\n   Consider the instance of litigation between two property\nowners to determine which one bears the liability and\ncosts when a tree that stands on one property extends its\nroots in a way that damages adjacent property. See, e.g.,\nFancher v. Fagella, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1058608\"><a href=\"/opinion/1058608/fancher-v-fagella/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Va.</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 650 S. E. 2d 519 (2007).\nIf a court deems that, in light of increasing urbanization,\nthe former rule for allocation of these costs should be\nchanged, thus shifting the rights of the owners, it may\nwell increase the value of one property and decrease the\nvalue of the other. This might be the type of incremental\n6     STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n        IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                   Opinion of KENNEDY, J. \n\n\nmodification under state common law that does not violate\ndue process, as owners may reasonably expect or antici\npate courts to make certain changes in property law. The\nusual due process constraint is that courts cannot abandon\nsettled principles. See, e.g., Rogers v. Tennessee, 532 U. S.\n451, 457 (2001) (citing Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U. S.\n347, 354 (1964)); Apfel, 524 U. S., at 548–549 (opinion of\nKENNEDY, J.); see also Perry, supra, at 601; Roth, supra,\nat 577.\n   But if the state court were deemed to be exercising the\npower to take property, that constraint would be removed.\nBecause the State would be bound to pay owners for tak\nings caused by a judicial decision, it is conceivable that\nsome judges might decide that enacting a sweeping new\nrule to adjust the rights of property owners in the context\nof changing social needs is a good idea. Knowing that the\nresulting ruling would be a taking, the courts could go\nahead with their project, free from constraints that would\notherwise confine their power. The resulting judgment as\nbetween the property owners likely could not be set aside\nby some later enactment. See Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm,\nInc., 514 U. S. 211, 217 (1995) (leaving open whether\nlegislation reopening final judgments violates Due Process\nClause). And if the litigation were a class action to decide,\nfor instance, whether there are public rights of access that\ndiminish the rights of private ownership, a State might\nfind itself obligated to pay a substantial judgment for the\njudicial ruling. Even if the legislature were to subse\nquently rescind the judicial decision by statute, the State\nwould still have to pay just compensation for the tempo\nrary taking that occurred from the time of the judicial\ndecision to the time of the statutory fix. See First English,\n482 U. S., at 321.\n   The idea, then, that a judicial takings doctrine would\nconstrain judges might just well have the opposite effect.\nIt would give judges new power and new assurance that\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nchanges in property rights that are beneficial, or thought\nto be so, are fair and proper because just compensation\nwill be paid. The judiciary historically has not had the\nright or responsibility to say what property should or\nshould not be taken.\n   Indeed, it is unclear whether the Takings Clause was\nunderstood, as a historical matter, to apply to judicial\ndecisions. The Framers most likely viewed this Clause as\napplying only to physical appropriation pursuant to the\npower of eminent domain. See Lucas v. South Carolina\nCoastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 1028, n. 15 (1992). And it\nappears these physical appropriations were traditionally\nmade by legislatures. See 3 J. Story, Commentaries on\nthe Constitution of the United States §1784, p. 661 (1833).\nCourts, on the other hand, lacked the power of eminent\ndomain. See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 135 (W.\nLewis ed. 1897). The Court’s Takings Clause jurispru\ndence has expanded beyond the Framers’ understanding,\nas it now applies to certain regulations that are not physi\ncal appropriations. See Lucas, supra, at 1014 (citing\nMahon, 260 U. S. 393). But the Court should consider\nwith care the decision to extend the Takings Clause in\na manner that might be inconsistent with historical\npractice.\n   There are two additional practical considerations that\nthe Court would need to address before recognizing judi\ncial takings. First, it may be unclear in certain situations\nhow a party should properly raise a judicial takings claim.\n“[I]t is important to separate out two judicial actions—the\ndecision to change current property rules in a way that\nwould constitute a taking, and the decision to require\ncompensation.”      Thompson, Judicial Takings, 76 Va.\nL. Rev. 1449, 1515 (1990). In some contexts, these issues\ncould arise separately. For instance, assume that a state\ncourt opinion explicitly holds that it is changing state\nproperty law, or that it asserts that is not changing the\n8     STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n        IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                   Opinion of KENNEDY, J. \n\n\nlaw but there is no “fair or substantial basis” for this\nstatement. Broad River, 281 U. S., at 540. (Most of these\ncases may arise in the latter posture, like inverse condem\nnation claims where the State says it is not taking prop\nerty and pays no compensation.) Call this Case A. The\nonly issue in Case A was determining the substance of\nstate property law. It is doubtful that parties would raise\na judicial takings claim on appeal, or in a petition for a\nwrit of certiorari, in Case A, as the issue would not have\nbeen litigated below. Rather, the party may file a sepa\nrate lawsuit—Case B—arguing that a taking occurred in\nlight of the change in property law made by Case A. After\nall, until the state court in Case A changes the law, the\nparty will not know if his or her property rights will have\nbeen eliminated. So res judicata probably would not bar\nthe party from litigating the takings issue in Case B.\n   Second, it is unclear what remedy a reviewing court\ncould enter after finding a judicial taking. It appears\nunder our precedents that a party who suffers a taking is\nonly entitled to damages, not equitable relief: The Court\nhas said that “[e]quitable relief is not available to enjoin\nan alleged taking of private property for a public use . . .\nwhen a suit for compensation can be brought against the\nsovereign subsequent to the taking,” Ruckelshaus v. Mon\nsanto Co., 467 U. S. 986, 1016 (1984), and the Court sub\nsequently held that the Takings Clause requires the avail\nability of a suit for compensation against the States, First\nEnglish, supra, at 321–322. It makes perfect sense that\nthe remedy for a Takings Clause violation is only dam\nages, as the Clause “does not proscribe the taking of prop\nerty; it proscribes taking without just compensation.”\nWilliamson County Regional Planning Comm’n v. Hamil\nton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172, 194 (1985).\n   It is thus questionable whether reviewing courts could\ninvalidate judicial decisions deemed to be judicial takings;\nthey may only be able to order just compensation. In the\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nposture discussed above where Case A changes the law\nand Case B addresses whether that change is a taking, it\nis not clear how the Court, in Case B, could invalidate the\nholding of Case A. If a single case were to properly ad\ndress both a state court’s change in the law and whether\nthe change was a taking, the Court might be able to give\nthe state court a choice on how to proceed if there were a\njudicial taking. The Court might be able to remand and\nlet the state court determine whether it wants to insist on\nchanging its property law and paying just compensation or\nto rescind its holding that changed the law. Cf. First\nEnglish, 482 U. S., at 321 (“Once a court determines that a\ntaking has occurred, the government retains the whole\nrange of options already available—amendment of the\nregulation, withdrawal of the invalidated regulation, or\nexercise of eminent domain”). But that decision would\nrest with the state court, not this Court; so the state court\ncould still force the State to pay just compensation. And\neven if the state court decided to rescind its decision that\nchanged the law, a temporary taking would have occurred\nin the interim. See ibid.\n   These difficult issues are some of the reasons why the\nCourt should not reach beyond the necessities of the case\nto recognize a judicial takings doctrine. It is not wise,\nfrom an institutional standpoint, to reach out and decide\nquestions that have not been discussed at much length by\ncourts and commentators. This Court’s dicta in William\nson County, supra, at 194–197, regarding when regulatory\ntakings claims become ripe, explains why federal courts\nhave not been able to provide much analysis on the issue\nof judicial takings. See San Remo Hotel, L. P. v. City and\nCounty of San Francisco, 545 U. S. 323, 351 (2005)\n(Rehnquist, C.

If and when\nfuture cases show that the usual principles, including\nconstitutional principles that constrain the judiciary like\ndue process, are somehow inadequate to protect property\nowners, then the question whether a judicial decision can\neffect a taking would be properly presented.

FLOR- \n\n        IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                    Opinion of BREYER, J. \n\n\na state-court property decision enacts an unconstitutional\ntaking. Ante, at 21. The plurality further concludes that a\nstate-court decision violates the Takings Clause not when\nthe decision is “unpredictab[le]” on the basis of prior law,\nbut rather when the decision takes private property rights\nthat are “established.” Ante, at 23–24. And finally, it\nconcludes that all those affected by a state-court property\nlaw decision can raise a takings claim in federal court, but\nfor the losing party in the initial state-court proceeding,\nwho can only raise her claim (possibly for the first time) in\na petition for a writ of certiorari here. Ante, at 23.\n   I do not claim that all of these conclusions are unsound.\nI do not know. But I do know that, if we were to express\nour views on these questions, we would invite a host of\nfederal takings claims without the mature consideration of\npotential procedural or substantive legal principles that\nmight limit federal interference in matters that are pri\nmarily the subject of state law. Property owners litigate\nmany thousands of cases involving state property law in\nstate courts each year. Each state-court property decision\nmay further affect numerous nonparty property owners as\nwell. Losing parties in many state-court cases may well\nbelieve that erroneous judicial decisions have deprived\nthem of property rights they previously held and may\nconsequently bring federal takings claims. And a glance\nat Part IV makes clear that such cases can involve state\nproperty law issues of considerable complexity. Hence, the\napproach the plurality would take today threatens to open\nthe federal court doors to constitutional review of many,\nperhaps large numbers of, state-law cases in an area of\nlaw familiar to state, but not federal, judges. And the\nfailure of that approach to set forth procedural limitations\nor canons of deference would create the distinct possibility\nthat federal judges would play a major role in the shaping\nof a matter of significant state interest—state property\nlaw.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

But, of course, courts frequently find\nit possible to resolve cases—even those raising constitu\ntional questions—without specifying the precise standard\nunder which a party wins or loses. See, e.g., Smith v.\nSpisak, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 16) (“With or\nwithout such deference, our conclusion is the same”);\nQuilloin v. Walcott, 434 U.

S. 152, 156 (1964) (per curiam)\n(finding evidence sufficient to support a verdict “under any\nstandard”). That is simply what I would do here.\n   In the past, Members of this Court have warned us that,\nwhen faced with difficult constitutional questions, we\nshould “confine ourselves to deciding only what is neces\nsary to the disposition of the immediate case.” Whitehouse\nv. Illinois Central R. Co., 349 U. S. 366, 373 (1955); see\nalso Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Assn.,\n485 U. S. 439, 445 (1988) (“A fundamental and longstand\ning principle of judicial restraint requires that courts\navoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the\nnecessity of deciding them”); Ashwander v.

It is not the habit\nof the Court to decide questions of a constitutional nature\nunless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case”\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). I heed\nthis advice here. There is no need now to decide more\nthan what the Court decides in Parts IV and V, namely,\nthat the Florida Supreme Court’s decision in this case did\nnot amount to a “judicial taking.”\n</pre>", "id": 148798, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2010/06/17/Stop_the_Beach_Renourishment_Inc._v._Florida_Dept._of_Environmental_Protection.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2009                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued December 2, 2009—Decided June 17, 2010\nFlorida owns in trust for the public the land permanently submerged\n  beneath navigable waters and the foreshore. The mean high-water\n  line is the ordinary boundary between private beachfront, or littoral\n  property, and state-owned land. Littoral owners have, inter alia,\n  rights to have access to the water, to use the water for certain pur\n  poses, to have an unobstructed view of the water, and to receive ac\n  cretions and relictions (collectively, accretions) to the littoral prop\n  erty. An accretion occurs gradually and imperceptibly, while a\n  sudden change is an avulsion. The littoral owner automatically takes\n  title to dry land added to his property by accretion. With avulsion,\n  however, the seaward boundary of littoral property remains what it\n  was: the mean high-water line before the event. Thus, when an avul\n  sion has added new land, the littoral owner has no right to subse\n  quent accretions, because the property abutting the water belongs to\n  the owner of the seabed (ordinarily the State).\n     Florida’s Beach and Shore Preservation Act establishes procedures\n  for depositing sand on eroded beaches (restoration) and maintaining\n  the deposited sand (nourishment). When such a project is under\n  taken, the State entity that holds title to the seabed sets a fixed “ero\n  sion control line” to replace the fluctuating mean high-water line as\n  the boundary between littoral and state property. Once the new line\n  is recorded, the common law ceases to apply. Thereafter, when accre\n  tion moves the mean high-water line seaward, the littoral property\n  remains bounded by the permanent erosion-control line.\n     Respondents the city of Destin and Walton County sought permits\n  to restore 6.9 miles of beach eroded by several hurricanes, adding\n  about 75 feet of dry sand seaward of the mean high-water line (to be\n2        STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n           IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                            Syllabus \n\n\n    denominated the erosion-control line). Petitioner, a nonprofit corpo\n    ration formed by owners of beachfront property bordering the project\n    (hereinafter Members) brought an unsuccessful administrative chal\n    lenge. Respondent the Florida Department of Environmental Protec\n    tion approved the permits, and this suit followed. The State Court of\n    Appeal concluded that the Department’s order had eliminated the\n    Members’ littoral rights (1) to receive accretions to their property and\n    (2) to have their property’s contact with the water remain intact.\n    Concluding that this would be an unconstitutional taking and would\n    require an additional administrative requirement to be met, it set\n    aside the order, remanded the proceeding, and certified to the Florida\n    Supreme Court the question whether the Act unconstitutionally de\n    prived the Members of littoral rights without just compensation. The\n    State Supreme Court answered “no” and quashed the remand, con\n    cluding that the Members did not own the property supposedly\n    taken. Petitioner sought rehearing on the ground that the Florida\n    Supreme Court’s decision effected a taking of the Members’ littoral\n    rights contrary to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments; rehearing\n    was denied.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n998 So. 2d 1102, affirmed.\n    JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to\n  Parts I, IV, and V, concluding that the Florida Supreme Court did not\n  take property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and\n  Fourteenth Amendments. Pp. 24–29.\n    (a) Respondents’ arguments that petitioner does not own the prop\n  erty and that the case is not ripe were not raised in the briefs in op\n  position and thus are deemed waived. Pp. 24–25.\n    (b) There can be no taking unless petitioner can show that, before\n  the Florida Supreme Court’s decision, littoral property owners had\n  rights to future accretions and to contact with the water superior to\n  the State’s right to fill in its submerged land. That showing cannot\n  be made. Two core Florida property-law principles intersect here.\n  First, the State as owner of the submerged land adjacent to littoral\n  property has the right to fill that land, so long as it does not interfere\n  with the rights of the public and of littoral landowners. Second, if an\n  avulsion exposes land seaward of littoral property that had previ\n  ously been submerged, that land belongs to the State even if it inter\n  rupts the littoral owner’s contact with the water. Prior Florida law\n  suggests that there is no exception to this rule when the State causes\n  the avulsion. Thus, Florida law as it stood before the decision below\n  allowed the State to fill in its own seabed, and the resulting sudden\n  exposure of previously submerged land was treated like an avulsion\n  for ownership purposes. The right to accretions was therefore subor\n                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ndinate to the State’s right to fill. Pp. 25–27.\n   (c) The decision below is consistent with these principles. Cf. Lucas\nv. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 1028–1029. It did\nnot abolish the Members’ right to future accretions, but merely held\nthat the right was not implicated by the beach-restoration project be\ncause of the doctrine of avulsion. Relying on dicta in the Florida Su\npreme Court’s Sand Key decision, petitioner contends that the State\ntook the Members’ littoral right to have the boundary always be the\nmean high-water line. But petitioner’s interpretation of that dictum\ncontradicts the clear law governing avulsion. One cannot say the\nFlorida Supreme Court contravened established property law by re\njecting it. Pp. 27–29.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE THOMAS, and\nJUSTICE ALITO, concluded in Parts II and III that if a court declares\nthat what was once an established right of private property no longer\nexists, it has taken that property in violation of the Takings Clause.\nPp. 7–24.\n   (a) Though the classic taking is a transfer of property by eminent\ndomain, the Clause applies to other state actions that achieve the\nsame thing, including those that recharacterize as public property\nwhat was previously private property, see Webb’s Fabulous Pharma\ncies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U. S. 155, 163–165. The Clause is not ad\ndressed to the action of a specific branch or branches. It is concerned\nsimply with the act, not with the governmental actor. This Court’s\nprecedents provide no support for the proposition that takings ef\nfected by the judicial branch are entitled to special treatment, and in\nfact suggest the contrary. See PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins,\n447 U. S. 74, Webb’s Fabulous Pharmacies, supra. Pp. 7–20.\n   (b) For a judicial taking, respondents would add to the normal tak\nings inquiry the requirement that the court’s decision have no “fair\nand substantial basis.” This test is not obviously appropriate, but it\nis no different in this context from the requirement that the property\nowner prove an established property right. Respondents’ additional\narguments—that federal courts lack the knowledge of state law re\nquired to decide whether a state judicial decision purporting to clarify\nproperty rights has instead taken them; that common-law judging\nshould not be deprived of needed flexibility; and that applying the\nTakings Clause to judicial decisions would force lower federal courts\nto review final state-court judgments, in violation of the Rooker-\nFeldman doctrine, see Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413,\n415–416, District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U. S.\n462, 476—are unpersuasive. And petitioner’s proposed “unpredict\nability test”—that a judicial taking consists of a decision that “consti\ntutes a sudden change in state law, unpredictable in terms of rele\n4        STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n           IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                            Syllabus \n\n\n    vant precedents,” Hughes v. Washington, 389 U. S. 290, 296 (Stewart,\n    J., concurring)—is misdirected. What counts is not whether there is\n    precedent for the allegedly confiscatory decision, but whether the\n    property right allegedly taken was well established. Pp. 20–24.\n       JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, agreed that the\n    Florida Supreme Court did not take property without just compensa\n    tion, but concluded that this case does not require the Court to de\n    termine whether, or when, a judicial decision determining property\n    owners’ rights can violate the Takings Clause. If and when future\n    cases show that the usual principles, including constitutional ones\n    that constrain the judiciary like due process, are inadequate to pro\n    tect property owners, then the question whether a judicial decision\n    can effect a taking would be properly presented. Pp. 1–10.\n       JUSTICE BREYER, joined by JUSTICE GINSBURG, agreed that no un\n    constitutional taking occurred here, but concluded that it is unneces\n    sary to decide more than that to resolve this case. Difficult questions\n    of constitutional law—e.g., whether federal courts may review a state\n    court’s decision to determine if it unconstitutionally takes private\n    property without compensation, and what the proper test is for evalu\n    ating whether a state-court property decision enacts an unconstitu\n    tional taking—need not be addressed in order to dispose “of the im\n    mediate case.” Whitehouse v. Illinois Central R. Co., 349 U. S. 366,\n    373. Such questions are better left for another day.

Thus, the mean high-water line\n(the average reach of high tide over the preceding 19\nyears) is the ordinary boundary between private beach\nfront, or littoral1 property, and state-owned land. See\nMiller v. Bay-To-Gulf, Inc., 141 Fla. 452, 458–460, 193 So.\n425, 427–428 (1940) (per curiam); Fla.

Gulf, Florida &\nAlabama R. Co., 75 Fla. 28, 57, 78, 78 So. 491, 500, 507\n(1918) (on rehearing). These include the right of access to\nthe water, the right to use the water for certain purposes,\nthe right to an unobstructed view of the water, and the\nright to receive accretions and relictions to the littoral\nproperty. Id., at 58–59, 78 So., at 501; Board of Trustees\nof Internal Improvement Trust Fund v. Sand Key Assoc.,\nLtd., 512 So. 2d 934, 936 (Fla. 1987). This is generally in\naccord with well-established common law, although the\nprecise property rights vary among jurisdictions.

The Florida Supreme Court, however, has adopted a more\nprecise usage whereby “riparian” means abutting a river or stream and\n“littoral” means abutting an ocean, sea, or lake. Walton Cty. v. Stop the\nBeach Renourishment, Inc., 998 So. 2d 1102, 1105, n. 3 (2008).

S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n280 (1904) (hereinafter Farnham).\n   At the center of this case is the right to accretions and\nrelictions. Accretions are additions of alluvion (sand,\nsediment, or other deposits) to waterfront land; relictions\nare lands once covered by water that become dry when the\nwater recedes. F. Maloney, S. Plager, & F. Baldwin, Wa\nter Law and Administration: The Florida Experience §126,\npp. 385–386 (1968) (hereinafter Maloney); 1 Farnham §69,\nat 320. (For simplicity’s sake, we shall refer to accretions\nand relictions collectively as accretions, and the process\nwhereby they occur as accretion.) In order for an addition\nto dry land to qualify as an accretion, it must have oc\ncurred gradually and imperceptibly—that is, so slowly\nthat one could not see the change occurring, though over\ntime the difference became apparent. Sand Key, supra, at\n936; County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, 23 Wall. 46, 66–67\n(1874). When, on the other hand, there is a “sudden or\nperceptible loss of or addition to land by the action of the\nwater or a sudden change in the bed of a lake or the course\nof a stream,” the change is called an avulsion. Sand Key,\nsupra, at 936; see also 1 Farnham §69, at 320.\n   In Florida, as at common law, the littoral owner auto\nmatically takes title to dry land added to his property by\naccretion; but formerly submerged land that has become\ndry land by avulsion continues to belong to the owner of\nthe seabed (usually the State). See, e.g., Sand Key, supra,\nat 937; Maloney §126.6, at 392; 2 W. Blackstone, Commen\ntaries on the Laws of England 261–262 (1766) (hereinafter\nBlackstone). Thus, regardless of whether an avulsive\nevent exposes land previously submerged or submerges\nland previously exposed, the boundary between littoral\nproperty and sovereign land does not change; it remains\n(ordinarily) what was the mean high-water line before the\nevent. See Bryant v. Peppe, 238 So. 2d 836, 838–839 (Fla.\n1970); J. Gould, Law of Waters §158, p. 290 (1883). It\nfollows from this that, when a new strip of land has been\n4      STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n         IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\nadded to the shore by avulsion, the littoral owner has no\nright to subsequent accretions. Those accretions no longer\nadd to his property, since the property abutting the water\nbelongs not to him but to the State. See Maloney §126.6,\nat 393; 1 Farnham §71a, at 328.\n                              B\n   In 1961, Florida’s Legislature passed the Beach and\nShore Preservation Act, 1961 Fla. Laws ch. 61–246, as\namended, Fla. Stat. §§161.011–161.45 (2007). The Act\nestablishes procedures for “beach restoration and nour\nishment projects,” §161.088, designed to deposit sand on\neroded beaches (restoration) and to maintain the deposited\nsand (nourishment). §§161.021(3), (4). A local govern\nment may apply to the Department of Environmental\nProtection for the funds and the necessary permits to\nrestore a beach, see §§161.101(1), 161.041(1). When the\nproject involves placing fill on the State’s submerged\nlands, authorization is required from the Board of Trus\ntees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund, see\n§253.77(1), which holds title to those lands, §253.12(1).\n   Once a beach restoration “is determined to be under\ntaken,” the Board sets what is called “an erosion control\nline.” §§161.161(3)–(5). It must be set by reference to the\nexisting mean high-water line, though in theory it can be\nlocated seaward or landward of that.2 See §161.161(5).\nMuch of the project work occurs seaward of the erosion\ncontrol line, as sand is dumped on what was once sub\nmerged land. See App. 87–88.

Once the erosion-control line\nis recorded, the common law ceases to increase upland\nproperty by accretion (or decrease it by erosion).\n§161.191(2). Thus, when accretion to the shore moves the\nmean high-water line seaward, the property of beachfront\nlandowners is not extended to that line (as the prior law\nprovided), but remains bounded by the permanent erosion\ncontrol line. Those landowners “continue to be entitled,”\nhowever, “to all common-law riparian rights” other than\nthe right to accretions. §161.201. If the beach erodes back\nlandward of the erosion-control line over a substantial\nportion of the shoreline covered by the project, the Board\nmay, on its own initiative, or must, if asked by the owners\nor lessees of a majority of the property affected, direct the\nagency responsible for maintaining the beach to return the\nbeach to the condition contemplated by the project. If that\nis not done within a year, the project is canceled and the\nerosion-control line is null and void. §161.211(2), (3).\nFinally, by regulation, if the use of submerged land would\n“unreasonably infringe on riparian rights,” the project\ncannot proceed unless the local governments show that\nthey own or have a property interest in the upland prop\nerty adjacent to the project site.

The project envisioned depositing along that\nshore sand dredged from further out. See Walton Cty. v.\nStop the Beach Renourishment, Inc., 998 So. 2d 1102, 1106\n(Fla. 2008). It would add about 75 feet of dry sand sea\nward of the mean high-water line (to be denominated the\nerosion-control line).

It brought an administra\ntive challenge to the proposed project, see id., at 10–26,\nwhich was unsuccessful; the Department approved the\npermits. Petitioner then challenged that action in state\ncourt under the Florida Administrative Procedure Act,\nFla. Stat. §120.68 (2007). The District Court of Appeal for\nthe First District concluded that, contrary to the Act’s\npreservation of “all common-law riparian rights,” the order\nhad eliminated two of the Members’ littoral rights: (1) the\nright to receive accretions to their property; and (2) the\nright to have the contact of their property with the water\nremain intact. Save Our Beaches, Inc. v. Florida Dept. of\nEnvironmental Protection, 27 So. 3d 48, 57 (2006). This, it\nbelieved, would be an unconstitutional taking, which\nwould “unreasonably infringe on riparian rights,” and\ntherefore require the showing under Fla. Admin. Code\nRule 18–21.004(3)(b) that the local governments owned or\nhad a property interest in the upland property. It set\naside the Department’s final order approving the permits\nand remanded for that showing to be made. 27 So. 3d, at\n60. It also certified to the Florida Supreme Court the\nfollowing question (as rephrased by the latter court):\n         “On its face, does the Beach and Shore Preservation\n       Act unconstitutionally deprive upland owners of litto\n       ral rights without just compensation?”3 998 So. 2d, at\n       1105 (footnotes omitted).\n——————\n    3 The\n        Florida Supreme Court seemingly took the question to refer to\nconstitutionality under the Florida Constitution, which contains a\nclause similar to the Takings Clause of the Federal Constitution.\nCompare Fla.

Id., at 1121. It faulted the Court of Appeal for\nnot considering the doctrine of avulsion, which it con\ncluded permitted the State to reclaim the restored beach\non behalf of the public. Id., at 1116–1118. It described the\nright to accretions as a future contingent interest, not a\nvested property right, and held that there is no littoral\nright to contact with the water independent of the littoral\nright of access, which the Act does not infringe. Id., at\n1112, 1119–1120. Petitioner sought rehearing on the\nground that the Florida Supreme Court’s decision itself\neffected a taking of the Members’ littoral rights contrary\nto the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal\nConstitution.4 The request for rehearing was denied. We\ngranted certiorari, 557 U.

The Takings Clause—“nor shall private\nproperty be taken for public use, without just compensa\ntion,” U. S. Const., Amdt. 5—applies as fully to the taking\nof a landowner’s riparian rights as it does to the taking of\nan estate in land.5 See Yates v. Milwaukee, 10 Wall. 497,\n504 (1871). Moreover, though the classic taking is a trans\n——————\n  4 We ordinarily do not consider an issue first presented to a state\n\ncourt in a petition for rehearing if the state court did not address it.\nSee Adams v. Robertson, 520 U. S. 83, 89, n. 3 (1997) (per curiam). But\nwhere the state-court decision itself is claimed to constitute a violation\nof federal law, the state court’s refusal to address that claim put for\nward in a petition for rehearing will not bar our review. See Brinker\nhoff-Faris Trust & Sav. Co. v. Hill, 281 U. S. 673, 677–678 (1930).\n  5 We thus need not resolve whether the right of accretion is an ease\n\nment, as petitioner claims, or, as Florida claims, a contingent future\ninterest.\n8     STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n        IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                                the Court\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J. \n\n\nfer of property to the State or to another private party by\neminent domain, the Takings Clause applies to other state\nactions that achieve the same thing. Thus, when the\ngovernment uses its own property in such a way that it\ndestroys private property, it has taken that property. See\nUnited States v. Causby, 328 U. S. 256, 261–262 (1946);\nPumpelly v. Green Bay Co., 13 Wall. 166, 177–178 (1872).\nSimilarly, our doctrine of regulatory takings “aims to\nidentify regulatory actions that are functionally equivalent\nto the classic taking.” Lingle v. Chevron U. S. A. Inc., 544\nU. S. 528, 539 (2005). Thus, it is a taking when a state\nregulation forces a property owner to submit to a perma\nnent physical occupation, Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhat\ntan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419, 425–426 (1982), or de\nprives him of all economically beneficial use of his\nproperty, Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505\nU. S. 1003, 1019 (1992). Finally (and here we approach\nthe situation before us), States effect a taking if they\nrecharacterize as public property what was previously\nprivate property. See Webb’s Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v.\nBeckwith, 449 U. S. 155, 163–165 (1980).\n   The Takings Clause (unlike, for instance, the Ex Post\nFacto Clauses, see Art. I, §9, cl. 3; §10, cl. 1) is not ad\ndressed to the action of a specific branch or branches. It is\nconcerned simply with the act, and not with the govern\nmental actor (“nor shall private property be taken” (em\nphasis added)). There is no textual justification for saying\nthat the existence or the scope of a State’s power to expro\npriate private property without just compensation varies\naccording to the branch of government effecting the expro\npriation. Nor does common sense recommend such a\nprinciple. It would be absurd to allow a State to do by\njudicial decree what the Takings Clause forbids it to do by\nlegislative fiat. See Stevens v. Cannon Beach, 510 U. S.\n1207, 1211–1212 (1994) (SCALIA, J., dissenting from denial\nof certiorari).\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                                the Court\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n   Our precedents provide no support for the proposition\nthat takings effected by the judicial branch are entitled to\nspecial treatment, and in fact suggest the contrary.\nPruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U. S. 74\n(1980), involved a decision of the California Supreme\nCourt overruling one of its prior decisions which had held\nthat the California Constitution’s guarantees of freedom of\nspeech and of the press, and of the right to petition the\ngovernment, did not require the owner of private property\nto accord those rights on his premises. The appellants,\nowners of a shopping center, contended that their private\nproperty rights could not “be denied by invocation of a\nstate constitutional provision or by judicial reconstruction\nof a State’s laws of private property,” id., at 79 (emphasis\nadded). We held that there had been no taking, citing\ncases involving legislative and executive takings, and\napplying standard Takings Clause analysis. See id., at\n82–84. We treated the California Supreme Court’s appli\ncation of the constitutional provisions as a regulation of\nthe use of private property, and evaluated whether that\nregulation violated the property owners’ “right to exclude\nothers,” id., at 80 (internal quotation marks omitted). Our\nopinion addressed only the claimed taking by the constitu\ntional provision. Its failure to speak separately to the\nclaimed taking by “judicial reconstruction of a State’s laws\nof private property” certainly does not suggest that a\ntaking by judicial action cannot occur, and arguably sug\ngests that the same analysis applicable to taking by con\nstitutional provision would apply.\n   Webb’s Fabulous Pharmacies, supra, is even closer in\npoint. There the purchaser of an insolvent corporation\nhad interpleaded the corporation’s creditors, placing the\npurchase price in an interest-bearing account in the regis\ntry of the Circuit Court of Seminole County, to be distrib\nuted in satisfaction of claims approved by a receiver. The\nFlorida Supreme Court construed an applicable statute to\n10    STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n        IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                                the Court\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J. \n\n\nmean that the interest on the account belonged to the\ncounty, because the account was “considered ‘public\nmoney,’ ” Beckwith v. Webb’s Fabulous Pharmacies, 374\nSo. 2d 951, 952–953 (1979) (per curiam). We held this to\nbe a taking. We noted that “[t]he usual and general rule is\nthat any interest on an interpleaded and deposited fund\nfollows the principal and is to be allocated to those who\nare ultimately to be the owners of that principal,” 449\nU. S., at 162. “Neither the Florida Legislature by statute,\nnor the Florida courts by judicial decree,” we said, “may\naccomplish the result the county seeks simply by rechar\nacterizing the principal as ‘public money.’ ” Id., at 164.\n   In sum, the Takings Clause bars the State from taking\nprivate property without paying for it, no matter which\nbranch is the instrument of the taking. To be sure, the\nmanner of state action may matter: Condemnation by\neminent domain, for example, is always a taking, while a\nlegislative, executive, or judicial restriction of property use\nmay or may not be, depending on its nature and extent.\nBut the particular state actor is irrelevant. If a legislature\nor a court declares that what was once an established\nright of private property no longer exists, it has taken that\nproperty, no less than if the State had physically appro\npriated it or destroyed its value by regulation. “[A] State,\nby ipse dixit, may not transform private property into\npublic property without compensation.” Ibid.\n                             B\n  JUSTICE BREYER’s concurrence says that we need nei\nther (1) to decide whether the judiciary can ever effect a\ntaking, nor (2) to establish the standard for determining\nwhether it has done so. See post, at 1–2 (opinion concur\nring in part and concurring in judgment). The second part\nof this is surely incompatible with JUSTICE BREYER’s\nconclusion that the “Florida Supreme Court’s decision in\nthis case did not amount to a ‘judicial taking.’ ” Post, at 3.\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

To the contrary,\nwe have often recognized the existence of a constitutional\nright, or established the test for violation of such a right\n(or both), and then gone on to find that the claim at issue\nfails. See, e.g., New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325, 333,\n341–343 (1985) (holding that the Fourth Amendment\napplies to searches and seizures conducted by public\nschool officials, establishing the standard for finding a\nviolation, but concluding that the claim at issue failed);\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 687, 698–700\n(1984) (recognizing a constitutional right to effective assis\ntance of counsel, establishing the test for its violation, but\nholding that the claim at issue failed); Hill v. Lockhart,\n474 U. S. 52, 58–60 (1985) (holding that a Strickland\nclaim can be brought to challenge a guilty plea, but reject\ning the claim at issue); Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.

In constitutional-tort suits against public officials,\nwe have found the defendants entitled to immunity only\nafter holding that their action violated the Constitution.\nSee, e.g., Wilson v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 605–606 (1999).\nIndeed, up until last Term, we required federal courts to\naddress the constitutional question before the immunity\nquestion. See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 201 (2001),\noverruled by Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. ___, ___\n(2009) (slip op., at 10).\n   “Assuming without deciding” would be less appropriate\nhere than it was in many of those earlier cases, which\nestablished constitutional rights quite separate from any\nthat had previously been acknowledged. Compared to\nStrickland’s proclamation of a right to effective assistance\nof counsel, for example, proclaiming that a taking can\noccur through judicial action addresses a point of relative\ndetail.\n   In sum, JUSTICE BREYER cannot decide that petitioner’s\nclaim fails without first deciding what a valid claim would\nconsist of. His agreement with Part IV of our opinion\nnecessarily implies agreement with the test for a judicial\ntaking (elaborated in Part II–A) which Part IV applies:\nwhether the state court has “declare[d] that what was\nonce an established right of private property no longer\nexists,” supra, at 10. JUSTICE BREYER must either agree\nwith that standard or craft one of his own. And agreeing\nto or crafting a hypothetical standard for a hypothetical\nconstitutional right is sufficiently unappealing (we have\neschewed that course many times in the past) that\n                      Cite as: 560 U.

Or he could avoid the need to agree with or craft a\nhypothetical standard by denying the right. But embrac\ning a standard while being coy about the right is, well,\nodd; and deciding this case while addressing neither the\nstandard nor the right is quite impossible.\n  JUSTICE BREYER responds that he simply advocates\nresolving this case without establishing “the precise stan\ndard under which a party wins or loses.” Post, at 3 (em\nphasis added). But he relies upon no standard at all,\nprecise or imprecise. He simply pronounces that this is\nnot a judicial taking if there is such a thing as a judicial\ntaking. The cases he cites to support this Queen-of-Hearts\napproach provide no precedent. In each of them the exis\ntence of the right in question was settled,7 and we faced a\nchoice between competing standards that had been applied\nby the courts.8 We simply held that the right in question\nhad not been infringed under any of them. There is no\nestablished right here, and no competing standards.\n\n\n\n——————\n   7 See Smith v. Spisak, 558 U.

That approach is invalid\nfor the reasons we have discussed.\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY says that we need not take what he\nconsiders the bold and risky step of holding that the Tak\nings Clause applies to judicial action, because the Due\nProcess Clause “would likely prevent a State from doing\nby judicial decree what the Takings Clause forbids it to do\nby legislative fiat,” post, at 4–5 (opinion concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). He invokes the Due Process Clause “in both its\nsubstantive and procedural aspects,” post, at 3, not speci\nfying which of his arguments relates to which.\n  The first respect in which JUSTICE KENNEDY thinks the\nDue Process Clause can do the job seems to sound in\nProcedural Due Process. Because, he says, “[c]ourts,\nunlike the executive or legislature, are not designed to\nmake policy decisions” about expropriation, “[t]he Court\nwould be on strong footing in ruling that a judicial deci\nsion that eliminates or substantially changes established\nproperty rights” violates the Due Process Clause. Post, at\n4. Let us be clear what is being proposed here. This Court\nhas held that the separation-of-powers principles that the\nConstitution imposes upon the Federal Government do not\napply against the States. See Dreyer v. Illinois, 187 U. S.\n71, 83–84 (1902). But in order to avoid the bold and risky\nstep of saying that the Takings Clause applies to all gov\nernment takings, JUSTICE KENNEDY would have us use\nProcedural Due Process to impose judicially crafted sepa\nration-of-powers limitations upon the States: courts can\nnot be used to perform the governmental function of ex\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

The asserted reasons for the due-process\nlimitation are that the legislative and executive branches\n“are accountable in their political capacity” for takings,\npost, at 2, and “[c]ourts . . . are not designed to make policy\ndecisions” about takings, post, at 4. These reasons may\nhave a lot to do with sound separation-of-powers principles\nthat ought to govern a democratic society, but they have\nnothing whatever to do with the protection of individual\nrights that is the object of the Due Process Clause.\n   Of course even taking those reasons at face value, it is\nstrange to proclaim a democracy deficit and lack of special\ncompetence for the judicial taking of an individual prop\nerty right, when this Court has had no trouble deciding\nmatters of much greater moment, contrary to congres\nsional desire or the legislated desires of most of the States,\nwith no special competence except the authority we pos\nsess to enforce the Constitution. In any case, our opinion\ndoes not trust judges with the relatively small power\nJUSTICE KENNEDY now objects to. It is we who propose\nsetting aside judicial decisions that take private property;\nit is he who insists that judges cannot be so limited. Un\nder his regime, the citizen whose property has been judi\ncially redefined to belong to the State would presumably\nbe given the Orwellian explanation: “The court did not\ntake your property. Because it is neither politically ac\ncountable nor competent to make such a decision, it can\nnot take property.”\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY’s injection of separation-of-powers\nprinciples into the Due Process Clause would also have the\nironic effect of preventing the assignment of the expropria\ntion function to the branch of government whose proce\ndures are, by far, the most protective of individual rights.\nSo perhaps even this first respect in which JUSTICE KEN-\nNEDY would have the Due Process Clause do the work of\nthe Takings Clause pertains to Substantive, rather than\nProcedural, Due Process. His other arguments undoubt\n16    STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n        IDA DEPT.

Oliver, 510 U. S. 266, 273\n(1994) (four-Justice plurality opinion) (quoting Graham v.\nConnor, 490 U. S. 386, 395 (1989)); see also 510 U. S., at\n281 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment) (“I agree with\nthe plurality that an allegation of arrest without probable\ncause must be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment\nwithout reference to more general considerations of due\nprocess”). The second problem is that we have held for\nmany years (logically or not) that the “liberties” protected\nby Substantive Due Process do not include economic liber\nties. See, e.g., Lincoln Fed. Labor Union v. Northwestern\nIron & Metal Co., 335 U. S. 525, 536 (1949). JUSTICE\nKENNEDY’s language (“If a judicial decision . . . eliminates\nan established property right, the judgment could be set\naside as a deprivation of property without due process of\nlaw,” post, at 3) propels us back to what is referred to\n(usually deprecatingly) as “the Lochner era.” See Lochner\nv. New York, 198 U. S 45, 56–58 (1905). That is a step of\nmuch greater novelty, and much more unpredictable\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

And the third and last problem with using Sub\nstantive Due Process is that either (1) it will not do all\nthat the Takings Clause does, or (2) if it does all that the\nTakings Clause does, it will encounter the same supposed\ndifficulties that JUSTICE KENNEDY finds troublesome.\n   We do not grasp the relevance of JUSTICE KENNEDY’s\nspeculation, post, at 6, that the Framers did not envision\nthe Takings Clause would apply to judicial action. They\ndoubtless did not, since the Constitution was adopted in\nan era when courts had no power to “change” the common\nlaw. See 1 Blackstone 69–70 (1765); Rogers v. Tennessee,\n532 U. S. 451, 472–478 (2001) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\nWhere the text they adopted is clear, however (“nor shall\nprivate property be taken for public use”), what counts is\nnot what they envisioned but what they wrote. Of course\neven after courts, in the 19th century, did assume the\npower to change the common law, it is not true that the\nnew “common-law tradition . . . allows for incremental\nmodifications to property law,” post, at 4, so that “owners\nmay reasonably expect or anticipate courts to make cer\ntain changes in property law,” post, at 6. In the only sense\nin which this could be relevant to what we are discussing,\nthat is an astounding statement. We are talking here\nabout judicial elimination of established private property\nrights.    If that is indeed a “common-law tradition,”\nJUSTICE KENNEDY ought to be able to provide a more solid\nexample for it than the only one he cites, post, at 5, a\nstate-court change (from “noxious” to “harmful”) of the test\nfor determining whether a neighbor’s vegetation is a tor\ntious nuisance. Fancher v. Fagella, 274 Va. 549, 555–556,\n650 S. E. 2d 519, 522 (2007). But perhaps he does not\nreally mean that it is a common-law tradition to eliminate\nproperty rights, since he immediately follows his state\nment that “owners may reasonably expect or anticipate\ncourts to make certain changes in property law” with the\n18    STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n        IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                                the Court\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J. \n\n\ncontradictory statement that “courts cannot abandon\nsettled principles,” post, at 6. If no “settled principl[e]” has\nbeen abandoned, it is hard to see how property law could\nhave been “change[d],” rather than merely clarified.\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY has added “two additional practical\nconsiderations that the Court would need to address be\nfore recognizing judicial takings,” post, at 7. One of them\nis simple and simply answered: the assertion that “it is\nunclear what remedy a reviewing court could enter after\nfinding a judicial taking,” post, at 8. JUSTICE KENNEDY\nworries that we may only be able to mandate compensa\ntion. That remedy is even rare for a legislative or execu\ntive taking, and we see no reason why it would be the\nexclusive remedy for a judicial taking. If we were to hold\nthat the Florida Supreme Court had effected an uncom\npensated taking in the present case, we would simply\nreverse the Florida Supreme Court’s judgment that the\nBeach and Shore Preservation Act can be applied to the\nproperty in question. JUSTICE KENNEDY’s other point,\npost, at 7–8—that we will have to decide when the claim of\na judicial taking must be asserted—hardly presents an\nawe-inspiring prospect. These, and all the other “difficul\nties,” post, at 1, “difficult questions,” post, at 5, and “prac\ntical considerations” post, at 7, that JUSTICE KENNEDY\nworries may perhaps stand in the way of recognizing a\njudicial taking, are either nonexistent or insignificant.\n   Finally, we cannot avoid comment upon JUSTICE\nKENNEDY’s donning of the mantle of judicial restraint—\nhis assertion that it is we, and not he, who would empower\nthe courts and encourage their expropriation of private\nproperty. He warns that if judges know that their action\nis covered by the Takings Clause, they will issue “sweep\ning new rule[s] to adjust the rights of property owners,”\ncomfortable in the knowledge that their innovations will\nbe preserved upon payment by the State. Post, at 6. That\nis quite impossible. As we have said, if we were to hold\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                                 the Court\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nthat the Florida Supreme Court had effected an uncom\npensated taking in this case, we would not validate the\ntaking by ordering Florida to pay compensation. We\nwould simply reverse the Florida Supreme Court’s judg\nment that the Beach and Shore Preservation Act can be\napplied to the Members’ property. The power to effect a\ncompensated taking would then reside, where it has al\nways resided, not in the Florida Supreme Court but in the\nFlorida Legislature—which could either provide compen\nsation or acquiesce in the invalidity of the offending fea\ntures of the Act. Cf. Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury,\n489 U. S. 803, 817–818 (1989). The only realistic incentive\nthat subjection to the Takings Clause might provide to any\ncourt would be the incentive to get reversed, which in our\nexperience few judges value.\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY, however, while dismissive of the\nTakings Clause, places no other constraints on judicial\naction. He puts forward some extremely vague applica\ntions of Substantive Due Process, and does not even say\nthat they (whatever they are) will for sure apply. (“It is\nthus natural to read the Due Process Clause as limiting\nthe power of courts to eliminate or change established\nproperty rights,” post, at 3; “courts . . . may not have the\npower to eliminate established property rights by judicial\ndecision,” post, at 4; “the Due Process Clause would likely\nprevent a State from doing by judicial decree what the\nTakings Clause forbids it to do by legislative fiat,” post, at\n4–5 (internal quotation marks omitted); we must defer\napplying the Takings Clause until “[i]f and when future\ncases show that the usual principles, including constitu\ntional principles that constrain the judiciary like due\nprocess, are somehow inadequate to protect property\nowners,” post, at 10.)\n   Moreover, and more importantly, JUSTICE KENNEDY\nplaces no constraints whatever upon this Court. Not only\ndoes his concurrence only think about applying Substan\n20    STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n        IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                                the Court\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J. \n\n\ntive Due Process; but because Substantive Due Process is\nsuch a wonderfully malleable concept, see, e.g., Lawrence\nv. Texas, 539 U. S. 558, 562 (2003) (referring to “liberty of\nthe person both in its spatial and in its more transcendent\ndimensions”), even a firm commitment to apply it would be\na firm commitment to nothing in particular. JUSTICE\nKENNEDY’s desire to substitute Substantive Due Process\nfor the Takings Clause suggests, and the rest of what he\nwrites confirms, that what holds him back from giving the\nTakings Clause its natural meaning is not the intrusive\nness of applying it to judicial action, but the definiteness of\ndoing so; not a concern to preserve the powers of the\nStates’ political branches, but a concern to preserve this\nCourt’s discretion to say that property may be taken, or\nmay not be taken, as in the Court’s view the circumstances\nsuggest. We must not say that we are bound by the Con\nstitution never to sanction judicial elimination of clearly\nestablished property rights. Where the power of this\nCourt is concerned, one must never say never. See, e.g.,\nVieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267, 302–305 (2004) (plurality\nopinion); Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 750–751\n(2004) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment). The great attraction of Substantive Due Proc\ness as a substitute for more specific constitutional guaran\ntees is that it never means never—because it never means\nanything precise.\n                             III\n   Respondents put forward a number of arguments which\ncontradict, to a greater or lesser degree, the principle\ndiscussed above, that the existence of a taking does not\ndepend upon the branch of government that effects it.\nFirst, in a case claiming a judicial taking they would add\nto our normal takings inquiry a requirement that the\ncourt’s decision have no “fair and substantial basis.” This\nis taken from our jurisprudence dealing with the question\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                    21\n\n                                     the Court\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nwhether a state-court decision rests upon adequate and\nindependent state grounds, placing it beyond our jurisdic\ntion to review. See E. Gressman, K. Geller, S. Shapiro, T.\nBishop, & E. Hartnett, Supreme Court Practice, ch. 3.26,\np. 222 (9th ed. 2007). To assure that there is no “evasion”\nof our authority to review federal questions, we insist that\nthe nonfederal ground of decision have “fair support.”\nBroad River Power Co. v. South Carolina ex rel. Daniel,\n281 U. S. 537, 540 (1930); see also Ward v. Board of\nComm’rs of Love Cty., 253 U. S. 17, 22–23 (1920). A test\ndesigned to determine whether there has been an evasion\nis not obviously appropriate for determining whether there\nhas been a taking of property. But if it is to be extended\nthere it must mean (in the present context) that there is a\n“fair and substantial basis” for believing that petitioner’s\nMembers did not have a property right to future accretions\nwhich the Act would take away. This is no different, we\nthink, from our requirement that petitioners’ Members\nmust prove the elimination of an established property\nright.9\n   Next, respondents argue that federal courts lack the\nknowledge of state law required to decide whether a judi\n——————\n   9 JUSTICE BREYER complains that we do not set forth “procedural limi\n\ntations or canons of deference” to restrict federal-court review of state\ncourt property decisions. See post, at 2. (1) To the extent this is true it\nis unsurprising, but (2) fundamentally, it is false: (1) It is true that we\nmake our own determination, without deference to state judges,\nwhether the challenged decision deprives the claimant of an established\nproperty right. That is unsurprising because it is what this Court does\nwhen determining state-court compliance with all constitutional\nimperatives. We do not defer to the judgment of state judges in deter\nmining whether, for example, a state-court decision has deprived a\ndefendant of due process or subjected him to double jeopardy. (2) The\ntest we have adopted, however (deprivation of an established property\nright), contains within itself a considerable degree of deference to state\ncourts. A property right is not established if there is doubt about its\nexistence; and when there is doubt we do not make our own assessment\nbut accept the determination of the state court.\n22    STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n        IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                                the Court\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J. \n\n\ncial decision that purports merely to clarify property\nrights has instead taken them. But federal courts must\noften decide what state property rights exist in nontakings\ncontexts, see, e.g., Board of Regents of State Colleges v.\nRoth, 408 U. S. 564, 577–578 (1972) (Due Process Clause).\nAnd indeed they must decide it to resolve claims that\nlegislative or executive action has effected a taking. For\nexample, a regulation that deprives a property owner of all\neconomically beneficial use of his property is not a taking\nif the restriction “inhere[s] in the title itself, in the restric\ntions that background principles of the State’s law of\nproperty and nuisance already place upon land owner\nship.” Lucas, 505 U. S., at 1029. A constitutional provi\nsion that forbids the uncompensated taking of property is\nquite simply insusceptible of enforcement by federal courts\nunless they have the power to decide what property rights\nexist under state law.\n   Respondents also warn us against depriving common\nlaw judging of needed flexibility. That argument has little\nappeal when directed against the enforcement of a consti\ntutional guarantee adopted in an era when, as we said\nsupra, at 17, courts had no power to “change” the common\nlaw. But in any case, courts have no peculiar need of\nflexibility. It is no more essential that judges be free to\noverrule prior cases that establish property entitlements\nthan that state legislators be free to revise pre-existing\nstatutes that confer property entitlements, or agency\nheads pre-existing regulations that do so. And insofar as\ncourts merely clarify and elaborate property entitlements\nthat were previously unclear, they cannot be said to have\ntaken an established property right.\n   Finally, the city and county argue that applying the\nTakings Clause to judicial decisions would force lower\nfederal courts to review final state-court judgments, in\nviolation of the so-called Rooker-Feldman doctrine. See\nRooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413, 415–416\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           23\n\n                                 the Court\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n(1923); District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman,\n460 U. S. 462, 476 (1983). That does not necessarily fol\nlow. The finality principles that we regularly apply to\ntakings claims, see Williamson County Regional Planning\nComm’n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172,\n186–194 (1985), would require the claimant to appeal a\nclaimed taking by a lower court to the state supreme\ncourt, whence certiorari would come to this Court. If\ncertiorari were denied, the claimant would no more be able\nto launch a lower-court federal suit against the taking\neffected by the state supreme-court opinion than he would\nbe able to launch such a suit against a legislative or execu\ntive taking approved by the state supreme-court opinion;\nthe matter would be res judicata. And where the claimant\nwas not a party to the original suit, he would be able to\nchallenge in federal court the taking effected by the state\nsupreme-court opinion to the same extent that he would\nbe able to challenge in federal court a legislative or execu\ntive taking previously approved by a state supreme-court\nopinion.\n   For its part, petitioner proposes an unpredictability test.\nQuoting Justice Stewart’s concurrence in Hughes v. Wash\nington, 389 U. S. 290, 296 (1967), petitioner argues that a\njudicial taking consists of a decision that “ ‘constitutes a\nsudden change in state law, unpredictable in terms of\nrelevant precedents.’ ” See Brief for Petitioner 17, 34–50.\nThe focus of petitioner’s test is misdirected. What counts\nis not whether there is precedent for the allegedly confis\ncatory decision, but whether the property right allegedly\ntaken was established. A “predictability of change” test\nwould cover both too much and too little. Too much, be\ncause a judicial property decision need not be predictable,\nso long as it does not declare that what had been private\nproperty under established law no longer is. A decision\nthat clarifies property entitlements (or the lack thereof)\nthat were previously unclear might be difficult to predict,\n24     STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n         IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\nbut it does not eliminate established property rights. And\nthe predictability test covers too little, because a judicial\nelimination of established private-property rights that is\nforeshadowed by dicta or even by holdings years in ad\nvance is nonetheless a taking. If, for example, a state\ncourt held in one case, to which the complaining property\nowner was not a party, that it had the power to limit the\nacreage of privately owned real estate to 100 acres, and\nthen, in a second case, applied that principle to declare the\ncomplainant’s 101st acre to be public property, the State\nwould have taken an acre from the complainant even\nthough the decision was predictable.\n                              IV\n  We come at last to petitioner’s takings attack on the\ndecision below. At the outset, respondents raise two pre\nliminary points which need not detain us long. The city\nand the county argue that petitioner cannot state a cause\nof action for a taking because, though the Members own\nprivate property, petitioner itself does not; and that the\nclaim is unripe because petitioner has not sought just\ncompensation. Neither objection appeared in the briefs in\nopposition to the petition for writ of certiorari, and since\nneither is jurisdictional,10 we deem both waived. See this\nCourt’s Rule 15.2; cf. Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U. S.\n808, 815–816 (1985).\n  Petitioner argues that the Florida Supreme Court took\ntwo of the property rights of the Members by declaring\nthat those rights did not exist: the right to accretions, and\nthe right to have littoral property touch the water (which\n——————\n  10 Petitioner meets the two requirements necessary for an association\n\nto assert the Article III standing of its Members. See Food and Com\nmercial Workers v. Brown Group, Inc., 517 U. S. 544, 555–557 (1996).\nAnd the claim here is ripe insofar as Article III standing is concerned,\nsince (accepting petitioner’s version of Florida law as true) petitioner\nhas been deprived of property.\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                  25\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\npetitioner distinguishes from the mere right of access to\nthe water).11 Under petitioner’s theory, because no prior\nFlorida decision had said that the State’s filling of sub\nmerged tidal lands could have the effect of depriving a\nlittoral owner of contact with the water and denying him\nfuture accretions, the Florida Supreme Court’s judgment\nin the present case abolished those two easements to\nwhich littoral property owners had been entitled. This\nputs the burden on the wrong party. There is no taking\nunless petitioner can show that, before the Florida Su\npreme Court’s decision, littoral-property owners had rights\nto future accretions and contact with the water superior to\nthe State’s right to fill in its submerged land. Though\nsome may think the question close, in our view the show\ning cannot be made.\n   Two core principles of Florida property law intersect in\nthis case. First, the State as owner of the submerged land\nadjacent to littoral property has the right to fill that land,\nso long as it does not interfere with the rights of the public\nand the rights of littoral landowners. See Hayes v. Bow\nman, 91 So. 2d 795, 799–800 (Fla. 1957) (right to fill con\nveyed by State to private party); State ex rel. Buford v.\nTampa, 88 Fla. 196, 210–211, 102 So. 336, 341 (1924)\n——————\n  11 Petitioner raises two other claims that we do not directly address.\nFirst, petitioner tries to revive its challenge to the beach restoration\nproject, contending that it (rather than the Florida Supreme Court’s\nopinion) constitutes a taking. Petitioner’s arguments on this score are\nsimply versions of two arguments it makes against the Florida Su\npreme Court’s opinion: that the Department has replaced the Members’\nlittoral property rights with versions that are inferior because statu\ntory; and that the Members previously had the right to have their\nproperty contact the water. We reject both, infra, at 28–29, and n. 12.\nSecond, petitioner attempts to raise a challenge to the Act as a depriva\ntion of property without due process. Petitioner did not raise this\nchallenge before the Florida Supreme Court, and only obliquely raised\nit in the petition for certiorari. We therefore do not reach it. See\nAdams, 520 U. S., at 86–87.\n26    STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n        IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n(same). Second, as we described supra, at 3–4, if an avul\nsion exposes land seaward of littoral property that had\npreviously been submerged, that land belongs to the State\neven if it interrupts the littoral owner’s contact with the\nwater. See Bryant, 238 So. 2d, at 837, 838–839. The issue\nhere is whether there is an exception to this rule when the\nState is the cause of the avulsion. Prior law suggests\nthere is not. In Martin v. Busch, 93 Fla. 535, 112 So. 274\n(1927), the Florida Supreme Court held that when the\nState drained water from a lakebed belonging to the State,\ncausing land that was formerly below the mean high\nwater line to become dry land, that land continued to\nbelong to the State. Id., at 574, 112 So., at 287; see also\nBryant, supra, at 838–839 (analogizing the situation in\nMartin to an avulsion). “ ‘The riparian rights doctrine of\naccretion and reliction,’ ” the Florida Supreme Court later\nexplained, “ ‘does not apply to such lands.’ ” Bryant, supra,\nat 839 (quoting Martin, supra, at 578, 112 So., at 288\n(Brown, J., concurring)). This is not surprising, as there can\nbe no accretions to land that no longer abuts the water.\n   Thus, Florida law as it stood before the decision below\nallowed the State to fill in its own seabed, and the result\ning sudden exposure of previously submerged land was\ntreated like an avulsion for purposes of ownership. The\nright to accretions was therefore subordinate to the State’s\nright to fill. Thiesen v. Gulf, Florida & Alabama R. Co.\nsuggests the same result. That case involved a claim by a\nriparian landowner that a railroad’s state-authorized\nfilling of submerged land and construction of tracks upon\nit interfered with the riparian landowners’ rights to access\nand to wharf out to a shipping channel. The Florida Su\npreme Court determined that the claimed right to wharf\nout did not exist in Florida, and that therefore only the\nright of access was compensable. 75 Fla., at 58–65, 78 So.,\nat 501–503. Significantly, although the court recognized\nthat the riparian-property owners had rights to accretion,\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           27\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsee id., at 64–65, 78 So., at 502–503, the only rights it\neven suggested would be infringed by the railroad were\nthe right of access (which the plaintiff had claimed) and\nthe rights of view and use of the water (which it seems the\nplaintiff had not claimed), see id., at 58–59, 78, 78 So., at\n501, 507.\n  The Florida Supreme Court decision before us is consis\ntent with these background principles of state property\nlaw. Cf. Lucas, 505 U. S., at 1028–1029; Scranton v.\nWheeler, 179 U. S. 141, 163 (1900). It did not abolish the\nMembers’ right to future accretions, but merely held that\nthe right was not implicated by the beach-restoration\nproject, because the doctrine of avulsion applied. See 998\nSo. 2d, at 1117, 1120–1121. The Florida Supreme Court’s\nopinion describes beach restoration as the reclamation by\nthe State of the public’s land, just as Martin had described\nthe lake drainage in that case. Although the opinion does\nnot cite Martin and is not always clear on this point, it\nsuffices that its characterization of the littoral right to\naccretion is consistent with Martin and the other relevant\nprinciples of Florida law we have discussed.\n  What we have said shows that the rule of Sand Key,\nwhich petitioner repeatedly invokes, is inapposite. There\nthe Florida Supreme Court held that an artificial accretion\ndoes not change the right of a littoral-property owner to\nclaim the accreted land as his own (as long as the owner\ndid not cause the accretion himself). 512 So. 2d, at 937–\n938. The reason Martin did not apply, Sand Key ex\nplained, is that the drainage that had occurred in Martin\ndid not lower the water level by “ ‘imperceptible degrees,’ ”\nand so did not qualify as an accretion. 512 So. 2d, at 940–\n941.\n  The result under Florida law may seem counter\nintuitive. After all, the Members’ property has been de\nprived of its character (and value) as oceanfront property\nby the State’s artificial creation of an avulsion. Perhaps\n28    STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n        IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nstate-created avulsions ought to be treated differently\nfrom other avulsions insofar as the property right to accre\ntion is concerned. But nothing in prior Florida law makes\nsuch a distinction, and Martin suggests, if it does not\nindeed hold, the contrary. Even if there might be different\ninterpretations of Martin and other Florida property-law\ncases that would prevent this arguably odd result, we are\nnot free to adopt them. The Takings Clause only protects\nproperty rights as they are established under state law,\nnot as they might have been established or ought to have\nbeen established. We cannot say that the Florida Su\npreme Court’s decision eliminated a right of accretion\nestablished under Florida law.\n   Petitioner also contends that the State took the Mem\nbers’ littoral right to have their property continually main\ntain contact with the water. To be clear, petitioner does\nnot allege that the State relocated the property line, as\nwould have happened if the erosion-control line were\nlandward of the old mean high-water line (instead of\nidentical to it). Petitioner argues instead that the Mem\nbers have a separate right for the boundary of their prop\nerty to be always the mean high-water line. Petitioner\npoints to dicta in Sand Key that refers to “the right to have\nthe property’s contact with the water remain intact,” 512\nSo. 2d, at 936.

As JUSTICE BREYER observes, however,\nthis case does not require the Court to determine whether,\nor when, a judicial decision determining the rights of\nproperty owners can violate the Takings Clause of the\nFifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. This\nseparate opinion notes certain difficulties that should be\nconsidered before accepting the theory that a judicial\ndecision that eliminates an “established property right,”\nante, at 21, constitutes a violation of the Takings Clause.\n   The Takings Clause is an essential part of the constitu\ntional structure, for it protects private property from\nexpropriation without just compensation; and the right to\nown and hold property is necessary to the exercise and\npreservation of freedom. The right to retain property\nwithout the fact or even the threat of that sort of expro\npriation is, of course, applicable to the States under the\nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Chi\ncago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226, 239 (1897).\n2     STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n        IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                   Opinion of KENNEDY, J. \n\n\n   The right of the property owner is subject, however, to\nthe rule that the government does have power to take\nproperty for a public use, provided that it pays just com\npensation.     See First English Evangelical Lutheran\nChurch of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S.\n304, 314–315 (1987). This is a vast governmental power.\nAnd typically, legislative bodies grant substantial discre\ntion to executive officers to decide what property can be\ntaken for authorized projects and uses. As a result, if an\nauthorized executive agency or official decides that Black\nacre is the right place for a fire station or Greenacre is the\nbest spot for a freeway interchange, then the weight and\nauthority of the State are used to take the property, even\nagainst the wishes of the owner, who must be satisfied\nwith just compensation.\n   In the exercise of their duty to protect the fisc, both the\nlegislative and executive branches monitor, or should\nmonitor, the exercise of this substantial power. Those\nbranches are accountable in their political capacity for the\nproper discharge of this obligation.\n   To enable officials to better exercise this great power in\na responsible way, some States allow their officials to take\na second look after property has been condemned and a\njury returns a verdict setting the amount of just compen\nsation. See, e.g., Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. §1268.510\n(2007).    If the condemning authority, usually acting\nthrough the executive, deems the compensation too high to\npay for the project, it can decide not to take the property\nat all. The landowner is reimbursed for certain costs and\nexpenses of litigation and the property remains in his or\nher hands. See, e.g., §1268.610(a).\n   This is just one aspect of the exercise of the power to\nselect what property to condemn and the responsibility to\nensure that the taking makes financial sense from the\nState’s point of view. And, as a matter of custom and\npractice, these are matters for the political branches—the\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nlegislature and the executive—not the courts. See First\nEnglish, supra, at 321 (“[T]he decision to exercise the\npower of eminent domain is a legislative function”).\n   If a judicial decision, as opposed to an act of the execu\ntive or the legislature, eliminates an established property\nright, the judgment could be set aside as a deprivation of\nproperty without due process of law. The Due Process\nClause, in both its substantive and procedural aspects, is a\ncentral limitation upon the exercise of judicial power. And\nthis Court has long recognized that property regulations\ncan be invalidated under the Due Process Clause. See,\ne.g., Lingle v. Chevron U. S. A. Inc., 544 U. S. 528, 542\n(2005); Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369 U. S. 590, 591, 592–\n593 (1962); Demorest v. City Bank Farmers Trust Co., 321\nU. S. 36, 42–43 (1944); Broad River Power Co. v. South\nCarolina ex rel. Daniel, 281 U. S. 537, 539, 540–541\n(1930); Washington ex rel. Seattle Title Trust Co. v.\nRoberge, 278 U. S. 116, 121 (1928); Nectow v. Cambridge,\n277 U. S. 183, 188 (1928); Village of Euclid v. Ambler\nRealty Co., 272 U. S. 365, 395 (1926); see also Pennsyl\nvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 413 (1922) (there\nmust be limits on government’s ability to diminish prop\nerty values by regulation “or the contract and due process\nclauses are gone”). It is thus natural to read the Due\nProcess Clause as limiting the power of courts to eliminate\nor change established property rights.\n   The Takings Clause also protects property rights, and it\n“operates as a conditional limitation, permitting the gov\nernment to do what it wants so long as it pays the charge.”\nEastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U. S. 498, 545 (1998)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in\npart). Unlike the Due Process Clause, therefore, the\nTakings Clause implicitly recognizes a governmental\npower while placing limits upon that power. Thus, if the\nCourt were to hold that a judicial taking exists, it would\npresuppose that a judicial decision eliminating established\n4     STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n        IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                   Opinion of KENNEDY, J. \n\n\nproperty rights is “otherwise constitutional” so long as the\nState compensates the aggrieved property owners. Ibid.\nThere is no clear authority for this proposition.\n   When courts act without direction from the executive or\nlegislature, they may not have the power to eliminate\nestablished property rights by judicial decision. “Given\nthat the constitutionality” of a judicial decision altering\nproperty rights “appears to turn on the legitimacy” of\nwhether the court’s judgment eliminates or changes estab\nlished property rights “rather than on the availability of\ncompensation, . . . the more appropriate constitutional\nanalysis arises under general due process principles\nrather than under the Takings Clause.” Ibid. Courts,\nunlike the executive or legislature, are not designed to\nmake policy decisions about “the need for, and likely effec\ntiveness of, regulatory actions.” Lingle, supra, at 545.\nState courts generally operate under a common-law tradi\ntion that allows for incremental modifications to property\nlaw, but “this tradition cannot justify a carte blanch judi\ncial authority to change property definitions wholly free of\nconstitutional limitations.” Walston, The Constitution and\nProperty: Due Process, Regulatory Takings, and Judicial\nTakings, 2001 Utah L. Rev. 379, 435.\n   The Court would be on strong footing in ruling that a\njudicial decision that eliminates or substantially changes\nestablished property rights, which are a legitimate expec\ntation of the owner, is “arbitrary or irrational” under the\nDue Process Clause. Lingle, 544 U. S., at 542; see id., at\n548–549 (KENNEDY, J., concurring); see also Perry v.\nSindermann, 408 U. S. 593, 601 (1972) (“ ‘[P]roperty’ ”\ninterests protected by the Due Process Clauses are those\n“that are secured by ‘existing rules or understandings’ ”\n(quoting Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408\nU. S. 564, 577 (1972))). Thus, without a judicial takings\ndoctrine, the Due Process Clause would likely prevent a\nState from doing “by judicial decree what the Takings\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nClause forbids it to do by legislative fiat.” Ante, at 8. The\nobjection that a due process claim might involve close\nquestions concerning whether a judicial decree extends\nbeyond what owners might have expected is not a sound\nargument; for the same close questions would arise with\nrespect to whether a judicial decision is a taking. See\nApfel, supra, at 541 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.) (“Cases\nattempting to decide when a regulation becomes a taking\nare among the most litigated and perplexing in current\nlaw”); Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438\nU. S. 104, 123 (1978) (“The question of what constitutes a\n‘taking’ for purposes of the Fifth Amendment has proved\nto be a problem of considerable difficulty”).\n   To announce that courts too can effect a taking when\nthey decide cases involving property rights, would raise\ncertain difficult questions. Since this case does not require\nthose questions to be addressed, in my respectful view, the\nCourt should not reach beyond the necessities of the case\nto announce a sweeping rule that court decisions can be\ntakings, as that phrase is used in the Takings Clause. The\nevident reason for recognizing a judicial takings doctrine\nwould be to constrain the power of the judicial branch. Of\ncourse, the judiciary must respect private ownership. But\nwere this Court to say that judicial decisions become\ntakings when they overreach, this might give more power\nto courts, not less.\n   Consider the instance of litigation between two property\nowners to determine which one bears the liability and\ncosts when a tree that stands on one property extends its\nroots in a way that damages adjacent property. See, e.g.,\nFancher v. Fagella, 274 Va. 549, 650 S. E. 2d 519 (2007).\nIf a court deems that, in light of increasing urbanization,\nthe former rule for allocation of these costs should be\nchanged, thus shifting the rights of the owners, it may\nwell increase the value of one property and decrease the\nvalue of the other. This might be the type of incremental\n6     STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n        IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                   Opinion of KENNEDY, J. \n\n\nmodification under state common law that does not violate\ndue process, as owners may reasonably expect or antici\npate courts to make certain changes in property law. The\nusual due process constraint is that courts cannot abandon\nsettled principles. See, e.g., Rogers v. Tennessee, 532 U. S.\n451, 457 (2001) (citing Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U. S.\n347, 354 (1964)); Apfel, 524 U. S., at 548–549 (opinion of\nKENNEDY, J.); see also Perry, supra, at 601; Roth, supra,\nat 577.\n   But if the state court were deemed to be exercising the\npower to take property, that constraint would be removed.\nBecause the State would be bound to pay owners for tak\nings caused by a judicial decision, it is conceivable that\nsome judges might decide that enacting a sweeping new\nrule to adjust the rights of property owners in the context\nof changing social needs is a good idea. Knowing that the\nresulting ruling would be a taking, the courts could go\nahead with their project, free from constraints that would\notherwise confine their power. The resulting judgment as\nbetween the property owners likely could not be set aside\nby some later enactment. See Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm,\nInc., 514 U. S. 211, 217 (1995) (leaving open whether\nlegislation reopening final judgments violates Due Process\nClause). And if the litigation were a class action to decide,\nfor instance, whether there are public rights of access that\ndiminish the rights of private ownership, a State might\nfind itself obligated to pay a substantial judgment for the\njudicial ruling. Even if the legislature were to subse\nquently rescind the judicial decision by statute, the State\nwould still have to pay just compensation for the tempo\nrary taking that occurred from the time of the judicial\ndecision to the time of the statutory fix. See First English,\n482 U. S., at 321.\n   The idea, then, that a judicial takings doctrine would\nconstrain judges might just well have the opposite effect.\nIt would give judges new power and new assurance that\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nchanges in property rights that are beneficial, or thought\nto be so, are fair and proper because just compensation\nwill be paid. The judiciary historically has not had the\nright or responsibility to say what property should or\nshould not be taken.\n   Indeed, it is unclear whether the Takings Clause was\nunderstood, as a historical matter, to apply to judicial\ndecisions. The Framers most likely viewed this Clause as\napplying only to physical appropriation pursuant to the\npower of eminent domain. See Lucas v. South Carolina\nCoastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 1028, n. 15 (1992). And it\nappears these physical appropriations were traditionally\nmade by legislatures. See 3 J. Story, Commentaries on\nthe Constitution of the United States §1784, p. 661 (1833).\nCourts, on the other hand, lacked the power of eminent\ndomain. See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 135 (W.\nLewis ed. 1897). The Court’s Takings Clause jurispru\ndence has expanded beyond the Framers’ understanding,\nas it now applies to certain regulations that are not physi\ncal appropriations. See Lucas, supra, at 1014 (citing\nMahon, 260 U. S. 393). But the Court should consider\nwith care the decision to extend the Takings Clause in\na manner that might be inconsistent with historical\npractice.\n   There are two additional practical considerations that\nthe Court would need to address before recognizing judi\ncial takings. First, it may be unclear in certain situations\nhow a party should properly raise a judicial takings claim.\n“[I]t is important to separate out two judicial actions—the\ndecision to change current property rules in a way that\nwould constitute a taking, and the decision to require\ncompensation.”      Thompson, Judicial Takings, 76 Va.\nL. Rev. 1449, 1515 (1990). In some contexts, these issues\ncould arise separately. For instance, assume that a state\ncourt opinion explicitly holds that it is changing state\nproperty law, or that it asserts that is not changing the\n8     STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- \n\n        IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \n\n                   Opinion of KENNEDY, J. \n\n\nlaw but there is no “fair or substantial basis” for this\nstatement. Broad River, 281 U. S., at 540. (Most of these\ncases may arise in the latter posture, like inverse condem\nnation claims where the State says it is not taking prop\nerty and pays no compensation.) Call this Case A. The\nonly issue in Case A was determining the substance of\nstate property law. It is doubtful that parties would raise\na judicial takings claim on appeal, or in a petition for a\nwrit of certiorari, in Case A, as the issue would not have\nbeen litigated below. Rather, the party may file a sepa\nrate lawsuit—Case B—arguing that a taking occurred in\nlight of the change in property law made by Case A. After\nall, until the state court in Case A changes the law, the\nparty will not know if his or her property rights will have\nbeen eliminated. So res judicata probably would not bar\nthe party from litigating the takings issue in Case B.\n   Second, it is unclear what remedy a reviewing court\ncould enter after finding a judicial taking. It appears\nunder our precedents that a party who suffers a taking is\nonly entitled to damages, not equitable relief: The Court\nhas said that “[e]quitable relief is not available to enjoin\nan alleged taking of private property for a public use . . .\nwhen a suit for compensation can be brought against the\nsovereign subsequent to the taking,” Ruckelshaus v. Mon\nsanto Co., 467 U. S. 986, 1016 (1984), and the Court sub\nsequently held that the Takings Clause requires the avail\nability of a suit for compensation against the States, First\nEnglish, supra, at 321–322. It makes perfect sense that\nthe remedy for a Takings Clause violation is only dam\nages, as the Clause “does not proscribe the taking of prop\nerty; it proscribes taking without just compensation.”\nWilliamson County Regional Planning Comm’n v. Hamil\nton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172, 194 (1985).\n   It is thus questionable whether reviewing courts could\ninvalidate judicial decisions deemed to be judicial takings;\nthey may only be able to order just compensation. In the\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nposture discussed above where Case A changes the law\nand Case B addresses whether that change is a taking, it\nis not clear how the Court, in Case B, could invalidate the\nholding of Case A. If a single case were to properly ad\ndress both a state court’s change in the law and whether\nthe change was a taking, the Court might be able to give\nthe state court a choice on how to proceed if there were a\njudicial taking. The Court might be able to remand and\nlet the state court determine whether it wants to insist on\nchanging its property law and paying just compensation or\nto rescind its holding that changed the law. Cf. First\nEnglish, 482 U. S., at 321 (“Once a court determines that a\ntaking has occurred, the government retains the whole\nrange of options already available—amendment of the\nregulation, withdrawal of the invalidated regulation, or\nexercise of eminent domain”). But that decision would\nrest with the state court, not this Court; so the state court\ncould still force the State to pay just compensation. And\neven if the state court decided to rescind its decision that\nchanged the law, a temporary taking would have occurred\nin the interim. See ibid.\n   These difficult issues are some of the reasons why the\nCourt should not reach beyond the necessities of the case\nto recognize a judicial takings doctrine. It is not wise,\nfrom an institutional standpoint, to reach out and decide\nquestions that have not been discussed at much length by\ncourts and commentators. This Court’s dicta in William\nson County, supra, at 194–197, regarding when regulatory\ntakings claims become ripe, explains why federal courts\nhave not been able to provide much analysis on the issue\nof judicial takings. See San Remo Hotel, L. P. v. City and\nCounty of San Francisco, 545 U. S. 323, 351 (2005)\n(Rehnquist, C.

If and when\nfuture cases show that the usual principles, including\nconstitutional principles that constrain the judiciary like\ndue process, are somehow inadequate to protect property\nowners, then the question whether a judicial decision can\neffect a taking would be properly presented. In the mean\ntime, it seems appropriate to recognize that the substan\ntial power to decide whose property to take and when to\ntake it should be conceived of as a power vested in the\npolitical branches and subject to political control.\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

I cannot join Parts II and III, how\never, for in those Parts the plurality unnecessarily ad\ndresses questions of constitutional law that are better left\nfor another day.\n   In Part II of its opinion, see ante, at 7–10, the plurality\nconcludes that courts, including federal courts, may review\nthe private property law decisions of state courts to de\ntermine whether the decisions unconstitutionally take\n“private property” for “public use without just compensa\ntion.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. And in doing so it finds\n“irrelevant” that the “particular state actor” that takes\nprivate property (or unconstitutionally redefines state\nproperty law) is the judicial branch, rather than the ex\necutive or legislative branch.

The plurality further concludes that a\nstate-court decision violates the Takings Clause not when\nthe decision is “unpredictab[le]” on the basis of prior law,\nbut rather when the decision takes private property rights\nthat are “established.” Ante, at 23–24. And finally, it\nconcludes that all those affected by a state-court property\nlaw decision can raise a takings claim in federal court, but\nfor the losing party in the initial state-court proceeding,\nwho can only raise her claim (possibly for the first time) in\na petition for a writ of certiorari here. Ante, at 23.\n   I do not claim that all of these conclusions are unsound.\nI do not know. But I do know that, if we were to express\nour views on these questions, we would invite a host of\nfederal takings claims without the mature consideration of\npotential procedural or substantive legal principles that\nmight limit federal interference in matters that are pri\nmarily the subject of state law. Property owners litigate\nmany thousands of cases involving state property law in\nstate courts each year. Each state-court property decision\nmay further affect numerous nonparty property owners as\nwell. Losing parties in many state-court cases may well\nbelieve that erroneous judicial decisions have deprived\nthem of property rights they previously held and may\nconsequently bring federal takings claims. And a glance\nat Part IV makes clear that such cases can involve state\nproperty law issues of considerable complexity. Hence, the\napproach the plurality would take today threatens to open\nthe federal court doors to constitutional review of many,\nperhaps large numbers of, state-law cases in an area of\nlaw familiar to state, but not federal, judges. And the\nfailure of that approach to set forth procedural limitations\nor canons of deference would create the distinct possibility\nthat federal judges would play a major role in the shaping\nof a matter of significant state interest—state property\nlaw.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

That is simply what I would do here.\n   In the past, Members of this Court have warned us that,\nwhen faced with difficult constitutional questions, we\nshould “confine ourselves to deciding only what is neces\nsary to the disposition of the immediate case.” Whitehouse\nv. Illinois Central R. Co., 349 U. S. 366, 373 (1955); see\nalso Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Assn.,\n485 U. S. 439, 445 (1988) (“A fundamental and longstand\ning principle of judicial restraint requires that courts\navoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the\nnecessity of deciding them”); Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S.\n288, 346–347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (“The Court\nwill not anticipate a question of constitutional law in\nadvance of the necessity of deciding it. It is not the habit\nof the Court to decide questions of a constitutional nature\nunless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case”\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). I heed\nthis advice here. There is no need now to decide more\nthan what the Court decides in Parts IV and V, namely,\nthat the Florida Supreme Court’s decision in this case did\nnot amount to a “judicial taking.”\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/148798/", "sha1": "49724dd3aaddd00603b9886ff7866c4c5e13b7a1", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2009-073", "time_retrieved": "2010-06-17T09:50:56"}
