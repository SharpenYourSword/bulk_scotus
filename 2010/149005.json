Argued April 27, 2010—Decided June 21, 2010\nThe Plant Protection Act (PPA) provides that the Secretary of the De\n  partment of Agriculture may issue regulations “to prevent the intro\n  duction of plant pests into the United States or the dissemination of\n  plant pests within the United States.” 7 U. S. C. §7711(a). Pursuant\n  to that grant of authority, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection\n  Service (APHIS) promulgated regulations that presume genetically\n  engineered plants to be “plant pests”—and thus “regulated articles”\n  under the PPA—until APHIS determines otherwise. However, any\n  person may petition APHIS for a determination that a regulated arti\n  cle does not present a plant pest risk and therefore should not be sub\n  ject to the applicable regulations. APHIS may grant such a petition\n  in whole or in part.\n     In determining whether to grant nonregulated status to a geneti\n  cally engineered plant variety, APHIS must comply with the Na\n  tional Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), which requires fed\n  eral agencies “to the fullest extent possible” to prepare a detailed\n  environmental impact statement (EIS) for “every . . . major Federal\n  actio[n] significantly affecting the quality of the human environ\n  ment.” 42 U. S. C. §4332(2)(C). The agency need not complete an\n  EIS if it finds, based on a shorter statement known as an environ\n  mental assessment (EA), that the proposed action will not have a\n  significant environmental impact.\n     This case involves a challenge to APHIS’s decision to approve the\n  unconditional deregulation of Roundup Ready Alfalfa (RRA), a vari\n  ety of alfalfa that has been genetically engineered to tolerate the her\n  bicide Roundup. Petitioners are the owner and the licensee of the in\n  tellectual property rights to RRA. In response to petitioners’\n2            MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    deregulation request, APHIS prepared a draft EA and solicited public\n    comments on its proposed course of action. Based on its EA and the\n    comments submitted, the agency determined that the introduction of\n    RRA would not have any significant adverse impact on the environ\n    ment. Accordingly, APHIS decided to deregulate RRA uncondition\n    ally and without preparing an EIS. Respondents, conventional al\n    falfa growers and environmental groups, filed this action challenging\n    that decision on the ground that it violated NEPA and other federal\n    laws. The District Court held, inter alia, that APHIS violated NEPA\n    when it deregulated RRA without first completing a detailed EIS. To\n    remedy that violation, the court vacated the agency’s decision com\n    pletely deregulating RRA; enjoined APHIS from deregulating RRA,\n    in whole or in part, pending completion of the EIS; and entered a na\n    tionwide permanent injunction prohibiting almost all future planting\n    of RRA during the pendency of the EIS process. Petitioners and the\n    Government appealed, challenging the scope of the relief granted but\n    not disputing that APHIS’s deregulation decision violated NEPA.\n    The Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding, among other things, that the\n    District Court had not abused its discretion in rejecting APHIS’s pro\n    posed mitigation measures in favor of a broader injunction.\nHeld:\n    1. Respondents have standing to seek injunctive relief, and peti\n tioners have standing to seek this Court’s review of the Ninth Cir\n cuit’s judgment affirming the entry of such relief. Pp. 7–14.\n       (a) Petitioners have constitutional standing to seek review here.\n Article III standing requires an injury that is (i) concrete, particular\n ized, and actual or imminent, (ii) fairly traceable to the challenged\n action, and (iii) redressable by a favorable ruling. See Horne v. Flo\n res, 557 U. S. ___, ___. Petitioners satisfy all three criteria. Petition\n ers are injured by their inability to sell or license RRA to prospective\n customers until APHIS completes the EIS. Because that injury is\n caused by the very remedial order that petitioners challenge on ap\n peal, it would be redressed by a favorable ruling from this Court. Re\n spondents nevertheless contend that petitioners lack standing be\n cause their complained-of injury is independently caused by a part of\n the District Court’s order that petitioners failed to challenge, the va\n catur of APHIS’s deregulation decision. That argument fails for two\n independent reasons. First, one of the main disputes between the\n parties throughout this litigation has been whether the District\n Court should have adopted APHIS’s proposed judgment, which would\n have replaced the vacated deregulation decision with an order ex\n pressly authorizing the continued sale and planting of RRA. Accord\n ingly, if the District Court had adopted APHIS’s proposed judgment,\n there would still be authority for the continued sale of RRA notwith\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nstanding the District Court’s vacatur, because there would, in effect,\nbe a new deregulation decision. Second, petitioners in any case have\nstanding to challenge the part of the District Court’s order enjoining\na partial deregulation. Respondents focus their argument on the part\nof the judgment that enjoins planting, but the judgment also states\nthat before granting the deregulation petition, even in part, the\nagency must prepare an EIS. That part of the judgment inflicts an\ninjury not also caused by the vacatur. Pp. 7–11.\n      (b) Respondents have constitutional standing to seek injunctive\nrelief from the complete deregulation order at issue here. The Court\ndisagrees with petitioners’ argument that respondents have failed to\nshow that any of them is likely to suffer a constitutionally cognizable\ninjury absent injunctive relief. The District Court found that respon\ndent farmers had established a reasonable probability that their con\nventional alfalfa crops would be infected with the engineered\nRoundup Ready gene if RRA were completely deregulated. A sub\nstantial risk of such gene flow injures respondents in several ways\nthat are sufficiently concrete to satisfy the injury-in-fact prong of the\nconstitutional standing analysis. Moreover, those harms are readily\nattributable to APHIS’s deregulation decision, which gives rise to a\nsignificant risk of gene flow to non-genetically-engineered alfalfa va\nrieties. Finally, a judicial order prohibiting the planting or deregula\ntion of all or some genetically engineered alfalfa would redress re\nspondents’ injuries by eliminating or minimizing the risk of gene flow\nto their crops. Pp. 11–14.\n   2. The District Court abused its discretion in enjoining APHIS from\neffecting a partial deregulation and in prohibiting the planting of\nRRA pending the agency’s completion of its detailed environmental\nreview. Pp. 14–22.\n      (a) Because petitioners and the Government do not argue other\nwise, the Court assumes without deciding that the District Court\nacted lawfully in vacating the agency’s decision to completely deregu\nlate RRA. The Court therefore addresses only the injunction prohib\niting APHIS from deregulating RRA pending completion of the EIS,\nand the nationwide injunction prohibiting almost all RRA planting\nduring the pendency of the EIS process. P. 14.\n      (b) Before a court may grant a permanent injunction, the plain\ntiff must satisfy a four-factor test, demonstrating: “(1) that it has suf\nfered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such\nas monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury;\n(3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff\nand defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the pub\nlic interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.” eBay\nInc. v. MercExchange, L. L. C., 547 U. S. 388, 391. This test fully ap\n4            MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    plies in NEPA cases. See Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Coun\n    cil, Inc., 555 U. S. ___, ___. Thus, the existence of a NEPA violation\n    does not create a presumption that injunctive relief is available and\n    should be granted absent unusual circumstances. Pp. 15–16.\n          (c) None of the four factors supports the District Court’s order en\n    joining APHIS from partially deregulating RRA during the pendency\n    of the EIS process. Most importantly, respondents cannot show that\n    they will suffer irreparable injury if APHIS is allowed to proceed with\n    any partial deregulation, for at least two reasons. First, if and when\n    APHIS pursues a partial deregulation that arguably runs afoul of\n    NEPA, respondents may file a new suit challenging such action and\n    seeking appropriate preliminary relief. Accordingly, a permanent in\n    junction is not now needed to guard against any present or imminent\n    risk of likely irreparable harm. Second, a partial deregulation need\n    not cause respondents any injury at all; if its scope is sufficiently lim\n    ited, the risk of gene flow could be virtually nonexistent. Indeed, the\n    broad injunction entered below essentially pre-empts the very proce\n    dure by which APHIS could determine, independently of the pending\n    EIS process for assessing the effects of a complete deregulation, that\n    a limited deregulation would not pose any appreciable risk of envi\n    ronmental harm. Pp. 16–23.\n          (d) The District Court also erred in entering the nationwide in\n    junction against planting RRA, for two independent reasons. First,\n    because it was inappropriate for the District Court to foreclose even\n    the possibility of a partial and temporary deregulation, it follows that\n    it was inappropriate to enjoin planting in accordance with such a de\n    regulation decision. Second, an injunction is a drastic and extraordi\n    nary remedy, which should not be granted as a matter of course. See,\n    e.g., Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S. 305, 312. If, as respon\n    dents now concede, a less drastic remedy (such as partial or complete\n    vacatur of APHIS’s deregulation decision) was sufficient to redress\n    their injury, no recourse to the additional and extraordinary relief of\n    an injunction was warranted. Pp. 23–24.\n          (e) Given the District Court’s errors, this Court need not address\n    whether injunctive relief of some kind was available to respondents\n    on the record below.

The District\nCourt held that APHIS violated the National Environ­\nmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 83 Stat. 852, 42\nU. S. C. §4321 et seq., by issuing its deregulation deci­\nsion without first completing a detailed assessment of\nthe environmental consequences of its proposed course of\naction. To remedy that violation, the District Court\nvacated the agency’s decision completely deregulating\nthe alfalfa variety in question; ordered APHIS not to act\non the deregulation petition in whole or in part until it\nhad completed a detailed environmental review; and\nenjoined almost all future planting of the genetically\nengineered alfalfa pending the completion of that review.\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s entry\nof permanent injunctive relief. The main issue now in\ndispute concerns the breadth of that relief. For the\nreasons set forth below, we reverse and remand for\nfurther proceedings.\n2        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  The Plant Protection Act (PPA), 114 Stat. 438, 7 U. S. C.\n§7701 et seq., provides that the Secretary of the Depart­\nment of Agriculture (USDA) may issue regulations “to\nprevent the introduction of plant pests into the United\nStates or the dissemination of plant pests within the\nUnited States.” §7711(a). The Secretary has delegated\nthat authority to APHIS, a division of the USDA. 7 CFR\n§§2.22(a), 2.80(a)(36) (2010). Acting pursuant to that\ndelegation, APHIS has promulgated regulations governing\n“the introduction of organisms and products altered or\nproduced through genetic engineering that are plant pests\nor are believed to be plant pests.” See §340.0(a)(2) and\nn. 1. Under those regulations, certain genetically engi­\nneered plants are presumed to be “plant pests”—and thus\n“regulated articles” under the PPA—until APHIS deter­\nmines otherwise. See ibid.; §§340.1, 340.2, 340.6; see also\nApp. 183. However, any person may petition APHIS for a\ndetermination that a regulated article does not present a\nplant pest risk and therefore should not be subject to the\napplicable regulations. 7 U. S. C. §7711(c)(2); 7 CFR\n§340.6. APHIS may grant such a petition in whole or in\npart. §340.6(d)(3).\n  In deciding whether to grant nonregulated status to a\ngenetically engineered plant variety, APHIS must comply\nwith NEPA, which requires federal agencies “to the fullest\nextent possible” to prepare an environmental impact\nstatement (EIS) for “every recommendation or report on\nproposals for legislation and other major Federal actio[n]\nsignificantly affecting the quality of the human environ­\nment.”    42 U. S. C. §4332(2)(C).     The statutory text\n“speaks solely in terms of proposed actions; it does not\nrequire an agency to consider the possible environmental\nimpacts of less imminent actions when preparing the\nimpact statement on proposed actions.” Kleppe v. Sierra\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nClub, 427 U. S. 390, 410, n. 20 (1976).\n  An agency need not complete an EIS for a particular\nproposal if it finds, on the basis of a shorter “environ­\nmental assessment” (EA), that the proposed action will not\nhave a significant impact on the environment. 40 CFR\n§§1508.9(a), 1508.13 (2009). Even if a particular agency\nproposal requires an EIS, applicable regulations allow the\nagency to take at least some action in furtherance of that\nproposal while the EIS is being prepared. See §1506.1(a)\n(“no action concerning the proposal shall be taken which\nwould: (1) Have an adverse environmental impact; or (2)\nLimit the choice of reasonable alternatives”); §1506.1(c)\n(“While work on a required program environmental impact\nstatement is in progress and the action is not covered by\nan existing program statement, agencies shall not under­\ntake in the interim any major Federal action covered by\nthe program which may significantly affect the quality of\nthe human environment unless such action” satisfies\ncertain requirements).\n                             B\n   This case involves Roundup Ready Alfalfa (RRA), a kind\nof alfalfa crop that has been genetically engineered to be\ntolerant of glyphosate, the active ingredient of the herbi­\ncide Roundup. Petitioner Monsanto Company (Monsanto)\nowns the intellectual property rights to RRA. Monsanto\nlicenses those rights to co-petitioner Forage Genetics\nInternational (FGI), which is the exclusive developer of\nRRA seed.\n   APHIS initially classified RRA as a regulated article,\nbut in 2004 petitioners sought nonregulated status for two\nstrains of RRA. In response, APHIS prepared a draft EA\nassessing the likely environmental impact of the requested\nderegulation. It then published a notice in the Federal\nRegister advising the public of the deregulation petition\nand soliciting public comments on its draft EA. After\n4        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconsidering the hundreds of public comments that it re­\nceived, APHIS issued a Finding of No Significant Impact\nand decided to deregulate RRA unconditionally and with­\nout preparing an EIS. Prior to this decision, APHIS had\nauthorized almost 300 field trials of RRA conducted over a\nperiod of eight years. App. 348.\n   Approximately eight months after APHIS granted RRA\nnonregulated status, respondents (two conventional alfalfa\nseed farms and environmental groups concerned with food\nsafety) filed this action against the Secretary of Agricul­\nture and certain other officials in Federal District Court,\nchallenging APHIS’s decision to completely deregulate\nRRA. Their complaint alleged violations of NEPA, the\nEndangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), 87 Stat. 884, 16\nU. S. C. §1531 et seq., and the PPA. Respondents did not\nseek preliminary injunctive relief pending resolution of\nthose claims. Hence, RRA enjoyed nonregulated status for\napproximately two years. During that period, more than\n3,000 farmers in 48 States planted an estimated 220,000\nacres of RRA. App. 350.\n   In resolving respondents’ NEPA claim, the District\nCourt accepted APHIS’s determination that RRA does not\nhave any harmful health effects on humans or livestock.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 43a; accord, id., at 45a. Neverthe­\nless, the District Court held that APHIS violated NEPA by\nderegulating RRA without first preparing an EIS. In\nparticular, the court found that APHIS’s EA failed to\nanswer substantial questions concerning two broad conse­\nquences of its proposed action: first, the extent to which\ncomplete deregulation would lead to the transmission of\nthe gene conferring glyphosate tolerance from RRA to\norganic and conventional alfalfa; and, second, the extent to\nwhich the introduction of RRA would contribute to the\ndevelopment of Roundup-resistant weeds. Id., at 52a. In\nlight of its determination that the deregulation decision\nran afoul of NEPA, the District Court dismissed without\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprejudice respondents’ claims under the ESA and PPA.\n   After these rulings, the District Court granted petition­\ners permission to intervene in the remedial phase of the\nlawsuit. The court then asked the parties to submit pro­\nposed judgments embodying their preferred means of\nremedying the NEPA violation. APHIS’s proposed judg­\nment would have ordered the agency to prepare an EIS,\nvacated the agency’s deregulation decision, and replaced\nthat decision with the terms of the judgment itself. Id., at\n184a (proposed judgment providing that “[the federal]\ndefendants’ [June 14,] 2005 Determination of Nonregu­\nlated Status for Alfalfa Genetically Engineered for Toler­\nance to the Herbicide Glyphosate is hereby vacated and\nreplaced by the terms of this judgment” (emphasis added)).\nThe terms of the proposed judgment, in turn, would have\npermitted the continued planting of RRA pending comple­\ntion of the EIS, subject to six restrictions. Those restric­\ntions included, among other things, mandatory isolation\ndistances between RRA and non-genetically-engineered\nalfalfa fields in order to mitigate the risk of gene flow;\nmandatory harvesting conditions; a requirement that\nplanting and harvesting equipment that had been in\ncontact with RRA be cleaned prior to any use with conven­\ntional or organic alfalfa; identification and handling re­\nquirements for RRA seed; and a requirement that all RRA\nseed producers and hay growers be under contract with\neither Monsanto or FGI and that their contracts require\ncompliance with the other limitations set out in the pro­\nposed judgment.\n   The District Court rejected APHIS’s proposed judgment.\nIn its preliminary injunction, the District Court prohibited\nalmost all future planting of RRA pending APHIS’s com­\npletion of the required EIS. But in order to minimize the\nharm to farmers who had relied on APHIS’s deregulation\ndecision, the court expressly allowed those who had al­\nready purchased RRA to plant their seeds until March 30,\n6        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n2007. Id., at 58a. In its subsequently entered permanent\ninjunction and judgment, the court (1) vacated APHIS’s\nderegulation decision; (2) ordered APHIS to prepare an\nEIS before it made any decision on Monsanto’s deregula­\ntion petition; (3) enjoined the planting of any RRA in the\nUnited States after March 30, 2007, pending APHIS’s\ncompletion of the required EIS; and (4) imposed certain\nconditions (suggested by APHIS) on the handling and\nidentification of already-planted RRA. Id., at 79a, 109a.\nThe District Court denied petitioners’ request for an evi­\ndentiary hearing.\n   The Government, Monsanto, and FGI appealed, chal­\nlenging the scope of the relief granted but not disputing\nthe existence of a NEPA violation. See Geertson Seed\nFarms v. Johanns, 570 F. 3d 1130, 1136 (2009). A divided\npanel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit af­\nfirmed. Based on its review of the record, the panel first\nconcluded that the District Court had “recognized that an\ninjunction does not ‘automatically issue’ when a NEPA\nviolation is found” and had instead based its issuance of\ninjunctive relief on the four-factor test traditionally used\nfor that purpose. Id., at 1137. The panel held that the\nDistrict Court had not committed clear error in making\nany of the subsidiary factual findings on which its assess­\nment of the four relevant factors was based. And the\npanel rejected the claim that the District Court had not\ngiven sufficient deference to APHIS’s expertise concerning\nthe likely effects of allowing continued planting of RRA on\na limited basis. In the panel’s view, APHIS’s proposed\ninterim measures would have perpetuated a system that\nhad been found by the District Court to have caused envi­\nronmental harm in the past. Id., at 1139. Hence, the\npanel concluded that the District Court had not abused its\ndiscretion “in choosing to reject APHIS’s proposed mitiga­\ntion measures in favor of a broader injunction to prevent\nmore irreparable harm from occurring.” Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

Writing in dissent, Judge N. Randy Smith\ndisagreed with that conclusion. In his view, the District\nCourt was required to conduct an evidentiary hearing\nbefore issuing a permanent injunction unless the facts\nwere undisputed or the adverse party expressly waived its\nright to such a hearing. Neither of those two exceptions,\nhe found, applied here.\n  We granted certiorari. 558 U.

Petitioners are injured by their\ninability to sell or license RRA to prospective customers\nuntil such time as APHIS completes the required EIS.\nBecause that injury is caused by the very remedial order\nthat petitioners challenge on appeal, it would be redressed\nby a favorable ruling from this Court.\n   Respondents do not dispute that petitioners would have\nstanding to contest the District Court’s permanent injunc­\ntion order if they had pursued a different litigation strat­\negy. Instead, respondents argue that the injury of which\npetitioners complain is independently caused by a part of\nthe District Court’s order that petitioners failed to chal­\nlenge, namely, the vacatur of APHIS’s deregulation deci­\nsion. The practical consequence of the vacatur, respon­\n8        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndents contend, was to restore RRA to the status of a regu­\nlated article; and, subject to certain exceptions not appli­\ncable here, federal regulations ban the growth and sale of\nregulated articles. Because petitioners did not specifically\nchallenge the District Court’s vacatur, respondents reason,\nthey lack standing to challenge a part of the District\nCourt’s order (i.e., the injunction) that does not cause\npetitioners any injury not also caused by the vacatur. See\nBrief for Respondents 19–20.\n   Respondents’ argument fails for two independent rea­\nsons. First, although petitioners did not challenge the\nvacatur directly, they adequately preserved their objection\nthat the vacated deregulation decision should have been\nreplaced by APHIS’s proposed injunction. Throughout the\nremedial phase of this litigation, one of the main disputes\nbetween the parties has been whether the District Court\nwas required to adopt APHIS’s proposed judgment. See,\ne.g., Intervenor-Appellants’ Opening Brief in No. 07–16458\netc. (CA9), p. 59 (urging the Court of Appeals to “vacate\nthe district court’s judgment and remand this case to the\ndistrict court with instructions to enter APHIS’s proposed\nrelief”); Opening Brief of Federal Defendants-Appellants\nin No. 16458 etc. (CA9), pp. 21, 46 (“The blanket injunc­\ntion should be narrowed in accordance with APHIS’s\nproposal”); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, 25–27, 53–54. That\njudgment would have replaced the vacated deregulation\ndecision with an order expressly allowing continued plant­\ning of RRA subject to certain limited conditions. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 184a (proposed judgment providing that\n“[the federal] defendants’ 14 June 2005 Determination of\nNonregulated Status for Alfalfa Genetically Engineered\nfor Tolerance to the Herbicide Glyphosate is hereby va­\ncated and replaced by the terms of this judgment” (empha­\nsis added)). Accordingly, if the District Court had adopted\nthe agency’s suggested remedy, there would still be au­\nthority for the continued planting of RRA, because there\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  9\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nwould, in effect, be a new deregulation decision.1\n   Second, petitioners in any case have standing to chal­\nlenge the part of the District Court’s order enjoining par­\ntial deregulation. Respondents focus their standing ar­\ngument on the part of the judgment enjoining the planting\nof RRA, but the judgment also states that “[b]efore grant­\ning Monsanto’s deregulation petition, even in part, the\nfederal defendants shall prepare an environmental impact\nstatement.” Id., at 108a (emphasis added); see also id., at\n79a (“The Court will enter a final judgment . . . ordering\nthe government to prepare an EIS before it makes a deci­\nsion on Monsanto’s deregulation petition”). As respon­\ndents concede, that part of the judgment goes beyond the\nvacatur of APHIS’s deregulation decision. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 37, 46.\n   At oral argument, respondents contended that the re­\ntriction on APHIS’s ability to effect a partial deregulation\nof RRA does not cause petitioners “an actual or an immi­\nnent harm.” Id., at 39–40. In order for a partial deregula­\ntion to occur, respondents argued, the case would have to\nbe remanded to the agency, and APHIS would have to\nprepare an EA “that may or may not come out in favor of a\npartial deregulation.” Id., at 39. Because petitioners\ncannot prove that those two events would happen, respon­\ndents contended, the asserted harm caused by the District\nCourt’s partial deregulation ban is too speculative to\nsatisfy the actual or imminent injury requirement.\n   We reject this argument. If the injunction were lifted,\nwe do not see why the District Court would have to re­\nmand the matter to the agency in order for APHIS to\neffect a partial deregulation. And even if a remand were\n\n——————\n  1 We need not decide whether the District Court had the authority to\nreplace the vacated agency order with an injunction of its own making.\nThe question whether petitioners are entitled to the relief that they\nseek goes to the merits, not to standing.\n10        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrequired, we perceive no basis on which the District Court\ncould decline to remand the matter to the agency so that it\ncould determine whether to pursue a partial deregulation\nduring the pendency of the EIS process.\n   Nor is any doubt as to whether APHIS would issue a\nnew EA in favor of a partial deregulation sufficient to\ndefeat petitioners’ standing. It is undisputed that peti­\ntioners have submitted a deregulation petition and that a\npartial deregulation of the kind embodied in the agency’s\nproposed judgment would afford petitioners much of the\nrelief that they seek; it is also undisputed that, absent the\nDistrict Court’s order, APHIS could attempt to effect such\na partial deregulation pending its completion of the EIS.\nSee id., at 7–8, 25–27, 38. For purposes of resolving the\nparticular standing question before us, we need not decide\nwhether or to what extent a party challenging an injunc­\ntion that bars an agency from granting certain relief must\nshow that the agency would be likely to afford such relief\nif it were free to do so. In this case, as is clear from\nAPHIS’s proposed judgment and from its briefing\nthroughout the remedial phase of this litigation, the\nagency takes the view that a partial deregulation reflect­\ning its proposed limitations is in the public interest. Thus,\nthere is more than a strong likelihood that APHIS would\npartially deregulate RRA were it not for the District\nCourt’s injunction. The District Court’s elimination of\nthat likelihood is plainly sufficient to establish a constitu­\ntionally cognizable injury. Moreover, as respondents\nessentially conceded at oral argument, that injury would\nbe redressed by a favorable decision here, since “vacating\nthe current injunction . . . will allow [petitioners] to go\nback to the agency, [to] seek a partial deregulation,” even\nif the District Court’s vacatur of APHIS’s deregulation\ndecision is left intact. Id., at 38. We therefore hold that\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npetitioners have standing to seek this Court’s review.2\n                              B\n   We next consider petitioners’ contention that respon­\ndents lack standing to seek injunctive relief. See Daim\nlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332, 352 (2006) (“[A]\nplaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for each\nform of relief sought” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nPetitioners argue that respondents have failed to show\nthat any of the named respondents is likely to suffer a\nconstitutionally cognizable injury absent injunctive relief.\nSee Brief for Petitioners 40. We disagree.\n   Respondents include conventional alfalfa farmers.\nEmphasizing “the undisputed concentration of alfalfa seed\nfarms,” the District Court found that those farmers had\n“established a ‘reasonable probability’ that their organic\nand conventional alfalfa crops will be infected with the\nengineered gene” if RRA is completely deregulated. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 50a.3 A substantial risk of gene flow\n——————\n   2 We do not rest “the primary basis for our jurisdiction on the premise\n\nthat the District Court enjoined APHIS from partially deregulating\nRRA in any sense.” See post, at 7 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Even if the\nDistrict Court’s order prohibiting a partial deregulation applies only to\n“the particular partial deregulation order proposed to the court by\nAPHIS,” see post, at 8, petitioners would still have standing to chal­\nlenge that aspect of the order.\n   3At least one of the respondents in this case specifically alleges that\n\nhe owns an alfalfa farm in a prominent seed-growing region and faces a\nsignificant risk of contamination from RRA. See Record, Doc. 62, pp. 1–\n2; id., ¶10, at 3–4 (Declaration of Phillip Geertson in Support of Plan­\ntiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment) (“Since alfalfa is pollinated by\nhoney, bumble and leafcutter bees, the genetic contamination of the\nRoundup Ready seed will rapidly spread through the seed growing\nregions. Bees have a range of at least two to ten miles, and the alfalfa\nseed farms are much more concentrated”). Other declarations in the\nrecord provide further support for the District Court’s conclusion that\nthe deregulation of RRA poses a significant risk of contamination to\nrespondents’ crops. See, e.g., id., Doc. 53, ¶9, at 2 (Declaration of Jim\nMunsch) (alleging risk of “significant contamination . . . due to the\n12         MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ninjures respondents in several ways. For example, re­\nspondents represent that, in order to continue marketing\ntheir product to consumers who wish to buy non­\ngenetically-engineered alfalfa, respondents would have to\nconduct testing to find out whether and to what extent\ntheir crops have been contaminated. See, e.g., Record,\nDoc. 62, p. 5 (Declaration of Phillip Geertson in Support of\nPlantiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment) (hereinafter\nGeertson Declaration) (“Due to the high potential for\ncontamination, I will need to test my crops for the pres­\nence of genetically engineered alfalfa seed. This testing\nwill be a new cost to my seed business and we will have to\nraise our seed prices to cover these costs, making our\nprices less competitive”); id., Doc. 57, p. 4 (Declaration of\nPatrick Trask in Support of Plantiff’s Motion for Summary\nJudgment) (“To ensure that my seeds are pure, I will need\nto test my crops and obtain certification that my seeds are\nfree of genetically engineered alfalfa”); see also Record,\nDoc. 55, p. 2 (“There is zero tolerance for contaminated\nseed in the organic market”). Respondents also allege that\nthe risk of gene flow will cause them to take certain meas­\nures to minimize the likelihood of potential contamination\nand to ensure an adequate supply of non-genetically­\nengineered alfalfa. See, e.g., Geertson Declaration 3 (not­\ning the “increased cost of alfalfa breeding due to potential\nfor genetic contamination”); id., at 6 (“Due to the threat of\ncontamination, I have begun contracting with growers\noutside of the United States to ensure that I can supply\ngenetically pure, conventional alfalfa seed. Finding new\ngrowers has already resulted in increased administrative\n——————\ncompact geographic area of the prime alfalfa seed producing areas and\nthe fact that pollen is distributed by bees that have large natural range\nof activity”); App. ¶8, p. 401 (Declaration of Marc Asumendi) (“Roundup\nalfalfa seed fields are currently being planted in all the major alfalfa\nseed production areas with little regard to contamination to non-GMO\nseed production fields”).\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncosts at my seed business”).\n   Such harms, which respondents will suffer even if their\ncrops are not actually infected with the Roundup ready\ngene, are sufficiently concrete to satisfy the injury-in-fact\nprong of the constitutional standing analysis. Those\nharms are readily attributable to APHIS’s deregulation\ndecision, which, as the District Court found, gives rise to a\nsignificant risk of gene flow to non-genetically-engineered\nvarieties of alfalfa. Finally, a judicial order prohibiting\nthe growth and sale of all or some genetically engineered\nalfalfa would remedy respondents’ injuries by eliminating\nor minimizing the risk of gene flow to conventional and\norganic alfalfa crops. We therefore conclude that respon­\ndents have constitutional standing to seek injunctive relief\nfrom the complete deregulation order at issue here.\n   Petitioners appear to suggest that respondents fail to\nsatisfy the “zone of interests” test we have previously\narticulated as a prudential standing requirement in cases\nchallenging agency compliance with particular statutes.\nSee Reply Brief for Petitioners 12 (arguing that protection\nagainst the risk of commercial harm “is not an interest\nthat NEPA was enacted to address”); Bennett v. Spear, 520\nU. S. 154, 162–163 (1997). That argument is unpersua­\nsive because, as the District Court found, respondents’\ninjury has an environmental as well as an economic com­\nponent. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a. In its ruling on the\nmerits of respondents’ NEPA claim, the District Court\nheld that the risk that the RRA gene conferring gly­\nphosate resistance will infect conventional and organic\nalfalfa is a significant environmental effect within the\nmeaning of NEPA. Petitioners did not appeal that part of\nthe court’s ruling, and we have no occasion to revisit it\nhere. Respondents now seek injunctive relief in order to\navert the risk of gene flow to their crops—the very same\neffect that the District Court determined to be a signifi­\ncant environmental concern for purposes of NEPA. The\n14        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmere fact that respondents also seek to avoid certain\neconomic harms that are tied to the risk of gene flow does\nnot strip them of prudential standing.\n  In short, respondents have standing to seek injunctive\nrelief, and petitioners have standing to seek this Court’s\nreview of the Ninth Circuit’s judgment affirming the entry\nof such relief. We therefore proceed to the merits of the\ncase.\n                              III \n\n                               A\n\n   The District Court sought to remedy APHIS’s NEPA\nviolation in three ways: First, it vacated the agency’s\ndecision completely deregulating RRA; second, it enjoined\nAPHIS from deregulating RRA, in whole or in part, pend­\ning completion of the mandated EIS; and third, it entered\na nationwide injunction prohibiting almost all future\nplanting of RRA. Id., at 108a–110a. Because petitioners\nand the Government do not argue otherwise, we assume\nwithout deciding that the District Court acted lawfully in\nvacating the deregulation decision. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7\n(“[T]he district court could have vacated the order in its\nentirety and sent it back to the agency”); accord, id., at 15–\n16. We therefore address only the latter two aspects of the\nDistrict Court’s judgment. Before doing so, however, we\nprovide a brief overview of the standard governing the\nentry of injunctive relief.\n                              B\n  “[A] plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must\nsatisfy a four-factor test before a court may grant such\nrelief. A plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) that it has suf­\nfered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at\nlaw, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to com­\npensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of\nhardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest\nwould not be disserved by a permanent injunction.” eBay\nInc. v. MercExchange, L. L. C., 547 U. S. 388, 391 (2006).\nThe traditional four-factor test applies when a plaintiff\nseeks a permanent injunction to remedy a NEPA violation.\nSee Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555\nU. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 21–23).\n   Petitioners argue that the lower courts in this case\nproceeded on the erroneous assumption that an injunction\nis generally the appropriate remedy for a NEPA violation.\nIn particular, petitioners note that the District Court cited\npre-Winter Ninth Circuit precedent for the proposition\nthat, in “ ‘the run of the mill NEPA case,’ ” an injunction\ndelaying the contemplated government project is proper\n“ ‘until the NEPA violation is cured.’ ” App. to Pet. for\nCert. 65a (quoting Idaho Watersheds Project v. Hahn, 307\nF. 3d 815, 833 (CA9 2002)); see also App. to Pet. for Cert.\n55a (quoting same language in preliminary injunction\norder). In addition, petitioners observe, the District Court\nand the Court of Appeals in this case both stated that, “in\nunusual circumstances, an injunction may be withheld, or,\nmore likely, limited in scope” in NEPA cases. Id., at 66a\n(quoting National Parks & Conservation Assn. v. Babbitt,\n241 F. 3d 722, 737, n. 18 (CA9 2001) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)); 570 F. 3d, at 1137.\n   Insofar as the statements quoted above are intended to\nguide the determination whether to grant injunctive relief,\nthey invert the proper mode of analysis. An injunction\nshould issue only if the traditional four-factor test is satis­\nfied. See Winter, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 21–24). In\ncontrast, the statements quoted above appear to presume\nthat an injunction is the proper remedy for a NEPA viola­\ntion except in unusual circumstances. No such thumb on\nthe scales is warranted. Nor, contrary to the reasoning of\nthe Court of Appeals, could any such error be cured by a\ncourt’s perfunctory recognition that “an injunction does\n16          MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnot automatically issue” in NEPA cases. See 570 F. 3d, at\n1137 (internal quotation marks omitted). It is not enough\nfor a court considering a request for injunctive relief to ask\nwhether there is a good reason why an injunction should\nnot issue; rather, a court must determine that an injunc­\ntion should issue under the traditional four-factor test set\nout above.\n   Notwithstanding the lower courts’ apparent reliance on\nthe incorrect standard set out in the pre-Winter Circuit\nprecedents quoted above, respondents argue that the\nlower courts in fact applied the traditional four-factor test.\nIn their view, the statements that injunctive relief is\nproper in the “run-of-the-mill” NEPA case, and that such\ninjunctions are granted except in “unusual circumstances,”\nare descriptive rather than prescriptive. See Brief for\nRespondents 28, n. 14. We need not decide whether re­\nspondents’ characterization of the lower court opinions in\nthis case is sound. Even if it is, the injunctive relief\ngranted here cannot stand.\n                            C\n  We first consider whether the District Court erred in\nenjoining APHIS from partially deregulating RRA during\nthe pendency of the EIS process.4\n  The relevant part of the District Court’s judgment states\nthat, “[b]efore granting Monsanto’s deregulation petition,\n——————\n  4 Petitionersfocus their challenge on the part of the District Court’s\norder prohibiting the planting of RRA. As we explain below, however,\nthe broad injunction against planting cannot be valid if the injunction\nagainst partial deregulation is improper. See infra, at 23; see also App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 64a (District Court order recognizing that APHIS’s\nproposed remedy “seek[s], in effect, a partial deregulation that permits\nthe continued expansion of the Roundup Ready alfalfa market subject\nto certain conditions” (emphasis added)). The validity of the injunction\nprohibiting partial deregulation is therefore properly before us. Like\nthe District Court, we use the term “partial deregulation” to refer to\nany limited or conditional deregulation. See id., at 64a, 69a.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\neven in part, the federal defendants shall prepare an\nenvironmental impact statement.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n108a (emphasis added); see also id., at 79a (“The Court\nwill enter a final judgment . . . ordering the government to\nprepare an EIS before it makes a decision on Monsanto’s\nderegulation petition”). The plain text of the order prohib­\nits any partial deregulation, not just the particular partial\nderegulation embodied in APHIS’s proposed judgment.\nWe think it is quite clear that the District Court meant\njust what it said. The related injunction against planting\nstates that “no [RRA] . . . may be planted” “[u]ntil the\nfederal defendants prepare the EIS and decide the deregu­\nlation petition.” Id., at 108a (emphasis added). That\ninjunction, which appears in the very same judgment and\ndirectly follows the injunction against granting Mon­\nsanto’s petition “even in part,” does not carve out an ex­\nception for planting subsequently authorized by a valid\npartial deregulation decision.\n   In our view, none of the traditional four factors govern­\ning the entry of permanent injunctive relief supports the\nDistrict Court’s injunction prohibiting partial deregula­\ntion. To see why that is so, it is helpful to understand how\nthe injunction prohibiting a partial deregulation fits into\nthe broader dispute between the parties.\n   Respondents in this case brought suit under the APA to\nchallenge a particular agency order: APHIS’s decision to\ncompletely deregulate RRA. The District Court held that\nthe order in question was procedurally defective, and\nAPHIS decided not to appeal that determination. At that\npoint, it was for the agency to decide whether and to what\nextent it would pursue a partial deregulation. If the\nagency found, on the basis of a new EA, that a limited and\ntemporary deregulation satisfied applicable statutory and\nregulatory requirements, it could proceed with such a\nderegulation even if it had not yet finished the onerous\nEIS required for complete deregulation. If and when the\n18         MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nagency were to issue a partial deregulation order, any\nparty aggrieved by that order could bring a separate suit\nunder the Administrative Procedure Act to challenge the\nparticular deregulation attempted. See 5 U. S. C. §702.\n   In this case, APHIS apparently sought to “streamline”\nthe proceedings by asking the District Court to craft a\nremedy that, in effect, would have partially deregulated\nRRA until such time as the agency had finalized the EIS\nneeded for a complete deregulation. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n16, 23–24; App. to Pet. for Cert. 69a. To justify that dispo­\nsition, APHIS and petitioners submitted voluminous\ndocumentary submissions in which they purported to show\nthat the risk of gene flow would be insignificant if the\nDistrict Court allowed limited planting and harvesting\nsubject to APHIS’s proposed conditions. Respondents, in\nturn, submitted considerable evidence of their own that\nseemed to cut the other way. This put the District Court\nin an unenviable position. “The parties’ experts disagreed\nover virtually every factual issue relating to possible\nenvironmental harm, including the likelihood of genetic\ncontamination and why some contamination had already\noccurred.” 570 F. 3d, at 1135.\n   The District Court may well have acted within its dis­\ncretion in refusing to craft a judicial remedy that would\nhave authorized the continued planting and harvesting of\nRRA while the EIS is being prepared. It does not follow,\nhowever, that the District Court was within its rights in\nenjoining APHIS from allowing such planting and harvest­\ning pursuant to the authority vested in the agency by law.\nWhen the District Court entered its permanent injunction,\nAPHIS had not yet exercised its authority to partially\nderegulate RRA. Until APHIS actually seeks to effect a\npartial deregulation, any judicial review of such a decision\nis premature.5\n——————\n 5 NEPA   provides that an EIS must be “include[d] in every recommen­\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Even if the District\nCourt was not required to adopt that judgment, there was\nno need to stop the agency from effecting a partial deregu­\nlation in accordance with the procedures established by\nlaw. Moreover, the terms of the District Court’s injunction\ndo not just enjoin the particular partial deregulation\nembodied in APHIS’s proposed judgment. Instead, the\nDistrict Court barred the agency from pursuing any de­\nregulation—no matter how limited the geographic area in\nwhich planting of RRA would be allowed, how great the\nisolation distances mandated between RRA fields and\nfields for growing non-genetically-engineered alfalfa, how\nstringent the regulations governing harvesting and distri­\nbution, how robust the enforcement mechanisms available\n\n——————\ndation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal\nactions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.”\n42 U. S. C. §4332(2)(C) (emphasis added); see also Kleppe v. Sierra\nClub, 427 U. S. 390, 406 (1976) (“A court has no authority to depart\nfrom the statutory language and . . . determine a point during the\ngermination process of a potential proposal at which an impact state­\nment should be prepared” (first emphasis added)). When a particular\nagency proposal exists and requires the preparation of an EIS, NEPA\nregulations allow the agency to take at least some action pertaining to\nthat proposal during the pendency of the EIS process. See 40 CFR\n§§1506.1(a), (c) (2009). We do not express any view on the Govern­\nment’s contention that a limited deregulation of the kind embodied in\nits proposed judgment would not require the prior preparation of an\nEIS. See Brief for Federal Respondents 21–22 (citing §1506.1(a)); Tr. of\nOral Arg. 20 (“what we were proposing for the interim, that is allowing\ncontinued planting subject to various protective measures, was funda­\nmentally different from the action on which the EIS was being pre­\npared”). Because APHIS has not yet invoked the procedures necessary\nto attempt a limited deregulation, any judicial consideration of such\nissues is not warranted at this time.\n20        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nat the time of the decision, and—consequently—no matter\nhow small the risk that the planting authorized under\nsuch conditions would adversely affect the environment in\ngeneral and respondents in particular.\n   The order enjoining any partial deregulation was also\ninconsistent with other aspects of the very same judgment.\nIn fashioning its remedy for the NEPA violation, the\nDistrict Court steered a “middle course” between more\nextreme options on either end. See id., at 1136. On the\none hand, the District Court rejected APHIS’s proposal\n(supported by petitioners) to allow continued planting and\nharvesting of RRA subject to the agency’s proposed limita­\ntions. On the other hand, the District Court did not bar\ncontinued planting of RRA as a regulated article under\npermit from APHIS, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a, and it\nexpressly allowed farmers to harvest and sell RRA planted\nbefore March 30, 2007, id., at 76a–79a. If the District\nCourt was right to conclude that any partial deregulation,\nno matter how limited, required the preparation of an EIS,\nit is hard to see why the limited planting and harvesting\nthat the District Court allowed did not also require the\npreparation of an EIS. Conversely, if the District Court\nwas right to conclude that the limited planting and har­\nvesting it allowed did not require the preparation of an\nEIS, then an appropriately limited partial deregulation\nshould likewise have been possible.\n   Based on the analysis set forth above, it is clear that the\norder enjoining any deregulation whatsoever does not\nsatisfy the traditional four-factor test for granting perma­\nnent injunctive relief. Most importantly, respondents\ncannot show that they will suffer irreparable injury if\nAPHIS is allowed to proceed with any partial deregula­\ntion, for at least two independent reasons.\n   First, if and when APHIS pursues a partial deregulation\nthat arguably runs afoul of NEPA, respondents may file a\nnew suit challenging such action and seeking appropriate\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npreliminary relief. See 5 U. S. C. §§702, 705. Accordingly,\na permanent injunction is not now needed to guard\nagainst any present or imminent risk of likely irreparable\nharm.\n   Second, a partial deregulation need not cause respon­\ndents any injury at all, much less irreparable injury; if the\nscope of the partial deregulation is sufficiently limited, the\nrisk of gene flow to their crops could be virtually nonexis­\ntent. For example, suppose that APHIS deregulates RRA\nonly in a remote part of the country in which respondents\nneither grow nor intend to grow non-genetically­\nengineered alfalfa, and in which no conventional alfalfa\nfarms are currently located. Suppose further that APHIS\nissues an accompanying administrative order mandating\nisolation distances so great as to eliminate any apprecia­\nble risk of gene flow to the crops of conventional farmers\nwho might someday choose to plant in the surrounding\narea. See, e.g., Brief in Opposition 9, n. 6 (quoting study\nconcluding “ ‘that in order for there to be zero tolerance of\nany gene flow between a [RRA] seed field and a conven­\ntional seed field, those fields would have to have a five­\nmile isolation distance between them’ ”); see also Tr. of\nOral Arg. 15–16 (representation from the Solicitor General\nthat APHIS may impose conditions on the deregulation of\nRRA via issuance of an administrative order). Finally,\nsuppose that APHIS concludes in a new EA that its lim­\nited deregulation would not pose a significant risk of gene\nflow or harmful weed development, and that the agency\nadopts a plan to police vigorously compliance with its\nadministrative order in the limited geographic area in\nquestion. It is hard to see how respondents could show\nthat such a limited deregulation would cause them likely\nirreparable injury. (Respondents in this case do not repre­\nsent a class, so they could not seek to enjoin such an order\non the ground that it might cause harm to other parties.)\nIn any case, the District Court’s order prohibiting any\n22          MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npartial deregulation improperly relieves respondents of\ntheir burden to make the requisite evidentiary showing.6\n   Of course, APHIS might ultimately choose not to par­\ntially deregulate RRA during the pendency of the EIS, or\nelse to pursue the kind of partial deregulation embodied in\nits proposed judgment rather than the very limited de­\nregulation envisioned in the above hypothetical. Until\nsuch time as the agency decides whether and how to exer­\ncise its regulatory authority, however, the courts have no\ncause to intervene. Indeed, the broad injunction entered\nhere essentially pre-empts the very procedure by which\nthe agency could determine, independently of the pending\nEIS process for assessing the effects of a complete deregu­\nlation, that a limited deregulation would not pose any\nappreciable risk of environmental harm. See 40 CFR\n§§1501.4, 1508.9(a) (2009).\n   In sum, we do not know whether and to what extent\nAPHIS would seek to effect a limited deregulation during\nthe pendency of the EIS process if it were free to do so; we\ndo know that the vacatur of APHIS’s deregulation decision\nmeans that virtually no RRA can be grown or sold until\nsuch time as a new deregulation decision is in place, and\nwe also know that any party aggrieved by a hypothetical\nfuture deregulation decision will have ample opportunity\n——————\n   6 The District Court itself appears to have recognized that its broad\n\ninjunction may not have been necessary to avert any injury to respon­\ndents. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 191a (“It does complicate it to try to\nfine-tune a particular remedy. So the simpler the remedy, the more\nattractive it is from the Court’s point of view, because it appears to me\nenforcement is easier. Understanding it is easier, and it may be, while\na blunt instrument, it may actually, for the short term, achieve its\nresult, achieve its purpose, even maybe it overachieves it. . . . Maybe a\nlot of it is not necessary. I don’t know” (emphasis added)); see also ibid.\n(“I don’t say you have to be greater than 1.6 miles, you have to be away\nfrom the bees, you have be dah dah dah. That’s the farm business. I’m\nnot even in it”); id., at 192a (“I am not going to get into the isolation\ndistances”).\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

In light of these\nparticular circumstances, we hold that the District Court\ndid not properly exercise its discretion in enjoining a\npartial deregulation of any kind pending APHIS’s prepa­\nration of an EIS. It follows that the Court of Appeals\nerred in affirming that aspect of the District Court’s\njudgment.\n                             D\n   We now turn to petitioners’ claim that the District Court\nerred in entering a nationwide injunction against planting\nRRA. Petitioners argue that the District Court did not\napply the right test for determining whether to enter\npermanent injunctive relief; that, even if the District\nCourt identified the operative legal standard, it erred as a\nmatter of law in applying that standard to the facts of this\ncase; and that the District Court was required to grant\npetitioners an evidentiary hearing to resolve contested\nissues of fact germane to the remedial dispute between the\nparties. We agree that the District Court’s injunction\nagainst planting went too far, but we come to that conclu­\nsion for two independent reasons.\n   First, the impropriety of the District Court’s broad\ninjunction against planting flows from the impropriety of\nits injunction against partial deregulation. If APHIS may\npartially deregulate RRA before preparing a full-blown\nEIS—a question that we need not and do not decide here—\nfarmers should be able to grow and sell RRA in accordance\nwith that agency determination. Because it was inappro­\npriate for the District Court to foreclose even the possibil­\nity of a partial and temporary deregulation, it necessarily\nfollows that it was likewise inappropriate to enjoin any\nand all parties from acting in accordance with the terms of\nsuch a deregulation decision.\n   Second, respondents have represented to this Court that\n24       MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe District Court’s injunction against planting does not\nhave any meaningful practical effect independent of its\nvacatur. See Brief for Respondents 24; see also Tr. of Oral\nArg. 37 (“[T]he mistake that was made [by the District\nCourt] was in not appreciating . . . that the vacatur did\nhave [the] effect” of independently prohibiting the growth\nand sale of almost all RRA). An injunction is a drastic and\nextraordinary remedy, which should not be granted as a\nmatter of course. See, e.g., Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo,\n456 U. S. 305, 311–312 (1982). If a less drastic remedy\n(such as partial or complete vacatur of APHIS’s deregula­\ntion decision) was sufficient to redress respondents’ injury,\nno recourse to the additional and extraordinary relief of an\ninjunction was warranted. See ibid.; see also Winter, 555\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 21–23).\n                             E\n   In sum, the District Court abused its discretion in en­\njoining APHIS from effecting a partial deregulation and in\nprohibiting the possibility of planting in accordance with\nthe terms of such a deregulation. Given those errors, this\nCourt need not express any view on whether injunctive\nrelief of some kind was available to respondents on the\nrecord before us. Nor does the Court address the question\nwhether the District Court was required to conduct an\nevidentiary hearing before entering the relief at issue\nhere. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

See App. to Pet. for Cert. 38a,\n54a, 62a. Second, even planting in a controlled setting\nhad led to contamination in some instances. See id., at\n69a–70a. Third, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection\nService (APHIS) has limited ability to monitor or enforce\nlimitations on planting. See id., at 70a. And fourth,\ngenetic contamination from RRA could decimate farmers’\nlivelihoods and the American alfalfa market for years to\ncome. See id., at 71a; see also id., at 29a–30a. Instead,\nthe majority faults the District Court for “enjoining\nAPHIS from partially deregulating RRA.” Ante, at 16.\n   In my view, the District Court may not have actually\nordered such relief, and we should not so readily assume\nthat it did. Regardless, the District Court did not abuse\nits discretion when, after considering the voluminous\nrecord and making the aforementioned findings, it issued\nthe order now before us.\n                           I\n  To understand the District Court’s judgment, it is nec\nessary to understand the background of this litigation.\nPetitioner Monsanto Company (Monsanto) is a large cor\n2        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nporation that has long produced a weed killer called\nRoundup. After years of experimentation, Monsanto and\nco-petitioner Forage Genetics International (FGI) geneti\ncally engineered a mutation in the alfalfa genome that\nmakes the plant immune to Roundup. Monsanto and\nFGI’s new product, RRA, is “the first crop that has been\nengineered to resist a[n] herbicide” and that can transmit\nthe genetically engineered gene to other plants. See App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 45a.\n   In 2004, in the midst of a deregulatory trend in the\nagricultural sector, petitioners asked APHIS to deregulate\nRRA, thereby allowing it to be sold and planted nation\nwide. App. 101a. Rather than conducting a detailed\nanalysis and preparing an “environmental impact state\nment” (EIS), as required by the National Environmental\nPolicy Act of 1969 (NEPA) for every “major Federal ac\ntio[n] significantly affecting the quality of the human\nenvironment,” 42 U. S. C. §4332(2)(C), APHIS merely\nconducted an abbreviated “environmental assessment”\n(EA). During the 6-month period in which APHIS allowed\npublic comment on its EA, the agency received 663 com\nments, 520 of which opposed deregulation. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 29a. Farmers and scientists opined that RRA could\ncontaminate alfalfa that has not been genetically modified,\ndestroying the American export market for alfalfa and,\npotentially, contaminating other plants and breeding a\nnew type of pesticide-resistant weed. Id., at 29a–30a.\n   Despite substantial evidence that RRA genes could\ntransfer to other plants, APHIS issued a Finding of No\nSignificant Impact and agreed to deregulate RRA “uncon\nditionally,” ante, at 4. With no EIS to wait for and no\nregulation blocking its path, petitioners began selling\nRRA. Farmers and environmental groups swiftly brought\nthis lawsuit to challenge APHIS’s decision to deregulate,\nraising claims under NEPA and other statutes.\n   The District Court carefully reviewed a long record and\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)             3\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nfound that “APHIS’s reasons for concluding” that the risks\nof genetic contamination are low were “not ‘convincing.’ ”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 38a. A review of APHIS’s internal\ndocuments showed that individuals within the agency\nwarned that contamination might occur. APHIS rested its\ndecision to deregulate on its assertion that contamination\nrisk is “not significant because it is the organic and con\nventional farmers’ responsibility” to protect themselves\nand the environment. Ibid. Yet the agency drew this\nconclusion without having investigated whether such\nfarmers “can, in fact, protect their crops from contamina\ntion.” Ibid. The District Court likewise found that\nAPHIS’s reasons for disregarding the risk of pesticide\nresistant weeds were speculative and “not convincing.”\nId., at 46a. The agency had merely explained that if\nweeds acquire roundup resistance, farmers can use “ ‘[a]l\nternative herbicides.’ ” Ibid. In light of the “acknowl\nedged” risk of RRA gene transmission and the potential\n“impact on the development of Roundup resistant weeds,”\nthe court concluded that there was a significant possibility\nof serious environmental harm, and granted summary\njudgment for the plaintiffs. Id., at 54a; see also id., at 45a.\n   At this point, the question of remedy arose. The parties\nsubmitted proposed final judgments, and several corpora\ntions with an interest in RRA, including Monsanto, sought\npermission to intervene. The District Court granted their\nmotion and agreed “to give them the opportunity to pre\nsent evidence to assist the court in fashioning the appro\npriate scope of whatever relief is granted.” Id., at 54a\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   While the District Court considered the proposed judg\nments, it issued a preliminary injunction. Ordinarily, the\ncourt explained, the remedy for failure to conduct an EIS\nis to vacate the permit that was unlawfully given—the\nresult of which, in this case, would be to prohibit any use\nof RRA. See id., at 55a; see also id., at 65a. But this case\n4        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                   STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\npresented a special difficulty: Following APHIS’s unlawful\nderegulation order, some farmers had begun planting\ngenetically modified RRA. Id., at 55a. In its preliminary\ninjunction, the District Court ordered that no new RRA\ncould be planted until APHIS completed the EIS or the\ncourt determined that some other relief was appropriate.\nBut, so as to protect these farmers, the court declined to\nprohibit them from “harvesting, using, or selling” any\ncrops they had already planted. Id., at 56a. And “to\nminimize the harm to those growers who intend to immi\nnently plant Roundup Ready alfalfa,” the court permitted\n“[t]hose growers who intend to plant [RRA] in the next\nthree weeks and have already purchased the seed” to go\nahead and plant. Id., at 58a (emphasis deleted). Essen\ntially, the court grandfathered in those farmers who had\nrelied, in good faith, on APHIS’s actions.\n   Before determining the scope of its final judgment, the\nDistrict Court invited the parties and intervenors to sub\nmit “whatever additional evidence” they “wish[ed] to\nprovide,” and it scheduled additional oral argument. Id.,\nat 58a–59a. The parties submitted “competing proposals\nfor permanent injunctive relief.” Id., at 60a. The plain\ntiffs requested that no one—not even the grandfathered-in\nfarmers—be allowed to plant, grow, or harvest RRA until\nthe full EIS had been prepared. Id., at 64a. APHIS and\nthe intervenors instead sought a remedy that would “fa\ncilitat[e] the continued and dramatic growth” of RRA: a\n“partial deregulation” order that would permit planting\nsubject to certain conditions, such as specified minimum\ndistances between RRA and conventional alfalfa and\nspecial cleaning requirements for equipment used on the\ngenetically modified crop. See id., at 60a–64a.\n   The court adopted a compromise. First, it declined to\nadopt the APHIS-Monsanto proposal. APHIS itself had\nacknowledged that “gene transmission could and had\noccurred,” and that RRA “could result in the development\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nof Roundup-resistant weeds.” Id., at 61a–62a. In light of\nthe substantial record evidence of these risks, the court\nwould not agree to a nationwide planting scheme “without\nthe benefit of the development of all the relevant data,” as\nwell as public comment about whether contamination\ncould be controlled. Id., at 68a. The “partial deregulation”\nproposed by petitioners, the court noted, was really “de\nregulation with certain conditions,” id., at 69a—which, for\nthe same reasons given in the court’s earlier order, re\nquires an EIS, ibid. The court pointed out numerous\nproblems with the APHIS-Monsanto proposal. Neither\nAPHIS nor Monsanto had provided “evidence that sug\ngests whether, and to what extent, the proposed interim\nconditions” would actually “be followed,” and comparable\nconditions had failed to prevent contamination in certain\nlimited settings. Id., at 69a–70a. APHIS, moreover,\nconceded that “it does not have the resources to inspect”\nthe RRA that had already been planted, and so could not\npossibly be expected “to adequately monitor the more than\none million acres of [RRA] intervenors estimate [would] be\nplanted” under their proposal. Ibid. That was especially\nproblematic because any plan to limit contamination\ndepended on rules about harvesting, and farmers were\nunlikely to follow those rules. Id., at 71a. “APHIS ha[d]\nstill not made any inquiry” into numerous factual concerns\nraised by the court in its summary judgment order issued\nseveral months earlier. Id., at 70a.\n  Next, the court rejected the plaintiffs’ proposed remedy\nof “enjoin[ing] the harvesting and sale of already planted”\nRRA. Id., at 76a. Although any planting or harvesting of\nRRA poses a contamination risk, the court reasoned that\nthe equities were different for those farmers who had\nalready invested time and money planting RRA in good\nfaith reliance on APHIS’s deregulation order. And small\namounts of harvesting could be more easily monitored.\nRather than force the farmers to tear up their crops, the\n6        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ncourt imposed a variety of conditions on the crops’ han\ndling and distribution. Id., at 77a.\n   As to all other RRA, however, the court sided with the\nplaintiffs and enjoined planting during the pendency of\nthe EIS. Balancing the equities, the court explained that\nthe risk of harm was great. “[C]ontamination cannot be\nundone; it will destroy the crops of those farmers who do\nnot sell genetically modified alfalfa.” Id., at 71a. And\nbecause those crops “cannot be replanted for two to four\nyears,” that loss will be even greater. Ibid. On the other\nside of the balance, the court recognized that some farmers\nmay wish to switch to genetically modified alfalfa immedi\nately, and some companies like Monsanto want to start\nselling it to them just as fast. But, the court noted, RRA is\na small percentage of those companies’ overall business;\nunsold seed can be stored; and the companies “ ‘have [no]\ncause to claim surprise’ ” as to any loss of anticipated\nrevenue, as they “were aware of plaintiffs’ lawsuit” and\n“nonetheless chose to market” RRA. Id., at 72a.\n   Thus, the District Court stated that it would “vacat[e]\nthe June 2005 deregulation decision”; “enjoi[n] the plant\ning of [RRA] in the United States after March 30, 2007,”\nthe date of the decision, “pending the government’s com\npletion of the EIS and decision on the deregulation peti\ntion”; and impose “conditions on the handling and identifi\ncation of already-planted [RRA].” Id., at 79a. On the\nsame day, the court issued its judgment. In relevant part,\nthe judgment states:\n    “The federal defendants’ June 14, 2005 Determination\n    of Nonregulated Status for [RRA] is VACATED. Be\n    fore granting Monsanto’s deregulation petition, even\n    in part, the federal defendants shall prepare an [EIS].\n    Until the federal defendants prepare the EIS and de\n    cide the deregulation petition, no [RRA] may be\n    planted. . . .

The Court today rests\nnot only the bulk of its analysis but also the primary basis\nfor our jurisdiction on the premise that the District Court\nenjoined APHIS from partially deregulating RRA in any\nsense. See ante, at 9–11, 16–23.1 That is a permissible,\nbut not necessarily correct, reading of the District Court’s\njudgment.\n  So far as I can tell, until petitioners’ reply brief, neither\npetitioners nor the Government submitted to us that the\nDistrict Court had exceeded its authority in this manner.\nAnd, indeed, the Government had not raised this issue in\nany court at all. Petitioners did not raise the issue in any\nof their three questions presented or in the body of their\npetition for a writ or certiorari. And they did not raise the\nissue in their opening briefs to this Court. Only after\nrespondents alleged that Monsanto’s injury would not be\nredressed by vacating the injunction, insofar as RRA\nwould still be a regulated article, did petitioners bring the\nissue to the Court’s attention. Explaining why they have a\nredressable injury, petitioners alleged that the District\nCourt’s order prevents APHIS from “implement[ing] an[y]\n——————\n   1 See also ante, at 19–20 (“[T]he District Court barred the agency\n\nfrom pursuing any deregulation—no matter how limited the geographic\narea in which planting of RRA would be allowed, how great the isola\ntion distances mandated between RRA fields and fields for growing\nnon-genetically-engineered alfalfa, how stringent the regulations\ngoverning harvesting and distribution, how robust the enforcement\nmechanisms available at the time of the decision, and—consequently—\nno matter how small the risk that the planting authorized under such\nconditions would adversely affect the environment in general and\nrespondents in particular” (emphasis deleted)).\n8         MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ninterim solution allowing continued planting.” Reply Brief\nfor Petitioners 5. APHIS, the party that the Court says\nwas wrongly “barred . . . from pursuing any deregulation,”\neven “in accordance with the procedures established by\nlaw,” ante, at 19, did not complain about this aspect of the\nDistrict Court’s order even in its reply brief.\n  Thus, notwithstanding that petitioners “adequately\npreserved their objection that the vacated deregulation\ndecision should have been replaced by APHIS’s proposed\ninjunction,” ante, at 8 (emphasis added), the key legal\npremise on which the Court decides this case was never\nadequately presented. Of course, this is not standard—or\nsound—judicial practice. See Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmi\nchael, 526 U. S. 137, 159 (1999) (STEVENS, J., concurring\nin part and dissenting in part). Today’s decision illus\ntrates why, for it is quite unclear whether the Court’s\npremise is correct, and the Court has put itself in the\nposition of deciding legal issues without the aid of briefing.\n  In my view, the District Court’s judgment can fairly be\nread to address only (1) total deregulation orders of the\nkind that spawned this lawsuit, and (2) the particular\npartial deregulation order proposed to the court by APHIS.\nThis interpretation of the judgment is more consistent\nwith the District Court’s accompanying opinion, which\nconcluded by stating that the court “will enter a final\njudgment” “ordering the government to prepare an EIS\nbefore [the court] makes a decision on Monsanto’s deregu\nlation petition.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 79a. The language\nof that opinion does not appear to “ba[r] the agency from\npursuing any deregulation—no matter how limited,” ante,\nat 19 (emphasis deleted). This interpretation is also more\nconsistent with APHIS’s own decision not to contest what,\naccording to the Court, was an unprecedented infringe\nment on the agency’s statutory authority.\n  To be sure, the District Court’s judgment is somewhat\nopaque. But it is troubling that we may be asserting\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

In such a case, a court’s func\ntion is “to do equity and to mould each decree to the neces\nsities of the particular case.” Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321\nU. S. 321, 329 (1944). “Flexibility” and “practicality” are\nthe touchtones of these remedial determinations, as “the\npublic interest,” “private needs,” and “competing private\nclaims” must all be weighed and reconciled against the\nbackground of the court’s own limitations and its particu\nlar familiarity with the case.

J. 291 (2003). The\nparties to this appeal and the majority assume that the District Court’s\nremedy was crafted under its equity powers, and I will do the same.\n  6 One of the many matters not briefed in this case is how limited a\n\npartial deregulation can be. It is not clear whether the sort of ex\ntremely limited “partial deregulations” envisioned by the Court, see\nante, at 19–23, in which RRA is “deregulated” in one small geographic\narea pursuant to stringent restrictions, could be achieved only through\n“partial deregulation” actions, or whether they could also (or exclu\nsively) be achieved through a more case-specific permit process. Under\nthe applicable regulations, a regulated article may still be used subject\nto a permitting process. See 7 CFR §§340.0, 340.4 (2010). These\npermits “prescribe confinement conditions and standard operating\nprocedures . . . to maintain confinement of the genetically engineered\norganism.” Introduction of Organisms and Products Altered or Pro\nduced Through Genetic Engineering, 72 Fed.

See generally D. Mandelker,\nNEPA Law and Litigation §§8:33–8:48 (2d ed. 2009) (de\nscribing when an EIS is required); cf. Marsh v. Oregon\nNatural Resources Council, 490 U. S. 360, 371 (1989)\n(NEPA embodies “sweeping commitment” to environ\nmental safety and principle that “the agency will not act\non incomplete information, only to regret its decision after\nit is too late to correct”). Indeed, it appears that any de\nregulation of a genetically modified, herbicide-resistant\ncrop that can transfer its genes to other organisms and\ncannot effectively be monitored easily fits the criteria for\nwhen an EIS is required.7 That is especially so when, as\nin this case, the environmental threat is novel. See Winter\nv. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U. S. ___,\n___ (2008) (slip op., at 13) (EIS is more important when\nparty “is conducting a new type of activity with completely\nunknown effects on the environment”).8\n——————\npetition for nonregulated status. USDA, Introduction of Genetically\nEngineered Organisms, Draft Environmental Impact Statement, July\n2007, p. 11, online at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/brs/pdf/complete_\neis.pdf (as visited June 18, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court’s\ncase file). In 2007, APHIS began contemplating a “new system” to\nallow for the release and use of genetically modified organisms, for\n“special cases” in which there are risks “that could be mitigated with\nconditions to ensure safe commercial use.” Introduction 39024 (em\nphasis added).\n   7 See, e.g., 40 CFR §1508.8 (2009) (determination whether an EIS is\n\nrequired turns on both “[d]irect effects” and “[i]ndirect effects,” and\n“include[s] those resulting from actions which may have both beneficial\nand detrimental effects even if on balance the agency believes that the\neffect will be beneficial”); §1508.27(b)(4) (determination whether an EIS\nis required turns on “[t]he degree to which the effects on the quality of\nthe human environment are likely to be highly controversial”);\n§1508.27(b)(5) (determination whether an EIS is required turns on\n“[t]he degree to which the possible effects on the quality of the human\nenvironment are highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown\nrisks”).\n   8 The Court posits a hypothetical in which APHIS deregulates RRA\n\nlimited to a remote area in which alfalfa is not grown, and issues an\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Courts con\nfronted with NEPA violations regularly adopt interim\nmeasures to maintain the status quo, particularly if allow\ning agency action to go forward risks foreclosing alterna\ntive courses of action that the agency might have adopted\nfollowing completion of an EIS. See D. Mandelker, NEPA\nLaw and Litigation §4:61. The applicable regulations, to\nwhich the District Court owed deference,9 provide that\nduring the preparation of an EIS, “no action concerning\nthe [agency’s] proposal shall be taken which would . . .\n[h]ave an adverse environmental impact” or “[l]imit the\nchoice of reasonable alternatives.” 40 CFR §1506.1(a)\n(2009). As exemplified by the problem of what to do with\nfarmers who had already purchased or planted RRA prior\nto the District Court’s judgment, even minimal deregula\ntion can limit future regulatory options. “Courts must\nremember that in many cases allowing an agency to pro\nceed makes a mockery of the EIS process, converting it\n——————\naccompanying order “mandating isolation distances so great as to\neliminate any appreciable risk of gene flow to the crops of conventional\nfarmers who might someday choose to plant in the surrounding area.”\nAnte, at 21. At the outset, it is important to note the difference be\ntween a plausible hypothetical and a piece of fiction. At least as of\n2007, APHIS had never granted partial approval of a petition for\nnonregulated status. See n. 6, supra. And I doubt that it would choose\nto deregulate genetically modified alfalfa in a place where the growing\nconditions and sales networks for the product are so poor that no\nfarmer already plants it. Moreover, the notion that this imagined\nderegulation would pose virtually no environmental risk ignores one of\nthe District Court’s critical findings of fact: APHIS has very limited\ncapacity to monitor its own restrictions. The agency could place all\nmanner of constraints on its deregulation orders; they will have no\neffect unless they are enforced.\n   9 See Marsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Council, 490 U. S. 360, 372\n\n(1989).\n14         MONSANTO CO. v.

Rev. 1263, 1289 (1992); see also see 40 CFR §1502.5\n(EIS should be implemented in manner assuring it “will\nnot be used to rationalize or justify decisions already\nmade”).\n   Although the majority does not dispute that the District\nCourt could have reasonably concluded that NEPA re\nquires an EIS for even partial deregulation of RRA, it\nsuggests that any such conclusion would have been in\ncompatible with the court’s decision to permit limited\nharvesting by farmers who had already planted RRA. See\nante, at 20.10 I do not see the “inconsisten[cy].” Ibid.\nNEPA does not apply to actions by federal courts. See 40\nCFR §1508.12. Exercising its equitable discretion to\nbalance the interests of the parties and the public, the\nDistrict Court would have been well within its rights to\nfind that NEPA requires an EIS before the agency grants\n“Monsanto’s deregulation petition, even in part,” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 108a, yet also to find that a partial stay of\nthe vacatur was appropriate to protect the interests of\nthose farmers who had already acted in good-faith reliance\non APHIS.\n   Similarly, I do not agree that the District Court’s ruling\nwas “premature” because APHIS had not yet effected any\npartial deregulations, ante, at 19. Although it is “for the\nagency to decide whether and to what extent” it will pur\nsue deregulation, ante, at 17, the court’s application of\nNEPA to APHIS’s regulation of RRA might have con\ntrolled any deregulation during the pendency of the EIS.\nPetitioners and APHIS had already come back to the court\n——————\n  10 The Court states that the order permitted both harvesting and\n\nplanting. But the court’s final judgment permitted only sale and\nharvesting of RRA planted before March 30, 2007, more than a month\nbefore the judgment.

That same concern\nwould apply to any partial deregulation order. The court\ntherefore had good reason to make it clear, upfront, that\nthe parties should not continue to expend resources pro\nposing such orders, instead of just moving ahead with an\nEIS. Cf. Railroad Comm’n of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312\nU. S. 496, 500 (1941) (“The resources of equity are equal to\nan adjustment that will avoid the waste of a tentative\ndecision”). Indeed, it was APHIS itself that “sought to\n‘streamline’ ” the process. Ante, at 18.\nInjunctive Relief\n   Second, the District Court’s judgment can be understood\nas a reasonable response to the nature of the risks posed\nby RRA. Separate and apart from NEPA’s requirement of\nan EIS, these risks were sufficiently serious, in my view,\nthat the court’s injunction was a permissible exercise of its\nequitable authority.\n   The District Court found that gene transfer can and\ndoes occur, and that if it were to spread through open land\nthe environmental and economic consequences would be\ndevastating. Cf. Amoco Production Co. v. Gambell, 480\nU. S. 531, 545 (1987) (“Environmental injury, by its na\nture, can seldom be adequately remedied by money dam\nages and is often permanent or at least of long duration,\ni.e., irreparable”). Although “a mere possibility of a future\nnuisance will not support an injunction,” courts have\nnever required proof “that the nuisance will occur”; rather,\n“it is sufficient . . . that the risk of its happening is greater\nthan a reasonable man would incur.” 5 J. Pomeroy, A\nTreatise on Equity Jurisprudence and Equitable Reme\ndies, §1937 (§523), p. 4398 (2d ed. 1919). Once gene trans\nfer occurred in American fields, it “would be difficult—if\n16          MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nnot impossible—to reverse the harm.” Hollingsworth v.\nPerry, 558 U. S. __, __ (2010) (per curiam) (slip op., at 12).\n   Additional considerations support the District Court’s\njudgment. It was clear to the court that APHIS had only\nlimited capacity to monitor planted RRA, and some RRA\nhad already been planted. The marginal threat posed by\nadditional planting was therefore significant. Injunctive\nremedies are meant to achieve a “nice adjustment and\nreconciliation between the competing claims” of injury by\n“mould[ing] each decree to the necessities of the case.”\nWeinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S. 305, 312 (1982)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Under these circum\nstances, it was not unreasonable for the court to conclude\nthat the most equitable solution was to allocate the lim\nited amount of potentially safe RRA to the farmers who\nhad already planted that crop.11\n   The Court suggests that the injunction was nonetheless\ntoo sweeping because “a partial deregulation need not\ncause respondents any injury at all . . . if the scope of the\npartial deregulation is sufficiently limited, the risk of gene\nflow to their crops could be virtually nonexistent.” Ante, at\n21. The Court appears to reach this conclusion by citing\none particular study (in a voluminous record), rather than\nany findings of fact.12 Even assuming that this study is\n——————\n  11 As explained previously, I do not see the court’s broad injunction as\n\n“inconsistent,” ante, at 20, with its decision that farmers who had\nalready planted RRA could harvest their crop. The equities are differ\nent for farmers who relied on the agency than for companies like\nMonstanto that developed an organism knowing it might be regulated;\nand APHIS could monitor only a limited amount of RRA.\n  12 The Court also hypothesizes a set of growing conditions that would\n\nisolate RRA from the plaintiffs in this case, even if not from other\nfarmers. See ante, at 21–22. As already explained, these hypotheticals\nare rather unrealistic. See n. 8, supra. And, given that the plaintiffs\ninclude environmental organizations as well as farmer and consumer\nassociations, it is hard to see how APHIS could so carefully isolate and\nprotect their interests. In any event, because APHIS concedes that it\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

APHIS and petitioners argued to the\nDistrict Court that partial deregulation could be safely\nimplemented, they submitted evidence intended to show\nthat planting restrictions would prevent the spread of the\nnewly engineered gene, and they contested “virtually\nevery factual issue relating to possible environmental\nharm.” Geertson Seed Farms v. Johanns, 570 F. 3d 1130,\n1135 (CA9 2009). But lacking “the benefit of the develop\nment of all the relevant data,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a,\nthe District Court did not find APHIS’s and petitioners’\nassertions to be convincing. I cannot say that I would\nhave found otherwise. It was reasonable for the court to\nconclude that planting could not go forward until more\n——————\ncannot monitor such limits, rules that protect these or any other parties\nmay be merely hortatory in practice. Moreover, although we have not\nsquarely addressed the issue, in my view “[t]here is no general re\nquirement that an injunction affect only the parties in the suit.”\nBresgal v. Brock, 843 F. 2d 1163, 1169 (CA9 1987).

See ante, at 22, n. 6. Quite right. As the District\nCourt said to APHIS’s lawyer at that hearing, if the agency issues an\nelaborate set of precautions, “I don’t know how you even start to enforce\nit.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 190a–191a.\n18         MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ncomplete study, presented in an EIS, showed that\nthe known problem of gene flow could, in reality, be\nprevented.14\n   The District Court’s decision that more study was\nneeded to assess whether limits on deregulation could\nprevent environmental damage is further reinforced by\nthe statutory context in which the issue arose. A court’s\nequitable discretion must be guided by “recognized, de\nfined public policy.” Meredith v. Winter Haven, 320 U. S.\n228, 235 (1943); see also Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U. S.\n321, 331 (1944) (explaining that when a court evaluates an\nagency’s decision against the background of a federal\nstatute, the court’s discretion “must be exercised in light of\nthe large objectives of the Act”). Congress recognized in\nNEPA that complex environmental cases often require\nexceptionally sophisticated scientific determinations, and\nthat agency decisions should not be made on the basis of\n“incomplete information.” Marsh v. Oregon Natural Re\nsources Council, 490 U. S. 360, 371 (1989). Congress also\nrecognized that agencies cannot fully weigh the conse\nquences of these decisions without obtaining public com\nments through an EIS. See Robertson v. Methow Valley\nCitizens Council, 490 U. S. 332, 350 (1989).15 While a\ncourt may not presume that a NEPA violation requires an\ninjunction, it may take into account the principles embod\n——————\n   14 I suspect that if APHIS and petitioners had come back to the court\n\nwith more convincing evidence prior to completing an EIS, and moved\nto modify the court’s order, the court would have done so. Indeed, the\nDistrict Court showed a willingness to recalibrate its order when it\namended its judgment just a few months after the judgment’s issuance\nin light of APHIS’s submission that certain requirements were imprac\ntical. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a–114a.\n   15 Accordingly, while “NEPA itself does not mandate particular re\n\nsults,” it does mandate a particular process and embodies the principle\nthat federal agencies should “carefully conside[r] detailed information”\nbefore incurring potential environmental harm.

This District Court had before it\nstrong evidence that gene transmission was likely to occur\nand that limits on growing could not be enforced. It also\nhad a large amount of highly detailed evidence about\nwhether growing restrictions, even if enforced, can prevent\ntransmission. That evidence called into question the\nagency’s own claims regarding the risks posed by partial\nderegulation. In enjoining partial deregulation until it\nhad the benefit of an EIS to help parse the evidence, the\ncourt acted with exactly the sort of caution that Congress\nendorsed in NEPA.\n   Finally, it bears mention that the District Court’s ex\nperience with the case may have given it grounds for\nskepticism about the representations made by APHIS and\npetitioners. Sometimes “one judicial actor is better posi\ntioned than another to decide the issue in question.”\nMiller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 114 (1985). A “district\ncourt may have insights not conveyed by the record.”\nPierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 560 (1988). In this\ncase, the agency had attempted to deregulate RRA without\nan EIS in spite of ample evidence of potential environ\nmental harms. And when the court made clear that the\nagency had violated NEPA, the agency responded by\nseeking to “ ‘streamline’ ” the process, ante, at 18, submit\nting a deregulation proposal with Monsanto that suffered\nfrom some of the same legal and empirical holes as its\ninitial plan to deregulate. Against that background, the\ncourt may have felt it especially prudent to wait for an EIS\nbefore concluding that APHIS could manage RRA’s threat\nto the environment.\n                       *    *     *\n  The District Court in this case was put in an “unenvi\nable position.” Ibid.

However, any\n  person may petition APHIS for a determination that a regulated arti\n  cle does not present a plant pest risk and therefore should not be sub\n  ject to the applicable regulations. APHIS may grant such a petition\n  in whole or in part.\n     In determining whether to grant nonregulated status to a geneti\n  cally engineered plant variety, APHIS must comply with the Na\n  tional Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), which requires fed\n  eral agencies “to the fullest extent possible” to prepare a detailed\n  environmental impact statement (EIS) for “every . . . major Federal\n  actio[n] significantly affecting the quality of the human environ\n  ment.” 42 U. S. C. §4332(2)(C). The agency need not complete an\n  EIS if it finds, based on a shorter statement known as an environ\n  mental assessment (EA), that the proposed action will not have a\n  significant environmental impact.\n     This case involves a challenge to APHIS’s decision to approve the\n  unconditional deregulation of Roundup Ready Alfalfa (RRA), a vari\n  ety of alfalfa that has been genetically engineered to tolerate the her\n  bicide Roundup. Petitioners are the owner and the licensee of the in\n  tellectual property rights to RRA. In response to petitioners’\n2            MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    deregulation request, APHIS prepared a draft EA and solicited public\n    comments on its proposed course of action. Based on its EA and the\n    comments submitted, the agency determined that the introduction of\n    RRA would not have any significant adverse impact on the environ\n    ment. Accordingly, APHIS decided to deregulate RRA uncondition\n    ally and without preparing an EIS. Respondents, conventional al\n    falfa growers and environmental groups, filed this action challenging\n    that decision on the ground that it violated NEPA and other federal\n    laws. The District Court held, inter alia, that APHIS violated NEPA\n    when it deregulated RRA without first completing a detailed EIS. To\n    remedy that violation, the court vacated the agency’s decision com\n    pletely deregulating RRA; enjoined APHIS from deregulating RRA,\n    in whole or in part, pending completion of the EIS; and entered a na\n    tionwide permanent injunction prohibiting almost all future planting\n    of RRA during the pendency of the EIS process. Petitioners and the\n    Government appealed, challenging the scope of the relief granted but\n    not disputing that APHIS’s deregulation decision violated NEPA.\n    The Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding, among other things, that the\n    District Court had not abused its discretion in rejecting APHIS’s pro\n    posed mitigation measures in favor of a broader injunction.\nHeld:\n    1. Respondents have standing to seek injunctive relief, and peti\n tioners have standing to seek this Court’s review of the Ninth Cir\n cuit’s judgment affirming the entry of such relief. Pp. 7–14.\n       (a) Petitioners have constitutional standing to seek review here.\n Article III standing requires an injury that is (i) concrete, particular\n ized, and actual or imminent, (ii) fairly traceable to the challenged\n action, and (iii) redressable by a favorable ruling. See Horne v. Flo\n res, 557 U. S. ___, ___. Petitioners satisfy all three criteria. Petition\n ers are injured by their inability to sell or license RRA to prospective\n customers until APHIS completes the EIS. Because that injury is\n caused by the very remedial order that petitioners challenge on ap\n peal, it would be redressed by a favorable ruling from this Court. Re\n spondents nevertheless contend that petitioners lack standing be\n cause their complained-of injury is independently caused by a part of\n the District Court’s order that petitioners failed to challenge, the va\n catur of APHIS’s deregulation decision. That argument fails for two\n independent reasons. First, one of the main disputes between the\n parties throughout this litigation has been whether the District\n Court should have adopted APHIS’s proposed judgment, which would\n have replaced the vacated deregulation decision with an order ex\n pressly authorizing the continued sale and planting of RRA. Accord\n ingly, if the District Court had adopted APHIS’s proposed judgment,\n there would still be authority for the continued sale of RRA notwith\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nstanding the District Court’s vacatur, because there would, in effect,\nbe a new deregulation decision. Second, petitioners in any case have\nstanding to challenge the part of the District Court’s order enjoining\na partial deregulation. Respondents focus their argument on the part\nof the judgment that enjoins planting, but the judgment also states\nthat before granting the deregulation petition, even in part, the\nagency must prepare an EIS. That part of the judgment inflicts an\ninjury not also caused by the vacatur. Pp. 7–11.\n      (b) Respondents have constitutional standing to seek injunctive\nrelief from the complete deregulation order at issue here. The Court\ndisagrees with petitioners’ argument that respondents have failed to\nshow that any of them is likely to suffer a constitutionally cognizable\ninjury absent injunctive relief. The District Court found that respon\ndent farmers had established a reasonable probability that their con\nventional alfalfa crops would be infected with the engineered\nRoundup Ready gene if RRA were completely deregulated. A sub\nstantial risk of such gene flow injures respondents in several ways\nthat are sufficiently concrete to satisfy the injury-in-fact prong of the\nconstitutional standing analysis. Moreover, those harms are readily\nattributable to APHIS’s deregulation decision, which gives rise to a\nsignificant risk of gene flow to non-genetically-engineered alfalfa va\nrieties. Finally, a judicial order prohibiting the planting or deregula\ntion of all or some genetically engineered alfalfa would redress re\nspondents’ injuries by eliminating or minimizing the risk of gene flow\nto their crops. Pp. 11–14.\n   2. The District Court abused its discretion in enjoining APHIS from\neffecting a partial deregulation and in prohibiting the planting of\nRRA pending the agency’s completion of its detailed environmental\nreview. Pp. 14–22.\n      (a) Because petitioners and the Government do not argue other\nwise, the Court assumes without deciding that the District Court\nacted lawfully in vacating the agency’s decision to completely deregu\nlate RRA. The Court therefore addresses only the injunction prohib\niting APHIS from deregulating RRA pending completion of the EIS,\nand the nationwide injunction prohibiting almost all RRA planting\nduring the pendency of the EIS process. P. 14.\n      (b) Before a court may grant a permanent injunction, the plain\ntiff must satisfy a four-factor test, demonstrating: “(1) that it has suf\nfered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such\nas monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury;\n(3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff\nand defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the pub\nlic interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.” eBay\nInc. v. MercExchange, L. L. C., 547 U. S. 388, 391. This test fully ap\n4            MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    plies in NEPA cases. See Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Coun\n    cil, Inc., 555 U. S. ___, ___. Thus, the existence of a NEPA violation\n    does not create a presumption that injunctive relief is available and\n    should be granted absent unusual circumstances. Pp. 15–16.\n          (c) None of the four factors supports the District Court’s order en\n    joining APHIS from partially deregulating RRA during the pendency\n    of the EIS process. Most importantly, respondents cannot show that\n    they will suffer irreparable injury if APHIS is allowed to proceed with\n    any partial deregulation, for at least two reasons. First, if and when\n    APHIS pursues a partial deregulation that arguably runs afoul of\n    NEPA, respondents may file a new suit challenging such action and\n    seeking appropriate preliminary relief. Accordingly, a permanent in\n    junction is not now needed to guard against any present or imminent\n    risk of likely irreparable harm. Second, a partial deregulation need\n    not cause respondents any injury at all; if its scope is sufficiently lim\n    ited, the risk of gene flow could be virtually nonexistent. Indeed, the\n    broad injunction entered below essentially pre-empts the very proce\n    dure by which APHIS could determine, independently of the pending\n    EIS process for assessing the effects of a complete deregulation, that\n    a limited deregulation would not pose any appreciable risk of envi\n    ronmental harm. Pp. 16–23.\n          (d) The District Court also erred in entering the nationwide in\n    junction against planting RRA, for two independent reasons. First,\n    because it was inappropriate for the District Court to foreclose even\n    the possibility of a partial and temporary deregulation, it follows that\n    it was inappropriate to enjoin planting in accordance with such a de\n    regulation decision. Second, an injunction is a drastic and extraordi\n    nary remedy, which should not be granted as a matter of course. See,\n    e.g., Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S. 305, 312. If, as respon\n    dents now concede, a less drastic remedy (such as partial or complete\n    vacatur of APHIS’s deregulation decision) was sufficient to redress\n    their injury, no recourse to the additional and extraordinary relief of\n    an injunction was warranted. Pp. 23–24.\n          (e) Given the District Court’s errors, this Court need not address\n    whether injunctive relief of some kind was available to respondents\n    on the record below.

The District\nCourt held that APHIS violated the National Environ­\nmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 83 Stat. 852, 42\nU. S. C. §4321 et seq., by issuing its deregulation deci­\nsion without first completing a detailed assessment of\nthe environmental consequences of its proposed course of\naction. To remedy that violation, the District Court\nvacated the agency’s decision completely deregulating\nthe alfalfa variety in question; ordered APHIS not to act\non the deregulation petition in whole or in part until it\nhad completed a detailed environmental review; and\nenjoined almost all future planting of the genetically\nengineered alfalfa pending the completion of that review.\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s entry\nof permanent injunctive relief. The main issue now in\ndispute concerns the breadth of that relief. For the\nreasons set forth below, we reverse and remand for\nfurther proceedings.\n2        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  The Plant Protection Act (PPA), 114 Stat. 438, 7 U. S. C.\n§7701 et seq., provides that the Secretary of the Depart­\nment of Agriculture (USDA) may issue regulations “to\nprevent the introduction of plant pests into the United\nStates or the dissemination of plant pests within the\nUnited States.” §7711(a). The Secretary has delegated\nthat authority to APHIS, a division of the USDA. 7 CFR\n§§2.22(a), 2.80(a)(36) (2010). Acting pursuant to that\ndelegation, APHIS has promulgated regulations governing\n“the introduction of organisms and products altered or\nproduced through genetic engineering that are plant pests\nor are believed to be plant pests.” See §340.0(a)(2) and\nn. 1. Under those regulations, certain genetically engi­\nneered plants are presumed to be “plant pests”—and thus\n“regulated articles” under the PPA—until APHIS deter­\nmines otherwise. See ibid.; §§340.1, 340.2, 340.6; see also\nApp. 183. However, any person may petition APHIS for a\ndetermination that a regulated article does not present a\nplant pest risk and therefore should not be subject to the\napplicable regulations. 7 U. S. C. §7711(c)(2); 7 CFR\n§340.6. APHIS may grant such a petition in whole or in\npart. §340.6(d)(3).\n  In deciding whether to grant nonregulated status to a\ngenetically engineered plant variety, APHIS must comply\nwith NEPA, which requires federal agencies “to the fullest\nextent possible” to prepare an environmental impact\nstatement (EIS) for “every recommendation or report on\nproposals for legislation and other major Federal actio[n]\nsignificantly affecting the quality of the human environ­\nment.”    42 U. S. C. §4332(2)(C).     The statutory text\n“speaks solely in terms of proposed actions; it does not\nrequire an agency to consider the possible environmental\nimpacts of less imminent actions when preparing the\nimpact statement on proposed actions.” Kleppe v. Sierra\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nClub, 427 U. S. 390, 410, n. 20 (1976).\n  An agency need not complete an EIS for a particular\nproposal if it finds, on the basis of a shorter “environ­\nmental assessment” (EA), that the proposed action will not\nhave a significant impact on the environment. 40 CFR\n§§1508.9(a), 1508.13 (2009). Even if a particular agency\nproposal requires an EIS, applicable regulations allow the\nagency to take at least some action in furtherance of that\nproposal while the EIS is being prepared. See §1506.1(a)\n(“no action concerning the proposal shall be taken which\nwould: (1) Have an adverse environmental impact; or (2)\nLimit the choice of reasonable alternatives”); §1506.1(c)\n(“While work on a required program environmental impact\nstatement is in progress and the action is not covered by\nan existing program statement, agencies shall not under­\ntake in the interim any major Federal action covered by\nthe program which may significantly affect the quality of\nthe human environment unless such action” satisfies\ncertain requirements).\n                             B\n   This case involves Roundup Ready Alfalfa (RRA), a kind\nof alfalfa crop that has been genetically engineered to be\ntolerant of glyphosate, the active ingredient of the herbi­\ncide Roundup. Petitioner Monsanto Company (Monsanto)\nowns the intellectual property rights to RRA. Monsanto\nlicenses those rights to co-petitioner Forage Genetics\nInternational (FGI), which is the exclusive developer of\nRRA seed.\n   APHIS initially classified RRA as a regulated article,\nbut in 2004 petitioners sought nonregulated status for two\nstrains of RRA. In response, APHIS prepared a draft EA\nassessing the likely environmental impact of the requested\nderegulation. It then published a notice in the Federal\nRegister advising the public of the deregulation petition\nand soliciting public comments on its draft EA. After\n4        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconsidering the hundreds of public comments that it re­\nceived, APHIS issued a Finding of No Significant Impact\nand decided to deregulate RRA unconditionally and with­\nout preparing an EIS. Prior to this decision, APHIS had\nauthorized almost 300 field trials of RRA conducted over a\nperiod of eight years. App. 348.\n   Approximately eight months after APHIS granted RRA\nnonregulated status, respondents (two conventional alfalfa\nseed farms and environmental groups concerned with food\nsafety) filed this action against the Secretary of Agricul­\nture and certain other officials in Federal District Court,\nchallenging APHIS’s decision to completely deregulate\nRRA. Their complaint alleged violations of NEPA, the\nEndangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), 87 Stat. 884, 16\nU. S. C. §1531 et seq., and the PPA. Respondents did not\nseek preliminary injunctive relief pending resolution of\nthose claims. Hence, RRA enjoyed nonregulated status for\napproximately two years. During that period, more than\n3,000 farmers in 48 States planted an estimated 220,000\nacres of RRA. App. 350.\n   In resolving respondents’ NEPA claim, the District\nCourt accepted APHIS’s determination that RRA does not\nhave any harmful health effects on humans or livestock.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 43a; accord, id., at 45a. Neverthe­\nless, the District Court held that APHIS violated NEPA by\nderegulating RRA without first preparing an EIS. In\nparticular, the court found that APHIS’s EA failed to\nanswer substantial questions concerning two broad conse­\nquences of its proposed action: first, the extent to which\ncomplete deregulation would lead to the transmission of\nthe gene conferring glyphosate tolerance from RRA to\norganic and conventional alfalfa; and, second, the extent to\nwhich the introduction of RRA would contribute to the\ndevelopment of Roundup-resistant weeds. Id., at 52a. In\nlight of its determination that the deregulation decision\nran afoul of NEPA, the District Court dismissed without\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprejudice respondents’ claims under the ESA and PPA.\n   After these rulings, the District Court granted petition­\ners permission to intervene in the remedial phase of the\nlawsuit. The court then asked the parties to submit pro­\nposed judgments embodying their preferred means of\nremedying the NEPA violation. APHIS’s proposed judg­\nment would have ordered the agency to prepare an EIS,\nvacated the agency’s deregulation decision, and replaced\nthat decision with the terms of the judgment itself. Id., at\n184a (proposed judgment providing that “[the federal]\ndefendants’ [June 14,] 2005 Determination of Nonregu­\nlated Status for Alfalfa Genetically Engineered for Toler­\nance to the Herbicide Glyphosate is hereby vacated and\nreplaced by the terms of this judgment” (emphasis added)).\nThe terms of the proposed judgment, in turn, would have\npermitted the continued planting of RRA pending comple­\ntion of the EIS, subject to six restrictions. Those restric­\ntions included, among other things, mandatory isolation\ndistances between RRA and non-genetically-engineered\nalfalfa fields in order to mitigate the risk of gene flow;\nmandatory harvesting conditions; a requirement that\nplanting and harvesting equipment that had been in\ncontact with RRA be cleaned prior to any use with conven­\ntional or organic alfalfa; identification and handling re­\nquirements for RRA seed; and a requirement that all RRA\nseed producers and hay growers be under contract with\neither Monsanto or FGI and that their contracts require\ncompliance with the other limitations set out in the pro­\nposed judgment.\n   The District Court rejected APHIS’s proposed judgment.\nIn its preliminary injunction, the District Court prohibited\nalmost all future planting of RRA pending APHIS’s com­\npletion of the required EIS. But in order to minimize the\nharm to farmers who had relied on APHIS’s deregulation\ndecision, the court expressly allowed those who had al­\nready purchased RRA to plant their seeds until March 30,\n6        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n2007. Id., at 58a. In its subsequently entered permanent\ninjunction and judgment, the court (1) vacated APHIS’s\nderegulation decision; (2) ordered APHIS to prepare an\nEIS before it made any decision on Monsanto’s deregula­\ntion petition; (3) enjoined the planting of any RRA in the\nUnited States after March 30, 2007, pending APHIS’s\ncompletion of the required EIS; and (4) imposed certain\nconditions (suggested by APHIS) on the handling and\nidentification of already-planted RRA. Id., at 79a, 109a.\nThe District Court denied petitioners’ request for an evi­\ndentiary hearing.\n   The Government, Monsanto, and FGI appealed, chal­\nlenging the scope of the relief granted but not disputing\nthe existence of a NEPA violation. See Geertson Seed\nFarms v. Johanns, 570 F. 3d 1130, 1136 (2009). A divided\npanel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit af­\nfirmed. Based on its review of the record, the panel first\nconcluded that the District Court had “recognized that an\ninjunction does not ‘automatically issue’ when a NEPA\nviolation is found” and had instead based its issuance of\ninjunctive relief on the four-factor test traditionally used\nfor that purpose. Id., at 1137. The panel held that the\nDistrict Court had not committed clear error in making\nany of the subsidiary factual findings on which its assess­\nment of the four relevant factors was based. And the\npanel rejected the claim that the District Court had not\ngiven sufficient deference to APHIS’s expertise concerning\nthe likely effects of allowing continued planting of RRA on\na limited basis. In the panel’s view, APHIS’s proposed\ninterim measures would have perpetuated a system that\nhad been found by the District Court to have caused envi­\nronmental harm in the past. Id., at 1139. Hence, the\npanel concluded that the District Court had not abused its\ndiscretion “in choosing to reject APHIS’s proposed mitiga­\ntion measures in favor of a broader injunction to prevent\nmore irreparable harm from occurring.” Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The panel majority also rejected petitioners’ alternative\nargument that the District Court had erred in declining to\nhold an evidentiary hearing before entering its permanent\ninjunction. Writing in dissent, Judge N. Randy Smith\ndisagreed with that conclusion. In his view, the District\nCourt was required to conduct an evidentiary hearing\nbefore issuing a permanent injunction unless the facts\nwere undisputed or the adverse party expressly waived its\nright to such a hearing. Neither of those two exceptions,\nhe found, applied here.\n  We granted certiorari. 558 U. S. __ (2010).\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n   At the threshold, respondents contend that petitioners\nlack standing to seek our review of the lower court rulings\nat issue here. We disagree.\n   Standing under Article III of the Constitution requires\nthat an injury be concrete, particularized, and actual or\nimminent; fairly traceable to the challenged action; and\nredressable by a favorable ruling. Horne v. Flores, 557\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8). Petitioners here sat­\nisfy all three criteria. Petitioners are injured by their\ninability to sell or license RRA to prospective customers\nuntil such time as APHIS completes the required EIS.\nBecause that injury is caused by the very remedial order\nthat petitioners challenge on appeal, it would be redressed\nby a favorable ruling from this Court.\n   Respondents do not dispute that petitioners would have\nstanding to contest the District Court’s permanent injunc­\ntion order if they had pursued a different litigation strat­\negy. Instead, respondents argue that the injury of which\npetitioners complain is independently caused by a part of\nthe District Court’s order that petitioners failed to chal­\nlenge, namely, the vacatur of APHIS’s deregulation deci­\nsion. The practical consequence of the vacatur, respon­\n8        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndents contend, was to restore RRA to the status of a regu­\nlated article; and, subject to certain exceptions not appli­\ncable here, federal regulations ban the growth and sale of\nregulated articles. Because petitioners did not specifically\nchallenge the District Court’s vacatur, respondents reason,\nthey lack standing to challenge a part of the District\nCourt’s order (i.e., the injunction) that does not cause\npetitioners any injury not also caused by the vacatur. See\nBrief for Respondents 19–20.\n   Respondents’ argument fails for two independent rea­\nsons. First, although petitioners did not challenge the\nvacatur directly, they adequately preserved their objection\nthat the vacated deregulation decision should have been\nreplaced by APHIS’s proposed injunction. Throughout the\nremedial phase of this litigation, one of the main disputes\nbetween the parties has been whether the District Court\nwas required to adopt APHIS’s proposed judgment. See,\ne.g., Intervenor-Appellants’ Opening Brief in No. 07–16458\netc. (CA9), p. 59 (urging the Court of Appeals to “vacate\nthe district court’s judgment and remand this case to the\ndistrict court with instructions to enter APHIS’s proposed\nrelief”); Opening Brief of Federal Defendants-Appellants\nin No. 16458 etc. (CA9), pp. 21, 46 (“The blanket injunc­\ntion should be narrowed in accordance with APHIS’s\nproposal”); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, 25–27, 53–54. That\njudgment would have replaced the vacated deregulation\ndecision with an order expressly allowing continued plant­\ning of RRA subject to certain limited conditions. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 184a (proposed judgment providing that\n“[the federal] defendants’ 14 June 2005 Determination of\nNonregulated Status for Alfalfa Genetically Engineered\nfor Tolerance to the Herbicide Glyphosate is hereby va­\ncated and replaced by the terms of this judgment” (empha­\nsis added)). Accordingly, if the District Court had adopted\nthe agency’s suggested remedy, there would still be au­\nthority for the continued planting of RRA, because there\n                    Cite as: 561 U.

Respondents focus their standing ar­\ngument on the part of the judgment enjoining the planting\nof RRA, but the judgment also states that “[b]efore grant­\ning Monsanto’s deregulation petition, even in part, the\nfederal defendants shall prepare an environmental impact\nstatement.” Id., at 108a (emphasis added); see also id., at\n79a (“The Court will enter a final judgment . . . ordering\nthe government to prepare an EIS before it makes a deci­\nsion on Monsanto’s deregulation petition”). As respon­\ndents concede, that part of the judgment goes beyond the\nvacatur of APHIS’s deregulation decision. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 37, 46.\n   At oral argument, respondents contended that the re­\ntriction on APHIS’s ability to effect a partial deregulation\nof RRA does not cause petitioners “an actual or an immi­\nnent harm.” Id., at 39–40. In order for a partial deregula­\ntion to occur, respondents argued, the case would have to\nbe remanded to the agency, and APHIS would have to\nprepare an EA “that may or may not come out in favor of a\npartial deregulation.” Id., at 39. Because petitioners\ncannot prove that those two events would happen, respon­\ndents contended, the asserted harm caused by the District\nCourt’s partial deregulation ban is too speculative to\nsatisfy the actual or imminent injury requirement.\n   We reject this argument. If the injunction were lifted,\nwe do not see why the District Court would have to re­\nmand the matter to the agency in order for APHIS to\neffect a partial deregulation. And even if a remand were\n\n——————\n  1 We need not decide whether the District Court had the authority to\nreplace the vacated agency order with an injunction of its own making.\nThe question whether petitioners are entitled to the relief that they\nseek goes to the merits, not to standing.\n10        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrequired, we perceive no basis on which the District Court\ncould decline to remand the matter to the agency so that it\ncould determine whether to pursue a partial deregulation\nduring the pendency of the EIS process.\n   Nor is any doubt as to whether APHIS would issue a\nnew EA in favor of a partial deregulation sufficient to\ndefeat petitioners’ standing. It is undisputed that peti­\ntioners have submitted a deregulation petition and that a\npartial deregulation of the kind embodied in the agency’s\nproposed judgment would afford petitioners much of the\nrelief that they seek; it is also undisputed that, absent the\nDistrict Court’s order, APHIS could attempt to effect such\na partial deregulation pending its completion of the EIS.\nSee id., at 7–8, 25–27, 38. For purposes of resolving the\nparticular standing question before us, we need not decide\nwhether or to what extent a party challenging an injunc­\ntion that bars an agency from granting certain relief must\nshow that the agency would be likely to afford such relief\nif it were free to do so. In this case, as is clear from\nAPHIS’s proposed judgment and from its briefing\nthroughout the remedial phase of this litigation, the\nagency takes the view that a partial deregulation reflect­\ning its proposed limitations is in the public interest. Thus,\nthere is more than a strong likelihood that APHIS would\npartially deregulate RRA were it not for the District\nCourt’s injunction. The District Court’s elimination of\nthat likelihood is plainly sufficient to establish a constitu­\ntionally cognizable injury. Moreover, as respondents\nessentially conceded at oral argument, that injury would\nbe redressed by a favorable decision here, since “vacating\nthe current injunction . . . will allow [petitioners] to go\nback to the agency, [to] seek a partial deregulation,” even\nif the District Court’s vacatur of APHIS’s deregulation\ndecision is left intact. Id., at 38. We therefore hold that\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npetitioners have standing to seek this Court’s review.2\n                              B\n   We next consider petitioners’ contention that respon­\ndents lack standing to seek injunctive relief. See Daim\nlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332, 352 (2006) (“[A]\nplaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for each\nform of relief sought” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nPetitioners argue that respondents have failed to show\nthat any of the named respondents is likely to suffer a\nconstitutionally cognizable injury absent injunctive relief.\nSee Brief for Petitioners 40. We disagree.\n   Respondents include conventional alfalfa farmers.\nEmphasizing “the undisputed concentration of alfalfa seed\nfarms,” the District Court found that those farmers had\n“established a ‘reasonable probability’ that their organic\nand conventional alfalfa crops will be infected with the\nengineered gene” if RRA is completely deregulated. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 50a.3 A substantial risk of gene flow\n——————\n   2 We do not rest “the primary basis for our jurisdiction on the premise\n\nthat the District Court enjoined APHIS from partially deregulating\nRRA in any sense.” See post, at 7 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Even if the\nDistrict Court’s order prohibiting a partial deregulation applies only to\n“the particular partial deregulation order proposed to the court by\nAPHIS,” see post, at 8, petitioners would still have standing to chal­\nlenge that aspect of the order.\n   3At least one of the respondents in this case specifically alleges that\n\nhe owns an alfalfa farm in a prominent seed-growing region and faces a\nsignificant risk of contamination from RRA. See Record, Doc. 62, pp. 1–\n2; id., ¶10, at 3–4 (Declaration of Phillip Geertson in Support of Plan­\ntiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment) (“Since alfalfa is pollinated by\nhoney, bumble and leafcutter bees, the genetic contamination of the\nRoundup Ready seed will rapidly spread through the seed growing\nregions. Bees have a range of at least two to ten miles, and the alfalfa\nseed farms are much more concentrated”). Other declarations in the\nrecord provide further support for the District Court’s conclusion that\nthe deregulation of RRA poses a significant risk of contamination to\nrespondents’ crops. See, e.g., id., Doc. 53, ¶9, at 2 (Declaration of Jim\nMunsch) (alleging risk of “significant contamination . . . due to the\n12         MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ninjures respondents in several ways. For example, re­\nspondents represent that, in order to continue marketing\ntheir product to consumers who wish to buy non­\ngenetically-engineered alfalfa, respondents would have to\nconduct testing to find out whether and to what extent\ntheir crops have been contaminated. See, e.g., Record,\nDoc. 62, p. 5 (Declaration of Phillip Geertson in Support of\nPlantiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment) (hereinafter\nGeertson Declaration) (“Due to the high potential for\ncontamination, I will need to test my crops for the pres­\nence of genetically engineered alfalfa seed. This testing\nwill be a new cost to my seed business and we will have to\nraise our seed prices to cover these costs, making our\nprices less competitive”); id., Doc. 57, p. 4 (Declaration of\nPatrick Trask in Support of Plantiff’s Motion for Summary\nJudgment) (“To ensure that my seeds are pure, I will need\nto test my crops and obtain certification that my seeds are\nfree of genetically engineered alfalfa”); see also Record,\nDoc. 55, p. 2 (“There is zero tolerance for contaminated\nseed in the organic market”). Respondents also allege that\nthe risk of gene flow will cause them to take certain meas­\nures to minimize the likelihood of potential contamination\nand to ensure an adequate supply of non-genetically­\nengineered alfalfa. See, e.g., Geertson Declaration 3 (not­\ning the “increased cost of alfalfa breeding due to potential\nfor genetic contamination”); id., at 6 (“Due to the threat of\ncontamination, I have begun contracting with growers\noutside of the United States to ensure that I can supply\ngenetically pure, conventional alfalfa seed. Finding new\ngrowers has already resulted in increased administrative\n——————\ncompact geographic area of the prime alfalfa seed producing areas and\nthe fact that pollen is distributed by bees that have large natural range\nof activity”); App. ¶8, p. 401 (Declaration of Marc Asumendi) (“Roundup\nalfalfa seed fields are currently being planted in all the major alfalfa\nseed production areas with little regard to contamination to non-GMO\nseed production fields”).\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncosts at my seed business”).\n   Such harms, which respondents will suffer even if their\ncrops are not actually infected with the Roundup ready\ngene, are sufficiently concrete to satisfy the injury-in-fact\nprong of the constitutional standing analysis. Those\nharms are readily attributable to APHIS’s deregulation\ndecision, which, as the District Court found, gives rise to a\nsignificant risk of gene flow to non-genetically-engineered\nvarieties of alfalfa. Finally, a judicial order prohibiting\nthe growth and sale of all or some genetically engineered\nalfalfa would remedy respondents’ injuries by eliminating\nor minimizing the risk of gene flow to conventional and\norganic alfalfa crops. We therefore conclude that respon­\ndents have constitutional standing to seek injunctive relief\nfrom the complete deregulation order at issue here.\n   Petitioners appear to suggest that respondents fail to\nsatisfy the “zone of interests” test we have previously\narticulated as a prudential standing requirement in cases\nchallenging agency compliance with particular statutes.\nSee Reply Brief for Petitioners 12 (arguing that protection\nagainst the risk of commercial harm “is not an interest\nthat NEPA was enacted to address”); Bennett v. Spear, 520\nU. S. 154, 162–163 (1997). That argument is unpersua­\nsive because, as the District Court found, respondents’\ninjury has an environmental as well as an economic com­\nponent. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a. In its ruling on the\nmerits of respondents’ NEPA claim, the District Court\nheld that the risk that the RRA gene conferring gly­\nphosate resistance will infect conventional and organic\nalfalfa is a significant environmental effect within the\nmeaning of NEPA. Petitioners did not appeal that part of\nthe court’s ruling, and we have no occasion to revisit it\nhere. Respondents now seek injunctive relief in order to\navert the risk of gene flow to their crops—the very same\neffect that the District Court determined to be a signifi­\ncant environmental concern for purposes of NEPA. The\n14        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmere fact that respondents also seek to avoid certain\neconomic harms that are tied to the risk of gene flow does\nnot strip them of prudential standing.\n  In short, respondents have standing to seek injunctive\nrelief, and petitioners have standing to seek this Court’s\nreview of the Ninth Circuit’s judgment affirming the entry\nof such relief. We therefore proceed to the merits of the\ncase.\n                              III \n\n                               A\n\n   The District Court sought to remedy APHIS’s NEPA\nviolation in three ways: First, it vacated the agency’s\ndecision completely deregulating RRA; second, it enjoined\nAPHIS from deregulating RRA, in whole or in part, pend­\ning completion of the mandated EIS; and third, it entered\na nationwide injunction prohibiting almost all future\nplanting of RRA. Id., at 108a–110a. Because petitioners\nand the Government do not argue otherwise, we assume\nwithout deciding that the District Court acted lawfully in\nvacating the deregulation decision. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7\n(“[T]he district court could have vacated the order in its\nentirety and sent it back to the agency”); accord, id., at 15–\n16. We therefore address only the latter two aspects of the\nDistrict Court’s judgment. Before doing so, however, we\nprovide a brief overview of the standard governing the\nentry of injunctive relief.\n                              B\n  “[A] plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must\nsatisfy a four-factor test before a court may grant such\nrelief. A plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) that it has suf­\nfered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at\nlaw, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to com­\npensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of\nhardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest\nwould not be disserved by a permanent injunction.” eBay\nInc. v. MercExchange, L. L. C., 547 U. S. 388, 391 (2006).\nThe traditional four-factor test applies when a plaintiff\nseeks a permanent injunction to remedy a NEPA violation.\nSee Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555\nU. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 21–23).\n   Petitioners argue that the lower courts in this case\nproceeded on the erroneous assumption that an injunction\nis generally the appropriate remedy for a NEPA violation.\nIn particular, petitioners note that the District Court cited\npre-Winter Ninth Circuit precedent for the proposition\nthat, in “ ‘the run of the mill NEPA case,’ ” an injunction\ndelaying the contemplated government project is proper\n“ ‘until the NEPA violation is cured.’ ” App. to Pet. for\nCert. 65a (quoting Idaho Watersheds Project v. Hahn, 307\nF. 3d 815, 833 (CA9 2002)); see also App. to Pet. for Cert.\n55a (quoting same language in preliminary injunction\norder). In addition, petitioners observe, the District Court\nand the Court of Appeals in this case both stated that, “in\nunusual circumstances, an injunction may be withheld, or,\nmore likely, limited in scope” in NEPA cases. Id., at 66a\n(quoting National Parks & Conservation Assn. v. Babbitt,\n241 F. 3d 722, 737, n. 18 (CA9 2001) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)); 570 F. 3d, at 1137.\n   Insofar as the statements quoted above are intended to\nguide the determination whether to grant injunctive relief,\nthey invert the proper mode of analysis. An injunction\nshould issue only if the traditional four-factor test is satis­\nfied. See Winter, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 21–24). In\ncontrast, the statements quoted above appear to presume\nthat an injunction is the proper remedy for a NEPA viola­\ntion except in unusual circumstances. No such thumb on\nthe scales is warranted. Nor, contrary to the reasoning of\nthe Court of Appeals, could any such error be cured by a\ncourt’s perfunctory recognition that “an injunction does\n16          MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnot automatically issue” in NEPA cases. See 570 F. 3d, at\n1137 (internal quotation marks omitted). It is not enough\nfor a court considering a request for injunctive relief to ask\nwhether there is a good reason why an injunction should\nnot issue; rather, a court must determine that an injunc­\ntion should issue under the traditional four-factor test set\nout above.\n   Notwithstanding the lower courts’ apparent reliance on\nthe incorrect standard set out in the pre-Winter Circuit\nprecedents quoted above, respondents argue that the\nlower courts in fact applied the traditional four-factor test.\nIn their view, the statements that injunctive relief is\nproper in the “run-of-the-mill” NEPA case, and that such\ninjunctions are granted except in “unusual circumstances,”\nare descriptive rather than prescriptive. See Brief for\nRespondents 28, n. 14. We need not decide whether re­\nspondents’ characterization of the lower court opinions in\nthis case is sound. Even if it is, the injunctive relief\ngranted here cannot stand.\n                            C\n  We first consider whether the District Court erred in\nenjoining APHIS from partially deregulating RRA during\nthe pendency of the EIS process.4\n  The relevant part of the District Court’s judgment states\nthat, “[b]efore granting Monsanto’s deregulation petition,\n——————\n  4 Petitionersfocus their challenge on the part of the District Court’s\norder prohibiting the planting of RRA. As we explain below, however,\nthe broad injunction against planting cannot be valid if the injunction\nagainst partial deregulation is improper. See infra, at 23; see also App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 64a (District Court order recognizing that APHIS’s\nproposed remedy “seek[s], in effect, a partial deregulation that permits\nthe continued expansion of the Roundup Ready alfalfa market subject\nto certain conditions” (emphasis added)). The validity of the injunction\nprohibiting partial deregulation is therefore properly before us. Like\nthe District Court, we use the term “partial deregulation” to refer to\nany limited or conditional deregulation. See id., at 64a, 69a.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\neven in part, the federal defendants shall prepare an\nenvironmental impact statement.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n108a (emphasis added); see also id., at 79a (“The Court\nwill enter a final judgment . . . ordering the government to\nprepare an EIS before it makes a decision on Monsanto’s\nderegulation petition”). The plain text of the order prohib­\nits any partial deregulation, not just the particular partial\nderegulation embodied in APHIS’s proposed judgment.\nWe think it is quite clear that the District Court meant\njust what it said. The related injunction against planting\nstates that “no [RRA] . . . may be planted” “[u]ntil the\nfederal defendants prepare the EIS and decide the deregu­\nlation petition.” Id., at 108a (emphasis added). That\ninjunction, which appears in the very same judgment and\ndirectly follows the injunction against granting Mon­\nsanto’s petition “even in part,” does not carve out an ex­\nception for planting subsequently authorized by a valid\npartial deregulation decision.\n   In our view, none of the traditional four factors govern­\ning the entry of permanent injunctive relief supports the\nDistrict Court’s injunction prohibiting partial deregula­\ntion. To see why that is so, it is helpful to understand how\nthe injunction prohibiting a partial deregulation fits into\nthe broader dispute between the parties.\n   Respondents in this case brought suit under the APA to\nchallenge a particular agency order: APHIS’s decision to\ncompletely deregulate RRA. The District Court held that\nthe order in question was procedurally defective, and\nAPHIS decided not to appeal that determination. At that\npoint, it was for the agency to decide whether and to what\nextent it would pursue a partial deregulation. If the\nagency found, on the basis of a new EA, that a limited and\ntemporary deregulation satisfied applicable statutory and\nregulatory requirements, it could proceed with such a\nderegulation even if it had not yet finished the onerous\nEIS required for complete deregulation. If and when the\n18         MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nagency were to issue a partial deregulation order, any\nparty aggrieved by that order could bring a separate suit\nunder the Administrative Procedure Act to challenge the\nparticular deregulation attempted. See 5 U. S. C. §702.\n   In this case, APHIS apparently sought to “streamline”\nthe proceedings by asking the District Court to craft a\nremedy that, in effect, would have partially deregulated\nRRA until such time as the agency had finalized the EIS\nneeded for a complete deregulation. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n16, 23–24; App. to Pet. for Cert. 69a. To justify that dispo­\nsition, APHIS and petitioners submitted voluminous\ndocumentary submissions in which they purported to show\nthat the risk of gene flow would be insignificant if the\nDistrict Court allowed limited planting and harvesting\nsubject to APHIS’s proposed conditions. Respondents, in\nturn, submitted considerable evidence of their own that\nseemed to cut the other way. This put the District Court\nin an unenviable position. “The parties’ experts disagreed\nover virtually every factual issue relating to possible\nenvironmental harm, including the likelihood of genetic\ncontamination and why some contamination had already\noccurred.” 570 F. 3d, at 1135.\n   The District Court may well have acted within its dis­\ncretion in refusing to craft a judicial remedy that would\nhave authorized the continued planting and harvesting of\nRRA while the EIS is being prepared. It does not follow,\nhowever, that the District Court was within its rights in\nenjoining APHIS from allowing such planting and harvest­\ning pursuant to the authority vested in the agency by law.\nWhen the District Court entered its permanent injunction,\nAPHIS had not yet exercised its authority to partially\nderegulate RRA. Until APHIS actually seeks to effect a\npartial deregulation, any judicial review of such a decision\nis premature.5\n——————\n 5 NEPA   provides that an EIS must be “include[d] in every recommen­\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Even if the District\nCourt was not required to adopt that judgment, there was\nno need to stop the agency from effecting a partial deregu­\nlation in accordance with the procedures established by\nlaw. Moreover, the terms of the District Court’s injunction\ndo not just enjoin the particular partial deregulation\nembodied in APHIS’s proposed judgment. Instead, the\nDistrict Court barred the agency from pursuing any de­\nregulation—no matter how limited the geographic area in\nwhich planting of RRA would be allowed, how great the\nisolation distances mandated between RRA fields and\nfields for growing non-genetically-engineered alfalfa, how\nstringent the regulations governing harvesting and distri­\nbution, how robust the enforcement mechanisms available\n\n——————\ndation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal\nactions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.”\n42 U. S. C. §4332(2)(C) (emphasis added); see also Kleppe v. Sierra\nClub, 427 U. S. 390, 406 (1976) (“A court has no authority to depart\nfrom the statutory language and . . . determine a point during the\ngermination process of a potential proposal at which an impact state­\nment should be prepared” (first emphasis added)). When a particular\nagency proposal exists and requires the preparation of an EIS, NEPA\nregulations allow the agency to take at least some action pertaining to\nthat proposal during the pendency of the EIS process. See 40 CFR\n§§1506.1(a), (c) (2009). We do not express any view on the Govern­\nment’s contention that a limited deregulation of the kind embodied in\nits proposed judgment would not require the prior preparation of an\nEIS. See Brief for Federal Respondents 21–22 (citing §1506.1(a)); Tr. of\nOral Arg. 20 (“what we were proposing for the interim, that is allowing\ncontinued planting subject to various protective measures, was funda­\nmentally different from the action on which the EIS was being pre­\npared”). Because APHIS has not yet invoked the procedures necessary\nto attempt a limited deregulation, any judicial consideration of such\nissues is not warranted at this time.\n20        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nat the time of the decision, and—consequently—no matter\nhow small the risk that the planting authorized under\nsuch conditions would adversely affect the environment in\ngeneral and respondents in particular.\n   The order enjoining any partial deregulation was also\ninconsistent with other aspects of the very same judgment.\nIn fashioning its remedy for the NEPA violation, the\nDistrict Court steered a “middle course” between more\nextreme options on either end. See id., at 1136. On the\none hand, the District Court rejected APHIS’s proposal\n(supported by petitioners) to allow continued planting and\nharvesting of RRA subject to the agency’s proposed limita­\ntions. On the other hand, the District Court did not bar\ncontinued planting of RRA as a regulated article under\npermit from APHIS, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a, and it\nexpressly allowed farmers to harvest and sell RRA planted\nbefore March 30, 2007, id., at 76a–79a. If the District\nCourt was right to conclude that any partial deregulation,\nno matter how limited, required the preparation of an EIS,\nit is hard to see why the limited planting and harvesting\nthat the District Court allowed did not also require the\npreparation of an EIS. Conversely, if the District Court\nwas right to conclude that the limited planting and har­\nvesting it allowed did not require the preparation of an\nEIS, then an appropriately limited partial deregulation\nshould likewise have been possible.\n   Based on the analysis set forth above, it is clear that the\norder enjoining any deregulation whatsoever does not\nsatisfy the traditional four-factor test for granting perma­\nnent injunctive relief. Most importantly, respondents\ncannot show that they will suffer irreparable injury if\nAPHIS is allowed to proceed with any partial deregula­\ntion, for at least two independent reasons.\n   First, if and when APHIS pursues a partial deregulation\nthat arguably runs afoul of NEPA, respondents may file a\nnew suit challenging such action and seeking appropriate\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npreliminary relief. See 5 U. S. C. §§702, 705. Accordingly,\na permanent injunction is not now needed to guard\nagainst any present or imminent risk of likely irreparable\nharm.\n   Second, a partial deregulation need not cause respon­\ndents any injury at all, much less irreparable injury; if the\nscope of the partial deregulation is sufficiently limited, the\nrisk of gene flow to their crops could be virtually nonexis­\ntent. For example, suppose that APHIS deregulates RRA\nonly in a remote part of the country in which respondents\nneither grow nor intend to grow non-genetically­\nengineered alfalfa, and in which no conventional alfalfa\nfarms are currently located. Suppose further that APHIS\nissues an accompanying administrative order mandating\nisolation distances so great as to eliminate any apprecia­\nble risk of gene flow to the crops of conventional farmers\nwho might someday choose to plant in the surrounding\narea. See, e.g., Brief in Opposition 9, n. 6 (quoting study\nconcluding “ ‘that in order for there to be zero tolerance of\nany gene flow between a [RRA] seed field and a conven­\ntional seed field, those fields would have to have a five­\nmile isolation distance between them’ ”); see also Tr. of\nOral Arg. 15–16 (representation from the Solicitor General\nthat APHIS may impose conditions on the deregulation of\nRRA via issuance of an administrative order). Finally,\nsuppose that APHIS concludes in a new EA that its lim­\nited deregulation would not pose a significant risk of gene\nflow or harmful weed development, and that the agency\nadopts a plan to police vigorously compliance with its\nadministrative order in the limited geographic area in\nquestion. It is hard to see how respondents could show\nthat such a limited deregulation would cause them likely\nirreparable injury. (Respondents in this case do not repre­\nsent a class, so they could not seek to enjoin such an order\non the ground that it might cause harm to other parties.)\nIn any case, the District Court’s order prohibiting any\n22          MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npartial deregulation improperly relieves respondents of\ntheir burden to make the requisite evidentiary showing.6\n   Of course, APHIS might ultimately choose not to par­\ntially deregulate RRA during the pendency of the EIS, or\nelse to pursue the kind of partial deregulation embodied in\nits proposed judgment rather than the very limited de­\nregulation envisioned in the above hypothetical. Until\nsuch time as the agency decides whether and how to exer­\ncise its regulatory authority, however, the courts have no\ncause to intervene. Indeed, the broad injunction entered\nhere essentially pre-empts the very procedure by which\nthe agency could determine, independently of the pending\nEIS process for assessing the effects of a complete deregu­\nlation, that a limited deregulation would not pose any\nappreciable risk of environmental harm. See 40 CFR\n§§1501.4, 1508.9(a) (2009).\n   In sum, we do not know whether and to what extent\nAPHIS would seek to effect a limited deregulation during\nthe pendency of the EIS process if it were free to do so; we\ndo know that the vacatur of APHIS’s deregulation decision\nmeans that virtually no RRA can be grown or sold until\nsuch time as a new deregulation decision is in place, and\nwe also know that any party aggrieved by a hypothetical\nfuture deregulation decision will have ample opportunity\n——————\n   6 The District Court itself appears to have recognized that its broad\n\ninjunction may not have been necessary to avert any injury to respon­\ndents. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 191a (“It does complicate it to try to\nfine-tune a particular remedy. So the simpler the remedy, the more\nattractive it is from the Court’s point of view, because it appears to me\nenforcement is easier.

In light of these\nparticular circumstances, we hold that the District Court\ndid not properly exercise its discretion in enjoining a\npartial deregulation of any kind pending APHIS’s prepa­\nration of an EIS. It follows that the Court of Appeals\nerred in affirming that aspect of the District Court’s\njudgment.\n                             D\n   We now turn to petitioners’ claim that the District Court\nerred in entering a nationwide injunction against planting\nRRA. Petitioners argue that the District Court did not\napply the right test for determining whether to enter\npermanent injunctive relief; that, even if the District\nCourt identified the operative legal standard, it erred as a\nmatter of law in applying that standard to the facts of this\ncase; and that the District Court was required to grant\npetitioners an evidentiary hearing to resolve contested\nissues of fact germane to the remedial dispute between the\nparties. We agree that the District Court’s injunction\nagainst planting went too far, but we come to that conclu­\nsion for two independent reasons.\n   First, the impropriety of the District Court’s broad\ninjunction against planting flows from the impropriety of\nits injunction against partial deregulation. If APHIS may\npartially deregulate RRA before preparing a full-blown\nEIS—a question that we need not and do not decide here—\nfarmers should be able to grow and sell RRA in accordance\nwith that agency determination. Because it was inappro­\npriate for the District Court to foreclose even the possibil­\nity of a partial and temporary deregulation, it necessarily\nfollows that it was likewise inappropriate to enjoin any\nand all parties from acting in accordance with the terms of\nsuch a deregulation decision.\n   Second, respondents have represented to this Court that\n24       MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe District Court’s injunction against planting does not\nhave any meaningful practical effect independent of its\nvacatur. See Brief for Respondents 24; see also Tr. of Oral\nArg. 37 (“[T]he mistake that was made [by the District\nCourt] was in not appreciating . . . that the vacatur did\nhave [the] effect” of independently prohibiting the growth\nand sale of almost all RRA). An injunction is a drastic and\nextraordinary remedy, which should not be granted as a\nmatter of course. See, e.g., Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo,\n456 U. S. 305, 311–312 (1982). If a less drastic remedy\n(such as partial or complete vacatur of APHIS’s deregula­\ntion decision) was sufficient to redress respondents’ injury,\nno recourse to the additional and extraordinary relief of an\ninjunction was warranted. See ibid.; see also Winter, 555\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 21–23).\n                             E\n   In sum, the District Court abused its discretion in en­\njoining APHIS from effecting a partial deregulation and in\nprohibiting the possibility of planting in accordance with\nthe terms of such a deregulation. Given those errors, this\nCourt need not express any view on whether injunctive\nrelief of some kind was available to respondents on the\nrecord before us. Nor does the Court address the question\nwhether the District Court was required to conduct an\nevidentiary hearing before entering the relief at issue\nhere. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

See App. to Pet. for Cert. 38a,\n54a, 62a. Second, even planting in a controlled setting\nhad led to contamination in some instances. See id., at\n69a–70a. Third, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection\nService (APHIS) has limited ability to monitor or enforce\nlimitations on planting. See id., at 70a. And fourth,\ngenetic contamination from RRA could decimate farmers’\nlivelihoods and the American alfalfa market for years to\ncome. See id., at 71a; see also id., at 29a–30a. Instead,\nthe majority faults the District Court for “enjoining\nAPHIS from partially deregulating RRA.” Ante, at 16.\n   In my view, the District Court may not have actually\nordered such relief, and we should not so readily assume\nthat it did. Regardless, the District Court did not abuse\nits discretion when, after considering the voluminous\nrecord and making the aforementioned findings, it issued\nthe order now before us.\n                           I\n  To understand the District Court’s judgment, it is nec\nessary to understand the background of this litigation.\nPetitioner Monsanto Company (Monsanto) is a large cor\n2        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nporation that has long produced a weed killer called\nRoundup. After years of experimentation, Monsanto and\nco-petitioner Forage Genetics International (FGI) geneti\ncally engineered a mutation in the alfalfa genome that\nmakes the plant immune to Roundup. Monsanto and\nFGI’s new product, RRA, is “the first crop that has been\nengineered to resist a[n] herbicide” and that can transmit\nthe genetically engineered gene to other plants. See App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 45a.\n   In 2004, in the midst of a deregulatory trend in the\nagricultural sector, petitioners asked APHIS to deregulate\nRRA, thereby allowing it to be sold and planted nation\nwide. App. 101a. Rather than conducting a detailed\nanalysis and preparing an “environmental impact state\nment” (EIS), as required by the National Environmental\nPolicy Act of 1969 (NEPA) for every “major Federal ac\ntio[n] significantly affecting the quality of the human\nenvironment,” 42 U. S. C. §4332(2)(C), APHIS merely\nconducted an abbreviated “environmental assessment”\n(EA). During the 6-month period in which APHIS allowed\npublic comment on its EA, the agency received 663 com\nments, 520 of which opposed deregulation. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 29a. Farmers and scientists opined that RRA could\ncontaminate alfalfa that has not been genetically modified,\ndestroying the American export market for alfalfa and,\npotentially, contaminating other plants and breeding a\nnew type of pesticide-resistant weed. Id., at 29a–30a.\n   Despite substantial evidence that RRA genes could\ntransfer to other plants, APHIS issued a Finding of No\nSignificant Impact and agreed to deregulate RRA “uncon\nditionally,” ante, at 4. With no EIS to wait for and no\nregulation blocking its path, petitioners began selling\nRRA. Farmers and environmental groups swiftly brought\nthis lawsuit to challenge APHIS’s decision to deregulate,\nraising claims under NEPA and other statutes.\n   The District Court carefully reviewed a long record and\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)             3\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nfound that “APHIS’s reasons for concluding” that the risks\nof genetic contamination are low were “not ‘convincing.’ ”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 38a. A review of APHIS’s internal\ndocuments showed that individuals within the agency\nwarned that contamination might occur. APHIS rested its\ndecision to deregulate on its assertion that contamination\nrisk is “not significant because it is the organic and con\nventional farmers’ responsibility” to protect themselves\nand the environment. Ibid. Yet the agency drew this\nconclusion without having investigated whether such\nfarmers “can, in fact, protect their crops from contamina\ntion.” Ibid. The District Court likewise found that\nAPHIS’s reasons for disregarding the risk of pesticide\nresistant weeds were speculative and “not convincing.”\nId., at 46a. The agency had merely explained that if\nweeds acquire roundup resistance, farmers can use “ ‘[a]l\nternative herbicides.’ ” Ibid. In light of the “acknowl\nedged” risk of RRA gene transmission and the potential\n“impact on the development of Roundup resistant weeds,”\nthe court concluded that there was a significant possibility\nof serious environmental harm, and granted summary\njudgment for the plaintiffs. Id., at 54a; see also id., at 45a.\n   At this point, the question of remedy arose. The parties\nsubmitted proposed final judgments, and several corpora\ntions with an interest in RRA, including Monsanto, sought\npermission to intervene. The District Court granted their\nmotion and agreed “to give them the opportunity to pre\nsent evidence to assist the court in fashioning the appro\npriate scope of whatever relief is granted.” Id., at 54a\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   While the District Court considered the proposed judg\nments, it issued a preliminary injunction. Ordinarily, the\ncourt explained, the remedy for failure to conduct an EIS\nis to vacate the permit that was unlawfully given—the\nresult of which, in this case, would be to prohibit any use\nof RRA. See id., at 55a; see also id., at 65a. But this case\n4        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                   STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\npresented a special difficulty: Following APHIS’s unlawful\nderegulation order, some farmers had begun planting\ngenetically modified RRA. Id., at 55a. In its preliminary\ninjunction, the District Court ordered that no new RRA\ncould be planted until APHIS completed the EIS or the\ncourt determined that some other relief was appropriate.\nBut, so as to protect these farmers, the court declined to\nprohibit them from “harvesting, using, or selling” any\ncrops they had already planted. Id., at 56a. And “to\nminimize the harm to those growers who intend to immi\nnently plant Roundup Ready alfalfa,” the court permitted\n“[t]hose growers who intend to plant [RRA] in the next\nthree weeks and have already purchased the seed” to go\nahead and plant. Id., at 58a (emphasis deleted). Essen\ntially, the court grandfathered in those farmers who had\nrelied, in good faith, on APHIS’s actions.\n   Before determining the scope of its final judgment, the\nDistrict Court invited the parties and intervenors to sub\nmit “whatever additional evidence” they “wish[ed] to\nprovide,” and it scheduled additional oral argument. Id.,\nat 58a–59a. The parties submitted “competing proposals\nfor permanent injunctive relief.” Id., at 60a. The plain\ntiffs requested that no one—not even the grandfathered-in\nfarmers—be allowed to plant, grow, or harvest RRA until\nthe full EIS had been prepared. Id., at 64a. APHIS and\nthe intervenors instead sought a remedy that would “fa\ncilitat[e] the continued and dramatic growth” of RRA: a\n“partial deregulation” order that would permit planting\nsubject to certain conditions, such as specified minimum\ndistances between RRA and conventional alfalfa and\nspecial cleaning requirements for equipment used on the\ngenetically modified crop. See id., at 60a–64a.\n   The court adopted a compromise. First, it declined to\nadopt the APHIS-Monsanto proposal. APHIS itself had\nacknowledged that “gene transmission could and had\noccurred,” and that RRA “could result in the development\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nof Roundup-resistant weeds.” Id., at 61a–62a. In light of\nthe substantial record evidence of these risks, the court\nwould not agree to a nationwide planting scheme “without\nthe benefit of the development of all the relevant data,” as\nwell as public comment about whether contamination\ncould be controlled. Id., at 68a. The “partial deregulation”\nproposed by petitioners, the court noted, was really “de\nregulation with certain conditions,” id., at 69a—which, for\nthe same reasons given in the court’s earlier order, re\nquires an EIS, ibid. The court pointed out numerous\nproblems with the APHIS-Monsanto proposal. Neither\nAPHIS nor Monsanto had provided “evidence that sug\ngests whether, and to what extent, the proposed interim\nconditions” would actually “be followed,” and comparable\nconditions had failed to prevent contamination in certain\nlimited settings. Id., at 69a–70a. APHIS, moreover,\nconceded that “it does not have the resources to inspect”\nthe RRA that had already been planted, and so could not\npossibly be expected “to adequately monitor the more than\none million acres of [RRA] intervenors estimate [would] be\nplanted” under their proposal. Ibid. That was especially\nproblematic because any plan to limit contamination\ndepended on rules about harvesting, and farmers were\nunlikely to follow those rules. Id., at 71a. “APHIS ha[d]\nstill not made any inquiry” into numerous factual concerns\nraised by the court in its summary judgment order issued\nseveral months earlier. Id., at 70a.\n  Next, the court rejected the plaintiffs’ proposed remedy\nof “enjoin[ing] the harvesting and sale of already planted”\nRRA. Id., at 76a. Although any planting or harvesting of\nRRA poses a contamination risk, the court reasoned that\nthe equities were different for those farmers who had\nalready invested time and money planting RRA in good\nfaith reliance on APHIS’s deregulation order. And small\namounts of harvesting could be more easily monitored.\nRather than force the farmers to tear up their crops, the\n6        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ncourt imposed a variety of conditions on the crops’ han\ndling and distribution. Id., at 77a.\n   As to all other RRA, however, the court sided with the\nplaintiffs and enjoined planting during the pendency of\nthe EIS. Balancing the equities, the court explained that\nthe risk of harm was great. “[C]ontamination cannot be\nundone; it will destroy the crops of those farmers who do\nnot sell genetically modified alfalfa.” Id., at 71a. And\nbecause those crops “cannot be replanted for two to four\nyears,” that loss will be even greater. Ibid. On the other\nside of the balance, the court recognized that some farmers\nmay wish to switch to genetically modified alfalfa immedi\nately, and some companies like Monsanto want to start\nselling it to them just as fast. But, the court noted, RRA is\na small percentage of those companies’ overall business;\nunsold seed can be stored; and the companies “ ‘have [no]\ncause to claim surprise’ ” as to any loss of anticipated\nrevenue, as they “were aware of plaintiffs’ lawsuit” and\n“nonetheless chose to market” RRA. Id., at 72a.\n   Thus, the District Court stated that it would “vacat[e]\nthe June 2005 deregulation decision”; “enjoi[n] the plant\ning of [RRA] in the United States after March 30, 2007,”\nthe date of the decision, “pending the government’s com\npletion of the EIS and decision on the deregulation peti\ntion”; and impose “conditions on the handling and identifi\ncation of already-planted [RRA].” Id., at 79a. On the\nsame day, the court issued its judgment. In relevant part,\nthe judgment states:\n    “The federal defendants’ June 14, 2005 Determination\n    of Nonregulated Status for [RRA] is VACATED. Be\n    fore granting Monsanto’s deregulation petition, even\n    in part, the federal defendants shall prepare an [EIS].\n    Until the federal defendants prepare the EIS and de\n    cide the deregulation petition, no [RRA] may be\n    planted. . . .

The Court today rests\nnot only the bulk of its analysis but also the primary basis\nfor our jurisdiction on the premise that the District Court\nenjoined APHIS from partially deregulating RRA in any\nsense. See ante, at 9–11, 16–23.1 That is a permissible,\nbut not necessarily correct, reading of the District Court’s\njudgment.\n  So far as I can tell, until petitioners’ reply brief, neither\npetitioners nor the Government submitted to us that the\nDistrict Court had exceeded its authority in this manner.\nAnd, indeed, the Government had not raised this issue in\nany court at all. Petitioners did not raise the issue in any\nof their three questions presented or in the body of their\npetition for a writ or certiorari. And they did not raise the\nissue in their opening briefs to this Court. Only after\nrespondents alleged that Monsanto’s injury would not be\nredressed by vacating the injunction, insofar as RRA\nwould still be a regulated article, did petitioners bring the\nissue to the Court’s attention. Explaining why they have a\nredressable injury, petitioners alleged that the District\nCourt’s order prevents APHIS from “implement[ing] an[y]\n——————\n   1 See also ante, at 19–20 (“[T]he District Court barred the agency\n\nfrom pursuing any deregulation—no matter how limited the geographic\narea in which planting of RRA would be allowed, how great the isola\ntion distances mandated between RRA fields and fields for growing\nnon-genetically-engineered alfalfa, how stringent the regulations\ngoverning harvesting and distribution, how robust the enforcement\nmechanisms available at the time of the decision, and—consequently—\nno matter how small the risk that the planting authorized under such\nconditions would adversely affect the environment in general and\nrespondents in particular” (emphasis deleted)).\n8         MONSANTO CO. v.

APHIS, the party that the Court says\nwas wrongly “barred . . . from pursuing any deregulation,”\neven “in accordance with the procedures established by\nlaw,” ante, at 19, did not complain about this aspect of the\nDistrict Court’s order even in its reply brief.\n  Thus, notwithstanding that petitioners “adequately\npreserved their objection that the vacated deregulation\ndecision should have been replaced by APHIS’s proposed\ninjunction,” ante, at 8 (emphasis added), the key legal\npremise on which the Court decides this case was never\nadequately presented. Of course, this is not standard—or\nsound—judicial practice. See Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmi\nchael, 526 U. S. 137, 159 (1999) (STEVENS, J., concurring\nin part and dissenting in part). Today’s decision illus\ntrates why, for it is quite unclear whether the Court’s\npremise is correct, and the Court has put itself in the\nposition of deciding legal issues without the aid of briefing.\n  In my view, the District Court’s judgment can fairly be\nread to address only (1) total deregulation orders of the\nkind that spawned this lawsuit, and (2) the particular\npartial deregulation order proposed to the court by APHIS.\nThis interpretation of the judgment is more consistent\nwith the District Court’s accompanying opinion, which\nconcluded by stating that the court “will enter a final\njudgment” “ordering the government to prepare an EIS\nbefore [the court] makes a decision on Monsanto’s deregu\nlation petition.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 79a. The language\nof that opinion does not appear to “ba[r] the agency from\npursuing any deregulation—no matter how limited,” ante,\nat 19 (emphasis deleted). This interpretation is also more\nconsistent with APHIS’s own decision not to contest what,\naccording to the Court, was an unprecedented infringe\nment on the agency’s statutory authority.\n  To be sure, the District Court’s judgment is somewhat\nopaque. But it is troubling that we may be asserting\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

In such a case, a court’s func\ntion is “to do equity and to mould each decree to the neces\nsities of the particular case.” Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321\nU. S. 321, 329 (1944). “Flexibility” and “practicality” are\nthe touchtones of these remedial determinations, as “the\npublic interest,” “private needs,” and “competing private\nclaims” must all be weighed and reconciled against the\nbackground of the court’s own limitations and its particu\nlar familiarity with the case.

There is an ongoing\n\ndebate about the role of equitable adjustments in administrative law.\nSee, e.g., Levin, Vacation at Sea: Judicial Remedies and Equitable\nDiscretion in Administrative Law, 53 Duke L. J. 291 (2003). The\nparties to this appeal and the majority assume that the District Court’s\nremedy was crafted under its equity powers, and I will do the same.\n  6 One of the many matters not briefed in this case is how limited a\n\npartial deregulation can be. It is not clear whether the sort of ex\ntremely limited “partial deregulations” envisioned by the Court, see\nante, at 19–23, in which RRA is “deregulated” in one small geographic\narea pursuant to stringent restrictions, could be achieved only through\n“partial deregulation” actions, or whether they could also (or exclu\nsively) be achieved through a more case-specific permit process. Under\nthe applicable regulations, a regulated article may still be used subject\nto a permitting process. See 7 CFR §§340.0, 340.4 (2010). These\npermits “prescribe confinement conditions and standard operating\nprocedures . . . to maintain confinement of the genetically engineered\norganism.” Introduction of Organisms and Products Altered or Pro\nduced Through Genetic Engineering, 72 Fed. Reg. 39021, 39022 (2007)\n(hereinafter Introduction).\n  Ordinarily, “[o]nce an article has been deregulated, APHIS does not\nplace any restrictions or requirements on its use.” Id., at 39023.

See generally D. Mandelker,\nNEPA Law and Litigation §§8:33–8:48 (2d ed. 2009) (de\nscribing when an EIS is required); cf. Marsh v. Oregon\nNatural Resources Council, 490 U. S. 360, 371 (1989)\n(NEPA embodies “sweeping commitment” to environ\nmental safety and principle that “the agency will not act\non incomplete information, only to regret its decision after\nit is too late to correct”). Indeed, it appears that any de\nregulation of a genetically modified, herbicide-resistant\ncrop that can transfer its genes to other organisms and\ncannot effectively be monitored easily fits the criteria for\nwhen an EIS is required.7 That is especially so when, as\nin this case, the environmental threat is novel. See Winter\nv. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U. S. ___,\n___ (2008) (slip op., at 13) (EIS is more important when\nparty “is conducting a new type of activity with completely\nunknown effects on the environment”).8\n——————\npetition for nonregulated status. USDA, Introduction of Genetically\nEngineered Organisms, Draft Environmental Impact Statement, July\n2007, p. 11, online at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/brs/pdf/complete_\neis.pdf (as visited June 18, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court’s\ncase file). In 2007, APHIS began contemplating a “new system” to\nallow for the release and use of genetically modified organisms, for\n“special cases” in which there are risks “that could be mitigated with\nconditions to ensure safe commercial use.” Introduction 39024 (em\nphasis added).\n   7 See, e.g., 40 CFR §1508.8 (2009) (determination whether an EIS is\n\nrequired turns on both “[d]irect effects” and “[i]ndirect effects,” and\n“include[s] those resulting from actions which may have both beneficial\nand detrimental effects even if on balance the agency believes that the\neffect will be beneficial”); §1508.27(b)(4) (determination whether an EIS\nis required turns on “[t]he degree to which the effects on the quality of\nthe human environment are likely to be highly controversial”);\n§1508.27(b)(5) (determination whether an EIS is required turns on\n“[t]he degree to which the possible effects on the quality of the human\nenvironment are highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown\nrisks”).\n   8 The Court posits a hypothetical in which APHIS deregulates RRA\n\nlimited to a remote area in which alfalfa is not grown, and issues an\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Courts con\nfronted with NEPA violations regularly adopt interim\nmeasures to maintain the status quo, particularly if allow\ning agency action to go forward risks foreclosing alterna\ntive courses of action that the agency might have adopted\nfollowing completion of an EIS. See D. Mandelker, NEPA\nLaw and Litigation §4:61. The applicable regulations, to\nwhich the District Court owed deference,9 provide that\nduring the preparation of an EIS, “no action concerning\nthe [agency’s] proposal shall be taken which would . . .\n[h]ave an adverse environmental impact” or “[l]imit the\nchoice of reasonable alternatives.” 40 CFR §1506.1(a)\n(2009). As exemplified by the problem of what to do with\nfarmers who had already purchased or planted RRA prior\nto the District Court’s judgment, even minimal deregula\ntion can limit future regulatory options. “Courts must\nremember that in many cases allowing an agency to pro\nceed makes a mockery of the EIS process, converting it\n——————\naccompanying order “mandating isolation distances so great as to\neliminate any appreciable risk of gene flow to the crops of conventional\nfarmers who might someday choose to plant in the surrounding area.”\nAnte, at 21. At the outset, it is important to note the difference be\ntween a plausible hypothetical and a piece of fiction. At least as of\n2007, APHIS had never granted partial approval of a petition for\nnonregulated status. See n. 6, supra. And I doubt that it would choose\nto deregulate genetically modified alfalfa in a place where the growing\nconditions and sales networks for the product are so poor that no\nfarmer already plants it. Moreover, the notion that this imagined\nderegulation would pose virtually no environmental risk ignores one of\nthe District Court’s critical findings of fact: APHIS has very limited\ncapacity to monitor its own restrictions. The agency could place all\nmanner of constraints on its deregulation orders; they will have no\neffect unless they are enforced.\n   9 See Marsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Council, 490 U. S. 360, 372\n\n(1989).\n14         MONSANTO CO. v.

Rev. 1263, 1289 (1992); see also see 40 CFR §1502.5\n(EIS should be implemented in manner assuring it “will\nnot be used to rationalize or justify decisions already\nmade”).\n   Although the majority does not dispute that the District\nCourt could have reasonably concluded that NEPA re\nquires an EIS for even partial deregulation of RRA, it\nsuggests that any such conclusion would have been in\ncompatible with the court’s decision to permit limited\nharvesting by farmers who had already planted RRA. See\nante, at 20.10 I do not see the “inconsisten[cy].” Ibid.\nNEPA does not apply to actions by federal courts. See 40\nCFR §1508.12. Exercising its equitable discretion to\nbalance the interests of the parties and the public, the\nDistrict Court would have been well within its rights to\nfind that NEPA requires an EIS before the agency grants\n“Monsanto’s deregulation petition, even in part,” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 108a, yet also to find that a partial stay of\nthe vacatur was appropriate to protect the interests of\nthose farmers who had already acted in good-faith reliance\non APHIS.\n   Similarly, I do not agree that the District Court’s ruling\nwas “premature” because APHIS had not yet effected any\npartial deregulations, ante, at 19. Although it is “for the\nagency to decide whether and to what extent” it will pur\nsue deregulation, ante, at 17, the court’s application of\nNEPA to APHIS’s regulation of RRA might have con\ntrolled any deregulation during the pendency of the EIS.\nPetitioners and APHIS had already come back to the court\n——————\n  10 The Court states that the order permitted both harvesting and\n\nplanting. But the court’s final judgment permitted only sale and\nharvesting of RRA planted before March 30, 2007, more than a month\nbefore the judgment.

That same concern\nwould apply to any partial deregulation order. The court\ntherefore had good reason to make it clear, upfront, that\nthe parties should not continue to expend resources pro\nposing such orders, instead of just moving ahead with an\nEIS. Cf. Railroad Comm’n of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312\nU. S. 496, 500 (1941) (“The resources of equity are equal to\nan adjustment that will avoid the waste of a tentative\ndecision”). Indeed, it was APHIS itself that “sought to\n‘streamline’ ” the process. Ante, at 18.\nInjunctive Relief\n   Second, the District Court’s judgment can be understood\nas a reasonable response to the nature of the risks posed\nby RRA. Separate and apart from NEPA’s requirement of\nan EIS, these risks were sufficiently serious, in my view,\nthat the court’s injunction was a permissible exercise of its\nequitable authority.\n   The District Court found that gene transfer can and\ndoes occur, and that if it were to spread through open land\nthe environmental and economic consequences would be\ndevastating. Cf. Amoco Production Co. v. Gambell, 480\nU. S. 531, 545 (1987) (“Environmental injury, by its na\nture, can seldom be adequately remedied by money dam\nages and is often permanent or at least of long duration,\ni.e., irreparable”). Although “a mere possibility of a future\nnuisance will not support an injunction,” courts have\nnever required proof “that the nuisance will occur”; rather,\n“it is sufficient . . . that the risk of its happening is greater\nthan a reasonable man would incur.” 5 J. Pomeroy, A\nTreatise on Equity Jurisprudence and Equitable Reme\ndies, §1937 (§523), p. 4398 (2d ed. 1919). Once gene trans\nfer occurred in American fields, it “would be difficult—if\n16          MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nnot impossible—to reverse the harm.” Hollingsworth v.\nPerry, 558 U. S. __, __ (2010) (per curiam) (slip op., at 12).\n   Additional considerations support the District Court’s\njudgment. It was clear to the court that APHIS had only\nlimited capacity to monitor planted RRA, and some RRA\nhad already been planted. The marginal threat posed by\nadditional planting was therefore significant. Injunctive\nremedies are meant to achieve a “nice adjustment and\nreconciliation between the competing claims” of injury by\n“mould[ing] each decree to the necessities of the case.”\nWeinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S. 305, 312 (1982)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Under these circum\nstances, it was not unreasonable for the court to conclude\nthat the most equitable solution was to allocate the lim\nited amount of potentially safe RRA to the farmers who\nhad already planted that crop.11\n   The Court suggests that the injunction was nonetheless\ntoo sweeping because “a partial deregulation need not\ncause respondents any injury at all . . . if the scope of the\npartial deregulation is sufficiently limited, the risk of gene\nflow to their crops could be virtually nonexistent.” Ante, at\n21. The Court appears to reach this conclusion by citing\none particular study (in a voluminous record), rather than\nany findings of fact.12 Even assuming that this study is\n——————\n  11 As explained previously, I do not see the court’s broad injunction as\n\n“inconsistent,” ante, at 20, with its decision that farmers who had\nalready planted RRA could harvest their crop. The equities are differ\nent for farmers who relied on the agency than for companies like\nMonstanto that developed an organism knowing it might be regulated;\nand APHIS could monitor only a limited amount of RRA.\n  12 The Court also hypothesizes a set of growing conditions that would\n\nisolate RRA from the plaintiffs in this case, even if not from other\nfarmers. See ante, at 21–22. As already explained, these hypotheticals\nare rather unrealistic. See n. 8, supra. And, given that the plaintiffs\ninclude environmental organizations as well as farmer and consumer\nassociations, it is hard to see how APHIS could so carefully isolate and\nprotect their interests. In any event, because APHIS concedes that it\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   17\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ncorrect, the Court ignores the District Court’s findings\nthat gene flow is likely and that APHIS has little ability to\nmonitor any conditions imposed on a partial deregulation.\nLimits on planting or harvesting may operate fine in a\nlaboratory setting, but the District Court concluded that\nmany limits will not be followed and cannot be enforced in\nthe real world.13\n  Against that background, it was perfectly reasonable to\nwait for an EIS. APHIS and petitioners argued to the\nDistrict Court that partial deregulation could be safely\nimplemented, they submitted evidence intended to show\nthat planting restrictions would prevent the spread of the\nnewly engineered gene, and they contested “virtually\nevery factual issue relating to possible environmental\nharm.” Geertson Seed Farms v. Johanns, 570 F. 3d 1130,\n1135 (CA9 2009). But lacking “the benefit of the develop\nment of all the relevant data,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a,\nthe District Court did not find APHIS’s and petitioners’\nassertions to be convincing. I cannot say that I would\nhave found otherwise. It was reasonable for the court to\nconclude that planting could not go forward until more\n——————\ncannot monitor such limits, rules that protect these or any other parties\nmay be merely hortatory in practice. Moreover, although we have not\nsquarely addressed the issue, in my view “[t]here is no general re\nquirement that an injunction affect only the parties in the suit.”\nBresgal v. Brock, 843 F. 2d 1163, 1169 (CA9 1987). To limit an injunc\ntion against a federal agency to the named plaintiffs “would only\nencourage numerous other” regulated entities “to file additional law\nsuits in this and other federal jurisdictions.” Livestock Marketing Assn.\nv. United States Dept. of Agriculture, 207 F. Supp. 2d 992, 1007 (SD\n2002), aff’d, 335 F. 3d 711, 726 (CA8 2003).\n   13 The majority notes that the District Court acknowledged, at a hear\n\ning several months before it issued the judgment, that a simple but\nslightly overinclusive remedy may be preferable to an elaborate set of\nplanting conditions. See ante, at 22, n. 6. Quite right. As the District\nCourt said to APHIS’s lawyer at that hearing, if the agency issues an\nelaborate set of precautions, “I don’t know how you even start to enforce\nit.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 190a–191a.\n18         MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ncomplete study, presented in an EIS, showed that\nthe known problem of gene flow could, in reality, be\nprevented.14\n   The District Court’s decision that more study was\nneeded to assess whether limits on deregulation could\nprevent environmental damage is further reinforced by\nthe statutory context in which the issue arose. A court’s\nequitable discretion must be guided by “recognized, de\nfined public policy.” Meredith v. Winter Haven, 320 U. S.\n228, 235 (1943); see also Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U. S.\n321, 331 (1944) (explaining that when a court evaluates an\nagency’s decision against the background of a federal\nstatute, the court’s discretion “must be exercised in light of\nthe large objectives of the Act”). Congress recognized in\nNEPA that complex environmental cases often require\nexceptionally sophisticated scientific determinations, and\nthat agency decisions should not be made on the basis of\n“incomplete information.” Marsh v. Oregon Natural Re\nsources Council, 490 U. S. 360, 371 (1989). Congress also\nrecognized that agencies cannot fully weigh the conse\nquences of these decisions without obtaining public com\nments through an EIS. See Robertson v. Methow Valley\nCitizens Council, 490 U. S. 332, 350 (1989).15 While a\ncourt may not presume that a NEPA violation requires an\ninjunction, it may take into account the principles embod\n——————\n   14 I suspect that if APHIS and petitioners had come back to the court\n\nwith more convincing evidence prior to completing an EIS, and moved\nto modify the court’s order, the court would have done so. Indeed, the\nDistrict Court showed a willingness to recalibrate its order when it\namended its judgment just a few months after the judgment’s issuance\nin light of APHIS’s submission that certain requirements were imprac\ntical. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a–114a.\n   15 Accordingly, while “NEPA itself does not mandate particular re\n\nsults,” it does mandate a particular process and embodies the principle\nthat federal agencies should “carefully conside[r] detailed information”\nbefore incurring potential environmental harm.

This District Court had before it\nstrong evidence that gene transmission was likely to occur\nand that limits on growing could not be enforced. It also\nhad a large amount of highly detailed evidence about\nwhether growing restrictions, even if enforced, can prevent\ntransmission. That evidence called into question the\nagency’s own claims regarding the risks posed by partial\nderegulation. In enjoining partial deregulation until it\nhad the benefit of an EIS to help parse the evidence, the\ncourt acted with exactly the sort of caution that Congress\nendorsed in NEPA.\n   Finally, it bears mention that the District Court’s ex\nperience with the case may have given it grounds for\nskepticism about the representations made by APHIS and\npetitioners. Sometimes “one judicial actor is better posi\ntioned than another to decide the issue in question.”\nMiller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 114 (1985). A “district\ncourt may have insights not conveyed by the record.”\nPierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 560 (1988). In this\ncase, the agency had attempted to deregulate RRA without\nan EIS in spite of ample evidence of potential environ\nmental harms. And when the court made clear that the\nagency had violated NEPA, the agency responded by\nseeking to “ ‘streamline’ ” the process, ante, at 18, submit\nting a deregulation proposal with Monsanto that suffered\nfrom some of the same legal and empirical holes as its\ninitial plan to deregulate. Against that background, the\ncourt may have felt it especially prudent to wait for an EIS\nbefore concluding that APHIS could manage RRA’s threat\nto the environment.\n                       *    *     *\n  The District Court in this case was put in an “unenvi\nable position.” Ibid.
