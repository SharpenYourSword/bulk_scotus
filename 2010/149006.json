Argued March 24, 2010—Decided June 21, 2010*\nRespondents (cargo owners) delivered to petitioners in No. 08–1553\n  (“K” Line) goods for shipping from China to inland United States des\n  tinations. “K” Line issued them four through bills of lading, i.e., bills\n  of lading covering both the ocean and inland portions of transport in\n  a single document. As relevant here, the bills contain a “Himalaya\n  Clause,” which extends the bills’ defenses and liability limitations to\n  subcontractors; permit “K” Line to subcontract to complete the jour\n  ney; provide that the entire journey is governed by the Carriage of\n  Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), which regulates bills of lading issued by\n  ocean carriers engaged in foreign trade; and designate a Tokyo court\n  as the venue for any dispute. “K” Line arranged the journey, subcon\n  tracting with petitioner in No. 08–1554 (Union Pacific) for rail ship\n  ment in the United States. The cargo was shipped in “K” Line ves\n  sels to California and then loaded onto a Union Pacific train. A\n  derailment along the inland route allegedly destroyed the cargo. Ul\n  timately, the Federal District Court granted the motion of Union Pa\n  cific and “K” Line to dismiss the cargo owners’ suits against them\n  based on the parties’ Tokyo forum-selection clause. The Ninth Cir\n  cuit reversed, concluding that that clause was trumped by the Car\n  mack Amendment governing bills of lading issued by domestic rail\n  carriers, which applied to the inland portion of the shipment.\nHeld: Because the Carmack Amendment does not apply to a shipment\n originating overseas under a single through bill of lading, the parties’\n\n——————\n  * Together with No. 08–1554, Union Pacific Railroad Co. v.

Pp. 4–21.\n       (a) COGSA, which “K” Line and Union Pacific contend governs\n    these cases, requires a carrier to issue to the cargo owner a bill con\n    taining specified terms. It does not limit the parties’ ability to adopt\n    forum-selection clauses. It only applies to shipments from United\n    States ports to foreign ports and vice versa, but permits parties to ex\n    tend certain of its terms “by contract” to cover “the entire period in\n    which [the goods] would be under [a carrier’s] responsibility, includ\n    ing [a] period of inland . . . transport.” Norfolk Southern R. Co. v.\n    James N. Kirby, Pty Ltd., 543 U. S. 14, 29. The Carmack Amend\n    ment, on which respondents rely, requires a domestic rail carrier that\n    “receives [property] for transportation under this part” to issue a bill\n    of lading. 49 U. S. C. §11706(a). “[T]his part” refers to the Surface\n    Transportation Board’s (STB’s) jurisdiction over domestic rail trans\n    portation. See §10501(b). Carmack assigns liability for damage on\n    the rail route to “receiving rail carrier[s]” and “delivering rail car\n    rier[s],” regardless of which carrier caused the damage. §11706(a).\n    Its purpose is to relieve cargo owners “of the burden of searching out\n    a particular negligent carrier from among the often numerous carri\n    ers handling an interstate shipment of goods.” Reider v. Thompson,\n    339 U. S. 113, 119. Thus, it constrains carriers’ ability to limit liabil\n    ity by contract, §11706(c), and limits the parties’ choice of venue to\n    federal and state courts. §11706(d)(1). Pp. 4–7.\n       (b) In Kirby, as in these cases, an ocean shipping company issued a\n    through bill of lading that extended COGSA’s terms to the inland\n    segment, and the property was damaged during the inland rail por\n    tion. This Court held that the through bill’s terms governed under\n    federal maritime law, notwithstanding contrary state laws, 543 U. S.,\n    at 23–27, explaining that “so long as a bill of lading requires substan\n    tial carriage of goods by sea, its purpose is to effectuate maritime\n    commerce,” id., at 27, and adding that “[a]pplying state law . . . would\n    undermine the uniformity of general maritime law,” id., at 28, and\n    defeat COGSA’s apparent purpose “to facilitate efficient contracting\n    in contracts for carriage by sea,” ibid. Here, as in Kirby, “K” Line is\n    sued through bills under COGSA, in maritime commerce, and ex\n    tended its terms to the journey’s inland domestic segment. Pp. 7–8.\n       (c) The Carmack Amendment’s text, history, and purposes make\n    clear that it does not require a different result. Pp. 8–21.\n          (1) Carmack divides the realm of rail carriers into receiving, de\n    livering, and connecting rail carriers. Its first sentence requires a\n    compliant bill of lading (1) if a rail carrier provid[es] transportation\n    or service subject to the [STB’s] jurisdiction” and (2) if that carrier\n    “receives” the property “for transportation . . . .” 11706(a). It thus\n    requires the receiving rail carrier—but not the delivering or connect\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ning rail carrier—to issue a bill of lading. This conclusion is consistent\nwith statute’s text and this Court’s precedent. See St. Louis, I. M. &\nS. R. Co. v. Starbird, 243 U. S. 592, 595, 604. A receiving rail carrier\nis the initial carrier, which “receives” the property for domestic rail\ntransportation at the journey’s point of origin. If the Carmack’s bill\nof lading requirement referred not to the initial carrier, but to any\ncarrier “receiving” the property from another carrier, then every car\nrier during the shipment would have to issue its own separate bill.\nThis would be contrary to Carmack’s purpose of making the receiving\nand delivering carriers liable under a single, initial bill for damage\ncaused by any carrier within a single course of shipment. This con\nclusion is consistent with Mexican Light & Power Co. v. Texas Mexi\ncan R. Co., 331 U. S. 731, where the Court held that a bill of lading\nissued by a subsequent rail carrier when the “initial carrier” has is\nsued a through bill is “void” unless it “represents the initiation of a\nnew shipment,” id., at 733–734. And Reider, supra, is not to the con\ntrary. There, absent a through bill of lading, the original journey\nfrom Argentina terminated at the port of New Orleans, and the first\nrail carrier in the United States was the receiving rail carrier for\nCarmack purposes. Id., at 117. Carmack’s second sentence estab\nlishes that it applies only to transport of property for which a receiv\ning carrier is required to issue a bill of lading, regardless of whether\nthat carrier actually issues such a bill. See §11706(a). Thus, Car\nmack applies only if the journey begins with a receiving rail carrier\nthat had to issue a compliant bill of lading, not if the property is re\nceived at an overseas location under a through bill that covers trans\nport into an inland location in this country. The initial carrier in that\ninstance receives the property at the shipment’s point of origin for\noverseas multimodal import transport, not domestic rail transport.\nCarmack did not require “K” Line to issue bills of lading because “K”\nLine was not a receiving rail carrier. That it chose to use rail trans\nport to complete one segment of the journey under its “essentially\nmaritime” contracts, Kirby, supra, at 24, does not put it within Car\nmack’s reach. Union Pacific, which the cargo owners concede was a\nmere delivering carrier that did not have to issue its own Carmack\nbill of lading, was also not a receiving rail carrier under Carmack.\nBecause the Ninth Circuit ignored Carmack’s “receive[d] . . . for\ntransportation” limitation, it reached the wrong conclusion. Its con\nclusion is also an awkward fit with Carmack’s venue provisions,\nwhich presume that the receiving carrier obtains the property in a\njudicial district within the United States. If “K” Line were a receiv\ning carrier in a case with a “point of origin” in China, there would be\nno place under Carmack to sue “K” Line, since China is not within a\njudicial district “of the United States or in a State Court.”\n4      KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    §11706(d)(1). Pp. 8–15.\n         (2) Carmack’s statutory history supports this conclusion. None of\n    its legislative versions—the original 1906 statute or the amended\n    1915, 1978, or 1995 ones—have applied to the inland domestic rail\n    segment of an import shipment from overseas under a through bill.\n    Pp. 15–17.\n         (3) This interpretation also attains the most consistency between\n    Carmack and COGSA. Applying Carmack to the inland segment of\n    an international carriage originating overseas under a through bill\n    would undermine Carmack’s purposes, which are premised on the\n    view that a shipment has a single bill of lading and any damage is\n    the responsibility of both receiving and delivering carriers. Under\n    the Ninth Circuit’s interpretation, there might be no venue in which\n    to sue the receiving carrier. That interpretation would also under\n    mine COGSA and international, container-based multimodal trans\n    port: COGSA’s liability and venue rules would apply when cargo is\n    damaged at sea and Carmack’s rules almost always would apply\n    when the damage occurs on land. Moreover, applying Carmack to in\n    ternational import shipping transport would undermine COGSA’s\n    purpose “to facilitate efficient contracting in contracts for carriage by\n    sea.” Kirby, supra, at 29. The cargo owners’ contrary policy argu\n    ments are unavailing. Pp. 17–20.\n557 F. 3d 985, reversed and remanded.\n\n   KENNEDY, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

The voyage here in\ncluded ocean transit followed by transfer to a rail carrier\nin this country. The Court addressed similar factual\ncircumstances in Norfolk Southern R. Co. v. James N.\nKirby, Pty Ltd., 543 U. S. 14 (2004). In that case the\nterms of a through bill were controlled by federal maritime\nlaw and by a federal statute known as the Carriage of\nGoods by Sea Act (COGSA), note following 46 U. S. C.\n§30701. Kirby held that bill of lading provisions permissi\nble under COGSA can be invoked by a domestic rail car\nrier, despite contrary state law.\n2   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  The instant cases present a question neither raised nor\naddressed in Kirby. It is whether the terms of a through\nbill of lading issued abroad by an ocean carrier can apply\nto the domestic part of the import’s journey by a rail car\nrier, despite prohibitions or limitations in another federal\nstatute. That statute is known as the Carmack Amend\nment and it governs the terms of bills of lading issued by\ndomestic rail carriers. 49 U. S. C. §11706(a).\n                              I\n   Respondents Regal-Beloit Corporation, Victory Fire\nworks, Inc., PICC Property & Casualty Company Ltd., and\nRoyal & Sun Alliance Insurance Company Ltd. are cargo\nowners or insurance firms that paid losses to cargo owners\nand succeeded to their rights, all referred to as “cargo\nowners.” To ship their goods from China to inland desti\nnations in the Midwestern United States, the cargo own\ners delivered the goods in China to petitioners in No. 08–\n1553, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Ltd., and its agent “K” Line\nAmerica, Inc., both referred to as “K” Line. All agree the\nrelevant contract terms governing the shipment are con\ntained in four through bills of lading “K” Line issued to the\ncargo owners. The bills of lading covered the entire course\nof shipment.\n   The bills required “K” Line to arrange delivery of the\ngoods from China to their final destinations in the United\nStates, by any mode of transportation of “K” Line’s choos\ning. A bill of lading “records that a carrier has received\ngoods from the party that wishes to ship them, states the\nterms of carriage, and serves as evidence of the contract\nfor carriage.” Kirby, 543 U. S., at 18–19. A through bill\nof lading covers both the ocean and inland portions of the\ntransport in a single document. Id., at 25–26.\n   “K” Line’s through bills contain five relevant provisions.\nFirst, they include a so-called “Himalaya Clause,” which\nextends the bills’ defenses and limitations on liability to\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nparties that sign subcontracts to perform services contem\nplated by the bills. See id., at 20, and n. 2. Second, the\nbills permit “K” Line “to sub-contract on any terms what\nsoever” for the completion of the journey. App. 145.\nThird, the bills provide that COGSA’s terms govern the\nentire journey. Fourth, the bills require that any dispute\nwill be governed by Japanese law. Fifth, the bills state\nthat any action relating to the carriage must be brought in\n“Tokyo District Court in Japan.” Id., at 144. The forum\nselection provision in the last clause gives rise to the\ndispute here.\n  “K” Line, pursuant to the bills of lading, arranged for\nthe entire journey. It subcontracted with petitioner in No.\n08–1554, Union Pacific Railroad Company, for rail ship\nment in the United States. The goods were to be shipped\nin a “K” Line vessel to a port in Long Beach, California,\nand then transferred to Union Pacific for rail carriage to\nthe final destinations.\n  In March and April 2005, the cargo owners brought four\ndifferent container shipments to “K” Line vessels in Chi\nnese ports. All parties seem to assume that “K” Line\nsafely transported the cargo across the Pacific Ocean to\nCalifornia. The containers were then loaded onto a Union\nPacific train and that train, or some other train operated\nby Union Pacific, derailed in Tyrone, Oklahoma, allegedly\ndestroying the cargo.\n  The cargo owners filed four separate lawsuits in the\nSuperior Court of California, County of Los Angeles. The\nsuit named “K” Line and Union Pacific as defendants.\nUnion Pacific removed the suits to the United States\nDistrict Court for the Central District of California. Union\nPacific and “K” Line then moved to dismiss based on the\nparties’ Tokyo forum-selection clause. The District Court\ngranted the motion to dismiss. It decided that the forum\nselection clause was reasonable and applied to Union\nPacific pursuant to the Himalaya Clause in “K” Line’s bills\n4   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v.

The\ncourt concluded that the Carmack Amendment applied to\nthe inland portion of an international shipment under a\nthrough bill of lading and thus trumped the parties’ fo\nrum-selection clause. Id., at 994–995. The court noted\nthat this view was consistent with the position taken by\nthe Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, see id., at 994\n(citing Sompo Japan Ins. Co. of Am. v. Union Pacific R.\nCo., 456 F. 3d 54 (2006)), but inconsistent with the views\nof the Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, Sixth, Seventh,\nand Eleventh Circuits, see 557 F. 3d, at 994 (citing Shao v.\nLink Cargo (Taiwan) Ltd., 986 F. 2d 700 (CA4 1993);\nAmerican Road Serv.

This Court granted certio\nrari to address whether Carmack applies to the inland\nsegment of an overseas import shipment under a through\nbill of lading. 558 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n  Before turning to Carmack, a brief description of\nCOGSA is in order; for “K” Line’s and Union Pacific’s\nprimary contention is that COGSA, not Carmack, controls.\nCOGSA governs the terms of bills of lading issued by\nocean carriers engaged in foreign trade. 49 Stat. 1207, as\namended, note following 46 U. S. C. §30701, p. 1178. It\nrequires each carrier to issue to the cargo owner a bill that\ncontains certain terms. §3(3)–(8), at 1178–1179. Although\nCOGSA imposes some limitations on the parties’ authority\nto adjust liability, it does not limit the parties’ ability to\nadopt forum-selection clauses. See Vimar Seguros y\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)              5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nReaseguros, S. A. v. M/V Sky Reefer, 515 U. S. 528, 537–\n539 (1995). By its terms, COGSA only applies to ship\nments from United States ports to ports of foreign coun\ntries and vice versa. §§1(e), 13, at 1178, 1180. The stat\nute, however, allows parties “the option of extending\n[certain COGSA terms] by contract” to cover “the entire\nperiod in which [the goods] would be under [a carrier’s]\nresponsibility, including [a] period of . . . inland transport.”\nKirby, 543 U. S., at 29 (citing COGSA §7, at 1180). Ocean\ncarriers, who often must issue COGSA bills of lading, are\nregulated by the Federal Maritime Commission (Maritime\nCommission), which is responsible for oversight over\n“common carriage of goods by water in . . . foreign com\nmerce.” 46 U. S. C. §40101(1).\n                              B\n  The next statute to consider is the Carmack Amend\nment, §7, 34 Stat. 595, which governs the terms of bills of\nlading issued by domestic rail carriers. Carmack was first\nenacted in 1906 as an amendment to the Interstate Com\nmerce Act, 24 Stat. 379. The Carmack Amendment has\nbeen altered and recodified over the last century. It now\nprovides, in relevant part, as follows:\n    “(a) A rail carrier providing transportation or service\n    subject to the jurisdiction of the [Surface Transporta\n    tion Board (STB)] under this part shall issue a receipt\n    or bill of lading for property it receives for transporta\n    tion under this part. That rail carrier and any other\n    carrier that delivers the property and is providing\n    transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of\n    the [STB] under this part are liable to the person enti\n    tled to recover under the receipt or bill of lading. The\n    liability imposed under this subsection is for the ac\n    tual loss or injury to the property caused by—\n       “(1) the receiving rail carrier;\n6   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n      “(2) the delivering rail carrier; or\n      “(3) another rail carrier over whose line or route\n      the property is transported in the United States or\n      from a place in the United States to a place in an\n      adjacent foreign country when transported under a\n      through bill of lading.\n    “Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not af\n    fect the liability of a rail carrier.” 49 U. S. C. §11706;\n    see also §14706(a) (motor carriers).\n   The Carmack Amendment thus requires a rail carrier\nthat “receives [property] for transportation under this\npart” to issue a bill of lading. §11706(a). The provision\n“this part” refers to is the STB’s jurisdiction over rail\ntransportation within the United States. See §10501\n(2006 ed. and Supp. II). The STB is the successor to the\nInterstate Commerce Commission (ICC). The STB has\n“exclusive” jurisdiction to regulate “transportation by rail\ncarriers” between places in the United States as well as\nbetween a place “in the United States and a place in a\nforeign country.” §10501(a)(2)(F), (b) (2006 ed.). Regu\nlated rail carriers must provide transportation subject to\nSTB rail carrier jurisdiction “on reasonable request,”\n§11101(a), at reasonable rates,         §§10702, 10707(b),\n11101(a), (e).\n   In cases where it applies, Carmack imposes upon “re\nceiving rail carrier[s]” and “delivering rail carrier[s]”\nliability for damage caused during the rail route under the\nbill of lading, regardless of which carrier caused the dam\nage. §11706(a). Carmack’s purpose is to relieve cargo\nowners “of the burden of searching out a particular negli\ngent carrier from among the often numerous carriers\nhandling an interstate shipment of goods.” Reider v.\nThompson, 339 U. S. 113, 119 (1950). To help achieve this\ngoal, Carmack constrains carriers’ ability to limit liability\nby contract. §11706(c).\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Carmack also limits the parties’ ability to choose the\nvenue of their suit:\n    “(d)(1) A civil action under this section may be\n    brought in a district court of the United States or in a\n    State court.\n    “(2)(A) A civil action under this section may only be\n    brought—\n      “(i) against the originating rail carrier, in the judi\n      cial district in which the point of origin is located;\n      “(ii) against the delivering rail carrier, in the judi\n      cial district in which the principal place of business\n      of the person bringing the action is located if the de\n      livering carrier operates a railroad or a route\n      through such judicial district, or in the judicial dis\n      trict in which the point of destination is located; and\n      “(iii) against the carrier alleged to have caused the\n      loss or damage, in the judicial district in which such\n      loss or damage is alleged to have occurred.” §11706.\nFor purposes of these cases, it can be assumed that if\nCarmack’s terms apply to the bills of lading here, the\ncargo owners would have a substantial argument that the\nTokyo forum-selection clause in the bills is pre-empted by\nCarmack’s venue provisions. The parties argue about\nwhether they may contract out of Carmack’s venue provi\nsions and other requirements, see §§10502, 10709; but in\nlight of the disposition and ruling to follow, those matters\nneed not be discussed or further explored.\n                             III\n  In Kirby, an ocean shipping company issued a through\nbill of lading, agreeing to deliver cargo from Australia to\nAlabama. Like the through bills in the present cases, the\nKirby bill extended COGSA’s terms to the inland segment\nunder a Himalaya Clause. There, as here, the property\n8   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwas damaged by a domestic rail carrier during the inland\nrail portion. 543 U. S., at 19–20.\n  Kirby held that the through bill’s terms governed under\nfederal maritime law, notwithstanding contrary state\nlaws. Id., at 23–27. Kirby explained that “so long as a bill\nof lading requires substantial carriage of goods by sea, its\npurpose is to effectuate maritime commerce.” Id., at 27.\nThe Court added that “[a]pplying state law to cases like\nthis one would undermine the uniformity of general mari\ntime law.” Id., at 28. “Confusion and inefficiency will\ninevitably result if more than one body of law governs a\ngiven contract’s meaning.” Id., at 29. The Court noted\nthat its conclusion “reinforce[d] the liability regime Con\ngress established in COGSA,” and explained that COGSA\nallows parties to extend its terms to an inland portion of a\njourney under a through bill of lading. Ibid. Finally, the\nCourt concluded that a contrary holding would defeat “the\napparent purpose of COGSA, to facilitate efficient con\ntracting in contracts for carriage by sea.” Ibid.\n  Much of what the Court said in Kirby applies to the\npresent cases. “K” Line issued the through bills under\nCOGSA, in maritime commerce. Congress considered\nsuch international through bills and decided to permit\nparties to extend COGSA’s terms to the inland domestic\nsegment of the journey. The cargo owners and “K” Line\ndid exactly that in these cases, agreeing in the through\nbills to require that any suit be brought in Tokyo.\n                            IV\n  The cargo owners argue that the Carmack Amendment,\nwhich has its own venue provisions and was not discussed\nin Kirby, requires a different result. In particular they\nargue that Carmack applies to the domestic inland seg\nment of the carriage here, so the Tokyo forum-selection\nclause is inapplicable. For the reasons set forth below,\nthis contention must be rejected. Instructed by the text,\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhistory, and purposes of Carmack, the Court now holds\nthat the amendment does not apply to a shipment origi\nnating overseas under a single through bill of lading. As\nin Kirby, the terms of the bill govern the parties’ rights.\n                               A\n   The text of the statute charts the analytic course. Car\nmack divides the realm of rail carriers into three parts:\n(1) receiving rail carriers; (2) delivering rail carriers; and\n(3) connecting rail carriers. A “receiving rail carrier” is\none that “provid[es] transportation or service . . . for prop\nerty it receives for transportation under this part.”\n§11706(a); see §11706(a)(1). The provision “this part”\nrefers to is the STB’s jurisdiction over rail transportation\nwithin the United States. See §10501. A “delivering rail\ncarrier” “delivers the property and is providing transporta\ntion or service subject to the jurisdiction of the [STB]\nunder this part.” §11706(a); see §11706(a)(2). A connect\ning rail carrier is “another rail carrier over whose line or\nroute the property is transported in the United States or\nfrom a place in the United States to a place in an adjacent\nforeign country when transported under a through bill of\nlading.” §11706(a)(3).\n   A rail carrier’s obligation to issue a Carmack-compliant\nbill of lading is determined by Carmack’s first sentence:\n    “A rail carrier providing transportation or service sub\n    ject to the jurisdiction of the [STB] under this part\n    shall issue a receipt or bill of lading for property it re\n    ceives for transportation under this part.” §11706(a).\nThis critical first sentence requires a Carmack-compliant\nbill of lading if two conditions are satisfied. First, the rail\ncarrier must “provid[e] transportation or service subject to\nthe jurisdiction of the [STB].” Second, that carrier must\n“receiv[e]” the property “for transportation under this\npart,” where “this part” is the STB’s jurisdiction over\n10   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndomestic rail transport. Carmack thus requires the re\nceiving rail carrier—but not the delivering or connecting\nrail carrier—to issue a bill of lading. As explained below,\nascertaining the shipment’s point of origin is critical to\ndeciding whether the shipment includes a receiving rail\ncarrier.\n   The conclusion that Carmack’s bill of lading require\nment only applies to the receiving rail carrier is dictated\nby the text and is consistent with this Court’s precedent.\nSee St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Starbird, 243 U. S. 592,\n604 (1917) (explaining that Carmack “requires the receiv\ning carrier to issue a through bill of lading”). A receiving\nrail carrier is the initial carrier, which “receives” the\nproperty for domestic rail transportation at the journey’s\npoint of origin. §11706(a). If Carmack’s bill of lading\nrequirement did not refer to the initial carrier, but rather\nto any rail carrier that in the colloquial sense “received”\nthe property from another carrier, then every carrier\nduring the shipment would have to issue its own separate\nbill. This would be altogether contrary to Carmack’s\npurpose of making the receiving and delivering carriers\nliable under a single, initial bill of lading for damage\ncaused by any carrier within a single course of shipment.\n   This Court’s decision in Mexican Light & Power Co. v.\nTexas Mexican R. Co., 331 U. S. 731 (1947), supports the\nconclusion that only the receiving rail carrier must issue a\nCarmack bill of lading. There, a subsequent rail carrier in\nan export shipment from the United States to Mexico\nissued its own separate bill of lading at the U. S.-Mexico\nborder. The second bill differed from the through bill\nissued by the “initial carrier,” id., at 733, (that is, the\nreceiving carrier) at the inland point of origin. The Court\nheld that Carmack, far from requiring nonreceiving carri\ners to issue their separate bills of lading, makes any sub\nsequent bill “void” unless the “so-called second bill of\nlading represents the initiation of a new shipment.” Id., at\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n734.\n  The Court’s decision in Reider v. Thompson, 339 U. S.\n113, is not to the contrary. That case involved goods\noriginating in Argentina, bound for an inland location in\nthe United States. The Court in Reider determined that\nbecause there was no through bill of lading, the original\njourney from Argentina terminated at the port of New\nOrleans. Thus, the first rail carrier in the United States\nwas the receiving rail carrier and had to issue a Carmack\nbill of lading. Id., at 117. And because that carrier had to\nissue a separate bill of lading, it was not liable for damage\ndone during the ocean-based portion of the shipment. Id.,\nat 118–119. Notably, neither Mexican Light nor Reider\naddressed the situation in the present cases, where the\nshipment originates overseas under a through bill of lad\ning. And, for this reason, neither case discussed COGSA.\n  The Carmack Amendment’s second sentence establishes\nwhen Carmack liability applies:\n    “[The receiving rail carrier referred to in the first sen\n    tence] and any other carrier that delivers the property\n    and is providing transportation or service subject to\n    the jurisdiction of the [STB] under this part are liable\n    to the person entitled to recover under the receipt or\n    bill of lading.” §11706(a)\nThus, the receiving and delivering rail carriers are subject\nto liability only when damage is done to this “property,”\nthat is to say, to property for which Carmack’s first sen\ntence requires the receiving rail carrier to issue a bill of\nlading. Ibid. Put another way, Carmack applies only to\ntransport of property for which Carmack requires a receiv\ning carrier to issue a bill of lading, regardless of whether\nthat carrier erroneously fails to issue such a bill. See ibid.\n(“Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not affect\nthe liability of a rail carrier”). The language in some of the\nCourts of Appeals’ decisions, which were rejected by the\n12   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt of Appeals in the opinion now under review, could\nbe read to imply that Carmack applies only if a rail carrier\nactually issued a separate domestic bill of lading. See,\ne.g., Atladis, 458 F. 3d, at 1291–1294; American Road, 348\nF. 3d, at 568; Shao, 986 F. 2d, at 703; Capitol Converting,\n965 F. 2d, at 394. This may have led to some confusion.\nThe decisive question is not whether the rail carrier in fact\nissued a Carmack bill but rather whether that carrier was\nrequired to issue a bill by Carmack’s first sentence.\n   The above principles establish that for Carmack’s provi\nsions to apply the journey must begin with a receiving rail\ncarrier, which would have to issue a Carmack-compliant\nbill of lading. It follows that Carmack does not apply if\nthe property is received at an overseas location under a\nthrough bill that covers the transport into an inland loca\ntion in the United States. In such a case, there is no\nreceiving rail carrier that “receives” the property “for\n[domestic rail] transportation,” §11706(a), and thus no\ncarrier that must issue a Carmack-compliant bill of lading.\nThe initial carrier in that instance receives the property at\nthe shipment’s point of origin for overseas multimodal\nimport transport, not for domestic rail transport. (Today’s\ndecision need not address the instance where goods are\nreceived at a point in the United States for export. Nor is\nit necessary to decide if Carmack applies to goods initially\nreceived in Canada or Mexico, for import into the United\nStates. See infra, at 16.)\n   The present cases illustrate the operation of these prin\nciples. Carmack did not require “K” Line to issue bills of\nlading because “K” Line was not a receiving rail carrier.\n“K” Line obtained the cargo in China for overseas trans\nport across an ocean and then to inland destinations in the\nUnited States. “K” Line shipped this property under\nCOGSA-authorized through bills of lading. See supra, at\n4–5. That “K” Line chose to use rail transport to complete\none segment of the journey under these “essentially mari\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntime” contracts, Kirby, 543 U. S., at 24, does not put “K”\nLine within Carmack’s reach and thus does not require it\nto issue Carmack bills of lading.\n   As for Union Pacific, it was also not a receiving rail\ncarrier under Carmack. The cargo owners conceded at\noral argument that, even under their theory, Union Pacific\nwas a mere delivering carrier, which did not have to issue\nits own Carmack bill of lading. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29, 39.\nThis was a necessary concession. A carrier does not be\ncome a receiving carrier simply by accepting goods for\nfurther transport from another carrier in the middle of an\ninternational shipment under a through bill. After all,\nUnion Pacific was not the “initial carrier” for the carriage.\nMexican Light, 331 U. S., at 733.\n   If a carrier like Union Pacific, which acts as a connect\ning or delivering carrier during an international through\nshipment, was, counterintuitively, a receiving carrier\nunder Carmack, this would in effect outlaw through ship\nments under a single bill of lading. This is because a\ncarriage like the one in the present case would require two\nbills of lading: one that the overseas carrier (here, “K”\nLine) issues to the cargo owners under COGSA, and a\nsecond one that the first domestic rail carrier (here, Union\nPacific) issues to the overseas carrier under Carmack.\nKirby noted “the popularity of ‘through’ bills of lading, in\nwhich cargo owners can contract for transportation across\noceans and to inland destinations in a single transaction.”\n543 U. S., at 25–26. The Court sees no reason to read\nCOGSA and Carmack to outlaw this efficient mode of\ninternational shipping by requiring these journeys to have\nmultiple bills of lading. In addition, if Union Pacific had\nto issue a Carmack bill of lading to “K” Line, it is unclear\nwhether the cargo owners (the parties Carmack is de\nsigned to protect) would be able to sue under the terms\ngoverning that bill, especially in light of their different\nthrough bill with “K” Line. These difficulties are reason\n14   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nenough to reject this novel interpretation of Carmack,\nwhich was neither urged by any party nor adopted by any\nauthority that has been called to this Court’s attention.\n   This would be a quite different case if, as in Reider, the\nbills of lading for the overseas transport ended at this\ncountry’s ports and the cargo owners then contracted with\nUnion Pacific to complete a new journey to an inland\ndestination in the United States. Under those circum\nstances, Union Pacific would have been the receiving rail\ncarrier and would have been required to issue a separate\nCarmack-compliant bill of lading to the cargo owners. See\nReider, 339 U. S., at 117 (“If the various parties dealing\nwith this shipment separated the carriage into distinct\nportions by their contracts, it is not for courts judicially to\nmeld the portions into something they are not”).\n   The Court of Appeals interpreted Carmack as applying\nto any domestic rail segment of an overseas shipment,\nregardless of whether Carmack required a bill of lading.\nThe court rested on the assumption that “[STB]’s jurisdic\ntion . . . is coextensive with Carmack’s coverage.” 557\nF. 3d, at 992. Yet, as explained above, Carmack applies\nonly to shipments for which Carmack requires a bill of\nlading; that is to say, to shipments that start with a car\nrier that is both subject to the STB’s jurisdiction and\n“receives [the property] for [domestic rail] transportation.”\nThe Court of Appeals ignored this “receive[d] . . . for trans\nportation” limitation and so reached the wrong conclusion.\nSee, e.g., Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 339\n(1979) (courts are “obliged to give effect, if possible, to\nevery word Congress used”).\n   The Court of Appeals’ conclusion is also an awkward fit\nwith Carmack’s venue provisions. Under Carmack, a suit\nagainst the “originating” (that is, receiving) rail carrier\nthat has not actually caused the damage to the goods “may\nonly be brought . . . in the judicial district in which the\npoint of origin is located.” §11706(d)(2)(A), (A)(i). Suit\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nagainst either a delivering carrier or any carrier that\ncaused the damage, by contrast, may be brought in vari\nous other districts. See §11706(d)(2)(B), (C). “[J]udicial\ndistrict” refers to “district court of the United States or in\na State Court.” §11706(d)(1). Carmack’s venue provisions\npresume that the receiving carrier obtains the property in\na judicial district within the United States. Here, the\njourney’s “point of origin” was China, so Carmack’s venue\nprovisions reinforce the interpretation that Carmack does\nnot apply to this carriage.\n  Indeed, if “K” Line were a receiving carrier in a case\nwhere the journey’s “point of origin” was China, there\nwould be no place under Carmack to sue “K” Line, since\nChina is not within a judicial district “of the United States\nor in a State court.” Ibid. Carmack’s original premise is\nthat the receiving carrier is liable for damage caused by\nthe other carriers in the delivery chain. This premise\nwould be defeated if there were no venue in which to sue\nthe receiving rail carrier, as opposed to suing a different\ncarrier under one of Carmack’s other venue provisions and\nthen naming the receiving carrier as a codefendant. The\nfar more likely conclusion is that “K” Line is not a receiv\ning rail carrier at all under Carmack, and thus Carmack,\nincluding its venue provisions, does not apply to property\nshipped under “K” Line’s through bills. True, if the sole\nquestion were one of venue, suit could still be brought\nagainst the carrier that caused the damage or the deliver\ning carrier. But the issue need not be explored here, for,\nas the Court holds, Carmack is inapplicable in these cases.\n                             B\n  Carmack’s statutory history supports the conclusion\nthat it does not apply to a shipment originating overseas\nunder a through bill. None of Carmack’s legislative ver\nsions have applied to the inland domestic rail segment of\nan import shipment from overseas under a through bill.\n16   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Congress enacted Carmack in 1906, as an amendment\nto the Interstate Commerce Act. At that time, the amend\nment’s provisions applied only to “property for transporta\ntion from a point in one State to a point in another State.”\n§7, 34 Stat. 595. Congress amended Carmack in 1915, §1,\n38 Stat. 1197, and the relevant language remained un\nchanged until Carmack was recodified in 1978. Under the\npre-1978 language, Carmack’s bill of lading provisions\napplied not only to wholly domestic rail transport but also\nto cargo “receive[d] . . . for transportation” “from any point\nin the United States to a point in an adjacent foreign\ncountry.” 49 U. S. C. §20(11) (1976 ed.).\n   Even if there could be some argument that the Carmack\nAmendment before 1978 applied to imports from Canada\nand Mexico because the phrase “from . . . to” could also\nmean “between,” cf. Reider, supra, at 118 (explicitly not\ndeciding this issue), the Court is unaware of any authority\nholding that the Carmack Amendment before 1978 applied\nto cargo originating from nonadjacent overseas countries\nunder a through bill. See, e.g., In re The Cummins\nAmendment, 33 I. C. C. 682, 693 (1915); Brief for Respon\ndents 8 (effectively conceding this point).\n   In 1978, Congress adopted the Carmack Amendment in\nlargely its current form. §1, 92 Stat. 1337. Congress in\nthe statute itself stated that it was recodifying Carmack\nand instructed that this recodification “may not be con\nstrued as making a substantive change in the la[w].”\n§3(a), id., at 1466; see Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Okla\nhoma Tax Comm’n, 481 U. S. 454, 457, n. 1 (1987). By\ninterpreting the current version of the Carmack Amend\nment to cover cargo originating overseas, the Court of\nAppeals disregarded this direction and dramatically ex\npanded Carmack’s scope beyond its historical coverage.\n   Finally, in 1995, Congress reenacted Carmack. But that\nreenactment evidenced no intent to affect the substantive\nchange that Court of Appeals’ decision would entail. See\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n§102(a), 109 Stat. 847–849. There is no claim that the\n1995 statute altered Carmack’s text in any manner rele\nvant here, as that reenactment merely indented subsec\ntions of Carmack for readability. Cf. United States v.\nO’Brien, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 14)\n(“[C]urrent legislative drafting guidelines . . . advise draft\ners to break lengthy statutory provisions into separate\nsubsections that can be read more easily”).\n                              C\n   Where the text permits, congressional enactments\nshould be construed to be consistent with one another.\nAnd the interpretation of Carmack the Court now adopts\nattains the most consistency between Carmack and\nCOGSA. First, applying Carmack to the inland segment\nof an international carriage originating overseas under a\nthrough bill would undermine Carmack’s purposes. Car\nmack is premised on the view that the shipment has a\nsingle bill of lading and any damage during the journey is\nthe responsibility of both the receiving and the delivering\ncarrier. See supra, at 6. Yet, under the Court of Appeals’\ninterpretation of Carmack, there would often be no venue\nin which to sue the receiving carrier. See supra, at 14–15.\n   Applying two different bill of lading regimes to the same\nthrough shipment would undermine COGSA and interna\ntional, container-based multimodal transport. As Kirby\nexplained, “[t]he international transportation industry\n‘clearly has moved into a new era—the age of multimo\ndalism, door-to-door transport based on efficient use of all\navailable modes of transportation by air, water, and\nland.’ ” 543 U. S., at 25 (quoting 1 T. Schoenbaum, Admi\nralty and Maritime Law 589 (4th ed. 2004)). If Carmack\napplied to an inland segment of a shipment from overseas\nunder a through bill, then one set of liability and venue\nrules would apply when cargo is damaged at sea (COGSA)\nand another almost always would apply when the damage\n18   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\noccurs on land (Carmack). Rather than making claims by\ncargo owners easier to resolve, a court would have to\ndecide where the damage occurred to determine which law\napplied. As a practical matter, this requirement often\ncould not be met; for damage to the content of containers\ncan occur when the contents are damaged by rough han\ndling, seepage, or theft, at some unknown point. See H.\nKindred & M. Brooks, Multimodal Transport Rules 143\n(1997). Indeed, adopting the Court of Appeals’ approach\nwould seem to require rail carriers to open containers at\nthe port to check if damage has been done during the sea\nvoyage. This disruption would undermine international\ncontainer-based transport. The Court will not read Con\ngress’ nonsubstantive recodification of Carmack in 1978 to\ncreate such a drastic sea change in practice in this area.\n   Applying Carmack’s provisions to international import\nshipping transport would also undermine the “purpose of\nCOGSA, to facilitate efficient contracting in contracts for\ncarriage by sea.” Kirby, supra, at 29. These cases provide\nan apt illustration. The sophisticated cargo owners here\nagreed to maritime bills of lading that applied to the\ninland segment through the Himalaya Clause and author\nized “K” Line to subcontract for that inland segment “on\nany terms whatsoever.” The cargo owners thus made the\ndecision to select “K” Line as a single company for their\nthrough transportation needs, rather than contracting for\nrail services themselves. The through bills provided the\nliability and venue rules for the foreseeable event that the\ncargo was damaged during carriage. Indeed, the cargo\nowners obtained separate insurance to protect against any\nexcess loss. The forum-selection clause the parties agreed\nupon is “an indispensable element in international trade,\ncommerce, and contracting” because it allows parties to\n“agre[e] in advance on a forum acceptable” to them. The\nBremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407 U. S. 1, 13–14 (1972).\nA clause of this kind is enforced unless it imposes a venue\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“so gravely difficult and inconvenient that [the plaintiff]\nwill for all practical purposes be deprived of his day in\ncourt.” Id., at 18. The parties sensibly agreed that be\ncause their bills were governed by Japanese law, Tokyo\nwould be the best venue for any suit relating to the cargo.\n   The cargo owners’ contrary policy arguments are un\navailing. They assert that if Carmack does not apply, the\ninland segment of international shipments will be “un\nregulated.” Brief for Respondents 2, 21, 24, 64, 91. First,\nany speculation that not applying Carmack to inland\nsegments of overseas shipments will cause severe prob\nlems is refuted by that fact that Carmack even arguably\ndid not govern the inland portion of such shipments from\nits enactment in 1906 until its nonsubstantive recodifica\ntion in 1978. See supra, at 15–17. It is true that if the\ncargo owners’ position were to prevail, the terms of\nthrough bills of lading made in maritime commerce would\nbe more restricted in some circumstances. But that does\nnot mean that the Court’s holding leaves the field unregu\nlated. Ocean-based through bills are governed by COGSA,\nand ocean vessels like those operated by “K” Line are\noverseen by the Federal Maritime Commission. Supra, at\n4–5. Rail carriers like Union Pacific, furthermore, remain\nsubject to the STB’s regulation to the extent they operate\nwithin the United States. See supra, at 13–14. It is nota\nble that although the STB has jurisdiction to regulate the\nrates of such carriers, even when the carriage is not gov\nerned by the Carmack Amendment, STB has exercised its\nauthority to exempt from certain regulations service pro\nvided by a rail carrier “as part of a continuous intermodal\nfreight movement,” 49 CFR §1090.2 (2009), like the jour\nney at issue in these cases, see ibid. (exercising STB’s\nderegulation authority under 49 U. S. C. §10502(f)).\n   Finally, the cargo owners miss the mark in relying on\nthe recent United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\nInternational Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea,\n20   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v.

A/RES/63/122 (Dec. 11, 2008).\nNothing in the Rotterdam Rules, however, requires every\ncountry to mandate a different regime to govern the inland\nrail leg of an international through shipment; and, as ex\nplained above, Congress, by enacting COGSA, has opted for\nallowing shipments governed by a single through bill. And\nif the objection is that today’s decision will undermine the\nresults of these international negotiations in some way,\nthat concern is met by the fact that the United States\nGovernment has urged the result the Court adopts today.\nSee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13–29.\n   Congress has decided to allow parties engaged in inter\nnational maritime commerce to structure their contracts,\nto a large extent, as they see fit.

Unless they have\npermissibly contracted around Carmack’s requirements,\nrail carriers in the United States such as petitioner Union\nPacific are subject to those requirements, even though\nocean carriers such as petitioner “K” Line are not. To\navoid this simple conclusion, the Court contorts the stat­\nute and our cases, misreads the statutory history, and\nascribes to Congress a series of policy choices that Con­\ngress manifestly did not make. Because I believe Carmack\nprovides the default legal regime for rail transportation of\ncargo within the United States, regardless of whether the\nshipment originated abroad, I would reach the second\nquestion presented: whether Union Pacific was free to opt\n2   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nout of Carmack under 49 U. S. C. §10709, or whether\nUnion Pacific first had to offer “K” Line, its contractual\ncounterparty, Carmack-compliant terms under §10502.\nAs to that question, I would hold that opt-out under\n§10709 was not available and would remand to the Dis­\ntrict Court to consider in the first instance whether Union\nPacific satisfied its obligations under §10502. For these\nreasons, I respectfully dissent.\n                               I\n  The Court’s interpretation of Carmack’s scope is wrong\nas a matter of text, history, and policy.\n                              A\n                              1\n  I begin with the statute’s text. Two provisions guide my\nconclusion that Carmack provides the default legal regime\nfor the inland leg of a multimodal shipment traveling on\nan international through bill of lading: §11706(a), which\noutlines the basic requirements for liability under Car­\nmack, and §10501(a), which defines the jurisdiction of the\nSurface Transportation Board (STB or Board), the succes­\nsor to the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), see\nante, at 7. Section 11706(a) states as follows:\n      “A rail carrier providing transportation or service\n    subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part\n    shall issue a receipt or bill of lading for property it re­\n    ceives for transportation under this part. That rail\n    carrier and any other carrier that delivers the prop­\n    erty and is providing transportation or service subject\n    to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part are li­\n    able to the person entitled to recover under the receipt\n    or bill of lading. The liability imposed under this sub­\n    section is for the actual loss or injury to the property\n    caused by—\n      “(1) the receiving rail carrier;\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

A delivering rail car­\n    rier is deemed to be the rail carrier performing the\n    line-haul transportation nearest the destination but\n    does not include a rail carrier providing only a switch­\n    ing service at the destination.”\nWith respect to the Board’s jurisdiction, §10501(a) pro­\nvides as follows:\n       “(1) Subject to this chapter, the Board has jurisdic­\n    tion over transportation by rail carrier that is—\n            “(A) only by railroad; or\n            “(B) by railroad and water, when the transporta­\n         tion is under common control, management, or ar­\n         rangement for a continuous carriage or shipment.\n       “(2) Jurisdiction under paragraph (1) applies only to\n    transportation in the United States between a place\n    in—\n         “(A) a State and a place in the same or another\n       State as part of the interstate rail network;\n         .            .          .           .         .\n         “(E) the United States and another place in the\n       United States through a foreign country; or\n         “(F) the United States and a place in a foreign\n       country.”\n  “A simple, straight-forward reading of [these provisions]\npractically compels the conclusion that the Carmack\nAmendment applies in a typical multimodal carriage case\nwith inland damage.” Sturley, Maritime Cases About\nTrain Wrecks: Applying Maritime Law to the Inland\n4   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v.

The first sentence of\n§11706(a) sets forth the circumstances in which a receiv­\ning rail carrier must issue a bill of lading: when property\nis first “receive[d]” for domestic transportation. This\nsentence does not define the full scope of Carmack liabil­\nity, however, as the penultimate sentence of §11706(a)\nmakes the absence of a bill of lading ultimately immate­\nrial to the question of Carmack liability. Instead, the\nsecond sentence of §11706(a) establishes Carmack’s ex­\npansive scope, explaining which carriers are subject to\nCarmack liability: not only the rail carrier that receives\nthe property, but also “any other carrier that delivers the\nproperty and is providing transportation or service subject\nto the jurisdiction of the Board under this part.” Criti­\ncally, that a rail carrier’s provision of “transportation or\nservice subject to the jurisdiction of the Board” is the\ncriterion that establishes liability under Carmack demon­\nstrates that Carmack’s scope must be considered in tan­\ndem with the provision describing the Board’s jurisdiction\nover rail carriage.\n   Under that provision, the Board has authority “over\ntransportation by rail carrier,” either when that transpor­\ntation is “only by railroad” or when it is “by railroad and\nwater, when the transportation is under common control,\nmanagement, or arrangement for a continuous carriage or\nshipment.” §10501(a)(1). Board jurisdiction over trans­\nportation by rail carrier “applies only to transportation in\nthe United States,” not to transportation abroad.\n§10501(a)(2). Within the United States, however, Board\njurisdiction exists broadly whenever that transportation is\n“between,” inter alia, “a place in . . . a State and a place in\nthe same or another State as part of the interstate rail\nnetwork,” “a place in . . . the United States and another\nplace in the United States through a foreign country,” or\n“a place in . . . the United States and a place in a foreign\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

The third sen­\ntence clarifies that liability under Carmack is imposed\nupon (1) “the receiving rail carrier” (which, under the first\nsentence of §11706(a) and the definition of the Board’s\njurisdiction over domestic rail carriage in §10501(a), is the\nrail carrier that first receives the property for transporta­\ntion in the United States); (2) “the delivering rail carrier”\n(which, under the last sentence of §11706(a) and the\nBoard’s jurisdiction over domestic rail carriage in\n§10501(a), is the final rail carrier providing the long­\ndistance transportation “nearest the destination” in the\nUnited States); and (3) “another rail carrier over whose\nline or route the property is transported in the United\nStates or from a place in the United States to a place in an\nadjacent foreign country when transported under a\nthrough bill of lading.” §11706(a). This last phrase in\n§11706(a)(3) serves two functions. It ensures that, where\nthe entire rail transportation is “[with]in the United\nStates,” any connecting rail carrier between the point at\nwhich the goods were received and the point at which the\ngoods were delivered is liable under Carmack. It also\nensures that, where the final destination of the goods is in\nCanada or Mexico, such that there is no domestic “deliver­\ning” carrier, a connecting carrier taking on the goods in\nthe United States will remain subject to Carmack as it\ntravels toward its foreign destination while still in the\nUnited States. (As noted, the jurisdictional provision,\nincorporated by reference in §11706(a), is limited to\n“transportation in the United States,” §10501(a)(2).)\n   The language of Carmack thus announces an expansive\nintent to provide the liability regime for rail carriage of\nproperty within the United States. Once a first domestic\nrail carrier subject to the Board’s jurisdiction receives\nproperty in the United States, Carmack attaches, regard­\n6   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nless of where the property originated. Carmack then\napplies to any other rail carrier subject to the Board’s\njurisdiction in the chain of transportation, no matter\nwhether the ultimate destination of the property is in the\nUnited States or elsewhere, for the period the carrier is\ntraveling within the United States.\n    It seems to me plain that, under these broadly inclusive\nprovisions, Carmack governs rail carriers such as Union\nPacific for any transportation of cargo within the United\nStates, whether or not their domestic transportation is\npart of a multimodal international shipment, and whether\nor not they actually issued a domestic bill of lading. There\nis no question that Union Pacific is a “rail carrier” that is\n“subject to the jurisdiction of the Board.” §11706(a). It\n“receive[d]” the cargo, ibid., in California for domestic\ntransportation to four different domestic inland loca­\ntions—i.e., “between a place in . . . a State and a place in\n. . . another State,” §10501(a)(2)(A)—while the shipment\nitself was transported “between a place in . . . the United\nStates and a place in a foreign country,” §10501(a)(2)(F).\nUnion Pacific should have issued a bill of lading for the\ncargo it received, but its failure to do so does not shield it\nfrom liability, as §11706(a) makes clear. Carmack there­\nfore provides the legal regime governing Union Pacific’s\nrail transportation in these cases.\n    Carmack does not, however, govern ocean carriers such\nas “K” Line, because such carriers are not “rail carrier[s]\nproviding transportation or service subject to the jurisdic­\ntion of the Board.” §11706(a). The ICA defines a “rail\ncarrier” as “a person providing common carrier railroad\ntransportation for compensation.” §10102(5). To resolve\nwhether “K” Line meets this definition, I would apply the\nSTB’s well established test and ask whether it “conduct[s]\nrail operations” and “ ‘hold[s] out’ that service to the pub­\nlic.” Assoc. of P&C Dock Longshoremen v. Pittsburgh and\nConneaut Dock Co., 8 I. C. C. 2d 280, 290 (1992).\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Brief for Respondents 82–83 (noting that the\nstatutory definition of “railroad” includes “ ‘intermodal\nequipment used by or in connection with a railroad,’ ”\n§10102(6)(A)). This interpretation goes too far. Read so\nliterally, the statute would render a truck a railroad sim­\nply because the truck transported containers during a\njourney in which the containers also traveled by rail.\nSuch a reading would gut the separate provisions of the\nICA governing motor carriage in subtitle IV, part B of\nTitle 49. The ICA’s broad description of what the term\n“railroad” “includes,” §10102(6), is better read as ensuring\nthat all services a rail carrier conducts are regulated\nunder the Act “to prevent overcharges and discriminations\nfrom being made under the pretext of performing such\nadditional services.” Cleveland, C., C. & St. L. R. Co. v.\nDettlebach, 239 U. S. 588, 594 (1916).\n   At oral argument, respondents focused on a separate\nargument, contending that “K” Line should be considered\na rail carrier because it conducts substantial rail opera­\ntions at its depot facility in Long Beach, California. Tr. of\nOral Arg. 37 (describing transportation between Port of\nLos Angeles, where “K” Line’s private chassis transport\nthe containers on the Port’s train tracks to the Los Ange­\nles train depot, where the containers are loaded onto\nUnion Pacific trains for inland transportation). I agree\nwith the Board, however, that “ ‘ownership and operation\nof private terminal facilities, including rail yards,’ ” is not\nsufficient to bring a shipper within the definition of “ ‘a rail\ncarrier subject to [Board] jurisdiction’ ” where the “ ‘termi­\nnal is maintained for [the ocean common carrier’s] exclu­\n8      KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v.

C. §40101 et seq., confirm my\nview that “K” Line is not a rail carrier “subject to the\njurisdiction of the Board,” 49 U. S. C. §11706(a), under\nCarmack. The STB’s jurisdiction over transportation by\nrail carriers is “exclusive,” §10501(b), while ocean carriers\nare subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Maritime\nCommission (FMC), 46 U. S. C. §40102; see also 46 CFR\n§520.1 (2009). In addition, the Board’s jurisdiction over\nwater carriage is limited to domestic water carriage. 49\nU. S. C. §13521(a)(3). The Board itself has concluded that\nocean carriers providing intermodal transportation jointly\nwith inland rail and motor carriers are subject to the\nFMC’s jurisdiction rather than its own. See Improvement\nof TOFC/COFC Regulations, 3 I. C. C. 2d 869, 883 (1987).\n   For these reasons, Carmack governs Union Pacific but\nnot “K” Line for the inland transportation at issue in these\ncases.\n                              2\n   In finding Carmack inapplicable to the inland transpor­\ntation in these cases, the majority relies on the fact that\nCarmack does not govern ocean carriers such as “K” Line.\nWhile I agree that “K” Line is not a rail carrier, the major­\nity places too much weight on that determination.

There is simply no basis in the\ntext of the statute to support the majority’s conclusion\nthat Carmack applies only when the first rail carrier in\nthe chain of transportation accepted the cargo at the\nshipment’s point of origin. Cf. ante, at 10, 12. The two\ncases the majority cites for this proposition are inapposite,\nas neither addresses an international, multimodal ship­\nment in which the first leg of the trip was by ocean.2 In\nSt. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Starbird, 243 U. S. 592, 594\n(1917), the entire shipment was by rail from Arkansas to\nNew York City. And in Mexican Light & Power Co. v.\nTexas Mexican R. Co., 331 U. S. 731, 732 (1947), the entire\nshipment was by rail from Pennsylvania to Mexico. Given\nthat the first rail carrier was in each case the carrier that\nreceived the goods from the shipper and issued a through\nbill of lading, it is unsurprising that the Court, applying\nCarmack, described that carrier as the “initial carrier.”\n243 U. S., at 595; 331 U. S., at 733. But nothing in these\ncases, and nothing in Carmack itself, requires that the\n“receiving carrier” take the goods from the shipper at the\nshipment’s point of origin.3\n  Instead, these cases are compatible with my view that\nthe “receiving carrier” is any rail carrier that first receives\ncargo for transportation in the United States. Union\n——————\n  2 The additional cases the United States cites for this proposition\n\nsuffer from this same flaw. See Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 27–28; Tr. of Oral Arg. 20.\n  3 Carmack’s venue provision refers to the “receiving rail carrier” as\n\nthe “originating rail carrier” and states that the proper venue for a\nlawsuit against this carrier is “the judicial district in which the point of\norigin is located.” §11706(d)(2)(A)(i). Especially because the focus of\nCarmack is on transportation by rail, the phrase “point of origin” in this\ncontext is best read as referring to the point of origin of the “originating\nrail carrier[’s]” transportation, not the point of origin of the shipment.\n10   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nPacific, which is unquestionably a “rail carrier” in the\nnormal sense of those words, is also the “receiving carrier”\nsubject to liability under Carmack.4 Our opinion in Reider\nv. Thompson, 339 U. S. 113 (1950), further supports this\nreading. There we explained that the test for Carmack\napplicability “is not where the shipment originated, but\nwhere the obligation of the carrier as receiving carrier\noriginated.” Id., at 117. Because Carmack applies to\ndomestic rail transport, and the domestic rail carrier’s\nobligation in that case arose in New Orleans where the\nrail carrier received the goods, it did not matter that the\nshipment began overseas in Buenos Aires. Similarly, in\nthe instant cases, because Union Pacific’s obligations to\ntransport by rail originated in California, it does not mat­\nter that the shipment began overseas in China.5\n  Second, the majority errs in suggesting that the issu­\nance of an international through bill of lading precludes\nthe applicability of Carmack. Cf. ante, at 10–11, 13. The\n——————\n  4 The  majority suggests that respondents “conceded” at oral argument\nthat Union Pacific was not a receiving carrier but only a delivering\ncarrier. Ante, at 13. Of course, this Court is not bound by a party’s\nconcession in our interpretation of a statute. See, e.g., Massachusetts v.\nUnited States, 333 U. S. 611, 624–625 (1948).\n   5 Contrary to Union Pacific’s suggestion, Brief for Petitioner in 08–\n\n1554, p. 33, its obligations did not originate in China. “K” Line’s bills of\nlading, issued in China, “entitled [“K” Line] to sub-contract on any\nterms . . . all duties whatsoever undertaken,” App. 145, and therefore\ndid not create any obligation on the part of Union Pacific in China. In\nturn, the agreement between “K” Line and Union Pacific—which “K”\nLine made “by and through its duly authorized agent and representa­\ntive in the United States, ‘K’ Line AMERICA, Inc. . . ., a Michigan\ncorporation,” id., at 120—was a multiyear contract committing “K” Line\nto “tender to [Union Pacific] not less than 95% of its Container traffic,”\nibid., but did not actually commit “K” Line to deliver any particular\npiece of cargo to Union Pacific. As “K” Line explains, then, “the Agree­\nment [with Union Pacific] was a ‘requirements’ contract, which did not\nbecome effective as to any particular container until ‘K’ Line delivered\nit” to Union Pacific in California.

In Reider, the Court found Carmack applica­\nble when the first domestic rail carrier issued a bill of\nlading from New Orleans to Boston. Although we ob­\nserved in that opinion that there was no through bill of\nlading from Buenos Aires to Boston, 339 U. S., at 117, we\ndid not say, and it is not a necessary corollary, that the\npresence of such a bill of lading would have commanded a\ndifferent result. The observation is better read as indicat­\ning that no law other than Carmack could possibly have\napplied in that case: Because “the shipment . . . could not\nhave moved an inch beyond New Orleans under the ocean\nbill,” id., at 118, a new domestic bill of lading for domestic\ntransportation was required, and as to that transporta­\ntion, we held, Carmack unquestionably applied.\n   For its part, Mexican Light held only that, where the\nfirst rail carrier in the chain of transportation issued a bill\nof lading, a subsequent bill of lading issued by a later rail\ncarrier was void because Carmack contemplates one\nthrough bill of lading governing the entire journey by rail.\n331 U. S., at 734. A subsequent bill of lading by a connect­\ning rail carrier, however, can be void under Carmack\nwithout requiring the conclusion that an international\nthrough bill of lading involving initial transportation by\nocean carrier would void a subsequent bill of lading issued\nin the United States by the first rail carrier in the domes­\ntic chain of transportation. Because the text of Carmack\nexpressly requires a bill of lading to be issued for property\n“receive[d] for transportation under this part,” and Union\nPacific first received the property for rail transportation in\nthe United States, it should have issued a bill of lading.\nOf course, its failure to do so did not affect its liability\nunder Carmack (or that of a subsequent connecting or\ndelivering carrier), as §11706(a) explicitly states.\n   Third, the majority errs in giving weight to the differ­\nence in scope between Carmack liability and the jurisdic­\n12   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ntion of the Board. Ante, at 14. I agree with the majority\nthat Carmack’s reach is narrower than the Board’s juris­\ndiction. The Board’s jurisdiction extends over transporta­\ntion by rail carrier “in the United States between a place\nin . . . the United States and a place in a foreign country,”\n§10501(a)(2)(F), which indicates that it does not matter\nwhether the movement of the transportation is from the\nUnited States to the foreign country or from the foreign\ncountry to the United States.6 In contrast, Carmack ap­\nplies only when a rail carrier first receives property in the\nUnited States, §11706(a), and therefore would not apply to\na rail carrier originating in Canada and delivering in the\nUnited States without transferring the property to a\ndomestic rail carrier.7 As long as there is a receiving rail\ncarrier in the United States, however, Carmack attaches.\nBecause the property at issue in these cases was received\nin the United States for domestic transportation by Union\nPacific, Carmack governs the rail carrier’s liability.\n   Finally, the majority misunderstands the role I believe\nCarmack liability plays in international shipments to the\nUnited States. My reading of the statute would not “out­\nlaw through shipments under a single bill of lading.”\n——————\n   6 The ICA’s jurisdictional provision uses the term “foreign country” to\n\ndescribe the Board’s jurisdiction, §10501(a)(2)(F), while Carmack uses\nthe term “adjacent foreign country” to describe the liability of connect­\ning carriers, §11706(a)(3). I find the difference between these terms to\nbe of no moment. Section 10501 describes the Board’s jurisdiction over\nrail carriers, and it is impossible to have connecting rail lines between\nthe United States and a foreign country that is not adjacent. This\nreading is confirmed by §10501(a)(2)(E), which refers to the Board’s\njurisdiction over transportation by railroad “in the United States\nbetween a place in . . . the United States and another place in the\nUnited States and a foreign country.” No rail transportation between\ntwo places in the United States that is interrupted by rail transporta­\ntion through a foreign country could be through a foreign country that\nis anything but adjacent.\n   7 This situation is consistent with historical agreements between the\n\nICC and its Canadian counterpart.

To the contrary, an overseas ocean carrier\nlike “K” Line can still issue a through bill of lading govern­\ning the entire international trip to an American destina­\ntion. That bill of lading reflects the ocean carrier’s agree­\nment with and obligations to the original shipper of the\ncargo. As the ocean carrier has no independent Carmack\nobligations of its own, the ocean carrier and the shipper\nare free to select whatever liability terms they wish to\ngovern their relationship during the entire shipment. See\ninfra, at 20–21. Carmack simply requires an American\n“receiving rail carrier” like Union Pacific to issue a bill of\nlading to the party from whom it received the goods for\nshipment—here, “K” Line. See Norfolk Southern R. Co. v.\nJames N. Kirby, Pty Ltd., 543 U. S. 14, 33 (2004) (“When\nan intermediary contracts with a carrier to transport\ngoods, the cargo owner’s recovery against the carrier is\nlimited by the liability limitation to which the intermedi­\nary and carrier agreed”); Great Northern R. Co. v.\nO’Connor, 232 U. S. 508, 514–515 (1914) (holding that a\nrailroad company is entitled to treat the intermediary\nforwarder as the shipper). As to that bill of lading, Car­\nmack provides the legal regime and defines the relation­\nship between the contracting parties (unless they have\nagreed to contract out of Carmack, see infra, at 23–26).\nThe issuance of this second bill of lading, however, in no\nway undermines the efficiency of the through bill of lading\nbetween the ocean carrier and the original shipper, nor\ndoes it require that those parties bind themselves to apply\nCarmack to the inland leg.8\n——————\n  8 The majority seems to find it troubling that my view “would require\n\ntwo bills of lading.” Ante, at 13. But international shipments fre­\nquently contain more than one bill of lading. See, e.g., Kirby, 543 U.

The Court states\nthat no version of Carmack has ever applied to imports\noriginating overseas on a through bill of lading. Ante, at\n15. The Court further asserts that, because Congress\nstated that the 1978 recodification of the ICA effected no\n“substantive change,” Carmack should be read consis­\ntently with this historical practice. Ante, at 16. There are\nthree problems with this analysis.\n   First, if “Congress intended no substantive change” to\nCarmack in the 1978 recodification, “that would mean only\nthat the present text is the best evidence of what the law\nhas always meant, and that the language of the prior\nversion cannot be relied upon to support a different read­\ning.” Keene Corp. v. United States, 508 U. S. 200, 221\n(1993) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Because the present text\nof Carmack indicates that it applies to the domestic inland\nrail transportation of a multimodal international ship­\nment, there is no reason to rely on Congress’ statement in\nthe recodification.\n   Second, there is no necessary conflict between the pre­\n——————\nwarder delivered the shipper’s goods). The majority also suggests that\nan original shipper might not be able to sue Union Pacific under the\nterms of Union Pacific’s bill with “K” Line. Ante, at 13. In Kirby,\nhowever, we took as a given that the shipper could sue the inland rail\ncarrier, even though the shipper was not a party to the rail carrier’s bill\nof lading with an intermediary. Indeed, we held that in an action\nagainst the rail carrier, the shipper was bound to the terms of the bill of\nlading governing the rail carrier’s transportation, even though those\nterms were less generous than the terms in the shipper’s through bill of\nlading with the freight forwarder with which it originally contracted.\n543 U. S., at 33–34. We observed that the shipper could sue the freight\nforwarder to recover the difference. Id., at 35. In light of this analysis,\nI see no reason to doubt a shipper’s ability to sue an American rail\ncarrier under Carmack, even though its bill of lading with an overseas\nocean carrier is not governed by Carmack.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

The pre-1978 text referred to a carrier “receiving\nproperty for transportation from a point in one State or\nTerritory or the District of Columbia to a point in another\nState, Territory, [or the] District of Columbia, or from any\npoint in the United States to a point in an adjacent foreign\ncountry.” 49 U. S. C. §20(11) (1976).9 A rail carrier like\nUnion Pacific who receives property in California for\ntransportation to locations in the American midwest “re­\nceiv[es] property from a point in one State . . . to a point in\nanother State,” regardless of whether the property origi­\nnated in California or China. The geographical restriction\n“from any point in the United States to a point in an adja­\ncent foreign country” simply reflected agreements between\nthe ICC and its Canadian counterpart to respect each\nother’s regulation of rail carriage originating in that coun­\ntry. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae (herein­\nafter Brief for United States) 17–18. It does not indicate\nany rejection of Carmack’s applicability to imports as a\nwhole or exports to a nonadjacent foreign country.10 In­\n——————\n  9 The  pre-1978 version of Carmack referred generally to a “carrier,”\nrather than a “rail carrier.” It was not until 1995 that Congress distin­\nguished between Carmack’s applicability to rail carriers, §11706, and\nmotor carriers, freight forwarders, and domestic water carriers, §14706.\nPub. L. No. 104–88, §102(a), 109 Stat. 803, 847–849, 907–910.\n   10 The Court ignores a further reason to believe that prior to 1978,\n\nCarmack could be understood to apply to imports as well as exports.\nEven assuming (contrary to my view) that the relevant language in\nCarmack governing any international commercial exchange was the\nphrase “from any point in the United States to a point in an adjacent\nforeign country,” the seemingly uni-directional “from . . . to” could\nreasonably have been interpreted as also encompassing “to . . . from” in\nlight of our decision in Galveston, H. & S. A. R. Co. v. Woodbury, 254\nU. S. 357 (1920). In that case, this Court interpreted similar “from . . .\nto” language in the jurisdictional section of the ICA as conferring\njurisdiction on the ICC over all transportation between such countries.\nId., at 359–360 (construing “ ‘transportation . . . from any place in the\nUnited States to an adjacent foreign country’ ” in former 49 U.

As we have often\nobserved, “[a] specific provision controls one of more gen­\neral application.” Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U. S.\n395, 407 (1991). The general statement that Congress\nintended no change to the ICA should not require us to\nignore what the current text of the specific Carmack pro­\nvision says, as both Union Pacific and “K” Line explicitly\nask us to do. See Brief for Petitioner in No. 08–1554, at 20\n(“The Pre-1978 Statutory Language Controls This Case”);\nBrief for Petitioners in No. 08–1553, at 41–49 (arguing for\nreliance on pre-1978 text). Petitioners’ view of statutory\ninterpretation would give rise to an unwieldy—and un­\njust—system. I would have thought it beyond cavil that\nlitigants are entitled to rely on the currently applicable\nversion of enacted statutes to determine their rights and\nobligations.\n   In the final analysis, the meaning of the pre-1978 lan­\n——————\nto include “transportation . . . from that country to the United States”).\nGiven the “presumption that a given term is used to mean the same\nthing throughout a statute,” Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S. 115, 118\n(1994) (citing Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers, Inc. v. United States, 286 U. S.\n427 (1932)), our construction of “from . . . to” in the ICA’s jurisdictional\nprovision could reasonably have been read to sweep imports within the\nscope of Carmack. I would not, however, read “from . . . to” in the\ncurrent version of §11706(a)(3) to encompass “to . . . from,” as Congress\nspecifically amended the similar language in the jurisdictional provi­\nsion at §10501(a)(2) to “between” while leaving intact the “to . . . from”\nin Carmack, against the background of Woodbury.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

The current text does not restrict\nCarmack’s coverage to trade with adjacent foreign coun­\ntries, and it makes no distinction between imports and\nexports. Carmack’s ambiguous history cannot justify\nreading such atextual limitations into the statute.11\n                           C\n  The Court’s suggestion that its interpretation properly\neffectuates the goals of Carmack and “attains the most\n——————\n   11 The United States, as amicus in support of “K” Line and Union\n\nPacific, makes an effort to find such limitations in the current statutory\ntext. See Brief for United States 21; see also Reply Brief for Petitioner\nin No. 08–1554, p. 10 (agreeing with the United States’ interpretation).\nThis argument is unpersuasive. The United States observes that\n§11706(a)(3) describes the liability of “another rail carrier over whose\nline or route the property is transported in the United States or from a\nplace in the United States to a place in an adjacent foreign country\nwhen transported under a through bill of lading.” (Emphasis added.)\nAccording to the United States, “[t]hat textual limitation, when read in\nlight of Carmack’s purpose, reflects Congress’s continued intent to\nrestrict Carmack to the carriage of goods between places in the United\nStates and for export to an adjacent foreign country.” Brief for United\nStates 21. As I have already explained, however, once a domestic rail\ncarrier first receives property for transportation within the United\nStates, regardless of where the property itself originated, Carmack\napplies. Supra, at 3–6. Section 11706(a)(3) simply ensures that when a\nconnecting carrier that neither received the property in the United\nStates nor delivered it in the United States transports the property\nfrom the United States to either Canada or Mexico, that connecting\ncarrier remains subject to Carmack liability during the part of the\ntransportation that is in the United States. Further, as I explain\nbelow, see infra, at 18–20, Carmack’s purpose would be better effectu­\nated by applying its provisions inland as the default rule. In any event,\nthe “adjacent foreign country” provision in §11706(a)(3) has no bearing\non the rail transportation provided in these cases by Union Pacific as\n“receiving rail carrier,” §11706(a), from California to four locations in\nthe American midwest. To this transportation, Carmack plainly\napplies.\n18   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nconsistency between Carmack and [the Carriage of Goods\nby Sea Act (COGSA)],” ante, at 17, reflects its fundamental\nmisunderstanding of these statutes and the broader legal\ncontext in which the international shipping industry\nfunctions. As the mandatory default regime governing the\nrelationship between an American receiving rail carrier\nand its direct contracting partner (here an overseas ocean\ncarrier), Carmack permits the shippers who contract for a\nthrough bill of lading with the ocean carrier to receive the\nbenefit of Carmack through that once-removed relation­\nship. Such a legal regime is entirely consistent with\nCOGSA and industry practice.\n   As noted, the Court’s position as to Carmack rests on its\nerroneous belief that the “receiving carrier” must receive\nthe goods at the point of the shipment’s origin. Ante, at\n12–15. Because Carmack provides that suit against the\nreceiving rail carrier “may only be brought . . . in the\njudicial district in which the point of origin is located,” 49\nU. S. C. §11706(d)(2)(A)(i), and defines “judicial district” as\nonly a federal or state court, §11706(d)(2)(B), the Court\nmistakenly concludes that were Carmack to apply to\ninland transportation of international shipments, “there\nwould often be no venue in which to sue the receiving\ncarrier” because that carrier would have received the\ngoods in a foreign country where no federal or state court\nexists. Ante, at 14–15, 17. Contrary to the Court’s sugges­\ntion, however, the proper venue in which to sue a receiving\ncarrier under Carmack is the location in which the first\ndomestic rail carrier received the goods for domestic\ntransportation. Supra, at 4–5, 9.\n   Nor is it true that Carmack’s focus is on providing a\nsingle through bill of lading for an entire shipment. Ante,\nat 17. Carmack’s purpose in §11706 is to ensure that a\nsingle bill of lading, with a single protective liability re­\ngime, governs an entire shipment by rail carrier within\n                    Cite as: 561 U.

It does not place obligations on the relationship\nbetween any overseas carrier and any overseas shipper\nwho operate under their own bill of lading. That Congress\nexpected different liability regimes to govern ocean and\nrail carriers can be inferred from the different regulatory\noversight provided for each type of carrier—the FMC for\nthe former, the STB for the latter, see supra, at 8.\n   Moreover, that Carmack provides certain greater pro­\ntections than does COGSA demonstrates that one of Car­\nmack’s purposes—beyond simply the fact of a single bill of\nlading governing all rail transportation—was to specify a\nprotective liability regime for that part of the shipment\nonly. As compared to COGSA, Carmack provides height­\nened liability rules for rail transportation, compare\nCOGSA §4, 49 Stat. 1207, note following 46 U. S. C.\n§30701, p. 1179, with 49 U. S. C. §§11706(a)–(c); stricter\nvenue requirements, compare Vimar Seguros y Reasegu\nros, S. A. v. M/V Sky Reefer, 515 U. S. 528, 535 (1995),\nwith §11706(d); and more generous time allowances for\nfiling suit, compare COGSA §3(6), at 1179, with §11706(e).\nCongress is evidently wary of creating broad exemptions\nfrom Carmack’s regime: While Congress has given expan­\nsive authority to the STB to deregulate carriers from the\nrequirements of the ICA, it has precluded the STB from\nexcusing carriers from complying with Carmack. See\ninfra, at 25 (discussing §10502). By taking Carmack’s\nprotections out of the picture for goods that travel by rail\nin the United States whenever the goods first traveled by\nocean liner, it is the Court that “undermine[s] Carmack’s\npurposes,” ante, at 17.

The\nCourt is correct, ante, at 8, that Congress has permitted\nparties contractually to extend COGSA, which, by its own\nterms, applies only to the period “from the time when the\ngoods are loaded on to the time when they are discharged\nfrom the ship.” §§1(e), 7, at 1178, 1180. But the Court\nignores that COGSA specifically contemplates that there\nmay be “other law” that mandatorily governs the inland\nleg, and makes clear that contractual extension of COGSA\ndoes not trump this law. §12, at 1180 (“Nothing in\n[COGSA] shall be construed as superseding . . . any . . .\nother law which would be applicable in the absence of\n[COGSA], insofar as they relate to the duties, responsibili­\nties, and liabilities of the ship or carrier prior to the time\nwhen the goods are loaded on or after the time they are\ndischarged from the ship”); see also Sturley, Freedom of\nContract and the Ironic Story of Section 7 of the Carriage\nof Goods by Sea Act, 4 Benedict’s Mar. Bull. 201, 202\n(2006) (“It is highly ironic to suggest that section 7 was\nintended to facilitate the extension of COGSA [inland].\nThe unambiguous history demonstrates that section 7 was\nspecifically designed to accomplish exactly the opposite\nresult”). Notably, when it wants to do so, Congress knows\nhow to specify that a contractual extension of COGSA\nsupersedes other law: COGSA elsewhere defines a limited\ncircumstance—the carriage of goods by sea between ports\nof the United States—in which a contractual extension of\nCOGSA has the force of law. §13, at 1180 (providing that\nsuch bills of lading “shall be subjected hereto as fully as if\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Even under the\nCourt’s interpretation, two sets of rules may govern, be­\ncause the parties need not extend COGSA to the inland\nleg—they may agree on any terms they choose to cover\nthat transportation. §7, at 1180 (permitting the parties to\n“ente[r] into any agreement . . . as to the responsibility and\nliability of the carrier or the ship” for the period before the\ngoods are loaded on and after they are discharged from the\nship (emphasis added)); see also Train Wrecks 23\n(“[C]arriers regularly include clauses in their bills of lad­\ning to limit their liability [for inland travel] in ways that\nCOGSA prohibits”); 1 T. Schoenbaum, Admiralty and\nMaritime Law §10–4, p. 599–600 (4th ed. 2004) (describing\ntypical non-COGSA liability rules parties select for the\ninland leg). In these cases, for example, “K” Line’s bills of\nlading include certain terms governing the inland leg that\ndiffer from the terms governing the ocean carriage. See,\ne.g., App. 147 (providing different time frames within\nwhich suit must be brought depending on whether the\nactionable conduct “occurred during other than Water\nCarriage”).\n   The Court relies heavily on Kirby as identifying the\nrelevant policy consideration in these cases, but it takes\n\n——————\n  13 Nor would my interpretation of the statute necessarily require that\ntwo different regimes apply to each shipment, given the parties’ ability\nto contract around Carmack as long as they follow appropriate proce­\ndures, infra, at 25–27, and, if they so choose, select COGSA terms.\n22   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v.

It would even permit different\nliability rules to apply to different lawsuits arising out of\nthe same inland accident depending on where each piece\nof cargo originated. Contrary to the Court’s view, then,\nthe value of uniformity articulated in Kirby is best pro­\nmoted by application of Carmack to the obligations of the\nrail carrier during the inland leg in these cases. Cf. ante,\nat 7–8, 17–18.\n   Finally, while purporting to effectuate the contractual\nchoices of the parties in the international multimodal\nshipping industry, ante, at 17–20, the Court ignores the\nrealities of the industry’s operation. The industry has long\nbeen accustomed to drafting bills of lading that encompass\ntwo legal regimes, one governing ocean transportation and\nanother governing inland transportation, given mandatory\nlaw governing road and rail carriage in most of Europe\nand in certain countries in Asia and North Africa.

Brief\nfor Respondents 53.\n  The recently signed United Nations Convention on\nContracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly\nor Partly by Sea, also known as the “Rotterdam Rules,”\nprovided an opportunity for the international community\nto adopt rules for multimodal shipments that would be\nuniform for both the ocean and inland legs.

I\nwould hold that where, as here, the STB has exempted rail\ncarriers from Part A of the ICA pursuant to its authority\nas set forth in 49 U. S. C. §10502, such rail carriers may\nnot use §10709 to opt out of Carmack entirely. Instead,\nsuch rail carriers must first offer their contractual coun­\nterparties Carmack-compliant terms for liability and\nclaims, as §10502(e) requires. Having reached that con­\nclusion, I would remand for consideration of whether the\nrequirements of §10502(e) were met in these cases. I set\nforth these views only briefly, as the Court’s determina­\ntion that Carmack does not apply at all makes resolution\nof these questions moot.\n                           A\n  In the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, Pub.

Ante, at 20.\nThe Rotterdam Rules demonstrate simply that it is common practice to\nhave different regimes for inland and ocean transportation, so giving\nfull effect to Carmack as the default law governing the relationship\nbetween “K” Line and Union Pacific can hardly be said to “undermine\nCOGSA and international, container-based multimodal transport,”\nante, at 17.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

Consistent with these goals, 49 U. S. C.\n§§10502 and 10709 provide two options for contracting\naround the requirements of the ICA.\n   Section 10502(a) provides that when certain conditions\nare met, the Board “shall exempt,” “to the maximum\nextent consistent with this part,” “a person, class of per­\nsons, or a transaction or service” from either a particular\nprovision of Part A of the ICA or the entirety of that Part.\nSection 10502(f) specifies that “[t]he Board may exercise\nits authority under this section to exempt transportation\nthat is provided by a rail carrier as part of a continuous\nintermodal movement.” Acting pursuant to this authority,\nthe Board has broadly exempted such transportation\n“from the requirements of [the ICA].” 49 CFR §1090.2\n(2009). The authority to issue broad exemptions, however,\nis not unlimited. Under 49 U. S. C. §10502(e), “[n]o ex­\nemption order issued pursuant to this section shall oper­\nate to relieve any rail carrier from an obligation to provide\ncontractual terms for liability and claims which are consis­\ntent with the provisions of [Carmack],” although, at the\nsame time, “[n]othing . . . shall prevent rail carriers from\noffering alternative terms.” Section 10502(g) further\nlimits the Board from exempting rail carriers from their\nobligations to comply with certain employee protections\nunder Part A of the ICA.\n   In turn, under §10709(a), “[o]ne or more rail carriers\nproviding transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the\nBoard . . . may enter into a contract with one or more\npurchasers of rail services to provide specified services\nunder specified rates and conditions.” Having signed such\na contract, a rail carrier “shall have no duty in connection\nwith services provided under such contract other than\n26   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthose duties specified by the terms of the contract.”\n§10709(b). Once such a contract is made, that contract,\n“and transportation under such contract, shall not be\nsubject to this part, and may not be subsequently chal­\nlenged before the Board or in any court on the grounds\nthat such contract violates a provision of [Part A of the\nICA].” §10709(c)(1).\n   According to Union Pacific, §10502(e) limits only the\nBoard’s exemption ability; it does not place any affirma­\ntive obligation on rail carriers to offer Carmack-compliant\nterms. Rail carriers, Union Pacific contends, may opt out\nof Carmack entirely simply by entering into a contract\nunder §10709, thus escaping any duty imposed by Part A\nof the ICA. I disagree. I am persuaded by the Govern­\nment’s view that because the Board’s order in 49 CFR\n§1090.2 exempted intermodal rail transportation from all\nof Part A of the ICA, which includes 49 U. S. C. §10709,\n“Union Pacific could not properly enter into a contract\nunder Section 10709 to relieve it of its obligations under\nSection 10502(e).” Brief for United States 31. Those\nobligations require “a rail carrier providing exempt trans­\nportation [to] offer the shipper the option of contractual\nterms for liability and claims consistent with Carmack,\npresumably at a higher rate,” and they permit such a rail\ncarrier to “enter into a contract with different terms only if\nthe shipper does not select that option.” Id., at 30.\n   Observing that the Board’s exemption order relieves\nintermodal rail transportation from the “requirements” of\nPart A, Union Pacific contends that §10709 is not a re­\nquirement but a privilege and therefore is not included\nwithin the exemption. In clarifying its order, however, the\nBoard has described the exemption as one from “regula­\ntion” under the ICA or “application” of that Act. See, e.g.,\nImprovement of TOFC/COFC Regulations, 3 I. C. C. 2d, at\n869–870. Especially in light of this clarification, there\nseems little reason to ascribe significance to the Board’s\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           27\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nuse of the word “requirements,” instead of the statutory\nterm “provision,” in the exemption order.\n   The Government aptly describes the policy concerns\nthat justify this reading of the interplay between §§10502\nand 10709. Brief for United States 31–32. Because a rail\ncarrier’s counterparty to a §10709 contract can ordinarily\nrequire a rail carrier to comply with common carriage\nrates and terms under Part A (including Carmack), such\ncounterparties possess considerable bargaining power.\nBut rail carriers the Board has exempted from Part A\nunder §10502 lack any obligation to comply with that\nPart. If exempt carriers could escape Carmack’s obliga­\ntions under §10709, their counterparties would be at a\nsignificant disadvantage as compared to counterparties to\ncontracts with nonexempt carriers. Such a disadvantage\ncannot be squared with Congress’ evident intent, as ex­\npressed in §10502(e), to ensure that no carrier may be\nautomatically exempted from Carmack.\n   This interpretation of §§10502 and 10709 imposes no\nunfairness on exempt rail carriers. As the Court of Ap­\npeals explained, “carriers providing exempt transportation\ngain the benefits of deregulation, but lose the opportunity\nto contract for preferable terms under §10709 without first\noffering Carmack terms.” 557 F. 3d 985, 1002 (CA9 2009).\nGiven rail carriers’ ability to charge higher rates for full\nCarmack coverage, see New York, N. H. & H. R. Co. v.\nNothnagle, 346 U. S. 128, 135 (1953), and the likelihood\nthat some counterparties will agree to reject Carmack­\ncompliant terms in favor of a lower price, such a trade-off\nmakes eminent sense.\n                             B\n   Whether Union Pacific properly contracted out of Car­\nmack under §10502(e) requires a factual determination\nbetter suited for resolution by the District Court in the\nfirst instance. Accordingly, I would remand for considera­\n28   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ntion of that issue. Cf. 557 F. 3d, at 1003. Union Pacific\nalso raises a related legal argument not decided by the\ncourts below: that the forum selection clause at issue in\nthese cases is valid because venue is not encompassed\nwithin the phrase “contractual terms for liability and\nclaims” in §10502(e). To the extent this argument is not\nwaived, it would also be properly considered on remand.\n                         *      *     *\n  In endorsing a strained reading of the text, history, and\npurpose of Carmack, the Court is evidently concerned with\na perceived need to enforce the COGSA-based contracts\nthat the “sophisticated cargo owners” here made with “K”\nLine. Ante, at 18. But these cases do not require the\nCourt to interpret or examine the contract between the\ncargo owners and “K” Line. The Court need consider only\nthe legal relationship between Union Pacific and “K” Line\nas its direct contracting party. As to that relationship, it\nbears emphasizing that industry actors on all sides are\nsophisticated and can easily adapt to a regime in which\nCarmack provides the default rule governing the rail\ncarrier’s liability during the inland leg of a multimodal\nshipment traveling on an international through bill of\nlading. See, e.g., Train Wrecks 40 (describing how ocean\nand rail carriers have drafted their contracts to account\nfor—and permissibly escape—Carmack’s applicability); cf.\nKirby, 543 U. S., at 36 (recognizing that “our decision does\nno more than provide a legal backdrop against which\nfuture bills of lading will be negotiated”). In disregarding\nCongress’ commands in both Carmack and COGSA and in\ndiscounting the practical realities reflected in the Rotter­\ndam Rules and other international conventions governing\nthe carriage of goods, the Court ignores what we acknowl­\nedged in Kirby: “It is not . . . this Court’s task to structure\nthe international shipping industry.” Ibid.

As relevant here, the bills contain a “Himalaya\n  Clause,” which extends the bills’ defenses and liability limitations to\n  subcontractors; permit “K” Line to subcontract to complete the jour\n  ney; provide that the entire journey is governed by the Carriage of\n  Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), which regulates bills of lading issued by\n  ocean carriers engaged in foreign trade; and designate a Tokyo court\n  as the venue for any dispute. “K” Line arranged the journey, subcon\n  tracting with petitioner in No. 08–1554 (Union Pacific) for rail ship\n  ment in the United States. The cargo was shipped in “K” Line ves\n  sels to California and then loaded onto a Union Pacific train. A\n  derailment along the inland route allegedly destroyed the cargo. Ul\n  timately, the Federal District Court granted the motion of Union Pa\n  cific and “K” Line to dismiss the cargo owners’ suits against them\n  based on the parties’ Tokyo forum-selection clause. The Ninth Cir\n  cuit reversed, concluding that that clause was trumped by the Car\n  mack Amendment governing bills of lading issued by domestic rail\n  carriers, which applied to the inland portion of the shipment.\nHeld: Because the Carmack Amendment does not apply to a shipment\n originating overseas under a single through bill of lading, the parties’\n\n——————\n  * Together with No. 08–1554, Union Pacific Railroad Co. v.

Pp. 4–21.\n       (a) COGSA, which “K” Line and Union Pacific contend governs\n    these cases, requires a carrier to issue to the cargo owner a bill con\n    taining specified terms. It does not limit the parties’ ability to adopt\n    forum-selection clauses. It only applies to shipments from United\n    States ports to foreign ports and vice versa, but permits parties to ex\n    tend certain of its terms “by contract” to cover “the entire period in\n    which [the goods] would be under [a carrier’s] responsibility, includ\n    ing [a] period of inland . . . transport.” Norfolk Southern R. Co. v.\n    James N. Kirby, Pty Ltd., 543 U. S. 14, 29. The Carmack Amend\n    ment, on which respondents rely, requires a domestic rail carrier that\n    “receives [property] for transportation under this part” to issue a bill\n    of lading. 49 U. S. C. §11706(a). “[T]his part” refers to the Surface\n    Transportation Board’s (STB’s) jurisdiction over domestic rail trans\n    portation. See §10501(b). Carmack assigns liability for damage on\n    the rail route to “receiving rail carrier[s]” and “delivering rail car\n    rier[s],” regardless of which carrier caused the damage. §11706(a).\n    Its purpose is to relieve cargo owners “of the burden of searching out\n    a particular negligent carrier from among the often numerous carri\n    ers handling an interstate shipment of goods.” Reider v. Thompson,\n    339 U. S. 113, 119. Thus, it constrains carriers’ ability to limit liabil\n    ity by contract, §11706(c), and limits the parties’ choice of venue to\n    federal and state courts. §11706(d)(1). Pp. 4–7.\n       (b) In Kirby, as in these cases, an ocean shipping company issued a\n    through bill of lading that extended COGSA’s terms to the inland\n    segment, and the property was damaged during the inland rail por\n    tion. This Court held that the through bill’s terms governed under\n    federal maritime law, notwithstanding contrary state laws, 543 U. S.,\n    at 23–27, explaining that “so long as a bill of lading requires substan\n    tial carriage of goods by sea, its purpose is to effectuate maritime\n    commerce,” id., at 27, and adding that “[a]pplying state law . . . would\n    undermine the uniformity of general maritime law,” id., at 28, and\n    defeat COGSA’s apparent purpose “to facilitate efficient contracting\n    in contracts for carriage by sea,” ibid. Here, as in Kirby, “K” Line is\n    sued through bills under COGSA, in maritime commerce, and ex\n    tended its terms to the journey’s inland domestic segment. Pp. 7–8.\n       (c) The Carmack Amendment’s text, history, and purposes make\n    clear that it does not require a different result. Pp. 8–21.\n          (1) Carmack divides the realm of rail carriers into receiving, de\n    livering, and connecting rail carriers. Its first sentence requires a\n    compliant bill of lading (1) if a rail carrier provid[es] transportation\n    or service subject to the [STB’s] jurisdiction” and (2) if that carrier\n    “receives” the property “for transportation . . . .” 11706(a). It thus\n    requires the receiving rail carrier—but not the delivering or connect\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ning rail carrier—to issue a bill of lading. This conclusion is consistent\nwith statute’s text and this Court’s precedent. See St. Louis, I. M. &\nS. R. Co. v. Starbird, 243 U. S. 592, 595, 604. A receiving rail carrier\nis the initial carrier, which “receives” the property for domestic rail\ntransportation at the journey’s point of origin. If the Carmack’s bill\nof lading requirement referred not to the initial carrier, but to any\ncarrier “receiving” the property from another carrier, then every car\nrier during the shipment would have to issue its own separate bill.\nThis would be contrary to Carmack’s purpose of making the receiving\nand delivering carriers liable under a single, initial bill for damage\ncaused by any carrier within a single course of shipment. This con\nclusion is consistent with Mexican Light & Power Co. v. Texas Mexi\ncan R. Co., 331 U. S. 731, where the Court held that a bill of lading\nissued by a subsequent rail carrier when the “initial carrier” has is\nsued a through bill is “void” unless it “represents the initiation of a\nnew shipment,” id., at 733–734. And Reider, supra, is not to the con\ntrary. There, absent a through bill of lading, the original journey\nfrom Argentina terminated at the port of New Orleans, and the first\nrail carrier in the United States was the receiving rail carrier for\nCarmack purposes. Id., at 117. Carmack’s second sentence estab\nlishes that it applies only to transport of property for which a receiv\ning carrier is required to issue a bill of lading, regardless of whether\nthat carrier actually issues such a bill. See §11706(a). Thus, Car\nmack applies only if the journey begins with a receiving rail carrier\nthat had to issue a compliant bill of lading, not if the property is re\nceived at an overseas location under a through bill that covers trans\nport into an inland location in this country. The initial carrier in that\ninstance receives the property at the shipment’s point of origin for\noverseas multimodal import transport, not domestic rail transport.\nCarmack did not require “K” Line to issue bills of lading because “K”\nLine was not a receiving rail carrier. That it chose to use rail trans\nport to complete one segment of the journey under its “essentially\nmaritime” contracts, Kirby, supra, at 24, does not put it within Car\nmack’s reach. Union Pacific, which the cargo owners concede was a\nmere delivering carrier that did not have to issue its own Carmack\nbill of lading, was also not a receiving rail carrier under Carmack.\nBecause the Ninth Circuit ignored Carmack’s “receive[d] . . . for\ntransportation” limitation, it reached the wrong conclusion. Its con\nclusion is also an awkward fit with Carmack’s venue provisions,\nwhich presume that the receiving carrier obtains the property in a\njudicial district within the United States. If “K” Line were a receiv\ning carrier in a case with a “point of origin” in China, there would be\nno place under Carmack to sue “K” Line, since China is not within a\njudicial district “of the United States or in a State Court.”\n4      KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    §11706(d)(1). Pp. 8–15.\n         (2) Carmack’s statutory history supports this conclusion. None of\n    its legislative versions—the original 1906 statute or the amended\n    1915, 1978, or 1995 ones—have applied to the inland domestic rail\n    segment of an import shipment from overseas under a through bill.\n    Pp. 15–17.\n         (3) This interpretation also attains the most consistency between\n    Carmack and COGSA. Applying Carmack to the inland segment of\n    an international carriage originating overseas under a through bill\n    would undermine Carmack’s purposes, which are premised on the\n    view that a shipment has a single bill of lading and any damage is\n    the responsibility of both receiving and delivering carriers. Under\n    the Ninth Circuit’s interpretation, there might be no venue in which\n    to sue the receiving carrier. That interpretation would also under\n    mine COGSA and international, container-based multimodal trans\n    port: COGSA’s liability and venue rules would apply when cargo is\n    damaged at sea and Carmack’s rules almost always would apply\n    when the damage occurs on land. Moreover, applying Carmack to in\n    ternational import shipping transport would undermine COGSA’s\n    purpose “to facilitate efficient contracting in contracts for carriage by\n    sea.” Kirby, supra, at 29.

In that case the\nterms of a through bill were controlled by federal maritime\nlaw and by a federal statute known as the Carriage of\nGoods by Sea Act (COGSA), note following 46 U. S. C.\n§30701. Kirby held that bill of lading provisions permissi\nble under COGSA can be invoked by a domestic rail car\nrier, despite contrary state law.\n2   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  The instant cases present a question neither raised nor\naddressed in Kirby. It is whether the terms of a through\nbill of lading issued abroad by an ocean carrier can apply\nto the domestic part of the import’s journey by a rail car\nrier, despite prohibitions or limitations in another federal\nstatute. That statute is known as the Carmack Amend\nment and it governs the terms of bills of lading issued by\ndomestic rail carriers. 49 U. S. C. §11706(a).\n                              I\n   Respondents Regal-Beloit Corporation, Victory Fire\nworks, Inc., PICC Property & Casualty Company Ltd., and\nRoyal & Sun Alliance Insurance Company Ltd. are cargo\nowners or insurance firms that paid losses to cargo owners\nand succeeded to their rights, all referred to as “cargo\nowners.” To ship their goods from China to inland desti\nnations in the Midwestern United States, the cargo own\ners delivered the goods in China to petitioners in No. 08–\n1553, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Ltd., and its agent “K” Line\nAmerica, Inc., both referred to as “K” Line. All agree the\nrelevant contract terms governing the shipment are con\ntained in four through bills of lading “K” Line issued to the\ncargo owners. The bills of lading covered the entire course\nof shipment.\n   The bills required “K” Line to arrange delivery of the\ngoods from China to their final destinations in the United\nStates, by any mode of transportation of “K” Line’s choos\ning. A bill of lading “records that a carrier has received\ngoods from the party that wishes to ship them, states the\nterms of carriage, and serves as evidence of the contract\nfor carriage.” Kirby, 543 U. S., at 18–19. A through bill\nof lading covers both the ocean and inland portions of the\ntransport in a single document. Id., at 25–26.\n   “K” Line’s through bills contain five relevant provisions.\nFirst, they include a so-called “Himalaya Clause,” which\nextends the bills’ defenses and limitations on liability to\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nparties that sign subcontracts to perform services contem\nplated by the bills. See id., at 20, and n. 2. Second, the\nbills permit “K” Line “to sub-contract on any terms what\nsoever” for the completion of the journey. App. 145.\nThird, the bills provide that COGSA’s terms govern the\nentire journey. Fourth, the bills require that any dispute\nwill be governed by Japanese law. Fifth, the bills state\nthat any action relating to the carriage must be brought in\n“Tokyo District Court in Japan.” Id., at 144. The forum\nselection provision in the last clause gives rise to the\ndispute here.\n  “K” Line, pursuant to the bills of lading, arranged for\nthe entire journey. It subcontracted with petitioner in No.\n08–1554, Union Pacific Railroad Company, for rail ship\nment in the United States. The goods were to be shipped\nin a “K” Line vessel to a port in Long Beach, California,\nand then transferred to Union Pacific for rail carriage to\nthe final destinations.\n  In March and April 2005, the cargo owners brought four\ndifferent container shipments to “K” Line vessels in Chi\nnese ports. All parties seem to assume that “K” Line\nsafely transported the cargo across the Pacific Ocean to\nCalifornia. The containers were then loaded onto a Union\nPacific train and that train, or some other train operated\nby Union Pacific, derailed in Tyrone, Oklahoma, allegedly\ndestroying the cargo.\n  The cargo owners filed four separate lawsuits in the\nSuperior Court of California, County of Los Angeles. The\nsuit named “K” Line and Union Pacific as defendants.\nUnion Pacific removed the suits to the United States\nDistrict Court for the Central District of California. Union\nPacific and “K” Line then moved to dismiss based on the\nparties’ Tokyo forum-selection clause. The District Court\ngranted the motion to dismiss. It decided that the forum\nselection clause was reasonable and applied to Union\nPacific pursuant to the Himalaya Clause in “K” Line’s bills\n4   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v.

Supp. 2d 1098, 1102–1103 (2006).\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir\ncuit reversed and remanded. 557 F. 3d 985 (2009). The\ncourt concluded that the Carmack Amendment applied to\nthe inland portion of an international shipment under a\nthrough bill of lading and thus trumped the parties’ fo\nrum-selection clause. Id., at 994–995. The court noted\nthat this view was consistent with the position taken by\nthe Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, see id., at 994\n(citing Sompo Japan Ins. Co. of Am. v. Union Pacific R.\nCo., 456 F. 3d 54 (2006)), but inconsistent with the views\nof the Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, Sixth, Seventh,\nand Eleventh Circuits, see 557 F. 3d, at 994 (citing Shao v.\nLink Cargo (Taiwan) Ltd., 986 F. 2d 700 (CA4 1993);\nAmerican Road Serv.

This Court granted certio\nrari to address whether Carmack applies to the inland\nsegment of an overseas import shipment under a through\nbill of lading. 558 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n  Before turning to Carmack, a brief description of\nCOGSA is in order; for “K” Line’s and Union Pacific’s\nprimary contention is that COGSA, not Carmack, controls.\nCOGSA governs the terms of bills of lading issued by\nocean carriers engaged in foreign trade. 49 Stat. 1207, as\namended, note following 46 U. S. C. §30701, p. 1178. It\nrequires each carrier to issue to the cargo owner a bill that\ncontains certain terms. §3(3)–(8), at 1178–1179. Although\nCOGSA imposes some limitations on the parties’ authority\nto adjust liability, it does not limit the parties’ ability to\nadopt forum-selection clauses. See Vimar Seguros y\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)              5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nReaseguros, S. A. v. M/V Sky Reefer, 515 U. S. 528, 537–\n539 (1995). By its terms, COGSA only applies to ship\nments from United States ports to ports of foreign coun\ntries and vice versa. §§1(e), 13, at 1178, 1180. The stat\nute, however, allows parties “the option of extending\n[certain COGSA terms] by contract” to cover “the entire\nperiod in which [the goods] would be under [a carrier’s]\nresponsibility, including [a] period of . . . inland transport.”\nKirby, 543 U. S., at 29 (citing COGSA §7, at 1180). Ocean\ncarriers, who often must issue COGSA bills of lading, are\nregulated by the Federal Maritime Commission (Maritime\nCommission), which is responsible for oversight over\n“common carriage of goods by water in . . . foreign com\nmerce.” 46 U. S. C. §40101(1).\n                              B\n  The next statute to consider is the Carmack Amend\nment, §7, 34 Stat. 595, which governs the terms of bills of\nlading issued by domestic rail carriers. Carmack was first\nenacted in 1906 as an amendment to the Interstate Com\nmerce Act, 24 Stat. 379. The Carmack Amendment has\nbeen altered and recodified over the last century. It now\nprovides, in relevant part, as follows:\n    “(a) A rail carrier providing transportation or service\n    subject to the jurisdiction of the [Surface Transporta\n    tion Board (STB)] under this part shall issue a receipt\n    or bill of lading for property it receives for transporta\n    tion under this part. That rail carrier and any other\n    carrier that delivers the property and is providing\n    transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of\n    the [STB] under this part are liable to the person enti\n    tled to recover under the receipt or bill of lading. The\n    liability imposed under this subsection is for the ac\n    tual loss or injury to the property caused by—\n       “(1) the receiving rail carrier;\n6   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n      “(2) the delivering rail carrier; or\n      “(3) another rail carrier over whose line or route\n      the property is transported in the United States or\n      from a place in the United States to a place in an\n      adjacent foreign country when transported under a\n      through bill of lading.\n    “Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not af\n    fect the liability of a rail carrier.” 49 U. S. C. §11706;\n    see also §14706(a) (motor carriers).\n   The Carmack Amendment thus requires a rail carrier\nthat “receives [property] for transportation under this\npart” to issue a bill of lading. §11706(a). The provision\n“this part” refers to is the STB’s jurisdiction over rail\ntransportation within the United States. See §10501\n(2006 ed. and Supp. II). The STB is the successor to the\nInterstate Commerce Commission (ICC). The STB has\n“exclusive” jurisdiction to regulate “transportation by rail\ncarriers” between places in the United States as well as\nbetween a place “in the United States and a place in a\nforeign country.” §10501(a)(2)(F), (b) (2006 ed.). Regu\nlated rail carriers must provide transportation subject to\nSTB rail carrier jurisdiction “on reasonable request,”\n§11101(a), at reasonable rates,         §§10702, 10707(b),\n11101(a), (e).\n   In cases where it applies, Carmack imposes upon “re\nceiving rail carrier[s]” and “delivering rail carrier[s]”\nliability for damage caused during the rail route under the\nbill of lading, regardless of which carrier caused the dam\nage. §11706(a). Carmack’s purpose is to relieve cargo\nowners “of the burden of searching out a particular negli\ngent carrier from among the often numerous carriers\nhandling an interstate shipment of goods.” Reider v.\nThompson, 339 U. S. 113, 119 (1950). To help achieve this\ngoal, Carmack constrains carriers’ ability to limit liability\nby contract. §11706(c).\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Carmack also limits the parties’ ability to choose the\nvenue of their suit:\n    “(d)(1) A civil action under this section may be\n    brought in a district court of the United States or in a\n    State court.\n    “(2)(A) A civil action under this section may only be\n    brought—\n      “(i) against the originating rail carrier, in the judi\n      cial district in which the point of origin is located;\n      “(ii) against the delivering rail carrier, in the judi\n      cial district in which the principal place of business\n      of the person bringing the action is located if the de\n      livering carrier operates a railroad or a route\n      through such judicial district, or in the judicial dis\n      trict in which the point of destination is located; and\n      “(iii) against the carrier alleged to have caused the\n      loss or damage, in the judicial district in which such\n      loss or damage is alleged to have occurred.” §11706.\nFor purposes of these cases, it can be assumed that if\nCarmack’s terms apply to the bills of lading here, the\ncargo owners would have a substantial argument that the\nTokyo forum-selection clause in the bills is pre-empted by\nCarmack’s venue provisions. The parties argue about\nwhether they may contract out of Carmack’s venue provi\nsions and other requirements, see §§10502, 10709; but in\nlight of the disposition and ruling to follow, those matters\nneed not be discussed or further explored.\n                             III\n  In Kirby, an ocean shipping company issued a through\nbill of lading, agreeing to deliver cargo from Australia to\nAlabama. Like the through bills in the present cases, the\nKirby bill extended COGSA’s terms to the inland segment\nunder a Himalaya Clause. There, as here, the property\n8   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwas damaged by a domestic rail carrier during the inland\nrail portion. 543 U. S., at 19–20.\n  Kirby held that the through bill’s terms governed under\nfederal maritime law, notwithstanding contrary state\nlaws. Id., at 23–27. Kirby explained that “so long as a bill\nof lading requires substantial carriage of goods by sea, its\npurpose is to effectuate maritime commerce.” Id., at 27.\nThe Court added that “[a]pplying state law to cases like\nthis one would undermine the uniformity of general mari\ntime law.” Id., at 28. “Confusion and inefficiency will\ninevitably result if more than one body of law governs a\ngiven contract’s meaning.” Id., at 29. The Court noted\nthat its conclusion “reinforce[d] the liability regime Con\ngress established in COGSA,” and explained that COGSA\nallows parties to extend its terms to an inland portion of a\njourney under a through bill of lading. Ibid. Finally, the\nCourt concluded that a contrary holding would defeat “the\napparent purpose of COGSA, to facilitate efficient con\ntracting in contracts for carriage by sea.” Ibid.\n  Much of what the Court said in Kirby applies to the\npresent cases. “K” Line issued the through bills under\nCOGSA, in maritime commerce. Congress considered\nsuch international through bills and decided to permit\nparties to extend COGSA’s terms to the inland domestic\nsegment of the journey. The cargo owners and “K” Line\ndid exactly that in these cases, agreeing in the through\nbills to require that any suit be brought in Tokyo.\n                            IV\n  The cargo owners argue that the Carmack Amendment,\nwhich has its own venue provisions and was not discussed\nin Kirby, requires a different result. In particular they\nargue that Carmack applies to the domestic inland seg\nment of the carriage here, so the Tokyo forum-selection\nclause is inapplicable. For the reasons set forth below,\nthis contention must be rejected. Instructed by the text,\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhistory, and purposes of Carmack, the Court now holds\nthat the amendment does not apply to a shipment origi\nnating overseas under a single through bill of lading. As\nin Kirby, the terms of the bill govern the parties’ rights.\n                               A\n   The text of the statute charts the analytic course. Car\nmack divides the realm of rail carriers into three parts:\n(1) receiving rail carriers; (2) delivering rail carriers; and\n(3) connecting rail carriers. A “receiving rail carrier” is\none that “provid[es] transportation or service . . . for prop\nerty it receives for transportation under this part.”\n§11706(a); see §11706(a)(1). The provision “this part”\nrefers to is the STB’s jurisdiction over rail transportation\nwithin the United States. See §10501. A “delivering rail\ncarrier” “delivers the property and is providing transporta\ntion or service subject to the jurisdiction of the [STB]\nunder this part.” §11706(a); see §11706(a)(2). A connect\ning rail carrier is “another rail carrier over whose line or\nroute the property is transported in the United States or\nfrom a place in the United States to a place in an adjacent\nforeign country when transported under a through bill of\nlading.” §11706(a)(3).\n   A rail carrier’s obligation to issue a Carmack-compliant\nbill of lading is determined by Carmack’s first sentence:\n    “A rail carrier providing transportation or service sub\n    ject to the jurisdiction of the [STB] under this part\n    shall issue a receipt or bill of lading for property it re\n    ceives for transportation under this part.” §11706(a).\nThis critical first sentence requires a Carmack-compliant\nbill of lading if two conditions are satisfied. First, the rail\ncarrier must “provid[e] transportation or service subject to\nthe jurisdiction of the [STB].” Second, that carrier must\n“receiv[e]” the property “for transportation under this\npart,” where “this part” is the STB’s jurisdiction over\n10   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndomestic rail transport. Carmack thus requires the re\nceiving rail carrier—but not the delivering or connecting\nrail carrier—to issue a bill of lading. As explained below,\nascertaining the shipment’s point of origin is critical to\ndeciding whether the shipment includes a receiving rail\ncarrier.\n   The conclusion that Carmack’s bill of lading require\nment only applies to the receiving rail carrier is dictated\nby the text and is consistent with this Court’s precedent.\nSee St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Starbird, 243 U. S. 592,\n604 (1917) (explaining that Carmack “requires the receiv\ning carrier to issue a through bill of lading”). A receiving\nrail carrier is the initial carrier, which “receives” the\nproperty for domestic rail transportation at the journey’s\npoint of origin. §11706(a). If Carmack’s bill of lading\nrequirement did not refer to the initial carrier, but rather\nto any rail carrier that in the colloquial sense “received”\nthe property from another carrier, then every carrier\nduring the shipment would have to issue its own separate\nbill. This would be altogether contrary to Carmack’s\npurpose of making the receiving and delivering carriers\nliable under a single, initial bill of lading for damage\ncaused by any carrier within a single course of shipment.\n   This Court’s decision in Mexican Light & Power Co. v.\nTexas Mexican R. Co., 331 U. S. 731 (1947), supports the\nconclusion that only the receiving rail carrier must issue a\nCarmack bill of lading. There, a subsequent rail carrier in\nan export shipment from the United States to Mexico\nissued its own separate bill of lading at the U. S.-Mexico\nborder. The second bill differed from the through bill\nissued by the “initial carrier,” id., at 733, (that is, the\nreceiving carrier) at the inland point of origin. The Court\nheld that Carmack, far from requiring nonreceiving carri\ners to issue their separate bills of lading, makes any sub\nsequent bill “void” unless the “so-called second bill of\nlading represents the initiation of a new shipment.” Id., at\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n734.\n  The Court’s decision in Reider v. Thompson, 339 U. S.\n113, is not to the contrary. That case involved goods\noriginating in Argentina, bound for an inland location in\nthe United States. The Court in Reider determined that\nbecause there was no through bill of lading, the original\njourney from Argentina terminated at the port of New\nOrleans. Thus, the first rail carrier in the United States\nwas the receiving rail carrier and had to issue a Carmack\nbill of lading. Id., at 117. And because that carrier had to\nissue a separate bill of lading, it was not liable for damage\ndone during the ocean-based portion of the shipment. Id.,\nat 118–119. Notably, neither Mexican Light nor Reider\naddressed the situation in the present cases, where the\nshipment originates overseas under a through bill of lad\ning. And, for this reason, neither case discussed COGSA.\n  The Carmack Amendment’s second sentence establishes\nwhen Carmack liability applies:\n    “[The receiving rail carrier referred to in the first sen\n    tence] and any other carrier that delivers the property\n    and is providing transportation or service subject to\n    the jurisdiction of the [STB] under this part are liable\n    to the person entitled to recover under the receipt or\n    bill of lading.” §11706(a)\nThus, the receiving and delivering rail carriers are subject\nto liability only when damage is done to this “property,”\nthat is to say, to property for which Carmack’s first sen\ntence requires the receiving rail carrier to issue a bill of\nlading. Ibid. Put another way, Carmack applies only to\ntransport of property for which Carmack requires a receiv\ning carrier to issue a bill of lading, regardless of whether\nthat carrier erroneously fails to issue such a bill. See ibid.\n(“Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not affect\nthe liability of a rail carrier”). The language in some of the\nCourts of Appeals’ decisions, which were rejected by the\n12   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt of Appeals in the opinion now under review, could\nbe read to imply that Carmack applies only if a rail carrier\nactually issued a separate domestic bill of lading. See,\ne.g., Atladis, 458 F. 3d, at 1291–1294; American Road, 348\nF. 3d, at 568; Shao, 986 F. 2d, at 703; Capitol Converting,\n965 F. 2d, at 394. This may have led to some confusion.\nThe decisive question is not whether the rail carrier in fact\nissued a Carmack bill but rather whether that carrier was\nrequired to issue a bill by Carmack’s first sentence.\n   The above principles establish that for Carmack’s provi\nsions to apply the journey must begin with a receiving rail\ncarrier, which would have to issue a Carmack-compliant\nbill of lading. It follows that Carmack does not apply if\nthe property is received at an overseas location under a\nthrough bill that covers the transport into an inland loca\ntion in the United States. In such a case, there is no\nreceiving rail carrier that “receives” the property “for\n[domestic rail] transportation,” §11706(a), and thus no\ncarrier that must issue a Carmack-compliant bill of lading.\nThe initial carrier in that instance receives the property at\nthe shipment’s point of origin for overseas multimodal\nimport transport, not for domestic rail transport. (Today’s\ndecision need not address the instance where goods are\nreceived at a point in the United States for export. Nor is\nit necessary to decide if Carmack applies to goods initially\nreceived in Canada or Mexico, for import into the United\nStates. See infra, at 16.)\n   The present cases illustrate the operation of these prin\nciples. Carmack did not require “K” Line to issue bills of\nlading because “K” Line was not a receiving rail carrier.\n“K” Line obtained the cargo in China for overseas trans\nport across an ocean and then to inland destinations in the\nUnited States. “K” Line shipped this property under\nCOGSA-authorized through bills of lading. See supra, at\n4–5. That “K” Line chose to use rail transport to complete\none segment of the journey under these “essentially mari\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntime” contracts, Kirby, 543 U. S., at 24, does not put “K”\nLine within Carmack’s reach and thus does not require it\nto issue Carmack bills of lading.\n   As for Union Pacific, it was also not a receiving rail\ncarrier under Carmack. The cargo owners conceded at\noral argument that, even under their theory, Union Pacific\nwas a mere delivering carrier, which did not have to issue\nits own Carmack bill of lading. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29, 39.\nThis was a necessary concession. A carrier does not be\ncome a receiving carrier simply by accepting goods for\nfurther transport from another carrier in the middle of an\ninternational shipment under a through bill. After all,\nUnion Pacific was not the “initial carrier” for the carriage.\nMexican Light, 331 U. S., at 733.\n   If a carrier like Union Pacific, which acts as a connect\ning or delivering carrier during an international through\nshipment, was, counterintuitively, a receiving carrier\nunder Carmack, this would in effect outlaw through ship\nments under a single bill of lading. This is because a\ncarriage like the one in the present case would require two\nbills of lading: one that the overseas carrier (here, “K”\nLine) issues to the cargo owners under COGSA, and a\nsecond one that the first domestic rail carrier (here, Union\nPacific) issues to the overseas carrier under Carmack.\nKirby noted “the popularity of ‘through’ bills of lading, in\nwhich cargo owners can contract for transportation across\noceans and to inland destinations in a single transaction.”\n543 U. S., at 25–26. The Court sees no reason to read\nCOGSA and Carmack to outlaw this efficient mode of\ninternational shipping by requiring these journeys to have\nmultiple bills of lading. In addition, if Union Pacific had\nto issue a Carmack bill of lading to “K” Line, it is unclear\nwhether the cargo owners (the parties Carmack is de\nsigned to protect) would be able to sue under the terms\ngoverning that bill, especially in light of their different\nthrough bill with “K” Line. These difficulties are reason\n14   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nenough to reject this novel interpretation of Carmack,\nwhich was neither urged by any party nor adopted by any\nauthority that has been called to this Court’s attention.\n   This would be a quite different case if, as in Reider, the\nbills of lading for the overseas transport ended at this\ncountry’s ports and the cargo owners then contracted with\nUnion Pacific to complete a new journey to an inland\ndestination in the United States. Under those circum\nstances, Union Pacific would have been the receiving rail\ncarrier and would have been required to issue a separate\nCarmack-compliant bill of lading to the cargo owners. See\nReider, 339 U. S., at 117 (“If the various parties dealing\nwith this shipment separated the carriage into distinct\nportions by their contracts, it is not for courts judicially to\nmeld the portions into something they are not”).\n   The Court of Appeals interpreted Carmack as applying\nto any domestic rail segment of an overseas shipment,\nregardless of whether Carmack required a bill of lading.\nThe court rested on the assumption that “[STB]’s jurisdic\ntion . . . is coextensive with Carmack’s coverage.” 557\nF. 3d, at 992. Yet, as explained above, Carmack applies\nonly to shipments for which Carmack requires a bill of\nlading; that is to say, to shipments that start with a car\nrier that is both subject to the STB’s jurisdiction and\n“receives [the property] for [domestic rail] transportation.”\nThe Court of Appeals ignored this “receive[d] . . . for trans\nportation” limitation and so reached the wrong conclusion.\nSee, e.g., Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 339\n(1979) (courts are “obliged to give effect, if possible, to\nevery word Congress used”).\n   The Court of Appeals’ conclusion is also an awkward fit\nwith Carmack’s venue provisions. Under Carmack, a suit\nagainst the “originating” (that is, receiving) rail carrier\nthat has not actually caused the damage to the goods “may\nonly be brought . . . in the judicial district in which the\npoint of origin is located.” §11706(d)(2)(A), (A)(i). Suit\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nagainst either a delivering carrier or any carrier that\ncaused the damage, by contrast, may be brought in vari\nous other districts. See §11706(d)(2)(B), (C). “[J]udicial\ndistrict” refers to “district court of the United States or in\na State Court.” §11706(d)(1). Carmack’s venue provisions\npresume that the receiving carrier obtains the property in\na judicial district within the United States. Here, the\njourney’s “point of origin” was China, so Carmack’s venue\nprovisions reinforce the interpretation that Carmack does\nnot apply to this carriage.\n  Indeed, if “K” Line were a receiving carrier in a case\nwhere the journey’s “point of origin” was China, there\nwould be no place under Carmack to sue “K” Line, since\nChina is not within a judicial district “of the United States\nor in a State court.” Ibid. Carmack’s original premise is\nthat the receiving carrier is liable for damage caused by\nthe other carriers in the delivery chain. This premise\nwould be defeated if there were no venue in which to sue\nthe receiving rail carrier, as opposed to suing a different\ncarrier under one of Carmack’s other venue provisions and\nthen naming the receiving carrier as a codefendant. The\nfar more likely conclusion is that “K” Line is not a receiv\ning rail carrier at all under Carmack, and thus Carmack,\nincluding its venue provisions, does not apply to property\nshipped under “K” Line’s through bills. True, if the sole\nquestion were one of venue, suit could still be brought\nagainst the carrier that caused the damage or the deliver\ning carrier. But the issue need not be explored here, for,\nas the Court holds, Carmack is inapplicable in these cases.\n                             B\n  Carmack’s statutory history supports the conclusion\nthat it does not apply to a shipment originating overseas\nunder a through bill. None of Carmack’s legislative ver\nsions have applied to the inland domestic rail segment of\nan import shipment from overseas under a through bill.\n16   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Congress enacted Carmack in 1906, as an amendment\nto the Interstate Commerce Act. At that time, the amend\nment’s provisions applied only to “property for transporta\ntion from a point in one State to a point in another State.”\n§7, 34 Stat. 595. Congress amended Carmack in 1915, §1,\n38 Stat. 1197, and the relevant language remained un\nchanged until Carmack was recodified in 1978. Under the\npre-1978 language, Carmack’s bill of lading provisions\napplied not only to wholly domestic rail transport but also\nto cargo “receive[d] . . . for transportation” “from any point\nin the United States to a point in an adjacent foreign\ncountry.” 49 U. S. C. §20(11) (1976 ed.).\n   Even if there could be some argument that the Carmack\nAmendment before 1978 applied to imports from Canada\nand Mexico because the phrase “from . . . to” could also\nmean “between,” cf. Reider, supra, at 118 (explicitly not\ndeciding this issue), the Court is unaware of any authority\nholding that the Carmack Amendment before 1978 applied\nto cargo originating from nonadjacent overseas countries\nunder a through bill. See, e.g., In re The Cummins\nAmendment, 33 I. C. C. 682, 693 (1915); Brief for Respon\ndents 8 (effectively conceding this point).\n   In 1978, Congress adopted the Carmack Amendment in\nlargely its current form. §1, 92 Stat. 1337. Congress in\nthe statute itself stated that it was recodifying Carmack\nand instructed that this recodification “may not be con\nstrued as making a substantive change in the la[w].”\n§3(a), id., at 1466; see Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Okla\nhoma Tax Comm’n, 481 U. S. 454, 457, n. 1 (1987). By\ninterpreting the current version of the Carmack Amend\nment to cover cargo originating overseas, the Court of\nAppeals disregarded this direction and dramatically ex\npanded Carmack’s scope beyond its historical coverage.\n   Finally, in 1995, Congress reenacted Carmack. But that\nreenactment evidenced no intent to affect the substantive\nchange that Court of Appeals’ decision would entail. See\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n§102(a), 109 Stat. 847–849. There is no claim that the\n1995 statute altered Carmack’s text in any manner rele\nvant here, as that reenactment merely indented subsec\ntions of Carmack for readability. Cf. United States v.\nO’Brien, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 14)\n(“[C]urrent legislative drafting guidelines . . . advise draft\ners to break lengthy statutory provisions into separate\nsubsections that can be read more easily”).\n                              C\n   Where the text permits, congressional enactments\nshould be construed to be consistent with one another.\nAnd the interpretation of Carmack the Court now adopts\nattains the most consistency between Carmack and\nCOGSA. First, applying Carmack to the inland segment\nof an international carriage originating overseas under a\nthrough bill would undermine Carmack’s purposes. Car\nmack is premised on the view that the shipment has a\nsingle bill of lading and any damage during the journey is\nthe responsibility of both the receiving and the delivering\ncarrier. See supra, at 6. Yet, under the Court of Appeals’\ninterpretation of Carmack, there would often be no venue\nin which to sue the receiving carrier. See supra, at 14–15.\n   Applying two different bill of lading regimes to the same\nthrough shipment would undermine COGSA and interna\ntional, container-based multimodal transport. As Kirby\nexplained, “[t]he international transportation industry\n‘clearly has moved into a new era—the age of multimo\ndalism, door-to-door transport based on efficient use of all\navailable modes of transportation by air, water, and\nland.’ ” 543 U. S., at 25 (quoting 1 T. Schoenbaum, Admi\nralty and Maritime Law 589 (4th ed. 2004)). If Carmack\napplied to an inland segment of a shipment from overseas\nunder a through bill, then one set of liability and venue\nrules would apply when cargo is damaged at sea (COGSA)\nand another almost always would apply when the damage\n18   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\noccurs on land (Carmack). Rather than making claims by\ncargo owners easier to resolve, a court would have to\ndecide where the damage occurred to determine which law\napplied. As a practical matter, this requirement often\ncould not be met; for damage to the content of containers\ncan occur when the contents are damaged by rough han\ndling, seepage, or theft, at some unknown point. See H.\nKindred & M. Brooks, Multimodal Transport Rules 143\n(1997). Indeed, adopting the Court of Appeals’ approach\nwould seem to require rail carriers to open containers at\nthe port to check if damage has been done during the sea\nvoyage. This disruption would undermine international\ncontainer-based transport. The Court will not read Con\ngress’ nonsubstantive recodification of Carmack in 1978 to\ncreate such a drastic sea change in practice in this area.\n   Applying Carmack’s provisions to international import\nshipping transport would also undermine the “purpose of\nCOGSA, to facilitate efficient contracting in contracts for\ncarriage by sea.” Kirby, supra, at 29. These cases provide\nan apt illustration. The sophisticated cargo owners here\nagreed to maritime bills of lading that applied to the\ninland segment through the Himalaya Clause and author\nized “K” Line to subcontract for that inland segment “on\nany terms whatsoever.” The cargo owners thus made the\ndecision to select “K” Line as a single company for their\nthrough transportation needs, rather than contracting for\nrail services themselves. The through bills provided the\nliability and venue rules for the foreseeable event that the\ncargo was damaged during carriage. Indeed, the cargo\nowners obtained separate insurance to protect against any\nexcess loss. The forum-selection clause the parties agreed\nupon is “an indispensable element in international trade,\ncommerce, and contracting” because it allows parties to\n“agre[e] in advance on a forum acceptable” to them. The\nBremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407 U. S. 1, 13–14 (1972).\nA clause of this kind is enforced unless it imposes a venue\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“so gravely difficult and inconvenient that [the plaintiff]\nwill for all practical purposes be deprived of his day in\ncourt.” Id., at 18. The parties sensibly agreed that be\ncause their bills were governed by Japanese law, Tokyo\nwould be the best venue for any suit relating to the cargo.\n   The cargo owners’ contrary policy arguments are un\navailing. They assert that if Carmack does not apply, the\ninland segment of international shipments will be “un\nregulated.” Brief for Respondents 2, 21, 24, 64, 91. First,\nany speculation that not applying Carmack to inland\nsegments of overseas shipments will cause severe prob\nlems is refuted by that fact that Carmack even arguably\ndid not govern the inland portion of such shipments from\nits enactment in 1906 until its nonsubstantive recodifica\ntion in 1978. See supra, at 15–17. It is true that if the\ncargo owners’ position were to prevail, the terms of\nthrough bills of lading made in maritime commerce would\nbe more restricted in some circumstances. But that does\nnot mean that the Court’s holding leaves the field unregu\nlated. Ocean-based through bills are governed by COGSA,\nand ocean vessels like those operated by “K” Line are\noverseen by the Federal Maritime Commission. Supra, at\n4–5. Rail carriers like Union Pacific, furthermore, remain\nsubject to the STB’s regulation to the extent they operate\nwithin the United States. See supra, at 13–14. It is nota\nble that although the STB has jurisdiction to regulate the\nrates of such carriers, even when the carriage is not gov\nerned by the Carmack Amendment, STB has exercised its\nauthority to exempt from certain regulations service pro\nvided by a rail carrier “as part of a continuous intermodal\nfreight movement,” 49 CFR §1090.2 (2009), like the jour\nney at issue in these cases, see ibid. (exercising STB’s\nderegulation authority under 49 U. S. C. §10502(f)).\n   Finally, the cargo owners miss the mark in relying on\nthe recent United Nations Convention on Contracts for the\nInternational Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea,\n20   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich has yet to be “ratified by the President with the\nadvice and consent of the Senate.” Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 11. These so-called “Rotterdam Rules”\nwould explicitly allow the inland leg of an international\nshipment to be governed by a different legal regime than\nthe ocean leg, under some circumstances. See G. A. Res.\n63/122, art. 26, U. N. Doc. A/RES/63/122 (Dec. 11, 2008).\nNothing in the Rotterdam Rules, however, requires every\ncountry to mandate a different regime to govern the inland\nrail leg of an international through shipment; and, as ex\nplained above, Congress, by enacting COGSA, has opted for\nallowing shipments governed by a single through bill. And\nif the objection is that today’s decision will undermine the\nresults of these international negotiations in some way,\nthat concern is met by the fact that the United States\nGovernment has urged the result the Court adopts today.\nSee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13–29.\n   Congress has decided to allow parties engaged in inter\nnational maritime commerce to structure their contracts,\nto a large extent, as they see fit. It has not imposed Car\nmack’s regime, textually and historically limited to the\ncarriage of goods received for domestic rail transport, onto\nwhat are “essentially maritime” contracts. Kirby, 543\nU. S., at 24.\n                             V\n   “K” Line received the goods in China, under through\nbills for shipment into the United States. “K” Line was\nthus not a receiving rail carrier under Carmack and was\nnot required to issue bills of lading under that Amend\nment. Union Pacific is also not a receiving carrier for this\ncarriage and was thus not required to issue Carmack\ncompliant bills. Because the journey included no receiving\nrail carrier that had to issue bills of lading under Car\nmack, Carmack does not apply. The parties’ agreement to\nlitigate these cases in Tokyo is binding.

Unless they have\npermissibly contracted around Carmack’s requirements,\nrail carriers in the United States such as petitioner Union\nPacific are subject to those requirements, even though\nocean carriers such as petitioner “K” Line are not. To\navoid this simple conclusion, the Court contorts the stat­\nute and our cases, misreads the statutory history, and\nascribes to Congress a series of policy choices that Con­\ngress manifestly did not make. Because I believe Carmack\nprovides the default legal regime for rail transportation of\ncargo within the United States, regardless of whether the\nshipment originated abroad, I would reach the second\nquestion presented: whether Union Pacific was free to opt\n2   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nout of Carmack under 49 U. S. C. §10709, or whether\nUnion Pacific first had to offer “K” Line, its contractual\ncounterparty, Carmack-compliant terms under §10502.\nAs to that question, I would hold that opt-out under\n§10709 was not available and would remand to the Dis­\ntrict Court to consider in the first instance whether Union\nPacific satisfied its obligations under §10502. For these\nreasons, I respectfully dissent.\n                               I\n  The Court’s interpretation of Carmack’s scope is wrong\nas a matter of text, history, and policy.\n                              A\n                              1\n  I begin with the statute’s text. Two provisions guide my\nconclusion that Carmack provides the default legal regime\nfor the inland leg of a multimodal shipment traveling on\nan international through bill of lading: §11706(a), which\noutlines the basic requirements for liability under Car­\nmack, and §10501(a), which defines the jurisdiction of the\nSurface Transportation Board (STB or Board), the succes­\nsor to the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), see\nante, at 7. Section 11706(a) states as follows:\n      “A rail carrier providing transportation or service\n    subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part\n    shall issue a receipt or bill of lading for property it re­\n    ceives for transportation under this part. That rail\n    carrier and any other carrier that delivers the prop­\n    erty and is providing transportation or service subject\n    to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part are li­\n    able to the person entitled to recover under the receipt\n    or bill of lading. The liability imposed under this sub­\n    section is for the actual loss or injury to the property\n    caused by—\n      “(1) the receiving rail carrier;\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)              3\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n       “(2) the delivering rail carrier; or\n       “(3) another rail carrier over whose line or route the\n       property is transported in the United States or from\n       a place in the United States to a place in an adja­\n       cent foreign country when transported under a\n       through bill of lading.\n    “Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not af­\n    fect the liability of a rail carrier. A delivering rail car­\n    rier is deemed to be the rail carrier performing the\n    line-haul transportation nearest the destination but\n    does not include a rail carrier providing only a switch­\n    ing service at the destination.”\nWith respect to the Board’s jurisdiction, §10501(a) pro­\nvides as follows:\n       “(1) Subject to this chapter, the Board has jurisdic­\n    tion over transportation by rail carrier that is—\n            “(A) only by railroad; or\n            “(B) by railroad and water, when the transporta­\n         tion is under common control, management, or ar­\n         rangement for a continuous carriage or shipment.\n       “(2) Jurisdiction under paragraph (1) applies only to\n    transportation in the United States between a place\n    in—\n         “(A) a State and a place in the same or another\n       State as part of the interstate rail network;\n         .            .          .           .         .\n         “(E) the United States and another place in the\n       United States through a foreign country; or\n         “(F) the United States and a place in a foreign\n       country.”\n  “A simple, straight-forward reading of [these provisions]\npractically compels the conclusion that the Carmack\nAmendment applies in a typical multimodal carriage case\nwith inland damage.” Sturley, Maritime Cases About\nTrain Wrecks: Applying Maritime Law to the Inland\n4   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nDamage of Ocean Cargo, 40 J. Mar. L. & Com. 1, 13 (2009)\n(hereinafter Train Wrecks).          The first sentence of\n§11706(a) sets forth the circumstances in which a receiv­\ning rail carrier must issue a bill of lading: when property\nis first “receive[d]” for domestic transportation. This\nsentence does not define the full scope of Carmack liabil­\nity, however, as the penultimate sentence of §11706(a)\nmakes the absence of a bill of lading ultimately immate­\nrial to the question of Carmack liability. Instead, the\nsecond sentence of §11706(a) establishes Carmack’s ex­\npansive scope, explaining which carriers are subject to\nCarmack liability: not only the rail carrier that receives\nthe property, but also “any other carrier that delivers the\nproperty and is providing transportation or service subject\nto the jurisdiction of the Board under this part.” Criti­\ncally, that a rail carrier’s provision of “transportation or\nservice subject to the jurisdiction of the Board” is the\ncriterion that establishes liability under Carmack demon­\nstrates that Carmack’s scope must be considered in tan­\ndem with the provision describing the Board’s jurisdiction\nover rail carriage.\n   Under that provision, the Board has authority “over\ntransportation by rail carrier,” either when that transpor­\ntation is “only by railroad” or when it is “by railroad and\nwater, when the transportation is under common control,\nmanagement, or arrangement for a continuous carriage or\nshipment.” §10501(a)(1). Board jurisdiction over trans­\nportation by rail carrier “applies only to transportation in\nthe United States,” not to transportation abroad.\n§10501(a)(2). Within the United States, however, Board\njurisdiction exists broadly whenever that transportation is\n“between,” inter alia, “a place in . . . a State and a place in\nthe same or another State as part of the interstate rail\nnetwork,” “a place in . . . the United States and another\nplace in the United States through a foreign country,” or\n“a place in . . . the United States and a place in a foreign\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncountry.” §§10501(a)(2)(A), (E), (F).\n   With the jurisdictional framework in mind, I return to\nthe final sentences of Carmack, §11706. The third sen­\ntence clarifies that liability under Carmack is imposed\nupon (1) “the receiving rail carrier” (which, under the first\nsentence of §11706(a) and the definition of the Board’s\njurisdiction over domestic rail carriage in §10501(a), is the\nrail carrier that first receives the property for transporta­\ntion in the United States); (2) “the delivering rail carrier”\n(which, under the last sentence of §11706(a) and the\nBoard’s jurisdiction over domestic rail carriage in\n§10501(a), is the final rail carrier providing the long­\ndistance transportation “nearest the destination” in the\nUnited States); and (3) “another rail carrier over whose\nline or route the property is transported in the United\nStates or from a place in the United States to a place in an\nadjacent foreign country when transported under a\nthrough bill of lading.” §11706(a). This last phrase in\n§11706(a)(3) serves two functions. It ensures that, where\nthe entire rail transportation is “[with]in the United\nStates,” any connecting rail carrier between the point at\nwhich the goods were received and the point at which the\ngoods were delivered is liable under Carmack. It also\nensures that, where the final destination of the goods is in\nCanada or Mexico, such that there is no domestic “deliver­\ning” carrier, a connecting carrier taking on the goods in\nthe United States will remain subject to Carmack as it\ntravels toward its foreign destination while still in the\nUnited States. (As noted, the jurisdictional provision,\nincorporated by reference in §11706(a), is limited to\n“transportation in the United States,” §10501(a)(2).)\n   The language of Carmack thus announces an expansive\nintent to provide the liability regime for rail carriage of\nproperty within the United States. Once a first domestic\nrail carrier subject to the Board’s jurisdiction receives\nproperty in the United States, Carmack attaches, regard­\n6   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nless of where the property originated. Carmack then\napplies to any other rail carrier subject to the Board’s\njurisdiction in the chain of transportation, no matter\nwhether the ultimate destination of the property is in the\nUnited States or elsewhere, for the period the carrier is\ntraveling within the United States.\n    It seems to me plain that, under these broadly inclusive\nprovisions, Carmack governs rail carriers such as Union\nPacific for any transportation of cargo within the United\nStates, whether or not their domestic transportation is\npart of a multimodal international shipment, and whether\nor not they actually issued a domestic bill of lading. There\nis no question that Union Pacific is a “rail carrier” that is\n“subject to the jurisdiction of the Board.” §11706(a). It\n“receive[d]” the cargo, ibid., in California for domestic\ntransportation to four different domestic inland loca­\ntions—i.e., “between a place in . . . a State and a place in\n. . . another State,” §10501(a)(2)(A)—while the shipment\nitself was transported “between a place in . . . the United\nStates and a place in a foreign country,” §10501(a)(2)(F).\nUnion Pacific should have issued a bill of lading for the\ncargo it received, but its failure to do so does not shield it\nfrom liability, as §11706(a) makes clear. Carmack there­\nfore provides the legal regime governing Union Pacific’s\nrail transportation in these cases.\n    Carmack does not, however, govern ocean carriers such\nas “K” Line, because such carriers are not “rail carrier[s]\nproviding transportation or service subject to the jurisdic­\ntion of the Board.” §11706(a). The ICA defines a “rail\ncarrier” as “a person providing common carrier railroad\ntransportation for compensation.” §10102(5). To resolve\nwhether “K” Line meets this definition, I would apply the\nSTB’s well established test and ask whether it “conduct[s]\nrail operations” and “ ‘hold[s] out’ that service to the pub­\nlic.” Assoc. of P&C Dock Longshoremen v.

Brief for Respondents 82–83 (noting that the\nstatutory definition of “railroad” includes “ ‘intermodal\nequipment used by or in connection with a railroad,’ ”\n§10102(6)(A)). This interpretation goes too far. Read so\nliterally, the statute would render a truck a railroad sim­\nply because the truck transported containers during a\njourney in which the containers also traveled by rail.\nSuch a reading would gut the separate provisions of the\nICA governing motor carriage in subtitle IV, part B of\nTitle 49. The ICA’s broad description of what the term\n“railroad” “includes,” §10102(6), is better read as ensuring\nthat all services a rail carrier conducts are regulated\nunder the Act “to prevent overcharges and discriminations\nfrom being made under the pretext of performing such\nadditional services.” Cleveland, C., C. & St. L. R. Co. v.\nDettlebach, 239 U. S. 588, 594 (1916).\n   At oral argument, respondents focused on a separate\nargument, contending that “K” Line should be considered\na rail carrier because it conducts substantial rail opera­\ntions at its depot facility in Long Beach, California. Tr. of\nOral Arg. 37 (describing transportation between Port of\nLos Angeles, where “K” Line’s private chassis transport\nthe containers on the Port’s train tracks to the Los Ange­\nles train depot, where the containers are loaded onto\nUnion Pacific trains for inland transportation). I agree\nwith the Board, however, that “ ‘ownership and operation\nof private terminal facilities, including rail yards,’ ” is not\nsufficient to bring a shipper within the definition of “ ‘a rail\ncarrier subject to [Board] jurisdiction’ ” where the “ ‘termi­\nnal is maintained for [the ocean common carrier’s] exclu­\n8      KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v.

C. §40101 et seq., confirm my\nview that “K” Line is not a rail carrier “subject to the\njurisdiction of the Board,” 49 U. S. C. §11706(a), under\nCarmack. The STB’s jurisdiction over transportation by\nrail carriers is “exclusive,” §10501(b), while ocean carriers\nare subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Maritime\nCommission (FMC), 46 U. S. C. §40102; see also 46 CFR\n§520.1 (2009). In addition, the Board’s jurisdiction over\nwater carriage is limited to domestic water carriage. 49\nU. S. C. §13521(a)(3). The Board itself has concluded that\nocean carriers providing intermodal transportation jointly\nwith inland rail and motor carriers are subject to the\nFMC’s jurisdiction rather than its own. See Improvement\nof TOFC/COFC Regulations, 3 I. C. C. 2d 869, 883 (1987).\n   For these reasons, Carmack governs Union Pacific but\nnot “K” Line for the inland transportation at issue in these\ncases.\n                              2\n   In finding Carmack inapplicable to the inland transpor­\ntation in these cases, the majority relies on the fact that\nCarmack does not govern ocean carriers such as “K” Line.\nWhile I agree that “K” Line is not a rail carrier, the major­\nity places too much weight on that determination.

There is simply no basis in the\ntext of the statute to support the majority’s conclusion\nthat Carmack applies only when the first rail carrier in\nthe chain of transportation accepted the cargo at the\nshipment’s point of origin. Cf. ante, at 10, 12. The two\ncases the majority cites for this proposition are inapposite,\nas neither addresses an international, multimodal ship­\nment in which the first leg of the trip was by ocean.2 In\nSt. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Starbird, 243 U. S. 592, 594\n(1917), the entire shipment was by rail from Arkansas to\nNew York City. And in Mexican Light & Power Co. v.\nTexas Mexican R. Co., 331 U. S. 731, 732 (1947), the entire\nshipment was by rail from Pennsylvania to Mexico. Given\nthat the first rail carrier was in each case the carrier that\nreceived the goods from the shipper and issued a through\nbill of lading, it is unsurprising that the Court, applying\nCarmack, described that carrier as the “initial carrier.”\n243 U. S., at 595; 331 U. S., at 733. But nothing in these\ncases, and nothing in Carmack itself, requires that the\n“receiving carrier” take the goods from the shipper at the\nshipment’s point of origin.3\n  Instead, these cases are compatible with my view that\nthe “receiving carrier” is any rail carrier that first receives\ncargo for transportation in the United States. Union\n——————\n  2 The additional cases the United States cites for this proposition\n\nsuffer from this same flaw. See Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 27–28; Tr. of Oral Arg. 20.\n  3 Carmack’s venue provision refers to the “receiving rail carrier” as\n\nthe “originating rail carrier” and states that the proper venue for a\nlawsuit against this carrier is “the judicial district in which the point of\norigin is located.” §11706(d)(2)(A)(i). Especially because the focus of\nCarmack is on transportation by rail, the phrase “point of origin” in this\ncontext is best read as referring to the point of origin of the “originating\nrail carrier[’s]” transportation, not the point of origin of the shipment.\n10   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nPacific, which is unquestionably a “rail carrier” in the\nnormal sense of those words, is also the “receiving carrier”\nsubject to liability under Carmack.4 Our opinion in Reider\nv. Thompson, 339 U. S. 113 (1950), further supports this\nreading. There we explained that the test for Carmack\napplicability “is not where the shipment originated, but\nwhere the obligation of the carrier as receiving carrier\noriginated.” Id., at 117. Because Carmack applies to\ndomestic rail transport, and the domestic rail carrier’s\nobligation in that case arose in New Orleans where the\nrail carrier received the goods, it did not matter that the\nshipment began overseas in Buenos Aires. Similarly, in\nthe instant cases, because Union Pacific’s obligations to\ntransport by rail originated in California, it does not mat­\nter that the shipment began overseas in China.5\n  Second, the majority errs in suggesting that the issu­\nance of an international through bill of lading precludes\nthe applicability of Carmack. Cf. ante, at 10–11, 13. The\n——————\n  4 The  majority suggests that respondents “conceded” at oral argument\nthat Union Pacific was not a receiving carrier but only a delivering\ncarrier. Ante, at 13. Of course, this Court is not bound by a party’s\nconcession in our interpretation of a statute. See, e.g., Massachusetts v.\nUnited States, 333 U. S. 611, 624–625 (1948).\n   5 Contrary to Union Pacific’s suggestion, Brief for Petitioner in 08–\n\n1554, p. 33, its obligations did not originate in China. “K” Line’s bills of\nlading, issued in China, “entitled [“K” Line] to sub-contract on any\nterms . . . all duties whatsoever undertaken,” App. 145, and therefore\ndid not create any obligation on the part of Union Pacific in China. In\nturn, the agreement between “K” Line and Union Pacific—which “K”\nLine made “by and through its duly authorized agent and representa­\ntive in the United States, ‘K’ Line AMERICA, Inc. . . ., a Michigan\ncorporation,” id., at 120—was a multiyear contract committing “K” Line\nto “tender to [Union Pacific] not less than 95% of its Container traffic,”\nibid., but did not actually commit “K” Line to deliver any particular\npiece of cargo to Union Pacific. As “K” Line explains, then, “the Agree­\nment [with Union Pacific] was a ‘requirements’ contract, which did not\nbecome effective as to any particular container until ‘K’ Line delivered\nit” to Union Pacific in California.

In Reider, the Court found Carmack applica­\nble when the first domestic rail carrier issued a bill of\nlading from New Orleans to Boston. Although we ob­\nserved in that opinion that there was no through bill of\nlading from Buenos Aires to Boston, 339 U. S., at 117, we\ndid not say, and it is not a necessary corollary, that the\npresence of such a bill of lading would have commanded a\ndifferent result. The observation is better read as indicat­\ning that no law other than Carmack could possibly have\napplied in that case: Because “the shipment . . . could not\nhave moved an inch beyond New Orleans under the ocean\nbill,” id., at 118, a new domestic bill of lading for domestic\ntransportation was required, and as to that transporta­\ntion, we held, Carmack unquestionably applied.\n   For its part, Mexican Light held only that, where the\nfirst rail carrier in the chain of transportation issued a bill\nof lading, a subsequent bill of lading issued by a later rail\ncarrier was void because Carmack contemplates one\nthrough bill of lading governing the entire journey by rail.\n331 U. S., at 734. A subsequent bill of lading by a connect­\ning rail carrier, however, can be void under Carmack\nwithout requiring the conclusion that an international\nthrough bill of lading involving initial transportation by\nocean carrier would void a subsequent bill of lading issued\nin the United States by the first rail carrier in the domes­\ntic chain of transportation. Because the text of Carmack\nexpressly requires a bill of lading to be issued for property\n“receive[d] for transportation under this part,” and Union\nPacific first received the property for rail transportation in\nthe United States, it should have issued a bill of lading.\nOf course, its failure to do so did not affect its liability\nunder Carmack (or that of a subsequent connecting or\ndelivering carrier), as §11706(a) explicitly states.\n   Third, the majority errs in giving weight to the differ­\nence in scope between Carmack liability and the jurisdic­\n12   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ntion of the Board. Ante, at 14. I agree with the majority\nthat Carmack’s reach is narrower than the Board’s juris­\ndiction. The Board’s jurisdiction extends over transporta­\ntion by rail carrier “in the United States between a place\nin . . . the United States and a place in a foreign country,”\n§10501(a)(2)(F), which indicates that it does not matter\nwhether the movement of the transportation is from the\nUnited States to the foreign country or from the foreign\ncountry to the United States.6 In contrast, Carmack ap­\nplies only when a rail carrier first receives property in the\nUnited States, §11706(a), and therefore would not apply to\na rail carrier originating in Canada and delivering in the\nUnited States without transferring the property to a\ndomestic rail carrier.7 As long as there is a receiving rail\ncarrier in the United States, however, Carmack attaches.\nBecause the property at issue in these cases was received\nin the United States for domestic transportation by Union\nPacific, Carmack governs the rail carrier’s liability.\n   Finally, the majority misunderstands the role I believe\nCarmack liability plays in international shipments to the\nUnited States. My reading of the statute would not “out­\nlaw through shipments under a single bill of lading.”\n——————\n   6 The ICA’s jurisdictional provision uses the term “foreign country” to\n\ndescribe the Board’s jurisdiction, §10501(a)(2)(F), while Carmack uses\nthe term “adjacent foreign country” to describe the liability of connect­\ning carriers, §11706(a)(3). I find the difference between these terms to\nbe of no moment. Section 10501 describes the Board’s jurisdiction over\nrail carriers, and it is impossible to have connecting rail lines between\nthe United States and a foreign country that is not adjacent. This\nreading is confirmed by §10501(a)(2)(E), which refers to the Board’s\njurisdiction over transportation by railroad “in the United States\nbetween a place in . . . the United States and another place in the\nUnited States and a foreign country.” No rail transportation between\ntwo places in the United States that is interrupted by rail transporta­\ntion through a foreign country could be through a foreign country that\nis anything but adjacent.\n   7 This situation is consistent with historical agreements between the\n\nICC and its Canadian counterpart. See infra, at 14–15.\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    13\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nAnte, at 13. To the contrary, an overseas ocean carrier\nlike “K” Line can still issue a through bill of lading govern­\ning the entire international trip to an American destina­\ntion. That bill of lading reflects the ocean carrier’s agree­\nment with and obligations to the original shipper of the\ncargo. As the ocean carrier has no independent Carmack\nobligations of its own, the ocean carrier and the shipper\nare free to select whatever liability terms they wish to\ngovern their relationship during the entire shipment. See\ninfra, at 20–21. Carmack simply requires an American\n“receiving rail carrier” like Union Pacific to issue a bill of\nlading to the party from whom it received the goods for\nshipment—here, “K” Line. See Norfolk Southern R. Co. v.\nJames N. Kirby, Pty Ltd., 543 U. S. 14, 33 (2004) (“When\nan intermediary contracts with a carrier to transport\ngoods, the cargo owner’s recovery against the carrier is\nlimited by the liability limitation to which the intermedi­\nary and carrier agreed”); Great Northern R. Co. v.\nO’Connor, 232 U. S. 508, 514–515 (1914) (holding that a\nrailroad company is entitled to treat the intermediary\nforwarder as the shipper). As to that bill of lading, Car­\nmack provides the legal regime and defines the relation­\nship between the contracting parties (unless they have\nagreed to contract out of Carmack, see infra, at 23–26).\nThe issuance of this second bill of lading, however, in no\nway undermines the efficiency of the through bill of lading\nbetween the ocean carrier and the original shipper, nor\ndoes it require that those parties bind themselves to apply\nCarmack to the inland leg.8\n——————\n  8 The majority seems to find it troubling that my view “would require\n\ntwo bills of lading.” Ante, at 13. But international shipments fre­\nquently contain more than one bill of lading. See, e.g., Kirby, 543 U. S.,\nat 30–33 (interpreting the parties’ obligations under two bills of lading,\none between a shipper and a freight forwarding company to which the\nshipper originally delivered its goods, and one between the freight\nforwarding company and the ocean carrier to which the freight for­\n14   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v.

The Court states\nthat no version of Carmack has ever applied to imports\noriginating overseas on a through bill of lading. Ante, at\n15. The Court further asserts that, because Congress\nstated that the 1978 recodification of the ICA effected no\n“substantive change,” Carmack should be read consis­\ntently with this historical practice. Ante, at 16. There are\nthree problems with this analysis.\n   First, if “Congress intended no substantive change” to\nCarmack in the 1978 recodification, “that would mean only\nthat the present text is the best evidence of what the law\nhas always meant, and that the language of the prior\nversion cannot be relied upon to support a different read­\ning.” Keene Corp. v. United States, 508 U. S. 200, 221\n(1993) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Because the present text\nof Carmack indicates that it applies to the domestic inland\nrail transportation of a multimodal international ship­\nment, there is no reason to rely on Congress’ statement in\nthe recodification.\n   Second, there is no necessary conflict between the pre­\n——————\nwarder delivered the shipper’s goods). The majority also suggests that\nan original shipper might not be able to sue Union Pacific under the\nterms of Union Pacific’s bill with “K” Line. Ante, at 13. In Kirby,\nhowever, we took as a given that the shipper could sue the inland rail\ncarrier, even though the shipper was not a party to the rail carrier’s bill\nof lading with an intermediary. Indeed, we held that in an action\nagainst the rail carrier, the shipper was bound to the terms of the bill of\nlading governing the rail carrier’s transportation, even though those\nterms were less generous than the terms in the shipper’s through bill of\nlading with the freight forwarder with which it originally contracted.\n543 U. S., at 33–34. We observed that the shipper could sue the freight\nforwarder to recover the difference. Id., at 35. In light of this analysis,\nI see no reason to doubt a shipper’s ability to sue an American rail\ncarrier under Carmack, even though its bill of lading with an overseas\nocean carrier is not governed by Carmack.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

The pre-1978 text referred to a carrier “receiving\nproperty for transportation from a point in one State or\nTerritory or the District of Columbia to a point in another\nState, Territory, [or the] District of Columbia, or from any\npoint in the United States to a point in an adjacent foreign\ncountry.” 49 U. S. C. §20(11) (1976).9 A rail carrier like\nUnion Pacific who receives property in California for\ntransportation to locations in the American midwest “re­\nceiv[es] property from a point in one State . . . to a point in\nanother State,” regardless of whether the property origi­\nnated in California or China. The geographical restriction\n“from any point in the United States to a point in an adja­\ncent foreign country” simply reflected agreements between\nthe ICC and its Canadian counterpart to respect each\nother’s regulation of rail carriage originating in that coun­\ntry. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae (herein­\nafter Brief for United States) 17–18. It does not indicate\nany rejection of Carmack’s applicability to imports as a\nwhole or exports to a nonadjacent foreign country.10 In­\n——————\n  9 The  pre-1978 version of Carmack referred generally to a “carrier,”\nrather than a “rail carrier.” It was not until 1995 that Congress distin­\nguished between Carmack’s applicability to rail carriers, §11706, and\nmotor carriers, freight forwarders, and domestic water carriers, §14706.\nPub. L. No. 104–88, §102(a), 109 Stat. 803, 847–849, 907–910.\n   10 The Court ignores a further reason to believe that prior to 1978,\n\nCarmack could be understood to apply to imports as well as exports.\nEven assuming (contrary to my view) that the relevant language in\nCarmack governing any international commercial exchange was the\nphrase “from any point in the United States to a point in an adjacent\nforeign country,” the seemingly uni-directional “from . . . to” could\nreasonably have been interpreted as also encompassing “to . . . from” in\nlight of our decision in Galveston, H. & S. A. R. Co. v. Woodbury, 254\nU. S. 357 (1920). In that case, this Court interpreted similar “from . . .\nto” language in the jurisdictional section of the ICA as conferring\njurisdiction on the ICC over all transportation between such countries.\nId., at 359–360 (construing “ ‘transportation . . . from any place in the\nUnited States to an adjacent foreign country’ ” in former 49 U.

As we have often\nobserved, “[a] specific provision controls one of more gen­\neral application.” Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U. S.\n395, 407 (1991). The general statement that Congress\nintended no change to the ICA should not require us to\nignore what the current text of the specific Carmack pro­\nvision says, as both Union Pacific and “K” Line explicitly\nask us to do. See Brief for Petitioner in No. 08–1554, at 20\n(“The Pre-1978 Statutory Language Controls This Case”);\nBrief for Petitioners in No. 08–1553, at 41–49 (arguing for\nreliance on pre-1978 text). Petitioners’ view of statutory\ninterpretation would give rise to an unwieldy—and un­\njust—system. I would have thought it beyond cavil that\nlitigants are entitled to rely on the currently applicable\nversion of enacted statutes to determine their rights and\nobligations.\n   In the final analysis, the meaning of the pre-1978 lan­\n——————\nto include “transportation . . . from that country to the United States”).\nGiven the “presumption that a given term is used to mean the same\nthing throughout a statute,” Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S. 115, 118\n(1994) (citing Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers, Inc. v. United States, 286 U. S.\n427 (1932)), our construction of “from . . . to” in the ICA’s jurisdictional\nprovision could reasonably have been read to sweep imports within the\nscope of Carmack. I would not, however, read “from . . . to” in the\ncurrent version of §11706(a)(3) to encompass “to . . . from,” as Congress\nspecifically amended the similar language in the jurisdictional provi­\nsion at §10501(a)(2) to “between” while leaving intact the “to . . . from”\nin Carmack, against the background of Woodbury.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

The current text does not restrict\nCarmack’s coverage to trade with adjacent foreign coun­\ntries, and it makes no distinction between imports and\nexports. Carmack’s ambiguous history cannot justify\nreading such atextual limitations into the statute.11\n                           C\n  The Court’s suggestion that its interpretation properly\neffectuates the goals of Carmack and “attains the most\n——————\n   11 The United States, as amicus in support of “K” Line and Union\n\nPacific, makes an effort to find such limitations in the current statutory\ntext.

The United States observes that\n§11706(a)(3) describes the liability of “another rail carrier over whose\nline or route the property is transported in the United States or from a\nplace in the United States to a place in an adjacent foreign country\nwhen transported under a through bill of lading.” (Emphasis added.)\nAccording to the United States, “[t]hat textual limitation, when read in\nlight of Carmack’s purpose, reflects Congress’s continued intent to\nrestrict Carmack to the carriage of goods between places in the United\nStates and for export to an adjacent foreign country.” Brief for United\nStates 21. As I have already explained, however, once a domestic rail\ncarrier first receives property for transportation within the United\nStates, regardless of where the property itself originated, Carmack\napplies. Supra, at 3–6. Section 11706(a)(3) simply ensures that when a\nconnecting carrier that neither received the property in the United\nStates nor delivered it in the United States transports the property\nfrom the United States to either Canada or Mexico, that connecting\ncarrier remains subject to Carmack liability during the part of the\ntransportation that is in the United States. Further, as I explain\nbelow, see infra, at 18–20, Carmack’s purpose would be better effectu­\nated by applying its provisions inland as the default rule. In any event,\nthe “adjacent foreign country” provision in §11706(a)(3) has no bearing\non the rail transportation provided in these cases by Union Pacific as\n“receiving rail carrier,” §11706(a), from California to four locations in\nthe American midwest.

As the mandatory default regime governing the\nrelationship between an American receiving rail carrier\nand its direct contracting partner (here an overseas ocean\ncarrier), Carmack permits the shippers who contract for a\nthrough bill of lading with the ocean carrier to receive the\nbenefit of Carmack through that once-removed relation­\nship. Such a legal regime is entirely consistent with\nCOGSA and industry practice.\n   As noted, the Court’s position as to Carmack rests on its\nerroneous belief that the “receiving carrier” must receive\nthe goods at the point of the shipment’s origin. Ante, at\n12–15. Because Carmack provides that suit against the\nreceiving rail carrier “may only be brought . . . in the\njudicial district in which the point of origin is located,” 49\nU. S. C. §11706(d)(2)(A)(i), and defines “judicial district” as\nonly a federal or state court, §11706(d)(2)(B), the Court\nmistakenly concludes that were Carmack to apply to\ninland transportation of international shipments, “there\nwould often be no venue in which to sue the receiving\ncarrier” because that carrier would have received the\ngoods in a foreign country where no federal or state court\nexists. Ante, at 14–15, 17. Contrary to the Court’s sugges­\ntion, however, the proper venue in which to sue a receiving\ncarrier under Carmack is the location in which the first\ndomestic rail carrier received the goods for domestic\ntransportation. Supra, at 4–5, 9.\n   Nor is it true that Carmack’s focus is on providing a\nsingle through bill of lading for an entire shipment. Ante,\nat 17. Carmack’s purpose in §11706 is to ensure that a\nsingle bill of lading, with a single protective liability re­\ngime, governs an entire shipment by rail carrier within\n                    Cite as: 561 U.

It does not place obligations on the relationship\nbetween any overseas carrier and any overseas shipper\nwho operate under their own bill of lading. That Congress\nexpected different liability regimes to govern ocean and\nrail carriers can be inferred from the different regulatory\noversight provided for each type of carrier—the FMC for\nthe former, the STB for the latter, see supra, at 8.\n   Moreover, that Carmack provides certain greater pro­\ntections than does COGSA demonstrates that one of Car­\nmack’s purposes—beyond simply the fact of a single bill of\nlading governing all rail transportation—was to specify a\nprotective liability regime for that part of the shipment\nonly. As compared to COGSA, Carmack provides height­\nened liability rules for rail transportation, compare\nCOGSA §4, 49 Stat. 1207, note following 46 U. S. C.\n§30701, p. 1179, with 49 U. S. C. §§11706(a)–(c); stricter\nvenue requirements, compare Vimar Seguros y Reasegu\nros, S. A. v. M/V Sky Reefer, 515 U. S. 528, 535 (1995),\nwith §11706(d); and more generous time allowances for\nfiling suit, compare COGSA §3(6), at 1179, with §11706(e).\nCongress is evidently wary of creating broad exemptions\nfrom Carmack’s regime: While Congress has given expan­\nsive authority to the STB to deregulate carriers from the\nrequirements of the ICA, it has precluded the STB from\nexcusing carriers from complying with Carmack. See\ninfra, at 25 (discussing §10502). By taking Carmack’s\nprotections out of the picture for goods that travel by rail\nin the United States whenever the goods first traveled by\nocean liner, it is the Court that “undermine[s] Carmack’s\npurposes,” ante, at 17.

REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ning Carmack to domestic rail transportation of goods, even\nwhere the goods originated overseas, in order to avoid\n“immuniz[ing] from the beneficial provisions of the [Car­\nmack] Amendment all shipments originating in a foreign\ncountry when reshipped via the very transportation chain\nwith which the Amendment was most concerned”).\n   The Court’s suggestion that its interpretation best\ncomports with the goals of COGSA fares no better. The\nCourt is correct, ante, at 8, that Congress has permitted\nparties contractually to extend COGSA, which, by its own\nterms, applies only to the period “from the time when the\ngoods are loaded on to the time when they are discharged\nfrom the ship.” §§1(e), 7, at 1178, 1180. But the Court\nignores that COGSA specifically contemplates that there\nmay be “other law” that mandatorily governs the inland\nleg, and makes clear that contractual extension of COGSA\ndoes not trump this law. §12, at 1180 (“Nothing in\n[COGSA] shall be construed as superseding . . . any . . .\nother law which would be applicable in the absence of\n[COGSA], insofar as they relate to the duties, responsibili­\nties, and liabilities of the ship or carrier prior to the time\nwhen the goods are loaded on or after the time they are\ndischarged from the ship”); see also Sturley, Freedom of\nContract and the Ironic Story of Section 7 of the Carriage\nof Goods by Sea Act, 4 Benedict’s Mar. Bull. 201, 202\n(2006) (“It is highly ironic to suggest that section 7 was\nintended to facilitate the extension of COGSA [inland].\nThe unambiguous history demonstrates that section 7 was\nspecifically designed to accomplish exactly the opposite\nresult”). Notably, when it wants to do so, Congress knows\nhow to specify that a contractual extension of COGSA\nsupersedes other law: COGSA elsewhere defines a limited\ncircumstance—the carriage of goods by sea between ports\nof the United States—in which a contractual extension of\nCOGSA has the force of law. §13, at 1180 (providing that\nsuch bills of lading “shall be subjected hereto as fully as if\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Even under the\nCourt’s interpretation, two sets of rules may govern, be­\ncause the parties need not extend COGSA to the inland\nleg—they may agree on any terms they choose to cover\nthat transportation. §7, at 1180 (permitting the parties to\n“ente[r] into any agreement . . . as to the responsibility and\nliability of the carrier or the ship” for the period before the\ngoods are loaded on and after they are discharged from the\nship (emphasis added)); see also Train Wrecks 23\n(“[C]arriers regularly include clauses in their bills of lad­\ning to limit their liability [for inland travel] in ways that\nCOGSA prohibits”); 1 T. Schoenbaum, Admiralty and\nMaritime Law §10–4, p. 599–600 (4th ed. 2004) (describing\ntypical non-COGSA liability rules parties select for the\ninland leg). In these cases, for example, “K” Line’s bills of\nlading include certain terms governing the inland leg that\ndiffer from the terms governing the ocean carriage. See,\ne.g., App. 147 (providing different time frames within\nwhich suit must be brought depending on whether the\nactionable conduct “occurred during other than Water\nCarriage”).\n   The Court relies heavily on Kirby as identifying the\nrelevant policy consideration in these cases, but it takes\n\n——————\n  13 Nor would my interpretation of the statute necessarily require that\ntwo different regimes apply to each shipment, given the parties’ ability\nto contract around Carmack as long as they follow appropriate proce­\ndures, infra, at 25–27, and, if they so choose, select COGSA terms.\n22   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v.

In that case, we were con­\ncerned about displacing a single federal law, COGSA, with\n50 varying state liability regimes.14 543 U. S., at 28–29.\nThe rule the Court establishes today creates even greater\npractical difficulties than the regime we criticized in Kirby\nby displacing Carmack with as many liability rules as\nthere are bills of lading. It would even permit different\nliability rules to apply to different lawsuits arising out of\nthe same inland accident depending on where each piece\nof cargo originated. Contrary to the Court’s view, then,\nthe value of uniformity articulated in Kirby is best pro­\nmoted by application of Carmack to the obligations of the\nrail carrier during the inland leg in these cases. Cf. ante,\nat 7–8, 17–18.\n   Finally, while purporting to effectuate the contractual\nchoices of the parties in the international multimodal\nshipping industry, ante, at 17–20, the Court ignores the\nrealities of the industry’s operation. The industry has long\nbeen accustomed to drafting bills of lading that encompass\ntwo legal regimes, one governing ocean transportation and\nanother governing inland transportation, given mandatory\nlaw governing road and rail carriage in most of Europe\nand in certain countries in Asia and North Africa.

I\nwould hold that where, as here, the STB has exempted rail\ncarriers from Part A of the ICA pursuant to its authority\nas set forth in 49 U. S. C. §10502, such rail carriers may\nnot use §10709 to opt out of Carmack entirely. Instead,\nsuch rail carriers must first offer their contractual coun­\nterparties Carmack-compliant terms for liability and\nclaims, as §10502(e) requires. Having reached that con­\nclusion, I would remand for consideration of whether the\nrequirements of §10502(e) were met in these cases. I set\nforth these views only briefly, as the Court’s determina­\ntion that Carmack does not apply at all makes resolution\nof these questions moot.\n                           A\n  In the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, Pub.

Consistent with these goals, 49 U. S. C.\n§§10502 and 10709 provide two options for contracting\naround the requirements of the ICA.\n   Section 10502(a) provides that when certain conditions\nare met, the Board “shall exempt,” “to the maximum\nextent consistent with this part,” “a person, class of per­\nsons, or a transaction or service” from either a particular\nprovision of Part A of the ICA or the entirety of that Part.\nSection 10502(f) specifies that “[t]he Board may exercise\nits authority under this section to exempt transportation\nthat is provided by a rail carrier as part of a continuous\nintermodal movement.” Acting pursuant to this authority,\nthe Board has broadly exempted such transportation\n“from the requirements of [the ICA].” 49 CFR §1090.2\n(2009). The authority to issue broad exemptions, however,\nis not unlimited. Under 49 U. S. C. §10502(e), “[n]o ex­\nemption order issued pursuant to this section shall oper­\nate to relieve any rail carrier from an obligation to provide\ncontractual terms for liability and claims which are consis­\ntent with the provisions of [Carmack],” although, at the\nsame time, “[n]othing . . . shall prevent rail carriers from\noffering alternative terms.” Section 10502(g) further\nlimits the Board from exempting rail carriers from their\nobligations to comply with certain employee protections\nunder Part A of the ICA.\n   In turn, under §10709(a), “[o]ne or more rail carriers\nproviding transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the\nBoard . . . may enter into a contract with one or more\npurchasers of rail services to provide specified services\nunder specified rates and conditions.” Having signed such\na contract, a rail carrier “shall have no duty in connection\nwith services provided under such contract other than\n26   KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD. v. REGAL-BELOIT CORP.\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthose duties specified by the terms of the contract.”\n§10709(b). Once such a contract is made, that contract,\n“and transportation under such contract, shall not be\nsubject to this part, and may not be subsequently chal­\nlenged before the Board or in any court on the grounds\nthat such contract violates a provision of [Part A of the\nICA].” §10709(c)(1).\n   According to Union Pacific, §10502(e) limits only the\nBoard’s exemption ability; it does not place any affirma­\ntive obligation on rail carriers to offer Carmack-compliant\nterms. Rail carriers, Union Pacific contends, may opt out\nof Carmack entirely simply by entering into a contract\nunder §10709, thus escaping any duty imposed by Part A\nof the ICA. I disagree. I am persuaded by the Govern­\nment’s view that because the Board’s order in 49 CFR\n§1090.2 exempted intermodal rail transportation from all\nof Part A of the ICA, which includes 49 U. S. C. §10709,\n“Union Pacific could not properly enter into a contract\nunder Section 10709 to relieve it of its obligations under\nSection 10502(e).” Brief for United States 31. Those\nobligations require “a rail carrier providing exempt trans­\nportation [to] offer the shipper the option of contractual\nterms for liability and claims consistent with Carmack,\npresumably at a higher rate,” and they permit such a rail\ncarrier to “enter into a contract with different terms only if\nthe shipper does not select that option.” Id., at 30.\n   Observing that the Board’s exemption order relieves\nintermodal rail transportation from the “requirements” of\nPart A, Union Pacific contends that §10709 is not a re­\nquirement but a privilege and therefore is not included\nwithin the exemption. In clarifying its order, however, the\nBoard has described the exemption as one from “regula­\ntion” under the ICA or “application” of that Act. See, e.g.,\nImprovement of TOFC/COFC Regulations, 3 I. C. C. 2d, at\n869–870. Especially in light of this clarification, there\nseems little reason to ascribe significance to the Board’s\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           27\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nuse of the word “requirements,” instead of the statutory\nterm “provision,” in the exemption order.\n   The Government aptly describes the policy concerns\nthat justify this reading of the interplay between §§10502\nand 10709. Brief for United States 31–32. Because a rail\ncarrier’s counterparty to a §10709 contract can ordinarily\nrequire a rail carrier to comply with common carriage\nrates and terms under Part A (including Carmack), such\ncounterparties possess considerable bargaining power.\nBut rail carriers the Board has exempted from Part A\nunder §10502 lack any obligation to comply with that\nPart. If exempt carriers could escape Carmack’s obliga­\ntions under §10709, their counterparties would be at a\nsignificant disadvantage as compared to counterparties to\ncontracts with nonexempt carriers. Such a disadvantage\ncannot be squared with Congress’ evident intent, as ex­\npressed in §10502(e), to ensure that no carrier may be\nautomatically exempted from Carmack.\n   This interpretation of §§10502 and 10709 imposes no\nunfairness on exempt rail carriers. As the Court of Ap­\npeals explained, “carriers providing exempt transportation\ngain the benefits of deregulation, but lose the opportunity\nto contract for preferable terms under §10709 without first\noffering Carmack terms.” 557 F. 3d 985, 1002 (CA9 2009).\nGiven rail carriers’ ability to charge higher rates for full\nCarmack coverage, see New York, N. H. & H. R. Co. v.\nNothnagle, 346 U. S. 128, 135 (1953), and the likelihood\nthat some counterparties will agree to reject Carmack­\ncompliant terms in favor of a lower price, such a trade-off\nmakes eminent sense.\n                             B\n   Whether Union Pacific properly contracted out of Car­\nmack under §10502(e) requires a factual determination\nbetter suited for resolution by the District Court in the\nfirst instance.

Union Pacific\nalso raises a related legal argument not decided by the\ncourts below: that the forum selection clause at issue in\nthese cases is valid because venue is not encompassed\nwithin the phrase “contractual terms for liability and\nclaims” in §10502(e). To the extent this argument is not\nwaived, it would also be properly considered on remand.\n                         *      *     *\n  In endorsing a strained reading of the text, history, and\npurpose of Carmack, the Court is evidently concerned with\na perceived need to enforce the COGSA-based contracts\nthat the “sophisticated cargo owners” here made with “K”\nLine. Ante, at 18. But these cases do not require the\nCourt to interpret or examine the contract between the\ncargo owners and “K” Line. The Court need consider only\nthe legal relationship between Union Pacific and “K” Line\nas its direct contracting party. As to that relationship, it\nbears emphasizing that industry actors on all sides are\nsophisticated and can easily adapt to a regime in which\nCarmack provides the default rule governing the rail\ncarrier’s liability during the inland leg of a multimodal\nshipment traveling on an international through bill of\nlading. See, e.g., Train Wrecks 40 (describing how ocean\nand rail carriers have drafted their contracts to account\nfor—and permissibly escape—Carmack’s applicability); cf.\nKirby, 543 U. S., at 36 (recognizing that “our decision does\nno more than provide a legal backdrop against which\nfuture bills of lading will be negotiated”). In disregarding\nCongress’ commands in both Carmack and COGSA and in\ndiscounting the practical realities reflected in the Rotter­\ndam Rules and other international conventions governing\nthe carriage of goods, the Court ignores what we acknowl­\nedged in Kirby: “It is not . . . this Court’s task to structure\nthe international shipping industry.” Ibid.
