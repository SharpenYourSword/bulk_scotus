Argued March 29, 2010—Decided June 24, 2010\nIn 1998, respondent National Australia Bank (National), a foreign bank\n  whose “ordinary shares” are not traded on any exchange in this coun\n  try, purchased respondent HomeSide Lending, a company headquar\n  tered in Florida that was in the business of servicing mortgages—\n  seeing to collection of the monthly payments, etc. In 2001, National\n  had to write down the value of HomeSide’s assets, causing National’s\n  share prices to fall. Petitioners, Australians who purchased Na\n  tional’s shares before the write-downs, sued respondents—National,\n  HomeSide, and officers of both companies—in Federal District Court\n  for violation of §§10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act\n  of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b–5. They claimed that HomeSide and its\n  officers had manipulated financial models to make the company’s\n  mortgage-servicing rights appear more valuable than they really\n  were; and that National and its chief executive officer were aware of\n  this deception. Respondents moved to dismiss for lack of subject\n  matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)\n  and for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). The District\n  Court granted the former motion, finding no jurisdiction because the\n  domestic acts were, at most, a link in a securities fraud that con\n  cluded abroad. The Second Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. The Second Circuit erred in considering §10(b)’s extraterritorial\n reach to raise a question of subject-matter jurisdiction, thus allowing\n dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1). What conduct §10(b) reaches is a mer\n its question, while subject-matter jurisdiction “refers to a tribunal’s\n power to hear a case.” Union Pacific R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Loco\n motive Engineers and Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Adjustment, Central\n2         MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Region, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (internal quotation marks omitted). The\n    District Court had jurisdiction under 15 U. S. C. §78aa to adjudicate\n    the §10(b) question. However, it is unnecessary to remand in view of\n    that error because the same analysis justifies dismissal under Rule\n    12(b)(6). Pp. 4–5.\n       2. Section 10(b) does not provide a cause of action to foreign plain\n    tiffs suing foreign and American defendants for misconduct in con\n    nection with securities traded on foreign exchanges. Pp. 5–24.\n          (a) It is a “longstanding principle of American law ‘that legisla\n    tion of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears, is meant to apply\n    only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.’ ” EEOC\n    v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248 (Aramco). When a\n    statute gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application, it\n    has none. Nonetheless, the Second Circuit believed the Exchange\n    Act’s silence about §10(b)’s extraterritorial application permitted the\n    court to “discern” whether Congress would have wanted the statute\n    to apply. This disregard of the presumption against extraterritorial\n    ity has occurred over many decades in many courts of appeals and\n    has produced a collection of tests for divining congressional intent\n    that are complex in formulation and unpredictable in application.\n    The results demonstrate the wisdom of the presumption against ex\n    traterritoriality. Rather than guess anew in each case, this Court\n    applies the presumption in all cases, preserving a stable background\n    against which Congress can legislate with predictable effects. Pp. 5–\n    12.\n          (b) Because Rule 10b–5 was promulgated under §10(b), it “does\n    not extend beyond conduct encompassed by §10(b)’s prohibition.”\n    United States v. O’Hagan, 521 U. S. 642, 651. Thus, if §10(b) is not\n    extraterritorial, neither is Rule 10b–5. On its face, §10(b) contains\n    nothing to suggest that it applies abroad. Contrary to the argument\n    of petitioners and the Solicitor General, a general reference to foreign\n    commerce in the definition of “interstate commerce,” see 15 U. S. C.\n    §78c(a)(17), does not defeat the presumption against extraterritorial\n    ity, Aramco, supra, at 251. Nor does a fleeting reference, in §78b(2)’s\n    description of the Exchange Act’s purposes, to the dissemination and\n    quotation abroad of prices of domestically traded securities. Nor does\n    Exchange Act §30(b), which says that the Act does not apply “to any\n    person insofar as he transacts a business in securities without the ju\n    risdiction of the United States,” unless he does so in violation of regu\n    lations promulgated by the SEC “to prevent . . . evasion of [the Act].”\n    This would be an odd way of indicating that the Act always has ex\n    traterritorial application; the Commission’s enabling regulations pre\n    venting “evasion” seem directed at actions abroad that might conceal\n    a domestic violation. The argument of petitioners and the Solicitor\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  General also fails to account for §30(a), which explicitly provides for a\n  specific extraterritorial application. That provision would be quite\n  superfluous if the rest of the Exchange Act already applied to trans\n  actions on foreign exchanges—and its limitation of that application to\n  securities of domestic issuers would be inoperative. There being no\n  affirmative indication in the Exchange Act that §10(b) applies extra\n  territorially, it does not. Pp. 12–16.\n       (c) The domestic activity in this case—Florida is where Home-\n  Side and its executives engaged in the alleged deceptive conduct and\n  where some misleading public statements were made—does not\n  mean petitioners only seek domestic application of the Act. It is a\n  rare case of prohibited extraterritorial application that lacks all con\n  tact with United States territory. In Aramco, for example, where the\n  plaintiff had been hired in Houston and was an American citizen, see\n  499 U. S., at 247, this Court concluded that the “focus” of congres\n  sional concern in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was neither\n  that territorial event nor that relationship, but domestic employ\n  ment. Applying that analysis here: The Exchange Act’s focus is not\n  on the place where the deception originated, but on purchases and\n  sales of securities in the United States. Section 10(b) applies only to\n  transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges and domestic\n  transactions in other securities. The primacy of the domestic ex\n  change is suggested by the Exchange Act’s prologue, see 48 Stat. 881,\n  and by the fact that the Act’s registration requirements apply only to\n  securities listed on national securities exchanges, §78l(a). This focus\n  is also strongly confirmed by §30(a) and (b). Moreover, the Court re\n  jects the notion that the Exchange Act reaches conduct in this coun\n  try affecting exchanges or transactions abroad for the same reason\n  that Aramco rejected overseas application of Title VII: The probabil\n  ity of incompatibility with other countries’ laws is so obvious that if\n  Congress intended such foreign application “it would have addressed\n  the subject of conflicts with foreign laws and procedures.” 499 U. S.,\n  at 256. Neither the Government nor petitioners provide any textual\n  support for their proposed alternative test, which would find a viola\n  tion where the fraud involves significant and material conduct in the\n  United States.

Its Ordinary Shares—what in America would be\ncalled “common stock”—are traded on the Australian\nStock Exchange Limited and on other foreign securities\nexchanges, but not on any exchange in the United States.\nThere are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, how­\never, National’s American Depositary Receipts (ADRs),\nwhich represent the right to receive a specified number of\nNational’s Ordinary Shares. 547 F. 3d 167, 168, and n. 1\n(CA2 2008).\n   The complaint alleges the following facts, which we\naccept as true. In February 1998, National bought re­\nspondent HomeSide Lending, Inc., a mortgage servicing\n2      MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncompany headquartered in Florida. HomeSide’s business\nwas to receive fees for servicing mortgages (essentially the\nadministrative tasks associated with collecting mortgage\npayments, see J. Rosenberg, Dictionary of Banking and\nFinancial Services 600 (2d ed. 1985)). The rights to re­\nceive those fees, so-called mortgage-servicing rights, can\nprovide a valuable income stream. See 2 The New Pal­\ngrave Dictionary of Money and Finance 817 (P. Newman,\nM. Milgate, & J. Eatwell eds. 1992). How valuable each of\nthe rights is depends, in part, on the likelihood that the\nmortgage to which it applies will be fully repaid before it is\ndue, terminating the need for servicing. HomeSide calcu­\nlated the present value of its mortgage-servicing rights by\nusing valuation models designed to take this likelihood\ninto account. It recorded the value of its assets, and the\nnumbers appeared in National’s financial statements.\n   From 1998 until 2001, National’s annual reports and\nother public documents touted the success of HomeSide’s\nbusiness, and respondents Frank Cicutto (National’s\nmanaging director and chief executive officer), Kevin Race\n(HomeSide’s chief operating officer), and Hugh Harris\n(HomeSide’s chief executive officer) did the same in public\nstatements. But on July 5, 2001, National announced that\nit was writing down the value of HomeSide’s assets by\n$450 million; and then again on September 3, by another\n$1.75 billion. The prices of both Ordinary Shares and\nADRs slumped. After downplaying the July write-down,\nNational explained the September write-down as the\nresult of a failure to anticipate the lowering of prevailing\ninterest rates (lower interest rates lead to more refinanc­\nings, i.e., more early repayments of mortgages), other\nmistaken assumptions in the financial models, and the\nloss of goodwill. According to the complaint, however,\nHomeSide, Race, Harris, and another HomeSide senior\nexecutive who is also a respondent here had manipulated\nHomeSide’s financial models to make the rates of early\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nrepayment unrealistically low in order to cause the mort­\ngage-servicing rights to appear more valuable than they\nreally were. The complaint also alleges that National and\nCicutto were aware of this deception by July 2000, but did\nnothing about it.\n  As relevant here, petitioners Russell Leslie Owen and\nBrian and Geraldine Silverlock, all Australians, purchased\nNational’s Ordinary Shares in 2000 and 2001, before the\nwrite-downs.1 They sued National, HomeSide, Cicutto,\nand the three HomeSide executives in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York for\nalleged violations of §§10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and\nExchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 891, 15 U. S. C. §§78j(b)\nand 78t(a), and SEC Rule 10b–5, 17 CFR §240.10b–5\n(2009), promulgated pursuant to §10(b).2 They sought to\nrepresent a class of foreign purchasers of National’s Ordi­\nnary Shares during a specified period up to the September\nwrite-down. 547 F. 3d, at 169.\n——————\n  1 Robert Morrison, an American investor in National’s ADRs, also\n\nbrought suit, but his claims were dismissed by the District Court\nbecause he failed to allege damages.

Petitioners did not appeal that decision, 547\nF. 3d 167, 170, n. 3 (CA2 2008) (case below), and it is not before us.\nInexplicably, Morrison continued to be listed as a petitioner in the\nCourt of Appeals and here.\n  2 The relevant text of §10(b) and SEC Rule 10b–5 are set forth later in\n\nthis opinion. Section 20(a), 48 Stat. 899, provides:\n“Every person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person liable\nunder any provision of [the Exchange Act] or of any rule or regulation\nthereunder shall also be liable jointly and severally with and to the\nsame extent as such controlled person to any person to whom such\ncontrolled person is liable, unless the controlling person acted in good\nfaith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constitut­\ning the violation or cause of action.”\nLiability under §20(a) is obviously derivative of liability under some\nother provision of the Exchange Act; §10(b) is the only basis petitioners\nasserted.\n4      MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Respondents moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter\njurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)\nand for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). The\nDistrict Court granted the motion on the former ground,\nfinding no jurisdiction because the acts in this country\nwere, “at most, a link in the chain of an alleged overall\nsecurities fraud scheme that culminated abroad.” In re\nNational Australia Bank Securities Litigation, No. 03 Civ.\n6537 (BSJ), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3844465</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *8 (SDNY, Oct. 25, 2006).\nThe Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed on\nsimilar grounds. The acts performed in the United States\ndid not “compris[e] the heart of the alleged fraud.” 547\nF. 3d, at 175–176. We granted certiorari, 558 U. S. ___\n(2009).\n                              II\n   Before addressing the question presented, we must\ncorrect a threshold error in the Second Circuit’s analysis.\nIt considered the extraterritorial reach of §10(b) to raise a\nquestion of subject-matter jurisdiction, wherefore it af­\nfirmed the District Court’s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1).\nSee 547 F. 3d, at 177. In this regard it was following\nCircuit precedent, see Schoenbaum v. Firstbrook, 405\nF. 2d 200, 208, modified on other grounds en banc, 405\nF. 2d 215 (1968). The Second Circuit is hardly alone in\ntaking this position, see, e.g., In re CP Ships Ltd. Securi\nties Litigation, 578 F. 3d 1306, 1313 (CA11 2009); Conti\nnental Grain (Australia) PTY. Ltd. v. Pacific Oilseeds, Inc.,\n592 F. 2d 409, 421 (CA8 1979).\n   But to ask what conduct §10(b) reaches is to ask what\nconduct §10(b) prohibits, which is a merits question.\nSubject-matter jurisdiction, by contrast, “refers to a tribu­\nnal’s ‘ “power to hear a case.” ’ ” Union Pacific R. Co. v.\nLocomotive Engineers and Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Ad\njustment, Central Region, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop., at 12) (quoting Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500,\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n514 (2006), in turn quoting United States v. Cotton, 535\nU. S. 625, 630 (2002)). It presents an issue quite separate\nfrom the question whether the allegations the plaintiff\nmakes entitle him to relief. See Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S.\n678, 682 (1946). The District Court here had jurisdiction\nunder 15 U. S. C. §78aa3 to adjudicate the question\nwhether §10(b) applies to National’s conduct.\n  In view of this error, which the parties do not dispute,\npetitioners ask us to remand. We think that unnecessary.\nSince nothing in the analysis of the courts below turned on\nthe mistake, a remand would only require a new Rule\n12(b)(6) label for the same Rule 12(b)(1) conclusion. As we\nhave done before in situations like this, see, e.g., Romero v.\nInternational Terminal Operating Co., 358 U. S. 354, 359,\n381–384 (1959), we proceed to address whether petition­\ners’ allegations state a claim.\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n   It is a “longstanding principle of American law ‘that\nlegislation of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears,\nis meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of\nthe United States.’ ” EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co.,\n499 U. S. 244, 248 (1991) (Aramco) (quoting Foley Bros.,\nInc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 285 (1949)). This principle\nrepresents a canon of construction, or a presumption about\na statute’s meaning, rather than a limit upon Congress’s\npower to legislate, see Blackmer v. United States, 284\nU. S. 421, 437 (1932). It rests on the perception that\nCongress ordinarily legislates with respect to domestic,\n——————\n  3 Section 78aa provides:\n“The district courts of the United States . . . shall have exclusive\njurisdiction of violations of [the Exchange Act] or the rules and regula­\ntions thereunder, and of all suits in equity and actions at law brought\nto enforce any liability or duty created by [the Exchange Act] or the\nrules and regulations thereunder.”\n6      MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot foreign matters. Smith v. United States, 507 U. S.\n197, 204, n. 5 (1993). Thus, “unless there is the affirma­\ntive intention of the Congress clearly expressed” to give a\nstatute extraterritorial effect, “we must presume it is\nprimarily concerned with domestic conditions.” Aramco,\nsupra, at 248 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\ncanon or presumption applies regardless of whether there\nis a risk of conflict between the American statute and a\nforeign law, see Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, Inc., 509\nU. S. 155, 173–174 (1993). When a statute gives no clear\nindication of an extraterritorial application, it has none.\n   Despite this principle of interpretation, long and often\nrecited in our opinions, the Second Circuit believed that,\nbecause the Exchange Act is silent as to the extraterrito­\nrial application of §10(b), it was left to the court to “dis­\ncern” whether Congress would have wanted the statute to\napply. See 547 F. 3d, at 170 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). This disregard of the presumption against ex­\ntraterritoriality did not originate with the Court of Ap­\npeals panel in this case. It has been repeated over many\ndecades by various courts of appeals in determining the\napplication of the Exchange Act, and §10(b) in particular,\nto fraudulent schemes that involve conduct and effects\nabroad. That has produced a collection of tests for divin­\ning what Congress would have wanted, complex in formu­\nlation and unpredictable in application.\n   As of 1967, district courts at least in the Southern Dis­\ntrict of New York had consistently concluded that, by\nreason of the presumption against extraterritoriality,\n§10(b) did not apply when the stock transactions underly­\ning the violation occurred abroad.

It sufficed to apply §10(b) that, although the\ntransactions in treasury shares took place in Canada, they\naffected the value of the common shares publicly traded in\nthe United States. See id., at 208–209. Application of\n§10(b), the Second Circuit found, was “necessary to protect\nAmerican investors,” id., at 206.\n  The Second Circuit took another step with Leasco Data\nProcessing Equip. Corp. v. Maxwell, 468 F. 2d 1326 (1972),\nwhich involved an American company that had been\nfraudulently induced to buy securities in England. There,\nunlike in Schoenbaum, some of the deceptive conduct had\noccurred in the United States but the corporation whose\nsecurities were traded (abroad) was not listed on any\ndomestic exchange. Leasco said that the presumption\nagainst extraterritoriality apples only to matters over\nwhich the United States would not have prescriptive\njurisdiction, 468 F. 2d, at 1334. Congress had prescriptive\njurisdiction to regulate the deceptive conduct in this coun­\ntry, the language of the Act could be read to cover that\nconduct, and the court concluded that “if Congress had\nthought about the point,” it would have wanted §10(b) to\napply. Id., at 1334–1337.\n  With Schoenbaum and Leasco on the books, the Second\n8      MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCircuit had excised the presumption against extraterrito­\nriality from the jurisprudence of §10(b) and replaced it\nwith the inquiry whether it would be reasonable (and\nhence what Congress would have wanted) to apply the\nstatute to a given situation. As long as there was pre­\nscriptive jurisdiction to regulate, the Second Circuit ex­\nplained, whether to apply §10(b) even to “predominantly\nforeign” transactions became a matter of whether a court\nthought Congress “wished the precious resources of United\nStates courts and law enforcement agencies to be devoted\nto them rather than leave the problem to foreign coun­\ntries.” Bersch v. Drexel Firestone, Inc., 519 F. 2d 974, 985\n(1975); see also IIT v. Vencap, Ltd., 519 F. 2d 1001, 1017–\n1018 (CA2 1975).\n   The Second Circuit had thus established that applica­\ntion of §10(b) could be premised upon either some effect on\nAmerican securities markets or investors (Schoenbaum) or\nsignificant conduct in the United States (Leasco). It later\nformalized these two applications into (1) an “effects test,”\n“whether the wrongful conduct had a substantial effect in\nthe United States or upon United States citizens,” and (2)\na “conduct test,” “whether the wrongful conduct occurred\nin the United States.” SEC v. Berger, 322 F. 3d 187, 192–\n193 (CA2 2003). These became the north star of the Sec­\nond Circuit’s §10(b) jurisprudence, pointing the way to\nwhat Congress would have wished. Indeed, the Second\nCircuit declined to keep its two tests distinct on the\nground that “an admixture or combination of the two often\ngives a better picture of whether there is sufficient United\nStates involvement to justify the exercise of jurisdiction by\nan American court.” Itoba Ltd. v. Lep Group PLC, 54\nF. 3d 118, 122 (1995). The Second Circuit never put for­\nward a textual or even extratextual basis for these tests.\nAs early as Bersch, it confessed that “if we were asked to\npoint to language in the statutes, or even in the legislative\nhistory, that compelled these conclusions, we would be\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunable to respond,” 519 F. 2d, at 993.\n   As they developed, these tests were not easy to adminis­\nter. The conduct test was held to apply differently de­\npending on whether the harmed investors were Americans\nor foreigners: When the alleged damages consisted of\nlosses to American investors abroad, it was enough that\nacts “of material importance” performed in the United\nStates “significantly contributed” to that result; whereas\nthose acts must have “directly caused” the result when\nlosses to foreigners abroad were at issue. See Bersch, 519\nF. 2d, at 993. And “merely preparatory activities in the\nUnited States” did not suffice “to trigger application of the\nsecurities laws for injury to foreigners located abroad.”\nId., at 992. This required the court to distinguish between\nmere preparation and using the United States as a “base”\nfor fraudulent activities in other countries. Vencap, supra,\nat 1017–1018. But merely satisfying the conduct test was\nsometimes insufficient without “ ‘some additional factor\ntipping the scales’ ” in favor of the application of American\nlaw. Interbrew v.

Cornfeld, 619\nF. 2d 909, 918 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Other Circuits embraced the Second Circuit’s approach,\nthough not its precise application. Like the Second Cir­\ncuit, they described their decisions regarding the extrater­\nritorial application of §10(b) as essentially resolving mat­\nters of policy. See, e.g., SEC v. Kasser, 548 F. 2d 109, 116\n10      MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n(CA3 1977); Continental Grain, 592 F. 2d, at 421–422;\nGrunenthal GmbH v. Hotz, 712 F. 2d 421, 424–425 (CA9\n1983); Kauthar SDN BHD v. Sternberg, 149 F. 3d 659, 667\n(CA7 1998). While applying the same fundamental meth­\nodology of balancing interests and arriving at what\nseemed the best policy, they produced a proliferation of\nvaguely related variations on the “conduct” and “effects”\ntests. As described in a leading Seventh Circuit opinion:\n“Although the circuits . . . seem to agree that there are\nsome transnational situations to which the antifraud\nprovisions of the securities laws are applicable, agreement\nappears to end at that point.”4 Id., at 665. See also id., at\n665–667 (describing the approaches of the various Circuits\nand adopting yet another variation).\n  At least one Court of Appeals has criticized this line of\ncases and the interpretive assumption that underlies it.\nIn Zoelsch v. Arthur Andersen & Co., 824 F. 2d 27, 32\n(1987) (Bork, J.), the District of Columbia Circuit observed\nthat rather than courts’ “divining what ‘Congress would\nhave wished’ if it had addressed the problem[, a] more\nnatural inquiry might be what jurisdiction Congress in\n——————\n  4 The principal concurrence (see post, p. 1 (STEVENS, J., concurring in\n\njudgment) (hereinafter concurrence)) disputes this characterization,\nlaunching into a Homeric simile which takes as its point of departure\n(and mistakes for praise rather than condemnation) then-Justice\nRehnquist’s statement in Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421\nU.

The concurrence seemingly\nbelieves that the Courts of Appeals have carefully trimmed and\nsculpted this “judicial oak” into a cohesive canopy, under the watchful\neye of Judge Henry Friendly, the “master arborist,” ibid. See post, at\n2–3. Even if one thinks that the “conduct” and “effects” tests are\nnumbered among Judge Friendly’s many fine contributions to the law,\nhis successors, though perhaps under the impression that they nurture\nthe same mighty oak, are in reality tending each its own botanically\ndistinct tree. It is telling that the concurrence never attempts its own\nsynthesis of the various balancing tests the Circuits have adopted.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

See also Robinson v. TCI/US\nWest Communications Inc., 117 F. 3d 900, 906–907 (CA5\n1997) (expressing agreement with Zoelsch’s criticism of\nthe emphasis on policy considerations in some of the\ncases).\n  Commentators have criticized the unpredictable and\ninconsistent application of §10(b) to transnational cases.\nSee, e.g., Choi & Silberman, Transnational Litigation and\nGlobal Securities Class-Action Lawsuits, 2009 Wis. L. Rev.\n465, 467–468; Chang, Multinational Enforcement of U. S.\nSecurities Laws: The Need for the Clear and Restrained\nScope of Extraterritorial Subject-Matter Jurisdiction, 9\nFordham J.

Probs. 241, 244–248\n(1992). Some have challenged the premise underlying the\nCourts of Appeals’ approach, namely that Congress did not\nconsider the extraterritorial application of §10(b) (thereby\nleaving it open to the courts, supposedly, to determine\nwhat Congress would have wanted). See, e.g., Sachs, The\nInternational Reach of Rule 10b–5: The Myth of Congres­\nsional Silence, 28 Colum. J. Transnat’l L. 677 (1990) (ar­\nguing that Congress considered, but rejected, applying the\nExchange Act to transactions abroad). Others, more\nfundamentally, have noted that using congressional si­\nlence as a justification for judge-made rules violates the\ntraditional principle that silence means no extraterritorial\napplication. See, e.g., Note, Let There Be Fraud (Abroad):\nA Proposal for A New U. S. Jurisprudence with Regard to\nthe Extraterritorial Application of the Anti-Fraud Provi­\nsions of the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts, 28 Law & Pol’y\n12       MORRISON v.

The results of judi­\ncial-speculation-made-law—divining what Congress would\nhave wanted if it had thought of the situation before the\ncourt—demonstrate the wisdom of the presumption\nagainst extraterritoriality. Rather than guess anew in\neach case, we apply the presumption in all cases, preserv­\ning a stable background against which Congress can legis­\nlate with predictable effects.5\n                            B\n  Rule 10b–5, the regulation under which petitioners have\nbrought suit,6 was promulgated under §10(b), and “does\n——————\n   5 The concurrence urges us to cast aside our inhibitions and join in\n\nthe judicial lawmaking, because “[t]his entire area of law is replete with\njudge-made rules,” post, at 3. It is doubtless true that, because the\nimplied private cause of action under §10(b) and Rule 10b–5 is a thing\nof our own creation, we have also defined its contours. See, e.g., Blue\nChip Stamps, supra. But when it comes to “the scope of [the] conduct\nprohibited by [Rule 10b–5 and] §10(b), the text of the statute controls\nour decision.” Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of\nDenver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 173 (1994). It is only with respect to the\nadditional “elements of the 10b–5 private liability scheme” that we\n“have had ‘to infer how the 1934 Congress would have addressed the\nissue[s] had the 10b–5 action been included as an express provision in\nthe 1934 Act.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Musick, Peeler & Garrett v. Employers\nIns. of Wausau, 508 U. S. 286, 294 (1933)).\n   6 Rule 10b–5 makes it unlawful:\n\n“for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or\ninstrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails or of any facility\nof any national securities exchange,\n      “(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,\n      “(b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to\n   state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements\n   made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,\n   not misleading, or\n      “(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which\n   operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,\nin connection with the purchase or sale of any security.”         17 CFR\n§240.10b–5 (2009).\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

S. 642, 651\n(1997). Therefore, if §10(b) is not extraterritorial, neither\nis Rule 10b–5.\n   On its face, §10(b) contains nothing to suggest it applies\nabroad:\n     “It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indi­\n     rectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of\n     interstate commerce or of the mails, or of any facility\n     of any national securities exchange . . . [t]o use or em­\n     ploy, in connection with the purchase or sale of any\n     security registered on a national securities exchange\n     or any security not so registered, . . . any manipulat­\n     ive or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention\n     of such rules and regulations as the [Securities and\n     Exchange] Commission may prescribe . . . .”            15\n     U. S. C. 78j(b).\nPetitioners and the Solicitor General contend, however,\nthat three things indicate that §10(b) or the Exchange Act\nin general has at least some extraterritorial application.\n   First, they point to the definition of “interstate com­\nmerce,” a term used in §10(b), which includes “trade,\ncommerce, transportation, or communication . . . between\nany foreign country and any State.”             15 U. S. C.\n§78c(a)(17). But “we have repeatedly held that even stat­\nutes that contain broad language in their definitions of\n‘commerce’ that expressly refer to ‘foreign commerce’ do\nnot apply abroad.” Aramco, 499 U. S., at 251; see id., at\n251–252 (discussing cases). The general reference to\nforeign commerce in the definition of “interstate com­\nmerce” does not defeat the presumption against extraterri­\n\n——————\n   The Second Circuit considered petitioners’ appeal to raise only a\nclaim under Rule 10b–5(b), since it found their claims under subsec­\ntions (a) and (c) to be forfeited. 547 F. 3d, at 176, n. 7. We do likewise.\n14         MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntoriality.7\n   Petitioners and the Solicitor General next point out that\nCongress, in describing the purposes of the Exchange Act,\nobserved that the “prices established and offered in such\ntransactions are generally disseminated and quoted\nthroughout the United States and foreign countries.” 15\nU. S. C. §78b(2). The antecedent of “such transactions,”\nhowever, is found in the first sentence of the section,\nwhich declares that “transactions in securities as com­\nmonly conducted upon securities exchanges and over-the­\ncounter markets are affected with a national public inter­\nest.” §78b. Nothing suggests that this national public\ninterest pertains to transactions conducted upon foreign\nexchanges and markets. The fleeting reference to the\ndissemination and quotation abroad of the prices of securi­\nties traded in domestic exchanges and markets cannot\novercome the presumption against extraterritoriality.\n   Finally, there is §30(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U. S. C.\n§78dd(b), which does mention the Act’s extraterritorial\napplication: “The provisions of [the Exchange Act] or of\nany rule or regulation thereunder shall not apply to any\nperson insofar as he transacts a business in securities\nwithout the jurisdiction of the United States,” unless he\ndoes so in violation of regulations promulgated by the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission “to prevent . . .\nevasion of [the Act].” (The parties have pointed us to no\nregulation promulgated pursuant to §30(b).) The Solicitor\nGeneral argues that “[this] exemption would have no\n——————\n  7 This  conclusion does not render meaningless the inclusion of “trade,\ncommerce, transportation, or communication . . . between any foreign\ncountry and any State” in the definition of “interstate commerce.” 15\nU. S. C. §78c(a)(17). For example, an issuer based abroad, whose\nexecutives approve the publication in the United States of misleading\ninformation affecting the price of the issuer’s securities traded on the\nNew York Stock Exchange, probably will make use of some instrumen­\ntality of “communication . . . between [a] foreign country and [a] State.”\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

In the first place, it would be odd\nfor Congress to indicate the extraterritorial application of\nthe whole Exchange Act by means of a provision imposing\na condition precedent to its application abroad. And if the\nwhole Act applied abroad, why would the Commission’s\nenabling regulations be limited to those preventing “eva­\nsion” of the Act, rather than all those preventing “viola­\ntion”? The provision seems to us directed at actions\nabroad that might conceal a domestic violation, or might\ncause what would otherwise be a domestic violation to\nescape on a technicality. At most, the Solicitor General’s\nproposed inference is possible; but possible interpretations\nof statutory language do not override the presumption\nagainst extraterritoriality. See Aramco, supra, at 253.\n   The Solicitor General also fails to account for §30(a),\nwhich reads in relevant part as follows:\n       “It shall be unlawful for any broker or dealer . . . to\n    make use of the mails or of any means or instrumen­\n    tality of interstate commerce for the purpose of effect­\n    ing on an exchange not within or subject to the juris­\n    diction of the United States, any transaction in any\n    security the issuer of which is a resident of, or is or­\n    ganized under the laws of, or has its principal place of\n    business in, a place within or subject to the jurisdic­\n    tion of the United States, in contravention of such\n    rules and regulations as the Commission may pre­\n    scribe . . . .” 15 U. S. C. §78dd(a).\nSubsection 30(a) contains what §10(b) lacks: a clear\nstatement of extraterritorial effect. Its explicit provision\nfor a specific extraterritorial application would be quite\nsuperfluous if the rest of the Exchange Act already applied\nto transactions on foreign exchanges—and its limitation of\n16       MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthat application to securities of domestic issuers would be\ninoperative. Even if that were not true, when a statute\nprovides for some extraterritorial application, the pre­\nsumption against extraterritoriality operates to limit that\nprovision to its terms. See Microsoft Corp. v. AT&T Corp.,\n550 U. S. 437, 455–456 (2007). No one claims that §30(a)\napplies here.\n   The concurrence claims we have impermissibly nar­\nrowed the inquiry in evaluating whether a statute applies\nabroad, citing for that point the dissent in Aramco, see\npost, at 6. But we do not say, as the concurrence seems to\nthink, that the presumption against extraterritoriality is a\n“clear statement rule,” ibid., if by that is meant a re­\nquirement that a statute say “this law applies abroad.”\nAssuredly context can be consulted as well. But whatever\nsources of statutory meaning one consults to give “the\nmost faithful reading” of the text, post, at 7, there is no\nclear indication of extraterritoriality here. The concur­\nrence does not even try to refute that conclusion, but\nmerely puts forward the same (at best) uncertain indica­\ntions relied upon by petitioners and the Solicitor General.\nAs the opinion for the Court in Aramco (which we prefer to\nthe dissent) shows, those uncertain indications do not\nsuffice.8\n   In short, there is no affirmative indication in the Ex­\nchange Act that §10(b) applies extraterritorially, and we\ntherefore conclude that it does not.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n   8 The concurrence notes that, post-Aramco, Congress provided explic­\n\nitly for extraterritorial application of Title VII, the statute at issue in\nAramco. Post, at 6, n. 6. All this shows is that Congress knows how to\ngive a statute explicit extraterritorial effect—and how to limit that\neffect to particular applications, which is what the cited amendment\ndid. See Civil Rights Act of 1991, §109, 105 Stat. 1077.\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

This is less an answer to the\npresumption against extraterritorial application than it is\nan assertion—a quite valid assertion—that that presump­\ntion here (as often) is not self-evidently dispositive, but its\napplication requires further analysis. For it is a rare case\nof prohibited extraterritorial application that lacks all\ncontact with the territory of the United States. But the\npresumption against extraterritorial application would be\na craven watchdog indeed if it retreated to its kennel\nwhenever some domestic activity is involved in the case.\nThe concurrence seems to imagine just such a timid senti­\nnel, see post, at 7–8, but our cases are to the contrary. In\nAramco, for example, the Title VII plaintiff had been hired\nin Houston, and was an American citizen. See 499 U. S.,\nat 247. The Court concluded, however, that neither that\nterritorial event nor that relationship was the “focus” of\ncongressional concern, id., at 255, but rather domestic\nemployment. See also Foley Bros., 336 U. S., at 283, 285–\n286.\n   Applying the same mode of analysis here, we think that\nthe focus of the Exchange Act is not upon the place where\nthe deception originated, but upon purchases and sales of\nsecurities in the United States. Section 10(b) does not\npunish deceptive conduct, but only deceptive conduct “in\nconnection with the purchase or sale of any security regis­\ntered on a national securities exchange or any security not\nso registered.” 15 U. S. C. §78j(b). See SEC v. Zandford,\n18        MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n535 U. S. 813, 820 (2002). Those purchase-and-sale trans­\nactions are the objects of the statute’s solicitude. It is\nthose transactions that the statute seeks to “regulate,” see\nSuperintendent of Ins. of N. Y. v. Bankers Life & Casualty\nCo., 404 U. S. 6, 12 (1971); it is parties or prospective\nparties to those transactions that the statute seeks to\n“protec[t],” id., at 10.     See also Ernst & Ernst v.\nHochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 195 (1976). And it is in our\nview only transactions in securities listed on domestic\nexchanges, and domestic transactions in other securities,\nto which §10(b) applies.9\n   The primacy of the domestic exchange is suggested by\nthe very prologue of the Exchange Act, which sets forth as\nits object “[t]o provide for the regulation of securities\nexchanges . . . operating in interstate and foreign com­\nmerce and through the mails, to prevent inequitable and\nunfair practices on such exchanges . . . .” 48 Stat. 881. We\nknow of no one who thought that the Act was intended to\n“regulat[e]” foreign securities exchanges—or indeed who\neven believed that under established principles of interna­\ntional law Congress had the power to do so. The Act’s\nregistration requirements apply only to securities listed on\nnational securities exchanges. 15 U. S. C. §78l(a).\n——————\n  9 The concurrence seems to think this test has little to do with our\nconclusion in Part III, supra, that §10(b) does not apply extraterritori­\nally. See post, at 11–12. That is not so. If §10(b) did apply abroad, we\nwould not need to determine which transnational frauds it applied to; it\nwould apply to all of them (barring some other limitation). Thus,\nalthough it is true, as we have said, that our threshold conclusion that\n§10(b) has no extraterritorial effect does not resolve this case, it is a\nnecessary first step in the analysis.\n   The concurrence also makes the curious criticism that our evaluation\nof where a putative violation occurs is based on the text of §10(b) rather\nthan the doctrine in the Courts of Appeals. Post, at 1–2. Although it\nconcedes that our test is textually plausible, post, at 1, it does not (and\ncannot) make the same claim for the Court-of-Appeals doctrine it\nendorses. That is enough to make our test the better one.\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

The former extends the normal scope of the Ex­\nchange Act’s prohibitions to acts effecting, in violation of\nrules prescribed by the Commission, a “transaction” in a\nUnited States security “on an exchange not within or\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the United States.” §78dd(a).\nAnd the latter specifies that the Act does not apply to “any\nperson insofar as he transacts a business in securities\nwithout the jurisdiction of the United States,” unless he\ndoes so in violation of regulations promulgated by the\nCommission “to prevent evasion [of the Act].” §78dd(b).\nUnder both provisions it is the foreign location of the\ntransaction that establishes (or reflects the presumption\nof) the Act’s inapplicability, absent regulations by the\nCommission.\n  The same focus on domestic transactions is evident in\nthe Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 74, enacted by the\nsame Congress as the Exchange Act, and forming part of\nthe same comprehensive regulation of securities trading.\nSee Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank\nof Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 170–171 (1994). That\nlegislation makes it unlawful to sell a security, through a\nprospectus or otherwise, making use of “any means or\ninstruments of transportation or communication in inter­\n——————\n  10 That   is in our view the meaning which the presumption against\nextraterritorial application requires for the words “purchase or sale, of\n. . . any security not so registered” in §10(b)’s phrase “in connection with\nthe purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities\nexchange or any security not so registered” (emphasis added). Even\nwithout the presumption against extraterritorial application, the only\nalternative to that reading makes nonsense of the phrase, causing it to\ncover all purchases and sales of registered securities, and all purchases\nand sales of nonregistered securities—a thought which, if intended,\nwould surely have been expressed by the simpler phrase “all purchases\nand sales of securities.”\n20     MORRISON v.

The Com­\nmission has interpreted that requirement “not to include\n. . . sales that occur outside the United States.” 17 CFR\n§230.901 (2009).\n    Finally, we reject the notion that the Exchange Act\nreaches conduct in this country affecting exchanges or\ntransactions abroad for the same reason that Aramco\nrejected overseas application of Title VII to all domesti­\ncally concluded employment contracts or all employment\ncontracts with American employers: The probability of\nincompatibility with the applicable laws of other countries\nis so obvious that if Congress intended such foreign appli­\ncation “it would have addressed the subject of conflicts\nwith foreign laws and procedures.” 499 U. S., at 256. Like\nthe United States, foreign countries regulate their domes­\ntic securities exchanges and securities transactions occur­\nring within their territorial jurisdiction. And the regula­\ntion of other countries often differs from ours as to what\nconstitutes fraud, what disclosures must be made, what\ndamages are recoverable, what discovery is available in\nlitigation, what individual actions may be joined in a\nsingle suit, what attorney’s fees are recoverable, and many\nother matters. See, e.g., Brief for United Kingdom of\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland as Amicus Curiae 16–\n21.

The transactional test we have adopted—whether\nthe purchase or sale is made in the United States, or\ninvolves a security listed on a domestic exchange—meets\nthat requirement.\n                             B\n   The Solicitor General suggests a different test, which\npetitioners also endorse: “[A] transnational securities\nfraud violates [§]10(b) when the fraud involves significant\nconduct in the United States that is material to the fraud’s\nsuccess.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16; see\nBrief for Petitioners 26. Neither the Solicitor General nor\npetitioners provide any textual support for this test. The\nSolicitor General sets forth a number of purposes such a\ntest would serve: achieving a high standard of business\nethics in the securities industry, ensuring honest securi­\nties markets and thereby promoting investor confidence,\nand preventing the United States from becoming a “Bar­\nbary Coast” for malefactors perpetrating frauds in foreign\nmarkets. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16–17.\nBut it provides no textual support for the last of these\npurposes, or for the first two as applied to the foreign\nsecurities industry and securities markets abroad. It is\nour function to give the statute the effect its language\nsuggests, however modest that may be; not to extend it to\nadmirable purposes it might be used to achieve.\n   If, moreover, one is to be attracted by the desirable\nconsequences of the “significant and material conduct”\ntest, one should also be repulsed by its adverse conse­\nquences.

S. 349 (2005).11 In\n——————\n   11 Discussed in Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22–23. The\n\nSolicitor General also cites, without description, a number of antitrust\ncases to support the proposition that domestic conduct with conse­\nquences abroad can be covered even by a statute that does not apply\nextraterritorially: Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon\nCorp., 370 U. S. 690 (1962); United States v. Sisal Sales Corp., 274\nU. S. 268 (1927); Thomsen v. Cayser, 243 U. S. 66 (1917); United States\nv. Pacific & Arctic R. & Nav. Co., 228 U. S. 87 (1913). These are no\nlonger of relevance to the point (if they ever were), since Continental\nOre overruled the holding of American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co.,\n213 U. S. 347, 357 (1909), that the antitrust laws do not apply extrater­\nritorially. See W. S. Kirkpatrick & Co. v. Environmental Tectonics\nCorp. Int’l, 493 U. S. 400, 407–408 (1990).          Moreover, the pre-\nContinental Ore cases all involved conspiracies to restrain trade in the\nUnited States, see Sisal Sales, supra, at 274–276; Thomsen, supra, at\n88; Pacific & Arctic, supra, at 105–106. And although a final case cited\nby the Solicitor General, Steele v. Bulova Watch Co., 344 U. S. 280,\n287–288 (1952), might be read to permit application of a nonextraterri­\ntorial statute whenever conduct in the United States contributes to a\nviolation abroad, we have since read it as interpreting the statute at\nissue—the Lanham Act—to have extraterritorial effect, EEOC v.\nArabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 252 (1991) (quoting 15\nU. S. C. §1127).\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat case we concluded that the wire-fraud statute, 18\nU. S. C. §1343 (2009 ed., Supp. II), was violated by defen­\ndants who ordered liquor over the phone from a store in\nMaryland with the intent to smuggle it into Canada and\ndeprive the Canadian Government of revenue. 544 U. S.,\nat 353, 371. Section 1343 prohibits “any scheme or artifice\nto defraud,”—fraud simpliciter, without any requirement\nthat it be “in connection with” any particular transaction\nor event. The Pasquantino Court said that the petitioners’\n“offense was complete the moment they executed the\nscheme inside the United States,” and that it was “[t]his\ndomestic element of petitioners’ conduct [that] the Gov­\nernment is punishing.” 544 U. S., at 371. Section 10(b),\nby contrast, punishes not all acts of deception, but only\nsuch acts “in connection with the purchase or sale of any\nsecurity registered on a national securities exchange or\nany security not so registered.” Not deception alone, but\ndeception with respect to certain purchases or sales is\nnecessary for a violation of the statute.\n   The Solicitor General points out that the “significant\nand material conduct” test is in accord with prevailing\nnotions of international comity. If so, that proves that if\nthe United States asserted prescriptive jurisdiction pursu­\nant to the “significant and material conduct” test it would\nnot violate customary international law; but it in no way\ntends to prove that that is what Congress has done.\n   Finally, the Solicitor General argues that the Commis­\nsion has adopted an interpretation similar to the “signifi­\ncant and material conduct” test, and that we should defer\nto that. In the two adjudications the Solicitor General\ncites, however, the Commission did not purport to be\nproviding its own interpretation of the statute, but relied\non decisions of federal courts—mainly Court of Appeals\ndecisions that in turn relied on the Schoenbaum and\nLeasco decisions of the Second Circuit that we discussed\nearlier.

S. C. §78j(b). In this case, the purchased securities are\nlisted only on a few foreign exchanges, none of which has\nregistered with the Securities and Exchange Commission\nas a “national securities exchange.” See §78f. The first\ncategory therefore does not apply. Further, the relevant\npurchases of these unregistered securities took place\nentirely in Australia and involved only Australian inves\ntors. And in accordance with the presumption against\nextraterritoriality, I do not read the second category to\ninclude such transactions. Thus, while state law or other\nfederal fraud statutes, see, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §1341 (mail\nfraud), §1343 (wire fraud), may apply to the fraudulent\nactivity alleged here to have occurred in the United States,\nI believe that §10(b) does not.

I would adhere to the general approach\nthat has been the law in the Second Circuit, and most of\nthe rest of the country, for nearly four decades.\n                              I\n    Today the Court announces a new “transactional test,”\nante, at 21, for defining the reach of §10(b) of the Securi­\nties Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), 15 U. S. C.\n§78j(b), and SEC Rule 10b–5, 17 CFR §240.10b–5(b)\n(2009): Henceforth, those provisions will extend only to\n“transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges\n. . . and domestic transactions in other securities,” ante, at\n18. If one confines one’s gaze to the statutory text, the\nCourt’s conclusion is a plausible one. But the federal\ncourts have been construing §10(b) in a different manner\nfor a long time, and the Court’s textual analysis is not\nnearly so compelling, in my view, as to warrant the aban­\ndonment of their doctrine.\n    The text and history of §10(b) are famously opaque on\nthe question of when, exactly, transnational securities\n2        MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nfrauds fall within the statute’s compass. As those types of\nfrauds became more common in the latter half of the 20th\ncentury, the federal courts were increasingly called upon\nto wrestle with that question. The Court of Appeals for\nthe Second Circuit, located in the Nation’s financial cen­\nter, led the effort. Beginning in earnest with Schoenbaum\nv. Firstbrook, 405 F. 2d 200, rev’d on rehearing on other\ngrounds, 405 F. 2d 215 (1968) (en banc), that court strove,\nover an extended series of cases, to “discern” under what\ncircumstances “Congress would have wished the precious\nresources of the United States courts and law enforcement\nagencies to be devoted to [transnational] transactions,”\n547 F. 3d 167, 170 (2008) (internal quotation marks omit­\nted). Relying on opinions by Judge Henry Friendly,1 the\nSecond Circuit eventually settled on a conduct-and-effects\ntest. This test asks “(1) whether the wrongful conduct\noccurred in the Unites States, and (2) whether the wrong­\nful conduct had a substantial effect in the United States or\nupon United States citizens.” Id., at 171. Numerous cases\nflesh out the proper application of each prong.\n   The Second Circuit’s test became the “north star” of\n§10(b) jurisprudence, ante, at 8, not just regionally but\nnationally as well. With minor variations, other courts\nconverged on the same basic approach.2 See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 15 (“The courts have\n——————\n   1 See, e.g., IIT, Int’l Inv. Trust v.

See\nante, at 23–24.\n   In light of this history, the Court’s critique of the deci­\nsion below for applying “judge-made rules” is quite mis­\nplaced. Ante, at 11. This entire area of law is replete with\njudge-made rules, which give concrete meaning to Con­\ngress’ general commands.3 “When we deal with private\nactions under Rule 10b–5,” then-Justice Rehnquist wrote\nmany years ago, “we deal with a judicial oak which has\ngrown from little more than a legislative acorn.” Blue\nChip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723, 737\n(1975). The “ ‘Mother Court’ ” of securities law tended to\nthat oak. Id., at 762 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (describing\nthe Second Circuit). One of our greatest jurists—the judge\nwho, “without a doubt, did more to shape the law of securi­\nties regulation than any [other] in the country”4—was its\nmaster arborist.\n   The development of §10(b) law was hardly an instance of\n——————\n   3 It is true that “when it comes to ‘the scope of [the] conduct prohib­\n\nited by [Rule 10b–5 and] §10(b), the text of the statute [has] control[led]\nour decision[s].’ ” Ante, at 12, n. 5 (quoting Central Bank of Denver, N.\nA. v.

And both Congress and the Commission\nsubsequently affirmed that role when they left intact the\nrelevant statutory and regulatory language, respectively,\nthroughout all the years that followed. See Brief for\nAlecta pensionsförsäkring, ömsesidigt et al. as Amici\nCuriae 31–33; cf. Musick, Peeler & Garrett v. Employers\nIns. of Wausau, 508 U. S. 286, 294 (1993) (inferring from\nrecent legislation Congress’ desire to “acknowledg[e]” the\n10b–5 action without “entangling” itself in the precise\nformulation thereof). Unlike certain other domains of\nsecurities law, this is “a case in which Congress has en­\nacted a regulatory statute and then has accepted, over a\nlong period of time, broad judicial authority to define\nsubstantive standards of conduct and liability,” and much\nelse besides. Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v.\nScientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U. S. 148, 163 (2008).\n   This Court has not shied away from acknowledging that\nauthority. We have consistently confirmed that, in apply­\ning §10(b) and Rule 10b–5, courts may need “to flesh out\nthe portions of the law with respect to which neither the\ncongressional enactment nor the administrative regula­\ntions offer conclusive guidance.” Blue Chip, 421 U.

The Second Circuit\nrefined its test over several decades and dozens of cases,\nwith the tacit approval of Congress and the Commission\nand with the general assent of its sister Circuits. That\nhistory is a reason we should give additional weight to the\nSecond Circuit’s “judge-made” doctrine, not a reason to\ndenigrate it. “The longstanding acceptance by the courts,\ncoupled with Congress’ failure to reject [its] reasonable\ninterpretation of the wording of §10(b), . . . argues signifi­\ncantly in favor of acceptance of the [Second Circuit] rule\nby this Court.” Blue Chip, 421 U.

See, e.g., Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417 U. S. 506, 529–\n530 (1974) (Douglas, J., joined by Brennan, White, and Marshall, JJ.,\ndissenting) (“It has been recognized that the 1934 Act, including the\nprotections of Rule 10b–5, applies when foreign defendants have\ndefrauded American investors, particularly when . . . they have profited\nby virtue of proscribed conduct within our boundaries. This is true\neven when the defendant is organized under the laws of a foreign\ncountry, is conducting much of its activity outside the United States,\nand is therefore governed largely by foreign law” (citing, inter alia,\nLeasco, 468 F. 2d, at 1334–1339, and Schoenbaum v. Firstbrook, 405\nF. 2d 200, rev’d on rehearing on other grounds, 405 F. 2d 215 (CA2\n1968) (en banc))).\n6       MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                 STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nhas “disregard[ed]” the presumption against extraterrito­\nriality. Ante, at 6. It is the Court, however, that misap­\nplies the presumption, in two main respects.\n   First, the Court seeks to transform the presumption\nfrom a flexible rule of thumb into something more like a\nclear statement rule. We have been here before. In the\ncase on which the Court primarily relies, EEOC v. Ara\nbian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244 (1991) (Aramco),\nChief Justice Rehnquist’s majority opinion included a\nsentence that appeared to make the same move. See id.,\nat 258 (“Congress’ awareness of the need to make a clear\nstatement that a statute applies overseas is amply demon­\nstrated by the numerous occasions on which it has ex­\npressly legislated the extraterritorial application of a\nstatute”). Justice Marshall, in dissent, vigorously ob­\njected. See id., at 261 (“[C]ontrary to what one would\nconclude from the majority’s analysis, this canon is not a\n‘clear statement’ rule, the application of which relieves a\ncourt of the duty to give effect to all available indicia of the\nlegislative will”).\n   Yet even Aramco—surely the most extreme application\nof the presumption against extraterritoriality in my time\non the Court6—contained numerous passages suggesting\nthat the presumption may be overcome without a clear\ndirective. See id., at 248–255 (majority opinion) (repeat­\nedly identifying congressional “intent” as the touchstone of\nthe presumption). And our cases both before and after\nAramco make perfectly clear that the Court continues to\ngive effect to “all available evidence about the meaning” of\na provision when considering its extraterritorial applica­\ntion, lest we defy Congress’ will. Sale v. Haitian Centers\nCouncil, Inc., 509 U. S. 155, 177 (1993) (emphasis added).7\n——————\n  6 And also one of the most short lived. See Civil Rights Act of 1991,\n\n§109, 105 Stat. 1077 (repudiating Aramco).\n  7 See also, e.g., Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California, 509 U. S. 764\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

Hence, while the Court’s\ndictum that “[w]hen a statute gives no clear indication of\nan extraterritorial application, it has none,” ante, at 6,\nmakes for a nice catchphrase, the point is overstated. The\npresumption against extraterritoriality can be useful as a\ntheory of congressional purpose, a tool for managing in­\nternational conflict, a background norm, a tiebreaker. It\ndoes not relieve courts of their duty to give statutes the\nmost faithful reading possible.\n   Second, and more fundamentally, the Court errs in\nsuggesting that the presumption against extraterritorial­\nity is fatal to the Second Circuit’s test. For even if the\npresumption really were a clear statement (or “clear indi­\ncation,” ante, at 6, 16) rule, it would have only marginal\nrelevance to this case.\n   It is true, of course, that “this Court ordinarily construes\n\n——————\n(1993) (declining to apply presumption in assessing question of\nSherman Act extraterritoriality); Smith v. United States, 507 U. S. 197,\n201–204 (1993) (opinion for the Court by Rehnquist, C. J.) (considering\npresumption “[l]astly,” to resolve “any lingering doubt,” after consider­\ning structure, legislative history, and judicial interpretations of Federal\nTort Claims Act); cf. Sale, 509 U. S., at 188 (stating that presumption\n“has special force when we are construing treaty and statutory provi­\nsions that,” unlike §10(b), “may involve foreign and military affairs for\nwhich the President has unique responsibility”); Dodge, Understanding\nthe Presumption Against Extraterritoriality, 16 Berkeley J. Int’l L. 85,\n110 (1998) (explaining that lower courts “have been unanimous in\nconcluding that the presumption against extraterritoriality is not a\nclear statement rule”). The Court also relies on Microsoft Corp. v.\nAT&T Corp., 550 U. S. 437, 455–456 (2007). Ante, at 16. Yet Micro\nsoft’s articulation of the presumption is a far cry from the Court’s rigid\ntheory. “As a principle of general application,” Microsoft innocuously\nobserved, “we have stated that courts should ‘assume that legislators\ntake account of the legitimate sovereign interests of other nations when\nthey write American laws.’ ” 550 U. S., at 455 (quoting F. Hoffmann-La\nRoche Ltd v. Empagran S. A., 542 U. S. 155, 164 (2004)).\n8        MORRISON v.

Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 285\n(1949). Accordingly, the presumption against extraterrito­\nriality “provides a sound basis for concluding that Section\n10(b) does not apply when a securities fraud with no ef­\nfects in the United States is hatched and executed entirely\noutside this country.” Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 22. But that is just about all it provides a sound\nbasis for concluding. And the conclusion is not very illu­\nminating, because no party to the litigation disputes it.\nNo one contends that §10(b) applies to wholly foreign\nfrauds.\n   Rather, the real question in this case is how much, and\nwhat kinds of, domestic contacts are sufficient to trigger\napplication of §10(b).8 In developing its conduct-and­\neffects test, the Second Circuit endeavored to derive a\nsolution from the Exchange Act’s text, structure, history,\nand purpose. Judge Friendly and his colleagues were well\naware that United States courts “cannot and should not\nexpend [their] resources resolving cases that do not affect\nAmericans or involve fraud emanating from America.”\n547 F. 3d, at 175; see also id., at 171 (overriding concern is\n“ ‘whether there is sufficient United States involvement’ ”\n(quoting Itoba Ltd. v.

The text of the Exchange Act indicates that §10(b)\nextends to at least some activities with an international\ncomponent, but, again, it is not pellucid as to which ones.9\nThe Second Circuit draws the line as follows: §10(b) ex­\ntends to transnational frauds “only when substantial acts\nin furtherance of the fraud were committed within the\nUnited States,” SEC v. Berger, 322 F. 3d 187, 193 (CA2\n2003) (internal quotation marks omitted), or when the\nfraud was “ ‘intended to produce’ ” and did produce “ ‘det­\nrimental effects within’ ” the United States, Schoenbaum,\n405 F. 2d, at 206.10\n  This approach is consistent with the understanding\n——————\n  9 By  its terms, §10(b) regulates “interstate commerce,” 15 U. S. C.\n§78j, which the Exchange Act defines to include “trade, commerce,\ntransportation, or communication . . . between any foreign country and\nany State, or between any State and any place or ship outside thereof.”\n§78c(a)(17). Other provisions of the Exchange Act make clear that\nCongress contemplated some amount of transnational application. See,\ne.g., §78b(2) (stating, in explaining necessity for regulation, that “[t]he\nprices established and offered in [securities] transactions are generally\ndisseminated and quoted throughout the United States and foreign\ncountries and constitute a basis for determining and establishing the\nprices at which securities are bought and sold”); §78dd(b) (exempting\nfrom regulation foreign parties “unless” they transact business in\nsecurities “in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Com­\nmission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate to prevent the\nevasion of this chapter” (emphasis added)); see also Schoenbaum, 405\nF. 2d, at 206–208 (reviewing statutory text and legislative history).\nThe Court finds these textual references insufficient to overcome the\npresumption against extraterritoriality, ante, at 13–15, but as ex­\nplained in the main text, that finding rests upon the Court’s misappli­\ncation of the presumption.\n   10 The Government submits that a “transnational securities fraud\n\nviolates Section 10(b) if significant conduct material to the fraud’s\nsuccess occurs in the United States.” Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 6. I understand the Government’s submission to be largely a\nrepackaging of the “conduct” prong of the Second Circuit’s test. The\nGovernment expresses no view on that test’s “effects” prong, as the\ndecision below considered only respondents’ conduct. See id., at 15,\nn. 2; 547 F. 3d 167, 171 (CA2 2008).\n10     MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n               STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nshared by most scholars that Congress, in passing the\nExchange Act, “expected U. S. securities laws to apply to\ncertain international transactions or conduct.” Buxbaum,\nMultinational Class Actions Under Federal Securities\nLaw: Managing Jurisdictional Conflict, 46 Colum.

(detailing evidence that Congress\n“meant §10(b) to protect against fraud in the sale or pur­\nchase of securities whether or not these were traded on\norganized United States markets”). It is also consistent\nwith the traditional understanding, regnant in the 1930’s\nas it is now, that the presumption against extraterritorial­\nity does not apply “when the conduct [at issue] occurs\nwithin the United States,” and has lesser force when “the\nfailure to extend the scope of the statute to a foreign set­\nting will result in adverse effects within the United\nStates.” Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Massey, 986\nF. 2d 528, 531 (CADC 1993); accord, Restatement (Second)\nof Foreign Relations Law of the United States §38 (1964–\n1965); cf. Small v. United States, 544 U.

I do\nnot take issue with the Court for beginning its inquiry\nwith the statutory text, rather than the doctrine in the\nCourts of Appeals. Cf. ante, at 18, n. 9. I take issue with\nthe Court for beginning and ending its inquiry with the\nstatutory text, when the text does not speak with geo­\ngraphic precision, and for dismissing the long pedigree of,\nand the persuasive account of congressional intent embod­\nied in, the Second Circuit’s rule.\n   Repudiating the Second Circuit’s approach in its en­\ntirety, the Court establishes a novel rule that will foreclose\nprivate parties from bringing §10(b) actions whenever the\nrelevant securities were purchased or sold abroad and are\nnot listed on a domestic exchange.12 The real motor of the\n——————\n  11 Given its focus on “domestic conditions,” Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo,\n\n336 U. S. 281, 285 (1949), I expect that virtually all “ ‘foreign-cubed’ ”\nactions—actions in which “(1) foreign plaintiffs [are] suing (2) a foreign\nissuer in an American court for violations of American securities laws\nbased on securities transactions in (3) foreign countries,” 547 F. 3d, at\n172—would fail the Second Circuit’s test. As they generally should.\nUnder these circumstances, the odds of the fraud having a substantial\nconnection to the United States are low. In recognition of the Exchange\nAct’s focus on American investors and the novelty of foreign-cubed\nlawsuits, and in the interest of promoting clarity, it might have been\nappropriate to incorporate one bright line into the Second Circuit’s test,\nby categorically excluding such lawsuits from §10(b)’s ambit.\n  12 The Court’s opinion does not, however, foreclose the Commission\n\nfrom bringing enforcement actions in additional circumstances, as no\nissue concerning the Commission’s authority is presented by this case.\nThe Commission’s enforcement proceedings not only differ from private\n§10(b) actions in numerous potentially relevant respects, see Brief for\n12       MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nCourt’s opinion, it seems, is not the presumption against\nextraterritoriality but rather the Court’s belief that trans­\nactions on domestic exchanges are “the focus of the Ex­\nchange Act” and “the objects of [its] solicitude.” Ante, at\n17, 18. In reality, however, it is the “public interest” and\n“the interests of investors” that are the objects of the\nstatute’s solicitude. Europe & Overseas Commodity Trad\ners, S. A. v.

Or, imagine that those same executives\ngo knocking on doors in Manhattan and convince an unso­\nphisticated retiree, on the basis of material misrepresen­\ntations, to invest her life savings in the company’s doomed\nsecurities. Both of these investors would, under the\nCourt’s new test, be barred from seeking relief under\n§10(b).\n  The oddity of that result should give pause. For in\nwalling off such individuals from §10(b), the Court nar­\nrows the provision’s reach to a degree that would surprise\nand alarm generations of American investors—and, I am\nconvinced, the Congress that passed the Exchange Act.\nIndeed, the Court’s rule turns §10(b) jurisprudence (and\nthe presumption against extraterritoriality) on its head,\nby withdrawing the statute’s application from cases in\nwhich there is both substantial wrongful conduct that\noccurred in the United States and a substantial injurious\neffect on United States markets and citizens.\n                             III\n   In my judgment, if petitioners’ allegations of fraudulent\nmisconduct that took place in Florida are true, then re­\nspondents may have violated §10(b), and could potentially\nbe held accountable in an enforcement proceeding brought\nby the Commission. But it does not follow that sharehold­\ners who have failed to allege that the bulk or the heart of\nthe fraud occurred in the United States, or that the fraud\nhad an adverse impact on American investors or markets,\nmay maintain a private action to recover damages they\nsuffered abroad. Some cases involving foreign securities\ntransactions have extensive links to, and ramifications for,\nthis country; this case has Australia written all over it.\nAccordingly, for essentially the reasons stated in the Court\nof Appeals’ opinion, I would affirm its judgment.\n   The Court instead elects to upend a significant area of\nsecurities law based on a plausible, but hardly decisive,\n14     MORRISON v.

In so doing, it pays\nshort shrift to the United States’ interest in remedying\nfrauds that transpire on American soil or harm American\ncitizens, as well as to the accumulated wisdom and experi­\nence of the lower courts.

Argued March 29, 2010—Decided June 24, 2010\nIn 1998, respondent National Australia Bank (National), a foreign bank\n  whose “ordinary shares” are not traded on any exchange in this coun\n  try, purchased respondent HomeSide Lending, a company headquar\n  tered in Florida that was in the business of servicing mortgages—\n  seeing to collection of the monthly payments, etc. In 2001, National\n  had to write down the value of HomeSide’s assets, causing National’s\n  share prices to fall. Petitioners, Australians who purchased Na\n  tional’s shares before the write-downs, sued respondents—National,\n  HomeSide, and officers of both companies—in Federal District Court\n  for violation of §§10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act\n  of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b–5. They claimed that HomeSide and its\n  officers had manipulated financial models to make the company’s\n  mortgage-servicing rights appear more valuable than they really\n  were; and that National and its chief executive officer were aware of\n  this deception. Respondents moved to dismiss for lack of subject\n  matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)\n  and for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). The District\n  Court granted the former motion, finding no jurisdiction because the\n  domestic acts were, at most, a link in a securities fraud that con\n  cluded abroad. The Second Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. The Second Circuit erred in considering §10(b)’s extraterritorial\n reach to raise a question of subject-matter jurisdiction, thus allowing\n dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1). What conduct §10(b) reaches is a mer\n its question, while subject-matter jurisdiction “refers to a tribunal’s\n power to hear a case.” Union Pacific R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Loco\n motive Engineers and Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Adjustment, Central\n2         MORRISON v.

S. C. §78aa to adjudicate\n    the §10(b) question. However, it is unnecessary to remand in view of\n    that error because the same analysis justifies dismissal under Rule\n    12(b)(6). Pp. 4–5.\n       2. Section 10(b) does not provide a cause of action to foreign plain\n    tiffs suing foreign and American defendants for misconduct in con\n    nection with securities traded on foreign exchanges. Pp. 5–24.\n          (a) It is a “longstanding principle of American law ‘that legisla\n    tion of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears, is meant to apply\n    only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.’ ” EEOC\n    v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248 (Aramco). When a\n    statute gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application, it\n    has none. Nonetheless, the Second Circuit believed the Exchange\n    Act’s silence about §10(b)’s extraterritorial application permitted the\n    court to “discern” whether Congress would have wanted the statute\n    to apply. This disregard of the presumption against extraterritorial\n    ity has occurred over many decades in many courts of appeals and\n    has produced a collection of tests for divining congressional intent\n    that are complex in formulation and unpredictable in application.\n    The results demonstrate the wisdom of the presumption against ex\n    traterritoriality. Rather than guess anew in each case, this Court\n    applies the presumption in all cases, preserving a stable background\n    against which Congress can legislate with predictable effects. Pp. 5–\n    12.\n          (b) Because Rule 10b–5 was promulgated under §10(b), it “does\n    not extend beyond conduct encompassed by §10(b)’s prohibition.”\n    United States v. O’Hagan, 521 U. S. 642, 651. Thus, if §10(b) is not\n    extraterritorial, neither is Rule 10b–5. On its face, §10(b) contains\n    nothing to suggest that it applies abroad. Contrary to the argument\n    of petitioners and the Solicitor General, a general reference to foreign\n    commerce in the definition of “interstate commerce,” see 15 U. S. C.\n    §78c(a)(17), does not defeat the presumption against extraterritorial\n    ity, Aramco, supra, at 251. Nor does a fleeting reference, in §78b(2)’s\n    description of the Exchange Act’s purposes, to the dissemination and\n    quotation abroad of prices of domestically traded securities. Nor does\n    Exchange Act §30(b), which says that the Act does not apply “to any\n    person insofar as he transacts a business in securities without the ju\n    risdiction of the United States,” unless he does so in violation of regu\n    lations promulgated by the SEC “to prevent . . . evasion of [the Act].”\n    This would be an odd way of indicating that the Act always has ex\n    traterritorial application; the Commission’s enabling regulations pre\n    venting “evasion” seem directed at actions abroad that might conceal\n    a domestic violation. The argument of petitioners and the Solicitor\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

That provision would be quite\n  superfluous if the rest of the Exchange Act already applied to trans\n  actions on foreign exchanges—and its limitation of that application to\n  securities of domestic issuers would be inoperative. There being no\n  affirmative indication in the Exchange Act that §10(b) applies extra\n  territorially, it does not. Pp. 12–16.\n       (c) The domestic activity in this case—Florida is where Home-\n  Side and its executives engaged in the alleged deceptive conduct and\n  where some misleading public statements were made—does not\n  mean petitioners only seek domestic application of the Act. It is a\n  rare case of prohibited extraterritorial application that lacks all con\n  tact with United States territory. In Aramco, for example, where the\n  plaintiff had been hired in Houston and was an American citizen, see\n  499 U. S., at 247, this Court concluded that the “focus” of congres\n  sional concern in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was neither\n  that territorial event nor that relationship, but domestic employ\n  ment. Applying that analysis here: The Exchange Act’s focus is not\n  on the place where the deception originated, but on purchases and\n  sales of securities in the United States. Section 10(b) applies only to\n  transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges and domestic\n  transactions in other securities. The primacy of the domestic ex\n  change is suggested by the Exchange Act’s prologue, see 48 Stat. 881,\n  and by the fact that the Act’s registration requirements apply only to\n  securities listed on national securities exchanges, §78l(a). This focus\n  is also strongly confirmed by §30(a) and (b). Moreover, the Court re\n  jects the notion that the Exchange Act reaches conduct in this coun\n  try affecting exchanges or transactions abroad for the same reason\n  that Aramco rejected overseas application of Title VII: The probabil\n  ity of incompatibility with other countries’ laws is so obvious that if\n  Congress intended such foreign application “it would have addressed\n  the subject of conflicts with foreign laws and procedures.” 499 U. S.,\n  at 256. Neither the Government nor petitioners provide any textual\n  support for their proposed alternative test, which would find a viola\n  tion where the fraud involves significant and material conduct in the\n  United States.

Its Ordinary Shares—what in America would be\ncalled “common stock”—are traded on the Australian\nStock Exchange Limited and on other foreign securities\nexchanges, but not on any exchange in the United States.\nThere are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, how­\never, National’s American Depositary Receipts (ADRs),\nwhich represent the right to receive a specified number of\nNational’s Ordinary Shares. 547 F. 3d 167, 168, and n. 1\n(CA2 2008).\n   The complaint alleges the following facts, which we\naccept as true. In February 1998, National bought re­\nspondent HomeSide Lending, Inc., a mortgage servicing\n2      MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncompany headquartered in Florida. HomeSide’s business\nwas to receive fees for servicing mortgages (essentially the\nadministrative tasks associated with collecting mortgage\npayments, see J. Rosenberg, Dictionary of Banking and\nFinancial Services 600 (2d ed. 1985)). The rights to re­\nceive those fees, so-called mortgage-servicing rights, can\nprovide a valuable income stream. See 2 The New Pal­\ngrave Dictionary of Money and Finance 817 (P. Newman,\nM. Milgate, & J. Eatwell eds. 1992). How valuable each of\nthe rights is depends, in part, on the likelihood that the\nmortgage to which it applies will be fully repaid before it is\ndue, terminating the need for servicing. HomeSide calcu­\nlated the present value of its mortgage-servicing rights by\nusing valuation models designed to take this likelihood\ninto account. It recorded the value of its assets, and the\nnumbers appeared in National’s financial statements.\n   From 1998 until 2001, National’s annual reports and\nother public documents touted the success of HomeSide’s\nbusiness, and respondents Frank Cicutto (National’s\nmanaging director and chief executive officer), Kevin Race\n(HomeSide’s chief operating officer), and Hugh Harris\n(HomeSide’s chief executive officer) did the same in public\nstatements. But on July 5, 2001, National announced that\nit was writing down the value of HomeSide’s assets by\n$450 million; and then again on September 3, by another\n$1.75 billion. The prices of both Ordinary Shares and\nADRs slumped. After downplaying the July write-down,\nNational explained the September write-down as the\nresult of a failure to anticipate the lowering of prevailing\ninterest rates (lower interest rates lead to more refinanc­\nings, i.e., more early repayments of mortgages), other\nmistaken assumptions in the financial models, and the\nloss of goodwill. According to the complaint, however,\nHomeSide, Race, Harris, and another HomeSide senior\nexecutive who is also a respondent here had manipulated\nHomeSide’s financial models to make the rates of early\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nrepayment unrealistically low in order to cause the mort­\ngage-servicing rights to appear more valuable than they\nreally were. The complaint also alleges that National and\nCicutto were aware of this deception by July 2000, but did\nnothing about it.\n  As relevant here, petitioners Russell Leslie Owen and\nBrian and Geraldine Silverlock, all Australians, purchased\nNational’s Ordinary Shares in 2000 and 2001, before the\nwrite-downs.1 They sued National, HomeSide, Cicutto,\nand the three HomeSide executives in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York for\nalleged violations of §§10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and\nExchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 891, 15 U. S. C. §§78j(b)\nand 78t(a), and SEC Rule 10b–5, 17 CFR §240.10b–5\n(2009), promulgated pursuant to §10(b).2 They sought to\nrepresent a class of foreign purchasers of National’s Ordi­\nnary Shares during a specified period up to the September\nwrite-down. 547 F. 3d, at 169.\n——————\n  1 Robert Morrison, an American investor in National’s ADRs, also\n\nbrought suit, but his claims were dismissed by the District Court\nbecause he failed to allege damages. In re National Australia Bank\nSecurities Litigation, No. 03 Civ. 6537 (BSJ), 2006 WL 3844465, *9\n(SDNY, Oct. 25, 2006). Petitioners did not appeal that decision, 547\nF. 3d 167, 170, n. 3 (CA2 2008) (case below), and it is not before us.\nInexplicably, Morrison continued to be listed as a petitioner in the\nCourt of Appeals and here.\n  2 The relevant text of §10(b) and SEC Rule 10b–5 are set forth later in\n\nthis opinion. Section 20(a), 48 Stat. 899, provides:\n“Every person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person liable\nunder any provision of [the Exchange Act] or of any rule or regulation\nthereunder shall also be liable jointly and severally with and to the\nsame extent as such controlled person to any person to whom such\ncontrolled person is liable, unless the controlling person acted in good\nfaith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constitut­\ning the violation or cause of action.”\nLiability under §20(a) is obviously derivative of liability under some\nother provision of the Exchange Act; §10(b) is the only basis petitioners\nasserted.\n4      MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Respondents moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter\njurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)\nand for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). The\nDistrict Court granted the motion on the former ground,\nfinding no jurisdiction because the acts in this country\nwere, “at most, a link in the chain of an alleged overall\nsecurities fraud scheme that culminated abroad.” In re\nNational Australia Bank Securities Litigation, No. 03 Civ.\n6537 (BSJ), 2006 WL 3844465, *8 (SDNY, Oct. 25, 2006).\nThe Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed on\nsimilar grounds. The acts performed in the United States\ndid not “compris[e] the heart of the alleged fraud.” 547\nF. 3d, at 175–176. We granted certiorari, 558 U. S. ___\n(2009).\n                              II\n   Before addressing the question presented, we must\ncorrect a threshold error in the Second Circuit’s analysis.\nIt considered the extraterritorial reach of §10(b) to raise a\nquestion of subject-matter jurisdiction, wherefore it af­\nfirmed the District Court’s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1).\nSee 547 F. 3d, at 177. In this regard it was following\nCircuit precedent, see Schoenbaum v. Firstbrook, 405\nF. 2d 200, 208, modified on other grounds en banc, 405\nF. 2d 215 (1968). The Second Circuit is hardly alone in\ntaking this position, see, e.g., In re CP Ships Ltd. Securi\nties Litigation, 578 F. 3d 1306, 1313 (CA11 2009); Conti\nnental Grain (Australia) PTY. Ltd. v. Pacific Oilseeds, Inc.,\n592 F. 2d 409, 421 (CA8 1979).\n   But to ask what conduct §10(b) reaches is to ask what\nconduct §10(b) prohibits, which is a merits question.\nSubject-matter jurisdiction, by contrast, “refers to a tribu­\nnal’s ‘ “power to hear a case.” ’ ” Union Pacific R. Co. v.\nLocomotive Engineers and Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Ad\njustment, Central Region, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop., at 12) (quoting Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500,\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n514 (2006), in turn quoting United States v. Cotton, 535\nU. S. 625, 630 (2002)). It presents an issue quite separate\nfrom the question whether the allegations the plaintiff\nmakes entitle him to relief. See Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S.\n678, 682 (1946). The District Court here had jurisdiction\nunder 15 U. S. C. §78aa3 to adjudicate the question\nwhether §10(b) applies to National’s conduct.\n  In view of this error, which the parties do not dispute,\npetitioners ask us to remand. We think that unnecessary.\nSince nothing in the analysis of the courts below turned on\nthe mistake, a remand would only require a new Rule\n12(b)(6) label for the same Rule 12(b)(1) conclusion. As we\nhave done before in situations like this, see, e.g., Romero v.\nInternational Terminal Operating Co., 358 U. S. 354, 359,\n381–384 (1959), we proceed to address whether petition­\ners’ allegations state a claim.\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n   It is a “longstanding principle of American law ‘that\nlegislation of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears,\nis meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of\nthe United States.’ ” EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co.,\n499 U. S. 244, 248 (1991) (Aramco) (quoting Foley Bros.,\nInc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 285 (1949)). This principle\nrepresents a canon of construction, or a presumption about\na statute’s meaning, rather than a limit upon Congress’s\npower to legislate, see Blackmer v. United States, 284\nU. S. 421, 437 (1932). It rests on the perception that\nCongress ordinarily legislates with respect to domestic,\n——————\n  3 Section 78aa provides:\n“The district courts of the United States . . . shall have exclusive\njurisdiction of violations of [the Exchange Act] or the rules and regula­\ntions thereunder, and of all suits in equity and actions at law brought\nto enforce any liability or duty created by [the Exchange Act] or the\nrules and regulations thereunder.”\n6      MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot foreign matters. Smith v. United States, 507 U. S.\n197, 204, n. 5 (1993). Thus, “unless there is the affirma­\ntive intention of the Congress clearly expressed” to give a\nstatute extraterritorial effect, “we must presume it is\nprimarily concerned with domestic conditions.” Aramco,\nsupra, at 248 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\ncanon or presumption applies regardless of whether there\nis a risk of conflict between the American statute and a\nforeign law, see Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, Inc., 509\nU. S. 155, 173–174 (1993). When a statute gives no clear\nindication of an extraterritorial application, it has none.\n   Despite this principle of interpretation, long and often\nrecited in our opinions, the Second Circuit believed that,\nbecause the Exchange Act is silent as to the extraterrito­\nrial application of §10(b), it was left to the court to “dis­\ncern” whether Congress would have wanted the statute to\napply. See 547 F. 3d, at 170 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). This disregard of the presumption against ex­\ntraterritoriality did not originate with the Court of Ap­\npeals panel in this case. It has been repeated over many\ndecades by various courts of appeals in determining the\napplication of the Exchange Act, and §10(b) in particular,\nto fraudulent schemes that involve conduct and effects\nabroad. That has produced a collection of tests for divin­\ning what Congress would have wanted, complex in formu­\nlation and unpredictable in application.\n   As of 1967, district courts at least in the Southern Dis­\ntrict of New York had consistently concluded that, by\nreason of the presumption against extraterritoriality,\n§10(b) did not apply when the stock transactions underly­\ning the violation occurred abroad. See Schoenbaum v.\nFirstbrook, 268 F. Supp. 385, 392 (1967) (citing Ferraoli v.\nCantor, CCH Fed. Sec. L. Rep. ¶91615 (SDNY 1965) and\nKook v. Crang, 182 F. Supp. 388, 390 (SDNY 1960)).\nSchoenbaum involved the sale in Canada of the treasury\nshares of a Canadian corporation whose publicly traded\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nshares (but not, of course, its treasury shares) were listed\non both the American Stock Exchange and the Toronto\nStock Exchange. Invoking the presumption against extra­\nterritoriality, the court held that §10(b) was inapplicable\n(though it incorrectly viewed the defect as jurisdictional).\n268 F. Supp., at 391–392, 393–394. The decision in\nSchoenbaum was reversed, however, by a Second Circuit\nopinion which held that “neither the usual presumption\nagainst extraterritorial application of legislation nor the\nspecific language of [§]30(b) show Congressional intent to\npreclude application of the Exchange Act to transactions\nregarding stocks traded in the United States which are\neffected outside the United States . . . .” Schoenbaum, 405\nF. 2d, at 206. It sufficed to apply §10(b) that, although the\ntransactions in treasury shares took place in Canada, they\naffected the value of the common shares publicly traded in\nthe United States. See id., at 208–209. Application of\n§10(b), the Second Circuit found, was “necessary to protect\nAmerican investors,” id., at 206.\n  The Second Circuit took another step with Leasco Data\nProcessing Equip. Corp. v. Maxwell, 468 F. 2d 1326 (1972),\nwhich involved an American company that had been\nfraudulently induced to buy securities in England. There,\nunlike in Schoenbaum, some of the deceptive conduct had\noccurred in the United States but the corporation whose\nsecurities were traded (abroad) was not listed on any\ndomestic exchange. Leasco said that the presumption\nagainst extraterritoriality apples only to matters over\nwhich the United States would not have prescriptive\njurisdiction, 468 F. 2d, at 1334. Congress had prescriptive\njurisdiction to regulate the deceptive conduct in this coun­\ntry, the language of the Act could be read to cover that\nconduct, and the court concluded that “if Congress had\nthought about the point,” it would have wanted §10(b) to\napply. Id., at 1334–1337.\n  With Schoenbaum and Leasco on the books, the Second\n8      MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCircuit had excised the presumption against extraterrito­\nriality from the jurisprudence of §10(b) and replaced it\nwith the inquiry whether it would be reasonable (and\nhence what Congress would have wanted) to apply the\nstatute to a given situation. As long as there was pre­\nscriptive jurisdiction to regulate, the Second Circuit ex­\nplained, whether to apply §10(b) even to “predominantly\nforeign” transactions became a matter of whether a court\nthought Congress “wished the precious resources of United\nStates courts and law enforcement agencies to be devoted\nto them rather than leave the problem to foreign coun­\ntries.” Bersch v. Drexel Firestone, Inc., 519 F. 2d 974, 985\n(1975); see also IIT v. Vencap, Ltd., 519 F. 2d 1001, 1017–\n1018 (CA2 1975).\n   The Second Circuit had thus established that applica­\ntion of §10(b) could be premised upon either some effect on\nAmerican securities markets or investors (Schoenbaum) or\nsignificant conduct in the United States (Leasco). It later\nformalized these two applications into (1) an “effects test,”\n“whether the wrongful conduct had a substantial effect in\nthe United States or upon United States citizens,” and (2)\na “conduct test,” “whether the wrongful conduct occurred\nin the United States.” SEC v. Berger, 322 F. 3d 187, 192–\n193 (CA2 2003). These became the north star of the Sec­\nond Circuit’s §10(b) jurisprudence, pointing the way to\nwhat Congress would have wished. Indeed, the Second\nCircuit declined to keep its two tests distinct on the\nground that “an admixture or combination of the two often\ngives a better picture of whether there is sufficient United\nStates involvement to justify the exercise of jurisdiction by\nan American court.” Itoba Ltd. v. Lep Group PLC, 54\nF. 3d 118, 122 (1995). The Second Circuit never put for­\nward a textual or even extratextual basis for these tests.\nAs early as Bersch, it confessed that “if we were asked to\npoint to language in the statutes, or even in the legislative\nhistory, that compelled these conclusions, we would be\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunable to respond,” 519 F. 2d, at 993.\n   As they developed, these tests were not easy to adminis­\nter. The conduct test was held to apply differently de­\npending on whether the harmed investors were Americans\nor foreigners: When the alleged damages consisted of\nlosses to American investors abroad, it was enough that\nacts “of material importance” performed in the United\nStates “significantly contributed” to that result; whereas\nthose acts must have “directly caused” the result when\nlosses to foreigners abroad were at issue. See Bersch, 519\nF. 2d, at 993. And “merely preparatory activities in the\nUnited States” did not suffice “to trigger application of the\nsecurities laws for injury to foreigners located abroad.”\nId., at 992. This required the court to distinguish between\nmere preparation and using the United States as a “base”\nfor fraudulent activities in other countries. Vencap, supra,\nat 1017–1018. But merely satisfying the conduct test was\nsometimes insufficient without “ ‘some additional factor\ntipping the scales’ ” in favor of the application of American\nlaw. Interbrew v. Edperbrascan Corp., 23 F. Supp. 2d 425,\n432 (SDNY 1998) (quoting Europe & Overseas Commodity\nTraders, S. A. v. Banque Paribas London, 147 F. 3d 118,\n129 (CA2 1998)). District courts have noted the difficulty\nof applying such vague formulations. See, e.g., In re\nAlstom SA, 406 F. Supp. 2d 346, 366–385 (SDNY 2005).\nThere is no more damning indictment of the “conduct” and\n“effects” tests than the Second Circuit’s own declaration\nthat “the presence or absence of any single factor which\nwas considered significant in other cases . . . is not neces­\nsarily dispositive in future cases.” IIT v. Cornfeld, 619\nF. 2d 909, 918 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Other Circuits embraced the Second Circuit’s approach,\nthough not its precise application. Like the Second Cir­\ncuit, they described their decisions regarding the extrater­\nritorial application of §10(b) as essentially resolving mat­\nters of policy. See, e.g., SEC v. Kasser, 548 F. 2d 109, 116\n10      MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n(CA3 1977); Continental Grain, 592 F. 2d, at 421–422;\nGrunenthal GmbH v. Hotz, 712 F. 2d 421, 424–425 (CA9\n1983); Kauthar SDN BHD v. Sternberg, 149 F. 3d 659, 667\n(CA7 1998). While applying the same fundamental meth­\nodology of balancing interests and arriving at what\nseemed the best policy, they produced a proliferation of\nvaguely related variations on the “conduct” and “effects”\ntests. As described in a leading Seventh Circuit opinion:\n“Although the circuits . . . seem to agree that there are\nsome transnational situations to which the antifraud\nprovisions of the securities laws are applicable, agreement\nappears to end at that point.”4 Id., at 665. See also id., at\n665–667 (describing the approaches of the various Circuits\nand adopting yet another variation).\n  At least one Court of Appeals has criticized this line of\ncases and the interpretive assumption that underlies it.\nIn Zoelsch v. Arthur Andersen & Co., 824 F. 2d 27, 32\n(1987) (Bork, J.), the District of Columbia Circuit observed\nthat rather than courts’ “divining what ‘Congress would\nhave wished’ if it had addressed the problem[, a] more\nnatural inquiry might be what jurisdiction Congress in\n——————\n  4 The principal concurrence (see post, p. 1 (STEVENS, J., concurring in\n\njudgment) (hereinafter concurrence)) disputes this characterization,\nlaunching into a Homeric simile which takes as its point of departure\n(and mistakes for praise rather than condemnation) then-Justice\nRehnquist’s statement in Blue Chip Stamps v.

Probs. 241, 244–248\n(1992). Some have challenged the premise underlying the\nCourts of Appeals’ approach, namely that Congress did not\nconsider the extraterritorial application of §10(b) (thereby\nleaving it open to the courts, supposedly, to determine\nwhat Congress would have wanted). See, e.g., Sachs, The\nInternational Reach of Rule 10b–5: The Myth of Congres­\nsional Silence, 28 Colum. J. Transnat’l L. 677 (1990) (ar­\nguing that Congress considered, but rejected, applying the\nExchange Act to transactions abroad). Others, more\nfundamentally, have noted that using congressional si­\nlence as a justification for judge-made rules violates the\ntraditional principle that silence means no extraterritorial\napplication. See, e.g., Note, Let There Be Fraud (Abroad):\nA Proposal for A New U. S. Jurisprudence with Regard to\nthe Extraterritorial Application of the Anti-Fraud Provi­\nsions of the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts, 28 Law & Pol’y\n12       MORRISON v.

The results of judi­\ncial-speculation-made-law—divining what Congress would\nhave wanted if it had thought of the situation before the\ncourt—demonstrate the wisdom of the presumption\nagainst extraterritoriality. Rather than guess anew in\neach case, we apply the presumption in all cases, preserv­\ning a stable background against which Congress can legis­\nlate with predictable effects.5\n                            B\n  Rule 10b–5, the regulation under which petitioners have\nbrought suit,6 was promulgated under §10(b), and “does\n——————\n   5 The concurrence urges us to cast aside our inhibitions and join in\n\nthe judicial lawmaking, because “[t]his entire area of law is replete with\njudge-made rules,” post, at 3. It is doubtless true that, because the\nimplied private cause of action under §10(b) and Rule 10b–5 is a thing\nof our own creation, we have also defined its contours. See, e.g., Blue\nChip Stamps, supra. But when it comes to “the scope of [the] conduct\nprohibited by [Rule 10b–5 and] §10(b), the text of the statute controls\nour decision.” Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of\nDenver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 173 (1994). It is only with respect to the\nadditional “elements of the 10b–5 private liability scheme” that we\n“have had ‘to infer how the 1934 Congress would have addressed the\nissue[s] had the 10b–5 action been included as an express provision in\nthe 1934 Act.’ ” Ibid.

S. 642, 651\n(1997). Therefore, if §10(b) is not extraterritorial, neither\nis Rule 10b–5.\n   On its face, §10(b) contains nothing to suggest it applies\nabroad:\n     “It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indi­\n     rectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of\n     interstate commerce or of the mails, or of any facility\n     of any national securities exchange . . .

S. C. 78j(b).\nPetitioners and the Solicitor General contend, however,\nthat three things indicate that §10(b) or the Exchange Act\nin general has at least some extraterritorial application.\n   First, they point to the definition of “interstate com­\nmerce,” a term used in §10(b), which includes “trade,\ncommerce, transportation, or communication . . . between\nany foreign country and any State.”             15 U. S. C.\n§78c(a)(17). But “we have repeatedly held that even stat­\nutes that contain broad language in their definitions of\n‘commerce’ that expressly refer to ‘foreign commerce’ do\nnot apply abroad.” Aramco, 499 U. S., at 251; see id., at\n251–252 (discussing cases). The general reference to\nforeign commerce in the definition of “interstate com­\nmerce” does not defeat the presumption against extraterri­\n\n——————\n   The Second Circuit considered petitioners’ appeal to raise only a\nclaim under Rule 10b–5(b), since it found their claims under subsec­\ntions (a) and (c) to be forfeited. 547 F. 3d, at 176, n. 7. We do likewise.\n14         MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntoriality.7\n   Petitioners and the Solicitor General next point out that\nCongress, in describing the purposes of the Exchange Act,\nobserved that the “prices established and offered in such\ntransactions are generally disseminated and quoted\nthroughout the United States and foreign countries.” 15\nU. S. C. §78b(2). The antecedent of “such transactions,”\nhowever, is found in the first sentence of the section,\nwhich declares that “transactions in securities as com­\nmonly conducted upon securities exchanges and over-the­\ncounter markets are affected with a national public inter­\nest.” §78b. Nothing suggests that this national public\ninterest pertains to transactions conducted upon foreign\nexchanges and markets. The fleeting reference to the\ndissemination and quotation abroad of the prices of securi­\nties traded in domestic exchanges and markets cannot\novercome the presumption against extraterritoriality.\n   Finally, there is §30(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U. S. C.\n§78dd(b), which does mention the Act’s extraterritorial\napplication: “The provisions of [the Exchange Act] or of\nany rule or regulation thereunder shall not apply to any\nperson insofar as he transacts a business in securities\nwithout the jurisdiction of the United States,” unless he\ndoes so in violation of regulations promulgated by the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission “to prevent . . .\nevasion of [the Act].” (The parties have pointed us to no\nregulation promulgated pursuant to §30(b).) The Solicitor\nGeneral argues that “[this] exemption would have no\n——————\n  7 This  conclusion does not render meaningless the inclusion of “trade,\ncommerce, transportation, or communication . . . between any foreign\ncountry and any State” in the definition of “interstate commerce.” 15\nU. S. C. §78c(a)(17). For example, an issuer based abroad, whose\nexecutives approve the publication in the United States of misleading\ninformation affecting the price of the issuer’s securities traded on the\nNew York Stock Exchange, probably will make use of some instrumen­\ntality of “communication . . . between [a] foreign country and [a] State.”\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

In the first place, it would be odd\nfor Congress to indicate the extraterritorial application of\nthe whole Exchange Act by means of a provision imposing\na condition precedent to its application abroad. And if the\nwhole Act applied abroad, why would the Commission’s\nenabling regulations be limited to those preventing “eva­\nsion” of the Act, rather than all those preventing “viola­\ntion”? The provision seems to us directed at actions\nabroad that might conceal a domestic violation, or might\ncause what would otherwise be a domestic violation to\nescape on a technicality. At most, the Solicitor General’s\nproposed inference is possible; but possible interpretations\nof statutory language do not override the presumption\nagainst extraterritoriality. See Aramco, supra, at 253.\n   The Solicitor General also fails to account for §30(a),\nwhich reads in relevant part as follows:\n       “It shall be unlawful for any broker or dealer . . . to\n    make use of the mails or of any means or instrumen­\n    tality of interstate commerce for the purpose of effect­\n    ing on an exchange not within or subject to the juris­\n    diction of the United States, any transaction in any\n    security the issuer of which is a resident of, or is or­\n    ganized under the laws of, or has its principal place of\n    business in, a place within or subject to the jurisdic­\n    tion of the United States, in contravention of such\n    rules and regulations as the Commission may pre­\n    scribe . . . .” 15 U. S. C. §78dd(a).\nSubsection 30(a) contains what §10(b) lacks: a clear\nstatement of extraterritorial effect. Its explicit provision\nfor a specific extraterritorial application would be quite\nsuperfluous if the rest of the Exchange Act already applied\nto transactions on foreign exchanges—and its limitation of\n16       MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthat application to securities of domestic issuers would be\ninoperative. Even if that were not true, when a statute\nprovides for some extraterritorial application, the pre­\nsumption against extraterritoriality operates to limit that\nprovision to its terms. See Microsoft Corp. v. AT&T Corp.,\n550 U. S. 437, 455–456 (2007). No one claims that §30(a)\napplies here.\n   The concurrence claims we have impermissibly nar­\nrowed the inquiry in evaluating whether a statute applies\nabroad, citing for that point the dissent in Aramco, see\npost, at 6. But we do not say, as the concurrence seems to\nthink, that the presumption against extraterritoriality is a\n“clear statement rule,” ibid., if by that is meant a re­\nquirement that a statute say “this law applies abroad.”\nAssuredly context can be consulted as well. But whatever\nsources of statutory meaning one consults to give “the\nmost faithful reading” of the text, post, at 7, there is no\nclear indication of extraterritoriality here. The concur­\nrence does not even try to refute that conclusion, but\nmerely puts forward the same (at best) uncertain indica­\ntions relied upon by petitioners and the Solicitor General.\nAs the opinion for the Court in Aramco (which we prefer to\nthe dissent) shows, those uncertain indications do not\nsuffice.8\n   In short, there is no affirmative indication in the Ex­\nchange Act that §10(b) applies extraterritorially, and we\ntherefore conclude that it does not.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n   8 The concurrence notes that, post-Aramco, Congress provided explic­\n\nitly for extraterritorial application of Title VII, the statute at issue in\nAramco. Post, at 6, n. 6. All this shows is that Congress knows how to\ngive a statute explicit extraterritorial effect—and how to limit that\neffect to particular applications, which is what the cited amendment\ndid. See Civil Rights Act of 1991, §109, 105 Stat. 1077.\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

This is less an answer to the\npresumption against extraterritorial application than it is\nan assertion—a quite valid assertion—that that presump­\ntion here (as often) is not self-evidently dispositive, but its\napplication requires further analysis. For it is a rare case\nof prohibited extraterritorial application that lacks all\ncontact with the territory of the United States. But the\npresumption against extraterritorial application would be\na craven watchdog indeed if it retreated to its kennel\nwhenever some domestic activity is involved in the case.\nThe concurrence seems to imagine just such a timid senti­\nnel, see post, at 7–8, but our cases are to the contrary. In\nAramco, for example, the Title VII plaintiff had been hired\nin Houston, and was an American citizen. See 499 U. S.,\nat 247. The Court concluded, however, that neither that\nterritorial event nor that relationship was the “focus” of\ncongressional concern, id., at 255, but rather domestic\nemployment. See also Foley Bros., 336 U. S., at 283, 285–\n286.\n   Applying the same mode of analysis here, we think that\nthe focus of the Exchange Act is not upon the place where\nthe deception originated, but upon purchases and sales of\nsecurities in the United States. Section 10(b) does not\npunish deceptive conduct, but only deceptive conduct “in\nconnection with the purchase or sale of any security regis­\ntered on a national securities exchange or any security not\nso registered.” 15 U. S. C. §78j(b). See SEC v. Zandford,\n18        MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n535 U. S. 813, 820 (2002). Those purchase-and-sale trans­\nactions are the objects of the statute’s solicitude. It is\nthose transactions that the statute seeks to “regulate,” see\nSuperintendent of Ins. of N. Y. v. Bankers Life & Casualty\nCo., 404 U. S. 6, 12 (1971); it is parties or prospective\nparties to those transactions that the statute seeks to\n“protec[t],” id., at 10.     See also Ernst & Ernst v.\nHochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 195 (1976). And it is in our\nview only transactions in securities listed on domestic\nexchanges, and domestic transactions in other securities,\nto which §10(b) applies.9\n   The primacy of the domestic exchange is suggested by\nthe very prologue of the Exchange Act, which sets forth as\nits object “[t]o provide for the regulation of securities\nexchanges . . . operating in interstate and foreign com­\nmerce and through the mails, to prevent inequitable and\nunfair practices on such exchanges . . . .” 48 Stat. 881. We\nknow of no one who thought that the Act was intended to\n“regulat[e]” foreign securities exchanges—or indeed who\neven believed that under established principles of interna­\ntional law Congress had the power to do so. The Act’s\nregistration requirements apply only to securities listed on\nnational securities exchanges. 15 U. S. C. §78l(a).\n——————\n  9 The concurrence seems to think this test has little to do with our\nconclusion in Part III, supra, that §10(b) does not apply extraterritori­\nally. See post, at 11–12. That is not so. If §10(b) did apply abroad, we\nwould not need to determine which transnational frauds it applied to; it\nwould apply to all of them (barring some other limitation). Thus,\nalthough it is true, as we have said, that our threshold conclusion that\n§10(b) has no extraterritorial effect does not resolve this case, it is a\nnecessary first step in the analysis.\n   The concurrence also makes the curious criticism that our evaluation\nof where a putative violation occurs is based on the text of §10(b) rather\nthan the doctrine in the Courts of Appeals. Post, at 1–2. Although it\nconcedes that our test is textually plausible, post, at 1, it does not (and\ncannot) make the same claim for the Court-of-Appeals doctrine it\nendorses. That is enough to make our test the better one.\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

The former extends the normal scope of the Ex­\nchange Act’s prohibitions to acts effecting, in violation of\nrules prescribed by the Commission, a “transaction” in a\nUnited States security “on an exchange not within or\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the United States.” §78dd(a).\nAnd the latter specifies that the Act does not apply to “any\nperson insofar as he transacts a business in securities\nwithout the jurisdiction of the United States,” unless he\ndoes so in violation of regulations promulgated by the\nCommission “to prevent evasion [of the Act].” §78dd(b).\nUnder both provisions it is the foreign location of the\ntransaction that establishes (or reflects the presumption\nof) the Act’s inapplicability, absent regulations by the\nCommission.\n  The same focus on domestic transactions is evident in\nthe Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 74, enacted by the\nsame Congress as the Exchange Act, and forming part of\nthe same comprehensive regulation of securities trading.\nSee Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank\nof Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 170–171 (1994). That\nlegislation makes it unlawful to sell a security, through a\nprospectus or otherwise, making use of “any means or\ninstruments of transportation or communication in inter­\n——————\n  10 That   is in our view the meaning which the presumption against\nextraterritorial application requires for the words “purchase or sale, of\n. . . any security not so registered” in §10(b)’s phrase “in connection with\nthe purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities\nexchange or any security not so registered” (emphasis added). Even\nwithout the presumption against extraterritorial application, the only\nalternative to that reading makes nonsense of the phrase, causing it to\ncover all purchases and sales of registered securities, and all purchases\nand sales of nonregistered securities—a thought which, if intended,\nwould surely have been expressed by the simpler phrase “all purchases\nand sales of securities.”\n20     MORRISON v.

The Com­\nmission has interpreted that requirement “not to include\n. . . sales that occur outside the United States.” 17 CFR\n§230.901 (2009).\n    Finally, we reject the notion that the Exchange Act\nreaches conduct in this country affecting exchanges or\ntransactions abroad for the same reason that Aramco\nrejected overseas application of Title VII to all domesti­\ncally concluded employment contracts or all employment\ncontracts with American employers: The probability of\nincompatibility with the applicable laws of other countries\nis so obvious that if Congress intended such foreign appli­\ncation “it would have addressed the subject of conflicts\nwith foreign laws and procedures.” 499 U. S., at 256. Like\nthe United States, foreign countries regulate their domes­\ntic securities exchanges and securities transactions occur­\nring within their territorial jurisdiction. And the regula­\ntion of other countries often differs from ours as to what\nconstitutes fraud, what disclosures must be made, what\ndamages are recoverable, what discovery is available in\nlitigation, what individual actions may be joined in a\nsingle suit, what attorney’s fees are recoverable, and many\nother matters. See, e.g., Brief for United Kingdom of\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland as Amicus Curiae 16–\n21.

The transactional test we have adopted—whether\nthe purchase or sale is made in the United States, or\ninvolves a security listed on a domestic exchange—meets\nthat requirement.\n                             B\n   The Solicitor General suggests a different test, which\npetitioners also endorse: “[A] transnational securities\nfraud violates [§]10(b) when the fraud involves significant\nconduct in the United States that is material to the fraud’s\nsuccess.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16; see\nBrief for Petitioners 26. Neither the Solicitor General nor\npetitioners provide any textual support for this test. The\nSolicitor General sets forth a number of purposes such a\ntest would serve: achieving a high standard of business\nethics in the securities industry, ensuring honest securi­\nties markets and thereby promoting investor confidence,\nand preventing the United States from becoming a “Bar­\nbary Coast” for malefactors perpetrating frauds in foreign\nmarkets. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16–17.\nBut it provides no textual support for the last of these\npurposes, or for the first two as applied to the foreign\nsecurities industry and securities markets abroad.

The\n\nSolicitor General also cites, without description, a number of antitrust\ncases to support the proposition that domestic conduct with conse­\nquences abroad can be covered even by a statute that does not apply\nextraterritorially: Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon\nCorp., 370 U. S. 690 (1962); United States v. Sisal Sales Corp., 274\nU. S. 268 (1927); Thomsen v. Cayser, 243 U. S. 66 (1917); United States\nv. Pacific & Arctic R. & Nav.

S. 347, 357 (1909), that the antitrust laws do not apply extrater­\nritorially. See W. S. Kirkpatrick & Co. v. Environmental Tectonics\nCorp. Int’l, 493 U. S. 400, 407–408 (1990).

And although a final case cited\nby the Solicitor General, Steele v. Bulova Watch Co., 344 U. S. 280,\n287–288 (1952), might be read to permit application of a nonextraterri­\ntorial statute whenever conduct in the United States contributes to a\nviolation abroad, we have since read it as interpreting the statute at\nissue—the Lanham Act—to have extraterritorial effect, EEOC v.\nArabian American Oil Co., 499 U.

S. ____ (2010)          23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat case we concluded that the wire-fraud statute, 18\nU. S. C. §1343 (2009 ed., Supp. II), was violated by defen­\ndants who ordered liquor over the phone from a store in\nMaryland with the intent to smuggle it into Canada and\ndeprive the Canadian Government of revenue. 544 U. S.,\nat 353, 371. Section 1343 prohibits “any scheme or artifice\nto defraud,”—fraud simpliciter, without any requirement\nthat it be “in connection with” any particular transaction\nor event. The Pasquantino Court said that the petitioners’\n“offense was complete the moment they executed the\nscheme inside the United States,” and that it was “[t]his\ndomestic element of petitioners’ conduct [that] the Gov­\nernment is punishing.” 544 U. S., at 371. Section 10(b),\nby contrast, punishes not all acts of deception, but only\nsuch acts “in connection with the purchase or sale of any\nsecurity registered on a national securities exchange or\nany security not so registered.” Not deception alone, but\ndeception with respect to certain purchases or sales is\nnecessary for a violation of the statute.\n   The Solicitor General points out that the “significant\nand material conduct” test is in accord with prevailing\nnotions of international comity. If so, that proves that if\nthe United States asserted prescriptive jurisdiction pursu­\nant to the “significant and material conduct” test it would\nnot violate customary international law; but it in no way\ntends to prove that that is what Congress has done.\n   Finally, the Solicitor General argues that the Commis­\nsion has adopted an interpretation similar to the “signifi­\ncant and material conduct” test, and that we should defer\nto that. In the two adjudications the Solicitor General\ncites, however, the Commission did not purport to be\nproviding its own interpretation of the statute, but relied\non decisions of federal courts—mainly Court of Appeals\ndecisions that in turn relied on the Schoenbaum and\nLeasco decisions of the Second Circuit that we discussed\nearlier.

S. C. §78j(b). In this case, the purchased securities are\nlisted only on a few foreign exchanges, none of which has\nregistered with the Securities and Exchange Commission\nas a “national securities exchange.” See §78f. The first\ncategory therefore does not apply. Further, the relevant\npurchases of these unregistered securities took place\nentirely in Australia and involved only Australian inves\ntors. And in accordance with the presumption against\nextraterritoriality, I do not read the second category to\ninclude such transactions. Thus, while state law or other\nfederal fraud statutes, see, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §1341 (mail\nfraud), §1343 (wire fraud), may apply to the fraudulent\nactivity alleged here to have occurred in the United States,\nI believe that §10(b) does not. This case does not require\nus to consider other circumstances.\n   To the extent the Court’s opinion is consistent with\nthese views, I join it.\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

I would adhere to the general approach\nthat has been the law in the Second Circuit, and most of\nthe rest of the country, for nearly four decades.\n                              I\n    Today the Court announces a new “transactional test,”\nante, at 21, for defining the reach of §10(b) of the Securi­\nties Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), 15 U. S. C.\n§78j(b), and SEC Rule 10b–5, 17 CFR §240.10b–5(b)\n(2009): Henceforth, those provisions will extend only to\n“transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges\n. . . and domestic transactions in other securities,” ante, at\n18. If one confines one’s gaze to the statutory text, the\nCourt’s conclusion is a plausible one. But the federal\ncourts have been construing §10(b) in a different manner\nfor a long time, and the Court’s textual analysis is not\nnearly so compelling, in my view, as to warrant the aban­\ndonment of their doctrine.\n    The text and history of §10(b) are famously opaque on\nthe question of when, exactly, transnational securities\n2        MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nfrauds fall within the statute’s compass. As those types of\nfrauds became more common in the latter half of the 20th\ncentury, the federal courts were increasingly called upon\nto wrestle with that question. The Court of Appeals for\nthe Second Circuit, located in the Nation’s financial cen­\nter, led the effort. Beginning in earnest with Schoenbaum\nv. Firstbrook, 405 F. 2d 200, rev’d on rehearing on other\ngrounds, 405 F. 2d 215 (1968) (en banc), that court strove,\nover an extended series of cases, to “discern” under what\ncircumstances “Congress would have wished the precious\nresources of the United States courts and law enforcement\nagencies to be devoted to [transnational] transactions,”\n547 F. 3d 167, 170 (2008) (internal quotation marks omit­\nted). Relying on opinions by Judge Henry Friendly,1 the\nSecond Circuit eventually settled on a conduct-and-effects\ntest. This test asks “(1) whether the wrongful conduct\noccurred in the Unites States, and (2) whether the wrong­\nful conduct had a substantial effect in the United States or\nupon United States citizens.” Id., at 171. Numerous cases\nflesh out the proper application of each prong.\n   The Second Circuit’s test became the “north star” of\n§10(b) jurisprudence, ante, at 8, not just regionally but\nnationally as well. With minor variations, other courts\nconverged on the same basic approach.2 See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 15 (“The courts have\n——————\n   1 See, e.g., IIT, Int’l Inv. Trust v.

Neither Congress nor the Securities Ex­\nchange Commission (Commission) acted to change the\nlaw. To the contrary, the Commission largely adopted the\nSecond Circuit’s position in its own adjudications. See\nante, at 23–24.\n   In light of this history, the Court’s critique of the deci­\nsion below for applying “judge-made rules” is quite mis­\nplaced. Ante, at 11. This entire area of law is replete with\njudge-made rules, which give concrete meaning to Con­\ngress’ general commands.3 “When we deal with private\nactions under Rule 10b–5,” then-Justice Rehnquist wrote\nmany years ago, “we deal with a judicial oak which has\ngrown from little more than a legislative acorn.” Blue\nChip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723, 737\n(1975). The “ ‘Mother Court’ ” of securities law tended to\nthat oak. Id., at 762 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (describing\nthe Second Circuit). One of our greatest jurists—the judge\nwho, “without a doubt, did more to shape the law of securi­\nties regulation than any [other] in the country”4—was its\nmaster arborist.\n   The development of §10(b) law was hardly an instance of\n——————\n   3 It is true that “when it comes to ‘the scope of [the] conduct prohib­\n\nited by [Rule 10b–5 and] §10(b), the text of the statute [has] control[led]\nour decision[s].’ ” Ante, at 12, n. 5 (quoting Central Bank of Denver, N.\nA. v.

The problem, when it comes to transna­\ntional securities frauds, is that the text of the statute does not provide a\ngreat deal of control.

Congress invited an expansive role\nfor judicial elaboration when it crafted such an open-ended\nstatute in 1934. And both Congress and the Commission\nsubsequently affirmed that role when they left intact the\nrelevant statutory and regulatory language, respectively,\nthroughout all the years that followed. See Brief for\nAlecta pensionsförsäkring, ömsesidigt et al. as Amici\nCuriae 31–33; cf. Musick, Peeler & Garrett v. Employers\nIns. of Wausau, 508 U. S. 286, 294 (1993) (inferring from\nrecent legislation Congress’ desire to “acknowledg[e]” the\n10b–5 action without “entangling” itself in the precise\nformulation thereof). Unlike certain other domains of\nsecurities law, this is “a case in which Congress has en­\nacted a regulatory statute and then has accepted, over a\nlong period of time, broad judicial authority to define\nsubstantive standards of conduct and liability,” and much\nelse besides. Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v.\nScientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U. S. 148, 163 (2008).\n   This Court has not shied away from acknowledging that\nauthority. We have consistently confirmed that, in apply­\ning §10(b) and Rule 10b–5, courts may need “to flesh out\nthe portions of the law with respect to which neither the\ncongressional enactment nor the administrative regula­\ntions offer conclusive guidance.” Blue Chip, 421 U. S., at\n737. And we have unanimously “recogniz[ed] a judicial\nauthority to shape . . . the 10b–5 cause of action,” for that\nis a task “Congress has left to us.” Musick, Peeler, 508\nU. S., at 293, 294; see also id., at 292 (noting with ap­\nproval that “federal courts have accepted and exercised\nthe principal responsibility for the continuing elaboration\nof the scope of the 10b–5 right and the definition of the\nduties it imposes”). Indeed, we have unanimously en­\ndorsed the Second Circuit’s basic interpretive approach to\n§10(b)—ridiculed by the Court today—of striving to “di­\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

S., at 294.\n  Thus, while the Court devotes a considerable amount of\nattention to the development of the case law, ante, at 6–\n10, it draws the wrong conclusions. The Second Circuit\nrefined its test over several decades and dozens of cases,\nwith the tacit approval of Congress and the Commission\nand with the general assent of its sister Circuits. That\nhistory is a reason we should give additional weight to the\nSecond Circuit’s “judge-made” doctrine, not a reason to\ndenigrate it. “The longstanding acceptance by the courts,\ncoupled with Congress’ failure to reject [its] reasonable\ninterpretation of the wording of §10(b), . . . argues signifi­\ncantly in favor of acceptance of the [Second Circuit] rule\nby this Court.” Blue Chip, 421 U. S., at 733.\n                            II\n  The Court’s other main critique of the Second Circuit’s\napproach—apart from what the Court views as its exces­\nsive reliance on functional considerations and recon­\nstructed congressional intent—is that the Second Circuit\n——————\n  5 Even as the Court repeatedly declined to grant certiorari on cases\n\nraising the issue, individual Justices went further and endorsed the\nSecond Circuit’s basic approach to determining the transnational reach\nof §10(b). See, e.g., Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417 U. S. 506, 529–\n530 (1974) (Douglas, J., joined by Brennan, White, and Marshall, JJ.,\ndissenting) (“It has been recognized that the 1934 Act, including the\nprotections of Rule 10b–5, applies when foreign defendants have\ndefrauded American investors, particularly when . . . they have profited\nby virtue of proscribed conduct within our boundaries.

It is the Court, however, that misap­\nplies the presumption, in two main respects.\n   First, the Court seeks to transform the presumption\nfrom a flexible rule of thumb into something more like a\nclear statement rule. We have been here before. In the\ncase on which the Court primarily relies, EEOC v. Ara\nbian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244 (1991) (Aramco),\nChief Justice Rehnquist’s majority opinion included a\nsentence that appeared to make the same move. See id.,\nat 258 (“Congress’ awareness of the need to make a clear\nstatement that a statute applies overseas is amply demon­\nstrated by the numerous occasions on which it has ex­\npressly legislated the extraterritorial application of a\nstatute”). Justice Marshall, in dissent, vigorously ob­\njected. See id., at 261 (“[C]ontrary to what one would\nconclude from the majority’s analysis, this canon is not a\n‘clear statement’ rule, the application of which relieves a\ncourt of the duty to give effect to all available indicia of the\nlegislative will”).\n   Yet even Aramco—surely the most extreme application\nof the presumption against extraterritoriality in my time\non the Court6—contained numerous passages suggesting\nthat the presumption may be overcome without a clear\ndirective. See id., at 248–255 (majority opinion) (repeat­\nedly identifying congressional “intent” as the touchstone of\nthe presumption). And our cases both before and after\nAramco make perfectly clear that the Court continues to\ngive effect to “all available evidence about the meaning” of\na provision when considering its extraterritorial applica­\ntion, lest we defy Congress’ will.

Hence, while the Court’s\ndictum that “[w]hen a statute gives no clear indication of\nan extraterritorial application, it has none,” ante, at 6,\nmakes for a nice catchphrase, the point is overstated. The\npresumption against extraterritoriality can be useful as a\ntheory of congressional purpose, a tool for managing in­\nternational conflict, a background norm, a tiebreaker. It\ndoes not relieve courts of their duty to give statutes the\nmost faithful reading possible.\n   Second, and more fundamentally, the Court errs in\nsuggesting that the presumption against extraterritorial­\nity is fatal to the Second Circuit’s test. For even if the\npresumption really were a clear statement (or “clear indi­\ncation,” ante, at 6, 16) rule, it would have only marginal\nrelevance to this case.\n   It is true, of course, that “this Court ordinarily construes\n\n——————\n(1993) (declining to apply presumption in assessing question of\nSherman Act extraterritoriality); Smith v.

The Court also relies on Microsoft Corp. v.\nAT&T Corp., 550 U. S. 437, 455–456 (2007). Ante, at 16. Yet Micro\nsoft’s articulation of the presumption is a far cry from the Court’s rigid\ntheory. “As a principle of general application,” Microsoft innocuously\nobserved, “we have stated that courts should ‘assume that legislators\ntake account of the legitimate sovereign interests of other nations when\nthey write American laws.’ ” 550 U.

Berger, 322 F. 3d 187, 193 (CA2\n2003) (internal quotation marks omitted), or when the\nfraud was “ ‘intended to produce’ ” and did produce “ ‘det­\nrimental effects within’ ” the United States, Schoenbaum,\n405 F. 2d, at 206.10\n  This approach is consistent with the understanding\n——————\n  9 By  its terms, §10(b) regulates “interstate commerce,” 15 U. S. C.\n§78j, which the Exchange Act defines to include “trade, commerce,\ntransportation, or communication . . . between any foreign country and\nany State, or between any State and any place or ship outside thereof.”\n§78c(a)(17). Other provisions of the Exchange Act make clear that\nCongress contemplated some amount of transnational application. See,\ne.g., §78b(2) (stating, in explaining necessity for regulation, that “[t]he\nprices established and offered in [securities] transactions are generally\ndisseminated and quoted throughout the United States and foreign\ncountries and constitute a basis for determining and establishing the\nprices at which securities are bought and sold”); §78dd(b) (exempting\nfrom regulation foreign parties “unless” they transact business in\nsecurities “in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Com­\nmission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate to prevent the\nevasion of this chapter” (emphasis added)); see also Schoenbaum, 405\nF. 2d, at 206–208 (reviewing statutory text and legislative history).\nThe Court finds these textual references insufficient to overcome the\npresumption against extraterritoriality, ante, at 13–15, but as ex­\nplained in the main text, that finding rests upon the Court’s misappli­\ncation of the presumption.\n   10 The Government submits that a “transnational securities fraud\n\nviolates Section 10(b) if significant conduct material to the fraud’s\nsuccess occurs in the United States.” Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 6. I understand the Government’s submission to be largely a\nrepackaging of the “conduct” prong of the Second Circuit’s test. The\nGovernment expresses no view on that test’s “effects” prong, as the\ndecision below considered only respondents’ conduct. See id., at 15,\nn. 2; 547 F. 3d 167, 171 (CA2 2008).\n10     MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n               STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nshared by most scholars that Congress, in passing the\nExchange Act, “expected U. S. securities laws to apply to\ncertain international transactions or conduct.” Buxbaum,\nMultinational Class Actions Under Federal Securities\nLaw: Managing Jurisdictional Conflict, 46 Colum. J.\nTransnat’l L. 14, 19 (2007); see also Leasco Data Process\ning Equip. Corp. v. Maxwell, 468 F. 2d 1326, 1336 (CA2\n1972) (Friendly, J.) (detailing evidence that Congress\n“meant §10(b) to protect against fraud in the sale or pur­\nchase of securities whether or not these were traded on\norganized United States markets”). It is also consistent\nwith the traditional understanding, regnant in the 1930’s\nas it is now, that the presumption against extraterritorial­\nity does not apply “when the conduct [at issue] occurs\nwithin the United States,” and has lesser force when “the\nfailure to extend the scope of the statute to a foreign set­\nting will result in adverse effects within the United\nStates.” Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Massey, 986\nF. 2d 528, 531 (CADC 1993); accord, Restatement (Second)\nof Foreign Relations Law of the United States §38 (1964–\n1965); cf. Small v. United States, 544 U. S. 385, 400 (2005)\n(THOMAS, J., joined by SCALIA and KENNEDY, JJ., dissent­\ning) (presumption against extraterritoriality “lend[s] no\nsupport” to a “rule restricting a federal statute from reach­\ning conduct within U. S. borders”); Continental Ore Co. v.\nUnion Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U. S. 690, 705 (1962)\n(presumption against extraterritoriality not controlling\n“[s]ince the activities of the defendants had an impact\nwithin the United States and upon its foreign trade”).\nAnd it strikes a reasonable balance between the goals of\n“preventing the export of fraud from America,” protecting\nshareholders, enhancing investor confidence, and deter­\nring corporate misconduct, on the one hand, and conserv­\ning United States resources and limiting conflict with\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

I do\nnot take issue with the Court for beginning its inquiry\nwith the statutory text, rather than the doctrine in the\nCourts of Appeals. Cf. ante, at 18, n. 9. I take issue with\nthe Court for beginning and ending its inquiry with the\nstatutory text, when the text does not speak with geo­\ngraphic precision, and for dismissing the long pedigree of,\nand the persuasive account of congressional intent embod­\nied in, the Second Circuit’s rule.\n   Repudiating the Second Circuit’s approach in its en­\ntirety, the Court establishes a novel rule that will foreclose\nprivate parties from bringing §10(b) actions whenever the\nrelevant securities were purchased or sold abroad and are\nnot listed on a domestic exchange.12 The real motor of the\n——————\n  11 Given its focus on “domestic conditions,” Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo,\n\n336 U. S. 281, 285 (1949), I expect that virtually all “ ‘foreign-cubed’ ”\nactions—actions in which “(1) foreign plaintiffs [are] suing (2) a foreign\nissuer in an American court for violations of American securities laws\nbased on securities transactions in (3) foreign countries,” 547 F. 3d, at\n172—would fail the Second Circuit’s test. As they generally should.\nUnder these circumstances, the odds of the fraud having a substantial\nconnection to the United States are low. In recognition of the Exchange\nAct’s focus on American investors and the novelty of foreign-cubed\nlawsuits, and in the interest of promoting clarity, it might have been\nappropriate to incorporate one bright line into the Second Circuit’s test,\nby categorically excluding such lawsuits from §10(b)’s ambit.\n  12 The Court’s opinion does not, however, foreclose the Commission\n\nfrom bringing enforcement actions in additional circumstances, as no\nissue concerning the Commission’s authority is presented by this case.\nThe Commission’s enforcement proceedings not only differ from private\n§10(b) actions in numerous potentially relevant respects, see Brief for\n12       MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nCourt’s opinion, it seems, is not the presumption against\nextraterritoriality but rather the Court’s belief that trans­\nactions on domestic exchanges are “the focus of the Ex­\nchange Act” and “the objects of [its] solicitude.” Ante, at\n17, 18. In reality, however, it is the “public interest” and\n“the interests of investors” that are the objects of the\nstatute’s solicitude. Europe & Overseas Commodity Trad\ners, S. A. v. Banque Paribas London, 147 F. 3d 118, 125\n(CA2 1998) (citing H. R. Rep. No. 1838, 73d Cong., 2d\nSess., 32–33 (1934)); see also Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485\nU. S. 224, 230 (1988) (“The 1934 Act was designed to\nprotect investors against manipulation of stock prices”\n(citing S. Rep. No. 792, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 1–5 (1934));\nErnst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 195 (1976)\n(“The 1934 Act was intended principally to protect inves­\ntors . . . ”); S. Rep.

And while the clarity and simplicity of the\nCourt’s test may have some salutary consequences, like all\nbright-line rules it also has drawbacks.\n   Imagine, for example, an American investor who buys\nshares in a company listed only on an overseas exchange.\nThat company has a major American subsidiary with\nexecutives based in New York City; and it was in New\nYork City that the executives masterminded and imple­\nmented a massive deception which artificially inflated the\nstock price—and which will, upon its disclosure, cause the\n——————\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 12–13, but they also pose a lesser\nthreat to international comity, id., at 26–27; cf.

Government’ ” (quoting Griffin, Extra­\nterritoriality in U. S. and EU Antitrust Enforcement, 67 Antitrust L. J.\n159, 194 (1999); alteration in original)).\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

Or, imagine that those same executives\ngo knocking on doors in Manhattan and convince an unso­\nphisticated retiree, on the basis of material misrepresen­\ntations, to invest her life savings in the company’s doomed\nsecurities. Both of these investors would, under the\nCourt’s new test, be barred from seeking relief under\n§10(b).\n  The oddity of that result should give pause. For in\nwalling off such individuals from §10(b), the Court nar­\nrows the provision’s reach to a degree that would surprise\nand alarm generations of American investors—and, I am\nconvinced, the Congress that passed the Exchange Act.\nIndeed, the Court’s rule turns §10(b) jurisprudence (and\nthe presumption against extraterritoriality) on its head,\nby withdrawing the statute’s application from cases in\nwhich there is both substantial wrongful conduct that\noccurred in the United States and a substantial injurious\neffect on United States markets and citizens.\n                             III\n   In my judgment, if petitioners’ allegations of fraudulent\nmisconduct that took place in Florida are true, then re­\nspondents may have violated §10(b), and could potentially\nbe held accountable in an enforcement proceeding brought\nby the Commission. But it does not follow that sharehold­\ners who have failed to allege that the bulk or the heart of\nthe fraud occurred in the United States, or that the fraud\nhad an adverse impact on American investors or markets,\nmay maintain a private action to recover damages they\nsuffered abroad. Some cases involving foreign securities\ntransactions have extensive links to, and ramifications for,\nthis country; this case has Australia written all over it.\nAccordingly, for essentially the reasons stated in the Court\nof Appeals’ opinion, I would affirm its judgment.\n   The Court instead elects to upend a significant area of\nsecurities law based on a plausible, but hardly decisive,\n14     MORRISON v. NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD.\n\n              STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nconstruction of the statutory text. In so doing, it pays\nshort shrift to the United States’ interest in remedying\nfrauds that transpire on American soil or harm American\ncitizens, as well as to the accumulated wisdom and experi­\nence of the lower courts. I happen to agree with the result\nthe Court reaches in this case. But “I respectfully dis­\nsent,” once again, “from the Court’s continuing campaign\nto render the private cause of action under §10(b)\ntoothless.” Stoneridge, 552 U.
