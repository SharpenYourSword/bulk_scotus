KAPPOS, UNDER SECRETARY OF \n\n  COMMERCE FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND \n\n    DIRECTOR, PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 08–964.      Argued November 9, 2009—Decided June 28, 2010\nPetitioners’ patent application seeks protection for a claimed invention\n  that explains how commodities buyers and sellers in the energy mar\n  ket can protect, or hedge, against the risk of price changes. The key\n  claims are claim 1, which describes a series of steps instructing how\n  to hedge risk, and claim 4, which places the claim 1 concept into a\n  simple mathematical formula. The remaining claims explain how\n  claims 1 and 4 can be applied to allow energy suppliers and consum\n  ers to minimize the risks resulting from fluctuations in market de\n  mand. The patent examiner rejected the application on the grounds\n  that the invention is not implemented on a specific apparatus, merely\n  manipulates an abstract idea, and solves a purely mathematical\n  problem. The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences agreed and\n  affirmed. The Federal Circuit, in turn, affirmed. The en banc court\n  rejected its prior test for determining whether a claimed invention\n  was a patentable “process” under Patent Act, 35 U. S. C. §101—i.e.,\n  whether the invention produced a “useful, concrete, and tangible re\n  sult,” see, e.g., State Street Bank & Trust Co v. Signature Financial\n  Group, Inc., 149 F. 3d 1368, 1373—holding instead that a claimed\n  process is patent eligible if: (1) it is tied to a particular machine or\n  apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a different\n  state or thing. Concluding that this “machine-or-transformation test”\n  is the sole test for determining patent eligibility of a “process” under\n  §101, the court applied the test and held that the application was not\n  patent eligible.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n2                          BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n545 F. 3d 943, affirmed.\n     JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to\n  Parts II–B–2 and II–C–2, concluding that petitioners’ claimed inven\n  tion is not patent eligible. Pp. 4–8, 10–11, 12–16.\n     (a) Section 101 specifies four independent categories of inventions\n  or discoveries that are patent eligible: “process[es],” “machin[es],”\n  “manufactur[es],” and “composition[s] of matter.” “In choosing such\n  expansive terms, . . . Congress plainly contemplated that the patent\n  laws would be given wide scope,” Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S.\n  303, 308, in order to ensure that “ ‘ingenuity should receive a liberal\n  encouragement,’ ” id., at 308–309. This Court’s precedents provide\n  three specific exceptions to §101’s broad principles: “laws of nature,\n  physical phenomena, and abstract ideas.” Id., at 309. While not re\n  quired by the statutory text, these exceptions are consistent with the\n  notion that a patentable process must be “new and useful.” And, in\n  any case, the exceptions have defined the statute’s reach as a matter\n  of statutory stare decisis going back 150 years. See Le Roy v.\n  Tatham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87271\"><a href=\"/opinion/87271/le-roy-v-tatham/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 174. The §101 eligibility inquiry is only a\n  threshold test. Even if a claimed invention qualifies in one of the\n  four categories, it must also satisfy “the conditions and requirements\n  of this title,” §101(a), including novelty, see §102, nonobviousness, see\n  §103, and a full and particular description, see §112. The invention\n  at issue is claimed to be a “process,” which §100(b) defines as a “proc\n  ess, art or method, and includes a new use of a known process, ma\n  chine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material.” Pp. 4–5.\n     (b) The machine-or-transformation test is not the sole test for pat\n  ent eligibility under §101. The Court’s precedents establish that al\n  though that test may be a useful and important clue or investigative\n  tool, it is not the sole test for deciding whether an invention is a pat\n  ent-eligible “process” under §101. In holding to the contrary, the\n  Federal Circuit violated two principles of statutory interpretation:\n  Courts “ ‘should not read into the patent laws limitations and condi\n  tions which the legislature has not expressed,’ ” Diamond v. Diehr,\n  450 U. S. 175, 182, and, “[u]nless otherwise defined, ‘words will be in\n  terpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common mean\n  ing,’ ” ibid. The Court is unaware of any ordinary, contemporary,\n  common meaning of “process” that would require it to be tied to a\n  machine or the transformation of an article. Respondent Patent Di\n  rector urges the Court to read §101’s other three patentable catego\n  ries as confining “process” to a machine or transformation. However,\n  the doctrine of noscitur a sociis is inapplicable here, for §100(b) al\n  ready explicitly defines “process,” see Burgess v. United States, 553\n  U. S. 124, 130, and nothing about the section’s inclusion of those\n  other categories suggests that a “process” must be tied to one of them.\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nFinally, the Federal Circuit incorrectly concluded that this Court has\nendorsed the machine-or-transformation test as the exclusive test.\nRecent authorities show that the test was never intended to be ex\nhaustive or exclusive. See, e.g., Parker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584, 588,\nn. 9. Pp. 5–8.\n   (c) Section 101 similarly precludes a reading of the term “process”\nthat would categorically exclude business methods.            The term\n“method” within §100(b)’s “process” definition, at least as a textual\nmatter and before other consulting other Patent Act limitations and\nthis Court’s precedents, may include at least some methods of doing\nbusiness. The Court is unaware of any argument that the “ordinary,\ncontemporary, common meaning,” Diehr, supra, at 182, of “method”\nexcludes business methods. Nor is it clear what a business method\nexception would sweep in and whether it would exclude technologies\nfor conducting a business more efficiently. The categorical exclusion\nargument is further undermined by the fact that federal law explic\nitly contemplates the existence of at least some business method pat\nents: Under §273(b)(1), if a patent-holder claims infringement based\non “a method in [a] patent,” the alleged infringer can assert a defense\nof prior use. By allowing this defense, the statute itself acknowledges\nthat there may be business method patents. Section 273 thus clari\nfies the understanding that a business method is simply one kind of\n“method” that is, at least in some circumstances, eligible for patent\ning under §101. A contrary conclusion would violate the canon\nagainst interpreting any statutory provision in a manner that would\nrender another provision superfluous. See Corley v. United States,\n556 U. S. ___, ___. Finally, while §273 appears to leave open the pos\nsibility of some business method patents, it does not suggest broad\npatentability of such claimed inventions. Pp. 10–11.\n   (d) Even though petitioners’ application is not categorically outside\nof §101 under the two atextual approaches the Court rejects today,\nthat does not mean it is a “process” under §101. Petitioners seek to\npatent both the concept of hedging risk and the application of that\nconcept to energy markets. Under Benson, Flook, and Diehr, how\never, these are not patentable processes but attempts to patent ab\nstract ideas. Claims 1 and 4 explain the basic concept of hedging and\nreduce that concept to a mathematical formula. This is an unpat\nentable abstract idea, just like the algorithms at issue in Benson and\nFlook. Petitioners’ remaining claims, broad examples of how hedging\ncan be used in commodities and energy markets, attempt to patent\nthe use of the abstract hedging idea, then instruct the use of well\nknown random analysis techniques to help establish some of the in\nputs into the equation. They add even less to the underlying abstract\nprinciple than the invention held patent ineligible in Flook. Pp. 12–\n4                            BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    15.\n      (e) Because petitioners’ patent application can be rejected under\n    the Court’s precedents on the unpatentability of abstract ideas, the\n    Court need not define further what constitutes a patentable “proc\n    ess,” beyond pointing to the definition of that term provided in\n    §100(b) and looking to the guideposts in Benson, Flook, and Diehr.\n    Nothing in today’s opinion should be read as endorsing the Federal\n    Circuit’s past interpretations of §101. See, e.g., State Street, 49 F. 3d,\n    at 1373. The appeals court may have thought it needed to make the\n    machine-or-transformation test exclusive precisely because its case\n    law had not adequately identified less extreme means of restricting\n    business method patents. In disapproving an exclusive machine-or\n    transformation test, this Court by no means desires to preclude the\n    Federal Circuit’s development of other limiting criteria that further\n    the Patent Act’s purposes and are not inconsistent with its text.\n    P. 16.\n\n  KENNEDY, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, except for Parts II–\nB–2 and II–C–2.

The patent application claims a procedure for\ninstructing buyers and sellers how to protect against the\nrisk of price fluctuations in a discrete section of the econ\nomy. Three arguments are advanced for the proposition\nthat the claimed invention is outside the scope of patent\nlaw: (1) it is not tied to a machine and does not transform\nan article; (2) it involves a method of conducting business;\nand (3) it is merely an abstract idea. The Court of Appeals\nruled that the first mentioned of these, the so-called ma\nchine-or-transformation test, was the sole test to be used\nfor determining the patentability of a “process” under the\nPatent Act, 35 U. S. C. §101.\n\n——————\n * JUSTICE SCALIA does not join Parts II–B–2 and II–C–2.\n2                    BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              I\n  Petitioners’ application seeks patent protection for a\nclaimed invention that explains how buyers and sellers of\ncommodities in the energy market can protect, or hedge,\nagainst the risk of price changes. The key claims are\nclaims 1 and 4. Claim 1 describes a series of steps in\nstructing how to hedge risk. Claim 4 puts the concept\narticulated in claim 1 into a simple mathematical formula.\nClaim 1 consists of the following steps:\n       “(a) initiating a series of transactions between said\n    commodity provider and consumers of said commodity\n    wherein said consumers purchase said commodity at a\n    fixed rate based upon historical averages, said fixed\n    rate corresponding to a risk position of said consum\n    ers;\n       “(b) identifying market participants for said com\n    modity having a counter-risk position to said consum\n    ers; and\n       “(c) initiating a series of transactions between said\n    commodity provider and said market participants at a\n    second fixed rate such that said series of market par\n    ticipant transactions balances the risk position of said\n    series of consumer transactions.” App. 19–20.\nThe remaining claims explain how claims 1 and 4 can be\napplied to allow energy suppliers and consumers to mini\nmize the risks resulting from fluctuations in market de\nmand for energy. For example, claim 2 claims “[t]he\nmethod of claim 1 wherein said commodity is energy and\nsaid market participants are transmission distributors.”\nId., at 20. Some of these claims also suggest familiar\nstatistical approaches to determine the inputs to use in\nclaim 4’s equation. For example, claim 7 advises using\nwell-known random analysis techniques to determine how\nmuch a seller will gain “from each transaction under each\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhistorical weather pattern.” Id., at 21.\n   The patent examiner rejected petitioners’ application,\nexplaining that it “ ‘is not implemented on a specific appa\nratus and merely manipulates [an] abstract idea and\nsolves a purely mathematical problem without any limita\ntion to a practical application, therefore, the invention is\nnot directed to the technological arts.’ ” App. to Pet. for\nCert. 148a. The Board of Patent Appeals and Interfer\nences affirmed, concluding that the application involved\nonly mental steps that do not transform physical matter\nand was directed to an abstract idea. Id., at 181a–186a.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit heard the case en banc and affirmed. The case\nproduced five different opinions. Students of patent law\nwould be well advised to study these scholarly opinions.\n   Chief Judge Michel wrote the opinion of the court. The\ncourt rejected its prior test for determining whether a\nclaimed invention was a patentable “process” under\n§101—whether it produces a “ ‘useful, concrete, and tangi\nble result’ ”—as articulated in State Street Bank & Trust\nCo. v. Signature Financial Group, Inc., 149 F. 3d 1368,\n1373 (1998), and AT&T Corp. v. Excel Communications,\nInc., 172 F. 3d 1352, 1357 (1999). See In re Bilski, 545\nF. 3d 943, 959–960, and n. 19 (CA Fed. 2008) (en banc).\nThe court held that “[a] claimed process is surely patent\neligible under §101 if: (1) it is tied to a particular machine\nor apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a\ndifferent state or thing.” Id., at 954. The court concluded\nthis “machine-or-transformation test” is “the sole test\ngoverning §101 analyses,” id., at 955, and thus the “test\nfor determining patent eligibility of a process under §101,”\nid., at 956. Applying the machine-or-transformation test,\nthe court held that petitioners’ application was not patent\neligible. Id., at 963–966. Judge Dyk wrote a separate\nconcurring opinion, providing historical support for the\n4                    BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt’s approach. Id., at 966–976.\n  Three judges wrote dissenting opinions. Judge Mayer\nargued that petitioners’ application was “not eligible for\npatent protection because it is directed to a method of\nconducting business.” Id., at 998. He urged the adoption\nof a “technological standard for patentability.” Id., at\n1010. Judge Rader would have found petitioners’ claims\nwere an unpatentable abstract idea. Id., at 1011. Only\nJudge Newman disagreed with the court’s conclusion that\npetitioners’ application was outside of the reach of §101.\nShe did not say that the application should have been\ngranted but only that the issue should be remanded for\nfurther proceedings to determine whether the application\nqualified as patentable under other provisions. Id., at 997.\n  This Court granted certiorari. 556 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                           II\n                           A\n  Section 101 defines the subject matter that may be\npatented under the Patent Act:\n      “Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful\n    process, machine, manufacture, or composition of\n    matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof,\n    may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions\n    and requirements of this title.”\nSection 101 thus specifies four independent categories of\ninventions or discoveries that are eligible for protection:\nprocesses, machines, manufactures, and compositions of\nmatter. “In choosing such expansive terms . . . modified by\nthe comprehensive ‘any,’ Congress plainly contemplated\nthat the patent laws would be given wide scope.” Dia\nmond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, 308 (1980). Congress\ntook this permissive approach to patent eligibility to en\nsure that “ ‘ingenuity should receive a liberal encourage\nment.’ ” Id., at 308–309 (quoting 5 Writings of Thomas\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nJefferson 75–76 (H. Washington ed. 1871)).\n   The Court’s precedents provide three specific exceptions\nto §101’s broad patent-eligibility principles: “laws of na\nture, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas.” Chakra\nbarty, supra, at 309. While these exceptions are not re\nquired by the statutory text, they are consistent with the\nnotion that a patentable process must be “new and useful.”\nAnd, in any case, these exceptions have defined the reach\nof the statute as a matter of statutory stare decisis going\nback 150 years. See Le Roy v. Tatham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87271\"><a href=\"/opinion/87271/le-roy-v-tatham/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 174–\n175 (1853). The concepts covered by these exceptions are\n“part of the storehouse of knowledge of all men . . . free to\nall men and reserved exclusively to none.” Funk Brothers\nSeed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U. S. 127, 130 (1948).\n   The §101 patent-eligibility inquiry is only a threshold\ntest. Even if an invention qualifies as a process, machine,\nmanufacture, or composition of matter, in order to receive\nthe Patent Act’s protection the claimed invention must\nalso satisfy “the conditions and requirements of this title.”\n§101. Those requirements include that the invention be\nnovel, see §102, nonobvious, see §103, and fully and par\nticularly described, see §112.\n   The present case involves an invention that is claimed\nto be a “process” under §101. Section 100(b) defines “proc\ness” as:\n    “process, art or method, and includes a new use of a\n    known process, machine, manufacture, composition of\n    matter, or material.”\nThe Court first considers two proposed categorical limita\ntions on “process” patents under §101 that would, if\nadopted, bar petitioners’ application in the present case:\nthe machine-or-transformation test and the categorical\nexclusion of business method patents.\n6                     BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                                 B\n                                 1\n   Under the Court of Appeals’ formulation, an invention is\na “process” only if: “(1) it is tied to a particular machine or\napparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a\ndifferent state or thing.” 545 F. 3d, at 954. This Court\nhas “more than once cautioned that courts ‘should not read\ninto the patent laws limitations and conditions which the\nlegislature has not expressed.’ ” Diamond v. Diehr, 450\nU. S. 175, 182 (1981) (quoting Chakrabarty, supra, at 308;\nsome internal quotation marks omitted). In patent law, as\nin all statutory construction, “[u]nless otherwise defined,\n‘words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, con\ntemporary, common meaning.’ ” Diehr, supra, at 182\n(quoting Perrin v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42 (1979)).\nThe Court has read the §101 term “manufacture” in accor\ndance with dictionary definitions, see Chakrabarty, supra,\nat 308 (citing American Fruit Growers, Inc. v. Brogdex Co.,\n283 U. S. 1, 11 (1931)), and approved a construction of the\nterm “composition of matter” consistent with common\nusage, see Chakrabarty, supra, at 308 (citing Shell Devel\nopment Co. v. Watson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1893837\"><a href=\"/opinion/1893837/shell-development-company-v-watson/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 280 (DC 1957)).\n   Any suggestion in this Court’s case law that the Patent\nAct’s terms deviate from their ordinary meaning has only\nbeen an explanation for the exceptions for laws of nature,\nphysical phenomena, and abstract ideas. See Parker v.\nFlook, 437 U. S. 584, 588–589 (1978). This Court has not\nindicated that the existence of these well-established\nexceptions gives the Judiciary carte blanche to impose\nother limitations that are inconsistent with the text and\nthe statute’s purpose and design. Concerns about at\ntempts to call any form of human activity a “process” can\nbe met by making sure the claim meets the requirements\nof §101.\n   Adopting the machine-or-transformation test as the sole\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntest for what constitutes a “process” (as opposed to just an\nimportant and useful clue) violates these statutory inter\npretation principles. Section 100(b) provides that “[t]he\nterm ‘process’ means process, art or method, and includes\na new use of a known process, machine, manufacture,\ncomposition of matter, or material.” The Court is unaware\nof any “ ‘ordinary, contemporary, common meaning,’ ”\nDiehr, supra, at 182, of the definitional terms “process, art\nor method” that would require these terms to be tied to a\nmachine or to transform an article. Respondent urges the\nCourt to look to the other patentable categories in §101—\nmachines, manufactures, and compositions of matter—to\nconfine the meaning of “process” to a machine or trans\nformation, under the doctrine of noscitur a sociis. Under\nthis canon, “an ambiguous term may be given more precise\ncontent by the neighboring words with which it is associ\nated.” United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 12) (internal quotation marks omitted). This\ncanon is inapplicable here, for §100(b) already explicitly\ndefines the term “process.” See Burgess v. United States,\n553 U. S. 124, 130 (2008) (“When a statute includes an\nexplicit definition, we must follow that definition” (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted)).\n   The Court of Appeals incorrectly concluded that this\nCourt has endorsed the machine-or-transformation test as\nthe exclusive test. It is true that Cochrane v. Deener, 94\nU. S. 780, 788 (1877), explained that a “process” is “an act,\nor a series of acts, performed upon the subject-matter to be\ntransformed and reduced to a different state or thing.”\nMore recent cases, however, have rejected the broad impli\ncations of this dictum; and, in all events, later authority\nshows that it was not intended to be an exhaustive or\nexclusive test. Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63, 70\n(1972), noted that “[t]ransformation and reduction of an\narticle ‘to a different state or thing’ is the clue to the pat\n8                     BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                    Opinion of Kthe Court\n                     Opinion of ENNEDY, J.\n\nentability of a process claim that does not include particu\nlar machines.” At the same time, it explicitly declined to\n“hold that no process patent could ever qualify if it did not\nmeet [machine or transformation] requirements.” Id., at\n71. Flook took a similar approach, “assum[ing] that a\nvalid process patent may issue even if it does not meet\n[the machine-or-transformation test].” 437 U. S., at 588,\nn. 9.\n  This Court’s precedents establish that the machine-or\ntransformation test is a useful and important clue, an\ninvestigative tool, for determining whether some claimed\ninventions are processes under §101. The machine-or\ntransformation test is not the sole test for deciding\nwhether an invention is a patent-eligible “process.”\n                               2\n  It is true that patents for inventions that did not satisfy\nthe machine-or-transformation test were rarely granted in\nearlier eras, especially in the Industrial Age, as explained\nby Judge Dyk’s thoughtful historical review. See 545\nF. 3d, at 966–976 (concurring opinion). But times change.\nTechnology and other innovations progress in unexpected\nways. For example, it was once forcefully argued that\nuntil recent times, “well-established principles of patent\nlaw probably would have prevented the issuance of a valid\npatent on almost any conceivable computer program.”\nDiehr, 450 U. S., at 195 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). But\nthis fact does not mean that unforeseen innovations such\nas computer programs are always unpatentable. See id.,\nat 192–193 (majority opinion) (holding a procedure for\nmolding rubber that included a computer program is\nwithin patentable subject matter). Section 101 is a “dy\nnamic provision designed to encompass new and unfore\nseen inventions.” J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-\nBred Int’l, Inc., 534 U. S. 124, 135 (2001). A categorical\nrule denying patent protection for “inventions in areas not\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

S., at 315.\n   The machine-or-transformation test may well provide a\nsufficient basis for evaluating processes similar to those in\nthe Industrial Age—for example, inventions grounded in a\nphysical or other tangible form. But there are reasons to\ndoubt whether the test should be the sole criterion for\ndetermining the patentability of inventions in the Infor\nmation Age. As numerous amicus briefs argue, the ma\nchine-or-transformation test would create uncertainty as\nto the patentability of software, advanced diagnostic medi\ncine techniques, and inventions based on linear program\nming, data compression, and the manipulation of digital\nsignals. See, e.g., Brief for Business Software Alliance 24–\n25; Brief for Biotechnology Industry Organization et al.\n14–27; Brief for Boston Patent Law Association 8–15;\nBrief for Houston Intellectual Property Law Association\n17–22; Brief for Dolby Labs., Inc., et al. 9–10.\n   In the course of applying the machine-or-transformation\ntest to emerging technologies, courts may pose questions\nof such intricacy and refinement that they risk obscuring\nthe larger object of securing patents for valuable inven\ntions without transgressing the public domain. The dis\nsent by Judge Rader refers to some of these difficulties.\n545 F. 3d, at 1015. As a result, in deciding whether previ\nously unforeseen inventions qualify as patentable “proc\ness[es],” it may not make sense to require courts to confine\nthemselves to asking the questions posed by the machine\nor-transformation test. Section 101’s terms suggest that\nnew technologies may call for new inquiries. See Benson,\nsupra, at 71 (to “freeze process patents to old technologies,\nleaving no room for the revelations of the new, onrushing\ntechnology[,] . . . is not our purpose”).\n   It is important to emphasize that the Court today is not\ncommenting on the patentability of any particular inven\n10                   BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion, let alone holding that any of the above-mentioned\ntechnologies from the Information Age should or should\nnot receive patent protection. This Age puts the possibil\nity of innovation in the hands of more people and raises\nnew difficulties for the patent law. With ever more people\ntrying to innovate and thus seeking patent protections for\ntheir inventions, the patent law faces a great challenge in\nstriking the balance between protecting inventors and not\ngranting monopolies over procedures that others would\ndiscover by independent, creative application of general\nprinciples. Nothing in this opinion should be read to take\na position on where that balance ought to be struck.\n                               C\n                               1\n   Section 101 similarly precludes the broad contention\nthat the term “process” categorically excludes business\nmethods. The term “method,” which is within §100(b)’s\ndefinition of “process,” at least as a textual matter and\nbefore consulting other limitations in the Patent Act and\nthis Court’s precedents, may include at least some meth\nods of doing business. See, e.g., Webster’s New Interna\ntional Dictionary 1548 (2d ed. 1954) (defining “method” as\n“[a]n orderly procedure or process . . . regular way or\nmanner of doing anything; hence, a set form of procedure\nadopted in investigation or instruction”). The Court is\nunaware of any argument that the “ ‘ordinary, contempo\nrary, common meaning,’ ” Diehr, supra, at 182, of “method”\nexcludes business methods. Nor is it clear how far a pro\nhibition on business method patents would reach, and\nwhether it would exclude technologies for conducting a\nbusiness more efficiently. See, e.g., Hall, Business and\nFinancial Method Patents, Innovation, and Policy, 56\nScottish J. Pol. Econ. 443, 445 (2009) (“There is no precise\ndefinition of . . . business method patents”).\n   The argument that business methods are categorically\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of Kthe Court\n                      Opinion of ENNEDY, J.\n\noutside of §101’s scope is further undermined by the fact\nthat federal law explicitly contemplates the existence of at\nleast some business method patents. Under 35 U. S. C.\n§273(b)(1), if a patent-holder claims infringement based on\n“a method in [a] patent,” the alleged infringer can assert a\ndefense of prior use. For purposes of this defense alone,\n“method” is defined as “a method of doing or conducting\nbusiness.” §273(a)(3). In other words, by allowing this\ndefense the statute itself acknowledges that there may be\nbusiness method patents. Section 273’s definition of\n“method,” to be sure, cannot change the meaning of a\nprior-enacted statute. But what §273 does is clarify the\nunderstanding that a business method is simply one kind\nof “method” that is, at least in some circumstances, eligible\nfor patenting under §101.\n   A conclusion that business methods are not patentable\nin any circumstances would render §273 meaningless.\nThis would violate the canon against interpreting any\nstatutory provision in a manner that would render an\nother provision superfluous. See Corley v. United States,\n556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 9). This principle, of\ncourse, applies to interpreting any two provisions in the\nU. S. Code, even when Congress enacted the provisions at\ndifferent times. See, e.g., Hague v. Committee for Indus\ntrial Organization, 307 U. S. 496, 529–530 (1939) (opinion\nof Stone, J.). This established rule of statutory interpreta\ntion cannot be overcome by judicial speculation as to the\nsubjective intent of various legislators in enacting the\nsubsequent provision. Finally, while §273 appears to\nleave open the possibility of some business method pat\nents, it does not suggest broad patentability of such\nclaimed inventions.\n                            2\n  Interpreting §101 to exclude all business methods sim\nply because business method patents were rarely issued\n12                   BILSKI v.

At the same time,\nsome business method patents raise special problems in\nterms of vagueness and suspect validity. See eBay Inc. v.\nMercExchange, L. L. C., 547 U. S. 388, 397 (2006)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring). The Information Age empow\ners people with new capacities to perform statistical\nanalyses and mathematical calculations with a speed and\nsophistication that enable the design of protocols for more\nefficient performance of a vast number of business tasks.\nIf a high enough bar is not set when considering patent\napplications of this sort, patent examiners and courts\ncould be flooded with claims that would put a chill on\ncreative endeavor and dynamic change.\n   In searching for a limiting principle, this Court’s prece\ndents on the unpatentability of abstract ideas provide\nuseful tools. See infra, at 12–15. Indeed, if the Court of\nAppeals were to succeed in defining a narrower category\nor class of patent applications that claim to instruct how\nbusiness should be conducted, and then rule that the\ncategory is unpatentable because, for instance, it repre\nsents an attempt to patent abstract ideas, this conclusion\nmight well be in accord with controlling precedent. See\nibid. But beyond this or some other limitation consistent\nwith the statutory text, the Patent Act leaves open the\npossibility that there are at least some processes that can\nbe fairly described as business methods that are within\npatentable subject matter under §101.\n   Finally, even if a particular business method fits into\nthe statutory definition of a “process,” that does not mean\nthat the application claiming that method should be\ngranted.     In order to receive patent protection, any\nclaimed invention must be novel, §102, nonobvious, §103,\nand fully and particularly described, §112. These limita\ntions serve a critical role in adjusting the tension, ever\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Petitioners seek to patent both\nthe concept of hedging risk and the application of that\nconcept to energy markets. App. 19–20. Rather than\nadopting categorical rules that might have wide-ranging\nand unforeseen impacts, the Court resolves this case\nnarrowly on the basis of this Court’s decisions in Benson,\nFlook, and Diehr, which show that petitioners’ claims are\nnot patentable processes because they are attempts to\npatent abstract ideas. Indeed, all members of the Court\nagree that the patent application at issue here falls out\nside of §101 because it claims an abstract idea.\n    In Benson, the Court considered whether a patent appli\ncation for an algorithm to convert binary-coded decimal\nnumerals into pure binary code was a “process” under\n§101. 409 U. S., at 64–67. The Court first explained that\n“ ‘[a] principle, in the abstract, is a fundamental truth; an\noriginal cause; a motive; these cannot be patented, as no\none can claim in either of them an exclusive right.’ ” Id., at\n67 (quoting Le Roy, 14 How., at 175). The Court then held\nthe application at issue was not a “process,” but an unpat\nentable abstract idea. “It is conceded that one may not\npatent an idea. But in practical effect that would be the\nresult if the formula for converting . . . numerals to pure\nbinary numerals were patented in this case.” 409 U. S., at\n71. A contrary holding “would wholly pre-empt the\nmathematical formula and in practical effect would be a\npatent on the algorithm itself.” Id., at 72.\n    In Flook, the Court considered the next logical step after\n14                    BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nBenson. The applicant there attempted to patent a proce\ndure for monitoring the conditions during the catalytic\nconversion process in the petrochemical and oil-refining\nindustries. The application’s only innovation was reliance\non a mathematical algorithm. 437 U. S., at 585–586.\nFlook held the invention was not a patentable “process.”\nThe Court conceded the invention at issue, unlike the\nalgorithm in Benson, had been limited so that it could still\nbe freely used outside the petrochemical and oil-refining\nindustries. 437 U. S., at 589–590. Nevertheless, Flook\nrejected “[t]he notion that post-solution activity, no matter\nhow conventional or obvious in itself, can transform an\nunpatentable principle into a patentable process.” Id., at\n590. The Court concluded that the process at issue there\nwas “unpatentable under §101, not because it contain[ed]\na mathematical algorithm as one component, but because\nonce that algorithm [wa]s assumed to be within the prior\nart, the application, considered as a whole, contain[ed] no\npatentable invention.” Id., at 594. As the Court later\nexplained, Flook stands for the proposition that the prohi\nbition against patenting abstract ideas “cannot be circum\nvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula to a\nparticular technological environment” or adding “insignifi\ncant postsolution activity.” Diehr, 450 U. S., at 191–192.\n  Finally, in Diehr, the Court established a limitation on\nthe principles articulated in Benson and Flook. The appli\ncation in Diehr claimed a previously unknown method for\n“molding raw, uncured synthetic rubber into cured preci\nsion products,” using a mathematical formula to complete\nsome of its several steps by way of a computer. 450 U. S.,\nat 177. Diehr explained that while an abstract idea, law of\nnature, or mathematical formula could not be patented,\n“an application of a law of nature or mathematical for\nmula to a known structure or process may well be deserv\ning of patent protection.” Id., at 187. Diehr emphasized\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe need to consider the invention as a whole, rather than\n“dissect[ing] the claims into old and new elements and\nthen . . . ignor[ing] the presence of the old elements in the\nanalysis.” Id., at 188. Finally, the Court concluded that\nbecause the claim was not “an attempt to patent a\nmathematical formula, but rather [was] an industrial\nprocess for the molding of rubber products,” it fell within\n§101’s patentable subject matter. Id., at 192–193.\n   In light of these precedents, it is clear that petitioners’\napplication is not a patentable “process.” Claims 1 and 4\nin petitioners’ application explain the basic concept of\nhedging, or protecting against risk: “Hedging is a funda\nmental economic practice long prevalent in our system of\ncommerce and taught in any introductory finance class.”\n545 F. 3d, at 1013 (Rader, J., dissenting); see, e.g., D.\nChorafas, Introduction to Derivative Financial Instru\nments 75–94 (2008); C. Stickney, R. Weil, K. Schipper, &\nJ. Francis, Financial Accounting: An Introduction to Con\ncepts, Methods, and Uses 581–582 (13th ed. 2010); S.\nRoss, R. Westerfield, & B. Jordan, Fundamentals of Cor\nporate Finance 743–744 (8th ed. 2008). The concept of\nhedging, described in claim 1 and reduced to a mathemati\ncal formula in claim 4, is an unpatentable abstract idea,\njust like the algorithms at issue in Benson and Flook.\nAllowing petitioners to patent risk hedging would pre\nempt use of this approach in all fields, and would effec\ntively grant a monopoly over an abstract idea.\n   Petitioners’ remaining claims are broad examples of how\nhedging can be used in commodities and energy markets.\nFlook established that limiting an abstract idea to one\nfield of use or adding token postsolution components did\nnot make the concept patentable. That is exactly what the\nremaining claims in petitioners’ application do. These\nclaims attempt to patent the use of the abstract idea of\nhedging risk in the energy market and then instruct the\n16                   BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nuse of well-known random analysis techniques to help\nestablish some of the inputs into the equation. Indeed,\nthese claims add even less to the underlying abstract\nprinciple than the invention in Flook did, for the Flook\ninvention was at least directed to the narrower domain of\nsignaling dangers in operating a catalytic converter.\n                         *    *    *\n   Today, the Court once again declines to impose limita\ntions on the Patent Act that are inconsistent with the Act’s\ntext. The patent application here can be rejected under\nour precedents on the unpatentability of abstract ideas.\nThe Court, therefore, need not define further what consti\ntutes a patentable “process,” beyond pointing to the defini\ntion of that term provided in §100(b) and looking to the\nguideposts in Benson, Flook, and Diehr.\n   And nothing in today’s opinion should be read as endors\ning interpretations of §101 that the Court of Appeals for\nthe Federal Circuit has used in the past. See, e.g., State\nStreet, 149 F. 3d, at 1373; AT&T Corp., 172 F. 3d, at 1357.\nIt may be that the Court of Appeals thought it needed to\nmake the machine-or-transformation test exclusive pre\ncisely because its case law had not adequately identified\nless extreme means of restricting business method pat\nents, including (but not limited to) application of our\nopinions in Benson, Flook, and Diehr. In disapproving an\nexclusive machine-or-transformation test, we by no means\nforeclose the Federal Circuit’s development of other limit\ning criteria that further the purposes of the Patent Act\nand are not inconsistent with its text.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

The only question presented\nin this case is whether the so-called machine-or\ntransformation test is the exclusive test for what consti\ntutes a patentable “process” under 35 U. S. C. §101. It\nwould be possible to answer that question simply by hold\ning, as the entire Court agrees, that although the ma\nchine-or-transformation test is reliable in most cases, it is\nnot the exclusive test.\n   I agree with the Court that, in light of the uncertainty\nthat currently pervades this field, it is prudent to provide\nfurther guidance. But I would take a different approach.\nRather than making any broad statements about how to\ndefine the term “process” in §101 or tinkering with the\nbounds of the category of unpatentable, abstract ideas, I\nwould restore patent law to its historical and constitu\ntional moorings.\n   For centuries, it was considered well established that a\nseries of steps for conducting business was not, in itself,\n2                         BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                 STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\npatentable. In the late 1990’s, the Federal Circuit and\nothers called this proposition into question. Congress\nquickly responded to a Federal Circuit decision with a\nstopgap measure designed to limit a potentially significant\nnew problem for the business community. It passed the\nFirst Inventors Defense Act of 1999 (1999 Act), 113 Stat.\n1501A–555 (codified at 35 U. S. C. §273), which provides a\nlimited defense to claims of patent infringement, see\n§273(b), for “method[s] of doing or conducting business,”\n§273(a)(3). Following several more years of confusion, the\nFederal Circuit changed course, overruling recent deci\nsions and holding that a series of steps may constitute a\npatentable process only if it is tied to a machine or trans\nforms an article into a different state or thing. This “ma\nchine-or-transformation test” excluded general methods of\ndoing business as well as, potentially, a variety of other\nsubjects that could be called processes.\n  The Court correctly holds that the machine-or\ntransformation test is not the sole test for what constitutes\na patentable process; rather, it is a critical clue.1 But the\nCourt is quite wrong, in my view, to suggest that any\nseries of steps that is not itself an abstract idea or law of\nnature may constitute a “process” within the meaning of\n§101. The language in the Court’s opinion to this effect\ncan only cause mischief. The wiser course would have\nbeen to hold that petitioners’ method is not a “process”\nbecause it describes only a general method of engaging in\nbusiness transactions—and business methods are not\npatentable.     More precisely, although a process is not\npatent-ineligible simply because it is useful for conducting\nbusiness, a claim that merely describes a method of doing\n——————\n  1 Even if the machine-or-transformation test may not define the scope\n\nof a patentable process, it would be a grave mistake to assume that\nanything with a “ ‘useful, concrete and tangible result,’ ” State Street\nBank & Trust v.

The general method, described in Claim 1, entails\n“managing the consumption risk costs of a commodity sold\nby a commodity provider at a fixed price,” and consists of\nthe following steps:\n       “(a) initiating a series of transactions between said\n    commodity provider and consumers of said commodity\n    wherein said consumers purchase said commodity at\n    a fixed rate based upon historical averages, said\n    fixed rate corresponding to a risk position of said\n    consumers;\n       “(b) identifying market participants for said com\n    modity having a counter-risk position to said consum\n    ers; and\n       “(c) initiating a series of transactions between said\n    commodity provider and said market participants at a\n    second fixed rate such that said series of market par\n    ticipant transactions balances the risk position of said\n    series of consumer transactions.” App. 19–20.\n   Although the patent application makes clear that the\n“method can be used for any commodity to manage con\nsumption risk in a fixed bill price product,” id., at 11, it\nincludes specific applications of the method, particularly\nin the field of energy, as a means of enabling suppliers and\nconsumers to minimize the risks resulting from fluctua\ntions in demand during specified time periods. See id., at\n20–22. Energy suppliers and consumers may use that\n4                     BILSKI v.

See id., at 12–19.\n   The patent examiner rejected petitioners’ application on\nthe ground that it “is not directed to the technological\narts,” insofar as it “is not implemented on a specific appa\nratus and merely manipulates [an] abstract idea and\nsolves a purely mathematical problem without any limita\ntion to a practical application.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 148a.\n   The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (Board)\naffirmed the examiner’s decision, but it rejected the posi\ntion that a patentable process must relate to “technologi\ncal arts” or be performed on a machine. Id., at 180a–181a.\nInstead, the Board denied petitioners’ patent on two alter\nnative, although similar, grounds: first, that the patent\ninvolves only mental steps that do not transform physical\nsubject matter, id., at 181a–184a; and, second, that it is\ndirected to an “abstract idea,” id., at 184a–187a.\n   Petitioners appealed to the United States Court of Ap\npeals for the Federal Circuit. After briefing and argument\nbefore a three-judge panel, the court sua sponte decided to\nhear the case en banc and ordered the parties to address:\n(1) whether petitioners’ “claim 1 . . . claims patent-eligible\nsubject matter under 35 U. S. C. §101”; (2) “[w]hat stan\ndard should govern in determining whether a process is\npatent-eligible subject matter”; (3) “[w]hether the claimed\nsubject matter is not patent-eligible because it constitutes\nan abstract idea or mental process”; (4) “[w]hether a\nmethod or process must result in a physical transforma\ntion of an article or be tied to a machine to be patent\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

App. to\nPet. for Cert. 144a–145a.\n   The en banc Court of Appeals affirmed the Board’s\ndecision. Eleven of the twelve judges agreed that petition\ners’ claims do not describe a patentable “process,” §101.\nChief Judge Michel’s opinion, joined by eight other judges,\nrejected several possible tests for what is a patent-eligible\nprocess, including whether the patent produces a “ ‘useful,\nconcrete and tangible result,’ ” whether the process relates\nto “technological arts,” and “categorical exclusions” for\ncertain processes such as business methods. In re Bilski,\n545 F. 3d 943, 959–960 (2008). Relying on several of our\ncases in which we explained how to differentiate a claim\non a “fundamental principle” from a claim on a “process,”\nthe court concluded that a “claimed process is surely pat\nent-eligible under §101 if: (1) it is tied to a particular\nmachine or apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular\narticle into a different state or thing.” Id., at 954–955.\nThe court further concluded that this “machine-or\ntransformation test” is “the sole test governing §101\nanalyses,” id., at 955 (emphasis added), and therefore the\n“test for determining patent eligibility of a process under\n§101,” id., at 956. Applying that test, the court held that\npetitioners’ claim is not a patent-eligible process. Id., at\n963–966.\n   In a separate opinion reaching the same conclusion,\nJudge Dyk carefully reviewed the history of American\npatent law and English precedents upon which our law is\nbased, and found that “the unpatentability of processes\nnot involving manufactures, machines, or compositions of\nmatter has been firmly embedded . . . since the time of the\nPatent Act of 1793.” Id., at 966. Judge Dyk observed,\n6                     BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n               STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nmoreover, that “[t]here is no suggestion in any of this early\nconsideration of process patents that processes for organiz\ning human activity were or ever had been patentable.”\nId., at 972.\n   Three judges wrote dissenting opinions, although two of\nthose judges agreed that petitioners’ claim is not patent\neligible. Judge Mayer would have held that petitioners’\nclaim “is not eligible for patent protection because it is\ndirected to a method of conducting business.” Id., at 998.\nHe submitted that “[t]he patent system is intended to\nprotect and promote advances in science and technology,\nnot ideas about how to structure commercial transac\ntions.” Ibid. “Affording patent protection to business\nmethods lacks constitutional and statutory support, serves\nto hinder rather than promote innovation[,] and usurps\nthat which rightfully belongs in the public domain.” Ibid.\n   Judge Rader would have rejected petitioners’ claim on\nthe ground that it seeks to patent merely an abstract idea.\nId., at 1011.\n   Only Judge Newman disagreed with the court’s conclu\nsion that petitioners’ claim seeks a patent on ineligible\nsubject matter. Judge Newman urged that the en banc\ncourt’s machine-or-transformation test ignores the text\nand history of §101, id., at 977–978, 985–990, is in tension\nwith several of decisions by this Court, id., at 978–985,\nand the Federal Circuit, id., at 990–992, and will invali\ndate thousands of patents that were issued in reliance on\nthose decisions, id., at 992–994.\n                              II\n   Before explaining in more detail how I would decide this\ncase, I will comment briefly on the Court’s opinion. The\nopinion is less than pellucid in more than one respect, and,\nif misunderstood, could result in confusion or upset settled\nareas of the law. Three preliminary observations may be\nclarifying.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\n\n              STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   First, the Court suggests that the terms in the Patent\nAct must be read as lay speakers use those terms, and not\nas they have traditionally been understood in the context\nof patent law. See, e.g., ante, at 6 (terms in §101 must be\nviewed in light of their “ ‘ordinary, contemporary, common\nmeaning’ ”); ante, at 10 (patentable “method” is any “or\nderly procedure or process,” “regular way or manner of\ndoing anything,” or “set form of procedure adopted in\ninvestigation or instruction” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). As I will explain at more length in Part III,\ninfra, if this portion of the Court’s opinion were taken\nliterally, the results would be absurd: Anything that con\nstitutes a series of steps would be patentable so long as it\nis novel, nonobvious, and described with specificity. But\nthe opinion cannot be taken literally on this point. The\nCourt makes this clear when it accepts that the “atextual”\nmachine-or-transformation test, ante, at 12, is “useful and\nimportant,” ante, at 8, even though it “violates” the stated\n“statutory interpretation principles,” ante, at 6; and when\nthe Court excludes processes that tend to pre-empt com\nmonly used ideas, see ante, at 14–15.\n   Second, in the process of addressing the sole issue\npresented to us, the opinion uses some language that\nseems inconsistent with our centuries-old reliance on the\nmachine-or-transformation criteria as clues to patentabil\nity. Most notably, the opinion for a plurality suggests\nthat these criteria may operate differently when address\ning technologies of a recent vintage. See ante, at 8–9\n(machine-or-transformation test is useful “for evaluating\nprocesses similar to those in the Industrial Age,” but is\nless useful “for determining the patentability of inventions\nin the Information Age”). In moments of caution, however,\nthe opinion for the Court explains—correctly—that the\nCourt is merely restoring the law to its historical state of\nrest. See ante, at 8 (“This Court’s precedents establish\nthat the machine-or-transformation test is a useful and\n8                    BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n              STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nimportant clue, an investigative tool, for determining\nwhether some claimed inventions are processes under\n§101 ”). Notwithstanding this internal tension, I under\nstand the Court’s opinion to hold only that the machine-or\ntransformation test remains an important test for pat\nentability. Few, if any, processes cannot effectively be\nevaluated using these criteria.\n   Third, in its discussion of an issue not contained in the\nquestions presented—whether the particular series of\nsteps in petitioners’ application is an abstract idea—the\nCourt uses language that could suggest a shift in our\napproach to that issue. Although I happen to agree that\npetitioners seek to patent an abstract idea, the Court does\nnot show how this conclusion follows “clear[ly],” ante, at\n15, from our case law. The patent now before us is not for\n“[a] principle, in the abstract,” or a “fundamental truth.”\nParker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584, 589 (1978) (internal quota\ntion marks omitted). Nor does it claim the sort of phe\nnomenon of nature or abstract idea that was embodied by\nthe mathematical formula at issue in Gottschalk v. Ben\nson, 409 U. S. 63, 67 (1972), and in Flook.\n   The Court construes petitioners’ claims on processes for\npricing as claims on “the basic concept of hedging, or\nprotecting against risk,” ante, at 14, and thus discounts\nthe application’s discussion of what sorts of data to use,\nand how to analyze those data, as mere “token postsolu\ntion components,” ante, at 15. In other words, the Court\nartificially limits petitioners’ claims to hedging, and then\nconcludes that hedging is an abstract idea rather than a\nterm that describes a category of processes including\npetitioners’ claims. Why the Court does this is never\nmade clear. One might think that the Court’s analysis\nmeans that any process that utilizes an abstract idea is\nitself an unpatentable, abstract idea. But we have never\nsuggested any such rule, which would undermine a host of\npatentable processes. It is true, as the Court observes,\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   9\n\n                 STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthat petitioners’ application is phrased broadly. See ante,\nat 14–15. But claim specification is covered by §112, not\n§101; and if a series of steps constituted an unpatentable\nidea merely because it was described without sufficient\nspecificity, the Court could be calling into question some of\nour own prior decisions.2 At points, the opinion suggests\nthat novelty is the clue. See ante, at 14. But the fact that\nhedging is “ ‘long prevalent in our system of commerce,’ ”\nibid., cannot justify the Court’s conclusion, as “the proper\nconstruction of §101 . . . does not involve the familiar\nissu[e] of novelty” that arises under §102. Flook, 437\nU. S., at 588. At other points, the opinion for a plurality\nsuggests that the analysis turns on the category of patent\ninvolved. See, e.g., ante, at 12 (courts should use the\nabstract-idea rule as a “too[l]” to set “a high enough bar”\n“when considering patent applications of this sort”). But\nwe have never in the past suggested that the inquiry\nvaries by subject matter.\n  The Court, in sum, never provides a satisfying account\nof what constitutes an unpatentable abstract idea. In\ndeed, the Court does not even explain if it is using the\nmachine-or-transformation criteria. The Court essentially\nasserts its conclusion that petitioners’ application claims\nan abstract idea. This mode of analysis (or lack thereof)\nmay have led to the correct outcome in this case, but it\nalso means that the Court’s musings on this issue stand\nfor very little.\n\n\n——————\n  2 For example, a rule that broadly-phrased claims cannot constitute\npatentable processes could call into question our approval of Alexander\nGraham Bell’s famous fifth claim on “ ‘[t]he method of, and apparatus\nfor, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically, as herein\ndescribed, by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the\nvibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds,\nsubstantially as set forth,’ ” The Telephone Cases, 126 U. S. 1, 531\n(1888).\n10                     BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n\n               STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment \n\n\n                             III \n\n   I agree with the Court that the text of §101 must be the\nstarting point of our analysis. As I shall explain, however,\nthe text must not be the end point as well.\n   Pursuant to its power “[t]o promote the Progress of . . .\nuseful Arts, by securing for limited Times to . . . Inventors\nthe exclusive Right to their . . . Discoveries,” U. S. Const.,\nArt. I, §8, cl. 8, Congress has passed a series of patent\nlaws that grant certain exclusive rights over certain in\nventions and discoveries as a means of encouraging inno\nvation. In the latest iteration, the Patent Act of 1952\n(1952 Act), Congress has provided that “[w]hoever invents\nor discovers any new and useful process, machine, manu\nfacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful\nimprovement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, sub\nject to the conditions and requirements of this title,” 35\nU. S. C. §101, which include that the patent also be novel,\n§102, and nonobvious, §103. The statute thus authorizes\nfour categories of subject matter that may be patented:\nprocesses, machines, manufactures, and compositions of\nmatter. Section 101 imposes a threshold condition. “[N]o\npatent is available for a discovery, however useful, novel,\nand nonobvious, unless it falls within one of the express\ncategories of patentable subject matter.” Kewanee Oil Co.\nv. Bicron Corp., 416 U. S. 470, 483 (1974).\n   Section 101 undoubtedly defines in “expansive terms”\nthe subject matter eligible for patent protection, as the\nstatute was meant to ensure that “ ‘ingenuit[ies] receive a\nliberal encouragement.’ ” Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447\nU. S. 303, 308–309 (1980); see also J. E. M. Ag Supply,\nInc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int’l, Inc., 534 U. S. 124, 130\n(2001). Nonetheless, not every new invention or discovery\nmay be patented. Certain things are “free for all to use.”\nBonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S.\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  11\n\n                 STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n141, 151 (1989).3\n   The text of the Patent Act does not on its face give much\nguidance about what constitutes a patentable process.\nThe statute defines the term “process” as a “process, art or\nmethod [that] includes a new use of a known process,\nmachine, manufacture, composition of matter, or mate\nrial.” §100(b). But, this definition is not especially help\nful, given that it also uses the term “process” and is there\nfore somewhat circular.\n   As lay speakers use the word “process,” it constitutes\nany series of steps. But it has always been clear that, as\nused in §101, the term does not refer to a “ ‘process’ in the\nordinary sense of the word,” Flook, 437 U. S., at 588; see\nalso Corning v. Burden, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86831\"><a href=\"/opinion/86831/corning-v-burden/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 268 (1854) (“[T]he\nterm process is often used in a more vague sense, in which\nit cannot be the subject of a patent”). Rather, as discussed\nin some detail in Part IV, infra, the term “process” (along\nwith the definitions given to that term) has long accumu\nlated a distinctive meaning in patent law. When the term\nwas used in the 1952 Patent Act, it was neither intended\nnor understood to encompass any series of steps or any\nway to do any thing.\n   With that understanding in mind, the Government has\n——————\n  3 The Court quotes our decision in Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S.\n303 (1980), for the proposition that, “ ‘[i]n choosing such expansive\nterms . . . modified by the comprehensive “any,” Congress plainly\ncontemplated that the patent laws would be given wide scope.’ ” Ante,\nat 4. But the Court fails to mention which terms we were discussing in\nChakrabarty: the terms “manufacture” and “composition of matter.”\nSee 447 U. S., at 308 (“In choosing such expansive terms as ‘manufac\nture’ and ‘composition of matter,’ modified by the comprehensive ‘any,’\nCongress plainly contemplated that the patent laws would be given\nwide scope”). As discussed herein, Congress’ choice of the term “proc\ness” reflected a background understanding of what sorts of series of\nsteps could be patented, and likely reflected an intentional design to\ncodify that settled, judicial understanding. This may not have been the\ncase with the terms at issue in Chakrabarty.\n12                    BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n               STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nargued that because “a word” in a statute “is given more\nprecise content by the neighboring words with which it”\nassociates, United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 294\n(2008), we may draw inferences from the fact that “[t]he\nother three statutory categories of patent-eligible subject\nmatter identified in Section 101—‘machine, manufacture,\nor composition of matter’—all ‘are things made by man,\nand involve technology.’ ” Brief for Respondent 26. Spe\ncifically, the Government submits, we may infer “that the\nterm ‘process’ is limited to technological and industrial\nmethods.” Ibid. The Court rejects this submission cate\ngorically, on the ground that “§100(b) already explicitly\ndefines the term ‘process.’ ” Ante, at 6. But §100(b) de\nfines the term “process” by using the term “process,” as\nwell as several other general terms. This is not a case,\nthen, in which we must either “follow” a definition, ante, at\n7, or rely on neighboring words to understand the scope of\nan ambiguous term. The definition itself contains the very\nambiguous term that we must define.\n   In my view, the answer lies in between the Govern\nment’s and the Court’s positions: The terms adjacent to\n“process” in §101 provide a clue as to its meaning, al\nthough not a very strong clue. Section 101’s list of catego\nries of patentable subject matter is phrased in the disjunc\ntive, suggesting that the term “process” has content\ndistinct from the other items in the list. It would therefore\nbe illogical to “rob” the word “process” of all independent\nmeaning. Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 338\n(1979). Moreover, to the extent we can draw inferences\nabout what is a “process” from common attributes in §101,\nit is a dangerous endeavor to do so on the basis of a per\nceived overarching theme. Given the many moving parts\nat work in the Patent Act, there is a risk of merely con\nfirming our preconceived notions of what should be pat\nentable or of seeing common attributes that track “the\nfamiliar issues of novelty and obviousness” that arise\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    13\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nunder other sections of the statute but are not relevant to\n§101, Flook, 437 U. S., at 588. The placement of “process”\nnext to other items thus cannot prove that the term is\nlimited to any particular categories; it does, however, give\nreason to be skeptical that the scope of a patentable “proc\ness” extends to cover any series of steps at all.\n   The Court makes a more serious interpretive error. As\nbriefly discussed in Part II, supra, the Court at points\nappears to reject the well-settled proposition that the term\n“process” in §101 is not a “ ‘process’ in the ordinary sense\nof the word,” Flook, 437 U. S., at 588. Instead, the Court\nposits that the word “process” must be understood in light\nof its “ordinary, contemporary, common meaning,” ante, at\n6 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although this is a\nfine approach to statutory interpretation in general, it is a\ndeeply flawed approach to a statute that relies on complex\nterms of art developed against a particular historical\nbackground.4 Indeed, the approach would render §101\nalmost comical. A process for training a dog, a series of\ndance steps, a method of shooting a basketball, maybe\neven words, stories, or songs if framed as the steps of\ntyping letters or uttering sounds—all would be patent\neligible. I am confident that the term “process” in §101 is\nnot nearly so capacious.5\n——————\n  4 For example, if this Court were to interpret the Sherman Act accord\n\ning to the Act’s plain text, it could prohibit “the entire body of private\ncontract,” National Soc. of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435\nU. S. 679, 688 (1978).\n  5 The Court attempts to avoid such absurd results by stating that\n\nthese “[c]oncerns” “can be met by making sure that the claim meets the\nrequirements of §101.” Ante, at 6. Because the only limitation on the\nplain meaning of “process” that the Court acknowledges explicitly is the\nbar on abstract ideas, laws of nature, and the like, it is presumably this\nlimitation that is left to stand between all conceivable human activity\nand patent monopolies. But many processes that would make for\nabsurd patents are not abstract ideas. Nor can the requirements of\nnovelty, nonobviousness, and particular description pick up the slack.\n14                       BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                 STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n  So is the Court, perhaps. What is particularly incredi\nble about the Court’s stated method of interpreting §101\n(other than that the method itself may be patent-eligible\nunder the Court’s theory of §101) is that the Court devi\nates from its own professed commitment to “ordinary,\ncontemporary, common meaning.” As noted earlier, the\nCourt accepts a role for the “atextual” machine-or\ntransformation “clue.” Ante, at 12, 7. The Court also\naccepts that we have “foreclose[d] a purely literal reading\nof §101,” Flook, 437 U. S., at 589, by holding that claims\nthat are close to “laws of nature, natural phenomena, and\nabstract ideas,” Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 185\n(1981), do not count as “processes” under §101, even if\nthey can be colloquially described as such.6 The Court\nattempts to justify this latter exception to §101 as “a\nmatter of statutory stare decisis.” Ante, at 5. But it is\nstrange to think that the very same term must be inter\npreted literally on some occasions, and in light of its his\ntorical usage on others.\n  In fact, the Court’s understanding of §101 is even more\nremarkable because its willingness to exclude general\nprinciples from the provision’s reach is in tension with its\napparent willingness to include steps for conducting busi\nness. The history of patent law contains strong norms\nagainst patenting these two categories of subject matter.\nBoth norms were presumably incorporated by Congress\ninto the Patent Act in 1952.\n——————\nCf. ante, at 12–13 (plurality opinion). A great deal of human activity\nwas at some time novel and nonobvious.\n   6 Curiously, the Court concedes that “these exceptions are not re\n\nquired by the statutory text,” but urges that “they are consistent with\nthe notion that a patentable process must be ‘new and useful.’ ” Ante,\nat 5 (emphasis added). I do not see how these exceptions find a textual\nhome in the term “new and useful.” The exceptions may be consistent\nwith those words, but they are sometimes inconsistent with the “ordi\nnary, contemporary, common meaning,” ante, at 6, 10 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted), of the words “process” and “method.”\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

As I read the history, it\nstrongly supports the conclusion that a method of doing\nbusiness is not a “process” under §101.\n  I am, of course, mindful of the fact that §101 “is a dy\nnamic provision designed to encompass new and unfore\nseen inventions,” and that one must therefore view his\ntorical conceptions of patent-eligible subject matter at an\nappropriately high level of generality. J. E. M. Ag Supply,\n534 U. S., at 135; see also Chakrabarty, 447 U. S., at 315–\n316. But it is nonetheless significant that while people\nhave long innovated in fields of business, methods of doing\nbusiness fall outside of the subject matter that has “his\ntorically been eligible to receive the protection of our\npatent laws,” Diehr, 450 U. S., at 184, and likely go beyond\nwhat the modern patent “statute was enacted to protect,”\nFlook, 437 U. S., at 593. It is also significant that when\nCongress enacted the latest Patent Act, it did so against\nthe background of a well-settled understanding that a\nseries of steps for conducting business cannot be patented.\nThese considerations ought to guide our analysis. As\nJustice Holmes noted long ago, sometimes, “a page of\nhistory is worth a volume of logic.” New York Trust Co. v.\nEisner, 256 U. S. 345, 349 (1921).\nEnglish Backdrop\n  The Constitution’s Patent Clause was written against\nthe “backdrop” of English patent practices, Graham v.\nJohn Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383 U.

Three years later, Congress\npassed the Patent Act of 1793 and slightly modified the\nlanguage to cover “any new and useful art, machine,\nmanufacture or composition of matter, or any new and\nuseful improvement on any art, machine, manufacture or\ncomposition of matter.” 1 Stat. 319.\n   The object of the constitutional patent power and the\nstatutory authorization for process patents in the early\npatent Acts was the term “useful art.” It is not evident\nfrom the face of the statutes or the Constitution whether\nthe objects of the patent system were “arts” that are also\nuseful, or rather a more specific category, the class of arts\nknown as “useful arts.” Cf. Graham, 383 U. S., at 12\n(describing the “ ‘new and useful’ tests which have always\nexisted in the statutory scheme” and apply to all catego\nries of subject matter).

Although other\ndictionaries defined the word “art” more broadly,27 Web\nster’s definition likely conveyed a message similar to the\nmeaning of the word “manufactures” in the earlier English\nstatute. And we know that the term “useful arts” was\nused in the founding era to refer to manufacturing and\nsimilar applied trades.28 See Coulter, The Field of the\n——————\n   26 Some scholars suggest that Webster’s “close proximity to the Con\n\nstitutional Convention coupled with his familiarity with the delegates\nmakes it likely that he played some indirect role in the development” of\nthe Constitution’s Intellectual Property Clause—a Clause that estab\nlished not only the power to create patents but also copyrights, a\nsubject in which Webster had great interest.

Ibid.\nDevelopment of American Patent Law\n   During the first years of the patent system, no patents\nwere issued on methods of doing business.30 Indeed, for\nsome time, there were serious doubts as to “the patentabil\nity of processes per se,” as distinct from the physical end\nproduct or the tools used to perform a process.

For\nnearly 160 years, Congress retained the term “useful arts,”\nsee, e.g., Act of July 4, 1836, ch. 357, 5 Stat. 117, leaving\n“wide latitude for judicial construction . . . to keep pace\nwith industrial development,” Berman, Method Claims, 17\nJ.

S., at\n184. The new terminology was added only in recognition\nof the fact that courts had been interpreting the category\n“art” by using the terms “process or method”; Congress\nthus wanted to avoid “the necessity of explanation that the\nword ‘art’ as used in this place means ‘process or method.’ ”\nS.

Rich to the New York Patent Law Associa\ntion 7–8 (Nov. 6, 1952).\n   As discussed above, by this time, courts had consistently\nconstrued the term “art” to exclude methods of doing\nbusiness. The 1952 Act likely captured that same mean\ning.38 Cf. Graham, 383 U. S., at 16–17 (reasoning that\nbecause a provision of the 1952 Act “paraphrases language\nwhich has often been used in decisions of the courts” and\nwas “added to the statute for uniformity and definiteness, ”\nthat provision should be treated as “a codification of judi\ncial precedents”).39 Indeed, Judge Rich, the main drafter\n——————\n   38 The 1952 Act also retained the language “invents or discovers,”\n\nwhich by that time had taken on a connotation that would tend to\nexclude business methods. See B. Evans & C. Evans, A Dictionary of\nContemporary Usage 137 (1957) (explaining that “discover; invent”\nmeans “to make or create something new, especially, in modern usage,\nsomething ingeniously devised to perform mechanical operations”).\n   39 As explained in Part II, supra, the Court engages in a Jekyll-and-\n\nHyde form of interpretation with respect to the word “process” in §101.\nIt rejects the interpretation I proffer because the words “process” and\n“method” do not, on their face, distinguish between different series of\nacts. Ante, at 10. But it also rejects many sorts of processes without a\ntextual basis for doing so. See ante, at 4–5, 7, 12–15. And while the\nCourts rests a great deal of weight on Parker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584\n(1978), for its analysis of abstract ideas, the Court minimizes Flook’s\nrejection of “a purely literal reading of §101,” as well as Flook’s reliance\non the historical backdrop of §101 and our understanding of what “the\nstatute was enacted to protect,” id., at 588–590, 593; see also Diamond\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Wash. L. Rev. 393, 394 (1960). “Also outside that\ngroup,” he added, was a process for doing business: “the\ngreatest inventio[n] of our times, the diaper service.”\nIbid.40\n“Anything Under the Sun”\n  Despite strong evidence that Congress has consistently\nauthorized patents for a limited class of subject matter\nand that the 1952 Act did not alter the nature of the then\nexisting limits, petitioners and their amici emphasize a\nsingle phrase in the Act’s legislative history, which sug\ngests that the statutory subject matter “ ‘include[s] any\nthing under the sun that is made by man.’ ” Brief for\nPetitioners 19 (quoting Chakrabarty, 447 U. S., at 309, in\nturn quoting S. Rep. 1979, at 5). Similarly, the Court\nrelies on language from our opinion in Chakrabarty that\nwas based in part on this piece of legislative history. See\nante, at 4, 6.\n  This reliance is misplaced. We have never understood\n——————\nv. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 192 (1981) (explaining that a “claim satisfies\nthe requirements of §101” when it “is performing a function which the\npatent laws were designed to protect”).\n  40 Forty years later, Judge Rich authored the State Street opinion that\n\nsome have understood to make business methods patentable. But State\nStreet dealt with whether a piece of software could be patented and\naddressed only claims directed at machines, not processes. His opinion\nmay therefore be better understood merely as holding that an otherwise\npatentable process is not unpatentable simply because it is directed\ntoward the conduct of doing business—an issue the Court has no\noccasion to address today. See State Street, 149 F. 3d, at 1375.\n32                    BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n               STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthat piece of legislative history to mean that any series of\nsteps is a patentable process. Indeed, if that were so, then\nour many opinions analyzing what is a patentable process\nwere simply wastes of pages in the U. S. Reports. And to\naccept that errant piece of legislative history as widening\nthe scope of the patent law would contradict other evi\ndence in the congressional record, as well as our presump\ntion that the 1952 Act merely codified the meaning of\n“process” and did not expand it, see Diehr, 450 U. S., at\n184.\n   Taken in context, it is apparent that the quoted lan\nguage has a far less expansive meaning. The full sentence\nin the Committee Reports reads: “A person may have\n‘invented’ a machine or a manufacture, which may include\nanything under the sun that is made by man, but it is not\nnecessarily patentable under section 101 unless the condi\ntions of [this] title are fulfilled.” S. Rep. 1979, at 5; H. R.\nRep. 1923, at 6. Viewed as a whole, it seems clear that\nthis language does not purport to explain that “anything\nunder the sun” is patentable. Indeed, the language may\nbe understood to state the exact opposite: that “[a] person\nmay have ‘invented’ . . . anything under the sun,” but that\nthing “is not necessarily patentable under section 101.”\nThus, even in the Chakrabarty opinion, which relied on\nthis quote, we cautioned that the 1952 Reports did not\n“suggest that §101 has no limits or that it embraces every\ndiscovery.” 447 U. S., at 309.\n   Moreover, even if the language in the Committee Re\nports was meant to flesh out the meaning of any portion of\n§101, it did not purport to define the term “process.” The\nlanguage refers only to “manufacture[s]” and “machine[s],”\ntangible objects “made by man.” It does not reference the\n“process” category of subject matter (nor could a process be\ncomfortably described as something “made by man”). The\nlanguage may also be understood merely as defining the\nterm “invents” in §101. As Judge Dyk explained in his\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          33\n\n              STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nopinion below, the phrase “made by man” “is reminiscent”\nof a 1790’s description of the limits of English patent law,\nthat an “invention must be ‘made by man’ ” and cannot be\n“ ‘a philosophical principle only, neither organized or capa\nble of being organized’ from a patentable manufacture.”\n545 F. 3d, at 976 (quoting Hornblower v. Boulton, 8 T. R.\n95, 98 (K. B. 1799)).\n    The 1952 Act, in short, cannot be understood as expand\ning the scope of patentable subject matter by suggesting\nthat any series of steps may be patented as a “process”\nunder §101. If anything, the Act appears to have codified\nthe conclusion that subject matter which was understood\nnot to be patentable in 1952 was to remain unpatentable.\n    Our recent case law reinforces my view that a series of\nsteps for conducting business is not a “process” under\n§101. Since Congress passed the 1952 Act, we have never\nruled on whether that Act authorizes patents on business\nmethods. But we have cast significant doubt on that\nproposition by giving substantial weight to the machine\nor-transformation test, as general methods of doing busi\nness do not pass that test. And more recently, Members of\nthis Court have noted that patents on business methods\nare of “suspect validity.” eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L. L.\nC., 547 U. S. 388, 397 (2006) (KENNEDY, J., concurring).\n                       *    *    *\n  Since at least the days of Assyrian merchants, people\nhave devised better and better ways to conduct business.\nYet it appears that neither the Patent Clause, nor early\npatent law, nor the current §101 contemplated or was\npublicly understood to mean that such innovations are\npatentable. Although it may be difficult to define with\nprecision what is a patentable “process” under §101, the\nhistorical clues converge on one conclusion: A business\nmethod is not a “process.” And to the extent that there is\nambiguity, we should be mindful of our judicial role. “[W]e\n34                    BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n               STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nmust proceed cautiously when we are asked to extend\npatent rights” into an area that the Patent Act likely was\nnot “enacted to protect,” Flook, 437 U. S., at 596, 593, lest\nwe create a legal regime that Congress never would have\nendorsed, and that can be repaired only by disturbing\nsettled property rights.\n                               V\n   Despite the strong historical evidence that a method of\ndoing business does not constitute a “process” under §101,\npetitioners nonetheless argue—and the Court suggests in\ndicta, ante, at 10–11—that a subsequent law, the First\nInventor Defense Act of 1999, “must be read together”\nwith §101 to make business methods patentable. Brief for\nPetitioners 29. This argument utilizes a flawed method of\nstatutory interpretation and ignores the motivation for the\n1999 Act.\n   In 1999, following a Federal Circuit decision that inti\nmated business methods could be patented, see State\nStreet, 149 F. 3d 1368, Congress moved quickly to limit\nthe potential fallout. Congress passed the 1999 Act, codi\nfied at 35 U. S. C. §273, which provides a limited defense\nto claims of patent infringement, see §273(b), regarding\ncertain “method[s] of doing or conducting business,”\n§273(a)(3).\n   It is apparent, both from the content and history of the\nAct, that Congress did not in any way ratify State Street\n(or, as petitioners contend, the broadest possible reading\nof State Street). The Act merely limited one potential\neffect of that decision: that businesses might suddenly find\nthemselves liable for innocently using methods they as\nsumed could not be patented. The Act did not purport to\namend the limitations in §101 on eligible subject matter.\nIndeed, Congress placed the statute in Part III of Title 35,\nwhich addresses “Patents and Protection of Patent\nRights,” rather than in Part II, which contains §101 and\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          35\n\n               STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\naddresses “Patentability of Inventions and Grant of Pat\nents.” Particularly because petitioners’ reading of the\n1999 Act would expand §101 to cover a category of proc\nesses that have not “historically been eligible” for patents,\nDiehr, 450 U. S., at 184, we should be loathe to conclude\nthat Congress effectively amended §101 without saying so\nclearly. We generally presume that Congress “does not,\none might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.” Whitman\nv. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 468\n(2001).\n   The Act therefore is, at best, merely evidence of 1999\nlegislative views on the meaning of the earlier, 1952 Act.\n“[T]he views of a subsequent Congress,” however, “form a\nhazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one.”\nUnited States v. Price, 361 U. S. 304, 313 (1960). When a\nlater statute is offered as “an expression of how the . . .\nCongress interpreted a statute passed by another Con\ngress . . . a half century before,” “such interpretation has\nvery little, if any, significance.” Rainwater v. United\nStates, 356 U. S. 590, 593 (1958).\n   Furthermore, even assuming that Congress’ views at\nthe turn of the 21st century could potentially serve as a\nvalid basis for interpreting a statute passed in the mid\n20th century, the First Inventor Defense Act does not aid\npetitioners because it does not show that the later Con\ngress itself understood §101 to cover business methods. If\nanything, it shows that a few judges on the Federal Cir\ncuit understood §101 in that manner and that Congress\nunderstood what those judges had done. The Act appears\nto reflect surprise and perhaps even dismay that business\nmethods might be patented. Thus, in the months follow\ning State Street, congressional authorities lamented that\n“business methods and processes . . . until recently were\nthought not to be patentable,” H. R. Rep. No. 106–464,\np. 121 (1999); accord, H. R. Rep. No. 106–287, pt. 1, p. 31\n36                        BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n(1999).41 The fact that Congress decided it was appropri\nate to create a new defense to claims that business method\npatents were being infringed merely demonstrates recog\nnition that such claims could create a significant new\nproblem for the business community.\n  The Court nonetheless states that the 1999 Act “ac\nknowledges that there may be business method patents,”\nthereby “clarify[ing]” its “understanding” of §101. Ante, at\n11. More specifically, the Court worries that if we were to\ninterpret the 1952 Act to exclude business methods, our\ninterpretation “would render §273 meaningless.” Ibid. I\nagree that “[a] statute should be construed so that effect is\ngiven to all its provisions.” Corley v. United States, 556\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 9) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). But it is a different matter altogether\nwhen the Court construes one statute, the 1952 Act, to\ngive effect to a different statute, the 1999 Act. The canon\non which the Court relies is predicated upon the idea that\n“[a] statute is passed as a whole.” 2A N. Singer & J.\nSinger, Statutes and Statutory Construction §46:5, p. 189\n(7th ed. 2007). But the two statutes in question were not\npassed as a whole.\n  Put another way, we ordinarily assume, quite sensibly,\nthat Congress would not in one statute include two provi\nsions that are at odds with each other. But as this case\nshows, that sensible reasoning can break down when\n\n——————\n  41 See also 145 Cong. Rec. 30985 (1999) (remarks of Sen.

That is not a sound method\nof statutory interpretation.\n   In light of its history and purpose, I think it obvious\n——————\n  42 The  Court opines that “[t]his principle, of course, applies to inter\npreting any two provisions in the U. S. Code, even when Congress\nenacted the provisions at different times.” Ante, at 11 (emphasis\nadded). The only support the Court offers for this proposition is a 1937\nopinion for three Justices, in Hague v. Committee for Industrial Or\nganization, 307 U. S. 496, 528–530 (1939) (opinion of Stone, J.). But\nthat opinion is inapposite. Although Justice Stone stated that two\nprovisions “must be read together,” id., at 530, he did so to explain that\nan ambiguity in a later-in-time statute must be understood in light of\nthe earlier-in-time framework against which the ambiguous statute\nwas passed, id., at 528–530, particularly because the later statute\nexplicitly stated that it “shall not be construed to apply” to the provi\nsion created by an earlier Act, id., at 528.\n  43 I am not trying to “overcome” an “established rule of statutory in\n\nterpretation” with “judicial speculation as to the subjective intent of\nvarious legislators,” ante, at 11, but, rather, I am explaining why the\nCourt has illogically expanded the canon upon which it relies beyond\nthat canon’s logical underpinnings.\n38                        BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthat the 1999 Congress would never have enacted §273 if\nit had foreseen that this Court would rely on the provision\nas a basis for concluding that business methods are pat\nentable. Section 273 is a red herring; we should be focus\ning our attention on §101 itself.\n                              VI\n  The constitutionally mandated purpose and function of\nthe patent laws bolster the conclusion that methods of\ndoing business are not “processes” under §101.\n  The Constitution allows Congress to issue patents “[t]o\npromote the Progress of . . . useful Arts,” Art.

And absent a discernible signal\nfrom Congress, we proceed cautiously when dealing with\npatents that press on the limits of the “ ‘standard written\ninto the constitution,’ ” Graham, 383 U. S., at 6, for at the\n“fringes of congressional power,” “more is required of\nlegislatures than a vague delegation to be filled in later,”\nBarenblatt v. United States, 360 U.

We should not casually risk exceeding\nthe constitutional limitation on Congress’ behalf.\n   The Court has kept this “constitutional standard” in\nmind when deciding what is patentable subject matter\nunder §101. For example, we have held that no one can\npatent “laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract\nideas.” Diehr, 450 U. S., at 185. These “are the basic tools\nof scientific and technological work,” Benson, 409 U. S., at\n67, and therefore, if patented, would stifle the very pro\ngress that Congress is authorized to promote, see, e.g.,\nO’Reilly, 15 How., at 113 (explaining that Morse’s patent\non electromagnetism for writing would preempt a wide\n——————\ntechnology”).\n40                      BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nswath of technological developments).\n   Without any legislative guidance to the contrary, there\nis a real concern that patents on business methods would\npress on the limits of the “standard expressed in the Con\nstitution,” Graham, 383 U. S., at 6, more likely stifling\nprogress than “promot[ing]” it. U. S. Const., Art. I, §8,\ncl. 8. I recognize that not all methods of doing business\nare the same, and that therefore the constitutional “bal\nance,” Bonito Boats, 489 U. S., at 146, may vary within\nthis category. Nevertheless, I think that this balance\ngenerally supports the historic understanding of the term\n“process” as excluding business methods. And a categori\ncal analysis fits with the purpose, as Thomas Jefferson\nexplained, of ensuring that “ ‘every one might know when\nhis actions were safe and lawful,’ ” Graham, 383 U. S., at\n10; see also Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabu\nshiki Co., 535 U.

Wells\nElectronics, Inc., 525 U. S. 55, 63 (1998). Although there\nis certainly disagreement about the need for patents,\nscholars generally agree that when innovation is expen\nsive, risky, and easily copied, inventors are less likely to\nundertake the guaranteed costs of innovation in order to\nobtain the mere possibility of an invention that others can\ncopy.45 Both common sense and recent economic scholar\nship suggest that these dynamics of cost, risk, and reward\n——————\n  45 See generally W.

S., at 184, than for methods of doing business.\n   Many have expressed serious doubts about whether\npatents are necessary to encourage business innovation.47\nDespite the fact that we have long assumed business\nmethods could not be patented, it has been remarked that\n“the chief business of the American people, is business.”48\nFederal Express developed an overnight delivery service\nand a variety of specific methods (including shipping\nthrough a central hub and online package tracking) with\nout a patent. Although counterfactuals are a dubious form\nof analysis, I find it hard to believe that many of our en\ntrepreneurs forwent business innovation because they\ncould not claim a patent on their new methods.\n   “[C]ompanies have ample incentives to develop business\nmethods even without patent protection, because the\ncompetitive marketplace rewards companies that use\nmore efficient business methods.” Burk & Lemley 1618.49\nInnovators often capture advantages from new business\nmethods notwithstanding the risk of others copying their\ninnovation.

It gener\nally does not require the same “enormous costs in terms of\ntime, research, and development,” Bicron, 416 U.

S.,\nat 483.\n   In any event, even if patents on business methods were\nuseful for encouraging innovation and disclosure, it would\nstill be questionable whether they would, on balance,\nfacilitate or impede the progress of American business.\nFor even when patents encourage innovation and disclo\nsure, “too much patent protection can impede rather than\n‘promote the Progress of . . . useful Arts.’ ” Laboratory\nCorp. of America Holdings v. Metabolite Laboratories, Inc.,\n548 U. S. 124, 126–127 (2006) (BREYER, J., dissenting\nfrom dismissal of certiorari). Patents “can discourage\nresearch by impeding the free exchange of information,”\nfor example, by forcing people to “avoid the use of poten\ntially patented ideas, by leading them to conduct costly\nand time-consuming searches of existing or pending pat\nents, by requiring complex licensing arrangements, and by\nraising the costs of using the patented” methods. Id., at\n127. Although “[e]very patent is the grant of a privilege of\nexacting tolls from the public,” Great Atlantic, 340 U. S.,\nat 154 (Douglas, J., concurring), the tolls of patents on\nbusiness methods may be especially high.\n   The primary concern is that patents on business meth\nods may prohibit a wide swath of legitimate competition\nand innovation. As one scholar explains, “it is useful to\nconceptualize knowledge as a pyramid: the big ideas are\non top; specific applications are at the bottom.” Dreyfuss\n275. The higher up a patent is on the pyramid, the\ngreater the social cost and the greater the hindrance to\nfurther innovation.53 Thus, this Court stated in Benson\n——————\n 53 See   Dreyfuss 276; Merges & Nelson, On the Complex Economics of\n44                       BILSKI v.

Seagram & Sons, Inc.,\n180 F. 2d, at 28 (“To give appellant a monopoly, through\nthe issuance of a patent, upon so great an area . . . would\nin our view impose without warrant of law a serious re\nstraint upon the advance of science and industry”). Busi\nness methods are similarly often closer to “big ideas,” as\nthey are the basic tools of commercial work. They are\nalso, in many cases, the basic tools of further business\ninnovation: Innovation in business methods is often a\nsequential and complementary process in which imitation\nmay be a “spur to innovation” and patents may “become an\nimpediment.” Bessen & Maskin, Sequential Innovation,\nPatents, and Imitation, 40 RAND J. Econ. 611, 613\n(2009).54 “Think how the airline industry might now be\nstructured if the first company to offer frequent flyer miles\nhad enjoyed the sole right to award them.” Dreyfuss 264.\n“[I]mitation and refinement through imitation are both\nnecessary to invention itself and the very lifeblood of a\ncompetitive economy.” Bonito Boats, 489 U. S., at 146.\n   If business methods could be patented, then many busi\nness decisions, no matter how small, could be potential\npatent violations. Businesses would either live in constant\nfear of litigation or would need to undertake the costs of\nsearching through patents that describe methods of doing\nbusiness, attempting to decide whether their innovation is\none that remains in the public domain.

But as we have long\nexplained, patents should not “embaras[s] the honest\npursuit of business with fears and apprehensions of con\ncealed liens and unknown liabilities to lawsuits and vexa\ntious accountings for profits made in good faith.” Atlantic\nWorks v. Brady, 107 U. S. 192, 200 (1883).55\n   These effects are magnified by the “potential vagueness”\nof business method patents, eBay Inc., 547 U. S., at 397\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring). When it comes to patents,\n“clarity is essential to promote progress.” Festo Corp., 535\nU. S., at 730–731. Yet patents on methods of conducting\nbusiness generally are composed largely or entirely of\nintangible steps. Compared to “the kinds of goods . . .\naround which patent rules historically developed,” it thus\ntends to be more costly and time consuming to search\nthrough, and to negotiate licenses for, patents on business\nmethods. See Long 539, 470.56\n   The breadth of business methods, their omnipresence in\nour society, and their potential vagueness also invite a\nparticularly pernicious use of patents that we have long\ncriticized.

The argument goes that\nbecause business methods are both vague and not confined to any one\nindustry, there is not a well-confined body of prior art to consult, and\ntherefore many “bad” patents are likely to issue, a problem that would\nneed to be sorted out in later litigation. See, e.g., Dreyfuss 268–270;\nEisenberg, Analyze This: A Law and Economics Agenda for the Patent\nSystem, 53 Vand. L. Rev. 2081, 2090 (2000); Merges 589–590.\n  56 See also J. Bessen & M.

S., at 146. Even if a\nbusiness method patent is ultimately held invalid, patent\nholders may be able to use it to threaten litigation and to\nbully competitors, especially those that cannot bear the\ncosts of a drawn out, fact-intensive patent litigation.57\nThat can take a particular toll on small and upstart busi\nnesses.58 Of course, patents always serve as a barrier to\ncompetition for the type of subject matter that is patented.\nBut patents on business methods are patents on business\nitself. Therefore, unlike virtually every other category of\npatents, they are by their very nature likely to depress the\ndynamism of the marketplace.59\n\n——————\n  57 See generally Farrell & Shapiro, How Strong Are Weak Patents?\n\n98 Amer.

I would therefore decide this case on that\nground, and I join JUSTICE STEVENS’ opinion in full.\n  I write separately, however, in order to highlight the\nsubstantial agreement among many Members of the Court\non many of the fundamental issues of patent law raised by\nthis case. In light of the need for clarity and settled law in\nthis highly technical area, I think it appropriate to do so.\n                             II\n  In addition to the Court’s unanimous agreement that\nthe claims at issue here are unpatentable abstract ideas, it\nis my view that the following four points are consistent\n2                     BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nwith both the opinion of the Court and JUSTICE STEVENS’\nopinion concurring in the judgment:\n   First, although the text of §101 is broad, it is not with\nout limit. See ante, at 4–5 (opinion of the Court); ante, at\n10 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). “[T]he underly\ning policy of the patent system [is] that ‘the things which\nare worth to the public the embarrassment of an exclusive\npatent,’ . . . must outweigh the restrictive effect of the\nlimited patent monopoly.” Graham v. John Deere Co. of\nKansas City, 383 U. S. 1, 10–11 (1966) (quoting Letter\nfrom Thomas Jefferson to Isaac McPherson (Aug. 13,\n1813), in 6 Writings of Thomas Jefferson 181 (H. Washing\nton ed.)). The Court has thus been careful in interpreting\nthe Patent Act to “determine not only what is protected,\nbut also what is free for all to use.” Bonito Boats, Inc. v.\nThunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141, 151 (1989). In\nparticular, the Court has long held that “[p]henomena of\nnature, though just discovered, mental processes, and\nabstract intellectual concepts are not patentable” under\n§101, since allowing individuals to patent these funda\nmental principles would “wholly pre-empt” the public’s\naccess to the “basic tools of scientific and technological\nwork.” Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63, 67, 72 (1972);\nsee also, e.g., Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 185 (1981);\nDiamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, 309 (1980).\n   Second, in a series of cases that extend back over a\ncentury, the Court has stated that “[t]ransformation and\nreduction of an article to a different state or thing is the\nclue to the patentability of a process claim that does not\ninclude particular machines.” Diehr, supra, at 184 (em\nphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted); see also,\ne.g., Benson, supra, at 70; Parker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584,\n588, n. 9 (1978); Cochrane v. Deener, 94 U. S. 780, 788\n(1877). Application of this test, the so-called “machine-or\ntransformation test,” has thus repeatedly helped the Court\nto determine what is “a patentable ‘process.’ ” Flook, supra,\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nat 589.\n   Third, while the machine-or-transformation test has\nalways been a “useful and important clue,” it has never\nbeen the “sole test” for determining patentability. Ante, at\n8; see also ante, at 1 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judg\nment); Benson, supra, at 71 (rejecting the argument that\n“no process patent could ever qualify” for protection under\n§101 “if it did not meet the [machine-or-transformation]\nrequirements”). Rather, the Court has emphasized that a\nprocess claim meets the requirements of §101 when, “con\nsidered as a whole,” it “is performing a function which the\npatent laws were designed to protect (e.g., transforming or\nreducing an article to a different state or thing).” Diehr,\nsupra, at 192. The machine-or-transformation test is thus\nan important example of how a court can determine pat\nentability under §101, but the Federal Circuit erred in this\ncase by treating it as the exclusive test.\n   Fourth, although the machine-or-transformation test is\nnot the only test for patentability, this by no means indi\ncates that anything which produces a “ ‘useful, concrete,\nand tangible result,’ ” State Street Bank & Trust Co. v.\nSignature Financial Group, Inc., 149 F. 3d 1368, 1373 (CA\nFed. 1998), is patentable. “[T]his Court has never made\nsuch a statement and, if taken literally, the statement\nwould cover instances where this Court has held the con\ntrary.” Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings v. Metabo\nlite Laboratories, Inc., 548 U. S. 124, 136 (2006) (BREYER,\nJ., dissenting from dismissal of certiorari as improvidently\ngranted); see also, e.g., O’Reilly v. Morse, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86821\"><a href=\"/opinion/86821/oreilly-v-morse/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 117\n(1854); Flook, supra, at 590. Indeed, the introduction of\nthe “useful, concrete, and tangible result” approach to\npatentability, associated with the Federal Circuit’s State\nStreet decision, preceded the granting of patents that\n“ranged from the somewhat ridiculous to the truly ab\nsurd.” In re Bilski, 545 F. 3d 943, 1004 (CA Fed. 2008)\n(Mayer, J., dissenting) (citing patents on, inter alia, a\n4                     BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\n“method of training janitors to dust and vacuum using\nvideo displays,” a “system for toilet reservations,” and a\n“method of using color-coded bracelets to designate dating\nstatus in order to limit ‘the embarrassment of rejection’ ”);\nsee also Brief for Respondent 40–41, and n. 20 (listing\ndubious patents). To the extent that the Federal Circuit’s\ndecision in this case rejected that approach, nothing in\ntoday’s decision should be taken as disapproving of that\ndetermination. See ante, at 16; ante, at 2, n. 1 (STEVENS,\nJ., concurring in judgment).\n   In sum, it is my view that, in reemphasizing that the\n“machine-or-transformation” test is not necessarily the\nsole test of patentability, the Court intends neither to de\nemphasize the test’s usefulness nor to suggest that many\npatentable processes lie beyond its reach.\n                        III\n  With these observations, I concur in the Court’s\njudgment.\n</pre>", "id": 149585, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2010/06/28/Bilski_v._Kappos.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2009                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued November 9, 2009—Decided June 28, 2010\nPetitioners’ patent application seeks protection for a claimed invention\n  that explains how commodities buyers and sellers in the energy mar\n  ket can protect, or hedge, against the risk of price changes. The key\n  claims are claim 1, which describes a series of steps instructing how\n  to hedge risk, and claim 4, which places the claim 1 concept into a\n  simple mathematical formula. The remaining claims explain how\n  claims 1 and 4 can be applied to allow energy suppliers and consum\n  ers to minimize the risks resulting from fluctuations in market de\n  mand. The patent examiner rejected the application on the grounds\n  that the invention is not implemented on a specific apparatus, merely\n  manipulates an abstract idea, and solves a purely mathematical\n  problem. The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences agreed and\n  affirmed. The Federal Circuit, in turn, affirmed. The en banc court\n  rejected its prior test for determining whether a claimed invention\n  was a patentable “process” under Patent Act, 35 U. S. C. §101—i.e.,\n  whether the invention produced a “useful, concrete, and tangible re\n  sult,” see, e.g., State Street Bank & Trust Co v. Signature Financial\n  Group, Inc., 149 F. 3d 1368, 1373—holding instead that a claimed\n  process is patent eligible if: (1) it is tied to a particular machine or\n  apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a different\n  state or thing. Concluding that this “machine-or-transformation test”\n  is the sole test for determining patent eligibility of a “process” under\n  §101, the court applied the test and held that the application was not\n  patent eligible.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n2                          BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n545 F. 3d 943, affirmed.\n     JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to\n  Parts II–B–2 and II–C–2, concluding that petitioners’ claimed inven\n  tion is not patent eligible. Pp. 4–8, 10–11, 12–16.\n     (a) Section 101 specifies four independent categories of inventions\n  or discoveries that are patent eligible: “process[es],” “machin[es],”\n  “manufactur[es],” and “composition[s] of matter.” “In choosing such\n  expansive terms, . . . Congress plainly contemplated that the patent\n  laws would be given wide scope,” Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S.\n  303, 308, in order to ensure that “ ‘ingenuity should receive a liberal\n  encouragement,’ ” id., at 308–309. This Court’s precedents provide\n  three specific exceptions to §101’s broad principles: “laws of nature,\n  physical phenomena, and abstract ideas.” Id., at 309. While not re\n  quired by the statutory text, these exceptions are consistent with the\n  notion that a patentable process must be “new and useful.” And, in\n  any case, the exceptions have defined the statute’s reach as a matter\n  of statutory stare decisis going back 150 years. See Le Roy v.\n  Tatham, 14 How. 156, 174. The §101 eligibility inquiry is only a\n  threshold test. Even if a claimed invention qualifies in one of the\n  four categories, it must also satisfy “the conditions and requirements\n  of this title,” §101(a), including novelty, see §102, nonobviousness, see\n  §103, and a full and particular description, see §112. The invention\n  at issue is claimed to be a “process,” which §100(b) defines as a “proc\n  ess, art or method, and includes a new use of a known process, ma\n  chine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material.” Pp. 4–5.\n     (b) The machine-or-transformation test is not the sole test for pat\n  ent eligibility under §101. The Court’s precedents establish that al\n  though that test may be a useful and important clue or investigative\n  tool, it is not the sole test for deciding whether an invention is a pat\n  ent-eligible “process” under §101. In holding to the contrary, the\n  Federal Circuit violated two principles of statutory interpretation:\n  Courts “ ‘should not read into the patent laws limitations and condi\n  tions which the legislature has not expressed,’ ” Diamond v. Diehr,\n  450 U. S. 175, 182, and, “[u]nless otherwise defined, ‘words will be in\n  terpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common mean\n  ing,’ ” ibid. The Court is unaware of any ordinary, contemporary,\n  common meaning of “process” that would require it to be tied to a\n  machine or the transformation of an article. Respondent Patent Di\n  rector urges the Court to read §101’s other three patentable catego\n  ries as confining “process” to a machine or transformation. However,\n  the doctrine of noscitur a sociis is inapplicable here, for §100(b) al\n  ready explicitly defines “process,” see Burgess v. United States, 553\n  U. S. 124, 130, and nothing about the section’s inclusion of those\n  other categories suggests that a “process” must be tied to one of them.\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nFinally, the Federal Circuit incorrectly concluded that this Court has\nendorsed the machine-or-transformation test as the exclusive test.\nRecent authorities show that the test was never intended to be ex\nhaustive or exclusive. See, e.g., Parker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584, 588,\nn. 9. Pp. 5–8.\n   (c) Section 101 similarly precludes a reading of the term “process”\nthat would categorically exclude business methods.            The term\n“method” within §100(b)’s “process” definition, at least as a textual\nmatter and before other consulting other Patent Act limitations and\nthis Court’s precedents, may include at least some methods of doing\nbusiness. The Court is unaware of any argument that the “ordinary,\ncontemporary, common meaning,” Diehr, supra, at 182, of “method”\nexcludes business methods. Nor is it clear what a business method\nexception would sweep in and whether it would exclude technologies\nfor conducting a business more efficiently. The categorical exclusion\nargument is further undermined by the fact that federal law explic\nitly contemplates the existence of at least some business method pat\nents: Under §273(b)(1), if a patent-holder claims infringement based\non “a method in [a] patent,” the alleged infringer can assert a defense\nof prior use. By allowing this defense, the statute itself acknowledges\nthat there may be business method patents. Section 273 thus clari\nfies the understanding that a business method is simply one kind of\n“method” that is, at least in some circumstances, eligible for patent\ning under §101. A contrary conclusion would violate the canon\nagainst interpreting any statutory provision in a manner that would\nrender another provision superfluous. See Corley v. United States,\n556 U. S. ___, ___. Finally, while §273 appears to leave open the pos\nsibility of some business method patents, it does not suggest broad\npatentability of such claimed inventions. Pp. 10–11.\n   (d) Even though petitioners’ application is not categorically outside\nof §101 under the two atextual approaches the Court rejects today,\nthat does not mean it is a “process” under §101. Petitioners seek to\npatent both the concept of hedging risk and the application of that\nconcept to energy markets. Under Benson, Flook, and Diehr, how\never, these are not patentable processes but attempts to patent ab\nstract ideas. Claims 1 and 4 explain the basic concept of hedging and\nreduce that concept to a mathematical formula. This is an unpat\nentable abstract idea, just like the algorithms at issue in Benson and\nFlook. Petitioners’ remaining claims, broad examples of how hedging\ncan be used in commodities and energy markets, attempt to patent\nthe use of the abstract hedging idea, then instruct the use of well\nknown random analysis techniques to help establish some of the in\nputs into the equation. They add even less to the underlying abstract\nprinciple than the invention held patent ineligible in Flook. Pp. 12–\n4                            BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    15.\n      (e) Because petitioners’ patent application can be rejected under\n    the Court’s precedents on the unpatentability of abstract ideas, the\n    Court need not define further what constitutes a patentable “proc\n    ess,” beyond pointing to the definition of that term provided in\n    §100(b) and looking to the guideposts in Benson, Flook, and Diehr.\n    Nothing in today’s opinion should be read as endorsing the Federal\n    Circuit’s past interpretations of §101. See, e.g., State Street, 49 F. 3d,\n    at 1373. The appeals court may have thought it needed to make the\n    machine-or-transformation test exclusive precisely because its case\n    law had not adequately identified less extreme means of restricting\n    business method patents. In disapproving an exclusive machine-or\n    transformation test, this Court by no means desires to preclude the\n    Federal Circuit’s development of other limiting criteria that further\n    the Patent Act’s purposes and are not inconsistent with its text.\n    P. 16.\n\n  KENNEDY, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, except for Parts II–\nB–2 and II–C–2.

The patent application claims a procedure for\ninstructing buyers and sellers how to protect against the\nrisk of price fluctuations in a discrete section of the econ\nomy. Three arguments are advanced for the proposition\nthat the claimed invention is outside the scope of patent\nlaw: (1) it is not tied to a machine and does not transform\nan article; (2) it involves a method of conducting business;\nand (3) it is merely an abstract idea. The Court of Appeals\nruled that the first mentioned of these, the so-called ma\nchine-or-transformation test, was the sole test to be used\nfor determining the patentability of a “process” under the\nPatent Act, 35 U. S. C. §101.\n\n——————\n * JUSTICE SCALIA does not join Parts II–B–2 and II–C–2.\n2                    BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              I\n  Petitioners’ application seeks patent protection for a\nclaimed invention that explains how buyers and sellers of\ncommodities in the energy market can protect, or hedge,\nagainst the risk of price changes. The key claims are\nclaims 1 and 4. Claim 1 describes a series of steps in\nstructing how to hedge risk. Claim 4 puts the concept\narticulated in claim 1 into a simple mathematical formula.\nClaim 1 consists of the following steps:\n       “(a) initiating a series of transactions between said\n    commodity provider and consumers of said commodity\n    wherein said consumers purchase said commodity at a\n    fixed rate based upon historical averages, said fixed\n    rate corresponding to a risk position of said consum\n    ers;\n       “(b) identifying market participants for said com\n    modity having a counter-risk position to said consum\n    ers; and\n       “(c) initiating a series of transactions between said\n    commodity provider and said market participants at a\n    second fixed rate such that said series of market par\n    ticipant transactions balances the risk position of said\n    series of consumer transactions.” App. 19–20.\nThe remaining claims explain how claims 1 and 4 can be\napplied to allow energy suppliers and consumers to mini\nmize the risks resulting from fluctuations in market de\nmand for energy. For example, claim 2 claims “[t]he\nmethod of claim 1 wherein said commodity is energy and\nsaid market participants are transmission distributors.”\nId., at 20. Some of these claims also suggest familiar\nstatistical approaches to determine the inputs to use in\nclaim 4’s equation. For example, claim 7 advises using\nwell-known random analysis techniques to determine how\nmuch a seller will gain “from each transaction under each\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

The Board of Patent Appeals and Interfer\nences affirmed, concluding that the application involved\nonly mental steps that do not transform physical matter\nand was directed to an abstract idea. Id., at 181a–186a.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit heard the case en banc and affirmed. The case\nproduced five different opinions. Students of patent law\nwould be well advised to study these scholarly opinions.\n   Chief Judge Michel wrote the opinion of the court. The\ncourt rejected its prior test for determining whether a\nclaimed invention was a patentable “process” under\n§101—whether it produces a “ ‘useful, concrete, and tangi\nble result’ ”—as articulated in State Street Bank & Trust\nCo. v. Signature Financial Group, Inc., 149 F. 3d 1368,\n1373 (1998), and AT&T Corp. v. Excel Communications,\nInc., 172 F. 3d 1352, 1357 (1999). See In re Bilski, 545\nF. 3d 943, 959–960, and n. 19 (CA Fed. 2008) (en banc).\nThe court held that “[a] claimed process is surely patent\neligible under §101 if: (1) it is tied to a particular machine\nor apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a\ndifferent state or thing.” Id., at 954. The court concluded\nthis “machine-or-transformation test” is “the sole test\ngoverning §101 analyses,” id., at 955, and thus the “test\nfor determining patent eligibility of a process under §101,”\nid., at 956. Applying the machine-or-transformation test,\nthe court held that petitioners’ application was not patent\neligible. Id., at 963–966. Judge Dyk wrote a separate\nconcurring opinion, providing historical support for the\n4                    BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt’s approach. Id., at 966–976.\n  Three judges wrote dissenting opinions. Judge Mayer\nargued that petitioners’ application was “not eligible for\npatent protection because it is directed to a method of\nconducting business.” Id., at 998. He urged the adoption\nof a “technological standard for patentability.” Id., at\n1010. Judge Rader would have found petitioners’ claims\nwere an unpatentable abstract idea. Id., at 1011. Only\nJudge Newman disagreed with the court’s conclusion that\npetitioners’ application was outside of the reach of §101.\nShe did not say that the application should have been\ngranted but only that the issue should be remanded for\nfurther proceedings to determine whether the application\nqualified as patentable under other provisions. Id., at 997.\n  This Court granted certiorari. 556 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                           II\n                           A\n  Section 101 defines the subject matter that may be\npatented under the Patent Act:\n      “Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful\n    process, machine, manufacture, or composition of\n    matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof,\n    may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions\n    and requirements of this title.”\nSection 101 thus specifies four independent categories of\ninventions or discoveries that are eligible for protection:\nprocesses, machines, manufactures, and compositions of\nmatter. “In choosing such expansive terms . . . modified by\nthe comprehensive ‘any,’ Congress plainly contemplated\nthat the patent laws would be given wide scope.” Dia\nmond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, 308 (1980).

Washington ed. 1871)).\n   The Court’s precedents provide three specific exceptions\nto §101’s broad patent-eligibility principles: “laws of na\nture, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas.” Chakra\nbarty, supra, at 309. While these exceptions are not re\nquired by the statutory text, they are consistent with the\nnotion that a patentable process must be “new and useful.”\nAnd, in any case, these exceptions have defined the reach\nof the statute as a matter of statutory stare decisis going\nback 150 years. See Le Roy v. Tatham, 14 How. 156, 174–\n175 (1853). The concepts covered by these exceptions are\n“part of the storehouse of knowledge of all men . . . free to\nall men and reserved exclusively to none.” Funk Brothers\nSeed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U. S. 127, 130 (1948).\n   The §101 patent-eligibility inquiry is only a threshold\ntest. Even if an invention qualifies as a process, machine,\nmanufacture, or composition of matter, in order to receive\nthe Patent Act’s protection the claimed invention must\nalso satisfy “the conditions and requirements of this title.”\n§101. Those requirements include that the invention be\nnovel, see §102, nonobvious, see §103, and fully and par\nticularly described, see §112.\n   The present case involves an invention that is claimed\nto be a “process” under §101. Section 100(b) defines “proc\ness” as:\n    “process, art or method, and includes a new use of a\n    known process, machine, manufacture, composition of\n    matter, or material.”\nThe Court first considers two proposed categorical limita\ntions on “process” patents under §101 that would, if\nadopted, bar petitioners’ application in the present case:\nthe machine-or-transformation test and the categorical\nexclusion of business method patents.\n6                     BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                                 B\n                                 1\n   Under the Court of Appeals’ formulation, an invention is\na “process” only if: “(1) it is tied to a particular machine or\napparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a\ndifferent state or thing.” 545 F. 3d, at 954. This Court\nhas “more than once cautioned that courts ‘should not read\ninto the patent laws limitations and conditions which the\nlegislature has not expressed.’ ” Diamond v. Diehr, 450\nU. S. 175, 182 (1981) (quoting Chakrabarty, supra, at 308;\nsome internal quotation marks omitted). In patent law, as\nin all statutory construction, “[u]nless otherwise defined,\n‘words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, con\ntemporary, common meaning.’ ” Diehr, supra, at 182\n(quoting Perrin v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42 (1979)).\nThe Court has read the §101 term “manufacture” in accor\ndance with dictionary definitions, see Chakrabarty, supra,\nat 308 (citing American Fruit Growers, Inc. v. Brogdex Co.,\n283 U. S. 1, 11 (1931)), and approved a construction of the\nterm “composition of matter” consistent with common\nusage, see Chakrabarty, supra, at 308 (citing Shell Devel\nopment Co. v. Watson, 149 F. Supp. 279, 280 (DC 1957)).\n   Any suggestion in this Court’s case law that the Patent\nAct’s terms deviate from their ordinary meaning has only\nbeen an explanation for the exceptions for laws of nature,\nphysical phenomena, and abstract ideas. See Parker v.\nFlook, 437 U. S. 584, 588–589 (1978). This Court has not\nindicated that the existence of these well-established\nexceptions gives the Judiciary carte blanche to impose\nother limitations that are inconsistent with the text and\nthe statute’s purpose and design. Concerns about at\ntempts to call any form of human activity a “process” can\nbe met by making sure the claim meets the requirements\nof §101.\n   Adopting the machine-or-transformation test as the sole\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntest for what constitutes a “process” (as opposed to just an\nimportant and useful clue) violates these statutory inter\npretation principles. Section 100(b) provides that “[t]he\nterm ‘process’ means process, art or method, and includes\na new use of a known process, machine, manufacture,\ncomposition of matter, or material.” The Court is unaware\nof any “ ‘ordinary, contemporary, common meaning,’ ”\nDiehr, supra, at 182, of the definitional terms “process, art\nor method” that would require these terms to be tied to a\nmachine or to transform an article. Respondent urges the\nCourt to look to the other patentable categories in §101—\nmachines, manufactures, and compositions of matter—to\nconfine the meaning of “process” to a machine or trans\nformation, under the doctrine of noscitur a sociis. Under\nthis canon, “an ambiguous term may be given more precise\ncontent by the neighboring words with which it is associ\nated.” United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 12) (internal quotation marks omitted). This\ncanon is inapplicable here, for §100(b) already explicitly\ndefines the term “process.” See Burgess v. United States,\n553 U. S. 124, 130 (2008) (“When a statute includes an\nexplicit definition, we must follow that definition” (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted)).\n   The Court of Appeals incorrectly concluded that this\nCourt has endorsed the machine-or-transformation test as\nthe exclusive test. It is true that Cochrane v. Deener, 94\nU. S. 780, 788 (1877), explained that a “process” is “an act,\nor a series of acts, performed upon the subject-matter to be\ntransformed and reduced to a different state or thing.”\nMore recent cases, however, have rejected the broad impli\ncations of this dictum; and, in all events, later authority\nshows that it was not intended to be an exhaustive or\nexclusive test. Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63, 70\n(1972), noted that “[t]ransformation and reduction of an\narticle ‘to a different state or thing’ is the clue to the pat\n8                     BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                    Opinion of Kthe Court\n                     Opinion of ENNEDY, J.\n\nentability of a process claim that does not include particu\nlar machines.” At the same time, it explicitly declined to\n“hold that no process patent could ever qualify if it did not\nmeet [machine or transformation] requirements.” Id., at\n71. Flook took a similar approach, “assum[ing] that a\nvalid process patent may issue even if it does not meet\n[the machine-or-transformation test].” 437 U. S., at 588,\nn. 9.\n  This Court’s precedents establish that the machine-or\ntransformation test is a useful and important clue, an\ninvestigative tool, for determining whether some claimed\ninventions are processes under §101. The machine-or\ntransformation test is not the sole test for deciding\nwhether an invention is a patent-eligible “process.”\n                               2\n  It is true that patents for inventions that did not satisfy\nthe machine-or-transformation test were rarely granted in\nearlier eras, especially in the Industrial Age, as explained\nby Judge Dyk’s thoughtful historical review. See 545\nF. 3d, at 966–976 (concurring opinion). But times change.\nTechnology and other innovations progress in unexpected\nways. For example, it was once forcefully argued that\nuntil recent times, “well-established principles of patent\nlaw probably would have prevented the issuance of a valid\npatent on almost any conceivable computer program.”\nDiehr, 450 U. S., at 195 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). But\nthis fact does not mean that unforeseen innovations such\nas computer programs are always unpatentable. See id.,\nat 192–193 (majority opinion) (holding a procedure for\nmolding rubber that included a computer program is\nwithin patentable subject matter). Section 101 is a “dy\nnamic provision designed to encompass new and unfore\nseen inventions.” J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-\nBred Int’l, Inc., 534 U. S. 124, 135 (2001).

S., at 315.\n   The machine-or-transformation test may well provide a\nsufficient basis for evaluating processes similar to those in\nthe Industrial Age—for example, inventions grounded in a\nphysical or other tangible form. But there are reasons to\ndoubt whether the test should be the sole criterion for\ndetermining the patentability of inventions in the Infor\nmation Age. As numerous amicus briefs argue, the ma\nchine-or-transformation test would create uncertainty as\nto the patentability of software, advanced diagnostic medi\ncine techniques, and inventions based on linear program\nming, data compression, and the manipulation of digital\nsignals. See, e.g., Brief for Business Software Alliance 24–\n25; Brief for Biotechnology Industry Organization et al.\n14–27; Brief for Boston Patent Law Association 8–15;\nBrief for Houston Intellectual Property Law Association\n17–22; Brief for Dolby Labs., Inc., et al. 9–10.\n   In the course of applying the machine-or-transformation\ntest to emerging technologies, courts may pose questions\nof such intricacy and refinement that they risk obscuring\nthe larger object of securing patents for valuable inven\ntions without transgressing the public domain. The dis\nsent by Judge Rader refers to some of these difficulties.\n545 F. 3d, at 1015. As a result, in deciding whether previ\nously unforeseen inventions qualify as patentable “proc\ness[es],” it may not make sense to require courts to confine\nthemselves to asking the questions posed by the machine\nor-transformation test. Section 101’s terms suggest that\nnew technologies may call for new inquiries. See Benson,\nsupra, at 71 (to “freeze process patents to old technologies,\nleaving no room for the revelations of the new, onrushing\ntechnology[,] . . . is not our purpose”).\n   It is important to emphasize that the Court today is not\ncommenting on the patentability of any particular inven\n10                   BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion, let alone holding that any of the above-mentioned\ntechnologies from the Information Age should or should\nnot receive patent protection. This Age puts the possibil\nity of innovation in the hands of more people and raises\nnew difficulties for the patent law. With ever more people\ntrying to innovate and thus seeking patent protections for\ntheir inventions, the patent law faces a great challenge in\nstriking the balance between protecting inventors and not\ngranting monopolies over procedures that others would\ndiscover by independent, creative application of general\nprinciples. Nothing in this opinion should be read to take\na position on where that balance ought to be struck.\n                               C\n                               1\n   Section 101 similarly precludes the broad contention\nthat the term “process” categorically excludes business\nmethods. The term “method,” which is within §100(b)’s\ndefinition of “process,” at least as a textual matter and\nbefore consulting other limitations in the Patent Act and\nthis Court’s precedents, may include at least some meth\nods of doing business. See, e.g., Webster’s New Interna\ntional Dictionary 1548 (2d ed. 1954) (defining “method” as\n“[a]n orderly procedure or process . . . regular way or\nmanner of doing anything; hence, a set form of procedure\nadopted in investigation or instruction”). The Court is\nunaware of any argument that the “ ‘ordinary, contempo\nrary, common meaning,’ ” Diehr, supra, at 182, of “method”\nexcludes business methods. Nor is it clear how far a pro\nhibition on business method patents would reach, and\nwhether it would exclude technologies for conducting a\nbusiness more efficiently. See, e.g., Hall, Business and\nFinancial Method Patents, Innovation, and Policy, 56\nScottish J. Pol. Econ. 443, 445 (2009) (“There is no precise\ndefinition of . . . business method patents”).\n   The argument that business methods are categorically\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of Kthe Court\n                      Opinion of ENNEDY, J.\n\noutside of §101’s scope is further undermined by the fact\nthat federal law explicitly contemplates the existence of at\nleast some business method patents. Under 35 U. S. C.\n§273(b)(1), if a patent-holder claims infringement based on\n“a method in [a] patent,” the alleged infringer can assert a\ndefense of prior use. For purposes of this defense alone,\n“method” is defined as “a method of doing or conducting\nbusiness.” §273(a)(3). In other words, by allowing this\ndefense the statute itself acknowledges that there may be\nbusiness method patents. Section 273’s definition of\n“method,” to be sure, cannot change the meaning of a\nprior-enacted statute. But what §273 does is clarify the\nunderstanding that a business method is simply one kind\nof “method” that is, at least in some circumstances, eligible\nfor patenting under §101.\n   A conclusion that business methods are not patentable\nin any circumstances would render §273 meaningless.\nThis would violate the canon against interpreting any\nstatutory provision in a manner that would render an\nother provision superfluous. See Corley v. United States,\n556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 9). This principle, of\ncourse, applies to interpreting any two provisions in the\nU. S. Code, even when Congress enacted the provisions at\ndifferent times. See, e.g., Hague v. Committee for Indus\ntrial Organization, 307 U. S. 496, 529–530 (1939) (opinion\nof Stone, J.). This established rule of statutory interpreta\ntion cannot be overcome by judicial speculation as to the\nsubjective intent of various legislators in enacting the\nsubsequent provision. Finally, while §273 appears to\nleave open the possibility of some business method pat\nents, it does not suggest broad patentability of such\nclaimed inventions.\n                            2\n  Interpreting §101 to exclude all business methods sim\nply because business method patents were rarely issued\n12                   BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                    Opinion of Kthe Court\n                     Opinion of ENNEDY, J.\n\nuntil modern times revives many of the previously dis\ncussed difficulties. See supra, at 8–9. At the same time,\nsome business method patents raise special problems in\nterms of vagueness and suspect validity. See eBay Inc. v.\nMercExchange, L. L. C., 547 U. S. 388, 397 (2006)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring). The Information Age empow\ners people with new capacities to perform statistical\nanalyses and mathematical calculations with a speed and\nsophistication that enable the design of protocols for more\nefficient performance of a vast number of business tasks.\nIf a high enough bar is not set when considering patent\napplications of this sort, patent examiners and courts\ncould be flooded with claims that would put a chill on\ncreative endeavor and dynamic change.\n   In searching for a limiting principle, this Court’s prece\ndents on the unpatentability of abstract ideas provide\nuseful tools. See infra, at 12–15. Indeed, if the Court of\nAppeals were to succeed in defining a narrower category\nor class of patent applications that claim to instruct how\nbusiness should be conducted, and then rule that the\ncategory is unpatentable because, for instance, it repre\nsents an attempt to patent abstract ideas, this conclusion\nmight well be in accord with controlling precedent. See\nibid. But beyond this or some other limitation consistent\nwith the statutory text, the Patent Act leaves open the\npossibility that there are at least some processes that can\nbe fairly described as business methods that are within\npatentable subject matter under §101.\n   Finally, even if a particular business method fits into\nthe statutory definition of a “process,” that does not mean\nthat the application claiming that method should be\ngranted.     In order to receive patent protection, any\nclaimed invention must be novel, §102, nonobvious, §103,\nand fully and particularly described, §112. These limita\ntions serve a critical role in adjusting the tension, ever\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Petitioners seek to patent both\nthe concept of hedging risk and the application of that\nconcept to energy markets. App. 19–20. Rather than\nadopting categorical rules that might have wide-ranging\nand unforeseen impacts, the Court resolves this case\nnarrowly on the basis of this Court’s decisions in Benson,\nFlook, and Diehr, which show that petitioners’ claims are\nnot patentable processes because they are attempts to\npatent abstract ideas. Indeed, all members of the Court\nagree that the patent application at issue here falls out\nside of §101 because it claims an abstract idea.\n    In Benson, the Court considered whether a patent appli\ncation for an algorithm to convert binary-coded decimal\nnumerals into pure binary code was a “process” under\n§101. 409 U. S., at 64–67. The Court first explained that\n“ ‘[a] principle, in the abstract, is a fundamental truth; an\noriginal cause; a motive; these cannot be patented, as no\none can claim in either of them an exclusive right.’ ” Id., at\n67 (quoting Le Roy, 14 How., at 175). The Court then held\nthe application at issue was not a “process,” but an unpat\nentable abstract idea. “It is conceded that one may not\npatent an idea. But in practical effect that would be the\nresult if the formula for converting . . . numerals to pure\nbinary numerals were patented in this case.” 409 U. S., at\n71. A contrary holding “would wholly pre-empt the\nmathematical formula and in practical effect would be a\npatent on the algorithm itself.” Id., at 72.\n    In Flook, the Court considered the next logical step after\n14                    BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nBenson. The applicant there attempted to patent a proce\ndure for monitoring the conditions during the catalytic\nconversion process in the petrochemical and oil-refining\nindustries. The application’s only innovation was reliance\non a mathematical algorithm. 437 U. S., at 585–586.\nFlook held the invention was not a patentable “process.”\nThe Court conceded the invention at issue, unlike the\nalgorithm in Benson, had been limited so that it could still\nbe freely used outside the petrochemical and oil-refining\nindustries. 437 U. S., at 589–590. Nevertheless, Flook\nrejected “[t]he notion that post-solution activity, no matter\nhow conventional or obvious in itself, can transform an\nunpatentable principle into a patentable process.” Id., at\n590. The Court concluded that the process at issue there\nwas “unpatentable under §101, not because it contain[ed]\na mathematical algorithm as one component, but because\nonce that algorithm [wa]s assumed to be within the prior\nart, the application, considered as a whole, contain[ed] no\npatentable invention.” Id., at 594. As the Court later\nexplained, Flook stands for the proposition that the prohi\nbition against patenting abstract ideas “cannot be circum\nvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula to a\nparticular technological environment” or adding “insignifi\ncant postsolution activity.” Diehr, 450 U. S., at 191–192.\n  Finally, in Diehr, the Court established a limitation on\nthe principles articulated in Benson and Flook. The appli\ncation in Diehr claimed a previously unknown method for\n“molding raw, uncured synthetic rubber into cured preci\nsion products,” using a mathematical formula to complete\nsome of its several steps by way of a computer. 450 U. S.,\nat 177. Diehr explained that while an abstract idea, law of\nnature, or mathematical formula could not be patented,\n“an application of a law of nature or mathematical for\nmula to a known structure or process may well be deserv\ning of patent protection.” Id., at 187. Diehr emphasized\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe need to consider the invention as a whole, rather than\n“dissect[ing] the claims into old and new elements and\nthen . . . ignor[ing] the presence of the old elements in the\nanalysis.” Id., at 188. Finally, the Court concluded that\nbecause the claim was not “an attempt to patent a\nmathematical formula, but rather [was] an industrial\nprocess for the molding of rubber products,” it fell within\n§101’s patentable subject matter. Id., at 192–193.\n   In light of these precedents, it is clear that petitioners’\napplication is not a patentable “process.” Claims 1 and 4\nin petitioners’ application explain the basic concept of\nhedging, or protecting against risk: “Hedging is a funda\nmental economic practice long prevalent in our system of\ncommerce and taught in any introductory finance class.”\n545 F. 3d, at 1013 (Rader, J., dissenting); see, e.g., D.\nChorafas, Introduction to Derivative Financial Instru\nments 75–94 (2008); C. Stickney, R. Weil, K. Schipper, &\nJ. Francis, Financial Accounting: An Introduction to Con\ncepts, Methods, and Uses 581–582 (13th ed. 2010); S.\nRoss, R. Westerfield, & B. Jordan, Fundamentals of Cor\nporate Finance 743–744 (8th ed. 2008). The concept of\nhedging, described in claim 1 and reduced to a mathemati\ncal formula in claim 4, is an unpatentable abstract idea,\njust like the algorithms at issue in Benson and Flook.\nAllowing petitioners to patent risk hedging would pre\nempt use of this approach in all fields, and would effec\ntively grant a monopoly over an abstract idea.\n   Petitioners’ remaining claims are broad examples of how\nhedging can be used in commodities and energy markets.\nFlook established that limiting an abstract idea to one\nfield of use or adding token postsolution components did\nnot make the concept patentable. That is exactly what the\nremaining claims in petitioners’ application do. These\nclaims attempt to patent the use of the abstract idea of\nhedging risk in the energy market and then instruct the\n16                   BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nuse of well-known random analysis techniques to help\nestablish some of the inputs into the equation. Indeed,\nthese claims add even less to the underlying abstract\nprinciple than the invention in Flook did, for the Flook\ninvention was at least directed to the narrower domain of\nsignaling dangers in operating a catalytic converter.\n                         *    *    *\n   Today, the Court once again declines to impose limita\ntions on the Patent Act that are inconsistent with the Act’s\ntext. The patent application here can be rejected under\nour precedents on the unpatentability of abstract ideas.\nThe Court, therefore, need not define further what consti\ntutes a patentable “process,” beyond pointing to the defini\ntion of that term provided in §100(b) and looking to the\nguideposts in Benson, Flook, and Diehr.\n   And nothing in today’s opinion should be read as endors\ning interpretations of §101 that the Court of Appeals for\nthe Federal Circuit has used in the past. See, e.g., State\nStreet, 149 F. 3d, at 1373; AT&T Corp., 172 F. 3d, at 1357.\nIt may be that the Court of Appeals thought it needed to\nmake the machine-or-transformation test exclusive pre\ncisely because its case law had not adequately identified\nless extreme means of restricting business method pat\nents, including (but not limited to) application of our\nopinions in Benson, Flook, and Diehr. In disapproving an\nexclusive machine-or-transformation test, we by no means\nforeclose the Federal Circuit’s development of other limit\ning criteria that further the purposes of the Patent Act\nand are not inconsistent with its text.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

It\nwould be possible to answer that question simply by hold\ning, as the entire Court agrees, that although the ma\nchine-or-transformation test is reliable in most cases, it is\nnot the exclusive test.\n   I agree with the Court that, in light of the uncertainty\nthat currently pervades this field, it is prudent to provide\nfurther guidance. But I would take a different approach.\nRather than making any broad statements about how to\ndefine the term “process” in §101 or tinkering with the\nbounds of the category of unpatentable, abstract ideas, I\nwould restore patent law to its historical and constitu\ntional moorings.\n   For centuries, it was considered well established that a\nseries of steps for conducting business was not, in itself,\n2                         BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                 STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\npatentable. In the late 1990’s, the Federal Circuit and\nothers called this proposition into question. Congress\nquickly responded to a Federal Circuit decision with a\nstopgap measure designed to limit a potentially significant\nnew problem for the business community. It passed the\nFirst Inventors Defense Act of 1999 (1999 Act), 113 Stat.\n1501A–555 (codified at 35 U. S. C. §273), which provides a\nlimited defense to claims of patent infringement, see\n§273(b), for “method[s] of doing or conducting business,”\n§273(a)(3). Following several more years of confusion, the\nFederal Circuit changed course, overruling recent deci\nsions and holding that a series of steps may constitute a\npatentable process only if it is tied to a machine or trans\nforms an article into a different state or thing. This “ma\nchine-or-transformation test” excluded general methods of\ndoing business as well as, potentially, a variety of other\nsubjects that could be called processes.\n  The Court correctly holds that the machine-or\ntransformation test is not the sole test for what constitutes\na patentable process; rather, it is a critical clue.1 But the\nCourt is quite wrong, in my view, to suggest that any\nseries of steps that is not itself an abstract idea or law of\nnature may constitute a “process” within the meaning of\n§101. The language in the Court’s opinion to this effect\ncan only cause mischief. The wiser course would have\nbeen to hold that petitioners’ method is not a “process”\nbecause it describes only a general method of engaging in\nbusiness transactions—and business methods are not\npatentable.     More precisely, although a process is not\npatent-ineligible simply because it is useful for conducting\nbusiness, a claim that merely describes a method of doing\n——————\n  1 Even if the machine-or-transformation test may not define the scope\n\nof a patentable process, it would be a grave mistake to assume that\nanything with a “ ‘useful, concrete and tangible result,’ ” State Street\nBank & Trust v. Signature Financial Group, Inc., 149 F. 3d 1368, 1373\n(CA Fed. 1998), may be patented.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n               STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nbusiness does not qualify as a “process” under §101.\n                              I\n   Although the Court provides a brief statement of facts,\nante, at 1–4, a more complete explication may be useful for\nthose unfamiliar with petitioners’ patent application and\nthis case’s procedural history.\n   Petitioners’ patent application describes a series of steps\nfor managing risk amongst buyers and sellers of commodi\nties. The general method, described in Claim 1, entails\n“managing the consumption risk costs of a commodity sold\nby a commodity provider at a fixed price,” and consists of\nthe following steps:\n       “(a) initiating a series of transactions between said\n    commodity provider and consumers of said commodity\n    wherein said consumers purchase said commodity at\n    a fixed rate based upon historical averages, said\n    fixed rate corresponding to a risk position of said\n    consumers;\n       “(b) identifying market participants for said com\n    modity having a counter-risk position to said consum\n    ers; and\n       “(c) initiating a series of transactions between said\n    commodity provider and said market participants at a\n    second fixed rate such that said series of market par\n    ticipant transactions balances the risk position of said\n    series of consumer transactions.” App. 19–20.\n   Although the patent application makes clear that the\n“method can be used for any commodity to manage con\nsumption risk in a fixed bill price product,” id., at 11, it\nincludes specific applications of the method, particularly\nin the field of energy, as a means of enabling suppliers and\nconsumers to minimize the risks resulting from fluctua\ntions in demand during specified time periods. See id., at\n20–22. Energy suppliers and consumers may use that\n4                     BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n               STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nmethod to hedge their risks by agreeing upon a fixed\nseries of payments at regular intervals throughout the\nyear instead of charging or paying prices that fluctuate in\nresponse to changing weather conditions. The patent\napplication describes a series of steps, including the\nevaluation of historical costs and weather variables and\nthe use of economic and statistical formulas, to analyze\nthese data and to estimate the likelihood of certain out\ncomes. See id., at 12–19.\n   The patent examiner rejected petitioners’ application on\nthe ground that it “is not directed to the technological\narts,” insofar as it “is not implemented on a specific appa\nratus and merely manipulates [an] abstract idea and\nsolves a purely mathematical problem without any limita\ntion to a practical application.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 148a.\n   The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (Board)\naffirmed the examiner’s decision, but it rejected the posi\ntion that a patentable process must relate to “technologi\ncal arts” or be performed on a machine. Id., at 180a–181a.\nInstead, the Board denied petitioners’ patent on two alter\nnative, although similar, grounds: first, that the patent\ninvolves only mental steps that do not transform physical\nsubject matter, id., at 181a–184a; and, second, that it is\ndirected to an “abstract idea,” id., at 184a–187a.\n   Petitioners appealed to the United States Court of Ap\npeals for the Federal Circuit. After briefing and argument\nbefore a three-judge panel, the court sua sponte decided to\nhear the case en banc and ordered the parties to address:\n(1) whether petitioners’ “claim 1 . . . claims patent-eligible\nsubject matter under 35 U. S. C. §101”; (2) “[w]hat stan\ndard should govern in determining whether a process is\npatent-eligible subject matter”; (3) “[w]hether the claimed\nsubject matter is not patent-eligible because it constitutes\nan abstract idea or mental process”; (4) “[w]hether a\nmethod or process must result in a physical transforma\ntion of an article or be tied to a machine to be patent\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n               STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\neligible subject matter”; and (5) whether the court’s deci\nsions in State Street Bank & Trust Co. v. Signature Finan\ncial Group, Inc., 149 F. 3d 1368 (1998) (State Street), and\nAT&T Corp. v. Excel Communications, Inc., 172 F. 3d\n1352 (1999), should be overruled in any respect. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 144a–145a.\n   The en banc Court of Appeals affirmed the Board’s\ndecision. Eleven of the twelve judges agreed that petition\ners’ claims do not describe a patentable “process,” §101.\nChief Judge Michel’s opinion, joined by eight other judges,\nrejected several possible tests for what is a patent-eligible\nprocess, including whether the patent produces a “ ‘useful,\nconcrete and tangible result,’ ” whether the process relates\nto “technological arts,” and “categorical exclusions” for\ncertain processes such as business methods. In re Bilski,\n545 F. 3d 943, 959–960 (2008). Relying on several of our\ncases in which we explained how to differentiate a claim\non a “fundamental principle” from a claim on a “process,”\nthe court concluded that a “claimed process is surely pat\nent-eligible under §101 if: (1) it is tied to a particular\nmachine or apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular\narticle into a different state or thing.” Id., at 954–955.\nThe court further concluded that this “machine-or\ntransformation test” is “the sole test governing §101\nanalyses,” id., at 955 (emphasis added), and therefore the\n“test for determining patent eligibility of a process under\n§101,” id., at 956. Applying that test, the court held that\npetitioners’ claim is not a patent-eligible process. Id., at\n963–966.\n   In a separate opinion reaching the same conclusion,\nJudge Dyk carefully reviewed the history of American\npatent law and English precedents upon which our law is\nbased, and found that “the unpatentability of processes\nnot involving manufactures, machines, or compositions of\nmatter has been firmly embedded . . . since the time of the\nPatent Act of 1793.” Id., at 966. Judge Dyk observed,\n6                     BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n               STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nmoreover, that “[t]here is no suggestion in any of this early\nconsideration of process patents that processes for organiz\ning human activity were or ever had been patentable.”\nId., at 972.\n   Three judges wrote dissenting opinions, although two of\nthose judges agreed that petitioners’ claim is not patent\neligible. Judge Mayer would have held that petitioners’\nclaim “is not eligible for patent protection because it is\ndirected to a method of conducting business.” Id., at 998.\nHe submitted that “[t]he patent system is intended to\nprotect and promote advances in science and technology,\nnot ideas about how to structure commercial transac\ntions.” Ibid. “Affording patent protection to business\nmethods lacks constitutional and statutory support, serves\nto hinder rather than promote innovation[,] and usurps\nthat which rightfully belongs in the public domain.” Ibid.\n   Judge Rader would have rejected petitioners’ claim on\nthe ground that it seeks to patent merely an abstract idea.\nId., at 1011.\n   Only Judge Newman disagreed with the court’s conclu\nsion that petitioners’ claim seeks a patent on ineligible\nsubject matter. Judge Newman urged that the en banc\ncourt’s machine-or-transformation test ignores the text\nand history of §101, id., at 977–978, 985–990, is in tension\nwith several of decisions by this Court, id., at 978–985,\nand the Federal Circuit, id., at 990–992, and will invali\ndate thousands of patents that were issued in reliance on\nthose decisions, id., at 992–994.\n                              II\n   Before explaining in more detail how I would decide this\ncase, I will comment briefly on the Court’s opinion. The\nopinion is less than pellucid in more than one respect, and,\nif misunderstood, could result in confusion or upset settled\nareas of the law. Three preliminary observations may be\nclarifying.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\n\n              STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   First, the Court suggests that the terms in the Patent\nAct must be read as lay speakers use those terms, and not\nas they have traditionally been understood in the context\nof patent law. See, e.g., ante, at 6 (terms in §101 must be\nviewed in light of their “ ‘ordinary, contemporary, common\nmeaning’ ”); ante, at 10 (patentable “method” is any “or\nderly procedure or process,” “regular way or manner of\ndoing anything,” or “set form of procedure adopted in\ninvestigation or instruction” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). As I will explain at more length in Part III,\ninfra, if this portion of the Court’s opinion were taken\nliterally, the results would be absurd: Anything that con\nstitutes a series of steps would be patentable so long as it\nis novel, nonobvious, and described with specificity. But\nthe opinion cannot be taken literally on this point. The\nCourt makes this clear when it accepts that the “atextual”\nmachine-or-transformation test, ante, at 12, is “useful and\nimportant,” ante, at 8, even though it “violates” the stated\n“statutory interpretation principles,” ante, at 6; and when\nthe Court excludes processes that tend to pre-empt com\nmonly used ideas, see ante, at 14–15.\n   Second, in the process of addressing the sole issue\npresented to us, the opinion uses some language that\nseems inconsistent with our centuries-old reliance on the\nmachine-or-transformation criteria as clues to patentabil\nity. Most notably, the opinion for a plurality suggests\nthat these criteria may operate differently when address\ning technologies of a recent vintage. See ante, at 8–9\n(machine-or-transformation test is useful “for evaluating\nprocesses similar to those in the Industrial Age,” but is\nless useful “for determining the patentability of inventions\nin the Information Age”). In moments of caution, however,\nthe opinion for the Court explains—correctly—that the\nCourt is merely restoring the law to its historical state of\nrest. See ante, at 8 (“This Court’s precedents establish\nthat the machine-or-transformation test is a useful and\n8                    BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n              STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nimportant clue, an investigative tool, for determining\nwhether some claimed inventions are processes under\n§101 ”). Notwithstanding this internal tension, I under\nstand the Court’s opinion to hold only that the machine-or\ntransformation test remains an important test for pat\nentability. Few, if any, processes cannot effectively be\nevaluated using these criteria.\n   Third, in its discussion of an issue not contained in the\nquestions presented—whether the particular series of\nsteps in petitioners’ application is an abstract idea—the\nCourt uses language that could suggest a shift in our\napproach to that issue. Although I happen to agree that\npetitioners seek to patent an abstract idea, the Court does\nnot show how this conclusion follows “clear[ly],” ante, at\n15, from our case law. The patent now before us is not for\n“[a] principle, in the abstract,” or a “fundamental truth.”\nParker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584, 589 (1978) (internal quota\ntion marks omitted). Nor does it claim the sort of phe\nnomenon of nature or abstract idea that was embodied by\nthe mathematical formula at issue in Gottschalk v. Ben\nson, 409 U. S. 63, 67 (1972), and in Flook.\n   The Court construes petitioners’ claims on processes for\npricing as claims on “the basic concept of hedging, or\nprotecting against risk,” ante, at 14, and thus discounts\nthe application’s discussion of what sorts of data to use,\nand how to analyze those data, as mere “token postsolu\ntion components,” ante, at 15. In other words, the Court\nartificially limits petitioners’ claims to hedging, and then\nconcludes that hedging is an abstract idea rather than a\nterm that describes a category of processes including\npetitioners’ claims. Why the Court does this is never\nmade clear. One might think that the Court’s analysis\nmeans that any process that utilizes an abstract idea is\nitself an unpatentable, abstract idea. But we have never\nsuggested any such rule, which would undermine a host of\npatentable processes. It is true, as the Court observes,\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   9\n\n                 STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthat petitioners’ application is phrased broadly. See ante,\nat 14–15. But claim specification is covered by §112, not\n§101; and if a series of steps constituted an unpatentable\nidea merely because it was described without sufficient\nspecificity, the Court could be calling into question some of\nour own prior decisions.2 At points, the opinion suggests\nthat novelty is the clue. See ante, at 14. But the fact that\nhedging is “ ‘long prevalent in our system of commerce,’ ”\nibid., cannot justify the Court’s conclusion, as “the proper\nconstruction of §101 . . . does not involve the familiar\nissu[e] of novelty” that arises under §102. Flook, 437\nU. S., at 588. At other points, the opinion for a plurality\nsuggests that the analysis turns on the category of patent\ninvolved. See, e.g., ante, at 12 (courts should use the\nabstract-idea rule as a “too[l]” to set “a high enough bar”\n“when considering patent applications of this sort”). But\nwe have never in the past suggested that the inquiry\nvaries by subject matter.\n  The Court, in sum, never provides a satisfying account\nof what constitutes an unpatentable abstract idea. In\ndeed, the Court does not even explain if it is using the\nmachine-or-transformation criteria. The Court essentially\nasserts its conclusion that petitioners’ application claims\nan abstract idea. This mode of analysis (or lack thereof)\nmay have led to the correct outcome in this case, but it\nalso means that the Court’s musings on this issue stand\nfor very little.\n\n\n——————\n  2 For example, a rule that broadly-phrased claims cannot constitute\npatentable processes could call into question our approval of Alexander\nGraham Bell’s famous fifth claim on “ ‘[t]he method of, and apparatus\nfor, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically, as herein\ndescribed, by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the\nvibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds,\nsubstantially as set forth,’ ” The Telephone Cases, 126 U. S. 1, 531\n(1888).\n10                     BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n\n               STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment \n\n\n                             III \n\n   I agree with the Court that the text of §101 must be the\nstarting point of our analysis. As I shall explain, however,\nthe text must not be the end point as well.\n   Pursuant to its power “[t]o promote the Progress of . . .\nuseful Arts, by securing for limited Times to . . . Inventors\nthe exclusive Right to their . . . Discoveries,” U. S. Const.,\nArt. I, §8, cl. 8, Congress has passed a series of patent\nlaws that grant certain exclusive rights over certain in\nventions and discoveries as a means of encouraging inno\nvation. In the latest iteration, the Patent Act of 1952\n(1952 Act), Congress has provided that “[w]hoever invents\nor discovers any new and useful process, machine, manu\nfacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful\nimprovement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, sub\nject to the conditions and requirements of this title,” 35\nU. S. C. §101, which include that the patent also be novel,\n§102, and nonobvious, §103. The statute thus authorizes\nfour categories of subject matter that may be patented:\nprocesses, machines, manufactures, and compositions of\nmatter. Section 101 imposes a threshold condition. “[N]o\npatent is available for a discovery, however useful, novel,\nand nonobvious, unless it falls within one of the express\ncategories of patentable subject matter.” Kewanee Oil Co.\nv. Bicron Corp., 416 U. S. 470, 483 (1974).\n   Section 101 undoubtedly defines in “expansive terms”\nthe subject matter eligible for patent protection, as the\nstatute was meant to ensure that “ ‘ingenuit[ies] receive a\nliberal encouragement.’ ” Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447\nU. S. 303, 308–309 (1980); see also J. E. M. Ag Supply,\nInc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int’l, Inc., 534 U. S. 124, 130\n(2001). Nonetheless, not every new invention or discovery\nmay be patented. Certain things are “free for all to use.”\nBonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S.\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  11\n\n                 STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n141, 151 (1989).3\n   The text of the Patent Act does not on its face give much\nguidance about what constitutes a patentable process.\nThe statute defines the term “process” as a “process, art or\nmethod [that] includes a new use of a known process,\nmachine, manufacture, composition of matter, or mate\nrial.” §100(b). But, this definition is not especially help\nful, given that it also uses the term “process” and is there\nfore somewhat circular.\n   As lay speakers use the word “process,” it constitutes\nany series of steps. But it has always been clear that, as\nused in §101, the term does not refer to a “ ‘process’ in the\nordinary sense of the word,” Flook, 437 U. S., at 588; see\nalso Corning v. Burden, 15 How. 252, 268 (1854) (“[T]he\nterm process is often used in a more vague sense, in which\nit cannot be the subject of a patent”). Rather, as discussed\nin some detail in Part IV, infra, the term “process” (along\nwith the definitions given to that term) has long accumu\nlated a distinctive meaning in patent law. When the term\nwas used in the 1952 Patent Act, it was neither intended\nnor understood to encompass any series of steps or any\nway to do any thing.\n   With that understanding in mind, the Government has\n——————\n  3 The Court quotes our decision in Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S.\n303 (1980), for the proposition that, “ ‘[i]n choosing such expansive\nterms . . . modified by the comprehensive “any,” Congress plainly\ncontemplated that the patent laws would be given wide scope.’ ” Ante,\nat 4. But the Court fails to mention which terms we were discussing in\nChakrabarty: the terms “manufacture” and “composition of matter.”\nSee 447 U. S., at 308 (“In choosing such expansive terms as ‘manufac\nture’ and ‘composition of matter,’ modified by the comprehensive ‘any,’\nCongress plainly contemplated that the patent laws would be given\nwide scope”). As discussed herein, Congress’ choice of the term “proc\ness” reflected a background understanding of what sorts of series of\nsteps could be patented, and likely reflected an intentional design to\ncodify that settled, judicial understanding. This may not have been the\ncase with the terms at issue in Chakrabarty.\n12                    BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n               STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nargued that because “a word” in a statute “is given more\nprecise content by the neighboring words with which it”\nassociates, United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 294\n(2008), we may draw inferences from the fact that “[t]he\nother three statutory categories of patent-eligible subject\nmatter identified in Section 101—‘machine, manufacture,\nor composition of matter’—all ‘are things made by man,\nand involve technology.’ ” Brief for Respondent 26. Spe\ncifically, the Government submits, we may infer “that the\nterm ‘process’ is limited to technological and industrial\nmethods.” Ibid. The Court rejects this submission cate\ngorically, on the ground that “§100(b) already explicitly\ndefines the term ‘process.’ ” Ante, at 6. But §100(b) de\nfines the term “process” by using the term “process,” as\nwell as several other general terms. This is not a case,\nthen, in which we must either “follow” a definition, ante, at\n7, or rely on neighboring words to understand the scope of\nan ambiguous term. The definition itself contains the very\nambiguous term that we must define.\n   In my view, the answer lies in between the Govern\nment’s and the Court’s positions: The terms adjacent to\n“process” in §101 provide a clue as to its meaning, al\nthough not a very strong clue. Section 101’s list of catego\nries of patentable subject matter is phrased in the disjunc\ntive, suggesting that the term “process” has content\ndistinct from the other items in the list. It would therefore\nbe illogical to “rob” the word “process” of all independent\nmeaning. Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 338\n(1979). Moreover, to the extent we can draw inferences\nabout what is a “process” from common attributes in §101,\nit is a dangerous endeavor to do so on the basis of a per\nceived overarching theme. Given the many moving parts\nat work in the Patent Act, there is a risk of merely con\nfirming our preconceived notions of what should be pat\nentable or of seeing common attributes that track “the\nfamiliar issues of novelty and obviousness” that arise\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    13\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nunder other sections of the statute but are not relevant to\n§101, Flook, 437 U. S., at 588. The placement of “process”\nnext to other items thus cannot prove that the term is\nlimited to any particular categories; it does, however, give\nreason to be skeptical that the scope of a patentable “proc\ness” extends to cover any series of steps at all.\n   The Court makes a more serious interpretive error. As\nbriefly discussed in Part II, supra, the Court at points\nappears to reject the well-settled proposition that the term\n“process” in §101 is not a “ ‘process’ in the ordinary sense\nof the word,” Flook, 437 U. S., at 588. Instead, the Court\nposits that the word “process” must be understood in light\nof its “ordinary, contemporary, common meaning,” ante, at\n6 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although this is a\nfine approach to statutory interpretation in general, it is a\ndeeply flawed approach to a statute that relies on complex\nterms of art developed against a particular historical\nbackground.4 Indeed, the approach would render §101\nalmost comical. A process for training a dog, a series of\ndance steps, a method of shooting a basketball, maybe\neven words, stories, or songs if framed as the steps of\ntyping letters or uttering sounds—all would be patent\neligible. I am confident that the term “process” in §101 is\nnot nearly so capacious.5\n——————\n  4 For example, if this Court were to interpret the Sherman Act accord\n\ning to the Act’s plain text, it could prohibit “the entire body of private\ncontract,” National Soc. of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435\nU. S. 679, 688 (1978).\n  5 The Court attempts to avoid such absurd results by stating that\n\nthese “[c]oncerns” “can be met by making sure that the claim meets the\nrequirements of §101.” Ante, at 6. Because the only limitation on the\nplain meaning of “process” that the Court acknowledges explicitly is the\nbar on abstract ideas, laws of nature, and the like, it is presumably this\nlimitation that is left to stand between all conceivable human activity\nand patent monopolies. But many processes that would make for\nabsurd patents are not abstract ideas. Nor can the requirements of\nnovelty, nonobviousness, and particular description pick up the slack.\n14                       BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                 STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n  So is the Court, perhaps. What is particularly incredi\nble about the Court’s stated method of interpreting §101\n(other than that the method itself may be patent-eligible\nunder the Court’s theory of §101) is that the Court devi\nates from its own professed commitment to “ordinary,\ncontemporary, common meaning.” As noted earlier, the\nCourt accepts a role for the “atextual” machine-or\ntransformation “clue.” Ante, at 12, 7. The Court also\naccepts that we have “foreclose[d] a purely literal reading\nof §101,” Flook, 437 U. S., at 589, by holding that claims\nthat are close to “laws of nature, natural phenomena, and\nabstract ideas,” Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 185\n(1981), do not count as “processes” under §101, even if\nthey can be colloquially described as such.6 The Court\nattempts to justify this latter exception to §101 as “a\nmatter of statutory stare decisis.” Ante, at 5. But it is\nstrange to think that the very same term must be inter\npreted literally on some occasions, and in light of its his\ntorical usage on others.\n  In fact, the Court’s understanding of §101 is even more\nremarkable because its willingness to exclude general\nprinciples from the provision’s reach is in tension with its\napparent willingness to include steps for conducting busi\nness. The history of patent law contains strong norms\nagainst patenting these two categories of subject matter.\nBoth norms were presumably incorporated by Congress\ninto the Patent Act in 1952.\n——————\nCf. ante, at 12–13 (plurality opinion). A great deal of human activity\nwas at some time novel and nonobvious.\n   6 Curiously, the Court concedes that “these exceptions are not re\n\nquired by the statutory text,” but urges that “they are consistent with\nthe notion that a patentable process must be ‘new and useful.’ ” Ante,\nat 5 (emphasis added). I do not see how these exceptions find a textual\nhome in the term “new and useful.” The exceptions may be consistent\nwith those words, but they are sometimes inconsistent with the “ordi\nnary, contemporary, common meaning,” ante, at 6, 10 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted), of the words “process” and “method.”\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010) \n        15\n\n              STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment \n\n\n                             IV \n\n  Because the text of §101 does not on its face convey the\nscope of patentable processes, it is necessary, in my view,\nto review the history of our patent law in some detail.\nThis approach yields a much more straightforward answer\nto this case than the Court’s. As I read the history, it\nstrongly supports the conclusion that a method of doing\nbusiness is not a “process” under §101.\n  I am, of course, mindful of the fact that §101 “is a dy\nnamic provision designed to encompass new and unfore\nseen inventions,” and that one must therefore view his\ntorical conceptions of patent-eligible subject matter at an\nappropriately high level of generality. J. E. M. Ag Supply,\n534 U. S., at 135; see also Chakrabarty, 447 U. S., at 315–\n316. But it is nonetheless significant that while people\nhave long innovated in fields of business, methods of doing\nbusiness fall outside of the subject matter that has “his\ntorically been eligible to receive the protection of our\npatent laws,” Diehr, 450 U. S., at 184, and likely go beyond\nwhat the modern patent “statute was enacted to protect,”\nFlook, 437 U. S., at 593. It is also significant that when\nCongress enacted the latest Patent Act, it did so against\nthe background of a well-settled understanding that a\nseries of steps for conducting business cannot be patented.\nThese considerations ought to guide our analysis. As\nJustice Holmes noted long ago, sometimes, “a page of\nhistory is worth a volume of logic.” New York Trust Co. v.\nEisner, 256 U. S. 345, 349 (1921).\nEnglish Backdrop\n  The Constitution’s Patent Clause was written against\nthe “backdrop” of English patent practices, Graham v.\nJohn Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383 U.

S., at 5. The\nstatute generally prohibited the Crown from granting such\nexclusive rights, 21 Jam. 1, c. 3, §1 (1623), in 4 Statutes of\nthe Realm 1213 (reprint 1963), but it contained exceptions\nthat, inter alia, permitted grants of exclusive rights to the\n“working or making of any manner of new Manufacture.”\n§6.\n   Pursuant to that provision, patents issued for the\n“mode, method, or way of manufacturing,” F. Campin, Law\nof Patents for Inventions 11 (1869) (emphasis deleted),\nand English courts construed the phrase “working or\nmaking of any manner of new manufactures” to encom\npass manufacturing processes, see, e.g., Boulton v.

Although other\ndictionaries defined the word “art” more broadly,27 Web\nster’s definition likely conveyed a message similar to the\nmeaning of the word “manufactures” in the earlier English\nstatute.

It has been\nsuggested, however, that “[p]erhaps this was in part a\nfunction of an understanding—shared widely among\nlegislators, courts, patent office officials, and inventors—\nabout what patents were meant to protect.

Thus, although\ncertain processes, such as those related to the technology\nof the time, might have been considered patentable, it is\npossible that “[a]gainst this background, it would have\nbeen seen as absurd for an entrepreneur to file a patent”\non methods of conducting business. Ibid.\nDevelopment of American Patent Law\n   During the first years of the patent system, no patents\nwere issued on methods of doing business.30 Indeed, for\nsome time, there were serious doubts as to “the patentabil\nity of processes per se,” as distinct from the physical end\nproduct or the tools used to perform a process. Id., at 581–\n582.31\n   Thomas Jefferson was the “ ‘first administrator of our\npatent system’ ” and “the author of the 1793 Patent Act.”\nGraham, 383 U. S., at 7.

S. 780\n\n(1877), in which we held that “a process may be patentable irrespective\nof the particular form of the instrumentalities used,” and therefore one\nmay patent “an act, or series of acts, performed upon the subject matter\nto be transformed and reduced to a different state or thing.” Id., at 788.\n26                      BILSKI v.

He drafted the 1793 Act,\nid., at 7, and, years later, explained that in that Act “ ‘the\nwhole was turned over to the judiciary, to be matured into\na system, under which every one might know when his\nactions were safe and lawful,’ ” id., at 10 (quoting Letter to\nIssac McPherson, in VI Writings of Thomas Jefferson 181–\n182 (H.

Thus “[a]lthough the\nPatent Act was amended, revised or codified some 50\ntimes between 1790 and 1950, Congress steered clear” of\nadding statutory requirements of patentability. Ibid. For\nnearly 160 years, Congress retained the term “useful arts,”\nsee, e.g., Act of July 4, 1836, ch. 357, 5 Stat. 117, leaving\n“wide latitude for judicial construction . . . to keep pace\nwith industrial development,” Berman, Method Claims, 17\nJ. Pat. Off. Soc. 713, 714 (1935) (hereinafter Berman).\n   Although courts occasionally struggled with defining\nwhat was a patentable “art” during those 160 years, they\nconsistently rejected patents on methods of doing busi\nness. The rationales for those decisions sometimes varied.\nBut there was an overarching theme, at least in dicta:\nBusiness methods are not patentable arts. See, e.g.,\nUnited States Credit Sys. Co. v.

But we consistently focused the inquiry on\nwhether an “art” was connected to a machine or physical\ntransformation,33 an inquiry that would have excluded\nmethods of doing business.\n   By the early 20th century, it was widely understood that\na series of steps for conducting business could not be\npatented.

See In re Bilski, 545 F. 3d 943, 974, and n. 18\n(CA Fed. 2008) (case below) (Dyk, J., concurring); Pollack 74–75;\nWalterscheid, To Promote the Progress 243.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

S., at\n184. The new terminology was added only in recognition\nof the fact that courts had been interpreting the category\n“art” by using the terms “process or method”; Congress\nthus wanted to avoid “the necessity of explanation that the\nword ‘art’ as used in this place means ‘process or method.’ ”\nS.

Rich to the New York Patent Law Associa\ntion 7–8 (Nov. 6, 1952).\n   As discussed above, by this time, courts had consistently\nconstrued the term “art” to exclude methods of doing\nbusiness. The 1952 Act likely captured that same mean\ning.38 Cf. Graham, 383 U. S., at 16–17 (reasoning that\nbecause a provision of the 1952 Act “paraphrases language\nwhich has often been used in decisions of the courts” and\nwas “added to the statute for uniformity and definiteness, ”\nthat provision should be treated as “a codification of judi\ncial precedents”).39 Indeed, Judge Rich, the main drafter\n——————\n   38 The 1952 Act also retained the language “invents or discovers,”\n\nwhich by that time had taken on a connotation that would tend to\nexclude business methods. See B. Evans & C. Evans, A Dictionary of\nContemporary Usage 137 (1957) (explaining that “discover; invent”\nmeans “to make or create something new, especially, in modern usage,\nsomething ingeniously devised to perform mechanical operations”).\n   39 As explained in Part II, supra, the Court engages in a Jekyll-and-\n\nHyde form of interpretation with respect to the word “process” in §101.\nIt rejects the interpretation I proffer because the words “process” and\n“method” do not, on their face, distinguish between different series of\nacts. Ante, at 10. But it also rejects many sorts of processes without a\ntextual basis for doing so. See ante, at 4–5, 7, 12–15. And while the\nCourts rests a great deal of weight on Parker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584\n(1978), for its analysis of abstract ideas, the Court minimizes Flook’s\nrejection of “a purely literal reading of §101,” as well as Flook’s reliance\non the historical backdrop of §101 and our understanding of what “the\nstatute was enacted to protect,” id., at 588–590, 593; see also Diamond\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Wash. L.

S., at 309, in\nturn quoting S. Rep. 1979, at 5). Similarly, the Court\nrelies on language from our opinion in Chakrabarty that\nwas based in part on this piece of legislative history. See\nante, at 4, 6.\n  This reliance is misplaced. We have never understood\n——————\nv. Diehr, 450 U.

But State\nStreet dealt with whether a piece of software could be patented and\naddressed only claims directed at machines, not processes. His opinion\nmay therefore be better understood merely as holding that an otherwise\npatentable process is not unpatentable simply because it is directed\ntoward the conduct of doing business—an issue the Court has no\noccasion to address today. See State Street, 149 F. 3d, at 1375.\n32                    BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n               STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthat piece of legislative history to mean that any series of\nsteps is a patentable process. Indeed, if that were so, then\nour many opinions analyzing what is a patentable process\nwere simply wastes of pages in the U. S. Reports. And to\naccept that errant piece of legislative history as widening\nthe scope of the patent law would contradict other evi\ndence in the congressional record, as well as our presump\ntion that the 1952 Act merely codified the meaning of\n“process” and did not expand it, see Diehr, 450 U. S., at\n184.\n   Taken in context, it is apparent that the quoted lan\nguage has a far less expansive meaning. The full sentence\nin the Committee Reports reads: “A person may have\n‘invented’ a machine or a manufacture, which may include\nanything under the sun that is made by man, but it is not\nnecessarily patentable under section 101 unless the condi\ntions of [this] title are fulfilled.” S. Rep. 1979, at 5; H. R.\nRep. 1923, at 6. Viewed as a whole, it seems clear that\nthis language does not purport to explain that “anything\nunder the sun” is patentable. Indeed, the language may\nbe understood to state the exact opposite: that “[a] person\nmay have ‘invented’ . . . anything under the sun,” but that\nthing “is not necessarily patentable under section 101.”\nThus, even in the Chakrabarty opinion, which relied on\nthis quote, we cautioned that the 1952 Reports did not\n“suggest that §101 has no limits or that it embraces every\ndiscovery.” 447 U. S., at 309.\n   Moreover, even if the language in the Committee Re\nports was meant to flesh out the meaning of any portion of\n§101, it did not purport to define the term “process.” The\nlanguage refers only to “manufacture[s]” and “machine[s],”\ntangible objects “made by man.” It does not reference the\n“process” category of subject matter (nor could a process be\ncomfortably described as something “made by man”). The\nlanguage may also be understood merely as defining the\nterm “invents” in §101. As Judge Dyk explained in his\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          33\n\n              STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nopinion below, the phrase “made by man” “is reminiscent”\nof a 1790’s description of the limits of English patent law,\nthat an “invention must be ‘made by man’ ” and cannot be\n“ ‘a philosophical principle only, neither organized or capa\nble of being organized’ from a patentable manufacture.”\n545 F. 3d, at 976 (quoting Hornblower v. Boulton, 8 T. R.\n95, 98 (K. B. 1799)).\n    The 1952 Act, in short, cannot be understood as expand\ning the scope of patentable subject matter by suggesting\nthat any series of steps may be patented as a “process”\nunder §101. If anything, the Act appears to have codified\nthe conclusion that subject matter which was understood\nnot to be patentable in 1952 was to remain unpatentable.\n    Our recent case law reinforces my view that a series of\nsteps for conducting business is not a “process” under\n§101. Since Congress passed the 1952 Act, we have never\nruled on whether that Act authorizes patents on business\nmethods. But we have cast significant doubt on that\nproposition by giving substantial weight to the machine\nor-transformation test, as general methods of doing busi\nness do not pass that test. And more recently, Members of\nthis Court have noted that patents on business methods\nare of “suspect validity.” eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L. L.\nC., 547 U. S. 388, 397 (2006) (KENNEDY, J., concurring).\n                       *    *    *\n  Since at least the days of Assyrian merchants, people\nhave devised better and better ways to conduct business.\nYet it appears that neither the Patent Clause, nor early\npatent law, nor the current §101 contemplated or was\npublicly understood to mean that such innovations are\npatentable. Although it may be difficult to define with\nprecision what is a patentable “process” under §101, the\nhistorical clues converge on one conclusion: A business\nmethod is not a “process.” And to the extent that there is\nambiguity, we should be mindful of our judicial role. “[W]e\n34                    BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n               STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nmust proceed cautiously when we are asked to extend\npatent rights” into an area that the Patent Act likely was\nnot “enacted to protect,” Flook, 437 U. S., at 596, 593, lest\nwe create a legal regime that Congress never would have\nendorsed, and that can be repaired only by disturbing\nsettled property rights.\n                               V\n   Despite the strong historical evidence that a method of\ndoing business does not constitute a “process” under §101,\npetitioners nonetheless argue—and the Court suggests in\ndicta, ante, at 10–11—that a subsequent law, the First\nInventor Defense Act of 1999, “must be read together”\nwith §101 to make business methods patentable. Brief for\nPetitioners 29. This argument utilizes a flawed method of\nstatutory interpretation and ignores the motivation for the\n1999 Act.\n   In 1999, following a Federal Circuit decision that inti\nmated business methods could be patented, see State\nStreet, 149 F. 3d 1368, Congress moved quickly to limit\nthe potential fallout. Congress passed the 1999 Act, codi\nfied at 35 U. S. C. §273, which provides a limited defense\nto claims of patent infringement, see §273(b), regarding\ncertain “method[s] of doing or conducting business,”\n§273(a)(3).\n   It is apparent, both from the content and history of the\nAct, that Congress did not in any way ratify State Street\n(or, as petitioners contend, the broadest possible reading\nof State Street). The Act merely limited one potential\neffect of that decision: that businesses might suddenly find\nthemselves liable for innocently using methods they as\nsumed could not be patented. The Act did not purport to\namend the limitations in §101 on eligible subject matter.\nIndeed, Congress placed the statute in Part III of Title 35,\nwhich addresses “Patents and Protection of Patent\nRights,” rather than in Part II, which contains §101 and\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          35\n\n               STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\naddresses “Patentability of Inventions and Grant of Pat\nents.” Particularly because petitioners’ reading of the\n1999 Act would expand §101 to cover a category of proc\nesses that have not “historically been eligible” for patents,\nDiehr, 450 U. S., at 184, we should be loathe to conclude\nthat Congress effectively amended §101 without saying so\nclearly. We generally presume that Congress “does not,\none might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.” Whitman\nv. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 468\n(2001).\n   The Act therefore is, at best, merely evidence of 1999\nlegislative views on the meaning of the earlier, 1952 Act.\n“[T]he views of a subsequent Congress,” however, “form a\nhazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one.”\nUnited States v. Price, 361 U. S. 304, 313 (1960). When a\nlater statute is offered as “an expression of how the . . .\nCongress interpreted a statute passed by another Con\ngress . . . a half century before,” “such interpretation has\nvery little, if any, significance.” Rainwater v. United\nStates, 356 U. S. 590, 593 (1958).\n   Furthermore, even assuming that Congress’ views at\nthe turn of the 21st century could potentially serve as a\nvalid basis for interpreting a statute passed in the mid\n20th century, the First Inventor Defense Act does not aid\npetitioners because it does not show that the later Con\ngress itself understood §101 to cover business methods. If\nanything, it shows that a few judges on the Federal Cir\ncuit understood §101 in that manner and that Congress\nunderstood what those judges had done. The Act appears\nto reflect surprise and perhaps even dismay that business\nmethods might be patented. Thus, in the months follow\ning State Street, congressional authorities lamented that\n“business methods and processes . . . until recently were\nthought not to be patentable,” H. R. Rep. No. 106–464,\np. 121 (1999); accord, H. R. Rep. No. 106–287, pt. 1, p. 31\n36                        BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                  STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n(1999).41 The fact that Congress decided it was appropri\nate to create a new defense to claims that business method\npatents were being infringed merely demonstrates recog\nnition that such claims could create a significant new\nproblem for the business community.\n  The Court nonetheless states that the 1999 Act “ac\nknowledges that there may be business method patents,”\nthereby “clarify[ing]” its “understanding” of §101. Ante, at\n11. More specifically, the Court worries that if we were to\ninterpret the 1952 Act to exclude business methods, our\ninterpretation “would render §273 meaningless.” Ibid. I\nagree that “[a] statute should be construed so that effect is\ngiven to all its provisions.” Corley v. United States, 556\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 9) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). But it is a different matter altogether\nwhen the Court construes one statute, the 1952 Act, to\ngive effect to a different statute, the 1999 Act. The canon\non which the Court relies is predicated upon the idea that\n“[a] statute is passed as a whole.” 2A N. Singer & J.\nSinger, Statutes and Statutory Construction §46:5, p. 189\n(7th ed. 2007). But the two statutes in question were not\npassed as a whole.\n  Put another way, we ordinarily assume, quite sensibly,\nthat Congress would not in one statute include two provi\nsions that are at odds with each other. But as this case\nshows, that sensible reasoning can break down when\n\n——————\n  41 See also 145 Cong. Rec. 30985 (1999) (remarks of Sen.

The only support the Court offers for this proposition is a 1937\nopinion for three Justices, in Hague v. Committee for Industrial Or\nganization, 307 U. S. 496, 528–530 (1939) (opinion of Stone, J.). But\nthat opinion is inapposite. Although Justice Stone stated that two\nprovisions “must be read together,” id., at 530, he did so to explain that\nan ambiguity in a later-in-time statute must be understood in light of\nthe earlier-in-time framework against which the ambiguous statute\nwas passed, id., at 528–530, particularly because the later statute\nexplicitly stated that it “shall not be construed to apply” to the provi\nsion created by an earlier Act, id., at 528.\n  43 I am not trying to “overcome” an “established rule of statutory in\n\nterpretation” with “judicial speculation as to the subjective intent of\nvarious legislators,” ante, at 11, but, rather, I am explaining why the\nCourt has illogically expanded the canon upon which it relies beyond\nthat canon’s logical underpinnings.\n38                        BILSKI v.

And absent a discernible signal\nfrom Congress, we proceed cautiously when dealing with\npatents that press on the limits of the “ ‘standard written\ninto the constitution,’ ” Graham, 383 U.

We should not casually risk exceeding\nthe constitutional limitation on Congress’ behalf.\n   The Court has kept this “constitutional standard” in\nmind when deciding what is patentable subject matter\nunder §101. For example, we have held that no one can\npatent “laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract\nideas.” Diehr, 450 U. S., at 185. These “are the basic tools\nof scientific and technological work,” Benson, 409 U. S., at\n67, and therefore, if patented, would stifle the very pro\ngress that Congress is authorized to promote, see, e.g.,\nO’Reilly, 15 How., at 113 (explaining that Morse’s patent\non electromagnetism for writing would preempt a wide\n——————\ntechnology”).\n40                      BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n                STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nswath of technological developments).\n   Without any legislative guidance to the contrary, there\nis a real concern that patents on business methods would\npress on the limits of the “standard expressed in the Con\nstitution,” Graham, 383 U. S., at 6, more likely stifling\nprogress than “promot[ing]” it. U. S. Const., Art. I, §8,\ncl. 8. I recognize that not all methods of doing business\nare the same, and that therefore the constitutional “bal\nance,” Bonito Boats, 489 U. S., at 146, may vary within\nthis category. Nevertheless, I think that this balance\ngenerally supports the historic understanding of the term\n“process” as excluding business methods. And a categori\ncal analysis fits with the purpose, as Thomas Jefferson\nexplained, of ensuring that “ ‘every one might know when\nhis actions were safe and lawful,’ ” Graham, 383 U. S., at\n10; see also Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabu\nshiki Co., 535 U.

Wells\nElectronics, Inc., 525 U. S. 55, 63 (1998). Although there\nis certainly disagreement about the need for patents,\nscholars generally agree that when innovation is expen\nsive, risky, and easily copied, inventors are less likely to\nundertake the guaranteed costs of innovation in order to\nobtain the mere possibility of an invention that others can\ncopy.45 Both common sense and recent economic scholar\nship suggest that these dynamics of cost, risk, and reward\n——————\n  45 See generally W.

S., at 184, than for methods of doing business.\n   Many have expressed serious doubts about whether\npatents are necessary to encourage business innovation.47\nDespite the fact that we have long assumed business\nmethods could not be patented, it has been remarked that\n“the chief business of the American people, is business.”48\nFederal Express developed an overnight delivery service\nand a variety of specific methods (including shipping\nthrough a central hub and online package tracking) with\nout a patent. Although counterfactuals are a dubious form\nof analysis, I find it hard to believe that many of our en\ntrepreneurs forwent business innovation because they\ncould not claim a patent on their new methods.\n   “[C]ompanies have ample incentives to develop business\nmethods even without patent protection, because the\ncompetitive marketplace rewards companies that use\nmore efficient business methods.” Burk & Lemley 1618.49\nInnovators often capture advantages from new business\nmethods notwithstanding the risk of others copying their\ninnovation.

It gener\nally does not require the same “enormous costs in terms of\ntime, research, and development,” Bicron, 416 U. S., at\n480, and thus does not require the same kind of “compen\nsation to [innovators] for their labor, toil, and expense,”\nSeymour v.

Metabolite Laboratories, Inc.,\n548 U. S. 124, 126–127 (2006) (BREYER, J., dissenting\nfrom dismissal of certiorari). Patents “can discourage\nresearch by impeding the free exchange of information,”\nfor example, by forcing people to “avoid the use of poten\ntially patented ideas, by leading them to conduct costly\nand time-consuming searches of existing or pending pat\nents, by requiring complex licensing arrangements, and by\nraising the costs of using the patented” methods. Id., at\n127. Although “[e]very patent is the grant of a privilege of\nexacting tolls from the public,” Great Atlantic, 340 U. S.,\nat 154 (Douglas, J., concurring), the tolls of patents on\nbusiness methods may be especially high.\n   The primary concern is that patents on business meth\nods may prohibit a wide swath of legitimate competition\nand innovation. As one scholar explains, “it is useful to\nconceptualize knowledge as a pyramid: the big ideas are\non top; specific applications are at the bottom.” Dreyfuss\n275. The higher up a patent is on the pyramid, the\ngreater the social cost and the greater the hindrance to\nfurther innovation.53 Thus, this Court stated in Benson\n——————\n 53 See   Dreyfuss 276; Merges & Nelson, On the Complex Economics of\n44                       BILSKI v.

Busi\nness methods are similarly often closer to “big ideas,” as\nthey are the basic tools of commercial work. They are\nalso, in many cases, the basic tools of further business\ninnovation: Innovation in business methods is often a\nsequential and complementary process in which imitation\nmay be a “spur to innovation” and patents may “become an\nimpediment.” Bessen & Maskin, Sequential Innovation,\nPatents, and Imitation, 40 RAND J.

S., at\n6. But Congress has not, either explicitly or implicitly,\ndetermined that patents on methods of doing business\nwould effectuate this aim. And as I understand their\npractical consequences, it is hard to see how they would.\n                              VII\n  The Constitution grants to Congress an important\npower to promote innovation. In its exercise of that power,\nCongress has established an intricate system of intellec\ntual property. The scope of patentable subject matter\nunder that system is broad. But it is not endless. In the\nabsence of any clear guidance from Congress, we have only\nlimited textual, historical, and functional clues on which\nto rely. Those clues all point toward the same conclusion:\nthat petitioners’ claim is not a “process” within the mean\ning of §101 because methods of doing business are not, in\nthemselves, covered by the statute. In my view, acknowl\nedging as much would be a far more sensible and re\nstrained way to resolve this case. Accordingly, while I\nconcur in the judgment, I strongly disagree with the\nCourt’s disposition of this case.\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

S. C. §101. Ante, at\n2 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). This Court has\nnever before held that so-called “business methods” are\npatentable, and, in my view, the text, history, and pur\nposes of the Patent Act make clear that they are not.\nAnte, at 10–47. I would therefore decide this case on that\nground, and I join JUSTICE STEVENS’ opinion in full.\n  I write separately, however, in order to highlight the\nsubstantial agreement among many Members of the Court\non many of the fundamental issues of patent law raised by\nthis case. In light of the need for clarity and settled law in\nthis highly technical area, I think it appropriate to do so.\n                             II\n  In addition to the Court’s unanimous agreement that\nthe claims at issue here are unpatentable abstract ideas, it\nis my view that the following four points are consistent\n2                     BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nwith both the opinion of the Court and JUSTICE STEVENS’\nopinion concurring in the judgment:\n   First, although the text of §101 is broad, it is not with\nout limit. See ante, at 4–5 (opinion of the Court); ante, at\n10 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). “[T]he underly\ning policy of the patent system [is] that ‘the things which\nare worth to the public the embarrassment of an exclusive\npatent,’ . . . must outweigh the restrictive effect of the\nlimited patent monopoly.” Graham v. John Deere Co. of\nKansas City, 383 U. S. 1, 10–11 (1966) (quoting Letter\nfrom Thomas Jefferson to Isaac McPherson (Aug. 13,\n1813), in 6 Writings of Thomas Jefferson 181 (H. Washing\nton ed.)). The Court has thus been careful in interpreting\nthe Patent Act to “determine not only what is protected,\nbut also what is free for all to use.” Bonito Boats, Inc. v.\nThunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141, 151 (1989). In\nparticular, the Court has long held that “[p]henomena of\nnature, though just discovered, mental processes, and\nabstract intellectual concepts are not patentable” under\n§101, since allowing individuals to patent these funda\nmental principles would “wholly pre-empt” the public’s\naccess to the “basic tools of scientific and technological\nwork.” Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63, 67, 72 (1972);\nsee also, e.g., Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 185 (1981);\nDiamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, 309 (1980).\n   Second, in a series of cases that extend back over a\ncentury, the Court has stated that “[t]ransformation and\nreduction of an article to a different state or thing is the\nclue to the patentability of a process claim that does not\ninclude particular machines.” Diehr, supra, at 184 (em\nphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted); see also,\ne.g., Benson, supra, at 70; Parker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584,\n588, n. 9 (1978); Cochrane v. Deener, 94 U. S. 780, 788\n(1877). Application of this test, the so-called “machine-or\ntransformation test,” has thus repeatedly helped the Court\nto determine what is “a patentable ‘process.’ ” Flook, supra,\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nat 589.\n   Third, while the machine-or-transformation test has\nalways been a “useful and important clue,” it has never\nbeen the “sole test” for determining patentability. Ante, at\n8; see also ante, at 1 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judg\nment); Benson, supra, at 71 (rejecting the argument that\n“no process patent could ever qualify” for protection under\n§101 “if it did not meet the [machine-or-transformation]\nrequirements”). Rather, the Court has emphasized that a\nprocess claim meets the requirements of §101 when, “con\nsidered as a whole,” it “is performing a function which the\npatent laws were designed to protect (e.g., transforming or\nreducing an article to a different state or thing).” Diehr,\nsupra, at 192. The machine-or-transformation test is thus\nan important example of how a court can determine pat\nentability under §101, but the Federal Circuit erred in this\ncase by treating it as the exclusive test.\n   Fourth, although the machine-or-transformation test is\nnot the only test for patentability, this by no means indi\ncates that anything which produces a “ ‘useful, concrete,\nand tangible result,’ ” State Street Bank & Trust Co. v.\nSignature Financial Group, Inc., 149 F. 3d 1368, 1373 (CA\nFed. 1998), is patentable. “[T]his Court has never made\nsuch a statement and, if taken literally, the statement\nwould cover instances where this Court has held the con\ntrary.” Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings v. Metabo\nlite Laboratories, Inc., 548 U. S. 124, 136 (2006) (BREYER,\nJ., dissenting from dismissal of certiorari as improvidently\ngranted); see also, e.g., O’Reilly v. Morse, 15 How. 62, 117\n(1854); Flook, supra, at 590. Indeed, the introduction of\nthe “useful, concrete, and tangible result” approach to\npatentability, associated with the Federal Circuit’s State\nStreet decision, preceded the granting of patents that\n“ranged from the somewhat ridiculous to the truly ab\nsurd.” In re Bilski, 545 F. 3d 943, 1004 (CA Fed. 2008)\n(Mayer, J., dissenting) (citing patents on, inter alia, a\n4                     BILSKI v. KAPPOS\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\n“method of training janitors to dust and vacuum using\nvideo displays,” a “system for toilet reservations,” and a\n“method of using color-coded bracelets to designate dating\nstatus in order to limit ‘the embarrassment of rejection’ ”);\nsee also Brief for Respondent 40–41, and n. 20 (listing\ndubious patents). To the extent that the Federal Circuit’s\ndecision in this case rejected that approach, nothing in\ntoday’s decision should be taken as disapproving of that\ndetermination. See ante, at 16; ante, at 2, n. 1 (STEVENS,\nJ., concurring in judgment).\n   In sum, it is my view that, in reemphasizing that the\n“machine-or-transformation” test is not necessarily the\nsole test of patentability, the Court intends neither to de\nemphasize the test’s usefulness nor to suggest that many\npatentable processes lie beyond its reach.\n                        III\n  With these observations, I concur in the Court’s\njudgment.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/149585/", "sha1": "01aaeda52c87cdac60713d3d0b554d0d136742a7", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-06-28T10:22:19"}
