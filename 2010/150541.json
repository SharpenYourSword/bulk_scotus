REED, WASHINGTON SECRETARY OF \n\n                    STATE, ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 09–559.      Argued April 28, 2010—Decided June 24, 2010\nThe Washington Constitution allows citizens to challenge state laws by\n  referendum. To initiate a referendum, proponents must file a peti\n  tion with the secretary of state that contains valid signatures of reg\n  istered Washington voters equal to or exceeding four percent of the\n  votes cast for the office of Governor at the last gubernatorial election.\n  A valid submission requires not only a signature, but also the signer’s\n  address and the county in which he is registered to vote.\n     In May 2009, Washington Governor Christine Gregoire signed into\n  law Senate Bill 5688, which expanded the rights and responsibilities\n  of state-registered domestic partners, including same-sex domestic\n  partners. That same month, Protect Marriage Washington, one of\n  the petitioners here, was organized as a “State Political Committee”\n  for the purpose of collecting the petition signatures necessary to place\n  a referendum challenging SB 5688 on the ballot. If the referendum\n  made it onto the ballot, Protect Marriage Washington planned to en\n  courage voters to reject SB 5688. Protect Marriage Washington sub\n  mitted the petition with more than 137,000 signatures to the secre\n  tary of state, and after conducting the verification and canvassing\n  process required by state law, the secretary determined that the peti\n  tion contained sufficient signatures to qualify the referendum (R–71)\n  for the ballot. Respondent intervenors invoked the Washington Pub\n  lic Records Act (PRA) to obtain copies of the petition, which contained\n  the signers’ names and addresses.\n     The R–71 petition sponsor and certain signers filed a complaint\n  and a motion for injunctive relief in Federal District Court, seeking to\n  enjoin the public release of the petition. Count I alleges that the PRA\n  “is unconstitutional as applied to referendum petitions,” and Count II\n2                              DOE v. REED\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    alleges that the PRA “is unconstitutional as applied to the Referen\n    dum 71 petition because there is a reasonable probability that the\n    signatories . . . will be subjected to threats, harassment, and repri\n    sals.” Determining that the PRA burdened core political speech, the\n    District Court held that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits\n    of Count I and granted a preliminary injunction preventing release of\n    the signatory information. Reviewing only Count I, the Ninth Circuit\n    held that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their claim that the\n    PRA is unconstitutional as applied to referendum petitions in gen\n    eral, and therefore reversed.\nHeld: Disclosure of referendum petitions does not as a general matter\n violate the First Amendment. Pp. 4–13.\n    (a) Because plaintiffs’ Count I claim and the relief that would fol\n low—an injunction barring the secretary of state from releasing ref\n erendum petitions to the public—reach beyond the particular circum\n stances of these plaintiffs, they must satisfy this Court’s standards\n for a facial challenge to the extent of that reach. See United States v.\n Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 4–5.\n    (b) The compelled disclosure of signatory information on referen\n dum petitions is subject to review under the First Amendment. In\n most cases, the individual’s signature will express the view that the\n law subject to the petition should be overturned. Even if the signer is\n agnostic as to the merits of the underlying law, his signature still ex\n presses the political view that the question should be considered “by\n the whole electorate.” Meyer v. Grant, 486 U. S. 414, 421. In either\n case, the expression of a political view implicates a First Amendment\n right.\n    Petition signing remains expressive even when it has legal effect in\n the electoral process. But that does not mean that the electoral con\n text is irrelevant to the nature of this Court’s First Amendment re\n view. States have significant flexibility in implementing their own\n voting systems. To the extent a regulation concerns the legal effect of\n a particular activity in that process, the government is afforded sub\n stantial latitude to enforce that regulation. Also pertinent is the fact\n that the PRA is not a prohibition on speech, but a disclosure re\n quirement that may burden “the ability to speak, but [does] ‘not pre\n vent anyone from speaking.’ ” Citizens United v. Federal Election\n Comm’n, 558 U. S. ___, ___. This Court has reviewed First Amend\n ment challenges to disclosure requirements in the electoral context\n under an “exacting scrutiny” standard, requiring “a ‘substantial rela\n tion’ between the disclosure requirement and a ‘sufficiently impor\n tant’ governmental interest.” Id., at ___. To withstand this scrutiny,\n “the strength of the governmental interest must reflect the serious\n ness of the actual burden on First Amendment rights.” Davis v. Fed\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\neral Election Comm’n, 554 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 5–7.\n   (c) The State’s interest in preserving the integrity of the electoral\nprocess suffices to defeat the argument that the PRA is unconstitu\ntional with respect to referendum petitions in general. That interest\nis particularly strong with respect to efforts to root out fraud. But\nthe State’s interest is not limited to combating fraud; it extends to ef\nforts to ferret out invalid signatures caused not by fraud but by sim\nple mistake, such as duplicate signatures or signatures of individuals\nwho are not registered to vote in the State. The State’s interest also\nextends more generally to promoting transparency and accountability\nin the electoral process.\n   Plaintiffs contend that disclosure is not sufficiently related to the\ninterest of protecting the integrity of the electoral process to with\nstand First Amendment scrutiny. They argue that disclosure is not\nnecessary because the secretary of state is already charged with veri\nfying and canvassing the names on a petition, a measure’s advocates\nand opponents can observe that process, any citizen can challenge the\nsecretary’s actions in court, and criminal penalties reduce the danger\nof fraud in the petition process. But the secretary’s verification and\ncanvassing will not catch all the invalid signatures, and public disclo\nsure can help cure the inadequacies of the secretary’s process. Dis\nclosure also helps prevent difficult-to-detect fraud such as outright\nforgery and “bait and switch” fraud, in which an individual signs the\npetition based on a misrepresentation of the underlying issue. And\ndisclosure promotes transparency and accountability in the electoral\nprocess to an extent other measures cannot. Pp. 8–10.\n   (d) Plaintiffs’ main objection is that “the strength of the govern\nmental interest” does not “reflect the seriousness of the actual burden\non First Amendment rights.” Davis, supra, at ___. According to\nplaintiffs, the objective of those seeking disclosure is not to prevent\nfraud, but to publicly identify signatories and broadcast their politi\ncal views on the subject of the petition. Plaintiffs allege, for example,\nthat several groups plan to post the petitions in searchable form on\nthe Internet, and then encourage other citizens to seek out R–71 peti\ntion signers. That, plaintiffs argue, would subject them to threats,\nharassment, and reprisals.\n   The problem for plaintiffs is that their argument rests almost en\ntirely on the specific harm that would attend the disclosure of infor\nmation on the R–71 petition. But the question before the Court at\nthis stage of the litigation is whether disclosure of referendum peti\ntions in general violates the First Amendment. Faced with the\nState’s unrebutted arguments that only modest burdens attend the\ndisclosure of a typical petition, plaintiffs’ broad challenge to the PRA\nmust be rejected. But upholding the PRA against a broad-based chal\n4                             DOE v.

SAM REED, \n\n    WASHINGTON SECRETARY OF STATE, ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 24, 2010] \n\n\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n  The State of Washington allows its citizens to challenge\nstate laws by referendum. Roughly four percent of Wash\nington voters must sign a petition to place such a referen\ndum on the ballot. That petition, which by law must\ninclude the names and addresses of the signers, is then\nsubmitted to the government for verification and canvass\ning, to ensure that only lawful signatures are counted.\nThe Washington Public Records Act (PRA) authorizes\nprivate parties to obtain copies of government documents,\nand the State construes the PRA to cover submitted refer\nendum petitions.\n  This case arises out of a state law extending certain\nbenefits to same-sex couples, and a corresponding referen\ndum petition to put that law to a popular vote. Respon\ndent intervenors invoked the PRA to obtain copies of the\npetition, with the names and addresses of the signers.\nCertain petition signers and the petition sponsor objected,\narguing that such public disclosure would violate their\nrights under the First Amendment.\n2                        DOE v. REED\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  The course of this litigation, however, has framed the\nlegal question before us more broadly. The issue at this\nstage of the case is not whether disclosure of this particu\nlar petition would violate the First Amendment, but\nwhether disclosure of referendum petitions in general\nwould do so. We conclude that such disclosure does not as\na general matter violate the First Amendment, and we\ntherefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. We\nleave it to the lower courts to consider in the first instance\nthe signers’ more focused claim concerning disclosure of\nthe information on this particular petition, which is pend\ning before the District Court.\n                                I\n  The Washington Constitution reserves to the people the\npower to reject any bill, with a few limited exceptions not\nrelevant here, through the referendum process. Wash.\nConst., Art. II, §1(b). To initiate a referendum, proponents\nmust file a petition with the secretary of state that con\ntains valid signatures of registered Washington voters\nequal to or exceeding four percent of the votes cast for the\noffice of Governor at the last gubernatorial election.\n§§1(b), (d). A valid submission requires not only a signa\nture, but also the signer’s address and the county in which\nhe is registered to vote. Wash. Rev. Code §29A.72.130\n(2008).\n  In May 2009, Washington Governor Christine Gregoire\nsigned into law Senate Bill 5688, which “expand[ed] the\nrights and responsibilities” of state-registered domestic\npartners, including same-sex domestic partners. 586 F. 3d\n671, 675 (CA9 2009). That same month, Protect Marriage\nWashington, one of the petitioners here, was organized as\na “State Political Committee” for the purpose of collecting\nthe petition signatures necessary to place a referendum on\nthe ballot, which would give the voters themselves an\nopportunity to vote on SB 5688. App. 8–9. If the referen\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndum made it onto the ballot, Protect Marriage Washington\nplanned to encourage voters to reject SB 5688. Id., at 7, 9.\n  On July 25, 2009, Protect Marriage Washington submit\nted to the secretary of state a petition containing over\n137,000 signatures. See 586 F. 3d, at 675; Brief for Re\nspondent Washington Families Standing Together 6. The\nsecretary of state then began the verification and canvass\ning process, as required by Washington law, to ensure that\nonly legal signatures were counted. Wash. Rev. Code\n§29A.72.230. Some 120,000 valid signatures were re\nquired to place the referendum on the ballot. Sam Reed,\nWashington Secretary of State, Certification of Referen\ndum 71 (Sept. 2, 2009). The secretary of state determined\nthat the petition contained a sufficient number of valid\nsignatures, and the referendum (R–71) appeared on the\nNovember 2009 ballot. The voters approved SB 5688 by a\nmargin of 53% to 47%.\n  The PRA, Wash. Rev. Code §42.56.001 et seq., makes all\n“public records” available for public inspection and copy\ning. §42.56.070(1) (2008). The Act defines “[p]ublic re\ncord” as “any writing containing information relating to\nthe conduct of government or the performance of any\ngovernmental or proprietary function prepared, owned,\nused, or retained by any state or local agency.”\n§42.56.010(2). Washington takes the position that refer\nendum petitions are “public records.” Brief for Respon\ndent Reed 5.\n  By August 20, 2009, the secretary had received requests\nfor copies of the R–71 petition from an individual and four\nentities, including Washington Coalition for Open Gov\nernment (WCOG) and Washington Families Standing\nTogether (WFST), two of the respondents here. 586 F. 3d,\nat 675.       Two entities, WhoSigned.org and Know-\nThyNeighbor.org, issued a joint press release stating their\nintention to post the names of the R–71 petition signers\nonline, in a searchable format. See App. 11; 586 F. 3d, at\n4                       DOE v. REED\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n675.\n   The referendum petition sponsor and certain signers\nfiled a complaint and a motion for a preliminary injunction\nin the United States District Court for the Western Dis\ntrict of Washington, seeking to enjoin the secretary of\nstate from publicly releasing any documents that would\nreveal the names and contact information of the R–71\npetition signers. App. 4. Count I of the complaint alleges\nthat “[t]he Public Records Act is unconstitutional as ap\nplied to referendum petitions.” Id., at 16. Count II of the\ncomplaint alleges that “[t]he Public Records Act is uncon\nstitutional as applied to the Referendum 71 petition be\ncause there is a reasonable probability that the signatories\nof the Referendum 71 petition will be subjected to threats,\nharassment, and reprisals.” Id., at 17. Determining that\nthe PRA burdened core political speech, the District Court\nheld that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of\nCount I and granted them a preliminary injunction on\nthat count, enjoining release of the information on the\npetition. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2409888\"><a href=\"/opinion/2409888/doe-v-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">661</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1194</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1205–1206 (WD Wash.\n2009).\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir\ncuit reversed. Reviewing only Count I of the complaint,\nthe Court of Appeals held that plaintiffs were unlikely to\nsucceed on their claim that the PRA is unconstitutional as\napplied to referendum petitions generally. It therefore\nreversed the District Court’s grant of the preliminary\ninjunction. 586 F. 3d, at 681. We granted certiorari. 558\nU. S. ___ (2010).\n                            II\n  It is important at the outset to define the scope of the\nchallenge before us. As noted, Count I of the complaint\ncontends that the PRA “violates the First Amendment as\napplied to referendum petitions.” App. 16. Count II as\nserts that the PRA “is unconstitutional as applied to the\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nReferendum 71 petition.” Id., at 17. The District Court\ndecision was based solely on Count I; the Court of Appeals\ndecision reversing the District Court was similarly lim\nited. 586 F. 3d, at 676, n. 6. Neither court addressed\nCount II.\n   The parties disagree about whether Count I is properly\nviewed as a facial or as-applied challenge. Compare Reply\nBrief for Petitioners 8 (“Count I expressly made an as\napplied challenge”), with Brief for Respondent Reed 1\n(“This is a facial challenge to Washington’s Public Records\nAct”). It obviously has characteristics of both: The claim is\n“as applied” in the sense that it does not seek to strike the\nPRA in all its applications, but only to the extent it covers\nreferendum petitions. The claim is “facial” in that it is not\nlimited to plaintiffs’ particular case, but challenges appli\ncation of the law more broadly to all referendum petitions.\n   The label is not what matters. The important point is\nthat plaintiffs’ claim and the relief that would follow—an\ninjunction barring the secretary of state “from making\nreferendum petitions available to the public,” App. 16\n(Complaint Count I)—reach beyond the particular circum\nstances of these plaintiffs. They must therefore satisfy our\nstandards for a facial challenge to the extent of that reach.\nSee United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip\nop., at 10).\n                            III \n\n                             A\n\n   The compelled disclosure of signatory information on\nreferendum petitions is subject to review under the First\nAmendment. An individual expresses a view on a political\nmatter when he signs a petition under Washington’s\nreferendum procedure. In most cases, the individual’s\nsignature will express the view that the law subject to the\npetition should be overturned. Even if the signer is agnos\ntic as to the merits of the underlying law, his signature\n6                       DOE v. REED\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstill expresses the political view that the question should\nbe considered “by the whole electorate.” Meyer v. Grant,\n486 U. S. 414, 421 (1988). In either case, the expression of\na political view implicates a First Amendment right. The\nState, having “cho[sen] to tap the energy and the legiti\nmizing power of the democratic process, . . . must accord\nthe participants in that process the First Amendment\nrights that attach to their roles.” Republican Party of\nMinn. v. White, 536 U. S. 765, 788 (2002) (internal quota\ntion marks and ellipsis omitted).\n   Respondents counter that signing a petition is a legally\noperative legislative act and therefore “does not involve\nany significant expressive element.” Brief for Respondent\nReed 31. It is true that signing a referendum petition may\nultimately have the legal consequence of requiring the\nsecretary of state to place the referendum on the ballot.\nBut we do not see how adding such legal effect to an ex\npressive activity somehow deprives that activity of its\nexpressive component, taking it outside the scope of the\nFirst Amendment. Respondents themselves implicitly\nrecognize that the signature expresses a particular view\npoint, arguing that one purpose served by disclosure is to\nallow the public to engage signers in a debate on the mer\nits of the underlying law. See, e.g., id., at 45; Brief for\nRespondent WCOG 49; Brief for Respondent WFST 58.\n   Petition signing remains expressive even when it has\nlegal effect in the electoral process. But that is not to say\nthat the electoral context is irrelevant to the nature of our\nFirst Amendment review. We allow States significant\nflexibility in implementing their own voting systems. See\nBurdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, 433–434 (1992). To the\nextent a regulation concerns the legal effect of a particular\nactivity in that process, the government will be afforded\nsubstantial latitude to enforce that regulation. Also perti\nnent to our analysis is the fact that the PRA is not a pro\nhibition on speech, but instead a disclosure requirement.\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  7\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n“[D]isclosure requirements may burden the ability to\nspeak, but they . . . do not prevent anyone from speaking.”\nCitizens United v.

Because we determine that the\nState’s interest in preserving the integrity of the electoral\nprocess suffices to defeat the argument that the PRA is\nunconstitutional with respect to referendum petitions in\ngeneral, we need not, and do not, address the State’s\n“informational” interest.\n   The State’s interest in preserving the integrity of the\nelectoral process is undoubtedly important. “States allow\ning ballot initiatives have considerable leeway to protect\nthe integrity and reliability of the initiative process, as\nthey have with respect to election processes generally.”\nACLF, 525 U. S., at 191. The State’s interest is particu\nlarly strong with respect to efforts to root out fraud, which\nnot only may produce fraudulent outcomes, but has a\nsystemic effect as well: It “drives honest citizens out of the\ndemocratic process and breeds distrust of our govern\nment.” Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U. S. 1, 4 (2006) (per\ncuriam); see also Crawford v. Marion County Election Bd.,\n553 U. S. 181, 196 (2008) (opinion of STEVENS, J.). The\n——————\nFirst Amendment interest, see supra, at 5–7—do not. See post, at 3–4,\nand n. 3. That line is not as sharp as JUSTICE SCALIA would have it; he\nhimself recognizes “the existence of a First Amendment interest in\nvoting,” post, at 6, which of course also can have legal effect. The\ndistinction becomes even fuzzier given that only some petition signing\nhas legal effect, and any such legal effect attaches only well after the\nexpressive act of signing, if the secretary determines that the petition\nsatisfies the requirements for inclusion on the ballot. See post, at 3.\nPetitions that do not qualify for the ballot of course carry no legal effect.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthreat of fraud in this context is not merely hypothetical;\nrespondents and their amici cite a number of cases of\npetition-related fraud across the country to support the\npoint. See Brief for Respondent Reed 43; Brief for State of\nOhio et al. as Amici Curiae 22–24.\n   But the State’s interest in preserving electoral integrity\nis not limited to combating fraud. That interest extends to\nefforts to ferret out invalid signatures caused not by fraud\nbut by simple mistake, such as duplicate signatures or\nsignatures of individuals who are not registered to vote in\nthe State. See Brief for Respondent Reed 42. That inter\nest also extends more generally to promoting transparency\nand accountability in the electoral process, which the\nState argues is “essential to the proper functioning of a\ndemocracy.” Id., at 39.\n   Plaintiffs contend that the disclosure requirements of\nthe PRA are not “sufficiently related” to the interest of\nprotecting the integrity of the electoral process. Brief for\nPetitioners 51. They argue that disclosure is not neces\nsary because the secretary of state is already charged with\nverifying and canvassing the names on a petition, advo\ncates and opponents of a measure can observe that proc\ness, and any citizen can challenge the secretary’s actions\nin court. See Wash. Rev. Code §§29A.72.230, 29A.72.240.\nThey also stress that existing criminal penalties reduce\nthe danger of fraud in the petition process. See Brief for\nPetitioners 50; §§29A.84.210, 29A.84.230, 29A.84.250.\n   But the secretary’s verification and canvassing will not\ncatch all invalid signatures: The job is large and difficult\n(the secretary ordinarily checks “only 3 to 5% of signa\ntures,” Brief for Respondent WFST 54), and the secretary\ncan make mistakes, too, see Brief for Respondent Reed 42.\nPublic disclosure can help cure the inadequacies of the\nverification and canvassing process.\n   Disclosure also helps prevent certain types of petition\nfraud otherwise difficult to detect, such as outright forgery\n10                          DOE v. REED\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nand “bait and switch” fraud, in which an individual signs\nthe petition based on a misrepresentation of the underly\ning issue. See Brief for Respondent WFST 9–11, 53–54;\ncf. Brief for Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian Political\nCaucus et al. as Amici Curiae 18–22 (detailing “bait and\nswitch” fraud in a petition drive in Massachusetts). The\nsigner is in the best position to detect these types of\nfraud, and public disclosure can bring the issue to the\nsigner’s attention.\n   Public disclosure thus helps ensure that the only signa\ntures counted are those that should be, and that the only\nreferenda placed on the ballot are those that garner\nenough valid signatures. Public disclosure also promotes\ntransparency and accountability in the electoral process to\nan extent other measures cannot. In light of the foregoing,\nwe reject plaintiffs’ argument and conclude that public\ndisclosure of referendum petitions in general is substan\ntially related to the important interest of preserving the\nintegrity of the electoral process.2\n                               C\n  Plaintiffs’ more significant objection is that “the\nstrength of the governmental interest” does not “reflect\nthe seriousness of the actual burden on First Amendment\nrights.” Davis, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18) (citing\nBuckley, 424 U. S., at 68, 71); see, e.g., Brief for Petitioners\n12–13, 30. According to plaintiffs, the objective of those\nseeking disclosure of the R–71 petition is not to prevent\nfraud, but to publicly identify those who had validly signed\nand to broadcast the signers’ political views on the subject\nof the petition. Plaintiffs allege, for example, that several\n——————\n  2 JUSTICE THOMAS’s contrary assessment of the relationship between\n\nthe disclosure of referendum petitions generally and the State’s inter\nests in this case is based on his determination that strict scrutiny\napplies, post, at 5 (dissenting opinion), rather than the standard of\nreview that we have concluded is appropriate, see supra, at 7.\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

See App. 11; Brief for Petitioners 8, 46–47.\n   Plaintiffs explain that once on the Internet, the petition\nsigners’ names and addresses “can be combined with\npublicly available phone numbers and maps,” in what will\neffectively become a blueprint for harassment and intimi\ndation. Id., at 46. To support their claim that they will be\nsubject to reprisals, plaintiffs cite examples from the\nhistory of a similar proposition in California, see, e.g., id.,\nat 2–6, 31–32, and from the experience of one of the peti\ntion sponsors in this case, see App. 9.\n   In related contexts, we have explained that those\nresisting disclosure can prevail under the First Amend\nment if they can show “a reasonable probability that the\ncompelled disclosure [of personal information] will sub\nject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from ei\nther Government officials or private parties.” Buckley,\nsupra, at 74; see also Citizens United, 558 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 52). The question before us, however, is not\nwhether PRA disclosure violates the First Amendment\nwith respect to those who signed the R–71 petition, or\nother particularly controversial petitions. The question\ninstead is whether such disclosure in general violates\nthe First Amendment rights of those who sign referen\ndum petitions.\n   The problem for plaintiffs is that their argument rests\nalmost entirely on the specific harm they say would attend\ndisclosure of the information on the R–71 petition, or on\nsimilarly controversial ones. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioners\n10, 26–29, 46, 56. But typical referendum petitions “con\ncern tax policy, revenue, budget, or other state law issues.”\nBrief for Respondent WFST 36 (listing referenda); see also\nApp. 26 (stating that in recent years the State has re\nceived PRA requests for petitions supporting initiatives\nconcerning limiting motor vehicle charges; government\n12                       DOE v. REED\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nregulation of private property; energy resource use by\ncertain electric utilities; long-term care services for the\nelderly and persons with disabilities; and state, county,\nand city revenue); id., at 26–27 (stating that in the past 20\nyears, referendum measures that have qualified for the\nballot in the State concerned land-use regulation; unem\nployment insurance; charter public schools; and insurance\ncoverage and benefits). Voters care about such issues,\nsome quite deeply—but there is no reason to assume that\nany burdens imposed by disclosure of typical referendum\npetitions would be remotely like the burdens plaintiffs fear\nin this case.\n  Plaintiffs have offered little in response. They have\nprovided us scant evidence or argument beyond the bur\ndens they assert disclosure would impose on R–71 petition\nsigners or the signers of other similarly controversial\npetitions. Indeed, what little plaintiffs do offer with\nrespect to typical petitions in Washington hurts, not\nhelps: Several other petitions in the State “have been\nsubject to release in recent years,” plaintiffs tell us, Brief\nfor Petitioners 50, but apparently that release has come\nwithout incident. Cf. Citizens United, supra, at ___ (slip\nop., at 55) (“Citizens United has been disclosing its donors\nfor years and has identified no instance of harassment or\nretaliation”).\n  Faced with the State’s unrebutted arguments that only\nmodest burdens attend the disclosure of a typical petition,\nwe must reject plaintiffs’ broad challenge to the PRA. In\ndoing so, we note—as we have in other election law disclo\nsure cases—that upholding the law against a broad-based\nchallenge does not foreclose a litigant’s success in a nar\nrower one. See Buckley, supra, at 74 (“minor parties” may\nbe exempt from disclosure requirements if they can show\n“a reasonable probability that the compelled disclosure of\na party’s contributors’ names will subject them to threats,\nharassment, or reprisals from either Government officials\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

SAM REED, \n\n    WASHINGTON SECRETARY OF STATE, ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [June 24, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO, concurring.\n   The Court holds that the disclosure under the Washing\nton Public Records Act (PRA), Wash. Rev. Code §42.56.001\net seq. (2008), of the names and addresses of persons who\nsign referendum petitions does not as a general matter\nviolate the First Amendment, ante, at 13, and I agree with\nthat conclusion.      Many referendum petitions concern\nrelatively uncontroversial matters, see ante, at 11–12, and\nplaintiffs have provided no reason to think that disclosure\nof signatory information in those contexts would signifi\ncantly chill the willingness of voters to sign. Plaintiffs’\nfacial challenge therefore must fail. See ante, at 2, 5.\n   Nonetheless, facially valid disclosure requirements can\nimpose heavy burdens on First Amendment rights in\nindividual cases. Acknowledging that reality, we have\nlong held that speakers can obtain as-applied exemptions\nfrom disclosure requirements if they can show “a reason\nable probability that the compelled disclosure of [personal\ninformation] will subject them to threats, harassment, or\nreprisals from either Government officials or private\nparties.” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 74 (1976) (per\ncuriam); see also Citizens United v. Federal Election\nComm’n, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 52); McCon\nnell v. Federal Election Comm’n, 540 U. S. 93, 197–198\n(2003); Brown v. Socialist Workers ’74 Campaign Comm.\n2                       DOE v. REED\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\n(Ohio), 459 U. S. 87, 93 (1982). Because compelled disclo\nsure can “burden the ability to speak,” Citizens United,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 51), and “seriously infringe on\nprivacy of association and belief guaranteed by the First\nAmendment,” Buckley, supra, at 64, the as-applied exemp\ntion plays a critical role in safeguarding First Amendment\nrights.\n                                I\n   The possibility of prevailing in an as-applied challenge\nprovides adequate protection for First Amendment rights\nonly if (1) speakers can obtain the exemption sufficiently\nfar in advance to avoid chilling protected speech and (2)\nthe showing necessary to obtain the exemption is not\noverly burdensome. With respect to the first requirement,\nthe as-applied exemption becomes practically worthless if\nspeakers cannot obtain the exemption quickly and well in\nadvance of speaking. To avoid the possibility that a dis\nclosure requirement might chill the willingness of voters\nto sign a referendum petition (and thus burden a circula\ntor’s ability to collect the necessary number of signatures,\ncf. Meyer v. Grant, 486 U. S. 414, 423 (1988)), voters must\nhave some assurance at the time when they are presented\nwith the petition that their names and identifying infor\nmation will not be released to the public. The only way a\ncirculator can provide such assurance, however, is if the\ncirculator has sought and obtained an as-applied exemp\ntion from the disclosure requirement well before circulat\ning the petition. Otherwise, the best the circulator could\ndo would be to tell voters that an exemption might be\nobtained at some point in the future. Such speculation\nwould often be insufficient to alleviate voters’ concerns\nabout the possibility of being subjected to threats, har\nassment, or reprisals. Cf. Citizens United, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 5–6) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part).\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)             3\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\n   Additionally, speakers must be able to obtain an as\napplied exemption without clearing a high evidentiary\nhurdle. We acknowledged as much in Buckley, where we\nnoted that “unduly strict requirements of proof could\nimpose a heavy burden” on speech. 424 U. S., at 74.\nRecognizing that speakers “must be allowed sufficient\nflexibility in the proof of injury to assure a fair considera\ntion of their claim,” we emphasized that speakers “need\nshow only a reasonable probability” that disclosure will\nlead to threats, harassment, or reprisals. Ibid. (emphasis\nadded). We stated that speakers could rely on a wide\narray of evidence to meet that standard, including “spe\ncific evidence of past or present harassment of [group]\nmembers,” “harassment directed against the organization\nitself,” or a “pattern of threats or specific manifestations of\npublic hostility.” Ibid. Significantly, we also made clear\nthat “[n]ew [groups] that have no history upon which to\ndraw may be able to offer evidence of reprisals and threats\ndirected against individuals or organizations holding\nsimilar views.” Ibid. From its inception, therefore, the as\napplied exemption has not imposed onerous burdens of\nproof on speakers who fear that disclosure might lead to\nharassment or intimidation.\n                            II\n  In light of those principles, the plaintiffs in this case\nhave a strong argument that the PRA violates the First\nAmendment as applied to the Referendum 71 petition.\n                             A\n   Consider first the burdens on plaintiffs’ First Amend\nment rights. The widespread harassment and intimida\ntion suffered by supporters of California’s Proposition 8\nprovides strong support for an as-applied exemption in the\npresent case. See Buckley, supra, at 74 (explaining that\nspeakers seeking as-applied relief from a disclosure re\n4                       DOE v. REED\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nquirement can rely on “evidence of reprisals and threats\ndirected against individuals or organizations holding\nsimilar views”). Proposition 8 amended the California\nConstitution to provide that “[o]nly marriage between a\nman and a woman is valid or recognized in California,”\nCal. Const., Art. I, §7.5, and plaintiffs submitted to the\nDistrict Court substantial evidence of the harassment\nsuffered by Proposition 8 supporters, see Declaration of\nScott F. Bieniek in No. C:09–5456 (WD Wash.), Exhs. 12,\n13. Members of this Court have also noted that harass\nment. See Hollingsworth v. Perry, 558 U. S. ___, ___\n(2010) (per curiam) (slip op., at 2–3); Citizens United, 558\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2–3) (opinion of THOMAS, J.).\nIndeed, if the evidence relating to Proposition 8 is not\nsufficient to obtain an as-applied exemption in this case,\none may wonder whether that vehicle provides any mean\ningful protection for the First Amendment rights of per\nsons who circulate and sign referendum and initiative\npetitions.\n   What is more, when plaintiffs return to the District\nCourt, they will have the opportunity to develop evidence\nof intimidation and harassment of Referendum 71 sup\nporters—an opportunity that was pretermitted because of\nthe District Court’s decision to grant a preliminary injunc\ntion on count 1 of plaintiffs’ complaint. See 661 F. Supp.\n2d 1194, 1205–1206 (WD Wash. 2009); Tr. of Oral Arg. 40–\n41. For example, plaintiffs allege that the campaign\nmanager for one of the plaintiff groups received threaten\ning e-mails and phone calls, and that the threats were so\nsevere that the manager filed a complaint with the local\nsheriff and had his children sleep in an interior room of\nhis home. App. 9–10.\n                           B\n  The inadequacy of the State’s interests in compelling\npublic disclosure of referendum signatory information\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nfurther confirms that courts should be generous in grant\ning as-applied relief in this context. See Buckley, supra, at\n71 (recognizing that the weakness of the State’s interests\nin an individual case can require exempting speakers from\ncompelled disclosure); Brown, 459 U. S., at 92–93 (same).\nAs the Court notes, respondents rely on two interests to\njustify compelled disclosure in this context: (1) providing\ninformation to voters about who supports a referendum\npetition; and (2) preserving the integrity of the referen\ndum process by detecting fraudulent and mistaken signa\ntures. Ante, at 8.\n                              1\n  In my view, respondents’ asserted informational interest\nwill not in any case be sufficient to trump the First\nAmendment rights of signers and circulators who face a\nthreat of harassment. Respondents maintain that publicly\ndisclosing the names and addresses of referendum signa\ntories provides the voting public with “insight into\nwhether support for holding a vote comes predominantly\nfrom particular interest groups, political or religious or\nganizations, or other group[s] of citizens,” and thus allows\nvoters to draw inferences about whether they should\nsupport or oppose the referendum. Brief for Respondent\nWashington Families Standing Together 58; see also Brief\nfor Respondent Reed 46–48. Additionally, respondents\nargue that disclosure “allows Washington voters to engage\nin discussion of referred measures with persons whose\nacts secured the election and suspension of state law.” Id.,\nat 45; see also Brief for Respondent Washington Families\nStanding Together 58.\n  The implications of accepting such an argument are\nbreathtaking. Were we to accept respondents’ asserted\ninformational interest, the State would be free to require\npetition signers to disclose all kinds of demographic infor\nmation, including the signer’s race, religion, political\n6                       DOE v. REED\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\naffiliation, sexual orientation, ethnic background, and\ninterest-group memberships. Requiring such disclosures,\nhowever, runs headfirst into a half century of our case\nlaw, which firmly establishes that individuals have a right\nto privacy of belief and association. See Rumsfeld v. Fo\nrum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U. S.\n47, 69 (2006); Brown, supra, at 91; Buckley, 424 U. S., at\n64; DeGregory v. Attorney General of N. H., 383 U. S. 825,\n829 (1966); Gibson v. Florida Legislative Investigation\nComm., 372 U. S. 539, 544 (1963); NAACP v. Alabama ex\nrel. Patterson, 357 U. S. 449, 462 (1958). Indeed, the\nState’s informational interest paints such a chilling pic\nture of the role of government in our lives that at oral\nargument the Washington attorney general balked when\nconfronted with the logical implications of accepting such\nan argument, conceding that the State could not require\npetition signers to disclose their religion or ethnicity. Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 37, 56.\n   Respondents’ informational interest is no more legiti\nmate when viewed as a means of providing the public with\ninformation needed to locate and contact supporters of a\nreferendum. In the name of pursuing such an interest, the\nState would be free to require petition signers to disclose\nany information that would more easily enable members\nof the voting public to contact them and engage them in\ndiscussion, including telephone numbers, e-mail ad\ndresses, and Internet aliases. Once again, permitting the\ngovernment to require speakers to disclose such informa\ntion runs against the current of our associational privacy\ncases. But more important, when speakers are faced with\na reasonable probability of harassment or intimidation,\nthe State no longer has any interest in enabling the public\nto locate and contact supporters of a particular measure—\nfor in that instance, disclosure becomes a means of facili\ntating harassment that impermissibly chills the exercise\nof First Amendment rights.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\n  In this case, two groups proposed to place on the Inter\nnet the names and addresses of all those who signed Ref\nerendum 71, and it is alleged that their express aim was to\nencourage “uncomfortable conversation[s].” 661 F. Supp.\n2d, at 1199 (internal quotation marks omitted). If this\ninformation is posted on the Internet, then anyone with\naccess to a computer could compile a wealth of information\nabout all of those persons, including in many cases all of\nthe following: the names of their spouses and neighbors,\ntheir telephone numbers, directions to their homes, pic\ntures of their homes, information about their homes (such\nas size, type of construction, purchase price, and mortgage\namount), information about any motor vehicles that they\nown, any court case in which they were parties, any in\nformation posted on a social networking site, and newspa\nper articles in which their names appeared (including such\nthings as wedding announcements, obituaries, and articles\nin local papers about their children’s school and athletic\nactivities). The potential that such information could be\nused for harassment is vast.\n                              2\n  Respondents also maintain that the State has an inter\nest in preserving the integrity of the referendum process\nand that public disclosure furthers that interest by help\ning the State detect fraudulent and mistaken signatures.\nI agree with the Court that preserving the integrity of the\nreferendum process constitutes a sufficiently important\nstate interest.

REED\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\nensure the integrity of the referendum process. The State\nof Washington first authorized voter initiatives via consti\ntutional amendment in 1912, and the following year the\nWashington Legislature passed a statute specifying the\nparticulars of the referendum process. See State ex rel.\nCase v. Superior Ct. for Thurston Cty., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash.</span> <span class=\"page\">623</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 628,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 462 (1914). Significantly, Washington’s laws\npertaining to initiatives and referenda did not then and do\nnot now authorize the public disclosure of signatory in\nformation. See Wash. Rev. Code §29A.72.010 et seq.; 1913\nWash. Laws. pp. 418–437. Instead, the public disclosure\nrequirement stems from the PRA, which was enacted in\n1972 and which requires the public disclosure of state\ndocuments generally, not referendum documents specifi\ncally. See Wash. Rev. Code §42.56.001 et seq. Indeed, if\nanything, Washington’s referenda and initiative laws\nsuggest that signatory information should remain confi\ndential: Outside observers are permitted to observe the\nsecretary of state’s verification and canvassing process\nonly “so long as they make no record of the names, ad\ndresses, or other information on the petitions or related\nrecords during the verification process,” §29A.72.230, and\nthe State is required to destroy all those petitions that fail\nto qualify for the ballot, §29A.72.200.\n   Second, the State fails to come to grips with the fact\nthat public disclosure of referendum signatory information\nis a relatively recent practice in Washington. Prior to the\nadoption of the PRA in 1972, the Washington attorney\ngeneral took the view that referendum petitions were not\nsubject to public disclosure. See Op. Wash. Atty. Gen. 55–\n57 No. 274, pp. 1–2 (May 28, 1956), online at\nhttp://www.atg.wa.gov/AGOOpinions/opinion.aspx?section\n=topic&id=10488 (all Internet materials as visited June\n17, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file) (de\nclaring that public disclosure of initiative petitions would\nbe “contrary to public policy” and would run contrary to “a\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\ntendency on the part of the legislature to regard the sign\ning of an initiative petition as a matter concerning only\nthe individual signers except in so far as necessary to\nsafeguard against abuses of the privilege”). Indeed, the\nsecretary of state represents on his Web site that even\nafter the PRA was enacted, “various Secretary of State\nadministrations took the position, from 1973 to 1998, that\nthe personal information on petition sheets were NOT\nsubject to disclosure.” B. Zylstra, The Disclosure History\nof Petition Sheets (Sept. 17, 2009), online at\nhttp://blogs.sos.wa.gov/FromOurCorner/index.php/2009/09/\nthe-disclosure-history-of-petition-sheets/.    Although the\nsecretary of state apparently changed this policy in the\nlate 1990’s, it appears that the secretary did not release\nany initiative petitions until 2006. Ibid. And to date, the\nsecretary has released only a handful of petitions. Ibid.;\nApp. 26. That history substantially undermines the\nState’s assertion that public disclosure is necessary to\nensure the integrity of the referendum process. For nearly\na century, Washington’s referendum process operated—\nand apparently operated successfully—without the public\ndisclosure of signatory information. The State has failed\nto explain how circumstances have changed so dramati\ncally in recent years that public disclosure is now\nrequired.\n  Third, the experiences of other States demonstrates that\npublicly disclosing the names and identifying information\nof referendum signatories is not necessary to protect\nagainst fraud and mistake. To give but one example,\nCalifornia has had more initiatives on the ballot than any\nother State save Oregon. See Initiative and Referendum\nInstitute, Initiative Use, p. 1 (Feb. 2009), online at\nhttp://www.iandrinstitute.org/IRI%20Initiative%20Use%2\n0%281904=2008%29.pdf.         Nonetheless, California law\nexplicitly protects the privacy of initiative and referendum\nsignatories. See Cal. Elec. Code Ann. §18650 (West 2003);\n10                      DOE v. REED\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nCal. Govt. Code Ann. §6253.5 (West 2008). It is thus\nentirely possible for a State to keep signatory information\nprivate and maintain a referendum and initiative process\nfree from fraud.\n   Finally, Washington could easily and cheaply employ\nalternative mechanisms for protecting against fraud and\nmistake that would be far more protective of circulators’\nand signers’ First Amendment rights. For example, the\nWashington attorney general represented to us at oral\nargument that “the Secretary of State’s first step after\nreceiving submitted petitions is to take them to his archiv\ning section and to have them digitized.” Tr. of Oral Arg.\n30. With a digitized list, it should be relatively easy for\nthe secretary to check for duplicate signatures on a refer\nendum petition. And given that the secretary maintains a\n“centralized, uniform, interactive computerized statewide\nvoter registration list that contains the name and registra\ntion information of every registered voter in the state,”\nWash. Rev. Code Ann. §29A.08.125(1) (West Supp. 2010),\nthe secretary could use a computer program to cross-check\nthe names and addresses on the petition with the names\nand addresses on the voter registration roles, thus ensur\ning the accuracy and legitimacy of each signature.\n   Additionally, using the digitized version of the referen\ndum petition, the State could set up a simple system for\nWashington citizens to check whether their names have\nbeen fraudulently signed to a petition. For example, on\nhis Web site, the secretary maintains an interface that\nallows voters to confirm their voter registration informa\ntion simply by inputting their name and date of birth. See\nhttp://wei.secstate.wa.gov/osos/VoterVault/Pages/MyVote.a\nspx. Presumably the secretary could set up a similar\ninterface for referendum petitions. Indeed, the process\nwould seem to be all the more simple given that Washing\nton requires a “unique identifier [to] be assigned to each\nregistered voter in the state.” §29A.08.125(4).\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

These mechanisms of direct democracy are\nnot compelled by the Federal Constitution. It is instead\nup to the people of each State, acting in their sovereign\ncapacity, to decide whether and how to permit legislation\nby popular action. States enjoy “considerable leeway” to\nchoose the subjects that are eligible for placement on the\nballot and to specify the requirements for obtaining ballot\naccess (e.g., the number of signatures required, the time\nfor submission, and the method of verification). Buckley v.\nAmerican Constitutional Law Foundation, Inc., 525 U. S.\n182, 191 (1999). As the Court properly recognizes, each of\nthese structural decisions “inevitably affects—at least to\nsome degree—the individual’s right” to speak about politi\ncal issues and “to associate with others for political ends.”\nAnderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 788 (1983). For\ninstance, requiring petition signers to be registered voters\nor to use their real names no doubt limits the ability or\nwillingness of some individuals to undertake the expres\n2                       DOE v. REED\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nsive act of signing a petition. Regulations of this nature,\nhowever, stand “a step removed from the communicative\naspect of petitioning,” and the ability of States to impose\nthem can scarcely be doubted. Buckley, 525 U. S., at 215\n(O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissent\ning in part); see also McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n,\n514 U. S. 334, 345 (1995) (contrasting measures to “control\nthe mechanics of the electoral process” with the “regula\ntion of pure speech”). It is by no means necessary for a\nState to prove that such “reasonable, nondiscriminatory\nrestrictions” are narrowly tailored to its interests. Ander\nson, 460 U. S., at 788.\n   The Court today confirms that the State of Washington’s\ndecision to make referendum petition signatures available\nfor public inspection falls squarely within the realm of\npermissible election-related regulations. Cf. Buckley, 525\nU. S., at 200 (describing a state law requiring petition\ncirculators to submit affidavits containing their names\nand addresses as “exemplif[ying] the type of regulation”\nthat States may adopt). Public disclosure of the identity of\npetition signers, which is the rule in the overwhelming\nmajority of States that use initiatives and referenda,\nadvances States’ vital interests in “[p]reserving the integ\nrity of the electoral process, preventing corruption, and\nsustaining the active, alert responsibility of the individual\ncitizen in a democracy for the wise conduct of govern\nment.” First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765,\n788–789 (1978) (internal quotation marks and alterations\nomitted); see also Citizens United v. Federal Election\nComm’n, 558 U.

In a society “in which the citizenry is the final\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\njudge of the proper conduct of public business,” openness\nin the democratic process is of “critical importance.” Cox\nBroadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469, 495 (1975); see\nalso post, at 4 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (noting\nthat “[t]he public nature of federal lawmaking is constitu\ntionally required”).\n   On the other side of the ledger, I view the burden of\npublic disclosure on speech and associational rights as\nminimal in this context. As this Court has observed with\nrespect to campaign-finance regulations, “disclosure re\nquirements . . . ‘do not prevent anyone from speaking.’ ”\nCitizens United, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 51). When it\ncomes to initiatives and referenda, the impact of public\ndisclosure on expressive interests is even more attenuated.\nWhile campaign-finance disclosure injects the government\ninto what would otherwise have been private political\nactivity, the process of legislating by referendum is inher\nently public. To qualify a referendum for the ballot, citi\nzens are required to sign a petition and supply identifying\ninformation to the State. The act of signing typically\noccurs in public, and the circulators who collect and sub\nmit signatures ordinarily owe signers no guarantee of\nconfidentiality. For persons with the “civic courage” to\nparticipate in this process, post, at 10 (opinion of SCALIA,\nJ.), the State’s decision to make accessible what they\nvoluntarily place in the public sphere should not deter\nthem from engaging in the expressive act of petition sign\ning. Disclosure of the identity of petition signers, more\nover, in no way directly impairs the ability of anyone to\nspeak and associate for political ends either publicly or\nprivately.\n   Given the relative weight of the interests at stake and\nthe traditionally public nature of initiative and referen\ndum processes, the Court rightly rejects petitioners’ con\nstitutional challenge to the State of Washington’s petition\ndisclosure regulations. These same considerations also\n4                       DOE v. REED\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nmean that any party attempting to challenge particular\napplications of the State’s regulations will bear a heavy\nburden. Even when a referendum involves a particularly\ncontroversial subject and some petition signers fear har\nassment from nonstate actors, a State’s important inter\nests in “protect[ing] the integrity and reliability of the\ninitiative process” remain undiminished, and the State\nretains significant discretion in advancing those interests.\nBuckley, 525 U. S., at 191. Likewise, because the expres\nsive interests implicated by the act of petition signing are\nalways modest, I find it difficult to see how any incre\nmental disincentive to sign a petition would tip the consti\ntutional balance. Case-specific relief may be available\nwhen a State selectively applies a facially neutral petition\ndisclosure rule in a manner that discriminates based on\nthe content of referenda or the viewpoint of petition sign\ners, or in the rare circumstance in which disclosure poses\na reasonable probability of serious and widespread har\nassment that the State is unwilling or unable to control.\nCf. NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S. 449\n(1958). Allowing case-specific invalidation under a more\nforgiving standard would unduly diminish the substantial\nbreathing room States are afforded to adopt and imple\nment reasonable, nondiscriminatory measures like the\ndisclosure requirement now at issue. Accordingly, courts\npresented with an as-applied challenge to a regulation\nauthorizing the disclosure of referendum petitions should\nbe deeply skeptical of any assertion that the Constitution,\nwhich embraces political transparency, compels States to\nconceal the identity of persons who seek to participate in\nlawmaking through a state-created referendum process.\nWith this understanding, I join the opinion of the Court.\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

It is not about a restriction on\nvoting or on speech and does not involve a classic disclo\nsure requirement. Rather, the case concerns a neutral,\nnondiscriminatory policy of disclosing information already\nin the State’s possession that, it has been alleged, might\none day indirectly burden petition signatories. The bur\nden imposed by Washington’s application of the Public\nRecords Act (PRA) to referendum petitions in the vast\nmajority, if not all, its applications is not substantial. And\nthe State has given a more than adequate justification for\nits choice.\n   For a number of reasons, the application of the PRA to\nreferendum petitions does not substantially burden any\nindividual’s expression. First, it is not “a regulation of\npure speech.” McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 514\nU. S. 334, 345 (1995); cf. United States v. O’Brien, 391\nU. S. 367, 377 (1968). It does not prohibit expression, nor\ndoes it require that any person signing a petition disclose\nor say anything at all. See McIntyre, 514 U. S. 334. Nor\ndoes the State’s disclosure alter the content of a speaker’s\nmessage. See id., at 342–343.\n   Second, any effect on speech that disclosure might have\nis minimal. The PRA does not necessarily make it more\n2                             DOE v. REED\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\ndifficult to circulate or obtain signatures on a petition, see\nBuckley v. American Constitutional Law Foundation, Inc.,\n525 U. S. 182, 193–196 (1999); Meyer v. Grant, 486 U. S.\n414, 422–423 (1988), or to communicate one’s views gen\nerally. Regardless of whether someone signs a referendum\npetition, that person remains free to say anything to any\none at any time. If disclosure indirectly burdens a\nspeaker, “the amount of speech covered” is small—only a\nsingle, narrow message conveying one fact in one place,\nWatchtower Bible & Tract Soc. of N. Y., Inc. v. Village of\nStratton, 536 U. S. 150, 165 (2002); cf. Cox v. New Hamp\nshire, 312 U. S. 569 (1941). And while the democratic act\nof casting a ballot or signing a petition does serve an\nexpressive purpose, the act does not involve any “interac\ntive communication,” Meyer, 486 U. S., at 422, and is “not\nprincipally” a method of “individual expression of political\nsentiment,” Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520\nU. S. 351, 373 (1997) (STEVENS, J., dissenting); cf. O’Brien,\n391 U. S., at 377.1\n   Weighed against the possible burden on constitutional\nrights are the State’s justifications for its rule. In this\ncase, the State has posited a perfectly adequate justifica\ntion: an interest in deterring and detecting petition fraud.2\nGiven the pedigree of this interest and of similar regula\ntions, the State need not produce concrete evidence that\nthe PRA is the best way to prevent fraud. See Crawford v.\n——————\n    1 Although a “petition” is a classic means of political expression, the\ntype of petition at issue in this case is not merely a document on which\npeople are expressing their views but rather is a state-created forum with\na particular function: sorting those issues that have enough public\nsupport to warrant limited space on a referendum ballot. Cf. Widmar v.\nVincent, 454 U. S. 263, 278 (1981) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).\n  2 Washington also points out that its disclosure policy informs voters\n\nabout who supports the particular referendum. In certain election-law\ncontexts, this informational rationale (among others) may provide a\nbasis for regulation; in this case, there is no need to look beyond the\nState’s quite obvious antifraud interest.\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

See\nante, at 8–10 (opinion of the Court).\n    There remains the issue of petitioners’ as-applied chal\nlenge. As a matter of law, the Court is correct to keep\nopen the possibility that in particular instances in which a\npolicy such as the PRA burdens expression “by the public\nenmity attending publicity,” Brown v.

The degree to which\nwe defer to a judgment by the political branches must vary up and\ndown with the degree to which that judgment reflects considered,\npublic-minded decisionmaking. Thus, when a law appears to have been\nadopted without reasoned consideration, see, e.g., Salazar v. Buono,\n559 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2010) (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 22–\n23), for discriminatory purposes, see, e.g., Bates v. Little Rock, 361 U.

That one may call into\nquestion the process used to create a law is not a reason to “disregar[d]”\n“sufficiently strong,” “valid[,] neutral justifications” for an otherwise\n“nondiscriminatory” policy. Crawford, 553 U. S., at 204. But it is a\nreason to examine more carefully the justifications for that measure.\n4                            DOE v.

S., at 342.4\n   In my view, this is unlikely to occur in cases involving\nthe PRA. Any burden on speech that petitioners posit is\nspeculative as well as indirect. For an as-applied chal\nlenge to a law such as the PRA to succeed, there would\nhave to be a significant threat of harassment directed at\nthose who sign the petition that cannot be mitigated by\nlaw enforcement measures.5 Moreover, the character of\nthe law challenged in a referendum does not, in itself,\naffect the analysis. Debates about tax policy and regula\ntion of private property can become just as heated as\ndebates about domestic partnerships. And as a general\nmatter, it is very difficult to show that by later disclosing\nthe names of petition signatories, individuals will be less\nwilling to sign petitions. Just as we have in the past, I\nwould demand strong evidence before concluding that an\nindirect and speculative chain of events imposes a sub\n\n\n——————\n   4 JUSTICE SCALIA conceives of the issue as a right to anonymous\n\nspeech. See, e.g., post, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment). But our\ndecision in McIntyre posited no such freewheeling right. The Constitu\ntion protects “freedom of speech.” Amdt. 1; see also McIntyre, 514 U. S.,\nat 336 (“The question presented is whether [a] . . . statute that prohib\nits the distribution of anonymous campaign literature is a ‘law . . .\nabridging the freedom of speech’ within the meaning of the First\nAmendment”). That freedom can be burdened by a law that exposes\nthe speaker to fines, as much as it can be burdened by a law that\nexposes a speaker to harassment, changes the content of his speech, or\nprejudices others against his message. See id., at 342. The right,\nhowever, is the right to speak, not the right to speak without being\nfined or the right to speak anonymously.\n   5 A rare case may also arise in which the level of threat to any indi\n\nvidual is not quite so high but a State’s disclosure would substantially\nlimit a group’s ability to “garner the number of signatures necessary to\nplace [a] matter on the ballot,” thereby “limiting [its] ability to make\nthe matter the focus of statewide discussion.” Meyer v.

I doubt whether signing a petition that has the\neffect of suspending a law fits within “the freedom of\nspeech” at all. But even if, as the Court concludes, ante, at\n5, it does, a long history of practice shows that the First\nAmendment does not prohibit public disclosure.\n                             I\n  We should not repeat and extend the mistake of McIn\ntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 514 U. S. 334 (1995).\nThere, with neither textual support nor precedents requir\ning the result, the Court invalidated a form of election\nregulation that had been widely used by the States since\nthe end of the 19th century. Id., at 371 (SCALIA, J., dis\nsenting). The Court held that an Ohio statute prohibiting\nthe distribution of anonymous campaign literature vio\nlated the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n  Mrs. McIntyre sought a general right to “speak” anony\nmously about a referendum.

REED\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nmously in the referendum itself.1 Referendum petitions\nare subject to public disclosure under the Public Records\nAct (PRA), Wash. Rev. Code §42.56.001 et seq., which\nrequires government agencies to “make available for\npublic inspection and copying all public records,” subject to\ncertain exemptions not relevant here.           §42.56.070(1)\n(2008). Plaintiffs contend that disclosure of the names,\nand other personal information included on the petitions,\nof those who took this legislative action violates their First\nAmendment right to anonymity.\n   Today’s opinion acknowledges such a right, finding that\nit can be denied here only because of the State’s interest in\n“preserving the integrity of the electoral process,” ante, at\n8. In my view this is not a matter for judicial interest\nbalancing. Our Nation’s longstanding traditions of legis\nlating and voting in public refute the claim that the First\nAmendment accords a right to anonymity in the perform\nance of an act with governmental effect. “A governmental\npractice that has become general throughout the United\n——————\n  1 Plaintiffs seem to disavow reliance on McIntyre v. Ohio Elections\n\nComm’n, 514 U. S. 334 (1995), see Reply Brief for Petitioners 12.\nCertainly, there are differences between McIntyre and this case. Mrs.\nMcIntyre was required to disclose her identity herself, by placing her\nname on her handbill. Here, plaintiffs do not object to signing their\nnames to the referendum petition, where it can presumably be observed\nby later signers; they challenge only the later disclosure of that infor\nmation by the State. But both cases are about public disclosure, and\nboth involve a claim to anonymity under the First Amendment. If\nanything, the line plaintiffs seek to draw—which seeks a sort of partial\nanonymity—is stranger still.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS quibbles with the shorthand I use, and tries to rein\nin McIntyre’s holding, by saying that it did not create a “right to speak\nanonymously,” ante, at 4, n. 4 (opinion concurring in part and concur\nring in judgment). But McIntyre used the same shorthand. See 514\nU. S., at 357 (“[t]he right to remain anonymous”); id., at 342 (“[t]he\nfreedom to publish anonymously”); see also ibid. (“an author’s decision\nto remain anonymous . . . is an aspect of the freedom of speech pro\ntected by the First Amendment”).\n                    Cite as: 561 U.

The Wash\nington Constitution vests “[t]he legislative authority” of\nthe State in the legislature, but “the people reserve to\nthemselves the power . . . to approve or reject at the polls\nany act, item, section, or part of any bill, act, or law passed\nby the legislature.” Art. 2, §1. This “referendum” power of\npopular legislation is exercised by submitting a petition, in\naccordance with certain specifications, to the Washington\nsecretary of state with valid signatures of registered vot\ners in number equal to or exceeding four percent of the\nvotes cast in the last gubernatorial election. §1(b); Wash.\nRev. Code §29A.72.100, 130, 140, 150, 160 (2008).\n  The filing of a referendum petition that satisfies these\nrequirements has two legal effects: (1) It requires the\nsecretary to place the measure referred to the people on\nthe ballot at the next general election; and (2) it suspends\noperation of the measure, causing it only to have effect 30\ndays after it is approved during that election. Art. 2,\n§1(d). See Brief for Respondent Sam Reed, Secretary of\nState of Washington 2–6. A voter who signs a referendum\npetition is therefore exercising legislative power because\nhis signature, somewhat like a vote for or against a bill in\nthe legislature, seeks to affect the legal force of the meas\nure at issue.2\n——————\n  2 The Court notes that “only some petition signing has legal effect.”\n\nAnte, at 8, n. 1. That is true. Some petitions may never be submitted\nto the secretary; they are irrelevant here, since they will never be\nsubject to the PRA. But some petitions that are submitted to the\nsecretary may lack the requisite number of signatures. Even as to\n4                             DOE v. REED\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n  Plaintiffs point to no precedent from this Court holding\nthat legislating is protected by the First Amendment.3\nNor do they identify historical evidence demonstrating\nthat “the freedom of speech” the First Amendment codified\nencompassed a right to legislate without public disclosure.\nThis should come as no surprise; the exercise of lawmak\ning power in the United States has traditionally been\npublic.\n  The public nature of federal lawmaking is constitution\nally required. Article I, §5, cl. 3 requires Congress to\nlegislate in public: “Each House shall keep a Journal of its\nProceedings, and from time to time publish the same,\nexcepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require\nSecrecy; and the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either\nHouse on any question shall, at the Desire of one fifth of\nthose Present, be entered on the Journal.”4 State constitu\n——————\nthose, the petition signer has exercised his portion of the legislative\npower when he signs the petition, much like a legislator who casts a\nlosing vote.\n  3 The Court quotes Republican Party of Minn. v. White, 536 U. S. 765,\n\n788 (2002), which stated that a State “having ‘cho[sen] to tap the\nenergy and the legitimizing power of the democratic process, . . . must\naccord the participants in that process the First Amendment rights\nthat attach to their roles.’ ” Ante, at 6. That is correct, but it is not on\npoint. White involved a prohibition on speaking as a condition of\nrunning for judicial office. I do not suggest that a State could require\nlegislators (or the citizen-legislators who participate in a referendum)\nto give up First Amendment rights unconnected with their act of\nlegislating. The electioneering disclosure cases the Court cites, ante, at\n7, are likewise not on point, since they involve disclosure requirements\napplied to political speech, not legislative action.\n  4 The exception for “such Parts as may in their Judgment require\n\nSecrecy” was assuredly not designed to permit anonymous voting. It\nrefers to details whose disclosure would threaten an important national\ninterest. The similar clause in the Articles of Confederation created an\nexception to the journal requirement for parts of the proceedings\n“relating to treaties, alliances or military operations, as in [Congress’s]\njudgment require secresy.” Art. IX. The Constitution’s requirement is\nbroader, but its object is obviously the same.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ntions enacted around the time of the founding had similar\nprovisions. See, e.g., Ky. Const., Art. I, §20 (1792); Ga.\nConst., Art. I, §15 (1798). The desirability of public ac\ncountability was obvious. “[A]s to the votes of representa\ntives and senators in Congress, no man has yet been bold\nenough to vindicate a secret or ballot vote, as either more\nsafe or more wise, more promotive of independence in the\nmembers, or more beneficial to their constituents.” 1 J.\nStory, Commentaries on the Constitution §841, p. 591\n(4th ed. 1873).\n   Moreover, even when the people asked Congress for\nlegislative changes—by exercising their constitutional\nright “to petition the Government for a redress of griev\nances,” U. S. Const., Amdt. 1—they did so publicly. The\npetition was read aloud in Congress. Mazzone, Freedom’s\nAssociations, 77 Wash. L. Rev. 639, 726 (2002). The peti\ntioner’s name (when large groups were not involved), his\nrequest, and what action Congress had taken on the peti\ntion were consistently recorded in the House and Senate\nJournals. See, e.g., Journal of the Senate, June 18, 1790,\n1st Cong., 1st Sess., 163; Journal of the House of Repre\nsentatives, Nov. 24, 1820, 16th Cong., 2d Sess., 32. Even\nwhen the people exercised legislative power directly, they\ndid so not anonymously, but openly in town hall meetings.\nSee generally J. Zimmerman, The New England Town\nMeeting (1999).\n   Petitioning the government and participating in the\ntraditional town meeting were precursors of the modern\ninitiative and referendum. Those innovations were mod\neled after similar devices used by the Swiss democracy in\nthe 1800’s, and were first used in the United States by\nSouth Dakota in 1898. See S. Piott, Giving Voters a Voice\n1–3, 16 (2003). The most influential advocate of the initia\ntive and referendum in the United States analogized the\nSwiss practice to the town meeting, because both “re\nquired open conduct of political affairs and free expression\n6                       DOE v. REED\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nof opinions.” Id., at 5 (discussing J. W. Sullivan, Direct\nLegislation by the Citizenship through the Initiative and\nReferendum (1892)). Plaintiffs’ argument implies that the\npublic nature of these practices, so longstanding and\nunquestioned, violated the freedom of speech. There is no\nhistorical support for such a claim.\n                            B\n  Legislating was not the only governmental act that was\npublic in America. Voting was public until 1888 when the\nStates began to adopt the Australian secret ballot. See\nBurson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 203 (1992) (plurality\nopinion). We have acknowledged the existence of a First\nAmendment interest in voting, see, e.g., Burdick v. Taku\nshi, 504 U. S. 428 (1992), but we have never said that it\nincludes the right to vote anonymously. The history of\nvoting in the United States completely undermines that\nclaim.\n  Initially, the Colonies mostly continued the English\ntraditions of voting by a show of hands or by voice—viva\nvoce voting. Burson, supra, at 200; E. Evans, A History of\nthe Australian Ballot System in the United States 1–6\n(1917) (Evans). One scholar described the viva voce sys\ntem as follows:\n    “ ‘The election judges, who were magistrates, sat upon\n    a bench with their clerks before them. Where practi\n    cable, it was customary for the candidates to be pre\n    sent in person, and to occupy a seat at the side of the\n    judges. As the voter appeared, his name was called\n    out in a loud voice. The judges inquired, “John Jones\n    (or Smith), for whom do you vote?”—for governor, or\n    whatever was the office to be filled. He replied by\n    proclaiming the name of his favorite. Then the clerks\n    enrolled the vote, and the judges announced it as en\n    rolled. The representative of the candidate for whom\n    he voted arose, bowed, and thanked him aloud; and\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n    his partisans often applauded.’ ” Id., at 5 (quoting\n    J. Wise, The End of An Era 55–56 (1899)).\nSee also R. Dinkin, A Study of Elections in the Original\nThirteen States, 1776–1789, p. 101 (1982) (Dinkin).\n  Although there was variation, the election official would\nordinarily compile a poll with the name and residence of\neach voter, and the name of the candidate for whom he\nvoted. See C. Bishop, History of Elections in the American\nColonies 160–64 (1893) (Bishop); P. Argersinger, Struc\nture, Process, and Party: Essays in American Political\nHistory 47 (1992) (Argersinger). To prevent fraud, the\nColonies in Rhode Island, New York, and New Jersey\nadopted the English rule that “copies of the poll must be\ndelivered on demand to persons who were willing to pay a\nreasonable charge for the labor of writing them.” Bishop\n186. Some colonies allowed candidates to demand a copy\nof the poll, ibid., and required the legislature to examine\nthe poll in a contested election, id., at 188–189. Thus, as\nin this case, the government not only publicly collected\nidentifying information about who voted and for which\ncandidate, it also disclosed that information to the public.\n  Any suggestion that viva voce voting infringed the ac\ncepted understanding of the pre-existing freedom of\nspeech to which the First Amendment’s text refers is\nrefuted by the fact that several state constitutions that\nrequired or authorized viva voce voting also explicitly\nguaranteed the freedom of speech. See, e.g., Ky. Const.,\nArt. X, §7, Art. VI, §16 (1799); Ill. Const., Art. VIII, §22,\nArt. I, §28 (1818). Surely one constitutional provision did\nnot render the other invalid.\n  Of course the practice of viva voce voting was gradually\nreplaced with the paper ballot, which was thought to\nreduce fraud and undue influence. See Evans 1–6; Dinkin\n101–106. There is no indication that the shift resulted\nfrom a sudden realization that public voting infringed\n8                       DOE v. REED\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nvoters’ freedom of speech, and the manner in which it\noccurred suggests the contrary. States adopted the paper\nballot at different times, and some States changed meth\nods multiple times. New York’s 1777 Constitution, for\nexample, explicitly provided for the State to switch be\ntween methods. Art. VI. Kentucky’s 1792 Constitution\nrequired paper ballots, Art. III, §2, but its 1799 Constitu\ntion required viva voce voting, Art. VI, §16. The different\nvoting methods simply reflected different views about how\ndemocracy should function. One scholar described Vir\nginia’s and Kentucky’s steadfast use of viva voce voting\nthrough the Civil War as follows: “[I]n the appeal to un\nflinching manliness at the polls these two states insisted\nstill that every voter should show at the hustings the\ncourage of his personal conviction.” Schouler, Evolution of\nthe American Voter, 2 The American Historical Review\n665, 671 (1897). See also id., at 666–667 (“In Virginia and\nthe other states in close affiliation with her this oral ex\npression was vaunted as the privilege of the free-born\nvoter, to show the faith that was in him by an outspoken\nannouncement of his candidate”).\n   The new paper ballots did not make voting anonymous.\nSee Evans 10 (“[T]he ballot was not secret”); Argersinger\n48 (“Certainly there were no legal provisions to ensure\nsecrecy”). Initially, many States did not regulate the form\nof the paper ballot. See Evans 10; Argersinger 48–49.\nTaking advantage of this, political parties began printing\nballots with their candidates’ names on them. They used\nbrightly colored paper and other distinctive markings so\nthat the ballots could be recognized from a distance, mak\ning the votes public. See Burson, supra, at 200–201;\nEvans 10–11. Abuse of these unofficial paper ballots was\nrampant. The polling place had become an “open auction\nplace” where votes could be freely bought or coerced.\nBurson, supra, at 202. Employers threatened employees.\nParty workers kept voters from the other party away from\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe ballot box. Ballot peddlers paid voters and then\nwatched them place the ballot in the box. See L. Fredman,\nThe Australian Ballot: The Story of an American Reform\n22–29 (1968); Argersinger 48–50. Thus, although some\nstate courts said that voting by ballot was meant to be\nmore secret than the public act of viva voce voting; and\nalthough some state constitutional requirements of ballot\nvoting were held to guarantee ballot secrecy, thus prohib\niting the numbering of ballots for voter identification\npurposes, see Williams v. Stein, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ind.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1871); Brisbin\nv.

W. 825 (1879); in general,\nvoting by ballot was by no means secret. Most important\nof all for present purposes, I am aware of no assertion of\nballot secrecy that relied on federal or state constitutional\nguarantees of freedom of speech.\n   It was precisely discontent over the nonsecret nature of\nballot voting, and the abuses that produced, which led to\nthe States’ adoption of the Australian secret ballot. New\nYork and Massachusetts began that movement in 1888,\nand almost 90 percent of the States had followed suit by\n1896. Burson, 504 U. S., at 203–205. But I am aware of\nno contention that the Australian system was required by\nthe First Amendment (or the state counterparts). That\nwould have been utterly implausible, since the inhabitants\nof the Colonies, the States, and the United States had\nfound public voting entirely compatible with “the freedom\nof speech” for several centuries.\n                          *    *     *\n   The long history of public legislating and voting contra\ndicts plaintiffs’ claim that disclosure of petition signatures\nhaving legislative effect violates the First Amendment. As\nI said in McIntyre, “[w]here the meaning of a constitu\ntional text (such as ‘the freedom of speech’) is unclear, the\nwidespread and long-accepted practices of the American\npeople are the best indication of what fundamental beliefs\n10                      DOE v. REED\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nit was intended to enshrine.” 514 U. S., at 378 (dissenting\nopinion). Just as the century-old practice of States’ pro\nhibiting anonymous electioneering was sufficient for me to\nreject the First Amendment claim to anonymity in McIn\ntyre, the many-centuries-old practices of public legislating\nand voting are sufficient for me to reject plaintiffs’ claim.\n   Plaintiffs raise concerns that the disclosure of petition\nsignatures may lead to threats and intimidation. Of\ncourse nothing prevents the people of Washington from\nkeeping petition signatures secret to avoid that—just as\nnothing prevented the States from moving to the secret\nballot. But there is no constitutional basis for this Court\nto impose that course upon the States—or to insist (as\ntoday’s opinion does) that it can only be avoided by the\ndemonstration of a “sufficiently important governmental\ninterest,” ante, at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAnd it may even be a bad idea to keep petition signatures\nsecret. There are laws against threats and intimidation;\nand harsh criticism, short of unlawful action, is a price our\npeople have traditionally been willing to pay for self\ngovernance. Requiring people to stand up in public for\ntheir political acts fosters civic courage, without which\ndemocracy is doomed. For my part, I do not look forward\nto a society which, thanks to the Supreme Court, cam\npaigns anonymously (McIntyre) and even exercises the\ndirect democracy of initiative and referendum hidden from\npublic scrutiny and protected from the accountability of\ncriticism. This does not resemble the Home of the Brave.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

In my view, com\npelled disclosure of signed referendum and initiative\npetitions1 under the Washington Public Records Act\n(PRA), Wash. Rev. Code §42.56.001, et seq. (2008), severely\nburdens those rights and chills citizen participation in the\nreferendum process. Given those burdens, I would hold\nthat Washington’s decision to subject all referendum\npetitions to public disclosure is unconstitutional because\nthere will always be a less restrictive means by which\nWashington can vindicate its stated interest in preserving\nthe integrity of its referendum process. I respectfully\ndissent.\n\n\n——————\n  1 Generally speaking, in a referendum, voters approve or reject an Act\n\nalready passed by the legislature. In an initiative, voters adopt or\nreject an entirely new law, either a statute or a constitutional amend\nment. See T. Cronin, Direct Democracy: The Politics of Initiative,\nReferendum, and Recall 2 (1989).\n2                       DOE v. REED\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n                              I\n   This case concerns the interaction of two distinct sets of\nWashington statutes. The first set, codified in Washing\nton’s Election Code, regulates the referendum and initia\ntive process. These statutes require, among other things,\nthat referendum signers write their names and addresses\non petition sheets, and mandate that this information\nbe disclosed to Washington’s secretary of state for canvass\ning and verification. See, e.g., §§29A.72.130, 29A.72.230\n(2008). Petitioners do not contend that these require\nments violate their First Amendment rights; that is, they\ndo not argue that the Constitution allows them to support\na referendum measure without disclosing their names to\nthe State.\n   The second set of statutes—the PRA—is not a referen\ndum or election regulation. Rather, the PRA requires\ndisclosure of all nonexempt “public records” upon request\nby any person. See §§42.56.010(2), 42.56.070. Washing\nton has concluded that signed referendum petitions are\n“public records” subject to disclosure under the PRA, and\nhas “routinely disclosed petitions in response to public\nrecords requests.” Brief for Respondent Reed 5–6.\n   Petitioners do not challenge the constitutionality of the\nPRA generally. They contend only that Washington vio\nlates their First Amendment rights by construing the PRA\nto apply to signed referendum petitions. See Brief for\nPetitioners 35–39. As the Court notes, the parties dispute\nwhether this challenge is best conceived as a facial chal\nlenge or an as-applied challenge. See ante, at 5. In my\nview, the Court correctly concludes that petitioners must\n“satisfy our standards for a facial challenge” because their\nclaim, and the relief that they seek, “reach beyond” their\n“particular circumstances.” Ibid.\n   We typically disfavor facial challenges. See Washington\nState Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552\nU. S. 442, 449 (2008). They “often rest on speculation,”\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncan lead courts unnecessarily to anticipate constitutional\nquestions or formulate broad constitutional rules, and may\nprevent governmental officers from implementing laws “in\na manner consistent with the Constitution.” Id., at 450–\n451. For those reasons, we rejected in Washington State\nGrange political parties’ pre-enforcement facial challenge\nto a Washington initiative that allowed candidates in a\nprimary election to self-designate their political party\npreference on the primary election ballot. See id., at 458–\n459. Because the challenge was a pre-enforcement one,\nWashington “had no opportunity to implement” the initia\ntive, id., at 450, so the political parties’ arguments that it\nviolated their association rights all depended “on the\npossibility that voters will be confused as to the meaning\nof the party-preference designation,” id., at 454. More\nover, a facial challenge was inappropriate because the\nregulation did “not on its face impose a severe burden on\npolitical parties’ associational rights.” Id., at 444.\n   Those considerations point in the opposite direction\nhere. Washington’s construction of the PRA “on its face\nimpose[s] a severe burden,” ibid.—compelled disclosure of\nprivacy in political association protected by the First\nAmendment, see infra, at 4–5—on all referendum signers.\nAnd Washington has had several “opportunit[ies] to im\nplement” the PRA’s disclosure requirements with respect\nto initiative petitions. Washington State Grange, supra, at\n450. Indeed, Washington admits that “[a]ll petitions for\ninitiatives, referendum, recall, and candidate nomination\nare public records subject to disclosure.” Brief for Respon\ndent Reed 59; see also App. 26 (listing six completed re\nquests for disclosure of signed initiative petitions since\n2006). Washington thus has eliminated any “possibility”\nthat referendum petition signers “will be confused as to”\nhow the State will respond to a request under the PRA to\ndisclose their names and addresses.

For purposes of this case, I will assume that to\nprevail, petitioners must satisfy our most rigorous stan\ndard, and show that there is “ ‘no set of circumstances . . .\nunder which the’ ” PRA could be constitutionally applied to\na referendum or initiative petition, “i.e., that the [PRA] is\nunconstitutional in all of its applications,” id., at 449\n(quoting United States v.

Ante, at 5. The Court also rightly rejects the base\nless argument that such expressive activity falls “outside\nthe scope of the First Amendment” merely because “it has\nlegal effect in the electoral process.” Ante, at 6. Yet, the\nCourt does not acknowledge the full constitutional impli\ncations of these conclusions.\n   The expressive political activity of signing a referendum\npetition is a paradigmatic example of “the practice of\npersons sharing common views banding together to\nachieve a common end.” Citizens Against Rent Con\ntrol/Coalition for Fair Housing v. Berkeley, 454 U. S. 290,\n294 (1981). A referendum supported by only one person’s\nsignature is a nullity; it will never be placed on the ballot.\nThe Doe petitioners recognized as much when they—and\nmore than 120,000 other Washingtonians, see ante, at 3—\njoined with petitioner Protect Marriage Washington, “a\nstate political action committee” organized under\n§42.17.040, to effect Protect Marriage Washington’s “major\npurpose” of collecting enough valid signatures to place\nReferendum 71 on the general election ballot.

S. 1, 15\n(1976) (per curiam)).\n   This Court has long recognized the “vital relationship\nbetween” political association “and privacy in one’s asso\nciations,” NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S.\n449, 462 (1958), and held that “[t]he Constitution protects\nagainst the compelled disclosure of political associations\nand beliefs,” Brown v. Socialist Workers ’74 Campaign\nComm. (Ohio), 459 U. S. 87, 91 (1982). This constitutional\nprotection “yield[s] only to a subordinating interest of the\nState that is compelling, and then only if there is a sub\nstantial relation between the information sought and an\noverriding and compelling state interest.” Id., at 91–92\n(internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omit\nted). Thus, unlike the Court, I read our precedents to\nrequire application of strict scrutiny to laws that compel\ndisclosure of protected First Amendment association.\nBuckley v. American Constitutional Law Foundation, Inc.,\n525 U. S. 182, 206, 212 (1999) (ACLF) (THOMAS, J., con\ncurring in judgment). Under that standard, a disclosure\nrequirement passes constitutional muster only if it is\nnarrowly tailored—i.e., the least restrictive means—to\nserve a compelling state interest. See id., at 206.\n                              B\n  Washington’s application of the PRA to a referendum\npetition does not survive strict scrutiny.\n                              1\n  Washington first contends that it has a compelling\ninterest in “transparency and accountability,” which it\nclaims encompasses several subordinate interests: pre\nserving the integrity of its election process, preventing\ncorruption, deterring fraud, and correcting mistakes by\nthe secretary of state or by petition signers. See Brief for\n6                        DOE v. REED\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nRespondent Reed 40–42; 57–59.\n    It is true that a State has a substantial interest in regu\nlating its referendum and initiative processes “to protect\nthe[ir] integrity and reliability.” ACLF, 525 U. S., at 191.\nBut Washington points to no precedent from this Court\nrecognizing “correcting errors” as a distinct compelling\ninterest that could support disclosure regulations. And\nour cases strongly suggest that preventing corruption and\ndeterring fraud bear less weight in this particular elec\ntoral context: the signature-gathering stage of a referen\ndum or initiative drive. The Court has twice observed that\n“ ‘the risk of fraud or corruption, or the appearance\nthereof, is more remote at the petition stage of an initia\ntive than at the time of balloting.’ ” Id., at 203 (quoting\nMeyer v. Grant, 486 U. S. 414, 427 (1988)). Similarly,\nbecause “[r]eferenda are held on issues, not candidates for\npublic office,” the “risk of corruption perceived in cases\ninvolving candidate elections simply is not present in a\npopular vote on a public issue.” First Nat. Bank of Boston\nv. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 790 (1978) (citations omitted).\n    We should not abandon those principles merely because\nWashington and its amici can point to a mere eight in\nstances of initiative-related fraud, see Brief for Respon\ndent Reed 42; Brief for State of Ohio et al. as Amici Curiae\n22–24, among the 809 initiative measures placed on\nstate ballots in this country between 1988 and 2008,\nsee Initiative and Referendum Institute, Initiative Use\n2 (Feb. 2009), online at http://www.iandrinstitute.org/\nIRI%20Initiative%20Use%20(1904-2008).pdf (as visited\nJune 21, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).\nIf anything, these meager figures reinforce the conclusion\nthat the risks of fraud or corruption in the initiative and\nreferendum process are remote and thereby undermine\nWashington’s claim that those two interests should be\nconsidered compelling for purposes of strict scrutiny.\n    Thus, I am not persuaded that Washington’s interest in\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

But I need not answer that question here. Even\nassuming the interest is compelling, on-demand disclosure\nof a referendum petition to any person under the PRA is “a\nblunderbuss approach” to furthering that interest, Colo\nrado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal\nElection Comm’n, 518 U. S. 604, 642 (1996) (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring in judgment and dissenting in part) (internal\nquotation marks omitted), not the least restrictive means\nof doing so. The events that prompted petitioners’ com\nplaint in this case demonstrate as much.\n   As Washington explained during oral argument, after\nthe secretary of state receives signed referendum peti\ntions, his “first step . . . is to take them to his archiving\nsection and to have them digitized. As soon as they’re\ndigitized, they’re available on disks for anyone who re\nquests them” under the PRA. Tr. of Oral Arg. 30. In this\ncase, two organizations announced their intention to\nobtain the digitized names and addresses of referendum\nsigners and post them “online, in a searchable format.”\nAnte, at 3.\n   There is no apparent reason why Washington must\nbroadly disclose referendum signers’ names and addresses\nin this manner to vindicate the interest that it invokes\nhere. Washington—which is in possession of that infor\nmation because of referendum regulations that petitioners\ndo not challenge, see supra, at 2—could put the names and\naddresses of referendum signers into a similar electronic\ndatabase that state employees could search without sub\njecting the name and address of each signer to wholesale\npublic disclosure. The secretary could electronically cross\nreference the referendum database against the “statewide\nvoter registration list” contained in Washington’s “state\n8                            DOE v.

Doing so presumably would drastically\nreduce or eliminate possible errors or mistakes that Wash\nington argues the secretary might make, see Brief for\nRespondent Reed 42, since it would allow the secretary to\nverify virtually all of the signatures instead of the mere “3\nto 5%” he “ordinarily checks,” ante, at 9 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted).3\n   An electronic referendum database would also enable\nthe secretary to determine whether multiple entries corre\nspond to a single registered voter, thereby detecting\nwhether a voter had signed the petition more than once.\nIn addition, the database would protect victims of “for\ngery” or “ ‘bait and switch’ fraud.” Ibid. In Washington, “a\nunique identifier is assigned to each legally registered\nvoter in the state.” §29A.08.651(4). Washington could\ncreate a Web site, linked to the electronic referendum\ndatabase, where a voter concerned that his name had been\nfraudulently signed could conduct a search using his\nunique identifier to ensure that his name was absent from\nthe database—without requiring disclosure of the names\nand addresses of all the voluntary, legitimate signers.\n   Washington admits that creating this sort of electronic\nreferendum database “could be done.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 51.\nImplementing such a system would not place a heavy\nburden on Washington; “the Secretary of State’s staff”\n——————\n    2 UnderWashington law, this “computerized list must serve as the\nsingle system for storing and maintaining the official list of registered\nvoters throughout the state” and “must contain the name and registra\ntion information of every legally registered voter in the state.” Wash.\nRev. Code §§29A.08.651(2)–(3) (2008).\n   3 See §29A.72.230 (permitting the secretary of state to verify and\n\ncanvass referendum petitions using approved statistical sampling\nmethods).\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   But Washington’s Election Code already gives Washing\nton voters access to referendum petition data. Under\n§29A.72.230, “[t]he verification and canvass of signatures\non the [referendum] petition may be observed by persons\nrepresenting the advocates and opponents of the proposed\nmeasure so long as they make no record of the names,\naddresses, or other information on the petitions or related\nrecords except upon” court order. Each side is entitled to\nat least two such observers, although the secretary may\nincrease that number if, in his opinion, doing so would not\n“cause undue delay or disruption of the verification proc\ness.” Ibid.\n   Washington does not explain why this existing access,\nwhich petitioners do not challenge here, is insufficient to\npermit its citizens to oversee the verification process un\nder §29A.72.230, or to decide intelligently whether to\npursue a court challenge under §29A.72.240. Moreover, if\nWashington had implemented the more narrowly tailored\nelectronic referendum database discussed above, observers\ncould see the secretary of state’s employees examine the\ndata using exactly the same techniques they would use if\nthe data were released to them under the PRA. Obtaining\na digitized list to navigate on their own computer would\nnot allow an observer to learn any additional information.\n   Washington law also contains several other measures\nthat preserve the integrity of the referendum process.\n10                      DOE v. REED\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nFirst, it is a crime in Washington to forge a signature on a\nreferendum petition, or to knowingly sign one more than\nonce. See §29A.84.230. Second, referendum supporters\nmust gather a large number of valid signatures—four\npercent of the votes cast for Governor in the immediately\npreceding gubernatorial election—to place a referendum\npetition on the ballot. §29A.72.150. Third, Washington’s\nrequired referendum petition form limits each petition to a\nsingle subject. See §29A.72.130. Fourth, a large, plain-\nEnglish warning must appear at the top of the referendum\npetition, alerting signers to the law’s requirements. See\n§29A.72.140. Fifth, Washington prescribes the text of the\ndeclaration that a circulator must submit along with the\nsigned petition sheets. See §29A.72.130. Sixth, Washing\nton prescribes verification and canvassing methods. See\n§29A.72.230.\n  The Court’s dismissive treatment of those provisions,\nsee ante, at 9, is perplexing, given the analysis that the\nCourt endorsed in ACLF. There, the Court held that two\ndisclosure requirements governing Colorado’s initiative\nprocess were unconstitutional, see 525 U. S., at 186–187,\nspecifically finding that they were “not warranted by the\nstate interests (administrative efficiency, fraud detection,\ninforming voters) alleged to justify” them, and emphasiz\ning that its “judgment [wa]s informed by other means\nColorado employs to accomplish its regulatory purposes.”\nId., at 192. The entire last section of the Court’s opinion\ndetailed those “less problematic measures” by which Colo\nrado “can and d[id] meet” its “substantial interests in\nregulating the ballot-initiative process.” Id., at 204 (em\nphasis added). With one exception—a law deeming an\ninitiative void if the circulator violated any law applicable\nto the circulation process—those Colorado laws correspond\nexactly to the Washington regulatory requirements listed\nabove. See id., at 205. Including the observer provision,\n§29A.72.230, and the provision permitting court review of\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Accordingly, this interest\ncannot justify applying the PRA to a referendum petition.\n                             2\n  Washington also contends that it has a compelling\ninterest in “providing relevant information to Washington\nvoters,” and that on-demand disclosure to the public is a\nnarrowly tailored means of furthering that interest. Brief\nfor Respondent Reed 44. This argument is easily dis\npatched, since this Court has already rejected it in a simi\nlar context.\n  In McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 514 U. S. 334\n(1995), the Court held that an Ohio law prohibiting\nanonymous political pamphleting violated the First\nAmendment. One of the interests Ohio had invoked to\njustify that law was identical to Washington’s here: the\n“interest in providing the electorate with relevant infor\nmation.” Id., at 348. The Court called that interest\n“plainly insufficient to support the constitutionality of\n[Ohio’s] disclosure requirement.” Id., at 349. “The simple\ninterest in providing voters with additional relevant in\nformation does not justify a state requirement that a\nwriter make statements or disclosures she would other\nwise omit.” Id., at 348. “Don’t underestimate the common\nman,” we advised. Id., at 348, n. 11 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n12                      DOE v. REED\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n     “People are intelligent enough to evaluate the source\n     of an anonymous writing. They can see it is anony\n     mous. They know it is anonymous. They can evalu\n     ate its anonymity along with its message. . . . And\n     then, once they have done so, it is for them to decide\n     what is ‘responsible,’ what is valuable, and what is\n     truth.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nSee also Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 777 (“The inherent worth of\nthe speech in terms of its capacity for informing the public\ndoes not depend upon the identity of its source”).\n   This observation applies equally to referendum meas\nures. People are intelligent enough to evaluate the merits\nof a referendum without knowing who supported it. Thus,\njust as this informational interest did not justify the Ohio\nlaw in McIntyre, it does not justify applying the PRA to\nreferendum petitions.\n                              C\n  The foregoing analysis applies in every case involving\ndisclosure of a referendum measure’s supporters, as it\nmust for petitioners’ facial challenge to succeed. See\nWashington State Grange, 552 U. S., at 449 (quoting\nSalerno, 481 U. S., at 745). Washington does not argue\nthat the strength of its transparency and accountability\ninterest rises or falls based on the topic of a referendum.\nNor would such an argument be convincing. We have no\nbasis to assume that Washington’s interest in maintaining\nthe integrity of its referendum process is high for a char\nter-school referendum but low for an unemployment in\nsurance referendum, or that a library or land-use referen\ndum is more likely to be a target of fraud or corruption\nthan a referendum on insurance coverage and benefits.\nSee ante, at 11–12. The strength of Washington’s interest\nremains constant across all types of referendum measures.\n  So too does the strength of a signer’s First Amendment\ninterest. The First Amendment rights at issue here are\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nassociational rights, and a long, unbroken line of this\nCourt’s precedents holds that privacy of association is\nprotected under the First Amendment. See supra, at 4–5.\nThe loss of associational privacy that comes with disclos\ning referendum petitions to the general public under the\nPRA constitutes the same harm as to each signer of each\nreferendum, regardless of the topic. To be sure, a referen\ndum signer may be more willing to disclose to the general\npublic his political association with persons signing cer\ntain referendum measures than his association with oth\ners. But that choice belongs to the voter; the State may\nnot make it for him by ascribing a lower level of First\nAmendment protection to an associational interest that\nsome think a voter may be (or should be) more willing to\ndisclose. Cf. Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of\nVa., 515 U. S. 819, 828 (1995) (“In the realm of private\nspeech or expression, government regulation may not\nfavor one speaker over another”).\n  Finally, the less restrictive means available to vindicate\nWashington’s transparency and accountability interest\ncan be employed for all referendum measures, regardless\nof topic. There is nothing measure-specific about an elec\ntronic database or additional observers. And the forgery\nprohibition and other existing requirements in Washing\nton law that help “protect the integrity of the initiative\nprocess,” ACLF, 525 U. S., at 204, apply equally to all\nreferendum measures.\n  Because the strength of Washington’s interest in trans\nparency and a signer’s individual First Amendment inter\nest in privacy of political association remain constant\nacross all referendum topics, and because less restrictive\nmeans to protect the integrity of the referendum process\nare not topic specific, I would hold that on-demand public\ndisclosure of referendum petitions under the PRA is not\nnarrowly tailored for any referendum.\n14                       DOE v. REED\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n                             III\n  Significant practical problems will result from requiring\nas-applied challenges to protect referendum signers’ con\nstitutional rights.\n                              A\n   The Court’s approach will “require substantial litigation\nover an extended time” before a potential signer of any\nreferendum will learn whether, if he signs a referendum,\nhis associational privacy right will remain intact. Citizens\nUnited v. Federal Election Comm’n, 558 U. S. ___, ___\n(2010) (slip op., at 9). And the tenacious litigant’s reward\nfor trying to protect his First Amendment rights? An\n“interpretive process [that] itself would create an inevita\nble, pervasive, and serious risk of chilling protected speech\npending the drawing of fine distinctions that, in the end,\nwould themselves be questionable.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n9–10). The large number of such fine and questionable\ndistinctions in these types of cases reinforces my view that\nas-applied challenges provide no more than “a hollow\nassurance” that referendum signers’ First Amendment\nrights will be protected. Id., at __ (slip op., at 5) (THOMAS,\nJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Consider\njust a few examples.\n   In Washington, a referendum sponsor must file the\nproposed referendum with the secretary of state before\ncollecting signatures. See §29A.72.010. May the sponsor\nseek an injunction against disclosure through an as\napplied challenge before filing the proposed measure, or\nsimultaneously with its filing?          Because signature\ngathering will not have started, the sponsor will not be\nable to present any evidence specific to signers or potential\nsigners of that particular referendum showing “a reason\nable probability that the compelled disclosure [of personal\ninformation] will subject them to threats, harassment, or\nreprisals from either Government officials or private\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

The Court has never held that\nsuch evidence would be acceptable; but if it is, that neces\nsarily means that some signers, at some point, will have\nsuffered actual “threats, harassment, and reprisals” for\nengaging in protected First Amendment activity.\n   If the sponsor must wait at least until signature\ngathering has started on his referendum to file an as\napplied challenge, it is still unclear what sort of evidence\nof “threats, harassment, or reprisals” directed toward his\nsupporters would satisfy the Court’s standard. How many\ninstances of “threats, harassment or reprisals” must a\nsigner endure before a court may grant relief on an as\napplied challenge? And how dispersed throughout the\ngroup of the necessary 120,000 signers, see ante, at 3,\nmust these threats be?\n   More importantly, the Court’s standard does not appear\nto require actual “threats, harassment, or reprisals,” but\nmerely a “ ‘reasonable probability’ ” that disclosure of the\nsigners’ names and addresses will lead to such activity.\nAnte, at 11 (emphasis added). What sort of evidence suf\nfices to satisfy this apparently more relaxed, though per\nhaps more elusive, standard? Does one instance of actual\nharassment directed toward one signer mean that the\n“reasonable probability” requirement is met? And again,\nhow widespread must this “reasonable probability” be?\nThe Court does not answer any of these questions, leaving\na vacuum to be filled on a case-by-case basis. This will, no\ndoubt, result in the “drawing of” arbitrary and “question\nable” “fine distinctions” by even the most well-intentioned\ndistrict or circuit judge. Citizens United, 558 U.

Consider, for example, the goal of\nincreasing ethics in government—a seemingly laudable\nand unobjectionable goal. So thought some citizens of\nUtah, who, frustrated with the state legislature’s failure to\npass ethics laws commensurate with their preferences,\nfiled a “21-page initiative target[ing] legislative conduct\nwith a broad array of reforms that would significantly\nchange how business gets done on Utah’s Capitol Hill.”\nMcKitrick, Suit Demands Secrecy for Ethics Petition\nSigners, Salt Lake Tribune, Apr. 15, 2010, p. A4 (hereinaf\nter Salt Lake Tribune). But Utah law provides that\n“[i]nitiative packets,” which contain the names and ad\ndresses (and, in some cases, birthdates) of petition signers,\n“are public once they are delivered to the county clerks”\nfor verification and canvassing. Utah Code Ann. §20A–7–\n206(7) (2009 Lexis Supp. Pamphlet).\n   The attorneys sponsoring that initiative moved for an\ninjunction to prevent disclosure of the initiative packets\nunder §20A–7–206(7) because, they claimed, “ ‘[t]he [state]\nRepublican Party has said it will target our folks.’ ” Salt\nLake Tribune, at A4. According to these attorneys, a\nfacially benign initiative may well result in political retri\nbution and retaliation in a State where Republicans cur\nrently hold the offices of Governor, Lieutenant Governor,\nattorney general, state treasurer, state auditor, and a\nsupermajority in both the Utah House of Representatives\n(71%) and the Utah Senate (72%), see State Yellow Book:\nWho’s Who in the Executive and Legislative Branches of\nthe 50 State Governments 650–651, 1292–1294 (Spring\n2010), as well as four of the five seats in the State’s dele\ngation to the United States Congress, see GPO, 2009–2010\nOfficial Congressional Directory, 111th Cong., pp. 299, 307\n(2009).\n   The difficulty in predicting which referendum measures\n18                            DOE v.

Rev. Code §29A.72.230, are not\nat issue. And, petitioners do not contend that Washing\nton’s citizens may never obtain access to referendum data.\nThus, Washington’s rules allowing access to at least two\nrepresentative observers from each side, see ibid., and\nauthorizing courts to review the secretary of state’s verifi\ncation and canvassing decision if those observers are\ndissatisfied with the secretary’s decision, see §29A.72.240,\nare also not in question.\n   The Court is asked to assess the constitutionality of the\nPRA only with regard to referendum petitions.

Argued April 28, 2010—Decided June 24, 2010\nThe Washington Constitution allows citizens to challenge state laws by\n  referendum. To initiate a referendum, proponents must file a peti\n  tion with the secretary of state that contains valid signatures of reg\n  istered Washington voters equal to or exceeding four percent of the\n  votes cast for the office of Governor at the last gubernatorial election.\n  A valid submission requires not only a signature, but also the signer’s\n  address and the county in which he is registered to vote.\n     In May 2009, Washington Governor Christine Gregoire signed into\n  law Senate Bill 5688, which expanded the rights and responsibilities\n  of state-registered domestic partners, including same-sex domestic\n  partners. That same month, Protect Marriage Washington, one of\n  the petitioners here, was organized as a “State Political Committee”\n  for the purpose of collecting the petition signatures necessary to place\n  a referendum challenging SB 5688 on the ballot. If the referendum\n  made it onto the ballot, Protect Marriage Washington planned to en\n  courage voters to reject SB 5688. Protect Marriage Washington sub\n  mitted the petition with more than 137,000 signatures to the secre\n  tary of state, and after conducting the verification and canvassing\n  process required by state law, the secretary determined that the peti\n  tion contained sufficient signatures to qualify the referendum (R–71)\n  for the ballot. Respondent intervenors invoked the Washington Pub\n  lic Records Act (PRA) to obtain copies of the petition, which contained\n  the signers’ names and addresses.\n     The R–71 petition sponsor and certain signers filed a complaint\n  and a motion for injunctive relief in Federal District Court, seeking to\n  enjoin the public release of the petition. Count I alleges that the PRA\n  “is unconstitutional as applied to referendum petitions,” and Count II\n2                              DOE v. REED\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    alleges that the PRA “is unconstitutional as applied to the Referen\n    dum 71 petition because there is a reasonable probability that the\n    signatories . . . will be subjected to threats, harassment, and repri\n    sals.” Determining that the PRA burdened core political speech, the\n    District Court held that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits\n    of Count I and granted a preliminary injunction preventing release of\n    the signatory information. Reviewing only Count I, the Ninth Circuit\n    held that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their claim that the\n    PRA is unconstitutional as applied to referendum petitions in gen\n    eral, and therefore reversed.\nHeld: Disclosure of referendum petitions does not as a general matter\n violate the First Amendment. Pp. 4–13.\n    (a) Because plaintiffs’ Count I claim and the relief that would fol\n low—an injunction barring the secretary of state from releasing ref\n erendum petitions to the public—reach beyond the particular circum\n stances of these plaintiffs, they must satisfy this Court’s standards\n for a facial challenge to the extent of that reach. See United States v.\n Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 4–5.\n    (b) The compelled disclosure of signatory information on referen\n dum petitions is subject to review under the First Amendment. In\n most cases, the individual’s signature will express the view that the\n law subject to the petition should be overturned. Even if the signer is\n agnostic as to the merits of the underlying law, his signature still ex\n presses the political view that the question should be considered “by\n the whole electorate.” Meyer v. Grant, 486 U. S. 414, 421. In either\n case, the expression of a political view implicates a First Amendment\n right.\n    Petition signing remains expressive even when it has legal effect in\n the electoral process. But that does not mean that the electoral con\n text is irrelevant to the nature of this Court’s First Amendment re\n view. States have significant flexibility in implementing their own\n voting systems. To the extent a regulation concerns the legal effect of\n a particular activity in that process, the government is afforded sub\n stantial latitude to enforce that regulation. Also pertinent is the fact\n that the PRA is not a prohibition on speech, but a disclosure re\n quirement that may burden “the ability to speak, but [does] ‘not pre\n vent anyone from speaking.’ ” Citizens United v. Federal Election\n Comm’n, 558 U. S. ___, ___. This Court has reviewed First Amend\n ment challenges to disclosure requirements in the electoral context\n under an “exacting scrutiny” standard, requiring “a ‘substantial rela\n tion’ between the disclosure requirement and a ‘sufficiently impor\n tant’ governmental interest.” Id., at ___. To withstand this scrutiny,\n “the strength of the governmental interest must reflect the serious\n ness of the actual burden on First Amendment rights.” Davis v. Fed\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\neral Election Comm’n, 554 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 5–7.\n   (c) The State’s interest in preserving the integrity of the electoral\nprocess suffices to defeat the argument that the PRA is unconstitu\ntional with respect to referendum petitions in general. That interest\nis particularly strong with respect to efforts to root out fraud. But\nthe State’s interest is not limited to combating fraud; it extends to ef\nforts to ferret out invalid signatures caused not by fraud but by sim\nple mistake, such as duplicate signatures or signatures of individuals\nwho are not registered to vote in the State. The State’s interest also\nextends more generally to promoting transparency and accountability\nin the electoral process.\n   Plaintiffs contend that disclosure is not sufficiently related to the\ninterest of protecting the integrity of the electoral process to with\nstand First Amendment scrutiny. They argue that disclosure is not\nnecessary because the secretary of state is already charged with veri\nfying and canvassing the names on a petition, a measure’s advocates\nand opponents can observe that process, any citizen can challenge the\nsecretary’s actions in court, and criminal penalties reduce the danger\nof fraud in the petition process. But the secretary’s verification and\ncanvassing will not catch all the invalid signatures, and public disclo\nsure can help cure the inadequacies of the secretary’s process. Dis\nclosure also helps prevent difficult-to-detect fraud such as outright\nforgery and “bait and switch” fraud, in which an individual signs the\npetition based on a misrepresentation of the underlying issue. And\ndisclosure promotes transparency and accountability in the electoral\nprocess to an extent other measures cannot. Pp. 8–10.\n   (d) Plaintiffs’ main objection is that “the strength of the govern\nmental interest” does not “reflect the seriousness of the actual burden\non First Amendment rights.” Davis, supra, at ___. According to\nplaintiffs, the objective of those seeking disclosure is not to prevent\nfraud, but to publicly identify signatories and broadcast their politi\ncal views on the subject of the petition. Plaintiffs allege, for example,\nthat several groups plan to post the petitions in searchable form on\nthe Internet, and then encourage other citizens to seek out R–71 peti\ntion signers. That, plaintiffs argue, would subject them to threats,\nharassment, and reprisals.\n   The problem for plaintiffs is that their argument rests almost en\ntirely on the specific harm that would attend the disclosure of infor\nmation on the R–71 petition. But the question before the Court at\nthis stage of the litigation is whether disclosure of referendum peti\ntions in general violates the First Amendment. Faced with the\nState’s unrebutted arguments that only modest burdens attend the\ndisclosure of a typical petition, plaintiffs’ broad challenge to the PRA\nmust be rejected. But upholding the PRA against a broad-based chal\n4                             DOE v.

SAM REED, \n\n    WASHINGTON SECRETARY OF STATE, ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 24, 2010] \n\n\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n  The State of Washington allows its citizens to challenge\nstate laws by referendum. Roughly four percent of Wash\nington voters must sign a petition to place such a referen\ndum on the ballot. That petition, which by law must\ninclude the names and addresses of the signers, is then\nsubmitted to the government for verification and canvass\ning, to ensure that only lawful signatures are counted.\nThe Washington Public Records Act (PRA) authorizes\nprivate parties to obtain copies of government documents,\nand the State construes the PRA to cover submitted refer\nendum petitions.\n  This case arises out of a state law extending certain\nbenefits to same-sex couples, and a corresponding referen\ndum petition to put that law to a popular vote. Respon\ndent intervenors invoked the PRA to obtain copies of the\npetition, with the names and addresses of the signers.\nCertain petition signers and the petition sponsor objected,\narguing that such public disclosure would violate their\nrights under the First Amendment.\n2                        DOE v. REED\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  The course of this litigation, however, has framed the\nlegal question before us more broadly. The issue at this\nstage of the case is not whether disclosure of this particu\nlar petition would violate the First Amendment, but\nwhether disclosure of referendum petitions in general\nwould do so. We conclude that such disclosure does not as\na general matter violate the First Amendment, and we\ntherefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. We\nleave it to the lower courts to consider in the first instance\nthe signers’ more focused claim concerning disclosure of\nthe information on this particular petition, which is pend\ning before the District Court.\n                                I\n  The Washington Constitution reserves to the people the\npower to reject any bill, with a few limited exceptions not\nrelevant here, through the referendum process. Wash.\nConst., Art. II, §1(b). To initiate a referendum, proponents\nmust file a petition with the secretary of state that con\ntains valid signatures of registered Washington voters\nequal to or exceeding four percent of the votes cast for the\noffice of Governor at the last gubernatorial election.\n§§1(b), (d). A valid submission requires not only a signa\nture, but also the signer’s address and the county in which\nhe is registered to vote. Wash. Rev. Code §29A.72.130\n(2008).\n  In May 2009, Washington Governor Christine Gregoire\nsigned into law Senate Bill 5688, which “expand[ed] the\nrights and responsibilities” of state-registered domestic\npartners, including same-sex domestic partners. 586 F. 3d\n671, 675 (CA9 2009). That same month, Protect Marriage\nWashington, one of the petitioners here, was organized as\na “State Political Committee” for the purpose of collecting\nthe petition signatures necessary to place a referendum on\nthe ballot, which would give the voters themselves an\nopportunity to vote on SB 5688.

Id., at 7, 9.\n  On July 25, 2009, Protect Marriage Washington submit\nted to the secretary of state a petition containing over\n137,000 signatures. See 586 F. 3d, at 675; Brief for Re\nspondent Washington Families Standing Together 6. The\nsecretary of state then began the verification and canvass\ning process, as required by Washington law, to ensure that\nonly legal signatures were counted. Wash. Rev. Code\n§29A.72.230. Some 120,000 valid signatures were re\nquired to place the referendum on the ballot. Sam Reed,\nWashington Secretary of State, Certification of Referen\ndum 71 (Sept. 2, 2009). The secretary of state determined\nthat the petition contained a sufficient number of valid\nsignatures, and the referendum (R–71) appeared on the\nNovember 2009 ballot. The voters approved SB 5688 by a\nmargin of 53% to 47%.\n  The PRA, Wash. Rev. Code §42.56.001 et seq., makes all\n“public records” available for public inspection and copy\ning. §42.56.070(1) (2008). The Act defines “[p]ublic re\ncord” as “any writing containing information relating to\nthe conduct of government or the performance of any\ngovernmental or proprietary function prepared, owned,\nused, or retained by any state or local agency.”\n§42.56.010(2). Washington takes the position that refer\nendum petitions are “public records.” Brief for Respon\ndent Reed 5.\n  By August 20, 2009, the secretary had received requests\nfor copies of the R–71 petition from an individual and four\nentities, including Washington Coalition for Open Gov\nernment (WCOG) and Washington Families Standing\nTogether (WFST), two of the respondents here. 586 F. 3d,\nat 675.       Two entities, WhoSigned.org and Know-\nThyNeighbor.org, issued a joint press release stating their\nintention to post the names of the R–71 petition signers\nonline, in a searchable format. See App. 11; 586 F. 3d, at\n4                       DOE v. REED\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n675.\n   The referendum petition sponsor and certain signers\nfiled a complaint and a motion for a preliminary injunction\nin the United States District Court for the Western Dis\ntrict of Washington, seeking to enjoin the secretary of\nstate from publicly releasing any documents that would\nreveal the names and contact information of the R–71\npetition signers. App. 4. Count I of the complaint alleges\nthat “[t]he Public Records Act is unconstitutional as ap\nplied to referendum petitions.” Id., at 16. Count II of the\ncomplaint alleges that “[t]he Public Records Act is uncon\nstitutional as applied to the Referendum 71 petition be\ncause there is a reasonable probability that the signatories\nof the Referendum 71 petition will be subjected to threats,\nharassment, and reprisals.” Id., at 17. Determining that\nthe PRA burdened core political speech, the District Court\nheld that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of\nCount I and granted them a preliminary injunction on\nthat count, enjoining release of the information on the\npetition. 661 F. Supp. 2d 1194, 1205–1206 (WD Wash.\n2009).\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir\ncuit reversed. Reviewing only Count I of the complaint,\nthe Court of Appeals held that plaintiffs were unlikely to\nsucceed on their claim that the PRA is unconstitutional as\napplied to referendum petitions generally. It therefore\nreversed the District Court’s grant of the preliminary\ninjunction. 586 F. 3d, at 681. We granted certiorari. 558\nU. S. ___ (2010).\n                            II\n  It is important at the outset to define the scope of the\nchallenge before us. As noted, Count I of the complaint\ncontends that the PRA “violates the First Amendment as\napplied to referendum petitions.” App. 16. Count II as\nserts that the PRA “is unconstitutional as applied to the\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nReferendum 71 petition.” Id., at 17. The District Court\ndecision was based solely on Count I; the Court of Appeals\ndecision reversing the District Court was similarly lim\nited. 586 F. 3d, at 676, n. 6. Neither court addressed\nCount II.\n   The parties disagree about whether Count I is properly\nviewed as a facial or as-applied challenge. Compare Reply\nBrief for Petitioners 8 (“Count I expressly made an as\napplied challenge”), with Brief for Respondent Reed 1\n(“This is a facial challenge to Washington’s Public Records\nAct”). It obviously has characteristics of both: The claim is\n“as applied” in the sense that it does not seek to strike the\nPRA in all its applications, but only to the extent it covers\nreferendum petitions. The claim is “facial” in that it is not\nlimited to plaintiffs’ particular case, but challenges appli\ncation of the law more broadly to all referendum petitions.\n   The label is not what matters. The important point is\nthat plaintiffs’ claim and the relief that would follow—an\ninjunction barring the secretary of state “from making\nreferendum petitions available to the public,” App. 16\n(Complaint Count I)—reach beyond the particular circum\nstances of these plaintiffs. They must therefore satisfy our\nstandards for a facial challenge to the extent of that reach.\nSee United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip\nop., at 10).\n                            III \n\n                             A\n\n   The compelled disclosure of signatory information on\nreferendum petitions is subject to review under the First\nAmendment. An individual expresses a view on a political\nmatter when he signs a petition under Washington’s\nreferendum procedure. In most cases, the individual’s\nsignature will express the view that the law subject to the\npetition should be overturned. Even if the signer is agnos\ntic as to the merits of the underlying law, his signature\n6                       DOE v. REED\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstill expresses the political view that the question should\nbe considered “by the whole electorate.” Meyer v. Grant,\n486 U. S. 414, 421 (1988). In either case, the expression of\na political view implicates a First Amendment right. The\nState, having “cho[sen] to tap the energy and the legiti\nmizing power of the democratic process, . . . must accord\nthe participants in that process the First Amendment\nrights that attach to their roles.” Republican Party of\nMinn. v. White, 536 U. S. 765, 788 (2002) (internal quota\ntion marks and ellipsis omitted).\n   Respondents counter that signing a petition is a legally\noperative legislative act and therefore “does not involve\nany significant expressive element.” Brief for Respondent\nReed 31. It is true that signing a referendum petition may\nultimately have the legal consequence of requiring the\nsecretary of state to place the referendum on the ballot.\nBut we do not see how adding such legal effect to an ex\npressive activity somehow deprives that activity of its\nexpressive component, taking it outside the scope of the\nFirst Amendment. Respondents themselves implicitly\nrecognize that the signature expresses a particular view\npoint, arguing that one purpose served by disclosure is to\nallow the public to engage signers in a debate on the mer\nits of the underlying law. See, e.g., id., at 45; Brief for\nRespondent WCOG 49; Brief for Respondent WFST 58.\n   Petition signing remains expressive even when it has\nlegal effect in the electoral process. But that is not to say\nthat the electoral context is irrelevant to the nature of our\nFirst Amendment review. We allow States significant\nflexibility in implementing their own voting systems. See\nBurdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, 433–434 (1992). To the\nextent a regulation concerns the legal effect of a particular\nactivity in that process, the government will be afforded\nsubstantial latitude to enforce that regulation. Also perti\nnent to our analysis is the fact that the PRA is not a pro\nhibition on speech, but instead a disclosure requirement.\n                    Cite as: 561 U.

Federal Election Comm’n, 558 U.

These precedents have reviewed such\nchallenges under what has been termed “exacting scru\ntiny.” See, e.g., Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 64 (1976)\n(per curiam) (“Since NAACP v. Alabama [357 U. S. 449\n(1958),] we have required that the subordinating interests\nof the State [offered to justify compelled disclosure] sur\nvive exacting scrutiny”); Citizens United, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 51) (“The Court has subjected [disclosure]\nrequirements to ‘exacting scrutiny’ ” (quoting Buckley,\nsupra, at 64)); Davis v.

American Constitu\ntional Law Foundation, Inc., 525 U.

To\nwithstand this scrutiny, “the strength of the governmental\ninterest must reflect the seriousness of the actual burden\non First Amendment rights.” Davis, supra, at ___ (slip op.,\nat 18) (citing Buckley, supra, at 68, 71).1\n——————\n  1 JUSTICE SCALIA doubts whether petition signing is entitled to any\n\nFirst Amendment protection at all. Post, at 1 (opinion concurring in\njudgment). His skepticism is based on the view that petition signing\nhas “legal effects” in the legislative process, while other aspects of\npolitical participation—with respect to which we have held there is a\n8                             DOE v. REED \n\n\n                           Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               B\n\n   Respondents assert two interests to justify the burdens\nof compelled disclosure under the PRA on First Amend\nment rights: (1) preserving the integrity of the electoral\nprocess by combating fraud, detecting invalid signatures,\nand fostering government transparency and accountabil\nity; and (2) providing information to the electorate about\nwho supports the petition. See, e.g., Brief for Respondent\nReed 39–42, 44–45. Because we determine that the\nState’s interest in preserving the integrity of the electoral\nprocess suffices to defeat the argument that the PRA is\nunconstitutional with respect to referendum petitions in\ngeneral, we need not, and do not, address the State’s\n“informational” interest.\n   The State’s interest in preserving the integrity of the\nelectoral process is undoubtedly important. “States allow\ning ballot initiatives have considerable leeway to protect\nthe integrity and reliability of the initiative process, as\nthey have with respect to election processes generally.”\nACLF, 525 U. S., at 191. The State’s interest is particu\nlarly strong with respect to efforts to root out fraud, which\nnot only may produce fraudulent outcomes, but has a\nsystemic effect as well: It “drives honest citizens out of the\ndemocratic process and breeds distrust of our govern\nment.” Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U. S. 1, 4 (2006) (per\ncuriam); see also Crawford v. Marion County Election Bd.,\n553 U. S. 181, 196 (2008) (opinion of STEVENS, J.). The\n——————\nFirst Amendment interest, see supra, at 5–7—do not. See post, at 3–4,\nand n. 3. That line is not as sharp as JUSTICE SCALIA would have it; he\nhimself recognizes “the existence of a First Amendment interest in\nvoting,” post, at 6, which of course also can have legal effect. The\ndistinction becomes even fuzzier given that only some petition signing\nhas legal effect, and any such legal effect attaches only well after the\nexpressive act of signing, if the secretary determines that the petition\nsatisfies the requirements for inclusion on the ballot. See post, at 3.\nPetitions that do not qualify for the ballot of course carry no legal effect.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthreat of fraud in this context is not merely hypothetical;\nrespondents and their amici cite a number of cases of\npetition-related fraud across the country to support the\npoint. See Brief for Respondent Reed 43; Brief for State of\nOhio et al. as Amici Curiae 22–24.\n   But the State’s interest in preserving electoral integrity\nis not limited to combating fraud. That interest extends to\nefforts to ferret out invalid signatures caused not by fraud\nbut by simple mistake, such as duplicate signatures or\nsignatures of individuals who are not registered to vote in\nthe State. See Brief for Respondent Reed 42. That inter\nest also extends more generally to promoting transparency\nand accountability in the electoral process, which the\nState argues is “essential to the proper functioning of a\ndemocracy.” Id., at 39.\n   Plaintiffs contend that the disclosure requirements of\nthe PRA are not “sufficiently related” to the interest of\nprotecting the integrity of the electoral process. Brief for\nPetitioners 51. They argue that disclosure is not neces\nsary because the secretary of state is already charged with\nverifying and canvassing the names on a petition, advo\ncates and opponents of a measure can observe that proc\ness, and any citizen can challenge the secretary’s actions\nin court. See Wash. Rev. Code §§29A.72.230, 29A.72.240.\nThey also stress that existing criminal penalties reduce\nthe danger of fraud in the petition process. See Brief for\nPetitioners 50; §§29A.84.210, 29A.84.230, 29A.84.250.\n   But the secretary’s verification and canvassing will not\ncatch all invalid signatures: The job is large and difficult\n(the secretary ordinarily checks “only 3 to 5% of signa\ntures,” Brief for Respondent WFST 54), and the secretary\ncan make mistakes, too, see Brief for Respondent Reed 42.\nPublic disclosure can help cure the inadequacies of the\nverification and canvassing process.\n   Disclosure also helps prevent certain types of petition\nfraud otherwise difficult to detect, such as outright forgery\n10                          DOE v. REED\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nand “bait and switch” fraud, in which an individual signs\nthe petition based on a misrepresentation of the underly\ning issue. See Brief for Respondent WFST 9–11, 53–54;\ncf. Brief for Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian Political\nCaucus et al. as Amici Curiae 18–22 (detailing “bait and\nswitch” fraud in a petition drive in Massachusetts). The\nsigner is in the best position to detect these types of\nfraud, and public disclosure can bring the issue to the\nsigner’s attention.\n   Public disclosure thus helps ensure that the only signa\ntures counted are those that should be, and that the only\nreferenda placed on the ballot are those that garner\nenough valid signatures. Public disclosure also promotes\ntransparency and accountability in the electoral process to\nan extent other measures cannot. In light of the foregoing,\nwe reject plaintiffs’ argument and conclude that public\ndisclosure of referendum petitions in general is substan\ntially related to the important interest of preserving the\nintegrity of the electoral process.2\n                               C\n  Plaintiffs’ more significant objection is that “the\nstrength of the governmental interest” does not “reflect\nthe seriousness of the actual burden on First Amendment\nrights.” Davis, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18) (citing\nBuckley, 424 U. S., at 68, 71); see, e.g., Brief for Petitioners\n12–13, 30. According to plaintiffs, the objective of those\nseeking disclosure of the R–71 petition is not to prevent\nfraud, but to publicly identify those who had validly signed\nand to broadcast the signers’ political views on the subject\nof the petition. Plaintiffs allege, for example, that several\n——————\n  2 JUSTICE THOMAS’s contrary assessment of the relationship between\n\nthe disclosure of referendum petitions generally and the State’s inter\nests in this case is based on his determination that strict scrutiny\napplies, post, at 5 (dissenting opinion), rather than the standard of\nreview that we have concluded is appropriate, see supra, at 7.\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

See App. 11; Brief for Petitioners 8, 46–47.\n   Plaintiffs explain that once on the Internet, the petition\nsigners’ names and addresses “can be combined with\npublicly available phone numbers and maps,” in what will\neffectively become a blueprint for harassment and intimi\ndation. Id., at 46. To support their claim that they will be\nsubject to reprisals, plaintiffs cite examples from the\nhistory of a similar proposition in California, see, e.g., id.,\nat 2–6, 31–32, and from the experience of one of the peti\ntion sponsors in this case, see App. 9.\n   In related contexts, we have explained that those\nresisting disclosure can prevail under the First Amend\nment if they can show “a reasonable probability that the\ncompelled disclosure [of personal information] will sub\nject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from ei\nther Government officials or private parties.” Buckley,\nsupra, at 74; see also Citizens United, 558 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 52). The question before us, however, is not\nwhether PRA disclosure violates the First Amendment\nwith respect to those who signed the R–71 petition, or\nother particularly controversial petitions. The question\ninstead is whether such disclosure in general violates\nthe First Amendment rights of those who sign referen\ndum petitions.\n   The problem for plaintiffs is that their argument rests\nalmost entirely on the specific harm they say would attend\ndisclosure of the information on the R–71 petition, or on\nsimilarly controversial ones. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioners\n10, 26–29, 46, 56. But typical referendum petitions “con\ncern tax policy, revenue, budget, or other state law issues.”\nBrief for Respondent WFST 36 (listing referenda); see also\nApp. 26 (stating that in recent years the State has re\nceived PRA requests for petitions supporting initiatives\nconcerning limiting motor vehicle charges; government\n12                       DOE v.

Voters care about such issues,\nsome quite deeply—but there is no reason to assume that\nany burdens imposed by disclosure of typical referendum\npetitions would be remotely like the burdens plaintiffs fear\nin this case.\n  Plaintiffs have offered little in response. They have\nprovided us scant evidence or argument beyond the bur\ndens they assert disclosure would impose on R–71 petition\nsigners or the signers of other similarly controversial\npetitions. Indeed, what little plaintiffs do offer with\nrespect to typical petitions in Washington hurts, not\nhelps: Several other petitions in the State “have been\nsubject to release in recent years,” plaintiffs tell us, Brief\nfor Petitioners 50, but apparently that release has come\nwithout incident. Cf. Citizens United, supra, at ___ (slip\nop., at 55) (“Citizens United has been disclosing its donors\nfor years and has identified no instance of harassment or\nretaliation”).\n  Faced with the State’s unrebutted arguments that only\nmodest burdens attend the disclosure of a typical petition,\nwe must reject plaintiffs’ broad challenge to the PRA. In\ndoing so, we note—as we have in other election law disclo\nsure cases—that upholding the law against a broad-based\nchallenge does not foreclose a litigant’s success in a nar\nrower one. See Buckley, supra, at 74 (“minor parties” may\nbe exempt from disclosure requirements if they can show\n“a reasonable probability that the compelled disclosure of\na party’s contributors’ names will subject them to threats,\nharassment, or reprisals from either Government officials\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

Rev. Code §42.56.001\net seq. (2008), of the names and addresses of persons who\nsign referendum petitions does not as a general matter\nviolate the First Amendment, ante, at 13, and I agree with\nthat conclusion.      Many referendum petitions concern\nrelatively uncontroversial matters, see ante, at 11–12, and\nplaintiffs have provided no reason to think that disclosure\nof signatory information in those contexts would signifi\ncantly chill the willingness of voters to sign. Plaintiffs’\nfacial challenge therefore must fail. See ante, at 2, 5.\n   Nonetheless, facially valid disclosure requirements can\nimpose heavy burdens on First Amendment rights in\nindividual cases. Acknowledging that reality, we have\nlong held that speakers can obtain as-applied exemptions\nfrom disclosure requirements if they can show “a reason\nable probability that the compelled disclosure of [personal\ninformation] will subject them to threats, harassment, or\nreprisals from either Government officials or private\nparties.” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 74 (1976) (per\ncuriam); see also Citizens United v. Federal Election\nComm’n, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 52); McCon\nnell v. Federal Election Comm’n, 540 U. S. 93, 197–198\n(2003); Brown v. Socialist Workers ’74 Campaign Comm.\n2                       DOE v. REED\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\n(Ohio), 459 U. S. 87, 93 (1982). Because compelled disclo\nsure can “burden the ability to speak,” Citizens United,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 51), and “seriously infringe on\nprivacy of association and belief guaranteed by the First\nAmendment,” Buckley, supra, at 64, the as-applied exemp\ntion plays a critical role in safeguarding First Amendment\nrights.\n                                I\n   The possibility of prevailing in an as-applied challenge\nprovides adequate protection for First Amendment rights\nonly if (1) speakers can obtain the exemption sufficiently\nfar in advance to avoid chilling protected speech and (2)\nthe showing necessary to obtain the exemption is not\noverly burdensome. With respect to the first requirement,\nthe as-applied exemption becomes practically worthless if\nspeakers cannot obtain the exemption quickly and well in\nadvance of speaking. To avoid the possibility that a dis\nclosure requirement might chill the willingness of voters\nto sign a referendum petition (and thus burden a circula\ntor’s ability to collect the necessary number of signatures,\ncf. Meyer v. Grant, 486 U. S. 414, 423 (1988)), voters must\nhave some assurance at the time when they are presented\nwith the petition that their names and identifying infor\nmation will not be released to the public. The only way a\ncirculator can provide such assurance, however, is if the\ncirculator has sought and obtained an as-applied exemp\ntion from the disclosure requirement well before circulat\ning the petition. Otherwise, the best the circulator could\ndo would be to tell voters that an exemption might be\nobtained at some point in the future. Such speculation\nwould often be insufficient to alleviate voters’ concerns\nabout the possibility of being subjected to threats, har\nassment, or reprisals. Cf. Citizens United, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 5–6) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part).\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)             3\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\n   Additionally, speakers must be able to obtain an as\napplied exemption without clearing a high evidentiary\nhurdle. We acknowledged as much in Buckley, where we\nnoted that “unduly strict requirements of proof could\nimpose a heavy burden” on speech. 424 U. S., at 74.\nRecognizing that speakers “must be allowed sufficient\nflexibility in the proof of injury to assure a fair considera\ntion of their claim,” we emphasized that speakers “need\nshow only a reasonable probability” that disclosure will\nlead to threats, harassment, or reprisals. Ibid. (emphasis\nadded). We stated that speakers could rely on a wide\narray of evidence to meet that standard, including “spe\ncific evidence of past or present harassment of [group]\nmembers,” “harassment directed against the organization\nitself,” or a “pattern of threats or specific manifestations of\npublic hostility.” Ibid. Significantly, we also made clear\nthat “[n]ew [groups] that have no history upon which to\ndraw may be able to offer evidence of reprisals and threats\ndirected against individuals or organizations holding\nsimilar views.” Ibid. From its inception, therefore, the as\napplied exemption has not imposed onerous burdens of\nproof on speakers who fear that disclosure might lead to\nharassment or intimidation.\n                            II\n  In light of those principles, the plaintiffs in this case\nhave a strong argument that the PRA violates the First\nAmendment as applied to the Referendum 71 petition.\n                             A\n   Consider first the burdens on plaintiffs’ First Amend\nment rights. The widespread harassment and intimida\ntion suffered by supporters of California’s Proposition 8\nprovides strong support for an as-applied exemption in the\npresent case. See Buckley, supra, at 74 (explaining that\nspeakers seeking as-applied relief from a disclosure re\n4                       DOE v. REED\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nquirement can rely on “evidence of reprisals and threats\ndirected against individuals or organizations holding\nsimilar views”). Proposition 8 amended the California\nConstitution to provide that “[o]nly marriage between a\nman and a woman is valid or recognized in California,”\nCal. Const., Art. I, §7.5, and plaintiffs submitted to the\nDistrict Court substantial evidence of the harassment\nsuffered by Proposition 8 supporters, see Declaration of\nScott F. Bieniek in No. C:09–5456 (WD Wash.), Exhs. 12,\n13. Members of this Court have also noted that harass\nment. See Hollingsworth v. Perry, 558 U. S. ___, ___\n(2010) (per curiam) (slip op., at 2–3); Citizens United, 558\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2–3) (opinion of THOMAS, J.).\nIndeed, if the evidence relating to Proposition 8 is not\nsufficient to obtain an as-applied exemption in this case,\none may wonder whether that vehicle provides any mean\ningful protection for the First Amendment rights of per\nsons who circulate and sign referendum and initiative\npetitions.\n   What is more, when plaintiffs return to the District\nCourt, they will have the opportunity to develop evidence\nof intimidation and harassment of Referendum 71 sup\nporters—an opportunity that was pretermitted because of\nthe District Court’s decision to grant a preliminary injunc\ntion on count 1 of plaintiffs’ complaint. See 661 F. Supp.\n2d 1194, 1205–1206 (WD Wash. 2009); Tr. of Oral Arg. 40–\n41. For example, plaintiffs allege that the campaign\nmanager for one of the plaintiff groups received threaten\ning e-mails and phone calls, and that the threats were so\nsevere that the manager filed a complaint with the local\nsheriff and had his children sleep in an interior room of\nhis home.

S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nfurther confirms that courts should be generous in grant\ning as-applied relief in this context. See Buckley, supra, at\n71 (recognizing that the weakness of the State’s interests\nin an individual case can require exempting speakers from\ncompelled disclosure); Brown, 459 U. S., at 92–93 (same).\nAs the Court notes, respondents rely on two interests to\njustify compelled disclosure in this context: (1) providing\ninformation to voters about who supports a referendum\npetition; and (2) preserving the integrity of the referen\ndum process by detecting fraudulent and mistaken signa\ntures. Ante, at 8.\n                              1\n  In my view, respondents’ asserted informational interest\nwill not in any case be sufficient to trump the First\nAmendment rights of signers and circulators who face a\nthreat of harassment. Respondents maintain that publicly\ndisclosing the names and addresses of referendum signa\ntories provides the voting public with “insight into\nwhether support for holding a vote comes predominantly\nfrom particular interest groups, political or religious or\nganizations, or other group[s] of citizens,” and thus allows\nvoters to draw inferences about whether they should\nsupport or oppose the referendum.

Additionally, respondents\nargue that disclosure “allows Washington voters to engage\nin discussion of referred measures with persons whose\nacts secured the election and suspension of state law.” Id.,\nat 45; see also Brief for Respondent Washington Families\nStanding Together 58.\n  The implications of accepting such an argument are\nbreathtaking. Were we to accept respondents’ asserted\ninformational interest, the State would be free to require\npetition signers to disclose all kinds of demographic infor\nmation, including the signer’s race, religion, political\n6                       DOE v. REED\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\naffiliation, sexual orientation, ethnic background, and\ninterest-group memberships. Requiring such disclosures,\nhowever, runs headfirst into a half century of our case\nlaw, which firmly establishes that individuals have a right\nto privacy of belief and association. See Rumsfeld v. Fo\nrum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U. S.\n47, 69 (2006); Brown, supra, at 91; Buckley, 424 U. S., at\n64; DeGregory v. Attorney General of N. H., 383 U.

Indeed, the\nState’s informational interest paints such a chilling pic\nture of the role of government in our lives that at oral\nargument the Washington attorney general balked when\nconfronted with the logical implications of accepting such\nan argument, conceding that the State could not require\npetition signers to disclose their religion or ethnicity. Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 37, 56.\n   Respondents’ informational interest is no more legiti\nmate when viewed as a means of providing the public with\ninformation needed to locate and contact supporters of a\nreferendum. In the name of pursuing such an interest, the\nState would be free to require petition signers to disclose\nany information that would more easily enable members\nof the voting public to contact them and engage them in\ndiscussion, including telephone numbers, e-mail ad\ndresses, and Internet aliases. Once again, permitting the\ngovernment to require speakers to disclose such informa\ntion runs against the current of our associational privacy\ncases. But more important, when speakers are faced with\na reasonable probability of harassment or intimidation,\nthe State no longer has any interest in enabling the public\nto locate and contact supporters of a particular measure—\nfor in that instance, disclosure becomes a means of facili\ntating harassment that impermissibly chills the exercise\nof First Amendment rights.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

Ante, at 8. But I harbor serious doubts as\nto whether public disclosure of signatory information\nserves that interest in a way that always “reflect[s] the\nseriousness of the actual burden on First Amendment\nrights.” Davis v. Federal Election Comm’n, 554 U. S. ___,\n___ (2008) (slip op., at 18).\n  First, the realities of Washington law undermine the\nState’s argument that public disclosure is necessary to\n8                        DOE v. REED\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\nensure the integrity of the referendum process. The State\nof Washington first authorized voter initiatives via consti\ntutional amendment in 1912, and the following year the\nWashington Legislature passed a statute specifying the\nparticulars of the referendum process. See State ex rel.\nCase v. Superior Ct. for Thurston Cty., 81 Wash. 623, 628,\n143 P. 461, 462 (1914). Significantly, Washington’s laws\npertaining to initiatives and referenda did not then and do\nnot now authorize the public disclosure of signatory in\nformation. See Wash. Rev. Code §29A.72.010 et seq.; 1913\nWash. Laws. pp. 418–437. Instead, the public disclosure\nrequirement stems from the PRA, which was enacted in\n1972 and which requires the public disclosure of state\ndocuments generally, not referendum documents specifi\ncally. See Wash. Rev. Code §42.56.001 et seq. Indeed, if\nanything, Washington’s referenda and initiative laws\nsuggest that signatory information should remain confi\ndential: Outside observers are permitted to observe the\nsecretary of state’s verification and canvassing process\nonly “so long as they make no record of the names, ad\ndresses, or other information on the petitions or related\nrecords during the verification process,” §29A.72.230, and\nthe State is required to destroy all those petitions that fail\nto qualify for the ballot, §29A.72.200.\n   Second, the State fails to come to grips with the fact\nthat public disclosure of referendum signatory information\nis a relatively recent practice in Washington. Prior to the\nadoption of the PRA in 1972, the Washington attorney\ngeneral took the view that referendum petitions were not\nsubject to public disclosure. See Op. Wash. Atty. Gen. 55–\n57 No. 274, pp. 1–2 (May 28, 1956), online at\nhttp://www.atg.wa.gov/AGOOpinions/opinion.aspx?section\n=topic&id=10488 (all Internet materials as visited June\n17, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file) (de\nclaring that public disclosure of initiative petitions would\nbe “contrary to public policy” and would run contrary to “a\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

Indeed, the\nsecretary of state represents on his Web site that even\nafter the PRA was enacted, “various Secretary of State\nadministrations took the position, from 1973 to 1998, that\nthe personal information on petition sheets were NOT\nsubject to disclosure.” B. Zylstra, The Disclosure History\nof Petition Sheets (Sept. 17, 2009), online at\nhttp://blogs.sos.wa.gov/FromOurCorner/index.php/2009/09/\nthe-disclosure-history-of-petition-sheets/.    Although the\nsecretary of state apparently changed this policy in the\nlate 1990’s, it appears that the secretary did not release\nany initiative petitions until 2006. Ibid. And to date, the\nsecretary has released only a handful of petitions. Ibid.;\nApp. 26. That history substantially undermines the\nState’s assertion that public disclosure is necessary to\nensure the integrity of the referendum process. For nearly\na century, Washington’s referendum process operated—\nand apparently operated successfully—without the public\ndisclosure of signatory information. The State has failed\nto explain how circumstances have changed so dramati\ncally in recent years that public disclosure is now\nrequired.\n  Third, the experiences of other States demonstrates that\npublicly disclosing the names and identifying information\nof referendum signatories is not necessary to protect\nagainst fraud and mistake. To give but one example,\nCalifornia has had more initiatives on the ballot than any\nother State save Oregon. See Initiative and Referendum\nInstitute, Initiative Use, p. 1 (Feb. 2009), online at\nhttp://www.iandrinstitute.org/IRI%20Initiative%20Use%2\n0%281904=2008%29.pdf.         Nonetheless, California law\nexplicitly protects the privacy of initiative and referendum\nsignatories. See Cal. Elec. Code Ann. §18650 (West 2003);\n10                      DOE v. REED\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nCal. Govt. Code Ann. §6253.5 (West 2008). It is thus\nentirely possible for a State to keep signatory information\nprivate and maintain a referendum and initiative process\nfree from fraud.\n   Finally, Washington could easily and cheaply employ\nalternative mechanisms for protecting against fraud and\nmistake that would be far more protective of circulators’\nand signers’ First Amendment rights. For example, the\nWashington attorney general represented to us at oral\nargument that “the Secretary of State’s first step after\nreceiving submitted petitions is to take them to his archiv\ning section and to have them digitized.” Tr. of Oral Arg.\n30. With a digitized list, it should be relatively easy for\nthe secretary to check for duplicate signatures on a refer\nendum petition. And given that the secretary maintains a\n“centralized, uniform, interactive computerized statewide\nvoter registration list that contains the name and registra\ntion information of every registered voter in the state,”\nWash. Rev. Code Ann. §29A.08.125(1) (West Supp. 2010),\nthe secretary could use a computer program to cross-check\nthe names and addresses on the petition with the names\nand addresses on the voter registration roles, thus ensur\ning the accuracy and legitimacy of each signature.\n   Additionally, using the digitized version of the referen\ndum petition, the State could set up a simple system for\nWashington citizens to check whether their names have\nbeen fraudulently signed to a petition. For example, on\nhis Web site, the secretary maintains an interface that\nallows voters to confirm their voter registration informa\ntion simply by inputting their name and date of birth. See\nhttp://wei.secstate.wa.gov/osos/VoterVault/Pages/MyVote.a\nspx. Presumably the secretary could set up a similar\ninterface for referendum petitions. Indeed, the process\nwould seem to be all the more simple given that Washing\nton requires a “unique identifier [to] be assigned to each\nregistered voter in the state.” §29A.08.125(4).\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

These mechanisms of direct democracy are\nnot compelled by the Federal Constitution. It is instead\nup to the people of each State, acting in their sovereign\ncapacity, to decide whether and how to permit legislation\nby popular action. States enjoy “considerable leeway” to\nchoose the subjects that are eligible for placement on the\nballot and to specify the requirements for obtaining ballot\naccess (e.g., the number of signatures required, the time\nfor submission, and the method of verification). Buckley v.\nAmerican Constitutional Law Foundation, Inc., 525 U. S.\n182, 191 (1999). As the Court properly recognizes, each of\nthese structural decisions “inevitably affects—at least to\nsome degree—the individual’s right” to speak about politi\ncal issues and “to associate with others for political ends.”\nAnderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 788 (1983). For\ninstance, requiring petition signers to be registered voters\nor to use their real names no doubt limits the ability or\nwillingness of some individuals to undertake the expres\n2                       DOE v. REED\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nsive act of signing a petition. Regulations of this nature,\nhowever, stand “a step removed from the communicative\naspect of petitioning,” and the ability of States to impose\nthem can scarcely be doubted. Buckley, 525 U. S., at 215\n(O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissent\ning in part); see also McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n,\n514 U. S. 334, 345 (1995) (contrasting measures to “control\nthe mechanics of the electoral process” with the “regula\ntion of pure speech”). It is by no means necessary for a\nState to prove that such “reasonable, nondiscriminatory\nrestrictions” are narrowly tailored to its interests. Ander\nson, 460 U. S., at 788.\n   The Court today confirms that the State of Washington’s\ndecision to make referendum petition signatures available\nfor public inspection falls squarely within the realm of\npermissible election-related regulations. Cf. Buckley, 525\nU. S., at 200 (describing a state law requiring petition\ncirculators to submit affidavits containing their names\nand addresses as “exemplif[ying] the type of regulation”\nthat States may adopt). Public disclosure of the identity of\npetition signers, which is the rule in the overwhelming\nmajority of States that use initiatives and referenda,\nadvances States’ vital interests in “[p]reserving the integ\nrity of the electoral process, preventing corruption, and\nsustaining the active, alert responsibility of the individual\ncitizen in a democracy for the wise conduct of govern\nment.” First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765,\n788–789 (1978) (internal quotation marks and alterations\nomitted); see also Citizens United v. Federal Election\nComm’n, 558 U.

In a society “in which the citizenry is the final\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

Cohn, 420 U. S. 469, 495 (1975); see\nalso post, at 4 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (noting\nthat “[t]he public nature of federal lawmaking is constitu\ntionally required”).\n   On the other side of the ledger, I view the burden of\npublic disclosure on speech and associational rights as\nminimal in this context. As this Court has observed with\nrespect to campaign-finance regulations, “disclosure re\nquirements . . . ‘do not prevent anyone from speaking.’ ”\nCitizens United, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 51). When it\ncomes to initiatives and referenda, the impact of public\ndisclosure on expressive interests is even more attenuated.\nWhile campaign-finance disclosure injects the government\ninto what would otherwise have been private political\nactivity, the process of legislating by referendum is inher\nently public. To qualify a referendum for the ballot, citi\nzens are required to sign a petition and supply identifying\ninformation to the State. The act of signing typically\noccurs in public, and the circulators who collect and sub\nmit signatures ordinarily owe signers no guarantee of\nconfidentiality. For persons with the “civic courage” to\nparticipate in this process, post, at 10 (opinion of SCALIA,\nJ.), the State’s decision to make accessible what they\nvoluntarily place in the public sphere should not deter\nthem from engaging in the expressive act of petition sign\ning. Disclosure of the identity of petition signers, more\nover, in no way directly impairs the ability of anyone to\nspeak and associate for political ends either publicly or\nprivately.\n   Given the relative weight of the interests at stake and\nthe traditionally public nature of initiative and referen\ndum processes, the Court rightly rejects petitioners’ con\nstitutional challenge to the State of Washington’s petition\ndisclosure regulations. These same considerations also\n4                       DOE v. REED\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nmean that any party attempting to challenge particular\napplications of the State’s regulations will bear a heavy\nburden. Even when a referendum involves a particularly\ncontroversial subject and some petition signers fear har\nassment from nonstate actors, a State’s important inter\nests in “protect[ing] the integrity and reliability of the\ninitiative process” remain undiminished, and the State\nretains significant discretion in advancing those interests.\nBuckley, 525 U. S., at 191. Likewise, because the expres\nsive interests implicated by the act of petition signing are\nalways modest, I find it difficult to see how any incre\nmental disincentive to sign a petition would tip the consti\ntutional balance. Case-specific relief may be available\nwhen a State selectively applies a facially neutral petition\ndisclosure rule in a manner that discriminates based on\nthe content of referenda or the viewpoint of petition sign\ners, or in the rare circumstance in which disclosure poses\na reasonable probability of serious and widespread har\nassment that the State is unwilling or unable to control.\nCf. NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S. 449\n(1958). Allowing case-specific invalidation under a more\nforgiving standard would unduly diminish the substantial\nbreathing room States are afforded to adopt and imple\nment reasonable, nondiscriminatory measures like the\ndisclosure requirement now at issue. Accordingly, courts\npresented with an as-applied challenge to a regulation\nauthorizing the disclosure of referendum petitions should\nbe deeply skeptical of any assertion that the Constitution,\nwhich embraces political transparency, compels States to\nconceal the identity of persons who seek to participate in\nlawmaking through a state-created referendum process.\nWith this understanding, I join the opinion of the Court.\n                  Cite as: 561 U.

It is not about a restriction on\nvoting or on speech and does not involve a classic disclo\nsure requirement. Rather, the case concerns a neutral,\nnondiscriminatory policy of disclosing information already\nin the State’s possession that, it has been alleged, might\none day indirectly burden petition signatories. The bur\nden imposed by Washington’s application of the Public\nRecords Act (PRA) to referendum petitions in the vast\nmajority, if not all, its applications is not substantial. And\nthe State has given a more than adequate justification for\nits choice.\n   For a number of reasons, the application of the PRA to\nreferendum petitions does not substantially burden any\nindividual’s expression. First, it is not “a regulation of\npure speech.” McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 514\nU. S. 334, 345 (1995); cf. United States v. O’Brien, 391\nU. S. 367, 377 (1968). It does not prohibit expression, nor\ndoes it require that any person signing a petition disclose\nor say anything at all. See McIntyre, 514 U. S. 334. Nor\ndoes the State’s disclosure alter the content of a speaker’s\nmessage. See id., at 342–343.\n   Second, any effect on speech that disclosure might have\nis minimal. The PRA does not necessarily make it more\n2                             DOE v. REED\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\ndifficult to circulate or obtain signatures on a petition, see\nBuckley v. American Constitutional Law Foundation, Inc.,\n525 U.

Regardless of whether someone signs a referendum\npetition, that person remains free to say anything to any\none at any time. If disclosure indirectly burdens a\nspeaker, “the amount of speech covered” is small—only a\nsingle, narrow message conveying one fact in one place,\nWatchtower Bible & Tract Soc. of N. Y., Inc. v. Village of\nStratton, 536 U. S. 150, 165 (2002); cf. Cox v. New Hamp\nshire, 312 U. S. 569 (1941). And while the democratic act\nof casting a ballot or signing a petition does serve an\nexpressive purpose, the act does not involve any “interac\ntive communication,” Meyer, 486 U. S., at 422, and is “not\nprincipally” a method of “individual expression of political\nsentiment,” Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520\nU. S. 351, 373 (1997) (STEVENS, J., dissenting); cf. O’Brien,\n391 U. S., at 377.1\n   Weighed against the possible burden on constitutional\nrights are the State’s justifications for its rule. In this\ncase, the State has posited a perfectly adequate justifica\ntion: an interest in deterring and detecting petition fraud.2\nGiven the pedigree of this interest and of similar regula\ntions, the State need not produce concrete evidence that\nthe PRA is the best way to prevent fraud. See Crawford v.\n——————\n    1 Although a “petition” is a classic means of political expression, the\ntype of petition at issue in this case is not merely a document on which\npeople are expressing their views but rather is a state-created forum with\na particular function: sorting those issues that have enough public\nsupport to warrant limited space on a referendum ballot. Cf. Widmar v.\nVincent, 454 U. S. 263, 278 (1981) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).\n  2 Washington also points out that its disclosure policy informs voters\n\nabout who supports the particular referendum. In certain election-law\ncontexts, this informational rationale (among others) may provide a\nbasis for regulation; in this case, there is no need to look beyond the\nState’s quite obvious antifraud interest.\n                      Cite as: 561 U.

That one may call into\nquestion the process used to create a law is not a reason to “disregar[d]”\n“sufficiently strong,” “valid[,] neutral justifications” for an otherwise\n“nondiscriminatory” policy. Crawford, 553 U. S., at 204. But it is a\nreason to examine more carefully the justifications for that measure.\n4                            DOE v.

S., at 342.4\n   In my view, this is unlikely to occur in cases involving\nthe PRA. Any burden on speech that petitioners posit is\nspeculative as well as indirect. For an as-applied chal\nlenge to a law such as the PRA to succeed, there would\nhave to be a significant threat of harassment directed at\nthose who sign the petition that cannot be mitigated by\nlaw enforcement measures.5 Moreover, the character of\nthe law challenged in a referendum does not, in itself,\naffect the analysis. Debates about tax policy and regula\ntion of private property can become just as heated as\ndebates about domestic partnerships. And as a general\nmatter, it is very difficult to show that by later disclosing\nthe names of petition signatories, individuals will be less\nwilling to sign petitions. Just as we have in the past, I\nwould demand strong evidence before concluding that an\nindirect and speculative chain of events imposes a sub\n\n\n——————\n   4 JUSTICE SCALIA conceives of the issue as a right to anonymous\n\nspeech. See, e.g., post, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment). But our\ndecision in McIntyre posited no such freewheeling right. The Constitu\ntion protects “freedom of speech.” Amdt. 1; see also McIntyre, 514 U. S.,\nat 336 (“The question presented is whether [a] . . . statute that prohib\nits the distribution of anonymous campaign literature is a ‘law . . .\nabridging the freedom of speech’ within the meaning of the First\nAmendment”). That freedom can be burdened by a law that exposes\nthe speaker to fines, as much as it can be burdened by a law that\nexposes a speaker to harassment, changes the content of his speech, or\nprejudices others against his message. See id., at 342. The right,\nhowever, is the right to speak, not the right to speak without being\nfined or the right to speak anonymously.\n   5 A rare case may also arise in which the level of threat to any indi\n\nvidual is not quite so high but a State’s disclosure would substantially\nlimit a group’s ability to “garner the number of signatures necessary to\nplace [a] matter on the ballot,” thereby “limiting [its] ability to make\nthe matter the focus of statewide discussion.” Meyer v.

SAM REED, \n\n    WASHINGTON SECRETARY OF STATE, ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [June 24, 2010] \n\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.\n  Plaintiffs claim the First Amendment, as applied to the\nStates through the Fourteenth Amendment, forbids the\nState of Washington to release to the public signed refer\nendum petitions, which they submitted to the State in\norder to suspend operation of a law and put it to a popular\nvote. I doubt whether signing a petition that has the\neffect of suspending a law fits within “the freedom of\nspeech” at all. But even if, as the Court concludes, ante, at\n5, it does, a long history of practice shows that the First\nAmendment does not prohibit public disclosure.\n                             I\n  We should not repeat and extend the mistake of McIn\ntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 514 U. S. 334 (1995).\nThere, with neither textual support nor precedents requir\ning the result, the Court invalidated a form of election\nregulation that had been widely used by the States since\nthe end of the 19th century. Id., at 371 (SCALIA, J., dis\nsenting). The Court held that an Ohio statute prohibiting\nthe distribution of anonymous campaign literature vio\nlated the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n  Mrs. McIntyre sought a general right to “speak” anony\nmously about a referendum. Here, plaintiffs go one step\nfurther—they seek a general right to participate anony\n2                            DOE v. REED\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nmously in the referendum itself.1 Referendum petitions\nare subject to public disclosure under the Public Records\nAct (PRA), Wash. Rev. Code §42.56.001 et seq., which\nrequires government agencies to “make available for\npublic inspection and copying all public records,” subject to\ncertain exemptions not relevant here.           §42.56.070(1)\n(2008). Plaintiffs contend that disclosure of the names,\nand other personal information included on the petitions,\nof those who took this legislative action violates their First\nAmendment right to anonymity.\n   Today’s opinion acknowledges such a right, finding that\nit can be denied here only because of the State’s interest in\n“preserving the integrity of the electoral process,” ante, at\n8. In my view this is not a matter for judicial interest\nbalancing. Our Nation’s longstanding traditions of legis\nlating and voting in public refute the claim that the First\nAmendment accords a right to anonymity in the perform\nance of an act with governmental effect. “A governmental\npractice that has become general throughout the United\n——————\n  1 Plaintiffs seem to disavow reliance on McIntyre v. Ohio Elections\n\nComm’n, 514 U. S. 334 (1995), see Reply Brief for Petitioners 12.\nCertainly, there are differences between McIntyre and this case. Mrs.\nMcIntyre was required to disclose her identity herself, by placing her\nname on her handbill. Here, plaintiffs do not object to signing their\nnames to the referendum petition, where it can presumably be observed\nby later signers; they challenge only the later disclosure of that infor\nmation by the State. But both cases are about public disclosure, and\nboth involve a claim to anonymity under the First Amendment. If\nanything, the line plaintiffs seek to draw—which seeks a sort of partial\nanonymity—is stranger still.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS quibbles with the shorthand I use, and tries to rein\nin McIntyre’s holding, by saying that it did not create a “right to speak\nanonymously,” ante, at 4, n. 4 (opinion concurring in part and concur\nring in judgment). But McIntyre used the same shorthand. See 514\nU. S., at 357 (“[t]he right to remain anonymous”); id., at 342 (“[t]he\nfreedom to publish anonymously”); see also ibid. (“an author’s decision\nto remain anonymous . . . is an aspect of the freedom of speech pro\ntected by the First Amendment”).\n                    Cite as: 561 U.

The Wash\nington Constitution vests “[t]he legislative authority” of\nthe State in the legislature, but “the people reserve to\nthemselves the power . . . to approve or reject at the polls\nany act, item, section, or part of any bill, act, or law passed\nby the legislature.” Art. 2, §1. This “referendum” power of\npopular legislation is exercised by submitting a petition, in\naccordance with certain specifications, to the Washington\nsecretary of state with valid signatures of registered vot\ners in number equal to or exceeding four percent of the\nvotes cast in the last gubernatorial election. §1(b); Wash.\nRev. Code §29A.72.100, 130, 140, 150, 160 (2008).\n  The filing of a referendum petition that satisfies these\nrequirements has two legal effects: (1) It requires the\nsecretary to place the measure referred to the people on\nthe ballot at the next general election; and (2) it suspends\noperation of the measure, causing it only to have effect 30\ndays after it is approved during that election. Art. 2,\n§1(d). See Brief for Respondent Sam Reed, Secretary of\nState of Washington 2–6. A voter who signs a referendum\npetition is therefore exercising legislative power because\nhis signature, somewhat like a vote for or against a bill in\nthe legislature, seeks to affect the legal force of the meas\nure at issue.2\n——————\n  2 The Court notes that “only some petition signing has legal effect.”\n\nAnte, at 8, n. 1. That is true. Some petitions may never be submitted\nto the secretary; they are irrelevant here, since they will never be\nsubject to the PRA. But some petitions that are submitted to the\nsecretary may lack the requisite number of signatures. Even as to\n4                             DOE v. REED\n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n  Plaintiffs point to no precedent from this Court holding\nthat legislating is protected by the First Amendment.3\nNor do they identify historical evidence demonstrating\nthat “the freedom of speech” the First Amendment codified\nencompassed a right to legislate without public disclosure.\nThis should come as no surprise; the exercise of lawmak\ning power in the United States has traditionally been\npublic.\n  The public nature of federal lawmaking is constitution\nally required. Article I, §5, cl. 3 requires Congress to\nlegislate in public: “Each House shall keep a Journal of its\nProceedings, and from time to time publish the same,\nexcepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require\nSecrecy; and the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either\nHouse on any question shall, at the Desire of one fifth of\nthose Present, be entered on the Journal.”4 State constitu\n——————\nthose, the petition signer has exercised his portion of the legislative\npower when he signs the petition, much like a legislator who casts a\nlosing vote.\n  3 The Court quotes Republican Party of Minn. v. White, 536 U. S. 765,\n\n788 (2002), which stated that a State “having ‘cho[sen] to tap the\nenergy and the legitimizing power of the democratic process, . . . must\naccord the participants in that process the First Amendment rights\nthat attach to their roles.’ ” Ante, at 6. That is correct, but it is not on\npoint. White involved a prohibition on speaking as a condition of\nrunning for judicial office. I do not suggest that a State could require\nlegislators (or the citizen-legislators who participate in a referendum)\nto give up First Amendment rights unconnected with their act of\nlegislating. The electioneering disclosure cases the Court cites, ante, at\n7, are likewise not on point, since they involve disclosure requirements\napplied to political speech, not legislative action.\n  4 The exception for “such Parts as may in their Judgment require\n\nSecrecy” was assuredly not designed to permit anonymous voting. It\nrefers to details whose disclosure would threaten an important national\ninterest. The similar clause in the Articles of Confederation created an\nexception to the journal requirement for parts of the proceedings\n“relating to treaties, alliances or military operations, as in [Congress’s]\njudgment require secresy.” Art. IX. The Constitution’s requirement is\nbroader, but its object is obviously the same.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ntions enacted around the time of the founding had similar\nprovisions. See, e.g., Ky. Const., Art. I, §20 (1792); Ga.\nConst., Art. I, §15 (1798). The desirability of public ac\ncountability was obvious. “[A]s to the votes of representa\ntives and senators in Congress, no man has yet been bold\nenough to vindicate a secret or ballot vote, as either more\nsafe or more wise, more promotive of independence in the\nmembers, or more beneficial to their constituents.” 1 J.\nStory, Commentaries on the Constitution §841, p. 591\n(4th ed. 1873).\n   Moreover, even when the people asked Congress for\nlegislative changes—by exercising their constitutional\nright “to petition the Government for a redress of griev\nances,” U. S. Const., Amdt. 1—they did so publicly. The\npetition was read aloud in Congress. Mazzone, Freedom’s\nAssociations, 77 Wash. L. Rev. 639, 726 (2002). The peti\ntioner’s name (when large groups were not involved), his\nrequest, and what action Congress had taken on the peti\ntion were consistently recorded in the House and Senate\nJournals. See, e.g., Journal of the Senate, June 18, 1790,\n1st Cong., 1st Sess., 163; Journal of the House of Repre\nsentatives, Nov. 24, 1820, 16th Cong., 2d Sess., 32. Even\nwhen the people exercised legislative power directly, they\ndid so not anonymously, but openly in town hall meetings.\nSee generally J. Zimmerman, The New England Town\nMeeting (1999).\n   Petitioning the government and participating in the\ntraditional town meeting were precursors of the modern\ninitiative and referendum. Those innovations were mod\neled after similar devices used by the Swiss democracy in\nthe 1800’s, and were first used in the United States by\nSouth Dakota in 1898. See S. Piott, Giving Voters a Voice\n1–3, 16 (2003). The most influential advocate of the initia\ntive and referendum in the United States analogized the\nSwiss practice to the town meeting, because both “re\nquired open conduct of political affairs and free expression\n6                       DOE v. REED\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nof opinions.” Id., at 5 (discussing J. W. Sullivan, Direct\nLegislation by the Citizenship through the Initiative and\nReferendum (1892)). Plaintiffs’ argument implies that the\npublic nature of these practices, so longstanding and\nunquestioned, violated the freedom of speech. There is no\nhistorical support for such a claim.\n                            B\n  Legislating was not the only governmental act that was\npublic in America. Voting was public until 1888 when the\nStates began to adopt the Australian secret ballot. See\nBurson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 203 (1992) (plurality\nopinion). We have acknowledged the existence of a First\nAmendment interest in voting, see, e.g., Burdick v. Taku\nshi, 504 U. S. 428 (1992), but we have never said that it\nincludes the right to vote anonymously. The history of\nvoting in the United States completely undermines that\nclaim.\n  Initially, the Colonies mostly continued the English\ntraditions of voting by a show of hands or by voice—viva\nvoce voting. Burson, supra, at 200; E. Evans, A History of\nthe Australian Ballot System in the United States 1–6\n(1917) (Evans). One scholar described the viva voce sys\ntem as follows:\n    “ ‘The election judges, who were magistrates, sat upon\n    a bench with their clerks before them. Where practi\n    cable, it was customary for the candidates to be pre\n    sent in person, and to occupy a seat at the side of the\n    judges. As the voter appeared, his name was called\n    out in a loud voice. The judges inquired, “John Jones\n    (or Smith), for whom do you vote?”—for governor, or\n    whatever was the office to be filled. He replied by\n    proclaiming the name of his favorite. Then the clerks\n    enrolled the vote, and the judges announced it as en\n    rolled. The representative of the candidate for whom\n    he voted arose, bowed, and thanked him aloud; and\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n    his partisans often applauded.’ ” Id., at 5 (quoting\n    J. Wise, The End of An Era 55–56 (1899)).\nSee also R. Dinkin, A Study of Elections in the Original\nThirteen States, 1776–1789, p. 101 (1982) (Dinkin).\n  Although there was variation, the election official would\nordinarily compile a poll with the name and residence of\neach voter, and the name of the candidate for whom he\nvoted. See C. Bishop, History of Elections in the American\nColonies 160–64 (1893) (Bishop); P. Argersinger, Struc\nture, Process, and Party: Essays in American Political\nHistory 47 (1992) (Argersinger). To prevent fraud, the\nColonies in Rhode Island, New York, and New Jersey\nadopted the English rule that “copies of the poll must be\ndelivered on demand to persons who were willing to pay a\nreasonable charge for the labor of writing them.” Bishop\n186. Some colonies allowed candidates to demand a copy\nof the poll, ibid., and required the legislature to examine\nthe poll in a contested election, id., at 188–189. Thus, as\nin this case, the government not only publicly collected\nidentifying information about who voted and for which\ncandidate, it also disclosed that information to the public.\n  Any suggestion that viva voce voting infringed the ac\ncepted understanding of the pre-existing freedom of\nspeech to which the First Amendment’s text refers is\nrefuted by the fact that several state constitutions that\nrequired or authorized viva voce voting also explicitly\nguaranteed the freedom of speech. See, e.g., Ky. Const.,\nArt. X, §7, Art. VI, §16 (1799); Ill. Const., Art. VIII, §22,\nArt. I, §28 (1818). Surely one constitutional provision did\nnot render the other invalid.\n  Of course the practice of viva voce voting was gradually\nreplaced with the paper ballot, which was thought to\nreduce fraud and undue influence. See Evans 1–6; Dinkin\n101–106. There is no indication that the shift resulted\nfrom a sudden realization that public voting infringed\n8                       DOE v. REED\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nvoters’ freedom of speech, and the manner in which it\noccurred suggests the contrary. States adopted the paper\nballot at different times, and some States changed meth\nods multiple times. New York’s 1777 Constitution, for\nexample, explicitly provided for the State to switch be\ntween methods. Art. VI. Kentucky’s 1792 Constitution\nrequired paper ballots, Art. III, §2, but its 1799 Constitu\ntion required viva voce voting, Art. VI, §16. The different\nvoting methods simply reflected different views about how\ndemocracy should function. One scholar described Vir\nginia’s and Kentucky’s steadfast use of viva voce voting\nthrough the Civil War as follows: “[I]n the appeal to un\nflinching manliness at the polls these two states insisted\nstill that every voter should show at the hustings the\ncourage of his personal conviction.” Schouler, Evolution of\nthe American Voter, 2 The American Historical Review\n665, 671 (1897). See also id., at 666–667 (“In Virginia and\nthe other states in close affiliation with her this oral ex\npression was vaunted as the privilege of the free-born\nvoter, to show the faith that was in him by an outspoken\nannouncement of his candidate”).\n   The new paper ballots did not make voting anonymous.\nSee Evans 10 (“[T]he ballot was not secret”); Argersinger\n48 (“Certainly there were no legal provisions to ensure\nsecrecy”). Initially, many States did not regulate the form\nof the paper ballot. See Evans 10; Argersinger 48–49.\nTaking advantage of this, political parties began printing\nballots with their candidates’ names on them. They used\nbrightly colored paper and other distinctive markings so\nthat the ballots could be recognized from a distance, mak\ning the votes public. See Burson, supra, at 200–201;\nEvans 10–11. Abuse of these unofficial paper ballots was\nrampant. The polling place had become an “open auction\nplace” where votes could be freely bought or coerced.\nBurson, supra, at 202. Employers threatened employees.\nParty workers kept voters from the other party away from\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe ballot box. Ballot peddlers paid voters and then\nwatched them place the ballot in the box. See L. Fredman,\nThe Australian Ballot: The Story of an American Reform\n22–29 (1968); Argersinger 48–50. Thus, although some\nstate courts said that voting by ballot was meant to be\nmore secret than the public act of viva voce voting; and\nalthough some state constitutional requirements of ballot\nvoting were held to guarantee ballot secrecy, thus prohib\niting the numbering of ballots for voter identification\npurposes, see Williams v. Stein, 38 Ind. 89 (1871); Brisbin\nv. Cleary, 26 Minn. 107, 1 N. W. 825 (1879); in general,\nvoting by ballot was by no means secret. Most important\nof all for present purposes, I am aware of no assertion of\nballot secrecy that relied on federal or state constitutional\nguarantees of freedom of speech.\n   It was precisely discontent over the nonsecret nature of\nballot voting, and the abuses that produced, which led to\nthe States’ adoption of the Australian secret ballot. New\nYork and Massachusetts began that movement in 1888,\nand almost 90 percent of the States had followed suit by\n1896. Burson, 504 U. S., at 203–205. But I am aware of\nno contention that the Australian system was required by\nthe First Amendment (or the state counterparts). That\nwould have been utterly implausible, since the inhabitants\nof the Colonies, the States, and the United States had\nfound public voting entirely compatible with “the freedom\nof speech” for several centuries.\n                          *    *     *\n   The long history of public legislating and voting contra\ndicts plaintiffs’ claim that disclosure of petition signatures\nhaving legislative effect violates the First Amendment. As\nI said in McIntyre, “[w]here the meaning of a constitu\ntional text (such as ‘the freedom of speech’) is unclear, the\nwidespread and long-accepted practices of the American\npeople are the best indication of what fundamental beliefs\n10                      DOE v. REED\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nit was intended to enshrine.” 514 U. S., at 378 (dissenting\nopinion). Just as the century-old practice of States’ pro\nhibiting anonymous electioneering was sufficient for me to\nreject the First Amendment claim to anonymity in McIn\ntyre, the many-centuries-old practices of public legislating\nand voting are sufficient for me to reject plaintiffs’ claim.\n   Plaintiffs raise concerns that the disclosure of petition\nsignatures may lead to threats and intimidation. Of\ncourse nothing prevents the people of Washington from\nkeeping petition signatures secret to avoid that—just as\nnothing prevented the States from moving to the secret\nballot. But there is no constitutional basis for this Court\nto impose that course upon the States—or to insist (as\ntoday’s opinion does) that it can only be avoided by the\ndemonstration of a “sufficiently important governmental\ninterest,” ante, at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAnd it may even be a bad idea to keep petition signatures\nsecret. There are laws against threats and intimidation;\nand harsh criticism, short of unlawful action, is a price our\npeople have traditionally been willing to pay for self\ngovernance. Requiring people to stand up in public for\ntheir political acts fosters civic courage, without which\ndemocracy is doomed. For my part, I do not look forward\nto a society which, thanks to the Supreme Court, cam\npaigns anonymously (McIntyre) and even exercises the\ndirect democracy of initiative and referendum hidden from\npublic scrutiny and protected from the accountability of\ncriticism. This does not resemble the Home of the Brave.\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Given those burdens, I would hold\nthat Washington’s decision to subject all referendum\npetitions to public disclosure is unconstitutional because\nthere will always be a less restrictive means by which\nWashington can vindicate its stated interest in preserving\nthe integrity of its referendum process. I respectfully\ndissent.\n\n\n——————\n  1 Generally speaking, in a referendum, voters approve or reject an Act\n\nalready passed by the legislature. In an initiative, voters adopt or\nreject an entirely new law, either a statute or a constitutional amend\nment. See T. Cronin, Direct Democracy: The Politics of Initiative,\nReferendum, and Recall 2 (1989).\n2                       DOE v. REED\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n                              I\n   This case concerns the interaction of two distinct sets of\nWashington statutes. The first set, codified in Washing\nton’s Election Code, regulates the referendum and initia\ntive process. These statutes require, among other things,\nthat referendum signers write their names and addresses\non petition sheets, and mandate that this information\nbe disclosed to Washington’s secretary of state for canvass\ning and verification. See, e.g., §§29A.72.130, 29A.72.230\n(2008). Petitioners do not contend that these require\nments violate their First Amendment rights; that is, they\ndo not argue that the Constitution allows them to support\na referendum measure without disclosing their names to\nthe State.\n   The second set of statutes—the PRA—is not a referen\ndum or election regulation. Rather, the PRA requires\ndisclosure of all nonexempt “public records” upon request\nby any person. See §§42.56.010(2), 42.56.070. Washing\nton has concluded that signed referendum petitions are\n“public records” subject to disclosure under the PRA, and\nhas “routinely disclosed petitions in response to public\nrecords requests.” Brief for Respondent Reed 5–6.\n   Petitioners do not challenge the constitutionality of the\nPRA generally. They contend only that Washington vio\nlates their First Amendment rights by construing the PRA\nto apply to signed referendum petitions. See Brief for\nPetitioners 35–39. As the Court notes, the parties dispute\nwhether this challenge is best conceived as a facial chal\nlenge or an as-applied challenge. See ante, at 5. In my\nview, the Court correctly concludes that petitioners must\n“satisfy our standards for a facial challenge” because their\nclaim, and the relief that they seek, “reach beyond” their\n“particular circumstances.” Ibid.\n   We typically disfavor facial challenges. See Washington\nState Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552\nU. S. 442, 449 (2008). They “often rest on speculation,”\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncan lead courts unnecessarily to anticipate constitutional\nquestions or formulate broad constitutional rules, and may\nprevent governmental officers from implementing laws “in\na manner consistent with the Constitution.” Id., at 450–\n451. For those reasons, we rejected in Washington State\nGrange political parties’ pre-enforcement facial challenge\nto a Washington initiative that allowed candidates in a\nprimary election to self-designate their political party\npreference on the primary election ballot. See id., at 458–\n459. Because the challenge was a pre-enforcement one,\nWashington “had no opportunity to implement” the initia\ntive, id., at 450, so the political parties’ arguments that it\nviolated their association rights all depended “on the\npossibility that voters will be confused as to the meaning\nof the party-preference designation,” id., at 454. More\nover, a facial challenge was inappropriate because the\nregulation did “not on its face impose a severe burden on\npolitical parties’ associational rights.” Id., at 444.\n   Those considerations point in the opposite direction\nhere. Washington’s construction of the PRA “on its face\nimpose[s] a severe burden,” ibid.—compelled disclosure of\nprivacy in political association protected by the First\nAmendment, see infra, at 4–5—on all referendum signers.\nAnd Washington has had several “opportunit[ies] to im\nplement” the PRA’s disclosure requirements with respect\nto initiative petitions. Washington State Grange, supra, at\n450. Indeed, Washington admits that “[a]ll petitions for\ninitiatives, referendum, recall, and candidate nomination\nare public records subject to disclosure.” Brief for Respon\ndent Reed 59; see also App. 26 (listing six completed re\nquests for disclosure of signed initiative petitions since\n2006). Washington thus has eliminated any “possibility”\nthat referendum petition signers “will be confused as to”\nhow the State will respond to a request under the PRA to\ndisclose their names and addresses. Washington State\nGrange, 552 U. S., at 454.\n4                        DOE v. REED\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n  Accordingly, I would consider petitioners’ facial chal\nlenge here. For purposes of this case, I will assume that to\nprevail, petitioners must satisfy our most rigorous stan\ndard, and show that there is “ ‘no set of circumstances . . .\nunder which the’ ” PRA could be constitutionally applied to\na referendum or initiative petition, “i.e., that the [PRA] is\nunconstitutional in all of its applications,” id., at 449\n(quoting United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745\n(1987)).\n                               II \n\n                               A\n\n   The Court correctly concludes that “an individual ex\npresses” a “political view” by signing a referendum peti\ntion. Ante, at 5. The Court also rightly rejects the base\nless argument that such expressive activity falls “outside\nthe scope of the First Amendment” merely because “it has\nlegal effect in the electoral process.” Ante, at 6. Yet, the\nCourt does not acknowledge the full constitutional impli\ncations of these conclusions.\n   The expressive political activity of signing a referendum\npetition is a paradigmatic example of “the practice of\npersons sharing common views banding together to\nachieve a common end.” Citizens Against Rent Con\ntrol/Coalition for Fair Housing v. Berkeley, 454 U. S. 290,\n294 (1981). A referendum supported by only one person’s\nsignature is a nullity; it will never be placed on the ballot.\nThe Doe petitioners recognized as much when they—and\nmore than 120,000 other Washingtonians, see ante, at 3—\njoined with petitioner Protect Marriage Washington, “a\nstate political action committee” organized under\n§42.17.040, to effect Protect Marriage Washington’s “major\npurpose” of collecting enough valid signatures to place\nReferendum 71 on the general election ballot. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 29a. For these reasons, signing a referendum\npetition amounts to “ ‘political association’ ” protected by\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthe First Amendment. Citizens Against Rent Control,\nsupra, at 295 (quoting Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 15\n(1976) (per curiam)).\n   This Court has long recognized the “vital relationship\nbetween” political association “and privacy in one’s asso\nciations,” NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S.\n449, 462 (1958), and held that “[t]he Constitution protects\nagainst the compelled disclosure of political associations\nand beliefs,” Brown v. Socialist Workers ’74 Campaign\nComm. (Ohio), 459 U. S. 87, 91 (1982). This constitutional\nprotection “yield[s] only to a subordinating interest of the\nState that is compelling, and then only if there is a sub\nstantial relation between the information sought and an\noverriding and compelling state interest.” Id., at 91–92\n(internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omit\nted). Thus, unlike the Court, I read our precedents to\nrequire application of strict scrutiny to laws that compel\ndisclosure of protected First Amendment association.\nBuckley v. American Constitutional Law Foundation, Inc.,\n525 U. S. 182, 206, 212 (1999) (ACLF) (THOMAS, J., con\ncurring in judgment). Under that standard, a disclosure\nrequirement passes constitutional muster only if it is\nnarrowly tailored—i.e., the least restrictive means—to\nserve a compelling state interest. See id., at 206.\n                              B\n  Washington’s application of the PRA to a referendum\npetition does not survive strict scrutiny.\n                              1\n  Washington first contends that it has a compelling\ninterest in “transparency and accountability,” which it\nclaims encompasses several subordinate interests: pre\nserving the integrity of its election process, preventing\ncorruption, deterring fraud, and correcting mistakes by\nthe secretary of state or by petition signers. See Brief for\n6                        DOE v. REED\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nRespondent Reed 40–42; 57–59.\n    It is true that a State has a substantial interest in regu\nlating its referendum and initiative processes “to protect\nthe[ir] integrity and reliability.” ACLF, 525 U. S., at 191.\nBut Washington points to no precedent from this Court\nrecognizing “correcting errors” as a distinct compelling\ninterest that could support disclosure regulations. And\nour cases strongly suggest that preventing corruption and\ndeterring fraud bear less weight in this particular elec\ntoral context: the signature-gathering stage of a referen\ndum or initiative drive. The Court has twice observed that\n“ ‘the risk of fraud or corruption, or the appearance\nthereof, is more remote at the petition stage of an initia\ntive than at the time of balloting.’ ” Id., at 203 (quoting\nMeyer v. Grant, 486 U. S. 414, 427 (1988)). Similarly,\nbecause “[r]eferenda are held on issues, not candidates for\npublic office,” the “risk of corruption perceived in cases\ninvolving candidate elections simply is not present in a\npopular vote on a public issue.” First Nat. Bank of Boston\nv. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 790 (1978) (citations omitted).\n    We should not abandon those principles merely because\nWashington and its amici can point to a mere eight in\nstances of initiative-related fraud, see Brief for Respon\ndent Reed 42; Brief for State of Ohio et al. as Amici Curiae\n22–24, among the 809 initiative measures placed on\nstate ballots in this country between 1988 and 2008,\nsee Initiative and Referendum Institute, Initiative Use\n2 (Feb. 2009), online at http://www.iandrinstitute.org/\nIRI%20Initiative%20Use%20(1904-2008).pdf (as visited\nJune 21, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).\nIf anything, these meager figures reinforce the conclusion\nthat the risks of fraud or corruption in the initiative and\nreferendum process are remote and thereby undermine\nWashington’s claim that those two interests should be\nconsidered compelling for purposes of strict scrutiny.\n    Thus, I am not persuaded that Washington’s interest in\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nprotecting the integrity and reliability of its referendum\nprocess, as the State has defined that interest, is compel\nling. But I need not answer that question here. Even\nassuming the interest is compelling, on-demand disclosure\nof a referendum petition to any person under the PRA is “a\nblunderbuss approach” to furthering that interest, Colo\nrado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal\nElection Comm’n, 518 U. S. 604, 642 (1996) (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring in judgment and dissenting in part) (internal\nquotation marks omitted), not the least restrictive means\nof doing so. The events that prompted petitioners’ com\nplaint in this case demonstrate as much.\n   As Washington explained during oral argument, after\nthe secretary of state receives signed referendum peti\ntions, his “first step . . . is to take them to his archiving\nsection and to have them digitized. As soon as they’re\ndigitized, they’re available on disks for anyone who re\nquests them” under the PRA. Tr. of Oral Arg. 30. In this\ncase, two organizations announced their intention to\nobtain the digitized names and addresses of referendum\nsigners and post them “online, in a searchable format.”\nAnte, at 3.\n   There is no apparent reason why Washington must\nbroadly disclose referendum signers’ names and addresses\nin this manner to vindicate the interest that it invokes\nhere. Washington—which is in possession of that infor\nmation because of referendum regulations that petitioners\ndo not challenge, see supra, at 2—could put the names and\naddresses of referendum signers into a similar electronic\ndatabase that state employees could search without sub\njecting the name and address of each signer to wholesale\npublic disclosure. The secretary could electronically cross\nreference the referendum database against the “statewide\nvoter registration list” contained in Washington’s “state\n8                            DOE v. REED\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nwide voter registration database,” §29A.08.651(1),2 to\nensure that each referendum signer meets Washington’s\nresidency and voter registration requirements, see\n§29A.72.130. Doing so presumably would drastically\nreduce or eliminate possible errors or mistakes that Wash\nington argues the secretary might make, see Brief for\nRespondent Reed 42, since it would allow the secretary to\nverify virtually all of the signatures instead of the mere “3\nto 5%” he “ordinarily checks,” ante, at 9 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted).3\n   An electronic referendum database would also enable\nthe secretary to determine whether multiple entries corre\nspond to a single registered voter, thereby detecting\nwhether a voter had signed the petition more than once.\nIn addition, the database would protect victims of “for\ngery” or “ ‘bait and switch’ fraud.” Ibid. In Washington, “a\nunique identifier is assigned to each legally registered\nvoter in the state.” §29A.08.651(4). Washington could\ncreate a Web site, linked to the electronic referendum\ndatabase, where a voter concerned that his name had been\nfraudulently signed could conduct a search using his\nunique identifier to ensure that his name was absent from\nthe database—without requiring disclosure of the names\nand addresses of all the voluntary, legitimate signers.\n   Washington admits that creating this sort of electronic\nreferendum database “could be done.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 51.\nImplementing such a system would not place a heavy\nburden on Washington; “the Secretary of State’s staff”\n——————\n    2 UnderWashington law, this “computerized list must serve as the\nsingle system for storing and maintaining the official list of registered\nvoters throughout the state” and “must contain the name and registra\ntion information of every legally registered voter in the state.” Wash.\nRev. Code §§29A.08.651(2)–(3) (2008).\n   3 See §29A.72.230 (permitting the secretary of state to verify and\n\ncanvass referendum petitions using approved statistical sampling\nmethods).\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   But Washington’s Election Code already gives Washing\nton voters access to referendum petition data. Under\n§29A.72.230, “[t]he verification and canvass of signatures\non the [referendum] petition may be observed by persons\nrepresenting the advocates and opponents of the proposed\nmeasure so long as they make no record of the names,\naddresses, or other information on the petitions or related\nrecords except upon” court order. Each side is entitled to\nat least two such observers, although the secretary may\nincrease that number if, in his opinion, doing so would not\n“cause undue delay or disruption of the verification proc\ness.” Ibid.\n   Washington does not explain why this existing access,\nwhich petitioners do not challenge here, is insufficient to\npermit its citizens to oversee the verification process un\nder §29A.72.230, or to decide intelligently whether to\npursue a court challenge under §29A.72.240. Moreover, if\nWashington had implemented the more narrowly tailored\nelectronic referendum database discussed above, observers\ncould see the secretary of state’s employees examine the\ndata using exactly the same techniques they would use if\nthe data were released to them under the PRA. Obtaining\na digitized list to navigate on their own computer would\nnot allow an observer to learn any additional information.\n   Washington law also contains several other measures\nthat preserve the integrity of the referendum process.\n10                      DOE v. REED\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nFirst, it is a crime in Washington to forge a signature on a\nreferendum petition, or to knowingly sign one more than\nonce. See §29A.84.230. Second, referendum supporters\nmust gather a large number of valid signatures—four\npercent of the votes cast for Governor in the immediately\npreceding gubernatorial election—to place a referendum\npetition on the ballot. §29A.72.150. Third, Washington’s\nrequired referendum petition form limits each petition to a\nsingle subject. See §29A.72.130. Fourth, a large, plain-\nEnglish warning must appear at the top of the referendum\npetition, alerting signers to the law’s requirements. See\n§29A.72.140. Fifth, Washington prescribes the text of the\ndeclaration that a circulator must submit along with the\nsigned petition sheets. See §29A.72.130. Sixth, Washing\nton prescribes verification and canvassing methods. See\n§29A.72.230.\n  The Court’s dismissive treatment of those provisions,\nsee ante, at 9, is perplexing, given the analysis that the\nCourt endorsed in ACLF. There, the Court held that two\ndisclosure requirements governing Colorado’s initiative\nprocess were unconstitutional, see 525 U. S., at 186–187,\nspecifically finding that they were “not warranted by the\nstate interests (administrative efficiency, fraud detection,\ninforming voters) alleged to justify” them, and emphasiz\ning that its “judgment [wa]s informed by other means\nColorado employs to accomplish its regulatory purposes.”\nId., at 192. The entire last section of the Court’s opinion\ndetailed those “less problematic measures” by which Colo\nrado “can and d[id] meet” its “substantial interests in\nregulating the ballot-initiative process.” Id., at 204 (em\nphasis added). With one exception—a law deeming an\ninitiative void if the circulator violated any law applicable\nto the circulation process—those Colorado laws correspond\nexactly to the Washington regulatory requirements listed\nabove. See id., at 205. Including the observer provision,\n§29A.72.230, and the provision permitting court review of\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            11\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthe secretary’s decision to certify (or not to certify) a refer\nendum petition, §29A.72.240, Washington thus appears to\nprovide even more of the “less problematic measures” than\nColorado did to “protect the integrity of the initiative\nprocess,” ACLF, supra, at 204, and I see no reason why\nWashington’s identical provisions should not “inform” the\nanalysis here.\n  It is readily apparent that Washington can vindicate its\nstated interest in “transparency and accountability”\nthrough a number of more narrowly tailored means than\nwholesale public disclosure. Accordingly, this interest\ncannot justify applying the PRA to a referendum petition.\n                             2\n  Washington also contends that it has a compelling\ninterest in “providing relevant information to Washington\nvoters,” and that on-demand disclosure to the public is a\nnarrowly tailored means of furthering that interest. Brief\nfor Respondent Reed 44. This argument is easily dis\npatched, since this Court has already rejected it in a simi\nlar context.\n  In McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 514 U. S. 334\n(1995), the Court held that an Ohio law prohibiting\nanonymous political pamphleting violated the First\nAmendment. One of the interests Ohio had invoked to\njustify that law was identical to Washington’s here: the\n“interest in providing the electorate with relevant infor\nmation.” Id., at 348. The Court called that interest\n“plainly insufficient to support the constitutionality of\n[Ohio’s] disclosure requirement.” Id., at 349. “The simple\ninterest in providing voters with additional relevant in\nformation does not justify a state requirement that a\nwriter make statements or disclosures she would other\nwise omit.” Id., at 348. “Don’t underestimate the common\nman,” we advised. Id., at 348, n. 11 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n12                      DOE v. REED\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n     “People are intelligent enough to evaluate the source\n     of an anonymous writing. They can see it is anony\n     mous. They know it is anonymous. They can evalu\n     ate its anonymity along with its message. . . . And\n     then, once they have done so, it is for them to decide\n     what is ‘responsible,’ what is valuable, and what is\n     truth.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nSee also Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 777 (“The inherent worth of\nthe speech in terms of its capacity for informing the public\ndoes not depend upon the identity of its source”).\n   This observation applies equally to referendum meas\nures. People are intelligent enough to evaluate the merits\nof a referendum without knowing who supported it. Thus,\njust as this informational interest did not justify the Ohio\nlaw in McIntyre, it does not justify applying the PRA to\nreferendum petitions.\n                              C\n  The foregoing analysis applies in every case involving\ndisclosure of a referendum measure’s supporters, as it\nmust for petitioners’ facial challenge to succeed. See\nWashington State Grange, 552 U. S., at 449 (quoting\nSalerno, 481 U. S., at 745). Washington does not argue\nthat the strength of its transparency and accountability\ninterest rises or falls based on the topic of a referendum.\nNor would such an argument be convincing. We have no\nbasis to assume that Washington’s interest in maintaining\nthe integrity of its referendum process is high for a char\nter-school referendum but low for an unemployment in\nsurance referendum, or that a library or land-use referen\ndum is more likely to be a target of fraud or corruption\nthan a referendum on insurance coverage and benefits.\nSee ante, at 11–12. The strength of Washington’s interest\nremains constant across all types of referendum measures.\n  So too does the strength of a signer’s First Amendment\ninterest. The First Amendment rights at issue here are\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nassociational rights, and a long, unbroken line of this\nCourt’s precedents holds that privacy of association is\nprotected under the First Amendment. See supra, at 4–5.\nThe loss of associational privacy that comes with disclos\ning referendum petitions to the general public under the\nPRA constitutes the same harm as to each signer of each\nreferendum, regardless of the topic. To be sure, a referen\ndum signer may be more willing to disclose to the general\npublic his political association with persons signing cer\ntain referendum measures than his association with oth\ners. But that choice belongs to the voter; the State may\nnot make it for him by ascribing a lower level of First\nAmendment protection to an associational interest that\nsome think a voter may be (or should be) more willing to\ndisclose. Cf. Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of\nVa., 515 U. S. 819, 828 (1995) (“In the realm of private\nspeech or expression, government regulation may not\nfavor one speaker over another”).\n  Finally, the less restrictive means available to vindicate\nWashington’s transparency and accountability interest\ncan be employed for all referendum measures, regardless\nof topic. There is nothing measure-specific about an elec\ntronic database or additional observers. And the forgery\nprohibition and other existing requirements in Washing\nton law that help “protect the integrity of the initiative\nprocess,” ACLF, 525 U. S., at 204, apply equally to all\nreferendum measures.\n  Because the strength of Washington’s interest in trans\nparency and a signer’s individual First Amendment inter\nest in privacy of political association remain constant\nacross all referendum topics, and because less restrictive\nmeans to protect the integrity of the referendum process\nare not topic specific, I would hold that on-demand public\ndisclosure of referendum petitions under the PRA is not\nnarrowly tailored for any referendum.\n14                       DOE v. REED\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n                             III\n  Significant practical problems will result from requiring\nas-applied challenges to protect referendum signers’ con\nstitutional rights.\n                              A\n   The Court’s approach will “require substantial litigation\nover an extended time” before a potential signer of any\nreferendum will learn whether, if he signs a referendum,\nhis associational privacy right will remain intact. Citizens\nUnited v. Federal Election Comm’n, 558 U. S. ___, ___\n(2010) (slip op., at 9). And the tenacious litigant’s reward\nfor trying to protect his First Amendment rights? An\n“interpretive process [that] itself would create an inevita\nble, pervasive, and serious risk of chilling protected speech\npending the drawing of fine distinctions that, in the end,\nwould themselves be questionable.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n9–10). The large number of such fine and questionable\ndistinctions in these types of cases reinforces my view that\nas-applied challenges provide no more than “a hollow\nassurance” that referendum signers’ First Amendment\nrights will be protected. Id., at __ (slip op., at 5) (THOMAS,\nJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Consider\njust a few examples.\n   In Washington, a referendum sponsor must file the\nproposed referendum with the secretary of state before\ncollecting signatures. See §29A.72.010. May the sponsor\nseek an injunction against disclosure through an as\napplied challenge before filing the proposed measure, or\nsimultaneously with its filing?          Because signature\ngathering will not have started, the sponsor will not be\nable to present any evidence specific to signers or potential\nsigners of that particular referendum showing “a reason\nable probability that the compelled disclosure [of personal\ninformation] will subject them to threats, harassment, or\nreprisals from either Government officials or private\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

The Court has never held that\nsuch evidence would be acceptable; but if it is, that neces\nsarily means that some signers, at some point, will have\nsuffered actual “threats, harassment, and reprisals” for\nengaging in protected First Amendment activity.\n   If the sponsor must wait at least until signature\ngathering has started on his referendum to file an as\napplied challenge, it is still unclear what sort of evidence\nof “threats, harassment, or reprisals” directed toward his\nsupporters would satisfy the Court’s standard. How many\ninstances of “threats, harassment or reprisals” must a\nsigner endure before a court may grant relief on an as\napplied challenge? And how dispersed throughout the\ngroup of the necessary 120,000 signers, see ante, at 3,\nmust these threats be?\n   More importantly, the Court’s standard does not appear\nto require actual “threats, harassment, or reprisals,” but\nmerely a “ ‘reasonable probability’ ” that disclosure of the\nsigners’ names and addresses will lead to such activity.\nAnte, at 11 (emphasis added). What sort of evidence suf\nfices to satisfy this apparently more relaxed, though per\nhaps more elusive, standard? Does one instance of actual\nharassment directed toward one signer mean that the\n“reasonable probability” requirement is met? And again,\nhow widespread must this “reasonable probability” be?\nThe Court does not answer any of these questions, leaving\na vacuum to be filled on a case-by-case basis. This will, no\ndoubt, result in the “drawing of” arbitrary and “question\nable” “fine distinctions” by even the most well-intentioned\ndistrict or circuit judge. Citizens United, 558 U.

Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6)\n(opinion of THOMAS, J.). “Thus, ‘disclosure permits citi\nzens . . . to react to the speech of [their political opponents]\nin a proper’—or undeniably improper—‘way’ long before a\nplaintiff could prevail on an as-applied challenge.” Ibid.\n   The Court apparently disagrees, asserting that “there is\nno reason to assume that any burdens imposed by disclo\nsure of typical referendum petitions would be remotely\nlike the burdens plaintiffs fear in this case.” Ante, at 12.\nThat conclusion rests on the premise that some referen\ndum measures are so benign that the fact of public dis\nclosure will not chill protected First Amendment activity.\nI am not convinced that this premise is correct.\n   The historical evidence shows that the referendum and\ninitiative process first gained popularity as a means of\n“provid[ing] an occasional safety valve for interests that\nfailed to get a fair hearing in the legislatures.” T. Cronin,\nDirect Democracy: The Politics of Initiative, Referendum,\nand Recall 59 (1989). Unsurprisingly, such interests\ntended to be controversial by nature. Early examples\ninclude “the single tax, prohibition, women’s suffrage,\nprolabor legislation, and the graduated income tax.” Id.,\nat 58. And proponents of initiative measures tended to\ninclude politically marginalized groups such as the\n“Farmer’s Alliance” in rural states; “[t]housands of labor\nfederations, notably the miners”; and “the Women’s Suf\nfrage Association,” which “saw the initiative and referen\ndum as a possible new means to overcome” repeated failed\nattempts in state legislatures to secure for women the\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

Consider, for example, the goal of\nincreasing ethics in government—a seemingly laudable\nand unobjectionable goal. So thought some citizens of\nUtah, who, frustrated with the state legislature’s failure to\npass ethics laws commensurate with their preferences,\nfiled a “21-page initiative target[ing] legislative conduct\nwith a broad array of reforms that would significantly\nchange how business gets done on Utah’s Capitol Hill.”\nMcKitrick, Suit Demands Secrecy for Ethics Petition\nSigners, Salt Lake Tribune, Apr. 15, 2010, p. A4 (hereinaf\nter Salt Lake Tribune). But Utah law provides that\n“[i]nitiative packets,” which contain the names and ad\ndresses (and, in some cases, birthdates) of petition signers,\n“are public once they are delivered to the county clerks”\nfor verification and canvassing. Utah Code Ann. §20A–7–\n206(7) (2009 Lexis Supp. Pamphlet).\n   The attorneys sponsoring that initiative moved for an\ninjunction to prevent disclosure of the initiative packets\nunder §20A–7–206(7) because, they claimed, “ ‘[t]he [state]\nRepublican Party has said it will target our folks.’ ” Salt\nLake Tribune, at A4. According to these attorneys, a\nfacially benign initiative may well result in political retri\nbution and retaliation in a State where Republicans cur\nrently hold the offices of Governor, Lieutenant Governor,\nattorney general, state treasurer, state auditor, and a\nsupermajority in both the Utah House of Representatives\n(71%) and the Utah Senate (72%), see State Yellow Book:\nWho’s Who in the Executive and Legislative Branches of\nthe 50 State Governments 650–651, 1292–1294 (Spring\n2010), as well as four of the five seats in the State’s dele\ngation to the United States Congress, see GPO, 2009–2010\nOfficial Congressional Directory, 111th Cong., pp. 299, 307\n(2009).\n   The difficulty in predicting which referendum measures\n18                            DOE v.
