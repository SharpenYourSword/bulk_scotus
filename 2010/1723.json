KENTUCKY\n\n      CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF KENTUCKY\n\n    No. 08–651.      Argued October 13, 2009—Decided March 31, 2010\nPetitioner Padilla, a lawful permanent resident of the United States for\n  over 40 years, faces deportation after pleading guilty to drug\n  distribution charges in Kentucky. In postconviction proceedings, he\n  claims that his counsel not only failed to advise him of this conse\n  quence before he entered the plea, but also told him not to worry\n  about deportation since he had lived in this country so long. He al\n  leges that he would have gone to trial had he not received this incor\n  rect advice. The Kentucky Supreme Court denied Padilla postconvic\n  tion relief on the ground that the Sixth Amendment’s effective\n  assistance-of-counsel guarantee does not protect defendants from er\n  roneous deportation advice because deportation is merely a “collat\n  eral” consequence of a conviction.\nHeld: Because counsel must inform a client whether his plea carries a\n risk of deportation, Padilla has sufficiently alleged that his counsel\n was constitutionally deficient. Whether he is entitled to relief de\n pends on whether he has been prejudiced, a matter not addressed\n here. Pp. 2–18.\n    (a) Changes to immigration law have dramatically raised the\n stakes of a noncitizen’s criminal conviction. While once there was\n only a narrow class of deportable offenses and judges wielded broad\n discretionary authority to prevent deportation, immigration reforms\n have expanded the class of deportable offenses and limited judges’\n authority to alleviate deportation’s harsh consequences. Because the\n drastic measure of deportation or removal is now virtually inevitable\n for a vast number of noncitizens convicted of crimes, the importance\n of accurate legal advice for noncitizens accused of crimes has never\n been more important. Thus, as a matter of federal law, deportation is\n an integral part of the penalty that may be imposed on noncitizen de\n fendants who plead guilty to specified crimes. Pp. 2–6.\n2                         PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n       (b) Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, applies to Padilla’s\n    claim. Before deciding whether to plead guilty, a defendant is enti\n    tled to “the effective assistance of competent counsel.” McMann v.\n    Richardson, 397 U. S. 759, 771. The Supreme Court of Kentucky re\n    jected Padilla’s ineffectiveness claim on the ground that the advice he\n    sought about deportation concerned only collateral matters. How\n    ever, this Court has never distinguished between direct and collat\n    eral consequences in defining the scope of constitutionally “reason\n    able professional assistance” required under Strickland, 466 U. S., at\n    689. The question whether that distinction is appropriate need not\n    be considered in this case because of the unique nature of deporta\n    tion. Although removal proceedings are civil, deportation is inti\n    mately related to the criminal process, which makes it uniquely diffi\n    cult to classify as either a direct or a collateral consequence. Because\n    that distinction is thus ill-suited to evaluating a Strickland claim\n    concerning the specific risk of deportation, advice regarding deporta\n    tion is not categorically removed from the ambit of the Sixth Amend\n    ment right to counsel. Pp. 7–9.\n       (c) To satisfy Strickland’s two-prong inquiry, counsel’s representa\n    tion must fall “below an objective standard of reasonableness,” 466\n    U. S., at 688, and there must be “a reasonable probability that, but\n    for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would\n    have been different,” id., at 694. The first, constitutional deficiency,\n    is necessarily linked to the legal community’s practice and expecta\n    tions. Id., at 688. The weight of prevailing professional norms sup\n    ports the view that counsel must advise her client regarding the de\n    portation risk. And this Court has recognized the importance to the\n    client of “ ‘[p]reserving the . . . right to remain in the United States’ ”\n    and “preserving the possibility of” discretionary relief from deporta\n    tion. INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 323. Thus, this is not a hard case\n    in which to find deficiency: The consequences of Padilla’s plea could\n    easily be determined from reading the removal statute, his deporta\n    tion was presumptively mandatory, and his counsel’s advice was in\n    correct. There will, however, undoubtedly be numerous situations in\n    which the deportation consequences of a plea are unclear. In those\n    cases, a criminal defense attorney need do no more than advise a\n    noncitizen client that pending criminal charges may carry adverse\n    immigration consequences. But when the deportation consequence is\n    truly clear, as it was here, the duty to give correct advice is equally\n    clear. Accepting Padilla’s allegations as true, he has sufficiently al\n    leged constitutional deficiency to satisfy Strickland’s first prong.\n    Whether he can satisfy the second prong, prejudice, is left for the\n    Kentucky courts to consider in the first instance. Pp. 9–12.\n       (d) The Solicitor General’s proposed rule—that Strickland should\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  be applied to Padilla’s claim only to the extent that he has alleged af\n  firmative misadvice—is unpersuasive. And though this Court must\n  be careful about recognizing new grounds for attacking the validity of\n  guilty pleas, the 25 years since Strickland was first applied to inef\n  fective-assistance claims at the plea stage have shown that pleas are\n  less frequently the subject of collateral challenges than convictions\n  after a trial. Also, informed consideration of possible deportation can\n  benefit both the State and noncitizen defendants, who may be able to\n  reach agreements that better satisfy the interests of both parties.\n  This decision will not open the floodgates to challenges of convictions\n  obtained through plea bargains.

KENTUCKY\n     ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                       KENTUCKY\n\n                                 [March 31, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Petitioner Jose Padilla, a native of Honduras, has been\na lawful permanent resident of the United States for more\nthan 40 years. Padilla served this Nation with honor as a\nmember of the U. S. Armed Forces during the Vietnam\nWar. He now faces deportation after pleading guilty to the\ntransportation of a large amount of marijuana in his\ntractor-trailer in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.1\n   In this postconviction proceeding, Padilla claims that his\ncounsel not only failed to advise him of this consequence\nprior to his entering the plea, but also told him that he\n“ ‘did not have to worry about immigration status since he\nhad been in the country so long.’ ” 253 S. W. 3d 482, 483\n(Ky. 2008). Padilla relied on his counsel’s erroneous ad\nvice when he pleaded guilty to the drug charges that made\nhis deportation virtually mandatory. He alleges that he\nwould have insisted on going to trial if he had not received\nincorrect advice from his attorney.\n   Assuming the truth of his allegations, the Supreme\n——————\n  1 Padilla’s crime, like virtually every drug offense except for only the\n\nmost insignificant marijuana offenses, is a deportable offense under 8\nU. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(B)(i).\n2                  PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt of Kentucky denied Padilla postconviction relief\nwithout the benefit of an evidentiary hearing. The court\nheld that the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee of effective\nassistance of counsel does not protect a criminal defendant\nfrom erroneous advice about deportation because it is\nmerely a “collateral” consequence of his conviction. Id., at\n485. In its view, neither counsel’s failure to advise peti\ntioner about the possibility of removal, nor counsel’s incor\nrect advice, could provide a basis for relief.\n   We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009), to decide\nwhether, as a matter of federal law, Padilla’s counsel had\nan obligation to advise him that the offense to which he\nwas pleading guilty would result in his removal from this\ncountry. We agree with Padilla that constitutionally\ncompetent counsel would have advised him that his con\nviction for drug distribution made him subject to auto\nmatic deportation. Whether he is entitled to relief de\npends on whether he has been prejudiced, a matter that\nwe do not address.\n                              I\n   The landscape of federal immigration law has changed\ndramatically over the last 90 years. While once there was\nonly a narrow class of deportable offenses and judges\nwielded broad discretionary authority to prevent deporta\ntion, immigration reforms over time have expanded the\nclass of deportable offenses and limited the authority of\njudges to alleviate the harsh consequences of deportation.\nThe “drastic measure” of deportation or removal, Fong\nHaw Tan v. Phelan, 333 U. S. 6, 10 (1948), is now virtually\ninevitable for a vast number of noncitizens convicted of\ncrimes.\n   The Nation’s first 100 years was “a period of unimpeded\nimmigration.” C. Gordon & H. Rosenfield, Immigration\nLaw and Procedure §1.(2)(a), p. 5 (1959). An early effort to\nempower the President to order the deportation of those\n                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nimmigrants he “judge[d] dangerous to the peace and safety\nof the United States,” Act of June 25, 1798, ch. 58, 1 Stat.\n571, was short lived and unpopular. Gordon §1.2, at 5. It\nwas not until 1875 that Congress first passed a statute\nbarring convicts and prostitutes from entering the coun\ntry, Act of Mar. 3, 1875, ch. 141, 18 Stat. 477. Gordon\n§1.2b, at 6. In 1891, Congress added to the list of exclud\nable persons those “who have been convicted of a felony or\nother infamous crime or misdemeanor involving moral\nturpitude.” Act of Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 551, 26 Stat. 1084.2\n   The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1917 (1917 Act)\nbrought “radical changes” to our law. S. Rep. No. 1515,\n81st Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 54–55 (1950). For the first time\nin our history, Congress made classes of noncitizens de\nportable based on conduct committed on American soil.\nId., at 55. Section 19 of the 1917 Act authorized the de\nportation of “any alien who is hereafter sentenced to im\nprisonment for a term of one year or more because of\nconviction in this country of a crime involving moral turpi\ntude, committed within five years after the entry of the\nalien to the United States . . . .” 39 Stat. 889. And §19\nalso rendered deportable noncitizen recidivists who com\nmit two or more crimes of moral turpitude at any time\nafter entry. Ibid. Congress did not, however, define the\nterm “moral turpitude.”\n   While the 1917 Act was “radical” because it authorized\ndeportation as a consequence of certain convictions, the\nAct also included a critically important procedural protec\ntion to minimize the risk of unjust deportation: At the\ntime of sentencing or within 30 days thereafter, the sen\ntencing judge in both state and federal prosecutions had\nthe power to make a recommendation “that such alien\n——————\n  2 In 1907, Congress expanded the class of excluded persons to include\n\nindividuals who “admit” to having committed a crime of moral turpi\ntude. Act of Feb. 20, 1907, ch. 1134, 34 Stat. 899.\n4                      PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nshall not be deported.” Id., at 890.3 This procedure,\nknown as a judicial recommendation against deportation,\nor JRAD, had the effect of binding the Executive to pre\nvent deportation; the statute was “consistently . . . inter\npreted as giving the sentencing judge conclusive authority\nto decide whether a particular conviction should be disre\ngarded as a basis for deportation,” Janvier v. United\nStates, 793 F. 2d 449, 452 (CA2 1986). Thus, from 1917\nforward, there was no such creature as an automatically\ndeportable offense. Even as the class of deportable of\nfenses expanded, judges retained discretion to ameliorate\nunjust results on a case-by-case basis.\n   Although narcotics offenses—such as the offense at\nissue in this case—provided a distinct basis for deporta\ntion as early as 1922,4 the JRAD procedure was generally\n——————\n    3 Asenacted, the statute provided:\n“That the provision of this section respecting the deportation of aliens\nconvicted of a crime involving moral turpitude shall not apply to one\nwho has been pardoned, nor shall such deportation be made or directed\nif the court, or judge thereof, sentencing such alien for such crime shall,\nat the time of imposing judgment or passing sentence or within thirty\ndays thereafter, . . . make a recommendation to the Secretary of Labor\nthat such alien shall not be deported in pursuance of this Act.” 1917\nAct, 39 Stat. 889–890.\nThis provision was codified in 8 U. S. C. §1251(b) (1994 ed.) (transferred\nto §1227 (2006 ed. )). The judge’s nondeportation recommendation was\nbinding on the Secretary of Labor and, later, the Attorney General after\ncontrol of immigration removal matters was transferred from the\nformer to the latter. See Janvier v. United States, 793 F. 2d 449, 452\n(CA2 1986).\n   4 Congress first identified narcotics offenses as a special category of\n\ncrimes triggering deportation in the 1922 Narcotic Drug Act. Act of\nMay 26, 1922, ch. 202, 42 Stat. 596. After the 1922 Act took effect,\nthere was some initial confusion over whether a narcotics offense also\nhad to be a crime of moral turpitude for an individual to be deportable.\nSee Weedin v. Moy Fat, 8 F. 2d 488, 489 (CA9 1925) (holding that an\nindividual who committed narcotics offense was not deportable because\noffense did not involve moral turpitude). However, lower courts even\ntually agreed that the narcotics offense provision was “special,” Chung\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\navailable to avoid deportation in narcotics convictions.\nSee United States v. O’Rourke, 213 F. 2d 759, 762 (CA8\n1954). Except for “technical, inadvertent and insignificant\nviolations of the laws relating to narcotics,” ibid., it ap\npears that courts treated narcotics offenses as crimes\ninvolving moral turpitude for purposes of the 1917 Act’s\nbroad JRAD provision. See ibid. (recognizing that until\n1952 a JRAD in a narcotics case “was effective to prevent\ndeportation” (citing Dang Nam v. Bryan, 74 F. 2d 379,\n380–381 (CA9 1934))).\n   In light of both the steady expansion of deportable\noffenses and the significant ameliorative effect of a JRAD,\nit is unsurprising that, in the wake of Strickland v. Wash\nington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), the Second Circuit held that\nthe Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of\ncounsel applies to a JRAD request or lack thereof, see\nJanvier, 793 F. 2d 449. See also United States v. Castro,\n26 F. 3d 557 (CA5 1994). In its view, seeking a JRAD was\n“part of the sentencing” process, Janvier, 793 F. 2d, at 452,\neven if deportation itself is a civil action. Under the Sec\nond Circuit’s reasoning, the impact of a conviction on a\nnoncitizen’s ability to remain in the country was a central\nissue to be resolved during the sentencing process—not\nmerely a collateral matter outside the scope of counsel’s\nduty to provide effective representation.\n   However, the JRAD procedure is no longer part of our\nlaw. Congress first circumscribed the JRAD provision in\nthe 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act (INA),5 and in\n——————\nQue Fong v. Nagle, 15 F. 2d 789, 790 (CA9 1926); thus, a narcotics\noffense did not need also to be a crime of moral turpitude (or to satisfy\nother requirements of the 1917 Act) to trigger deportation. See United\nStates ex rel. Grimaldi v. Ebey, 12 F. 2d 922, 923 (CA7 1926); Todaro v.\nMunster, 62 F. 2d 963, 964 (CA10 1933).\n   5 The Act separately codified the moral turpitude offense provision\n\nand the narcotics offense provision within 8 U. S. C. §1251(a) (1994 ed.)\nunder subsections (a)(4) and (a)(11), respectively. See 66 Stat. 201, 204,\n6                      PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n1990 Congress entirely eliminated it, 104 Stat. 5050. In\n1996, Congress also eliminated the Attorney General’s\nauthority to grant discretionary relief from deportation,\n110 Stat. 3009–596, an authority that had been exercised\nto prevent the deportation of over 10,000 noncitizens\nduring the 5-year period prior to 1996, INS v. St. Cyr, 533\nU. S. 289, 296 (2001). Under contemporary law, if a non\ncitizen has committed a removable offense after the 1996\neffective date of these amendments, his removal is practi\ncally inevitable but for the possible exercise of limited\nremnants of equitable discretion vested in the Attorney\nGeneral to cancel removal for noncitizens convicted of\nparticular classes of offenses.6 See 8 U. S. C. §1229b.\nSubject to limited exceptions, this discretionary relief is\nnot available for an offense related to trafficking in a\ncontrolled substance. See §1101(a)(43)(B); §1228.\n   These changes to our immigration law have dramati\ncally raised the stakes of a noncitizen’s criminal convic\ntion. The importance of accurate legal advice for nonciti\nzens accused of crimes has never been more important.\nThese changes confirm our view that, as a matter of fed\neral law, deportation is an integral part—indeed, some\ntimes the most important part 7—of the penalty that may\nbe imposed on noncitizen defendants who plead guilty to\nspecified crimes.\n\n——————\n206. The JRAD procedure, codified in 8 U. S. C. §1251(b) (1994 ed.),\napplied only to the “provisions of subsection (a)(4),” the crimes-of-moral\nturpitude provision. 66 Stat. 208; see United States v. O’Rourke, 213\nF. 2d 759, 762 (CA8 1954) (recognizing that, under the 1952 Act,\nnarcotics offenses were no longer eligible for JRADs).\n  6 The changes to our immigration law have also involved a change in\n\nnomenclature; the statutory text now uses the term “removal” rather\nthan “deportation.” See Calcano-Martinez v. INS, 533 U. S. 348, 350,\nn. 1 (2001).\n  7 See Brief for Asian American Justice Center et al. as Amici Curiae\n\n12–27 (providing real-world examples).\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

Richardson, 397 U. S. 759, 771 (1970); Strick\nland, 466 U. S., at 686. The Supreme Court of Kentucky\nrejected Padilla’s ineffectiveness claim on the ground that\nthe advice he sought about the risk of deportation con\ncerned only collateral matters, i.e., those matters not\nwithin the sentencing authority of the state trial court.8\n253 S. W. 3d, at 483–484 (citing Commonwealth v. Fuar\ntado, 170 S. W. 3d 384 (2005)). In its view, “collateral\nconsequences are outside the scope of representation\nrequired by the Sixth Amendment,” and, therefore, the\n“failure of defense counsel to advise the defendant of\npossible deportation consequences is not cognizable as a\nclaim for ineffective assistance of counsel.” 253 S. W. 3d,\nat 483. The Kentucky high court is far from alone in this\nview.9\n——————\n   8 There is some disagreement among the courts over how to distin\n\nguish between direct and collateral consequences. See Roberts, Igno\nrance is Effectively Bliss: Collateral Consequences, Silence, and Misin\nformation in the Guilty-Plea Process, 95 Iowa L. Rev. 119, 124, n. 15\n(2009). The disagreement over how to apply the direct/collateral\ndistinction has no bearing on the disposition of this case because, as\neven JUSTICE ALITO agrees, counsel must, at the very least, advise a\nnoncitizen “defendant that a criminal conviction may have adverse\nimmigration consequences,” post, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment).\nSee also post, at 14 (“I do not mean to suggest that the Sixth Amend\nment does no more than require defense counsel to avoid misinforma\ntion”). In his concurring opinion, JUSTICE ALITO has thus departed from\nthe strict rule applied by the Supreme Court of Kentucky and in the\ntwo federal cases that he cites, post, at 2.\n   9 See, e.g., United States v.

KENTUCKY\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   We, however, have never applied a distinction between\ndirect and collateral consequences to define the scope of\nconstitutionally “reasonable professional assistance”\nrequired under Strickland, 466 U. S., at 689. Whether\nthat distinction is appropriate is a question we need not\nconsider in this case because of the unique nature of\ndeportation.\n   We have long recognized that deportation is a particu\nlarly severe “penalty,” Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149\nU. S. 698, 740 (1893); but it is not, in a strict sense, a\ncriminal sanction. Although removal proceedings are civil\nin nature, see INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U. S. 1032, 1038\n(1984), deportation is nevertheless intimately related to\nthe criminal process. Our law has enmeshed criminal\nconvictions and the penalty of deportation for nearly a\ncentury, see Part I, supra, at 2–7. And, importantly,\nrecent changes in our immigration law have made removal\nnearly an automatic result for a broad class of noncitizen\noffenders. Thus, we find it “most difficult” to divorce the\npenalty from the conviction in the deportation context.\nUnited States v. Russell, 686 F. 2d 35, 38 (CADC 1982).\nMoreover, we are quite confident that noncitizen defen\ndants facing a risk of deportation for a particular offense\nfind it even more difficult. See St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 322\n(“There can be little doubt that, as a general matter, alien\ndefendants considering whether to enter into a plea\nagreement are acutely aware of the immigration conse\nquences of their convictions”).\n   Deportation as a consequence of a criminal conviction is,\nbecause of its close connection to the criminal process,\nuniquely difficult to classify as either a direct or a collat\neral consequence.

We conclude that\nadvice regarding deportation is not categorically removed\nfrom the ambit of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\nStrickland applies to Padilla’s claim.\n                               III\n   Under Strickland, we first determine whether counsel’s\nrepresentation “fell below an objective standard of reason\nableness.” 466 U. S., at 688. Then we ask whether “there\nis a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unpro\nfessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have\nbeen different.” Id., at 694. The first prong—constitu\ntional deficiency—is necessarily linked to the practice and\nexpectations of the legal community: “The proper measure\nof attorney performance remains simply reasonableness\nunder prevailing professional norms.” Id., at 688. We long\nhave recognized that “[p]revailing norms of practice as\nreflected in American Bar Association standards and the\nlike . . . are guides to determining what is reasonable . . . .”\nIbid.; Bobby v.

Ibid.,\nn. 50.\n   In the instant case, the terms of the relevant immigra\ntion statute are succinct, clear, and explicit in defining the\nremoval consequence for Padilla’s conviction.           See 8\nU. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(B)(i) (“Any alien who at any time after\nadmission has been convicted of a violation of (or a con\nspiracy or attempt to violate) any law or regulation of a\nState, the United States or a foreign country relating to a\ncontrolled substance . . . , other than a single offense in\nvolving possession for one’s own use of 30 grams or less of\nmarijuana, is deportable”). Padilla’s counsel could have\neasily determined that his plea would make him eligible\nfor deportation simply from reading the text of the statute,\nwhich addresses not some broad classification of crimes\nbut specifically commands removal for all controlled sub\nstances convictions except for the most trivial of mari\njuana possession offenses.        Instead, Padilla’s counsel\nprovided him false assurance that his conviction would not\nresult in his removal from this country. This is not a hard\ncase in which to find deficiency: The consequences of\nPadilla’s plea could easily be determined from reading the\nremoval statute, his deportation was presumptively man\ndatory, and his counsel’s advice was incorrect.\n   Immigration law can be complex, and it is a legal spe\ncialty of its own. Some members of the bar who represent\nclients facing criminal charges, in either state or federal\ncourt or both, may not be well versed in it. There will,\ntherefore, undoubtedly be numerous situations in which\nthe deportation consequences of a particular plea are\nunclear or uncertain. The duty of the private practitioner\nin such cases is more limited. When the law is not suc\ncinct and straightforward (as it is in many of the scenarios\n12                     PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nposited by JUSTICE ALITO), a criminal defense attorney\nneed do no more than advise a noncitizen client that pend\ning criminal charges may carry a risk of adverse immigra\ntion consequences.10 But when the deportation conse\nquence is truly clear, as it was in this case, the duty to\ngive correct advice is equally clear.\n   Accepting his allegations as true, Padilla has suffi\nciently alleged constitutional deficiency to satisfy the first\nprong of Strickland. Whether Padilla is entitled to relief\non his claim will depend on whether he can satisfy Strick\nland’s second prong, prejudice, a matter we leave to the\nKentucky courts to consider in the first instance.\n                              IV\n   The Solicitor General has urged us to conclude that\nStrickland applies to Padilla’s claim only to the extent\nthat he has alleged affirmative misadvice. In the United\nStates’ view, “counsel is not constitutionally required to\nprovide advice on matters that will not be decided in the\ncriminal case . . . ,” though counsel is required to provide\naccurate advice if she chooses to discusses these matters.\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 10.\n   Respondent and Padilla both find the Solicitor General’s\nproposed rule unpersuasive, although it has support\namong the lower courts.

Lack of clarity in the law, however, does not obviate the\nneed for counsel to say something about the possibility of deportation,\neven though it will affect the scope and nature of counsel’s advice.\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

We do not share that view, but we\nagree that there is no relevant difference “between an act\nof commission and an act of omission” in this context. Id.,\nat 30; Strickland, 466 U. S., at 690 (“The court must then\ndetermine whether, in light of all the circumstances, the\nidentified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of\nprofessionally competent assistance”); see also State v.\nParedez, 2004–NMSC–036, 136 N. M. 533, 538–539.\n   A holding limited to affirmative misadvice would invite\ntwo absurd results. First, it would give counsel an incen\ntive to remain silent on matters of great importance, even\nwhen answers are readily available. Silence under these\ncircumstances would be fundamentally at odds with the\ncritical obligation of counsel to advise the client of “the\nadvantages and disadvantages of a plea agreement.”\nLibretti v. United States, 516 U. S. 29, 50–51 (1995).\nWhen attorneys know that their clients face possible exile\nfrom this country and separation from their families, they\nshould not be encouraged to say nothing at all.11 Second,\nit would deny a class of clients least able to represent\nthemselves the most rudimentary advice on deportation\neven when it is readily available. It is quintessentially the\nduty of counsel to provide her client with available advice\nabout an issue like deportation and the failure to do so\n“clearly satisfies the first prong of the Strickland analy\nsis.” Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, 62 (1985) (White, J.,\n\n——————\n   11 As the Commonwealth conceded at oral argument, were a defen\n\ndant’s lawyer to know that a particular offense would result in the\nclient’s deportation and that, upon deportation, the client and his\nfamily might well be killed due to circumstances in the client’s home\ncountry, any decent attorney would inform the client of the conse\nquences of his plea. Tr. of Oral Arg. 37–38. We think the same result\nshould follow when the stakes are not life and death but merely “ban\nishment or exile,” Delgadillo v. Carmichael, 332 U. S. 388, 390–391\n(1947).\n14                      PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nconcurring in judgment).\n   We have given serious consideration to the concerns\nthat the Solicitor General, respondent, and amici have\nstressed regarding the importance of protecting the final\nity of convictions obtained through guilty pleas. We con\nfronted a similar “floodgates” concern in Hill, see id., at\n58, but nevertheless applied Strickland to a claim that\ncounsel had failed to advise the client regarding his parole\neligibility before he pleaded guilty.12\n   A flood did not follow in that decision’s wake. Sur\nmounting Strickland’s high bar is never an easy task.\nSee, e.g., 466 U. S., at 689 (“Judicial scrutiny of counsel’s\nperformance must be highly deferential”); id., at 693\n(observing that “[a]ttorney errors . . . are as likely to be\nutterly harmless in a particular case as they are to be\nprejudicial”). Moreover, to obtain relief on this type of\nclaim, a petitioner must convince the court that a decision\nto reject the plea bargain would have been rational under\nthe circumstances. See Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U. S.\n470, 480, 486 (2000). There is no reason to doubt that\nlower courts—now quite experienced with applying Strick\nland—can effectively and efficiently use its framework to\n——————\n  12 However, we concluded that, even though Strickland applied to\n\npetitioner’s claim, he had not sufficiently alleged prejudice to satisfy\nStrickland’s second prong. Hill, 474 U. S., at 59–60. This disposition\nfurther underscores the fact that it is often quite difficult for petitioners\nwho have acknowledged their guilt to satisfy Strickland’s prejudice\nprong.\n  JUSTICE ALITO believes that the Court misreads Hill, post, at 10–11.\nIn Hill, the Court recognized—for the first time—that Strickland\napplies to advice respecting a guilty plea. 474 U. S., at 58 (“We hold,\ntherefore, that the two-part Strickland v. Washington test applies to\nchallenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel”).\nIt is true that Hill does not control the question before us. But its\nimport is nevertheless clear. Whether Strickland applies to Padilla’s\nclaim follows from Hill, regardless of the fact that the Hill Court did\nnot resolve the particular question respecting misadvice that was\nbefore it.\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nseparate specious claims from those with substantial\nmerit.\n   It seems unlikely that our decision today will have a\nsignificant effect on those convictions already obtained as\nthe result of plea bargains. For at least the past 15 years,\nprofessional norms have generally imposed an obligation\non counsel to provide advice on the deportation conse\nquences of a client’s plea. See, supra, at 11–13. We\nshould, therefore, presume that counsel satisfied their\nobligation to render competent advice at the time their\nclients considered pleading guilty. Strickland, 466 U. S.,\nat 689.\n   Likewise, although we must be especially careful about\nrecognizing new grounds for attacking the validity of\nguilty pleas, in the 25 years since we first applied Strick\nland to claims of ineffective assistance at the plea stage,\npractice has shown that pleas are less frequently the\nsubject of collateral challenges than convictions obtained\nafter a trial. Pleas account for nearly 95% of all criminal\nconvictions.13 But they account for only approximately\n30% of the habeas petitions filed.14 The nature of relief\nsecured by a successful collateral challenge to a guilty\nplea—an opportunity to withdraw the plea and proceed to\ntrial—imposes its own significant limiting principle: Those\nwho collaterally attack their guilty pleas lose the benefit of\nthe bargain obtained as a result of the plea. Thus, a dif\nferent calculus informs whether it is wise to challenge a\n\n——————\n   13 See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Sourcebook of\n\nCriminal Justice Statistics 2003, p. 418 (31st ed. 2005) (Table 5.17)\n(only approximately 5%, or 8,612 out of 68,533, of federal criminal\nprosecutions go to trial); id., at 450 (Table 5.46) (only approximately 5%\nof all state felony criminal prosecutions go to trial).\n   14 See V. Flango, National Center for State Courts, Habeas Corpus in\n\nState and Federal Courts 36–38 (1994) (demonstrating that 5% of\ndefendants whose conviction was the result of a trial account for ap\nproximately 70% of the habeas petitions filed).\n16                     PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nguilty plea in a habeas proceeding because, ultimately,\nthe challenge may result in a less favorable outcome for\nthe defendant, whereas a collateral challenge to a convic\ntion obtained after a jury trial has no similar downside\npotential.\n   Finally, informed consideration of possible deportation\ncan only benefit both the State and noncitizen defendants\nduring the plea-bargaining process. By bringing deporta\ntion consequences into this process, the defense and prose\ncution may well be able to reach agreements that better\nsatisfy the interests of both parties. As in this case, a\ncriminal episode may provide the basis for multiple\ncharges, of which only a subset mandate deportation\nfollowing conviction. Counsel who possess the most rudi\nmentary understanding of the deportation consequences of\na particular criminal offense may be able to plea bargain\ncreatively with the prosecutor in order to craft a conviction\nand sentence that reduce the likelihood of deportation, as\nby avoiding a conviction for an offense that automatically\ntriggers the removal consequence. At the same time, the\nthreat of deportation may provide the defendant with a\npowerful incentive to plead guilty to an offense that does\nnot mandate that penalty in exchange for a dismissal of a\ncharge that does.\n   In sum, we have long recognized that the negotiation of\na plea bargain is a critical phase of litigation for purposes\nof the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of\ncounsel. Hill, 474 U. S., at 57; see also Richardson, 397\nU. S., at 770–771. The severity of deportation—“the\nequivalent of banishment or exile,” Delgadillo v. Carmi\nchael, 332 U. S. 388, 390–391 (1947)—only underscores\nhow critical it is for counsel to inform her noncitizen client\nthat he faces a risk of deportation.15\n——————\n  15 To this end, we find it significant that the plea form currently used\n\nin Kentucky courts provides notice of possible immigration conse\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

S., at 771. To satisfy this responsibility, we now\nhold that counsel must inform her client whether his plea\ncarries a risk of deportation. Our longstanding Sixth\nAmendment precedents, the seriousness of deportation as\na consequence of a criminal plea, and the concomitant\nimpact of deportation on families living lawfully in this\ncountry demand no less.\n   Taking as true the basis for his motion for postconvic\ntion relief, we have little difficulty concluding that Padilla\nhas sufficiently alleged that his counsel was constitution\nally deficient. Whether Padilla is entitled to relief will\ndepend on whether he can demonstrate prejudice as a\nresult thereof, a question we do not reach because it was\nnot passed on below.

The Court nevertheless holds\nthat a criminal defense attorney must provide advice in\nthis specialized area in those cases in which the law is\n“succinct and straightforward”—but not, perhaps, in other\nsituations. Ante, at 11–12. This vague, halfway test will\nlead to much confusion and needless litigation.\n2                   PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n                               I\n   Under Strickland, an attorney provides ineffective\nassistance if the attorney’s representation does not meet\nreasonable professional standards. 466 U. S., at 688.\nUntil today, the longstanding and unanimous position of\nthe federal courts was that reasonable defense counsel\ngenerally need only advise a client about the direct conse\nquences of a criminal conviction. See, e.g., United States v.\nGonzalez, 202 F. 3d 20, 28 (CA1 2000) (ineffective\nassistance-of-counsel claim fails if “based on an attorney’s\nfailure to advise a client of his plea’s immigration conse\nquences”); United States v. Banda, 1 F. 3d 354, 355 (CA5\n1993) (holding that “an attorney’s failure to advise a client\nthat deportation is a possible consequence of a guilty plea\ndoes not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel”); see\ngenerally Chin & Holmes, Effective Assistance of Counsel\nand the Consequences of Guilty Pleas, 87 Cornell L. Rev.\n697, 699 (2002) (hereinafter Chin & Holmes) (noting that\n“virtually all jurisdictions”—including “eleven federal\ncircuits, more than thirty states, and the District of Co\nlumbia”—“hold that defense counsel need not discuss with\ntheir clients the collateral consequences of a conviction,”\nincluding deportation). While the line between “direct”\nand “collateral” consequences is not always clear, see ante,\nat 7, n. 8, the collateral-consequences rule expresses an\nimportant truth: Criminal defense attorneys have exper\ntise regarding the conduct of criminal proceedings. They\nare not expected to possess—and very often do not pos\nsess—expertise in other areas of the law, and it is unreal\nistic to expect them to provide expert advice on matters\nthat lie outside their area of training and experience.\n   This case happens to involve removal, but criminal\nconvictions can carry a wide variety of consequences other\nthan conviction and sentencing, including civil commit\nment, civil forfeiture, the loss of the right to vote, disquali\nfication from public benefits, ineligibility to possess fire\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\narms, dishonorable discharge from the Armed Forces, and\nloss of business or professional licenses. Chin & Holmes\n705–706. A criminal conviction may also severely damage\na defendant’s reputation and thus impair the defendant’s\nability to obtain future employment or business opportuni\nties. All of those consequences are “seriou[s],” see ante, at\n17, but this Court has never held that a criminal defense\nattorney’s Sixth Amendment duties extend to providing\nadvice about such matters.\n   The Court tries to justify its dramatic departure from\nprecedent by pointing to the views of various professional\norganizations. See ante, at 9 (“The weight of prevailing\nprofessional norms supports the view that counsel must\nadvise her client regarding the risk of deportation”).\nHowever, ascertaining the level of professional competence\nrequired by the Sixth Amendment is ultimately a task for\nthe courts. E.g., Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U. S. 470, 477\n(2000). Although we may appropriately consult standards\npromulgated by private bar groups, we cannot delegate to\nthese groups our task of determining what the Constitu\ntion commands. See Strickland, supra, at 688 (explaining\nthat “[p]revailing norms of practice as reflected in Ameri\ncan Bar Association standards . . . are guides to determin\ning what is reasonable, but they are only guides”). And we\nmust recognize that such standards may represent only\nthe aspirations of a bar group rather than an empirical\nassessment of actual practice.\n   Even if the only relevant consideration were “prevailing\nprofessional norms,” it is hard to see how those norms can\nsupport the duty the Court today imposes on defense\ncounsel. Because many criminal defense attorneys have\nlittle understanding of immigration law, see ante, at 11, it\nshould follow that a criminal defense attorney who re\nfrains from providing immigration advice does not violate\nprevailing professional norms. But the Court’s opinion\nwould not just require defense counsel to warn the client\n4                  PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nof a general risk of removal; it would also require counsel\nin at least some cases, to specify what the removal conse\nquences of a conviction would be. See ante, at 11–12.\n   The Court’s new approach is particularly problematic\nbecause providing advice on whether a conviction for a\nparticular offense will make an alien removable is often\nquite complex. “Most crimes affecting immigration status\nare not specifically mentioned by the [Immigration and\nNationality Act (INA)], but instead fall under a broad\ncategory of crimes, such as crimes involving moral turpi\ntude or aggravated felonies.” M. Garcia & L. Eig, CRS\nReport for Congress, Immigration Consequences of Crimi\nnal Activity (Sept. 20, 2006) (summary) (emphasis in\noriginal). As has been widely acknowledged, determining\nwhether a particular crime is an “aggravated felony” or a\n“crime involving moral turpitude [(CIMT)]” is not an easy\ntask. See R. McWhirter, ABA, The Criminal Lawyer’s\nGuide to Immigration Law: Questions and Answers 128\n(2d ed. 2006) (hereinafter ABA Guidebook) (“Because of\nthe increased complexity of aggravated felony law, this\nedition devotes a new [30-page] chapter to the subject”);\nid., §5.2, at 146 (stating that the aggravated felony list at\n8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43) is not clear with respect to several\nof the listed categories, that “the term ‘aggravated felonies’\ncan include misdemeanors,” and that the determination of\nwhether a crime is an “aggravated felony” is made “even\nmore difficult” because “several agencies and courts inter\npret the statute,” including Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA),\nand Federal Circuit and district courts considering immi\ngration-law and criminal-law issues); ABA Guidebook\n§4.65, at 130 (“Because nothing is ever simple with immi\ngration law, the terms ‘conviction,’ ‘moral turpitude,’ and\n‘single scheme of criminal misconduct’ are terms of art”);\nid., §4.67, at 130 (“[T]he term ‘moral turpitude’ evades\nprecise definition”).\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   Defense counsel who consults a guidebook on whether a\nparticular crime is an “aggravated felony” will often find\nthat the answer is not ‘‘easily ascertained.” For example,\nthe ABA Guidebook answers the question “Does simple\npossession count as an aggravated felony?” as follows:\n“Yes, at least in the Ninth Circuit.” §5.35, at 160 (empha\nsis added). After a dizzying paragraph that attempts to\nexplain the evolution of the Ninth Circuit’s view, the ABA\nGuidebook continues: “Adding to the confusion, however,\nis that the Ninth Circuit has conflicting opinions depend\ning on the context on whether simple drug possession\nconstitutes an aggravated felony under 8 U. S. C.\n§1101(a)(43).” Id., §5.35, at 161 (citing cases distinguish\ning between whether a simple possession offense is an\naggravated felony “for immigration purposes” or for “sen\ntencing purposes”). The ABA Guidebook then proceeds to\nexplain that “attempted possession,” id., §5.36, at 161\n(emphasis added), of a controlled substance is an aggra\nvated felony, while “[c]onviction under the federal acces\nsory after the fact statute is probably not an aggravated\nfelony, but a conviction for accessory after the fact to the\nmanufacture of methamphetamine is an aggravated fel\nony,” id., §537, at 161 (emphasis added). Conspiracy or\nattempt to commit drug trafficking are aggravated felo\nnies, but “[s]olicitation is not a drug-trafficking offense\nbecause a generic solicitation offense is not an offense\nrelated to a controlled substance and therefore not an\naggravated felony.” Id., §5.41, at 162.\n   Determining whether a particular crime is one involving\nmoral turpitude is no easier. See id., at 134 (“Writing bad\nchecks may or may not be a CIMT” (emphasis added));\nibid. (“[R]eckless assault coupled with an element of in\njury, but not serious injury, is probably not a CIMT” (em\nphasis added)); id., at 135 (misdemeanor driving under the\ninfluence is generally not a CIMT, but may be a CIMT if\nthe DUI results in injury or if the driver knew that his\n6                       PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                    ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nlicense had been suspended or revoked); id., at 136 (“If\nthere is no element of actual injury, the endangerment\noffense may not be a CIMT” (emphasis added)); ibid.\n(“Whether [a child abuse] conviction involves moral turpi\ntude may depend on the subsection under which the indi\nvidual is convicted. Child abuse done with criminal negli\ngence probably is not a CIMT” (emphasis added)).\n   Many other terms of the INA are similarly ambiguous or\nmay be confusing to practitioners not versed in the intri\ncacies of immigration law. To take just a few examples, it\nmay be hard, in some cases, for defense counsel even to\ndetermine whether a client is an alien,1 or whether a\nparticular state disposition will result in a “conviction” for\npurposes of federal immigration law.2 The task of offering\nadvice about the immigration consequences of a criminal\nconviction is further complicated by other problems, in\ncluding significant variations among Circuit interpreta\ntions of federal immigration statutes; the frequency with\n——————\n    1 Citizensare not deportable, but “[q]uestions of citizenship are not\nalways simple.” ABA Guidebook §4.20, at 113 (explaining that U.S.\ncitizenship conferred by blood is “ ‘derivative,’ ” and that “[d]erivative\ncitizenship depends on a number of confusing factors, including\nwhether the citizen parent was the mother or father, the immigration\nlaws in effect at the time of the parents’ and/or defendant’s birth, and\nthe parents’ marital status”).\n   2 “A disposition that is not a ‘conviction,’ under state law may still be\n\na ‘conviction’ for immigration purposes.” Id., §4.32, at 117 (citing\nMatter of Salazar, 23 I. & N. Dec. 223, 231 (BIA 2002) (en banc)). For\nexample, state law may define the term “conviction” not to include a\ndeferred adjudication, but such an adjudication would be deemed a\nconviction for purposes of federal immigration law. See ABA Guide\nbook §4.37; accord, D. Kesselbrenner & L. Rosenberg, Immigration Law\nand Crimes §2:1, p. 2–2 (2008) (hereinafter Immigration Law and\nCrimes) (“A practitioner or respondent will not even know whether the\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) or the Executive Office for\nImmigration Review (EOIR) will treat a particular state disposition as\na conviction for immigration purposes. In fact, the [BIA] treats certain\nstate criminal dispositions as convictions even though the state treats\nthe same disposition as a dismissal”).\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)             7\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nwhich immigration law changes; different rules governing\nthe immigration consequences of juvenile, first-offender,\nand foreign convictions; and the relationship between the\n“length and type of sentence” and the determination\n“whether [an alien] is subject to removal, eligible for relief\nfrom removal, or qualified to become a naturalized citi\nzen,” Immigration Law and Crimes §2:1, at 2–2 to 2–3.\n   In short, the professional organizations and guidebooks\non which the Court so heavily relies are right to say that\n“nothing is ever simple with immigration law”—including\nthe determination whether immigration law clearly makes\na particular offense removable. ABA Guidebook §4.65, at\n130; Immigration Law and Crimes §2:1. I therefore can\nnot agree with the Court’s apparent view that the Sixth\nAmendment requires criminal defense attorneys to pro\nvide immigration advice.\n   The Court tries to downplay the severity of the burden it\nimposes on defense counsel by suggesting that the scope of\ncounsel’s duty to offer advice concerning deportation con\nsequences may turn on how hard it is to determine those\nconsequences. Where “the terms of the relevant immigra\ntion statute are succinct, clear, and explicit in defining the\nremoval consequence[s]” of a conviction, the Court says,\ncounsel has an affirmative duty to advise the client that\nhe will be subject to deportation as a result of the plea.\nAnte, at 11. But “[w]hen the law is not succinct and\nstraightforward . . . , a criminal defense attorney need do\nno more than advise a noncitizen client that pending\ncriminal charges may carry a risk of adverse immigration\nconsequences.” Ante, at 11–12. This approach is problem\natic for at least four reasons.\n   First, it will not always be easy to tell whether a par\nticular statutory provision is “succinct, clear, and explicit.”\nHow can an attorney who lacks general immigration law\nexpertise be sure that a seemingly clear statutory provi\nsion actually means what it seems to say when read in\n8                 PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n               ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nisolation? What if the application of the provision to a\nparticular case is not clear but a cursory examination of\ncase law or administrative decisions would provide a\ndefinitive answer? See Immigration Law and Crimes §2:1,\nat 2–2 (“Unfortunately, a practitioner or respondent can\nnot tell easily whether a conviction is for a removable\noffense. . . . [T]he cautious practitioner or apprehensive\nrespondent will not know conclusively the future immigra\ntion consequences of a guilty plea”).\n   Second, if defense counsel must provide advice regard\ning only one of the many collateral consequences of a\ncriminal conviction, many defendants are likely to be\nmisled. To take just one example, a conviction for a par\nticular offense may render an alien excludable but not\nremovable. If an alien charged with such an offense is\nadvised only that pleading guilty to such an offense will\nnot result in removal, the alien may be induced to enter a\nguilty plea without realizing that a consequence of the\nplea is that the alien will be unable to reenter the United\nStates if the alien returns to his or her home country for\nany reason, such as to visit an elderly parent or to attend\na funeral. See ABA Guidebook §4.14, at 111 (“Often the\nalien is both excludable and removable. At times, how\never, the lists are different. Thus, the oddity of an alien\nthat is inadmissible but not deportable. This alien should\nnot leave the United States because the government will\nnot let him back in” (emphasis in original)). Incomplete\nlegal advice may be worse than no advice at all because it\nmay mislead and may dissuade the client from seeking\nadvice from a more knowledgeable source.\n   Third, the Court’s rigid constitutional rule could inad\nvertently head off more promising ways of addressing the\nunderlying problem—such as statutory or administrative\nreforms requiring trial judges to inform a defendant on the\nrecord that a guilty plea may carry adverse immigration\nconsequences. As amici point out, “28 states and the\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nDistrict of Columbia have already adopted rules, plea\nforms, or statutes requiring courts to advise criminal\ndefendants of the possible immigration consequences of\ntheir pleas.” Brief for State of Louisiana et al. 25; accord,\nChin & Holmes 708 (“A growing number of states require\nadvice about deportation by statute or court rule”). A\nnonconstitutional rule requiring trial judges to inform\ndefendants on the record of the risk of adverse immigra\ntion consequences can ensure that a defendant receives\nneeded information without putting a large number of\ncriminal convictions at risk; and because such a warning\nwould be given on the record, courts would not later have\nto determine whether the defendant was misrepresenting\nthe advice of counsel. Likewise, flexible statutory proce\ndures for withdrawing guilty pleas might give courts\nappropriate discretion to determine whether the interests\nof justice would be served by allowing a particular defen\ndant to withdraw a plea entered into on the basis of in\ncomplete information. Cf. United States v. Russell, 686\nF. 2d 35, 39–40 (CADC 1982) (explaining that a district\ncourt’s discretion to set aside a guilty plea under the Fed\neral Rules of Criminal Procedure should be guided by,\namong other considerations, “the possible existence of\nprejudice to the government’s case as a result of the de\nfendant’s untimely request to stand trial” and “the\nstrength of the defendant’s reason for withdrawing the\nplea, including whether the defendant asserts his inno\ncence of the charge”).\n   Fourth, the Court’s decision marks a major upheaval in\nSixth Amendment law. This Court decided Strickland in\n1984, but the majority does not cite a single case, from this\nor any other federal court, holding that criminal defense\ncounsel’s failure to provide advice concerning the removal\nconsequences of a criminal conviction violates a defen\ndant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel. As noted above,\nthe Court’s view has been rejected by every Federal Court\n10                 PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nof Appeals to have considered the issue thus far. See, e.g.,\nGonzalez, 202 F. 3d, at 28; Banda, 1 F. 3d, at 355; Chin &\nHolmes 697, 699. The majority appropriately acknowl\nedges that the lower courts are “now quite experienced\nwith applying Strickland,” ante, at 14, but it casually\ndismisses the longstanding and unanimous position of\nthe lower federal courts with respect to the scope of\ncriminal defense counsel’s duty to advise on collateral\nconsequences.\n   The majority seeks to downplay its dramatic expansion\nof the scope of criminal defense counsel’s duties under the\nSixth Amendment by claiming that this Court in Hill v.\nLockhart, 474 U. S. 52 (1985), similarly “applied Strick\nland to a claim that counsel had failed to advise the client\nregarding his parole eligibility before he pleaded guilty.”\nAnte, at 14. That characterization of Hill obscures much\nmore than it reveals. The issue in Hill was whether a\ncriminal defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel\nwas violated where counsel misinformed the client about\nhis eligibility for parole. The Court found it “unnecessary\nto determine whether there may be circumstances under\nwhich erroneous advice by counsel as to parole eligibility\nmay be deemed constitutionally ineffective assistance of\ncounsel, because in the present case we conclude that\npetitioner’s allegations are insufficient to satisfy the\nStrickland v. Washington requirement of ‘prejudice.’ ” 474\nU. S., at 60. Given that Hill expressly and unambiguously\nrefused to decide whether criminal defense counsel must\navoid misinforming his or her client as to one consequence\nof a criminal conviction (parole eligibility), that case\nplainly provides no support whatsoever for the proposition\nthat counsel must affirmatively advise his or her client as\nto another collateral consequence (removal).        By the\nCourt’s strange logic, Hill would support its decision here\neven if the Court had held that misadvice concerning\nparole eligibility does not make counsel’s performance\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nobjectively unreasonable. After all, the Court still would\nhave “applied Strickland” to the facts of the case at hand.\n                                II\n  While mastery of immigration law is not required by\nStrickland, several considerations support the conclu\nsion that affirmative misadvice regarding the removal\nconsequences of a conviction may constitute ineffective\nassistance.\n  First, a rule prohibiting affirmative misadvice regarding\na matter as crucial to the defendant’s plea decision as\ndeportation appears faithful to the scope and nature of the\nSixth Amendment duty this Court has recognized in its\npast cases. In particular, we have explained that “a guilty\nplea cannot be attacked as based on inadequate legal\nadvice unless counsel was not ‘a reasonably competent\nattorney’ and the advice was not ‘within the range of\ncompetence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.’ ”\nStrickland, 466 U. S., at 687 (quoting McMann v. Richard\nson, 397 U. S. 759, 770, 771 (1970); emphasis added). As\nthe Court appears to acknowledge, thorough understand\ning of the intricacies of immigration law is not “within the\nrange of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal\ncases.” See ante, at 11 (“Immigration law can be complex,\nand it is a legal specialty of its own. Some members of the\nbar who represent clients facing criminal charges, in\neither state or federal court or both, may not be well\nversed in it”). By contrast, reasonably competent attor\nneys should know that it is not appropriate or responsible\nto hold themselves out as authorities on a difficult and\ncomplicated subject matter with which they are not famil\niar. Candor concerning the limits of one’s professional\nexpertise, in other words, is within the range of duties\nreasonably expected of defense attorneys in criminal cases.\nAs the dissenting judge on the Kentucky Supreme Court\nput it, “I do not believe it is too much of a burden to place\n12                 PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\non our defense bar the duty to say, ‘I do not know.’ ” 253\nS. W. 3d 482, 485 (2008).\n   Second, incompetent advice distorts the defendant’s\ndecisionmaking process and seems to call the fairness and\nintegrity of the criminal proceeding itself into question.\nSee Strickland, 466 U. S., at 686 (“In giving meaning to\nthe requirement [of effective assistance of counsel], we\nmust take its purpose—to ensure a fair trial—as the\nguide”). When a defendant opts to plead guilty without\ndefinitive information concerning the likely effects of the\nplea, the defendant can fairly be said to assume the risk\nthat the conviction may carry indirect consequences of\nwhich he or she is not aware. That is not the case when a\ndefendant bases the decision to plead guilty on counsel’s\nexpress misrepresentation that the defendant will not be\nremovable. In the latter case, it seems hard to say that\nthe plea was entered with the advice of constitutionally\ncompetent counsel—or that it embodies a voluntary and\nintelligent decision to forsake constitutional rights. See\nibid. (“The benchmark for judging any claim of ineffec\ntiveness must be whether counsel’s conduct so under\nmined the proper functioning of the adversarial process\nthat the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just\nresult”).\n   Third, a rule prohibiting unreasonable misadvice re\ngarding exceptionally important collateral matters would\nnot deter or interfere with ongoing political and adminis\ntrative efforts to devise fair and reasonable solutions to\nthe difficult problem posed by defendants who plead\nguilty without knowing of certain important collateral\nconsequences.\n   Finally, the conclusion that affirmative misadvice re\ngarding the removal consequences of a conviction can give\nrise to ineffective assistance would, unlike the Court’s\napproach, not require any upheaval in the law. As the\nSolicitor General points out, “[t]he vast majority of the\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    13\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nlower courts considering claims of ineffective assistance in\nthe plea context have [distinguished] between defense\ncounsel who remain silent and defense counsel who give\naffirmative misadvice.” Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 8 (citing cases). At least three Courts of Appeals\nhave held that affirmative misadvice on immigration\nmatters can give rise to ineffective assistance of counsel,\nat least in some circumstances.3 And several other Cir-\ncuits have held that affirmative misadvice concerning\nnonimmigration consequences of a conviction can violate\nthe Sixth Amendment even if those consequences might be\ndeemed “collateral.”4 By contrast, it appears that no court\nof appeals holds that affirmative misadvice concerning\ncollateral consequences in general and removal in particu-\nlar can never give rise to ineffective assistance. In short,\n——————\n  3 See  United States v. Kwan, 407 F. 3d 1005, 1015–1017 (CA9 2005);\nUnited States v. Couto, 311 F. 3d 179, 188 (CA2 2002); Downs-Morgan\nv.

United\nStates, 548 F. 3d 327, 333–334 (CA5 2008) (concluding that counsel’s\nadvice was not objectively unreasonable where counsel did not purport\nto answer questions about immigration law, did not claim any expertise\nin immigration law, and simply warned of “possible” deportation\nconsequence; use of the word “possible” was not an affirmative misrep-\nresentation, even though it could indicate that deportation was not a\ncertain consequence).\n   4 See Hill v. Lockhart, 894 F. 2d 1009, 1010 (CA8 1990) (en banc)\n\n(“[T]he erroneous parole-eligibility advice given to Mr. Hill was ineffec-\ntive assistance of counsel under Strickland v.

Garrison, 611\nF. 2d 61, 65 (CA4 1979) (“[T]hough parole eligibility dates are collateral\nconsequences of the entry of a guilty plea of which a defendant need not\nbe informed if he does not inquire, when he is grossly misinformed\nabout it by his lawyer, and relies upon that misinformation, he is\ndeprived of his constitutional right to counsel”).\n14                 PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe considered and thus far unanimous view of the lower\nfederal courts charged with administering Strickland\nclearly supports the conclusion that that Kentucky Su\npreme Court’s position goes too far.\n   In concluding that affirmative misadvice regarding the\nremoval consequences of a criminal conviction may consti\ntute ineffective assistance, I do not mean to suggest that\nthe Sixth Amendment does no more than require defense\ncounsel to avoid misinformation. When a criminal defense\nattorney is aware that a client is an alien, the attorney\nshould advise the client that a criminal conviction may\nhave adverse consequences under the immigration laws\nand that the client should consult an immigration special\nist if the client wants advice on that subject. By putting\nthe client on notice of the danger of removal, such advice\nwould significantly reduce the chance that the client\nwould plead guilty under a mistaken premise.\n                              III\n  In sum, a criminal defense attorney should not be re\nquired to provide advice on immigration law, a complex\nspecialty that generally lies outside the scope of a criminal\ndefense attorney’s expertise. On the other hand, any\ncompetent criminal defense attorney should appreciate the\nextraordinary importance that the risk of removal might\nhave in the client’s determination whether to enter a\nguilty plea.    Accordingly, unreasonable and incorrect\ninformation concerning the risk of removal can give rise to\nan ineffectiveness claim. In addition, silence alone is not\nenough to satisfy counsel’s duty to assist the client. In\nstead, an alien defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel is satisfied if defense counsel advises the client\nthat a conviction may have immigration consequences,\nthat immigration law is a specialized field, that the attor\nney is not an immigration lawyer, and that the client\nshould consult an immigration specialist if the client\nwants advice on that subject.\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

KENTUCKY\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                      KENTUCKY\n\n                        [March 31, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\ndissenting.\n   In the best of all possible worlds, criminal defendants\ncontemplating a guilty plea ought to be advised of all\nserious collateral consequences of conviction, and surely\nought not to be misadvised. The Constitution, however, is\nnot an all-purpose tool for judicial construction of a perfect\nworld; and when we ignore its text in order to make it\nthat, we often find ourselves swinging a sledge where a\ntack hammer is needed.\n   The Sixth Amendment guarantees the accused a lawyer\n“for his defense” against a “criminal prosecutio[n]”—not\nfor sound advice about the collateral consequences of\nconviction. For that reason, and for the practical reasons\nset forth in Part I of JUSTICE ALITO’s concurrence, I dis\nsent from the Court’s conclusion that the Sixth Amend\nment requires counsel to provide accurate advice concern\ning the potential removal consequences of a guilty plea.\nFor the same reasons, but unlike the concurrence, I do not\nbelieve that affirmative misadvice about those conse\nquences renders an attorney’s assistance in defending\nagainst the prosecution constitutionally inadequate; or\nthat the Sixth Amendment requires counsel to warn im\nmigrant defendants that a conviction may render them\nremovable. Statutory provisions can remedy these con\ncerns in a more targeted fashion, and without producing\n2                  PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\npermanent, and legislatively irreparable, overkill.\n                        *      *     *\n   The Sixth Amendment as originally understood and\nratified meant only that a defendant had a right to employ\ncounsel, or to use volunteered services of counsel. See,\nUnited States v. Van Duzee, 140 U. S. 169, 173 (1891); W.\nBeaney, Right to Counsel in American Courts 21, 28–29\n(1955). We have held, however, that the Sixth Amend\nment requires the provision of counsel to indigent defen\ndants at government expense, Gideon v. Wainwright, 372\nU. S. 335, 344–345 (1963), and that the right to “the assis\ntance of counsel” includes the right to effective assistance,\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 686 (1984). Even\nassuming the validity of these holdings, I reject the sig\nnificant further extension that the Court, and to a lesser\nextent the concurrence, would create. We have until today\nat least retained the Sixth Amendment’s textual limita\ntion to criminal prosecutions. “[W]e have held that ‘de\nfence’ means defense at trial, not defense in relation to\nother objectives that may be important to the accused.”\nRothgery v. Gillespie County, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008)\n(ALITO, J., concurring) (slip op., at 4) (summarizing cases).\nWe have limited the Sixth Amendment to legal advice\ndirectly related to defense against prosecution of the\ncharged offense—advice at trial, of course, but also advice\nat postindictment interrogations and lineups, Massiah v.\nUnited States, 377 U. S. 201, 205–206 (1964); United\nStates v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 236–238 (1967), and in\ngeneral advice at all phases of the prosecution where the\ndefendant would be at a disadvantage when pitted alone\nagainst the legally trained agents of the state, see Moran\nv. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 430 (1986). Not only have we\nnot required advice of counsel regarding consequences\ncollateral to prosecution, we have not even required coun\nsel appointed to defend against one prosecution to be\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

Texas v. Cobb, 532 U. S. 162, 164 (2001).\n  There is no basis in text or in principle to extend the\nconstitutionally required advice regarding guilty pleas\nbeyond those matters germane to the criminal prosecution\nat hand—to wit, the sentence that the plea will produce,\nthe higher sentence that conviction after trial might en\ntail, and the chances of such a conviction. Such matters\nfall within “the range of competence demanded of attor\nneys in criminal cases,” McMann v. Richardson, 397 U. S.\n759, 771 (1970). See id., at 769–770 (describing the mat\nters counsel and client must consider in connection with a\ncontemplated guilty plea). We have never held, as the\nlogic of the Court’s opinion assumes, that once counsel is\nappointed all professional responsibilities of counsel—even\nthose extending beyond defense against the prosecution—\nbecome constitutional commands. Cf. Cobb, supra, at 171,\nn. 2; Moran, supra, at 430. Because the subject of the\nmisadvice here was not the prosecution for which Jose\nPadilla was entitled to effective assistance of counsel, the\nSixth Amendment has no application.\n  Adding to counsel’s duties an obligation to advise about\na conviction’s collateral consequences has no logical stop\nping-point. As the concurrence observes,\n    “[A] criminal convictio[n] can carry a wide variety of\n    consequences other than conviction and sentencing,\n    including civil commitment, civil forfeiture, the loss of\n    the right to vote, disqualification from public benefits,\n    ineligibility to possess firearms, dishonorable dis\n    charge from the Armed Forces, and loss of business or\n    professional licenses. . . . All of those consequences are\n    ‘serious,’ . . . .” Ante, at 2–3 (ALITO, J., concurring in\n    judgment).\nBut it seems to me that the concurrence suffers from the\n4                      PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsame defect. The same indeterminacy, the same inability\nto know what areas of advice are relevant, attaches to\nmisadvice. And the concurrence’s suggestion that counsel\nmust warn defendants of potential removal consequences,\nsee ante, at 14–15—what would come to be known as the\n“Padilla warning”—cannot be limited to those conse\nquences except by judicial caprice. It is difficult to believe\nthat the warning requirement would not be extended, for\nexample, to the risk of heightened sentences in later fed\neral prosecutions pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal\nAct, 18 U. S. C. §924(e). We could expect years of elabora\ntion upon these new issues in the lower courts, prompted\nby the defense bar’s devising of ever-expanding categories\nof plea-invalidating misadvice and failures to warn—not to\nmention innumerable evidentiary hearings to determine\nwhether misadvice really occurred or whether the warning\nwas really given.\n   The concurrence’s treatment of misadvice seems driven\nby concern about the voluntariness of Padilla’s guilty plea.\nSee ante, at 12. But that concern properly relates to the\nDue Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amend\nments, not to the Sixth Amendment. See McCarthy v.\nUnited States, 394 U. S. 459, 466 (1969); Brady v. United\nStates, 397 U. S. 742, 748 (1970). Padilla has not argued\nbefore us that his guilty plea was not knowing and volun\ntary. If that is, however, the true substance of his claim\n(and if he has properly preserved it) the state court can\naddress it on remand.1 But we should not smuggle the\n——————\n    1I\n     do not mean to suggest that the Due Process Clause would surely\nprovide relief. We have indicated that awareness of “direct conse\nquences” suffices for the validity of a guilty plea. See Brady, 397 U. S.,\nat 755 (internal quotation marks omitted). And the required colloquy\nbetween a federal district court and a defendant required by Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure 11(b) (formerly Rule 11(c)), which we have\nsaid approximates the due process requirements for a valid plea, see\nLibretti v. United States, 516 U. S. 29, 49–50 (1995), does not mention\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

If the subject had not been\nconstitutionalized, legislation could specify which catego\nries of misadvice about matters ancillary to the prosecu\ntion invalidate plea agreements, what collateral conse\nquences counsel must bring to a defendant’s attention, and\nwhat warnings must be given.2 Moreover, legislation\ncould provide consequences for the misadvice, nonadvice,\nor failure to warn, other than nullification of a criminal\nconviction after the witnesses and evidence needed for\nretrial have disappeared. Federal immigration law might\nprovide, for example, that the near-automatic removal\nwhich follows from certain criminal convictions will not\napply where the conviction rested upon a guilty plea in\nduced by counsel’s misadvice regarding removal conse\nquences. Or legislation might put the government to a\nchoice in such circumstances: Either retry the defendant\nor forgo the removal. But all that has been precluded in\nfavor of today’s sledge hammer.\n   In sum, the Sixth Amendment guarantees adequate\nassistance of counsel in defending against a pending\ncriminal prosecution. We should limit both the constitu\ntional obligation to provide advice and the consequences of\nbad advice to that well defined area.\n\n\n\n\n——————\ncollateral consequences. Whatever the outcome, however, the effect of\nmisadvice regarding such consequences upon the validity of a guilty\nplea should be analyzed under the Due Process Clause.\n  2 As the Court’s opinion notes, ante, at 16–17, n. 15, many States—\n\nincluding Kentucky—already require that criminal defendants be\nwarned of potential removal consequences.\n</pre>", "id": 1723, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2010/03/31/Padilla_v._Kentucky.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2009                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

KENTUCKY\n\n      CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF KENTUCKY\n\n    No. 08–651.      Argued October 13, 2009—Decided March 31, 2010\nPetitioner Padilla, a lawful permanent resident of the United States for\n  over 40 years, faces deportation after pleading guilty to drug\n  distribution charges in Kentucky. In postconviction proceedings, he\n  claims that his counsel not only failed to advise him of this conse\n  quence before he entered the plea, but also told him not to worry\n  about deportation since he had lived in this country so long. He al\n  leges that he would have gone to trial had he not received this incor\n  rect advice. The Kentucky Supreme Court denied Padilla postconvic\n  tion relief on the ground that the Sixth Amendment’s effective\n  assistance-of-counsel guarantee does not protect defendants from er\n  roneous deportation advice because deportation is merely a “collat\n  eral” consequence of a conviction.\nHeld: Because counsel must inform a client whether his plea carries a\n risk of deportation, Padilla has sufficiently alleged that his counsel\n was constitutionally deficient. Whether he is entitled to relief de\n pends on whether he has been prejudiced, a matter not addressed\n here. Pp. 2–18.\n    (a) Changes to immigration law have dramatically raised the\n stakes of a noncitizen’s criminal conviction. While once there was\n only a narrow class of deportable offenses and judges wielded broad\n discretionary authority to prevent deportation, immigration reforms\n have expanded the class of deportable offenses and limited judges’\n authority to alleviate deportation’s harsh consequences. Because the\n drastic measure of deportation or removal is now virtually inevitable\n for a vast number of noncitizens convicted of crimes, the importance\n of accurate legal advice for noncitizens accused of crimes has never\n been more important. Thus, as a matter of federal law, deportation is\n an integral part of the penalty that may be imposed on noncitizen de\n fendants who plead guilty to specified crimes. Pp. 2–6.\n2                         PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n       (b) Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, applies to Padilla’s\n    claim. Before deciding whether to plead guilty, a defendant is enti\n    tled to “the effective assistance of competent counsel.” McMann v.\n    Richardson, 397 U. S. 759, 771. The Supreme Court of Kentucky re\n    jected Padilla’s ineffectiveness claim on the ground that the advice he\n    sought about deportation concerned only collateral matters. How\n    ever, this Court has never distinguished between direct and collat\n    eral consequences in defining the scope of constitutionally “reason\n    able professional assistance” required under Strickland, 466 U. S., at\n    689. The question whether that distinction is appropriate need not\n    be considered in this case because of the unique nature of deporta\n    tion. Although removal proceedings are civil, deportation is inti\n    mately related to the criminal process, which makes it uniquely diffi\n    cult to classify as either a direct or a collateral consequence. Because\n    that distinction is thus ill-suited to evaluating a Strickland claim\n    concerning the specific risk of deportation, advice regarding deporta\n    tion is not categorically removed from the ambit of the Sixth Amend\n    ment right to counsel. Pp. 7–9.\n       (c) To satisfy Strickland’s two-prong inquiry, counsel’s representa\n    tion must fall “below an objective standard of reasonableness,” 466\n    U. S., at 688, and there must be “a reasonable probability that, but\n    for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would\n    have been different,” id., at 694. The first, constitutional deficiency,\n    is necessarily linked to the legal community’s practice and expecta\n    tions. Id., at 688. The weight of prevailing professional norms sup\n    ports the view that counsel must advise her client regarding the de\n    portation risk. And this Court has recognized the importance to the\n    client of “ ‘[p]reserving the . . . right to remain in the United States’ ”\n    and “preserving the possibility of” discretionary relief from deporta\n    tion. INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 323. Thus, this is not a hard case\n    in which to find deficiency: The consequences of Padilla’s plea could\n    easily be determined from reading the removal statute, his deporta\n    tion was presumptively mandatory, and his counsel’s advice was in\n    correct. There will, however, undoubtedly be numerous situations in\n    which the deportation consequences of a plea are unclear. In those\n    cases, a criminal defense attorney need do no more than advise a\n    noncitizen client that pending criminal charges may carry adverse\n    immigration consequences. But when the deportation consequence is\n    truly clear, as it was here, the duty to give correct advice is equally\n    clear. Accepting Padilla’s allegations as true, he has sufficiently al\n    leged constitutional deficiency to satisfy Strickland’s first prong.\n    Whether he can satisfy the second prong, prejudice, is left for the\n    Kentucky courts to consider in the first instance. Pp. 9–12.\n       (d) The Solicitor General’s proposed rule—that Strickland should\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

And though this Court must\n  be careful about recognizing new grounds for attacking the validity of\n  guilty pleas, the 25 years since Strickland was first applied to inef\n  fective-assistance claims at the plea stage have shown that pleas are\n  less frequently the subject of collateral challenges than convictions\n  after a trial. Also, informed consideration of possible deportation can\n  benefit both the State and noncitizen defendants, who may be able to\n  reach agreements that better satisfy the interests of both parties.\n  This decision will not open the floodgates to challenges of convictions\n  obtained through plea bargains.

Padilla served this Nation with honor as a\nmember of the U. S. Armed Forces during the Vietnam\nWar. He now faces deportation after pleading guilty to the\ntransportation of a large amount of marijuana in his\ntractor-trailer in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.1\n   In this postconviction proceeding, Padilla claims that his\ncounsel not only failed to advise him of this consequence\nprior to his entering the plea, but also told him that he\n“ ‘did not have to worry about immigration status since he\nhad been in the country so long.’ ” 253 S. W. 3d 482, 483\n(Ky. 2008). Padilla relied on his counsel’s erroneous ad\nvice when he pleaded guilty to the drug charges that made\nhis deportation virtually mandatory. He alleges that he\nwould have insisted on going to trial if he had not received\nincorrect advice from his attorney.\n   Assuming the truth of his allegations, the Supreme\n——————\n  1 Padilla’s crime, like virtually every drug offense except for only the\n\nmost insignificant marijuana offenses, is a deportable offense under 8\nU. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(B)(i).\n2                  PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt of Kentucky denied Padilla postconviction relief\nwithout the benefit of an evidentiary hearing. The court\nheld that the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee of effective\nassistance of counsel does not protect a criminal defendant\nfrom erroneous advice about deportation because it is\nmerely a “collateral” consequence of his conviction. Id., at\n485. In its view, neither counsel’s failure to advise peti\ntioner about the possibility of removal, nor counsel’s incor\nrect advice, could provide a basis for relief.\n   We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009), to decide\nwhether, as a matter of federal law, Padilla’s counsel had\nan obligation to advise him that the offense to which he\nwas pleading guilty would result in his removal from this\ncountry. We agree with Padilla that constitutionally\ncompetent counsel would have advised him that his con\nviction for drug distribution made him subject to auto\nmatic deportation. Whether he is entitled to relief de\npends on whether he has been prejudiced, a matter that\nwe do not address.\n                              I\n   The landscape of federal immigration law has changed\ndramatically over the last 90 years. While once there was\nonly a narrow class of deportable offenses and judges\nwielded broad discretionary authority to prevent deporta\ntion, immigration reforms over time have expanded the\nclass of deportable offenses and limited the authority of\njudges to alleviate the harsh consequences of deportation.\nThe “drastic measure” of deportation or removal, Fong\nHaw Tan v. Phelan, 333 U. S. 6, 10 (1948), is now virtually\ninevitable for a vast number of noncitizens convicted of\ncrimes.\n   The Nation’s first 100 years was “a period of unimpeded\nimmigration.” C.

Gordon §1.2, at 5. It\nwas not until 1875 that Congress first passed a statute\nbarring convicts and prostitutes from entering the coun\ntry, Act of Mar. 3, 1875, ch. 141, 18 Stat. 477. Gordon\n§1.2b, at 6. In 1891, Congress added to the list of exclud\nable persons those “who have been convicted of a felony or\nother infamous crime or misdemeanor involving moral\nturpitude.” Act of Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 551, 26 Stat. 1084.2\n   The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1917 (1917 Act)\nbrought “radical changes” to our law. S. Rep. No. 1515,\n81st Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 54–55 (1950). For the first time\nin our history, Congress made classes of noncitizens de\nportable based on conduct committed on American soil.\nId., at 55. Section 19 of the 1917 Act authorized the de\nportation of “any alien who is hereafter sentenced to im\nprisonment for a term of one year or more because of\nconviction in this country of a crime involving moral turpi\ntude, committed within five years after the entry of the\nalien to the United States . . . .” 39 Stat. 889. And §19\nalso rendered deportable noncitizen recidivists who com\nmit two or more crimes of moral turpitude at any time\nafter entry. Ibid. Congress did not, however, define the\nterm “moral turpitude.”\n   While the 1917 Act was “radical” because it authorized\ndeportation as a consequence of certain convictions, the\nAct also included a critically important procedural protec\ntion to minimize the risk of unjust deportation: At the\ntime of sentencing or within 30 days thereafter, the sen\ntencing judge in both state and federal prosecutions had\nthe power to make a recommendation “that such alien\n——————\n  2 In 1907, Congress expanded the class of excluded persons to include\n\nindividuals who “admit” to having committed a crime of moral turpi\ntude. Act of Feb. 20, 1907, ch. 1134, 34 Stat. 899.\n4                      PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nshall not be deported.” Id., at 890.3 This procedure,\nknown as a judicial recommendation against deportation,\nor JRAD, had the effect of binding the Executive to pre\nvent deportation; the statute was “consistently . . . inter\npreted as giving the sentencing judge conclusive authority\nto decide whether a particular conviction should be disre\ngarded as a basis for deportation,” Janvier v. United\nStates, 793 F. 2d 449, 452 (CA2 1986). Thus, from 1917\nforward, there was no such creature as an automatically\ndeportable offense. Even as the class of deportable of\nfenses expanded, judges retained discretion to ameliorate\nunjust results on a case-by-case basis.\n   Although narcotics offenses—such as the offense at\nissue in this case—provided a distinct basis for deporta\ntion as early as 1922,4 the JRAD procedure was generally\n——————\n    3 Asenacted, the statute provided:\n“That the provision of this section respecting the deportation of aliens\nconvicted of a crime involving moral turpitude shall not apply to one\nwho has been pardoned, nor shall such deportation be made or directed\nif the court, or judge thereof, sentencing such alien for such crime shall,\nat the time of imposing judgment or passing sentence or within thirty\ndays thereafter, . . . make a recommendation to the Secretary of Labor\nthat such alien shall not be deported in pursuance of this Act.” 1917\nAct, 39 Stat. 889–890.\nThis provision was codified in 8 U. S. C. §1251(b) (1994 ed.) (transferred\nto §1227 (2006 ed. )). The judge’s nondeportation recommendation was\nbinding on the Secretary of Labor and, later, the Attorney General after\ncontrol of immigration removal matters was transferred from the\nformer to the latter. See Janvier v. United States, 793 F. 2d 449, 452\n(CA2 1986).\n   4 Congress first identified narcotics offenses as a special category of\n\ncrimes triggering deportation in the 1922 Narcotic Drug Act. Act of\nMay 26, 1922, ch. 202, 42 Stat. 596. After the 1922 Act took effect,\nthere was some initial confusion over whether a narcotics offense also\nhad to be a crime of moral turpitude for an individual to be deportable.\nSee Weedin v. Moy Fat, 8 F. 2d 488, 489 (CA9 1925) (holding that an\nindividual who committed narcotics offense was not deportable because\noffense did not involve moral turpitude). However, lower courts even\ntually agreed that the narcotics offense provision was “special,” Chung\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\navailable to avoid deportation in narcotics convictions.\nSee United States v. O’Rourke, 213 F. 2d 759, 762 (CA8\n1954). Except for “technical, inadvertent and insignificant\nviolations of the laws relating to narcotics,” ibid., it ap\npears that courts treated narcotics offenses as crimes\ninvolving moral turpitude for purposes of the 1917 Act’s\nbroad JRAD provision. See ibid. (recognizing that until\n1952 a JRAD in a narcotics case “was effective to prevent\ndeportation” (citing Dang Nam v. Bryan, 74 F. 2d 379,\n380–381 (CA9 1934))).\n   In light of both the steady expansion of deportable\noffenses and the significant ameliorative effect of a JRAD,\nit is unsurprising that, in the wake of Strickland v. Wash\nington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), the Second Circuit held that\nthe Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of\ncounsel applies to a JRAD request or lack thereof, see\nJanvier, 793 F. 2d 449. See also United States v. Castro,\n26 F. 3d 557 (CA5 1994). In its view, seeking a JRAD was\n“part of the sentencing” process, Janvier, 793 F. 2d, at 452,\neven if deportation itself is a civil action. Under the Sec\nond Circuit’s reasoning, the impact of a conviction on a\nnoncitizen’s ability to remain in the country was a central\nissue to be resolved during the sentencing process—not\nmerely a collateral matter outside the scope of counsel’s\nduty to provide effective representation.\n   However, the JRAD procedure is no longer part of our\nlaw. Congress first circumscribed the JRAD provision in\nthe 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act (INA),5 and in\n——————\nQue Fong v. Nagle, 15 F. 2d 789, 790 (CA9 1926); thus, a narcotics\noffense did not need also to be a crime of moral turpitude (or to satisfy\nother requirements of the 1917 Act) to trigger deportation. See United\nStates ex rel. Grimaldi v. Ebey, 12 F. 2d 922, 923 (CA7 1926); Todaro v.\nMunster, 62 F. 2d 963, 964 (CA10 1933).\n   5 The Act separately codified the moral turpitude offense provision\n\nand the narcotics offense provision within 8 U. S. C. §1251(a) (1994 ed.)\nunder subsections (a)(4) and (a)(11), respectively. See 66 Stat. 201, 204,\n6                      PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n1990 Congress entirely eliminated it, 104 Stat. 5050. In\n1996, Congress also eliminated the Attorney General’s\nauthority to grant discretionary relief from deportation,\n110 Stat. 3009–596, an authority that had been exercised\nto prevent the deportation of over 10,000 noncitizens\nduring the 5-year period prior to 1996, INS v. St. Cyr, 533\nU. S. 289, 296 (2001). Under contemporary law, if a non\ncitizen has committed a removable offense after the 1996\neffective date of these amendments, his removal is practi\ncally inevitable but for the possible exercise of limited\nremnants of equitable discretion vested in the Attorney\nGeneral to cancel removal for noncitizens convicted of\nparticular classes of offenses.6 See 8 U. S. C. §1229b.\nSubject to limited exceptions, this discretionary relief is\nnot available for an offense related to trafficking in a\ncontrolled substance. See §1101(a)(43)(B); §1228.\n   These changes to our immigration law have dramati\ncally raised the stakes of a noncitizen’s criminal convic\ntion. The importance of accurate legal advice for nonciti\nzens accused of crimes has never been more important.\nThese changes confirm our view that, as a matter of fed\neral law, deportation is an integral part—indeed, some\ntimes the most important part 7—of the penalty that may\nbe imposed on noncitizen defendants who plead guilty to\nspecified crimes.\n\n——————\n206. The JRAD procedure, codified in 8 U. S. C. §1251(b) (1994 ed.),\napplied only to the “provisions of subsection (a)(4),” the crimes-of-moral\nturpitude provision. 66 Stat. 208; see United States v. O’Rourke, 213\nF. 2d 759, 762 (CA8 1954) (recognizing that, under the 1952 Act,\nnarcotics offenses were no longer eligible for JRADs).\n  6 The changes to our immigration law have also involved a change in\n\nnomenclature; the statutory text now uses the term “removal” rather\nthan “deportation.” See Calcano-Martinez v. INS, 533 U. S. 348, 350,\nn. 1 (2001).\n  7 See Brief for Asian American Justice Center et al. as Amici Curiae\n\n12–27 (providing real-world examples).\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

Richardson, 397 U. S. 759, 771 (1970); Strick\nland, 466 U. S., at 686. The Supreme Court of Kentucky\nrejected Padilla’s ineffectiveness claim on the ground that\nthe advice he sought about the risk of deportation con\ncerned only collateral matters, i.e., those matters not\nwithin the sentencing authority of the state trial court.8\n253 S. W. 3d, at 483–484 (citing Commonwealth v. Fuar\ntado, 170 S. W. 3d 384 (2005)). In its view, “collateral\nconsequences are outside the scope of representation\nrequired by the Sixth Amendment,” and, therefore, the\n“failure of defense counsel to advise the defendant of\npossible deportation consequences is not cognizable as a\nclaim for ineffective assistance of counsel.” 253 S. W. 3d,\nat 483. The Kentucky high court is far from alone in this\nview.9\n——————\n   8 There is some disagreement among the courts over how to distin\n\nguish between direct and collateral consequences. See Roberts, Igno\nrance is Effectively Bliss: Collateral Consequences, Silence, and Misin\nformation in the Guilty-Plea Process, 95 Iowa L. Rev. 119, 124, n. 15\n(2009). The disagreement over how to apply the direct/collateral\ndistinction has no bearing on the disposition of this case because, as\neven JUSTICE ALITO agrees, counsel must, at the very least, advise a\nnoncitizen “defendant that a criminal conviction may have adverse\nimmigration consequences,” post, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment).\nSee also post, at 14 (“I do not mean to suggest that the Sixth Amend\nment does no more than require defense counsel to avoid misinforma\ntion”). In his concurring opinion, JUSTICE ALITO has thus departed from\nthe strict rule applied by the Supreme Court of Kentucky and in the\ntwo federal cases that he cites, post, at 2.\n   9 See, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez, 202 F. 3d 20 (CA1 2000); United\n\nStates v. Del Rosario, 902 F. 2d 55 (CADC 1990); United States v.\nYearwood, 863 F. 2d 6 (CA4 1988); Santos-Sanchez v.

KENTUCKY\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   We, however, have never applied a distinction between\ndirect and collateral consequences to define the scope of\nconstitutionally “reasonable professional assistance”\nrequired under Strickland, 466 U. S., at 689. Whether\nthat distinction is appropriate is a question we need not\nconsider in this case because of the unique nature of\ndeportation.\n   We have long recognized that deportation is a particu\nlarly severe “penalty,” Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149\nU. S. 698, 740 (1893); but it is not, in a strict sense, a\ncriminal sanction. Although removal proceedings are civil\nin nature, see INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U. S. 1032, 1038\n(1984), deportation is nevertheless intimately related to\nthe criminal process. Our law has enmeshed criminal\nconvictions and the penalty of deportation for nearly a\ncentury, see Part I, supra, at 2–7. And, importantly,\nrecent changes in our immigration law have made removal\nnearly an automatic result for a broad class of noncitizen\noffenders. Thus, we find it “most difficult” to divorce the\npenalty from the conviction in the deportation context.\nUnited States v. Russell, 686 F. 2d 35, 38 (CADC 1982).\nMoreover, we are quite confident that noncitizen defen\ndants facing a risk of deportation for a particular offense\nfind it even more difficult. See St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 322\n(“There can be little doubt that, as a general matter, alien\ndefendants considering whether to enter into a plea\nagreement are acutely aware of the immigration conse\nquences of their convictions”).\n   Deportation as a consequence of a criminal conviction is,\nbecause of its close connection to the criminal process,\nuniquely difficult to classify as either a direct or a collat\neral consequence.

We conclude that\nadvice regarding deportation is not categorically removed\nfrom the ambit of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\nStrickland applies to Padilla’s claim.\n                               III\n   Under Strickland, we first determine whether counsel’s\nrepresentation “fell below an objective standard of reason\nableness.” 466 U. S., at 688. Then we ask whether “there\nis a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unpro\nfessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have\nbeen different.” Id., at 694. The first prong—constitu\ntional deficiency—is necessarily linked to the practice and\nexpectations of the legal community: “The proper measure\nof attorney performance remains simply reasonableness\nunder prevailing professional norms.” Id., at 688. We long\nhave recognized that “[p]revailing norms of practice as\nreflected in American Bar Association standards and the\nlike . . . are guides to determining what is reasonable . . . .”\nIbid.; Bobby v.

Ibid.,\nn. 50.\n   In the instant case, the terms of the relevant immigra\ntion statute are succinct, clear, and explicit in defining the\nremoval consequence for Padilla’s conviction.           See 8\nU. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(B)(i) (“Any alien who at any time after\nadmission has been convicted of a violation of (or a con\nspiracy or attempt to violate) any law or regulation of a\nState, the United States or a foreign country relating to a\ncontrolled substance . . . , other than a single offense in\nvolving possession for one’s own use of 30 grams or less of\nmarijuana, is deportable”). Padilla’s counsel could have\neasily determined that his plea would make him eligible\nfor deportation simply from reading the text of the statute,\nwhich addresses not some broad classification of crimes\nbut specifically commands removal for all controlled sub\nstances convictions except for the most trivial of mari\njuana possession offenses.        Instead, Padilla’s counsel\nprovided him false assurance that his conviction would not\nresult in his removal from this country. This is not a hard\ncase in which to find deficiency: The consequences of\nPadilla’s plea could easily be determined from reading the\nremoval statute, his deportation was presumptively man\ndatory, and his counsel’s advice was incorrect.\n   Immigration law can be complex, and it is a legal spe\ncialty of its own. Some members of the bar who represent\nclients facing criminal charges, in either state or federal\ncourt or both, may not be well versed in it. There will,\ntherefore, undoubtedly be numerous situations in which\nthe deportation consequences of a particular plea are\nunclear or uncertain. The duty of the private practitioner\nin such cases is more limited. When the law is not suc\ncinct and straightforward (as it is in many of the scenarios\n12                     PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nposited by JUSTICE ALITO), a criminal defense attorney\nneed do no more than advise a noncitizen client that pend\ning criminal charges may carry a risk of adverse immigra\ntion consequences.10 But when the deportation conse\nquence is truly clear, as it was in this case, the duty to\ngive correct advice is equally clear.\n   Accepting his allegations as true, Padilla has suffi\nciently alleged constitutional deficiency to satisfy the first\nprong of Strickland. Whether Padilla is entitled to relief\non his claim will depend on whether he can satisfy Strick\nland’s second prong, prejudice, a matter we leave to the\nKentucky courts to consider in the first instance.\n                              IV\n   The Solicitor General has urged us to conclude that\nStrickland applies to Padilla’s claim only to the extent\nthat he has alleged affirmative misadvice. In the United\nStates’ view, “counsel is not constitutionally required to\nprovide advice on matters that will not be decided in the\ncriminal case . . . ,” though counsel is required to provide\naccurate advice if she chooses to discusses these matters.\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 10.\n   Respondent and Padilla both find the Solicitor General’s\nproposed rule unpersuasive, although it has support\namong the lower courts. See, e.g., United States v. Couto,\n311 F. 3d 179, 188 (CA2 2002); United States v. Kwan, 407\nF. 3d 1005 (CA9 2005); Sparks v. Sowders, 852 F. 2d 882\n(CA6 1988); United States v.

We do not share that view, but we\nagree that there is no relevant difference “between an act\nof commission and an act of omission” in this context. Id.,\nat 30; Strickland, 466 U. S., at 690 (“The court must then\ndetermine whether, in light of all the circumstances, the\nidentified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of\nprofessionally competent assistance”); see also State v.\nParedez, 2004–NMSC–036, 136 N. M. 533, 538–539.\n   A holding limited to affirmative misadvice would invite\ntwo absurd results. First, it would give counsel an incen\ntive to remain silent on matters of great importance, even\nwhen answers are readily available. Silence under these\ncircumstances would be fundamentally at odds with the\ncritical obligation of counsel to advise the client of “the\nadvantages and disadvantages of a plea agreement.”\nLibretti v. United States, 516 U. S. 29, 50–51 (1995).\nWhen attorneys know that their clients face possible exile\nfrom this country and separation from their families, they\nshould not be encouraged to say nothing at all.11 Second,\nit would deny a class of clients least able to represent\nthemselves the most rudimentary advice on deportation\neven when it is readily available. It is quintessentially the\nduty of counsel to provide her client with available advice\nabout an issue like deportation and the failure to do so\n“clearly satisfies the first prong of the Strickland analy\nsis.” Hill v.

Tr. of Oral Arg. 37–38. We think the same result\nshould follow when the stakes are not life and death but merely “ban\nishment or exile,” Delgadillo v. Carmichael, 332 U.

KENTUCKY\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nconcurring in judgment).\n   We have given serious consideration to the concerns\nthat the Solicitor General, respondent, and amici have\nstressed regarding the importance of protecting the final\nity of convictions obtained through guilty pleas. We con\nfronted a similar “floodgates” concern in Hill, see id., at\n58, but nevertheless applied Strickland to a claim that\ncounsel had failed to advise the client regarding his parole\neligibility before he pleaded guilty.12\n   A flood did not follow in that decision’s wake. Sur\nmounting Strickland’s high bar is never an easy task.\nSee, e.g., 466 U. S., at 689 (“Judicial scrutiny of counsel’s\nperformance must be highly deferential”); id., at 693\n(observing that “[a]ttorney errors . . . are as likely to be\nutterly harmless in a particular case as they are to be\nprejudicial”). Moreover, to obtain relief on this type of\nclaim, a petitioner must convince the court that a decision\nto reject the plea bargain would have been rational under\nthe circumstances. See Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U. S.\n470, 480, 486 (2000). There is no reason to doubt that\nlower courts—now quite experienced with applying Strick\nland—can effectively and efficiently use its framework to\n——————\n  12 However, we concluded that, even though Strickland applied to\n\npetitioner’s claim, he had not sufficiently alleged prejudice to satisfy\nStrickland’s second prong. Hill, 474 U. S., at 59–60. This disposition\nfurther underscores the fact that it is often quite difficult for petitioners\nwho have acknowledged their guilt to satisfy Strickland’s prejudice\nprong.\n  JUSTICE ALITO believes that the Court misreads Hill, post, at 10–11.\nIn Hill, the Court recognized—for the first time—that Strickland\napplies to advice respecting a guilty plea. 474 U. S., at 58 (“We hold,\ntherefore, that the two-part Strickland v. Washington test applies to\nchallenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel”).\nIt is true that Hill does not control the question before us. But its\nimport is nevertheless clear. Whether Strickland applies to Padilla’s\nclaim follows from Hill, regardless of the fact that the Hill Court did\nnot resolve the particular question respecting misadvice that was\nbefore it.\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

For at least the past 15 years,\nprofessional norms have generally imposed an obligation\non counsel to provide advice on the deportation conse\nquences of a client’s plea. See, supra, at 11–13. We\nshould, therefore, presume that counsel satisfied their\nobligation to render competent advice at the time their\nclients considered pleading guilty. Strickland, 466 U. S.,\nat 689.\n   Likewise, although we must be especially careful about\nrecognizing new grounds for attacking the validity of\nguilty pleas, in the 25 years since we first applied Strick\nland to claims of ineffective assistance at the plea stage,\npractice has shown that pleas are less frequently the\nsubject of collateral challenges than convictions obtained\nafter a trial. Pleas account for nearly 95% of all criminal\nconvictions.13 But they account for only approximately\n30% of the habeas petitions filed.14 The nature of relief\nsecured by a successful collateral challenge to a guilty\nplea—an opportunity to withdraw the plea and proceed to\ntrial—imposes its own significant limiting principle: Those\nwho collaterally attack their guilty pleas lose the benefit of\nthe bargain obtained as a result of the plea. Thus, a dif\nferent calculus informs whether it is wise to challenge a\n\n——————\n   13 See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Sourcebook of\n\nCriminal Justice Statistics 2003, p. 418 (31st ed. 2005) (Table 5.17)\n(only approximately 5%, or 8,612 out of 68,533, of federal criminal\nprosecutions go to trial); id., at 450 (Table 5.46) (only approximately 5%\nof all state felony criminal prosecutions go to trial).\n   14 See V. Flango, National Center for State Courts, Habeas Corpus in\n\nState and Federal Courts 36–38 (1994) (demonstrating that 5% of\ndefendants whose conviction was the result of a trial account for ap\nproximately 70% of the habeas petitions filed).\n16                     PADILLA v.

By bringing deporta\ntion consequences into this process, the defense and prose\ncution may well be able to reach agreements that better\nsatisfy the interests of both parties. As in this case, a\ncriminal episode may provide the basis for multiple\ncharges, of which only a subset mandate deportation\nfollowing conviction. Counsel who possess the most rudi\nmentary understanding of the deportation consequences of\na particular criminal offense may be able to plea bargain\ncreatively with the prosecutor in order to craft a conviction\nand sentence that reduce the likelihood of deportation, as\nby avoiding a conviction for an offense that automatically\ntriggers the removal consequence. At the same time, the\nthreat of deportation may provide the defendant with a\npowerful incentive to plead guilty to an offense that does\nnot mandate that penalty in exchange for a dismissal of a\ncharge that does.\n   In sum, we have long recognized that the negotiation of\na plea bargain is a critical phase of litigation for purposes\nof the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of\ncounsel. Hill, 474 U. S., at 57; see also Richardson, 397\nU. S., at 770–771. The severity of deportation—“the\nequivalent of banishment or exile,” Delgadillo v. Carmi\nchael, 332 U. S. 388, 390–391 (1947)—only underscores\nhow critical it is for counsel to inform her noncitizen client\nthat he faces a risk of deportation.15\n——————\n  15 To this end, we find it significant that the plea form currently used\n\nin Kentucky courts provides notice of possible immigration conse\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

Our longstanding Sixth\nAmendment precedents, the seriousness of deportation as\na consequence of a criminal plea, and the concomitant\nimpact of deportation on families living lawfully in this\ncountry demand no less.\n   Taking as true the basis for his motion for postconvic\ntion relief, we have little difficulty concluding that Padilla\nhas sufficiently alleged that his counsel was constitution\nally deficient. Whether Padilla is entitled to relief will\ndepend on whether he can demonstrate prejudice as a\nresult thereof, a question we do not reach because it was\nnot passed on below.

Washington, 466 U. S. 668\n(1984), if the attorney misleads a noncitizen client regard\ning the removal consequences of a conviction. In my view,\nsuch an attorney must (1) refrain from unreasonably\nproviding incorrect advice and (2) advise the defendant\nthat a criminal conviction may have adverse immigration\nconsequences and that, if the alien wants advice on this\nissue, the alien should consult an immigration attorney. I\ndo not agree with the Court that the attorney must at\ntempt to explain what those consequences may be. As the\nCourt concedes, “[i]mmigration law can be complex”; “it is\na legal specialty of its own”; and “[s]ome members of the\nbar who represent clients facing criminal charges, in\neither state or federal court or both, may not be well\nversed in it.” Ante, at 11. The Court nevertheless holds\nthat a criminal defense attorney must provide advice in\nthis specialized area in those cases in which the law is\n“succinct and straightforward”—but not, perhaps, in other\nsituations. Ante, at 11–12. This vague, halfway test will\nlead to much confusion and needless litigation.\n2                   PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n                               I\n   Under Strickland, an attorney provides ineffective\nassistance if the attorney’s representation does not meet\nreasonable professional standards. 466 U. S., at 688.\nUntil today, the longstanding and unanimous position of\nthe federal courts was that reasonable defense counsel\ngenerally need only advise a client about the direct conse\nquences of a criminal conviction. See, e.g., United States v.\nGonzalez, 202 F. 3d 20, 28 (CA1 2000) (ineffective\nassistance-of-counsel claim fails if “based on an attorney’s\nfailure to advise a client of his plea’s immigration conse\nquences”); United States v. Banda, 1 F. 3d 354, 355 (CA5\n1993) (holding that “an attorney’s failure to advise a client\nthat deportation is a possible consequence of a guilty plea\ndoes not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel”); see\ngenerally Chin & Holmes, Effective Assistance of Counsel\nand the Consequences of Guilty Pleas, 87 Cornell L. Rev.\n697, 699 (2002) (hereinafter Chin & Holmes) (noting that\n“virtually all jurisdictions”—including “eleven federal\ncircuits, more than thirty states, and the District of Co\nlumbia”—“hold that defense counsel need not discuss with\ntheir clients the collateral consequences of a conviction,”\nincluding deportation). While the line between “direct”\nand “collateral” consequences is not always clear, see ante,\nat 7, n. 8, the collateral-consequences rule expresses an\nimportant truth: Criminal defense attorneys have exper\ntise regarding the conduct of criminal proceedings. They\nare not expected to possess—and very often do not pos\nsess—expertise in other areas of the law, and it is unreal\nistic to expect them to provide expert advice on matters\nthat lie outside their area of training and experience.\n   This case happens to involve removal, but criminal\nconvictions can carry a wide variety of consequences other\nthan conviction and sentencing, including civil commit\nment, civil forfeiture, the loss of the right to vote, disquali\nfication from public benefits, ineligibility to possess fire\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\narms, dishonorable discharge from the Armed Forces, and\nloss of business or professional licenses. Chin & Holmes\n705–706. A criminal conviction may also severely damage\na defendant’s reputation and thus impair the defendant’s\nability to obtain future employment or business opportuni\nties. All of those consequences are “seriou[s],” see ante, at\n17, but this Court has never held that a criminal defense\nattorney’s Sixth Amendment duties extend to providing\nadvice about such matters.\n   The Court tries to justify its dramatic departure from\nprecedent by pointing to the views of various professional\norganizations. See ante, at 9 (“The weight of prevailing\nprofessional norms supports the view that counsel must\nadvise her client regarding the risk of deportation”).\nHowever, ascertaining the level of professional competence\nrequired by the Sixth Amendment is ultimately a task for\nthe courts. E.g., Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U. S. 470, 477\n(2000). Although we may appropriately consult standards\npromulgated by private bar groups, we cannot delegate to\nthese groups our task of determining what the Constitu\ntion commands. See Strickland, supra, at 688 (explaining\nthat “[p]revailing norms of practice as reflected in Ameri\ncan Bar Association standards . . . are guides to determin\ning what is reasonable, but they are only guides”). And we\nmust recognize that such standards may represent only\nthe aspirations of a bar group rather than an empirical\nassessment of actual practice.\n   Even if the only relevant consideration were “prevailing\nprofessional norms,” it is hard to see how those norms can\nsupport the duty the Court today imposes on defense\ncounsel. Because many criminal defense attorneys have\nlittle understanding of immigration law, see ante, at 11, it\nshould follow that a criminal defense attorney who re\nfrains from providing immigration advice does not violate\nprevailing professional norms. But the Court’s opinion\nwould not just require defense counsel to warn the client\n4                  PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nof a general risk of removal; it would also require counsel\nin at least some cases, to specify what the removal conse\nquences of a conviction would be. See ante, at 11–12.\n   The Court’s new approach is particularly problematic\nbecause providing advice on whether a conviction for a\nparticular offense will make an alien removable is often\nquite complex. “Most crimes affecting immigration status\nare not specifically mentioned by the [Immigration and\nNationality Act (INA)], but instead fall under a broad\ncategory of crimes, such as crimes involving moral turpi\ntude or aggravated felonies.” M. Garcia & L. Eig, CRS\nReport for Congress, Immigration Consequences of Crimi\nnal Activity (Sept. 20, 2006) (summary) (emphasis in\noriginal). As has been widely acknowledged, determining\nwhether a particular crime is an “aggravated felony” or a\n“crime involving moral turpitude [(CIMT)]” is not an easy\ntask. See R. McWhirter, ABA, The Criminal Lawyer’s\nGuide to Immigration Law: Questions and Answers 128\n(2d ed. 2006) (hereinafter ABA Guidebook) (“Because of\nthe increased complexity of aggravated felony law, this\nedition devotes a new [30-page] chapter to the subject”);\nid., §5.2, at 146 (stating that the aggravated felony list at\n8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43) is not clear with respect to several\nof the listed categories, that “the term ‘aggravated felonies’\ncan include misdemeanors,” and that the determination of\nwhether a crime is an “aggravated felony” is made “even\nmore difficult” because “several agencies and courts inter\npret the statute,” including Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA),\nand Federal Circuit and district courts considering immi\ngration-law and criminal-law issues); ABA Guidebook\n§4.65, at 130 (“Because nothing is ever simple with immi\ngration law, the terms ‘conviction,’ ‘moral turpitude,’ and\n‘single scheme of criminal misconduct’ are terms of art”);\nid., §4.67, at 130 (“[T]he term ‘moral turpitude’ evades\nprecise definition”).\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   Defense counsel who consults a guidebook on whether a\nparticular crime is an “aggravated felony” will often find\nthat the answer is not ‘‘easily ascertained.” For example,\nthe ABA Guidebook answers the question “Does simple\npossession count as an aggravated felony?” as follows:\n“Yes, at least in the Ninth Circuit.” §5.35, at 160 (empha\nsis added). After a dizzying paragraph that attempts to\nexplain the evolution of the Ninth Circuit’s view, the ABA\nGuidebook continues: “Adding to the confusion, however,\nis that the Ninth Circuit has conflicting opinions depend\ning on the context on whether simple drug possession\nconstitutes an aggravated felony under 8 U. S. C.\n§1101(a)(43).” Id., §5.35, at 161 (citing cases distinguish\ning between whether a simple possession offense is an\naggravated felony “for immigration purposes” or for “sen\ntencing purposes”). The ABA Guidebook then proceeds to\nexplain that “attempted possession,” id., §5.36, at 161\n(emphasis added), of a controlled substance is an aggra\nvated felony, while “[c]onviction under the federal acces\nsory after the fact statute is probably not an aggravated\nfelony, but a conviction for accessory after the fact to the\nmanufacture of methamphetamine is an aggravated fel\nony,” id., §537, at 161 (emphasis added). Conspiracy or\nattempt to commit drug trafficking are aggravated felo\nnies, but “[s]olicitation is not a drug-trafficking offense\nbecause a generic solicitation offense is not an offense\nrelated to a controlled substance and therefore not an\naggravated felony.” Id., §5.41, at 162.\n   Determining whether a particular crime is one involving\nmoral turpitude is no easier. See id., at 134 (“Writing bad\nchecks may or may not be a CIMT” (emphasis added));\nibid. (“[R]eckless assault coupled with an element of in\njury, but not serious injury, is probably not a CIMT” (em\nphasis added)); id., at 135 (misdemeanor driving under the\ninfluence is generally not a CIMT, but may be a CIMT if\nthe DUI results in injury or if the driver knew that his\n6                       PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                    ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nlicense had been suspended or revoked); id., at 136 (“If\nthere is no element of actual injury, the endangerment\noffense may not be a CIMT” (emphasis added)); ibid.\n(“Whether [a child abuse] conviction involves moral turpi\ntude may depend on the subsection under which the indi\nvidual is convicted. Child abuse done with criminal negli\ngence probably is not a CIMT” (emphasis added)).\n   Many other terms of the INA are similarly ambiguous or\nmay be confusing to practitioners not versed in the intri\ncacies of immigration law. To take just a few examples, it\nmay be hard, in some cases, for defense counsel even to\ndetermine whether a client is an alien,1 or whether a\nparticular state disposition will result in a “conviction” for\npurposes of federal immigration law.2 The task of offering\nadvice about the immigration consequences of a criminal\nconviction is further complicated by other problems, in\ncluding significant variations among Circuit interpreta\ntions of federal immigration statutes; the frequency with\n——————\n    1 Citizensare not deportable, but “[q]uestions of citizenship are not\nalways simple.” ABA Guidebook §4.20, at 113 (explaining that U.S.\ncitizenship conferred by blood is “ ‘derivative,’ ” and that “[d]erivative\ncitizenship depends on a number of confusing factors, including\nwhether the citizen parent was the mother or father, the immigration\nlaws in effect at the time of the parents’ and/or defendant’s birth, and\nthe parents’ marital status”).\n   2 “A disposition that is not a ‘conviction,’ under state law may still be\n\na ‘conviction’ for immigration purposes.” Id., §4.32, at 117 (citing\nMatter of Salazar, 23 I. & N. Dec. 223, 231 (BIA 2002) (en banc)). For\nexample, state law may define the term “conviction” not to include a\ndeferred adjudication, but such an adjudication would be deemed a\nconviction for purposes of federal immigration law. See ABA Guide\nbook §4.37; accord, D. Kesselbrenner & L. Rosenberg, Immigration Law\nand Crimes §2:1, p. 2–2 (2008) (hereinafter Immigration Law and\nCrimes) (“A practitioner or respondent will not even know whether the\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) or the Executive Office for\nImmigration Review (EOIR) will treat a particular state disposition as\na conviction for immigration purposes. In fact, the [BIA] treats certain\nstate criminal dispositions as convictions even though the state treats\nthe same disposition as a dismissal”).\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)             7\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nwhich immigration law changes; different rules governing\nthe immigration consequences of juvenile, first-offender,\nand foreign convictions; and the relationship between the\n“length and type of sentence” and the determination\n“whether [an alien] is subject to removal, eligible for relief\nfrom removal, or qualified to become a naturalized citi\nzen,” Immigration Law and Crimes §2:1, at 2–2 to 2–3.\n   In short, the professional organizations and guidebooks\non which the Court so heavily relies are right to say that\n“nothing is ever simple with immigration law”—including\nthe determination whether immigration law clearly makes\na particular offense removable. ABA Guidebook §4.65, at\n130; Immigration Law and Crimes §2:1. I therefore can\nnot agree with the Court’s apparent view that the Sixth\nAmendment requires criminal defense attorneys to pro\nvide immigration advice.\n   The Court tries to downplay the severity of the burden it\nimposes on defense counsel by suggesting that the scope of\ncounsel’s duty to offer advice concerning deportation con\nsequences may turn on how hard it is to determine those\nconsequences. Where “the terms of the relevant immigra\ntion statute are succinct, clear, and explicit in defining the\nremoval consequence[s]” of a conviction, the Court says,\ncounsel has an affirmative duty to advise the client that\nhe will be subject to deportation as a result of the plea.\nAnte, at 11. But “[w]hen the law is not succinct and\nstraightforward . . . , a criminal defense attorney need do\nno more than advise a noncitizen client that pending\ncriminal charges may carry a risk of adverse immigration\nconsequences.” Ante, at 11–12. This approach is problem\natic for at least four reasons.\n   First, it will not always be easy to tell whether a par\nticular statutory provision is “succinct, clear, and explicit.”\nHow can an attorney who lacks general immigration law\nexpertise be sure that a seemingly clear statutory provi\nsion actually means what it seems to say when read in\n8                 PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n               ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nisolation? What if the application of the provision to a\nparticular case is not clear but a cursory examination of\ncase law or administrative decisions would provide a\ndefinitive answer? See Immigration Law and Crimes §2:1,\nat 2–2 (“Unfortunately, a practitioner or respondent can\nnot tell easily whether a conviction is for a removable\noffense. . . . [T]he cautious practitioner or apprehensive\nrespondent will not know conclusively the future immigra\ntion consequences of a guilty plea”).\n   Second, if defense counsel must provide advice regard\ning only one of the many collateral consequences of a\ncriminal conviction, many defendants are likely to be\nmisled. To take just one example, a conviction for a par\nticular offense may render an alien excludable but not\nremovable. If an alien charged with such an offense is\nadvised only that pleading guilty to such an offense will\nnot result in removal, the alien may be induced to enter a\nguilty plea without realizing that a consequence of the\nplea is that the alien will be unable to reenter the United\nStates if the alien returns to his or her home country for\nany reason, such as to visit an elderly parent or to attend\na funeral. See ABA Guidebook §4.14, at 111 (“Often the\nalien is both excludable and removable. At times, how\never, the lists are different. Thus, the oddity of an alien\nthat is inadmissible but not deportable. This alien should\nnot leave the United States because the government will\nnot let him back in” (emphasis in original)). Incomplete\nlegal advice may be worse than no advice at all because it\nmay mislead and may dissuade the client from seeking\nadvice from a more knowledgeable source.\n   Third, the Court’s rigid constitutional rule could inad\nvertently head off more promising ways of addressing the\nunderlying problem—such as statutory or administrative\nreforms requiring trial judges to inform a defendant on the\nrecord that a guilty plea may carry adverse immigration\nconsequences. As amici point out, “28 states and the\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nDistrict of Columbia have already adopted rules, plea\nforms, or statutes requiring courts to advise criminal\ndefendants of the possible immigration consequences of\ntheir pleas.” Brief for State of Louisiana et al. 25; accord,\nChin & Holmes 708 (“A growing number of states require\nadvice about deportation by statute or court rule”). A\nnonconstitutional rule requiring trial judges to inform\ndefendants on the record of the risk of adverse immigra\ntion consequences can ensure that a defendant receives\nneeded information without putting a large number of\ncriminal convictions at risk; and because such a warning\nwould be given on the record, courts would not later have\nto determine whether the defendant was misrepresenting\nthe advice of counsel. Likewise, flexible statutory proce\ndures for withdrawing guilty pleas might give courts\nappropriate discretion to determine whether the interests\nof justice would be served by allowing a particular defen\ndant to withdraw a plea entered into on the basis of in\ncomplete information. Cf. United States v. Russell, 686\nF. 2d 35, 39–40 (CADC 1982) (explaining that a district\ncourt’s discretion to set aside a guilty plea under the Fed\neral Rules of Criminal Procedure should be guided by,\namong other considerations, “the possible existence of\nprejudice to the government’s case as a result of the de\nfendant’s untimely request to stand trial” and “the\nstrength of the defendant’s reason for withdrawing the\nplea, including whether the defendant asserts his inno\ncence of the charge”).\n   Fourth, the Court’s decision marks a major upheaval in\nSixth Amendment law. This Court decided Strickland in\n1984, but the majority does not cite a single case, from this\nor any other federal court, holding that criminal defense\ncounsel’s failure to provide advice concerning the removal\nconsequences of a criminal conviction violates a defen\ndant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel. As noted above,\nthe Court’s view has been rejected by every Federal Court\n10                 PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nof Appeals to have considered the issue thus far. See, e.g.,\nGonzalez, 202 F. 3d, at 28; Banda, 1 F. 3d, at 355; Chin &\nHolmes 697, 699. The majority appropriately acknowl\nedges that the lower courts are “now quite experienced\nwith applying Strickland,” ante, at 14, but it casually\ndismisses the longstanding and unanimous position of\nthe lower federal courts with respect to the scope of\ncriminal defense counsel’s duty to advise on collateral\nconsequences.\n   The majority seeks to downplay its dramatic expansion\nof the scope of criminal defense counsel’s duties under the\nSixth Amendment by claiming that this Court in Hill v.\nLockhart, 474 U. S. 52 (1985), similarly “applied Strick\nland to a claim that counsel had failed to advise the client\nregarding his parole eligibility before he pleaded guilty.”\nAnte, at 14. That characterization of Hill obscures much\nmore than it reveals. The issue in Hill was whether a\ncriminal defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel\nwas violated where counsel misinformed the client about\nhis eligibility for parole. The Court found it “unnecessary\nto determine whether there may be circumstances under\nwhich erroneous advice by counsel as to parole eligibility\nmay be deemed constitutionally ineffective assistance of\ncounsel, because in the present case we conclude that\npetitioner’s allegations are insufficient to satisfy the\nStrickland v. Washington requirement of ‘prejudice.’ ” 474\nU. S., at 60. Given that Hill expressly and unambiguously\nrefused to decide whether criminal defense counsel must\navoid misinforming his or her client as to one consequence\nof a criminal conviction (parole eligibility), that case\nplainly provides no support whatsoever for the proposition\nthat counsel must affirmatively advise his or her client as\nto another collateral consequence (removal).        By the\nCourt’s strange logic, Hill would support its decision here\neven if the Court had held that misadvice concerning\nparole eligibility does not make counsel’s performance\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nobjectively unreasonable. After all, the Court still would\nhave “applied Strickland” to the facts of the case at hand.\n                                II\n  While mastery of immigration law is not required by\nStrickland, several considerations support the conclu\nsion that affirmative misadvice regarding the removal\nconsequences of a conviction may constitute ineffective\nassistance.\n  First, a rule prohibiting affirmative misadvice regarding\na matter as crucial to the defendant’s plea decision as\ndeportation appears faithful to the scope and nature of the\nSixth Amendment duty this Court has recognized in its\npast cases. In particular, we have explained that “a guilty\nplea cannot be attacked as based on inadequate legal\nadvice unless counsel was not ‘a reasonably competent\nattorney’ and the advice was not ‘within the range of\ncompetence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.’ ”\nStrickland, 466 U. S., at 687 (quoting McMann v. Richard\nson, 397 U. S. 759, 770, 771 (1970); emphasis added). As\nthe Court appears to acknowledge, thorough understand\ning of the intricacies of immigration law is not “within the\nrange of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal\ncases.” See ante, at 11 (“Immigration law can be complex,\nand it is a legal specialty of its own. Some members of the\nbar who represent clients facing criminal charges, in\neither state or federal court or both, may not be well\nversed in it”). By contrast, reasonably competent attor\nneys should know that it is not appropriate or responsible\nto hold themselves out as authorities on a difficult and\ncomplicated subject matter with which they are not famil\niar. Candor concerning the limits of one’s professional\nexpertise, in other words, is within the range of duties\nreasonably expected of defense attorneys in criminal cases.\nAs the dissenting judge on the Kentucky Supreme Court\nput it, “I do not believe it is too much of a burden to place\n12                 PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\non our defense bar the duty to say, ‘I do not know.’ ” 253\nS. W. 3d 482, 485 (2008).\n   Second, incompetent advice distorts the defendant’s\ndecisionmaking process and seems to call the fairness and\nintegrity of the criminal proceeding itself into question.\nSee Strickland, 466 U. S., at 686 (“In giving meaning to\nthe requirement [of effective assistance of counsel], we\nmust take its purpose—to ensure a fair trial—as the\nguide”). When a defendant opts to plead guilty without\ndefinitive information concerning the likely effects of the\nplea, the defendant can fairly be said to assume the risk\nthat the conviction may carry indirect consequences of\nwhich he or she is not aware. That is not the case when a\ndefendant bases the decision to plead guilty on counsel’s\nexpress misrepresentation that the defendant will not be\nremovable. In the latter case, it seems hard to say that\nthe plea was entered with the advice of constitutionally\ncompetent counsel—or that it embodies a voluntary and\nintelligent decision to forsake constitutional rights. See\nibid. (“The benchmark for judging any claim of ineffec\ntiveness must be whether counsel’s conduct so under\nmined the proper functioning of the adversarial process\nthat the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just\nresult”).\n   Third, a rule prohibiting unreasonable misadvice re\ngarding exceptionally important collateral matters would\nnot deter or interfere with ongoing political and adminis\ntrative efforts to devise fair and reasonable solutions to\nthe difficult problem posed by defendants who plead\nguilty without knowing of certain important collateral\nconsequences.\n   Finally, the conclusion that affirmative misadvice re\ngarding the removal consequences of a conviction can give\nrise to ineffective assistance would, unlike the Court’s\napproach, not require any upheaval in the law. As the\nSolicitor General points out, “[t]he vast majority of the\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    13\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nlower courts considering claims of ineffective assistance in\nthe plea context have [distinguished] between defense\ncounsel who remain silent and defense counsel who give\naffirmative misadvice.” Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 8 (citing cases). At least three Courts of Appeals\nhave held that affirmative misadvice on immigration\nmatters can give rise to ineffective assistance of counsel,\nat least in some circumstances.3 And several other Cir-\ncuits have held that affirmative misadvice concerning\nnonimmigration consequences of a conviction can violate\nthe Sixth Amendment even if those consequences might be\ndeemed “collateral.”4 By contrast, it appears that no court\nof appeals holds that affirmative misadvice concerning\ncollateral consequences in general and removal in particu-\nlar can never give rise to ineffective assistance. In short,\n——————\n  3 See  United States v. Kwan, 407 F. 3d 1005, 1015–1017 (CA9 2005);\nUnited States v. Couto, 311 F. 3d 179, 188 (CA2 2002); Downs-Morgan\nv.

United\nStates, 548 F. 3d 327, 333–334 (CA5 2008) (concluding that counsel’s\nadvice was not objectively unreasonable where counsel did not purport\nto answer questions about immigration law, did not claim any expertise\nin immigration law, and simply warned of “possible” deportation\nconsequence; use of the word “possible” was not an affirmative misrep-\nresentation, even though it could indicate that deportation was not a\ncertain consequence).\n   4 See Hill v. Lockhart, 894 F. 2d 1009, 1010 (CA8 1990) (en banc)\n\n(“[T]he erroneous parole-eligibility advice given to Mr. Hill was ineffec-\ntive assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington”); Sparks v.\nSowders, 852 F. 2d 882, 885 (CA6 1988) (“[G]ross misadvice concerning\nparole eligibility can amount to ineffective assistance of counsel”); id.,\nat 886 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (“When the maximum possible expo-\nsure is overstated, the defendant might well be influenced to accept a\nplea agreement he would otherwise reject”); Strader v. Garrison, 611\nF. 2d 61, 65 (CA4 1979) (“[T]hough parole eligibility dates are collateral\nconsequences of the entry of a guilty plea of which a defendant need not\nbe informed if he does not inquire, when he is grossly misinformed\nabout it by his lawyer, and relies upon that misinformation, he is\ndeprived of his constitutional right to counsel”).\n14                 PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe considered and thus far unanimous view of the lower\nfederal courts charged with administering Strickland\nclearly supports the conclusion that that Kentucky Su\npreme Court’s position goes too far.\n   In concluding that affirmative misadvice regarding the\nremoval consequences of a criminal conviction may consti\ntute ineffective assistance, I do not mean to suggest that\nthe Sixth Amendment does no more than require defense\ncounsel to avoid misinformation. When a criminal defense\nattorney is aware that a client is an alien, the attorney\nshould advise the client that a criminal conviction may\nhave adverse consequences under the immigration laws\nand that the client should consult an immigration special\nist if the client wants advice on that subject. By putting\nthe client on notice of the danger of removal, such advice\nwould significantly reduce the chance that the client\nwould plead guilty under a mistaken premise.\n                              III\n  In sum, a criminal defense attorney should not be re\nquired to provide advice on immigration law, a complex\nspecialty that generally lies outside the scope of a criminal\ndefense attorney’s expertise. On the other hand, any\ncompetent criminal defense attorney should appreciate the\nextraordinary importance that the risk of removal might\nhave in the client’s determination whether to enter a\nguilty plea.    Accordingly, unreasonable and incorrect\ninformation concerning the risk of removal can give rise to\nan ineffectiveness claim. In addition, silence alone is not\nenough to satisfy counsel’s duty to assist the client. In\nstead, an alien defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel is satisfied if defense counsel advises the client\nthat a conviction may have immigration consequences,\nthat immigration law is a specialized field, that the attor\nney is not an immigration lawyer, and that the client\nshould consult an immigration specialist if the client\nwants advice on that subject.\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

KENTUCKY\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                      KENTUCKY\n\n                        [March 31, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\ndissenting.\n   In the best of all possible worlds, criminal defendants\ncontemplating a guilty plea ought to be advised of all\nserious collateral consequences of conviction, and surely\nought not to be misadvised. The Constitution, however, is\nnot an all-purpose tool for judicial construction of a perfect\nworld; and when we ignore its text in order to make it\nthat, we often find ourselves swinging a sledge where a\ntack hammer is needed.\n   The Sixth Amendment guarantees the accused a lawyer\n“for his defense” against a “criminal prosecutio[n]”—not\nfor sound advice about the collateral consequences of\nconviction. For that reason, and for the practical reasons\nset forth in Part I of JUSTICE ALITO’s concurrence, I dis\nsent from the Court’s conclusion that the Sixth Amend\nment requires counsel to provide accurate advice concern\ning the potential removal consequences of a guilty plea.\nFor the same reasons, but unlike the concurrence, I do not\nbelieve that affirmative misadvice about those conse\nquences renders an attorney’s assistance in defending\nagainst the prosecution constitutionally inadequate; or\nthat the Sixth Amendment requires counsel to warn im\nmigrant defendants that a conviction may render them\nremovable. Statutory provisions can remedy these con\ncerns in a more targeted fashion, and without producing\n2                  PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\npermanent, and legislatively irreparable, overkill.\n                        *      *     *\n   The Sixth Amendment as originally understood and\nratified meant only that a defendant had a right to employ\ncounsel, or to use volunteered services of counsel. See,\nUnited States v. Van Duzee, 140 U. S. 169, 173 (1891); W.\nBeaney, Right to Counsel in American Courts 21, 28–29\n(1955). We have held, however, that the Sixth Amend\nment requires the provision of counsel to indigent defen\ndants at government expense, Gideon v. Wainwright, 372\nU. S. 335, 344–345 (1963), and that the right to “the assis\ntance of counsel” includes the right to effective assistance,\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 686 (1984). Even\nassuming the validity of these holdings, I reject the sig\nnificant further extension that the Court, and to a lesser\nextent the concurrence, would create. We have until today\nat least retained the Sixth Amendment’s textual limita\ntion to criminal prosecutions. “[W]e have held that ‘de\nfence’ means defense at trial, not defense in relation to\nother objectives that may be important to the accused.”\nRothgery v. Gillespie County, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008)\n(ALITO, J., concurring) (slip op., at 4) (summarizing cases).\nWe have limited the Sixth Amendment to legal advice\ndirectly related to defense against prosecution of the\ncharged offense—advice at trial, of course, but also advice\nat postindictment interrogations and lineups, Massiah v.\nUnited States, 377 U. S. 201, 205–206 (1964); United\nStates v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 236–238 (1967), and in\ngeneral advice at all phases of the prosecution where the\ndefendant would be at a disadvantage when pitted alone\nagainst the legally trained agents of the state, see Moran\nv. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 430 (1986). Not only have we\nnot required advice of counsel regarding consequences\ncollateral to prosecution, we have not even required coun\nsel appointed to defend against one prosecution to be\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

Texas v. Cobb, 532 U. S. 162, 164 (2001).\n  There is no basis in text or in principle to extend the\nconstitutionally required advice regarding guilty pleas\nbeyond those matters germane to the criminal prosecution\nat hand—to wit, the sentence that the plea will produce,\nthe higher sentence that conviction after trial might en\ntail, and the chances of such a conviction. Such matters\nfall within “the range of competence demanded of attor\nneys in criminal cases,” McMann v. Richardson, 397 U. S.\n759, 771 (1970). See id., at 769–770 (describing the mat\nters counsel and client must consider in connection with a\ncontemplated guilty plea). We have never held, as the\nlogic of the Court’s opinion assumes, that once counsel is\nappointed all professional responsibilities of counsel—even\nthose extending beyond defense against the prosecution—\nbecome constitutional commands. Cf. Cobb, supra, at 171,\nn. 2; Moran, supra, at 430. Because the subject of the\nmisadvice here was not the prosecution for which Jose\nPadilla was entitled to effective assistance of counsel, the\nSixth Amendment has no application.\n  Adding to counsel’s duties an obligation to advise about\na conviction’s collateral consequences has no logical stop\nping-point. As the concurrence observes,\n    “[A] criminal convictio[n] can carry a wide variety of\n    consequences other than conviction and sentencing,\n    including civil commitment, civil forfeiture, the loss of\n    the right to vote, disqualification from public benefits,\n    ineligibility to possess firearms, dishonorable dis\n    charge from the Armed Forces, and loss of business or\n    professional licenses. . . . All of those consequences are\n    ‘serious,’ . . . .” Ante, at 2–3 (ALITO, J., concurring in\n    judgment).\nBut it seems to me that the concurrence suffers from the\n4                      PADILLA v. KENTUCKY\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsame defect. The same indeterminacy, the same inability\nto know what areas of advice are relevant, attaches to\nmisadvice. And the concurrence’s suggestion that counsel\nmust warn defendants of potential removal consequences,\nsee ante, at 14–15—what would come to be known as the\n“Padilla warning”—cannot be limited to those conse\nquences except by judicial caprice. It is difficult to believe\nthat the warning requirement would not be extended, for\nexample, to the risk of heightened sentences in later fed\neral prosecutions pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal\nAct, 18 U. S. C. §924(e). We could expect years of elabora\ntion upon these new issues in the lower courts, prompted\nby the defense bar’s devising of ever-expanding categories\nof plea-invalidating misadvice and failures to warn—not to\nmention innumerable evidentiary hearings to determine\nwhether misadvice really occurred or whether the warning\nwas really given.\n   The concurrence’s treatment of misadvice seems driven\nby concern about the voluntariness of Padilla’s guilty plea.\nSee ante, at 12. But that concern properly relates to the\nDue Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amend\nments, not to the Sixth Amendment. See McCarthy v.\nUnited States, 394 U. S. 459, 466 (1969); Brady v. United\nStates, 397 U. S. 742, 748 (1970). Padilla has not argued\nbefore us that his guilty plea was not knowing and volun\ntary. If that is, however, the true substance of his claim\n(and if he has properly preserved it) the state court can\naddress it on remand.1 But we should not smuggle the\n——————\n    1I\n     do not mean to suggest that the Due Process Clause would surely\nprovide relief. We have indicated that awareness of “direct conse\nquences” suffices for the validity of a guilty plea. See Brady, 397 U. S.,\nat 755 (internal quotation marks omitted). And the required colloquy\nbetween a federal district court and a defendant required by Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure 11(b) (formerly Rule 11(c)), which we have\nsaid approximates the due process requirements for a valid plea, see\nLibretti v. United States, 516 U. S. 29, 49–50 (1995), does not mention\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

If the subject had not been\nconstitutionalized, legislation could specify which catego\nries of misadvice about matters ancillary to the prosecu\ntion invalidate plea agreements, what collateral conse\nquences counsel must bring to a defendant’s attention, and\nwhat warnings must be given.2 Moreover, legislation\ncould provide consequences for the misadvice, nonadvice,\nor failure to warn, other than nullification of a criminal\nconviction after the witnesses and evidence needed for\nretrial have disappeared. Federal immigration law might\nprovide, for example, that the near-automatic removal\nwhich follows from certain criminal convictions will not\napply where the conviction rested upon a guilty plea in\nduced by counsel’s misadvice regarding removal conse\nquences. Or legislation might put the government to a\nchoice in such circumstances: Either retry the defendant\nor forgo the removal. But all that has been precluded in\nfavor of today’s sledge hammer.\n   In sum, the Sixth Amendment guarantees adequate\nassistance of counsel in defending against a pending\ncriminal prosecution. We should limit both the constitu\ntional obligation to provide advice and the consequences of\nbad advice to that well defined area.\n\n\n\n\n——————\ncollateral consequences. Whatever the outcome, however, the effect of\nmisadvice regarding such consequences upon the validity of a guilty\nplea should be analyzed under the Due Process Clause.\n  2 As the Court’s opinion notes, ante, at 16–17, n. 15, many States—\n\nincluding Kentucky—already require that criminal defendants be\nwarned of potential removal consequences.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/1723/", "sha1": "d100951a942b160a0e3de0683c6aacf8fdc5608d", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2009-034", "time_retrieved": "2010-04-15T12:40:06"}
