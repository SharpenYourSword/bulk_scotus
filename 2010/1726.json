UNITED STATES EX REL.\n\n                      WILSON \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 08–304.      Argued November 30, 2009—Decided March 30, 2010\nThe False Claims Act (FCA) authorizes both the Attorney General and\n  private qui tam relators to recover from persons who make false or\n  fraudulent payment claims to the United States, but it bars qui tam\n  actions based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions\n  in, inter alia, “a congressional, administrative, or Government Ac\n  counting Office [(GAO)] report, hearing, audit, or investigation.” 31\n  U. S. C. §3730(e)(4)(A). Here, federal contracts provided that two\n  North Carolina counties would remediate areas damaged by flooding\n  and that the Federal Government would shoulder most of the costs.\n  Respondent Wilson, then an employee of a local government body in\n  volved in this effort, alerted local and federal officials about possible\n  fraud. Both the county and the State issued reports identifying po\n  tential irregularities in the contracts’ administration. Subsequently,\n  Wilson filed a qui tam action, alleging, as relevant here, that peti\n  tioners, county conservation districts and local and federal officials,\n  knowingly submitted false payment claims in violation of the FCA.\n  The District Court ultimately dismissed for lack of jurisdiction be\n  cause Wilson had not refuted that her action was based upon allega\n  tions publicly disclosed in the county and state reports, which it held\n  were “administrative” reports under the FCA’s public disclosure bar.\n  In reversing, the Fourth Circuit concluded that only federal adminis\n  trative reports may trigger the public disclosure bar.\nHeld: The reference to “administrative” reports, audits, and investiga\n tions in §3730(e)(4)(A) encompasses disclosures made in state and lo\n cal sources as well as federal sources. Pp. 4–21.\n2       GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION \n\n             DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON \n\n                            Syllabus \n\n\n       (a) Section 3730(e)(4)(A) specifies three categories of disclosures\n    that can deprive federal courts of jurisdiction over qui tam suits. The\n    language at issue is contained in the second category (Category 2).\n    Pp. 4–5.\n       (b) The FCA’s plain text does not limit “administrative” to federal\n    sources. Because that term modifies “report, hearing, audit, or inves\n    tigation” in a provision about “the public disclosure” of fraud on the\n    United States, it is most naturally read to describe government\n    agency activities. But since “administrative” is not itself modified by\n    “federal,” there is no immediately apparent basis for excluding state\n    and local agency activities from its ambit. The interpretive maxim\n    noscitur a sociis—“a word may be known by the company it keeps,”\n    Russell Motor Car Co. v. United States, 261 U. S. 514, 519—does not\n    support the Fourth Circuit’s more limited view. In Category 2, “ad\n    ministrative” is sandwiched between the federal terms “congres\n    sional” and “[GAO],” but these items are too few and too disparate to\n    qualify as “a string of statutory terms,” S. D. Warren Co. v. Maine\n    Bd. of Environmental Protection, 547 U. S. 370, 378, or “items in a\n    list,” Beecham v. United States, 511 U. S. 368, 371, for noscitur a so\n    ciis purposes. Furthermore, evaluating “administrative” within the\n    public disclosure bar’s larger scheme, the Court observes that Cate\n    gory 2’s terms are themselves sandwiched between phrases in Cate\n    gory 1 (“criminal, civil, or administrative hearing”) and Category 3\n    (“news media”) that are generally understood to include nonfederal\n    sources; and Category 1 contains the same term (“administrative”)\n    that is at issue. Even if Category 1 were best understood to refer to\n    adjudicative proceedings and Category 2 to legislative or quasi\n    legislative activities, state and local administrative sources of a legis\n    lative-type character are presumably just as public, and just as likely\n    to put the Federal Government on notice of a potential fraud, as state\n    and local administrative hearings of an adjudicatory character. The\n    FCA’s overall federal focus shines no light on the specific question\n    whether the public disclosure bar extends to nonfederal contexts.\n    And the fact that state legislative sources are not included in\n    §3730(e)(4)(A) carries no clear implications for the status of state\n    administrative sources. Pp. 5–12.\n       (c) The legislative record does not support an exclusively federal in\n    terpretation of “administrative.” The current §3730(e)(4)(A) was en\n    acted to strike a balance between encouraging private persons to root\n    out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits. How exactly the statute\n    came to strike this balance as it did is uncertain, as significant sub\n    stantive changes—including the introduction of “administrative” in\n    Category 2—were inserted without floor debate or other discussion,\n    as “technical” amendments.

S. C. §§3729–3733, has authorized both\nthe Attorney General and private qui tam relators to\nrecover from persons who make false or fraudulent claims\nfor payment to the United States. The Act now contains a\nprovision barring qui tam actions based upon the public\ndisclosure of allegations or transactions in certain speci\nfied sources. §3730(e)(4)(A). The question before us is\nwhether the reference to “administrative” reports, audits,\nand investigations in that provision encompasses disclo\nsures made in state and local sources as well as federal\nsources. We hold that it does.1\n——————\n  1 On March 23, 2010, the President signed into law the Patient Pro\ntection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. 111–148, 124 Stat. 119.\nSection 10104(j)(2) of this legislation replaces the prior version of 31\nU. S. C. §3730(e)(4) with new language. The legislation makes no\nmention of retroactivity, which would be necessary for its application to\npending cases given that it eliminates petitioners’ claimed defense to a\nqui tam suit. See Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer,\n520 U. S. 939, 948 (1997). Throughout this opinion, we use the present\n2    GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION \n\n          DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              I\n   In 1995 the United States Department of Agriculture\n(USDA) entered into contracts with two counties in North\nCarolina authorizing them to perform, or to hire others to\nperform, cleanup and repair work in areas that had suf\nfered extensive flooding. The Federal Government agreed\nto shoulder 75 percent of the contract costs. Respondent\nKaren T. Wilson was at that time an employee of the\nGraham County Soil and Conservation District, a special\npurpose government body that had been delegated partial\nresponsibility for coordinating and performing the reme\ndiation effort. Suspecting possible fraud in connection\nwith this effort, Wilson voiced her concerns to local offi\ncials in the summer of 1995. She also sent a letter to, and\nhad a meeting with, agents of the USDA.\n   Graham County officials began an investigation. An\naccounting firm hired by the county performed an audit\nand, in 1996, issued a report (Audit Report) that identified\nseveral potential irregularities in the county’s administra\ntion of the contracts. Shortly thereafter, the North Caro\nlina Department of Environment, Health, and Natural\nResources issued a report (DEHNR Report) identifying\nsimilar problems. The USDA’s Office of Inspector General\neventually issued a third report that contained additional\nfindings.\n   In 2001 Wilson filed this action, alleging that petition\ners, the Graham County and Cherokee County Soil and\nWater Conservation Districts and a number of local and\nfederal officials, violated the False Claims Act (FCA) by\nknowingly submitting false claims for payment pursuant\nto the 1995 contracts. She further alleged that petitioners\nretaliated against her for aiding the federal investigation\nof those false claims.

Wilson, 545 U. S. 409 (2005), the\nCourt of Appeals ordered that that claim be dismissed as\ntime barred. 424 F. 3d 437 (CA4 2005). On remand, the\nDistrict Court subsequently dismissed Wilson’s qui tam\naction for lack of jurisdiction. App. to Pet. for Cert. 95a–\n105a. The court found that Wilson had failed to refute\nthat her action was based upon allegations publicly dis\nclosed in the Audit Report and the DEHNR Report. Id., at\n95a–98a. Those reports, the District Court determined,\nconstituted “administrative . . . report[s], . . . audit[s], or\ninvestigation[s]” within the meaning of the FCA’s public\ndisclosure bar, 31 U. S. C. §3730(e)(4)(A).\n  The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the\nDistrict Court because the reports had been generated by\nstate and local entities. “[O]nly federal administrative\nreports, audits or investigations,” the Fourth Circuit\nconcluded, “qualify as public disclosures under the FCA.”\n528 F. 3d 292, 301 (2008) (emphasis added). The Circuits\nhaving divided over this issue,2 we granted certiorari to\nresolve the conflict. 557 U. S. __ (2009).\n\n\n——————\n  2 Compare      528 F. 3d, at 301–307 (limiting this portion of the public\ndisclosure bar to federal sources), and United States ex rel. Dunleavy v.\nCounty of Delaware, 123 F. 3d 734, 745–746 (CA3 1997) (same), with\nUnited States ex rel. Bly-Magee v.

Board of Regents for State\nof Ga., 468 F. 3d 755, 762 (CA11 2006) (per curiam) (assuming without\nanalysis that state audits may qualify). The Eighth Circuit appears to\nhave taken a “middle road” on this issue, 528 F. 3d, at 301, holding that\ndisclosures made in nonfederal forums may count as “ ‘administrative\n. . . report[s]’ ” or “ ‘audit[s]’ ” under §3730(e)(4)(A) in some instances, as\nwhen they relate to “a cooperative federal-state program through which\nthe federal government provides financial assistance.” Hays v.

WILSON \n\n                        Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             II\n  We have examined the FCA’s qui tam provisions in\nseveral recent opinions.3 At issue in this case is the FCA’s\npublic disclosure bar, which deprives courts of jurisdiction\nover qui tam suits when the relevant information has\nalready entered the public domain through certain chan\nnels. The statute contains three categories of jurisdiction\nstripping disclosures. Following the example of the Court\nof Appeals, see 528 F. 3d, at 300–301, we have inserted\nArabic numerals to identify these categories:\n       “No court shall have jurisdiction over an action under\n       this section based upon the public disclosure of allega\n       tions or transactions [1] in a criminal, civil, or admin\n       istrative hearing, [2] in a congressional, administra\n       tive, or Government Accounting Office [(GAO)] report,\n       hearing, audit, or investigation, or [3] from the news\n       media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney\n       General or the person bringing the action is an origi\n       nal source[4] of the information.” §3730(e)(4)(A) (foot\n       note omitted).\nThis dispute turns on the meaning of the adjective “ad\nministrative” in the second category (Category 2): whether\nit embraces only forums that are federal in nature, as\nrespondent alleges, or whether it extends to disclosures\nmade in state and local sources such as the DEHNR Re\n——————\n    3 See,\n         e.g., Rockwell Int’l Corp. v.

S. 119 (2003) (holding that local\ngovernments are subject to qui tam liability); Vermont Agency of\nNatural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 765 (2000)\n(holding that States are not subject to private FCA actions).\n   4 A separate statutory provision defines an “original source” as “an\n\nindividual who has direct and independent knowledge of the informa\ntion on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided\nthe information to the Government before filing an action under this\nsection which is based on the information.” 31 U. S. C. §3730(e)(4)(B).\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

Although there is\nsome overlap among the three types of argument, it is\nuseful to discuss them separately. We begin with the text.\n                              III\n    The term “administrative” “may, in various contexts,\nbear a range of related meanings,” Chandler v. Judicial\nCouncil of Tenth Circuit, 398 U. S. 74, 103, n. 8 (1970)\n(Harlan, J., concurring in denial of writ), pertaining to\nprivate bodies as well as to governmental bodies. When\nused to modify the nouns “report, hearing, audit, or inves\ntigation,” in the context of a statutory provision about “the\npublic disclosure” of fraud on the United States, the term\nis most naturally read to describe the activities of govern\nmental agencies. See Black’s Law Dictionary 49 (9th ed.\n2009) (hereinafter Black’s) (defining “administration,” “[i]n\npublic law, [as] the practical management and direction of\nthe executive department and its agencies”). Given that\n“administrative” is not itself modified by “federal,” there is\nno immediately apparent textual basis for excluding the\nactivities of state and local agencies (or their contractors)\nfrom its ambit. As the Court of Appeals recognized, “the\nstatute by its express terms does not limit its reach to\nfederal administrative reports or investigations.” 528\nF. 3d, at 301. “[T]here is nothing inherently federal about\nthe word ‘administrative,’ and Congress did not define the\nterm in the FCA.” Id., at 302.\n    The Court of Appeals’ conclusion that “administrative”\nnevertheless reaches only federal sources rested on its\napplication of the interpretive maxim noscitur a sociis.\nSee id., at 302–305. This maxim, literally translated as\n“ ‘it is known by its associates,’ ” Black’s 1160, counsels\n6       GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION \n\n             DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON \n\n                        Opinion of the Court \n\n\nlawyers reading statutes that “a word may be known by\nthe company it keeps,” Russell Motor Car Co. v. United\nStates, 261 U. S. 514, 519 (1923). All participants in this\nlitigation acknowledge that the terms “congressional” and\n“[GAO]” are federal in nature; Congress is the Legislative\nBranch of the Federal Government,5 and the GAO is a\nfederal agency.6 Relying on our opinions in S. D. Warren\nCo. v. Maine Bd. of Environmental Protection, 547 U. S.\n370 (2006), and Beecham v. United States, 511 U. S. 368\n(1994), the Court of Appeals reasoned that “the placement\nof ‘administrative’ squarely in the middle of a list of obvi\nously federal sources strongly suggests that ‘administra\ntive’ should likewise be restricted to federal administrative\nreports, hearings, audits, or investigations.” 528 F. 3d, at\n302. In so holding, the Court of Appeals embraced what\nwe might call the Sandwich Theory of the Third Circuit.\nBoth courts “ ‘f[ou]nd it hard to believe that the drafters of\nthis provision intended the word “administrative” to refer\nto both state and federal reports when it lies sandwiched\nbetween modifiers which are unquestionably federal in\ncharacter.’ ” Ibid. (quoting United States ex rel. Dunleavy\nv. County of Delaware, 123 F. 3d 734, 745 (CA3 1997)).\n   We find this use of noscitur a sociis unpersuasive. A list\n——————\n    5 SeeU. S. Const., Art. I, §1; id., §4, cl. 1 (distinguishing “State . . .\nLegislature[s]” from “the Congress”).\n   6 The statute refers to the GAO, mistakenly, as the “Government\n\nAccounting Office.” It is undisputed that the intended referent was the\nGeneral Accounting Office, now renamed the Government Accountabil\nity Office. See 31 U. S. C. §3730, p. 254, n. 2 (compiler’s note); 528 F. 3d\n292, 300, n. 4 (CA4 2008); United States ex rel. Mistick PBT v.

J., dissenting) (noting that courts have “frequently” made\nthe same scrivener’s error). We have described the GAO as “an inde\npendent agency within the Legislative Branch that exists in large part\nto serve the needs of Congress.” Bowsher v. Merck & Co., 460 U.

Although this list may not be “completely disjunc\ntive,” 528 F. 3d, at 302—it refers to “congressional,\nadministrative, or [GAO]” sources, §3730(e)(4)(A), rather\nthan “congressional, or administrative, or [GAO]”\nsources—neither is it completely harmonious. The sub\nstantive connection, or fit, between the terms “congres\nsional,” “administrative,” and “GAO” is not so tight or so\nself-evident as to demand that we “rob” any one of them\n“of its independent and ordinary significance.” Reiter v.\nSonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 338–339 (1979); see also\nRussell, 261 U. S., at 519 (“That a word may be known by\nthe company it keeps is . . . not an invariable rule, for the\nword may have a character of its own not to be submerged\nby its association”). The adjectives in Category 2 are too\nfew and too disparate to qualify as “a string of statutory\nterms,” S. D. Warren Co., 547 U. S., at 378, or “items in a\nlist,” Beecham, 511 U. S., at 371, in the sense that we used\nthose phrases in the cited cases.7\n——————\n  7 In Jarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303 (1961), the Court\napplied the noscitur a sociis maxim in construing a statutory provision\nthat referred to “ ‘[i]ncome resulting from exploration, discovery, or\nprospecting,’ ” id., at 305 (quoting §456(a)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1939). JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR contends that “the three terms in\nCategory 2 are no more ‘distinct’ or ‘disparate’ than the phrase at issue\nin Jarecki.” Post, at 4 (dissenting opinion) (citation omitted). We\ndisagree. Whether taken in isolation or in context, the phrase “con\ngressional, administrative, or GAO” is not as cohesive as the phrase\n“exploration, discovery, or prospecting.” That is one reason why nosci\ntur a sociis proved illuminating in Jarecki, and why it is less helpful in\nthis case. On their “face,” the terms “exploration,” “discovery,” and\n“prospecting” all describe processes of searching, seeking, speculating;\nthe centrality of such activities to “the oil and gas and mining indus\ntries” gave a clue that it was those industries Congress had in mind\nwhen it drafted the provision. 367 U.

S., at 415; where they differ is in determining\nthe relevant context. The Sandwich Theory presupposes\nthat Category 2 is the only piece of §3730(e)(4)(A) that\nmatters. We agree with petitioners, however, that all of\nthe sources listed in §3730(e)(4)(A) provide interpretive\nguidance. All of these sources drive at the same end:\nspecifying the types of disclosures that can foreclose qui\ntam actions. In light of the public disclosure bar’s gram\nmatical structure, it may be convenient and even clarify\ning to parse the list of sources into three categories. But it\ndoes not follow that we should treat these categories as\nislands unto themselves. Courts have a “duty to construe\nstatutes, not isolated provisions.” Gustafson v. Alloyd Co.,\n513 U. S. 561, 568 (1995).\n   When we consider the entire text of the public disclosure\nbar, the case for limiting “administrative” to federal\nsources becomes significantly weaker. The “news media”\nreferenced in Category 3 plainly have a broader sweep.\nThe Federal Government funds certain media outlets, and\ncertain private outlets have a national focus; but no one\ncontends that Category 3 is limited to these sources.\nThere is likewise no textual basis for assuming that the\n“criminal, civil, or administrative hearing[s]” listed in\nCategory 1 must be federal hearings.8 Of the numerous\n——————\n“common feature” at all, post, at 4—apart from a governmental conno\ntation.

Moreover, the Third, Fifth, and Eleventh\nCircuit cases cited by the Court of Appeals postdate A-1 Ambulance and\nDunleavy, 123 F. 3d 734, both of which put litigants and courts on\nnotice of the possibility that §3730(e)(4)(A) might be limited to federal\nsources.\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

In any event, the\n“federal focus” of the statute, as a whole, does not shine\nlight on the specific question whether the public disclosure\nbar extends to certain nonfederal contexts. It is the fact of\n“public disclosure”—not Federal Government creation or\nreceipt—that is the touchstone of §3730(e)(4)(A).\n   Respondent and the Solicitor General make one last\nargument grounded in the statutory text: It would be\nanomalous, they say, for state and local administrative\nreports to count as public disclosures, when state legisla\ntive reports do not. See Brief for Respondent 15; Brief for\nUnited States 15–16. Yet neither respondent nor the\nSolicitor General disputes the contention of petitioners\nand their amici that, at the time the public disclosure bar\nwas enacted in 1986, Congress rarely gave state legisla\ntures a meaningful role in administering or overseeing\nfederally funded programs. See Brief for Petitioners 36–\n39; Brief for National League of Cities et al. as Amici\nCuriae 8–13. As in the instant case, the Federal Govern\nment was far more likely to enter into contracts with, and\nto provide moneys to, state and local executive agencies.\nWhether or not state legislative sources should have been\nincluded in §3730(e)(4)(A), their exclusion therefore car\nries no clear implications for the status of state adminis\ntrative sources.\n   In sum, although the term “administrative” may be\nsandwiched in Category 2 between terms that are federal\n——————\n  11 On its face, §3733(l)(7)(A) is silent as to whether it includes nonfed\n\neral proceedings. Respondent and the Solicitor General suggest that it\ndoes, though they fairly argue that this provision, relating to civil\ninvestigative demands, has little if any relevance to the case at hand.\nSee Brief for Respondent 21, n. 8; Brief for United States 31–32.\n12    GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION\n           DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin nature, those terms are themselves sandwiched be\ntween phrases that have been generally understood to\ninclude nonfederal sources; and one of those phrases, in\nCategory 1, contains the exact term that is the subject of\nour inquiry. These textual clues negate the force of the\nnoscitur a sociis canon, as it was applied by the Court of\nAppeals.12 We are not persuaded that the associates with\nwhich “administrative” keeps company in §3730(e)(4)(A)\nendow it with an exclusively federal character.\n                             IV\n  As originally enacted, the FCA did not limit the sources\nfrom which a relator could acquire the information to\nbring a qui tam action. In United States ex rel. Marcus v.\nHess, 317 U.

Id., at 545–548; see id., at 545 (“Even if, as the gov\nernment suggests, the petitioner has contributed nothing\nto the discovery of this crime, he has contributed much to\naccomplishing one of the purposes for which the Act was\npassed”).

No. 99–345, p. 2 (1986) (hereinafter S.\nRep.)).\n   The present text of §3730(e)(4) was enacted in 1986 as\npart of this larger reform. Congress apparently concluded\nthat a total bar on qui tam actions based on information\nalready in the Government’s possession thwarted a sig\nnificant number of potentially valuable claims. Rather\nthan simply repeal the Government knowledge bar, how\never, Congress replaced it with the public disclosure bar in\nan effort to strike a balance between encouraging private\npersons to root out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits\nsuch as the one in Hess. How exactly §3730(e)(4) came to\nstrike this balance in the way it did is a matter of consid\nerable uncertainty. The House and Senate Judiciary\nCommittees each reported bills that contained very differ\nent public disclosure bars from the one that emerged in\nthe Statutes at Large; the Senate bill, for example, did not\n14    GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION\n           DIST. v.

See S. Rep., at 42–43 (text of\nproposed §3730(e)(4)).13\n   In respondent and her amici’s view, this background\ncounsels in favor of an exclusively federal interpretation of\n“administrative” for three separate reasons. First, the\ndrafting history of the public disclosure bar suggests that\nCongress intended such a result. Second, a major aim of\nthe 1986 amendments was to limit the scope of the Gov\nernment knowledge bar, and “[c]onstruing [§3730(e)(4)(A)]\nas limited to disclosures in federal proceedings furthers\nCongress’s purpose ‘to encourage more private enforce\nment suits.’ ” Brief for United States 21 (quoting S. Rep.,\nat 23–24). Third, whereas federal administrative proceed\nings can be presumed to provide the Attorney General\nwith a fair opportunity to decide whether to bring an FCA\naction based on revelations made therein, the Attorney\nGeneral is much less likely to learn of fraud disclosed in\nstate proceedings. Respondent and her amici further\nmaintain that it would be perverse to include nonfederal\nsources in Category 2, as local governments would then be\nable to shield themselves from qui tam liability by dis\ncretely disclosing evidence of fraud in “public” reports.14\n   These arguments are reasonable so far as they go, but\nthey do not go very far. As many have observed, the draft\ning history of the public disclosure bar raises more ques\ntions than it answers.15 Significant substantive changes—\n——————\n  13 See   also H. R. Rep.

That the original Senate bill mentioned\nonly congressional and GAO sources in Category 2 is\ntherefore of little moment. Neither the House nor the\nSenate Committee Report explained why a federal limita\ntion would be appropriate, and the subsequent addition of\n“administrative” sources to this Category might be taken\nas a sign that such a limitation was rejected by the full\nChambers.16\n——————\nPrudential Ins.

See Brief for Respondent 29; Brief for\nUnited States 20; Brief for American Center for Law and\nJustice as Amicus Curiae 13–14; Brief for Taxpayers\nAgainst Fraud Education Fund as Amicus Curiae 30–31.\nIn a floor statement, Grassley said that “the term ‘Gov\nernment’ in the definition of original source is meant to\ninclude any Government source of disclosures cited in [the\npublic disclosure bar]; that is[,] Government includes\nCongress, the General Accounting Office, any executive or\nindependent agency as well as all other governmental\nbodies that may have publicly disclosed the allegations.”\n132 Cong. Rec. 20536 (1986). Yet even if a single sentence\nby a single legislator were entitled to any meaningful\nweight, Senator Grassley’s remark merely begs the ques\ntion before us. His formulation fails to indicate whether\nthe “other governmental bodies” may be state or local\nbodies. It also turns on a term, “Government” with a\ncapital “G,” that does not appear in the codified version of\nthe public disclosure bar, which Congress subsequently\nrevised in numerous respects prior to passage.\n   There is, in fact, only one item in the legislative record\nthat squarely corroborates respondent’s reading of the\nstatute: a letter sent by the primary sponsors of the 1986\namendments to the Attorney General in 1999. See 145\nCong. Rec. 16032 (1999) (reproducing text of letter in\nwhich Rep. Berman and Sen.

Needless to say, this letter does not qualify as\nlegislative “history,” given that it was written 13 years\nafter the amendments were enacted. It is consequently of\nscant or no value for our purposes.17\n   We do not doubt that Congress passed the 1986\namendments to the FCA “to strengthen the Government’s\nhand in fighting false claims,” Cook County, 538 U. S., at\n133–134, and “to encourage more private enforcement\nsuits,” S. Rep., at 23–24. It is equally beyond cavil, how\never, that Congress passed the public disclosure bar to bar\na subset of those suits that it deemed unmeritorious or\ndownright harmful. The question before us concerns the\nprecise scope of that subset; and on this matter, the record\nis all but opaque.

Yet while\n“there is no question that the PFCRA was designed to operate in\ntandem with the FCA,” Stevens, 529 U.

The statutory touchstone,\nonce again, is whether the allegations of fraud have been\n“public[ly] disclos[ed],” §3730(e)(4)(A), not whether they\nhave landed on the desk of a DOJ lawyer.\n   Respondent’s argument also gives insufficient weight to\nCongress’ decision to bar qui tam actions based on disclo\nsures “from the news media.” Ibid. Because there was no\nsuch bar prior to 1986, the addition of the news media as a\njurisdiction-stripping category forecloses the suggestion\nthat the 1986 amendments implemented a single-minded\nintent to increase the availability of qui tam litigation.\nAnd since the “news media” include a large number of\nlocal newspapers and radio stations, this category likely\ndescribes a multitude of sources that would seldom come\nto the attention of the Attorney General.\n   As for respondent and her amici’s concern that local\ngovernments will insulate themselves from qui tam liabil\nity “through careful, low key ‘disclosures’ ” of potential\nfraud, Brief for American Center for Law and Justice as\nAmicus Curiae 17, this argument rests not just on specu\nlation but indeed on rather strained speculation. Any\nsuch disclosure would not immunize the local government\nfrom FCA liability in an action brought by the United\nStates, see Rockwell Int’l Corp. v. United States, 549 U. S.\n457, 478 (2007)—and to the contrary it could tip off the\nAttorney General that such an action might be fruitful. It\nseems to us that petitioners have the more clear-eyed view\nwhen they assert that, “[g]iven the fact that the submis\nsion of a false claim to the United States subjects a defen\ndant to criminal liability, fines, debarment, treble dam\nages and attorneys’ fees, no rational entity would prepare\na report that self-discloses fraud with the sole purpose of\ncutting off qui tam actions.” Reply Brief for Petitioners 19;\nsee also United States ex rel.

Notwithstanding public disclosure of the\nallegations made by a qui tam plaintiff, her case may go\nforward if she is “an original source of the information.”\n§3730(e)(4)(A). It is therefore flat wrong to suggest that a\nfinding for petitioners will “ ‘in effect return us to the\nunduly restrictive “government knowledge” standard’ ”\nthat prevailed prior to 1986. Brief for United States 31\n(quoting Dunleavy, 123 F. 3d, at 746); see Brief for Re\nspondent 34 (asserting that “petitioners’ construction\nwould reimpose a form of the ‘government knowledge’ bar”\n(capitalization omitted)). Today’s ruling merely confirms\nthat disclosures made in one type of context—a state or\nlocal report, audit, or investigation—may trigger the\npublic disclosure bar. It has no bearing on disclosures\nmade in other contexts, and it leaves intact the ability of\noriginal sources to prosecute qui tam actions irrespective\nof the state of Government knowledge. Whether respon\ndent can qualify as an “original source,” as that term is\ndefined in §3730(e)(4), is one of many issues that remain\nopen on remand.\n\n\n——————\n   19 Petitioners and their amici also counter with public policy argu\n\nments of their own.

Ante, at 17 (quoting United\nStates v. Bornstein, 423 U. S. 303, 310 (1976)). The Con\nstitution gives legal effect to the “Laws” Congress enacts,\nArt.

Today, the\nCourt reads the phrase “administrative . . . report, hear\ning, audit, or investigation” to encompass not only federal,\nbut also state and local, government sources. In my view,\nthe Court misreads the statutory text and gives insuffi\ncient weight to contextual and historical evidence of Con\ngress’ purpose in enacting §3730. I would affirm the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals and hold that “adminis\ntrative” in the above-quoted provision refers only to Fed\neral Government sources.1\n\n——————\n  1 As the Court notes, recent legislation amended the language of 31\n\nU.

Like the Court, I use the present tense\nthroughout this opinion in discussing the statute as it existed at the\ntime this case was argued before this Court.\n2          GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION \n\n                DIST. v.

Brown & Williamson Tobacco\nCorp., 529 U. S. 120, 133 (2000) (quoting Davis v. Michi\ngan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803, 809 (1989)). No\nparty here disputes that “congressional” and “[GAO]” refer\nonly to Federal Government sources. Ante, at 6, and nn.\n5–6. As the Court acknowledges, ante, at 5, the word\n“administrative” is more capacious, potentially reaching\nnot only federal, state, and local government sources but\nalso disclosures by private entities. See, e.g., Black’s Law\nDictionary 42 (5th ed. 1979) (defining “administrative” as\n“pertain[ing] to administration, especially management,\n. . . [of] the execution, application or conduct of persons or\nthings”).\n    Like the Court of Appeals, I view Congress’ choice of two\n“clearly federal terms [to] bookend the not-so-clearly fed\neral term” as a “very strong contextual cue about the\nmeaning of ‘administrative.’ ” 528 F. 3d 292, 302 (CA4\n2008). “ ‘The maxim noscitur a sociis, . . . while not an\ninescapable rule, is often wisely applied where a word is\ncapable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving of\n——————\n    2 As\n       the Court observes, in enacting §3730(e)(4)(A) Congress errone\nously referred to the General Accounting Office—now renamed the\nGovernment Accountability Office—as the “Government Accounting\nOffice.” Ante, at 6, n. 6.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

D.\nSearle & Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307 (1961)). Here, the imme\ndiate proximity of “congressional” and “[GAO]” suggests\nthat “administrative” should be read, like its neighbors, as\nreferring to Federal Government sources. If Congress had\nintended to include state or local government administra\ntive materials, it could have said so, for instance by refer\nring generically to “governmental” sources. See 528 F. 3d,\nat 304–305.\n   The Court applies the logic that underlies the noscitur a\nsociis canon in concluding that “administrative” does not\nrefer to private entities because of the meaning suggested\nby the slightly more distant neighbors “report, hearing,\naudit, or investigation.” See ante, at 5. I agree with the\nmajority that “administrative” in this context does not\nreach private entities. But in my view, “congressional”\nand “[GAO]” provide the better textual grounding for that\nconclusion. I see no reason why the “administrati[on]” of a\nprivate university, for instance, could not issue a “report,”\norder an “audit” or “investigation,” or conduct a “hearing.”\nNor, contrary to the majority’s suggestion, are private\nentities—particularly those receiving federal funds or\nparticipating in federal programs—incapable of making\n“public disclosure[s]” of fraud on the Federal Government.\n   Despite its own implicit reliance on the canon, the Court\nnevertheless rejects the Court of Appeals’ application of\nnoscitur a sociis to interpret the three terms in Category 2,\nconcluding that “[a] list of three items, each quite distinct\nfrom the other no matter how construed, is too short to be\nparticularly illuminating.” Ante, at 6–7. The three terms\nin Category 2, the Court concludes, are “too few and too\ndisparate” to justify invocation of noscitur a sociis. Ante,\nat 7. We have not previously constrained the canon in this\nway, and I would not do so here.\n   To take just one example, in Jarecki we construed the\n4     GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION \n\n           DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON \n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n\nstatutory term “ ‘abnormal income,’ ” which the statute\ndefined to include income resulting from “ ‘exploration,\ndiscovery, or prospecting.’ ” 367 U. S., at 304–305 (quoting\n§456(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939). Recogniz\ning that the word “ ‘[d]iscovery’ ” is “usable in many con\ntexts and with various shades of meaning,” we observed\nthat it “gathers meaning from the words around it” and\nconcluded that “[t]he three words in conjunction . . . all\ndescribe income-producing activity in the oil and gas and\nmining industries.” Id., at 307. As a result, and in light of\nother contextual evidence supporting the same conclusion,\nwe held that sales of newly invented drugs or camera\nequipment did not give rise to “abnormal income” even if\nsuch inventions might otherwise be understood as “dis\ncover[ies].” See id., at 307–313. In my view, the three\nterms in Category 2 are no more “distinct” or “disparate,”\nante, at 7, than the phrase at issue in Jarecki, particularly\ngiven the expansive plain meaning of “discovery.” Cf.\nante, at 7, n. 7. Here, application of the noscitur a sociis\nprinciple readily yields a common feature: The sources at\nissue are federal in nature, not related to state or local\ngovernments or private entities. See Third Nat. Bank in\nNashville v. Impac Limited, Inc., 432 U. S. 312, 322–323,\n315 (1977) (applying principle that “words grouped in a\nlist should be given related meaning” where term “ ‘injunc\ntion’ ” was “sandwiched” between two other words in the\nstatutory phrase “ ‘attachment, injunction, or execution’ ”).3\n——————\n   3 The Court relies on Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 338–339\n\n(1979), for the proposition that we should not “ ‘rob’ ” any of the three\nterms in Category 2 of 31 U. S. C. §3730(e)(4)(A) of “ ‘its independent\nand ordinary significance.’ ” Ante, at 7. But Reiter involved the statu\ntory term “business or property.” Those two words less readily suggest\na shared limiting principle than do “congressional, administrative, or\n[GAO].” Moreover, our concern about “rob[bing]” the word “ ‘property’ ”\nof its broader meaning rested on a desire not to “ignore the disjunctive\n‘or’ ” in the statutory pairing. 442 U. S., at 338–339; see also id., at 339\n(“Canons of construction ordinarily suggest that terms connected by a\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

There is\nno conflict, however, if both categories are read, as re\nspondent and the Solicitor General urge, as exclusively\nfederal. See Brief for Respondent 23–24; Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 25–26. Even reading Category 1\nmore broadly, however, does not change the exclusively\nfederal nature of “congressional” and “[GAO],” which\nundermines whatever inference might be drawn from\ntaking the statutory terms in strict succession. Treating\nthe entirety of §3730(e)(4)(A) as an undifferentiated list of\nitems gives short shrift to the syntactical choices Congress\nmade in offsetting each category with commas and prepo\nsitions, and in providing distinct classes of adjectives that\nmodify different nouns.\n   Finally, the Court also views “news media” as “distinctly\nnonfederal in nature.” Ante, at 8–9. But “news media”\ndoes not seem particularly illuminating in this context. As\nthe Court of Appeals observed, although media sources\n\n——————\ndisjunctive be given separate meanings”). Because Congress did not\nemploy a completely disjunctive list in §3730(e)(4)(A)—i.e., “congres\nsional or administrative or [GAO]”—the Reiter principle applies with\nless force. Cf. Garcia v. United States, 469 U. S. 70, 73 (1984) (applying\ndisjunctive principle in construing statutory prohibition on assault and\nrobbery of any custodian of “ ‘mail matter or of any money or other\nproperty of the United States,’ ” and observing that “[t]he three classes\nof property . . . are each separated by the conjunction ‘or’ ” (quoting 18\nU.

While the legislative record\nis concededly incomplete, it does provide reason to exercise\ncaution before giving the statutory text its broadest possi\nble meaning—i.e., to encompass not only federal, but also\nstate and local, government sources.\n    Three points are particularly salient. First, prior to the\n1986 amendments, the “Government knowledge” bar\nunquestionably referred only to information in the posses\nsion of the Federal Government.4 Even still, the bar was\ncriticized as overly restrictive. A Senate Report on an\ninitial version of the 1986 legislation, for instance, de\nscribed the FCA’s history and need for legislative reform,\nnoting “several restrictive court interpretations of the act\n. . . which tend to thwart the effectiveness of the statute.”\nS. Rep. No. 99–345, p. 4 (1986) (hereinafter S. Rep.). For\ninstance, courts had applied the Government knowledge\nbar “even if the Government makes no effort to investigate\nor take action after . . . original allegations [a]re received.”\nId., at 12 (citing United States ex rel.

Rep., at 1–2;\naccord, H. R. Rep. No. 99–660, p. 18 (1986) (“Evidence of\nfraud in Government programs and procurement is on a\nsteady rise”). The Senate Report also articulated a desire\nto “encourage any individual knowing of Government\nfraud to bring that information forward,” and it identified\nas “perhaps the most serious problem plaguing effective\nenforcement [of antifraud laws] a lack of resources on the\npart of Federal enforcement agencies.” S. Rep., at 2, 7.6\n  Consistent with these expressed views, the enacted\nlegislation was replete with provisions encouraging qui\n\n——————\nfrom bringing a qui tam suit for Medicaid fraud because the State had\npreviously disclosed the information to the Federal Government, even\nwhen the State’s own investigation had discovered the fraud. S. Rep.,\nat 12–13. Lower courts have observed that the Dean decision was\ncontroversial and appears to have motivated the inclusion of the\n“original source” exception in the 1986 jurisdictional bar. See, e.g.,\nWang v. FMC Corp., 975 F. 2d 1412, 1419 (CA9 1992); see also S. Rep.,\nat 13 (noting resolution by the National Association of Attorneys\nGeneral criticizing Dean and urging Congress to address the problem).\n  6 In introducing a later and near-final version of the bill, Senator\n\nGrassley described the reform effort as stemming “from a realization\nthat the Government needs help—lots of help—to adequately protect\ntaxpayer funds from growing and increasingly sophisticated fraud.”\n132 Cong.

Ante, at 19. But\nneither does that provision support reading Category 2 to its broadest\npossible extent.

Today’s decision risks such a\nresult. The Court imposes a jurisdictional bar that is by\nall appearances more restrictive of qui tam suits than the\npre-1986 regime.

R. Rep. No. 99–660, pp. 2, 3 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The references to information disclosed by the Government\nitself (with a capital “G”) and to “congressional investigation[s]” connote\nfederal, not state or local, government sources. In July, the Senate\nCommittee on the Judiciary reported its own version of the bill, barring\nactions “based upon allegations or transactions which are the subject of\na civil suit in which the Government is already a party, or within six\nmonths of the disclosure of specific information relating to such allega\ntions or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, a\ncongressional or Government Accounting Office report or hearing, or\nfrom the news media.” S. Rep., at 43. The reference to suits in which\nthe Federal Government is a party and absence of the ambiguous term\n“administrative” in the bill’s reference to “congressional or [GAO]”\nreports or hearings, similarly tend to exclude disclosures from state or\nlocal government reports. The enacted legislation did differ in several\nrespects from the reported bills, but the subsequent legislative record\ncontains no reference to the inclusion of state or local government\nsources. See, e.g., 132 Cong. Rec. 20535–20537 (statement of Sen.\nGrassley); id., at 29321–29322 (statements of Reps. Glickman and\nBerman).\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

Indeed, a number of lower courts look to whether the Federal\nGovernment is “on notice” of alleged fraud before concluding that a\nparticular source is a “public disclosure of allegations or transactions”\nunder §3730(e)(4)(A).

Argued November 30, 2009—Decided March 30, 2010\nThe False Claims Act (FCA) authorizes both the Attorney General and\n  private qui tam relators to recover from persons who make false or\n  fraudulent payment claims to the United States, but it bars qui tam\n  actions based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions\n  in, inter alia, “a congressional, administrative, or Government Ac\n  counting Office [(GAO)] report, hearing, audit, or investigation.” 31\n  U. S. C. §3730(e)(4)(A). Here, federal contracts provided that two\n  North Carolina counties would remediate areas damaged by flooding\n  and that the Federal Government would shoulder most of the costs.\n  Respondent Wilson, then an employee of a local government body in\n  volved in this effort, alerted local and federal officials about possible\n  fraud. Both the county and the State issued reports identifying po\n  tential irregularities in the contracts’ administration. Subsequently,\n  Wilson filed a qui tam action, alleging, as relevant here, that peti\n  tioners, county conservation districts and local and federal officials,\n  knowingly submitted false payment claims in violation of the FCA.\n  The District Court ultimately dismissed for lack of jurisdiction be\n  cause Wilson had not refuted that her action was based upon allega\n  tions publicly disclosed in the county and state reports, which it held\n  were “administrative” reports under the FCA’s public disclosure bar.\n  In reversing, the Fourth Circuit concluded that only federal adminis\n  trative reports may trigger the public disclosure bar.\nHeld: The reference to “administrative” reports, audits, and investiga\n tions in §3730(e)(4)(A) encompasses disclosures made in state and lo\n cal sources as well as federal sources. Pp. 4–21.\n2       GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION \n\n             DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON \n\n                            Syllabus \n\n\n       (a) Section 3730(e)(4)(A) specifies three categories of disclosures\n    that can deprive federal courts of jurisdiction over qui tam suits. The\n    language at issue is contained in the second category (Category 2).\n    Pp. 4–5.\n       (b) The FCA’s plain text does not limit “administrative” to federal\n    sources. Because that term modifies “report, hearing, audit, or inves\n    tigation” in a provision about “the public disclosure” of fraud on the\n    United States, it is most naturally read to describe government\n    agency activities. But since “administrative” is not itself modified by\n    “federal,” there is no immediately apparent basis for excluding state\n    and local agency activities from its ambit. The interpretive maxim\n    noscitur a sociis—“a word may be known by the company it keeps,”\n    Russell Motor Car Co. v. United States, 261 U. S. 514, 519—does not\n    support the Fourth Circuit’s more limited view. In Category 2, “ad\n    ministrative” is sandwiched between the federal terms “congres\n    sional” and “[GAO],” but these items are too few and too disparate to\n    qualify as “a string of statutory terms,” S. D. Warren Co. v. Maine\n    Bd. of Environmental Protection, 547 U. S. 370, 378, or “items in a\n    list,” Beecham v. United States, 511 U. S. 368, 371, for noscitur a so\n    ciis purposes. Furthermore, evaluating “administrative” within the\n    public disclosure bar’s larger scheme, the Court observes that Cate\n    gory 2’s terms are themselves sandwiched between phrases in Cate\n    gory 1 (“criminal, civil, or administrative hearing”) and Category 3\n    (“news media”) that are generally understood to include nonfederal\n    sources; and Category 1 contains the same term (“administrative”)\n    that is at issue. Even if Category 1 were best understood to refer to\n    adjudicative proceedings and Category 2 to legislative or quasi\n    legislative activities, state and local administrative sources of a legis\n    lative-type character are presumably just as public, and just as likely\n    to put the Federal Government on notice of a potential fraud, as state\n    and local administrative hearings of an adjudicatory character. The\n    FCA’s overall federal focus shines no light on the specific question\n    whether the public disclosure bar extends to nonfederal contexts.\n    And the fact that state legislative sources are not included in\n    §3730(e)(4)(A) carries no clear implications for the status of state\n    administrative sources. Pp. 5–12.\n       (c) The legislative record does not support an exclusively federal in\n    terpretation of “administrative.” The current §3730(e)(4)(A) was en\n    acted to strike a balance between encouraging private persons to root\n    out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits. How exactly the statute\n    came to strike this balance as it did is uncertain, as significant sub\n    stantive changes—including the introduction of “administrative” in\n    Category 2—were inserted without floor debate or other discussion,\n    as “technical” amendments.

The Federal Government agreed\nto shoulder 75 percent of the contract costs. Respondent\nKaren T. Wilson was at that time an employee of the\nGraham County Soil and Conservation District, a special\npurpose government body that had been delegated partial\nresponsibility for coordinating and performing the reme\ndiation effort. Suspecting possible fraud in connection\nwith this effort, Wilson voiced her concerns to local offi\ncials in the summer of 1995. She also sent a letter to, and\nhad a meeting with, agents of the USDA.\n   Graham County officials began an investigation. An\naccounting firm hired by the county performed an audit\nand, in 1996, issued a report (Audit Report) that identified\nseveral potential irregularities in the county’s administra\ntion of the contracts. Shortly thereafter, the North Caro\nlina Department of Environment, Health, and Natural\nResources issued a report (DEHNR Report) identifying\nsimilar problems. The USDA’s Office of Inspector General\neventually issued a third report that contained additional\nfindings.\n   In 2001 Wilson filed this action, alleging that petition\ners, the Graham County and Cherokee County Soil and\nWater Conservation Districts and a number of local and\nfederal officials, violated the False Claims Act (FCA) by\nknowingly submitting false claims for payment pursuant\nto the 1995 contracts. She further alleged that petitioners\nretaliated against her for aiding the federal investigation\nof those false claims.

The statute contains three categories of jurisdiction\nstripping disclosures. Following the example of the Court\nof Appeals, see 528 F. 3d, at 300–301, we have inserted\nArabic numerals to identify these categories:\n       “No court shall have jurisdiction over an action under\n       this section based upon the public disclosure of allega\n       tions or transactions [1] in a criminal, civil, or admin\n       istrative hearing, [2] in a congressional, administra\n       tive, or Government Accounting Office [(GAO)] report,\n       hearing, audit, or investigation, or [3] from the news\n       media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney\n       General or the person bringing the action is an origi\n       nal source[4] of the information.” §3730(e)(4)(A) (foot\n       note omitted).\nThis dispute turns on the meaning of the adjective “ad\nministrative” in the second category (Category 2): whether\nit embraces only forums that are federal in nature, as\nrespondent alleges, or whether it extends to disclosures\nmade in state and local sources such as the DEHNR Re\n——————\n    3 See,\n         e.g., Rockwell Int’l Corp. v.

Although there is\nsome overlap among the three types of argument, it is\nuseful to discuss them separately. We begin with the text.\n                              III\n    The term “administrative” “may, in various contexts,\nbear a range of related meanings,” Chandler v. Judicial\nCouncil of Tenth Circuit, 398 U. S. 74, 103, n. 8 (1970)\n(Harlan, J., concurring in denial of writ), pertaining to\nprivate bodies as well as to governmental bodies. When\nused to modify the nouns “report, hearing, audit, or inves\ntigation,” in the context of a statutory provision about “the\npublic disclosure” of fraud on the United States, the term\nis most naturally read to describe the activities of govern\nmental agencies. See Black’s Law Dictionary 49 (9th ed.\n2009) (hereinafter Black’s) (defining “administration,” “[i]n\npublic law, [as] the practical management and direction of\nthe executive department and its agencies”). Given that\n“administrative” is not itself modified by “federal,” there is\nno immediately apparent textual basis for excluding the\nactivities of state and local agencies (or their contractors)\nfrom its ambit. As the Court of Appeals recognized, “the\nstatute by its express terms does not limit its reach to\nfederal administrative reports or investigations.” 528\nF. 3d, at 301. “[T]here is nothing inherently federal about\nthe word ‘administrative,’ and Congress did not define the\nterm in the FCA.” Id., at 302.\n    The Court of Appeals’ conclusion that “administrative”\nnevertheless reaches only federal sources rested on its\napplication of the interpretive maxim noscitur a sociis.\nSee id., at 302–305. This maxim, literally translated as\n“ ‘it is known by its associates,’ ” Black’s 1160, counsels\n6       GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION \n\n             DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL.

S. 514, 519 (1923). All participants in this\nlitigation acknowledge that the terms “congressional” and\n“[GAO]” are federal in nature; Congress is the Legislative\nBranch of the Federal Government,5 and the GAO is a\nfederal agency.6 Relying on our opinions in S. D. Warren\nCo. v. Maine Bd. of Environmental Protection, 547 U. S.\n370 (2006), and Beecham v. United States, 511 U. S. 368\n(1994), the Court of Appeals reasoned that “the placement\nof ‘administrative’ squarely in the middle of a list of obvi\nously federal sources strongly suggests that ‘administra\ntive’ should likewise be restricted to federal administrative\nreports, hearings, audits, or investigations.” 528 F. 3d, at\n302. In so holding, the Court of Appeals embraced what\nwe might call the Sandwich Theory of the Third Circuit.\nBoth courts “ ‘f[ou]nd it hard to believe that the drafters of\nthis provision intended the word “administrative” to refer\nto both state and federal reports when it lies sandwiched\nbetween modifiers which are unquestionably federal in\ncharacter.’ ” Ibid. (quoting United States ex rel. Dunleavy\nv. County of Delaware, 123 F. 3d 734, 745 (CA3 1997)).\n   We find this use of noscitur a sociis unpersuasive. A list\n——————\n    5 SeeU. S. Const., Art. I, §1; id., §4, cl. 1 (distinguishing “State . . .\nLegislature[s]” from “the Congress”).\n   6 The statute refers to the GAO, mistakenly, as the “Government\n\nAccounting Office.” It is undisputed that the intended referent was the\nGeneral Accounting Office, now renamed the Government Accountabil\nity Office. See 31 U. S. C. §3730, p. 254, n. 2 (compiler’s note); 528 F. 3d\n292, 300, n. 4 (CA4 2008); United States ex rel. Mistick PBT v.

J., dissenting) (noting that courts have “frequently” made\nthe same scrivener’s error). We have described the GAO as “an inde\npendent agency within the Legislative Branch that exists in large part\nto serve the needs of Congress.” Bowsher v. Merck & Co., 460 U.

Although this list may not be “completely disjunc\ntive,” 528 F. 3d, at 302—it refers to “congressional,\nadministrative, or [GAO]” sources, §3730(e)(4)(A), rather\nthan “congressional, or administrative, or [GAO]”\nsources—neither is it completely harmonious. The sub\nstantive connection, or fit, between the terms “congres\nsional,” “administrative,” and “GAO” is not so tight or so\nself-evident as to demand that we “rob” any one of them\n“of its independent and ordinary significance.” Reiter v.\nSonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 338–339 (1979); see also\nRussell, 261 U. S., at 519 (“That a word may be known by\nthe company it keeps is . . . not an invariable rule, for the\nword may have a character of its own not to be submerged\nby its association”). The adjectives in Category 2 are too\nfew and too disparate to qualify as “a string of statutory\nterms,” S. D. Warren Co., 547 U. S., at 378, or “items in a\nlist,” Beecham, 511 U. S., at 371, in the sense that we used\nthose phrases in the cited cases.7\n——————\n  7 In Jarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303 (1961), the Court\napplied the noscitur a sociis maxim in construing a statutory provision\nthat referred to “ ‘[i]ncome resulting from exploration, discovery, or\nprospecting,’ ” id., at 305 (quoting §456(a)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1939). JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR contends that “the three terms in\nCategory 2 are no more ‘distinct’ or ‘disparate’ than the phrase at issue\nin Jarecki.” Post, at 4 (dissenting opinion) (citation omitted). We\ndisagree. Whether taken in isolation or in context, the phrase “con\ngressional, administrative, or GAO” is not as cohesive as the phrase\n“exploration, discovery, or prospecting.” That is one reason why nosci\ntur a sociis proved illuminating in Jarecki, and why it is less helpful in\nthis case. On their “face,” the terms “exploration,” “discovery,” and\n“prospecting” all describe processes of searching, seeking, speculating;\nthe centrality of such activities to “the oil and gas and mining indus\ntries” gave a clue that it was those industries Congress had in mind\nwhen it drafted the provision. 367 U. S., at 307 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The terms “congressional,” “administrative,” and\n“GAO” do not share any comparable core of meaning—or indeed any\n8    GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION \n\n          DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   More important, we need to evaluate “administrative”\nwithin the larger scheme of the public disclosure bar.\nBoth parties acknowledge, as they must, that “[s]tatutory\nlanguage has meaning only in context,” Graham County\nSoil, 545 U. S., at 415; where they differ is in determining\nthe relevant context. The Sandwich Theory presupposes\nthat Category 2 is the only piece of §3730(e)(4)(A) that\nmatters. We agree with petitioners, however, that all of\nthe sources listed in §3730(e)(4)(A) provide interpretive\nguidance. All of these sources drive at the same end:\nspecifying the types of disclosures that can foreclose qui\ntam actions. In light of the public disclosure bar’s gram\nmatical structure, it may be convenient and even clarify\ning to parse the list of sources into three categories. But it\ndoes not follow that we should treat these categories as\nislands unto themselves. Courts have a “duty to construe\nstatutes, not isolated provisions.” Gustafson v. Alloyd Co.,\n513 U. S. 561, 568 (1995).\n   When we consider the entire text of the public disclosure\nbar, the case for limiting “administrative” to federal\nsources becomes significantly weaker. The “news media”\nreferenced in Category 3 plainly have a broader sweep.\nThe Federal Government funds certain media outlets, and\ncertain private outlets have a national focus; but no one\ncontends that Category 3 is limited to these sources.\nThere is likewise no textual basis for assuming that the\n“criminal, civil, or administrative hearing[s]” listed in\nCategory 1 must be federal hearings.8 Of the numerous\n——————\n“common feature” at all, post, at 4—apart from a governmental conno\ntation. It takes the Sandwich Theory to graft a federal limitation onto\n“administrative.”\n  8 A number of lower courts have concluded that, as used in Category\n\n1, “ ‘hearing’ is roughly synonymous with ‘proceeding.’ ” United States\nex rel.

United States, 409 U. S. 239, 243 (1972)\n(“[A] legislative body generally uses a particular word with\na consistent meaning in a given context”). Respondent\nand the Solicitor General assert that §3730(e)(4)(A)’s two\nreferences to “administrative” can be distinguished be\ncause Category 1 is best understood to refer to adjudica\ntive proceedings, whereas Category 2 is best understood to\nrefer to legislative or quasi-legislative activities such as\nrulemaking, oversight, and investigations. See Brief for\nRespondent 16–18; Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 25–26 (hereinafter Brief for United States). Yet\neven if this reading were correct, state and local adminis\ntrative reports, hearings, audits, and investigations of a\nlegislative-type character are presumably just as public,\nand just as likely to put the Federal Government on notice\nof a potential fraud, as state and local administrative\nhearings of an adjudicatory character.9\n—————— \n\nSylvia, The False Claims Act: Fraud Against the Government §11:35, \n\np. 642 (2004) (hereinafter Sylvia).\n   9 See Bly-Magee, 470 F. 3d, at 918 (“Indeed, the statute would seem to\n\nbe inconsistent if it included state and local administrative hearings as\nsources of public disclosures [in Category 1] and then, in the next\nbreath, excluded state administrative reports as sources”); In re Natu\nral Gas Royalties Qui Tam Litigation, 467 F.

See Brief for Respondent 23–24;\nBrief for United States 25–26. No court has ever taken\nsuch a view of these sources. See 528 F. 3d, at 303 (citing\ncases from the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh\nCircuits and stating that “[t]he courts have easily con\ncluded that [Category 1] applies to state-level hearings”);\nSylvia §11:37, at 643, n. 1 (citing additional cases).10 The\narguments in favor of reading a federal limitation into\nCategory 1 are supported, if at all, by legislative history\nand policy; they find no support in the statute’s text.\n  Moving from the narrow lens of the Sandwich Theory to\na bird’s eye view, respondent and the Solicitor General\nalso maintain that the “exclusively federal focus” of the\nFCA counsels against reading the public disclosure bar to\nencompass nonfederal sources. Brief for Respondent 10,\n18; Brief for United States 13. The FCA undoubtedly has\na federal focus. But so does every other federal statute.\n——————\nnarrowly would have the anomalous result of allowing public disclosure\nstatus to the most obscure local news report and the most obscure state\nand local civil lawsuit or administrative hearing, but denying public\ndisclosure status to a formal public report of a state government\nagency”).\n  10 Following the Court of Appeals, see 528 F. 3d, at 303, respondent\n\nasserts that only the Ninth Circuit, in A-1 Ambulance Serv., Inc. v.\nCalifornia, 202 F. 3d 1238, 1244 (2000), has explicitly considered and\nrejected the argument that Category 1 is limited to federal sources.\nBrief for Respondent 23–24. At least one other Circuit, however, has\ndone the same, see United States ex rel. Hafter v. Spectrum Emergency\nCare, Inc., 190 F. 3d 1156, 1161, n. 6 (CA10 1999), and no lower court,\nas far as we are aware, has so much as suggested that an alternative\nconstruction might be viable. Moreover, the Third, Fifth, and Eleventh\nCircuit cases cited by the Court of Appeals postdate A-1 Ambulance and\nDunleavy, 123 F. 3d 734, both of which put litigants and courts on\nnotice of the possibility that §3730(e)(4)(A) might be limited to federal\nsources.\n                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nAnd as respondent and the Solicitor General elsewhere\nacknowledge, quite a few aspects of the FCA, including a\nreference to “administrative” proceedings in §3733(l)\n(7)(A)11 and the reference to “news media” in\n§3730(e)(4)(A) itself, are not just federal. In any event, the\n“federal focus” of the statute, as a whole, does not shine\nlight on the specific question whether the public disclosure\nbar extends to certain nonfederal contexts. It is the fact of\n“public disclosure”—not Federal Government creation or\nreceipt—that is the touchstone of §3730(e)(4)(A).\n   Respondent and the Solicitor General make one last\nargument grounded in the statutory text: It would be\nanomalous, they say, for state and local administrative\nreports to count as public disclosures, when state legisla\ntive reports do not. See Brief for Respondent 15; Brief for\nUnited States 15–16. Yet neither respondent nor the\nSolicitor General disputes the contention of petitioners\nand their amici that, at the time the public disclosure bar\nwas enacted in 1986, Congress rarely gave state legisla\ntures a meaningful role in administering or overseeing\nfederally funded programs. See Brief for Petitioners 36–\n39; Brief for National League of Cities et al. as Amici\nCuriae 8–13. As in the instant case, the Federal Govern\nment was far more likely to enter into contracts with, and\nto provide moneys to, state and local executive agencies.\nWhether or not state legislative sources should have been\nincluded in §3730(e)(4)(A), their exclusion therefore car\nries no clear implications for the status of state adminis\ntrative sources.\n   In sum, although the term “administrative” may be\nsandwiched in Category 2 between terms that are federal\n——————\n  11 On its face, §3733(l)(7)(A) is silent as to whether it includes nonfed\n\neral proceedings. Respondent and the Solicitor General suggest that it\ndoes, though they fairly argue that this provision, relating to civil\ninvestigative demands, has little if any relevance to the case at hand.\nSee Brief for Respondent 21, n. 8; Brief for United States 31–32.\n12    GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION\n           DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin nature, those terms are themselves sandwiched be\ntween phrases that have been generally understood to\ninclude nonfederal sources; and one of those phrases, in\nCategory 1, contains the exact term that is the subject of\nour inquiry. These textual clues negate the force of the\nnoscitur a sociis canon, as it was applied by the Court of\nAppeals.12 We are not persuaded that the associates with\nwhich “administrative” keeps company in §3730(e)(4)(A)\nendow it with an exclusively federal character.\n                             IV\n  As originally enacted, the FCA did not limit the sources\nfrom which a relator could acquire the information to\nbring a qui tam action. In United States ex rel. Marcus v.\nHess, 317 U. S. 537 (1943), we upheld the relator’s recov\nery even though he had discovered the fraud by reading a\nfederal criminal indictment—a quintessential “parasitic”\nsuit. Id., at 545–548; see id., at 545 (“Even if, as the gov\nernment suggests, the petitioner has contributed nothing\nto the discovery of this crime, he has contributed much to\naccomplishing one of the purposes for which the Act was\npassed”). Congress promptly reacted to that decision by\namending the statute to preclude qui tam actions “based\nupon evidence or information in the possession of the\nUnited States, or any agency, officer or employee thereof,\n——————\n  12 The Court of Appeals repeatedly referred to the three categories in\n\n§3730(e)(4)(A) as “clauses.” See 528 F. 3d, at 300–305. Were they in\nfact clauses rather than prepositional phrases, reliance on noscitur a\nsociis might have been supported by one of our earliest cases using\nthat term, Watson v. Mercer, 8 Pet. 88, 105 (1834) (Reporter’s statement\nof the case), which suggested that “different clauses of the same sen\ntence” should be presumed “to embrace the subject matter of the\nsentence.” The Court of Appeals’ mistaken reference to “clauses” is of\ncourse less significant than its failure to treat the public disclosure bar\nas an integrated whole.

No. 99–345, p. 2 (1986) (hereinafter S.\nRep.)).\n   The present text of §3730(e)(4) was enacted in 1986 as\npart of this larger reform. Congress apparently concluded\nthat a total bar on qui tam actions based on information\nalready in the Government’s possession thwarted a sig\nnificant number of potentially valuable claims. Rather\nthan simply repeal the Government knowledge bar, how\never, Congress replaced it with the public disclosure bar in\nan effort to strike a balance between encouraging private\npersons to root out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits\nsuch as the one in Hess. How exactly §3730(e)(4) came to\nstrike this balance in the way it did is a matter of consid\nerable uncertainty. The House and Senate Judiciary\nCommittees each reported bills that contained very differ\nent public disclosure bars from the one that emerged in\nthe Statutes at Large; the Senate bill, for example, did not\n14    GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION\n           DIST. v.

See S. Rep., at 42–43 (text of\nproposed §3730(e)(4)).13\n   In respondent and her amici’s view, this background\ncounsels in favor of an exclusively federal interpretation of\n“administrative” for three separate reasons. First, the\ndrafting history of the public disclosure bar suggests that\nCongress intended such a result. Second, a major aim of\nthe 1986 amendments was to limit the scope of the Gov\nernment knowledge bar, and “[c]onstruing [§3730(e)(4)(A)]\nas limited to disclosures in federal proceedings furthers\nCongress’s purpose ‘to encourage more private enforce\nment suits.’ ” Brief for United States 21 (quoting S. Rep.,\nat 23–24). Third, whereas federal administrative proceed\nings can be presumed to provide the Attorney General\nwith a fair opportunity to decide whether to bring an FCA\naction based on revelations made therein, the Attorney\nGeneral is much less likely to learn of fraud disclosed in\nstate proceedings. Respondent and her amici further\nmaintain that it would be perverse to include nonfederal\nsources in Category 2, as local governments would then be\nable to shield themselves from qui tam liability by dis\ncretely disclosing evidence of fraud in “public” reports.14\n   These arguments are reasonable so far as they go, but\nthey do not go very far. As many have observed, the draft\ning history of the public disclosure bar raises more ques\ntions than it answers.15 Significant substantive changes—\n——————\n  13 See   also H. R. Rep.

That the original Senate bill mentioned\nonly congressional and GAO sources in Category 2 is\ntherefore of little moment.

Doe v. John Doe Corp.,\n960 F. 2d 318, 319 (CA2 1992). And her narrative contains no account\nof why Category 2 emerged in the form that it did. Any such account\nwould necessarily be an exercise in speculation, as the record is silent\n16   GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION\n          DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Respondent and her amici place particular emphasis on\na remark made by the lead sponsor of the Senate bill,\nSenator Grassley. See Brief for Respondent 29; Brief for\nUnited States 20; Brief for American Center for Law and\nJustice as Amicus Curiae 13–14; Brief for Taxpayers\nAgainst Fraud Education Fund as Amicus Curiae 30–31.\nIn a floor statement, Grassley said that “the term ‘Gov\nernment’ in the definition of original source is meant to\ninclude any Government source of disclosures cited in [the\npublic disclosure bar]; that is[,] Government includes\nCongress, the General Accounting Office, any executive or\nindependent agency as well as all other governmental\nbodies that may have publicly disclosed the allegations.”\n132 Cong. Rec. 20536 (1986). Yet even if a single sentence\nby a single legislator were entitled to any meaningful\nweight, Senator Grassley’s remark merely begs the ques\ntion before us. His formulation fails to indicate whether\nthe “other governmental bodies” may be state or local\nbodies. It also turns on a term, “Government” with a\ncapital “G,” that does not appear in the codified version of\nthe public disclosure bar, which Congress subsequently\nrevised in numerous respects prior to passage.\n   There is, in fact, only one item in the legislative record\nthat squarely corroborates respondent’s reading of the\nstatute: a letter sent by the primary sponsors of the 1986\namendments to the Attorney General in 1999. See 145\nCong. Rec. 16032 (1999) (reproducing text of letter in\nwhich Rep. Berman and Sen. Grassley state: “We did\nintend, and any fair reading of the statute will confirm,\nthat the disclosure must be in a federal criminal, civil or\nadministrative hearing. Disclosure in a state proceeding\n\n——————\non the matter. In our view, neither the general trajectory of 20th\ncentury FCA reform nor the specific statements made during the 1986\nlegislative process clearly point one way or the other on the question\nbefore us.\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

Needless to say, this letter does not qualify as\nlegislative “history,” given that it was written 13 years\nafter the amendments were enacted. It is consequently of\nscant or no value for our purposes.17\n   We do not doubt that Congress passed the 1986\namendments to the FCA “to strengthen the Government’s\nhand in fighting false claims,” Cook County, 538 U. S., at\n133–134, and “to encourage more private enforcement\nsuits,” S. Rep., at 23–24. It is equally beyond cavil, how\never, that Congress passed the public disclosure bar to bar\na subset of those suits that it deemed unmeritorious or\ndownright harmful. The question before us concerns the\nprecise scope of that subset; and on this matter, the record\nis all but opaque. While “the absence of specific legislative\nhistory in no way modifies the conventional judicial duty\nto give faithful meaning to the language Congress adopted\nin the light of the evident legislative purpose in enacting\nthe law in question,” United States v. Bornstein, 423 U. S.\n——————\n   17 See Consumer Product Safety Comm’n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447\n\nU. S. 102, 118 (1980); Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.

S. C. §3801 et seq.), shortly before the enactment\nof the FCA amendments supports their reading of the latter. See Brief\nfor Respondent 30–33; Brief for United States 14–15; Brief for Taxpay\ners Against Fraud Education Fund as Amicus Curiae 28–29. Yet while\n“there is no question that the PFCRA was designed to operate in\ntandem with the FCA,” Stevens, 529 U. S., at 786, n. 17, or that the\nPFCRA is addressed to federal administrative agencies, there is also no\nexplicit evidence to suggest that Congress intended to limit Category\n2’s reference to “administrative” sources to the same set of agencies.\nThe FCA’s public disclosure bar serves a distinct function not replicated\nin the PFCRA; the text of the public disclosure bar contains no refer\nence to the PFCRA; and no Member of Congress, so far as we are\naware, articulated any such intent.\n18    GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION\n           DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n303, 310 (1976), there is no “evident legislative purpose” to\nguide our resolution of the discrete issue that confronts us.\n                              V\n   Respondent and her amici likewise fail to prove their\ncase that petitioners’ reading of the statute will lead to\nresults that Congress could not have intended. Their\nargument rests on an empirical proposition: “While federal\ninquiries and their outcomes are readily available to De\npartment of Justice [(DOJ)] attorneys, many state and\nlocal reports and investigations never come to the atten\ntion of federal authorities.” Brief for United States 22; see\nalso 528 F. 3d, at 306 (“Because the federal government is\nunlikely to learn about state and local investigations, a\nlarge number of fraudulent claims against the government\nwould go unremedied without the financial incentives\noffered by the qui tam provisions of the FCA”). This\nproposition is not implausible, but it is sheer conjecture.\nNumerous federal investigations may be occurring at any\ngiven time, and DOJ attorneys may not reliably learn\nabout their findings. DOJ attorneys may learn about\nquite a few state and local inquiries, especially when the\ninquiries are conducted pursuant to a joint federal-state\nprogram financed in part by federal dollars, such as the\nprogram at issue in this case.18 Just how accessible to the\nAttorney General a typical state or local source will be, as\ncompared to a federal source, is an open question. And it\n——————\n  18 In some instances, federal law dictates that state and local govern\n\nments receiving federal funds perform an audit of their programs. See\n31 U. S. C. §7502(a)(1)(B) (requiring nonfederal entities that expend\nfederal awards above a certain amount to “undergo a single audit” in\naccordance with specified conditions); Brief for State of Pennsylvania et\nal. as Amici Curiae 7–10 (discussing the Single Audit Act of 1984). It\nbears mention that, to the extent one is worried about Federal Gov\nernment ignorance of state and local antifraud efforts, see post, at 10–\n11, today’s ruling may induce federal authorities to pay closer attention\nto such efforts going forward.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nis not even the right question. The statutory touchstone,\nonce again, is whether the allegations of fraud have been\n“public[ly] disclos[ed],” §3730(e)(4)(A), not whether they\nhave landed on the desk of a DOJ lawyer.\n   Respondent’s argument also gives insufficient weight to\nCongress’ decision to bar qui tam actions based on disclo\nsures “from the news media.” Ibid. Because there was no\nsuch bar prior to 1986, the addition of the news media as a\njurisdiction-stripping category forecloses the suggestion\nthat the 1986 amendments implemented a single-minded\nintent to increase the availability of qui tam litigation.\nAnd since the “news media” include a large number of\nlocal newspapers and radio stations, this category likely\ndescribes a multitude of sources that would seldom come\nto the attention of the Attorney General.\n   As for respondent and her amici’s concern that local\ngovernments will insulate themselves from qui tam liabil\nity “through careful, low key ‘disclosures’ ” of potential\nfraud, Brief for American Center for Law and Justice as\nAmicus Curiae 17, this argument rests not just on specu\nlation but indeed on rather strained speculation. Any\nsuch disclosure would not immunize the local government\nfrom FCA liability in an action brought by the United\nStates, see Rockwell Int’l Corp. v. United States, 549 U. S.\n457, 478 (2007)—and to the contrary it could tip off the\nAttorney General that such an action might be fruitful. It\nseems to us that petitioners have the more clear-eyed view\nwhen they assert that, “[g]iven the fact that the submis\nsion of a false claim to the United States subjects a defen\ndant to criminal liability, fines, debarment, treble dam\nages and attorneys’ fees, no rational entity would prepare\na report that self-discloses fraud with the sole purpose of\ncutting off qui tam actions.” Reply Brief for Petitioners 19;\nsee also United States ex rel. Bly-Magee v. Premo, 470\nF. 3d 914, 919 (CA9 2006) (“The fear [of self-insulating\ndisclosures] is unfounded in general because it is unlikely\n20    GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION\n           DIST. v.

Notwithstanding public disclosure of the\nallegations made by a qui tam plaintiff, her case may go\nforward if she is “an original source of the information.”\n§3730(e)(4)(A). It is therefore flat wrong to suggest that a\nfinding for petitioners will “ ‘in effect return us to the\nunduly restrictive “government knowledge” standard’ ”\nthat prevailed prior to 1986. Brief for United States 31\n(quoting Dunleavy, 123 F. 3d, at 746); see Brief for Re\nspondent 34 (asserting that “petitioners’ construction\nwould reimpose a form of the ‘government knowledge’ bar”\n(capitalization omitted)). Today’s ruling merely confirms\nthat disclosures made in one type of context—a state or\nlocal report, audit, or investigation—may trigger the\npublic disclosure bar. It has no bearing on disclosures\nmade in other contexts, and it leaves intact the ability of\noriginal sources to prosecute qui tam actions irrespective\nof the state of Government knowledge. Whether respon\ndent can qualify as an “original source,” as that term is\ndefined in §3730(e)(4), is one of many issues that remain\nopen on remand.\n\n\n——————\n   19 Petitioners and their amici also counter with public policy argu\n\nments of their own. Under the Court of Appeals’ reading of the statute,\nthey allege, there is an increased likelihood that parasitic relators will\nbeat more deserving relators to the courthouse, Brief for Petitioners 31,\nand that state and local governments will find their antifraud investi\ngations impeded, or will decline to conduct such investigations in the\nfirst place, on account of “opportunistic potential relators trolling state\nrecords and reports, available to the public,” in search of a qui tam\nclaim, Brief for State of Pennsylvania et al. as Amici Curiae 11.\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

Ante, at 17 (quoting United\nStates v. Bornstein, 423 U. S. 303, 310 (1976)). The Con\nstitution gives legal effect to the “Laws” Congress enacts,\nArt.

If\n§3730(e)(4)(A)’s text includes state and local administra\ntive reports and audits, as the Court correctly concludes it\ndoes, then it is utterly irrelevant whether the Members of\nCongress intended otherwise. Anyway, it is utterly impos\nsible to discern what the Members of Congress intended\nexcept to the extent that intent is manifested in the only\nremnant of “history” that bears the unanimous endorse\nment of the majority in each House: the text of the en\nrolled bill that became law.\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

Today, the\nCourt reads the phrase “administrative . . . report, hear\ning, audit, or investigation” to encompass not only federal,\nbut also state and local, government sources.

Brown & Williamson Tobacco\nCorp., 529 U. S. 120, 133 (2000) (quoting Davis v. Michi\ngan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803, 809 (1989)). No\nparty here disputes that “congressional” and “[GAO]” refer\nonly to Federal Government sources. Ante, at 6, and nn.\n5–6. As the Court acknowledges, ante, at 5, the word\n“administrative” is more capacious, potentially reaching\nnot only federal, state, and local government sources but\nalso disclosures by private entities. See, e.g., Black’s Law\nDictionary 42 (5th ed. 1979) (defining “administrative” as\n“pertain[ing] to administration, especially management,\n. . . [of] the execution, application or conduct of persons or\nthings”).\n    Like the Court of Appeals, I view Congress’ choice of two\n“clearly federal terms [to] bookend the not-so-clearly fed\neral term” as a “very strong contextual cue about the\nmeaning of ‘administrative.’ ” 528 F. 3d 292, 302 (CA4\n2008). “ ‘The maxim noscitur a sociis, . . . while not an\ninescapable rule, is often wisely applied where a word is\ncapable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving of\n——————\n    2 As\n       the Court observes, in enacting §3730(e)(4)(A) Congress errone\nously referred to the General Accounting Office—now renamed the\nGovernment Accountability Office—as the “Government Accounting\nOffice.” Ante, at 6, n. 6.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

D.\nSearle & Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307 (1961)). Here, the imme\ndiate proximity of “congressional” and “[GAO]” suggests\nthat “administrative” should be read, like its neighbors, as\nreferring to Federal Government sources. If Congress had\nintended to include state or local government administra\ntive materials, it could have said so, for instance by refer\nring generically to “governmental” sources. See 528 F. 3d,\nat 304–305.\n   The Court applies the logic that underlies the noscitur a\nsociis canon in concluding that “administrative” does not\nrefer to private entities because of the meaning suggested\nby the slightly more distant neighbors “report, hearing,\naudit, or investigation.” See ante, at 5. I agree with the\nmajority that “administrative” in this context does not\nreach private entities. But in my view, “congressional”\nand “[GAO]” provide the better textual grounding for that\nconclusion. I see no reason why the “administrati[on]” of a\nprivate university, for instance, could not issue a “report,”\norder an “audit” or “investigation,” or conduct a “hearing.”\nNor, contrary to the majority’s suggestion, are private\nentities—particularly those receiving federal funds or\nparticipating in federal programs—incapable of making\n“public disclosure[s]” of fraud on the Federal Government.\n   Despite its own implicit reliance on the canon, the Court\nnevertheless rejects the Court of Appeals’ application of\nnoscitur a sociis to interpret the three terms in Category 2,\nconcluding that “[a] list of three items, each quite distinct\nfrom the other no matter how construed, is too short to be\nparticularly illuminating.” Ante, at 6–7. The three terms\nin Category 2, the Court concludes, are “too few and too\ndisparate” to justify invocation of noscitur a sociis. Ante,\nat 7. We have not previously constrained the canon in this\nway, and I would not do so here.\n   To take just one example, in Jarecki we construed the\n4     GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION \n\n           DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL.

S., at 304–305 (quoting\n§456(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939). Recogniz\ning that the word “ ‘[d]iscovery’ ” is “usable in many con\ntexts and with various shades of meaning,” we observed\nthat it “gathers meaning from the words around it” and\nconcluded that “[t]he three words in conjunction . . . all\ndescribe income-producing activity in the oil and gas and\nmining industries.” Id., at 307. As a result, and in light of\nother contextual evidence supporting the same conclusion,\nwe held that sales of newly invented drugs or camera\nequipment did not give rise to “abnormal income” even if\nsuch inventions might otherwise be understood as “dis\ncover[ies].” See id., at 307–313. In my view, the three\nterms in Category 2 are no more “distinct” or “disparate,”\nante, at 7, than the phrase at issue in Jarecki, particularly\ngiven the expansive plain meaning of “discovery.” Cf.\nante, at 7, n. 7. Here, application of the noscitur a sociis\nprinciple readily yields a common feature: The sources at\nissue are federal in nature, not related to state or local\ngovernments or private entities. See Third Nat. Bank in\nNashville v. Impac Limited, Inc., 432 U. S. 312, 322–323,\n315 (1977) (applying principle that “words grouped in a\nlist should be given related meaning” where term “ ‘injunc\ntion’ ” was “sandwiched” between two other words in the\nstatutory phrase “ ‘attachment, injunction, or execution’ ”).3\n——————\n   3 The Court relies on Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 338–339\n\n(1979), for the proposition that we should not “ ‘rob’ ” any of the three\nterms in Category 2 of 31 U. S. C. §3730(e)(4)(A) of “ ‘its independent\nand ordinary significance.’ ” Ante, at 7. But Reiter involved the statu\ntory term “business or property.” Those two words less readily suggest\na shared limiting principle than do “congressional, administrative, or\n[GAO].” Moreover, our concern about “rob[bing]” the word “ ‘property’ ”\nof its broader meaning rested on a desire not to “ignore the disjunctive\n‘or’ ” in the statutory pairing. 442 U.

There is\nno conflict, however, if both categories are read, as re\nspondent and the Solicitor General urge, as exclusively\nfederal. See Brief for Respondent 23–24; Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 25–26. Even reading Category 1\nmore broadly, however, does not change the exclusively\nfederal nature of “congressional” and “[GAO],” which\nundermines whatever inference might be drawn from\ntaking the statutory terms in strict succession. Treating\nthe entirety of §3730(e)(4)(A) as an undifferentiated list of\nitems gives short shrift to the syntactical choices Congress\nmade in offsetting each category with commas and prepo\nsitions, and in providing distinct classes of adjectives that\nmodify different nouns.\n   Finally, the Court also views “news media” as “distinctly\nnonfederal in nature.” Ante, at 8–9. But “news media”\ndoes not seem particularly illuminating in this context. As\nthe Court of Appeals observed, although media sources\n\n——————\ndisjunctive be given separate meanings”). Because Congress did not\nemploy a completely disjunctive list in §3730(e)(4)(A)—i.e., “congres\nsional or administrative or [GAO]”—the Reiter principle applies with\nless force. Cf. Garcia v. United States, 469 U. S. 70, 73 (1984) (applying\ndisjunctive principle in construing statutory prohibition on assault and\nrobbery of any custodian of “ ‘mail matter or of any money or other\nproperty of the United States,’ ” and observing that “[t]he three classes\nof property . . . are each separated by the conjunction ‘or’ ” (quoting 18\nU. S. C. §2114; some emphasis deleted)).\n6          GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION\n                DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL.

While the legislative record\nis concededly incomplete, it does provide reason to exercise\ncaution before giving the statutory text its broadest possi\nble meaning—i.e., to encompass not only federal, but also\nstate and local, government sources.\n    Three points are particularly salient. First, prior to the\n1986 amendments, the “Government knowledge” bar\nunquestionably referred only to information in the posses\nsion of the Federal Government.4 Even still, the bar was\ncriticized as overly restrictive. A Senate Report on an\ninitial version of the 1986 legislation, for instance, de\nscribed the FCA’s history and need for legislative reform,\nnoting “several restrictive court interpretations of the act\n. . . which tend to thwart the effectiveness of the statute.”\nS. Rep. No. 99–345, p. 4 (1986) (hereinafter S. Rep.). For\ninstance, courts had applied the Government knowledge\nbar “even if the Government makes no effort to investigate\nor take action after . . . original allegations [a]re received.”\nId., at 12 (citing United States ex rel. Lapin v. Interna\ntional Business Machines Corp., 490 F. Supp. 244 (Haw.\n1980)).5\n——————\n    4 As\n       originally enacted in 1943, the bar applied to suits “based upon\nevidence or information in the possession of the United States, or any\nagency, officer or employee thereof, at the time such suit was brought.”\n57 Stat. 609. In 1982, Congress recodified the provision to apply to\nsuits “based on evidence or information the Government had when the\naction was brought.” 96 Stat. 979.\n  5 The Senate Report also discussed United States ex rel. Wisconsin v.\n\nDean, 729 F. 2d 1100 (CA7 1984), in which the court barred Wisconsin\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

Rep., at 1–2;\naccord, H. R. Rep. No. 99–660, p. 18 (1986) (“Evidence of\nfraud in Government programs and procurement is on a\nsteady rise”). The Senate Report also articulated a desire\nto “encourage any individual knowing of Government\nfraud to bring that information forward,” and it identified\nas “perhaps the most serious problem plaguing effective\nenforcement [of antifraud laws] a lack of resources on the\npart of Federal enforcement agencies.” S. Rep., at 2, 7.6\n  Consistent with these expressed views, the enacted\nlegislation was replete with provisions encouraging qui\n\n——————\nfrom bringing a qui tam suit for Medicaid fraud because the State had\npreviously disclosed the information to the Federal Government, even\nwhen the State’s own investigation had discovered the fraud. S. Rep.,\nat 12–13. Lower courts have observed that the Dean decision was\ncontroversial and appears to have motivated the inclusion of the\n“original source” exception in the 1986 jurisdictional bar. See, e.g.,\nWang v. FMC Corp., 975 F. 2d 1412, 1419 (CA9 1992); see also S. Rep.,\nat 13 (noting resolution by the National Association of Attorneys\nGeneral criticizing Dean and urging Congress to address the problem).\n  6 In introducing a later and near-final version of the bill, Senator\n\nGrassley described the reform effort as stemming “from a realization\nthat the Government needs help—lots of help—to adequately protect\ntaxpayer funds from growing and increasingly sophisticated fraud.”\n132 Cong. Rec. 28580 (1986); see also United States ex rel. Siller v.\nBecton Dickinson & Co., 21 F. 3d 1339, 1347 (CA4 1994) (“By 1986,\nwhen section 3730(e)(4) was enacted, Congress had come to the conclu\nsion that fraud against the Government was apparently so rampant\nand difficult to identify that the Government could use all the help it\ncould get from private citizens with knowledge of fraud” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n8     GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION \n\n           DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON \n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n\ntam actions. By replacing the Government knowledge bar\nwith the current text of §3730(e)(4)(A) and including an\nexception for “original source[s],” Congress “allowed pri\nvate parties to sue even based on information already in\nthe Government’s possession.” Cook County v. United\nStates ex rel. Chandler, 538 U. S. 119, 133 (2003). The\n1986 amendments also established the right of qui tam\nrelators to continue as a party to a suit after the Govern\nment intervenes, 31 U. S. C. §3730(c)(1) (1988 ed.); in\ncreased the percentage of recovery available as an incen\ntive for private suits, §3730(d)(1); and created a cause of\naction against employers who retaliate against qui tam\nrelators, §3730(h).7\n——————\n    7 See also 1 J. Boese, Civil False Claims and Qui Tam Actions\n\n§1.04[G], p. 1–22 (Supp. 2007) (“[V]irtually all the changes introduced\nin th[e] section [of the 1986 amendments addressing qui tam actions]\nexpanded the rights of qui tam relators”). The amendments also\ncontained a number of provisions facilitating enforcement generally,\ne.g., lowering the requisite showing of intent by making clear that\n“knowing” violations require “no proof of specific intent to defraud,” 31\nU. S. C. §3729(b)(1) (1988 ed.); lengthening the statute of limitations,\n§3731(b); and authorizing treble damages, §3729(a).\n    The Court fairly observes that the addition of “news media” to the\njurisdictional bar undercuts attributing to Congress a “single-minded”\nintent to expand the availability of qui tam relief. Ante, at 19. But\nneither does that provision support reading Category 2 to its broadest\npossible extent. Moreover, barring suits based on “news media” disclo\nsures may not have constituted a particularly significant expansion of\nexisting law. Courts had applied the pre-1986 Government knowledge\nbar to dismiss actions based on information reported in the news\nmedia. In United States ex rel. Thompson v. Hays, 432 F. Supp. 253,\n256, 255 (DC 1976), the court dismissed a suit based on evidence\n“gleaned from sources in the news media which received widespread\npublic attention [alleging fraud by a Member of Congress],” when the\nDepartment of Justice “first obtained information regarding the claims\n. . . as a result of [a] Washington Post article.” Similarly, the court in\nUnited States v. Burmah Oil Co., 558 F. 2d 43, 46, n. 1 (CA2 1977) (per\ncuriam) characterized the Government knowledge bar as “dis\ncourag[ing] the filing of actions by parties having no information of\ntheir own to contribute, but who merely plagiarized information in\n                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                  9\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   To be sure, Congress was also concerned in 1986, as in\n1943, with guarding against purely opportunistic, “para\nsitic” qui tam relators. See S. Rep., at 10–11 (describing\nhistory of parasitic suits and the 1943 amendments); ante,\nat 12–13. Lower courts have viewed the 1986 amend\nments as striking a balance between the “twin goals of\nrejecting suits which the government is capable of pursu\ning itself, while promoting those which the government is\nnot equipped to bring on its own.” United States ex rel.\nSpringfield Terminal R. Co. v. Quinn, 14 F. 3d 645, 651\n(CADC 1994). But evidence that Congress sought to\nbalance two competing goals supports moderation in\ninterpreting an arguably ambiguous statutory text, rather\nthan woodenly reading the statutory language to its fullest\npossible extent.\n   Third, the legislative record “ ‘contains no hint of any\nintention’ ” to bar suits based on disclosures from state or\nlocal government sources. Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 20 (quoting United States ex rel. Anti-\nDiscrimination Center of Metro N. Y., Inc. v. Westchester\nCty., 495 F. Supp. 2d 375, 383 (SDNY 2007)). Inclusion of\nstate or local government sources would have constituted\na significant departure from the Federal Government\nknowledge bar that had existed for four decades by 1986.\nBut neither the initial bills reported by the Senate and\nHouse Committees nor statements by individual Members\nof Congress about subsequent versions of the legislation\nsuggest any consideration or debate about expanding the\npre-1986 bar to apply to state or local government\n\n——————\nindictments returned in the courts, newspaper stories or congressional\ninvestigations.” Congress could have reasonably assumed in 1986 that\nnews media would report on the kinds of high-profile frauds that would\nnaturally—perhaps as a result of the reporting—come to the Govern\nment’s attention, and thus would already have been covered under\nexisting law.\n10       GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION\n              DIST. v.

Today’s decision risks such a\nresult. The Court imposes a jurisdictional bar that is by\nall appearances more restrictive of qui tam suits than the\npre-1986 regime. Construing §3730(e)(4)(A) to encompass\nthe thousands of state and local government administra\ntive reports produced each year effectively imputes to the\nFederal Government knowledge of such sources, whether\nor not the Government is aware of the information or in a\n\n\n——————\n  8 In  June 1986, the House Committee on the Judiciary reported a bill\nthat would have barred qui tam actions based on information “which\nthe Government disclosed as a basis for allegations made in a prior\nadministrative, civil, or criminal proceeding,” “disclosed during the\ncourse of a congressional investigation,” or “disseminated by any news\nmedia.” H. R. Rep. No. 99–660, pp. 2, 3 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The references to information disclosed by the Government\nitself (with a capital “G”) and to “congressional investigation[s]” connote\nfederal, not state or local, government sources. In July, the Senate\nCommittee on the Judiciary reported its own version of the bill, barring\nactions “based upon allegations or transactions which are the subject of\na civil suit in which the Government is already a party, or within six\nmonths of the disclosure of specific information relating to such allega\ntions or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, a\ncongressional or Government Accounting Office report or hearing, or\nfrom the news media.” S. Rep., at 43. The reference to suits in which\nthe Federal Government is a party and absence of the ambiguous term\n“administrative” in the bill’s reference to “congressional or [GAO]”\nreports or hearings, similarly tend to exclude disclosures from state or\nlocal government reports. The enacted legislation did differ in several\nrespects from the reported bills, but the subsequent legislative record\ncontains no reference to the inclusion of state or local government\nsources. See, e.g., 132 Cong. Rec. 20535–20537 (statement of Sen.\nGrassley); id., at 29321–29322 (statements of Reps. Glickman and\nBerman).\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

S. C. §3730(e)(4)(A) (2006 ed.) speaks of “public\n\ndisclosure,” not notice to the Government. But the requirement of a\n“public” disclosure countenances notice, both to the public and other\nwise. Indeed, a number of lower courts look to whether the Federal\nGovernment is “on notice” of alleged fraud before concluding that a\nparticular source is a “public disclosure of allegations or transactions”\nunder §3730(e)(4)(A). See, e.g., United States ex rel. Poteet v.

Brief for Petitioners 31. But the FCA’s first-to-file provision,\n31 U. S.
