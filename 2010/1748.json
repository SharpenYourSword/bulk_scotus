Argued November 3, 2009—Decided January 13, 2010\nThe Mobile-Sierra doctrine—see United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile\n  Gas Service Corp., 350 U. S. 332, and FPC v. Sierra Pacific Power\n  Co., 350 U. S. 348—requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commis\n  sion (FERC) to presume that an electricity rate set by a freely negoti\n  ated wholesale-energy contract meets the Federal Power Act’s (FPA)\n  “just and reasonable” prescription, 16 U. S. C. §7824d(a); the pre\n  sumption may be overcome only if FERC concludes that the contract\n  seriously harms the public interest. Morgan Stanley Capital Group\n  Inc. v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Cty., 554 U. S. ___, ___.\n     For many years, New England’s supply of electricity capacity was\n  barely sufficient to meet the region’s demand. FERC and New Eng\n  land’s generators, electricity providers, and power customers made\n  several attempts to address the problem. This case arises from the\n  latest effort to design a solution. Concerned parties reached a com\n  prehensive settlement agreement (Agreement) that, inter alia, estab\n  lished rate-setting mechanisms for sales of energy capacity and pro\n  vided that the Mobile-Sierra public interest standard would govern\n  rate challenges. FERC approved the Agreement, finding that it pre\n  sents a just and reasonable outcome that is consistent with the public\n  interest. Objectors to the settlement sought review in the D. C. Cir\n  cuit, which largely rejected their efforts to overturn FERC’s approval\n  order, but agreed with them that when a challenge to a contract rate\n  is brought by noncontracting third parties, Mobile-Sierra’s public in\n  terest standard does not apply.\nHeld: The Mobile-Sierra presumption does not depend on the identity of\n the complainant who seeks FERC investigation. The presumption is\n not limited to challenges to contract rates brought by contracting par\n2           NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v. MAINE PUB. \n\n                        UTIL.

Pp. 5–11.\n       (a) Morgan Stanley did not reach the question presented here, but\n    its reasoning strongly suggests that the D. C. Circuit’s holding mis\n    perceives the aim, and diminishes the force, of the Mobile-Sierra doc\n    trine. Announced three months after the Court of Appeals’ disposi\n    tion in this case, Morgan Stanley reaffirmed Mobile-Sierra’s\n    instruction to FERC to “presume that the rate set out in a freely ne\n    gotiated . . . contract meets the ‘just and reasonable’ requirement”\n    unless “FERC concludes that the contract seriously harms the public\n    interest.” 554 U. S., at ___. The Morgan Stanley opinion makes it\n    unmistakably clear that the public interest standard is not, as the\n    D. C. Circuit suggested, independent of, and sometimes at odds with,\n    the “just and reasonable” standard. Rather, the public interest stan\n    dard defines “what it means for a rate to satisfy the just-and\n    reasonable standard in the contract context.” Id., at ___. And if\n    FERC itself must presume just and reasonable a contract rate result\n    ing from fair, arms-length negotiations, noncontracting parties may\n    not escape that presumption. Moreover, the Mobile-Sierra doctrine\n    does not neglect third-party interests; it directs FERC to reject a con\n    tract rate that “seriously harms the consuming public.” 554 U. S., at\n    ___. Finally, the D. C. Circuit’s confinement of Mobile-Sierra to rate\n    challenges by contracting parties diminishes the doctrine’s animating\n    purpose: promotion of “the stability of supply arrangements which all\n    agree is essential to the health of the [energy] industry.” Mobile, 350\n    U. S., at 344. A presumption applicable to contracting parties only,\n    and inoperative as to everyone else—consumers, advocacy groups,\n    state utility commissions, elected officials acting parens patriae—\n    could scarcely provide the stability Mobile-Sierra aimed to secure.\n    Pp. 5–10.\n       (b) Whether the rates at issue qualify as “contract rates” for Mo\n    bile-Sierra purposes, and, if not, whether FERC had discretion to\n    treat them analogously are questions raised before, but not ruled\n    upon by, the D. C. Circuit. They remain open for that court’s consid\n    eration on remand.

Comm’n v. FERC, 520 F. 3d 464, 478 (2008) (per\ncuriam).\n   We reverse the D. C. Circuit’s judgment to the extent\nthat it rejects the application of Mobile-Sierra to noncon­\ntracting parties. Our decision in Morgan Stanley, an­\nnounced three months after the D. C. Circuit’s disposition,\nmade clear that the Mobile-Sierra public interest standard\nis not an exception to the statutory just-and-reasonable\nstandard; it is an application of that standard in the con­\ntext of rates set by contract. The “venerable Mobile-Sierra\ndoctrine” rests on “the stabilizing force of contracts.”\nMorgan Stanley, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19); see id.,\nat 22 (describing contract rates as “a key source of stabil­\nity”). To retain vitality, the doctrine must control FERC\nitself, and, we hold, challenges to contract rates brought\nby noncontracting as well as contracting parties.\n                               I\n  In a capacity market, in contrast to a wholesale energy\nmarket, an electricity provider purchases from a generator\nan option to buy a quantity of energy, rather than pur­\nchasing the energy itself. To maintain the reliability of\nthe grid, electricity providers generally purchase more\ncapacity, i.e., rights to acquire energy, than necessary to\n                     Cite as: 558 U.

For many\nyears in New England, the supply of capacity was barely\nsufficient to meet the region’s demand. FERC and New\nEngland’s generators, electricity providers, and power\ncustomers made several attempts to address this problem.\nThis case stems from the latest effort to design a solution.\n  In 2003, a group of generators sought to enter into\n“reliability must-run” agreements with the New England\nIndependent System Operator (ISO), which operates the\nregion’s transmission system.1 In its orders addressing\nthose agreements, FERC directed the ISO to develop a\nnew market mechanism that would set prices separately\nfor various geographical sub-regions. Devon Power LLC,\n103 FERC ¶61,082, pp. 61,266, 61,271 (2003).\n  In March 2004, the ISO proposed a market structure\nresponsive to FERC’s directions. See Devon Power LLC,\n107 FERC ¶61,240, p. 62,020 (2004). FERC set the matter\nfor hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ),\nwho issued a 177-page order largely accepting the ISO’s\nproposal. Devon Power LLC, 111 FERC ¶63,063, p. 65,205\n(2005). Several parties filed exceptions to the ALJ’s order;\non September 20, 2005, the full Commission heard argu­\nments on the proposed market structure, and thereafter\nestablished settlement procedures. Devon Power LLC, 113\nFERC ¶61,075, p. 61,271 (2005).\n  After four months of negotiations, on March 6, 2006, a\nsettlement was reached.

Each energy provider would be required to\npurchase enough capacity to meet its share of the “in­\nstalled capacity requirement,” i.e., the minimum level of\ncapacity needed to maintain reliability on the grid, as\ndetermined by the ISO. Id., at 62,307. For the three-year\ngap between the first auction and the time when the ca­\npacity procured in that auction would be provided,2 the\nAgreement prescribed a series of fixed, transition-period\npayments to capacity-supplying generators.           Id., at\n62,308–62,309.\n  The issue before us centers on §4.C of the Agreement\n(hereinafter Mobile-Sierra provision). Under that provi­\nsion, challenges to both transition-period payments and\nauction-clearing prices would be adjudicated under “the\n‘public interest’ standard of review set forth in United Gas\nPipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U. S. 332\n(1956)[,] and [FPC] v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U. S.\n348 (1956) (the ‘Mobile-Sierra’ doctrine).” App. 95. Mo\nbile-Sierra applies, §4.C instructs, “whether the [price is\nchallenged] by a Settling Party, a non-Settling Party, or\n[by] the FERC acting sua sponte.” Ibid.\n  FERC approved the Settlement Agreement, “finding\nthat as a package, it presents a just and reasonable out­\ncome for this proceeding consistent with the public inter­\nest.” 115 FERC, at 62,304. The Mobile-Sierra provision,\nFERC explicitly determined, “appropriately balances the\nneed for rate stability and the interests of the diverse\nentities who will be subject to the [forward capacity mar­\nket’s auction system].” Id., at 62,335.\n  Six of the eight objectors to the settlement sought re­\nview in the D. C. Circuit. For the most part, the Court of\n——————\n    2 The   transition period runs from December 1, 2006 to June 1, 2010.\n                  Cite as: 558 U.

But\nthe objectors prevailed on the Mobile-Sierra issue: The\nD. C. Circuit held that Mobile-Sierra applies only to con­\ntracting parties. Id., at 478. In this Court, the parties\nhave switched places. Defenders of the settlement, includ­\ning the Mobile-Sierra provision, are petitioners; objectors\nto the settlement, victorious in the Court of Appeals only\non the Mobile-Sierra issue, are respondents.\n   Because of the importance of the issue, and in light of\nour recent decision in Morgan Stanley, we granted certio­\nrari, 556 U. S. ___ (2009), to resolve this question: “[Does]\nMobile-Sierra’s public-interest standard appl[y] when a\ncontract rate is challenged by an entity that was not a\nparty to the contract[?]” Brief for Petitioners i. Satisfied\nthat the answer to that question is yes, we reverse the\nD. C. Circuit’s judgment insofar as it rejected application\nof Mobile-Sierra to noncontracting parties.\n                               II\n  The FPA gives FERC authority to regulate the “sale of\nelectric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.” See\n16 U. S. C. §824(b)(1). The Act allows regulated utilities\nto set rates unilaterally by tariff; alternatively, sellers and\nbuyers may agree on rates by contract. See §824d(c), (d).\nWhether set by tariff or contract, however, all rates must\nbe “just and reasonable.” §824d(a). Rates may be exam­\nined by the Commission, upon complaint or on its own\ninitiative, when a new or altered tariff or contract is filed\nor after a rate goes into effect. §§824d(e), 824e(a). Follow­\ning a hearing, the Commission may set aside any rate\nfound “unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or\npreferential,” and replace it with a just and reasonable\nrate. §824e(a).\n  The Mobile-Sierra doctrine originated in twin decisions\nannounced on the same day in 1956: United Gas Pipe Line\n6       NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v. MAINE PUB. \n\n                    UTIL. COMM’N                             \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nCo. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U. S. 332, and FPC v.\nSierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U. S. 348. Both concerned\nrates set by contract rather than by tariff. Mobile involved\nthe Natural Gas Act, which, like the FPA, requires utili­\nties to file all new rates with the regulatory commission.\n15 U. S. C. §717c(c). In Mobile, we rejected a gas utility’s\nargument that the file-all-new-rates requirement author­\nized the utility to abrogate a lawful contract with a pur­\nchaser simply by filing a new tariff. 350 U. S., at 336–337.\nFiling, we explained, was a precondition to changing a\nrate, not an authorization to do so in violation of a lawful\ncontract. Id., at 339–344; see Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 4).\n   The Sierra case involved a further issue. Not only had\nthe Commission erroneously concluded that a newly filed\ntariff superseded a contract rate. In addition, the Com­\nmission had suggested that, in any event, the contract\nrate, which the utility sought to escape, was itself unjust\nand unreasonable. The Commission thought that was so\n“solely because [the contract rate] yield[ed] less than a fair\nreturn on the [utility’s] net invested capital.” 350 U. S., at\n355.\n   The Commission’s suggestion prompted this Court to\nhome in on “the question of how the Commission may\nevaluate whether a contract rate is just and reasonable.”\nMorgan Stanley, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4). The\nSierra Court answered the question this way:\n    “[T]he Commission’s conclusion appears on its face to\n    be based on an erroneous standard. . . . [W]hile it may\n    be that the Commission may not normally impose\n    upon a public utility a rate which would produce less\n    than a fair return, it does not follow that the public\n    utility may not itself agree by contract to a rate af­\n    fording less than a fair return or that, if it does so, it\n    is entitled to be relieved of its improvident bar­\n                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n     gain. . . . In such circumstances the sole concern of the\n     Commission would seem to be whether the rate is so\n     low as to adversely affect the public interest—as where\n     it might impair the financial ability of the public util­\n     ity to continue its service, cast upon other consumers\n     an excessive burden, or be unduly discriminatory.”\n     350 U. S., at 354–355 (some emphasis added).\nIn a later case, we similarly explained: “The regulatory\nsystem created by the [FPA] is premised on contractual\nagreements voluntarily devised by the regulated compa­\nnies; it contemplates abrogation of these agreements only\nin circumstances of unequivocal public necessity.” Per\nmian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U. S. 747, 822 (1968).3\n   Two Terms ago, in Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S. ___, the\nCourt reaffirmed and clarified the Mobile-Sierra doctrine.\nThat case presented two questions: First, does the Mobile-\nSierra presumption (that contract rates freely negotiated\nbetween sophisticated parties meet the just and reason­\nable standard imposed by 16 U. S. C. §824d(a)) “apply only\nwhen FERC has had an initial opportunity to review a\ncontract rate without the presumption?” 554 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 1). “Second, does the presumption [generally]\nimpose as high a bar to challenges by purchasers of whole­\nsale electricity as it does to challenges by sellers?” Id., at\n——————\n  3 Consistent with the lead role of contracts recognized in Mobile-\n\nSierra, we held in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Memphis Light, Gas and\nWater Div., 358 U. S. 103, 110–113 (1958), that parties may contract\nout of the Mobile-Sierra presumption. They could do so, we ruled, by\nspecifying in their contracts that a new rate filed with the Commission\nwould supersede the contract rate. Courts of Appeals have approved an\noption midway between Mobile-Sierra and Memphis Light: A contract\nthat does not allow the seller to supersede the contract rate by filing a\nnew rate may nonetheless permit the Commission to set aside the\ncontract rate if it results in an unfair rate of return, without a further\nshowing that it adversely affects the public interest. See, e.g., Papago\nTribal Util. Auth. v. FERC, 723 F. 2d 950, 953 (CADC 1983); Louisiana\nPower & Light Co. v. FERC, 587 F. 2d 671, 675–676 (CA5 1979).\n8       NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v.

Answering no to\nthe first question and yes to the second, the Court empha­\nsized the essential role of contracts as a key factor foster­\ning stability in the electricity market, to the longrun bene­\nfit of consumers. Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 19, 22); see,\ne.g., Market-Based Rates ¶6, 72 Fed.

But Morgan Stanley’s reasoning strongly sug­\ngests that the D. C. Circuit’s negative answer misperceives\nthe aim, and diminishes the force, of the Mobile-Sierra\ndoctrine.\n   In unmistakably plain language, Morgan Stanley re­\nstated Mobile-Sierra’s instruction to the Commission:\nFERC “must presume that the rate set out in a freely\nnegotiated wholesale-energy contract meets the ‘just and\nreasonable’ requirement imposed by law. The presump­\ntion may be overcome only if FERC concludes that the\ncontract seriously harms the public interest.” 554 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 1). As our instruction to FERC in Morgan\nStanley conveys, the public interest standard is not, as the\nD. C.

Only if the rate was so\nlow that the seller might be unable to stay in business,\nthereby impairing the public interest, could the seller be\nexcused from performing its contract. That is what the\nCourt held in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas\nService Corp., 350 U. S. 332 (1956), and FPC v. Sierra\nPacific Power Co., 350 U. S. 348 (1956).\n  In the second chapter the Court unwisely and incor\nrectly held that the same rule should apply to a buyer who\nhad been forced by unprecedented market conditions to\nenter into a long-term contract to buy energy at abnor\nmally high prices. The Court held the Federal Energy\nRegulatory Commission (FERC) could not set aside such a\ncontract as unjust and unreasonable, even though it sad\ndled consumers with a duty to pay prices that would be\nconsidered unjust and unreasonable under normal market\n2         NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 1). And that pre\nsumption, according to the Court, is a simple application\nof the just-and-reasonable standard to contract rates, not\na different standard of review. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6)\n(rejecting the “obviously indefensible proposition that a\nstandard different from the statutory just-and-reasonable\nstandard applies to contract rates”).

And the Mobile-Sierra line of\ncases did not “mandate a ‘serious harm’ standard of re\nview,” much less “require any assumption that high rates\nand low rates impose symmetric burdens on the public\ninterest.” Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7)\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting). Instead, “the statement in\nPermian Basin about ‘unequivocal public necessity,’ 390\nU.

Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 8). It does not establish a new standard that\napplies as well to a “high-rate challenge” brought by pur\nchasers. Ibid.\n   But even accepting Morgan Stanley as the law, the\nCourt unwisely goes further today. In this third chapter of\nthe Mobile-Sierra story, the Court applies a rule—one\ndesigned initially to protect the enforceability of freely\nnegotiated contracts against parties who seek a release\nfrom their obligations—to impose a special burden on\nthird parties exercising their statutory right to object to\nunjust and unreasonable rates. This application of the\nrule represents a quantum leap from the modest origin set\nforth in the first chapter of this tale. As the Court of\nAppeals correctly concluded in the opinion that the Court\nsets aside today: “This case is clearly outside the scope of\nthe Mobile-Sierra doctrine.” Maine Pub. Util.

As that court recog\nnized, and the majority does not change today, the Mobile-Sierra\nstandard in fact “makes it harder for [respondents] to successfully\n4         NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v.

But, the Court asks, “[I]f\nFERC itself must presume just and reasonable a contract\nrate resulting from fair, arms-length negotiations, how can\nit be maintained that noncontracting parties nevertheless\nmay escape that presumption?” Ante, at 9. This Court’s\nunderstanding of Sierra provides an answer. “Sierra was\ngrounded in the commonsense notion that ‘[i]n wholesale\nmarkets, the party charging the rate and the party\ncharged [are] often sophisticated businesses enjoying\npresumptively equal bargaining power, who could be\nexpected to negotiate a “just and reasonable” rate as be\ntween the two of them.’ ” Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 17) (quoting Verizon Communications Inc. v.\nFCC, 535 U. S. 467, 479 (2002); emphasis added). This\n“commonsense notion” supports the rule requiring FERC\nto apply a presumption against letting a party out of its\nown contract, as the D. C. Circuit recognized. 520 F. 3d,\nat 478 (“The Mobile-Sierra doctrine applies a more defer\nential standard of review to preserve the terms of the\nbargain as between the contracting parties”). It does not,\nhowever, support a rule requiring FERC to apply a pre\nsumption against abrogating any rate set by contract,\neven when, as in this case, a noncontracting party may be\nrequired in practice to pay a rate it did not agree to.\n   The Court further reasons that “confinement of Mobile-\nSierra to rate challenges by contracting parties diminishes\nthe animating purpose of the doctrine,” which is ensuring\nthe stability of contract-based supply arrangements. Ante,\nat 9. Maybe so, but applying Mobile-Sierra to rate chal\nlenges by noncontracting parties loses sight of the animat\ning purpose of the FPA, which is “the protection of the\npublic interest.” Sierra, 350 U.

I do not doubt\nthat stable energy markets are important to the public\ninterest, but “under the FPA, Congress has charged\nFERC, not the courts, with balancing the short-term and\nlong-term interests of consumers” under the just-and\nreasonable standard of review. Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 9) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). The Court\ntoday imposes additional limits upon FERC’s ability to\nprotect that interest. If a third-party wholesale buyer can\nshow a rate harms the public interest (perhaps because it\nis too high to be just and reasonable under normal review),\nbut cannot show it seriously harms the public, FERC may\ndo nothing about it.3\n   The Court assures respondents that the “public interest\nstandard” does not “overlook third-party interests” and is\n“framed with a view to their protection.” Ante, at 8, 9.\nPerhaps in practice the Mobile-Sierra doctrine will protect\nthird parties’ interests, and the public interest, just as\nwell as the so-called “ordinary” just-and-reasonable stan\ndard.

Furthermore, the Court\ntoday reiterates that the doctrine poses a high bar. See\nante, at 7–8.\n   It was sensible to require a contracting party to show\nsomething more than its own desire to get out of what\nproved to be a bad bargain before FERC could abrogate\nthe parties’ bargain.

But I note the Court’s assertion\nthat the Mobile-Sierra doctrine protects “third-party interests,” ante, at\n9, is a new twist on the “public interest standard” as traditionally\nunderstood. As the Court recognized in Morgan Stanley, one conse\nquence of applying Mobile-Sierra is that “ ‘the sole concern of the\nCommission’ ” is the public interest, and FERC cannot consider, for\nexample, whether a rate guarantees a sufficient rate of return to a\nregulated entity. 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (quoting FPC v. Sierra\nPacific Power Co., 350 U. S. 348, 355 (1956)); see also Morgan Stanley,\n554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17, n. 3). In addition to requiring that\nFERC find some greater degree of harm to the public than would be\nrequired under the ordinary just-and-reasonable standard, therefore,\nthe Mobile-Sierra doctrine leaves little room for respondents—at least\none of which did not negotiate the rate but must nonetheless purchase\nelectricity at that price in the forward capacity market unless it self\nsupplies its capacity—to assert their private interest in making a rate\nchallenge. The Court suggests that FERC could set aside a rate under\nthe public interest standard if the contract established favorable rates\nbetween allied businesses to the detriment of other wholesale custom\ners, ante, at 9, but has not spelled out whether a challenger would still\nhave to show that circumstance harmed the public interest. It remains\nunclear whether a noncontracting party that must purchase or sell\nelectricity at a rate it did not negotiate could argue that a rate fails the\n“public interest standard” because the rate is detrimental to that\nentity’s private interest.\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

S. 348—requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commis\n  sion (FERC) to presume that an electricity rate set by a freely negoti\n  ated wholesale-energy contract meets the Federal Power Act’s (FPA)\n  “just and reasonable” prescription, 16 U. S. C. §7824d(a); the pre\n  sumption may be overcome only if FERC concludes that the contract\n  seriously harms the public interest. Morgan Stanley Capital Group\n  Inc. v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Cty., 554 U. S. ___, ___.\n     For many years, New England’s supply of electricity capacity was\n  barely sufficient to meet the region’s demand. FERC and New Eng\n  land’s generators, electricity providers, and power customers made\n  several attempts to address the problem. This case arises from the\n  latest effort to design a solution. Concerned parties reached a com\n  prehensive settlement agreement (Agreement) that, inter alia, estab\n  lished rate-setting mechanisms for sales of energy capacity and pro\n  vided that the Mobile-Sierra public interest standard would govern\n  rate challenges. FERC approved the Agreement, finding that it pre\n  sents a just and reasonable outcome that is consistent with the public\n  interest. Objectors to the settlement sought review in the D. C. Cir\n  cuit, which largely rejected their efforts to overturn FERC’s approval\n  order, but agreed with them that when a challenge to a contract rate\n  is brought by noncontracting third parties, Mobile-Sierra’s public in\n  terest standard does not apply.\nHeld: The Mobile-Sierra presumption does not depend on the identity of\n the complainant who seeks FERC investigation.

Pp. 5–11.\n       (a) Morgan Stanley did not reach the question presented here, but\n    its reasoning strongly suggests that the D. C. Circuit’s holding mis\n    perceives the aim, and diminishes the force, of the Mobile-Sierra doc\n    trine. Announced three months after the Court of Appeals’ disposi\n    tion in this case, Morgan Stanley reaffirmed Mobile-Sierra’s\n    instruction to FERC to “presume that the rate set out in a freely ne\n    gotiated . . . contract meets the ‘just and reasonable’ requirement”\n    unless “FERC concludes that the contract seriously harms the public\n    interest.” 554 U. S., at ___. The Morgan Stanley opinion makes it\n    unmistakably clear that the public interest standard is not, as the\n    D. C. Circuit suggested, independent of, and sometimes at odds with,\n    the “just and reasonable” standard. Rather, the public interest stan\n    dard defines “what it means for a rate to satisfy the just-and\n    reasonable standard in the contract context.” Id., at ___. And if\n    FERC itself must presume just and reasonable a contract rate result\n    ing from fair, arms-length negotiations, noncontracting parties may\n    not escape that presumption. Moreover, the Mobile-Sierra doctrine\n    does not neglect third-party interests; it directs FERC to reject a con\n    tract rate that “seriously harms the consuming public.” 554 U. S., at\n    ___. Finally, the D. C. Circuit’s confinement of Mobile-Sierra to rate\n    challenges by contracting parties diminishes the doctrine’s animating\n    purpose: promotion of “the stability of supply arrangements which all\n    agree is essential to the health of the [energy] industry.” Mobile, 350\n    U. S., at 344.

Our decision in Morgan Stanley, an­\nnounced three months after the D. C. Circuit’s disposition,\nmade clear that the Mobile-Sierra public interest standard\nis not an exception to the statutory just-and-reasonable\nstandard; it is an application of that standard in the con­\ntext of rates set by contract. The “venerable Mobile-Sierra\ndoctrine” rests on “the stabilizing force of contracts.”\nMorgan Stanley, 554 U.

To retain vitality, the doctrine must control FERC\nitself, and, we hold, challenges to contract rates brought\nby noncontracting as well as contracting parties.\n                               I\n  In a capacity market, in contrast to a wholesale energy\nmarket, an electricity provider purchases from a generator\nan option to buy a quantity of energy, rather than pur­\nchasing the energy itself.

For many\nyears in New England, the supply of capacity was barely\nsufficient to meet the region’s demand. FERC and New\nEngland’s generators, electricity providers, and power\ncustomers made several attempts to address this problem.\nThis case stems from the latest effort to design a solution.\n  In 2003, a group of generators sought to enter into\n“reliability must-run” agreements with the New England\nIndependent System Operator (ISO), which operates the\nregion’s transmission system.1 In its orders addressing\nthose agreements, FERC directed the ISO to develop a\nnew market mechanism that would set prices separately\nfor various geographical sub-regions. Devon Power LLC,\n103 FERC ¶61,082, pp. 61,266, 61,271 (2003).\n  In March 2004, the ISO proposed a market structure\nresponsive to FERC’s directions. See Devon Power LLC,\n107 FERC ¶61,240, p. 62,020 (2004). FERC set the matter\nfor hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ),\nwho issued a 177-page order largely accepting the ISO’s\nproposal. Devon Power LLC, 111 FERC ¶63,063, p. 65,205\n(2005). Several parties filed exceptions to the ALJ’s order;\non September 20, 2005, the full Commission heard argu­\nments on the proposed market structure, and thereafter\nestablished settlement procedures. Devon Power LLC, 113\nFERC ¶61,075, p. 61,271 (2005).\n  After four months of negotiations, on March 6, 2006, a\nsettlement was reached.

Each energy provider would be required to\npurchase enough capacity to meet its share of the “in­\nstalled capacity requirement,” i.e., the minimum level of\ncapacity needed to maintain reliability on the grid, as\ndetermined by the ISO. Id., at 62,307. For the three-year\ngap between the first auction and the time when the ca­\npacity procured in that auction would be provided,2 the\nAgreement prescribed a series of fixed, transition-period\npayments to capacity-supplying generators.           Id., at\n62,308–62,309.\n  The issue before us centers on §4.C of the Agreement\n(hereinafter Mobile-Sierra provision). Under that provi­\nsion, challenges to both transition-period payments and\nauction-clearing prices would be adjudicated under “the\n‘public interest’ standard of review set forth in United Gas\nPipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U. S. 332\n(1956)[,] and [FPC] v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U. S.\n348 (1956) (the ‘Mobile-Sierra’ doctrine).” App. 95. Mo\nbile-Sierra applies, §4.C instructs, “whether the [price is\nchallenged] by a Settling Party, a non-Settling Party, or\n[by] the FERC acting sua sponte.” Ibid.\n  FERC approved the Settlement Agreement, “finding\nthat as a package, it presents a just and reasonable out­\ncome for this proceeding consistent with the public inter­\nest.” 115 FERC, at 62,304. The Mobile-Sierra provision,\nFERC explicitly determined, “appropriately balances the\nneed for rate stability and the interests of the diverse\nentities who will be subject to the [forward capacity mar­\nket’s auction system].” Id., at 62,335.\n  Six of the eight objectors to the settlement sought re­\nview in the D.

But\nthe objectors prevailed on the Mobile-Sierra issue: The\nD. C. Circuit held that Mobile-Sierra applies only to con­\ntracting parties. Id., at 478. In this Court, the parties\nhave switched places. Defenders of the settlement, includ­\ning the Mobile-Sierra provision, are petitioners; objectors\nto the settlement, victorious in the Court of Appeals only\non the Mobile-Sierra issue, are respondents.\n   Because of the importance of the issue, and in light of\nour recent decision in Morgan Stanley, we granted certio­\nrari, 556 U. S. ___ (2009), to resolve this question: “[Does]\nMobile-Sierra’s public-interest standard appl[y] when a\ncontract rate is challenged by an entity that was not a\nparty to the contract[?]” Brief for Petitioners i. Satisfied\nthat the answer to that question is yes, we reverse the\nD. C. Circuit’s judgment insofar as it rejected application\nof Mobile-Sierra to noncontracting parties.\n                               II\n  The FPA gives FERC authority to regulate the “sale of\nelectric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.” See\n16 U. S. C. §824(b)(1). The Act allows regulated utilities\nto set rates unilaterally by tariff; alternatively, sellers and\nbuyers may agree on rates by contract. See §824d(c), (d).\nWhether set by tariff or contract, however, all rates must\nbe “just and reasonable.” §824d(a). Rates may be exam­\nined by the Commission, upon complaint or on its own\ninitiative, when a new or altered tariff or contract is filed\nor after a rate goes into effect. §§824d(e), 824e(a). Follow­\ning a hearing, the Commission may set aside any rate\nfound “unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or\npreferential,” and replace it with a just and reasonable\nrate. §824e(a).\n  The Mobile-Sierra doctrine originated in twin decisions\nannounced on the same day in 1956: United Gas Pipe Line\n6       NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v. MAINE PUB. \n\n                    UTIL. COMM’N                             \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nCo. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U. S. 332, and FPC v.\nSierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U. S. 348. Both concerned\nrates set by contract rather than by tariff. Mobile involved\nthe Natural Gas Act, which, like the FPA, requires utili­\nties to file all new rates with the regulatory commission.\n15 U. S. C. §717c(c). In Mobile, we rejected a gas utility’s\nargument that the file-all-new-rates requirement author­\nized the utility to abrogate a lawful contract with a pur­\nchaser simply by filing a new tariff. 350 U. S., at 336–337.\nFiling, we explained, was a precondition to changing a\nrate, not an authorization to do so in violation of a lawful\ncontract. Id., at 339–344; see Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 4).\n   The Sierra case involved a further issue. Not only had\nthe Commission erroneously concluded that a newly filed\ntariff superseded a contract rate. In addition, the Com­\nmission had suggested that, in any event, the contract\nrate, which the utility sought to escape, was itself unjust\nand unreasonable. The Commission thought that was so\n“solely because [the contract rate] yield[ed] less than a fair\nreturn on the [utility’s] net invested capital.” 350 U. S., at\n355.\n   The Commission’s suggestion prompted this Court to\nhome in on “the question of how the Commission may\nevaluate whether a contract rate is just and reasonable.”\nMorgan Stanley, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4). The\nSierra Court answered the question this way:\n    “[T]he Commission’s conclusion appears on its face to\n    be based on an erroneous standard. . . . [W]hile it may\n    be that the Commission may not normally impose\n    upon a public utility a rate which would produce less\n    than a fair return, it does not follow that the public\n    utility may not itself agree by contract to a rate af­\n    fording less than a fair return or that, if it does so, it\n    is entitled to be relieved of its improvident bar­\n                     Cite as: 558 U.

In such circumstances the sole concern of the\n     Commission would seem to be whether the rate is so\n     low as to adversely affect the public interest—as where\n     it might impair the financial ability of the public util­\n     ity to continue its service, cast upon other consumers\n     an excessive burden, or be unduly discriminatory.”\n     350 U. S., at 354–355 (some emphasis added).\nIn a later case, we similarly explained: “The regulatory\nsystem created by the [FPA] is premised on contractual\nagreements voluntarily devised by the regulated compa­\nnies; it contemplates abrogation of these agreements only\nin circumstances of unequivocal public necessity.” Per\nmian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U. S. 747, 822 (1968).3\n   Two Terms ago, in Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S. ___, the\nCourt reaffirmed and clarified the Mobile-Sierra doctrine.\nThat case presented two questions: First, does the Mobile-\nSierra presumption (that contract rates freely negotiated\nbetween sophisticated parties meet the just and reason­\nable standard imposed by 16 U. S. C. §824d(a)) “apply only\nwhen FERC has had an initial opportunity to review a\ncontract rate without the presumption?” 554 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 1). “Second, does the presumption [generally]\nimpose as high a bar to challenges by purchasers of whole­\nsale electricity as it does to challenges by sellers?” Id., at\n——————\n  3 Consistent with the lead role of contracts recognized in Mobile-\n\nSierra, we held in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Memphis Light, Gas and\nWater Div., 358 U. S. 103, 110–113 (1958), that parties may contract\nout of the Mobile-Sierra presumption. They could do so, we ruled, by\nspecifying in their contracts that a new rate filed with the Commission\nwould supersede the contract rate. Courts of Appeals have approved an\noption midway between Mobile-Sierra and Memphis Light: A contract\nthat does not allow the seller to supersede the contract rate by filing a\nnew rate may nonetheless permit the Commission to set aside the\ncontract rate if it results in an unfair rate of return, without a further\nshowing that it adversely affects the public interest. See, e.g., Papago\nTribal Util. Auth. v. FERC, 723 F. 2d 950, 953 (CADC 1983); Louisiana\nPower & Light Co. v. FERC, 587 F. 2d 671, 675–676 (CA5 1979).\n8       NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v.

Answering no to\nthe first question and yes to the second, the Court empha­\nsized the essential role of contracts as a key factor foster­\ning stability in the electricity market, to the longrun bene­\nfit of consumers. Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 19, 22); see,\ne.g., Market-Based Rates ¶6, 72 Fed. Reg. 39906 (2007)\n(noting chilling effect on investments caused by “uncer­\ntainties regarding rate stability and contract sanctity”);\nNevada Power Co. v. Duke Energy Trading & Marketing,\nL. L.

But Morgan Stanley’s reasoning strongly sug­\ngests that the D. C. Circuit’s negative answer misperceives\nthe aim, and diminishes the force, of the Mobile-Sierra\ndoctrine.\n   In unmistakably plain language, Morgan Stanley re­\nstated Mobile-Sierra’s instruction to the Commission:\nFERC “must presume that the rate set out in a freely\nnegotiated wholesale-energy contract meets the ‘just and\nreasonable’ requirement imposed by law. The presump­\ntion may be overcome only if FERC concludes that the\ncontract seriously harms the public interest.” 554 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 1). As our instruction to FERC in Morgan\nStanley conveys, the public interest standard is not, as the\nD. C. Circuit presented it, a standard independent of, and\nsometimes at odds with, the “just and reasonable” stan­\ndard, see 520 F. 3d, at 478; rather, the public interest\nstandard defines “what it means for a rate to satisfy the\njust-and-reasonable standard in the contract context.”\n                     Cite as: 558 U.

And if\nFERC itself must presume just and reasonable a contract\nrate resulting from fair, arms-length negotiations, how can\nit be maintained that noncontracting parties nevertheless\nmay escape that presumption? 4\n   Moreover, the Mobile-Sierra doctrine does not overlook\nthird-party interests; it is framed with a view to their\nprotection. The doctrine directs the Commission to reject\na contract rate that “seriously harms the consuming pub­\nlic.” Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17); see\nVerizon Communications Inc. v. FCC, 535 U. S. 467, 479\n(2002) (When a buyer and a seller agree upon a rate, “the\nprincipal regulatory responsibility [i]s not to relieve a\ncontracting party of an unreasonable rate, . . . but to pro­\ntect against potential discrimination by favorable contract\nrates between allied businesses to the detriment of other\nwholesale customers.” (Emphasis added.)).\n   Finally, as earlier indicated, see supra, at 7–8, the D. C.\nCircuit’s confinement of Mobile-Sierra to rate challenges\nby contracting parties diminishes the animating purpose\nof the doctrine: promotion of “the stability of supply ar­\nrangements which all agree is essential to the health of\nthe [energy] industry.” Mobile, 350 U.

These\nreasons for the presumption explain why FERC, surely not legally\nbound by a contract rate, must apply the presumption and, correspond­\ningly, why third parties are similarly controlled by it.\n10        NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v.

A presumption\napplicable to contracting parties only, and inoperative as\nto everyone else—consumers, advocacy groups, state\nutility commissions, elected officials acting parens pa\ntriae—could scarcely provide the stability Mobile-Sierra\naimed to secure.5\n   We therefore hold that the Mobile-Sierra presumption\ndoes not depend on the identity of the complainant who\nseeks FERC investigation. The presumption is not limited\nto challenges to contract rates brought by contracting\nparties. It applies, as well, to challenges initiated by third\nparties.\n                               III\n  The objectors to the settlement appearing before us\nmaintain that the rates at issue in this case—the auction\nrates and the transition payments—are prescriptions of\ngeneral applicability rather than “contractually negotiated\nrates,” hence Mobile-Sierra is inapplicable.

Only if the rate was so\nlow that the seller might be unable to stay in business,\nthereby impairing the public interest, could the seller be\nexcused from performing its contract. That is what the\nCourt held in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas\nService Corp., 350 U. S. 332 (1956), and FPC v. Sierra\nPacific Power Co., 350 U. S. 348 (1956).\n  In the second chapter the Court unwisely and incor\nrectly held that the same rule should apply to a buyer who\nhad been forced by unprecedented market conditions to\nenter into a long-term contract to buy energy at abnor\nmally high prices. The Court held the Federal Energy\nRegulatory Commission (FERC) could not set aside such a\ncontract as unjust and unreasonable, even though it sad\ndled consumers with a duty to pay prices that would be\nconsidered unjust and unreasonable under normal market\n2         NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v.

Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of\nSnohomish Cty., 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 1).\n   The Court held in Morgan Stanley that Mobile-Sierra\nestablished a presumption: FERC “must presume that the\nrate set out in a freely negotiated wholesale-energy con\ntract meets the ‘just and reasonable’ requirement imposed\nby law.” 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1). And that pre\nsumption, according to the Court, is a simple application\nof the just-and-reasonable standard to contract rates, not\na different standard of review. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6)\n(rejecting the “obviously indefensible proposition that a\nstandard different from the statutory just-and-reasonable\nstandard applies to contract rates”). But applying the\npresumption nonetheless sets a higher bar for a rate chal\nlenge.1 FERC may abrogate the rate only if the public\ninterest is seriously harmed. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 22)\n(“[U]nder the Mobile-Sierra presumption, setting aside a\ncontract rate requires a finding of ‘unequivocal public\nnecessity,’ ” Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U.

And the Mobile-Sierra line of\ncases did not “mandate a ‘serious harm’ standard of re\nview,” much less “require any assumption that high rates\nand low rates impose symmetric burdens on the public\ninterest.” Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7)\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting). Instead, “the statement in\nPermian Basin about ‘unequivocal public necessity,’ 390\nU. S., at 822, speaks to the difficulty of establishing injury\nto the public interest in the context of a low-rate chal\nlenge,” i.e., one brought by sellers of electricity. Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 8). It does not establish a new standard that\napplies as well to a “high-rate challenge” brought by pur\nchasers. Ibid.\n   But even accepting Morgan Stanley as the law, the\nCourt unwisely goes further today. In this third chapter of\nthe Mobile-Sierra story, the Court applies a rule—one\ndesigned initially to protect the enforceability of freely\nnegotiated contracts against parties who seek a release\nfrom their obligations—to impose a special burden on\nthird parties exercising their statutory right to object to\nunjust and unreasonable rates. This application of the\nrule represents a quantum leap from the modest origin set\nforth in the first chapter of this tale. As the Court of\nAppeals correctly concluded in the opinion that the Court\nsets aside today: “This case is clearly outside the scope of\nthe Mobile-Sierra doctrine.” Maine Pub. Util. Comm’n v.\nFERC, 520 F. 3d 464, 477 (CADC 2008) (per curiam).\n   As the D. C. Circuit noted,2 “[c]ourts have rarely men\n——————\n  2 Because the D. C. Circuit’s opinion was written before this Court’s\n\ndecision in Morgan Stanley, that court’s purported error in describing\nthe Mobile-Sierra doctrine as an “exception” to the just-and-reasonable\nstandard, 520 F. 3d, at 477, is understandable. As that court recog\nnized, and the majority does not change today, the Mobile-Sierra\nstandard in fact “makes it harder for [respondents] to successfully\n4         NRG POWER MARKETING, LLC v.

But, the Court asks, “[I]f\nFERC itself must presume just and reasonable a contract\nrate resulting from fair, arms-length negotiations, how can\nit be maintained that noncontracting parties nevertheless\nmay escape that presumption?” Ante, at 9. This Court’s\nunderstanding of Sierra provides an answer. “Sierra was\ngrounded in the commonsense notion that ‘[i]n wholesale\nmarkets, the party charging the rate and the party\ncharged [are] often sophisticated businesses enjoying\npresumptively equal bargaining power, who could be\nexpected to negotiate a “just and reasonable” rate as be\ntween the two of them.’ ” Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 17) (quoting Verizon Communications Inc. v.\nFCC, 535 U. S. 467, 479 (2002); emphasis added). This\n“commonsense notion” supports the rule requiring FERC\nto apply a presumption against letting a party out of its\nown contract, as the D. C. Circuit recognized. 520 F. 3d,\nat 478 (“The Mobile-Sierra doctrine applies a more defer\nential standard of review to preserve the terms of the\nbargain as between the contracting parties”). It does not,\nhowever, support a rule requiring FERC to apply a pre\nsumption against abrogating any rate set by contract,\neven when, as in this case, a noncontracting party may be\nrequired in practice to pay a rate it did not agree to.\n   The Court further reasons that “confinement of Mobile-\nSierra to rate challenges by contracting parties diminishes\nthe animating purpose of the doctrine,” which is ensuring\nthe stability of contract-based supply arrangements. Ante,\nat 9. Maybe so, but applying Mobile-Sierra to rate chal\nlenges by noncontracting parties loses sight of the animat\ning purpose of the FPA, which is “the protection of the\npublic interest.” Sierra, 350 U. S., at 355. That interest is\n—————— \n\nchallenge rates.” 520 F. 3d, at 478. \n\n                      Cite as: 558 U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (STEVENS, J., dissenting)\n(quoting Permian Basin, 390 U. S., at 793). I do not doubt\nthat stable energy markets are important to the public\ninterest, but “under the FPA, Congress has charged\nFERC, not the courts, with balancing the short-term and\nlong-term interests of consumers” under the just-and\nreasonable standard of review. Morgan Stanley, 554 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 9) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). The Court\ntoday imposes additional limits upon FERC’s ability to\nprotect that interest. If a third-party wholesale buyer can\nshow a rate harms the public interest (perhaps because it\nis too high to be just and reasonable under normal review),\nbut cannot show it seriously harms the public, FERC may\ndo nothing about it.3\n   The Court assures respondents that the “public interest\nstandard” does not “overlook third-party interests” and is\n“framed with a view to their protection.” Ante, at 8, 9.\nPerhaps in practice the Mobile-Sierra doctrine will protect\nthird parties’ interests, and the public interest, just as\nwell as the so-called “ordinary” just-and-reasonable stan\ndard. But respondents are rightly skeptical.

Furthermore, the Court\ntoday reiterates that the doctrine poses a high bar. See\nante, at 7–8.\n   It was sensible to require a contracting party to show\nsomething more than its own desire to get out of what\nproved to be a bad bargain before FERC could abrogate\nthe parties’ bargain. It is not sensible, nor authorized by\nthe statute, for the Court to change the de facto standard\nof review whenever a rate is set by private contract, based\nsolely on the Court’s view that contract stability should be\n——————\n  4 In my view, “whether a rate is ‘just and reasonable’ is measured\n\nagainst the public interest, not the private interests of regulated\n[parties].” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 7). But I note the Court’s assertion\nthat the Mobile-Sierra doctrine protects “third-party interests,” ante, at\n9, is a new twist on the “public interest standard” as traditionally\nunderstood. As the Court recognized in Morgan Stanley, one conse\nquence of applying Mobile-Sierra is that “ ‘the sole concern of the\nCommission’ ” is the public interest, and FERC cannot consider, for\nexample, whether a rate guarantees a sufficient rate of return to a\nregulated entity. 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (quoting FPC v. Sierra\nPacific Power Co., 350 U. S. 348, 355 (1956)); see also Morgan Stanley,\n554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17, n. 3). In addition to requiring that\nFERC find some greater degree of harm to the public than would be\nrequired under the ordinary just-and-reasonable standard, therefore,\nthe Mobile-Sierra doctrine leaves little room for respondents—at least\none of which did not negotiate the rate but must nonetheless purchase\nelectricity at that price in the forward capacity market unless it self\nsupplies its capacity—to assert their private interest in making a rate\nchallenge. The Court suggests that FERC could set aside a rate under\nthe public interest standard if the contract established favorable rates\nbetween allied businesses to the detriment of other wholesale custom\ners, ante, at 9, but has not spelled out whether a challenger would still\nhave to show that circumstance harmed the public interest. It remains\nunclear whether a noncontracting party that must purchase or sell\nelectricity at a rate it did not negotiate could argue that a rate fails the\n“public interest standard” because the rate is detrimental to that\nentity’s private interest.\n                 Cite as: 558 U.
