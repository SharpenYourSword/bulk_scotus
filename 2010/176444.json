Lux seeks an injunction requiring the Virginia\nState Board of Elections to count signatures that he col\nlected in an effort to place himself on the congressional\nballot. The application is denied.\n   Lux is an independent candidate for the U. S. House of\nRepresentatives in Virginia’s Seventh Congressional\nDistrict. Under Virginia law, an independent candidate\nfor Congress must obtain 1,000 signatures from voters\nregistered in the relevant congressional district in order to\nappear on the ballot. Va. Code Ann. §24.2–506 (Lexis\n2010 Cum. Supp.). That same provision requires, among\nother things, that each signature be witnessed by a resi\ndent of that district. Ibid.\n  Although Lux is a candidate for the Seventh District, he\nis a resident of Virginia’s First District. As a result, he\ncannot serve as a witness for signatures from Seventh\nDistrict residents. Despite that fact, Lux witnessed 1,063\nof the 1,224 signatures collected on his behalf.

Lux\nunsuccessfully sought an injunction requiring the Board to\ndo so from the District Court for the Eastern District of\nVirginia and from the Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit.\n   To obtain injunctive relief from a Circuit Justice, an\napplicant must demonstrate that “the legal rights at issue\nare ‘indisputably clear.’ ” Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.\nv.

A\nCircuit Justice’s issuance of an injunction “does not simply\nsuspend judicial alteration of the status quo but grants\njudicial intervention that has been withheld by lower\ncourts,” and therefore “demands a significantly higher\njustification” than that required for a stay. Ohio Citizens\nfor Responsible Energy, Inc. v. NRC, 479 U. S. 1312, 1313\n(1986) (SCALIA, J., in chambers).\n   Lux does not meet this standard. He may very well be\ncorrect that the Fourth Circuit precedent relied on by the\nDistrict Court—Libertarian Party of Va. v. Davis, 766\nF. 2d 865 (1985)—has been undermined by our more\nrecent decisions addressing the validity of petition circula\ntion restrictions. See Meyer v. Grant, 486 U. S. 414, 422,\n428 (1988) (invalidating a law criminalizing circulator\ncompensation and describing petition circulation as “core\npolitical speech”); Buckley v. American Constitutional Law\nFoundation, Inc., 525 U. S. 182, 186–187 (1999) (holding\nunconstitutional a requirement that initiative petition\ncirculators be registered voters). At the same time, we\nwere careful in American Constitutional Law Foundation\nto differentiate between registration requirements, which\nwere before the Court, and residency requirements, which\nwere not.
