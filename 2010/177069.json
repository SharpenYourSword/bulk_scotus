MICHAEL CASPER ET AL.\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n              No. 10–67. Decided October 12, 2010\n\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\njoins, dissenting from denial of certiorari.\n   The President of the United States gave a speech open\nto the public, from which Leslie Weise and Alex Young\nallege they were forcibly ejected. Their transgression was\nto have arrived at the event in a car that displayed a\nbumper sticker reading “No More Blood For Oil.” After\nthey were marched out, they allege, Secret Service officials\nconfirmed to them that the bumper sticker was the reason\nfor their exclusion.\n   I cannot see how reasonable public officials, or any staff\nor volunteers under their direction, could have viewed the\nbumper sticker as a permissible reason for depriving\nWeise and Young of access to the event. Nevertheless, the\nCourt of Appeals held respondents entitled to qualified\nimmunity because “no specific authority instructs this\ncourt . . . how to treat the ejection of a silent attendee from\nan official speech based on the attendee’s protected ex\npression outside the speech area.” 593 F. 3d 1163, 1170\n(CA10 2010). No “specific authority” should have been\nneeded; “[f]or at least a [half]-century, this Court has\nmade clear that . . . [the government] may not deny a\nbenefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitu\ntionally protected interests.” Perry v. Sindermann, 408\nU. S. 593, 597 (1972). As Judge Holloway noted in his\nincisive dissent, solidly established law “may apply with\nobvious clarity” even to conduct startling in its novelty.\n2                    WEISE v. CASPER\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n593 F. 3d, at 1177 (quoting Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U. S. 730,\n741 (2002); emphasis deleted).\n  The Court of Appeals suggested that this Court’s deci\nsion in Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisex\nual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557 (1995), could have\njustified a decision to exclude individuals who appear to\ndisagree with the President’s views. But the comparison\nserves only to highlight the unlawfulness of Weise’s and\nYoung’s alleged treatment: Not only was this an official\npresentation of the President’s views, not a private act of\nexpression as in Hurley; in addition, unlike the Hurley\nplaintiff who sought to engage in competing expression,\nWeise and Young were “silent attendee[s],” 593 F. 3d, at\n1170 (emphasis added). Their presence alone cannot have\naffected the President’s message. Therefore, ejecting them\nfor holding discordant views could only have been a repri\nsal for the expression conveyed by the bumper sticker.\n“Official reprisal for protected speech ‘offends the Consti\ntution because it threatens to inhibit exercise of the pro\ntected right.’ ” Hartman v. Moore, 547 U. S. 250, 256\n(2006) (quoting Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U. S. 574, 588,\nn. 10 (1998); brackets omitted).\n  I see only one arguable reason for deferring the question\nthis case presents. Respondents were volunteers following\ninstructions from White House officials. The Volunteer\nProtection Act of 1997, 111 Stat. 218, 42 U. S. C. §14501 et\nseq., had respondents invoked it in the courts below, might\nhave shielded them from liability. Federal officials them\nselves, however, gain no shelter from that Act. Suits\nagainst the officials responsible for Weise’s and Young’s\nouster remain pending and may offer this Court an oppor\ntunity to take up the issue avoided today.\n</pre>", "id": 177069, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2010/10/12/Weise_v._Casper.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                  Cite as: 562 U.
