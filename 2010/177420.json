NATHAN CAIN ET AL.\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n             No. 09–9515. Decided October 18, 2010 \n\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, dissenting from denial of certiorari.\n   Petitioner Anthony Pitre, a Louisiana state prisoner,\nstopped taking his HIV medication to protest his transfer\nto a prison facility. He alleges that respondents at the\nfacility punished him for this decision by subjecting him to\nhard labor in 100-degree heat. According to Pitre, respon\ndents repeatedly denied his requests for lighter duty more\nappropriate to his medical condition, even after prison\nofficials twice thought his condition sufficiently serious to\nrush him to an emergency room. In response to one such\nrequest, respondent Cain expressly acknowledged in a\nletter attached to Pitre’s complaint that Pitre was “dealing\nwith unnecessary pain and suffering, as well as cruel and\nunusual punishment,” but he accused Pitre of “bringing it\non himself” by refusing to take his medication. App. F to\nPet. for Cert. (Exh. A-2). Cain concluded, “If you are\nsuffering because of your own choices, so be it.” Ibid. As a\nresult of respondents’ actions, Pitre alleges, his already\nfragile medical condition deteriorated even further.\n   The courts below deemed these allegations insufficient\nto state an Eighth Amendment violation. The Magistrate\nJudge concluded that Pitre had been “ ‘hoist by his own\npetard,’ ” Report and Recommendation in No. 2:08–CV–\n1894 (WD La., Apr. 29, 2009), p. 9, App. C to Pet. for Cert.,\nand sua sponte recommended dismissing the complaint as\n“frivolous,” see 28 U. S. C. §1915(e)(2)(B)(i). The District\nJudge adopted this recommendation. Judgment in No.\n2                            PITRE v. CAIN\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n2:08–CV–1894 (WD La., May 27, 2009), App. C to Pet. for\nCert. The Fifth Circuit summarily affirmed, concluding,\n“Mr. Pitre has been given medical care, but he refuses to\ntake medication which results at times in physical prob\nlems. Evidence of conscious indifference is not presented.”\n354 Fed. Appx. 142, 143 (2009) (per curiam).\n   The Fifth Circuit’s error in requiring Pitre to produce\n“evidence” in support of his allegations before a responsive\npleading was filed, in and of itself, is sufficient reason to\nreverse the judgment below. See Bell Atlantic Corp. v.\nTwombly, 550 U. S. 544, 564, n. 8 (2007) (“[W]hen a com\nplaint adequately states a claim, it may not be dismissed\nbased on a district court’s assessment that the plaintiff\nwill fail to find evidentiary support for his allegations”).\nMore fundamentally, however, in focusing on Pitre’s own\ncontribution to his health problems, the courts appear to\nhave misunderstood the nature of Pitre’s Eighth Amend\nment claim. His pro se complaint and attachments\nthereto, “liberally construed,” Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S.\n97, 106 (1976), allege not that respondents denied him\nmedical care but that they punished him for refusing to\ntake medication, or attempted to coerce him to take medi\ncation, by subjecting him to hard labor that they knew\nexceeded his medical limitations.\n   “The principle that a competent person has a constitu\ntionally protected liberty interest in refusing unwanted\nmedical treatment may be inferred from our prior deci\nsions.”* Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S.\n261, 278 (1990). A prison regulation infringing an interest\n——————\n  * In the District Court, Pitre also claimed a liberty interest created by\nstate law. See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §15:860 (West 2005) (“Except as to\ncompliance with the sanitary laws and all reasonable regulations\nrelating to contagious and infectious diseases, any sane patient or sane\ninmate of the Louisiana State Penitentiary may decline any medical\ncare or treatment offered or provided by the institution and provide\nother care for himself at his own expense”).\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nin avoiding unwanted medication is valid if it is “ ‘reasona\nbly related to legitimate penological interests.’ ” Washing\nton v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210, 223 (1990) (quoting Turner v.\nSafley, 482 U. S. 78, 89 (1987)). We have thus held that\nprison officials may forcibly treat a mentally ill inmate\nwith antipsychotic drugs “if the inmate is dangerous to\nhimself or others and the treatment is in the inmate’s\nmedical interest.” Harper, 494 U. S., at 227. We have not\nconsidered, however, whether prison officials may require\ninmates with HIV to take medication, such that the re\nfusal to do so might justify the imposition of sanctions by\nsuch officials.\n   Even assuming respondents had a legitimate penologi\ncal interest that outweighed a right to refuse HIV medica\ntion, that interest would not permit respondents to punish\nPitre, or to attempt to coerce him to take medication, by\nsubjecting him to hard labor that they knew posed “a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm.” Farmer v. Brennan, 511\nU. S. 825, 837 (1994); see also Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U. S.\n730, 738 (2002). To determine whether prison officials’\nconduct violates the Eighth Amendment in the context of\nprison conditions, we ask whether “the officials involved\nacted with ‘deliberate indifference’ to the inmates’ health\nor safety.” Ibid. (quoting Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S.\n1, 8 (1992)). Pitre’s complaint alleges that respondents\nsubjected him to labor that they knew posed “a substantial\nrisk of serious harm” to his health notwithstanding his\npleas for a more appropriate assignment, Farmer, 511\nU. S., at 837, and he even attaches a letter from a prison\nofficial implying as much. This is more than sufficient to\nstate a claim of deliberate indifference. See ibid. (holding\nthat a prison official violates the Eighth Amendment if he\ndenies “an inmate humane conditions of confinement [if]\nthe official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to\ninmate health or safety”).\n   To be sure, Pitre’s decision to refuse medication may\n4                       PITRE v. CAIN\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nhave been foolish and likely caused a significant part of\nhis pain. But that decision does not give prison officials\nlicense to exacerbate Pitre’s condition further as a means\nof punishing or coercing him—just as a prisoner’s disrup\ntive conduct does not permit prison officials to punish the\nprisoner by handcuffing him to a hitching post, see Hope,\n536 U. S., at 738. Pitre’s allegations, if true, describe\n“punitive treatment [that] amounts to gratuitous infliction\nof ‘wanton and unnecessary’ pain that our precedent\nclearly prohibits.” Ibid. I cannot comprehend how a court\ncould deem such allegations “frivolous.” Because I believe\nthat Pitre’s complaint states an Eighth Amendment viola\ntion, I would grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and\nreverse the judgment below.\n</pre>", "id": 177420, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2010/10/18/Pitre_v._Cain.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                  Cite as: 562 U.
