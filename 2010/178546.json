Decided November 1, 2010\n\n\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and\nJUSTICE SCALIA join, dissenting from denial of certiorari.\n   The Court of Appeals granted habeas relief in this case\nafter concluding that a state trial judge unconstitutionally\ncoerced the jury by commenting and offering an opinion on\nthe evidence. Because that decision cannot be reconciled\nwith the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 (AEDPA), see 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1), and gives short\nshrift to a venerable common-law practice, I would grant\nthe petition for writ of certiorari.\n                             I\n  After they learned that Eugene and Deanna S. had won\nsome money at a casino, respondent Anthony Smith and\ncodefendant James Hinex drove to the couple’s Sacra\nmento home, burglarized it, and robbed both victims at\ngunpoint. During the robbery, one of the defendants put a\ngun to the head of Mrs. S. and forced her to perform oral\ncopulation. Both Smith and Hinex were arrested and\ncharged under California law with one count of residential\nburglary and two counts of residential robbery. Cal. Penal\nCode Ann. §§459 (West 2010), 211 (West 2008). Smith\nwas also charged with forcible oral copulation. §288a(c)\n(West 2008). At trial, the jury deliberated for a little over\ntwo days before convicting both defendants on the bur\nglary and robbery counts. The jury had a more difficult\n2                       WONG v.

The trial judge then gave\nthe jury a modified version of an Allen charge. See Allen\nv. United States, 164 U. S. 492 (1896). When further\ndeliberations proved fruitless, the judge decided to exer\ncise the judicial authority, as recognized by the State\nConstitution, to “comment on the evidence.” See Cal.\nConst., Art. VI, §10.\n    At the outset, the judge reminded the jurors that they\nwere the “ ‘exclusive judges of the facts.’ ” Smith v. Curry,\n580 F. 3d 1071, 1077 (CA9 2009). He explained that his\ncomments were not intended “ ‘to impose [his] will’ ” on the\njury, but only to review “certain evidence” that they “ ‘may\nnot have considered.’ ” Ibid. The judge thought it “ ‘impor\ntant’ ” for the jury to consider the statements Smith and\nHinex “ ‘made to law enforcement following their arrests,’ ”\nparticularly the “ ‘consistencies and inconsistencies’ ”\nbetween those statements. Ibid. The judge pointed out\nthat Smith told police that both he and Hinex entered the\nhouse. Smith stated that he found Mrs. S. in a back bed\nroom, that Smith was armed at the time, and that Mrs. S.\ngave Smith a $100 bill. Id., at 1077–1078. The judge\nnoted that Hinex also “ ‘said Smith went to the back of the\nhouse . . . and closed the door.’ ” Id., at 1077. But Hinex\ndenied going inside the house himself. The judge played\nthe tapes of both defendants’ statements for the jury. He\ntold them to consider and discuss the statements during\ndeliberations. Finally, the judge reiterated that his “ ‘com\nments [were] advisory only’ ” and that the jurors remained\n“ ‘the exclusive judges’ ” of the facts and the “ ‘credibility of\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

The jury continued their delib\nerations; a short time later, they returned a guilty verdict\nagainst Smith on the oral-copulation count.\n  Smith argued on appeal that the judge’s comments\ncoerced the jury’s verdict. A California intermediate\nappellate court rejected that claim. The California Su\npreme Court denied review. Smith then filed a federal\npetition for writ of habeas corpus, 28 U. S. C. §2254, which\nthe District Court granted. A split Ninth Circuit panel\naffirmed.\n                               II\n   Smith’s claim on federal habeas is that the California\nappellate court unreasonably applied this Court’s clearly\nestablished law forbidding coercive jury instructions.\n§2254(d)(1); see Brief in Opposition 12. “[C]learly estab\nlished” law under §2254(d)(1) consists of “the holdings, as\nopposed to the dicta, of this Court’s” cases. Williams v.\nTaylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412 (2000). An “unreasonable ap\nplication” of that law involves not just an erroneous or\nincorrect decision, but an objectively unreasonable one.\nRenico v. Lett, 559 U. S. ___ (2010).\n   The clearly established law relevant to this case is\nsparse. Just one of this Court’s decisions, Lowenfield v.\nPhelps, 484 U. S. 231 (1988), has addressed the constitu\ntional rule against coercive jury instructions. And Lowen\nfield held only that, on the totality of the circumstances\npresent there, no unconstitutional coercion resulted. Id.,\nat 241. The Court has also decided several cases on the\nspecific practice of judicial comment on the evidence. E.g.,\nQuercia v. United States, 289 U. S. 466 (1933). But all of\nthose cases arose under this Court’s supervisory power\nover federal courts; they set no clearly established consti\ntutional limits under AEDPA. See Early v. Packer, 537\nU. S. 3, 10 (2002) (per curiam). As a result, the clearly\nestablished law in this area provides very little specific\n4                           WONG v. SMITH\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nguidance. About all that can be said is that coercive in\nstructions are unconstitutional, coerciveness must be\njudged on the totality of the circumstances, and the facts\nof Lowenfield (polling a deadlocked jury and reading a\nslightly modified Allen charge) were not unconstitutionally\ncoercive. See 484 U. S., at 237–241.\n   A general standard such as this gives state courts wide\nlatitude for reasonable decisionmaking under AEDPA.\nYarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 664 (2004) (“The\nmore general the rule, the more leeway courts have in\nreaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations”). That\nlatitude is wider still in this case, as no constitutional\ndecision of this Court has ever explained how the general\nrule against “coercion” applies to the traditional practice of\njudicial comment on the evidence. Cf. Carey v. Musladin,\n549 U. S. 70, 76 (2006).\n   For centuries, trial judges have enjoyed authority to\ncomment on the evidence. At common law, the judge was\nempowered to “weig[h] the evidence” and share an “opin\nion” with the jury, even “in matter of fact.” 2 M. Hale,\nHistory of the Common Law of England 147 (5th ed. 1794)\n(hereinafter Hale).* The practice is well established in\nthis Court’s cases as well. The Court has recognized that\na trial judge has “discretion” to “comment upon the evi\ndence,” to call the jury’s “attention to parts of it which he\nthinks important,” and to “express his opinion upon the\nfacts.” Vicksburg & Meridian R. Co. v. Putnam, 118 U. S.\n545, 553 (1886); Quercia, supra, at 469.\n——————\n   * See J. Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at Common Law\n188, n. 2 (1898) (trial by jury “in a form which would withhold from the\njury the assistance of the court in dealing with the facts” is not “trial by\njury in any historic sense of the word”); 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence §2551,\np. 664 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1981) (hereinafter Wigmore) (comment on the\nevidence “existed at common law since the beginning of jury trial, and\nmust be regarded historically as an essential and inseparable part of\njury trial”).\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n  To be sure, the practice has for many years been on the\nwane. Comment on the evidence has always been more\npopular in Britain than it ever was in this country. See 9\nWigmore §2551, at 666. That said, federal courts and\nseveral States continue to recognize judicial authority to\ncomment on the evidence, and California expressly pro\ntects the practice in its State Constitution. Cal. Const.,\nArt. VI, §10.\n  This long tradition, combined with the complete absence\nof constitutional precedent on how to apply Lowenfield’s\nanticoercion principle in this context, shows that federal\ncourts should tread lightly when faced with a claim that\njudicial comment on the evidence runs afoul of clearly\nestablished federal law. Outside of extreme cases, most\ndecisions approving traditional uses of this common-law\npractice should fall within the bounds of reasonable deci\nsionmaking under AEDPA.\n                            III\n  Here, the California appellate court did not unreasona\nbly apply this Court’s clearly established law. The trial\njudge, before commenting on the evidence, made clear that\nthe jurors remained the exclusive judges of the facts and\nthat the judge’s comments were advisory only. 580 F. 3d,\nat 1077. The judge then directed the jurors to particular\nevidence—the defendants’ initial statements to police—\nand highlighted for them certain “ ‘consistencies and in\nconsistencies’ ” between those statements. Ibid. This\npractice of drawing the jury’s “attention to parts” of the\nevidence that the judge thinks “ ‘important’ ” lies at the\nrecognized core of the common-law power to comment on\nthe evidence. See Vicksburg, supra, at 553; Hale 147 (The\njudge “is able, . . . in matters of fact, to give [the jury]\ngreat light and assistance, by . . . observing where the\nquestion and knot of the business lies; and by showing\nthem his opinion even in matter of fact” (some capitaliza\n6                     WONG v. SMITH\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ntion omitted)). Neither the trial judge’s decision to employ\nthe practice here nor the state appellate court’s approval\nof the instruction ran afoul of clearly established federal\nlaw.\n   The Ninth Circuit’s contrary decision rested in large\nmeasure on its concern that the comments “pointed the\njury to evidence leading to a particular verdict,” while\nomitting to mention other evidence favorable to Smith.\n580 F. 3d, at 1081, 1083. But the common-law privilege to\ncomment on the evidence has never required a compendi\nous summary. Rather, the judge has traditionally enjoyed\nthe power to focus on the particular evidence the judge\nthinks important, and to share with the jury an opinion on\nthat evidence. Vicksburg, supra, at 553; Quercia, 289\nU. S., at 469. It was not unreasonable under this Court’s\nclearly established law for the California appellate court to\napprove that practice here.\n   The Ninth Circuit’s opinion also suggests that, when a\njury is “deadlocked,” the judge may provide only “appro\npriate encouragement . . . to deliberate,” and must refrain\nfrom providing the “judge’s selective view of the evidence.”\n580 F. 3d, at 1080. None of this Court’s constitutional\ncases establish such a rule. And this Court’s supervisory\npower cases (which, if anything, set a more demanding\nstandard than the constitutional minimum) have specifi\ncally upheld judicial comments that provide a particular\n“view of the evidence” to an apparently deadlocked jury.\nSee Simmons v. United States, 142 U. S. 148, 155 (1891)\n(no error where judge denied deadlocked jury’s request to\nbe discharged and told them “that he regarded the testi\nmony as convincing”). Nothing in this Court’s clearly\nestablished law prohibits the trial judge from offering an\nopinion to a jury that is struggling to reach a verdict.\n   The Ninth Circuit was also troubled that the trial\njudge’s comments appeared to be designed to address the\nconcerns of the holdout juror. 580 F. 3d, at 1082.

Id., at 1082–1083.\nWhatever potential for coercion these comments caused,\nthe California appellate court’s decision upholding them\n“was clearly not unreasonable” under the general Lowen\nfield standard.

It was not unreasonable under this Court’s\nclearly established law for the California appellate court to\napprove that practice here.\n   The Ninth Circuit’s opinion also suggests that, when a\njury is “deadlocked,” the judge may provide only “appro\npriate encouragement . . . to deliberate,” and must refrain\nfrom providing the “judge’s selective view of the evidence.”\n580 F. 3d, at 1080. None of this Court’s constitutional\ncases establish such a rule. And this Court’s supervisory\npower cases (which, if anything, set a more demanding\nstandard than the constitutional minimum) have specifi\ncally upheld judicial comments that provide a particular\n“view of the evidence” to an apparently deadlocked jury.\nSee Simmons v. United States, 142 U. S. 148, 155 (1891)\n(no error where judge denied deadlocked jury’s request to\nbe discharged and told them “that he regarded the testi\nmony as convincing”). Nothing in this Court’s clearly\nestablished law prohibits the trial judge from offering an\nopinion to a jury that is struggling to reach a verdict.\n   The Ninth Circuit was also troubled that the trial\njudge’s comments appeared to be designed to address the\nconcerns of the holdout juror. 580 F. 3d, at 1082. And the\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\npanel majority disapproved of the trial judge’s “mandatory\nlanguage” directing the jury to “ ‘consider and discuss’ ” the\nevidence highlighted by the court. Id., at 1082–1083.\nWhatever potential for coercion these comments caused,\nthe California appellate court’s decision upholding them\n“was clearly not unreasonable” under the general Lowen\nfield standard. See Renico, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n12). I would grant certiorari in this case and correct the\nNinth Circuit’s error.\n", "precedential_status": "Relating-to", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/178546/", "sha1": "420a19d4b271d75d2bf511d1f587e4a8123e97ae", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-11-01T17:06:35"}
