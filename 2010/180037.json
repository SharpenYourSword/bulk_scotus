Argued October 5, 2010—Decided November 30, 2010\nThe Humphries (hereinafter respondents) were accused of child abuse\n  in California, but were later exonerated. However, under California\n  law, their names were added to a Child Abuse Central Index (Index),\n  where they would remain available to various state agencies for at\n  least 10 years. The statute has no procedures for allowing individu\n  als to challenge their inclusion in the Index, and neither California\n  nor Los Angeles County has created such procedures. Respondents\n  filed suit under §1983, seeking damages, an injunction, and a decla\n  ration that public officials and petitioner Los Angeles County had de\n  prived them of their constitutional rights by failing to create a\n  mechanism through which they could contest inclusion in the Index.\n  The District Court granted the defendants summary judgment, but\n  the Ninth Circuit disagreed, holding that the Fourteenth Amendment\n  required the State to provide those on the list with notice and a hear\n  ing, and thus respondents were entitled to declaratory relief. The\n  court also held that respondents were prevailing parties entitled to\n  attorney’s fees, including $60,000 from the county. The county ob\n  jected, claiming that as a municipal entity, it was liable only if its\n  “policy or custom” caused the deprivation of a plaintiff’s federal right,\n  Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 694;\n  but a state policy caused any deprivation here. The Ninth Circuit, in\n  ter alia, found that respondents did prevail against the county on\n  their claim for declaratory relief because Monell did not apply to pro\n  spective relief claims.\nHeld: Monell’s “policy or custom” requirement applies in §1983 cases\n irrespective of whether the relief sought is monetary or prospective.\n Pp. 4–10.\n2               LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n       (a) In Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, this Court based its holding\n    that municipal entities were not “person[s]” under §1983 on the pro\n    vision’s legislative history, particularly Congress’ rejection of the so\n    called Sherman amendment, which would have made municipalities\n    liable for damages done by private persons “ ‘riotously and tumultu\n    ously assembled,’ ” id., at 188–190, and n. 38. Reexamining this leg\n    islative history in Monell, the Court overruled Monroe. It concluded\n    that Congress had rejected the Sherman amendment, not because it\n    would have imposed liability on municipalities, but because it would\n    have imposed such liability solely based on the acts of others. The\n    Court, on the basis of the statutory text and the legislative history,\n    went on to explain what acts are the municipality’s own for purposes\n    of liability. The Court held that “a municipality cannot be held li\n    able” solely for the acts of others, e.g., “solely because it employs a\n    tortfeasor,” 436 U. S., at 691, but it may be held liable “when execu\n    tion of a government’s policy or custom . . . inflicts the injury,” id., at\n    694. Pp. 4–7.\n       (b) Section 1983, read in light of Monell’s understanding of the leg\n    islative history, explains why claims for prospective relief, like claims\n    for money damages, fall within the scope of the “policy or custom” re\n    quirement. Nothing in §1983 suggests that the causation require\n    ment should change with the form of relief sought. In fact, the text\n    suggests the opposite when it provides that a person who meets\n    §1983’s elements “shall be liable . . . in an action at law, suit in eq\n    uity, or other proper proceeding for redress.” Thus, as Monell explic\n    itly stated, “local governing bodies . . . can be sued directly under\n    §1983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief where, as here,\n    the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or exe\n    cutes” a policy or custom. 436 U. S., at 690. To find the “policy or\n    custom” requirement inapplicable in prospective relief cases would\n    also undermine Monell’s logic. For whether an action or omission is a\n    municipality’s “own” has to do with the nature of the action or omis\n    sion, not with the nature of the relief that is later sought in court.\n    Pp. 7–8.\n       (c) Respondents’ arguments to the contrary are unconvincing.\n    Pp. 8–9.\nReversed and remanded.\n\n   BREYER, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other\nMembers joined, except KAGAN, J., who took no part in the considera\ntion or decision of the case.\n                        Cite as: 562 U.

CRAIG ARTHUR HUMPHRIES ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                             [November 30, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  In Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436\nU. S. 658 (1978), this Court held that civil rights plaintiffs\nsuing a municipal entity under 42 U. S. C. §1983 must\nshow that their injury was caused by a municipal policy or\ncustom. The case before the Court in Monell directly\ninvolved monetary damages. The question presented is\nwhether the “policy or custom” requirement also applies\nwhen plaintiffs seek prospective relief, such as an injunc\ntion or a declaratory judgment. We conclude that it does\nso apply.\n                            I\n  The case arises out of the following circumstances: The\nCalifornia Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act, Cal.\nPenal Code Ann. §11164 et seq. (West Rev. Supp. 2010),\nrequires law enforcement and other state agencies to\ninvestigate allegations of child abuse. These agencies\nmust report to the California Department of Justice all\ninstances of reported child abuse the agency finds “not\nunfounded,” even if they are “inconclusive or unsubstanti\nated.” §§11169(a), 11170(a)(3). The statute requires the\n2           LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndepartment to include all these reports in a Child Abuse\nCentral Index (Index), where they remain available to\nvarious state agencies for at least 10 years. §11170(a).\nThe statute also says that if\n    “a report has previously been filed which subse\n    quently proves to be unfounded, the Department of\n    Justice shall be notified in writing of that fact and\n    shall not retain the report.” §11169(a).\nThe statute, however, does not set forth procedures for\nreviewing whether a previously filed report is unfounded,\nor for allowing individuals to challenge their inclusion in\nthe Index. Nor, up until the time of this lawsuit, had\nCalifornia or Los Angeles County created any such proce\ndures. But cf. §11170(a)(2) (“The submitting agencies are\nresponsible for the accuracy, completeness, and retention\nof the reports described in this section”).\n   The two plaintiffs in this case were initially accused of\nchild abuse. But they were later exonerated. They sought\nto have their names removed from the Index. Unable to\nconvince the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department to remove\nthem, they filed this §1983 case against the attorney\ngeneral of California, the Los Angeles County sheriff, two\ndetectives in the sheriff’s department, and the County of\nLos Angeles. They sought damages, an injunction, and a\ndeclaration that the defendants had deprived them of their\nconstitutional rights by failing to create a procedural\nmechanism through which one could contest inclusion on\nthe Index. See U. S. Const., Amdt. 14; Rev. Stat. §1979,\n42 U. S. C. §1983. The District Court for the Central\nDistrict of California granted summary judgment to all of\nthe defendants on the ground that California had not\ndeprived plaintiffs of a constitutionally protected “liberty”\ninterest. But on appeal the Ninth Circuit disagreed.\n   The Ninth Circuit held that the Fourteenth Amendment\nrequired the State to provide those included on the list\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnotice and “ ‘some kind of hearing.’ ” 554 F. 3d 1170, 1201\n(2009). Thus the Circuit held that the plaintiffs were\nentitled to declaratory relief, and it believed that (on\nremand) they might prove damages as well. Ibid.\n   The Ninth Circuit also held that the plaintiffs were\nprevailing parties, thereby entitled to approximately\n$600,000 in attorney’s fees. 42 U. S. C. §1988(b) (provid\ning for payment of attorney’s fees to parties prevailing on\n§1983 claims). See No. 05–56467 (June 22, 2009), App. to\nPet. for Cert. 1–4 (hereinafter First Fee Order); No. 05–\n56467 (Dec. 2, 2009), App. to Reply to Brief in Opposition\n1–2 (hereinafter Second Fee Order). The Ninth Circuit\nwrote that Los Angeles County must pay approximately\n$60,000 of this amount. First Fee Order 3; Second Fee\nOrder 2.\n   Los Angeles County denied that it was liable and there\nfore that it could be held responsible for attorney’s fees. It\nargued that, in respect to the county, the plaintiffs were\nnot prevailing parties. That is because the county is a\nmunicipal entity. Under Monell’s holding a municipal\nentity is liable under §1983 only if a municipal “policy or\ncustom” caused a plaintiff to be deprived of a federal right.\n436 U. S., at 694 (emphasis added). And it was state\npolicy, not county policy, that brought about any depriva\ntion here.\n   The Ninth Circuit responded to this argument as fol\nlows: First, it said that county policy might be responsible\nfor the deprivation. It “is possible,” the Ninth Circuit said,\nthat the county, “[b]y failing to” “creat[e] an independent\nprocedure that would allow” the plaintiffs “to challenge\ntheir listing[,] . . . adopted a custom and policy that vio\nlated” the plaintiffs’ “constitutional rights.” 554 F. 3d, at\n1202. Second, it said that “because this issue is not clear\nbased on the record before us on appeal . . . we remand to\nthe district court to determine the County’s liability under\nMonell.” Ibid. Third, it saw no reason to remand in re\n4            LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nspect to the county’s obligation to pay $60,000 in attor\nney’s fees. That, it wrote, is because “in our circuit . . . the\nlimitations to liability established in Monell do not apply\nto claims for prospective relief,” such as the declaratory\njudgment that the Circuit had ordered entered. First Fee\nOrder 3–4 (citing Chaloux v. Killeen, 886 F. 2d 247, 250\n(CA9 1989); Truth v. Kent School Dist., 542 F. 3d 634, 644\n(CA9 2008); emphasis added).\n   The county then asked us to review this last-mentioned\nNinth Circuit holding, namely, the holding that Monell’s\n“policy or custom” requirement applies only to claims for\ndamages but not to claims for prospective relief. Because\nthe Courts of Appeals are divided on this question, we\ngranted the county’s petition for certiorari. Compare\nReynolds v. Giuliani, 506 F. 3d 183, 191 (CA2 2007) (hold\ning that Monell’s “policy or custom” requirement applies to\nclaims for prospective relief as well as claims for dam\nages); Dirrane v. Brookline Police Dept., 315 F. 3d 65, 71\n(CA1 2002) (same); Greensboro Professional Fire Fighters\nAssn., Local 3157 v. Greensboro, 64 F. 3d 962, 967, n. 6\n(CA4 1995) (applying the Monell requirement to a prospec\ntive relief claim); Church v. Huntsville, 30 F. 3d 1332,\n1347 (CA11 1994) (same), with Chaloux, supra, at 251\n(holding that Monell does not apply to prospective relief\nclaims). See also Gernetzke v. Kenosha Unified School\nDist. No. 1, 274 F. 3d 464, 468 (CA7 2001) (reserving the\nquestion but noting the “predominant” view that “Monell’s\nholding applies regardless of the nature of the relief\nsought”).\n   We conclude that Monell’s holding applies to §1983\nclaims against municipalities for prospective relief as well\nas to claims for damages.\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n    We begin with §1983 itself, which provides: \n\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n      “Every person who, under color of any [state] stat\n    ute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage . . . sub\n    jects, or causes to be subjected, any . . . other per\n    son . . . to the deprivation of any rights . . . secured by\n    the Constitution and laws [of the United States], shall\n    be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit\n    in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.”\n    (Emphasis added.)\nIn 1961, in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, this Court held\nthat municipal entities were not “person[s]” under §1983.\nThe Court based this conclusion on the history of the Civil\nRights Act of 1871’s enactment. It noted that Congress\nrejected an amendment (called the Sherman amendment)\nthat would have made municipalities liable for damage\ndone by private persons “ ‘riotously and tumultuously\nassembled.’ ” Id., at 188–190, and n. 38 (quoting Cong.\nGlobe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 663 (1871)). This rejection,\nthe Court thought, reflected a determination by the 1871\nHouse of Representatives that “ ‘Congress had no constitu\ntional power to impose any obligation upon county and\ntown organizations, the mere instrumentality for the\nadministration of state law.’ ” 365 U. S., at 190 (quoting\nCong. Globe, supra, at 804 (statement of Rep. Poland);\nemphasis added). The Court concluded that Congress\nmust have doubted its “constitutional power . . . to impose\ncivil liability on municipalities.” 365 U. S., at 190. And\nfor that reason, Congress must have intended to exclude\nmunicipal corporations as §1983 defendants. The statute’s\nkey term “person” therefore did not cover municipal enti\nties. Id., at 191.\n  Sixteen years later, in Monell, the Court reconsidered\nthe question of municipal liability. After reexamining the\n1871 legislative history in detail, the Court concluded that\nCongress had rejected the Sherman amendment, not\nbecause it would have imposed liability upon municipali\n6           LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nties, but because it would have imposed liability upon\nmunicipalities based purely upon the acts of others. That\nis to say, the rejected amendment would have imposed\nliability upon local governments “without regard to\nwhether a local government was in any way at fault for\nthe breach of the peace for which it was to be held for\ndamages.” 436 U. S., at 681, n. 40 (emphasis added). In\nMonell’s view Congress may have thought that it lacked\nthe power to impose that kind of indirect liability upon\nmunicipalities, id., at 679, but “nothing said in debate on\nthe Sherman amendment would have prevented holding a\nmunicipality liable . . . for its own violations of the Four\nteenth Amendment,” id., at 683 (emphasis added). The\nCourt, overruling Monroe, held that municipalities were\n“persons” under §1983. 436 U. S., at 690.\n  The Court also concluded that a municipality could not\nbe held liable under §1983 solely because it employed a\ntortfeasor. The Court’s conclusion rested on “the language\nof §1983, read against the background of the same legisla\ntive history.” Id., at 691. Section 1983’s causation lan\nguage imposes liability on a “ ‘person who . . . shall subject,\nor cause to be subjected, any person’ ” to a deprivation of\nfederal rights. Ibid. (quoting 17 Stat. 13; emphasis de\nleted). That language, the Court observed, could not “be\neasily read to impose liability vicariously . . . solely on the\nbasis of the existence of an employer-employee relation\nship with a tortfeasor.” 436 U. S., at 692. The statute’s\nlegislative history, in particular the constitutional objec\ntions that had been raised to the Sherman amendment,\nsupported this conclusion. Id., at 692–94, and n. 57.\n   For these reasons, the Court concluded that a munici\npality could be held liable under §1983 only for its own\nviolations of federal law. Id., at 694. The Court described\nwhat made a violation a municipality’s own violation:\n    “Local governing bodies, therefore, can be sued di\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    rectly under §1983 for monetary, declaratory, or in\n    junctive relief where, as here, the action that is al\n    leged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a\n    policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision of\n    ficially adopted and promulgated by that body’s offi\n    cers. . . . [They can also be sued for] deprivations vis\n    ited pursuant to governmental ‘custom’ even though\n    such a custom has not received formal approval\n    through the body’s official decisionmaking channels.”\n    Id., at 690–691 (footnote omitted).\nThe Court has also included the terms “usage” and “prac\ntice” as customs for which liability is appropriate. See\nibid. The length of this list of types of municipal action\nleads us here to use a shorthand term “policy or custom,”\nbut when we do so, we mean to refer to the entire list. See\nid., at 694 (using the shorthand “policy or custom”); see\nalso, e.g., Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Comm., 555\nU. S. 246, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 10) (using the phrase\n“custom, policy, or practice,” to describe municipal liability\nunder §1983).\n   In sum, in Monell the Court held that “a municipality\ncannot be held liable” solely for the acts of others, e.g.,\n“solely because it employs a tortfeasor.” 436 U. S., at 691.\nBut the municipality may be held liable “when execution\nof a government’s policy or custom . . . inflicts the injury.”\nId., at 694 (emphasis added).\n                             B\n  The language of §1983 read in light of Monell’s under\nstanding of the legislative history explains why claims for\nprospective relief, like claims for money damages, fall\nwithin the scope of the “policy or custom” requirement.\nNothing in the text of §1983 suggests that the causation\nrequirement contained in the statute should change with\nthe form of relief sought. In fact, the text suggests the\nopposite when it provides that a person who meets §1983’s\n8           LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nelements “shall be liable . . . in an action at law, suit in\nequity, or other proper proceeding for redress.” Thus, as\nMonell explicitly stated, “[l]ocal governing bodies . . . can\nbe sued directly under §1983 for monetary, declaratory, or\ninjunctive relief where, as here, the action that is alleged\nto be unconstitutional implements or executes” a policy or\ncustom. 436 U. S., at 690 (emphasis added). Monell went\non to quote this Court’s statement in a 1973 case, Kenosha\nv. Bruno, 412 U. S. 507, 513, to the effect that the Con\ngress that enacted §1983 did not intend the “ ‘generic word\n“person” . . . to have a bifurcated application to municipal\ncorporations depending on the nature of the relief sought\nagainst them.’ ” 436 U. S., at 701, n. 66 (emphasis added).\nMonell added that “[n]othing we say today affects” this\npre-Monell “conclusion.” Ibid.\n   Monell’s logic also argues against any such relief-based\nbifurcation. The Monell Court thought that Congress\nintended potential §1983 liability where a municipality’s\nown violations were at issue but not where only the viola\ntions of others were at issue. The “policy or custom” re\nquirement rests upon that distinction and embodies it in\nlaw. To find the requirement inapplicable where prospec\ntive relief is at issue would undermine Monell’s logic. For\nwhether an action or omission is a municipality’s “own”\nhas to do with the nature of the action or omission, not\nwith the nature of the relief that is later sought in court.\n                               C\n  The Humphries’ (hereinafter respondents) arguments to\nthe contrary are unconvincing. Respondents correctly note\nthat by the time Monell reached the Supreme Court only\nthe plaintiffs’ damages claim remained live. See id., at\n661. From this fact they conclude that the Court’s holding\napplies directly only to claims for monetary damages. A\nholding, however, can extend through its logic beyond the\nspecific facts of the particular case. It does so here.\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Respondents add that not only did Monell involve a\ndamages claim, but its holding rests upon the concern that\nmunicipalities might have to pay large damages awards.\nThe Court so suggests when it points out that municipali\nties should not be liable for an employee’s wrongful acts,\nsimply by applying agency-based principles of respondeat\nsuperior. But as we have pointed out, the Court’s rejection\nof respondeat superior liability primarily rested not on the\nmunicipality’s economic needs, but on the fact that liabil\nity in such a case does not arise out of the municipality’s\nown wrongful conduct.\n   Respondents further claim that, where prospective relief\nis at issue, Monell is redundant. They say that a court\ncannot grant prospective relief against a municipality\nunless the municipality’s own conduct has caused the\nviolation. Hence, where such relief is otherwise proper,\nthe Monell requirement “shouldn’t screen out any case.”\nTr. of Oral Arg. 48.\n   To argue that a requirement is necessarily satisfied,\nhowever, is not to argue that its satisfaction is unneces\nsary. If respondents are right, our holding may have\nlimited practical significance.

Argued October 5, 2010—Decided November 30, 2010\nThe Humphries (hereinafter respondents) were accused of child abuse\n  in California, but were later exonerated. However, under California\n  law, their names were added to a Child Abuse Central Index (Index),\n  where they would remain available to various state agencies for at\n  least 10 years. The statute has no procedures for allowing individu\n  als to challenge their inclusion in the Index, and neither California\n  nor Los Angeles County has created such procedures. Respondents\n  filed suit under §1983, seeking damages, an injunction, and a decla\n  ration that public officials and petitioner Los Angeles County had de\n  prived them of their constitutional rights by failing to create a\n  mechanism through which they could contest inclusion in the Index.\n  The District Court granted the defendants summary judgment, but\n  the Ninth Circuit disagreed, holding that the Fourteenth Amendment\n  required the State to provide those on the list with notice and a hear\n  ing, and thus respondents were entitled to declaratory relief. The\n  court also held that respondents were prevailing parties entitled to\n  attorney’s fees, including $60,000 from the county. The county ob\n  jected, claiming that as a municipal entity, it was liable only if its\n  “policy or custom” caused the deprivation of a plaintiff’s federal right,\n  Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 694;\n  but a state policy caused any deprivation here. The Ninth Circuit, in\n  ter alia, found that respondents did prevail against the county on\n  their claim for declaratory relief because Monell did not apply to pro\n  spective relief claims.\nHeld: Monell’s “policy or custom” requirement applies in §1983 cases\n irrespective of whether the relief sought is monetary or prospective.\n Pp. 4–10.\n2               LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n       (a) In Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, this Court based its holding\n    that municipal entities were not “person[s]” under §1983 on the pro\n    vision’s legislative history, particularly Congress’ rejection of the so\n    called Sherman amendment, which would have made municipalities\n    liable for damages done by private persons “ ‘riotously and tumultu\n    ously assembled,’ ” id., at 188–190, and n. 38. Reexamining this leg\n    islative history in Monell, the Court overruled Monroe. It concluded\n    that Congress had rejected the Sherman amendment, not because it\n    would have imposed liability on municipalities, but because it would\n    have imposed such liability solely based on the acts of others. The\n    Court, on the basis of the statutory text and the legislative history,\n    went on to explain what acts are the municipality’s own for purposes\n    of liability. The Court held that “a municipality cannot be held li\n    able” solely for the acts of others, e.g., “solely because it employs a\n    tortfeasor,” 436 U. S., at 691, but it may be held liable “when execu\n    tion of a government’s policy or custom . . . inflicts the injury,” id., at\n    694. Pp. 4–7.\n       (b) Section 1983, read in light of Monell’s understanding of the leg\n    islative history, explains why claims for prospective relief, like claims\n    for money damages, fall within the scope of the “policy or custom” re\n    quirement. Nothing in §1983 suggests that the causation require\n    ment should change with the form of relief sought. In fact, the text\n    suggests the opposite when it provides that a person who meets\n    §1983’s elements “shall be liable . . . in an action at law, suit in eq\n    uity, or other proper proceeding for redress.” Thus, as Monell explic\n    itly stated, “local governing bodies . . . can be sued directly under\n    §1983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief where, as here,\n    the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or exe\n    cutes” a policy or custom. 436 U. S., at 690. To find the “policy or\n    custom” requirement inapplicable in prospective relief cases would\n    also undermine Monell’s logic. For whether an action or omission is a\n    municipality’s “own” has to do with the nature of the action or omis\n    sion, not with the nature of the relief that is later sought in court.\n    Pp. 7–8.\n       (c) Respondents’ arguments to the contrary are unconvincing.\n    Pp. 8–9.\nReversed and remanded.\n\n   BREYER, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other\nMembers joined, except KAGAN, J., who took no part in the considera\ntion or decision of the case.\n                        Cite as: 562 U.

CRAIG ARTHUR HUMPHRIES ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                             [November 30, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  In Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436\nU. S. 658 (1978), this Court held that civil rights plaintiffs\nsuing a municipal entity under 42 U. S. C. §1983 must\nshow that their injury was caused by a municipal policy or\ncustom. The case before the Court in Monell directly\ninvolved monetary damages. The question presented is\nwhether the “policy or custom” requirement also applies\nwhen plaintiffs seek prospective relief, such as an injunc\ntion or a declaratory judgment. We conclude that it does\nso apply.\n                            I\n  The case arises out of the following circumstances: The\nCalifornia Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act, Cal.\nPenal Code Ann. §11164 et seq. (West Rev. Supp. 2010),\nrequires law enforcement and other state agencies to\ninvestigate allegations of child abuse. These agencies\nmust report to the California Department of Justice all\ninstances of reported child abuse the agency finds “not\nunfounded,” even if they are “inconclusive or unsubstanti\nated.” §§11169(a), 11170(a)(3). The statute requires the\n2           LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndepartment to include all these reports in a Child Abuse\nCentral Index (Index), where they remain available to\nvarious state agencies for at least 10 years. §11170(a).\nThe statute also says that if\n    “a report has previously been filed which subse\n    quently proves to be unfounded, the Department of\n    Justice shall be notified in writing of that fact and\n    shall not retain the report.” §11169(a).\nThe statute, however, does not set forth procedures for\nreviewing whether a previously filed report is unfounded,\nor for allowing individuals to challenge their inclusion in\nthe Index. Nor, up until the time of this lawsuit, had\nCalifornia or Los Angeles County created any such proce\ndures. But cf. §11170(a)(2) (“The submitting agencies are\nresponsible for the accuracy, completeness, and retention\nof the reports described in this section”).\n   The two plaintiffs in this case were initially accused of\nchild abuse. But they were later exonerated. They sought\nto have their names removed from the Index. Unable to\nconvince the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department to remove\nthem, they filed this §1983 case against the attorney\ngeneral of California, the Los Angeles County sheriff, two\ndetectives in the sheriff’s department, and the County of\nLos Angeles. They sought damages, an injunction, and a\ndeclaration that the defendants had deprived them of their\nconstitutional rights by failing to create a procedural\nmechanism through which one could contest inclusion on\nthe Index. See U. S. Const., Amdt. 14; Rev. Stat. §1979,\n42 U. S. C. §1983. The District Court for the Central\nDistrict of California granted summary judgment to all of\nthe defendants on the ground that California had not\ndeprived plaintiffs of a constitutionally protected “liberty”\ninterest. But on appeal the Ninth Circuit disagreed.\n   The Ninth Circuit held that the Fourteenth Amendment\nrequired the State to provide those included on the list\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnotice and “ ‘some kind of hearing.’ ” 554 F. 3d 1170, 1201\n(2009). Thus the Circuit held that the plaintiffs were\nentitled to declaratory relief, and it believed that (on\nremand) they might prove damages as well. Ibid.\n   The Ninth Circuit also held that the plaintiffs were\nprevailing parties, thereby entitled to approximately\n$600,000 in attorney’s fees. 42 U. S. C. §1988(b) (provid\ning for payment of attorney’s fees to parties prevailing on\n§1983 claims). See No. 05–56467 (June 22, 2009), App. to\nPet. for Cert. 1–4 (hereinafter First Fee Order); No. 05–\n56467 (Dec. 2, 2009), App. to Reply to Brief in Opposition\n1–2 (hereinafter Second Fee Order). The Ninth Circuit\nwrote that Los Angeles County must pay approximately\n$60,000 of this amount. First Fee Order 3; Second Fee\nOrder 2.\n   Los Angeles County denied that it was liable and there\nfore that it could be held responsible for attorney’s fees. It\nargued that, in respect to the county, the plaintiffs were\nnot prevailing parties. That is because the county is a\nmunicipal entity. Under Monell’s holding a municipal\nentity is liable under §1983 only if a municipal “policy or\ncustom” caused a plaintiff to be deprived of a federal right.\n436 U. S., at 694 (emphasis added). And it was state\npolicy, not county policy, that brought about any depriva\ntion here.\n   The Ninth Circuit responded to this argument as fol\nlows: First, it said that county policy might be responsible\nfor the deprivation. It “is possible,” the Ninth Circuit said,\nthat the county, “[b]y failing to” “creat[e] an independent\nprocedure that would allow” the plaintiffs “to challenge\ntheir listing[,] . . . adopted a custom and policy that vio\nlated” the plaintiffs’ “constitutional rights.” 554 F. 3d, at\n1202. Second, it said that “because this issue is not clear\nbased on the record before us on appeal . . . we remand to\nthe district court to determine the County’s liability under\nMonell.” Ibid. Third, it saw no reason to remand in re\n4            LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nspect to the county’s obligation to pay $60,000 in attor\nney’s fees. That, it wrote, is because “in our circuit . . . the\nlimitations to liability established in Monell do not apply\nto claims for prospective relief,” such as the declaratory\njudgment that the Circuit had ordered entered. First Fee\nOrder 3–4 (citing Chaloux v. Killeen, 886 F. 2d 247, 250\n(CA9 1989); Truth v. Kent School Dist., 542 F. 3d 634, 644\n(CA9 2008); emphasis added).\n   The county then asked us to review this last-mentioned\nNinth Circuit holding, namely, the holding that Monell’s\n“policy or custom” requirement applies only to claims for\ndamages but not to claims for prospective relief. Because\nthe Courts of Appeals are divided on this question, we\ngranted the county’s petition for certiorari. Compare\nReynolds v. Giuliani, 506 F. 3d 183, 191 (CA2 2007) (hold\ning that Monell’s “policy or custom” requirement applies to\nclaims for prospective relief as well as claims for dam\nages); Dirrane v. Brookline Police Dept., 315 F. 3d 65, 71\n(CA1 2002) (same); Greensboro Professional Fire Fighters\nAssn., Local 3157 v. Greensboro, 64 F. 3d 962, 967, n. 6\n(CA4 1995) (applying the Monell requirement to a prospec\ntive relief claim); Church v. Huntsville, 30 F. 3d 1332,\n1347 (CA11 1994) (same), with Chaloux, supra, at 251\n(holding that Monell does not apply to prospective relief\nclaims). See also Gernetzke v. Kenosha Unified School\nDist. No. 1, 274 F. 3d 464, 468 (CA7 2001) (reserving the\nquestion but noting the “predominant” view that “Monell’s\nholding applies regardless of the nature of the relief\nsought”).\n   We conclude that Monell’s holding applies to §1983\nclaims against municipalities for prospective relief as well\nas to claims for damages.\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n    We begin with §1983 itself, which provides: \n\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n      “Every person who, under color of any [state] stat\n    ute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage . . . sub\n    jects, or causes to be subjected, any . . . other per\n    son . . . to the deprivation of any rights . . . secured by\n    the Constitution and laws [of the United States], shall\n    be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit\n    in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.”\n    (Emphasis added.)\nIn 1961, in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, this Court held\nthat municipal entities were not “person[s]” under §1983.\nThe Court based this conclusion on the history of the Civil\nRights Act of 1871’s enactment. It noted that Congress\nrejected an amendment (called the Sherman amendment)\nthat would have made municipalities liable for damage\ndone by private persons “ ‘riotously and tumultuously\nassembled.’ ” Id., at 188–190, and n. 38 (quoting Cong.\nGlobe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 663 (1871)). This rejection,\nthe Court thought, reflected a determination by the 1871\nHouse of Representatives that “ ‘Congress had no constitu\ntional power to impose any obligation upon county and\ntown organizations, the mere instrumentality for the\nadministration of state law.’ ” 365 U. S., at 190 (quoting\nCong. Globe, supra, at 804 (statement of Rep. Poland);\nemphasis added). The Court concluded that Congress\nmust have doubted its “constitutional power . . . to impose\ncivil liability on municipalities.” 365 U. S., at 190. And\nfor that reason, Congress must have intended to exclude\nmunicipal corporations as §1983 defendants. The statute’s\nkey term “person” therefore did not cover municipal enti\nties. Id., at 191.\n  Sixteen years later, in Monell, the Court reconsidered\nthe question of municipal liability. After reexamining the\n1871 legislative history in detail, the Court concluded that\nCongress had rejected the Sherman amendment, not\nbecause it would have imposed liability upon municipali\n6           LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nties, but because it would have imposed liability upon\nmunicipalities based purely upon the acts of others. That\nis to say, the rejected amendment would have imposed\nliability upon local governments “without regard to\nwhether a local government was in any way at fault for\nthe breach of the peace for which it was to be held for\ndamages.” 436 U. S., at 681, n. 40 (emphasis added). In\nMonell’s view Congress may have thought that it lacked\nthe power to impose that kind of indirect liability upon\nmunicipalities, id., at 679, but “nothing said in debate on\nthe Sherman amendment would have prevented holding a\nmunicipality liable . . . for its own violations of the Four\nteenth Amendment,” id., at 683 (emphasis added). The\nCourt, overruling Monroe, held that municipalities were\n“persons” under §1983. 436 U. S., at 690.\n  The Court also concluded that a municipality could not\nbe held liable under §1983 solely because it employed a\ntortfeasor. The Court’s conclusion rested on “the language\nof §1983, read against the background of the same legisla\ntive history.” Id., at 691. Section 1983’s causation lan\nguage imposes liability on a “ ‘person who . . . shall subject,\nor cause to be subjected, any person’ ” to a deprivation of\nfederal rights. Ibid. (quoting 17 Stat. 13; emphasis de\nleted). That language, the Court observed, could not “be\neasily read to impose liability vicariously . . . solely on the\nbasis of the existence of an employer-employee relation\nship with a tortfeasor.” 436 U. S., at 692. The statute’s\nlegislative history, in particular the constitutional objec\ntions that had been raised to the Sherman amendment,\nsupported this conclusion. Id., at 692–94, and n. 57.\n   For these reasons, the Court concluded that a munici\npality could be held liable under §1983 only for its own\nviolations of federal law. Id., at 694. The Court described\nwhat made a violation a municipality’s own violation:\n    “Local governing bodies, therefore, can be sued di\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    rectly under §1983 for monetary, declaratory, or in\n    junctive relief where, as here, the action that is al\n    leged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a\n    policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision of\n    ficially adopted and promulgated by that body’s offi\n    cers. . . . [They can also be sued for] deprivations vis\n    ited pursuant to governmental ‘custom’ even though\n    such a custom has not received formal approval\n    through the body’s official decisionmaking channels.”\n    Id., at 690–691 (footnote omitted).\nThe Court has also included the terms “usage” and “prac\ntice” as customs for which liability is appropriate. See\nibid. The length of this list of types of municipal action\nleads us here to use a shorthand term “policy or custom,”\nbut when we do so, we mean to refer to the entire list. See\nid., at 694 (using the shorthand “policy or custom”); see\nalso, e.g., Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Comm., 555\nU. S. 246, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 10) (using the phrase\n“custom, policy, or practice,” to describe municipal liability\nunder §1983).\n   In sum, in Monell the Court held that “a municipality\ncannot be held liable” solely for the acts of others, e.g.,\n“solely because it employs a tortfeasor.” 436 U. S., at 691.\nBut the municipality may be held liable “when execution\nof a government’s policy or custom . . . inflicts the injury.”\nId., at 694 (emphasis added).\n                             B\n  The language of §1983 read in light of Monell’s under\nstanding of the legislative history explains why claims for\nprospective relief, like claims for money damages, fall\nwithin the scope of the “policy or custom” requirement.\nNothing in the text of §1983 suggests that the causation\nrequirement contained in the statute should change with\nthe form of relief sought. In fact, the text suggests the\nopposite when it provides that a person who meets §1983’s\n8           LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nelements “shall be liable . . . in an action at law, suit in\nequity, or other proper proceeding for redress.” Thus, as\nMonell explicitly stated, “[l]ocal governing bodies . . . can\nbe sued directly under §1983 for monetary, declaratory, or\ninjunctive relief where, as here, the action that is alleged\nto be unconstitutional implements or executes” a policy or\ncustom. 436 U. S., at 690 (emphasis added). Monell went\non to quote this Court’s statement in a 1973 case, Kenosha\nv. Bruno, 412 U. S. 507, 513, to the effect that the Con\ngress that enacted §1983 did not intend the “ ‘generic word\n“person” . . . to have a bifurcated application to municipal\ncorporations depending on the nature of the relief sought\nagainst them.’ ” 436 U. S., at 701, n. 66 (emphasis added).\nMonell added that “[n]othing we say today affects” this\npre-Monell “conclusion.” Ibid.\n   Monell’s logic also argues against any such relief-based\nbifurcation. The Monell Court thought that Congress\nintended potential §1983 liability where a municipality’s\nown violations were at issue but not where only the viola\ntions of others were at issue. The “policy or custom” re\nquirement rests upon that distinction and embodies it in\nlaw. To find the requirement inapplicable where prospec\ntive relief is at issue would undermine Monell’s logic. For\nwhether an action or omission is a municipality’s “own”\nhas to do with the nature of the action or omission, not\nwith the nature of the relief that is later sought in court.\n                               C\n  The Humphries’ (hereinafter respondents) arguments to\nthe contrary are unconvincing. Respondents correctly note\nthat by the time Monell reached the Supreme Court only\nthe plaintiffs’ damages claim remained live. See id., at\n661. From this fact they conclude that the Court’s holding\napplies directly only to claims for monetary damages. A\nholding, however, can extend through its logic beyond the\nspecific facts of the particular case. It does so here.\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Respondents add that not only did Monell involve a\ndamages claim, but its holding rests upon the concern that\nmunicipalities might have to pay large damages awards.\nThe Court so suggests when it points out that municipali\nties should not be liable for an employee’s wrongful acts,\nsimply by applying agency-based principles of respondeat\nsuperior. But as we have pointed out, the Court’s rejection\nof respondeat superior liability primarily rested not on the\nmunicipality’s economic needs, but on the fact that liabil\nity in such a case does not arise out of the municipality’s\nown wrongful conduct.\n   Respondents further claim that, where prospective relief\nis at issue, Monell is redundant. They say that a court\ncannot grant prospective relief against a municipality\nunless the municipality’s own conduct has caused the\nviolation. Hence, where such relief is otherwise proper,\nthe Monell requirement “shouldn’t screen out any case.”\nTr. of Oral Arg. 48.\n   To argue that a requirement is necessarily satisfied,\nhowever, is not to argue that its satisfaction is unneces\nsary. If respondents are right, our holding may have\nlimited practical significance. But that possibility does not\nprovide us with a convincing reason to sow confusion by\nadopting a bifurcated relief-based approach to municipal\nliability that the Court has previously rejected.\n   Finally, respondents make the mirror-image argument\nthat applying Monell’s requirement to prospective relief\nclaims will leave some set of ongoing constitutional viola\ntions beyond redress. Despite the fact that four Circuits\napply Monell’s requirement to prospective relief, however,\nrespondents have not presented us with any actual or\nhypothetical example that provides serious cause for\nconcern.\n                      *    *     *\n  For these reasons, we hold that Monell’s “policy or cus\n10         LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntom” requirement applies in §1983 cases irrespective of\nwhether the relief sought is monetary or prospective. The\nNinth Circuit’s contrary judgment is reversed, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/180037/", "sha1": "0079fe127e1c67b17f75aeb261aaf3456b1de879", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-11-30T07:03:08"}
