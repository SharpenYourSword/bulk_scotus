STEVENS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 08–769.     Argued October 6, 2009—Decided April 20, 2010\nCongress enacted 18 U. S. C. §48 to criminalize the commercial crea\n  tion, sale, or possession of certain depictions of animal cruelty. The\n  statute addresses only portrayals of harmful acts, not the underlying\n  conduct. It applies to any visual or auditory depiction “in which a liv\n  ing animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded, or\n  killed,” if that conduct violates federal or state law where “the crea\n  tion, sale, or possession takes place,” §48(c)(1). Another clause ex\n  empts depictions with “serious religious, political, scientific, educa\n  tional, journalistic, historical, or artistic value.”     §48(b).  The\n  legislative background of §48 focused primarily on “crush videos,”\n  which feature the torture and killing of helpless animals and are said\n  to appeal to persons with a specific sexual fetish. Respondent Ste\n  vens was indicted under §48 for selling videos depicting dogfighting.\n  He moved to dismiss, arguing that §48 is facially invalid under the\n  First Amendment. The District Court denied his motion, and Ste\n  vens was convicted. The Third Circuit vacated the conviction and de\n  clared §48 facially unconstitutional as a content-based regulation of\n  protected speech.\nHeld: Section §48 is substantially overbroad, and therefore invalid un\n der the First Amendment. Pp. 5–20.\n    (a) Depictions of animal cruelty are not, as a class, categorically\n unprotected by the First Amendment. Because §48 explicitly regu\n lates expression based on content, it is “ ‘presumptively invalid,’ . . .\n and the Government bears the burden to rebut that presumption.”\n United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803,\n 817. Since its enactment, the First Amendment has permitted re\n strictions on a few historic categories of speech—including obscenity,\n defamation, fraud, incitement, and speech integral to criminal con\n2                     UNITED STATES v.

Depic\n    tions of animal cruelty should not be added to that list. While the\n    prohibition of animal cruelty has a long history in American law,\n    there is no evidence of a similar tradition prohibiting depictions of\n    such cruelty. The Government’s proposed test would broadly balance\n    the value of the speech against its societal costs to determine\n    whether the First Amendment even applies. But the First Amend\n    ment’s free speech guarantee does not extend only to categories of\n    speech that survive an ad hoc balancing of relative social costs and\n    benefits. The Amendment itself reflects a judgment by the American\n    people that the benefits of its restrictions on the Government out\n    weigh the costs. New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, distinguished.\n    Pp. 5–9.\n       (b) Stevens’s facial challenge succeeds under existing doctrine.\n    Pp. 9–20.\n         (1) In the First Amendment context, a law may be invalidated as\n    overbroad if “a ‘substantial number’ of its applications are unconsti\n    tutional, ‘ “judged in relation to the statute’s plainly legitimate\n    sweep.” ’ ” Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican\n    Party, 552 U. S. 442, 449, n. 6. Stevens claims that common depic\n    tions of ordinary and lawful activities constitute the vast majority of\n    materials subject to §48. The Government does not defend such ap\n    plications, but contends that the statute is narrowly limited to spe\n    cific types of extreme material. Section 48’s constitutionality thus\n    turns on how broadly it is construed. Pp. 9–10.\n         (2) Section 48 creates a criminal prohibition of alarming breadth.\n    The statute’s definition of a “depiction of animal cruelty” does not\n    even require that the depicted conduct be cruel. While the words\n    “maimed, mutilated, [and] tortured” convey cruelty, “wounded” and\n    “killed” do not. Those words have little ambiguity and should be read\n    according to their ordinary meaning. Section 48 does require that the\n    depicted conduct be “illegal,” but many federal and state laws con\n    cerning the proper treatment of animals are not designed to guard\n    against animal cruelty. For example, endangered species protections\n    restrict even the humane wounding or killing of animals. The statute\n    draws no distinction based on the reason the conduct is made illegal.\n         Moreover, §48 applies to any depiction of conduct that is illegal\n    in the State in which the depiction is created, sold, or possessed, “re\n    gardless of whether the . . . wounding . . . or killing took place” there,\n    §48(c)(1). Depictions of entirely lawful conduct may run afoul of the\n    ban if those depictions later find their way into States where the\n    same conduct is unlawful. This greatly expands §48’s scope, because\n    views about animal cruelty and regulations having no connection to\n                   Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ncruelty vary widely from place to place. Hunting is unlawful in the\nDistrict of Columbia, for example, but there is an enormous national\nmarket for hunting-related depictions, greatly exceeding the demand\nfor crush videos or animal fighting depictions. Because the statute\nallows each jurisdiction to export its laws to the rest of the country,\n§48(a) applies to any magazine or video depicting lawful hunting that\nis sold in the Nation’s Capital. Those seeking to comply with the law\nface a bewildering maze of regulations from at least 56 separate ju\nrisdictions. Pp. 11–15.\n     (3) Limiting §48’s reach to crush videos and depictions of animal\nfighting or other extreme cruelty, as the Government suggests, re\nquires an unrealistically broad reading of the statute’s exceptions\nclause. The statute only exempts material with “serious” value, and\n“serious” must be taken seriously. The excepted speech must also fall\nwithin one of §48(b)’s enumerated categories. Much speech does not.\nFor example, most hunting depictions are not obviously instructional\nin nature. The exceptions clause simply has no adequate reading\nthat results in the statute’s banning only the depictions the Govern\nment would like to ban.\n     Although the language of §48(b) is drawn from the Court’s deci\nsion in Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, the exceptions clause does\nnot answer every First Amendment objection. Under Miller, “seri\nous” value shields depictions of sex from regulation as obscenity. But\nMiller did not determine that serious value could be used as a gen\neral precondition to protecting other types of speech in the first place.\nEven “ ‘wholly neutral futilities . . . come under the protection of free\nspeech.’ ” Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15, 25. The First Amend\nment presumptively extends to many forms of speech that do not\nqualify for §48(b)’s serious-value exception, but nonetheless fall\nwithin §48(c)’s broad reach. Pp. 15–17.\n     (4) Despite the Government’s assurance that it will apply §48 to\nreach only “extreme” cruelty, this Court will not uphold an unconsti\ntutional statute merely because the Government promises to use it\nresponsibly. Nor can the Court construe this statutory language to\navoid constitutional doubt. A limiting construction can be imposed\nonly if the statute “is ‘readily susceptible’ to such a construction,”\nReno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 884. To read\n§48 as the Government desires requires rewriting, not just reinter\npretation. Pp. 18–19.\n     (5) This construction of §48 decides the constitutional question.\nThe Government makes no effort to defend §48 as applied beyond\ncrush videos and depictions of animal fighting. It argues that those\nparticular depictions are intrinsically related to criminal conduct or\nare analogous to obscenity (if not themselves obscene), and that the\n4                    UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    ban on such speech would satisfy the proper level of scrutiny. But\n    the Government nowhere extends these arguments to other depic\n    tions, such as hunting magazines and videos, that are presumptively\n    protected by the First Amendment but that remain subject to §48.\n    Nor does the Government seriously contest that these presumptively\n    impermissible applications of §48 far outnumber any permissible\n    ones. The Court therefore does not decide whether a statute limited\n    to crush videos or other depictions of extreme animal cruelty would\n    be constitutional. Section 48 is not so limited but is instead substan\n    tially overbroad, and therefore invalid under the First Amendment.\n    Pp. 19–20.\n533 F. 3d 218, affirmed.\n\n   ROBERTS, C.

S. C. §48 to criminalize the\ncommercial creation, sale, or possession of certain depic\ntions of animal cruelty. The statute does not address\nunderlying acts harmful to animals, but only portrayals of\nsuch conduct. The question presented is whether the\nprohibition in the statute is consistent with the freedom of\nspeech guaranteed by the First Amendment.\n                            I\n  Section 48 establishes a criminal penalty of up to five\nyears in prison for anyone who knowingly “creates, sells,\nor possesses a depiction of animal cruelty,” if done “for\ncommercial gain” in interstate or foreign commerce.\n§48(a).1 A depiction of “animal cruelty” is defined as one\n——————\n  1 The  statute reads in full:\n  “§48. Depiction of animal cruelty\n     “(a) CREATION, SALE, OR POSSESSION.—Whoever knowingly creates,\nsells, or possesses a depiction of animal cruelty with the intention of\nplacing that depiction in interstate or foreign commerce for commercial\ngain, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5\n2                    UNITED STATES v.

In what is referred to\nas the “exceptions clause,” the law exempts from prohibi\ntion any depiction “that has serious religious, political,\nscientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic\nvalue.” §48(b).\n   The legislative background of §48 focused primarily on\nthe interstate market for “crush videos.” According to the\nHouse Committee Report on the bill, such videos feature\nthe intentional torture and killing of helpless animals,\nincluding cats, dogs, monkeys, mice, and hamsters. H. R.\nRep. No. 106–397, p. 2 (1999) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.).\nCrush videos often depict women slowly crushing animals\nto death “with their bare feet or while wearing high heeled\nshoes,” sometimes while “talking to the animals in a kind\nof dominatrix patter” over “[t]he cries and squeals of the\nanimals, obviously in great pain.” Ibid.

The acts depicted in crush videos are\ntypically prohibited by the animal cruelty laws enacted by\nall 50 States and the District of Columbia. See Brief for\nUnited States 25, n. 7 (listing statutes). But crush videos\nrarely disclose the participants’ identities, inhibiting\nprosecution of the underlying conduct. See H. R. Rep., at\n3; accord, Brief for State of Florida et al. as Amici Curiae\n11.\n   This case, however, involves an application of §48 to\ndepictions of animal fighting. Dogfighting, for example, is\nunlawful in all 50 States and the District of Columbia, see\nBrief for United States 26, n. 8 (listing statutes), and has\nbeen restricted by federal law since 1976. Animal Welfare\nAct Amendments of 1976, §17, 90 Stat. 421, 7 U. S. C.\n§2156. Respondent Robert J. Stevens ran a business,\n“Dogs of Velvet and Steel,” and an associated Web site,\nthrough which he sold videos of pit bulls engaging in\ndogfights and attacking other animals. Among these\nvideos were Japan Pit Fights and Pick-A-Winna: A Pit\nBull Documentary, which include contemporary footage of\ndogfights in Japan (where such conduct is allegedly legal)\nas well as footage of American dogfights from the 1960’s\nand 1970’s.2 A third video, Catch Dogs and Country Liv\ning, depicts the use of pit bulls to hunt wild boar, as well\nas a “gruesome” scene of a pit bull attacking a domestic\nfarm pig. 533 F. 3d 218, 221 (CA3 2008) (en banc). On the\nbasis of these videos, Stevens was indicted on three counts\nof violating §48.\n   Stevens moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that\n§48 is facially invalid under the First Amendment.

STEVENS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nDistrict Court denied the motion. It held that the depic\ntions subject to §48, like obscenity or child pornography,\nare categorically unprotected by the First Amendment.\n2:04–cr–00051–ANB (WD Pa., Nov. 10, 2004), App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 65a–71a. It went on to hold that §48 is not sub\nstantially overbroad, because the exceptions clause suffi\nciently narrows the statute to constitutional applications.\nId., at 71a–75a. The jury convicted Stevens on all counts,\nand the District Court sentenced him to three concurrent\nsentences of 37 months’ imprisonment, followed by three\nyears of supervised release. App. 37.\n   The en banc Third Circuit, over a three-judge dissent,\ndeclared §48 facially unconstitutional and vacated Ste\nvens’s conviction. 533 F. 3d 218. The Court of Appeals\nfirst held that §48 regulates speech that is protected by\nthe First Amendment. The Court declined to recognize a\nnew category of unprotected speech for depictions of ani\nmal cruelty, id., at 224, and n. 6, and rejected the Gov\nernment’s analogy between animal cruelty depictions and\nchild pornography, id., at 224–232.\n   The Court of Appeals then held that §48 could not sur\nvive strict scrutiny as a content-based regulation of pro\ntected speech. Id., at 232. It found that the statute lacked\na compelling government interest and was neither nar\nrowly tailored to preventing animal cruelty nor the least\nrestrictive means of doing so. Id., at 232–235. It therefore\nheld §48 facially invalid.\n   In an extended footnote, the Third Circuit noted that\n§48 “might also be unconstitutionally overbroad,” because\nit “potentially covers a great deal of constitutionally pro\ntected speech” and “sweeps [too] widely” to be limited only\nby prosecutorial discretion. Id., at 235, n. 16. But the\nCourt of Appeals declined to rest its analysis on this\nground.\n   We granted certiorari. 556 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

We\ndisagree.\n   The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall\nmake no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.” “[A]s a\ngeneral matter, the First Amendment means that gov\nernment has no power to restrict expression because of its\nmessage, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.”\nAshcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 535 U. S. 564,\n573 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). Section 48\nexplicitly regulates expression based on content: The\nstatute restricts “visual [and] auditory depiction[s],” such\nas photographs, videos, or sound recordings, depending on\nwhether they depict conduct in which a living animal is\nintentionally harmed. As such, §48 is “ ‘presumptively\ninvalid,’ and the Government bears the burden to rebut\nthat presumption.” United States v. Playboy Entertain\nment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 817 (2000) (quoting\nR. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 382 (1992); citation\nomitted).\n   “From 1791 to the present,” however, the First Amend\nment has “permitted restrictions upon the content of\nspeech in a few limited areas,” and has never “include[d] a\nfreedom to disregard these traditional limitations.” Id., at\n382–383. These “historic and traditional categories long\nfamiliar to the bar,” Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of\nN. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 127 (1991)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment)—including obscen\nity, Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476, 483 (1957), defa\nmation, Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U.

S. 444, 447–449\n6               UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(1969) (per curiam), and speech integral to criminal con\nduct, Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., 336 U. S. 490,\n498 (1949)—are “well-defined and narrowly limited classes\nof speech, the prevention and punishment of which have\nnever been thought to raise any Constitutional problem.”\nChaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568, 571–572\n(1942).\n   The Government argues that “depictions of animal\ncruelty” should be added to the list. It contends that\ndepictions of “illegal acts of animal cruelty” that are\n“made, sold, or possessed for commercial gain” necessarily\n“lack expressive value,” and may accordingly “be regulated\nas unprotected speech.” Brief for United States 10 (em\nphasis added). The claim is not just that Congress may\nregulate depictions of animal cruelty subject to the First\nAmendment, but that these depictions are outside the\nreach of that Amendment altogether—that they fall into a\n“ ‘First Amendment Free Zone.’ ”          Board of Airport\nComm’rs of Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus, Inc., 482 U. S.\n569, 574 (1987).\n   As the Government notes, the prohibition of animal\ncruelty itself has a long history in American law, starting\nwith the early settlement of the Colonies. Reply Brief 12,\nn. 8; see, e.g., The Body of Liberties §92 (Mass. Bay Colony\n1641), reprinted in American Historical Documents 1000–\n1904, 43 Harvard Classics 66, 79 (C. Eliot ed. 1910) (“No\nman shall exercise any Tirranny or Crueltie towards any\nbruite Creature which are usuallie kept for man’s use”).\nBut we are unaware of any similar tradition excluding\ndepictions of animal cruelty from “the freedom of speech”\ncodified in the First Amendment, and the Government\npoints us to none.\n   The Government contends that “historical evidence”\nabout the reach of the First Amendment is not “a neces\nsary prerequisite for regulation today,” Reply Brief 12,\nn. 8, and that categories of speech may be exempted from\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe First Amendment’s protection without any long-settled\ntradition of subjecting that speech to regulation. Instead,\nthe Government points to Congress’s “ ‘legislative judg\nment that . . . depictions of animals being intentionally\ntortured and killed [are] of such minimal redeeming value\nas to render [them] unworthy of First Amendment protec\ntion,’ ” Brief for United States 23 (quoting 533 F. 3d, at 243\n(Cowen, J., dissenting)), and asks the Court to uphold the\nban on the same basis. The Government thus proposes\nthat a claim of categorical exclusion should be considered\nunder a simple balancing test: “Whether a given category\nof speech enjoys First Amendment protection depends\nupon a categorical balancing of the value of the speech\nagainst its societal costs.” Brief for United States 8; see\nalso id., at 12.\n   As a free-floating test for First Amendment coverage,\nthat sentence is startling and dangerous. The First\nAmendment’s guarantee of free speech does not extend\nonly to categories of speech that survive an ad hoc balanc\ning of relative social costs and benefits.         The First\nAmendment itself reflects a judgment by the American\npeople that the benefits of its restrictions on the Govern\nment outweigh the costs. Our Constitution forecloses any\nattempt to revise that judgment simply on the basis that\nsome speech is not worth it. The Constitution is not a\ndocument “prescribing limits, and declaring that those\nlimits may be passed at pleasure.” Marbury v. Madison, 1\nCranch 137, 178 (1803).\n   To be fair to the Government, its view did not emerge\nfrom a vacuum. As the Government correctly notes, this\nCourt has often described historically unprotected catego\nries of speech as being “ ‘of such slight social value as a\nstep to truth that any benefit that may be derived from\nthem is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order\nand morality.’ ” R. A. V., supra, at 383 (quoting Chap\nlinsky, supra, at 572). In New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S.\n8               UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n747 (1982), we noted that within these categories of unpro\ntected speech, “the evil to be restricted so overwhelmingly\noutweighs the expressive interests, if any, at stake, that\nno process of case-by-case adjudication is required,” be\ncause “the balance of competing interests is clearly\nstruck,” id., at 763–764. The Government derives its\nproposed test from these descriptions in our precedents.\nSee Brief for United States 12–13.\n  But such descriptions are just that—descriptive. They\ndo not set forth a test that may be applied as a general\nmatter to permit the Government to imprison any speaker\nso long as his speech is deemed valueless or unnecessary,\nor so long as an ad hoc calculus of costs and benefits tilts\nin a statute’s favor.\n  When we have identified categories of speech as fully\noutside the protection of the First Amendment, it has not\nbeen on the basis of a simple cost-benefit analysis. In\nFerber, for example, we classified child pornography as\nsuch a category, 458 U. S., at 763. We noted that the\nState of New York had a compelling interest in protecting\nchildren from abuse, and that the value of using children\nin these works (as opposed to simulated conduct or adult\nactors) was de minimis. Id., at 756–757, 762. But our\ndecision did not rest on this “balance of competing inter\nests” alone. Id., at 764. We made clear that Ferber pre\nsented a special case: The market for child pornography\nwas “intrinsically related” to the underlying abuse, and\nwas therefore “an integral part of the production of such\nmaterials, an activity illegal throughout the Nation.” Id.,\nat 759, 761. As we noted, “ ‘[i]t rarely has been suggested\nthat the constitutional freedom for speech and press ex\ntends its immunity to speech or writing used as an inte\ngral part of conduct in violation of a valid criminal stat\nute.’ ” Id., at 761–762 (quoting Giboney, supra, at 498).\nFerber thus grounded its analysis in a previously recog\nnized, long-established category of unprotected speech,\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand our subsequent decisions have shared this under\nstanding. See Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U. S. 103, 110 (1990)\n(describing Ferber as finding “persuasive” the argument\nthat the advertising and sale of child pornography was “an\nintegral part” of its unlawful production (internal quota\ntion marks omitted)); Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition,\n535 U. S. 234, 249–250 (2002) (noting that distribution\nand sale “were intrinsically related to the sexual abuse of\nchildren,” giving the speech at issue “a proximate link to\nthe crime from which it came” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n   Our decisions in Ferber and other cases cannot be taken\nas establishing a freewheeling authority to declare new\ncategories of speech outside the scope of the First Amend\nment. Maybe there are some categories of speech that\nhave been historically unprotected, but have not yet been\nspecifically identified or discussed as such in our case law.\nBut if so, there is no evidence that “depictions of animal\ncruelty” is among them. We need not foreclose the future\nrecognition of such additional categories to reject the\nGovernment’s highly manipulable balancing test as a\nmeans of identifying them.\n                           III\n  Because we decline to carve out from the First Amend\nment any novel exception for §48, we review Stevens’s\nFirst Amendment challenge under our existing doctrine.\n                               A\n   Stevens challenged §48 on its face, arguing that any\nconviction secured under the statute would be unconstitu\ntional. The court below decided the case on that basis, 533\nF. 3d, at 231, n. 13, and we granted the Solicitor General’s\npetition for certiorari to determine “whether 18 U. S. C. 48\nis facially invalid under the Free Speech Clause of the\nFirst Amendment,” Pet. for Cert. i.\n10                  UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   To succeed in a typical facial attack, Stevens would have\nto establish “that no set of circumstances exists under\nwhich [§48] would be valid,” United States v. Salerno, 481\nU. S. 739, 745 (1987), or that the statute lacks any “plainly\nlegitimate sweep,” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S.\n702, 740, n. 7 (1997) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judg\nments) (internal quotation marks omitted). Which stan\ndard applies in a typical case is a matter of dispute that\nwe need not and do not address, and neither Salerno nor\nGlucksberg is a speech case. Here the Government asserts\nthat Stevens cannot prevail because §48 is plainly legiti\nmate as applied to crush videos and animal fighting depic\ntions. Deciding this case through a traditional facial\nanalysis would require us to resolve whether these appli\ncations of §48 are in fact consistent with the Constitution.\n   In the First Amendment context, however, this Court\nrecognizes “a second type of facial challenge,” whereby a\nlaw may be invalidated as overbroad if “a substantial\nnumber of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in\nrelation to the statute’s plainly legitimate sweep.” Wash\nington State Grange v. Washington State Republican\nParty, 552 U. S. 442, 449, n. 6 (2008) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Stevens argues that §48 applies to com\nmon depictions of ordinary and lawful activities, and that\nthese depictions constitute the vast majority of materials\nsubject to the statute. Brief for Respondent 22–25. The\nGovernment makes no effort to defend such a broad ban as\nconstitutional. Instead, the Government’s entire defense\nof §48 rests on interpreting the statute as narrowly lim\nited to specific types of “extreme” material. Brief for\nUnited States 8. As the parties have presented the issue,\ntherefore, the constitutionality of §48 hinges on how\nbroadly it is construed. It is to that question that we now\nturn.3\n——————\n 3 The   dissent contends that because there has not been a ruling on\n                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010) \n                  11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              B\n\n   As we explained two Terms ago, “[t]he first step in\noverbreadth analysis is to construe the challenged statute;\nit is impossible to determine whether a statute reaches too\nfar without first knowing what the statute covers.” United\nStates v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 293 (2008). Because §48\nis a federal statute, there is no need to defer to a state\ncourt’s authority to interpret its own law.\n   We read §48 to create a criminal prohibition of alarming\nbreadth. To begin with, the text of the statute’s ban on a\n“depiction of animal cruelty” nowhere requires that the\ndepicted conduct be cruel. That text applies to “any . . .\ndepiction” in which “a living animal is intentionally\nmaimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded, or killed.”\n§48(c)(1). “[M]aimed, mutilated, [and] tortured” convey\ncruelty, but “wounded” or “killed” do not suggest any such\nlimitation.\n   The Government contends that the terms in the defini\ntion should be read to require the additional element of\n“accompanying acts of cruelty.” Reply Brief 6; see also Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 17–19. (The dissent hinges on the same\n——————\nthe validity of the statute as applied to Stevens, our consideration of his\nfacial overbreadth claim is premature. Post, at 1, and n. 1, 2–3 (opinion\nof ALITO, J.). Whether or not that conclusion follows, here no as-applied\nclaim has been preserved. Neither court below construed Stevens’s\nbriefs as adequately developing a separate attack on a defined subset of\nthe statute’s applications (say, dogfighting videos). See 533 F. 3d 218,\n231, n. 13 (CA3 2008) (en banc) (“Stevens brings a facial challenge to\nthe statute”); App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a, 74a. Neither did the Govern\nment, see Brief for United States in No. 05–2497 (CA3), p. 28 (opposing\n“the appellant’s facial challenge”); accord, Brief for United States 4.\nThe sentence in Stevens’s appellate brief mentioning his unrelated\nsufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge hardly developed a First Amend\nment as-applied claim. See post, at 1, n. 1. Stevens’s constitutional\nargument is a general one. And unlike the challengers in Washington\nState Grange, Stevens does not “rest on factual assumptions . . . that\ncan be evaluated only in the context of an as-applied challenge.” 552\nU. S., at 444.\n12               UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nassumption. See post, at 6, 9.) The Government bases\nthis argument on the definiendum, “depiction of animal\ncruelty,” cf. Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11 (2004), and\non “ ‘the commonsense canon of noscitur a sociis.’ ” Reply\nBrief 7 (quoting Williams, 553 U. S., at 294). As that\ncanon recognizes, an ambiguous term may be “given more\nprecise content by the neighboring words with which it is\nassociated.” Ibid. Likewise, an unclear definitional\nphrase may take meaning from the term to be defined, see\nLeocal, supra, at 11 (interpreting a “ ‘substantial risk’ ” of\nthe “us[e]” of “physical force” as part of the definition of\n“ ‘crime of violence’ ”).\n    But the phrase “wounded . . . or killed” at issue here\ncontains little ambiguity. The Government’s opening brief\nproperly applies the ordinary meaning of these words,\nstating for example that to “ ‘kill’ is ‘to deprive of life.’ ”\nBrief for United States 14 (quoting Webster’s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 1242 (1993)). We agree that\n“wounded” and “killed” should be read according to their\nordinary meaning. Cf. Engine Mfrs. Assn. v. South Coast\nAir Quality Management Dist., 541 U. S. 246, 252 (2004).\nNothing about that meaning requires cruelty.\n    While not requiring cruelty, §48 does require that the\ndepicted conduct be “illegal.” But this requirement does\nnot limit §48 along the lines the Government suggests.\nThere are myriad federal and state laws concerning the\nproper treatment of animals, but many of them are not\ndesigned to guard against animal cruelty. Protections of\nendangered species, for example, restrict even the humane\n“wound[ing] or kill[ing]” of “living animal[s].” §48(c)(1).\nLivestock regulations are often designed to protect the\nhealth of human beings, and hunting and fishing rules\n(seasons, licensure, bag limits, weight requirements) can\nbe designed to raise revenue, preserve animal populations,\nor prevent accidents. The text of §48(c) draws no distinc\ntion based on the reason the intentional killing of an\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nanimal is made illegal, and includes, for example, the\nhumane slaughter of a stolen cow.4\n   What is more, the application of §48 to depictions of\nillegal conduct extends to conduct that is illegal in only a\nsingle jurisdiction. Under subsection (c)(1), the depicted\nconduct need only be illegal in “the State in which the\ncreation, sale, or possession takes place, regardless of\nwhether the . . . wounding . . . or killing took place in\n[that] State.” A depiction of entirely lawful conduct runs\nafoul of the ban if that depiction later finds its way into\nanother State where the same conduct is unlawful. This\nprovision greatly expands the scope of §48, because al\nthough there may be “a broad societal consensus” against\ncruelty to animals, Brief for United States 2, there is\nsubstantial disagreement on what types of conduct are\nproperly regarded as cruel. Both views about cruelty to\nanimals and regulations having no connection to cruelty\nvary widely from place to place.\n   In the District of Columbia, for example, all hunting is\nunlawful. D. C. Munic. Regs., tit. 19, §1560 (2009). Other\njurisdictions permit or encourage hunting, and there is an\nenormous national market for hunting-related depictions\nin which a living animal is intentionally killed. Hunting\nperiodicals have circulations in the hundreds of thousands\nor millions, see Mediaweek, Sept. 29, 2008, p. 28, and\nhunting television programs, videos, and Web sites are\nequally popular, see Brief for Professional Outdoor Media\n\n——————\n   4 The citations in the dissent’s appendix are beside the point. The\n\ncited statutes stand for the proposition that hunting is not covered by\nanimal cruelty laws. But the reach of §48 is, as we have explained, not\nrestricted to depictions of conduct that violates a law specifically\ndirected at animal cruelty. It simply requires that the depicted conduct\nbe “illegal.” §48(c)(1). The Government implicitly admits as much,\narguing that “instructional videos for hunting” are saved by the stat\nute’s exceptions clause, not that they fall outside the prohibition in the\nfirst place. Reply Brief 6.\n14               UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nAssociation et al. as Amici Curiae 9–10. The demand for\nhunting depictions exceeds the estimated demand for\ncrush videos or animal fighting depictions by several\norders of magnitude. Compare ibid. and Brief for National\nRifle Association of America, Inc., as Amicus Curiae 12\n(hereinafter NRA Brief) (estimating that hunting maga\nzines alone account for $135 million in annual retail sales)\nwith Brief for United States 43–44, 46 (suggesting $1\nmillion in crush video sales per year, and noting that\nStevens earned $57,000 from his videos). Nonetheless,\nbecause the statute allows each jurisdiction to export its\nlaws to the rest of the country, §48(a) extends to any\nmagazine or video depicting lawful hunting, so long as\nthat depiction is sold within the Nation’s Capital.\n   Those seeking to comply with the law thus face a bewil\ndering maze of regulations from at least 56 separate juris\ndictions. Some States permit hunting with crossbows, Ga.\nCode Ann. §27–3–4(1) (2007); Va. Code Ann. §29.1–\n519(A)(6) (Lexis 2008 Cum. Supp.), while others forbid it,\nOre. Admin. Reg. 635–065–0725 (2009), or restrict it only\nto the disabled, N. Y. Envir. Conserv. Law Ann. §11–\n0901(16) (West 2005). Missouri allows the “canned” hunt\ning of ungulates held in captivity, Mo. Code Regs. Ann.,\ntit. 3, 10–9.560(1), but Montana restricts such hunting to\ncertain bird species, Mont. Admin. Rule 12.6.1202(1)\n(2007). The sharp-tailed grouse may be hunted in Idaho,\nbut not in Washington. Compare Idaho Admin. Code\n§13.01.09.606 (2009) with Wash. Admin. Code §232–28–\n342 (2009).\n   The disagreements among the States—and the “com\nmonwealth[s], territor[ies], or possession[s] of the United\nStates,” 18 U. S. C. §48(c)(2)—extend well beyond hunting.\nState agricultural regulations permit different methods of\nlivestock slaughter in different places or as applied to differ\nent animals. Compare, e.g., Fla. Stat. §828.23(5) (2007)\n(excluding poultry from humane slaughter requirements)\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwith Cal. Food & Agric. Code Ann. §19501(b) (West 2001)\n(including some poultry). California has recently banned\ncutting or “docking” the tails of dairy cattle, which other\nStates permit. 2009 Cal. Legis. Serv. Ch. 344 (S. B. 135)\n(West). Even cockfighting, long considered immoral in\nmuch of America, see Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501\nU. S. 560, 575 (1991) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment),\nis legal in Puerto Rico, see 15 Laws P. R. Ann. §301 (Supp.\n2008); Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of\nP. R., 478 U. S. 328, 342 (1986), and was legal in Louisi\nana until 2008, see La. Stat. Ann. §14:102.23 (West) (effec\ntive Aug. 15, 2008). An otherwise-lawful image of any of\nthese practices, if sold or possessed for commercial gain\nwithin a State that happens to forbid the practice, falls\nwithin the prohibition of §48(a).\n                              C\n   The only thing standing between defendants who sell\nsuch depictions and five years in federal prison—other\nthan the mercy of a prosecutor—is the statute’s exceptions\nclause. Subsection (b) exempts from prohibition “any\ndepiction that has serious religious, political, scientific,\neducational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value.” The\nGovernment argues that this clause substantially narrows\nthe statute’s reach: News reports about animal cruelty\nhave “journalistic” value; pictures of bullfights in Spain\nhave “historical” value; and instructional hunting videos\nhave “educational” value. Reply Brief 6. Thus, the Gov\nernment argues, §48 reaches only crush videos, depictions\nof animal fighting (other than Spanish bullfighting, see\nBrief for United States 47–48), and perhaps other depic\ntions of “extreme acts of animal cruelty.” Id., at 41.\n   The Government’s attempt to narrow the statutory ban,\nhowever, requires an unrealistically broad reading of the\nexceptions clause. As the Government reads the clause,\nany material with “redeeming societal value,” id., at 9, 16,\n16              UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n23, “ ‘at least some minimal value,’ ” Reply Brief 6 (quoting\nH. R. Rep., at 4), or anything more than “scant social\nvalue,” Reply Brief 11, is excluded under §48(b). But the\ntext says “serious” value, and “serious” should be taken\nseriously.      We decline the Government’s invitation—\nadvanced for the first time in this Court—to regard as\n“serious” anything that is not “scant.” (Or, as the dissent\nputs it, “ ‘trifling.’ ” Post, at 6.) As the Government recog\nnized below, “serious” ordinarily means a good bit more.\nThe District Court’s jury instructions required value that\nis “significant and of great import,” App. 132, and the\nGovernment defended these instructions as properly\nrelying on “a commonly accepted meaning of the word\n‘serious,’ ” Brief for United States in No. 05–2497 (CA3), p.\n50.\n   Quite apart from the requirement of “serious” value in\n§48(b), the excepted speech must also fall within one of the\nenumerated categories. Much speech does not. Most\nhunting videos, for example, are not obviously instruc\ntional in nature, except in the sense that all life is a les\nson. According to Safari Club International and the Con\ngressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, many popular videos\n“have primarily entertainment value” and are designed to\n“entertai[n] the viewer, marke[t] hunting equipment, or\nincreas[e] the hunting community.” Brief for Safari Club\nInternational et al. as Amici Curiae 12. The National\nRifle Association agrees that “much of the content of hunt\ning media . . . is merely recreational in nature.” NRA Brief\n28. The Government offers no principled explanation why\nthese depictions of hunting or depictions of Spanish bull\nfights would be inherently valuable while those of Japa\nnese dogfights are not. The dissent contends that hunting\ndepictions must have serious value because hunting has\nserious value, in a way that dogfights presumably do not.\nPost, at 6–8. But §48(b) addresses the value of the depic\ntions, not of the underlying activity. There is simply no\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)             17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nadequate reading of the exceptions clause that results in\nthe statute’s banning only the depictions the Government\nwould like to ban.\n    The Government explains that the language of §48(b)\nwas largely drawn from our opinion in Miller v. California,\n413 U. S. 15 (1973), which excepted from its definition of\nobscenity any material with “serious literary, artistic,\npolitical, or scientific value,” id., at 24. See Reply Brief 8,\n9, and n. 5. According to the Government, this incorpora\ntion of the Miller standard into §48 is therefore surely\nenough to answer any First Amendment objection. Reply\nBrief 8–9.\n    In Miller we held that “serious” value shields depictions\nof sex from regulation as obscenity. 413 U. S., at 24–25.\nLimiting Miller’s exception to “serious” value ensured that\n“ ‘[a] quotation from Voltaire in the flyleaf of a book\n[would] not constitutionally redeem an otherwise obscene\npublication.’ ” Id., at 25, n. 7 (quoting Kois v. Wisconsin,\n408 U. S. 229, 231 (1972) (per curiam)). We did not, how\never, determine that serious value could be used as a\ngeneral precondition to protecting other types of speech in\nthe first place. Most of what we say to one another lacks\n“religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic,\nhistorical, or artistic value” (let alone serious value), but it\nis still sheltered from government regulation. Even\n“ ‘[w]holly neutral futilities . . . come under the protection\nof free speech as fully as do Keats’ poems or Donne’s ser\nmons.’ ” Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15, 25 (1971) (quot\ning Winters v. New York, 333 U. S. 507, 528 (1948) (Frank\nfurter, J., dissenting); alteration in original).\n    Thus, the protection of the First Amendment presump\ntively extends to many forms of speech that do not qualify\nfor the serious-value exception of §48(b), but nonetheless\nfall within the broad reach of §48(c).\n18               UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                                D\n   Not to worry, the Government says: The Executive\nBranch construes §48 to reach only “extreme” cruelty,\nBrief for United States 8, and it “neither has brought nor\nwill bring a prosecution for anything less,” Reply Brief 6–\n7. The Government hits this theme hard, invoking its\nprosecutorial discretion several times. See id., at 6–7, 10,\nand n. 6, 19, 22. But the First Amendment protects\nagainst the Government; it does not leave us at the mercy\nof noblesse oblige. We would not uphold an unconstitu\ntional statute merely because the Government promised to\nuse it responsibly. Cf. Whitman v. American Trucking\nAssns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 473 (2001).\n   This prosecution is itself evidence of the danger in put\nting faith in government representations of prosecutorial\nrestraint. When this legislation was enacted, the Execu\ntive Branch announced that it would interpret §48 as\ncovering only depictions “of wanton cruelty to animals\ndesigned to appeal to a prurient interest in sex.” See\nStatement by President William J. Clinton upon Signing\nH. R. 1887, 34 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 2557 (Dec. 9,\n1999). No one suggests that the videos in this case fit that\ndescription. The Government’s assurance that it will\napply §48 far more restrictively than its language provides\nis pertinent only as an implicit acknowledgment of the\npotential constitutional problems with a more natural\nreading.\n   Nor can we rely upon the canon of construction that\n“ambiguous statutory language [should] be construed to\navoid serious constitutional doubts.” FCC v. Fox Televi\nsion Stations, Inc., 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at\n12). “[T]his Court may impose a limiting construction on a\nstatute only if it is ‘readily susceptible’ to such a construc\ntion.” Reno v.

To read §48 as the Government desires\nrequires rewriting, not just reinterpretation.\n                        *     *     *\n   Our construction of §48 decides the constitutional ques\ntion; the Government makes no effort to defend the consti\ntutionality of §48 as applied beyond crush videos and\ndepictions of animal fighting. It argues that those particu\nlar depictions are intrinsically related to criminal conduct\nor are analogous to obscenity (if not themselves obscene),\nand that the ban on such speech is narrowly tailored to\nreinforce restrictions on the underlying conduct, prevent\nadditional crime arising from the depictions, or safeguard\npublic mores. But the Government nowhere attempts to\nextend these arguments to depictions of any other activi\nties—depictions that are presumptively protected by the\nFirst Amendment but that remain subject to the criminal\nsanctions of §48.\n   Nor does the Government seriously contest that the\npresumptively impermissible applications of §48 (properly\nconstrued) far outnumber any permissible ones. However\n“growing” and “lucrative” the markets for crush videos and\ndogfighting depictions might be, see Brief for United\nStates 43, 46 (internal quotation marks omitted), they are\ndwarfed by the market for other depictions, such as hunt\ning magazines and videos, that we have determined to be\nwithin the scope of §48.

S. C. §48, that was enacted not to suppress\nspeech, but to prevent horrific acts of animal cruelty—in\nparticular, the creation and commercial exploitation of\n“crush videos,” a form of depraved entertainment that has\nno social value. The Court’s approach, which has the\npractical effect of legalizing the sale of such videos and is\nthus likely to spur a resumption of their production, is\nunwarranted. Respondent was convicted under §48 for\nselling videos depicting dogfights. On appeal, he argued,\namong other things, that §48 is unconstitutional as ap\nplied to the facts of this case, and he highlighted features\nof those videos that might distinguish them from other\ndogfight videos brought to our attention.1 The Court of\n——————\n  1 Respondent     argued at length that the evidence was insufficient to\nprove that the particular videos he sold lacked any serious scientific,\neducational, or historical value and thus fell outside the exception in\n§48(b). See Brief for Appellant in No. 05–2497 (CA3), pp. 72–79. He\nadded that, if the evidence in this case was held to be sufficient to take\nhis videos outside the scope of the exception, then “this case presents\n. . . a situation” in which “a constitutional violation occurs.” Id., at 71.\nSee also id., at 47 (“The applicability of 18 U.

Today’s decision does not endorse the\nCourt of Appeals’ reasoning, but it nevertheless strikes\ndown §48 using what has been aptly termed the “strong\nmedicine” of the overbreadth doctrine, United States v.\nWilliams, 553 U. S. 285, 293 (2008) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted), a potion that generally should be admin\nistered only as “a last resort.” Los Angeles Police Dept. v.\nUnited Reporting Publishing Corp., 528 U. S. 32, 39 (1999)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Instead of applying the doctrine of overbreadth, I would\nvacate the decision below and instruct the Court of Ap\npeals on remand to decide whether the videos that respon\ndent sold are constitutionally protected. If the question of\noverbreadth is to be decided, however, I do not think the\npresent record supports the Court’s conclusion that §48\nbans a substantial quantity of protected speech.\n                             I\n   A party seeking to challenge the constitutionality of a\nstatute generally must show that the statute violates the\nparty’s own rights. New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 767\n(1982). The First Amendment overbreadth doctrine carves\nout a narrow exception to that general rule. See id., at\n768; Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.

See, e.g., Board of\nTrustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 483\n(1989) (“Ordinarily, the principal advantage of the over\nbreadth doctrine for a litigant is that it enables him to\nbenefit from the statute’s unlawful application to someone\nelse”); see also Ohralik v.

S.\n447, 462, n. 20 (1978) (describing the doctrine as one\n“under which a person may challenge a statute that in\nfringes protected speech even if the statute constitution\nally might be applied to him”).\n   The “strong medicine” of overbreadth invalidation need\nnot and generally should not be administered when the\nstatute under attack is unconstitutional as applied to the\nchallenger before the court. As we said in Fox, supra, at\n484–485, “[i]t is not the usual judicial practice, . . . nor do\nwe consider it generally desirable, to proceed to an over\nbreadth issue unnecessarily—that is, before it is deter\nmined that the statute would be valid as applied.” Accord,\nNew York State Club Assn., Inc. v.

S., at 292.\nSpecifically, the doctrine seeks to balance the “harmful\neffects” of “invalidating a law that in some of its applica\ntions is perfectly constitutional” against the possibility\nthat “the threat of enforcement of an overbroad law [will]\ndete[r] people from engaging in constitutionally protected\nspeech.” Ibid. “In order to maintain an appropriate bal\nance, we have vigorously enforced the requirement that a\nstatute’s overbreadth be substantial, not only in an abso\nlute sense, but also relative to the statute’s plainly legiti\nmate sweep.” Ibid.\n   In determining whether a statute’s overbreadth is sub\nstantial, we consider a statute’s application to real-world\nconduct, not fanciful hypotheticals. See, e.g., id., at 301–\n302; see also Ferber, supra, at 773; Houston v. Hill, 482\nU. S. 451, 466–467 (1987). Accordingly, we have repeat\nedly emphasized that an overbreadth claimant bears the\nburden of demonstrating, “from the text of [the law] and\nfrom actual fact,” that substantial overbreadth exists.\nVirginia v. Hicks, 539 U. S. 113, 122 (2003) (quoting New\nYork State Club Assn., supra, at 14; emphasis added;\ninternal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original).\nSimilarly, “there must be a realistic danger that the stat\nute itself will significantly compromise recognized First\nAmendment protections of parties not before the Court for\nit to be facially challenged on overbreadth grounds.”\nMembers of City Council of Los Angeles v.

Instead, the Court tacitly assumes for the sake of\nargument that §48 is valid as applied to these depictions,\nbut the Court concludes that §48 reaches too much pro\ntected speech to survive. The Court relies primarily on\ndepictions of hunters killing or wounding game and depic\ntions of animals being slaughtered for food. I address the\nCourt’s examples below.\n                                A\n   I turn first to depictions of hunting. As the Court notes,\nphotographs and videos of hunters shooting game are\ncommon. See ante, at 13–14. But hunting is legal in all\n50 States, and §48 applies only to a depiction of conduct\nthat is illegal in the jurisdiction in which the depiction is\ncreated, sold, or possessed. §§48(a), (c). Therefore, in all\n50 States, the creation, sale, or possession for sale of the\nvast majority of hunting depictions indisputably falls\noutside §48’s reach.\n   Straining to find overbreadth, the Court suggests that\n§48 prohibits the sale or possession in the District of Co\nlumbia of any depiction of hunting because the District—\nundoubtedly because of its urban character—does not\npermit hunting within its boundaries. Ante, at 13. The\nCourt also suggests that, because some States prohibit a\nparticular type of hunting (e.g., hunting with a crossbow\nor “canned” hunting) or the hunting of a particular animal\n(e.g., the “sharp-tailed grouse”), §48 makes it illegal for\npersons in such States to sell or possess for sale a depic\ntion of hunting that was perfectly legal in the State in\nwhich the hunting took place. See ante, at 12–14.\n   The Court’s interpretation is seriously flawed. “When a\nfederal court is dealing with a federal statute challenged\nas overbroad, it should, of course, construe the statute to\navoid constitutional problems, if the statute is subject to\nsuch a limiting construction.” Ferber, 458 U. S., at 769,\n6                   UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nn. 24. See also Williams, supra, at 307 (STEVENS, J.,\nconcurring) (“[T]o the extent the statutory text alone is\nunclear, our duty to avoid constitutional objections makes\nit especially appropriate to look beyond the text in order to\nascertain the intent of its drafters”).\n   Applying this canon, I would hold that §48 does not\napply to depictions of hunting. First, because §48 targets\ndepictions of “animal cruelty,” I would interpret that\nterm to apply only to depictions involving acts of animal\ncruelty as defined by applicable state or federal law, not\nto depictions of acts that happen to be illegal for reasons\nhaving nothing to do with the prevention of animal cru\nelty. See ante, at 12–13 (interpreting “[t]he text of §48(c)”\nto ban a depiction of “the humane slaughter of a stolen\ncow”). Virtually all state laws prohibiting animal cruelty\neither expressly define the term “animal” to exclude\nwildlife or else specifically exempt lawful hunting activi\nties,3 so the statutory prohibition set forth in §48(a) may\nreasonably be interpreted not to reach most if not all\nhunting depictions.\n   Second, even if the hunting of wild animals were other\nwise covered by §48(a), I would hold that hunting depic\ntions fall within the exception in §48(b) for depictions that\nhave “serious” (i.e., not “trifling”4) “scientific,” “educa\n——————\n   3 See Appendix, infra (citing statutes); B.

While there are certainly\nthose who find hunting objectionable, the predominant\nview in this country has long been that hunting serves\nmany important values, and it is clear that Congress\nshares that view. Since 1972, when Congress called upon\nthe President to designate a National Hunting and Fish\ning Day, see S. J. Res. 117, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. (1972), 86\nStat. 133, Presidents have regularly issued proclamations\nextolling the values served by hunting. See Presidential\nProclamation No. 8421, 74 Fed. Reg. 49305 (Pres. Obama\n2009) (hunting and fishing are “ageless pursuits” that\npromote “the conservation and restoration of numerous\nspecies and their natural habitats”); Presidential Procla\nmation No. 8295, 73 Fed. Reg. 57233 (Pres. Bush 2008)\n(hunters and anglers “add to our heritage and keep our\nwildlife populations healthy and strong,” and “are among\nour foremost conservationists”); Presidential Proclamation\nNo. 7822, 69 Fed. Reg. 59539 (Pres. Bush 2004) (hunting\nand fishing are “an important part of our Nation’s heri\ntage,” and “America’s hunters and anglers represent the\ngreat spirit of our country”); Presidential Proclamation No.\n4682, 44 Fed. Reg. 53149 (Pres. Carter 1979) (hunting\npromotes conservation and an appreciation of “healthy\nrecreation, peaceful solitude and closeness to nature”);\nPresidential Proclamation No. 4318, 39 Fed. Reg. 35315\n(Pres. Ford 1974) (hunting furthers “appreciation and\nrespect for nature” and preservation of the environment).\nThus, it is widely thought that hunting has “scientific”\nvalue in that it promotes conservation, “historical” value\nin that it provides a link to past times when hunting\nplayed a critical role in daily life, and “educational” value\nin that it furthers the understanding and appreciation of\nnature and our country’s past and instills valuable charac\nter traits. And if hunting itself is widely thought to serve\nthese values, then it takes but a small additional step to\nconclude that depictions of hunting make a non-trivial\n8               UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ncontribution to the exchange of ideas. Accordingly, I\nwould hold that hunting depictions fall comfortably within\nthe exception set out in §48(b).\n  I do not have the slightest doubt that Congress, in en\nacting §48, had no intention of restricting the creation,\nsale, or possession of depictions of hunting. Proponents of\nthe law made this point clearly. See H. R. Rep. No. 106–\n397, p. 8 (1999) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.) (“[D]epictions of\nordinary hunting and fishing activities do not fall within\nthe scope of the statute”); 145 Cong. Rec. 25894 (Oct. 19,\n1999) (Rep. McCollum) (“[T]he sale of depictions of legal\nactivities, such as hunting and fishing, would not be illegal\nunder this bill”); id., at 25895 (Rep. Smith) (“[L]et us be\nclear as to what this legislation will not do. It will in no\nway prohibit hunting, fishing, or wildlife videos”). Indeed,\neven opponents acknowledged that §48 was not intended\nto reach ordinary hunting depictions. See ibid. (Rep.\nScott); id., at 25897 (Rep. Paul).\n  For these reasons, I am convinced that §48 has no appli\ncation to depictions of hunting. But even if §48 did imper\nmissibly reach the sale or possession of depictions of hunt\ning in a few unusual situations (for example, the sale in\nOregon of a depiction of hunting with a crossbow in Vir\nginia or the sale in Washington State of the hunting of a\nsharp-tailed grouse in Idaho, see ante, at 14), those iso\nlated applications would hardly show that §48 bans a\nsubstantial amount of protected speech.\n                             B\n   Although the Court’s overbreadth analysis rests primar\nily on the proposition that §48 substantially restricts the\nsale and possession of hunting depictions, the Court cites\na few additional examples, including depictions of methods\nof slaughter and the docking of the tails of dairy cows. See\nante, at 14–15.\n   Such examples do not show that the statute is substan\n                   Cite as: 559 U.

First, as explained\nabove, §48 can reasonably be construed to apply only to\ndepictions involving acts of animal cruelty as defined by\napplicable state or federal law, and anti-cruelty laws do\nnot ban the sorts of acts depicted in the Court’s hypotheti\ncals. See, e.g., Idaho Code §25–3514 (Lexis 2000) (“No\npart of this chapter [prohibiting cruelty to animals] shall\nbe construed as interfering with or allowing interference\nwith . . . [t]he humane slaughter of any animal normally\nand commonly raised as food or for production of fiber . . .\n[or] [n]ormal or accepted practices of . . . animal hus\nbandry”); Kan. Stat. Ann. § 21–4310(b) (2007) (“The provi\nsions of this section shall not apply to . . . with respect to\nfarm animals, normal or accepted practices of animal\nhusbandry, including the normal and accepted practices\nfor the slaughter of such animals”); Md. Crim. Law Code\nAnn. §10–603 (Lexis 2002) (sections prohibiting animal\ncruelty “do not apply to . . . customary and normal veteri\nnary and agricultural husbandry practices, including\ndehorning, castration, tail docking, and limit feeding”).\n   Second, nothing in the record suggests that any one has\never created, sold, or possessed for sale a depiction of the\nslaughter of food animals or of the docking of the tails of\ndairy cows that would not easily qualify under the excep\ntion set out in §48(b). Depictions created to show proper\nmethods of slaughter or tail-docking would presumably\nhave serious “educational” value, and depictions created to\nfocus attention on methods thought to be inhumane or\notherwise objectionable would presumably have either\nserious “educational” or “journalistic” value or both. In\nshort, the Court’s examples of depictions involving the\ndocking of tails and humane slaughter do not show that\n§48 suffers from any overbreadth, much less substantial\noverbreadth.\n   The Court notes, finally, that cockfighting, which is\nillegal in all States, is still legal in Puerto Rico, ante, at 15,\n10                  UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nand I take the Court’s point to be that it would be imper\nmissible to ban the creation, sale, or possession in Puerto\nRico of a depiction of a cockfight that was legally staged in\nPuerto Rico.5 But assuming for the sake of argument that\nthis is correct, this veritable sliver of unconstitutionality\nwould not be enough to justify striking down §48 in toto.\n   In sum, we have a duty to interpret §48 so as to avoid\nserious constitutional concerns, and §48 may reasonably\nbe construed not to reach almost all, if not all, of the depic\ntions that the Court finds constitutionally protected.\nThus, §48 does not appear to have a large number of un\nconstitutional applications. Invalidation for overbreadth\nis appropriate only if the challenged statute suffers from\nsubstantial overbreadth—judged not just in absolute\nterms, but in relation to the statute’s “plainly legitimate\nsweep.” Williams, 553 U. S., at 292.

But before the enactment of\n§48, the underlying conduct depicted in crush videos was\nnearly impossible to prosecute. These videos, which “ often\nappeal to persons with a very specific sexual fetish,” id., at\n2, were made in secret, generally without a live audience,\nand “the faces of the women inflicting the torture in the\nmaterial often were not shown, nor could the location of\nthe place where the cruelty was being inflicted or the date\nof the activity be ascertained from the depiction.” Id., at 3.\nThus, law enforcement authorities often were not able to\nidentify the parties responsible for the torture. See Pun\nishing Depictions of Animal Cruelty and the Federal\nPrisoner Health Care Co-Payment Act of 1999: Hearing\nbefore the Subcommittee on Crime of the House Commit\ntee on the Judiciary, 106th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 1 (1999)\n(hereinafter Hearing on Depictions of Animal Cruelty). In\nthe rare instances in which it was possible to identify and\nfind the perpetrators, they “often were able to successfully\nassert as a defense that the State could not prove its\njurisdiction over the place where the act occurred or that\nthe actions depicted took place within the time specified in\n12              UNITED STATES v.

And Congress’ strategy appears to have been\nvindicated. We are told that “[b]y 2007, sponsors of §48\ndeclared the crush video industry dead. Even overseas\nWebsites shut down in the wake of §48.

S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthat the only way of preventing these crimes was to target\nthe sale of the videos. Under these circumstances, I can\nnot believe that the First Amendment commands Con\ngress to step aside and allow the underlying crimes to\ncontinue.\n   The most relevant of our prior decisions is Ferber, 458\nU. S. 747, which concerned child pornography. The Court\nthere held that child pornography is not protected speech,\nand I believe that Ferber’s reasoning dictates a similar\nconclusion here.\n   In Ferber, an important factor—I would say the most\nimportant factor—was that child pornography involves the\ncommission of a crime that inflicts severe personal injury\nto the “children who are made to engage in sexual conduct\nfor commercial purposes.’ ” Id., at 753 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The Ferber Court repeatedly described\nthe production of child pornography as child “abuse,”\n“molestation,” or “exploitation.” See, e.g., id., at 749 (“In\nrecent years, the exploitive use of children in the produc\ntion of pornography has become a serious national prob\nlem”); id., at 758, n. 9 (“Sexual molestation by adults is\noften involved in the production of child sexual perform\nances”). As later noted in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coali\ntion, 535 U. S. 234, 249 (2002), in Ferber “[t]he production\nof the work, not its content, was the target of the statute.”\nSee also 535 U.S., at 250 (Ferber involved “speech that\nitself is the record of sexual abuse”).\n   Second, Ferber emphasized the fact that these underly\ning crimes could not be effectively combated without tar\ngeting the distribution of child pornography. As the Court\nput it, “the distribution network for child pornography\nmust be closed if the production of material which requires\nthe sexual exploitation of children is to be effectively\ncontrolled.” 458 U. S., at 759. The Court added:\n    “[T]here is no serious contention that the legislature\n14               UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n     was unjustified in believing that it is difficult, if not\n     impossible, to halt the exploitation of children by pur\n     suing only those who produce the photographs and\n     movies. . . . The most expeditious if not the only prac\n     tical method of law enforcement may be to dry up the\n     market for this material by imposing severe criminal\n     penalties on persons selling, advertising, or otherwise\n     promoting the product.” Id., at 759–760.\nSee also id., at 761 (“The advertising and selling of child\npornography provide an economic motive for and are thus\nan integral part of the production of such materials”).\n   Third, the Ferber Court noted that the value of child\npornography “is exceedingly modest, if not de minimis,”\nand that any such value was “overwhelmingly out\nweigh[ed]” by “the evil to be restricted.” Id., at 762–763.\n   All three of these characteristics are shared by §48, as\napplied to crush videos. First, the conduct depicted in\ncrush videos is criminal in every State and the District of\nColumbia. Thus, any crush video made in this country\nrecords the actual commission of a criminal act that in\nflicts severe physical injury and excruciating pain and\nultimately results in death. Those who record the under\nlying criminal acts are likely to be criminally culpable,\neither as aiders and abettors or conspirators. And in the\ntight and secretive market for these videos, some who sell\nthe videos or possess them with the intent to make a profit\nmay be similarly culpable. (For example, in some cases,\ncrush videos were commissioned by purchasers who speci\nfied the details of the acts that they wanted to see per\nformed. See H. R. Rep., at 3; Hearing on Depictions of\nAnimal Cruelty 27). To the extent that §48 reaches such\npersons, it surely does not violate the First Amendment.\n   Second, the criminal acts shown in crush videos cannot\nbe prevented without targeting the conduct prohibited by\n§48—the creation, sale, and possession for sale of depic\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          15\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ntions of animal torture with the intention of realizing a\ncommercial profit. The evidence presented to Congress\nposed a stark choice: Either ban the commercial exploita\ntion of crush videos or tolerate a continuation of the crimi\nnal acts that they record. Faced with this evidence, Con\ngress reasonably chose to target the lucrative crush video\nmarket.\n   Finally, the harm caused by the underlying crimes\nvastly outweighs any minimal value that the depictions\nmight conceivably be thought to possess. Section 48\nreaches only the actual recording of acts of animal torture;\nthe statute does not apply to verbal descriptions or to\nsimulations. And, unlike the child pornography statute in\nFerber or its federal counterpart, 18 U. S. C. §2252, §48(b)\nprovides an exception for depictions having any “serious\nreligious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic,\nhistorical, or artistic value.”\n   It must be acknowledged that §48 differs from a child\npornography law in an important respect: preventing the\nabuse of children is certainly much more important than\npreventing the torture of the animals used in crush videos.\nIt was largely for this reason that the Court of Appeals\nconcluded that Ferber did not support the constitutionality\nof §48. 533 F. 3d, at 228 (“Preventing cruelty to animals,\nalthough an exceedingly worthy goal, simply does not\nimplicate interests of the same magnitude as protecting\nchildren from physical and psychological harm”). But\nwhile protecting children is unquestionably more impor\ntant than protecting animals, the Government also has a\ncompelling interest in preventing the torture depicted in\ncrush videos.\n   The animals used in crush videos are living creatures\nthat experience excruciating pain. Our society has long\nbanned such cruelty, which is illegal throughout the coun\ntry. In Ferber, the Court noted that “virtually all of the\nStates and the United States have passed legislation\n16                  UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nproscribing the production of or otherwise combating ‘child\npornography,’ ” and the Court declined to “second-guess\n[that] legislative judgment.”6 458 U. S., at 758. Here,\nlikewise, the Court of Appeals erred in second-guessing\nthe legislative judgment about the importance of prevent\ning cruelty to animals.\n   Section 48’s ban on trafficking in crush videos also helps\nto enforce the criminal laws and to ensure that criminals\ndo not profit from their crimes. See 145 Cong. Rec. 25897\n(Oct. 19, 1999) (Rep. Gallegly) (“The state has an interest\nin enforcing its existing laws. Right now, the laws are not\nonly being violated, but people are making huge profits\nfrom promoting the violations”); id., at 10685 (May 24,\n1999) (Rep. Gallegly) (explaining that he introduced the\nHouse version of the bill because “criminals should not\nprofit from [their] illegal acts”). We have already judged\nthat taking the profit out of crime is a compelling interest.\nSee Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State\nCrime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 119 (1991).\n   In short, Ferber is the case that sheds the most light on\nthe constitutionality of Congress’ effort to halt the produc\ntion of crush videos. Applying the principles set forth in\nFerber, I would hold that crush videos are not protected by\nthe First Amendment.\n                               B\n     Application of the Ferber framework also supports the\n——————\n   6 In other cases, we have regarded evidence of a national consensus as\n\nproof that a particular government interest is compelling. See Simon &\nSchuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S.\n105, 118 (1991) (State’s compelling interest “in ensuring that victims of\ncrime are compensated by those who harm them” evidenced by fact that\n“[e]very State has a body of tort law serving exactly this interest”);\nRoberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 624–625 (1984) (citing\nstate laws prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations as\nevidence of the compelling governmental interest in ensuring equal\naccess).\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nconstitutionality of §48 as applied to depictions of brutal\nanimal fights. (For convenience, I will focus on videos of\ndogfights, which appear to be the most common type of\nanimal fight videos.)\n   First, such depictions, like crush videos, record the\nactual commission of a crime involving deadly violence.\nDogfights are illegal in every State and the District of\nColumbia, Brief for United States 26–27, and n. 8 (citing\nstatutes), and under federal law constitute a felony pun\nishable by imprisonment for up to five years, 7 U. S. C.\n§2156 et seq. (2006 ed. and Supp. II), 18 U. S. C. §49 (2006\ned., Supp. II).\n   Second, Congress had an ample basis for concluding\nthat the crimes depicted in these videos cannot be effec\ntively controlled without targeting the videos. Like crush\nvideos and child pornography, dogfight videos are very\noften produced as part of a “low-profile, clandestine indus\ntry,” and “the need to market the resulting products re\nquires a visible apparatus of distribution.” Ferber, 458\nU. S., at 760. In such circumstances, Congress had rea\nsonable grounds for concluding that it would be “difficult,\nif not impossible, to halt” the underlying exploitation of\ndogs by pursuing only those who stage the fights. Id., at\n759–760; see 533 F. 3d, at 246 (Cowen, J., dissenting)\n(citing evidence establishing “the existence of a lucrative\nmarket for depictions of animal cruelty,” including videos\nof dogfights, “which in turn provides a powerful incentive\nto individuals to create [such] videos”).\n   The commercial trade in videos of dogfights is “an inte\ngral part of the production of such materials,” Ferber,\nsupra, at 761.       As the Humane Society explains,\n“[v]ideotapes memorializing dogfights are integral to the\nsuccess of this criminal industry” for a variety of reasons.\nHumane Society Brief 5. For one thing, some dogfighting\nvideos are made “solely for the purpose of selling the video\n(and not for a live audience).” Id., at 9. In addition, those\n18               UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwho stage dogfights profit not just from the sale of the\nvideos themselves, but from the gambling revenue they\ntake in from the fights; the videos “encourage [such] gam\nbling activity because they allow those reluctant to attend\nactual fights for fear of prosecution to still bet on the\noutcome.” Ibid.; accord, Brief for Center on the Admini\nstration of Criminal Law as Amicus Curiae 12 (“Selling\nvideos of dogfights effectively abets the underlying crimes\nby providing a market for dogfighting while allowing\nactual dogfights to remain underground”); ibid. (“These\nvideos are part of a ‘lucrative market’ where videos are\nproduced by a ‘bare-boned, clandestine staff’ in order to\npermit the actual location of dogfights and the perpetra\ntors of these underlying criminal activities to go unde\ntected” (citations omitted)). Moreover, “[v]ideo documen\ntation is vital to the criminal enterprise because it\nprovides proof of a dog’s fighting prowess—proof de\nmanded by potential buyers and critical to the under\nground market.” Humane Society Brief 9. Such re\ncordings may also serve as “ ‘training’ videos for other fight\norganizers.” Ibid. In short, because videos depicting live\ndogfights are essential to the success of the criminal dog\nfighting subculture, the commercial sale of such videos\nhelps to fuel the market for, and thus to perpetuate the\nperpetration of, the criminal conduct depicted in them.\n   Third, depictions of dogfights that fall within §48’s reach\nhave by definition no appreciable social value. As noted,\n§48(b) exempts depictions having any appreciable social\nvalue, and thus the mere inclusion of a depiction of a live\nfight in a larger work that aims at communicating an idea\nor a message with a modicum of social value would not run\nafoul of the statute.\n   Finally, the harm caused by the underlying criminal\nacts greatly outweighs any trifling value that the depic\ntions might be thought to possess. As the Humane Society\nexplains:\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n    “The abused dogs used in fights endure physical tor\n    ture and emotional manipulation throughout their\n    lives to predispose them to violence; common tactics\n    include feeding the animals hot peppers and gunpow\n    der, prodding them with sticks, and electrocution.\n    Dogs are conditioned never to give up a fight, even if\n    they will be gravely hurt or killed. As a result, dog\n    fights inflict horrific injuries on the participating\n    animals, including lacerations, ripped ears, puncture\n    wounds and broken bones. Losing dogs are routinely\n    refused treatment, beaten further as ‘punishment’ for\n    the loss, and executed by drowning, hanging, or incin\n    eration.” Id., at 5–6 (footnotes omitted).\n   For these dogs, unlike the animals killed in crush vid\neos, the suffering lasts for years rather than minutes. As\nwith crush videos, moreover, the statutory ban on com\nmerce in dogfighting videos is also supported by compel\nling governmental interests in effectively enforcing the\nNation’s criminal laws and preventing criminals from\nprofiting from their illegal activities. See Ferber, supra, at\n757–758; Simon & Schuster, 502 U. S., at 119.\n   In sum, §48 may validly be applied to at least two broad\nreal-world categories of expression covered by the statute:\ncrush videos and dogfighting videos. Thus, the statute has\na substantial core of constitutionally permissible applica\ntions. Moreover, for the reasons set forth above, the re\ncord does not show that §48, properly interpreted, bans a\nsubstantial amount of protected speech in absolute terms.\nA fortiori, respondent has not met his burden of demon\nstrating that any impermissible applications of the statute\nare “substantial” in relation to its “plainly legitimate\nsweep.” Williams, 553 U. S., at 292. Accordingly, I would\nreject respondent’s claim that §48 is facially unconstitu\ntional under the overbreadth doctrine.\n20                 UNITED STATES v.

STEVENS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 08–769.     Argued October 6, 2009—Decided April 20, 2010\nCongress enacted 18 U. S. C. §48 to criminalize the commercial crea\n  tion, sale, or possession of certain depictions of animal cruelty. The\n  statute addresses only portrayals of harmful acts, not the underlying\n  conduct. It applies to any visual or auditory depiction “in which a liv\n  ing animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded, or\n  killed,” if that conduct violates federal or state law where “the crea\n  tion, sale, or possession takes place,” §48(c)(1). Another clause ex\n  empts depictions with “serious religious, political, scientific, educa\n  tional, journalistic, historical, or artistic value.”     §48(b).  The\n  legislative background of §48 focused primarily on “crush videos,”\n  which feature the torture and killing of helpless animals and are said\n  to appeal to persons with a specific sexual fetish. Respondent Ste\n  vens was indicted under §48 for selling videos depicting dogfighting.\n  He moved to dismiss, arguing that §48 is facially invalid under the\n  First Amendment. The District Court denied his motion, and Ste\n  vens was convicted. The Third Circuit vacated the conviction and de\n  clared §48 facially unconstitutional as a content-based regulation of\n  protected speech.\nHeld: Section §48 is substantially overbroad, and therefore invalid un\n der the First Amendment. Pp. 5–20.\n    (a) Depictions of animal cruelty are not, as a class, categorically\n unprotected by the First Amendment. Because §48 explicitly regu\n lates expression based on content, it is “ ‘presumptively invalid,’ . . .\n and the Government bears the burden to rebut that presumption.”\n United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803,\n 817. Since its enactment, the First Amendment has permitted re\n strictions on a few historic categories of speech—including obscenity,\n defamation, fraud, incitement, and speech integral to criminal con\n2                     UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    duct—that “have never been thought to raise any Constitutional\n    problem,” Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568, 572. Depic\n    tions of animal cruelty should not be added to that list. While the\n    prohibition of animal cruelty has a long history in American law,\n    there is no evidence of a similar tradition prohibiting depictions of\n    such cruelty. The Government’s proposed test would broadly balance\n    the value of the speech against its societal costs to determine\n    whether the First Amendment even applies. But the First Amend\n    ment’s free speech guarantee does not extend only to categories of\n    speech that survive an ad hoc balancing of relative social costs and\n    benefits. The Amendment itself reflects a judgment by the American\n    people that the benefits of its restrictions on the Government out\n    weigh the costs. New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, distinguished.\n    Pp. 5–9.\n       (b) Stevens’s facial challenge succeeds under existing doctrine.\n    Pp. 9–20.\n         (1) In the First Amendment context, a law may be invalidated as\n    overbroad if “a ‘substantial number’ of its applications are unconsti\n    tutional, ‘ “judged in relation to the statute’s plainly legitimate\n    sweep.” ’ ” Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican\n    Party, 552 U. S. 442, 449, n. 6. Stevens claims that common depic\n    tions of ordinary and lawful activities constitute the vast majority of\n    materials subject to §48. The Government does not defend such ap\n    plications, but contends that the statute is narrowly limited to spe\n    cific types of extreme material. Section 48’s constitutionality thus\n    turns on how broadly it is construed. Pp. 9–10.\n         (2) Section 48 creates a criminal prohibition of alarming breadth.\n    The statute’s definition of a “depiction of animal cruelty” does not\n    even require that the depicted conduct be cruel. While the words\n    “maimed, mutilated, [and] tortured” convey cruelty, “wounded” and\n    “killed” do not. Those words have little ambiguity and should be read\n    according to their ordinary meaning. Section 48 does require that the\n    depicted conduct be “illegal,” but many federal and state laws con\n    cerning the proper treatment of animals are not designed to guard\n    against animal cruelty. For example, endangered species protections\n    restrict even the humane wounding or killing of animals. The statute\n    draws no distinction based on the reason the conduct is made illegal.\n         Moreover, §48 applies to any depiction of conduct that is illegal\n    in the State in which the depiction is created, sold, or possessed, “re\n    gardless of whether the . . . wounding . . . or killing took place” there,\n    §48(c)(1). Depictions of entirely lawful conduct may run afoul of the\n    ban if those depictions later find their way into States where the\n    same conduct is unlawful. This greatly expands §48’s scope, because\n    views about animal cruelty and regulations having no connection to\n                   Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ncruelty vary widely from place to place. Hunting is unlawful in the\nDistrict of Columbia, for example, but there is an enormous national\nmarket for hunting-related depictions, greatly exceeding the demand\nfor crush videos or animal fighting depictions. Because the statute\nallows each jurisdiction to export its laws to the rest of the country,\n§48(a) applies to any magazine or video depicting lawful hunting that\nis sold in the Nation’s Capital. Those seeking to comply with the law\nface a bewildering maze of regulations from at least 56 separate ju\nrisdictions. Pp. 11–15.\n     (3) Limiting §48’s reach to crush videos and depictions of animal\nfighting or other extreme cruelty, as the Government suggests, re\nquires an unrealistically broad reading of the statute’s exceptions\nclause. The statute only exempts material with “serious” value, and\n“serious” must be taken seriously. The excepted speech must also fall\nwithin one of §48(b)’s enumerated categories. Much speech does not.\nFor example, most hunting depictions are not obviously instructional\nin nature. The exceptions clause simply has no adequate reading\nthat results in the statute’s banning only the depictions the Govern\nment would like to ban.\n     Although the language of §48(b) is drawn from the Court’s deci\nsion in Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, the exceptions clause does\nnot answer every First Amendment objection. Under Miller, “seri\nous” value shields depictions of sex from regulation as obscenity. But\nMiller did not determine that serious value could be used as a gen\neral precondition to protecting other types of speech in the first place.\nEven “ ‘wholly neutral futilities . . . come under the protection of free\nspeech.’ ” Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15, 25. The First Amend\nment presumptively extends to many forms of speech that do not\nqualify for §48(b)’s serious-value exception, but nonetheless fall\nwithin §48(c)’s broad reach. Pp. 15–17.\n     (4) Despite the Government’s assurance that it will apply §48 to\nreach only “extreme” cruelty, this Court will not uphold an unconsti\ntutional statute merely because the Government promises to use it\nresponsibly. Nor can the Court construe this statutory language to\navoid constitutional doubt. A limiting construction can be imposed\nonly if the statute “is ‘readily susceptible’ to such a construction,”\nReno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 884. To read\n§48 as the Government desires requires rewriting, not just reinter\npretation. Pp. 18–19.\n     (5) This construction of §48 decides the constitutional question.\nThe Government makes no effort to defend §48 as applied beyond\ncrush videos and depictions of animal fighting. It argues that those\nparticular depictions are intrinsically related to criminal conduct or\nare analogous to obscenity (if not themselves obscene), and that the\n4                    UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    ban on such speech would satisfy the proper level of scrutiny. But\n    the Government nowhere extends these arguments to other depic\n    tions, such as hunting magazines and videos, that are presumptively\n    protected by the First Amendment but that remain subject to §48.\n    Nor does the Government seriously contest that these presumptively\n    impermissible applications of §48 far outnumber any permissible\n    ones. The Court therefore does not decide whether a statute limited\n    to crush videos or other depictions of extreme animal cruelty would\n    be constitutional. Section 48 is not so limited but is instead substan\n    tially overbroad, and therefore invalid under the First Amendment.\n    Pp. 19–20.\n533 F. 3d 218, affirmed.\n\n   ROBERTS, C.

ROBERT J. \n\n                    STEVENS \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [April 20, 2010] \n\n\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n   Congress enacted 18 U. S. C. §48 to criminalize the\ncommercial creation, sale, or possession of certain depic\ntions of animal cruelty. The statute does not address\nunderlying acts harmful to animals, but only portrayals of\nsuch conduct. The question presented is whether the\nprohibition in the statute is consistent with the freedom of\nspeech guaranteed by the First Amendment.\n                            I\n  Section 48 establishes a criminal penalty of up to five\nyears in prison for anyone who knowingly “creates, sells,\nor possesses a depiction of animal cruelty,” if done “for\ncommercial gain” in interstate or foreign commerce.\n§48(a).1 A depiction of “animal cruelty” is defined as one\n——————\n  1 The  statute reads in full:\n  “§48. Depiction of animal cruelty\n     “(a) CREATION, SALE, OR POSSESSION.—Whoever knowingly creates,\nsells, or possesses a depiction of animal cruelty with the intention of\nplacing that depiction in interstate or foreign commerce for commercial\ngain, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5\n2                    UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n“in which a living animal is intentionally maimed, muti\nlated, tortured, wounded, or killed,” if that conduct vio\nlates federal or state law where “the creation, sale, or\npossession takes place.” §48(c)(1). In what is referred to\nas the “exceptions clause,” the law exempts from prohibi\ntion any depiction “that has serious religious, political,\nscientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic\nvalue.” §48(b).\n   The legislative background of §48 focused primarily on\nthe interstate market for “crush videos.” According to the\nHouse Committee Report on the bill, such videos feature\nthe intentional torture and killing of helpless animals,\nincluding cats, dogs, monkeys, mice, and hamsters. H. R.\nRep. No. 106–397, p. 2 (1999) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.).\nCrush videos often depict women slowly crushing animals\nto death “with their bare feet or while wearing high heeled\nshoes,” sometimes while “talking to the animals in a kind\nof dominatrix patter” over “[t]he cries and squeals of the\nanimals, obviously in great pain.” Ibid. Apparently these\ndepictions “appeal to persons with a very specific sexual\n——————\nyears, or both.\n     “(b) EXCEPTION.—Subsection (a) does not apply to any depiction\nthat has serious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic,\nhistorical, or artistic value.\n     “(c) DEFINITIONS.—In this section—\n        “(1) the term ‘depiction of animal cruelty’ means any visual or\nauditory depiction, including any photograph, motion-picture film,\nvideo recording, electronic image, or sound recording of conduct in\nwhich a living animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tortured,\nwounded, or killed, if such conduct is illegal under Federal law or the\nlaw of the State in which the creation, sale, or possession takes place,\nregardless of whether the maiming, mutilation, torture, wounding, or\nkilling took place in the State; and\n        “(2) the term ‘State’ means each of the several States, the Dis\ntrict of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Is\nlands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern\nMariana Islands, and any other commonwealth, territory, or possession\nof the United States.”\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

The acts depicted in crush videos are\ntypically prohibited by the animal cruelty laws enacted by\nall 50 States and the District of Columbia. See Brief for\nUnited States 25, n. 7 (listing statutes). But crush videos\nrarely disclose the participants’ identities, inhibiting\nprosecution of the underlying conduct. See H. R. Rep., at\n3; accord, Brief for State of Florida et al. as Amici Curiae\n11.\n   This case, however, involves an application of §48 to\ndepictions of animal fighting. Dogfighting, for example, is\nunlawful in all 50 States and the District of Columbia, see\nBrief for United States 26, n. 8 (listing statutes), and has\nbeen restricted by federal law since 1976. Animal Welfare\nAct Amendments of 1976, §17, 90 Stat. 421, 7 U. S. C.\n§2156. Respondent Robert J. Stevens ran a business,\n“Dogs of Velvet and Steel,” and an associated Web site,\nthrough which he sold videos of pit bulls engaging in\ndogfights and attacking other animals. Among these\nvideos were Japan Pit Fights and Pick-A-Winna: A Pit\nBull Documentary, which include contemporary footage of\ndogfights in Japan (where such conduct is allegedly legal)\nas well as footage of American dogfights from the 1960’s\nand 1970’s.2 A third video, Catch Dogs and Country Liv\ning, depicts the use of pit bulls to hunt wild boar, as well\nas a “gruesome” scene of a pit bull attacking a domestic\nfarm pig. 533 F. 3d 218, 221 (CA3 2008) (en banc). On the\nbasis of these videos, Stevens was indicted on three counts\nof violating §48.\n   Stevens moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that\n§48 is facially invalid under the First Amendment. The\n\n——————\n  2 TheGovernment contends that these dogfights were unlawful at the\ntime they occurred, while Stevens disputes the assertion.

STEVENS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nDistrict Court denied the motion. It held that the depic\ntions subject to §48, like obscenity or child pornography,\nare categorically unprotected by the First Amendment.\n2:04–cr–00051–ANB (WD Pa., Nov. 10, 2004), App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 65a–71a. It went on to hold that §48 is not sub\nstantially overbroad, because the exceptions clause suffi\nciently narrows the statute to constitutional applications.\nId., at 71a–75a. The jury convicted Stevens on all counts,\nand the District Court sentenced him to three concurrent\nsentences of 37 months’ imprisonment, followed by three\nyears of supervised release. App. 37.\n   The en banc Third Circuit, over a three-judge dissent,\ndeclared §48 facially unconstitutional and vacated Ste\nvens’s conviction. 533 F. 3d 218. The Court of Appeals\nfirst held that §48 regulates speech that is protected by\nthe First Amendment. The Court declined to recognize a\nnew category of unprotected speech for depictions of ani\nmal cruelty, id., at 224, and n. 6, and rejected the Gov\nernment’s analogy between animal cruelty depictions and\nchild pornography, id., at 224–232.\n   The Court of Appeals then held that §48 could not sur\nvive strict scrutiny as a content-based regulation of pro\ntected speech. Id., at 232. It found that the statute lacked\na compelling government interest and was neither nar\nrowly tailored to preventing animal cruelty nor the least\nrestrictive means of doing so. Id., at 232–235. It therefore\nheld §48 facially invalid.\n   In an extended footnote, the Third Circuit noted that\n§48 “might also be unconstitutionally overbroad,” because\nit “potentially covers a great deal of constitutionally pro\ntected speech” and “sweeps [too] widely” to be limited only\nby prosecutorial discretion. Id., at 235, n. 16. But the\nCourt of Appeals declined to rest its analysis on this\nground.\n   We granted certiorari. 556 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

We\ndisagree.\n   The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall\nmake no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.” “[A]s a\ngeneral matter, the First Amendment means that gov\nernment has no power to restrict expression because of its\nmessage, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.”\nAshcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 535 U. S. 564,\n573 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). Section 48\nexplicitly regulates expression based on content: The\nstatute restricts “visual [and] auditory depiction[s],” such\nas photographs, videos, or sound recordings, depending on\nwhether they depict conduct in which a living animal is\nintentionally harmed. As such, §48 is “ ‘presumptively\ninvalid,’ and the Government bears the burden to rebut\nthat presumption.” United States v. Playboy Entertain\nment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 817 (2000) (quoting\nR. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 382 (1992); citation\nomitted).\n   “From 1791 to the present,” however, the First Amend\nment has “permitted restrictions upon the content of\nspeech in a few limited areas,” and has never “include[d] a\nfreedom to disregard these traditional limitations.” Id., at\n382–383. These “historic and traditional categories long\nfamiliar to the bar,” Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of\nN. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 127 (1991)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment)—including obscen\nity, Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476, 483 (1957), defa\nmation, Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U. S. 250, 254–255\n(1952), fraud, Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citi\nzens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 771 (1976),\nincitement, Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444, 447–449\n6               UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(1969) (per curiam), and speech integral to criminal con\nduct, Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., 336 U. S. 490,\n498 (1949)—are “well-defined and narrowly limited classes\nof speech, the prevention and punishment of which have\nnever been thought to raise any Constitutional problem.”\nChaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568, 571–572\n(1942).\n   The Government argues that “depictions of animal\ncruelty” should be added to the list. It contends that\ndepictions of “illegal acts of animal cruelty” that are\n“made, sold, or possessed for commercial gain” necessarily\n“lack expressive value,” and may accordingly “be regulated\nas unprotected speech.” Brief for United States 10 (em\nphasis added). The claim is not just that Congress may\nregulate depictions of animal cruelty subject to the First\nAmendment, but that these depictions are outside the\nreach of that Amendment altogether—that they fall into a\n“ ‘First Amendment Free Zone.’ ”          Board of Airport\nComm’rs of Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus, Inc., 482 U. S.\n569, 574 (1987).\n   As the Government notes, the prohibition of animal\ncruelty itself has a long history in American law, starting\nwith the early settlement of the Colonies. Reply Brief 12,\nn. 8; see, e.g., The Body of Liberties §92 (Mass. Bay Colony\n1641), reprinted in American Historical Documents 1000–\n1904, 43 Harvard Classics 66, 79 (C. Eliot ed. 1910) (“No\nman shall exercise any Tirranny or Crueltie towards any\nbruite Creature which are usuallie kept for man’s use”).\nBut we are unaware of any similar tradition excluding\ndepictions of animal cruelty from “the freedom of speech”\ncodified in the First Amendment, and the Government\npoints us to none.\n   The Government contends that “historical evidence”\nabout the reach of the First Amendment is not “a neces\nsary prerequisite for regulation today,” Reply Brief 12,\nn. 8, and that categories of speech may be exempted from\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe First Amendment’s protection without any long-settled\ntradition of subjecting that speech to regulation. Instead,\nthe Government points to Congress’s “ ‘legislative judg\nment that . . . depictions of animals being intentionally\ntortured and killed [are] of such minimal redeeming value\nas to render [them] unworthy of First Amendment protec\ntion,’ ” Brief for United States 23 (quoting 533 F. 3d, at 243\n(Cowen, J., dissenting)), and asks the Court to uphold the\nban on the same basis. The Government thus proposes\nthat a claim of categorical exclusion should be considered\nunder a simple balancing test: “Whether a given category\nof speech enjoys First Amendment protection depends\nupon a categorical balancing of the value of the speech\nagainst its societal costs.” Brief for United States 8; see\nalso id., at 12.\n   As a free-floating test for First Amendment coverage,\nthat sentence is startling and dangerous. The First\nAmendment’s guarantee of free speech does not extend\nonly to categories of speech that survive an ad hoc balanc\ning of relative social costs and benefits.         The First\nAmendment itself reflects a judgment by the American\npeople that the benefits of its restrictions on the Govern\nment outweigh the costs. Our Constitution forecloses any\nattempt to revise that judgment simply on the basis that\nsome speech is not worth it. The Constitution is not a\ndocument “prescribing limits, and declaring that those\nlimits may be passed at pleasure.” Marbury v. Madison, 1\nCranch 137, 178 (1803).\n   To be fair to the Government, its view did not emerge\nfrom a vacuum. As the Government correctly notes, this\nCourt has often described historically unprotected catego\nries of speech as being “ ‘of such slight social value as a\nstep to truth that any benefit that may be derived from\nthem is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order\nand morality.’ ” R. A. V., supra, at 383 (quoting Chap\nlinsky, supra, at 572). In New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S.\n8               UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n747 (1982), we noted that within these categories of unpro\ntected speech, “the evil to be restricted so overwhelmingly\noutweighs the expressive interests, if any, at stake, that\nno process of case-by-case adjudication is required,” be\ncause “the balance of competing interests is clearly\nstruck,” id., at 763–764. The Government derives its\nproposed test from these descriptions in our precedents.\nSee Brief for United States 12–13.\n  But such descriptions are just that—descriptive. They\ndo not set forth a test that may be applied as a general\nmatter to permit the Government to imprison any speaker\nso long as his speech is deemed valueless or unnecessary,\nor so long as an ad hoc calculus of costs and benefits tilts\nin a statute’s favor.\n  When we have identified categories of speech as fully\noutside the protection of the First Amendment, it has not\nbeen on the basis of a simple cost-benefit analysis. In\nFerber, for example, we classified child pornography as\nsuch a category, 458 U. S., at 763. We noted that the\nState of New York had a compelling interest in protecting\nchildren from abuse, and that the value of using children\nin these works (as opposed to simulated conduct or adult\nactors) was de minimis. Id., at 756–757, 762. But our\ndecision did not rest on this “balance of competing inter\nests” alone. Id., at 764. We made clear that Ferber pre\nsented a special case: The market for child pornography\nwas “intrinsically related” to the underlying abuse, and\nwas therefore “an integral part of the production of such\nmaterials, an activity illegal throughout the Nation.” Id.,\nat 759, 761. As we noted, “ ‘[i]t rarely has been suggested\nthat the constitutional freedom for speech and press ex\ntends its immunity to speech or writing used as an inte\ngral part of conduct in violation of a valid criminal stat\nute.’ ” Id., at 761–762 (quoting Giboney, supra, at 498).\nFerber thus grounded its analysis in a previously recog\nnized, long-established category of unprotected speech,\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand our subsequent decisions have shared this under\nstanding. See Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U. S. 103, 110 (1990)\n(describing Ferber as finding “persuasive” the argument\nthat the advertising and sale of child pornography was “an\nintegral part” of its unlawful production (internal quota\ntion marks omitted)); Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition,\n535 U. S. 234, 249–250 (2002) (noting that distribution\nand sale “were intrinsically related to the sexual abuse of\nchildren,” giving the speech at issue “a proximate link to\nthe crime from which it came” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n   Our decisions in Ferber and other cases cannot be taken\nas establishing a freewheeling authority to declare new\ncategories of speech outside the scope of the First Amend\nment. Maybe there are some categories of speech that\nhave been historically unprotected, but have not yet been\nspecifically identified or discussed as such in our case law.\nBut if so, there is no evidence that “depictions of animal\ncruelty” is among them. We need not foreclose the future\nrecognition of such additional categories to reject the\nGovernment’s highly manipulable balancing test as a\nmeans of identifying them.\n                           III\n  Because we decline to carve out from the First Amend\nment any novel exception for §48, we review Stevens’s\nFirst Amendment challenge under our existing doctrine.\n                               A\n   Stevens challenged §48 on its face, arguing that any\nconviction secured under the statute would be unconstitu\ntional. The court below decided the case on that basis, 533\nF. 3d, at 231, n. 13, and we granted the Solicitor General’s\npetition for certiorari to determine “whether 18 U. S. C. 48\nis facially invalid under the Free Speech Clause of the\nFirst Amendment,” Pet. for Cert. i.\n10                  UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   To succeed in a typical facial attack, Stevens would have\nto establish “that no set of circumstances exists under\nwhich [§48] would be valid,” United States v. Salerno, 481\nU. S. 739, 745 (1987), or that the statute lacks any “plainly\nlegitimate sweep,” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S.\n702, 740, n. 7 (1997) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judg\nments) (internal quotation marks omitted). Which stan\ndard applies in a typical case is a matter of dispute that\nwe need not and do not address, and neither Salerno nor\nGlucksberg is a speech case. Here the Government asserts\nthat Stevens cannot prevail because §48 is plainly legiti\nmate as applied to crush videos and animal fighting depic\ntions. Deciding this case through a traditional facial\nanalysis would require us to resolve whether these appli\ncations of §48 are in fact consistent with the Constitution.\n   In the First Amendment context, however, this Court\nrecognizes “a second type of facial challenge,” whereby a\nlaw may be invalidated as overbroad if “a substantial\nnumber of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in\nrelation to the statute’s plainly legitimate sweep.” Wash\nington State Grange v. Washington State Republican\nParty, 552 U. S. 442, 449, n. 6 (2008) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Stevens argues that §48 applies to com\nmon depictions of ordinary and lawful activities, and that\nthese depictions constitute the vast majority of materials\nsubject to the statute. Brief for Respondent 22–25. The\nGovernment makes no effort to defend such a broad ban as\nconstitutional. Instead, the Government’s entire defense\nof §48 rests on interpreting the statute as narrowly lim\nited to specific types of “extreme” material. Brief for\nUnited States 8. As the parties have presented the issue,\ntherefore, the constitutionality of §48 hinges on how\nbroadly it is construed. It is to that question that we now\nturn.3\n——————\n 3 The   dissent contends that because there has not been a ruling on\n                      Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010) \n                  11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              B\n\n   As we explained two Terms ago, “[t]he first step in\noverbreadth analysis is to construe the challenged statute;\nit is impossible to determine whether a statute reaches too\nfar without first knowing what the statute covers.” United\nStates v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 293 (2008). Because §48\nis a federal statute, there is no need to defer to a state\ncourt’s authority to interpret its own law.\n   We read §48 to create a criminal prohibition of alarming\nbreadth. To begin with, the text of the statute’s ban on a\n“depiction of animal cruelty” nowhere requires that the\ndepicted conduct be cruel. That text applies to “any . . .\ndepiction” in which “a living animal is intentionally\nmaimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded, or killed.”\n§48(c)(1). “[M]aimed, mutilated, [and] tortured” convey\ncruelty, but “wounded” or “killed” do not suggest any such\nlimitation.\n   The Government contends that the terms in the defini\ntion should be read to require the additional element of\n“accompanying acts of cruelty.” Reply Brief 6; see also Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 17–19. (The dissent hinges on the same\n——————\nthe validity of the statute as applied to Stevens, our consideration of his\nfacial overbreadth claim is premature. Post, at 1, and n. 1, 2–3 (opinion\nof ALITO, J.). Whether or not that conclusion follows, here no as-applied\nclaim has been preserved. Neither court below construed Stevens’s\nbriefs as adequately developing a separate attack on a defined subset of\nthe statute’s applications (say, dogfighting videos). See 533 F. 3d 218,\n231, n. 13 (CA3 2008) (en banc) (“Stevens brings a facial challenge to\nthe statute”); App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a, 74a. Neither did the Govern\nment, see Brief for United States in No. 05–2497 (CA3), p. 28 (opposing\n“the appellant’s facial challenge”); accord, Brief for United States 4.\nThe sentence in Stevens’s appellate brief mentioning his unrelated\nsufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge hardly developed a First Amend\nment as-applied claim. See post, at 1, n. 1. Stevens’s constitutional\nargument is a general one. And unlike the challengers in Washington\nState Grange, Stevens does not “rest on factual assumptions . . . that\ncan be evaluated only in the context of an as-applied challenge.” 552\nU. S., at 444.\n12               UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nassumption. See post, at 6, 9.) The Government bases\nthis argument on the definiendum, “depiction of animal\ncruelty,” cf. Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11 (2004), and\non “ ‘the commonsense canon of noscitur a sociis.’ ” Reply\nBrief 7 (quoting Williams, 553 U. S., at 294). As that\ncanon recognizes, an ambiguous term may be “given more\nprecise content by the neighboring words with which it is\nassociated.” Ibid. Likewise, an unclear definitional\nphrase may take meaning from the term to be defined, see\nLeocal, supra, at 11 (interpreting a “ ‘substantial risk’ ” of\nthe “us[e]” of “physical force” as part of the definition of\n“ ‘crime of violence’ ”).\n    But the phrase “wounded . . . or killed” at issue here\ncontains little ambiguity. The Government’s opening brief\nproperly applies the ordinary meaning of these words,\nstating for example that to “ ‘kill’ is ‘to deprive of life.’ ”\nBrief for United States 14 (quoting Webster’s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 1242 (1993)). We agree that\n“wounded” and “killed” should be read according to their\nordinary meaning. Cf. Engine Mfrs. Assn. v. South Coast\nAir Quality Management Dist., 541 U. S. 246, 252 (2004).\nNothing about that meaning requires cruelty.\n    While not requiring cruelty, §48 does require that the\ndepicted conduct be “illegal.” But this requirement does\nnot limit §48 along the lines the Government suggests.\nThere are myriad federal and state laws concerning the\nproper treatment of animals, but many of them are not\ndesigned to guard against animal cruelty. Protections of\nendangered species, for example, restrict even the humane\n“wound[ing] or kill[ing]” of “living animal[s].” §48(c)(1).\nLivestock regulations are often designed to protect the\nhealth of human beings, and hunting and fishing rules\n(seasons, licensure, bag limits, weight requirements) can\nbe designed to raise revenue, preserve animal populations,\nor prevent accidents.

Under subsection (c)(1), the depicted\nconduct need only be illegal in “the State in which the\ncreation, sale, or possession takes place, regardless of\nwhether the . . . wounding . . . or killing took place in\n[that] State.” A depiction of entirely lawful conduct runs\nafoul of the ban if that depiction later finds its way into\nanother State where the same conduct is unlawful. This\nprovision greatly expands the scope of §48, because al\nthough there may be “a broad societal consensus” against\ncruelty to animals, Brief for United States 2, there is\nsubstantial disagreement on what types of conduct are\nproperly regarded as cruel. Both views about cruelty to\nanimals and regulations having no connection to cruelty\nvary widely from place to place.\n   In the District of Columbia, for example, all hunting is\nunlawful. D. C. Munic. Regs., tit. 19, §1560 (2009). Other\njurisdictions permit or encourage hunting, and there is an\nenormous national market for hunting-related depictions\nin which a living animal is intentionally killed. Hunting\nperiodicals have circulations in the hundreds of thousands\nor millions, see Mediaweek, Sept. 29, 2008, p. 28, and\nhunting television programs, videos, and Web sites are\nequally popular, see Brief for Professional Outdoor Media\n\n——————\n   4 The citations in the dissent’s appendix are beside the point. The\n\ncited statutes stand for the proposition that hunting is not covered by\nanimal cruelty laws. But the reach of §48 is, as we have explained, not\nrestricted to depictions of conduct that violates a law specifically\ndirected at animal cruelty. It simply requires that the depicted conduct\nbe “illegal.” §48(c)(1). The Government implicitly admits as much,\narguing that “instructional videos for hunting” are saved by the stat\nute’s exceptions clause, not that they fall outside the prohibition in the\nfirst place. Reply Brief 6.\n14               UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nAssociation et al. as Amici Curiae 9–10. The demand for\nhunting depictions exceeds the estimated demand for\ncrush videos or animal fighting depictions by several\norders of magnitude. Compare ibid. and Brief for National\nRifle Association of America, Inc., as Amicus Curiae 12\n(hereinafter NRA Brief) (estimating that hunting maga\nzines alone account for $135 million in annual retail sales)\nwith Brief for United States 43–44, 46 (suggesting $1\nmillion in crush video sales per year, and noting that\nStevens earned $57,000 from his videos). Nonetheless,\nbecause the statute allows each jurisdiction to export its\nlaws to the rest of the country, §48(a) extends to any\nmagazine or video depicting lawful hunting, so long as\nthat depiction is sold within the Nation’s Capital.\n   Those seeking to comply with the law thus face a bewil\ndering maze of regulations from at least 56 separate juris\ndictions. Some States permit hunting with crossbows, Ga.\nCode Ann. §27–3–4(1) (2007); Va. Code Ann. §29.1–\n519(A)(6) (Lexis 2008 Cum. Supp.), while others forbid it,\nOre. Admin. Reg. 635–065–0725 (2009), or restrict it only\nto the disabled, N. Y. Envir. Conserv. Law Ann. §11–\n0901(16) (West 2005). Missouri allows the “canned” hunt\ning of ungulates held in captivity, Mo. Code Regs. Ann.,\ntit. 3, 10–9.560(1), but Montana restricts such hunting to\ncertain bird species, Mont. Admin. Rule 12.6.1202(1)\n(2007). The sharp-tailed grouse may be hunted in Idaho,\nbut not in Washington. Compare Idaho Admin. Code\n§13.01.09.606 (2009) with Wash. Admin. Code §232–28–\n342 (2009).\n   The disagreements among the States—and the “com\nmonwealth[s], territor[ies], or possession[s] of the United\nStates,” 18 U. S. C. §48(c)(2)—extend well beyond hunting.\nState agricultural regulations permit different methods of\nlivestock slaughter in different places or as applied to differ\nent animals. Compare, e.g., Fla. Stat. §828.23(5) (2007)\n(excluding poultry from humane slaughter requirements)\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwith Cal. Food & Agric. Code Ann. §19501(b) (West 2001)\n(including some poultry). California has recently banned\ncutting or “docking” the tails of dairy cattle, which other\nStates permit. 2009 Cal. Legis. Serv. Ch. 344 (S. B. 135)\n(West). Even cockfighting, long considered immoral in\nmuch of America, see Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501\nU. S. 560, 575 (1991) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment),\nis legal in Puerto Rico, see 15 Laws P. R. Ann. §301 (Supp.\n2008); Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of\nP. R., 478 U. S. 328, 342 (1986), and was legal in Louisi\nana until 2008, see La. Stat. Ann. §14:102.23 (West) (effec\ntive Aug. 15, 2008). An otherwise-lawful image of any of\nthese practices, if sold or possessed for commercial gain\nwithin a State that happens to forbid the practice, falls\nwithin the prohibition of §48(a).\n                              C\n   The only thing standing between defendants who sell\nsuch depictions and five years in federal prison—other\nthan the mercy of a prosecutor—is the statute’s exceptions\nclause. Subsection (b) exempts from prohibition “any\ndepiction that has serious religious, political, scientific,\neducational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value.” The\nGovernment argues that this clause substantially narrows\nthe statute’s reach: News reports about animal cruelty\nhave “journalistic” value; pictures of bullfights in Spain\nhave “historical” value; and instructional hunting videos\nhave “educational” value. Reply Brief 6. Thus, the Gov\nernment argues, §48 reaches only crush videos, depictions\nof animal fighting (other than Spanish bullfighting, see\nBrief for United States 47–48), and perhaps other depic\ntions of “extreme acts of animal cruelty.” Id., at 41.\n   The Government’s attempt to narrow the statutory ban,\nhowever, requires an unrealistically broad reading of the\nexceptions clause. As the Government reads the clause,\nany material with “redeeming societal value,” id., at 9, 16,\n16              UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n23, “ ‘at least some minimal value,’ ” Reply Brief 6 (quoting\nH. R. Rep., at 4), or anything more than “scant social\nvalue,” Reply Brief 11, is excluded under §48(b). But the\ntext says “serious” value, and “serious” should be taken\nseriously.      We decline the Government’s invitation—\nadvanced for the first time in this Court—to regard as\n“serious” anything that is not “scant.” (Or, as the dissent\nputs it, “ ‘trifling.’ ” Post, at 6.) As the Government recog\nnized below, “serious” ordinarily means a good bit more.\nThe District Court’s jury instructions required value that\nis “significant and of great import,” App. 132, and the\nGovernment defended these instructions as properly\nrelying on “a commonly accepted meaning of the word\n‘serious,’ ” Brief for United States in No. 05–2497 (CA3), p.\n50.\n   Quite apart from the requirement of “serious” value in\n§48(b), the excepted speech must also fall within one of the\nenumerated categories. Much speech does not. Most\nhunting videos, for example, are not obviously instruc\ntional in nature, except in the sense that all life is a les\nson. According to Safari Club International and the Con\ngressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, many popular videos\n“have primarily entertainment value” and are designed to\n“entertai[n] the viewer, marke[t] hunting equipment, or\nincreas[e] the hunting community.” Brief for Safari Club\nInternational et al. as Amici Curiae 12. The National\nRifle Association agrees that “much of the content of hunt\ning media . . . is merely recreational in nature.” NRA Brief\n28. The Government offers no principled explanation why\nthese depictions of hunting or depictions of Spanish bull\nfights would be inherently valuable while those of Japa\nnese dogfights are not. The dissent contends that hunting\ndepictions must have serious value because hunting has\nserious value, in a way that dogfights presumably do not.\nPost, at 6–8. But §48(b) addresses the value of the depic\ntions, not of the underlying activity. There is simply no\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)             17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nadequate reading of the exceptions clause that results in\nthe statute’s banning only the depictions the Government\nwould like to ban.\n    The Government explains that the language of §48(b)\nwas largely drawn from our opinion in Miller v. California,\n413 U. S. 15 (1973), which excepted from its definition of\nobscenity any material with “serious literary, artistic,\npolitical, or scientific value,” id., at 24. See Reply Brief 8,\n9, and n. 5. According to the Government, this incorpora\ntion of the Miller standard into §48 is therefore surely\nenough to answer any First Amendment objection. Reply\nBrief 8–9.\n    In Miller we held that “serious” value shields depictions\nof sex from regulation as obscenity. 413 U. S., at 24–25.\nLimiting Miller’s exception to “serious” value ensured that\n“ ‘[a] quotation from Voltaire in the flyleaf of a book\n[would] not constitutionally redeem an otherwise obscene\npublication.’ ” Id., at 25, n. 7 (quoting Kois v. Wisconsin,\n408 U. S. 229, 231 (1972) (per curiam)). We did not, how\never, determine that serious value could be used as a\ngeneral precondition to protecting other types of speech in\nthe first place. Most of what we say to one another lacks\n“religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic,\nhistorical, or artistic value” (let alone serious value), but it\nis still sheltered from government regulation. Even\n“ ‘[w]holly neutral futilities . . . come under the protection\nof free speech as fully as do Keats’ poems or Donne’s ser\nmons.’ ” Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15, 25 (1971) (quot\ning Winters v. New York, 333 U. S. 507, 528 (1948) (Frank\nfurter, J., dissenting); alteration in original).\n    Thus, the protection of the First Amendment presump\ntively extends to many forms of speech that do not qualify\nfor the serious-value exception of §48(b), but nonetheless\nfall within the broad reach of §48(c).\n18               UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                                D\n   Not to worry, the Government says: The Executive\nBranch construes §48 to reach only “extreme” cruelty,\nBrief for United States 8, and it “neither has brought nor\nwill bring a prosecution for anything less,” Reply Brief 6–\n7. The Government hits this theme hard, invoking its\nprosecutorial discretion several times. See id., at 6–7, 10,\nand n. 6, 19, 22. But the First Amendment protects\nagainst the Government; it does not leave us at the mercy\nof noblesse oblige. We would not uphold an unconstitu\ntional statute merely because the Government promised to\nuse it responsibly. Cf. Whitman v. American Trucking\nAssns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 473 (2001).\n   This prosecution is itself evidence of the danger in put\nting faith in government representations of prosecutorial\nrestraint. When this legislation was enacted, the Execu\ntive Branch announced that it would interpret §48 as\ncovering only depictions “of wanton cruelty to animals\ndesigned to appeal to a prurient interest in sex.” See\nStatement by President William J. Clinton upon Signing\nH. R. 1887, 34 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 2557 (Dec. 9,\n1999). No one suggests that the videos in this case fit that\ndescription. The Government’s assurance that it will\napply §48 far more restrictively than its language provides\nis pertinent only as an implicit acknowledgment of the\npotential constitutional problems with a more natural\nreading.\n   Nor can we rely upon the canon of construction that\n“ambiguous statutory language [should] be construed to\navoid serious constitutional doubts.” FCC v. Fox Televi\nsion Stations, Inc., 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at\n12). “[T]his Court may impose a limiting construction on a\nstatute only if it is ‘readily susceptible’ to such a construc\ntion.” Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S.\n844, 884 (1997).

To read §48 as the Government desires\nrequires rewriting, not just reinterpretation.\n                        *     *     *\n   Our construction of §48 decides the constitutional ques\ntion; the Government makes no effort to defend the consti\ntutionality of §48 as applied beyond crush videos and\ndepictions of animal fighting. It argues that those particu\nlar depictions are intrinsically related to criminal conduct\nor are analogous to obscenity (if not themselves obscene),\nand that the ban on such speech is narrowly tailored to\nreinforce restrictions on the underlying conduct, prevent\nadditional crime arising from the depictions, or safeguard\npublic mores. But the Government nowhere attempts to\nextend these arguments to depictions of any other activi\nties—depictions that are presumptively protected by the\nFirst Amendment but that remain subject to the criminal\nsanctions of §48.\n   Nor does the Government seriously contest that the\npresumptively impermissible applications of §48 (properly\nconstrued) far outnumber any permissible ones. However\n“growing” and “lucrative” the markets for crush videos and\ndogfighting depictions might be, see Brief for United\nStates 43, 46 (internal quotation marks omitted), they are\ndwarfed by the market for other depictions, such as hunt\ning magazines and videos, that we have determined to be\nwithin the scope of §48. See supra, at 13–14. We there\nfore need not and do not decide whether a statute limited\nto crush videos or other depictions of extreme animal\ncruelty would be constitutional.

S. C. §48, that was enacted not to suppress\nspeech, but to prevent horrific acts of animal cruelty—in\nparticular, the creation and commercial exploitation of\n“crush videos,” a form of depraved entertainment that has\nno social value. The Court’s approach, which has the\npractical effect of legalizing the sale of such videos and is\nthus likely to spur a resumption of their production, is\nunwarranted. Respondent was convicted under §48 for\nselling videos depicting dogfights. On appeal, he argued,\namong other things, that §48 is unconstitutional as ap\nplied to the facts of this case, and he highlighted features\nof those videos that might distinguish them from other\ndogfight videos brought to our attention.1 The Court of\n——————\n  1 Respondent     argued at length that the evidence was insufficient to\nprove that the particular videos he sold lacked any serious scientific,\neducational, or historical value and thus fell outside the exception in\n§48(b). See Brief for Appellant in No. 05–2497 (CA3), pp. 72–79. He\nadded that, if the evidence in this case was held to be sufficient to take\nhis videos outside the scope of the exception, then “this case presents\n. . . a situation” in which “a constitutional violation occurs.” Id., at 71.\nSee also id., at 47 (“The applicability of 18 U.

STEVENS\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nAppeals—incorrectly, in my view—declined to decide\nwhether §48 is unconstitutional as applied to respondent’s\nvideos and instead reached out to hold that the statute is\nfacially invalid. Today’s decision does not endorse the\nCourt of Appeals’ reasoning, but it nevertheless strikes\ndown §48 using what has been aptly termed the “strong\nmedicine” of the overbreadth doctrine, United States v.\nWilliams, 553 U. S. 285, 293 (2008) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted), a potion that generally should be admin\nistered only as “a last resort.” Los Angeles Police Dept. v.\nUnited Reporting Publishing Corp., 528 U. S. 32, 39 (1999)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Instead of applying the doctrine of overbreadth, I would\nvacate the decision below and instruct the Court of Ap\npeals on remand to decide whether the videos that respon\ndent sold are constitutionally protected. If the question of\noverbreadth is to be decided, however, I do not think the\npresent record supports the Court’s conclusion that §48\nbans a substantial quantity of protected speech.\n                             I\n   A party seeking to challenge the constitutionality of a\nstatute generally must show that the statute violates the\nparty’s own rights. New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 767\n(1982). The First Amendment overbreadth doctrine carves\nout a narrow exception to that general rule. See id., at\n768; Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 611–612\n(1973). Because an overly broad law may deter constitu\ntionally protected speech, the overbreadth doctrine allows\n\n——————\nRespondent 55 (“Stevens’ speech does not fit within any existing\ncategory of unprotected, prosecutable speech”); id., at 57 (“[T]he record\nas a whole demonstrates that Stevens’ speech cannot constitutionally\nbe punished”). Contrary to the Court, ante, at 10–11, n. 3 (citing 533\nF. 3d 218, 231, n. 13 (CA3 2008) (en banc)), I see no suggestion in the\nopinion of the Court of Appeals that respondent did not preserve an as\napplied challenge.\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

See, e.g., Board of\nTrustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 483\n(1989) (“Ordinarily, the principal advantage of the over\nbreadth doctrine for a litigant is that it enables him to\nbenefit from the statute’s unlawful application to someone\nelse”); see also Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S.\n447, 462, n. 20 (1978) (describing the doctrine as one\n“under which a person may challenge a statute that in\nfringes protected speech even if the statute constitution\nally might be applied to him”).\n   The “strong medicine” of overbreadth invalidation need\nnot and generally should not be administered when the\nstatute under attack is unconstitutional as applied to the\nchallenger before the court. As we said in Fox, supra, at\n484–485, “[i]t is not the usual judicial practice, . . . nor do\nwe consider it generally desirable, to proceed to an over\nbreadth issue unnecessarily—that is, before it is deter\nmined that the statute would be valid as applied.” Accord,\nNew York State Club Assn., Inc. v.

STEVENS\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n                              II\n   The overbreadth doctrine “strike[s] a balance between\ncompeting social costs.” Williams, 553 U. S., at 292.\nSpecifically, the doctrine seeks to balance the “harmful\neffects” of “invalidating a law that in some of its applica\ntions is perfectly constitutional” against the possibility\nthat “the threat of enforcement of an overbroad law [will]\ndete[r] people from engaging in constitutionally protected\nspeech.” Ibid. “In order to maintain an appropriate bal\nance, we have vigorously enforced the requirement that a\nstatute’s overbreadth be substantial, not only in an abso\nlute sense, but also relative to the statute’s plainly legiti\nmate sweep.” Ibid.\n   In determining whether a statute’s overbreadth is sub\nstantial, we consider a statute’s application to real-world\nconduct, not fanciful hypotheticals. See, e.g., id., at 301–\n302; see also Ferber, supra, at 773; Houston v. Hill, 482\nU. S. 451, 466–467 (1987). Accordingly, we have repeat\nedly emphasized that an overbreadth claimant bears the\nburden of demonstrating, “from the text of [the law] and\nfrom actual fact,” that substantial overbreadth exists.\nVirginia v. Hicks, 539 U. S. 113, 122 (2003) (quoting New\nYork State Club Assn., supra, at 14; emphasis added;\ninternal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original).\nSimilarly, “there must be a realistic danger that the stat\nute itself will significantly compromise recognized First\nAmendment protections of parties not before the Court for\nit to be facially challenged on overbreadth grounds.”\nMembers of City Council of Los Angeles v.

Instead, the Court tacitly assumes for the sake of\nargument that §48 is valid as applied to these depictions,\nbut the Court concludes that §48 reaches too much pro\ntected speech to survive. The Court relies primarily on\ndepictions of hunters killing or wounding game and depic\ntions of animals being slaughtered for food. I address the\nCourt’s examples below.\n                                A\n   I turn first to depictions of hunting. As the Court notes,\nphotographs and videos of hunters shooting game are\ncommon. See ante, at 13–14. But hunting is legal in all\n50 States, and §48 applies only to a depiction of conduct\nthat is illegal in the jurisdiction in which the depiction is\ncreated, sold, or possessed. §§48(a), (c). Therefore, in all\n50 States, the creation, sale, or possession for sale of the\nvast majority of hunting depictions indisputably falls\noutside §48’s reach.\n   Straining to find overbreadth, the Court suggests that\n§48 prohibits the sale or possession in the District of Co\nlumbia of any depiction of hunting because the District—\nundoubtedly because of its urban character—does not\npermit hunting within its boundaries. Ante, at 13. The\nCourt also suggests that, because some States prohibit a\nparticular type of hunting (e.g., hunting with a crossbow\nor “canned” hunting) or the hunting of a particular animal\n(e.g., the “sharp-tailed grouse”), §48 makes it illegal for\npersons in such States to sell or possess for sale a depic\ntion of hunting that was perfectly legal in the State in\nwhich the hunting took place. See ante, at 12–14.\n   The Court’s interpretation is seriously flawed. “When a\nfederal court is dealing with a federal statute challenged\nas overbroad, it should, of course, construe the statute to\navoid constitutional problems, if the statute is subject to\nsuch a limiting construction.” Ferber, 458 U. S., at 769,\n6                   UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nn. 24. See also Williams, supra, at 307 (STEVENS, J.,\nconcurring) (“[T]o the extent the statutory text alone is\nunclear, our duty to avoid constitutional objections makes\nit especially appropriate to look beyond the text in order to\nascertain the intent of its drafters”).\n   Applying this canon, I would hold that §48 does not\napply to depictions of hunting. First, because §48 targets\ndepictions of “animal cruelty,” I would interpret that\nterm to apply only to depictions involving acts of animal\ncruelty as defined by applicable state or federal law, not\nto depictions of acts that happen to be illegal for reasons\nhaving nothing to do with the prevention of animal cru\nelty. See ante, at 12–13 (interpreting “[t]he text of §48(c)”\nto ban a depiction of “the humane slaughter of a stolen\ncow”). Virtually all state laws prohibiting animal cruelty\neither expressly define the term “animal” to exclude\nwildlife or else specifically exempt lawful hunting activi\nties,3 so the statutory prohibition set forth in §48(a) may\nreasonably be interpreted not to reach most if not all\nhunting depictions.\n   Second, even if the hunting of wild animals were other\nwise covered by §48(a), I would hold that hunting depic\ntions fall within the exception in §48(b) for depictions that\nhave “serious” (i.e., not “trifling”4) “scientific,” “educa\n——————\n   3 See Appendix, infra (citing statutes); B.

While there are certainly\nthose who find hunting objectionable, the predominant\nview in this country has long been that hunting serves\nmany important values, and it is clear that Congress\nshares that view. Since 1972, when Congress called upon\nthe President to designate a National Hunting and Fish\ning Day, see S. J. Res. 117, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. (1972), 86\nStat. 133, Presidents have regularly issued proclamations\nextolling the values served by hunting. See Presidential\nProclamation No. 8421, 74 Fed. Reg. 49305 (Pres. Obama\n2009) (hunting and fishing are “ageless pursuits” that\npromote “the conservation and restoration of numerous\nspecies and their natural habitats”); Presidential Procla\nmation No. 8295, 73 Fed. Reg. 57233 (Pres. Bush 2008)\n(hunters and anglers “add to our heritage and keep our\nwildlife populations healthy and strong,” and “are among\nour foremost conservationists”); Presidential Proclamation\nNo. 7822, 69 Fed. Reg. 59539 (Pres. Bush 2004) (hunting\nand fishing are “an important part of our Nation’s heri\ntage,” and “America’s hunters and anglers represent the\ngreat spirit of our country”); Presidential Proclamation No.\n4682, 44 Fed. Reg. 53149 (Pres. Carter 1979) (hunting\npromotes conservation and an appreciation of “healthy\nrecreation, peaceful solitude and closeness to nature”);\nPresidential Proclamation No. 4318, 39 Fed. Reg. 35315\n(Pres. Ford 1974) (hunting furthers “appreciation and\nrespect for nature” and preservation of the environment).\nThus, it is widely thought that hunting has “scientific”\nvalue in that it promotes conservation, “historical” value\nin that it provides a link to past times when hunting\nplayed a critical role in daily life, and “educational” value\nin that it furthers the understanding and appreciation of\nnature and our country’s past and instills valuable charac\nter traits. And if hunting itself is widely thought to serve\nthese values, then it takes but a small additional step to\nconclude that depictions of hunting make a non-trivial\n8               UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ncontribution to the exchange of ideas. Accordingly, I\nwould hold that hunting depictions fall comfortably within\nthe exception set out in §48(b).\n  I do not have the slightest doubt that Congress, in en\nacting §48, had no intention of restricting the creation,\nsale, or possession of depictions of hunting. Proponents of\nthe law made this point clearly. See H. R. Rep. No. 106–\n397, p. 8 (1999) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.) (“[D]epictions of\nordinary hunting and fishing activities do not fall within\nthe scope of the statute”); 145 Cong. Rec. 25894 (Oct. 19,\n1999) (Rep. McCollum) (“[T]he sale of depictions of legal\nactivities, such as hunting and fishing, would not be illegal\nunder this bill”); id., at 25895 (Rep. Smith) (“[L]et us be\nclear as to what this legislation will not do. It will in no\nway prohibit hunting, fishing, or wildlife videos”). Indeed,\neven opponents acknowledged that §48 was not intended\nto reach ordinary hunting depictions. See ibid. (Rep.\nScott); id., at 25897 (Rep. Paul).\n  For these reasons, I am convinced that §48 has no appli\ncation to depictions of hunting. But even if §48 did imper\nmissibly reach the sale or possession of depictions of hunt\ning in a few unusual situations (for example, the sale in\nOregon of a depiction of hunting with a crossbow in Vir\nginia or the sale in Washington State of the hunting of a\nsharp-tailed grouse in Idaho, see ante, at 14), those iso\nlated applications would hardly show that §48 bans a\nsubstantial amount of protected speech.\n                             B\n   Although the Court’s overbreadth analysis rests primar\nily on the proposition that §48 substantially restricts the\nsale and possession of hunting depictions, the Court cites\na few additional examples, including depictions of methods\nof slaughter and the docking of the tails of dairy cows. See\nante, at 14–15.\n   Such examples do not show that the statute is substan\n                   Cite as: 559 U.

First, as explained\nabove, §48 can reasonably be construed to apply only to\ndepictions involving acts of animal cruelty as defined by\napplicable state or federal law, and anti-cruelty laws do\nnot ban the sorts of acts depicted in the Court’s hypotheti\ncals. See, e.g., Idaho Code §25–3514 (Lexis 2000) (“No\npart of this chapter [prohibiting cruelty to animals] shall\nbe construed as interfering with or allowing interference\nwith . . . [t]he humane slaughter of any animal normally\nand commonly raised as food or for production of fiber . . .\n[or] [n]ormal or accepted practices of . . . animal hus\nbandry”); Kan. Stat. Ann. § 21–4310(b) (2007) (“The provi\nsions of this section shall not apply to . . . with respect to\nfarm animals, normal or accepted practices of animal\nhusbandry, including the normal and accepted practices\nfor the slaughter of such animals”); Md. Crim. Law Code\nAnn. §10–603 (Lexis 2002) (sections prohibiting animal\ncruelty “do not apply to . . . customary and normal veteri\nnary and agricultural husbandry practices, including\ndehorning, castration, tail docking, and limit feeding”).\n   Second, nothing in the record suggests that any one has\never created, sold, or possessed for sale a depiction of the\nslaughter of food animals or of the docking of the tails of\ndairy cows that would not easily qualify under the excep\ntion set out in §48(b). Depictions created to show proper\nmethods of slaughter or tail-docking would presumably\nhave serious “educational” value, and depictions created to\nfocus attention on methods thought to be inhumane or\notherwise objectionable would presumably have either\nserious “educational” or “journalistic” value or both. In\nshort, the Court’s examples of depictions involving the\ndocking of tails and humane slaughter do not show that\n§48 suffers from any overbreadth, much less substantial\noverbreadth.\n   The Court notes, finally, that cockfighting, which is\nillegal in all States, is still legal in Puerto Rico, ante, at 15,\n10                  UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nand I take the Court’s point to be that it would be imper\nmissible to ban the creation, sale, or possession in Puerto\nRico of a depiction of a cockfight that was legally staged in\nPuerto Rico.5 But assuming for the sake of argument that\nthis is correct, this veritable sliver of unconstitutionality\nwould not be enough to justify striking down §48 in toto.\n   In sum, we have a duty to interpret §48 so as to avoid\nserious constitutional concerns, and §48 may reasonably\nbe construed not to reach almost all, if not all, of the depic\ntions that the Court finds constitutionally protected.\nThus, §48 does not appear to have a large number of un\nconstitutional applications. Invalidation for overbreadth\nis appropriate only if the challenged statute suffers from\nsubstantial overbreadth—judged not just in absolute\nterms, but in relation to the statute’s “plainly legitimate\nsweep.” Williams, 553 U. S., at 292. As I explain in the\nfollowing Part, §48 has a substantial core of constitution\nally permissible applications.\n                             IV\n                              A\n                              1\n  As the Court of Appeals recognized, “the primary con\nduct that Congress sought to address through its passage\n[of §48] was the creation, sale, or possession of ‘crush\nvideos.’ ” 533 F. 3d 218, 222 (CA3 2008) (en banc).

The kitten\n    hemorrhages blood, screams blindly in pain, and is ul\n    timately left dead in a moist pile of blood-soaked hair\n    and bone.” Brief for Humane Society of United States\n    as Amicus Curiae 2 (hereinafter Humane Society\n    Brief).\n   It is undisputed that the conduct depicted in crush\nvideos may constitutionally be prohibited. All 50 States\nand the District of Columbia have enacted statutes prohib\niting animal cruelty. See 533 F. 3d, at 223, and n. 4 (citing\nstatutes); H. R. Rep., at 3. But before the enactment of\n§48, the underlying conduct depicted in crush videos was\nnearly impossible to prosecute. These videos, which “ often\nappeal to persons with a very specific sexual fetish,” id., at\n2, were made in secret, generally without a live audience,\nand “the faces of the women inflicting the torture in the\nmaterial often were not shown, nor could the location of\nthe place where the cruelty was being inflicted or the date\nof the activity be ascertained from the depiction.” Id., at 3.\nThus, law enforcement authorities often were not able to\nidentify the parties responsible for the torture. See Pun\nishing Depictions of Animal Cruelty and the Federal\nPrisoner Health Care Co-Payment Act of 1999: Hearing\nbefore the Subcommittee on Crime of the House Commit\ntee on the Judiciary, 106th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 1 (1999)\n(hereinafter Hearing on Depictions of Animal Cruelty). In\nthe rare instances in which it was possible to identify and\nfind the perpetrators, they “often were able to successfully\nassert as a defense that the State could not prove its\njurisdiction over the place where the act occurred or that\nthe actions depicted took place within the time specified in\n12              UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthe State statute of limitations.” H. R. Rep., at 3; see also\n145 Cong. Rec. 25896 (Rep. Gallegly) (“[I]t is the prosecu\ntors from around this country, Federal prosecutors as well\nas State prosecutors, that have made an appeal to us for\nthis”); Hearing on Depictions of Animal Cruelty 21 (“If the\nproduction of the video is not discovered during the actual\nfilming, then prosecution for the offense is virtually im\npossible without a cooperative eyewitness to the filming or\nan undercover police operation”); id., at 34–35 (discussing\nexample of case in which state prosecutor “had the defen\ndant telling us he produced these videos,” but where\nprosecution was not possible because the State could not\nprove where or when the tape was made).\n   In light of the practical problems thwarting the prosecu\ntion of the creators of crush videos under state animal\ncruelty laws, Congress concluded that the only effective\nway of stopping the underlying criminal conduct was to\nprohibit the commercial exploitation of the videos of that\nconduct. And Congress’ strategy appears to have been\nvindicated. We are told that “[b]y 2007, sponsors of §48\ndeclared the crush video industry dead. Even overseas\nWebsites shut down in the wake of §48. Now, after the\nThird Circuit’s decision [facially invalidating the statute],\ncrush videos are already back online.” Humane Society\nBrief 5 (citations omitted).\n                            2\n   The First Amendment protects freedom of speech, but it\nmost certainly does not protect violent criminal conduct,\neven if engaged in for expressive purposes. Crush videos\npresent a highly unusual free speech issue because they\nare so closely linked with violent criminal conduct. The\nvideos record the commission of violent criminal acts, and\nit appears that these crimes are committed for the sole\npurpose of creating the videos. In addition, as noted\nabove, Congress was presented with compelling evidence\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthat the only way of preventing these crimes was to target\nthe sale of the videos. Under these circumstances, I can\nnot believe that the First Amendment commands Con\ngress to step aside and allow the underlying crimes to\ncontinue.\n   The most relevant of our prior decisions is Ferber, 458\nU. S. 747, which concerned child pornography. The Court\nthere held that child pornography is not protected speech,\nand I believe that Ferber’s reasoning dictates a similar\nconclusion here.\n   In Ferber, an important factor—I would say the most\nimportant factor—was that child pornography involves the\ncommission of a crime that inflicts severe personal injury\nto the “children who are made to engage in sexual conduct\nfor commercial purposes.’ ” Id., at 753 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The Ferber Court repeatedly described\nthe production of child pornography as child “abuse,”\n“molestation,” or “exploitation.” See, e.g., id., at 749 (“In\nrecent years, the exploitive use of children in the produc\ntion of pornography has become a serious national prob\nlem”); id., at 758, n. 9 (“Sexual molestation by adults is\noften involved in the production of child sexual perform\nances”). As later noted in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coali\ntion, 535 U. S. 234, 249 (2002), in Ferber “[t]he production\nof the work, not its content, was the target of the statute.”\nSee also 535 U.S., at 250 (Ferber involved “speech that\nitself is the record of sexual abuse”).\n   Second, Ferber emphasized the fact that these underly\ning crimes could not be effectively combated without tar\ngeting the distribution of child pornography. As the Court\nput it, “the distribution network for child pornography\nmust be closed if the production of material which requires\nthe sexual exploitation of children is to be effectively\ncontrolled.” 458 U. S., at 759. The Court added:\n    “[T]here is no serious contention that the legislature\n14               UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n     was unjustified in believing that it is difficult, if not\n     impossible, to halt the exploitation of children by pur\n     suing only those who produce the photographs and\n     movies. . . . The most expeditious if not the only prac\n     tical method of law enforcement may be to dry up the\n     market for this material by imposing severe criminal\n     penalties on persons selling, advertising, or otherwise\n     promoting the product.” Id., at 759–760.\nSee also id., at 761 (“The advertising and selling of child\npornography provide an economic motive for and are thus\nan integral part of the production of such materials”).\n   Third, the Ferber Court noted that the value of child\npornography “is exceedingly modest, if not de minimis,”\nand that any such value was “overwhelmingly out\nweigh[ed]” by “the evil to be restricted.” Id., at 762–763.\n   All three of these characteristics are shared by §48, as\napplied to crush videos. First, the conduct depicted in\ncrush videos is criminal in every State and the District of\nColumbia. Thus, any crush video made in this country\nrecords the actual commission of a criminal act that in\nflicts severe physical injury and excruciating pain and\nultimately results in death. Those who record the under\nlying criminal acts are likely to be criminally culpable,\neither as aiders and abettors or conspirators. And in the\ntight and secretive market for these videos, some who sell\nthe videos or possess them with the intent to make a profit\nmay be similarly culpable. (For example, in some cases,\ncrush videos were commissioned by purchasers who speci\nfied the details of the acts that they wanted to see per\nformed. See H. R. Rep., at 3; Hearing on Depictions of\nAnimal Cruelty 27). To the extent that §48 reaches such\npersons, it surely does not violate the First Amendment.\n   Second, the criminal acts shown in crush videos cannot\nbe prevented without targeting the conduct prohibited by\n§48—the creation, sale, and possession for sale of depic\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          15\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ntions of animal torture with the intention of realizing a\ncommercial profit. The evidence presented to Congress\nposed a stark choice: Either ban the commercial exploita\ntion of crush videos or tolerate a continuation of the crimi\nnal acts that they record. Faced with this evidence, Con\ngress reasonably chose to target the lucrative crush video\nmarket.\n   Finally, the harm caused by the underlying crimes\nvastly outweighs any minimal value that the depictions\nmight conceivably be thought to possess. Section 48\nreaches only the actual recording of acts of animal torture;\nthe statute does not apply to verbal descriptions or to\nsimulations. And, unlike the child pornography statute in\nFerber or its federal counterpart, 18 U. S. C. §2252, §48(b)\nprovides an exception for depictions having any “serious\nreligious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic,\nhistorical, or artistic value.”\n   It must be acknowledged that §48 differs from a child\npornography law in an important respect: preventing the\nabuse of children is certainly much more important than\npreventing the torture of the animals used in crush videos.\nIt was largely for this reason that the Court of Appeals\nconcluded that Ferber did not support the constitutionality\nof §48. 533 F. 3d, at 228 (“Preventing cruelty to animals,\nalthough an exceedingly worthy goal, simply does not\nimplicate interests of the same magnitude as protecting\nchildren from physical and psychological harm”). But\nwhile protecting children is unquestionably more impor\ntant than protecting animals, the Government also has a\ncompelling interest in preventing the torture depicted in\ncrush videos.\n   The animals used in crush videos are living creatures\nthat experience excruciating pain. Our society has long\nbanned such cruelty, which is illegal throughout the coun\ntry. In Ferber, the Court noted that “virtually all of the\nStates and the United States have passed legislation\n16                  UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nproscribing the production of or otherwise combating ‘child\npornography,’ ” and the Court declined to “second-guess\n[that] legislative judgment.”6 458 U. S., at 758. Here,\nlikewise, the Court of Appeals erred in second-guessing\nthe legislative judgment about the importance of prevent\ning cruelty to animals.\n   Section 48’s ban on trafficking in crush videos also helps\nto enforce the criminal laws and to ensure that criminals\ndo not profit from their crimes. See 145 Cong. Rec. 25897\n(Oct. 19, 1999) (Rep. Gallegly) (“The state has an interest\nin enforcing its existing laws. Right now, the laws are not\nonly being violated, but people are making huge profits\nfrom promoting the violations”); id., at 10685 (May 24,\n1999) (Rep. Gallegly) (explaining that he introduced the\nHouse version of the bill because “criminals should not\nprofit from [their] illegal acts”). We have already judged\nthat taking the profit out of crime is a compelling interest.\nSee Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State\nCrime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 119 (1991).\n   In short, Ferber is the case that sheds the most light on\nthe constitutionality of Congress’ effort to halt the produc\ntion of crush videos. Applying the principles set forth in\nFerber, I would hold that crush videos are not protected by\nthe First Amendment.\n                               B\n     Application of the Ferber framework also supports the\n——————\n   6 In other cases, we have regarded evidence of a national consensus as\n\nproof that a particular government interest is compelling. See Simon &\nSchuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S.\n105, 118 (1991) (State’s compelling interest “in ensuring that victims of\ncrime are compensated by those who harm them” evidenced by fact that\n“[e]very State has a body of tort law serving exactly this interest”);\nRoberts v.

(For convenience, I will focus on videos of\ndogfights, which appear to be the most common type of\nanimal fight videos.)\n   First, such depictions, like crush videos, record the\nactual commission of a crime involving deadly violence.\nDogfights are illegal in every State and the District of\nColumbia, Brief for United States 26–27, and n. 8 (citing\nstatutes), and under federal law constitute a felony pun\nishable by imprisonment for up to five years, 7 U. S. C.\n§2156 et seq. (2006 ed. and Supp. II), 18 U. S. C. §49 (2006\ned., Supp. II).\n   Second, Congress had an ample basis for concluding\nthat the crimes depicted in these videos cannot be effec\ntively controlled without targeting the videos. Like crush\nvideos and child pornography, dogfight videos are very\noften produced as part of a “low-profile, clandestine indus\ntry,” and “the need to market the resulting products re\nquires a visible apparatus of distribution.” Ferber, 458\nU. S., at 760. In such circumstances, Congress had rea\nsonable grounds for concluding that it would be “difficult,\nif not impossible, to halt” the underlying exploitation of\ndogs by pursuing only those who stage the fights. Id., at\n759–760; see 533 F. 3d, at 246 (Cowen, J., dissenting)\n(citing evidence establishing “the existence of a lucrative\nmarket for depictions of animal cruelty,” including videos\nof dogfights, “which in turn provides a powerful incentive\nto individuals to create [such] videos”).\n   The commercial trade in videos of dogfights is “an inte\ngral part of the production of such materials,” Ferber,\nsupra, at 761.       As the Humane Society explains,\n“[v]ideotapes memorializing dogfights are integral to the\nsuccess of this criminal industry” for a variety of reasons.\nHumane Society Brief 5. For one thing, some dogfighting\nvideos are made “solely for the purpose of selling the video\n(and not for a live audience).” Id., at 9. In addition, those\n18               UNITED STATES v. STEVENS\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwho stage dogfights profit not just from the sale of the\nvideos themselves, but from the gambling revenue they\ntake in from the fights; the videos “encourage [such] gam\nbling activity because they allow those reluctant to attend\nactual fights for fear of prosecution to still bet on the\noutcome.” Ibid.; accord, Brief for Center on the Admini\nstration of Criminal Law as Amicus Curiae 12 (“Selling\nvideos of dogfights effectively abets the underlying crimes\nby providing a market for dogfighting while allowing\nactual dogfights to remain underground”); ibid. (“These\nvideos are part of a ‘lucrative market’ where videos are\nproduced by a ‘bare-boned, clandestine staff’ in order to\npermit the actual location of dogfights and the perpetra\ntors of these underlying criminal activities to go unde\ntected” (citations omitted)). Moreover, “[v]ideo documen\ntation is vital to the criminal enterprise because it\nprovides proof of a dog’s fighting prowess—proof de\nmanded by potential buyers and critical to the under\nground market.” Humane Society Brief 9. Such re\ncordings may also serve as “ ‘training’ videos for other fight\norganizers.” Ibid. In short, because videos depicting live\ndogfights are essential to the success of the criminal dog\nfighting subculture, the commercial sale of such videos\nhelps to fuel the market for, and thus to perpetuate the\nperpetration of, the criminal conduct depicted in them.\n   Third, depictions of dogfights that fall within §48’s reach\nhave by definition no appreciable social value. As noted,\n§48(b) exempts depictions having any appreciable social\nvalue, and thus the mere inclusion of a depiction of a live\nfight in a larger work that aims at communicating an idea\nor a message with a modicum of social value would not run\nafoul of the statute.\n   Finally, the harm caused by the underlying criminal\nacts greatly outweighs any trifling value that the depic\ntions might be thought to possess.

As a result, dog\n    fights inflict horrific injuries on the participating\n    animals, including lacerations, ripped ears, puncture\n    wounds and broken bones. Losing dogs are routinely\n    refused treatment, beaten further as ‘punishment’ for\n    the loss, and executed by drowning, hanging, or incin\n    eration.” Id., at 5–6 (footnotes omitted).\n   For these dogs, unlike the animals killed in crush vid\neos, the suffering lasts for years rather than minutes. As\nwith crush videos, moreover, the statutory ban on com\nmerce in dogfighting videos is also supported by compel\nling governmental interests in effectively enforcing the\nNation’s criminal laws and preventing criminals from\nprofiting from their illegal activities. See Ferber, supra, at\n757–758; Simon & Schuster, 502 U. S., at 119.\n   In sum, §48 may validly be applied to at least two broad\nreal-world categories of expression covered by the statute:\ncrush videos and dogfighting videos. Thus, the statute has\na substantial core of constitutionally permissible applica\ntions. Moreover, for the reasons set forth above, the re\ncord does not show that §48, properly interpreted, bans a\nsubstantial amount of protected speech in absolute terms.\nA fortiori, respondent has not met his burden of demon\nstrating that any impermissible applications of the statute\nare “substantial” in relation to its “plainly legitimate\nsweep.” Williams, 553 U. S., at 292. Accordingly, I would\nreject respondent’s claim that §48 is facially unconstitu\ntional under the overbreadth doctrine.\n20                 UNITED STATES v.
