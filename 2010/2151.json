This duty is\nparticularly compelling in cases that present an opportu\nnity to decide the constitutionality or enforceability of\nfederal statutes in a manner “insulated from the pressures\nof the moment,” and in time to guide courts and the politi\ncal branches in resolving difficult questions concerning the\nproper “exercise of governmental power.” Hamdan v.\nRumsfeld, 548 U.

The\nfirst is the extent, if any, to which provisions like Section 5\naffect 28 U. S. C. §2241 in a manner that implicates the\nconstitutional guarantee of habeas corpus. The second is\nwhether the Geneva Conventions are self-executing and\njudicially enforceable.\n   It is incumbent upon us to provide what guidance we\ncan on these issues now. Whatever conclusion we reach,\nour opinion will help the political branches and the courts\ndischarge their responsibilities over detainee cases, and\nwill spare detainees and the Government years of unnec\nessary litigation. These considerations alone justify re\nview. That petitioner was convicted in federal court\n(rather than in a military commission) in criminal pro\nceedings uncomplicated by classified information or issues\nrelating to extraterritorial detention is an additional\nreason to grant certiorari.

The District Judge found that the hostilities in\nPanama constituted an “ ‘armed conflict’ ” within the meaning of Article\n2 of the Third Geneva Convention, that Noriega was a member of the\narmed forces of a party to the conflict under Article 4 of the Third\nConvention, and that the District Court was a “ ‘competent tribunal’ ” to\ndetermine Noriega’s POW status under Article 5 of the Third Conven\ntion.

Section\n     5, in contrast, as discussed more fully, infra, at most\n     changes one substantive provision of law upon which\n     a party might rely in seeking habeas relief.

Noriega next\nasserts that, if the Eleventh Circuit’s interpretation of\n§5(a) is correct, the provision violates the Supremacy\nClause, see id., at 11−12, and the Suspension Clause, see\nReply to Brief in Opposition 2. Noriega’s Supremacy\nClause argument is that, to the extent MCA §5(a) governs\nhis Geneva Convention claims, the provision impermissi\nbly effects a “complete repudiation” of the treaty. Pet. for\nCert. 11. The Government responds that this argument\nsuffers from two fatal flaws. First, this Court has held\nthat a treaty, which is “ ‘primarily a compact between\nindependent nations,’ ” remains in force as the supreme\nlaw of the land even where its enforcement is left to “in\nternational negotiations” rather than “domestic courts.”\nBrief in Opposition 7 (quoting Head Money Cases, 112\nU. S. 580, 598 (1884)); see Medellín, supra, at 505, and\nn. 3. Second, “[w]hatever the domestic effect of the Third\nGeneva Convention before the enactment of the MCA,”\nthis Court has held that ‘it is within Congress’ power to\nchange domestic law, even if the law originally arose from\na self-executing treaty.’ ” Brief in Opposition 7 (quoting\nNoriega, supra, at 1295–1296); see also Medellín, supra, at\n509, n. 5. Accordingly, the Government agrees with the\nEleventh Circuit that MCA §5(a) “does not change the\ninternational obligations of the United States under the\nGeneva Conventions,” but does “supersed[e] whatever\ndomestic effect the Geneva Conventions may have had in\nactions such as this.” Brief in Opposition 7–8 (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted).         That brings\nNoriega to his Suspension Clause argument. He replies\nthat, if MCA §5(a) operates in the manner the Govern\nment describes and the Eleventh Circuit held, the provi\nsion is unconstitutional under Boumediene because it\n“effectively works a suspension of the writ.” Reply to Brief\nin Opposition 2 (asserting that “to divorce the writ from\n8                   NORIEGA v. PASTRANA\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthe law is to destroy the writ”).\n                              II\n   As the Eleventh Circuit’s opinion makes clear, the\nthreshold question in this case is whether MCA §5(a) is\nvalid. Answering that question this Term would provide\ncourts and the political branches with much needed guid\nance on issues we left open in Boumediene. See Boumedi­\nene, 553 U. S, at ___, ___ (slip op. at 64−66, 68−70). Pro\nviding that guidance in this case would allow us to say\nwhat the law is without the unnecessary delay and other\ncomplications that could burden a decision on these ques\ntions in Guantanamo or other detainee litigation arising\nout of the conflict with Al Qaeda.\n   Boumediene invalidated MCA §7’s attempt to strip\nfederal courts of habeas jurisdiction over claims by a\nspecified class of non-citizen detainees (“unlawful enemy\ncombatants”), but did not determine the “content of the\nlaw that governs petitioners’ detention,” id., at ___ (slip\nop. at 69), or the extent to which §2241’s substantive\nprovisions affect the constitutional “procedural protections\nof habeas corpus,” id., at ___ (slip op. at 70). Section 2241\nbroadly confers jurisdiction over a habeas corpus action by\nany person who claims to be held “in custody in violation\nof the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United\nStates.” See Rasul v. Bush, 542 U. S. 466, 473 (2004).\nMCA §5(a) eliminates the Geneva Conventions as a source\nof rights upon which §2241 petitioners may rely in chal\nlenging their detentions. Statutory amendments to an\nexisting law ordinarily involve nothing more than a valid\nexercise of Congress’ Article I authority. See, e.g., Chew\nHeong v. United States, 112 U. S. 536, 562–563 (1884).\nNoriega asserts that the difference in this case is that the\nstatutory amendment narrows the scope of §2241.

Only we can\ndetermine whether the Eleventh Circuit correctly rejected\nthat argument.\n   The Suspension Clause provides that “[t]he Privilege of\nthe Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless\nwhen in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety\nmay require it.” U. S. Const., Art. I, §9, cl. 2. Because the\nClause addresses only the suspension—not the content or\nexistence—of the “Privilege of the Writ,” ibid., we have\nlong recognized the “obligation” the first Congress “must\nhave felt” to “provid[e] efficient means by which this great\nconstitutional privilege should receive life and activity.”\nEx parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75, 95 (1807). But we have\nalso steadfastly declined to adopt a date of reference by\nwhich the writ’s constitutional content, if any, is to be\njudged, see Boumediene, supra, ___ (slip op. at 15−17), and\nthus have left open the question whether statutory efforts\nto limit §2241 implicate the Suspension Clause, see, e.g.,\nINS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 300–301 (2001). This ques\ntion, which has already divided the Court in other con\ntexts, see ibid.,8 is clearly presented here. Noriega asserts\n——————\n  8 Compare  St. Cyr, 533 U.

The Eleventh Circuit, however, saw no\nconstitutional problem with the statute and upheld it as\nvalid and distinguishable from the provision deemed\nunconstitutional in Boumediene. See 564 F. 3d, at 1294.\n  Addressing Noriega’s challenge to the Eleventh Circuit’s\ndecision would resolve the important statutory and consti\ntutional questions here and would guide courts and the\npolitical branches in addressing the same and similar\nissues in other detainee cases. See, e.g., Al-Bihani, supra,\nat *5 (“The Supreme Court has provided scant guidance on\nthese questions, consciously leaving the contours of the\nsubstantive and procedural law of detention open for lower\ncourts to shape in a common law fashion.”). Recent court\ndecisions, as well as recent Executive Branch court filings\nand policy determinations, specifically invoke the Geneva\nConventions as part of the law that governs detainee\ntreatment in the United States and abroad. For example,\nin September 2009, the U.S. District Court for the District\nof Columbia issued a redacted version of a classified\nmemorandum opinion in which it granted habeas corpus\nrelief in the oldest of the pending Guantanamo cases\nbecause the petitioner’s indefinite detention was based\n“almost exclusively” on unreliable “confessions” obtained\n“using abusive techniques that violated the Army Field\n——————\nthe Court concedes, the writ could not be suspended within the mean\ning of the Suspension Clause until Congress affirmatively provided for\nhabeas by statute, then surely Congress may subsequently alter what it\nhad initially provided for, lest the Clause become a one-way ratchet.”\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

Although the D.

Al-Bihani\naddresses MCA §5(a) in rejecting only one of many claims for habeas\ncorpus relief, so it is not clear that the Court would need to address the\nstatute’s validity in deciding the case. And even if the Court were to\naddress §5(a), the decision would come next Term, thus providing no\nguidance to courts that must adjudicate pending habeas corpus actions\nthis spring and summer. In contrast, addressing MCA §5(a)’s validity\nin this case would timely provide such guidance. Doing so could also\naid our disposition of Kiyemba I because answering the questions\npresented here could clarify the constitutional scope of the writ of\nhabeas corpus in a manner that could affect the Kiyemba I petitioners’\nargument about the inherent remedial power of habeas corpus courts.\nSee Pet. for Cert. in No. 08–1234, pp. 14–16, 22–23; see generally\nKiyemba I, 555 F. 3d, at 1026–1027; St. Cyr, 533 U.

PASTRANA\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n(as they did here) with Geneva Convention claims in\nhabeas corpus proceedings.13 And, it would give the politi\ncal branches a clearer sense of the constitutional limits to\nwhich new legislative or policy initiatives must adhere.\nThe latter benefit would also follow if we were to invali\ndate MCA §5(a). In addition, such a ruling could well\nallow us to reach the question we left open in Hamdan—\nwhether the Geneva Conventions are self-executing and\njudicially enforceable—because this case is not governed\nby the Uniform Code of Military Justice provisions on\nwhich the Hamdan majority relied in holding Common\nArticle III applicable to the proceedings in that case. See\nHamdan, 548 U. S., at 627–628; see also id., at 637, 642–\n643 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part). Finally, if the\nCourt were to conclude that the Conventions are self\nexecuting and judicially enforceable in habeas corpus\nproceedings, this case would present two additional ques\ntions relevant to noncitizen detainee litigation: whether\nfederal courts may classify such detainees as POWs under\nthe Third Convention, and whether any of the Conven\ntions requires the United States immediately to repatriate\ndetainees entitled to release from U. S. custody.14\n   Against these considerations, the Government pro\nvides no compelling reason to decline review.15 Accord\n——————\n   13 MCA §5(a) applies not only to individuals who, like Noriega, have\n\n(rightly or not) been designated POWs, but also to “any person” who\ninvokes the Conventions as a source of rights in any “habeas or other\ncivil action” to which the United States is a party, see 120 Stat. 2631,\nnote following 28 U. S. C. §2241.\n   14 Both questions are subsumed in the second question in the Solicitor\n\nGeneral’s brief: “[w]hether, assuming petitioner can assert a claim\nbased on the Geneva Convention, his extradition to France would\nviolate the Convention.” Brief in Opposition i.\n   15 The Solicitor General’s principal ground for opposing certiorari is\n\nthat the Eleventh Circuit’s decision does not conflict with the decision\nof any other Circuit. See Brief in Opposition 6. That is true but not\nsurprising. The original version of the MCA is only three years old and,\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

Accordingly, the lack of a circuit split on the ques\ntion whether MCA §5(a) bars POWs in federal custody in the United\nStates from invoking the Geneva Conventions in habeas proceedings\ndoes not negate the compelling reasons to grant review. Indeed, the\nCourt has taken cases in this area without the benefit of any opinion\nfrom a court of appeals, see Ex parte Quirin, supra, and in splitless\ncases involving rare facts and ongoing diplomatic negotiations, see\nKiyemba I, ante, p. ___. The Court has also granted review of separa\ntion-of-powers and other important legal questions on records far less\ndeveloped than that here, see, e.g., Robertson v. United States ex rel.\nWatson, ante, p. ___; Christian Legal Soc. Chapter of Univ. of Cal.\nHasting College of Law v. Martinez, ante, p. ___; on petitions that have\nrequired us to reformulate the questions presented, see, e.g., Robertson,\nsupra; Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 555 U. S. ___ (2009); and even\non petitions we initially denied, see Boumediene v. Bush, 551 U. S. 1160\n(2007). The Solicitor General also claims (again based on the fact that\nNoriega is “currently” the only POW in U. S. custody) that review is not\nwarranted because the Eleventh Circuit’s decision is of “limited ongoing\nsignificance.” Ibid. This assertion is not persuasive for the reasons set\nforth above.\n   16 As noted, the Solicitor General’s first question presented is whether\n\nMCA §5(a) “precludes petitioner from invoking” the Third Geneva\nConvention “as a source of rights in a habeas corpus proceeding.” Brief\nin Opposition i. Such statutory questions do not automatically, or even\ntypically, require a court to consider the statute’s constitutionality.\nHere, however, Noriega has consistently argued that, if the statute\nprecludes him from invoking the Geneva Conventions in the manner\nthe Solicitor General’s question describes and the Eleventh Circuit\nheld, the statute would violate the Suspension Clause. See supra, at\n6−7. Thus, the Suspension Clause issue may in this case fairly be\nviewed as implicit in the statutory question presented.\n</pre>", "id": 2151, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2010/01/25/Noriega_v._Pastrana.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                  Cite as: 559 U.

The\nfirst is the extent, if any, to which provisions like Section 5\naffect 28 U. S. C. §2241 in a manner that implicates the\nconstitutional guarantee of habeas corpus. The second is\nwhether the Geneva Conventions are self-executing and\njudicially enforceable.\n   It is incumbent upon us to provide what guidance we\ncan on these issues now. Whatever conclusion we reach,\nour opinion will help the political branches and the courts\ndischarge their responsibilities over detainee cases, and\nwill spare detainees and the Government years of unnec\nessary litigation. These considerations alone justify re\nview. That petitioner was convicted in federal court\n(rather than in a military commission) in criminal pro\nceedings uncomplicated by classified information or issues\nrelating to extraterritorial detention is an additional\nreason to grant certiorari.

S. custody. See United States v. Noriega,\nNo. 88−0079−CR, 2007 WL 2947572 (SD Fla., Aug. 24,\n2007).

The District Judge found that the hostilities in\nPanama constituted an “ ‘armed conflict’ ” within the meaning of Article\n2 of the Third Geneva Convention, that Noriega was a member of the\narmed forces of a party to the conflict under Article 4 of the Third\nConvention, and that the District Court was a “ ‘competent tribunal’ ” to\ndetermine Noriega’s POW status under Article 5 of the Third Conven\ntion. See id., at 793–796. Accordingly, the court concluded that,\nnotwithstanding various separation-of-powers and justiciability con\ncerns, “Noriega is in fact a prisoner of war as defined by Geneva III,\nand as such must be afforded the protections established by the treaty”\nwhile in federal custody. Id., at 796. The court then identified Conven\ntion rights that it believed would govern Noriega’s confinement, see id.,\nat 799–803, and observed that “[w]hether or not those rights can be\nfully provided in a maximum security penitentiary setting is open to\nserious question,” id., at 803.\n4                      NORIEGA v.

Id., at\n*1 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nNoriega then filed the same claims under 28 U. S.

Noriega next\nasserts that, if the Eleventh Circuit’s interpretation of\n§5(a) is correct, the provision violates the Supremacy\nClause, see id., at 11−12, and the Suspension Clause, see\nReply to Brief in Opposition 2. Noriega’s Supremacy\nClause argument is that, to the extent MCA §5(a) governs\nhis Geneva Convention claims, the provision impermissi\nbly effects a “complete repudiation” of the treaty. Pet. for\nCert. 11. The Government responds that this argument\nsuffers from two fatal flaws. First, this Court has held\nthat a treaty, which is “ ‘primarily a compact between\nindependent nations,’ ” remains in force as the supreme\nlaw of the land even where its enforcement is left to “in\nternational negotiations” rather than “domestic courts.”\nBrief in Opposition 7 (quoting Head Money Cases, 112\nU. S. 580, 598 (1884)); see Medellín, supra, at 505, and\nn. 3. Second, “[w]hatever the domestic effect of the Third\nGeneva Convention before the enactment of the MCA,”\nthis Court has held that ‘it is within Congress’ power to\nchange domestic law, even if the law originally arose from\na self-executing treaty.’ ” Brief in Opposition 7 (quoting\nNoriega, supra, at 1295–1296); see also Medellín, supra, at\n509, n. 5. Accordingly, the Government agrees with the\nEleventh Circuit that MCA §5(a) “does not change the\ninternational obligations of the United States under the\nGeneva Conventions,” but does “supersed[e] whatever\ndomestic effect the Geneva Conventions may have had in\nactions such as this.” Brief in Opposition 7–8 (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted).         That brings\nNoriega to his Suspension Clause argument. He replies\nthat, if MCA §5(a) operates in the manner the Govern\nment describes and the Eleventh Circuit held, the provi\nsion is unconstitutional under Boumediene because it\n“effectively works a suspension of the writ.” Reply to Brief\nin Opposition 2 (asserting that “to divorce the writ from\n8                   NORIEGA v. PASTRANA\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthe law is to destroy the writ”).\n                              II\n   As the Eleventh Circuit’s opinion makes clear, the\nthreshold question in this case is whether MCA §5(a) is\nvalid. Answering that question this Term would provide\ncourts and the political branches with much needed guid\nance on issues we left open in Boumediene. See Boumedi­\nene, 553 U. S, at ___, ___ (slip op. at 64−66, 68−70). Pro\nviding that guidance in this case would allow us to say\nwhat the law is without the unnecessary delay and other\ncomplications that could burden a decision on these ques\ntions in Guantanamo or other detainee litigation arising\nout of the conflict with Al Qaeda.\n   Boumediene invalidated MCA §7’s attempt to strip\nfederal courts of habeas jurisdiction over claims by a\nspecified class of non-citizen detainees (“unlawful enemy\ncombatants”), but did not determine the “content of the\nlaw that governs petitioners’ detention,” id., at ___ (slip\nop. at 69), or the extent to which §2241’s substantive\nprovisions affect the constitutional “procedural protections\nof habeas corpus,” id., at ___ (slip op. at 70). Section 2241\nbroadly confers jurisdiction over a habeas corpus action by\nany person who claims to be held “in custody in violation\nof the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United\nStates.” See Rasul v. Bush, 542 U. S. 466, 473 (2004).\nMCA §5(a) eliminates the Geneva Conventions as a source\nof rights upon which §2241 petitioners may rely in chal\nlenging their detentions. Statutory amendments to an\nexisting law ordinarily involve nothing more than a valid\nexercise of Congress’ Article I authority. See, e.g., Chew\nHeong v. United States, 112 U. S. 536, 562–563 (1884).\nNoriega asserts that the difference in this case is that the\nstatutory amendment narrows the scope of §2241. Assum\ning that is correct, the indeterminate interplay between\nthe constitutional and statutory guarantees of habeas\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

Only we can\ndetermine whether the Eleventh Circuit correctly rejected\nthat argument.\n   The Suspension Clause provides that “[t]he Privilege of\nthe Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless\nwhen in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety\nmay require it.” U. S. Const., Art. I, §9, cl. 2. Because the\nClause addresses only the suspension—not the content or\nexistence—of the “Privilege of the Writ,” ibid., we have\nlong recognized the “obligation” the first Congress “must\nhave felt” to “provid[e] efficient means by which this great\nconstitutional privilege should receive life and activity.”\nEx parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75, 95 (1807). But we have\nalso steadfastly declined to adopt a date of reference by\nwhich the writ’s constitutional content, if any, is to be\njudged, see Boumediene, supra, ___ (slip op. at 15−17), and\nthus have left open the question whether statutory efforts\nto limit §2241 implicate the Suspension Clause, see, e.g.,\nINS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 300–301 (2001). This ques\ntion, which has already divided the Court in other con\ntexts, see ibid.,8 is clearly presented here. Noriega asserts\n——————\n  8 Compare  St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 300–301 (2001) (declining to identify\na specific date of reference for judging the constitutional scope of the\nwrit, but concluding that the Court nonetheless should construe the\nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996\n(IIRIRA) to allow §2241 jurisdiction over certain habeas petitions\nbecause doing so would avoid the Suspension Clause question that\notherwise would arise), with id., at 335–341 (SCALIA, J., dissenting)\n(emphasizing that, although IIRIRA displaces §2241 jurisdiction\nunambiguously and thus renders the canon of constitutional avoidance\ninapplicable, there is no constitutional question to avoid, because the\nSuspension Clause is addressed only to suspension (i.e., temporary\nwithholding of the operation) of the writ on the terms authorized by the\nhabeas corpus statute, not to Congress’ power to alter the substance of\nthe habeas rights the statute confers) and id., at 340−341, n. 5 (“If, as\n10                    NORIEGA v.

The Eleventh Circuit, however, saw no\nconstitutional problem with the statute and upheld it as\nvalid and distinguishable from the provision deemed\nunconstitutional in Boumediene. See 564 F. 3d, at 1294.\n  Addressing Noriega’s challenge to the Eleventh Circuit’s\ndecision would resolve the important statutory and consti\ntutional questions here and would guide courts and the\npolitical branches in addressing the same and similar\nissues in other detainee cases. See, e.g., Al-Bihani, supra,\nat *5 (“The Supreme Court has provided scant guidance on\nthese questions, consciously leaving the contours of the\nsubstantive and procedural law of detention open for lower\ncourts to shape in a common law fashion.”). Recent court\ndecisions, as well as recent Executive Branch court filings\nand policy determinations, specifically invoke the Geneva\nConventions as part of the law that governs detainee\ntreatment in the United States and abroad. For example,\nin September 2009, the U.S. District Court for the District\nof Columbia issued a redacted version of a classified\nmemorandum opinion in which it granted habeas corpus\nrelief in the oldest of the pending Guantanamo cases\nbecause the petitioner’s indefinite detention was based\n“almost exclusively” on unreliable “confessions” obtained\n“using abusive techniques that violated the Army Field\n——————\nthe Court concedes, the writ could not be suspended within the mean\ning of the Suspension Clause until Congress affirmatively provided for\nhabeas by statute, then surely Congress may subsequently alter what it\nhad initially provided for, lest the Clause become a one-way ratchet.”\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

United\nStates, Civ. Action No. 02−828, Unclassified Mem. Op. (DC\nSept. 17, 2009), pp. 1–2, 43.\n   Several recent D. C. Circuit decisions, one of which is\nnow pending before us, similarly implicate the importance\nof the Geneva Convention and MCA §5(a) questions in this\ncase. In Kiyemba v. Obama, 555 F. 3d 1022 (2009) (Ki­\nyemba I), cert. granted, ante, p. ___, the petitioners, Guan\ntanamo detainees who prevailed on their habeas corpus\nclaims in federal court but cannot return to their home\ncountry, rely on the Geneva Conventions in claiming a\nright to be released in the territorial United States, see\nPet. for Cert. in No. 08–1234, pp. i, 34. Although the D. C.\nCircuit did not address MCA §5(a) in rejecting this claim,\nthe Government contends before this Court that MCA\n§5(a) bars petitioners’ reliance on the Conventions, see\nBrief in Opposition in No. 08-1234, pp. 23–24, and Judge\nRogers’ opinion concurring in the D. C. Circuit’s judgment\nrelies upon the same repatriation language in Article 118\nof the Third Convention that Noriega raises here, see 555\nF. 3d, at 1033, n. 2. In Al-Bihani, supra, the D. C. Circuit\ndirectly invokes MCA §5(a) in rejecting a Guantanamo\ndetainee’s claim that he was entitled to habeas corpus\nrelief because his detention violated, inter alia, the Third\nGeneva Convention, see id., at *2–3; *6 (stating that MCA\n§5(a), “a provision not altered by the MCA of 2009, explic\nitly precludes detainees from claiming the Geneva Con\nventions—which include criteria to determine who is\nentitled to P.O.W. status—as a source of rights”). Finally,\nthe D. C. Circuit’s decision in Kiyemba v. Obama, 561\nF. 3d 509 (2009) (Kiyemba II), implicates the issues here\nin holding, contrary to several recent district court deci\nsions,9 that another MCA provision (MCA §7(a)(2), codified\n——————\n 9 See   Khadr v.

Recent Executive Branch\nOrders and court filings cite the Conventions in articulat\ning the legal standards that govern detainee treatment.\nSee, e.g., Exec. Order No. 13491, §3, 74 Fed. Reg. 4894\n(2009) (making “Common Article 3 standards” the “mini\nmum baseline” for the treatment of any individual who, in\nthe course of “any armed conflict,” comes into the “custody\nor under the effective control of an officer, employee, or\nother agent of the United States” or is “detained within a\nfacility owned, operated, or controlled by a department or\nagency of the United States”); Brief for United States in\nMisc.

Elsea, K. Thomas, & M. Garcia, CRS Report for Con\n\ngress, Enemy Combatant Detainees: Habeas Corpus Challenges in\nFederal Court, 36, 41-43 (2009).\n   12 Because the D. C. Circuit’s majority opinion in Kiyemba I does not\n\naddress MCA §5(a), the provision’s validity is not squarely presented in\nthat case. See Kiyemba v. Obama, 555 F. 3d 1022 (CADC 2009) (Ki­\nyemba I), cert. granted, ante, p. ___ (2009). And granting review of the\nD. C. Circuit’s decision in Al-Bihani, which does address MCA §5(a),\nwould not guarantee a decision on the statute’s validity. See Al-Bihani\nv. Obama, No. 09−5051, 2010 WL 10411 (CADC 2010). Al-Bihani\naddresses MCA §5(a) in rejecting only one of many claims for habeas\ncorpus relief, so it is not clear that the Court would need to address the\nstatute’s validity in deciding the case. And even if the Court were to\naddress §5(a), the decision would come next Term, thus providing no\nguidance to courts that must adjudicate pending habeas corpus actions\nthis spring and summer. In contrast, addressing MCA §5(a)’s validity\nin this case would timely provide such guidance. Doing so could also\naid our disposition of Kiyemba I because answering the questions\npresented here could clarify the constitutional scope of the writ of\nhabeas corpus in a manner that could affect the Kiyemba I petitioners’\nargument about the inherent remedial power of habeas corpus courts.\nSee Pet. for Cert. in No. 08–1234, pp. 14–16, 22–23; see generally\nKiyemba I, 555 F. 3d, at 1026–1027; St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 335–340\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n14                     NORIEGA v. PASTRANA\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n(as they did here) with Geneva Convention claims in\nhabeas corpus proceedings.13 And, it would give the politi\ncal branches a clearer sense of the constitutional limits to\nwhich new legislative or policy initiatives must adhere.\nThe latter benefit would also follow if we were to invali\ndate MCA §5(a). In addition, such a ruling could well\nallow us to reach the question we left open in Hamdan—\nwhether the Geneva Conventions are self-executing and\njudicially enforceable—because this case is not governed\nby the Uniform Code of Military Justice provisions on\nwhich the Hamdan majority relied in holding Common\nArticle III applicable to the proceedings in that case. See\nHamdan, 548 U. S., at 627–628; see also id., at 637, 642–\n643 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part). Finally, if the\nCourt were to conclude that the Conventions are self\nexecuting and judicially enforceable in habeas corpus\nproceedings, this case would present two additional ques\ntions relevant to noncitizen detainee litigation: whether\nfederal courts may classify such detainees as POWs under\nthe Third Convention, and whether any of the Conven\ntions requires the United States immediately to repatriate\ndetainees entitled to release from U. S. custody.14\n   Against these considerations, the Government pro\nvides no compelling reason to decline review.15 Accord\n——————\n   13 MCA §5(a) applies not only to individuals who, like Noriega, have\n\n(rightly or not) been designated POWs, but also to “any person” who\ninvokes the Conventions as a source of rights in any “habeas or other\ncivil action” to which the United States is a party, see 120 Stat. 2631,\nnote following 28 U. S. C. §2241.\n   14 Both questions are subsumed in the second question in the Solicitor\n\nGeneral’s brief: “[w]hether, assuming petitioner can assert a claim\nbased on the Geneva Convention, his extradition to France would\nviolate the Convention.” Brief in Opposition i.\n   15 The Solicitor General’s principal ground for opposing certiorari is\n\nthat the Eleventh Circuit’s decision does not conflict with the decision\nof any other Circuit. See Brief in Opposition 6. That is true but not\nsurprising. The original version of the MCA is only three years old and,\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

Accordingly, the lack of a circuit split on the ques\ntion whether MCA §5(a) bars POWs in federal custody in the United\nStates from invoking the Geneva Conventions in habeas proceedings\ndoes not negate the compelling reasons to grant review. Indeed, the\nCourt has taken cases in this area without the benefit of any opinion\nfrom a court of appeals, see Ex parte Quirin, supra, and in splitless\ncases involving rare facts and ongoing diplomatic negotiations, see\nKiyemba I, ante, p. ___. The Court has also granted review of separa\ntion-of-powers and other important legal questions on records far less\ndeveloped than that here, see, e.g., Robertson v. United States ex rel.\nWatson, ante, p. ___; Christian Legal Soc. Chapter of Univ. of Cal.\nHasting College of Law v. Martinez, ante, p. ___; on petitions that have\nrequired us to reformulate the questions presented, see, e.g., Robertson,\nsupra; Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 555 U. S. ___ (2009); and even\non petitions we initially denied, see Boumediene v. Bush, 551 U. S. 1160\n(2007). The Solicitor General also claims (again based on the fact that\nNoriega is “currently” the only POW in U. S. custody) that review is not\nwarranted because the Eleventh Circuit’s decision is of “limited ongoing\nsignificance.” Ibid. This assertion is not persuasive for the reasons set\nforth above.\n   16 As noted, the Solicitor General’s first question presented is whether\n\nMCA §5(a) “precludes petitioner from invoking” the Third Geneva\nConvention “as a source of rights in a habeas corpus proceeding.” Brief\nin Opposition i. Such statutory questions do not automatically, or even\ntypically, require a court to consider the statute’s constitutionality.\nHere, however, Noriega has consistently argued that, if the statute\nprecludes him from invoking the Geneva Conventions in the manner\nthe Solicitor General’s question describes and the Eleventh Circuit\nheld, the statute would violate the Suspension Clause. See supra, at\n6−7. Thus, the Suspension Clause issue may in this case fairly be\nviewed as implicit in the statutory question presented.\n", "precedential_status": "Relating-to", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2151/", "sha1": "a74addba9c360456dadd5072cd78a5d865bded01", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-04-20T17:03:26"}
