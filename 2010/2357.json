Argued January 13, 2010—Decided April 21, 2010\nThe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U. S. C. §1692 et\n  seq., imposes civil liability on “debt collector[s]” for certain prohibited\n  debt collection practices. A debt collector who “fails to comply with\n  any [FDCPA] provision . . . with respect to any person is liable to\n  such person” for “actual damage[s],” costs, “a reasonable attorney’s\n  fee as determined by the court,” and statutory “additional damages.”\n  §1692k(a). In addition, violations of the FDCPA are deemed unfair or\n  deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act\n  (FTC Act), §41 et seq., which is enforced by the Federal Trade Com\n  mission (FTC). See §1692l. A debt collector who acts with “actual\n  knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective cir\n  cumstances that such act is [prohibited under the FDCPA]” is subject\n  to civil penalties enforced by the FTC. §§45(m)(1)(A), (C). A debt col\n  lector is not liable in any action brought under the FDCPA, however,\n  if it “shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not\n  intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the\n  maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such er\n  ror.” §1692k(c).\n     Respondents, a law firm and one of its attorneys (collectively Car\n  lisle), filed a lawsuit in Ohio state court on behalf of a mortgage com\n  pany to foreclose a mortgage on real property owned by petitioner\n  Jerman. The complaint included a notice that the mortgage debt\n  would be assumed valid unless Jerman disputed it in writing. Jer\n  man’s lawyer sent a letter disputing the debt, and, when the mort\n  gage company acknowledged that the debt had in fact been paid, Car\n  lisle withdrew the suit. Jerman then filed this action, contending\n  that by sending the notice requiring her to dispute the debt in writ\n2               JERMAN v.

The District Court, acknowledging a\n    division of authority on the question, held that Carlisle had violated\n    §1692g(a) but ultimately granted Carlisle summary judgment under\n    §1692k(c)’s “bona fide error” defense. The Sixth Circuit affirmed,\n    holding that the defense in §1692k(c) is not limited to clerical or fac\n    tual errors, but extends to mistakes of law.\nHeld: The bona fide error defense in §1692k(c) does not apply to a viola\n tion resulting from a debt collector’s mistaken interpretation of the\n legal requirements of the FDCPA. Pp. 6–30.\n    (a) A violation resulting from a debt collector’s misinterpretation of\n the legal requirements of the FDCPA cannot be “not intentional” un\n der §1692k(c). It is a common maxim that “ignorance of the law will\n not excuse any person, either civilly or criminally.” Barlow v. United\n States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130084\"><a href=\"/opinion/130084/barlow-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">404</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 411. When Congress has intended to provide a\n mistake-of-law defense to civil liability, it has often done so more ex\n plicitly than here. In particular, the administrative-penalty provi\n sions of the FTC Act, which are expressly incorporated into the\n FDCPA, apply only when a debt collector acts with “actual knowledge\n or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances”\n that the FDCPA prohibited its action. §§45(m)(1)(A), (C). Given the\n absence of similar language in §1692k(c), it is fair to infer that Con\n gress permitted injured consumers to recover damages for “inten\n tional” conduct, including violations resulting from a mistaken inter\n pretation of the FDCPA, while reserving the more onerous\n administrative penalties for debt collectors whose intentional actions\n reflected knowledge that the conduct was prohibited. Congress also\n did not confine FDCPA liability to “willful” violations, a term more of\n ten understood in the civil context to exclude mistakes of law. See,\n e.g., Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 125–126.\n Section 1692k(c)’s requirement that a debt collector maintain “proce\n dures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error” also more natu\n rally evokes procedures to avoid mistakes like clerical or factual er\n rors. Pp. 6–12.\n    (b) Additional support for this reading is found in the statute’s con\n text and history. The FDCPA’s separate protection from liability for\n “any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any [FTC]\n advisory opinion,” §1692k(e), is more obviously tailored to the con\n cern at issue (excusing civil liability when the FDCPA’s prohibitions\n are uncertain) than the bona fide error defense. Moreover, in enact\n ing the FDCPA in 1977, Congress copied the pertinent portions of the\n bona fide error defense from the Truth in Lending Act (TILA),\n §1640(c). At that time, the three Federal Courts of Appeals to have\n considered the question interpreted the TILA provision as referring\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  to clerical errors, and there is no reason to suppose Congress dis\n  agreed with those interpretations when it incorporated TILA’s lan\n  guage into the FDCPA. Although in 1980 Congress amended the de\n  fense in TILA, but not in the FDCPA, to exclude errors of legal\n  judgment, it is not obvious that amendment changed the scope of the\n  TILA defense in a way material here, given the prior uniform judicial\n  interpretation of that provision. It is also unclear why Congress\n  would have intended the FDCPA’s defense to be broader than TILA’s,\n  and Congress has not expressly included mistakes of law in any of\n  the parallel bona fide error defenses elsewhere in the U. S. Code.\n  Carlisle’s reading is not supported by Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S.\n  291, 292, which had no occasion to address the overall scope of the\n  FDCPA bona fide error defense, and which did not depend on the\n  premise that a misinterpretation of the requirements of the FDCPA\n  would fall under that provision. Pp. 13–22.\n     (c) Today’s decision does not place unmanageable burdens on debt\n  collecting lawyers. The FDCPA contains several provisions expressly\n  guarding against abusive lawsuits, and gives courts discretion in cal\n  culating additional damages and attorney’s fees. Lawyers have re\n  course to the bona fide error defense in §1692k(c) when a violation\n  results from a qualifying factual error. To the extent the FDCPA im\n  poses some constraints on a lawyer’s advocacy on behalf of a client, it\n  is not unique; lawyers have a duty, for instance, to comply with the\n  law and standards of professional conduct. Numerous state con\n  sumer protection and debt collection statutes contain bona fide error\n  defenses that are either silent as to, or expressly exclude, legal er\n  rors. To the extent lawyers face liability for mistaken interpretations\n  of the FDCPA, Carlisle and its amici have not shown that “the result\n  [will be] so absurd as to warrant” disregarding the weight of textual\n  authority. Heintz, supra, at 295. Absent such a showing, arguments\n  that the FDCPA strikes an undesirable balance in assigning the risks\n  of legal misinterpretation are properly addressed to Congress.\n  Pp. 22–30.\n538 F. 3d 469, reversed and remanded.\n\n  SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

CARLISLE, MC-\n\n   NELLIE, RINI, KRAMER & ULRICH LPA, ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [April 21, 2010]\n\n\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA or Act)\nimposes civil liability on “debt collector[s]” for certain\nprohibited debt collection practices. Section 813(c) of the\nAct, 15 U. S. C. §1692k(c), provides that a debt collector is\nnot liable in an action brought under the Act if she can\nshow “the violation was not intentional and resulted from\na bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of\nprocedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.”\nThis case presents the question whether the “bona fide\nerror” defense in §1692k(c) applies to a violation resulting\nfrom a debt collector’s mistaken interpretation of the legal\nrequirements of the FDCPA. We conclude it does not.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n   Congress enacted the FDCPA in 1977, 91 Stat. 874, to\neliminate abusive debt collection practices, to ensure that\ndebt collectors who abstain from such practices are not\ncompetitively disadvantaged, and to promote consistent\nstate action to protect consumers. 15 U. S. C. §1692(e).\nThe Act regulates interactions between consumer debtors\n2          JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nand “debt collector[s],” defined to include any person who\n“regularly collects . . . debts owed or due or asserted to be\nowed or due another.” §§1692a(5), (6). Among other\nthings, the Act prohibits debt collectors from making false\nrepresentations as to a debt’s character, amount, or legal\nstatus, §1692e(2)(A); communicating with consumers at an\n“unusual time or place” likely to be inconvenient to the\nconsumer, §1692c(a)(1); or using obscene or profane lan\nguage or violence or the threat thereof, §§1692d(1), (2).\nSee generally §§1692b–1692j; Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S.\n291, 292–293 (1995).\n   The Act is enforced through administrative action and\nprivate lawsuits. With some exceptions not relevant here,\nviolations of the FDCPA are deemed to be unfair or decep\ntive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission\nAct (FTC Act), 15 U. S. C. §41 et seq., and are enforced by\nthe Federal Trade Commission (FTC). See §1692l. As a\nresult, a debt collector who acts with “actual knowledge or\nknowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circum\nstances that such act is [prohibited under the FDCPA]” is\nsubject to civil penalties of up to $16,000 per day.\n§§45(m)(1)(A), (C); 74 Fed. Reg. 858 (2009) (amending 16\nCFR §1.98(d)).\n   The FDCPA also provides that “any debt collector who\nfails to comply with any provision of th[e] [Act] with re\nspect to any person is liable to such person.” 15 U. S. C.\n§1692k(a). Successful plaintiffs are entitled to “actual\ndamage[s],” plus costs and “a reasonable attorney’s fee as\ndetermined by the court.” Ibid. A court may also award\n“additional damages,” subject to a statutory cap of $1,000\nfor individual actions, or, for class actions, “the lesser of\n$500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the debt\ncollector.” §1692k(a)(2). In awarding additional damages,\nthe court must consider “the frequency and persistence of\n[the debt collector’s] noncompliance,” “the nature of such\nnoncompliance,” and “the extent to which such noncompli\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nance was intentional.” §1692k(b).\n   The Act contains two exceptions to provisions imposing\nliability on debt collectors. Section 1692k(c), at issue here,\nprovides that\n    “[a] debt collector may not be held liable in any action\n    brought under [the FDCPA] if the debt collector shows\n    by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was\n    not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error\n    notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures rea\n    sonably adapted to avoid any such error.”\nThe Act also states that none of its provisions imposing\nliability shall apply to “any act done or omitted in good\nfaith in conformity with any advisory opinion of the [Fed\neral Trade] Commission.” §1692k(e).\n                             B\n  Respondents in this case are a law firm, Carlisle,\nMcNellie, Rini, Kramer & Ulrich, L. P. A., and one of its\nattorneys, Adrienne S. Foster (collectively Carlisle). In\nApril 2006, Carlisle filed a complaint in Ohio state court\non behalf of a client, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.\nCarlisle sought foreclosure of a mortgage held by Coun\ntrywide in real property owned by petitioner Karen L.\nJerman. The complaint included a “Notice,” later served\non Jerman, stating that the mortgage debt would be as\nsumed to be valid unless Jerman disputed it in writing.\nJerman’s lawyer sent a letter disputing the debt, and\nCarlisle sought verification from Countrywide. When\nCountrywide acknowledged that Jerman had, in fact,\nalready paid the debt in full, Carlisle withdrew the fore\nclosure lawsuit.\n  Jerman then filed her own lawsuit seeking class certifi\ncation and damages under the FDCPA, contending that\nCarlisle violated §1692g by stating that her debt would be\n4             JERMAN v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 695–697 (ND Ohio 2007). The Court\nof Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. 538 F. 3d 469\n(2008). Acknowledging that the Courts of Appeals are\ndivided regarding the scope of the bona fide error defense,\nand that the “majority view is that the defense is available\nfor clerical and factual errors only,” the Sixth Circuit\nnonetheless held that §1692k(c) extends to “mistakes of\nlaw.” Id., at 473–476 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe Court of Appeals found “nothing unusual” about\nattorney debt collectors maintaining “procedures” within\nthe meaning of §1692k(c) to avoid mistakes of law. Id., at\n476. Noting that a parallel bona fide error defense in the\n——————\n  1 Section 1692g(a)(3) requires a debt collector, within five days of an\n\n“initial communication” about the collection of a debt, to send the\nconsumer a written notice containing, inter alia, “a statement that\nunless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice,\ndisputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be\nassumed to be valid by the debt collector.”\n  2 The District Court distinguished, for instance, Graziano v. Harrison,\n\n950 F. 2d 107, 112 (CA3 1991), which held a consumer’s dispute of a\ndebt under §1692g must be in writing to be effective. Noting that\ndistrict courts within the Sixth Circuit had reached different results,\nand distinguishing one unpublished Sixth Circuit decision which\nCarlisle suggested approved a form with an in-writing requirement, the\ncourt adopted the reasoning from Camacho v. Bridgeport Financial,\nInc., 430 F. 3d 1078, 1080–1082 (CA9 2005), and held that the plain\nlanguage of §1692g does not impose an “in writing” requirement on\nconsumers. See 464 F.

We likewise ex\npress no view about whether inclusion of an “in writing” requirement in\na notice to a consumer violates §1692g, as that question was not pre\nsented in the petition for certiorari. Compare Graziano, supra, at 112\n(reading §1692g(a)(3) to require that “any dispute, to be effective, must\nbe in writing”), with Camacho, supra, at 1082 (under §1692g(a)(3),\n“disputes need not be made in writing”).\n   4 Compare, e.g., 538 F. 3d, at 476 (case below), with Baker v. G. C.\n\nServs. Corp., 677 F. 2d 775, 779 (CA9 1982), and Hulshizer v. Global\nCredit Servs., Inc., 728 F. 2d 1037, 1038 (CA8 1984) (per curiam).\n   The Courts of Appeals have also expressed different views about\nwhether 15 U. S. C. §1692k(c) applies to violations of the FDCPA\nresulting from a misinterpretation of the requirements of state law.\nCompare Johnson v. Riddle, 305 F. 3d 1107, 1121 (CA10 2002) (con\ncluding that §1692k(c) applies where a debt collector’s misinterpreta\ntion of a Utah dishonored check statute resulted in a violation of\n§1692f(1), which prohibits collection of any amount not “permitted by\nlaw”), with Picht v. Jon R. Hawks, Ltd., 236 F. 3d 446, 451–452 (CA8\n2001) (stating that §1692k(c) does not preclude FDCPA liability result\ning from a creditor’s mistaken legal interpretation of a Minnesota\ngarnishment statute). The parties disagree about whether §1692k(c)\napplies when a violation results from a debt collector’s misinterpreta\ntion of the legal requirements of state law or federal law other than the\nFDCPA. Compare Brief for Petitioner 47–49, with Brief for Respon\ndents 60–62. Because this case involves only an alleged misinterpreta\ntion of the requirements of the FDCPA, we need not, and do not, reach\nthose other questions.\n6             JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                   KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             II \n\n                             A\n\n   The parties disagree about whether a “violation” result\ning from a debt collector’s misinterpretation of the legal\nrequirements of the FDCPA can ever be “not intentional”\nunder §1692k(c). Jerman contends that when a debt\ncollector intentionally commits the act giving rise to the\nviolation (here, sending a notice that included the “in\nwriting” language), a misunderstanding about what the\nAct requires cannot render the violation “not intentional,”\ngiven the general rule that mistake or ignorance of law is\nno defense. Carlisle and the dissent, in contrast, argue\nthat nothing in the statutory text excludes legal errors\nfrom the category of “bona fide error[s]” covered by\n§1692k(c) and note that the Act refers not to an uninten\ntional “act” but rather an unintentional “violation.” The\nlatter term, they contend, evinces Congress’ intent to\nimpose liability only when a party knows its conduct is\nunlawful. Carlisle urges us, therefore, to read §1692k(c) to\nencompass “all types of error,” including mistakes of law.\nBrief for Respondents 7.\n   We decline to adopt the expansive reading of §1692k(c)\nthat Carlisle proposes.

In Kolstad v. American\nDental Assn., 527 U.

The Court concluded that the shipment at issue, entered as\n“refined sugars,” was mislabeled under the prevailing meaning of that\nterm and thus was subject to forfeiture “unless the [petitioner] c[ould]\nbring himself within the exceptio[n].” 7 Pet., at 409–410. As there had\nbeen no “accident” or “mistake” of fact, the “only mistake, if there ha[d]\nbeen any, [wa]s a mistake of law.” Id., at 410–411. The Court observed\nthat the shipper’s conduct, even if “entirely compatible with good faith,\n[wa]s not wholly free from the suspicion of an intention to overreach . . .\nby passing off, as refined sugars, what he well knew were not admitted\nto be such.” Id., at 411. But the Court declined to resolve the case on\nthe ground of the shipper’s intent, instead invoking the “common\nmaxim, familiar to all minds, that ignorance of the law will not excuse\nany person, either civilly or criminally.” Ibid. Notwithstanding the\nexistence of a statutory exception—which did not expressly exclude\nlegal errors from the category of “mistake[s]” made without “intention\nto defraud”—the Court saw “not the least reason to suppose that the\nlegislature, in this enactment, had any intention to supersede the\ncommon principle.” Ibid.\n    The dissent implies Barlow is too old to be relevant.

As\nrecently as 1994 this Court cited it for the “venerable principle” that\nignorance of the law generally is no defense. Ratzlaf v. United States,\n510 U. S. 135, 149; see also Cheek v.

Given the\nabsence of similar language in §1692k(c), it is a fair infer\nence that Congress chose to permit injured consumers to\nrecover actual damages, costs, fees, and modest statutory\ndamages for “intentional” conduct, including violations\nresulting from mistaken interpretation of the FDCPA,\nwhile reserving the more onerous penalties of the FTC Act\nfor debt collectors whose intentional actions also reflected\n“knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circum\nstances” that the conduct was prohibited.

As noted, in International Minerals, the Court rejected a\nmistake-of-law defense for a statute that applied to those who “know\ningly violat[e]” certain regulations. 402 U. S., at 559, 563. In so doing,\nhowever, we expressly acknowledged the contrary view adopted by one\nlower court opinion that knowledge of the regulations was necessary.\nId., at 562 (citing St. Johnsbury Trucking Co. v.

The dissent\ning opinion in International Minerals quoted extensively portions of the\nSt. Johnsbury concurrence that reached its result by contrasting a\nstatute making it an offense “ ‘ “knowingly” to sell adulterated milk’ ”\nwith one that makes it an offense “ ‘knowingly [to] violat[e] a regula\ntion.’ ” 402 U.

S., at 428, n. 12, says little\nabout the meaning of a “not intentional” “violation” in 15 U. S. C.\n§1692k(c). Indeed, the statute in Liparota bears a closer resemblance to\nthe administrative penalty provision in §45(m)(1)(A). See supra, at\n8–9.\n12         JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n“actual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis\nof objective circumstances” that particular conduct was\nunlawful. The dissent’s reading gives short shrift to that\ntextual distinction.\n   We draw additional support for the conclusion that bona\nfide errors in §1692k(c) do not include mistaken interpre\ntations of the FDCPA, from the requirement that a debt\ncollector maintain “procedures reasonably adapted to\navoid any such error.” The dictionary defines “procedure”\nas “a series of steps followed in a regular orderly definite\nway.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 1807\n(1976). In that light, the statutory phrase is more natu\nrally read to apply to processes that have mechanical or\nother such “regular orderly” steps to avoid mistakes—for\ninstance, the kind of internal controls a debt collector\nmight adopt to ensure its employees do not communicate\nwith consumers at the wrong time of day, §1692c(a)(1), or\nmake false representations as to the amount of a debt,\n§1692e(2). The dissent, like the Court of Appeals, finds\nnothing unusual in attorney debt collectors maintaining\nprocedures to avoid legal error. Post, at 18; 538 F. 3d, at\n476. We do not dispute that some entities may maintain\nprocedures to avoid legal errors. But legal reasoning is\nnot a mechanical or strictly linear process. For this rea\nson, we find force in the suggestion by the Government (as\namicus curiae supporting Jerman) that the broad statu\ntory requirement of procedures reasonably designed to\navoid “any” bona fide error indicates that the relevant\nprocedures are ones that help to avoid errors like clerical\nor factual mistakes. Such procedures are more likely to\navoid error than those applicable to legal reasoning, par\nticularly in the context of a comprehensive and complex\nfederal statute such as the FDCPA that imposes open\nended prohibitions on, inter alia, “false, deceptive,”\n§1692e, or “unfair” practices, §1692f.

See Dada v. Mu\nkasey, 554 U. S. 1, __ (2008) (slip op., at 13) (“In reading a\nstatute we must not look merely to a particular clause, but\nconsider in connection with it the whole statute” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). As described above, Congress\nincluded in the FDCPA not only the bona fide error de\nfense but also a separate protection from liability for “any\nact done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any\nadvisory opinion of the [FTC].” §1692k(e). In our view,\nthe Court of Appeals’ reading is at odds with the role\nCongress evidently contemplated for the FTC in resolving\nambiguities in the Act. Debt collectors would rarely need\nto consult the FTC if §1692k(c) were read to offer immu\nnity for good-faith reliance on advice from private counsel.\nIndeed, debt collectors might have an affirmative incentive\nnot to seek an advisory opinion to resolve ambiguity in the\nlaw, as receipt of such advice would prevent them from\nclaiming good-faith immunity for violations and would\npotentially trigger civil penalties for knowing violations\nunder the FTC Act.8 More importantly, the existence of a\nseparate provision that, by its plain terms, is more obvi\nously tailored to the concern at issue (excusing civil liabil\nity when the Act’s prohibitions are uncertain) weighs\nagainst stretching the language of the bona fide error\n——————\n  8 One  of Carlisle’s amici suggests the FTC safe harbor would provide\na more categorical immunity than §1692k(c), obviating the need, e.g., to\nmaintain “procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.”\nBrief for National Association of Retail Collection Attorneys as Amicus\nCuriae 18–19 (NARCA Brief). Even if that is true, we need not con\nclude that the FTC safe harbor would be rendered entirely superfluous\nto reason that the existence of that provision counsels against extend\ning the bona fide error defense to serve an overlapping function.\n14             JERMAN v.

TILA, 82 Stat. 146, was the first of several stat\nutes collectively known as the Consumer Credit Protection\nAct (CCPA) that now include the FDCPA. As enacted in\n1968, §130(c) of TILA provided an affirmative defense that\nwas in pertinent part identical to the provision Congress\nlater enacted into the FDCPA: “A creditor may not be held\nliable in any action brought under [TILA] if the creditor\nshows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation\nwas not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error\nnotwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasona\nbly adapted to avoid any such error.” 82 Stat. 157 (codi\nfied at 15 U. S. C. §1640(c)).\n   During the 9-year period between the enactment of\nTILA and passage of the FDCPA, the three Federal Courts\nof Appeals to consider the question interpreted TILA’s\nbona fide error defense as referring to clerical errors; no\nsuch court interpreted TILA to extend to violations result\ning from a mistaken legal interpretation of that Act.10 We\n——————\n  9 Carlisle   raises concerns about whether, in light of contemporary\nadministrative practice, the FTC safe harbor is a realistic way for debt\ncollectors and their lawyers to seek guidance on the numerous time\nsensitive legal issues that arise in litigation.

For several reasons, we\ndecline to give the 1980 TILA amendment such interpreta\ntive weight. For one, it is not obvious that the amendment\nchanged the scope of TILA’s bona fide error defense in a\nway material to our analysis, given the uniform interpre\ntations of three Courts of Appeals holding that the TILA\ndefense does not extend to mistakes of law.12 (Contrary to\n\n——————\n  12 Although  again not necessary to our conclusion, evidence from the\nlegislative record suggests some Members of Congress understood the\namendment to “clarif[y]” the meaning of TILA’s bona fide error defense\n“to make clear that it applies to mechanical and computer errors,\nprovided they are not the result of erroneous legal judgments as to the\nact’s requirements.” S. Rep. No. 96–73, pp. 7–8 (1979); see also Lock\nhart, 153 A. L. R. Fed. 211–212, §2[a] (1999) (amendment “was in\ntended merely to clarify what was then the prevailing view, that the\nbona fide error defense applies to clerical errors, not including errors of\nlegal judgment”) (relying on S. Rep. No. 96–368, p. 32 (1979)).\n   The concurring and dissenting opinions perceive an inconsistency\nbetween these references to clerical errors, as well as similar references\nin the pre-FDCPA precedents interpreting TILA, n. 10, supra, and\nreading the FDCPA’s bona fide error defense to include factual mis\ntakes. Post, at 2–4, and n. 2 (opinion of SCALIA, J.); post, at 20\n(KENNEDY, J., dissenting). The quoted legislative history sources,\nhowever, while stating expressly that the TILA defense excludes legal\nerrors, do not discuss a distinction between clerical and factual errors.\nSimilarly, the cited cases interpreting TILA do not address a distinction\nbetween factual and clerical errors; rather, the courts were presented\nwith claims that the defense applied to mistakes of law or other nonfac\ntual errors that the courts found not to be bona fide. See Ives, 522\nF. 2d, at 756–757; Haynes, 503 F. 2d, at 1166–1167; Palmer, 502 F. 2d,\nat 861. While factual mistakes might, in some circumstances, consti\ntute bona fide errors and give rise to violations that are “not inten\ntional” within the meaning of §1692k(c), we need not and do not decide\ntoday the precise distinction between clerical and factual errors, or\nwhat kinds of factual mistakes qualify under the FDCPA’s bona fide\nerror defense. Cf. generally R. Hobbs, National Consumer Law Center,\nFair Debt Collection §7.2 (6th ed. 2008 and Supp. 2009) (surveying case\nlaw on scope of §1692k(c)).\n18            JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                   KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthe dissent’s suggestion, post, at 21, this reading does not\nrender the 1980 amendment surplusage. Congress may\nsimply have intended to codify existing judicial interpreta\ntions to remove any potential for doubt in jurisdictions\nwhere courts had not yet addressed the issue.) It is also\nunclear why Congress would have intended the FDCPA’s\ndefense to be broader than the one in TILA, which pre\nsents at least as significant a set of concerns about impos\ning liability for uncertain legal obligations. See, e.g., Ford\nMotor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, 444 U. S. 555, 566 (1980)\n(TILA is “ ‘highly technical’ ”). Our reluctance to give\ncontrolling weight to the TILA amendment in construing\nthe FDCPA is reinforced by the fact that Congress has not\nexpressly included mistakes of law in any of the numerous\nbona fide error defenses, worded in pertinent part identi\ncally to §1692k(c), elsewhere in the U. S. Code. Compare,\ne.g., 12 U. S. C. §4010(c)(2) (bona fide error defense in\nExpedited Funds Availability Act expressly excluding “an\nerror of legal judgment with respect to [obligations under\nthat Act]”) with 15 U. S. C. §§1693m(c), 1693h(c) (bona\nfide error provisions in the Electronic Fund Transfer Act\nthat are silent as to errors of legal judgment).13 Although\n\n——————\n  13 The Government observes that several federal agencies have con\n\nstrued similar bona fide error defenses in statutes they administer to\nexclude errors of law. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28–\n30. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, for instance,\nhas promulgated regulations specifying that the bona fide error defense\nin the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, 12 U. S. C.\n§2607(d)(3), does not apply to “[a]n error of legal judgment,” 24 CFR\n§3500.15(b)(1)(ii) (2009). While administrative interpretations of other\nstatutes do not control our reading of the FDCPA, we find it telling that\nno agency has adopted the view of the Court of Appeals. Of course,\nnothing in our opinion today addresses the validity of such regulations\nor the authority of agencies interpreting bona fide error provisions in\nother statutes to adopt a different reading. See National Cable &\nTelecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967,\n982–983 (2005).\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCarlisle points out that Congress has amended the\nFDCPA on several occasions without expressly restricting\nthe scope of §1692k(c), that does not suggest Congress\nviewed the statute as having the expansive reading Car\nlisle advances, particularly as not until recently had a\nCourt of Appeals interpreted the bona fide error defense to\ninclude a violation of the FDCPA resulting from a mistake\nof law. See Johnson v. Riddle, 305 F. 3d 1107, 1121–1124,\nand nn. 14–15 (CA10 2002).\n   Carlisle’s reliance on Heintz, 514 U. S. 291, is also un\navailing. We held in that case that the FDCPA’s defini\ntion of “debt collector” includes lawyers who regularly,\nthrough litigation, attempt to collect consumer debts. Id.,\nat 292. We addressed a concern raised by the petitioner\n(as here, a lawyer collecting a debt on behalf of a client)\nthat our reading would automatically render liable “any\nlitigating lawyer who brought, and then lost, a claim\nagainst a debtor,” on the ground that §1692e(5) prohibits a\ndebt collector from making any “ ‘threat to take action that\ncannot legally be taken.’ ” Id., at 295. We expressed skep\nticism that §1692e(5) itself demanded such a result. But\neven assuming the correctness of petitioner’s reading of\n§1692e(5), we suggested that the availability of the bona\nfide error defense meant that the prospect of liability for\nlitigating lawyers was not “so absurd” as to warrant im\nplying a categorical exemption unsupported by the statu\ntory text. Ibid. We had no occasion in Heintz to address\nthe overall scope of the bona fide error defense. Our dis\ncussion of §1692e(5) did not depend on the premise that a\nmisinterpretation of the requirements of the Act would fall\nunder the bona fide error defense. In the mine-run law\nsuit, a lawyer is at least as likely to be unsuccessful be\ncause of factual deficiencies as opposed to legal error.\nLawyers can, of course, invoke §1692k(c) for violations\nresulting from qualifying factual errors.\n   Carlisle’s remaining arguments do not change our view\n20          JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                 KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nof §1692k(c). Carlisle perceives an inconsistency between\nour reading of the term “intentional” in that provision and\nthe instruction in §1692k(b) that a court look to whether\n“noncompliance was intentional” in assessing statutory\nadditional damages. But assuming §1692k(b) encom\npasses errors of law, we see no conflict, only congruence, in\nreading the Act to permit a court to adjust statutory dam\nages for a good-faith misinterpretation of law, even where\na debt collector is not entitled to the categorical protection\nof the bona fide error defense. Carlisle is also concerned\nthat under our reading, §1692k(c) would be unavailable to\na debt collector who violates a provision of the FDCPA\napplying to acts taken with particular intent because in\nsuch instances the relevant act would not be uninten\ntional. See, e.g., §1692d(5) (prohibiting a debt collector\nfrom “[c]ausing a telephone to ring . . . continuously with\nintent to annoy, abuse, or harass”). Including mistakes as\nto the scope of such a prohibition, Carlisle urges, would\nensure that §1692k(c) applied throughout the FDCPA. We\nsee no reason, however, why the bona fide error defense\nmust cover every provision of the Act.\n   The parties and amici make arguments concerning the\nlegislative history that we address for the sake of com\npleteness. Carlisle points to a sentence in a Senate Com\nmittee Report stating that “[a] debt collector has no liabil\nity . . . if he violates the act in any manner, including with\nregard to the act’s coverage, when such violation is unin\ntentional and occurred despite procedures designed to\navoid such violations.” S. Rep. No. 95–382, p. 5 (1977); see\nalso post, at 4–6 (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (discussing report).\nBut by its own terms, the quoted sentence does not unam\nbiguously support Carlisle’s reading. Even if a bona fide\nmistake “with regard to the act’s coverage” could be read\nin isolation to contemplate a mistake of law, that reading\ndoes not exclude mistakes of fact. A mistake “with regard\nto the act’s coverage” may derive wholly from a debt collec\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

There is no reason to\nread this passing statement in the Senate Report as con\ntemplating an exemption for legal error that is the product\nof an attorney’s erroneous interpretation of the FDCPA—\nparticularly when attorneys were excluded from the Act’s\ndefinition of “debt collector” until 1986. 100 Stat. 768.\nMoreover, the reference to “any manner” of violation is\nexpressly qualified by the requirements that the violation\nbe “unintentional” and occur despite maintenance of ap\npropriate procedures. In any event, we need not choose\nbetween these possible readings of the Senate Report, as\nthe legislative record taken as a whole does not lend\nstrong support to Carlisle’s view.14 We therefore decline to\n——————\n  14 For instance, an amendment was proposed and rejected during the\nSenate Banking Committee’s consideration of the FDCPA that would\nhave required proof that a debt collector’s violation was “knowin[g].”\nSenator Riegle, one of the Act’s primary sponsors, opposed the change,\nexplaining that the bill reflected the view that “certain things ought not\nto happen, period. . . . [W]hether somebody does it knowingly, willfully,\nyou know, with a good heart, bad heart, is really quite incidental.” See\nSenate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Markup\nSession: S. 1130—Debt Collection Legislation 60 (July 26, 1977) (here\ninafter Markup); see also ibid. (“We have left a way for these disputes\nto be adj[u]dicated if they are brought, where somebody can say, I\ndidn’t know that, or my computer malfunctioned, something happened,\nI didn’t intend for the effect to be as it was”). To similar effect, a House\nReport on an earlier version of the bill explained the need for new\nlegislation governing use of the mails for debt collection on grounds\nthat existing statutes “frequently require[d]” a showing of “specific\nintent[,] which is difficult to prove.” H. R. Rep. No. 95–131, p. 3 (1977).\nElsewhere, to be sure, the legislative record contains statements more\nsupportive of Carlisle’s interpretation. In particular, a concern was\nraised in the July 26 markup session that the TILA bona fide error\ndefense had been interpreted “as only protecting against a mathemati\ncal error,” and that the FDCPA defense should “go beyond” TILA to\n“allow the courts discretion to dismiss a violation where it was a\ntechnical error.” Markup 20. In response, a staffer explained that the\n22            JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                   KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\ngive controlling weight to this isolated passage.\n                              B\n   Carlisle, its amici, and the dissent raise the additional\nconcern that our reading will have unworkable practical\nconsequences for debt collecting lawyers. See, e.g., Brief\nfor Respondents 40–41, 45–48; NARCA Brief 4–16; post, at\n5–14. Carlisle claims the FDCPA’s private enforcement\nprovisions have fostered a “cottage industry” of profes\nsional plaintiffs who sue debt collectors for trivial viola\ntions of the Act. See Brief for Respondents 40–41. If debt\ncollecting attorneys can be held personally liable for their\nreasonable misinterpretations of the requirements of the\nAct, Carlisle and its amici foresee a flood of lawsuits\nagainst creditors’ lawyers by plaintiffs (and their attor\nneys) seeking damages and attorney’s fees. The threat of\nsuch liability, in the dissent’s view, creates an irreconcil\nable conflict between an attorney’s personal financial\ninterest and her ethical obligation of zealous advocacy on\nbehalf of a client: An attorney uncertain about what the\nFDCPA requires must choose between, on the one hand,\nexposing herself to liability and, on the other, resolving\nthe legal ambiguity against her client’s interest or advis\ning the client to settle—even where there is substantial\nlegal authority for a position favoring the client. Post, at\n10–14.15\n——————\nFDCPA defense would “apply to any violation of the act which was\nunintentional,” and answered affirmatively when the Chairman asked:\n“So it’s not simply a mathematical error but any bona fide error without\nintent?” Id., at 21. Whatever the precise balance of these statements\nmay be, we can conclude that this equivocal evidence from legislative\nhistory does not displace the clear textual and contextual authority\ndiscussed above.\n  15 The dissent also cites several other consumer-protection statutes,\n\nsuch as TILA and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U. S. C. §1681 et\nseq., which in its view create “incentives to file lawsuits even where no\nactual harm has occurred” and are illustrative of what the dissent\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                  23\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   We do not believe our holding today portends such grave\nconsequences. For one, the FDCPA contains several pro\nvisions that expressly guard against abusive lawsuits,\nthereby mitigating the financial risk to creditors’ attor\nneys. When an alleged violation is trivial, the “actual\ndamage[s]” sustained, §1692k(a)(1), will likely be de\nminimis or even zero. The Act sets a cap on “additional”\ndamages, §1692k(a)(2), and vests courts with discretion to\nadjust such damages where a violation is based on a good\nfaith error, §1692k(b). One amicus suggests that attor\nney’s fees may shape financial incentives even where\nactual and statutory damages are modest. NARCA Brief\n11. The statute does contemplate an award of costs and “a\nreasonable attorney’s fee as determined by the court” in\nthe case of “any successful action to enforce the foregoing\nliability.” §1692k(a)(3). But courts have discretion in\ncalculating reasonable attorney’s fees under this statute,16\n——————\nperceives to be a “troubling dynamic of allowing certain actors in the\nsystem to spin even good-faith, technical violations of federal law into\nlucrative litigation.” Post, at 5–6. The dissent’s concern is primarily\nwith Congress’ policy choice, embodied in statutory text, to authorize\nprivate rights of action and recovery of attorney’s fees, costs, and in\nsome cases, both actual and statutory damages. As noted, in one of the\nstatutes the dissent cites, Congress explicitly barred reliance on a\nmistake-of-law defense notwithstanding the “highly technical” nature of\nthe scheme. See 15 U. S. C. §1640(c) (TILA); Ford Motor Credit Co. v.\nMilhollin, 444 U. S. 555, 566 (1980). Similarly, the plain text of the\nFDCPA authorizes a private plaintiff to recover not only “actual dam\nage[s]” for harm suffered but also “such additional damages as the\ncourt may allow,” §1692k(a).\n   16 The Courts of Appeals generally review a District Court’s calcula\n\ntion of an attorney fee award under §1692k for abuse of discretion. See,\ne.g., Carroll v. Wolpoff & Abramson, 53 F. 3d 626, 628–629 (CA4 1995);\nEmanuel v. American Credit Exchange, 870 F. 2d 805, 809 (CA2 1989).\nMany District Courts apply a lodestar method, permitting downward\nadjustments in appropriate circumstances. See, e.g., Schlacher v. Law\nOffices of Phillip J. Rotche & Assoc., P. C., 574 F. 3d 852 (CA7 2009)\n(relying on Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424 (1983)); Ferland v.\nConrad Credit Corp., 244 F. 3d 1145, 1148–1151, and n. 4 (CA9 2001)\n24            JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                   KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\nand §1692k(a)(3) authorizes courts to award attorney’s\nfees to the defendant if a plaintiff’s suit “was brought in\nbad faith and for the purpose of harassment.”\n   Lawyers also have recourse to the affirmative defense in\n§1692k(c). Not every uncertainty presented in litigation\nstems from interpretation of the requirements of the Act\nitself; lawyers may invoke the bona fide error defense, for\ninstance, where a violation results from a qualifying fac\ntual error. Jerman and the Government suggest that\nlawyers can entirely avoid the risk of misinterpreting the\nAct by obtaining an advisory opinion from the FTC under\n§1692k(e). Carlisle fairly observes that the FTC has not\nfrequently issued such opinions, and that the average\nprocessing time may present practical difficulties. Indeed,\nthe Government informed us at oral argument that the\nFTC has issued only four opinions in the past decade (in\nresponse to seven requests), and the FTC’s response time\n——————\n(per curiam); see generally Hobbs, Fair Debt Collection §6.8.6. In\nSchlacher, for instance, the court affirmed a downward adjustment for\nthe “unnecessary use of multiple attorneys . . . in a straightforward,\nshort-lived [FDCPA] case.” 574 F. 3d, at 854–855. In Carroll, the court\nfound no abuse of discretion in a District Court’s award of a $500\nattorney’s fee, rather than the lodestar amount, where the lawsuit had\nrecovered only $50 in damages for “at most a technical violation” of the\nFDCPA. 53 F. 3d, at 629–631.\n  Lower courts have taken different views about when, and whether,\n§1692k requires an award of attorney’s fees. Compare Tolentino v.\nFriedman, 46 F. 3d 645 (CA7 1995) (award of fees to a successful\nplaintiff “mandatory”), and Emanuel, supra, at 808–809 (same, even\nwhere the plaintiff suffered no actual damages), with Graziano, 950 F.\n2d, at 114, and n. 13 (attorney’s fees may be denied for plaintiff’s “bad\nfaith conduct”), and Johnson v. Eaton, 80 F. 3d 148, 150–152 (CA5\n1996) (“attorney’s fees . . . are only available [under §1692k] where the\nplaintiff has succeeded in establishing that the defendant is liable for\nactual and/or additional damages”; this reading “will deter suits\nbrought only as a means of generating attorney’s fees”). We need not\nresolve these issues today to express doubt that our reading\nof §1692k(c) will impose unmanageable burdens on debt collecting\nlawyers.\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

Without disregarding the possibility that the\nFTC advisory opinion process might be useful in some\ncases, evidence of present administrative practice makes\nus reluctant to place significant weight on §1692k(e) as a\npractical remedy for the concerns Carlisle has identified.\n   We are unpersuaded by what seems an implicit premise\nof Carlisle’s arguments: that the bona fide error defense is\na debt collector’s sole recourse to avoid potential liability.\nWe addressed a similar argument in Heintz, in which the\npetitioner urged that certain of the Act’s substantive\nprovisions would generate “ ‘anomalies’ ” if the term “debt\ncollector” was read to include litigating lawyers. 514\nU. S., at 295. Among other things, the petitioner in Heintz\ncontended that §1692c(c)’s bar on further communication\nwith a consumer who notifies a debt collector that she is\nrefusing to pay the debt would prohibit a lawyer from\nfiling a lawsuit to collect the debt. Id., at 296–297. We\nagreed it would be “odd” if the Act interfered in this way\nwith “an ordinary debt-collecting lawsuit” but suggested\n§1692c(c) did not demand such a reading in light of several\nexceptions in the text of that provision itself. Ibid. As in\nHeintz, we need not authoritatively interpret the Act’s\nconduct-regulating provisions to observe that those provi\nsions should not be assumed to compel absurd results\nwhen applied to debt collecting attorneys.\n   To the extent the FDCPA imposes some constraints on a\nlawyer’s advocacy on behalf of a client, it is hardly unique\nin our law. “[A]n attorney’s ethical duty to advance the\ninterests of his client is limited by an equally solemn duty\nto comply with the law and standards of professional\nconduct.” Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U. S. 157, 168 (1986).\nLawyers face sanctions, among other things, for suits\npresented “for any improper purpose, such as to harass,\ncause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of\nlitigation.” Fed.

In\nsome circumstances, lawyers may face personal liability\nfor conduct undertaken during representation of a client.\nSee, e.g., Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate\nBank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 191 (1994) (“Any\nperson or entity, including a lawyer, . . . who employs a\nmanipulative device or makes a material misstatement (or\nomission) on which a purchaser or seller of securities\nrelies may be liable as a primary violator under [Securities\nand Exchange Commission Rule] 10b–5”).\n   Moreover, a lawyer’s interest in avoiding FDCPA liabil\nity may not always be adverse to her client. Some courts\nhave held clients vicariously liable for their lawyers’ viola\ntions of the FDCPA. See, e.g., Fox v. Citicorp Credit\nServs., Inc., 15 F. 3d 1507, 1516 (CA9 1994); see also First\nInterstate Bank of Fort Collins, N. A. v. Soucie, 924 P. 2d\n1200, 1202 (Colo. App. 1996).\n   The suggestion that our reading of §1692k(c) will create\nunworkable consequences is also undermined by the exis\ntence of numerous state consumer protection and debt\ncollection statutes that contain bona fide error defenses\nthat are either silent as to, or expressly exclude, legal\nerrors.17 Several States have enacted debt collection\nstatutes that contain neither an exemption for attorney\ndebt collectors nor any bona fide error defense at all.

Neither\nCarlisle and its amici nor the dissent demonstrate that\nlawyers have suffered drastic consequences under these\nstate regimes.\n  In the dissent’s view, these policy concerns are evidence\nthat “Congress could not have intended” the reading we\nadopt today. Post, at 5. But the dissent’s reading raises\nconcerns of its own. The dissent focuses on the facts of\nthis case, in which an attorney debt collector, in the dis\nsent’s view, “acted reasonably at every step” and commit\nted a “technical violation” resulting in no “actual harm” to\nthe debtor. Post, at 12, 6, 8. But the dissent’s legal theory\ndoes not limit the defense to attorney debt collectors or\n“technical” violations.19 Under that approach, it appears,\nnonlawyer debt collectors could obtain blanket immunity\nfor mistaken interpretations of the FDCPA simply by\nseeking the advice of legal counsel.

Code §24–9–5–5 (West 2004) (defense for creditor’s “bona\nfide error of law or fact” in Indiana Home Loan Practices Act).\n   19 The dissent also downplays the predicate fact that respondents in\n\nthis case brought a foreclosure lawsuit against Jerman for a debt she\nhad already repaid. Neither the lower courts nor this Court have been\nasked to consider, and thus we express no view about, whether Carlisle\ncould be subject to liability under the FDCPA for that uncontested\nerror—regardless of how reasonably Carlisle may have acted after the\nmistake was pointed out by Jerman’s (privately retained) lawyer.\n28            JERMAN v.

It is far from obvious why immunizing debt collec\ntors who adopt aggressive but mistaken interpretations of\nthe law would be consistent with the statute’s broadly\nworded prohibitions on debt collector misconduct. Jerman\nand her amici express further concern that the dissent’s\nreading would give a competitive advantage to debt collec\ntors who press the boundaries of lawful conduct. They\nforesee a “race to the bottom” driving ethical collectors out\nof business. Brief for Petitioner 32; Brief for Public Citi\nzen et al. as Amici Curiae 16–18. It is difficult to square\nsuch a result with Congress’ express purpose “to eliminate\nabusive debt collection practices by debt collectors, [and]\nto insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using\nabusive debt collection practices are not competitively\ndisadvantaged,” §1692(e).\n  The dissent’s reading also invites litigation about a debt\ncollector’s subjective intent to violate the FDCPA and the\nadequacy of procedures maintained to avoid legal error.\nCf. Barlow, 7 Pet., at 411 (maxim that ignorance of the\nlaw will not excuse civil or criminal liability “results from\nthe extreme difficulty of ascertaining what is, bona fide,\nthe interpretation of the party”).         Courts that read\n§1692k(c) to permit a mistake-of-law defense have adopted\nvarying formulations of what legal procedures are “rea\nsonably adapted to avoid any [legal] error.”20 Among other\nuncertainties, the dissent does not explain whether it\n\n——————\n  20 Compare Hartman v.

The increased\ncost to prospective plaintiffs in time, fees, and uncertainty\nof outcome may chill private suits under the statutory\nright of action, undermining the FDCPA’s calibrated\nscheme of statutory incentives to encourage self\nenforcement. Cf. FTC, Collecting Consumer Debts: The\nChallenge of Change 67 (2009) (“Because the Commission\nreceives more than 70,000 third-party debt collection\ncomplaints per year, it is not feasible for federal govern\nment law enforcement to be the exclusive or primary\nmeans of deterring all possible law violations”). The state\namici predict that, on the dissent’s reading, consumers\nwill have little incentive to bring enforcement actions\n“where the law [i]s at all unsettled, because in such cir\ncumstances a debt collector could easily claim bona fide\nerror of law”; in the States’ view, the resulting “enforce\nment gap” would be “extensive” at both the federal and\nState levels. See Brief for State of New York et al. as\nAmici Curiae 7–10. In short, the policy concerns identified\nby the dissent tell only half the story.21\n  In sum, we do not foresee that our decision today will\nplace unmanageable burdens on lawyers practicing in the\ndebt collection industry.

Absent\nsuch a showing, arguments that the Act strikes an unde\nsirable balance in assigning the risks of legal misinterpre\ntation are properly addressed to Congress. To the extent\nCongress is persuaded that the policy concerns identified\nby the dissent require a recalibration of the FDCPA’s\nliability scheme, it is, of course, free to amend the statute\naccordingly.22 Congress has wide latitude, for instance, to\nrevise §1692k to excuse some or all mistakes of law or\ngrant broader discretion to district courts to adjust a\nplaintiff’s recovery. This Court may not, however, read\nmore into §1692k(c) than the statutory language naturally\nsupports. We therefore hold that the bona fide error de\nfense in §1692k(c) does not apply to a violation of the\nFDCPA resulting from a debt collector’s incorrect interpre\ntation of the requirements of that statute.\n                        *     *  *\n  For the reasons discussed above, the judgment of the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  22 The FDCPA has been amended some eight times since its enact\n\nment in 1977; the most recent amendment addressed a concern not\nunrelated to the question we consider today, specifying that a pleading\nin a civil action is not an “initial communication” triggering obligations\nunder §1692g requiring a written notice to the consumer.

Can those\nlawyers act in the best interests of their clients if they face\npersonal liability when they rely on good-faith interpreta\ntions of the Act that are later rejected by a court? Or will\nthat threat of personal liability lead them to do less than\ntheir best for those clients?\n   As the majority points out, however, the statute offers a\nway out of—though not a panacea for—this dilemma.\nAnte, at 13–14, 24–25. Faced with legal uncertainty, a\nlawyer can turn to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC or\nCommission) for an advisory opinion. 16 CFR §§1.1 to 1.4\n(2009). And once he receives that opinion and acts upon it\nthe dilemma disappears: If he fails to follow the opinion,\nhe has not acted in good faith and can fairly be held liable.\nIf he follows the opinion, the statute frees him from any\nsuch liability. 15 U. S. C. §1692k(e) (debt collectors im\nmune from liability for “any act done or omitted in . . .\nconformity with any advisory opinion of the [Federal\nTrade] Commission”). See also R.

A portion of the Court’s reasoning consists\nof this: The language in the Fair Debt Collection Practices\nAct (FDCPA or Act) tracks language in the Truth in Lend\ning Act (TILA); and in the nine years between the enact\nment of TILA and the enactment of the FDCPA, three\nCourts of Appeals had “interpreted TILA’s bona fide error\ndefense as referring to clerical errors.” Ante, at 14. Rely\ning on our statement in Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U. S. 624,\n645 (1998), that Congress’s repetition, in a new statute, of\nstatutory language with a “ ‘settled’ ” judicial interpreta\ntion indicates “ ‘the intent to incorporate its . . . judicial\ninterpretations as well,’ ” the Court concludes that these\nthree Court of Appeals cases “suppor[t] an inference that\nCongress understood the statutory formula it chose for the\nFDCPA consistent with Federal Court of Appeals interpre\ntations of TILA.” Ante, at 14–16.\n   Let me assume (though I do not believe it) that what\ncounts is what Congress “intended,” even if that intent\nfinds no expression in the enacted text. When a large\nmajority of the Circuits, over a lengthy period of time,\nhave uniformly reached a certain conclusion as to the\nmeaning of a particular statutory text, it may be reason\n2            JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                  KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J. \n\n\nable to assume that Congress was aware of those holdings,\ntook them to be correct, and intended the same meaning in\nadopting that text.1 It seems to me unreasonable, how\never, to assume that, when Congress has a bill before it\nthat contains language used in an earlier statute, it is\naware of, and approves as correct, a mere three Court of\nAppeals decisions interpreting that earlier statute over\nthe previous nine years. Can one really believe that a\nmajority in both Houses of Congress knew of those three\ncases, and accepted them as correct (even when, as was\nthe case here, some District Court opinions and a State\nSupreme Court opinion had concluded, to the contrary,\nthat the defense covered legal errors, see ante, at 14–15,\nn. 10)? This is a legal fiction, which has nothing to be said\nfor it except that it can sometimes make our job easier.\nThe Court acknowledges that “the interpretations of three\nFederal Courts of Appeals may not have ‘settled’ the\nmeaning of TILA’s bona fide error defense,” but says\n“there is no reason to suppose that Congress disagreed\nwith those interpretations.” Ante, at 15–16. Perhaps not;\nbut no reason to suppose that it knew of and agreed with\nthem either—which is presumably the proposition for\nwhich the Court cites them.\n   Even assuming, moreover, that Congress knew and\napproved of those cases, they would not support the\nCourt’s conclusion today. All three of them said that\nTILA’s bona fide error defense covered only clerical errors.\nSee Ives v. W. T. Grant Co., 522 F. 2d 749, 758 (CA2 1975)\n(“only available for clerical errors”); Haynes v. Logan\n——————\n   1 Of course where so many federal courts have read the language that\n\nway, the text was probably clear enough that resort to unexpressed\ncongressional intent would be unnecessary. Or indeed it could be said\nthat such uniform and longstanding judicial interpretation had estab\nlished the public meaning of the text, whether the Members of Con\ngress were aware of the cases or not. That would be the understanding\nof the text by reasonable people familiar with its legal context.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

Wilson, 502\nF. 2d 860, 861 (CA9 1974) (“[C]lerical errors . . . are the\nonly violations this section was designed to excuse”). Yet\nthe Court specifically interprets the identical language in\nthe FDCPA as providing a defense not only for clerical\nerrors, but also for factual errors. See ante, at 19, 24; see\nalso ante, at 20–21 (suggesting the same). If the Court\nreally finds the three Courts of Appeals’ interpretations of\nTILA indicative of congressional intent in the FDCPA, it\nshould restrict its decision accordingly. As for me, I sup\nport the Court’s inclusion of factual errors, because there\nis nothing in the text of the FDCPA limiting the excusable\n“not intentional” violations to those based on clerical\nerrors, and since there is a long tradition in the common\nlaw and in our construction of federal statutes distinguish\ning errors of fact from errors of law.\n   The Court’s opinion also makes fulsome use of that\nother legal fiction, legislative history, ranging from a\nsingle Representative’s floor remarks on the House bill\nthat became the FDCPA, ante, at 16, n. 11, to a single\nRepresentative’s remarks in a Senate Subcommittee\nhearing on the House bill and three Senate bills, ibid., to\ntwo 1979 Senate Committee Reports dealing not with the\nFDCPA but with the 1980 amendments to TILA, ante, at\n17, n. 12, to remarks in a Committee markup of the Sen\nate bill on the FDCPA, ante, at 21–22, n. 14, to a House\nReport dealing with an earlier version of the FDCPA, ibid.\nIs the conscientious attorney really expected to dig out\nsuch mini-nuggets of “congressional intent” from floor\nremarks, committee hearings, committee markups, and\ncommittee reports covering many different bills over many\nyears? When the Court addresses such far-afield legisla\ntive history merely “for the sake of completeness,” ante, at\n20, it encourages and indeed prescribes such wasteful\nover-lawyering.\n4            JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                  KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J. \n\n\n   As it happens, moreover, one of the supposedly most\n“authoritative” snippets of legislative history, a Senate\nCommittee Report dealing with the meaning of TILA,\nstates very clearly that the 1980 amendment to TILA’s\nbona fide error defense “clarified” the defense “to make\nclear that it applies to mechanical and computer errors,”\nS. Rep. No. 96–73, pp. 7–8 (1979). Likewise, the 1999\nAmerican Law Report the Court cites, ante, at 17, n. 12,\nwhich relies on another Senate Committee Report, de\nscribes the amendment as clarifying the “prevailing view”\nthat the defense “applies to clerical errors,” Lockhart, 153\nA. L. R. Fed. 211–212, §2[a] (1999).2 Once again, the legal\nfiction contradicts the Court’s conclusion that the lan\nguage in the FDCPA, identical to the original TILA de\nfense, applies to mistakes of fact.\n   But if legislative history is to be used, it should be used\nimpartially. (Legislative history, after all, almost always\nhas something for everyone!) The Court dismisses with a\nwave of the hand what seems to me the most persuasive\nlegislative history (if legislative history could ever be\npersuasive) in the case. The respondents point to the\nSenate Committee Report on the FDCPA, which says that\n“[a] debt collector has no liability . . . if he violates the act\nin any manner, including with regard to the act’s coverage,\nwhen such violation is unintentional and occurred despite\nprocedures designed to avoid such violations.” S. Rep. No.\n95–382, p. 5 (1977) (emphasis added). The Court claims\nthat a mistake about “the act’s coverage” in this passage\nmight refer to factual mistakes, such as a debt collector’s\nmistaken belief “that a particular debt arose out of a\nnonconsumer transaction and was therefore not ‘covered’\n——————\n  2 The page cited in the Senate Committee Report does not actually\n\nsupport the American Law Report’s statement. It makes no mention of\nclarification or judicial interpretations; it merely states that the\namendment is intended to “provide protection where errors are clerical\nor mechanical in nature,” S. Rep. No. 96–368, p. 32 (1979).\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nby the Act,” ante, at 21. The Court’s explanation seems to\nme inadequate. No lawyer—indeed, no one speaking\naccurately—would equate a mistake regarding the Act’s\ncoverage with a mistake regarding whether a particular\nfact situation falls within the Act’s coverage. What the\nAct covers (“the act’s coverage”) is one thing; whether a\nparticular case falls within the Act’s coverage is something\nelse.\n   Even if (contrary to my perception) the phrase could be\nused to refer to both these things, by what principle does\nthe Court reject the more plausible meaning? The fact\nthat “attorneys were excluded from the Act’s definition of\n‘debt collector’ until 1986,” ibid., does not, as the Court\ncontends, support its conclusion that errors of law are not\ncovered. Attorneys are not the only ones who would have\nbeen able to claim a legal-error defense; non-attorneys\nmake legal mistakes too. They also sometimes receive and\nrely upon erroneous legal advice from attorneys. Indeed,\nif anyone could satisfy the defense’s requirement of main\ntaining “procedures reasonably adapted to avoid” a legal\nerror, it would be a non-attorney debt collector who fol\nlows the procedure of directing all legal questions to his\nattorney.\n   The Court also points to “equivocal” evidence from the\nSenate Committee’s final markup session, ante, at 21–22,\nn. 14, but it minimizes a decidedly unhelpful discussion of\nthe scope of the defense during the session. In response to\nconcern that the defense would be construed, like the\nTILA defense, as “only protecting against a mathematical\nerror,” a staff member explained that, because of differ\nences in the nature of the statutes, the FDCPA defense\nwas broader than the TILA defense and “would apply to\nany violation of the act which was unintentional.” See\nSenate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Af\nfairs, Markup Session: S. 1130—Debt Collection Legisla\ntion 20–21 (July 26, 1977) (emphasis added).

To which the staff member responded:\n“That’s correct.” Ibid. The repeated use of “any”—“any\nviolation” and “any bona fide error”—supports the natural\nreading of the Committee Report’s statement regarding\n“the act’s coverage” as including legal errors about the\nscope of the Act, rather than just factual errors.\n  The Court ultimately dismisses the Senate Committee\nReport on the ground that “the legislative record taken as\na whole does not lend strong support to Carlisle’s view.”\nAnte, at 21. I think it more reasonable to give zero weight\nto the other snippets of legislative history that the Court\nrelies upon, for the reason that the Senate Committee\nReport on the very bill that became the FDCPA flatly\ncontradicts them. It is almost invariably the case that our\nopinions benefit not at all from the make-weight use of\nlegislative history. But today’s opinion probably suffers\nfrom it. Better to spare us the results of legislative-history\nresearch, however painfully and exhaustively conducted it\nmight have been.\n  The Court’s textual analysis stands on its own, without\nneed of (or indeed any assistance from) the two fictions I\nhave discussed.

S. C. §1692 et seq. The\nstatute excepts from liability a debt collector’s “bona fide\nerror[s],” provided that they were “not intentional” and\nreasonable procedures have been maintained to avoid\nthem. §1692k(c). The Court today interprets this excep\ntion to exclude legal errors. In doing so, it adopts a ques\ntionable interpretation and rejects a straightforward,\nquite reasonable interpretation of the statute’s plain\nterms. Its decision aligns the judicial system with those\nwho would use litigation to enrich themselves at the ex\npense of attorneys who strictly follow and adhere to pro\nfessional and ethical standards.\n   When the law is used to punish good-faith mistakes;\nwhen adopting reasonable safeguards is not enough to\navoid liability; when the costs of discovery and litigation\nare used to force settlement even absent fault or injury;\nwhen class-action suits transform technical legal viola\ntions into windfalls for plaintiffs or their attorneys, the\nCourt, by failing to adopt a reasonable interpretation to\ncounter these excesses, risks compromising its own insti\ntutional responsibility to ensure a workable and just\nlitigation system.

See ante, at 1–2.\nThe statute permits private suits against debt collectors\nwho violate its provisions. §1692k(a). An exception\nto liability is provided by the so-called bona fide error\ndefense:\n    “A debt collector may not be held liable in any action\n    . . . if the debt collector shows by a preponderance of\n    evidence that the violation was not intentional and\n    resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the\n    maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to\n    avoid any such error.” §1692k(c).\nThis language does not exclude mistakes of law and is\nmost naturally read to include them. Certainly a mis\ntaken belief about the law is, if held in good faith, a “bona\nfide error” as that phrase is normally understood. See\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 582 (8th ed. 2004) (defining “error”\nas “a belief that what is false is true or that what is true is\nfalse,” def. 1); ibid. (“[a] mistake of law or of fact in a\ntribunal’s judgment, opinion, or order,” def. 2); ibid. (list\ning categories of legal errors).\n   The choice of words provides further reinforcement for\nthis view. The bona fide error exception in §1692k(c)\napplies if “the violation was not intentional and resulted\nfrom a bona fide error.” The term “violation” specifically\ndenotes a legal infraction. See id., at 1600 (“An infraction\nor breach of the law; a transgression,” def. 1). The statu\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ntory term “violation” thus stands in direct contrast to\nother provisions of the FDCPA that describe conduct itself.\nThis applies both to specific terms, e.g., §1692e (“A debt\ncollector may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading\nrepresentation or means in connection with the collection\nof any debt”), and to more general ones, e.g., §1692k(e)\n(referring to “any act done or omitted in good faith”). By\nlinking the mens rea requirement (“not intentional”) with\nthe word “violation”—rather than with the conduct giving\nrise to the violation—the Act by its terms indicates that\nthe bona fide error exception applies to legal errors as well\nas to factual ones.\n   The Court’s precedents accord with this interpretation.\nFederal statutes that link the term “violation” with a mens\nrea requirement have been interpreted to excuse good\nfaith legal mistakes. See, e.g., McLaughlin v. Richland\nShoe Co., 486 U. S. 128, 129, 133 (1988) (the phrase “aris\ning out of a willful violation” in the Fair Labor Standards\nAct applies where an employer “either knew or showed\nreckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct\nwas prohibited by the statute”); Trans World Airlines, Inc.\nv. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 125, 126 (1985) (damages\nprovision under the Age Discrimination in Employment\nAct, which applies “only in cases of willful violations,”\ncreates liability where an employer “knew or showed\nreckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct\nwas prohibited by the ADEA” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)); cf. Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S. 419, 428\n(1985) (prohibition on use of food stamps “ ‘knowing [them]\nto have been received . . . in violation of’ ” federal law\n“undeniably requires a knowledge of illegality” (emphasis\ndeleted)). The FDCPA’s use of “violation” thus distin\nguishes it from most of the authorities relied upon by the\nCourt to demonstrate that mistake-of-law defenses are\ndisfavored. See, e.g., ante, at 7–8 (citing Kolstad v. Ameri\ncan Dental Assn., 527 U. S. 526 (1999)).\n4          JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                  KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\n   The Court’s response is that there is something distinc\ntive about the word “willful” that suggests an excuse for\nmistakes of law. This may well be true for criminal stat\nutes, in which the terms “ ‘knowing,’ ‘intentional’ [and]\n‘willful’ ” have been distinguished in this regard. Ante, at\n10 (citing Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47,\n57 (2007)). But this distinction is specific to the criminal\ncontext:\n    “It is different in the criminal law. When the term\n    ‘willful’ or ‘willfully’ has been used in a criminal stat\n    ute, we have regularly read the modifier as limiting\n    liability to knowing violations. This reading of the\n    term, however, is tailored to the criminal law, where\n    it is characteristically used to require a criminal in\n    tent beyond the purpose otherwise required for guilt,\n    or an additional ‘bad purpose,’ or specific intent to vio\n    late a known legal duty created by highly technical\n    statutes.” Id., at 57–58, n. 9 (citations omitted).\nFor this reason, the Court’s citation to criminal cases,\nwhich are themselves inconsistent, see Ratzlaf v. United\nStates, 510 U. S. 135 (1994), is unavailing. See ante, at\n10–11, and n. 7.\n  In the civil context, by contrast, the word “willful” has\nbeen used to impose a mens rea threshold for liability that\nis lower, not higher, than an intentionality requirement.\nSee Safeco, supra, at 57 (“[W]here willfulness is a statu\ntory condition of civil liability, we have generally taken it\nto cover not only knowing violations of a standard, but\nreckless ones as well”). Avoiding liability under a statute\naimed at intentional violations should therefore be easier,\nnot harder, than avoiding liability under a statute aimed\nat willful violations. And certainly there is nothing in\nThurston or McLaughlin—both civil cases—suggesting\nthat they would have come out differently had the rele\nvant statutes used “intentional violation” rather than\n                   Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)         5\n\n                       KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n“willful violation.”\n                             B\n   These considerations suffice to show that §1692k(c) is\nmost reasonably read to include mistakes of law. Even if\nthis were merely a permissible reading, however, it should\nbe adopted to avoid the adverse consequences that must\nflow from the Court’s contrary decision. The Court’s read\ning leads to results Congress could not have intended.\n                              1\n   The FDCPA is but one of many federal laws that Con\ngress has enacted to protect consumers. A number of\nthese statutes authorize the filing of private suits against\nthose who use unfair or improper practices. See, e.g., 15\nU. S. C. §1692k (FDCPA); §1640 (Truth in Lending Act);\n§1681n (Fair Credit Reporting Act); 49 U. S. C. §32710\n(Federal Odometer Disclosure Act); 11 U. S. C. §526(c)(2)\n(Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection\nAct of 2005). Several of these provisions permit a success\nful plaintiff to recover—in addition to actual damages—\nstatutory damages, attorney’s fees and costs, and in some\ncases punitive damages. E.g., 15 U. S. C. §1640(a)(2)\n(statutory damages); §1640(a)(3) (attorney’s fees and\ncosts); §1681n(a)(1)(B) (statutory and punitive damages);\n§1681n(a)(1)(B)(3) (costs and attorney’s fees); 49 U. S. C.\n§32710(a) (“3 times the actual damages or $1,500, which\never is greater”); §32710(b) (costs and attorney’s fees); 11\nU. S. C. §526(c)(3)(A) (costs and attorney’s fees). Some\nalso explicitly permit class-action suits. E.g., 15 U. S. C.\n§1640(a)(2)(B); §1692k(a)(2)(B).\n   A collateral effect of these statutes may be to create\nincentives to file lawsuits even where no actual harm has\noccurred. This happens when the plaintiff can recover\nstatutory damages for the violation and his or her attorney\nwill receive fees if the suit is successful, no matter how\nslight the injury. A favorable verdict after trial is not\n6           JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                 KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\nnecessarily the goal; often the plaintiff will be just as\nhappy with a settlement, as will his or her attorney (who\nwill receive fees regardless). The defendant, meanwhile,\nmay conclude a quick settlement is preferable to the costs\nof discovery and a protracted trial. And if the suit attains\nclass-action status, the financial stakes rise in magnitude.\nSee, e.g., §1640(a)(2)(B) (class-action recovery of up to “the\nlesser of $500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the\n[defendant]”); §1692k(a)(2)(B) (same).\n   The present case offers an object lesson. Respondents\nfiled a complaint in state court on behalf of a client that\nmistakenly believed Jerman owed money to it. Jerman’s\nattorney then informed respondents that the debt had\nbeen paid in full. Respondents confirmed this fact with\nthe client and withdrew the lawsuit.\n   This might have been the end of the story. But because\nrespondents had informed Jerman that she was required\nto dispute the debt in writing, she filed a class-action\ncomplaint. It did not matter that Jerman had claimed no\nharm as a result of respondents’ actions. Jerman sued for\ndamages, attorney’s fees, and costs—including class dam\nages of “$500,000 or 1% of defendants’ net worth which\never is less.” Amended Complaint in No. 1:06–CV–01397\n(ND Ohio), p. 4. In addition to merits-related discovery,\nJerman sought information from respondents concerning\nthe income and net worth of each partner in the firm. At\nsome point, Jerman proposed to settle with respondents\nfor $15,000 in damages and $7,500 in attorney’s fees.\nAmended Joint App. in No. 07–3964 (CA6), pp. 256–262.\nThe case illustrates how a technical violation of a complex\nfederal statute can give rise to costly litigation with incen\ntives to settle simply to avoid attorney’s fees.\n   Today’s holding gives new impetus to this already trou\nbling dynamic of allowing certain actors in the system to\nspin even good-faith, technical violations of federal law\ninto lucrative litigation, if not for themselves then for the\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nattorneys who conceive of the suit. See Federal Home\nLoan Mortgage Corp. v. Lamar, 503 F. 3d 504, 513 (CA6\n2007) (referring to the “cottage industry” of litigation that\nhas arisen out of the FDCPA (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). It is clear that Congress, too, was troubled by\nthis dynamic. That is precisely why it enacted a bona fide\nerror defense. The Court’s ruling, however, endorses and\ndrives forward this dynamic, for today’s holding leaves\nattorneys and their clients vulnerable to civil liability for\nadopting good-faith legal positions later determined to be\nmistaken, even if reasonable efforts were made to avoid\nmistakes.\n   The Court seeks to brush aside these concerns by noting\nthat trivial violations will give rise to little in the way of\nactual damages and that trial courts “have discretion in\ncalculating reasonable attorney’s fees under [the] statute.”\nAnte, at 23. It is not clear, however, that a court is per\nmitted to adjust a fee award based on its assessment of\nthe suit’s utility. Cf. Perdue v. Kenny A., post, at 9 (noting\na “ ‘strong presumption’ ” of reasonableness that attaches\nto a lodestar calculation of attorney’s fees). Though the\nCourt, properly, does not address the question here, it\nacknowledges that some courts have deemed fee awards to\nvictorious plaintiffs to be “ ‘mandatory,’ ” even if the plain\ntiff suffered no damage. Ante, at 23–24, n. 16.\n   The Court’s second response is that the FDCPA guards\nagainst abusive suits and that suits brought “ ‘in bad faith\nand for the purpose of harassment’ ” can lead to a fee\naward for the defendant.            Ante, at 24 (quoting\n§1692k(a)(3)). Yet these safeguards cannot deter suits\nbased on technical—but harmless—violations of the stat\nute. If the plaintiff obtains a favorable judgment or a\nsettlement, then by definition the suit will not have been\nbrought in bad faith. See Emanuel v. American Credit\nExch., 870 F. 2d 805, 809 (CA2 1989) (FDCPA defendant’s\n“claim for malicious prosecution cannot succeed unless the\n8          JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                  KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\naction subject of the claim is unsuccessful”).\n   Again the present case is instructive. Jerman brought\nsuit without pointing to any actual harm that resulted\nfrom respondents’ actions. At the time her complaint was\nfiled, it was an open question in the Sixth Circuit whether\na debt collector could demand that a debt be disputed in\nwriting, and the district courts in the Circuit had reached\ndifferent answers. Ante, at 4, n. 2. The trial court in this\ncase happened to side with Jerman on the issue, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2484015\"><a href=\"/opinion/2484015/jerman-v-carlisle-mcnellie-rini-kramer-ulrich/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">720</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 722–725 (ND Ohio 2006), but it seems\nunlikely that the court would have labeled her suit “abu\nsive” or “in bad faith” even if it had gone the other way.\n   There is no good basis for optimism, then, when one\ncontemplates the practical consequences of today’s deci\nsion. Given the complexity of the FDCPA regime, see 16\nCFR pt. 901 (2009) (FDCPA regulations), technical viola\ntions are likely to be common. Indeed, the Court acknowl\nedges that they are inevitable. See ante, at 12. As long as\nlegal mistakes occur, plaintiffs and their attorneys will\nhave an incentive to bring suits for these infractions. It\nseems unlikely that Congress sought to create a system\nthat encourages costly and time-consuming litigation over\nharmless violations committed in good faith despite rea\nsonable safeguards.\n   When construing a federal statute, courts should be\nmindful of the effect of the interpretation on congressional\npurposes explicit in the statutory text. The FDCPA states\nan objective that today’s decision frustrates. The statu\ntory purpose was to “eliminate abusive debt collection\npractices” and to ensure that debt collectors who refrain\nfrom using those practices “are not competitively disad\nvantaged.” 15 U. S. C. §1692(e) (“Purposes”). The prac\ntices Congress addressed involved misconduct that is\ndeliberate, see §1692(a) (“abusive, deceptive, and unfair\ndebt collection practices”); §1692(c) (“misrepresentation or\nother abusive debt collection practices”), or unreasonable,\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nsee §1692c(a)(1) (prohibiting debt collectors from commu\nnicating with debtors at times “which should be known” to\nbe inconvenient); §1692e(8) (prohibiting the communica\ntion of credit card information “which should be known to\nbe false”). That explains the statutory objective not to\ndisadvantage debt collectors who “refrain” from abusive\npractices—that is to say, debt collectors who do not inten\ntionally or unreasonably adopt them. It further explains\nwhy Congress included a good-faith error exception,\nwhich exempts violations that are not intentional or\nunreasonable.\n   In referring to “abusive debt collection practices,” how\never, surely Congress did not contemplate attorneys who\nact based on reasonable, albeit ultimately mistaken, legal\ninterpretations. A debt collector does not gain a competi\ntive advantage by making good-faith legal errors any more\nthan by making good-faith factual errors. This is ex\npressly so if the debt collector has implemented “proce\ndures reasonably adapted to avoid” them. By reading\n§1692k(c) to exclude good-faith mistakes of law, the Court\nfails to align its interpretation with the statutory\nobjectives.\n   The Court urges, nevertheless, that there are policy\nconcerns on the other side. The Court frets about debt\ncollectors who “press the boundaries of the Act’s prohibi\ntions” and about a potential “ ‘race to the bottom.’ ” Ante,\nat 27–28 (quoting Brief for Petitioner 32). For instance, in\nits view, interpreting §1692k(c) to encompass legal mis\ntakes might mean that “nonlawyer debt collectors could\nobtain blanket immunity for mistaken interpretations of\nthe FDCPA simply by seeking the advice of legal counsel.”\nAnte, at 27. It must be remembered, however, that\n§1692k(c) may only be invoked where the debt collector’s\nerror is “bona fide” and where “reasonable procedures”\nhave been adopted to avoid errors. There is no valid or\npersuasive reason to assume that Congress would want to\n10         JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                  KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\nimpose liability on a debt collector who relies in good faith\non the reasonable advice of counsel. If anything, we\nshould expect Congress to think that such behavior should\nbe encouraged, not discouraged.\n   The Court also suggests that reading §1692k(c) to in\nclude legal errors would encourage litigation over a num\nber of issues: what subjective intent is necessary for liabil\nity; what procedures are necessary to avoid legal mistakes;\nwhat standard applies to procedures adopted by attorney\ndebt collectors as compared to non-attorney debt collec\ntors. Yet these questions are no different from ones al\nready raised by the statute. Whether the debt collector is\nan attorney or not, his or her subjective intent must be\nassessed before liability can be determined. Procedures to\navoid mistakes—whether legal or otherwise—must be\n“reasonable,” which is always a context-specific inquiry.\nThe Court provides no reason to think that legal errors\nraise concerns that differ in these respects from those\nraised by non-legal errors.\n                              2\n   There is a further and most serious reason to interpret\n§1692k(c) to include good-faith legal mistakes. In Heintz\nv. Jenkins, 514 U. S. 291 (1995), the Court held that at\ntorneys engaged in debt-collection litigation may be “debt\ncollectors” for purposes of the FDCPA. In reaching this\nconclusion the Court confronted the allegation that its\ninterpretation would produce the anomalous result that\nattorneys could be liable for bringing legal claims against\ndebtors if those claims ultimately proved unsuccessful.\nId., at 295. The Court rejected this argument. In doing so\nit said that §1692k(c) provides debt collectors with a de\nfense for their bona fide errors. Id., at 295.\n   Today the Court relies on Heintz to allay concerns about\nthe practical implications of its decision. Ante, at 25. Yet\nthe Court reads §1692k(c) to exclude mistakes of law,\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            11\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nthereby producing the very result that Heintz said would\nnot come about. Attorneys may now be held liable for\ntaking reasonable legal positions in good faith if those\npositions are ultimately rejected.\n   Attorneys are duty-bound to represent their clients with\ndiligence, creativity, and painstaking care, all within the\nconfines of the law. When statutory provisions have not\nyet been interpreted in a definitive way, principled advo\ncacy is to be prized, not punished. Surely this includes\noffering interpretations of a statute that are permissible,\neven if not yet settled. The FDCPA is a complex statute,\nand its provisions are subject to different interpretations.\nSee, e.g., ante, at 5, n. 4 (identifying splits of authority on\ntwo different FDCPA issues); Brief for National Associa\ntion of Retail Collection Attorneys as Amicus Curiae 5–6\n(identifying another split); see also ante, at 12. Attorneys\nwill often find themselves confronted with a statutory\nprovision that is susceptible to different but still reason\nable interpretations.\n   An attorney’s obligation in the face of uncertainty is to\ngive the client his or her best professional assessment of\nthe law’s mandate. Under the Court’s interpretation of\nthe FDCPA, however, even that might leave the attorney\nvulnerable to suit. For if the attorney proceeds based on\nan interpretation later rejected by the courts, today’s\ndecision deems that to be actionable as an intentional\n“violation,” with personal financial liability soon to follow.\nIndeed, even where a particular practice is compelled by\nexisting precedent, the attorney may be sued if that prece\ndent is later overturned.\n   These adverse consequences are evident in the instant\ncase. When respondents filed a foreclosure complaint\nagainst Jerman on behalf of their client, they had no\nreason to doubt that the debt was valid. They had every\nreason, furthermore, to believe that they were on solid\nlegal ground in asking her to dispute the amount owed in\n12          JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                 KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\nwriting. See, e.g., Graziano v. Harrison, 950 F. 2d 107,\n112 (CA3 1991) (written objection is necessary for coherent\nstatutory scheme and protects the debtor by “creat[ing] a\nlasting record of the fact that the debt has been disputed”).\nWhen Jerman disputed the debt, respondents verified that\nthe debt had been satisfied and withdrew the lawsuit.\nRespondents acted reasonably at every step, and yet may\nstill find themselves liable for a harmless violation.\n   After today’s ruling, attorneys can be punished for\nadvocacy reasonably deemed to be in compliance with the\nlaw or even required by it. This distorts the legal process.\nHenceforth, creditors’ attorneys of the highest ethical\nstanding are encouraged to adopt a debtor-friendly inter\npretation of every question, lest the attorneys themselves\nincur personal financial risk. It is most disturbing that\nthis Court now adopts a statutory interpretation that will\ninterject an attorney’s personal financial interests into the\nprofessional and ethical dynamics of the attorney-client\nrelationship. These consequences demonstrate how un\ntenable the Court’s statutory interpretation is and counsel\nin favor of a different reading. See Milavetz, Gallop &\nMilavetz, P. A. v. United States, 559 U. S. ___, ___, n. 5\n(2010) (slip op., at 16, n. 5) (rejecting a reading of federal\nlaw that “would seriously undermine the attorney-client\nrelationship”).\n   The Court’s response is that this possibility is nothing\nnew, because attorneys are already duty-bound to comply\nwith the law and with standards of professional conduct.\nAttorneys face sanctions for harassing behavior and frivo\nlous litigation, and in some cases misconduct may give rise\nto personal liability. Ante, at 25–26.\n   This response only underscores the problem with the\nCourt’s approach. By reading §1692k(c) to exclude mis\ntakes of law, the Court ensures that attorneys will face\nliability even when they have done nothing wrong—\nindeed, even when they have acted in accordance with\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ntheir professional responsibilities. Here respondents’ law\nfirm did not harass Jerman; it did not file a frivolous suit\nagainst her; it did not intentionally mislead her; it caused\nher no damages or injury. The firm acted upon a reason\nable legal interpretation that the District Court later\nthought to be mistaken. The District Court’s position, as\nall concede, was in conflict with other published, reasoned\nopinions. Ante, at 4, n. 2. (And in the instant case, nei\nther the Court of Appeals nor this Court has decided the\nissue. See ante, at 5, n. 3.) If the law firm can be pun\nished for making a good-faith legal error, then to be safe\nan attorney must always stick to the most debtor-friendly\ninterpretation of the statute, lest automatic liability follow\nif some later decision adopts a different rule. This dy\nnamic creates serious concerns, not only for the attorney\nclient relationship but also for First Amendment rights.\nCf. Legal Services Corporation v. Velazquez, 531 U. S. 533,\n545 (2001) (law restricting arguments available to attor\nneys “prohibits speech and expression upon which courts\nmust depend for the proper exercise of the judicial\npower”). We need not decide that these concerns rise to\nthe level of an independent constitutional violation, see\nante, at 29, n. 21, to recognize that they counsel against a\nproblematic interpretation of the statute. See Edward J.\nDeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr.\nTrades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988) (“[W]here an\notherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise\nserious constitutional problems, the Court will construe\nthe statute to avoid such problems unless such construc\ntion is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress”).\n   JUSTICE BREYER—although not the Court—argues that\nan attorney faced with legal uncertainty only needs to\nturn to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for an advi\nsory opinion. An attorney’s actions in conformity with the\nopinion will be shielded from liability. Ante, at 1 (concur\nring opinion) (citing 15 U. S. C. §1692k(e)). This argument\n14         JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                  KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\nmisconceives the practical realities of litigation. Filings\nand motions are made under pressing time constraints;\narguments must be offered quickly in reply; and strategic\ndecisions must be taken in the face of incomplete informa\ntion. Lawyers in practice would not consider this alterna\ntive at all realistic, particularly where the defense is\nneeded most.\n   And even were there time to generate a formal request\nto the FTC and wait an average of three or four months for\na response (assuming the FTC responds at all), the argu\nment assumes that an ambiguity in the statute is obvious,\nnot latent, that the problem is at once apparent, and that\na conscious decision to invoke FTC procedures can be\nmade. But the problem in many instances is that inter\npretive alternatives are not at once apparent. All this may\nexplain why, in the past decade, the FTC has issued only\nfour opinions in response to just seven requests. See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 27–28, 30. The FTC advisory process does not\nremedy the difficulties that the Court’s opinion will cause.\n   Even if an FTC opinion is obtained, moreover, the ethi\ncal dilemma of counsel is not resolved. If the FTC adopts\na position unfavorable to the client, the attorney may still\nbelieve the FTC is mistaken. Yet under today’s decision,\nthe attorney who in good faith continues to assert a rea\nsonable position to the contrary does so at risk of personal\nliability. This alters the ethical balance central to the\nadversary system; and it is, again, a reason for the Court\nto adopt a different, but still reasonable, interpretation to\navoid systemic disruption.\n                            II\n  The Court does not assert that its interpretation is\nclearly commanded by the text. Instead, its decision relies\non an amalgam of arguments that, taken together, are\nsaid to establish the superiority of its preferred reading.\nThis does not withstand scrutiny.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n   First, the Court relies on the maxim that “ ‘ignorance of\nthe law will not excuse any person, either civilly or crimi\nnally.’ ” Ante, at 6 (quoting Barlow v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130084\"><a href=\"/opinion/130084/barlow-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">404</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 411 (1833)). There is no doubt that this principle “is\ndeeply rooted in the American legal system.” Cheek v.\nUnited States, 498 U. S. 192, 199 (1991). Yet it is unhelp\nful to the Court’s position. The maxim the Court cites is\nbased on the premise “that the law is definite and know\nable,” so that all must be deemed to know its mandate.\nIbid. See also O. Holmes, The Common Law 48 (1881)\n(“[T]o admit the excuse [of ignorance] at all would be to\nencourage ignorance where the law-maker has determined\nto make men know and obey”). In other words, citizens\ncannot avoid compliance with the law simply by demon\nstrating a failure to learn it.\n   The most straightforward application of this principle is\nto statutory provisions that delineate a category of prohib\nited conduct. These statutes will not be read to excuse\nlegal mistakes absent some indication that the legislature\nmeant to do so. See, e.g., Armour Packing Co. v. United\nStates, 209 U. S. 56, 70, 85–86 (1908) (rejecting the defen\ndant’s attempt to read a mistake-of-law defense into a\ncriminal statute forbidding shippers to “obtain or dispose\nof property at less than the regular rate established”);\nante, at 7–8 (discussing a federal statute imposing liability\nfor “intentional discrimination”).\n   In the present case, however, the Court is not asked\nwhether a mistake of law should excuse respondents from\na general prohibition that would otherwise cover their\nconduct. Rather, the issue is the scope of an express ex\nception to a general prohibition. There is good reason to\nthink the distinction matters. It is one thing to presume\nthat Congress does not intend to create an exception to a\ngeneral rule through silence; it is quite another to pre\nsume that an explicit statutory exception should be con\nfined despite the existence of other sensible interpreta\n16          JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                 KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\ntions. Cf. Kosak v. United States, 465 U. S. 848, 853, n. 9\n(1984) (although the Federal Tort Claims Act waives\nsovereign immunity, “the proper objective of a court at\ntempting to construe [an exception to the Act] is to identify\nthose circumstances which are within the words and\nreason of the exception—no less and no more” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). This is all the more true\nwhere the other possible interpretations are more consis\ntent with the purposes of the regulatory scheme. By its\nterms, §1692k(c) encompasses—without limitation—all\nviolations that are “not intentional and resul[t] from a\nbona fide error.” The Court provides no reason to read\nthis language narrowly.\n   The Court responds that “our precedents have made\nclear for more than 175 years” that the presumption\nagainst mistake-of-law defenses applies even to explicit\nstatutory exceptions. Ante, 6–7, n. 5. By this the Court\nmeans that one case applied the presumption to an excep\ntion more than 175 years ago. In Barlow, the Court de\nclined to excuse an alleged mistake of law despite a statu\ntory provision that excepted “false denomination[s] . . .\n[that] happened by mistake or accident, and not from any\nintention to defraud the revenue.” 7 Pet., at 406. In\nconstruing this language, the Barlow Court noted that it\ndemonstrated congressional intent to exclude mistakes of\nlaw:\n     “The very association of mistake and accident, in this\n     [connection], furnishes a strong ground to presume\n     that the legislature had the same classes of cases in\n     view . . . . Mistakes in the construction of the law,\n     seem as little intended to be excepted by the proviso,\n     as accidents in the construction of the law.” Id., at\n     411–412.\nUnlike the provision at issue in Barlow, §1692k(c) gives no\nindication that its broad reference to “bona fide error[s]”\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          17\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nwas meant to exclude legal mistakes.\n   Even if statutory exceptions should normally be con\nstrued to exclude mistakes of law, moreover, that guide\nline would only apply absent intent to depart from the\ngeneral rule. There is no doubt that Congress may create\na mistake-of-law defense; the question is whether it has\ndone so here. See Ratzlaf, 510 U. S, at 149. As explained\nabove, see Part I–A, supra, Congress has made its choice\nplain by using the word “violation” in §1692k(c) to indicate\nthat mistakes of law are to be included.\n   Second, the Court attempts to draw a contrast between\n§1692k(c) and the administrative penalties in the Federal\nTrade Commission Act (FTC Act), 38 Stat. 717, 15 U. S. C.\n§41 et seq. Under the FTC Act, a debt collector may face\ncivil penalties of up to $16,000 per day for acting with\n“actual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis\nof objective circumstances that [an] act is” prohibited\nunder the FDCPA. §§45(m)(1)(A), (C); 74 Fed. Reg. 858\n(2009) (amending 16 CFR §1.98(d) (2009)). The Court\nreasons that the FTC provision is meant to provide rela\ntively harsh penalties for intentional violations. By con\ntrast, the argument continues, the penalties in the FDCPA\nitself must cover—and hence §1692k(c) must not excuse—\nunintentional violations. Ante, at 8–9.\n   The argument rests on a mistaken premise—namely,\nthat §1692k(c) must immunize all legal errors or none.\nThis misreads the statute. As the text states, it applies\nonly to “bona fide” errors committed despite “the mainte\nnance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid” these\nmistakes. So under a sensible reading of the statute,\n(1) intentional violations are punishable under the height\nened penalties of the FTC Act; (2) unintentional violations\nare generally subject to punishment under the FDCPA;\nand (3) a defendant may escape liability altogether by\nproving that a violation was based on a bona fide error\nand that reasonable error-prevention procedures were in\n18          JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                 KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\nplace. There is nothing incongruous in this scheme.\nIndeed, for the reasons described in Part I, supra, it is far\nless peculiar than the Court’s reading, which would sub\nject attorneys to liability for good-faith legal advocacy,\neven advocacy based on an accurate assessment of then\nexisting case law.\n    Third, in construing §1692k(c) to exclude legal errors,\nthe Court points to the requirement that a debt collector\nmaintain “procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any\nsuch error.” The Court asserts that this phrase most\nnaturally evokes procedures to avoid clerical or factual\nmistakes. There is nothing natural in reading this phrase\ncontrary to its plain terms, which do not distinguish be\ntween different categories of mistakes. Nor is there any\nthing unusual about procedures adopted to avoid legal\nmistakes. The present case is again instructive. Accord\ning to the District Court, respondents designated a lead\nFDCPA compliance attorney, who regularly attended\nconferences and seminars; subscribed to relevant periodi\ncals; distributed leading FDCPA cases to all attorneys;\ntrained new attorneys on their statutory obligations; and\nheld regular firm-wide meetings on FDCPA issues. See\n538 F. 3d 469, 477 (CA6 2008). These procedures are not\nonly “reasonably adapted to avoid [legal] error[s],” but also\naccord with the FDCPA’s purposes.\n    The Court argues, nonetheless, that the statute contem\nplates only clerical or factual errors, for these are the type\nof errors that can mostly naturally be addressed through\n“ ‘a series of steps followed in a regular orderly definite\nway.’ ” Ante, at 12 (quoting Webster’s Third New Interna\ntional Dictionary 1807 (1976)). As made clear by the steps\nthat respondents have taken to ensure FDCPA compli\nance, this is simply not true. The Court also speculates\nthat procedures to avoid clerical or factual errors will be\neasier to implement than procedures to avoid legal errors.\nEven if this were not pure conjecture, it has nothing to do\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nwith what the statute requires. The statute does not talk\nabout procedures that eliminate all—or even most—\nerrors. It merely requires procedures “reasonably adapted\nto avoid any such error.” The statute adopts the sensible\napproach of requiring reasonable safeguards if liability is\nto be avoided. This approach, not the Court’s interpreta\ntion, reflects the reality of debt-collection practices.\n   Fourth, the Court argues that construing §1692k(c) to\nencompass a mistake-of-law defense “is at odds with” the\nrole contemplated for the FTC. Ante, at 13. This is so, it\ncontends, because the FTC is authorized to issue advisory\nopinions, and the statute shields from liability “any act\ndone or omitted in good faith in conformity” with such\nopinions. §1692k(e). But why, asks the Court, would a\ndebt collector seek an opinion from the FTC if immunity\nunder §1692k(c) could be obtained simply by relying in\ngood faith on advice from private counsel? Going further,\nthe Court suggests that debt collectors might “have an\naffirmative incentive not to seek an advisory opinion to\nresolve ambiguity in the law, which would then prevent\nthem from claiming good-faith immunity for violations.”\nAnte, at 13.\n   There is little substance to this line of reasoning. As the\nCourt itself acknowledges, debt collectors would have an\nincentive to invoke the FTC safe harbor even if §1692k(c)\nis construed to include a mistake-of-law defense, because\nthe safe harbor provides a “more categorical immunity.”\nAnte, at 13, n. 8. Additionally, if a debt collector avoids\nseeking an advisory opinion from the FTC out of concern\nthat the answer will be unfavorable, that seems quite at\nodds with saying that his or her ignorance is “bona fide.”\n   It should be noted further that the Court’s concern\nabout encouraging ignorance could apply just as well to\n§45(m)(1)(A). That provision subjects a debt collector to\nharsh penalties for violating an FTC rule “with actual\nknowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of\n20         JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                  KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\nobjective circumstances that such act is unfair or deceptive\nand is prohibited by such rule.” No one contends that this\nwill encourage debt collectors to avoid learning the FTC’s\nrules. Yet there is no doubt that §45(m)(1)(A) permits a\nmistake-of-law defense.\n  All this assumes, of course, that obtaining an FTC advi\nsory opinion will be a reasonably practical possibility. For\nthe reasons stated above, see Part I–B–2, supra, this is to\nbe doubted. Even the Court recognizes the limited role\nthat the FTC has played. Ante, at 25 (“[E]vidence of pre\nsent administrative practice makes us reluctant to place\nsignificant weight on §1692k(e) as a practical remedy”).\n  Fifth, the Court asserts that “[a]ny remaining doubt”\nabout its preferred interpretation is dispelled by the\nFDCPA’s statutory history. The Court points to the fact\nthat §1692k(c) mirrors a bona fide error defense provision\nin the earlier enacted Truth in Lending Act (TILA), argu\ning that Congress sought to incorporate into the FDCPA\nthe view of the Courts of Appeals that the TILA defense\napplied only to clerical errors. Ante, at 14–15. As JUSTICE\nSCALIA points out, the Court’s claims of judicial uniformity\nare overstated. See ante, at 2–3 (opinion concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment). They rest on three\nCourt of Appeals decisions, which are contradicted by\nseveral District Court opinions and a State Supreme Court\nopinion—hardly a consistent legal backdrop against which\nto divine legislative intent. The Court also ignores the fact\nthat those three Courts of Appeals had construed the\nTILA provision to apply only to clerical errors. See Ives v.\nW. T. Grant Co., 522 F. 2d 749, 758 (CA2 1975); Haynes v.\nLogan Furniture Mart, Inc., 503 F. 2d 1161, 1167 (CA7\n1974); Palmer v. Wilson, 502 F. 2d 860, 861 (CA9 1974).\nThe Court therefore cannot explain why it reads §1692k(c)\nmore broadly to encompass factual mistakes as well.\n  It is of even greater significance that in 1980 Congress\namended the TILA’s bona fide error exception explicitly to\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          21\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nexclude “an error of legal judgment with respect to a per\nson’s obligations under [the TILA].” See Truth in Lending\nSimplification and Reform Act, §615 (c), 94 Stat. 181. This\namendment would have been unnecessary if Congress had\nunderstood the pre-1980 language to exclude legal errors.\nThe natural inference is that the pre-amendment TILA\nlanguage—the same language later incorporated nearly\nverbatim into §1692k(c)—was understood to cover those\nerrors.\n   The Court’s responses to this point are perplexing. The\nCourt first says that the 1980 amendment did not “obvi\nous[ly]” change the scope of the TILA’s bona fide error\ndefense, given the “uniform interpretation” that the de\nfense had been given in the Courts of Appeals. Ante, at\n17. The Court thus prefers to make an entire statutory\namendment surplusage rather than abandon its dubious\nassumption that Congress meant to ratify a nascent Court\nof Appeals consensus. Cf. Corley v. United States, 556\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 9) (“[O]ne of the most\nbasic interpretive canons [is] that [a] statute should be\nconstrued so that effect is given to all its provisions, so\nthat no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or\ninsignificant” (internal quotation marks omitted; second\nalteration in original)). (Without any evidence, the Court\nspeculates that perhaps the amendment was intended to\ncodify existing judicial interpretations that excluded legal\nerrors. Ante, at 17–18. If those judicial interpretation\nwere truly as uniform as the Court suggests—and\n the presumption against mistake-of-law defenses as\nironclad—there would have been no need for such a\nrecodification.)\n   The Court is hesitant as well to give the 1980 amend\nment weight because Congress “has not expressly included\nmistakes of law in any of the numerous bona fide error\ndefenses, worded in pertinent part identically to §1692k(c),\nelsewhere in the U. S. Code.” Ante, at 18 (emphasis in\n22         JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                  KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\noriginal). In other words, the Court refuses to read\n§1692k(c) to cover mistakes of law because other bona fide\nerror statutes do not expressly refer to such mistakes. But\nthe reverse should be true: If other bona fide error provi\nsions included mistake-of-law language but §1692k(c) did\nnot, we might think that the omission in §1692k(c) sig\nnaled Congress’s intent to exclude mistakes of law. The\nabsence of mistake-of-law language in §1692k(c) is conse\nquently less noteworthy because other statutes also omit\nsuch language.\n  The Court emphasizes that some bona fide error de\nfenses, like the one in the current version of the TILA,\nexpressly exclude legal errors from their scope. Ante, at\n18 (citing 12 U. S. C. §4010(c)(2)). Yet this also can prove\nthe opposite of what the Court says it does: If a bona fide\nerror defense were generally assumed not to include legal\nmistakes (as the Court argues), there would be no need to\nexpressly exclude them. It is only if the defense would\notherwise include such errors that exclusionary language\nbecomes necessary. By writing explicit exclusionary lan\nguage into the TILA (and some other federal provisions),\nCongress has indicated that those provisions would other\nwise cover good-faith legal errors.\n                       *     *    *\n   For these reasons, §1692k(c) is best read to encompass\nmistakes of law. I would affirm the judgment of the Court\nof Appeals.\n</pre>", "id": 2357, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2010/04/21/Jerman_v._Carlisle_McNellie_Rini_Kramer__Ulrich_LPA.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2009                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued January 13, 2010—Decided April 21, 2010\nThe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U. S. C. §1692 et\n  seq., imposes civil liability on “debt collector[s]” for certain prohibited\n  debt collection practices. A debt collector who “fails to comply with\n  any [FDCPA] provision . . . with respect to any person is liable to\n  such person” for “actual damage[s],” costs, “a reasonable attorney’s\n  fee as determined by the court,” and statutory “additional damages.”\n  §1692k(a). In addition, violations of the FDCPA are deemed unfair or\n  deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act\n  (FTC Act), §41 et seq., which is enforced by the Federal Trade Com\n  mission (FTC). See §1692l. A debt collector who acts with “actual\n  knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective cir\n  cumstances that such act is [prohibited under the FDCPA]” is subject\n  to civil penalties enforced by the FTC. §§45(m)(1)(A), (C). A debt col\n  lector is not liable in any action brought under the FDCPA, however,\n  if it “shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not\n  intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the\n  maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such er\n  ror.” §1692k(c).\n     Respondents, a law firm and one of its attorneys (collectively Car\n  lisle), filed a lawsuit in Ohio state court on behalf of a mortgage com\n  pany to foreclose a mortgage on real property owned by petitioner\n  Jerman. The complaint included a notice that the mortgage debt\n  would be assumed valid unless Jerman disputed it in writing. Jer\n  man’s lawyer sent a letter disputing the debt, and, when the mort\n  gage company acknowledged that the debt had in fact been paid, Car\n  lisle withdrew the suit. Jerman then filed this action, contending\n  that by sending the notice requiring her to dispute the debt in writ\n2               JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                     KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                             Syllabus \n\n\n    ing, Carlisle had violated §1692g(a) of the FDCPA, which governs the\n    contents of notices to debtors. The District Court, acknowledging a\n    division of authority on the question, held that Carlisle had violated\n    §1692g(a) but ultimately granted Carlisle summary judgment under\n    §1692k(c)’s “bona fide error” defense. The Sixth Circuit affirmed,\n    holding that the defense in §1692k(c) is not limited to clerical or fac\n    tual errors, but extends to mistakes of law.\nHeld: The bona fide error defense in §1692k(c) does not apply to a viola\n tion resulting from a debt collector’s mistaken interpretation of the\n legal requirements of the FDCPA. Pp. 6–30.\n    (a) A violation resulting from a debt collector’s misinterpretation of\n the legal requirements of the FDCPA cannot be “not intentional” un\n der §1692k(c). It is a common maxim that “ignorance of the law will\n not excuse any person, either civilly or criminally.” Barlow v. United\n States, 7 Pet. 404, 411. When Congress has intended to provide a\n mistake-of-law defense to civil liability, it has often done so more ex\n plicitly than here. In particular, the administrative-penalty provi\n sions of the FTC Act, which are expressly incorporated into the\n FDCPA, apply only when a debt collector acts with “actual knowledge\n or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances”\n that the FDCPA prohibited its action. §§45(m)(1)(A), (C). Given the\n absence of similar language in §1692k(c), it is fair to infer that Con\n gress permitted injured consumers to recover damages for “inten\n tional” conduct, including violations resulting from a mistaken inter\n pretation of the FDCPA, while reserving the more onerous\n administrative penalties for debt collectors whose intentional actions\n reflected knowledge that the conduct was prohibited. Congress also\n did not confine FDCPA liability to “willful” violations, a term more of\n ten understood in the civil context to exclude mistakes of law. See,\n e.g., Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 125–126.\n Section 1692k(c)’s requirement that a debt collector maintain “proce\n dures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error” also more natu\n rally evokes procedures to avoid mistakes like clerical or factual er\n rors. Pp. 6–12.\n    (b) Additional support for this reading is found in the statute’s con\n text and history. The FDCPA’s separate protection from liability for\n “any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any [FTC]\n advisory opinion,” §1692k(e), is more obviously tailored to the con\n cern at issue (excusing civil liability when the FDCPA’s prohibitions\n are uncertain) than the bona fide error defense. Moreover, in enact\n ing the FDCPA in 1977, Congress copied the pertinent portions of the\n bona fide error defense from the Truth in Lending Act (TILA),\n §1640(c). At that time, the three Federal Courts of Appeals to have\n considered the question interpreted the TILA provision as referring\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  to clerical errors, and there is no reason to suppose Congress dis\n  agreed with those interpretations when it incorporated TILA’s lan\n  guage into the FDCPA. Although in 1980 Congress amended the de\n  fense in TILA, but not in the FDCPA, to exclude errors of legal\n  judgment, it is not obvious that amendment changed the scope of the\n  TILA defense in a way material here, given the prior uniform judicial\n  interpretation of that provision. It is also unclear why Congress\n  would have intended the FDCPA’s defense to be broader than TILA’s,\n  and Congress has not expressly included mistakes of law in any of\n  the parallel bona fide error defenses elsewhere in the U. S. Code.\n  Carlisle’s reading is not supported by Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S.\n  291, 292, which had no occasion to address the overall scope of the\n  FDCPA bona fide error defense, and which did not depend on the\n  premise that a misinterpretation of the requirements of the FDCPA\n  would fall under that provision. Pp. 13–22.\n     (c) Today’s decision does not place unmanageable burdens on debt\n  collecting lawyers. The FDCPA contains several provisions expressly\n  guarding against abusive lawsuits, and gives courts discretion in cal\n  culating additional damages and attorney’s fees. Lawyers have re\n  course to the bona fide error defense in §1692k(c) when a violation\n  results from a qualifying factual error. To the extent the FDCPA im\n  poses some constraints on a lawyer’s advocacy on behalf of a client, it\n  is not unique; lawyers have a duty, for instance, to comply with the\n  law and standards of professional conduct. Numerous state con\n  sumer protection and debt collection statutes contain bona fide error\n  defenses that are either silent as to, or expressly exclude, legal er\n  rors. To the extent lawyers face liability for mistaken interpretations\n  of the FDCPA, Carlisle and its amici have not shown that “the result\n  [will be] so absurd as to warrant” disregarding the weight of textual\n  authority. Heintz, supra, at 295. Absent such a showing, arguments\n  that the FDCPA strikes an undesirable balance in assigning the risks\n  of legal misinterpretation are properly addressed to Congress.\n  Pp. 22–30.\n538 F. 3d 469, reversed and remanded.\n\n  SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

JERMAN, PETITIONER v. CARLISLE, MC-\n\n   NELLIE, RINI, KRAMER & ULRICH LPA, ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [April 21, 2010]\n\n\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA or Act)\nimposes civil liability on “debt collector[s]” for certain\nprohibited debt collection practices. Section 813(c) of the\nAct, 15 U. S. C. §1692k(c), provides that a debt collector is\nnot liable in an action brought under the Act if she can\nshow “the violation was not intentional and resulted from\na bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of\nprocedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.”\nThis case presents the question whether the “bona fide\nerror” defense in §1692k(c) applies to a violation resulting\nfrom a debt collector’s mistaken interpretation of the legal\nrequirements of the FDCPA. We conclude it does not.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n   Congress enacted the FDCPA in 1977, 91 Stat. 874, to\neliminate abusive debt collection practices, to ensure that\ndebt collectors who abstain from such practices are not\ncompetitively disadvantaged, and to promote consistent\nstate action to protect consumers. 15 U. S. C. §1692(e).\nThe Act regulates interactions between consumer debtors\n2          JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nand “debt collector[s],” defined to include any person who\n“regularly collects . . . debts owed or due or asserted to be\nowed or due another.” §§1692a(5), (6). Among other\nthings, the Act prohibits debt collectors from making false\nrepresentations as to a debt’s character, amount, or legal\nstatus, §1692e(2)(A); communicating with consumers at an\n“unusual time or place” likely to be inconvenient to the\nconsumer, §1692c(a)(1); or using obscene or profane lan\nguage or violence or the threat thereof, §§1692d(1), (2).\nSee generally §§1692b–1692j; Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S.\n291, 292–293 (1995).\n   The Act is enforced through administrative action and\nprivate lawsuits. With some exceptions not relevant here,\nviolations of the FDCPA are deemed to be unfair or decep\ntive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission\nAct (FTC Act), 15 U. S. C. §41 et seq., and are enforced by\nthe Federal Trade Commission (FTC). See §1692l. As a\nresult, a debt collector who acts with “actual knowledge or\nknowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circum\nstances that such act is [prohibited under the FDCPA]” is\nsubject to civil penalties of up to $16,000 per day.\n§§45(m)(1)(A), (C); 74 Fed. Reg. 858 (2009) (amending 16\nCFR §1.98(d)).\n   The FDCPA also provides that “any debt collector who\nfails to comply with any provision of th[e] [Act] with re\nspect to any person is liable to such person.” 15 U. S. C.\n§1692k(a). Successful plaintiffs are entitled to “actual\ndamage[s],” plus costs and “a reasonable attorney’s fee as\ndetermined by the court.” Ibid. A court may also award\n“additional damages,” subject to a statutory cap of $1,000\nfor individual actions, or, for class actions, “the lesser of\n$500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the debt\ncollector.” §1692k(a)(2). In awarding additional damages,\nthe court must consider “the frequency and persistence of\n[the debt collector’s] noncompliance,” “the nature of such\nnoncompliance,” and “the extent to which such noncompli\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nance was intentional.” §1692k(b).\n   The Act contains two exceptions to provisions imposing\nliability on debt collectors. Section 1692k(c), at issue here,\nprovides that\n    “[a] debt collector may not be held liable in any action\n    brought under [the FDCPA] if the debt collector shows\n    by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was\n    not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error\n    notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures rea\n    sonably adapted to avoid any such error.”\nThe Act also states that none of its provisions imposing\nliability shall apply to “any act done or omitted in good\nfaith in conformity with any advisory opinion of the [Fed\neral Trade] Commission.” §1692k(e).\n                             B\n  Respondents in this case are a law firm, Carlisle,\nMcNellie, Rini, Kramer & Ulrich, L. P. A., and one of its\nattorneys, Adrienne S. Foster (collectively Carlisle). In\nApril 2006, Carlisle filed a complaint in Ohio state court\non behalf of a client, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.\nCarlisle sought foreclosure of a mortgage held by Coun\ntrywide in real property owned by petitioner Karen L.\nJerman. The complaint included a “Notice,” later served\non Jerman, stating that the mortgage debt would be as\nsumed to be valid unless Jerman disputed it in writing.\nJerman’s lawyer sent a letter disputing the debt, and\nCarlisle sought verification from Countrywide. When\nCountrywide acknowledged that Jerman had, in fact,\nalready paid the debt in full, Carlisle withdrew the fore\nclosure lawsuit.\n  Jerman then filed her own lawsuit seeking class certifi\ncation and damages under the FDCPA, contending that\nCarlisle violated §1692g by stating that her debt would be\n4             JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                   KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\nassumed valid unless she disputed it in writing.1 While\nacknowledging a division of authority on the question, the\nDistrict Court held that Carlisle had violated §1692g by\nrequiring Jerman to dispute the debt in writing. 464\nF. Supp. 2d 720, 722–725 (ND Ohio 2006).2 The court\nultimately granted summary judgment to Carlisle, how\never, concluding that §1692k(c) shielded it from liability\nbecause the violation was not intentional, resulted from a\nbona fide error, and occurred despite the maintenance of\nprocedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\n502 F. Supp. 2d 686, 695–697 (ND Ohio 2007). The Court\nof Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. 538 F. 3d 469\n(2008). Acknowledging that the Courts of Appeals are\ndivided regarding the scope of the bona fide error defense,\nand that the “majority view is that the defense is available\nfor clerical and factual errors only,” the Sixth Circuit\nnonetheless held that §1692k(c) extends to “mistakes of\nlaw.” Id., at 473–476 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe Court of Appeals found “nothing unusual” about\nattorney debt collectors maintaining “procedures” within\nthe meaning of §1692k(c) to avoid mistakes of law. Id., at\n476. Noting that a parallel bona fide error defense in the\n——————\n  1 Section 1692g(a)(3) requires a debt collector, within five days of an\n\n“initial communication” about the collection of a debt, to send the\nconsumer a written notice containing, inter alia, “a statement that\nunless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice,\ndisputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be\nassumed to be valid by the debt collector.”\n  2 The District Court distinguished, for instance, Graziano v. Harrison,\n\n950 F. 2d 107, 112 (CA3 1991), which held a consumer’s dispute of a\ndebt under §1692g must be in writing to be effective. Noting that\ndistrict courts within the Sixth Circuit had reached different results,\nand distinguishing one unpublished Sixth Circuit decision which\nCarlisle suggested approved a form with an in-writing requirement, the\ncourt adopted the reasoning from Camacho v. Bridgeport Financial,\nInc., 430 F. 3d 1078, 1080–1082 (CA9 2005), and held that the plain\nlanguage of §1692g does not impose an “in writing” requirement on\nconsumers. See 464 F. Supp. 2d, at 725.\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nTruth in Lending Act (TILA), 15 U. S. C. §1640(c), ex\npressly excludes legal errors, the court observed that\nCongress has amended the FDCPA several times since\n1977 without excluding mistakes of law from §1692k(c).\n538 F. 3d, at 476.3\n  We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict of authority\nas to the scope of the FDCPA’s bona fide error defense,4\n557 U. S. ___ (2009), and now reverse the judgment of the\nSixth Circuit.\n\n\n\n——————\n   3 Because the question was not raised on appeal, the Court of Appeals\n\ndid not address whether Carlisle’s inclusion of the “in writing” re\nquirement violated §1692g. 538 F. 3d, at 472, n. 2. We likewise ex\npress no view about whether inclusion of an “in writing” requirement in\na notice to a consumer violates §1692g, as that question was not pre\nsented in the petition for certiorari. Compare Graziano, supra, at 112\n(reading §1692g(a)(3) to require that “any dispute, to be effective, must\nbe in writing”), with Camacho, supra, at 1082 (under §1692g(a)(3),\n“disputes need not be made in writing”).\n   4 Compare, e.g., 538 F. 3d, at 476 (case below), with Baker v. G. C.\n\nServs. Corp., 677 F. 2d 775, 779 (CA9 1982), and Hulshizer v. Global\nCredit Servs., Inc., 728 F. 2d 1037, 1038 (CA8 1984) (per curiam).\n   The Courts of Appeals have also expressed different views about\nwhether 15 U. S. C. §1692k(c) applies to violations of the FDCPA\nresulting from a misinterpretation of the requirements of state law.\nCompare Johnson v. Riddle, 305 F. 3d 1107, 1121 (CA10 2002) (con\ncluding that §1692k(c) applies where a debt collector’s misinterpreta\ntion of a Utah dishonored check statute resulted in a violation of\n§1692f(1), which prohibits collection of any amount not “permitted by\nlaw”), with Picht v. Jon R. Hawks, Ltd., 236 F. 3d 446, 451–452 (CA8\n2001) (stating that §1692k(c) does not preclude FDCPA liability result\ning from a creditor’s mistaken legal interpretation of a Minnesota\ngarnishment statute). The parties disagree about whether §1692k(c)\napplies when a violation results from a debt collector’s misinterpreta\ntion of the legal requirements of state law or federal law other than the\nFDCPA. Compare Brief for Petitioner 47–49, with Brief for Respon\ndents 60–62. Because this case involves only an alleged misinterpreta\ntion of the requirements of the FDCPA, we need not, and do not, reach\nthose other questions.\n6             JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                   KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             II \n\n                             A\n\n   The parties disagree about whether a “violation” result\ning from a debt collector’s misinterpretation of the legal\nrequirements of the FDCPA can ever be “not intentional”\nunder §1692k(c). Jerman contends that when a debt\ncollector intentionally commits the act giving rise to the\nviolation (here, sending a notice that included the “in\nwriting” language), a misunderstanding about what the\nAct requires cannot render the violation “not intentional,”\ngiven the general rule that mistake or ignorance of law is\nno defense. Carlisle and the dissent, in contrast, argue\nthat nothing in the statutory text excludes legal errors\nfrom the category of “bona fide error[s]” covered by\n§1692k(c) and note that the Act refers not to an uninten\ntional “act” but rather an unintentional “violation.” The\nlatter term, they contend, evinces Congress’ intent to\nimpose liability only when a party knows its conduct is\nunlawful. Carlisle urges us, therefore, to read §1692k(c) to\nencompass “all types of error,” including mistakes of law.\nBrief for Respondents 7.\n   We decline to adopt the expansive reading of §1692k(c)\nthat Carlisle proposes. We have long recognized the\n“common maxim, familiar to all minds, that ignorance of\nthe law will not excuse any person, either civilly or crimi\nnally.” Barlow v. United States, 7 Pet. 404, 411 (1833)\n(opinion for the Court by Story, J.); see also Cheek v.\nUnited States, 498 U. S. 192, 199 (1991) (“The general rule\nthat ignorance of the law or a mistake of law is no defense\nto criminal prosecution is deeply rooted in the American\nlegal system”).5 Our law is therefore no stranger to the\n——————\n    5 The\n        dissent discounts the relevance of the principle here, on grounds\nthat this case involves the scope of a statutory exception to liability,\nrather than a provision “delineat[ing] a category of prohibited conduct.”\nPost, at 15 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). That is a distinction without a\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

In Kolstad v. American\nDental Assn., 527 U. S. 526 (1999), for instance, we ad\ndressed a provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 author\nizing compensatory and punitive damages for “intentional\n——————\ndifference, as our precedents have made clear for more than 175 years.\nBarlow involved a statute providing for forfeiture of any goods entered\n“by a false denomination” in the office of a customs collector “for the\nbenefit of drawback or bounty upon the exportation”; the statute\nincluded, however, an exception under which “said forfeiture shall not\nbe incurred, if it shall be made appear . . . that such false denomination\n. . . happened by mistake or accident, and not from any intention to\ndefraud the revenue.” 7 Pet., at 406; see also Act of Mar. 2, 1799, §84, 1\nStat. 694. The Court concluded that the shipment at issue, entered as\n“refined sugars,” was mislabeled under the prevailing meaning of that\nterm and thus was subject to forfeiture “unless the [petitioner] c[ould]\nbring himself within the exceptio[n].” 7 Pet., at 409–410. As there had\nbeen no “accident” or “mistake” of fact, the “only mistake, if there ha[d]\nbeen any, [wa]s a mistake of law.” Id., at 410–411. The Court observed\nthat the shipper’s conduct, even if “entirely compatible with good faith,\n[wa]s not wholly free from the suspicion of an intention to overreach . . .\nby passing off, as refined sugars, what he well knew were not admitted\nto be such.” Id., at 411. But the Court declined to resolve the case on\nthe ground of the shipper’s intent, instead invoking the “common\nmaxim, familiar to all minds, that ignorance of the law will not excuse\nany person, either civilly or criminally.” Ibid. Notwithstanding the\nexistence of a statutory exception—which did not expressly exclude\nlegal errors from the category of “mistake[s]” made without “intention\nto defraud”—the Court saw “not the least reason to suppose that the\nlegislature, in this enactment, had any intention to supersede the\ncommon principle.” Ibid.\n    The dissent implies Barlow is too old to be relevant. Post, at 16. But\nat least in the context of stare decisis, this Court has suggested prece\ndents tend to gain, not lose, respect with age. See Montejo v. Louisi\nana, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 13). In any event, Justice\nStory’s opinion for a unanimous Court in Barlow is hardly a relic. As\nrecently as 1994 this Court cited it for the “venerable principle” that\nignorance of the law generally is no defense. Ratzlaf v. United States,\n510 U. S. 135, 149; see also Cheek v. United States, 498 U. S. 192, 199\n(1991) (citing Barlow for a similar proposition).\n8              JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                    KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                       Opinion of the Court \n\n\ndiscrimination,” 42 U. S. C. §1981a, but limiting punitive\ndamages to conduct undertaken “with malice or with\nreckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an\naggrieved individual,” §1981a(b)(1). We observed that in\nsome circumstances “intentional discrimination” could\noccur without giving rise to punitive damages liability,\nsuch as where an employer is “unaware of the relevant\nfederal prohibition” or acts with the “distinct belief that its\ndiscrimination is lawful.” 527 U. S., at 536–537. See also\nW. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and\nKeeton on Law of Torts 110 (5th ed. 1984) (“[I]f one inten\ntionally interferes with the interests of others, he is often\nsubject to liability notwithstanding the invasion was made\nunder an erroneous belief as to some . . . legal matter that\nwould have justified the conduct”); Restatement (Second)\nof Torts §164, and Comment e (1963–1964) (intentional\ntort of trespass can be committed despite the actor’s\nmistaken belief that she has a legal right to enter the\nproperty).6\n   Likely for this reason, when Congress has intended to\nprovide a mistake-of-law defense to civil liability, it has\noften done so more explicitly than here. In particular, the\nFTC Act’s administrative-penalty provisions—which, as\nnoted above, Congress expressly incorporated into the\nFDCPA—apply only when a debt collector acts with “ac\ntual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of\nobjective circumstances” that its action was “prohibited by\n——————\n   6 Different considerations apply, of course, in interpreting criminal\n\nstatutes. Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 57–58, n. 9\n(2007). But even in that context, we have not consistently required\nknowledge that the offending conduct is unlawful. See, e.g., Ellis v.\nUnited States, 206 U. S. 246, 255, 257 (1907) (observing, in the context\nof a statute imposing liability for “intentiona[l] violat[ions],” that “[i]f a\nman intentionally adopts certain conduct in certain circumstances\nknown to him, and that conduct is forbidden by the law under those\ncircumstances, he intentionally breaks the law in the only sense in\nwhich the law ever considers intent”).\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

Given the\nabsence of similar language in §1692k(c), it is a fair infer\nence that Congress chose to permit injured consumers to\nrecover actual damages, costs, fees, and modest statutory\ndamages for “intentional” conduct, including violations\nresulting from mistaken interpretation of the FDCPA,\nwhile reserving the more onerous penalties of the FTC Act\nfor debt collectors whose intentional actions also reflected\n“knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circum\nstances” that the conduct was prohibited. Cf. 29 U. S. C.\n§260 (authorizing courts to reduce liquidated damages\nunder the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 if an employer\ndemonstrates that “the act or omission giving rise to such\naction was in good faith and that he had reasonable\ngrounds for believing that his act or omission was not a\nviolation of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938”); 17\nU. S. C. §1203(c)(5)(A) (provision of Digital Millennium\nCopyright Act authorizing court to reduce damages where\n“the violator was not aware and had no reason to believe\nthat its acts constituted a violation”).\n   Congress also did not confine liability under the FDCPA\nto “willful” violations, a term more often understood in the\ncivil context to excuse mistakes of law. See, e.g., Trans\nWorld Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 125–126\n(1985) (civil damages for “willful violations” of Age Dis\ncrimination in Employment Act of 1967 require a showing\nthat the employer “knew or showed reckless disregard for\nthe matter of whether its conduct was prohibited” (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted)); cf.

Post, at 2–3. Such a rule would be\nremarkable in its breadth, applicable to the many scores of\ncivil and criminal provisions throughout the U. S. Code\nthat employ such a combination of terms.

Post, at 4.\nEven if the dissent is correct that the phrase “intentional\nviolation,” standing alone in a civil liability statute, might\nbe read to excuse mistakes of law, the FDCPA juxtaposes\nthe term “not intentional” “violation” in §1692k(c) with the\nmore specific language of §45(m)(1)(A), which refers to\n——————\n  7 Indeed,    in International Minerals, the Court faced, and evidently\nrejected, the distinction the dissent would draw today between the term\n“ ‘violation’ ” and a reference to “the conduct giving rise to the violation.”\nPost, at 3. As noted, in International Minerals, the Court rejected a\nmistake-of-law defense for a statute that applied to those who “know\ningly violat[e]” certain regulations. 402 U. S., at 559, 563.

United States, 220\nF. 2d 393, 397 (CA1 1955) (Magruder, C. J., concurring)). The dissent\ning opinion in International Minerals quoted extensively portions of the\nSt. Johnsbury concurrence that reached its result by contrasting a\nstatute making it an offense “ ‘ “knowingly” to sell adulterated milk’ ”\nwith one that makes it an offense “ ‘knowingly [to] violat[e] a regula\ntion.’ ” 402 U. S., at 566 (Stewart, J., dissenting) (quoting St. Johns\nbury, supra, at 398).\n   Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S. 419 (1985), is also inapposite. Cf.\npost, at 3 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). Concluding that a mistake-of-law\ndefense is available under a provision that specifies particular conduct\nundertaken while “ ‘knowing’ ” that food stamp coupons had been “ ‘used\nin any manner in violation of [law],’ ” 471 U. S., at 428, n. 12, says little\nabout the meaning of a “not intentional” “violation” in 15 U. S. C.\n§1692k(c). Indeed, the statute in Liparota bears a closer resemblance to\nthe administrative penalty provision in §45(m)(1)(A). See supra, at\n8–9.\n12         JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n“actual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis\nof objective circumstances” that particular conduct was\nunlawful. The dissent’s reading gives short shrift to that\ntextual distinction.\n   We draw additional support for the conclusion that bona\nfide errors in §1692k(c) do not include mistaken interpre\ntations of the FDCPA, from the requirement that a debt\ncollector maintain “procedures reasonably adapted to\navoid any such error.” The dictionary defines “procedure”\nas “a series of steps followed in a regular orderly definite\nway.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 1807\n(1976). In that light, the statutory phrase is more natu\nrally read to apply to processes that have mechanical or\nother such “regular orderly” steps to avoid mistakes—for\ninstance, the kind of internal controls a debt collector\nmight adopt to ensure its employees do not communicate\nwith consumers at the wrong time of day, §1692c(a)(1), or\nmake false representations as to the amount of a debt,\n§1692e(2). The dissent, like the Court of Appeals, finds\nnothing unusual in attorney debt collectors maintaining\nprocedures to avoid legal error. Post, at 18; 538 F. 3d, at\n476. We do not dispute that some entities may maintain\nprocedures to avoid legal errors. But legal reasoning is\nnot a mechanical or strictly linear process. For this rea\nson, we find force in the suggestion by the Government (as\namicus curiae supporting Jerman) that the broad statu\ntory requirement of procedures reasonably designed to\navoid “any” bona fide error indicates that the relevant\nprocedures are ones that help to avoid errors like clerical\nor factual mistakes. Such procedures are more likely to\navoid error than those applicable to legal reasoning, par\nticularly in the context of a comprehensive and complex\nfederal statute such as the FDCPA that imposes open\nended prohibitions on, inter alia, “false, deceptive,”\n§1692e, or “unfair” practices, §1692f.

S. ____ (2010)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Even if the text of §1692k(c), read in isolation, leaves\nroom for doubt, the context and history of the FDCPA\nprovide further reinforcement for construing that provi\nsion not to shield violations resulting from misinterpreta\ntions of the requirements of the Act. See Dada v. Mu\nkasey, 554 U. S. 1, __ (2008) (slip op., at 13) (“In reading a\nstatute we must not look merely to a particular clause, but\nconsider in connection with it the whole statute” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). As described above, Congress\nincluded in the FDCPA not only the bona fide error de\nfense but also a separate protection from liability for “any\nact done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any\nadvisory opinion of the [FTC].” §1692k(e). In our view,\nthe Court of Appeals’ reading is at odds with the role\nCongress evidently contemplated for the FTC in resolving\nambiguities in the Act. Debt collectors would rarely need\nto consult the FTC if §1692k(c) were read to offer immu\nnity for good-faith reliance on advice from private counsel.\nIndeed, debt collectors might have an affirmative incentive\nnot to seek an advisory opinion to resolve ambiguity in the\nlaw, as receipt of such advice would prevent them from\nclaiming good-faith immunity for violations and would\npotentially trigger civil penalties for knowing violations\nunder the FTC Act.8 More importantly, the existence of a\nseparate provision that, by its plain terms, is more obvi\nously tailored to the concern at issue (excusing civil liabil\nity when the Act’s prohibitions are uncertain) weighs\nagainst stretching the language of the bona fide error\n——————\n  8 One  of Carlisle’s amici suggests the FTC safe harbor would provide\na more categorical immunity than §1692k(c), obviating the need, e.g., to\nmaintain “procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.”\nBrief for National Association of Retail Collection Attorneys as Amicus\nCuriae 18–19 (NARCA Brief). Even if that is true, we need not con\nclude that the FTC safe harbor would be rendered entirely superfluous\nto reason that the existence of that provision counsels against extend\ning the bona fide error defense to serve an overlapping function.\n14             JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                    KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                       Opinion of the Court \n\n\ndefense to accommodate Carlisle’s expansive reading.9\n   Any remaining doubt about the proper interpretation of\n§1692k(c) is dispelled by evidence of the meaning attached\nto the language Congress copied into the FDCPA’s bona\nfide error defense from a parallel provision in an existing\nstatute. TILA, 82 Stat. 146, was the first of several stat\nutes collectively known as the Consumer Credit Protection\nAct (CCPA) that now include the FDCPA. As enacted in\n1968, §130(c) of TILA provided an affirmative defense that\nwas in pertinent part identical to the provision Congress\nlater enacted into the FDCPA: “A creditor may not be held\nliable in any action brought under [TILA] if the creditor\nshows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation\nwas not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error\nnotwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasona\nbly adapted to avoid any such error.” 82 Stat. 157 (codi\nfied at 15 U. S. C. §1640(c)).\n   During the 9-year period between the enactment of\nTILA and passage of the FDCPA, the three Federal Courts\nof Appeals to consider the question interpreted TILA’s\nbona fide error defense as referring to clerical errors; no\nsuch court interpreted TILA to extend to violations result\ning from a mistaken legal interpretation of that Act.10 We\n——————\n  9 Carlisle   raises concerns about whether, in light of contemporary\nadministrative practice, the FTC safe harbor is a realistic way for debt\ncollectors and their lawyers to seek guidance on the numerous time\nsensitive legal issues that arise in litigation. These practical concerns,\nto which we return below, do not change our understanding of the\nstatutory text itself or the likely intent of the enacting Congress.\n    10 See Ives v. W. T. Grant Co., 522 F. 2d 749, 757–758 (CA2 1975)\n\n(concluding that the bona fide error defense in §1640(c) was unavailable\ndespite creditor’s reliance, in selecting language for credit contract\nforms, on a pamphlet issued by the Federal Reserve Board); Haynes v.\nLogan Furniture Mart, Inc., 503 F. 2d 1161, 1167 (CA7 1974) (“[Section]\n1640(c) offers no shelter from liability for the defendant, whose error\n. . . was judgmental with respect to legal requirements of the Act and\nnot clerical in nature”); Palmer v. Wilson, 502 F. 2d 860, 861 (CA9\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhave often observed that when “judicial interpretations\nhave settled the meaning of an existing statutory provi\nsion, repetition of the same language in a new statute\nindicates, as a general matter, the intent to incorporate its\n. . . judicial interpretations as well.” Bragdon v. Abbott,\n524 U. S. 624, 645 (1998); see also Rowe v. New Hamp\nshire Motor Transp. Assn., 552 U. S. 364, 370 (2008).\nWhile the interpretations of three Federal Courts of Ap\npeals may not have “settled” the meaning of TILA’s bona\nfide error defense, there is no reason to suppose that\n——————\n1974) (similar).\n   Carlisle contends the meaning of TILA’s defense was unsettled at the\ntime of the FDCPA’s enactment, relying first on several District Court\nopinions extending the defense to good-faith legal errors. See, e.g.,\nWelmaker v. W. T. Grant Co., 365 F. Supp. 531, 544 (ND Ga. 1972).\nBut even assuming Congress would have looked to district court, rather\nthan court of appeals, opinions in discerning the meaning of the statu\ntory language, applicable Circuit precedent had cast some doubt on\nthose decisions by the time the FDCPA was enacted. See, e.g., Turner\nv. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., 537 F. 2d 1296, 1298 (CA5 1976) (per\ncuriam) (referring to §1640(c) as the “so-called clerical error defense”).\nCarlisle also relies on the holding in Thrift Funds of Baton Rouge, Inc.\nv. Jones, 274 So. 2d 150 (La. 1973). But in that case, the Louisiana\nSupreme Court concluded only that a lender’s mistaken interpretation\nof state usury law did not “amoun[t] to an intentional violation of\n[TILA’s] disclosure requirements.” Id., at 161. The Louisiana court\nhad no occasion to address the question analogous to the one we con\nsider today: whether TILA’s bona fide error defense extended to viola\ntions resulting from mistaken interpretation of TILA itself. See n. 4,\nsupra; see also Starks v. Orleans Motors, Inc., 372 F. Supp. 928, 931\n(ED La.) (distinguishing Thrift Funds on this basis), aff’d, 500 F. 2d\n1182 (CA5 1974). These precedents therefore do not convince us that\nCongress would have ascribed a different meaning to the statutory\nlanguage it chose for the FDCPA. Compare post, at 2 (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment), with Herman &\nMacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375, 384–386, and n. 21 (1983)\n(concluding that Congress had “ratified” the “well-established judicial\ninterpretation” of a statute by leaving it intact during a comprehensive\nrevision, notwithstanding “[t]wo early district court decisions,” not\nsubsequently followed, that had adopted a contrary view).\n16            JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                   KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\nCongress disagreed with those interpretations when it\nenacted the FDCPA. Congress copied verbatim the perti\nnent portions of TILA’s bona fide error defense into the\nFDCPA. Compare 15 U. S. C. §1640(c) (1976 ed.) with\n§813(c), 91 Stat. 881. This close textual correspondence\nsupports an inference that Congress understood the statu\ntory formula it chose for the FDCPA consistent with Fed\neral Court of Appeals interpretations of TILA.11\n   Carlisle and the dissent urge reliance, consistent with\nthe approach taken by the Court of Appeals, on a 1980\namendment to TILA that added the following sentence to\nthat statute’s bona fide error defense: “Examples of a bona\nfide error include, but are not limited to, clerical, calcula\ntion, computer malfunction and program[m]ing, and print\ning errors, except that an error of legal judgment with\nrespect to a person’s obligations under [TILA] is not a\nbona fide error.” See Truth in Lending Simplification and\nReform Act, §615, 94 Stat. 181. The absence of a corre\n\n——————\n   11 That only three Courts of Appeals had occasion to address the ques\n\ntion by the time the FDCPA was enacted does not render such an\ninference unreasonable. Contra, post, at 1–2 (opinion of SCALIA, J.).\nWhether or not we would take that view when such an inference serves\nas a court’s sole interpretative guide, here our conclusion also relies on\ncommon principles of statutory interpretation, as well as the statute’s\ntext and structure. Moreover, the inference is supported by the fact\nthat TILA and the FDCPA were enacted as complementary titles of the\nCCPA, a comprehensive consumer-protection statute.              While not\nnecessary to our conclusion, evidence from the legislative record dem\nonstrates that some Members of Congress understood the relationship\nbetween the FDCPA and existing provisions of the CCPA. See, e.g., 123\nCong. Rec. 10242 (1977) (remarks of Rep. Annunzio) (civil penalty\nprovisions in House version of bill were “consistent with those in the\n[CCPA]”); Fair Debt Collection Practices Act: Hearings on S. 656 et al.\nbefore the Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs of the Senate Committee\non Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., 51, 707\n(1977) (statement of Rep. Wylie) (describing “[c]ivil liability provisions”\nin the House bill as “the standard provisions that attach to all the titles\nof the [CCPA]”).\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

For several reasons, we\ndecline to give the 1980 TILA amendment such interpreta\ntive weight. For one, it is not obvious that the amendment\nchanged the scope of TILA’s bona fide error defense in a\nway material to our analysis, given the uniform interpre\ntations of three Courts of Appeals holding that the TILA\ndefense does not extend to mistakes of law.12 (Contrary to\n\n——————\n  12 Although  again not necessary to our conclusion, evidence from the\nlegislative record suggests some Members of Congress understood the\namendment to “clarif[y]” the meaning of TILA’s bona fide error defense\n“to make clear that it applies to mechanical and computer errors,\nprovided they are not the result of erroneous legal judgments as to the\nact’s requirements.” S. Rep. No. 96–73, pp. 7–8 (1979); see also Lock\nhart, 153 A. L. R. Fed. 211–212, §2[a] (1999) (amendment “was in\ntended merely to clarify what was then the prevailing view, that the\nbona fide error defense applies to clerical errors, not including errors of\nlegal judgment”) (relying on S. Rep. No. 96–368, p. 32 (1979)).\n   The concurring and dissenting opinions perceive an inconsistency\nbetween these references to clerical errors, as well as similar references\nin the pre-FDCPA precedents interpreting TILA, n. 10, supra, and\nreading the FDCPA’s bona fide error defense to include factual mis\ntakes. Post, at 2–4, and n. 2 (opinion of SCALIA, J.); post, at 20\n(KENNEDY, J., dissenting). The quoted legislative history sources,\nhowever, while stating expressly that the TILA defense excludes legal\nerrors, do not discuss a distinction between clerical and factual errors.\nSimilarly, the cited cases interpreting TILA do not address a distinction\nbetween factual and clerical errors; rather, the courts were presented\nwith claims that the defense applied to mistakes of law or other nonfac\ntual errors that the courts found not to be bona fide. See Ives, 522\nF. 2d, at 756–757; Haynes, 503 F. 2d, at 1166–1167; Palmer, 502 F. 2d,\nat 861. While factual mistakes might, in some circumstances, consti\ntute bona fide errors and give rise to violations that are “not inten\ntional” within the meaning of §1692k(c), we need not and do not decide\ntoday the precise distinction between clerical and factual errors, or\nwhat kinds of factual mistakes qualify under the FDCPA’s bona fide\nerror defense. Cf. generally R. Hobbs, National Consumer Law Center,\nFair Debt Collection §7.2 (6th ed. 2008 and Supp. 2009) (surveying case\nlaw on scope of §1692k(c)).\n18            JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                   KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthe dissent’s suggestion, post, at 21, this reading does not\nrender the 1980 amendment surplusage. Congress may\nsimply have intended to codify existing judicial interpreta\ntions to remove any potential for doubt in jurisdictions\nwhere courts had not yet addressed the issue.) It is also\nunclear why Congress would have intended the FDCPA’s\ndefense to be broader than the one in TILA, which pre\nsents at least as significant a set of concerns about impos\ning liability for uncertain legal obligations. See, e.g., Ford\nMotor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, 444 U. S. 555, 566 (1980)\n(TILA is “ ‘highly technical’ ”). Our reluctance to give\ncontrolling weight to the TILA amendment in construing\nthe FDCPA is reinforced by the fact that Congress has not\nexpressly included mistakes of law in any of the numerous\nbona fide error defenses, worded in pertinent part identi\ncally to §1692k(c), elsewhere in the U. S. Code. Compare,\ne.g., 12 U. S. C. §4010(c)(2) (bona fide error defense in\nExpedited Funds Availability Act expressly excluding “an\nerror of legal judgment with respect to [obligations under\nthat Act]”) with 15 U. S. C. §§1693m(c), 1693h(c) (bona\nfide error provisions in the Electronic Fund Transfer Act\nthat are silent as to errors of legal judgment).13 Although\n\n——————\n  13 The Government observes that several federal agencies have con\n\nstrued similar bona fide error defenses in statutes they administer to\nexclude errors of law. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28–\n30. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, for instance,\nhas promulgated regulations specifying that the bona fide error defense\nin the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, 12 U. S. C.\n§2607(d)(3), does not apply to “[a]n error of legal judgment,” 24 CFR\n§3500.15(b)(1)(ii) (2009). While administrative interpretations of other\nstatutes do not control our reading of the FDCPA, we find it telling that\nno agency has adopted the view of the Court of Appeals. Of course,\nnothing in our opinion today addresses the validity of such regulations\nor the authority of agencies interpreting bona fide error provisions in\nother statutes to adopt a different reading. See National Cable &\nTelecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967,\n982–983 (2005).\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCarlisle points out that Congress has amended the\nFDCPA on several occasions without expressly restricting\nthe scope of §1692k(c), that does not suggest Congress\nviewed the statute as having the expansive reading Car\nlisle advances, particularly as not until recently had a\nCourt of Appeals interpreted the bona fide error defense to\ninclude a violation of the FDCPA resulting from a mistake\nof law. See Johnson v. Riddle, 305 F. 3d 1107, 1121–1124,\nand nn. 14–15 (CA10 2002).\n   Carlisle’s reliance on Heintz, 514 U. S. 291, is also un\navailing. We held in that case that the FDCPA’s defini\ntion of “debt collector” includes lawyers who regularly,\nthrough litigation, attempt to collect consumer debts. Id.,\nat 292. We addressed a concern raised by the petitioner\n(as here, a lawyer collecting a debt on behalf of a client)\nthat our reading would automatically render liable “any\nlitigating lawyer who brought, and then lost, a claim\nagainst a debtor,” on the ground that §1692e(5) prohibits a\ndebt collector from making any “ ‘threat to take action that\ncannot legally be taken.’ ” Id., at 295. We expressed skep\nticism that §1692e(5) itself demanded such a result. But\neven assuming the correctness of petitioner’s reading of\n§1692e(5), we suggested that the availability of the bona\nfide error defense meant that the prospect of liability for\nlitigating lawyers was not “so absurd” as to warrant im\nplying a categorical exemption unsupported by the statu\ntory text. Ibid. We had no occasion in Heintz to address\nthe overall scope of the bona fide error defense. Our dis\ncussion of §1692e(5) did not depend on the premise that a\nmisinterpretation of the requirements of the Act would fall\nunder the bona fide error defense. In the mine-run law\nsuit, a lawyer is at least as likely to be unsuccessful be\ncause of factual deficiencies as opposed to legal error.\nLawyers can, of course, invoke §1692k(c) for violations\nresulting from qualifying factual errors.\n   Carlisle’s remaining arguments do not change our view\n20          JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                 KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nof §1692k(c). Carlisle perceives an inconsistency between\nour reading of the term “intentional” in that provision and\nthe instruction in §1692k(b) that a court look to whether\n“noncompliance was intentional” in assessing statutory\nadditional damages. But assuming §1692k(b) encom\npasses errors of law, we see no conflict, only congruence, in\nreading the Act to permit a court to adjust statutory dam\nages for a good-faith misinterpretation of law, even where\na debt collector is not entitled to the categorical protection\nof the bona fide error defense. Carlisle is also concerned\nthat under our reading, §1692k(c) would be unavailable to\na debt collector who violates a provision of the FDCPA\napplying to acts taken with particular intent because in\nsuch instances the relevant act would not be uninten\ntional. See, e.g., §1692d(5) (prohibiting a debt collector\nfrom “[c]ausing a telephone to ring . . . continuously with\nintent to annoy, abuse, or harass”). Including mistakes as\nto the scope of such a prohibition, Carlisle urges, would\nensure that §1692k(c) applied throughout the FDCPA. We\nsee no reason, however, why the bona fide error defense\nmust cover every provision of the Act.\n   The parties and amici make arguments concerning the\nlegislative history that we address for the sake of com\npleteness. Carlisle points to a sentence in a Senate Com\nmittee Report stating that “[a] debt collector has no liabil\nity . . . if he violates the act in any manner, including with\nregard to the act’s coverage, when such violation is unin\ntentional and occurred despite procedures designed to\navoid such violations.” S. Rep. No. 95–382, p. 5 (1977); see\nalso post, at 4–6 (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (discussing report).\nBut by its own terms, the quoted sentence does not unam\nbiguously support Carlisle’s reading. Even if a bona fide\nmistake “with regard to the act’s coverage” could be read\nin isolation to contemplate a mistake of law, that reading\ndoes not exclude mistakes of fact. A mistake “with regard\nto the act’s coverage” may derive wholly from a debt collec\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

There is no reason to\nread this passing statement in the Senate Report as con\ntemplating an exemption for legal error that is the product\nof an attorney’s erroneous interpretation of the FDCPA—\nparticularly when attorneys were excluded from the Act’s\ndefinition of “debt collector” until 1986. 100 Stat. 768.\nMoreover, the reference to “any manner” of violation is\nexpressly qualified by the requirements that the violation\nbe “unintentional” and occur despite maintenance of ap\npropriate procedures. In any event, we need not choose\nbetween these possible readings of the Senate Report, as\nthe legislative record taken as a whole does not lend\nstrong support to Carlisle’s view.14 We therefore decline to\n——————\n  14 For instance, an amendment was proposed and rejected during the\nSenate Banking Committee’s consideration of the FDCPA that would\nhave required proof that a debt collector’s violation was “knowin[g].”\nSenator Riegle, one of the Act’s primary sponsors, opposed the change,\nexplaining that the bill reflected the view that “certain things ought not\nto happen, period. . . . [W]hether somebody does it knowingly, willfully,\nyou know, with a good heart, bad heart, is really quite incidental.” See\nSenate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Markup\nSession: S. 1130—Debt Collection Legislation 60 (July 26, 1977) (here\ninafter Markup); see also ibid. (“We have left a way for these disputes\nto be adj[u]dicated if they are brought, where somebody can say, I\ndidn’t know that, or my computer malfunctioned, something happened,\nI didn’t intend for the effect to be as it was”). To similar effect, a House\nReport on an earlier version of the bill explained the need for new\nlegislation governing use of the mails for debt collection on grounds\nthat existing statutes “frequently require[d]” a showing of “specific\nintent[,] which is difficult to prove.” H. R. Rep. No. 95–131, p. 3 (1977).\nElsewhere, to be sure, the legislative record contains statements more\nsupportive of Carlisle’s interpretation. In particular, a concern was\nraised in the July 26 markup session that the TILA bona fide error\ndefense had been interpreted “as only protecting against a mathemati\ncal error,” and that the FDCPA defense should “go beyond” TILA to\n“allow the courts discretion to dismiss a violation where it was a\ntechnical error.” Markup 20.

Carlisle claims the FDCPA’s private enforcement\nprovisions have fostered a “cottage industry” of profes\nsional plaintiffs who sue debt collectors for trivial viola\ntions of the Act. See Brief for Respondents 40–41. If debt\ncollecting attorneys can be held personally liable for their\nreasonable misinterpretations of the requirements of the\nAct, Carlisle and its amici foresee a flood of lawsuits\nagainst creditors’ lawyers by plaintiffs (and their attor\nneys) seeking damages and attorney’s fees. The threat of\nsuch liability, in the dissent’s view, creates an irreconcil\nable conflict between an attorney’s personal financial\ninterest and her ethical obligation of zealous advocacy on\nbehalf of a client: An attorney uncertain about what the\nFDCPA requires must choose between, on the one hand,\nexposing herself to liability and, on the other, resolving\nthe legal ambiguity against her client’s interest or advis\ning the client to settle—even where there is substantial\nlegal authority for a position favoring the client. Post, at\n10–14.15\n——————\nFDCPA defense would “apply to any violation of the act which was\nunintentional,” and answered affirmatively when the Chairman asked:\n“So it’s not simply a mathematical error but any bona fide error without\nintent?” Id., at 21. Whatever the precise balance of these statements\nmay be, we can conclude that this equivocal evidence from legislative\nhistory does not displace the clear textual and contextual authority\ndiscussed above.\n  15 The dissent also cites several other consumer-protection statutes,\n\nsuch as TILA and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U. S. C. §1681 et\nseq., which in its view create “incentives to file lawsuits even where no\nactual harm has occurred” and are illustrative of what the dissent\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                  23\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   We do not believe our holding today portends such grave\nconsequences. For one, the FDCPA contains several pro\nvisions that expressly guard against abusive lawsuits,\nthereby mitigating the financial risk to creditors’ attor\nneys. When an alleged violation is trivial, the “actual\ndamage[s]” sustained, §1692k(a)(1), will likely be de\nminimis or even zero. The Act sets a cap on “additional”\ndamages, §1692k(a)(2), and vests courts with discretion to\nadjust such damages where a violation is based on a good\nfaith error, §1692k(b). One amicus suggests that attor\nney’s fees may shape financial incentives even where\nactual and statutory damages are modest. NARCA Brief\n11. The statute does contemplate an award of costs and “a\nreasonable attorney’s fee as determined by the court” in\nthe case of “any successful action to enforce the foregoing\nliability.” §1692k(a)(3). But courts have discretion in\ncalculating reasonable attorney’s fees under this statute,16\n——————\nperceives to be a “troubling dynamic of allowing certain actors in the\nsystem to spin even good-faith, technical violations of federal law into\nlucrative litigation.” Post, at 5–6. The dissent’s concern is primarily\nwith Congress’ policy choice, embodied in statutory text, to authorize\nprivate rights of action and recovery of attorney’s fees, costs, and in\nsome cases, both actual and statutory damages. As noted, in one of the\nstatutes the dissent cites, Congress explicitly barred reliance on a\nmistake-of-law defense notwithstanding the “highly technical” nature of\nthe scheme. See 15 U. S. C. §1640(c) (TILA); Ford Motor Credit Co. v.\nMilhollin, 444 U. S. 555, 566 (1980). Similarly, the plain text of the\nFDCPA authorizes a private plaintiff to recover not only “actual dam\nage[s]” for harm suffered but also “such additional damages as the\ncourt may allow,” §1692k(a).\n   16 The Courts of Appeals generally review a District Court’s calcula\n\ntion of an attorney fee award under §1692k for abuse of discretion. See,\ne.g., Carroll v. Wolpoff & Abramson, 53 F. 3d 626, 628–629 (CA4 1995);\nEmanuel v. American Credit Exchange, 870 F. 2d 805, 809 (CA2 1989).\nMany District Courts apply a lodestar method, permitting downward\nadjustments in appropriate circumstances. See, e.g., Schlacher v. Law\nOffices of Phillip J. Rotche & Assoc., P. C., 574 F. 3d 852 (CA7 2009)\n(relying on Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424 (1983)); Ferland v.\nConrad Credit Corp., 244 F. 3d 1145, 1148–1151, and n. 4 (CA9 2001)\n24            JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                   KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\nand §1692k(a)(3) authorizes courts to award attorney’s\nfees to the defendant if a plaintiff’s suit “was brought in\nbad faith and for the purpose of harassment.”\n   Lawyers also have recourse to the affirmative defense in\n§1692k(c). Not every uncertainty presented in litigation\nstems from interpretation of the requirements of the Act\nitself; lawyers may invoke the bona fide error defense, for\ninstance, where a violation results from a qualifying fac\ntual error. Jerman and the Government suggest that\nlawyers can entirely avoid the risk of misinterpreting the\nAct by obtaining an advisory opinion from the FTC under\n§1692k(e). Carlisle fairly observes that the FTC has not\nfrequently issued such opinions, and that the average\nprocessing time may present practical difficulties. Indeed,\nthe Government informed us at oral argument that the\nFTC has issued only four opinions in the past decade (in\nresponse to seven requests), and the FTC’s response time\n——————\n(per curiam); see generally Hobbs, Fair Debt Collection §6.8.6. In\nSchlacher, for instance, the court affirmed a downward adjustment for\nthe “unnecessary use of multiple attorneys . . . in a straightforward,\nshort-lived [FDCPA] case.” 574 F. 3d, at 854–855. In Carroll, the court\nfound no abuse of discretion in a District Court’s award of a $500\nattorney’s fee, rather than the lodestar amount, where the lawsuit had\nrecovered only $50 in damages for “at most a technical violation” of the\nFDCPA. 53 F. 3d, at 629–631.\n  Lower courts have taken different views about when, and whether,\n§1692k requires an award of attorney’s fees. Compare Tolentino v.\nFriedman, 46 F. 3d 645 (CA7 1995) (award of fees to a successful\nplaintiff “mandatory”), and Emanuel, supra, at 808–809 (same, even\nwhere the plaintiff suffered no actual damages), with Graziano, 950 F.\n2d, at 114, and n. 13 (attorney’s fees may be denied for plaintiff’s “bad\nfaith conduct”), and Johnson v. Eaton, 80 F. 3d 148, 150–152 (CA5\n1996) (“attorney’s fees . . . are only available [under §1692k] where the\nplaintiff has succeeded in establishing that the defendant is liable for\nactual and/or additional damages”; this reading “will deter suits\nbrought only as a means of generating attorney’s fees”). We need not\nresolve these issues today to express doubt that our reading\nof §1692k(c) will impose unmanageable burdens on debt collecting\nlawyers.\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           25\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhas typically been three or four months. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n27–28, 30. Without disregarding the possibility that the\nFTC advisory opinion process might be useful in some\ncases, evidence of present administrative practice makes\nus reluctant to place significant weight on §1692k(e) as a\npractical remedy for the concerns Carlisle has identified.\n   We are unpersuaded by what seems an implicit premise\nof Carlisle’s arguments: that the bona fide error defense is\na debt collector’s sole recourse to avoid potential liability.\nWe addressed a similar argument in Heintz, in which the\npetitioner urged that certain of the Act’s substantive\nprovisions would generate “ ‘anomalies’ ” if the term “debt\ncollector” was read to include litigating lawyers. 514\nU. S., at 295. Among other things, the petitioner in Heintz\ncontended that §1692c(c)’s bar on further communication\nwith a consumer who notifies a debt collector that she is\nrefusing to pay the debt would prohibit a lawyer from\nfiling a lawsuit to collect the debt. Id., at 296–297. We\nagreed it would be “odd” if the Act interfered in this way\nwith “an ordinary debt-collecting lawsuit” but suggested\n§1692c(c) did not demand such a reading in light of several\nexceptions in the text of that provision itself. Ibid. As in\nHeintz, we need not authoritatively interpret the Act’s\nconduct-regulating provisions to observe that those provi\nsions should not be assumed to compel absurd results\nwhen applied to debt collecting attorneys.\n   To the extent the FDCPA imposes some constraints on a\nlawyer’s advocacy on behalf of a client, it is hardly unique\nin our law. “[A]n attorney’s ethical duty to advance the\ninterests of his client is limited by an equally solemn duty\nto comply with the law and standards of professional\nconduct.” Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U. S. 157, 168 (1986).\nLawyers face sanctions, among other things, for suits\npresented “for any improper purpose, such as to harass,\ncause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of\nlitigation.” Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 11(b), (c). Model rules of\n26            JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                   KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\nprofessional conduct adopted by many States impose outer\nbounds on an attorney’s pursuit of a client’s interests.\nSee, e.g., ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct 3.1\n(2009) (requiring nonfrivolous basis in law and fact for\nclaims asserted); 4.1 (truthfulness to third parties). In\nsome circumstances, lawyers may face personal liability\nfor conduct undertaken during representation of a client.\nSee, e.g., Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate\nBank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 191 (1994) (“Any\nperson or entity, including a lawyer, . . . who employs a\nmanipulative device or makes a material misstatement (or\nomission) on which a purchaser or seller of securities\nrelies may be liable as a primary violator under [Securities\nand Exchange Commission Rule] 10b–5”).\n   Moreover, a lawyer’s interest in avoiding FDCPA liabil\nity may not always be adverse to her client. Some courts\nhave held clients vicariously liable for their lawyers’ viola\ntions of the FDCPA. See, e.g., Fox v. Citicorp Credit\nServs., Inc., 15 F. 3d 1507, 1516 (CA9 1994); see also First\nInterstate Bank of Fort Collins, N. A. v. Soucie, 924 P. 2d\n1200, 1202 (Colo. App. 1996).\n   The suggestion that our reading of §1692k(c) will create\nunworkable consequences is also undermined by the exis\ntence of numerous state consumer protection and debt\ncollection statutes that contain bona fide error defenses\nthat are either silent as to, or expressly exclude, legal\nerrors.17 Several States have enacted debt collection\nstatutes that contain neither an exemption for attorney\ndebt collectors nor any bona fide error defense at all. See,\ne.g., Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 93, §49 (West 2008); Md. Com.\nLaw Code Ann. §14–203 (Lexis 2005); Ore. Rev. Stat.\n\n——————\n  17 SeeBrief for Ohio Creditor’s Attorneys Association et al. as Amici\nCuriae 4–6, and nn. 7–8 (identifying “134 state consumer protection\nand debt collection statutes,” 42 of which expressly exclude legal errors\nfrom their defenses for bona fide errors).\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

More\ngenerally, a group of 21 States as amici supporting Jer\nman inform us they are aware of “no [judicial] decisions\ninterpreting a parallel state bona fide error provision [in a\ncivil regulatory statute] to immunize a defendant’s mis\ntake of law,” except in a minority of statutes that ex\npressly provide to the contrary.18 See Brief for State of\nNew York et al. as Amici Curiae 11, and n. 6. Neither\nCarlisle and its amici nor the dissent demonstrate that\nlawyers have suffered drastic consequences under these\nstate regimes.\n  In the dissent’s view, these policy concerns are evidence\nthat “Congress could not have intended” the reading we\nadopt today. Post, at 5. But the dissent’s reading raises\nconcerns of its own. The dissent focuses on the facts of\nthis case, in which an attorney debt collector, in the dis\nsent’s view, “acted reasonably at every step” and commit\nted a “technical violation” resulting in no “actual harm” to\nthe debtor. Post, at 12, 6, 8. But the dissent’s legal theory\ndoes not limit the defense to attorney debt collectors or\n“technical” violations.19 Under that approach, it appears,\nnonlawyer debt collectors could obtain blanket immunity\nfor mistaken interpretations of the FDCPA simply by\nseeking the advice of legal counsel. Moreover, many debt\ncollectors are compensated with a percentage of money\nrecovered, and so will have a financial incentive to press\n——————\n  18 See, e.g., Kan. Stat. Ann. §16a–5–201(7) (2007) (provision of Kansas\nConsumer Credit Code providing a defense for a “bona fide error of law\nor fact”); Ind. Code §24–9–5–5 (West 2004) (defense for creditor’s “bona\nfide error of law or fact” in Indiana Home Loan Practices Act).\n   19 The dissent also downplays the predicate fact that respondents in\n\nthis case brought a foreclosure lawsuit against Jerman for a debt she\nhad already repaid. Neither the lower courts nor this Court have been\nasked to consider, and thus we express no view about, whether Carlisle\ncould be subject to liability under the FDCPA for that uncontested\nerror—regardless of how reasonably Carlisle may have acted after the\nmistake was pointed out by Jerman’s (privately retained) lawyer.\n28            JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                   KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthe boundaries of the Act’s prohibitions on collection tech\nniques. It is far from obvious why immunizing debt collec\ntors who adopt aggressive but mistaken interpretations of\nthe law would be consistent with the statute’s broadly\nworded prohibitions on debt collector misconduct. Jerman\nand her amici express further concern that the dissent’s\nreading would give a competitive advantage to debt collec\ntors who press the boundaries of lawful conduct. They\nforesee a “race to the bottom” driving ethical collectors out\nof business. Brief for Petitioner 32; Brief for Public Citi\nzen et al. as Amici Curiae 16–18. It is difficult to square\nsuch a result with Congress’ express purpose “to eliminate\nabusive debt collection practices by debt collectors, [and]\nto insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using\nabusive debt collection practices are not competitively\ndisadvantaged,” §1692(e).\n  The dissent’s reading also invites litigation about a debt\ncollector’s subjective intent to violate the FDCPA and the\nadequacy of procedures maintained to avoid legal error.\nCf. Barlow, 7 Pet., at 411 (maxim that ignorance of the\nlaw will not excuse civil or criminal liability “results from\nthe extreme difficulty of ascertaining what is, bona fide,\nthe interpretation of the party”).         Courts that read\n§1692k(c) to permit a mistake-of-law defense have adopted\nvarying formulations of what legal procedures are “rea\nsonably adapted to avoid any [legal] error.”20 Among other\nuncertainties, the dissent does not explain whether it\n\n——————\n  20 Compare Hartman v.

Riddle, 443 F. 3d 723,\n730–731 (CA10 2006) (suggesting that researching case law and filing a\ntest case might be sufficient, but remanding for a jury determination of\nwhether the “limited [legal] analysis” undertaken was sufficient and\nwhether the test case was in fact a “sham”).\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

The increased\ncost to prospective plaintiffs in time, fees, and uncertainty\nof outcome may chill private suits under the statutory\nright of action, undermining the FDCPA’s calibrated\nscheme of statutory incentives to encourage self\nenforcement. Cf. FTC, Collecting Consumer Debts: The\nChallenge of Change 67 (2009) (“Because the Commission\nreceives more than 70,000 third-party debt collection\ncomplaints per year, it is not feasible for federal govern\nment law enforcement to be the exclusive or primary\nmeans of deterring all possible law violations”). The state\namici predict that, on the dissent’s reading, consumers\nwill have little incentive to bring enforcement actions\n“where the law [i]s at all unsettled, because in such cir\ncumstances a debt collector could easily claim bona fide\nerror of law”; in the States’ view, the resulting “enforce\nment gap” would be “extensive” at both the federal and\nState levels. See Brief for State of New York et al. as\nAmici Curiae 7–10. In short, the policy concerns identified\nby the dissent tell only half the story.21\n  In sum, we do not foresee that our decision today will\nplace unmanageable burdens on lawyers practicing in the\ndebt collection industry. To the extent debt collecting\nlawyers face liability for mistaken interpretations of the\nrequirements of the FDCPA, Carlisle, its amici, and the\ndissent have not shown that “the result [will be] so absurd\nas to warrant” disregarding the weight of textual author\n——————\n  21 The dissent adds in passing that today’s decision “creates serious\n\nconcerns . . . for First Amendment rights.” Post, at 13 (citing Legal\nServices Corporation v.

We decline to express any view on it. See Cutter v. Wilkinson,\n544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005).\n30            JERMAN v.

Absent\nsuch a showing, arguments that the Act strikes an unde\nsirable balance in assigning the risks of legal misinterpre\ntation are properly addressed to Congress. To the extent\nCongress is persuaded that the policy concerns identified\nby the dissent require a recalibration of the FDCPA’s\nliability scheme, it is, of course, free to amend the statute\naccordingly.22 Congress has wide latitude, for instance, to\nrevise §1692k to excuse some or all mistakes of law or\ngrant broader discretion to district courts to adjust a\nplaintiff’s recovery. This Court may not, however, read\nmore into §1692k(c) than the statutory language naturally\nsupports. We therefore hold that the bona fide error de\nfense in §1692k(c) does not apply to a violation of the\nFDCPA resulting from a debt collector’s incorrect interpre\ntation of the requirements of that statute.\n                        *     *  *\n  For the reasons discussed above, the judgment of the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  22 The FDCPA has been amended some eight times since its enact\n\nment in 1977; the most recent amendment addressed a concern not\nunrelated to the question we consider today, specifying that a pleading\nin a civil action is not an “initial communication” triggering obligations\nunder §1692g requiring a written notice to the consumer.

Can those\nlawyers act in the best interests of their clients if they face\npersonal liability when they rely on good-faith interpreta\ntions of the Act that are later rejected by a court? Or will\nthat threat of personal liability lead them to do less than\ntheir best for those clients?\n   As the majority points out, however, the statute offers a\nway out of—though not a panacea for—this dilemma.\nAnte, at 13–14, 24–25. Faced with legal uncertainty, a\nlawyer can turn to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC or\nCommission) for an advisory opinion. 16 CFR §§1.1 to 1.4\n(2009). And once he receives that opinion and acts upon it\nthe dilemma disappears: If he fails to follow the opinion,\nhe has not acted in good faith and can fairly be held liable.\nIf he follows the opinion, the statute frees him from any\nsuch liability. 15 U. S. C. §1692k(e) (debt collectors im\nmune from liability for “any act done or omitted in . . .\nconformity with any advisory opinion of the [Federal\nTrade] Commission”). See also R.

S. 624,\n645 (1998), that Congress’s repetition, in a new statute, of\nstatutory language with a “ ‘settled’ ” judicial interpreta\ntion indicates “ ‘the intent to incorporate its . . . judicial\ninterpretations as well,’ ” the Court concludes that these\nthree Court of Appeals cases “suppor[t] an inference that\nCongress understood the statutory formula it chose for the\nFDCPA consistent with Federal Court of Appeals interpre\ntations of TILA.” Ante, at 14–16.\n   Let me assume (though I do not believe it) that what\ncounts is what Congress “intended,” even if that intent\nfinds no expression in the enacted text. When a large\nmajority of the Circuits, over a lengthy period of time,\nhave uniformly reached a certain conclusion as to the\nmeaning of a particular statutory text, it may be reason\n2            JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                  KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J. \n\n\nable to assume that Congress was aware of those holdings,\ntook them to be correct, and intended the same meaning in\nadopting that text.1 It seems to me unreasonable, how\never, to assume that, when Congress has a bill before it\nthat contains language used in an earlier statute, it is\naware of, and approves as correct, a mere three Court of\nAppeals decisions interpreting that earlier statute over\nthe previous nine years. Can one really believe that a\nmajority in both Houses of Congress knew of those three\ncases, and accepted them as correct (even when, as was\nthe case here, some District Court opinions and a State\nSupreme Court opinion had concluded, to the contrary,\nthat the defense covered legal errors, see ante, at 14–15,\nn. 10)? This is a legal fiction, which has nothing to be said\nfor it except that it can sometimes make our job easier.\nThe Court acknowledges that “the interpretations of three\nFederal Courts of Appeals may not have ‘settled’ the\nmeaning of TILA’s bona fide error defense,” but says\n“there is no reason to suppose that Congress disagreed\nwith those interpretations.” Ante, at 15–16. Perhaps not;\nbut no reason to suppose that it knew of and agreed with\nthem either—which is presumably the proposition for\nwhich the Court cites them.\n   Even assuming, moreover, that Congress knew and\napproved of those cases, they would not support the\nCourt’s conclusion today. All three of them said that\nTILA’s bona fide error defense covered only clerical errors.\nSee Ives v. W. T. Grant Co., 522 F. 2d 749, 758 (CA2 1975)\n(“only available for clerical errors”); Haynes v. Logan\n——————\n   1 Of course where so many federal courts have read the language that\n\nway, the text was probably clear enough that resort to unexpressed\ncongressional intent would be unnecessary. Or indeed it could be said\nthat such uniform and longstanding judicial interpretation had estab\nlished the public meaning of the text, whether the Members of Con\ngress were aware of the cases or not. That would be the understanding\nof the text by reasonable people familiar with its legal context.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

Wilson, 502\nF. 2d 860, 861 (CA9 1974) (“[C]lerical errors . . . are the\nonly violations this section was designed to excuse”). Yet\nthe Court specifically interprets the identical language in\nthe FDCPA as providing a defense not only for clerical\nerrors, but also for factual errors. See ante, at 19, 24; see\nalso ante, at 20–21 (suggesting the same). If the Court\nreally finds the three Courts of Appeals’ interpretations of\nTILA indicative of congressional intent in the FDCPA, it\nshould restrict its decision accordingly. As for me, I sup\nport the Court’s inclusion of factual errors, because there\nis nothing in the text of the FDCPA limiting the excusable\n“not intentional” violations to those based on clerical\nerrors, and since there is a long tradition in the common\nlaw and in our construction of federal statutes distinguish\ning errors of fact from errors of law.\n   The Court’s opinion also makes fulsome use of that\nother legal fiction, legislative history, ranging from a\nsingle Representative’s floor remarks on the House bill\nthat became the FDCPA, ante, at 16, n. 11, to a single\nRepresentative’s remarks in a Senate Subcommittee\nhearing on the House bill and three Senate bills, ibid., to\ntwo 1979 Senate Committee Reports dealing not with the\nFDCPA but with the 1980 amendments to TILA, ante, at\n17, n. 12, to remarks in a Committee markup of the Sen\nate bill on the FDCPA, ante, at 21–22, n. 14, to a House\nReport dealing with an earlier version of the FDCPA, ibid.\nIs the conscientious attorney really expected to dig out\nsuch mini-nuggets of “congressional intent” from floor\nremarks, committee hearings, committee markups, and\ncommittee reports covering many different bills over many\nyears? When the Court addresses such far-afield legisla\ntive history merely “for the sake of completeness,” ante, at\n20, it encourages and indeed prescribes such wasteful\nover-lawyering.\n4            JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                  KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J. \n\n\n   As it happens, moreover, one of the supposedly most\n“authoritative” snippets of legislative history, a Senate\nCommittee Report dealing with the meaning of TILA,\nstates very clearly that the 1980 amendment to TILA’s\nbona fide error defense “clarified” the defense “to make\nclear that it applies to mechanical and computer errors,”\nS. Rep. No. 96–73, pp. 7–8 (1979). Likewise, the 1999\nAmerican Law Report the Court cites, ante, at 17, n. 12,\nwhich relies on another Senate Committee Report, de\nscribes the amendment as clarifying the “prevailing view”\nthat the defense “applies to clerical errors,” Lockhart, 153\nA. L. R. Fed. 211–212, §2[a] (1999).2 Once again, the legal\nfiction contradicts the Court’s conclusion that the lan\nguage in the FDCPA, identical to the original TILA de\nfense, applies to mistakes of fact.\n   But if legislative history is to be used, it should be used\nimpartially. (Legislative history, after all, almost always\nhas something for everyone!) The Court dismisses with a\nwave of the hand what seems to me the most persuasive\nlegislative history (if legislative history could ever be\npersuasive) in the case. The respondents point to the\nSenate Committee Report on the FDCPA, which says that\n“[a] debt collector has no liability . . . if he violates the act\nin any manner, including with regard to the act’s coverage,\nwhen such violation is unintentional and occurred despite\nprocedures designed to avoid such violations.” S. Rep. No.\n95–382, p. 5 (1977) (emphasis added). The Court claims\nthat a mistake about “the act’s coverage” in this passage\nmight refer to factual mistakes, such as a debt collector’s\nmistaken belief “that a particular debt arose out of a\nnonconsumer transaction and was therefore not ‘covered’\n——————\n  2 The page cited in the Senate Committee Report does not actually\n\nsupport the American Law Report’s statement. It makes no mention of\nclarification or judicial interpretations; it merely states that the\namendment is intended to “provide protection where errors are clerical\nor mechanical in nature,” S. Rep. No. 96–368, p. 32 (1979).\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nby the Act,” ante, at 21. The Court’s explanation seems to\nme inadequate. No lawyer—indeed, no one speaking\naccurately—would equate a mistake regarding the Act’s\ncoverage with a mistake regarding whether a particular\nfact situation falls within the Act’s coverage. What the\nAct covers (“the act’s coverage”) is one thing; whether a\nparticular case falls within the Act’s coverage is something\nelse.\n   Even if (contrary to my perception) the phrase could be\nused to refer to both these things, by what principle does\nthe Court reject the more plausible meaning? The fact\nthat “attorneys were excluded from the Act’s definition of\n‘debt collector’ until 1986,” ibid., does not, as the Court\ncontends, support its conclusion that errors of law are not\ncovered. Attorneys are not the only ones who would have\nbeen able to claim a legal-error defense; non-attorneys\nmake legal mistakes too. They also sometimes receive and\nrely upon erroneous legal advice from attorneys. Indeed,\nif anyone could satisfy the defense’s requirement of main\ntaining “procedures reasonably adapted to avoid” a legal\nerror, it would be a non-attorney debt collector who fol\nlows the procedure of directing all legal questions to his\nattorney.\n   The Court also points to “equivocal” evidence from the\nSenate Committee’s final markup session, ante, at 21–22,\nn. 14, but it minimizes a decidedly unhelpful discussion of\nthe scope of the defense during the session. In response to\nconcern that the defense would be construed, like the\nTILA defense, as “only protecting against a mathematical\nerror,” a staff member explained that, because of differ\nences in the nature of the statutes, the FDCPA defense\nwas broader than the TILA defense and “would apply to\nany violation of the act which was unintentional.” See\nSenate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Af\nfairs, Markup Session: S. 1130—Debt Collection Legisla\ntion 20–21 (July 26, 1977) (emphasis added).

To which the staff member responded:\n“That’s correct.” Ibid. The repeated use of “any”—“any\nviolation” and “any bona fide error”—supports the natural\nreading of the Committee Report’s statement regarding\n“the act’s coverage” as including legal errors about the\nscope of the Act, rather than just factual errors.\n  The Court ultimately dismisses the Senate Committee\nReport on the ground that “the legislative record taken as\na whole does not lend strong support to Carlisle’s view.”\nAnte, at 21. I think it more reasonable to give zero weight\nto the other snippets of legislative history that the Court\nrelies upon, for the reason that the Senate Committee\nReport on the very bill that became the FDCPA flatly\ncontradicts them. It is almost invariably the case that our\nopinions benefit not at all from the make-weight use of\nlegislative history. But today’s opinion probably suffers\nfrom it. Better to spare us the results of legislative-history\nresearch, however painfully and exhaustively conducted it\nmight have been.\n  The Court’s textual analysis stands on its own, without\nneed of (or indeed any assistance from) the two fictions I\nhave discussed. Accordingly, I concur in the judgment of\nthe Court.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

S. C. §1692 et seq. The\nstatute excepts from liability a debt collector’s “bona fide\nerror[s],” provided that they were “not intentional” and\nreasonable procedures have been maintained to avoid\nthem. §1692k(c). The Court today interprets this excep\ntion to exclude legal errors. In doing so, it adopts a ques\ntionable interpretation and rejects a straightforward,\nquite reasonable interpretation of the statute’s plain\nterms. Its decision aligns the judicial system with those\nwho would use litigation to enrich themselves at the ex\npense of attorneys who strictly follow and adhere to pro\nfessional and ethical standards.\n   When the law is used to punish good-faith mistakes;\nwhen adopting reasonable safeguards is not enough to\navoid liability; when the costs of discovery and litigation\nare used to force settlement even absent fault or injury;\nwhen class-action suits transform technical legal viola\ntions into windfalls for plaintiffs or their attorneys, the\nCourt, by failing to adopt a reasonable interpretation to\ncounter these excesses, risks compromising its own insti\ntutional responsibility to ensure a workable and just\nlitigation system. The interpretation of the FDCPA the\n2           JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                 KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\nCourt today endorses will entrench, not eliminate, some of\nthe most troubling aspects of our legal system. Convinced\nthat Congress did not intend this result, I submit this\nrespectful dissent.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   The FDCPA addresses “abusive debt collection prac\ntices,” §1692(e), by regulating interactions between com\nmercial debt collectors and consumers. See ante, at 1–2.\nThe statute permits private suits against debt collectors\nwho violate its provisions. §1692k(a). An exception\nto liability is provided by the so-called bona fide error\ndefense:\n    “A debt collector may not be held liable in any action\n    . . . if the debt collector shows by a preponderance of\n    evidence that the violation was not intentional and\n    resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the\n    maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to\n    avoid any such error.” §1692k(c).\nThis language does not exclude mistakes of law and is\nmost naturally read to include them. Certainly a mis\ntaken belief about the law is, if held in good faith, a “bona\nfide error” as that phrase is normally understood. See\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 582 (8th ed. 2004) (defining “error”\nas “a belief that what is false is true or that what is true is\nfalse,” def. 1); ibid. (“[a] mistake of law or of fact in a\ntribunal’s judgment, opinion, or order,” def. 2); ibid. (list\ning categories of legal errors).\n   The choice of words provides further reinforcement for\nthis view. The bona fide error exception in §1692k(c)\napplies if “the violation was not intentional and resulted\nfrom a bona fide error.” The term “violation” specifically\ndenotes a legal infraction. See id., at 1600 (“An infraction\nor breach of the law; a transgression,” def. 1). The statu\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ntory term “violation” thus stands in direct contrast to\nother provisions of the FDCPA that describe conduct itself.\nThis applies both to specific terms, e.g., §1692e (“A debt\ncollector may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading\nrepresentation or means in connection with the collection\nof any debt”), and to more general ones, e.g., §1692k(e)\n(referring to “any act done or omitted in good faith”). By\nlinking the mens rea requirement (“not intentional”) with\nthe word “violation”—rather than with the conduct giving\nrise to the violation—the Act by its terms indicates that\nthe bona fide error exception applies to legal errors as well\nas to factual ones.\n   The Court’s precedents accord with this interpretation.\nFederal statutes that link the term “violation” with a mens\nrea requirement have been interpreted to excuse good\nfaith legal mistakes. See, e.g., McLaughlin v. Richland\nShoe Co., 486 U. S. 128, 129, 133 (1988) (the phrase “aris\ning out of a willful violation” in the Fair Labor Standards\nAct applies where an employer “either knew or showed\nreckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct\nwas prohibited by the statute”); Trans World Airlines, Inc.\nv. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 125, 126 (1985) (damages\nprovision under the Age Discrimination in Employment\nAct, which applies “only in cases of willful violations,”\ncreates liability where an employer “knew or showed\nreckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct\nwas prohibited by the ADEA” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)); cf. Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S. 419, 428\n(1985) (prohibition on use of food stamps “ ‘knowing [them]\nto have been received . . . in violation of’ ” federal law\n“undeniably requires a knowledge of illegality” (emphasis\ndeleted)). The FDCPA’s use of “violation” thus distin\nguishes it from most of the authorities relied upon by the\nCourt to demonstrate that mistake-of-law defenses are\ndisfavored. See, e.g., ante, at 7–8 (citing Kolstad v. Ameri\ncan Dental Assn., 527 U. S. 526 (1999)).\n4          JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                  KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\n   The Court’s response is that there is something distinc\ntive about the word “willful” that suggests an excuse for\nmistakes of law. This may well be true for criminal stat\nutes, in which the terms “ ‘knowing,’ ‘intentional’ [and]\n‘willful’ ” have been distinguished in this regard. Ante, at\n10 (citing Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47,\n57 (2007)). But this distinction is specific to the criminal\ncontext:\n    “It is different in the criminal law. When the term\n    ‘willful’ or ‘willfully’ has been used in a criminal stat\n    ute, we have regularly read the modifier as limiting\n    liability to knowing violations. This reading of the\n    term, however, is tailored to the criminal law, where\n    it is characteristically used to require a criminal in\n    tent beyond the purpose otherwise required for guilt,\n    or an additional ‘bad purpose,’ or specific intent to vio\n    late a known legal duty created by highly technical\n    statutes.” Id., at 57–58, n. 9 (citations omitted).\nFor this reason, the Court’s citation to criminal cases,\nwhich are themselves inconsistent, see Ratzlaf v. United\nStates, 510 U. S. 135 (1994), is unavailing. See ante, at\n10–11, and n. 7.\n  In the civil context, by contrast, the word “willful” has\nbeen used to impose a mens rea threshold for liability that\nis lower, not higher, than an intentionality requirement.\nSee Safeco, supra, at 57 (“[W]here willfulness is a statu\ntory condition of civil liability, we have generally taken it\nto cover not only knowing violations of a standard, but\nreckless ones as well”). Avoiding liability under a statute\naimed at intentional violations should therefore be easier,\nnot harder, than avoiding liability under a statute aimed\nat willful violations. And certainly there is nothing in\nThurston or McLaughlin—both civil cases—suggesting\nthat they would have come out differently had the rele\nvant statutes used “intentional violation” rather than\n                   Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)         5\n\n                       KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n“willful violation.”\n                             B\n   These considerations suffice to show that §1692k(c) is\nmost reasonably read to include mistakes of law. Even if\nthis were merely a permissible reading, however, it should\nbe adopted to avoid the adverse consequences that must\nflow from the Court’s contrary decision. The Court’s read\ning leads to results Congress could not have intended.\n                              1\n   The FDCPA is but one of many federal laws that Con\ngress has enacted to protect consumers. A number of\nthese statutes authorize the filing of private suits against\nthose who use unfair or improper practices. See, e.g., 15\nU. S. C. §1692k (FDCPA); §1640 (Truth in Lending Act);\n§1681n (Fair Credit Reporting Act); 49 U. S. C. §32710\n(Federal Odometer Disclosure Act); 11 U. S. C. §526(c)(2)\n(Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection\nAct of 2005). Several of these provisions permit a success\nful plaintiff to recover—in addition to actual damages—\nstatutory damages, attorney’s fees and costs, and in some\ncases punitive damages. E.g., 15 U. S. C. §1640(a)(2)\n(statutory damages); §1640(a)(3) (attorney’s fees and\ncosts); §1681n(a)(1)(B) (statutory and punitive damages);\n§1681n(a)(1)(B)(3) (costs and attorney’s fees); 49 U. S. C.\n§32710(a) (“3 times the actual damages or $1,500, which\never is greater”); §32710(b) (costs and attorney’s fees); 11\nU. S. C. §526(c)(3)(A) (costs and attorney’s fees). Some\nalso explicitly permit class-action suits. E.g., 15 U. S. C.\n§1640(a)(2)(B); §1692k(a)(2)(B).\n   A collateral effect of these statutes may be to create\nincentives to file lawsuits even where no actual harm has\noccurred. This happens when the plaintiff can recover\nstatutory damages for the violation and his or her attorney\nwill receive fees if the suit is successful, no matter how\nslight the injury. A favorable verdict after trial is not\n6           JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                 KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\nnecessarily the goal; often the plaintiff will be just as\nhappy with a settlement, as will his or her attorney (who\nwill receive fees regardless). The defendant, meanwhile,\nmay conclude a quick settlement is preferable to the costs\nof discovery and a protracted trial. And if the suit attains\nclass-action status, the financial stakes rise in magnitude.\nSee, e.g., §1640(a)(2)(B) (class-action recovery of up to “the\nlesser of $500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the\n[defendant]”); §1692k(a)(2)(B) (same).\n   The present case offers an object lesson. Respondents\nfiled a complaint in state court on behalf of a client that\nmistakenly believed Jerman owed money to it. Jerman’s\nattorney then informed respondents that the debt had\nbeen paid in full. Respondents confirmed this fact with\nthe client and withdrew the lawsuit.\n   This might have been the end of the story. But because\nrespondents had informed Jerman that she was required\nto dispute the debt in writing, she filed a class-action\ncomplaint. It did not matter that Jerman had claimed no\nharm as a result of respondents’ actions. Jerman sued for\ndamages, attorney’s fees, and costs—including class dam\nages of “$500,000 or 1% of defendants’ net worth which\never is less.” Amended Complaint in No. 1:06–CV–01397\n(ND Ohio), p. 4. In addition to merits-related discovery,\nJerman sought information from respondents concerning\nthe income and net worth of each partner in the firm. At\nsome point, Jerman proposed to settle with respondents\nfor $15,000 in damages and $7,500 in attorney’s fees.\nAmended Joint App. in No. 07–3964 (CA6), pp. 256–262.\nThe case illustrates how a technical violation of a complex\nfederal statute can give rise to costly litigation with incen\ntives to settle simply to avoid attorney’s fees.\n   Today’s holding gives new impetus to this already trou\nbling dynamic of allowing certain actors in the system to\nspin even good-faith, technical violations of federal law\ninto lucrative litigation, if not for themselves then for the\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nattorneys who conceive of the suit. See Federal Home\nLoan Mortgage Corp. v. Lamar, 503 F. 3d 504, 513 (CA6\n2007) (referring to the “cottage industry” of litigation that\nhas arisen out of the FDCPA (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). It is clear that Congress, too, was troubled by\nthis dynamic. That is precisely why it enacted a bona fide\nerror defense. The Court’s ruling, however, endorses and\ndrives forward this dynamic, for today’s holding leaves\nattorneys and their clients vulnerable to civil liability for\nadopting good-faith legal positions later determined to be\nmistaken, even if reasonable efforts were made to avoid\nmistakes.\n   The Court seeks to brush aside these concerns by noting\nthat trivial violations will give rise to little in the way of\nactual damages and that trial courts “have discretion in\ncalculating reasonable attorney’s fees under [the] statute.”\nAnte, at 23. It is not clear, however, that a court is per\nmitted to adjust a fee award based on its assessment of\nthe suit’s utility. Cf. Perdue v. Kenny A., post, at 9 (noting\na “ ‘strong presumption’ ” of reasonableness that attaches\nto a lodestar calculation of attorney’s fees). Though the\nCourt, properly, does not address the question here, it\nacknowledges that some courts have deemed fee awards to\nvictorious plaintiffs to be “ ‘mandatory,’ ” even if the plain\ntiff suffered no damage. Ante, at 23–24, n. 16.\n   The Court’s second response is that the FDCPA guards\nagainst abusive suits and that suits brought “ ‘in bad faith\nand for the purpose of harassment’ ” can lead to a fee\naward for the defendant.            Ante, at 24 (quoting\n§1692k(a)(3)). Yet these safeguards cannot deter suits\nbased on technical—but harmless—violations of the stat\nute. If the plaintiff obtains a favorable judgment or a\nsettlement, then by definition the suit will not have been\nbrought in bad faith. See Emanuel v. American Credit\nExch., 870 F. 2d 805, 809 (CA2 1989) (FDCPA defendant’s\n“claim for malicious prosecution cannot succeed unless the\n8          JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                  KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\naction subject of the claim is unsuccessful”).\n   Again the present case is instructive. Jerman brought\nsuit without pointing to any actual harm that resulted\nfrom respondents’ actions. At the time her complaint was\nfiled, it was an open question in the Sixth Circuit whether\na debt collector could demand that a debt be disputed in\nwriting, and the district courts in the Circuit had reached\ndifferent answers. Ante, at 4, n. 2. The trial court in this\ncase happened to side with Jerman on the issue, 464\nF. Supp. 2d 720, 722–725 (ND Ohio 2006), but it seems\nunlikely that the court would have labeled her suit “abu\nsive” or “in bad faith” even if it had gone the other way.\n   There is no good basis for optimism, then, when one\ncontemplates the practical consequences of today’s deci\nsion. Given the complexity of the FDCPA regime, see 16\nCFR pt. 901 (2009) (FDCPA regulations), technical viola\ntions are likely to be common. Indeed, the Court acknowl\nedges that they are inevitable. See ante, at 12. As long as\nlegal mistakes occur, plaintiffs and their attorneys will\nhave an incentive to bring suits for these infractions. It\nseems unlikely that Congress sought to create a system\nthat encourages costly and time-consuming litigation over\nharmless violations committed in good faith despite rea\nsonable safeguards.\n   When construing a federal statute, courts should be\nmindful of the effect of the interpretation on congressional\npurposes explicit in the statutory text. The FDCPA states\nan objective that today’s decision frustrates. The statu\ntory purpose was to “eliminate abusive debt collection\npractices” and to ensure that debt collectors who refrain\nfrom using those practices “are not competitively disad\nvantaged.” 15 U. S. C. §1692(e) (“Purposes”). The prac\ntices Congress addressed involved misconduct that is\ndeliberate, see §1692(a) (“abusive, deceptive, and unfair\ndebt collection practices”); §1692(c) (“misrepresentation or\nother abusive debt collection practices”), or unreasonable,\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nsee §1692c(a)(1) (prohibiting debt collectors from commu\nnicating with debtors at times “which should be known” to\nbe inconvenient); §1692e(8) (prohibiting the communica\ntion of credit card information “which should be known to\nbe false”). That explains the statutory objective not to\ndisadvantage debt collectors who “refrain” from abusive\npractices—that is to say, debt collectors who do not inten\ntionally or unreasonably adopt them. It further explains\nwhy Congress included a good-faith error exception,\nwhich exempts violations that are not intentional or\nunreasonable.\n   In referring to “abusive debt collection practices,” how\never, surely Congress did not contemplate attorneys who\nact based on reasonable, albeit ultimately mistaken, legal\ninterpretations. A debt collector does not gain a competi\ntive advantage by making good-faith legal errors any more\nthan by making good-faith factual errors. This is ex\npressly so if the debt collector has implemented “proce\ndures reasonably adapted to avoid” them. By reading\n§1692k(c) to exclude good-faith mistakes of law, the Court\nfails to align its interpretation with the statutory\nobjectives.\n   The Court urges, nevertheless, that there are policy\nconcerns on the other side. The Court frets about debt\ncollectors who “press the boundaries of the Act’s prohibi\ntions” and about a potential “ ‘race to the bottom.’ ” Ante,\nat 27–28 (quoting Brief for Petitioner 32). For instance, in\nits view, interpreting §1692k(c) to encompass legal mis\ntakes might mean that “nonlawyer debt collectors could\nobtain blanket immunity for mistaken interpretations of\nthe FDCPA simply by seeking the advice of legal counsel.”\nAnte, at 27. It must be remembered, however, that\n§1692k(c) may only be invoked where the debt collector’s\nerror is “bona fide” and where “reasonable procedures”\nhave been adopted to avoid errors. There is no valid or\npersuasive reason to assume that Congress would want to\n10         JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                  KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\nimpose liability on a debt collector who relies in good faith\non the reasonable advice of counsel. If anything, we\nshould expect Congress to think that such behavior should\nbe encouraged, not discouraged.\n   The Court also suggests that reading §1692k(c) to in\nclude legal errors would encourage litigation over a num\nber of issues: what subjective intent is necessary for liabil\nity; what procedures are necessary to avoid legal mistakes;\nwhat standard applies to procedures adopted by attorney\ndebt collectors as compared to non-attorney debt collec\ntors. Yet these questions are no different from ones al\nready raised by the statute. Whether the debt collector is\nan attorney or not, his or her subjective intent must be\nassessed before liability can be determined. Procedures to\navoid mistakes—whether legal or otherwise—must be\n“reasonable,” which is always a context-specific inquiry.\nThe Court provides no reason to think that legal errors\nraise concerns that differ in these respects from those\nraised by non-legal errors.\n                              2\n   There is a further and most serious reason to interpret\n§1692k(c) to include good-faith legal mistakes. In Heintz\nv. Jenkins, 514 U. S. 291 (1995), the Court held that at\ntorneys engaged in debt-collection litigation may be “debt\ncollectors” for purposes of the FDCPA. In reaching this\nconclusion the Court confronted the allegation that its\ninterpretation would produce the anomalous result that\nattorneys could be liable for bringing legal claims against\ndebtors if those claims ultimately proved unsuccessful.\nId., at 295. The Court rejected this argument. In doing so\nit said that §1692k(c) provides debt collectors with a de\nfense for their bona fide errors. Id., at 295.\n   Today the Court relies on Heintz to allay concerns about\nthe practical implications of its decision. Ante, at 25. Yet\nthe Court reads §1692k(c) to exclude mistakes of law,\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            11\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nthereby producing the very result that Heintz said would\nnot come about. Attorneys may now be held liable for\ntaking reasonable legal positions in good faith if those\npositions are ultimately rejected.\n   Attorneys are duty-bound to represent their clients with\ndiligence, creativity, and painstaking care, all within the\nconfines of the law. When statutory provisions have not\nyet been interpreted in a definitive way, principled advo\ncacy is to be prized, not punished. Surely this includes\noffering interpretations of a statute that are permissible,\neven if not yet settled. The FDCPA is a complex statute,\nand its provisions are subject to different interpretations.\nSee, e.g., ante, at 5, n. 4 (identifying splits of authority on\ntwo different FDCPA issues); Brief for National Associa\ntion of Retail Collection Attorneys as Amicus Curiae 5–6\n(identifying another split); see also ante, at 12. Attorneys\nwill often find themselves confronted with a statutory\nprovision that is susceptible to different but still reason\nable interpretations.\n   An attorney’s obligation in the face of uncertainty is to\ngive the client his or her best professional assessment of\nthe law’s mandate. Under the Court’s interpretation of\nthe FDCPA, however, even that might leave the attorney\nvulnerable to suit. For if the attorney proceeds based on\nan interpretation later rejected by the courts, today’s\ndecision deems that to be actionable as an intentional\n“violation,” with personal financial liability soon to follow.\nIndeed, even where a particular practice is compelled by\nexisting precedent, the attorney may be sued if that prece\ndent is later overturned.\n   These adverse consequences are evident in the instant\ncase. When respondents filed a foreclosure complaint\nagainst Jerman on behalf of their client, they had no\nreason to doubt that the debt was valid. They had every\nreason, furthermore, to believe that they were on solid\nlegal ground in asking her to dispute the amount owed in\n12          JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                 KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\nwriting. See, e.g., Graziano v. Harrison, 950 F. 2d 107,\n112 (CA3 1991) (written objection is necessary for coherent\nstatutory scheme and protects the debtor by “creat[ing] a\nlasting record of the fact that the debt has been disputed”).\nWhen Jerman disputed the debt, respondents verified that\nthe debt had been satisfied and withdrew the lawsuit.\nRespondents acted reasonably at every step, and yet may\nstill find themselves liable for a harmless violation.\n   After today’s ruling, attorneys can be punished for\nadvocacy reasonably deemed to be in compliance with the\nlaw or even required by it. This distorts the legal process.\nHenceforth, creditors’ attorneys of the highest ethical\nstanding are encouraged to adopt a debtor-friendly inter\npretation of every question, lest the attorneys themselves\nincur personal financial risk. It is most disturbing that\nthis Court now adopts a statutory interpretation that will\ninterject an attorney’s personal financial interests into the\nprofessional and ethical dynamics of the attorney-client\nrelationship. These consequences demonstrate how un\ntenable the Court’s statutory interpretation is and counsel\nin favor of a different reading. See Milavetz, Gallop &\nMilavetz, P. A. v. United States, 559 U. S. ___, ___, n. 5\n(2010) (slip op., at 16, n. 5) (rejecting a reading of federal\nlaw that “would seriously undermine the attorney-client\nrelationship”).\n   The Court’s response is that this possibility is nothing\nnew, because attorneys are already duty-bound to comply\nwith the law and with standards of professional conduct.\nAttorneys face sanctions for harassing behavior and frivo\nlous litigation, and in some cases misconduct may give rise\nto personal liability. Ante, at 25–26.\n   This response only underscores the problem with the\nCourt’s approach. By reading §1692k(c) to exclude mis\ntakes of law, the Court ensures that attorneys will face\nliability even when they have done nothing wrong—\nindeed, even when they have acted in accordance with\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ntheir professional responsibilities. Here respondents’ law\nfirm did not harass Jerman; it did not file a frivolous suit\nagainst her; it did not intentionally mislead her; it caused\nher no damages or injury. The firm acted upon a reason\nable legal interpretation that the District Court later\nthought to be mistaken. The District Court’s position, as\nall concede, was in conflict with other published, reasoned\nopinions. Ante, at 4, n. 2. (And in the instant case, nei\nther the Court of Appeals nor this Court has decided the\nissue. See ante, at 5, n. 3.) If the law firm can be pun\nished for making a good-faith legal error, then to be safe\nan attorney must always stick to the most debtor-friendly\ninterpretation of the statute, lest automatic liability follow\nif some later decision adopts a different rule. This dy\nnamic creates serious concerns, not only for the attorney\nclient relationship but also for First Amendment rights.\nCf. Legal Services Corporation v. Velazquez, 531 U. S. 533,\n545 (2001) (law restricting arguments available to attor\nneys “prohibits speech and expression upon which courts\nmust depend for the proper exercise of the judicial\npower”). We need not decide that these concerns rise to\nthe level of an independent constitutional violation, see\nante, at 29, n. 21, to recognize that they counsel against a\nproblematic interpretation of the statute. See Edward J.\nDeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr.\nTrades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988) (“[W]here an\notherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise\nserious constitutional problems, the Court will construe\nthe statute to avoid such problems unless such construc\ntion is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress”).\n   JUSTICE BREYER—although not the Court—argues that\nan attorney faced with legal uncertainty only needs to\nturn to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for an advi\nsory opinion. An attorney’s actions in conformity with the\nopinion will be shielded from liability. Ante, at 1 (concur\nring opinion) (citing 15 U. S. C. §1692k(e)). This argument\n14         JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                  KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\nmisconceives the practical realities of litigation. Filings\nand motions are made under pressing time constraints;\narguments must be offered quickly in reply; and strategic\ndecisions must be taken in the face of incomplete informa\ntion. Lawyers in practice would not consider this alterna\ntive at all realistic, particularly where the defense is\nneeded most.\n   And even were there time to generate a formal request\nto the FTC and wait an average of three or four months for\na response (assuming the FTC responds at all), the argu\nment assumes that an ambiguity in the statute is obvious,\nnot latent, that the problem is at once apparent, and that\na conscious decision to invoke FTC procedures can be\nmade. But the problem in many instances is that inter\npretive alternatives are not at once apparent. All this may\nexplain why, in the past decade, the FTC has issued only\nfour opinions in response to just seven requests. See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 27–28, 30. The FTC advisory process does not\nremedy the difficulties that the Court’s opinion will cause.\n   Even if an FTC opinion is obtained, moreover, the ethi\ncal dilemma of counsel is not resolved. If the FTC adopts\na position unfavorable to the client, the attorney may still\nbelieve the FTC is mistaken. Yet under today’s decision,\nthe attorney who in good faith continues to assert a rea\nsonable position to the contrary does so at risk of personal\nliability. This alters the ethical balance central to the\nadversary system; and it is, again, a reason for the Court\nto adopt a different, but still reasonable, interpretation to\navoid systemic disruption.\n                            II\n  The Court does not assert that its interpretation is\nclearly commanded by the text. Instead, its decision relies\non an amalgam of arguments that, taken together, are\nsaid to establish the superiority of its preferred reading.\nThis does not withstand scrutiny.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n   First, the Court relies on the maxim that “ ‘ignorance of\nthe law will not excuse any person, either civilly or crimi\nnally.’ ” Ante, at 6 (quoting Barlow v. United States, 7 Pet.\n404, 411 (1833)). There is no doubt that this principle “is\ndeeply rooted in the American legal system.” Cheek v.\nUnited States, 498 U. S. 192, 199 (1991). Yet it is unhelp\nful to the Court’s position. The maxim the Court cites is\nbased on the premise “that the law is definite and know\nable,” so that all must be deemed to know its mandate.\nIbid. See also O. Holmes, The Common Law 48 (1881)\n(“[T]o admit the excuse [of ignorance] at all would be to\nencourage ignorance where the law-maker has determined\nto make men know and obey”). In other words, citizens\ncannot avoid compliance with the law simply by demon\nstrating a failure to learn it.\n   The most straightforward application of this principle is\nto statutory provisions that delineate a category of prohib\nited conduct. These statutes will not be read to excuse\nlegal mistakes absent some indication that the legislature\nmeant to do so. See, e.g., Armour Packing Co. v. United\nStates, 209 U. S. 56, 70, 85–86 (1908) (rejecting the defen\ndant’s attempt to read a mistake-of-law defense into a\ncriminal statute forbidding shippers to “obtain or dispose\nof property at less than the regular rate established”);\nante, at 7–8 (discussing a federal statute imposing liability\nfor “intentional discrimination”).\n   In the present case, however, the Court is not asked\nwhether a mistake of law should excuse respondents from\na general prohibition that would otherwise cover their\nconduct. Rather, the issue is the scope of an express ex\nception to a general prohibition. There is good reason to\nthink the distinction matters. It is one thing to presume\nthat Congress does not intend to create an exception to a\ngeneral rule through silence; it is quite another to pre\nsume that an explicit statutory exception should be con\nfined despite the existence of other sensible interpreta\n16          JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                 KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\ntions. Cf. Kosak v. United States, 465 U. S. 848, 853, n. 9\n(1984) (although the Federal Tort Claims Act waives\nsovereign immunity, “the proper objective of a court at\ntempting to construe [an exception to the Act] is to identify\nthose circumstances which are within the words and\nreason of the exception—no less and no more” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). This is all the more true\nwhere the other possible interpretations are more consis\ntent with the purposes of the regulatory scheme. By its\nterms, §1692k(c) encompasses—without limitation—all\nviolations that are “not intentional and resul[t] from a\nbona fide error.” The Court provides no reason to read\nthis language narrowly.\n   The Court responds that “our precedents have made\nclear for more than 175 years” that the presumption\nagainst mistake-of-law defenses applies even to explicit\nstatutory exceptions. Ante, 6–7, n. 5. By this the Court\nmeans that one case applied the presumption to an excep\ntion more than 175 years ago. In Barlow, the Court de\nclined to excuse an alleged mistake of law despite a statu\ntory provision that excepted “false denomination[s] . . .\n[that] happened by mistake or accident, and not from any\nintention to defraud the revenue.” 7 Pet., at 406. In\nconstruing this language, the Barlow Court noted that it\ndemonstrated congressional intent to exclude mistakes of\nlaw:\n     “The very association of mistake and accident, in this\n     [connection], furnishes a strong ground to presume\n     that the legislature had the same classes of cases in\n     view . . . . Mistakes in the construction of the law,\n     seem as little intended to be excepted by the proviso,\n     as accidents in the construction of the law.” Id., at\n     411–412.\nUnlike the provision at issue in Barlow, §1692k(c) gives no\nindication that its broad reference to “bona fide error[s]”\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          17\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nwas meant to exclude legal mistakes.\n   Even if statutory exceptions should normally be con\nstrued to exclude mistakes of law, moreover, that guide\nline would only apply absent intent to depart from the\ngeneral rule. There is no doubt that Congress may create\na mistake-of-law defense; the question is whether it has\ndone so here. See Ratzlaf, 510 U. S, at 149. As explained\nabove, see Part I–A, supra, Congress has made its choice\nplain by using the word “violation” in §1692k(c) to indicate\nthat mistakes of law are to be included.\n   Second, the Court attempts to draw a contrast between\n§1692k(c) and the administrative penalties in the Federal\nTrade Commission Act (FTC Act), 38 Stat. 717, 15 U. S. C.\n§41 et seq. Under the FTC Act, a debt collector may face\ncivil penalties of up to $16,000 per day for acting with\n“actual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis\nof objective circumstances that [an] act is” prohibited\nunder the FDCPA. §§45(m)(1)(A), (C); 74 Fed. Reg. 858\n(2009) (amending 16 CFR §1.98(d) (2009)). The Court\nreasons that the FTC provision is meant to provide rela\ntively harsh penalties for intentional violations. By con\ntrast, the argument continues, the penalties in the FDCPA\nitself must cover—and hence §1692k(c) must not excuse—\nunintentional violations. Ante, at 8–9.\n   The argument rests on a mistaken premise—namely,\nthat §1692k(c) must immunize all legal errors or none.\nThis misreads the statute. As the text states, it applies\nonly to “bona fide” errors committed despite “the mainte\nnance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid” these\nmistakes. So under a sensible reading of the statute,\n(1) intentional violations are punishable under the height\nened penalties of the FTC Act; (2) unintentional violations\nare generally subject to punishment under the FDCPA;\nand (3) a defendant may escape liability altogether by\nproving that a violation was based on a bona fide error\nand that reasonable error-prevention procedures were in\n18          JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                 KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\nplace. There is nothing incongruous in this scheme.\nIndeed, for the reasons described in Part I, supra, it is far\nless peculiar than the Court’s reading, which would sub\nject attorneys to liability for good-faith legal advocacy,\neven advocacy based on an accurate assessment of then\nexisting case law.\n    Third, in construing §1692k(c) to exclude legal errors,\nthe Court points to the requirement that a debt collector\nmaintain “procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any\nsuch error.” The Court asserts that this phrase most\nnaturally evokes procedures to avoid clerical or factual\nmistakes. There is nothing natural in reading this phrase\ncontrary to its plain terms, which do not distinguish be\ntween different categories of mistakes. Nor is there any\nthing unusual about procedures adopted to avoid legal\nmistakes. The present case is again instructive. Accord\ning to the District Court, respondents designated a lead\nFDCPA compliance attorney, who regularly attended\nconferences and seminars; subscribed to relevant periodi\ncals; distributed leading FDCPA cases to all attorneys;\ntrained new attorneys on their statutory obligations; and\nheld regular firm-wide meetings on FDCPA issues. See\n538 F. 3d 469, 477 (CA6 2008). These procedures are not\nonly “reasonably adapted to avoid [legal] error[s],” but also\naccord with the FDCPA’s purposes.\n    The Court argues, nonetheless, that the statute contem\nplates only clerical or factual errors, for these are the type\nof errors that can mostly naturally be addressed through\n“ ‘a series of steps followed in a regular orderly definite\nway.’ ” Ante, at 12 (quoting Webster’s Third New Interna\ntional Dictionary 1807 (1976)). As made clear by the steps\nthat respondents have taken to ensure FDCPA compli\nance, this is simply not true. The Court also speculates\nthat procedures to avoid clerical or factual errors will be\neasier to implement than procedures to avoid legal errors.\nEven if this were not pure conjecture, it has nothing to do\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nwith what the statute requires. The statute does not talk\nabout procedures that eliminate all—or even most—\nerrors. It merely requires procedures “reasonably adapted\nto avoid any such error.” The statute adopts the sensible\napproach of requiring reasonable safeguards if liability is\nto be avoided. This approach, not the Court’s interpreta\ntion, reflects the reality of debt-collection practices.\n   Fourth, the Court argues that construing §1692k(c) to\nencompass a mistake-of-law defense “is at odds with” the\nrole contemplated for the FTC. Ante, at 13. This is so, it\ncontends, because the FTC is authorized to issue advisory\nopinions, and the statute shields from liability “any act\ndone or omitted in good faith in conformity” with such\nopinions. §1692k(e). But why, asks the Court, would a\ndebt collector seek an opinion from the FTC if immunity\nunder §1692k(c) could be obtained simply by relying in\ngood faith on advice from private counsel? Going further,\nthe Court suggests that debt collectors might “have an\naffirmative incentive not to seek an advisory opinion to\nresolve ambiguity in the law, which would then prevent\nthem from claiming good-faith immunity for violations.”\nAnte, at 13.\n   There is little substance to this line of reasoning. As the\nCourt itself acknowledges, debt collectors would have an\nincentive to invoke the FTC safe harbor even if §1692k(c)\nis construed to include a mistake-of-law defense, because\nthe safe harbor provides a “more categorical immunity.”\nAnte, at 13, n. 8. Additionally, if a debt collector avoids\nseeking an advisory opinion from the FTC out of concern\nthat the answer will be unfavorable, that seems quite at\nodds with saying that his or her ignorance is “bona fide.”\n   It should be noted further that the Court’s concern\nabout encouraging ignorance could apply just as well to\n§45(m)(1)(A). That provision subjects a debt collector to\nharsh penalties for violating an FTC rule “with actual\nknowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of\n20         JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                  KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\nobjective circumstances that such act is unfair or deceptive\nand is prohibited by such rule.” No one contends that this\nwill encourage debt collectors to avoid learning the FTC’s\nrules. Yet there is no doubt that §45(m)(1)(A) permits a\nmistake-of-law defense.\n  All this assumes, of course, that obtaining an FTC advi\nsory opinion will be a reasonably practical possibility. For\nthe reasons stated above, see Part I–B–2, supra, this is to\nbe doubted. Even the Court recognizes the limited role\nthat the FTC has played. Ante, at 25 (“[E]vidence of pre\nsent administrative practice makes us reluctant to place\nsignificant weight on §1692k(e) as a practical remedy”).\n  Fifth, the Court asserts that “[a]ny remaining doubt”\nabout its preferred interpretation is dispelled by the\nFDCPA’s statutory history. The Court points to the fact\nthat §1692k(c) mirrors a bona fide error defense provision\nin the earlier enacted Truth in Lending Act (TILA), argu\ning that Congress sought to incorporate into the FDCPA\nthe view of the Courts of Appeals that the TILA defense\napplied only to clerical errors. Ante, at 14–15. As JUSTICE\nSCALIA points out, the Court’s claims of judicial uniformity\nare overstated. See ante, at 2–3 (opinion concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment). They rest on three\nCourt of Appeals decisions, which are contradicted by\nseveral District Court opinions and a State Supreme Court\nopinion—hardly a consistent legal backdrop against which\nto divine legislative intent. The Court also ignores the fact\nthat those three Courts of Appeals had construed the\nTILA provision to apply only to clerical errors. See Ives v.\nW. T. Grant Co., 522 F. 2d 749, 758 (CA2 1975); Haynes v.\nLogan Furniture Mart, Inc., 503 F. 2d 1161, 1167 (CA7\n1974); Palmer v. Wilson, 502 F. 2d 860, 861 (CA9 1974).\nThe Court therefore cannot explain why it reads §1692k(c)\nmore broadly to encompass factual mistakes as well.\n  It is of even greater significance that in 1980 Congress\namended the TILA’s bona fide error exception explicitly to\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          21\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nexclude “an error of legal judgment with respect to a per\nson’s obligations under [the TILA].” See Truth in Lending\nSimplification and Reform Act, §615 (c), 94 Stat. 181. This\namendment would have been unnecessary if Congress had\nunderstood the pre-1980 language to exclude legal errors.\nThe natural inference is that the pre-amendment TILA\nlanguage—the same language later incorporated nearly\nverbatim into §1692k(c)—was understood to cover those\nerrors.\n   The Court’s responses to this point are perplexing. The\nCourt first says that the 1980 amendment did not “obvi\nous[ly]” change the scope of the TILA’s bona fide error\ndefense, given the “uniform interpretation” that the de\nfense had been given in the Courts of Appeals. Ante, at\n17. The Court thus prefers to make an entire statutory\namendment surplusage rather than abandon its dubious\nassumption that Congress meant to ratify a nascent Court\nof Appeals consensus. Cf. Corley v. United States, 556\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 9) (“[O]ne of the most\nbasic interpretive canons [is] that [a] statute should be\nconstrued so that effect is given to all its provisions, so\nthat no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or\ninsignificant” (internal quotation marks omitted; second\nalteration in original)). (Without any evidence, the Court\nspeculates that perhaps the amendment was intended to\ncodify existing judicial interpretations that excluded legal\nerrors. Ante, at 17–18. If those judicial interpretation\nwere truly as uniform as the Court suggests—and\n the presumption against mistake-of-law defenses as\nironclad—there would have been no need for such a\nrecodification.)\n   The Court is hesitant as well to give the 1980 amend\nment weight because Congress “has not expressly included\nmistakes of law in any of the numerous bona fide error\ndefenses, worded in pertinent part identically to §1692k(c),\nelsewhere in the U. S. Code.” Ante, at 18 (emphasis in\n22         JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, \n\n                KRAMER & ULRICH LPA \n\n                  KENNEDY, J., dissenting \n\n\noriginal). In other words, the Court refuses to read\n§1692k(c) to cover mistakes of law because other bona fide\nerror statutes do not expressly refer to such mistakes. But\nthe reverse should be true: If other bona fide error provi\nsions included mistake-of-law language but §1692k(c) did\nnot, we might think that the omission in §1692k(c) sig\nnaled Congress’s intent to exclude mistakes of law. The\nabsence of mistake-of-law language in §1692k(c) is conse\nquently less noteworthy because other statutes also omit\nsuch language.\n  The Court emphasizes that some bona fide error de\nfenses, like the one in the current version of the TILA,\nexpressly exclude legal errors from their scope. Ante, at\n18 (citing 12 U. S. C. §4010(c)(2)). Yet this also can prove\nthe opposite of what the Court says it does: If a bona fide\nerror defense were generally assumed not to include legal\nmistakes (as the Court argues), there would be no need to\nexpressly exclude them. It is only if the defense would\notherwise include such errors that exclusionary language\nbecomes necessary. By writing explicit exclusionary lan\nguage into the TILA (and some other federal provisions),\nCongress has indicated that those provisions would other\nwise cover good-faith legal errors.\n                       *     *    *\n   For these reasons, §1692k(c) is best read to encompass\nmistakes of law. I would affirm the judgment of the Court\nof Appeals.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2357/", "sha1": "f84e4ea9b8c179de56366f53bd9b0cf5c7359127", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2009-044", "time_retrieved": "2010-04-22T10:53:42"}
