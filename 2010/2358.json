KENNY\n        A., BY HIS NEXT FRIEND WINN, ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 08–970.      Argued October 14, 2009—Decided April 21, 2010\nTitle 42 U. S. C. §1988 authorizes courts to award a “reasonable” attor\n  ney’s fee for prevailing parties in civil rights actions. Half of respon\n  dents’ $14 million fee request was based on their calculation of the\n  “lodestar,” i.e., the number of hours the attorneys and their employ\n  ees worked multiplied by the hourly rates prevailing in the commu\n  nity. The other half represented a fee enhancement for superior work\n  and results, supported by affidavits claiming that the lodestar would\n  be insufficient to induce lawyers of comparable skill and experience\n  to litigate this case. Awarding fees of about $10.5 million, the Dis\n  trict Court found that the proposed hourly rates were “fair and rea\n  sonable,” but that some of the entries on counsel’s billing records\n  were vague and that the hours claimed for many categories were ex\n  cessive. The court therefore cut the lodestar to approximately $6 mil\n  lion, but enhanced that award by 75%, or an additional $4.5 million.\n  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed in reliance on its precedent.\nHeld:\n    1. The calculation of an attorney’s fee based on the lodestar may be\n increased due to superior performance, but only in extraordinary cir\n cumstances. Pp. 5–12.\n       (a) The lodestar approach has “achieved dominance in the federal\n courts.” Gisbrecht v. Barnhart, 535 U. S. 789, 801. Although imper\n fect, it has several important virtues: It produces an award that ap\n proximates the fee the prevailing attorney would have received for\n representing a paying client who was billed by the hour in a compa\n rable case; and it is readily administrable, see, e.g., Burlington v. Da\n gue, 505 U. S. 557, 566, and “objective,” Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461\n U. S. 424, 433, thereby cabining trial judges’ discretion, permitting\n2                         PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    meaningful judicial review, and producing reasonably predictable re\n    sults. Pp. 5–7.\n         (b) This Court has established six important rules that lead to\n    today’s decision. First, a “reasonable” fee is one that is sufficient to\n    induce a capable attorney to undertake the representation of a meri\n    torious civil rights case, see Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citi\n    zens’ Council for Clean Air, 478 U. S. 546, 565, but that does not pro\n    vide “a form of economic relief to improve the financial lot of\n    attorneys,” ibid. Second, there is a “strong” presumption that the\n    lodestar method yields a sufficient fee. See, e.g., id., at 564. Third,\n    the Court has never sustained an enhancement of a lodestar amount\n    for performance, but has repeatedly said that an enhancement may\n    be awarded in “rare” and “exceptional” circumstances. E.g., id., at\n    565. Fourth, “the lodestar includes most, if not all, of the relevant\n    factors constituting a ‘reasonable’ attorney’s fee.” Id., at 566. An en\n    hancement may not be based on a factor that is subsumed in the\n    lodestar calculation, such as the case’s novelty and complexity, see,\n    e.g., Blum v. Stenson, 465 U. S. 886, 898, or the quality of an attor\n    ney’s performance, Delaware Valley, supra, at 566. Fifth, the burden\n    of proving that an enhancement is necessary must be borne by the fee\n    applicant. E.g., Blum, 465 U. S., at 901. Sixth, an applicant seeking\n    an enhancement must produce “specific evidence” supporting the\n    award, id., at 899, 901, to assure that the calculation is objective and\n    capable of being reviewed on appeal. Pp. 7–9.\n         (c) The Court rejects any contention that a fee determined by the\n    lodestar method may not be enhanced in any situation. The “strong\n    presumption” that the lodestar is reasonable may be overcome in\n    those rare circumstances in which the lodestar does not adequately\n    account for a factor that may properly be considered in determining a\n    reasonable fee. P. 9.\n         (d) The Court treats the quality of an attorney’s performance and\n    the results obtained as one factor, since superior results are relevant\n    only to the extent it can be shown that they stem from superior at\n    torney performance and not another factor, such as inferior perform\n    ance by opposing counsel. The circumstances in which superior at\n    torney performance is not adequately taken into account in the\n    lodestar calculation are “rare” and “exceptional.” Enhancements\n    should not be awarded without specific evidence that the lodestar fee\n    would not have been “adequate to attract competent counsel.” Blum,\n    supra, at 897. First, an enhancement may be appropriate where the\n    method used to determine the hourly rate does not adequately meas\n    ure the attorney’s true market value, as demonstrated in part during\n    the litigation. This may occur if the hourly rate formula takes into\n    account only a single factor (such as years since admission to the bar)\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  or perhaps only a few similar factors. In such a case, the trial judge\n  should adjust the hourly rate in accordance with specific proof linking\n  the attorney’s ability to a prevailing market rate. Second, an en\n  hancement may be appropriate if the attorney’s performance includes\n  an extraordinary outlay of expenses and the litigation is exception\n  ally protracted. In such cases, the enhancement amount must be cal\n  culated using a method that is reasonable, objective, and capable of\n  being reviewed on appeal, such as by applying a standard interest\n  rate to the qualifying expense outlays. Third, an enhancement may\n  be appropriate where an attorney’s performance involves exceptional\n  delay in the payment of fees. In such a case, the enhancement should\n  be calculated by a method similar to that used for an exceptional de\n  lay in expense reimbursement. Enhancements are not appropriate\n  on the ground that departures from hourly billing are becoming more\n  common. Nor can they be based on a flawed analogy to the increas\n  ingly popular practice of paying attorneys a reduced hourly rate with\n  a bonus for obtaining specified results. Pp. 9–12.\n     2. The District Court did not provide proper justification for the\n  75% fee enhancement it awarded in this case. It commented that the\n  enhancement was necessary to compensate counsel at the appropri\n  ate hourly rate, but the effect was to raise the top rate from $495 to\n  more than $866 per hour, while nothing in the record shows that this\n  is an appropriate figure for the relevant market. The court also em\n  phasized that counsel had to make extraordinary outlays for ex\n  penses and wait for reimbursement, but did not calculate the amount\n  of the enhancement attributable to this factor. Similarly, the court\n  noted that counsel did not receive fees on an ongoing basis during the\n  case, but did not sufficiently link this to proof that the delay was out\n  side the normal range expected by attorneys who rely on §1988 for\n  fees. Nor did the court calculate the cost to counsel of any extraordi\n  nary and unwarranted delay. And its reliance on the contingency of\n  the outcome contravenes Dague, supra, at 565. Finally, insofar as\n  the court relied on a comparison of counsel’s performance in this case\n  with that of counsel in unnamed prior cases, it did not employ a\n  methodology that permitted meaningful appellate review. While de\n  termining a “reasonable attorney’s fee” is within the trial judge’s\n  sound discretion under §1988, that discretion is not unlimited. The\n  judge must provide a reasonably specific explanation for all aspects of\n  a fee determination, including any enhancement.

KENNY A., BY HIS NEXT FRIEND\n\n              LINDA WINN, ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                  [April 21, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case presents the question whether the calculation\nof an attorney’s fee, under federal fee-shifting statutes,\nbased on the “lodestar,” i.e., the number of hours worked\nmultiplied by the prevailing hourly rates, may be in\ncreased due to superior performance and results.1 We\nhave stated in previous cases that such an increase is\npermitted in extraordinary circumstances, and we reaf\nfirm that rule. But as we have also said in prior cases,\nthere is a strong presumption that the lodestar is suffi\ncient; factors subsumed in the lodestar calculation cannot\nbe used as a ground for increasing an award above the\nlodestar; and a party seeking fees has the burden of identi\nfying a factor that the lodestar does not adequately take\n——————\n  1 JUSTICE BREYER would have us answer this question “Yes” and then\n\nend the opinion. See post, at 2 (opinion concurring in part and dissent\ning in part). Such an opinion would be of little use to the bench or bar\nand would pointlessly invite an additional round of litigation. The\nissue of the standards to be applied in granting an enhancement is\nfairly subsumed within the question that we agreed to decide and has\nbeen extensively discussed in the briefs filed in this case.\n2                        PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ninto account and proving with specificity that an enhanced\nfee is justified. Because the District Court did not apply\nthese standards, we reverse the decision below and re\nmand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   Respondents (plaintiffs below) are children in the Geor\ngia foster-care system and their next friends. They filed\nthis class action on behalf of 3,000 children in foster care\nand named as defendants the Governor of Georgia and\nvarious state officials (petitioners in this case). Claiming\nthat deficiencies in the foster-care system in two counties\nnear Atlanta violated their federal and state constitutional\nand statutory rights, respondents sought injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief, as well as attorney’s fees and expenses.\n   The United States District Court for the Northern Dis\ntrict of Georgia eventually referred the case to mediation,\nwhere the parties entered into a consent decree, which the\nDistrict Court approved. The consent decree resolved all\npending issues other than the fees that respondents’ at\ntorneys were entitled to receive under 42 U. S. C. §1988.2\n                              B\n  Respondents submitted a request for more than $14\nmillion in attorney’s fees. Half of that amount was based\non their calculation of the lodestar—roughly 30,000 hours\nmultiplied by hourly rates of $200 to $495 for attorneys\nand $75 to $150 for non-attorneys. In support of their fee\n——————\n    2 Title\n         42 U. S.

Affidavits submitted in support of this request\nclaimed that the lodestar amount “would be generally\ninsufficient to induce lawyers of comparable skill, judg\nment, professional representation and experience” to\nlitigate this case. See, e.g., App. 80. Petitioners objected\nto the fee request, contending that some of the proposed\nhourly rates were too high, that the hours claimed were\nexcessive, and that the enhancement would duplicate\nfactors that were reflected in the lodestar amount.\n   The District Court awarded fees of approximately\n$10.5 million. See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2317188\"><a href=\"/opinion/2317188/kenny-a-ex-rel-winn-v-perdue/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1260</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1296 (ND Ga.\n2006). The District Court found that the hourly rates\nproposed by respondents were “fair and reasonable,” id., at\n1285, but that some of the entries on counsel’s billing\nrecords were vague and that the hours claimed for many of\nthe billing categories were excessive. The court therefore\ncut the non-travel hours by 15% and halved the hourly\nrate for travel hours. This resulted in a lodestar calcula\ntion of approximately $6 million.\n   The court then enhanced this award by 75%, concluding\nthat the lodestar calculation did not take into account “(1)\nthe fact that class counsel were required to advance case\nexpenses of $1.7 million over a three-year period with no\non[-]going reimbursement, (2) the fact that class counsel\nwere not paid on an on-going basis as the work was being\nperformed, and (3) the fact that class counsel’s ability to\nrecover a fee and expense reimbursement were completely\ncontingent on the outcome of the case.” Id., at 1288. The\ncourt stated that respondents’ attorneys had exhibited “a\nhigher degree of skill, commitment, dedication, and pro\nfessionalism . . . than the Court has seen displayed by the\n4                   PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nattorneys in any other case during its 27 years on the\nbench.” Id., at 1289. The court also commented that the\nresults obtained were “ ‘extraordinary’ ” and added that\n“[a]fter 58 years as a practicing attorney and federal\njudge, the Court is unaware of any other case in which a\nplaintiff class has achieved such a favorable result on such\na comprehensive scale.” Id., at 1290. The enhancement\nresulted in an additional $4.5 million fee award.\n   Relying on prior Circuit precedent, a panel of the Elev\nenth Circuit affirmed. 532 F. 3d 1209 (2008). The panel\nheld that the District Court had not abused its discretion\nby failing to make a larger reduction in the number of\nhours for which respondents’ attorneys sought reim\nbursement, but the panel commented that it “would have\ncut the billable hours more if we were deciding the matter\nin the first instance” and added that the hourly rates\napproved by the District Court also “appear[ed] to be on\nthe generous side.” Id., at 1220, and n. 2. On the question\nof the enhancement, however, the panel splintered, with\neach judge writing a separate opinion.\n   Judge Carnes concluded that binding Eleventh Circuit\nprecedent required that the decision of the District Court\nbe affirmed, but he opined that the reasoning in our opin\nions suggested that no enhancement should be allowed in\nthis case. He concluded that the quality of the attorneys’\nperformance was “adequately accounted for ‘either in\ndetermining the reasonable number of hours expended on\nthe litigation or in setting the reasonable hourly rates.’ ”\nId., at 1225 (quoting Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley\nCitizens’ Council for Clean Air, 478 U. S. 546, 565–566\n(1986) (Delaware Valley I)). He found that an enhance\nment could not be justified based on delay in the recovery\nof attorney’s fees and reimbursable expenses because such\ndelay is a routine feature of cases brought under 42\nU. S. C. §1983. And he reasoned that the District Court\nhad contravened our holding in Burlington v. Dague, 505\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

S. 557 (1992), when it relied on “ ‘the fact that class\ncounsel’s compensation was totally contingent upon pre\nvailing in this action.’ ” 532 F. 3d, at 1226, 1228 (quoting\naffidavit in support of fee request).\n   Judge Wilson concurred in the judgment but disagreed\nwith Judge Carnes’ view that Eleventh Circuit precedent\nis inconsistent with our decisions. Judge Hill also con\ncurred in the judgment but expressed no view about the\ncorrectness of the prior Circuit precedent.\n   The Eleventh Circuit denied rehearing en banc over the\ndissent of three judges. See 547 F. 3d 1319 (2008). Judge\nWilson filed an opinion concurring in the denial of rehear\ning; Judge Carnes, joined by Judges Tjoflat and Dubina,\nfiled an opinion dissenting from the denial of rehearing;\nand Judge Tjoflat filed a separate dissent, contending,\namong other things, that the District Court, by basing the\nenhancement in large part on a comparison of the per\nformance of respondents’ attorneys with all of the un\nnamed attorneys whose work he had observed during his\nprofessional career, had improperly rendered a decision\nthat was effectively unreviewable on appeal and had\nessentially served as a witness in support of the enhance\nment. Id., at 1326–1327.\n   We granted certiorari. 556 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                            II\n  The general rule in our legal system is that each party\nmust pay its own attorney’s fees and expenses, see Hensley\nv. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 429 (1983), but Congress\nenacted 42 U. S. C. §1988 in order to ensure that federal\nrights are adequately enforced. Section 1988 provides that\na prevailing party in certain civil rights actions may re\ncover “a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs.”3\n\n——————\n  3 Virtually identical language appears in many of the federal fee\n\nshifting statutes. See Burlington v. Dague, 505 U. S. 557, 562 (1992).\n6                       PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nUnfortunately, the statute does not explain what Congress\nmeant by a “reasonable” fee, and therefore the task of\nidentifying an appropriate methodology for determining a\n“reasonable” fee was left for the courts.\n   One possible method was set out in Johnson v. Georgia\nHighway Express, Inc., 488 F. 2d 714, 717–719 (CA5\n1974), which listed 12 factors that a court should consider\nin determining a reasonable fee.4 This method, however,\n“gave very little actual guidance to district courts. Setting\nattorney’s fees by reference to a series of sometimes sub\njective factors placed unlimited discretion in trial judges\nand produced disparate results.” Delaware Valley I,\nsupra, at 563.\n   An alternative, the lodestar approach, was pioneered by\nthe Third Circuit in Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. of Philadel\nphia v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corp.,\n487 F. 2d 161 (1973), appeal after remand, 540 F. 2d 102\n(1976), and “achieved dominance in the federal courts”\nafter our decision in Hensley. Gisbrecht v. Barnhart, 535\nU. S. 789, 801 (2002). “Since that time, ‘[t]he “lodestar”\nfigure has, as its name suggests, become the guiding light\nof our fee-shifting jurisprudence.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Dague,\nsupra, at 562).\n   Although the lodestar method is not perfect, it has\nseveral important virtues. First, in accordance with our\nunderstanding of the aim of fee-shifting statutes, the\nlodestar looks to “the prevailing market rates in the rele\n——————\n   4 These factors were: “(1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty\n\nand difficulty of the questions; (3) the skill requisite to perform the\nlegal service properly; (4) the preclusion of employment by the attorney\ndue to the acceptance of the case; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the\nfee is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations imposed by the client or\nthe circumstances; (8) the amount involved and the results obtained; (9)\nthe experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) the ‘unde\nsirability’ of the case; (11) the nature and length of the professional\nrelationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases.” Hensley\nv. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 430, n. 3 (1983).\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvant community.” Blum v. Stenson, 465 U. S. 886, 895\n(1984). Developed after the practice of hourly billing had\nbecome widespread, see Gisbrecht, supra, at 801, the\nlodestar method produces an award that roughly approxi\nmates the fee that the prevailing attorney would have\nreceived if he or she had been representing a paying client\nwho was billed by the hour in a comparable case. Second,\nthe lodestar method is readily administrable, see Dague,\n505 U. S., at 566; see also Buckhannon Board & Care\nHome, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human\nResources, 532 U. S. 598, 609 (2001); and unlike the John\nson approach, the lodestar calculation is “objective,”\nHensley, supra, at 433, and thus cabins the discretion of\ntrial judges, permits meaningful judicial review, and\nproduces reasonably predictable results.\n                             III\n   Our prior decisions concerning the federal fee-shifting\nstatutes have established six important rules that lead to\nour decision in this case.\n   First, a “reasonable” fee is a fee that is sufficient to\ninduce a capable attorney to undertake the representation\nof a meritorious civil rights case. See Delaware Valley I,\n478 U. S., at 565 (“[I]f plaintiffs . . . find it possible to\nengage a lawyer based on the statutory assurance that he\nwill be paid a ‘reasonable fee,’ the purpose behind the fee\nshifting statute has been satisfied”); Blum, supra, at 897\n(“[A] reasonable attorney’s fee is one that is adequate to\nattract competent counsel, but that does not produce\nwindfalls to attorneys” (ellipsis, brackets, and internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Section 1988’s aim is to en\nforce the covered civil rights statutes, not to provide “a\nform of economic relief to improve the financial lot of\nattorneys.” Delaware Valley I, supra, at 565.\n   Second, the lodestar method yields a fee that is pre\nsumptively sufficient to achieve this objective. See Dague,\n8                   PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsupra, at 562; Delaware Valley I, supra, at 565; Blum,\nsupra, at 897; see also Gisbrecht, supra, at 801–802.\nIndeed, we have said that the presumption is a “strong”\none. Dague, supra, at 562; Delaware Valley I, supra, at\n565.\n   Third, although we have never sustained an enhance\nment of a lodestar amount for performance, see Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 12, 17, we have repeat\nedly said that enhancements may be awarded in “ ‘rare’ ”\nand “ ‘exceptional’ ” circumstances. Delaware Valley I,\nsupra, at 565; Blum, supra, at 897; Hensley, 461 U. S., at\n435.\n   Fourth, we have noted that “the lodestar figure includes\nmost, if not all, of the relevant factors constituting a ‘rea\nsonable’ attorney’s fee,” Delaware Valley I, supra, at 566,\nand have held that an enhancement may not be awarded\nbased on a factor that is subsumed in the lodestar calcula\ntion, see Dague, supra, at 562–563; Pennsylvania v. Dela\nware Valley Citizens’ Council for Clean Air, 483 U. S. 711,\n726–727 (1987) (Delaware Valley II) (plurality opinion);\nBlum, 465 U. S., at 898. We have thus held that the nov\nelty and complexity of a case generally may not be used as\na ground for an enhancement because these factors “pre\nsumably [are] fully reflected in the number of billable\nhours recorded by counsel.” Ibid. We have also held that\nthe quality of an attorney’s performance generally should\nnot be used to adjust the lodestar “[b]ecause considera\ntions concerning the quality of a prevailing party’s coun\nsel’s representation normally are reflected in the reason\nable hourly rate.” Delaware Valley I, supra, at 566.\n   Fifth, the burden of proving that an enhancement is\nnecessary must be borne by the fee applicant. Dague,\nsupra, at 561; Blum, 465 U. S., at 901–902.\n   Finally, a fee applicant seeking an enhancement must\nproduce “specific evidence” that supports the award. Id.,\nat 899, 901 (An enhancement must be based on “evidence\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat enhancement was necessary to provide fair and rea\nsonable compensation”). This requirement is essential if\nthe lodestar method is to realize one of its chief virtues,\ni.e., providing a calculation that is objective and capable of\nbeing reviewed on appeal.\n                             IV \n\n                              A\n\n   In light of what we have said in prior cases, we reject\nany contention that a fee determined by the lodestar\nmethod may not be enhanced in any situation. The lode\nstar method was never intended to be conclusive in all\ncircumstances. Instead, there is a “strong presumption”\nthat the lodestar figure is reasonable, but that presump\ntion may be overcome in those rare circumstances in\nwhich the lodestar does not adequately take into account a\nfactor that may properly be considered in determining a\nreasonable fee.\n                             B\n   In this case, we are asked to decide whether either the\nquality of an attorney’s performance or the results ob\ntained are factors that may properly provide a basis for an\nenhancement. We treat these two factors as one. When a\nplaintiff’s attorney achieves results that are more favor\nable than would have been predicted based on the govern\ning law and the available evidence, the outcome may be\nattributable to superior performance and commitment of\nresources by plaintiff’s counsel. Or the outcome may\nresult from inferior performance by defense counsel, unan\nticipated defense concessions, unexpectedly favorable\nrulings by the court, an unexpectedly sympathetic jury, or\nsimple luck. Since none of these latter causes can justify\nan enhanced award, superior results are relevant only to\nthe extent it can be shown that they are the result of\nsuperior attorney performance. Thus, we need only con\n10                       PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsider whether superior attorney performance can justify\nan enhancement. And in light of the principles derived\nfrom our prior cases, we inquire whether there are circum\nstances in which superior attorney performance is not\nadequately taken into account in the lodestar calculation.\nWe conclude that there are a few such circumstances but\nthat these circumstances are indeed “rare” and “excep\ntional,” and require specific evidence that the lodestar\nfee would not have been “adequate to attract competent\ncounsel,” Blum, supra, at 897 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   First, an enhancement may be appropriate where the\nmethod used in determining the hourly rate employed in\nthe lodestar calculation does not adequately measure the\nattorney’s true market value, as demonstrated in part\nduring the litigation.5 This may occur if the hourly rate is\ndetermined by a formula that takes into account only a\nsingle factor (such as years since admission to the bar)6 or\nperhaps only a few similar factors. In such a case, an\nenhancement may be appropriate so that an attorney is\ncompensated at the rate that the attorney would receive in\ncases not governed by the federal fee-shifting statutes.\nBut in order to provide a calculation that is objective and\nreviewable, the trial judge should adjust the attorney’s\nhourly rate in accordance with specific proof linking the\nattorney’s ability to a prevailing market rate.\n   Second, an enhancement may be appropriate if the\n\n——————\n   5 Respondents correctly note that an attorney’s “brilliant insights and\n\ncritical maneuvers sometimes matter far more than hours worked or\nyears of experience.” Brief for Respondents 14. But as we said in Blum\nv. Stenson, 465 U. S. 886, 898 (1984), “[i]n those cases, the special skill\nand experience of counsel should be reflected in the reasonableness of\nthe hourly rates.”\n   6 See, e.g., Salazar v.

S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nattorney’s performance includes an extraordinary outlay of\nexpenses and the litigation is exceptionally protracted. As\nJudge Carnes noted below, when an attorney agrees to\nrepresent a civil rights plaintiff who cannot afford to pay\nthe attorney, the attorney presumably understands that\nno reimbursement is likely to be received until the suc\ncessful resolution of the case, 532 F. 3d, at 1227, and\ntherefore enhancements to compensate for delay in reim\nbursement for expenses must be reserved for unusual\ncases. In such exceptional cases, however, an enhance\nment may be allowed, but the amount of the enhancement\nmust be calculated using a method that is reasonable,\nobjective, and capable of being reviewed on appeal, such as\nby applying a standard rate of interest to the qualifying\noutlays of expenses.\n  Third, there may be extraordinary circumstances in\nwhich an attorney’s performance involves exceptional\ndelay in the payment of fees. An attorney who expects to\nbe compensated under §1988 presumably understands\nthat payment of fees will generally not come until the end\nof the case, if at all. See 532 F. 3d, at 1227 (opinion of\nCarnes, J.). Compensation for this delay is generally\nmade “either by basing the award on current rates or by\nadjusting the fee based on historical rates to reflect its\npresent value.” Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 U. S. 274, 282\n(1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). But we do not\nrule out the possibility that an enhancement may be ap\npropriate where an attorney assumes these costs in the\nface of unanticipated delay, particularly where the delay is\nunjustifiably caused by the defense. In such a case, how\never, the enhancement should be calculated by applying a\nmethod similar to that described above in connection with\nexceptional delay in obtaining reimbursement for\nexpenses.\n  We reject the suggestion that it is appropriate to grant\nperformance enhancements on the ground that departures\n12                  PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom hourly billing are becoming more common. As we\nhave noted, the lodestar was adopted in part because it\nprovides a rough approximation of general billing prac\ntices, and accordingly, if hourly billing becomes unusual,\nan alternative to the lodestar method may have to be\nfound. However, neither respondents nor their amici\ncontend that that day has arrived. Nor have they shown\nthat permitting the award of enhancements on top of the\nlodestar figure corresponds to prevailing practice in the\ngeneral run of cases.\n   We are told that, under an increasingly popular ar\nrangement, attorneys are paid at a reduced hourly rate\nbut receive a bonus if certain specified results are ob\ntained, and this practice is analogized to the award of an\nenhancement such as the one in this case. Brief for Re\nspondents 55–57. The analogy, however, is flawed. An\nattorney who agrees, at the outset of the representation, to\na reduced hourly rate in exchange for the opportunity to\nearn a performance bonus is in a position far different\nfrom an attorney in a §1988 case who is compensated at\nthe full prevailing rate and then seeks a performance\nenhancement in addition to the lodestar amount after the\nlitigation has concluded. Reliance on these comparisons\nfor the purposes of administering enhancements, there\nfore, is not appropriate.\n                             V\n  In the present case, the District Court did not provide\nproper justification for the large enhancement that it\nawarded. The court increased the lodestar award by 75%\nbut, as far as the court’s opinion reveals, this figure ap\npears to have been essentially arbitrary. Why, for exam\nple, did the court grant a 75% enhancement instead of the\n100% increase that respondents sought? And why 75%\nrather than 50% or 25% or 10%?\n  The District Court commented that the enhancement\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwas the “minimum enhancement of the lodestar necessary\nto reasonably compensate [respondents’] counsel.” 454\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1290. But the effect of the enhancement\nwas to increase the top rate for the attorneys to more than\n$866 per hour,7 and the District Court did not point to\nanything in the record that shows that this is an appro\npriate figure for the relevant market.\n   The District Court pointed to the fact that respondents’\ncounsel had to make extraordinary outlays for expenses\nand had to wait for reimbursement, id., at 1288, but the\ncourt did not calculate the amount of the enhancement\nthat is attributable to this factor. Similarly, the District\nCourt noted that respondents’ counsel did not receive fees\non an ongoing basis while the case was pending, but the\ncourt did not sufficiently link this factor to proof in the\nrecord that the delay here was outside the normal range\nexpected by attorneys who rely on §1988 for the payment\nof their fees or quantify the disparity. Nor did the court\nprovide a calculation of the cost to counsel of any extraor\ndinary and unwarranted delay. And the court’s reliance\non the contingency of the outcome contravenes our holding\nin Dague. See 505 U. S., at 565.\n   Finally, insofar as the District Court relied on a com\nparison of the performance of counsel in this case with the\nperformance of counsel in unnamed prior cases, the Dis\ntrict Court did not employ a methodology that permitted\n——————\n  7 JUSTICE BREYER’s reliance on the average hourly rate for all of re\nspondents’ attorneys is highly misleading. See post, at 10. In calculat\ning the lodestar, the District Court found that the hourly rate for each\nof these attorneys was “eminently fair and reasonable” and “consistent\nwith the prevailing market rates in Atlanta for comparable work.” 454\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1285–1286. JUSTICE BREYER’s calculation of an average\nhourly rate for all attorney hours reflects nothing more than the fact\nthat much of the work was performed by attorneys whose “fair and\nreasonable” market rate was below the market average. There is\nnothing unfair about compensating these attorneys at the very rate that\nthey requested.\n14                    PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nmeaningful appellate review. Needless to say, we do not\nquestion the sincerity of the District Court’s observations,\nand we are in no position to assess their accuracy. But\nwhen a trial judge awards an enhancement on an impres\nsionistic basis, a major purpose of the lodestar method—\nproviding an objective and reviewable basis for fees, see\nid., at 566—is undermined.\n    Determining a “reasonable attorney’s fee” is a matter\nthat is committed to the sound discretion of a trial judge,\nsee 42 U. S. C. §1988 (permitting court, “in its discretion,”\nto award fees), but the judge’s discretion is not unlimited.\nIt is essential that the judge provide a reasonably specific\nexplanation for all aspects of a fee determination, includ\ning any award of an enhancement. Unless such an expla\nnation is given, adequate appellate review is not feasible,\nand without such review, widely disparate awards may be\nmade, and awards may be influenced (or at least, may\nappear to be influenced) by a judge’s subjective opinion\nregarding particular attorneys or the importance of the\ncase. In addition, in future cases, defendants contemplat\ning the possibility of settlement will have no way to esti\nmate the likelihood of having to pay a potentially huge\nenhancement. See Marek v. Chesny, 473 U. S. 1, 7 (1985)\n(“ ‘[M]any a defendant would be unwilling to make a bind\ning settlement offer on terms that left it exposed to liabil\nity for attorney’s fees in whatever amount the court might\nfix on motion of the plaintiff ’ ”).\n    Section 1988 serves an important public purpose by\nmaking it possible for persons without means to bring suit\nto vindicate their rights. But unjustified enhancements\nthat serve only to enrich attorneys are not consistent with\nthe statute’s aim.8 In many cases, attorney’s fees awarded\n——————\n  8 JUSTICE BREYER’s opinion dramatically illustrates the danger of\n\nallowing a trial judge to award a huge enhancement not supported by\nany discernible methodology.

That observation plainly\nwas dicta, but one year later this Court relied on it to\nreject the “argument that an ‘upward adjustment’ ” to the\nlodestar calculation “is never permissible.” Blum v. Sten\nson, 465 U. S. 886, 897 (1984). Yet “we have never sus\ntained an enhancement of a lodestar amount for perform\nance,” ante, at 8, and our jurisprudence since Blum has\ncharted “a decisional arc that bends decidedly against\nenhancements,” 532 F. 3d 1209, 1221 (CA11 2008)\n(Carnes, J.).

The Court answers that question in the\naffirmative. See ante, at 1 (“We have stated in previous\ncases that such an increase is permitted in extraordinary\ncircumstances, and we reaffirm that rule”); see also ante,\np. ___ (KENNEDY, J., concurring). As our prior precedents\nmake clear, the lodestar calculation “does not end the [fee]\ninquiry” because there “remain other considerations that\nmay lead the district court to adjust the fee upward.”\nHensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 434 (1983). For that\nreason, “[t]he lodestar method was never intended to be\nconclusive in all circumstances.” Ante, at 9. Instead, as\nthe Court today reaffirms, when “superior attorney per\nformance,” ibid., leads to “exceptional success an enhanced\naward may be justified,” Hensley supra, at 435; see also\nPennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens’ Council for\nClean Air, 478 U. S. 546, 565 (1986); Blum v. Stenson, 465\n2                   PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nU. S. 886, 896–900 (1984). I agree with that conclusion.\n  Where the majority and I part ways is with respect to a\nquestion that is not presented, but that the Court\nobliquely, and in my view inappropriately, appears to\nconsider nonetheless—namely, whether the lower courts\ncorrectly determined in this case that exceptional circum\nstances justify a lodestar enhancement. See Parts IV–V,\nante; see also ante, p. ___ (KENNEDY, J., concurring). I\nwould not reach that issue, which lies beyond the narrow\nquestion that we agreed to consider. See 556 U. S. __\n(2009) (limiting review to the first question presented);\nPet. for Cert. i (stating question); see also Glover v. United\nStates, 531 U. S. 198, 205 (2001) (“As a general rule . . . we\ndo not decide issues outside the questions presented . . .”).\nNor do I believe that this Court, which is twice removed\nfrom the litigation underlying the fee determination, is\nproperly suited to resolve the fact-intensive inquiry that\n42 U. S. C. §1988 demands. But even were I to engage in\nthat inquiry, I would hold that the District Court did not\nabuse its discretion in awarding an enhancement. And\nI would therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.\n\n  As the Court explains, the basic question that must be\nresolved when considering an enhancement to the lodestar\nis whether the lodestar calculation “adequately meas\nure[s]” an attorney’s “value,” as “demonstrated” by his\nperformance “during the litigation.” Ante, at 10. While I\nunderstand the need for answering that question through\nthe application of standards, I also believe that the answer\ninevitably involves an element of judgment. Moreover,\nwhen reviewing a district court’s answer to that question,\nan appellate court must inevitably give weight to the fact\nthat a district court is better situated to provide that\nanswer.

S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\ncase, witnessed the proceedings, and been able to evaluate\nthe attorneys’ overall performance in light of the objec\ntives, context, legal difficulty, and practical obstacles\npresent in the case. In a word, the district judge will have\nobserved the attorney’s true “value, as demonstrated . . .\nduring the litigation.” Ibid. (emphasis added). By con\ntrast, a court of appeals, faced with a cold and perhaps\nlengthy record, will inevitably have less time and oppor\ntunity to determine whether the lawyers have done an\nexceptionally fine job. And this Court is yet less suited to\nperforming that inquiry.         Accordingly, determining\nwhether a fee enhancement is warranted in a given case\n“is a matter that is committed to the sound discretion of a\ntrial judge,” ante, at 13, and the function of appellate\ncourts is to review that judge’s determination for an abuse\nof such discretion. See Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S.\n552, 571 (1988); see also General Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522\nU. S. 136, 143 (1997) (“[D]eference . . . is the hallmark of\nabuse-of-discretion review”).\n   This case well illustrates why our tiered and function\nally specialized judicial system places the task of deter\nmining an attorney’s fee award primarily in the district\ncourt’s hands. The plaintiffs’ lawyers spent eight years\ninvestigating the underlying facts, developing the initial\ncomplaint, conducting court proceedings, and working out\nfinal relief. The District Court’s docket, with over 600\nentries, consists of more than 18,000 pages. Transcripts of\nhearings and depositions, along with other documents,\nhave produced a record that fills 20 large boxes. Neither\nwe, nor an appellate panel, can easily read that entire\nrecord. Nor should we attempt to second-guess a district\njudge who is aware of the many intangible matters that\nthe written page cannot reflect.\n   My own review of this expansive record cannot possibly\nbe exhaustive. But those portions of the record I have\nreviewed lead me to conclude, like the Court of Appeals,\n4                     PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                       Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nthat the District Judge did not abuse his discretion when\nawarding an enhanced fee. I reach this conclusion based\non four considerations.\n   First, the record indicates that the lawyers’ objective in\nthis case was unusually important and fully consistent\nwith the central objectives of the basic federal civil-rights\nstatute, 42 U. S. C. §1983. Moreover, the problem the\nattorneys faced demanded an exceptionally high degree of\nskill and effort. Specifically, these lawyers and their\nclients sought to have the State of Georgia reform its\nentire foster-care system—a system that much in the\nrecord describes as well below the level of minimal consti\ntutional acceptability. The record contains investigative\nreports, mostly prepared by Georgia’s own Office of the\nChild Advocate, which show, for example, the following:\n    •\t The State’s foster-care system was unable to provide\n       essential medical and mental health services; children\n       consequently and unnecessarily suffered illness and\n       life long medical disabilities, such as permanent hear\n       ing loss, due to failures on the part of the State to ad\n       minister basic care and antibiotics. See, e.g., Doc. 3,\n       Exh. 3C, pp. 11–13.\n    •\t Understaffing and improper staffing placed children\n       in the care of individuals with dangerous criminal re\n       cords; children were physically assaulted by the staff,\n       locked outside of the shelters at night as punishment,\n       and abused in other ways. See, e.g., Doc. 50, pp. 32–\n       36, 55; Doc. 3, Exh. 3A, pp. 2–6; Doc. 3, Exh. 2, pp. 4–\n       5; Doc. 52, Exh. 1, pp. 6, 12–15, 34.\n    •\t The shelters themselves were “unsanitary and dilapi\n       dated,” “unclean,” infested with rats, “overcrowded,”\n       unsafe, and “ ‘out of control.’ ” See, e.g., Doc. 3, Exh.\n       3A, at 1–2; Doc. 3, Exh. 3B, p. 2; Doc. 50, at 29.\n    •\t Due to improper supervision and other deficiencies at\n       the shelters, 20% of the children abused drugs; some\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n     also became victims of child prostitution. See id., at\n     39; Doc. 3, Exh. 3A, at 3.\n  •\t Systemic failures also caused vulnerable children to\n     suffer regular beatings and sexual abuse, including\n     rape, at the hands of more aggressive shelter resi\n     dents. See, e.g., Doc. 50, at 18–22, 54–55; Doc. 52,\n     Exh. 1, at 7–10, 26; Doc. 3, Exh. 3B, at 3 (“[A child]\n     was beaten so badly by eight other [children] that he\n     suffered severe internal bleeding”); id., at 4 (describ\n     ing violent sexual assault and rape).\n  •\t Not surprisingly, many children—upwards of 5 per\n     day and over 750 per year—tried to escape these con\n     ditions; others tried to commit suicide. See, e.g., Doc.\n     50, at 27–28, 54; Doc. 52, Exh. 18, p. 4 (under seal) (at\n     least 25% of children run away from shelters); Doc.\n     52, Exh. 18E, pp. 1–11, 18–19 (under seal) (daily logs);\n     see also Doc. 50, Exh. 1, at 37, 54 (describing suicide\n     attempts) (all docket entries above and hereinafter re\n     fer to No. 1:02–cv–1686 (ND Ga.) (case below)).\n   The State’s Office of the Child Advocate, whose reports\nprovide much of the basis for the foregoing description,\nconcluded that the system was “operating in crisis mode”\nand that any private operator who ran such a system\n“would never be licensed to care for children.” Office of the\nChild Advocate for the Protection of Children Ann. Rep.\n10, 14 (2001), Record, Doc. 3, Exh. 3C (hereinafter OCA\n2001 Report); accord, id., Exh. 3A, at 1. The advocate\nnoted that neither her investigative reports nor national\nnews publicity (including a television program that high\nlighted a 5-year-old foster child’s death from beatings)\nhad prompted corrective action by the State. OCA 2001\nReport 1, 14.\n   The advocate further stated that litigation was neces\nsary to force reform. Id., at 14–15. And she repeatedly\nasked the State to give her office the authority to conduct\n6                    PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nthat litigation.

But the State did not grant the Child\nAdvocate’s office the litigating authority she sought. See\n2000 Ga. Laws p. 245, as codified, Ga. Code Ann. §15–11–\n173 (2008).\n   The upshot is that the plaintiffs’ attorneys did what the\nchild advocate could not do: They initiated this lawsuit.\nThey thereby assumed the role of “a ‘private attorney\ngeneral’ ” by filling an enforcement void in the State’s own\nlegal system, a function “that Congress considered of the\nhighest priority,” Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc.,\n390 U. S. 400, 402 (1968) (per curiam), and “meant to\npromote in enacting §1988,” Texas State Teachers Assn. v.\nGarland Independent School Dist., 489 U. S. 782, 793\n(1989).\n   Second, the course of the lawsuit was lengthy and ardu\nous. The plaintiffs and their lawyers began with factual\ninvestigations beyond those which the child advocate had\nalready conducted. See, e.g., Record, Docs. 50–52 (par\ntially under seal). They then filed suit. And the State met\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nthe plaintiffs’ efforts with a host of complex procedural, as\nwell as substantive, objections. The State, for example,\nargued that the law forbade the plaintiffs to investigate\nthe shelters; on the eve of a state-court decision that might\nhave approved the investigations, the State then removed\nthe case to federal court; the State then sought protective\norders preventing the attorneys from speaking to the\nshelters’ staff; and, after losing its motions, the State\ndelayed to the point where the District Court “was forced\nto admonish [the] State Defendants for ‘relying on techni\ncal legal objections to discovery requests in order to delay\nand hinder the discovery process.’ ” 454 F. Supp. 2d. 1260,\n1268 (ND Ga. 2006) (quoting Record, Doc. 145, p. 4). See\nalso Doc. 1; Doc. 3, pp. 9–10; Docs. 26, 28–29, 44, 60.\n  In the meantime, the State moved for dismissal, basing\nthe motion on complex legal doctrines such as Younger\nabstention and the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, which the\nDistrict Court found inapplicable. 218 F. R. D. 277, 284–\n290 (ND Ga. 2003). See Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37\n(1971); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413 (1923),\nand District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460\nU. S. 462 (1983). The State also opposed the petitioners’\nrequest to certify a class of the 3,000 children in foster\ncare, but the District Court again rejected the State’s\nargument. 218 F. R. D., at 299–302. And, after that, the\nState filed a lengthy motion for summary judgment, Re\ncord, Docs. 243–245, which plaintiffs’ attorneys opposed in\nthorough briefing supported by comprehensive exhibits,\nsee Docs. 254–258, 260. After losing that motion and\neventually agreeing to mediation, the State forced pro\ntracted litigation as to who should be the mediator. See\nDocs. 363–364, 366, 369–370, 373, 376, 380. All told, in\nopposing the plaintiffs’ efforts to have the foster-care\nsystem reformed, the State spent $2.4 million on outside\ncounsel (who, because they charge the State reduced rates,\nworked significantly more hours than that figure alone\n8                   PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nindicates) and tapped its own law department for an addi\ntional 5,200 hours of work. 454 F. Supp. 2d, at 1287.\n   Third, in the face of this opposition, the results obtained\nby the plaintiffs’ attorneys appear to have been excep\ntional. The 47-page consent decree negotiated over the\ncourse of the mediation sets forth 31 specific steps that the\nState will take in order to address the specific deficiencies\nof the sort that I described above. See id., at 1289; see\nalso App. 92–207 (consent decree). And it establishes a\nreporting and oversight mechanism that is backed up by\nthe District Court’s enforcement authority. See 454\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1289. As a result of the decree, the State\nagreed to comprehensive reforms of its foster-care system,\nto the benefit of children in many different communities.\nAnd informed observers have described the decree as\nhaving brought about significant positive results. See,\ne.g., Record, Doc. 632, p. 4 (most recent court-appointed\noverseers’ report) (“The State’s overall performance . . .\ncontinues the trend of steady improvement . . .”); id., at 4–\n10 (detailing substantial health, safety, and welfare im\nprovements); see also, Office of the Child Advocate Ann.\nReport (2008), Letter from Tom C.

Supp. 2d, at 1282;\n 2. “based on its personal observation of plaintiffs’ coun\n    sel’s performance throughout this litigation, the Court\n    finds that . . . counsel brought a higher degree of skill,\n    commitment, dedication, and professionalism to this\n    litigation than the Court has seen displayed by the at\n    torneys in any other case during its 27 years on the\n    bench,” id., at 1288–1290;\n 3. the Consent Decree “provided extraordinary benefits\n    to the plaintiff class . . . .” Id., at 1282. “[T]he settle\n    ment achieved by plaintiffs’ counsel is comprehensive\n    in its scope and detailed in its coverage. . . . After 58\n    years as a practicing attorney and federal judge, the\n    Court is unaware of any other case in which a plaintiff\n    class has achieved such a favorable result on such a\n    comprehensive scale,” id., at 1289–1290.\nBased on these observations and on its assessment of the\nattorneys’ performance during the course of the litigation,\nthe District Court concluded that “the evidence establishes\nthat the quality of service rendered by class counsel . . .\nwas far superior to what consumers of legal services in the\nlegal marketplace . . . could reasonably expect to receive\nfor the rates used in the lodestar calculation.” Id., at\n1288.\n  On the basis of what I have read, I believe that assess\nment was correct. I recognize that the ordinary lodestar\ncalculation yields a large fee award. But by my assess\n10                  PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nment, the lodestar calculation in this case translates to an\naverage hourly fee per attorney of $249. See id., at 1287\n(lodestar calculation and attorney hours). (The majority’s\nreference to an hourly fee of $866, ante, at 12, refers to the\nrate associated with the single highest paid of the 17\nattorneys under the enhanced fee, not the average hourly\nrate under the lodestar. The lay reader should also bear\nin mind that a lawyer’s “fee” is substantially greater than\nhis “profit,” given that attorneys must sometimes cover\ncase-specific costs (which in this case exceeded $800,000,\nsee 454 F. Supp. 2d, at 1291) and also must cover routine\noverhead expenses, which typically consume 40% of their\nfees, see Altman Weil Publications, Inc., Survey of Law\nFirm Economics 30 (2007 ed.)).\n   At $249 per hour, the lodestar would compensate this\ngroup of attorneys—whom the District Court described as\nextraordinary—at a rate lower than the average rate\ncharged by attorneys practicing law in the State of Geor\ngia, where the average hourly rate is $268. See id., at 89.\nAccordingly, even the majority would seem to acknowledge\nthat some form of an enhancement is appropriate in this\ncase. See ante, at 10 (“[A]n enhancement may be appro\npriate where the method used in determining the hourly\nrate employed in the lodestar calculation does not ade\nquately measure the attorney’s true market value, as\ndemonstrated in part during the litigation”). Indeed, the\nfact that these exceptional results were achieved in a case\nwhere “much of the work,” ante, at 13, n. 7, was performed\nby relatively inexperienced attorneys (who, accordingly,\nwould be compensated by the lodestar “below the market\naverage,” ibid.) is all the more reason to think that their\nservice rendered their outstanding performance worthy of\nan enhancement. By comparison, the District Court’s\nenhanced award—a special one-time adjustment unique to\nthis exceptional case—would compensate these attorneys,\non this one occasion, at an average hourly rate of $435,\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nwhich is comparable to the rates charged by the Nation’s\nleading law firms on average on every occasion. See Firm\nby-Firm Sampling of Billing Rates Nationwide, National\nLaw Journal, Dec. 11, 2006, p. S2 (listing 13 firms at\nwhich average hourly rate is between $400 and $510); J.\nBarnett, Certification Drag: The Opinion Puzzle and\nOther Transactional Curiosities, 33 Iowa J. Corp. L. 95,\n110, n. 58 (2007) (“These numbers are probably an under\nestimate given that many of the highest-billing national\nlaw firms decline to take part in the National Law Journal\nSurvey”). Thus, it would appear that the enhanced award\nis wholly consistent with the purpose of §1988, which was\nenacted to ensure that “counsel for prevailing parties [are]\npaid as is traditional with attorneys compensated by a fee\npaying client.” S. Rep. No. 94–1011, p. 6 (1976); see H. R.\nRep. No. 94–1558, p. 9 (1976) (“[C]ivil rights plaintiffs\nshould not be singled out for different and less favorable\ntreatment”); see also Blum, 465 U. S., at 893, 897.\n   In any event, the circumstances I have listed likely\nmake this a “rare” or “exceptional” case warranting an\nenhanced fee award. And they certainly make clear that it\nwas neither unreasonable nor an abuse of discretion for\nthe District Court to reach that conclusion. Indeed, if the\nfacts and circumstances that I have described are even\nroughly correct, then it is fair to ask: If this is not an\nexceptional case, what is?\n                       *     *     *\n  My disagreement with the Court is limited. As I stated\nat the outset, we are in complete agreement with respect\nto the answer to the question presented: “[A]n increase” to\nthe lodestar “due to superior performance and results” “is\npermitted in extraordinary circumstances.” Ante, at 1.\nUnlike JUSTICE THOMAS, I do not read the Court’s opinion\nto “advance our attorney’s fees jurisprudence further along\nthe decisional arc” toward a point where enhancements\n12                  PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nare “virtually” barred in all cases. Ante, at 2 (concurring\nopinion). Our prior cases make clear that enhancements\nare permitted in “ ‘exceptional’ cases,” Delaware Valley,\n478 U. S., at 565, where the attorney achieves “exceptional\nsuccess,” Hensley, 461 U. S., at 435; see also Blum, 465\nU. S., at 896–901. By definition, such exceptional circum\nstances occur only rarely. See ante, p. ___ (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring). I do not see how the Court could “advance”\nour fee enhancement jurisprudence so as to further dis\ncourage lodestar enhancements without overruling the\nprecedents I have just cited, which the Court has not done.\nTo the contrary, today the Court “reaffirm[s]” those prece\ndents, which allow enhancements for exceptional perform\nance. Ante, at 1. And with respect to that central holding\nwe are unanimous.\n   Nor is my disagreement with the Court absolute with\nrespect to the proper resolution of the case before us, for\nthe Court does not purport to prohibit the District Court\nfrom awarding an enhanced fee on remand if that court\nprovides more detailed reasoning supporting its decision.\nAnte, at 12; cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 47. But the majority and I\ndo disagree in this respect: I would not disturb the judg\nment below. “A request for attorney’s fees should not\nresult in a second major litigation.” Hensley, 461 U. S., at\n437. Nor should it lead to years of protracted appellate\nreview. See id., at 455–456 (Brennan, J., concurring in\npart and dissenting in part). We did not grant certiorari\nin this case to consider the fact-intensive dispute over\nwhether this is, in fact, an exceptional case that merits a\nlodestar enhancement. The District Court has already\nresolved that question and the Court of Appeals affirmed\nits judgment, having found no abuse of discretion. I would\nhave been content to resolve no more than the question\npresented. But, even were I to follow the Court’s inclina\ntion to say more, I would hold that the principles upon\nwhich we agree—including the applicability of abuse-of\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

Argued October 14, 2009—Decided April 21, 2010\nTitle 42 U. S. C. §1988 authorizes courts to award a “reasonable” attor\n  ney’s fee for prevailing parties in civil rights actions. Half of respon\n  dents’ $14 million fee request was based on their calculation of the\n  “lodestar,” i.e., the number of hours the attorneys and their employ\n  ees worked multiplied by the hourly rates prevailing in the commu\n  nity. The other half represented a fee enhancement for superior work\n  and results, supported by affidavits claiming that the lodestar would\n  be insufficient to induce lawyers of comparable skill and experience\n  to litigate this case. Awarding fees of about $10.5 million, the Dis\n  trict Court found that the proposed hourly rates were “fair and rea\n  sonable,” but that some of the entries on counsel’s billing records\n  were vague and that the hours claimed for many categories were ex\n  cessive. The court therefore cut the lodestar to approximately $6 mil\n  lion, but enhanced that award by 75%, or an additional $4.5 million.\n  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed in reliance on its precedent.\nHeld:\n    1. The calculation of an attorney’s fee based on the lodestar may be\n increased due to superior performance, but only in extraordinary cir\n cumstances. Pp. 5–12.\n       (a) The lodestar approach has “achieved dominance in the federal\n courts.” Gisbrecht v. Barnhart, 535 U. S. 789, 801. Although imper\n fect, it has several important virtues: It produces an award that ap\n proximates the fee the prevailing attorney would have received for\n representing a paying client who was billed by the hour in a compa\n rable case; and it is readily administrable, see, e.g., Burlington v. Da\n gue, 505 U. S. 557, 566, and “objective,” Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461\n U. S. 424, 433, thereby cabining trial judges’ discretion, permitting\n2                         PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    meaningful judicial review, and producing reasonably predictable re\n    sults. Pp. 5–7.\n         (b) This Court has established six important rules that lead to\n    today’s decision. First, a “reasonable” fee is one that is sufficient to\n    induce a capable attorney to undertake the representation of a meri\n    torious civil rights case, see Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citi\n    zens’ Council for Clean Air, 478 U. S. 546, 565, but that does not pro\n    vide “a form of economic relief to improve the financial lot of\n    attorneys,” ibid. Second, there is a “strong” presumption that the\n    lodestar method yields a sufficient fee. See, e.g., id., at 564. Third,\n    the Court has never sustained an enhancement of a lodestar amount\n    for performance, but has repeatedly said that an enhancement may\n    be awarded in “rare” and “exceptional” circumstances. E.g., id., at\n    565. Fourth, “the lodestar includes most, if not all, of the relevant\n    factors constituting a ‘reasonable’ attorney’s fee.” Id., at 566. An en\n    hancement may not be based on a factor that is subsumed in the\n    lodestar calculation, such as the case’s novelty and complexity, see,\n    e.g., Blum v. Stenson, 465 U. S. 886, 898, or the quality of an attor\n    ney’s performance, Delaware Valley, supra, at 566. Fifth, the burden\n    of proving that an enhancement is necessary must be borne by the fee\n    applicant. E.g., Blum, 465 U. S., at 901. Sixth, an applicant seeking\n    an enhancement must produce “specific evidence” supporting the\n    award, id., at 899, 901, to assure that the calculation is objective and\n    capable of being reviewed on appeal. Pp. 7–9.\n         (c) The Court rejects any contention that a fee determined by the\n    lodestar method may not be enhanced in any situation. The “strong\n    presumption” that the lodestar is reasonable may be overcome in\n    those rare circumstances in which the lodestar does not adequately\n    account for a factor that may properly be considered in determining a\n    reasonable fee. P. 9.\n         (d) The Court treats the quality of an attorney’s performance and\n    the results obtained as one factor, since superior results are relevant\n    only to the extent it can be shown that they stem from superior at\n    torney performance and not another factor, such as inferior perform\n    ance by opposing counsel. The circumstances in which superior at\n    torney performance is not adequately taken into account in the\n    lodestar calculation are “rare” and “exceptional.” Enhancements\n    should not be awarded without specific evidence that the lodestar fee\n    would not have been “adequate to attract competent counsel.” Blum,\n    supra, at 897. First, an enhancement may be appropriate where the\n    method used to determine the hourly rate does not adequately meas\n    ure the attorney’s true market value, as demonstrated in part during\n    the litigation. This may occur if the hourly rate formula takes into\n    account only a single factor (such as years since admission to the bar)\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  or perhaps only a few similar factors. In such a case, the trial judge\n  should adjust the hourly rate in accordance with specific proof linking\n  the attorney’s ability to a prevailing market rate. Second, an en\n  hancement may be appropriate if the attorney’s performance includes\n  an extraordinary outlay of expenses and the litigation is exception\n  ally protracted. In such cases, the enhancement amount must be cal\n  culated using a method that is reasonable, objective, and capable of\n  being reviewed on appeal, such as by applying a standard interest\n  rate to the qualifying expense outlays. Third, an enhancement may\n  be appropriate where an attorney’s performance involves exceptional\n  delay in the payment of fees. In such a case, the enhancement should\n  be calculated by a method similar to that used for an exceptional de\n  lay in expense reimbursement. Enhancements are not appropriate\n  on the ground that departures from hourly billing are becoming more\n  common. Nor can they be based on a flawed analogy to the increas\n  ingly popular practice of paying attorneys a reduced hourly rate with\n  a bonus for obtaining specified results. Pp. 9–12.\n     2. The District Court did not provide proper justification for the\n  75% fee enhancement it awarded in this case. It commented that the\n  enhancement was necessary to compensate counsel at the appropri\n  ate hourly rate, but the effect was to raise the top rate from $495 to\n  more than $866 per hour, while nothing in the record shows that this\n  is an appropriate figure for the relevant market. The court also em\n  phasized that counsel had to make extraordinary outlays for ex\n  penses and wait for reimbursement, but did not calculate the amount\n  of the enhancement attributable to this factor. Similarly, the court\n  noted that counsel did not receive fees on an ongoing basis during the\n  case, but did not sufficiently link this to proof that the delay was out\n  side the normal range expected by attorneys who rely on §1988 for\n  fees. Nor did the court calculate the cost to counsel of any extraordi\n  nary and unwarranted delay. And its reliance on the contingency of\n  the outcome contravenes Dague, supra, at 565. Finally, insofar as\n  the court relied on a comparison of counsel’s performance in this case\n  with that of counsel in unnamed prior cases, it did not employ a\n  methodology that permitted meaningful appellate review. While de\n  termining a “reasonable attorney’s fee” is within the trial judge’s\n  sound discretion under §1988, that discretion is not unlimited. The\n  judge must provide a reasonably specific explanation for all aspects of\n  a fee determination, including any enhancement.

But as we have also said in prior cases,\nthere is a strong presumption that the lodestar is suffi\ncient; factors subsumed in the lodestar calculation cannot\nbe used as a ground for increasing an award above the\nlodestar; and a party seeking fees has the burden of identi\nfying a factor that the lodestar does not adequately take\n——————\n  1 JUSTICE BREYER would have us answer this question “Yes” and then\n\nend the opinion. See post, at 2 (opinion concurring in part and dissent\ning in part). Such an opinion would be of little use to the bench or bar\nand would pointlessly invite an additional round of litigation. The\nissue of the standards to be applied in granting an enhancement is\nfairly subsumed within the question that we agreed to decide and has\nbeen extensively discussed in the briefs filed in this case.\n2                        PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ninto account and proving with specificity that an enhanced\nfee is justified. Because the District Court did not apply\nthese standards, we reverse the decision below and re\nmand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   Respondents (plaintiffs below) are children in the Geor\ngia foster-care system and their next friends. They filed\nthis class action on behalf of 3,000 children in foster care\nand named as defendants the Governor of Georgia and\nvarious state officials (petitioners in this case). Claiming\nthat deficiencies in the foster-care system in two counties\nnear Atlanta violated their federal and state constitutional\nand statutory rights, respondents sought injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief, as well as attorney’s fees and expenses.\n   The United States District Court for the Northern Dis\ntrict of Georgia eventually referred the case to mediation,\nwhere the parties entered into a consent decree, which the\nDistrict Court approved. The consent decree resolved all\npending issues other than the fees that respondents’ at\ntorneys were entitled to receive under 42 U. S. C. §1988.2\n                              B\n  Respondents submitted a request for more than $14\nmillion in attorney’s fees. Half of that amount was based\non their calculation of the lodestar—roughly 30,000 hours\nmultiplied by hourly rates of $200 to $495 for attorneys\nand $75 to $150 for non-attorneys. In support of their fee\n——————\n    2 Title\n         42 U. S.

S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequest, respondents submitted affidavits asserting that\nthese rates were within the range of prevailing market\nrates for legal services in the relevant market.\n   The other half of the amount that respondents sought\nrepresented a fee enhancement for superior work and\nresults. Affidavits submitted in support of this request\nclaimed that the lodestar amount “would be generally\ninsufficient to induce lawyers of comparable skill, judg\nment, professional representation and experience” to\nlitigate this case. See, e.g., App. 80. Petitioners objected\nto the fee request, contending that some of the proposed\nhourly rates were too high, that the hours claimed were\nexcessive, and that the enhancement would duplicate\nfactors that were reflected in the lodestar amount.\n   The District Court awarded fees of approximately\n$10.5 million. See 454 F. Supp. 2d 1260, 1296 (ND Ga.\n2006). The District Court found that the hourly rates\nproposed by respondents were “fair and reasonable,” id., at\n1285, but that some of the entries on counsel’s billing\nrecords were vague and that the hours claimed for many of\nthe billing categories were excessive. The court therefore\ncut the non-travel hours by 15% and halved the hourly\nrate for travel hours. This resulted in a lodestar calcula\ntion of approximately $6 million.\n   The court then enhanced this award by 75%, concluding\nthat the lodestar calculation did not take into account “(1)\nthe fact that class counsel were required to advance case\nexpenses of $1.7 million over a three-year period with no\non[-]going reimbursement, (2) the fact that class counsel\nwere not paid on an on-going basis as the work was being\nperformed, and (3) the fact that class counsel’s ability to\nrecover a fee and expense reimbursement were completely\ncontingent on the outcome of the case.” Id., at 1288. The\ncourt stated that respondents’ attorneys had exhibited “a\nhigher degree of skill, commitment, dedication, and pro\nfessionalism . . . than the Court has seen displayed by the\n4                   PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nattorneys in any other case during its 27 years on the\nbench.” Id., at 1289. The court also commented that the\nresults obtained were “ ‘extraordinary’ ” and added that\n“[a]fter 58 years as a practicing attorney and federal\njudge, the Court is unaware of any other case in which a\nplaintiff class has achieved such a favorable result on such\na comprehensive scale.” Id., at 1290. The enhancement\nresulted in an additional $4.5 million fee award.\n   Relying on prior Circuit precedent, a panel of the Elev\nenth Circuit affirmed. 532 F. 3d 1209 (2008). The panel\nheld that the District Court had not abused its discretion\nby failing to make a larger reduction in the number of\nhours for which respondents’ attorneys sought reim\nbursement, but the panel commented that it “would have\ncut the billable hours more if we were deciding the matter\nin the first instance” and added that the hourly rates\napproved by the District Court also “appear[ed] to be on\nthe generous side.” Id., at 1220, and n. 2. On the question\nof the enhancement, however, the panel splintered, with\neach judge writing a separate opinion.\n   Judge Carnes concluded that binding Eleventh Circuit\nprecedent required that the decision of the District Court\nbe affirmed, but he opined that the reasoning in our opin\nions suggested that no enhancement should be allowed in\nthis case. He concluded that the quality of the attorneys’\nperformance was “adequately accounted for ‘either in\ndetermining the reasonable number of hours expended on\nthe litigation or in setting the reasonable hourly rates.’ ”\nId., at 1225 (quoting Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley\nCitizens’ Council for Clean Air, 478 U. S. 546, 565–566\n(1986) (Delaware Valley I)). He found that an enhance\nment could not be justified based on delay in the recovery\nof attorney’s fees and reimbursable expenses because such\ndelay is a routine feature of cases brought under 42\nU. S. C. §1983. And he reasoned that the District Court\nhad contravened our holding in Burlington v. Dague, 505\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

Judge Hill also con\ncurred in the judgment but expressed no view about the\ncorrectness of the prior Circuit precedent.\n   The Eleventh Circuit denied rehearing en banc over the\ndissent of three judges. See 547 F. 3d 1319 (2008). Judge\nWilson filed an opinion concurring in the denial of rehear\ning; Judge Carnes, joined by Judges Tjoflat and Dubina,\nfiled an opinion dissenting from the denial of rehearing;\nand Judge Tjoflat filed a separate dissent, contending,\namong other things, that the District Court, by basing the\nenhancement in large part on a comparison of the per\nformance of respondents’ attorneys with all of the un\nnamed attorneys whose work he had observed during his\nprofessional career, had improperly rendered a decision\nthat was effectively unreviewable on appeal and had\nessentially served as a witness in support of the enhance\nment. Id., at 1326–1327.\n   We granted certiorari. 556 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                            II\n  The general rule in our legal system is that each party\nmust pay its own attorney’s fees and expenses, see Hensley\nv. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 429 (1983), but Congress\nenacted 42 U. S. C. §1988 in order to ensure that federal\nrights are adequately enforced. Section 1988 provides that\na prevailing party in certain civil rights actions may re\ncover “a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs.”3\n\n——————\n  3 Virtually identical language appears in many of the federal fee\n\nshifting statutes. See Burlington v. Dague, 505 U. S. 557, 562 (1992).\n6                       PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nUnfortunately, the statute does not explain what Congress\nmeant by a “reasonable” fee, and therefore the task of\nidentifying an appropriate methodology for determining a\n“reasonable” fee was left for the courts.\n   One possible method was set out in Johnson v. Georgia\nHighway Express, Inc., 488 F. 2d 714, 717–719 (CA5\n1974), which listed 12 factors that a court should consider\nin determining a reasonable fee.4 This method, however,\n“gave very little actual guidance to district courts. Setting\nattorney’s fees by reference to a series of sometimes sub\njective factors placed unlimited discretion in trial judges\nand produced disparate results.” Delaware Valley I,\nsupra, at 563.\n   An alternative, the lodestar approach, was pioneered by\nthe Third Circuit in Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. of Philadel\nphia v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corp.,\n487 F. 2d 161 (1973), appeal after remand, 540 F. 2d 102\n(1976), and “achieved dominance in the federal courts”\nafter our decision in Hensley. Gisbrecht v. Barnhart, 535\nU. S. 789, 801 (2002). “Since that time, ‘[t]he “lodestar”\nfigure has, as its name suggests, become the guiding light\nof our fee-shifting jurisprudence.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Dague,\nsupra, at 562).\n   Although the lodestar method is not perfect, it has\nseveral important virtues. First, in accordance with our\nunderstanding of the aim of fee-shifting statutes, the\nlodestar looks to “the prevailing market rates in the rele\n——————\n   4 These factors were: “(1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty\n\nand difficulty of the questions; (3) the skill requisite to perform the\nlegal service properly; (4) the preclusion of employment by the attorney\ndue to the acceptance of the case; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the\nfee is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations imposed by the client or\nthe circumstances; (8) the amount involved and the results obtained; (9)\nthe experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) the ‘unde\nsirability’ of the case; (11) the nature and length of the professional\nrelationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases.” Hensley\nv. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 430, n. 3 (1983).\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvant community.” Blum v. Stenson, 465 U. S. 886, 895\n(1984). Developed after the practice of hourly billing had\nbecome widespread, see Gisbrecht, supra, at 801, the\nlodestar method produces an award that roughly approxi\nmates the fee that the prevailing attorney would have\nreceived if he or she had been representing a paying client\nwho was billed by the hour in a comparable case. Second,\nthe lodestar method is readily administrable, see Dague,\n505 U. S., at 566; see also Buckhannon Board & Care\nHome, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human\nResources, 532 U. S. 598, 609 (2001); and unlike the John\nson approach, the lodestar calculation is “objective,”\nHensley, supra, at 433, and thus cabins the discretion of\ntrial judges, permits meaningful judicial review, and\nproduces reasonably predictable results.\n                             III\n   Our prior decisions concerning the federal fee-shifting\nstatutes have established six important rules that lead to\nour decision in this case.\n   First, a “reasonable” fee is a fee that is sufficient to\ninduce a capable attorney to undertake the representation\nof a meritorious civil rights case. See Delaware Valley I,\n478 U. S., at 565 (“[I]f plaintiffs . . . find it possible to\nengage a lawyer based on the statutory assurance that he\nwill be paid a ‘reasonable fee,’ the purpose behind the fee\nshifting statute has been satisfied”); Blum, supra, at 897\n(“[A] reasonable attorney’s fee is one that is adequate to\nattract competent counsel, but that does not produce\nwindfalls to attorneys” (ellipsis, brackets, and internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Section 1988’s aim is to en\nforce the covered civil rights statutes, not to provide “a\nform of economic relief to improve the financial lot of\nattorneys.” Delaware Valley I, supra, at 565.\n   Second, the lodestar method yields a fee that is pre\nsumptively sufficient to achieve this objective. See Dague,\n8                   PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsupra, at 562; Delaware Valley I, supra, at 565; Blum,\nsupra, at 897; see also Gisbrecht, supra, at 801–802.\nIndeed, we have said that the presumption is a “strong”\none. Dague, supra, at 562; Delaware Valley I, supra, at\n565.\n   Third, although we have never sustained an enhance\nment of a lodestar amount for performance, see Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 12, 17, we have repeat\nedly said that enhancements may be awarded in “ ‘rare’ ”\nand “ ‘exceptional’ ” circumstances. Delaware Valley I,\nsupra, at 565; Blum, supra, at 897; Hensley, 461 U. S., at\n435.\n   Fourth, we have noted that “the lodestar figure includes\nmost, if not all, of the relevant factors constituting a ‘rea\nsonable’ attorney’s fee,” Delaware Valley I, supra, at 566,\nand have held that an enhancement may not be awarded\nbased on a factor that is subsumed in the lodestar calcula\ntion, see Dague, supra, at 562–563; Pennsylvania v. Dela\nware Valley Citizens’ Council for Clean Air, 483 U. S. 711,\n726–727 (1987) (Delaware Valley II) (plurality opinion);\nBlum, 465 U. S., at 898. We have thus held that the nov\nelty and complexity of a case generally may not be used as\na ground for an enhancement because these factors “pre\nsumably [are] fully reflected in the number of billable\nhours recorded by counsel.” Ibid. We have also held that\nthe quality of an attorney’s performance generally should\nnot be used to adjust the lodestar “[b]ecause considera\ntions concerning the quality of a prevailing party’s coun\nsel’s representation normally are reflected in the reason\nable hourly rate.” Delaware Valley I, supra, at 566.\n   Fifth, the burden of proving that an enhancement is\nnecessary must be borne by the fee applicant. Dague,\nsupra, at 561; Blum, 465 U. S., at 901–902.\n   Finally, a fee applicant seeking an enhancement must\nproduce “specific evidence” that supports the award. Id.,\nat 899, 901 (An enhancement must be based on “evidence\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat enhancement was necessary to provide fair and rea\nsonable compensation”). This requirement is essential if\nthe lodestar method is to realize one of its chief virtues,\ni.e., providing a calculation that is objective and capable of\nbeing reviewed on appeal.\n                             IV \n\n                              A\n\n   In light of what we have said in prior cases, we reject\nany contention that a fee determined by the lodestar\nmethod may not be enhanced in any situation. The lode\nstar method was never intended to be conclusive in all\ncircumstances. Instead, there is a “strong presumption”\nthat the lodestar figure is reasonable, but that presump\ntion may be overcome in those rare circumstances in\nwhich the lodestar does not adequately take into account a\nfactor that may properly be considered in determining a\nreasonable fee.\n                             B\n   In this case, we are asked to decide whether either the\nquality of an attorney’s performance or the results ob\ntained are factors that may properly provide a basis for an\nenhancement. We treat these two factors as one. When a\nplaintiff’s attorney achieves results that are more favor\nable than would have been predicted based on the govern\ning law and the available evidence, the outcome may be\nattributable to superior performance and commitment of\nresources by plaintiff’s counsel. Or the outcome may\nresult from inferior performance by defense counsel, unan\nticipated defense concessions, unexpectedly favorable\nrulings by the court, an unexpectedly sympathetic jury, or\nsimple luck. Since none of these latter causes can justify\nan enhanced award, superior results are relevant only to\nthe extent it can be shown that they are the result of\nsuperior attorney performance. Thus, we need only con\n10                       PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsider whether superior attorney performance can justify\nan enhancement. And in light of the principles derived\nfrom our prior cases, we inquire whether there are circum\nstances in which superior attorney performance is not\nadequately taken into account in the lodestar calculation.\nWe conclude that there are a few such circumstances but\nthat these circumstances are indeed “rare” and “excep\ntional,” and require specific evidence that the lodestar\nfee would not have been “adequate to attract competent\ncounsel,” Blum, supra, at 897 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   First, an enhancement may be appropriate where the\nmethod used in determining the hourly rate employed in\nthe lodestar calculation does not adequately measure the\nattorney’s true market value, as demonstrated in part\nduring the litigation.5 This may occur if the hourly rate is\ndetermined by a formula that takes into account only a\nsingle factor (such as years since admission to the bar)6 or\nperhaps only a few similar factors. In such a case, an\nenhancement may be appropriate so that an attorney is\ncompensated at the rate that the attorney would receive in\ncases not governed by the federal fee-shifting statutes.\nBut in order to provide a calculation that is objective and\nreviewable, the trial judge should adjust the attorney’s\nhourly rate in accordance with specific proof linking the\nattorney’s ability to a prevailing market rate.\n   Second, an enhancement may be appropriate if the\n\n——————\n   5 Respondents correctly note that an attorney’s “brilliant insights and\n\ncritical maneuvers sometimes matter far more than hours worked or\nyears of experience.” Brief for Respondents 14. But as we said in Blum\nv. Stenson, 465 U. S. 886, 898 (1984), “[i]n those cases, the special skill\nand experience of counsel should be reflected in the reasonableness of\nthe hourly rates.”\n   6 See, e.g., Salazar v. District of Columbia, 123 F. Supp. 2d 8 (DC\n\n2000); Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 572 F. Supp. 354 (DC 1983),\naff’d in part, rev’d in part, 746 F. 2d 4 (CADC 1984).\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nattorney’s performance includes an extraordinary outlay of\nexpenses and the litigation is exceptionally protracted. As\nJudge Carnes noted below, when an attorney agrees to\nrepresent a civil rights plaintiff who cannot afford to pay\nthe attorney, the attorney presumably understands that\nno reimbursement is likely to be received until the suc\ncessful resolution of the case, 532 F. 3d, at 1227, and\ntherefore enhancements to compensate for delay in reim\nbursement for expenses must be reserved for unusual\ncases. In such exceptional cases, however, an enhance\nment may be allowed, but the amount of the enhancement\nmust be calculated using a method that is reasonable,\nobjective, and capable of being reviewed on appeal, such as\nby applying a standard rate of interest to the qualifying\noutlays of expenses.\n  Third, there may be extraordinary circumstances in\nwhich an attorney’s performance involves exceptional\ndelay in the payment of fees. An attorney who expects to\nbe compensated under §1988 presumably understands\nthat payment of fees will generally not come until the end\nof the case, if at all. See 532 F. 3d, at 1227 (opinion of\nCarnes, J.). Compensation for this delay is generally\nmade “either by basing the award on current rates or by\nadjusting the fee based on historical rates to reflect its\npresent value.” Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 U. S. 274, 282\n(1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). But we do not\nrule out the possibility that an enhancement may be ap\npropriate where an attorney assumes these costs in the\nface of unanticipated delay, particularly where the delay is\nunjustifiably caused by the defense. In such a case, how\never, the enhancement should be calculated by applying a\nmethod similar to that described above in connection with\nexceptional delay in obtaining reimbursement for\nexpenses.\n  We reject the suggestion that it is appropriate to grant\nperformance enhancements on the ground that departures\n12                  PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom hourly billing are becoming more common. As we\nhave noted, the lodestar was adopted in part because it\nprovides a rough approximation of general billing prac\ntices, and accordingly, if hourly billing becomes unusual,\nan alternative to the lodestar method may have to be\nfound. However, neither respondents nor their amici\ncontend that that day has arrived. Nor have they shown\nthat permitting the award of enhancements on top of the\nlodestar figure corresponds to prevailing practice in the\ngeneral run of cases.\n   We are told that, under an increasingly popular ar\nrangement, attorneys are paid at a reduced hourly rate\nbut receive a bonus if certain specified results are ob\ntained, and this practice is analogized to the award of an\nenhancement such as the one in this case. Brief for Re\nspondents 55–57. The analogy, however, is flawed. An\nattorney who agrees, at the outset of the representation, to\na reduced hourly rate in exchange for the opportunity to\nearn a performance bonus is in a position far different\nfrom an attorney in a §1988 case who is compensated at\nthe full prevailing rate and then seeks a performance\nenhancement in addition to the lodestar amount after the\nlitigation has concluded. Reliance on these comparisons\nfor the purposes of administering enhancements, there\nfore, is not appropriate.\n                             V\n  In the present case, the District Court did not provide\nproper justification for the large enhancement that it\nawarded. The court increased the lodestar award by 75%\nbut, as far as the court’s opinion reveals, this figure ap\npears to have been essentially arbitrary. Why, for exam\nple, did the court grant a 75% enhancement instead of the\n100% increase that respondents sought? And why 75%\nrather than 50% or 25% or 10%?\n  The District Court commented that the enhancement\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwas the “minimum enhancement of the lodestar necessary\nto reasonably compensate [respondents’] counsel.” 454\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1290. But the effect of the enhancement\nwas to increase the top rate for the attorneys to more than\n$866 per hour,7 and the District Court did not point to\nanything in the record that shows that this is an appro\npriate figure for the relevant market.\n   The District Court pointed to the fact that respondents’\ncounsel had to make extraordinary outlays for expenses\nand had to wait for reimbursement, id., at 1288, but the\ncourt did not calculate the amount of the enhancement\nthat is attributable to this factor. Similarly, the District\nCourt noted that respondents’ counsel did not receive fees\non an ongoing basis while the case was pending, but the\ncourt did not sufficiently link this factor to proof in the\nrecord that the delay here was outside the normal range\nexpected by attorneys who rely on §1988 for the payment\nof their fees or quantify the disparity. Nor did the court\nprovide a calculation of the cost to counsel of any extraor\ndinary and unwarranted delay. And the court’s reliance\non the contingency of the outcome contravenes our holding\nin Dague. See 505 U. S., at 565.\n   Finally, insofar as the District Court relied on a com\nparison of the performance of counsel in this case with the\nperformance of counsel in unnamed prior cases, the Dis\ntrict Court did not employ a methodology that permitted\n——————\n  7 JUSTICE BREYER’s reliance on the average hourly rate for all of re\nspondents’ attorneys is highly misleading. See post, at 10. In calculat\ning the lodestar, the District Court found that the hourly rate for each\nof these attorneys was “eminently fair and reasonable” and “consistent\nwith the prevailing market rates in Atlanta for comparable work.” 454\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1285–1286. JUSTICE BREYER’s calculation of an average\nhourly rate for all attorney hours reflects nothing more than the fact\nthat much of the work was performed by attorneys whose “fair and\nreasonable” market rate was below the market average. There is\nnothing unfair about compensating these attorneys at the very rate that\nthey requested.\n14                    PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nmeaningful appellate review. Needless to say, we do not\nquestion the sincerity of the District Court’s observations,\nand we are in no position to assess their accuracy. But\nwhen a trial judge awards an enhancement on an impres\nsionistic basis, a major purpose of the lodestar method—\nproviding an objective and reviewable basis for fees, see\nid., at 566—is undermined.\n    Determining a “reasonable attorney’s fee” is a matter\nthat is committed to the sound discretion of a trial judge,\nsee 42 U. S. C. §1988 (permitting court, “in its discretion,”\nto award fees), but the judge’s discretion is not unlimited.\nIt is essential that the judge provide a reasonably specific\nexplanation for all aspects of a fee determination, includ\ning any award of an enhancement. Unless such an expla\nnation is given, adequate appellate review is not feasible,\nand without such review, widely disparate awards may be\nmade, and awards may be influenced (or at least, may\nappear to be influenced) by a judge’s subjective opinion\nregarding particular attorneys or the importance of the\ncase. In addition, in future cases, defendants contemplat\ning the possibility of settlement will have no way to esti\nmate the likelihood of having to pay a potentially huge\nenhancement. See Marek v. Chesny, 473 U. S. 1, 7 (1985)\n(“ ‘[M]any a defendant would be unwilling to make a bind\ning settlement offer on terms that left it exposed to liabil\nity for attorney’s fees in whatever amount the court might\nfix on motion of the plaintiff ’ ”).\n    Section 1988 serves an important public purpose by\nmaking it possible for persons without means to bring suit\nto vindicate their rights. But unjustified enhancements\nthat serve only to enrich attorneys are not consistent with\nthe statute’s aim.8 In many cases, attorney’s fees awarded\n——————\n  8 JUSTICE BREYER’s opinion dramatically illustrates the danger of\n\nallowing a trial judge to award a huge enhancement not supported by\nany discernible methodology. That approach would retain the $4.5\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

Instead, the fees are paid in effect by\nstate and local taxpayers, and because state and local\ngovernments have limited budgets, money that is used to\npay attorney’s fees is money that cannot be used for pro\ngrams that provide vital public services.

S. C. §1988 after “achiev[ing] only\nlimited success” litigating their clients’ constitutional\nclaims. Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 431 (1983).\nThis Court’s opinion resolving their claim for fees observed\nthat “in some cases of exceptional success an enhanced\naward” of attorney’s fees under §1988 “may be justified.”\nId., at 435 (emphasis added). That observation plainly\nwas dicta, but one year later this Court relied on it to\nreject the “argument that an ‘upward adjustment’ ” to the\nlodestar calculation “is never permissible.” Blum v. Sten\nson, 465 U. S. 886, 897 (1984). Yet “we have never sus\ntained an enhancement of a lodestar amount for perform\nance,” ante, at 8, and our jurisprudence since Blum has\ncharted “a decisional arc that bends decidedly against\nenhancements,” 532 F. 3d 1209, 1221 (CA11 2008)\n(Carnes, J.).

The Court answers that question in the\naffirmative. See ante, at 1 (“We have stated in previous\ncases that such an increase is permitted in extraordinary\ncircumstances, and we reaffirm that rule”); see also ante,\np. ___ (KENNEDY, J., concurring). As our prior precedents\nmake clear, the lodestar calculation “does not end the [fee]\ninquiry” because there “remain other considerations that\nmay lead the district court to adjust the fee upward.”\nHensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 434 (1983). For that\nreason, “[t]he lodestar method was never intended to be\nconclusive in all circumstances.” Ante, at 9. Instead, as\nthe Court today reaffirms, when “superior attorney per\nformance,” ibid., leads to “exceptional success an enhanced\naward may be justified,” Hensley supra, at 435; see also\nPennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens’ Council for\nClean Air, 478 U. S. 546, 565 (1986); Blum v. Stenson, 465\n2                   PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nU. S. 886, 896–900 (1984). I agree with that conclusion.\n  Where the majority and I part ways is with respect to a\nquestion that is not presented, but that the Court\nobliquely, and in my view inappropriately, appears to\nconsider nonetheless—namely, whether the lower courts\ncorrectly determined in this case that exceptional circum\nstances justify a lodestar enhancement. See Parts IV–V,\nante; see also ante, p. ___ (KENNEDY, J., concurring). I\nwould not reach that issue, which lies beyond the narrow\nquestion that we agreed to consider. See 556 U. S. __\n(2009) (limiting review to the first question presented);\nPet. for Cert. i (stating question); see also Glover v. United\nStates, 531 U. S. 198, 205 (2001) (“As a general rule . . . we\ndo not decide issues outside the questions presented . . .”).\nNor do I believe that this Court, which is twice removed\nfrom the litigation underlying the fee determination, is\nproperly suited to resolve the fact-intensive inquiry that\n42 U. S. C. §1988 demands. But even were I to engage in\nthat inquiry, I would hold that the District Court did not\nabuse its discretion in awarding an enhancement. And\nI would therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.\n\n  As the Court explains, the basic question that must be\nresolved when considering an enhancement to the lodestar\nis whether the lodestar calculation “adequately meas\nure[s]” an attorney’s “value,” as “demonstrated” by his\nperformance “during the litigation.” Ante, at 10. While I\nunderstand the need for answering that question through\nthe application of standards, I also believe that the answer\ninevitably involves an element of judgment. Moreover,\nwhen reviewing a district court’s answer to that question,\nan appellate court must inevitably give weight to the fact\nthat a district court is better situated to provide that\nanswer. For it is the district judge, and only the district\njudge, who will have read all of the motions filed in the\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

In a word, the district judge will have\nobserved the attorney’s true “value, as demonstrated . . .\nduring the litigation.” Ibid. (emphasis added). By con\ntrast, a court of appeals, faced with a cold and perhaps\nlengthy record, will inevitably have less time and oppor\ntunity to determine whether the lawyers have done an\nexceptionally fine job. And this Court is yet less suited to\nperforming that inquiry.         Accordingly, determining\nwhether a fee enhancement is warranted in a given case\n“is a matter that is committed to the sound discretion of a\ntrial judge,” ante, at 13, and the function of appellate\ncourts is to review that judge’s determination for an abuse\nof such discretion. See Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S.\n552, 571 (1988); see also General Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522\nU. S. 136, 143 (1997) (“[D]eference . . . is the hallmark of\nabuse-of-discretion review”).\n   This case well illustrates why our tiered and function\nally specialized judicial system places the task of deter\nmining an attorney’s fee award primarily in the district\ncourt’s hands. The plaintiffs’ lawyers spent eight years\ninvestigating the underlying facts, developing the initial\ncomplaint, conducting court proceedings, and working out\nfinal relief. The District Court’s docket, with over 600\nentries, consists of more than 18,000 pages. Transcripts of\nhearings and depositions, along with other documents,\nhave produced a record that fills 20 large boxes. Neither\nwe, nor an appellate panel, can easily read that entire\nrecord. Nor should we attempt to second-guess a district\njudge who is aware of the many intangible matters that\nthe written page cannot reflect.\n   My own review of this expansive record cannot possibly\nbe exhaustive. But those portions of the record I have\nreviewed lead me to conclude, like the Court of Appeals,\n4                     PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                       Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nthat the District Judge did not abuse his discretion when\nawarding an enhanced fee. I reach this conclusion based\non four considerations.\n   First, the record indicates that the lawyers’ objective in\nthis case was unusually important and fully consistent\nwith the central objectives of the basic federal civil-rights\nstatute, 42 U. S. C. §1983. Moreover, the problem the\nattorneys faced demanded an exceptionally high degree of\nskill and effort. Specifically, these lawyers and their\nclients sought to have the State of Georgia reform its\nentire foster-care system—a system that much in the\nrecord describes as well below the level of minimal consti\ntutional acceptability. The record contains investigative\nreports, mostly prepared by Georgia’s own Office of the\nChild Advocate, which show, for example, the following:\n    •\t The State’s foster-care system was unable to provide\n       essential medical and mental health services; children\n       consequently and unnecessarily suffered illness and\n       life long medical disabilities, such as permanent hear\n       ing loss, due to failures on the part of the State to ad\n       minister basic care and antibiotics. See, e.g., Doc. 3,\n       Exh. 3C, pp. 11–13.\n    •\t Understaffing and improper staffing placed children\n       in the care of individuals with dangerous criminal re\n       cords; children were physically assaulted by the staff,\n       locked outside of the shelters at night as punishment,\n       and abused in other ways. See, e.g., Doc. 50, pp. 32–\n       36, 55; Doc. 3, Exh. 3A, pp. 2–6; Doc. 3, Exh. 2, pp. 4–\n       5; Doc. 52, Exh. 1, pp. 6, 12–15, 34.\n    •\t The shelters themselves were “unsanitary and dilapi\n       dated,” “unclean,” infested with rats, “overcrowded,”\n       unsafe, and “ ‘out of control.’ ” See, e.g., Doc. 3, Exh.\n       3A, at 1–2; Doc. 3, Exh. 3B, p. 2; Doc. 50, at 29.\n    •\t Due to improper supervision and other deficiencies at\n       the shelters, 20% of the children abused drugs; some\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

See, e.g., Doc.\n     50, at 27–28, 54; Doc. 52, Exh. 18, p. 4 (under seal) (at\n     least 25% of children run away from shelters); Doc.\n     52, Exh. 18E, pp. 1–11, 18–19 (under seal) (daily logs);\n     see also Doc. 50, Exh. 1, at 37, 54 (describing suicide\n     attempts) (all docket entries above and hereinafter re\n     fer to No. 1:02–cv–1686 (ND Ga.)

But the State did not grant the Child\nAdvocate’s office the litigating authority she sought. See\n2000 Ga. Laws p. 245, as codified, Ga. Code Ann. §15–11–\n173 (2008).\n   The upshot is that the plaintiffs’ attorneys did what the\nchild advocate could not do: They initiated this lawsuit.\nThey thereby assumed the role of “a ‘private attorney\ngeneral’ ” by filling an enforcement void in the State’s own\nlegal system, a function “that Congress considered of the\nhighest priority,” Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc.,\n390 U. S. 400, 402 (1968) (per curiam), and “meant to\npromote in enacting §1988,” Texas State Teachers Assn. v.\nGarland Independent School Dist., 489 U. S. 782, 793\n(1989).\n   Second, the course of the lawsuit was lengthy and ardu\nous. The plaintiffs and their lawyers began with factual\ninvestigations beyond those which the child advocate had\nalready conducted. See, e.g., Record, Docs. 50–52 (par\ntially under seal). They then filed suit. And the State met\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nthe plaintiffs’ efforts with a host of complex procedural, as\nwell as substantive, objections. The State, for example,\nargued that the law forbade the plaintiffs to investigate\nthe shelters; on the eve of a state-court decision that might\nhave approved the investigations, the State then removed\nthe case to federal court; the State then sought protective\norders preventing the attorneys from speaking to the\nshelters’ staff; and, after losing its motions, the State\ndelayed to the point where the District Court “was forced\nto admonish [the] State Defendants for ‘relying on techni\ncal legal objections to discovery requests in order to delay\nand hinder the discovery process.’ ” 454 F. Supp. 2d. 1260,\n1268 (ND Ga. 2006) (quoting Record, Doc. 145, p. 4). See\nalso Doc. 1; Doc. 3, pp. 9–10; Docs. 26, 28–29, 44, 60.\n  In the meantime, the State moved for dismissal, basing\nthe motion on complex legal doctrines such as Younger\nabstention and the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, which the\nDistrict Court found inapplicable. 218 F. R. D. 277, 284–\n290 (ND Ga. 2003). See Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37\n(1971); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413 (1923),\nand District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460\nU. S. 462 (1983). The State also opposed the petitioners’\nrequest to certify a class of the 3,000 children in foster\ncare, but the District Court again rejected the State’s\nargument. 218 F. R. D., at 299–302. And, after that, the\nState filed a lengthy motion for summary judgment, Re\ncord, Docs. 243–245, which plaintiffs’ attorneys opposed in\nthorough briefing supported by comprehensive exhibits,\nsee Docs. 254–258, 260. After losing that motion and\neventually agreeing to mediation, the State forced pro\ntracted litigation as to who should be the mediator. See\nDocs. 363–364, 366, 369–370, 373, 376, 380. All told, in\nopposing the plaintiffs’ efforts to have the foster-care\nsystem reformed, the State spent $2.4 million on outside\ncounsel (who, because they charge the State reduced rates,\nworked significantly more hours than that figure alone\n8                   PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nindicates) and tapped its own law department for an addi\ntional 5,200 hours of work. 454 F. Supp. 2d, at 1287.\n   Third, in the face of this opposition, the results obtained\nby the plaintiffs’ attorneys appear to have been excep\ntional. The 47-page consent decree negotiated over the\ncourse of the mediation sets forth 31 specific steps that the\nState will take in order to address the specific deficiencies\nof the sort that I described above. See id., at 1289; see\nalso App. 92–207 (consent decree). And it establishes a\nreporting and oversight mechanism that is backed up by\nthe District Court’s enforcement authority. See 454\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1289. As a result of the decree, the State\nagreed to comprehensive reforms of its foster-care system,\nto the benefit of children in many different communities.\nAnd informed observers have described the decree as\nhaving brought about significant positive results. See,\ne.g., Record, Doc. 632, p. 4 (most recent court-appointed\noverseers’ report) (“The State’s overall performance . . .\ncontinues the trend of steady improvement . . .”); id., at 4–\n10 (detailing substantial health, safety, and welfare im\nprovements); see also, Office of the Child Advocate Ann.\nReport (2008), Letter from Tom C.

Supp. 2d, at 1282;\n 2. “based on its personal observation of plaintiffs’ coun\n    sel’s performance throughout this litigation, the Court\n    finds that . . . counsel brought a higher degree of skill,\n    commitment, dedication, and professionalism to this\n    litigation than the Court has seen displayed by the at\n    torneys in any other case during its 27 years on the\n    bench,” id., at 1288–1290;\n 3. the Consent Decree “provided extraordinary benefits\n    to the plaintiff class . . . .” Id., at 1282. “[T]he settle\n    ment achieved by plaintiffs’ counsel is comprehensive\n    in its scope and detailed in its coverage. . . . After 58\n    years as a practicing attorney and federal judge, the\n    Court is unaware of any other case in which a plaintiff\n    class has achieved such a favorable result on such a\n    comprehensive scale,” id., at 1289–1290.\nBased on these observations and on its assessment of the\nattorneys’ performance during the course of the litigation,\nthe District Court concluded that “the evidence establishes\nthat the quality of service rendered by class counsel . . .\nwas far superior to what consumers of legal services in the\nlegal marketplace . . . could reasonably expect to receive\nfor the rates used in the lodestar calculation.” Id., at\n1288.\n  On the basis of what I have read, I believe that assess\nment was correct. I recognize that the ordinary lodestar\ncalculation yields a large fee award. But by my assess\n10                  PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nment, the lodestar calculation in this case translates to an\naverage hourly fee per attorney of $249. See id., at 1287\n(lodestar calculation and attorney hours). (The majority’s\nreference to an hourly fee of $866, ante, at 12, refers to the\nrate associated with the single highest paid of the 17\nattorneys under the enhanced fee, not the average hourly\nrate under the lodestar. The lay reader should also bear\nin mind that a lawyer’s “fee” is substantially greater than\nhis “profit,” given that attorneys must sometimes cover\ncase-specific costs (which in this case exceeded $800,000,\nsee 454 F. Supp. 2d, at 1291) and also must cover routine\noverhead expenses, which typically consume 40% of their\nfees, see Altman Weil Publications, Inc., Survey of Law\nFirm Economics 30 (2007 ed.)).\n   At $249 per hour, the lodestar would compensate this\ngroup of attorneys—whom the District Court described as\nextraordinary—at a rate lower than the average rate\ncharged by attorneys practicing law in the State of Geor\ngia, where the average hourly rate is $268. See id., at 89.\nAccordingly, even the majority would seem to acknowledge\nthat some form of an enhancement is appropriate in this\ncase. See ante, at 10 (“[A]n enhancement may be appro\npriate where the method used in determining the hourly\nrate employed in the lodestar calculation does not ade\nquately measure the attorney’s true market value, as\ndemonstrated in part during the litigation”). Indeed, the\nfact that these exceptional results were achieved in a case\nwhere “much of the work,” ante, at 13, n. 7, was performed\nby relatively inexperienced attorneys (who, accordingly,\nwould be compensated by the lodestar “below the market\naverage,” ibid.) is all the more reason to think that their\nservice rendered their outstanding performance worthy of\nan enhancement. By comparison, the District Court’s\nenhanced award—a special one-time adjustment unique to\nthis exceptional case—would compensate these attorneys,\non this one occasion, at an average hourly rate of $435,\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nwhich is comparable to the rates charged by the Nation’s\nleading law firms on average on every occasion. See Firm\nby-Firm Sampling of Billing Rates Nationwide, National\nLaw Journal, Dec. 11, 2006, p. S2 (listing 13 firms at\nwhich average hourly rate is between $400 and $510); J.\nBarnett, Certification Drag: The Opinion Puzzle and\nOther Transactional Curiosities, 33 Iowa J. Corp. L. 95,\n110, n. 58 (2007) (“These numbers are probably an under\nestimate given that many of the highest-billing national\nlaw firms decline to take part in the National Law Journal\nSurvey”). Thus, it would appear that the enhanced award\nis wholly consistent with the purpose of §1988, which was\nenacted to ensure that “counsel for prevailing parties [are]\npaid as is traditional with attorneys compensated by a fee\npaying client.” S. Rep. No. 94–1011, p. 6 (1976); see H. R.\nRep. No. 94–1558, p. 9 (1976) (“[C]ivil rights plaintiffs\nshould not be singled out for different and less favorable\ntreatment”); see also Blum, 465 U. S., at 893, 897.\n   In any event, the circumstances I have listed likely\nmake this a “rare” or “exceptional” case warranting an\nenhanced fee award. And they certainly make clear that it\nwas neither unreasonable nor an abuse of discretion for\nthe District Court to reach that conclusion. Indeed, if the\nfacts and circumstances that I have described are even\nroughly correct, then it is fair to ask: If this is not an\nexceptional case, what is?\n                       *     *     *\n  My disagreement with the Court is limited. As I stated\nat the outset, we are in complete agreement with respect\nto the answer to the question presented: “[A]n increase” to\nthe lodestar “due to superior performance and results” “is\npermitted in extraordinary circumstances.” Ante, at 1.\nUnlike JUSTICE THOMAS, I do not read the Court’s opinion\nto “advance our attorney’s fees jurisprudence further along\nthe decisional arc” toward a point where enhancements\n12                  PERDUE v. KENNY A.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nare “virtually” barred in all cases. Ante, at 2 (concurring\nopinion). Our prior cases make clear that enhancements\nare permitted in “ ‘exceptional’ cases,” Delaware Valley,\n478 U. S., at 565, where the attorney achieves “exceptional\nsuccess,” Hensley, 461 U. S., at 435; see also Blum, 465\nU. S., at 896–901. By definition, such exceptional circum\nstances occur only rarely. See ante, p. ___ (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring). I do not see how the Court could “advance”\nour fee enhancement jurisprudence so as to further dis\ncourage lodestar enhancements without overruling the\nprecedents I have just cited, which the Court has not done.\nTo the contrary, today the Court “reaffirm[s]” those prece\ndents, which allow enhancements for exceptional perform\nance. Ante, at 1. And with respect to that central holding\nwe are unanimous.\n   Nor is my disagreement with the Court absolute with\nrespect to the proper resolution of the case before us, for\nthe Court does not purport to prohibit the District Court\nfrom awarding an enhanced fee on remand if that court\nprovides more detailed reasoning supporting its decision.\nAnte, at 12; cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 47. But the majority and I\ndo disagree in this respect: I would not disturb the judg\nment below. “A request for attorney’s fees should not\nresult in a second major litigation.” Hensley, 461 U. S., at\n437. Nor should it lead to years of protracted appellate\nreview. See id., at 455–456 (Brennan, J., concurring in\npart and dissenting in part). We did not grant certiorari\nin this case to consider the fact-intensive dispute over\nwhether this is, in fact, an exceptional case that merits a\nlodestar enhancement. The District Court has already\nresolved that question and the Court of Appeals affirmed\nits judgment, having found no abuse of discretion. I would\nhave been content to resolve no more than the question\npresented. But, even were I to follow the Court’s inclina\ntion to say more, I would hold that the principles upon\nwhich we agree—including the applicability of abuse-of\n                 Cite as: 559 U.
