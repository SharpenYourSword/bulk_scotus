Argued January 20, 2010—Decided April 21, 2010\nPetitioners are Xerox Corporation’s pension plan (Plan) and the Plan’s\n  current and former administrators (Plan Administrator). Respon\n  dents are employees who left Xerox in the 1980’s, received lump-sum\n  distributions of retirement benefits earned up to that point, and were\n  later rehired. To account for the past distributions when calculating\n  respondents’ current benefits, the Plan Administrator initially inter\n  preted the Plan to call for an approach that has come to be known as\n  the “phantom account” method. Respondents challenged that method\n  in an action under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of\n  1974 (ERISA). The District Court granted summary judgment for\n  the Plan, but the Second Circuit vacated and remanded. It held that\n  the Plan Administrator’s interpretation was unreasonable and that\n  respondents had not received adequate notice that the phantom ac\n  count method would be used to calculate their benefits. On remand,\n  the Plan Administrator proposed a new interpretation of the Plan\n  that accounted for the time value of the money respondents had pre\n  viously received. The District Court declined to apply a deferential\n  standard to this interpretation, and adopted instead an approach\n  proposed by respondents that did not account for the time value of\n  money. Affirming in relevant part, the Second Circuit held that the\n  District Court was correct not to apply a deferential standard on re\n  mand, and that the District Court’s decision on the merits was not an\n  abuse of discretion.\nHeld: The District Court should have applied a deferential standard of\n review to the Plan Administrator’s interpretation of the Plan on re\n mand. Pp. 4–15.\n    (a) This Court addressed the standard for reviewing the decisions\n of ERISA plan administrators in Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v.\n2                      CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Bruch, 489 U. S. 101. Firestone looked to “principles of trust law” for\n    guidance. Id., at 111. Under trust law, the appropriate standard de\n    pends on the language of the instrument creating the trust. When a\n    trust instrument gives the trustee “power to construe disputed or\n    doubtful terms, . . . the trustee’s interpretation will not be disturbed\n    if reasonable.” Ibid. Under Firestone and the Plan’s terms, the Plan\n    Administrator here would normally be entitled to deference when in\n    terpreting the Plan. The Court of Appeals, however, crafted an ex\n    ception to Firestone deference, holding that a court need not apply a\n    deferential standard when a plan administrator’s previous construc\n    tion of the same plan terms was found to violate ERISA. Pp. 4–5.\n       (b) The Second Circuit’s “one-strike-and-you’re-out” approach has\n    no basis in Firestone, which set out a broad standard of deference\n    with no suggestion that it was susceptible to ad hoc exceptions. This\n    Court held in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn, 554 U. S. ___, ___,\n    that a plan administrator operating under a systemic conflict of in\n    terest is nonetheless still entitled to deferential review. In light of\n    that ruling, it is difficult to see why a single honest mistake should\n    require a different result. Nor is the Second Circuit’s decision sup\n    ported by the considerations on which Firestone and Glenn were\n    based—the plan’s terms, trust law principles, and ERISA’s purposes.\n    The Plan grants the Plan Administrator general interpretive author\n    ity without suggesting that the authority is limited to first efforts to\n    construe the Plan. An exception to Firestone deference is also not re\n    quired by trust law principles, which serve as a guide under ERISA\n    but do not “tell the entire story.” Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U. S. 489,\n    497. Trust law does not resolve the specific question whether courts\n    may strip a plan administrator of Firestone deference after one good\n    faith mistake, but the guiding principles underlying ERISA do.\n       ERISA represents a “ ‘careful balancing’ between ensuring fair and\n    prompt enforcement of rights under a plan and the encouragement of\n    the creation of such plans.” Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, 542 U. S.\n    200, 215. Firestone deference preserves this “careful balancing” and\n    protects the statute’s interests in efficiency, predictability, and uni\n    formity. Respondents claim that deference is less important once a\n    plan administrator’s interpretation has been found unreasonable, but\n    the interests in efficiency, predictability, and uniformity do not sud\n    denly disappear simply because of a single honest mistake, as illus\n    trated by this case. When the District Court declined to apply a def\n    erential standard of review on remand, the court made the case more\n    complicated than necessary. Respondents’ approach threatens to in\n    terject additional issues into ERISA litigation that “would create fur\n    ther complexity, adding time and expense to a process that may al\n    ready be too costly for many [seeking] redress.” Glenn, supra, at ___.\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  This case also demonstrates the harm to predictability and uniform\n  ity that would result from stripping a plan administrator of Firestone\n  deference. The District Court’s interpretation does not account for\n  the time value of money, but respondents’ own actuarial expert testi\n  fied that fairness required recognizing that principle. Respondents\n  do not dispute that the District Court’s approach would place them in\n  a better position than employees who never left the company. If\n  other courts construed the Plan to account for the time value of\n  money, moreover, Xerox could be placed in an impossible situation in\n  which the Plan is subject to different interpretations and obligations\n  in different States. Pp. 5–13.\n     (c) Respondents claim that plan administrators will adopt unrea\n  sonable interpretations of their plans seriatim, receiving deference\n  each time, thereby undermining the prompt resolution of benefit dis\n  putes, driving up litigation costs, and discouraging employees from\n  challenging administrators’ decisions. These concerns are overblown\n  because there is no reason to think that deference would be required\n  in the extreme circumstances that respondents foresee. Multiple er\n  roneous interpretations of the same plan provision, even if issued in\n  good faith, could support a finding that a plan administrator is too\n  incompetent to exercise his discretion fairly, cutting short the rounds\n  of costly litigation that respondents fear. Applying a deferential\n  standard of review also does not mean that the plan administrator\n  will always prevail on the merits. It means only that the plan admin\n  istrator’s interpretation “will not be disturbed if reasonable.” Fire\n  stone, 489 U. S., at 111.

Even administrators of ERISA\nplans. That should come as no surprise, given that the\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is “an\nenormously complex and detailed statute,” Mertens v.\nHewitt Associates, 508 U. S. 248, 262 (1993), and the plans\nthat administrators must construe can be lengthy and\ncomplicated. (The one at issue here runs to 81 pages, with\n139 sections.) We held in Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v.\nBruch, 489 U. S. 101 (1989), that an ERISA plan adminis\ntrator with discretionary authority to interpret a plan is\nentitled to deference in exercising that discretion. The\nquestion here is whether a single honest mistake in plan\ninterpretation justifies stripping the administrator of that\ndeference for subsequent related interpretations of the\nplan. We hold that it does not.\n                             I\n  As in many ERISA matters, the facts of this case are\nexceedingly complicated. Fortunately, most of the factual\ndetails are unnecessary to the legal issues before us, so we\n2                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncover them only in broad strokes. This case concerns\nXerox Corporation’s pension plan, which is covered by\nERISA, 88 Stat. 829, as amended, 29 U. S. C. §1001 et seq.\nPetitioners are the plan itself (hereinafter Plan), and the\nPlan’s current and former administrators (hereinafter\nPlan Administrator). See §1002(16)(A)(i); App. 32a. Re\nspondents are Xerox employees who left the company in\nthe 1980’s, received lump-sum distributions of retirement\nbenefits they had earned up to that point, and were later\nrehired.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 424 (WDNY 2004); Brief\nfor Respondents 9–10. The dispute giving rise to this case\nconcerns how to account for respondents’ past distribu\ntions when calculating their current benefits—that is, how\nto avoid paying respondents the same benefits twice.\n   The Plan Administrator initially interpreted the Plan to\ncall for an approach that has come to be known as the\n“phantom account” method. 328 F. Supp. 2d, at 424.\nEssentially, that method calculated the hypothetical\ngrowth that respondents’ past distributions would have\nexperienced if the money had remained in Xerox’s invest\nment funds, and reduced respondents’ present benefits\naccordingly. See id., at 426–428; App. to Pet. for Cert.\n146a. After the Plan Administrator denied respondents’\nadministrative challenges to that method, respondents\nfiled suit in federal court under ERISA, 29 U. S. C.\n§1132(a)(1)(B). See 328 F. Supp. 2d, at 428–429. The\nDistrict Court granted summary judgment for the Plan,\napplying a deferential standard of review to the Plan\nAdministrator’s interpretation. See id., at 430–431, 439.\nThe Second Circuit vacated and remanded, holding that\nthe Plan Administrator’s interpretation was unreasonable\nand that respondents had not been adequately notified\nthat the phantom account method would be used to calcu\nlate their benefits. See 433 F. 3d 254, 257, 265–269\n(2006).\n   The phantom account method having been exorcised\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom the Plan, the District Court on remand considered\nother approaches for adjusting respondents’ present bene\nfits in light of their past distributions. See 472 F. Supp.\n2d 452, 456–458 (WDNY 2007). The Plan Administrator\nsubmitted an affidavit proposing an approach that, like\nthe phantom account method, accounted for the time value\nof the money that respondents had previously received.\nBut unlike the phantom account method, the Plan Admin\nistrator’s new approach did not calculate the present value\nof a past distribution based on events that occurred after\nthe distribution was made. Instead, the new approach\nused an interest rate that was fixed at the time of the\ndistribution, thereby calculating the current value of the\ndistribution based on information that was known at the\ntime of the distribution. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 147a–\n153a. Petitioners argued that the District Court should\napply a deferential standard of review to this approach,\nand accept it as a reasonable interpretation of the Plan.\nSee Defendants’ Pre-Hearing Brief Addressed to Remedies\nin No. 00–CV–6311 (WDNY), pp. 7–8; Defendants’ Pre-\nHearing Reply Brief Addressing Remedies in No. 00–CV–\n6311 (WDNY), p. 2.\n   The District Court did not apply a deferential standard\nof review. Nor did it accept the Plan Administrator’s\ninterpretation. Instead, after finding the Plan to be am\nbiguous, the District Court adopted an approach proposed\nby respondents that did not account for the time value of\nmoney. Under that approach, respondents’ present bene\nfits were reduced only by the nominal amount of their past\ndistributions—thereby treating a dollar distributed to\nrespondents in the 1980’s as equal in value to a dollar\ndistributed today. See 472 F. Supp. 2d, at 457–458. The\nSecond Circuit affirmed in relevant part, holding that the\nDistrict Court was correct not to apply a deferential stan\ndard on remand, and that the District Court’s decision on\nthe merits was not an abuse of discretion. See 535 F. 3d\n4                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n111, 119 (2008).\n   Petitioners asked us to grant certiorari on two ques\ntions: (1) whether the District Court owed deference to the\nPlan Administrator’s interpretation of the Plan on re\nmand, and (2) whether the Court of Appeals properly\ngranted deference to the District Court on the merits. Pet.\nfor Cert. i. We granted certiorari on both, 557 U. S. ___\n(2009), but find it necessary to decide only the first.\n                              II\n                               A\n   This Court addressed the standard for reviewing the\ndecisions of ERISA plan administrators in Firestone, 489\nU. S. 101. Because ERISA’s text does not directly resolve\nthe matter, we looked to “principles of trust law” for guid\nance. Id., at 109, 111. We recognized that, under trust\nlaw, the proper standard of review of a trustee’s decision\ndepends on the language of the instrument creating the\ntrust. See id., at 111–112. If the trust documents give the\ntrustee “power to construe disputed or doubtful terms, . . .\nthe trustee’s interpretation will not be disturbed if reason\nable.” Id., at 111. Based on these considerations, we held\nthat “a denial of benefits challenged under §1132(a)(1)(B)\nis to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the\nbenefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discre\ntionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to\nconstrue the terms of the plan.” Id., at 115.\n   We expanded Firestone’s approach in Metropolitan Life\nIns. Co. v. Glenn, 554 U. S. ___ (2008). In determining the\nproper standard of review when a plan administrator\noperates under a conflict of interest, we again looked to\ntrust law, the terms of the plan at issue, and the principles\nof ERISA—plus, of course, our precedent in Firestone. See\n554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4, 6–7, 9–10). We held that,\nwhen the terms of a plan grant discretionary authority to\nthe plan administrator, a deferential standard of review\n                   Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)               5\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nremains appropriate even in the face of a conflict. See id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 9).\n  It is undisputed that, under Firestone and the terms of\nthe Plan, the Plan Administrator here would normally be\nentitled to deference when interpreting the Plan. See 328\nF. Supp. 2d, at 430–431 (observing that the Plan grants\nthe Plan Administrator “broad discretion in making deci\nsions relative to the Plan”). The Court of Appeals, how\never, crafted an exception to Firestone deference. Specifi\ncally, the Second Circuit held that a court need not apply a\ndeferential standard “where the administrator ha[s] previ\nously construed the same [plan] terms and we found such\na construction to have violated ERISA.” 535 F. 3d, at 119.\nUnder that view, the District Court here was entitled to\nreject a reasonable interpretation of the Plan offered by\nthe Plan Administrator, solely because the Court of Ap\npeals had overturned a previous interpretation by\nthe Administrator.       Cf. ibid. (accepting the District\nCourt’s chosen method as one of “several reasonable\nalternatives”).\n                               B\n  We reject this “one-strike-and-you’re-out” approach.\nBrief for Petitioners 51. As an initial matter, it has no\nbasis in the Court’s holding in Firestone, which set out a\nbroad standard of deference without any suggestion that\nthe standard was susceptible to ad hoc exceptions like the\none adopted by the Court of Appeals. See 489 U. S., at\n111, 115. Indeed, we refused to create such an exception\nto Firestone deference in Glenn, recognizing that ERISA\nlaw was already complicated enough without adding\n“special procedural or evidentiary rules” to the mix. 554\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). If, as we held in Glenn, a\nsystemic conflict of interest does not strip a plan adminis\ntrator of deference, see id., at ___ (slip op., at 9), it is diffi\ncult to see why a single honest mistake would require a\n6                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndifferent result.\n  Nor is the Court of Appeals’ decision supported by the\nconsiderations on which our holdings in Firestone and\nGlenn were based—namely, the terms of the plan, princi\nples of trust law, and the purposes of ERISA. See supra,\nat 4–5. First, the Plan here grants the Plan Administrator\ngeneral authority to “[c]onstrue the Plan.” App. to Pet. for\nCert. 141a–142a. Nothing in that provision suggests that\nthe grant of authority is limited to first efforts to construe\nthe Plan.\n  Second, the Court of Appeals’ exception to Firestone\ndeference is not required by principles of trust law. Trust\nlaw is unclear on the narrow question before us. A leading\ntreatise states that a court will strip a trustee of his dis\ncretion when there is reason to believe that he will not\nexercise that discretion fairly—for example, upon a show\ning that the trustee has already acted in bad faith:\n    “If the trustee’s failure to pay a reasonable amount [to\n    the beneficiary of the trust] is due to a failure to exer\n    cise [the trustee’s] discretion honestly and fairly, the\n    court may well fix the amount [to be paid] itself. On\n    the other hand, if the trustee’s failure to provide rea\n    sonably for the beneficiary is due to a mistake as to\n    the trustee’s duties or powers, and there is no reason\n    to believe the trustee will not fairly exercise the dis\n    cretion once the court has determined the extent of\n    the trustee’s duties and powers, the court ordinarily\n    will not fix the amount but will instead direct the\n    trustee to make reasonable provision for the benefici\n    ary’s support.” 3 A. Scott, W. Fratcher, & M. Ascher,\n    Scott and Ascher on Trusts §18.2.1, pp. 1348–1349\n    (5th ed. 2007) (hereinafter Scott and Ascher) (footnote\n    omitted) (citing cases).\nThis is not surprising—if the settlor who creates a trust\ngrants discretion to the trustee, it seems doubtful that the\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

Another treatise states that, after a\ntrustee has abused his discretion, “[s]ometimes the court\ndecides for the trustee how he should act, either by stating\nthe exact result it desires to achieve, or by fixing some\nlimits on the trustee’s action and giving him leeway within\nthose limits.” G. Bogert & G. Bogert, Law of Trusts and\nTrustees §560, p. 223 (2d rev. ed. 1980).\n  The unclear state of trust law on the question was per\nhaps best captured by the Texas Supreme Court:\n    “There is authority for ordering a dismissal of the case\n    to afford the trustee an opportunity to exercise a rea\n    sonable discretion in arriving at the amount of pay\n    ments to be made in the light of our discussion of the\n    problem and after a proper consideration of the many\n    factors involved.

W. 2d 4, 11 (1957)\n    (citations omitted).\n  While we are “guided by principles of trust law” in\nERISA cases, Firestone, 489 U. S., at 111, we have recog\nnized before that “trust law does not tell the entire story,”\nVarity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U. S. 489, 497 (1996); see ibid.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(“In some instances, trust law will offer only a starting\npoint, after which courts must go on to ask whether, or to\nwhat extent, the language of the statute, its structure, or\nits purposes require departing from common-law trust\nrequirements”); Brief for Respondents 50 (pressing same\nview as the dissent but concluding that the dispute over\ntrust law “need not be resolved”). Here trust law does not\nresolve the specific issue before us, but the guiding princi\nples we have identified underlying ERISA do.\n   Congress enacted ERISA to ensure that employees\nwould receive the benefits they had earned, but Congress\ndid not require employers to establish benefit plans in the\nfirst place. Lockheed Corp. v. Spink, 517 U. S. 882, 887\n(1996). We have therefore recognized that ERISA repre\nsents a “ ‘careful balancing’ between ensuring fair and\nprompt enforcement of rights under a plan and the en\ncouragement of the creation of such plans.” Aetna Health\nInc. v. Davila, 542 U. S. 200, 215 (2004) (quoting Pilot Life\nIns. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 54 (1987)). Congress\nsought “to create a system that is [not] so complex that\nadministrative costs, or litigation expenses, unduly dis\ncourage employers from offering [ERISA] plans in the first\nplace.” Varity Corp., supra, at 497. ERISA “induc[es]\nemployers to offer benefits by assuring a predictable set of\nliabilities, under uniform standards of primary conduct\nand a uniform regime of ultimate remedial orders and\nawards when a violation has occurred.” Rush Prudential\nHMO, Inc. v. Moran, 536 U. S. 355, 379 (2002).\n   Firestone deference protects these interests and, by\npermitting an employer to grant primary interpretive\nauthority over an ERISA plan to the plan administrator,\npreserves the “careful balancing” on which ERISA is\nbased. Deference promotes efficiency by encouraging\nresolution of benefits disputes through internal adminis\ntrative proceedings rather than costly litigation. It also\npromotes predictability, as an employer can rely on the\n10               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nexpertise of the plan administrator rather than worry\nabout unexpected and inaccurate plan interpretations that\nmight result from de novo judicial review. Moreover,\nFirestone deference serves the interest of uniformity,\nhelping to avoid a patchwork of different interpretations of\na plan, like the one here, that covers employees in differ\nent jurisdictions—a result that “would introduce consider\nable inefficiencies in benefit program operation, which\nmight lead those employers with existing plans to reduce\nbenefits, and those without such plans to refrain from\nadopting them.” Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482\nU. S. 1, 11 (1987). Indeed, a group of prominent actuaries\ntells us that it is impossible even to determine whether an\nERISA plan is solvent (a duty imposed on actuaries by\nfederal law, see 29 U. S. C. §§1023(a)(4), (d)) if the plan is\ninterpreted to mean different things in different places.\nSee Brief for Chief Actuaries as Amici Curiae 5–11.\n   Respondents and the United States as amicus curiae do\nnot question that deference to plan administrators serves\nthese important purposes. Rather, they argue that defer\nence is less important once a plan administrator has is\nsued an interpretation of a plan found to be unreasonable.\nBut the interests in efficiency, predictability, and uniform\nity—and the manner in which they are promoted by defer\nence to reasonable plan construction by administrators—\ndo not suddenly disappear simply because a plan adminis\ntrator has made a single honest mistake.\n   This case illustrates the point. Consider first the inter\nest in efficiency, an interest that Xerox has pursued by\ngranting the Plan Administrator authority to construe the\nPlan. On remand from the Court of Appeals, if the Dis\ntrict Court had applied a deferential standard of review\nunder Firestone, the question before it would have been\nwhether the Plan Administrator’s interpretation of the\nPlan was reasonable. After answering that question, the\ncase might well have been over. Instead, the District\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt declined to defer, and therefore had to answer the\nmore complicated question of how best to interpret the\nPlan.\n   The prospect of increased litigation costs inherent in\nrespondents’ approach does not end there. Under respon\ndents’ and the Government’s view, the question whether a\ndeferential standard of review was required in this case\nturns on whether the Plan Administrator was interpreting\nthe “same terms” or deciding the “same issue” on remand.\nSee Brief for Respondents 43, 46–48, 53, and n. 13; Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 13–15, 23. Whether\nthat condition is satisfied will not always be clear. Indeed,\npetitioners dispute that question here, arguing that the\nPlan Administrator confronted an entirely new issue on\nremand—how to interpret the Plan, knowing that specific\nprovisions requiring use of the phantom account method\ncould not be applied to respondents due to a lack of notice.\nSee Brief for Petitioners 50–51. Respondents would force\nthe parties to litigate this potentially complicated “same\nissue” or “same terms” question before a district court\ncould even decide whether deference is owed to a plan\nadministrator’s view. As we recognized in Glenn, there is\nlittle place in the ERISA context for these sorts of “special\nprocedural rules [that] would create further complexity,\nadding time and expense to a process that may already be\ntoo costly for many of those who seek redress.” 554 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 10).\n   The position of respondents and the Government could\ninterject other additional issues into ERISA litigation. For\nexample, even under their view, the District Court here\ncould have granted deference to the Plan Administrator;\nthe court merely was not required to do so. See Brief for\nRespondents 43, 49–50, 52–53; Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 23–24. That raises the question of how a\ncourt is to decide between the two options; respondents’\nanswer is to weigh an indeterminate number of factors,\n12               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich would only further complicate ERISA proceedings.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 34, 40–45.\n  This case also demonstrates the harm to the interest in\npredictability that would result from stripping a plan\nadministrator of Firestone deference. After declining to\napply a deferential standard here, the District Court\nadopted an interpretation of the Plan that does not ac\ncount for the time value of money. 472 F. Supp. 2d, at\n458; 535 F. 3d, at 119. In the actuarial world, this is\nheresy, and highly unforeseeable. Indeed, the actuaries\ntell us that they have never encountered an ERISA plan\nresembling this one that did not include some adjustment\nfor the time value of money. Brief for Chief Actuaries as\nAmici Curiae 12.\n  Respondents’ own actuarial expert testified before the\nDistrict Court that fairness would require recognizing the\ntime value of money in some fashion. See App. 127a,\n130a. And respondents and the Government do not dis\npute that the District Court’s approach, which does not\naccount for the fact that respondents were able to use\ntheir past distributions as they saw fit for over 20 years,\nwould place respondents in a better position than employ\nees who never left the company. Cf. Brief for Respondents\n42–43; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 32–33.\nDeference to plan administrators, who have a duty to all\nbeneficiaries to preserve limited plan assets, see Varity\nCorp., 516 U. S., at 514, helps prevent such windfalls for\nparticular employees.\n  Finally, this case demonstrates the uniformity problems\nthat arise from creating ad hoc exceptions to Firestone\ndeference. If other courts were to adopt an interpretation\nof the Plan that does account for the time value of money,\nXerox could be placed in an impossible situation. Similar\nXerox employees could be entitled to different benefits\ndepending on where they live, or perhaps where they bring\na legal action. Cf. 29 U. S. C. §1132(e)(2) (permitting suit\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“where the plan is administered, where the breach took\nplace, or where a defendant resides or may be found”). In\nfact, that may already be the case. In similar litigation\nover the Plan, the Ninth Circuit also rejected the use of\nthe phantom account method, but held that the Plan\nAdministrator should utilize actuarial principles in ac\ncounting for rehired employees’ past distributions—which\nwould presumably include taking some cognizance of the\ntime value of money. See Miller v. Xerox Corp. Retirement\nIncome Guarantee Plan, 464 F. 3d 871, 875–876 (2006);\nBrief for ERISA Industry Committee and American Bene\nfits Council as Amici Curiae 8–9. Thus, failing to defer to\nthe Plan Administrator here could well cause the Plan to\nbe subject to different interpretations in California and\nNew York. “Uniformity is impossible, however, if plans\nare subject to different legal obligations in different\nStates.” Egelhoff v. Egelhoff, 532 U. S. 141, 148 (2001).\nFirestone deference serves to avoid that result and to\npreserve the “careful balancing” of interests that ERISA\nrepresents. Pilot Life Ins. Co., 481 U. S., at 54.\n                               C\n   In spite of all this, respondents and the Government\nargue that requiring the District Court to apply Firestone\ndeference in this case would actually disserve the purposes\nof ERISA. They argue that continued deference would\nencourage plan administrators to adopt unreasonable\ninterpretations of plans in the first instance, as adminis\ntrators would anticipate a second chance to interpret their\nplans if their first interpretations were rejected. And they\nargue that plan administrators would be able to proceed\nseriatim through several interpretations of their plans,\neach time receiving deference, thereby undermining the\nprompt resolution of disputes over benefits, driving up\nlitigation costs, and discouraging employees from chal\nlenging the decisions of plan administrators at all.\n14               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   All this is overblown. There is no reason to think that\ndeference would be required in the extreme circumstances\nthat respondents foresee. Under trust law, a trustee may\nbe stripped of deference when he does not exercise his\ndiscretion “honestly and fairly.” 3 Scott and Ascher 1348.\nMultiple erroneous interpretations of the same plan provi\nsion, even if issued in good faith, might well support a\nfinding that a plan administrator is too incompetent to\nexercise his discretion fairly, cutting short the rounds of\ncostly litigation that respondents fear.\n   Applying a deferential standard of review does not mean\nthat the plan administrator will prevail on the merits. It\nmeans only that the plan administrator’s interpretation of\nthe plan “will not be disturbed if reasonable.” Firestone,\n489 U. S., at 111; see also ibid. (“ ‘Where discretion is\nconferred upon the trustee with respect to the exercise of a\npower, its exercise is not subject to control by the court\nexcept to prevent an abuse by the trustee of his discre\ntion’ ” (quoting Restatement (Second) of Trusts §187)).\nThus, far from “impos[ing] [a] rigid and inflexible re\nquirement” that courts must defer to plan administrators,\npost, at 8, we simply hold that the lower courts should\nhave applied the standard established in Firestone and\nGlenn.\n                            III\n   The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the District\nCourt could refuse to defer to the Plan Administrator’s\ninterpretation of the Plan on remand, simply because the\nCourt of Appeals had found a previous related interpreta\ntion by the Administrator to be invalid. Because we re\nverse on that ground, we do not reach the question\nwhether the Court of Appeals also erred in applying a\ndeferential standard of review to the decision of the Dis\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

To explain my view, I shall describe the\nthree significant mistakes involved in this case.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  The first mistake is that of Xerox Corporation’s pension\nplan (Plan) and its administrators (collectively, Plan\nAdministrator), petitioners here. The Plan, as I under­\nstand it, pays employees the highest of three benefits upon\nretirement. App. 29a–31a. These benefits are calculated\nas follows (I simplify and use my own words, not those of\nthe Plan):\n    (1) “The Pension”: Take your average salary for your\n    five highest salary years at Xerox; multiply by 1.4 per­\n    cent; and multiply again by the number of years you\n    worked at Xerox (up to 30). Id., at 7a–11a, 29a–30a.\n    Thus, if the average salary of your five highest paid\n    years was $50,000 and you worked at Xerox for 30\n    years, you would be entitled to receive $21,000 per\n    year ($50,000 × 1.4 percent × 30).\n    (2) “The Cash Account”: Every year, Xerox credits 5\n2               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n    percent of your salary to a cash account. Id., at 40a.\n    This account accrues interest at a yearly fixed rate 1\n    percent above the 1-year Treasury bill rate. Id., at\n    41a. To determine your benefits under this approach,\n    take the balance of your cash account and convert the\n    final amount to an annuity. Id., at 31a. Thus, if you\n    have accrued, say, $200,000 in your account and the\n    relevant annuity rate at the time of your retirement is\n    7 percent, you would be entitled to receive approxi­\n    mately $14,000 per year upon your retirement (ap­\n    proximately $200,000 ×7 percent).\n    (3) “The Investment Account”: Before 1990, Xerox\n    contributed to an employee profit sharing plan. Id., at\n    33a–34a. Thus, all employees who were hired by the\n    end of 1989 have an investment account that consists\n    of all of the contributions Xerox made to this profit\n    sharing plan (prior to its discontinuation) and the in­\n    vestment returns on those contributions. Id., at 33a–\n    36a. To determine your benefits under this approach,\n    take the balance of your investment account and con­\n    vert the final amount to an annuity. Id., at 31a.\n    Thus, just like the cash account, if you have accrued\n    $400,000 in your account and the relevant annuity\n    rate at the time of your retirement is 7 percent, you\n    would be entitled to receive approximately $28,000\n    per year upon your retirement (approximately\n    $400,000 × 7 percent).\nGiven these three examples, the retiring employee’s pen­\nsion would come from the investment account, and the\nemployee would receive $28,000 per year.\n  This case concerns one aspect of Xerox’s retirement\nplan, namely, the way in which the Plan treats employees\nwho leave Xerox and later return, working for additional\nyears before their ultimate retirement. The Plan has long\ntreated such leaving-and-returning employees as follows\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(again, I simplify and use my own words):\n   First, when an employee initially leaves, she is paid a\nlump-sum distribution equivalent to the benefits she has\naccrued up to that point (i.e., the highest of her pension,\nher cash account, or, if she was hired before the end of\n1989, her investment account). See ante, at 2.\n   Second, when the employee returns, she again begins to\naccrue amounts in her cash account, App. 40a–41a, start­\ning from scratch. (She accrues nothing in her investment\naccount, because Xerox no longer makes profit sharing\ncontributions. Id., at 34a.) Thus, by the time of her re­\ntirement the employee may not have accrued much money\nin this account.\n   Third, a rehired employee’s pension is calculated in the\nway I have set forth above, with her entire tenure at Xerox\n(both before her departure and after her return) taken into\naccount. See Brief for Petitioners 9–10.\n   Fourth, the employee’s benefits calculation is adjusted\nto take account of the fact that the employee has already\nreceived a lump-sum distribution from the Plan. See App.\n32a; Brief for Petitioners 10–11.\n   This case is about the adjustment that takes place dur­\ning step four. It concerns the way in which the Plan Ad­\nministrator calculates that adjustment so as to reflect the\nfact that a retiring leaving-and-returning employee has\nalready received a distribution when she initially left\nXerox. Before 1989, the Plan Administrator calculated the\nadjusted amount by taking the benefits distribution previ­\nously received (say, $100,000) and adjusting it to equal the\namount that would have existed in the investment account\nhad no distribution been made. Ibid. Thus, if an employee\nhad not left Xerox, and if the $100,000 had been left in her\ninvestment account for, say, 20 years, that amount would\nlikely have increased dramatically—perhaps doubling,\ntripling, or quadrupling in amount, depending upon how\nwell the Plan’s investments performed.\n4                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   It is this hypothetical sum—termed the “phantom ac­\ncount,” ante, at 2—that is at issue in this case. Xerox’s\npre-1989 Plan assumed that a rehired employee had this\nhypothetical sum on hand at the time of her final retire­\nment from the company, and in effect subtracted the\namount from the employee’s benefits upon her departure.\nBrief for Petitioners 10–11; cf. ante, at 2. Depending on\nhow the Plan’s investments did over time, the Administra­\ntor’s use of this “phantom account” could have a substan­\ntial impact on a rehired employee’s benefits. (See Appen­\ndix, infra, for an example of how this “phantom account”\nworks.)\n   When the Plan Administrator amended Xerox’s Em­\nployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)\nPlan in 1989, however, it made what it tells us was an\n“inadverten[t]” omission. Brief for Petitioners 11, n. 3. In\na section of the 1989 Plan applicable to the roughly 100\nleaving-and-returning employees who are plaintiffs here,\nthe Plan said that it would “offset” the retiring employees’\n“accrued benefit” (as ordinarily calculated) “by the accrued\nbenefit attributable” to the prior lump-sum “distribution”\nthose employees received when they initially left Xerox.\nApp. 32a. But the Plan said nothing about how it would\ncalculate this “offset.” In other words, the Plan said noth­\ning about the Administrator’s use of the “phantom ac­\ncount.”\n   This led to the first mistake in this case. Despite the\nPlan’s failure to include language explaining how the\nAdministrator would take into account an employee’s prior\ndistribution, the Plan Administrator continued to employ\nthe “phantom account” methodology. In essence, the\nAdministrator read the 1989 Plan to include the language\nthat had been omitted—an interpretation that, as de­\nscribed below, see Part I–B, infra, the Court of Appeals\nfound to be arbitrary and capricious and in violation of\nERISA.\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

In 1999, the respondents, nearly 100 employees who\nleft and were later rehired by Xerox, brought this lawsuit.\nAnte, at 2; Brief for Petitioners ii–iii, 12. They pointed out\nthat the 1989 Plan said that it would decrease their re­\ntirement benefits to reflect the fact that they had already\nreceived a lump-sum benefits distribution when they\ninitially left Xerox. But, they added, neither the 1989\nPlan, nor the 1989 Plan’s Summary Plan Description, said\nanything about whether (or how) the Administrator would\nadjust their previous benefits distribution to take into\naccount that they had received the distribution well before\ntheir retirement. They thus claimed that the Plan Admin­\nistrator could not use the “phantom account” methodology\nto adjust their previous distributions. See Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 4–5.\n   The District Court, however, rejected respondents’\nclaims. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2438746\"><a href=\"/opinion/2438746/frommert-v-conkright/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

And the court thus held in favor of peti­\ntioners—thereby committing the second mistake in this\ncase. Id., at 439.\n   On appeal, the Second Circuit disagreed with the Dis­\ntrict Court and vacated the District Court’s decision in\nrelevant part. 433 F. 3d 254 (2006). The Court of Appeals\nconcluded that, because the 1989 Plan said nothing about\nhow the Administrator would adjust the previous benefits\ndistributions, it was “arbitrary and capricious” for the\nAdministrator to interpret the 1989 Plan as if it still in­\ncorporated the “phantom account.” Id., at 265–266, and\nn. 11. And the Court of Appeals thus held that the lan­\nguage of the Plan and the Summary Plan Description, at\nthe least, violated ERISA by failing to provide respondents\n6                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwith fair notice that the Administrator was going to use\nthe “phantom account” approach. See id., at 265 (discuss­\ning 29 U. S. C. §1022); see also 433 F. 3d, at 263, 267–268\n(holding that the Administrator’s attempt to apply the\n“phantom account” to respondents violated two other\nERISA provisions: 29 U. S. C. §1054(h)’s notice require­\nment and §1054(g)’s prohibition on retroactive benefit\ncutbacks). Rather, the court noted, respondents “likely\nbelieved”—based on the language of the Plan—“that their\npast distributions would only be factored into their [cur­\nrent] benefits calculations by taking into account the\namounts they had actually received.” 433 F. 3d, at 267.\n  In light of these conclusions, the Court of Appeals rec­\nognized the need to devise a remedy for the Administra­\ntor’s abuse of discretion and ERISA violations—a remedy\nthat took into account the previous benefits distributions\nrespondents had received in a manner consistent with the\n1989 Plan. The court therefore remanded the case to the\nDistrict Court, with the following instructions:\n    “On remand, the remedy crafted by the district court\n    for those employees [in the respondents’ situation]\n    should utilize an appropriate [pre-1989 Plan] calcula­\n    tion to determine their benefits. We recognize the dif­\n    ficulty that this task poses . . . . As guidance for the\n    district court, we suggest that it may wish to employ\n    equitable principles when determining the appropri­\n    ate calculation and fashioning the appropriate rem­\n    edy.” Id., at 268.\n  On remand, the District Court invited the parties to\nsubmit remedial recommendations. Brief for Petitioners\n14. The Plan Administrator proposed an approach that\nwould adjust respondents’ previous benefits distributions\nby adding interest, and, as a fallback, the Administrator\nsuggested that the Plan should treat respondents as new\nhires.

The District Court rejected these suggestions and\nconcluded that the “appropriate” remedy was the one\nsuggested by the Second Circuit: no adjustment to the\nprior distributions received by respondents.              </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2312765\"><a href=\"/opinion/2312765/frommert-v-conkright/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

The court stated that\nthis remedy was “straightforward; it adequately pre­\nvent[ed] employees from receiving a windfall[;] and . . . it\nmost clearly reflect[ed] what a reasonable employee would\nhave anticipated based on the not-very-clear language in\nthe Plan.” Ibid. And the Court of Appeals, finding that\nthe District Court did not abuse its discretion in crafting a\nremedy, affirmed. 535 F. 3d 111 (CA2 2008).\n                             II\n   The third mistake, I believe, is the Court’s. As the\nmajority recognizes, ante, at 4, “principles of trust law”\nguide this Court in “determining the appropriate stan­\ndard” by which to review the actions of an ERISA plan\nadministrator. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489\nU. S. 101, 111–113 (1989); see also Metropolitan Life Ins.\nCo. v. Glenn, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 4);\nAetna Health Inc. v. Davila, 542 U.

And, as the majority also recognizes, ante, at 4,\nwhere an ERISA plan grants an administrator the discre­\ntionary authority to interpret plan terms, trust law re\nquires a court to defer to the plan administrator’s inter­\npretation of plan terms. See, e.g., Glenn, supra, at ____\n(slip op., at 4). But the majority further concludes that\ntrust law “does not resolve the specific issue before” the\nCourt in this case—i.e., whether a court is required to\ndefer to an administrator’s second attempt at interpreting\nplan documents, even after the court has already deter­\nmined that the administrator’s first attempt amounted to\nan abuse of discretion. Ante, at 9. In my view, this final\n8                 CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nconclusion is erroneous, as trust law imposes no such rigid\nand inflexible requirement.\n   The Second Circuit found the Administrator’s interpre­\ntation of the Plan to be arbitrary and capricious and in\nviolation of ERISA, and it made clear that the District\nCourt’s task on remand was to “craf[t]” a “remedy.” See\n433 F. 3d, at 268. Trust law treatise writers say that in\nthese circumstances a court may (but need not) exercise its\nown discretion rather than defer to a trustee’s interpreta­\ntion of trust language. See G. Bogert & G. Bogert, Law of\nTrusts and Trustees §560, pp. 222–223 (2d rev. ed. 1980)\n(hereinafter Bogert & Bogert) (after finding an abuse of\ndiscretion, a court may “decid[e] for the trustee how he\nshould act,” possibly by “stating the exact result” the court\n“desires to achieve”); see also 2 Restatement (Third) of\nTrusts §50, p. 258 (2001) (hereinafter Third Restatement)\n(“A discretionary power conferred upon the trustee . . . is\nsubject to judicial control only to prevent misinterpreta­\ntion or abuse of the discretion by the trustee”); 1 Restate­\nment (Second) of Trusts §187, p. 402 (1957) (hereinafter\nSecond Restatement) (“Where discretion is conferred upon\nthe trustee . . . , its exercise is not subject to control by the\ncourt, except to prevent an abuse by the trustee of his\ndiscretion”); see also Firestone, supra, at 111. Judges\ndeciding trust law cases have said the same. See, e.g.,\nColton v. Colton, 127 U. S. 300, 322 (1888) (stating that it\nwas the “duty of the court” to determine the trust pay­\nments due after rejecting the trustee’s interpretation);\nState v.

In short, the controlling trust law princi­\nple appears to be that, “[w]here the court finds that there\nhas been an abuse of a discretionary power, the decree to\nbe rendered is in its discretion.” Bogert & Bogert §560, at\n222.\n   Of course, the fact that trust law grants courts discre­\ntion does not mean that they will exercise that discretion\nin all instances. The majority refers to the 2007 edition of\nScott on Trusts, ante, at 6, which says that, if there is “no\nreason” to doubt that a trustee “will . . . fairly exercise” his\n“discretion,” then courts “ordinarily will not fix the\namount” of a payment “but will instead direct the trustee\nto make reasonable provision for the beneficiary’s sup­\nport,” 3 A. Scott, W. Fratcher, & M. Ascher, Scott and\nAscher on Trusts §18.2.1, pp. 1348–1349 (5th ed. 2007)\n(emphasis added). As this passage demonstrates, there\nare situations in which a court will typically defer to a\ntrustee’s remedial suggestion.      The word “ordinarily”\nconfirms, however, that the Scott treatise writers recog­\nnize that there are instances in which courts will not\ndefer. And other treatises indicate that black letter trust\nlaw gives the district courts authority to decide which\ninstances are which. See Bogert & Bogert §560, at 222–\n223 (when there is an abuse of discretion, a court “may set\naside the transaction,” “award damages to the benefici­\nary,” or “order a new decision to be made in the light of\nrules expounded by the court”); 2 Third Restatement §50,\nand Comment b, at 261 (discussing similar remedial op­\ntions); 1 Second Restatement §187, and Comment b, at\n402 (same); see also 3 Third Restatement §87, and Com­\nment c, at 244–245 (noting that “judicial intervention on\nthe ground of abuse” is allowed when a “good-faith,” yet\n“unreasonable,” decision is made by a trustee); Rubion,\nsupra, at 54–55, 308 S. W. 2d, at 11 (discussing a court’s\nremedial options).\n10               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n  Nevertheless, the majority reads the Scott treatise as\nestablishing an absolute requirement that courts defer to\na trustee’s fallback position absent “reason to believe that\n[the trustee] will not exercise [his] discretion fairly—for\nexample, upon a showing that the trustee has already\nacted in bad faith.” Ante, at 6. And based on this reading,\nthe majority further concludes that the existence of the\nScott treatise creates uncertainty as to whether, under\nbasic trust law principles, a court has the power to craft a\nremedy for a trustee’s abuse of discretion. Ante, at 6–9.\n  It is unclear to me, however, why the majority reads the\npassage from Scott as creating a war among treatise writ­\ners, compare ante, at 6 (discussing Scott) with ante, at 8\n(discussing Bogert), when the relevant passages can so\neasily be read as consistent with one another. I simply\nread the Scott treatise language as identifying circum­\nstances in which courts typically choose to defer to an\nadministrator’s fallback position. The treatise does not\nsuggest that the law forbids a court from acting on its own\nin the exercise of its broad remedial authority—authority\nthat trust law plainly grants to supervising courts. See\nsupra, at 8–9.\n  A closer look at the Scott treatise confirms this under­\nstanding. The treatise cites seven cases in support of the\npassage upon which the majority relies. See 3 Scott\n§18.2.1, at 1349, n. 4. Three of these cases explicitly state\nthat a court may exercise its discretion to craft a remedy if\na trustee has previously abused its discretion.

I repeat: Not a\nsingle case cited by the Scott treatise writers supports the\nmajority’s reading of the treatise.\n   The majority seeks to justify its reading of the Scott\ntreatise by referring to four cases that Scott does not cite.\nSee ante, at 7, n. 1. I am not surprised that the treatise\ndoes not refer to these cases.

And I am\naware of no such case. In contrast, the Restatement and\nBogert and Scott treatises identify numerous cases in\nwhich courts have remedied a trustee’s abuse of discretion\nby ordering the trustee to pay a specific amount.

Fratcher, Scott on Trusts §187, pp. 14–15 (4th\ned. 1988) (“This ordinarily means that so long as [the\ntrustee] acts not only in good faith and from proper mo­\ntives, but also within the bounds of reasonable judgment,\nthe court will not interfere; but the court will inter-\nfere when he acts outside the bounds of a reasonable\njudgment”).\n   Nor does anything in the present case suggest that the\nDistrict Court abused its remedial authority. The Second\nCircuit stated that the interpretive problem on remand\nwas in essence a remedial problem. See 433 F. 3d, at 268.\nIt added that the remedial problem was “difficul[t]” and\nthat “the district court . . . may wish to employ equitable\nprinciples when determining the appropriate calculation\nand fashioning the appropriate remedy.” Ibid. The Ad­\nministrator had previously abused his discretionary\npower. Id., at 265–268. And the District Court found that\nthe Administrator’s primary remedial suggestion on re­\nmand—adjusting respondents’ previous benefits distribu­\ntions by adding interest—probably would have violated\nERISA’s notice provisions. 472 F. Supp. 2d, at 457. Under\nthese circumstances, the District Court reasonably could\nhave found a need to use its own remedial judgment,\nrather than rely on the Administrator’s—which is just\nwhat the Second Circuit said. 535 F. 3d, at 119.\n   Moreover, even if the “narrow” trust law “question\nbefore us” were difficult, ante, at 6—which it is not—this\ndifficulty would not excuse the Court from trying to do its\nbest to work out a legal solution that nonetheless respects\nbasic principles of trust law. “Congress invoked the com­\nmon law of trusts” in enacting ERISA, and this Court has\nthus repeatedly looked to trust law in order to determine\n“the particular duties and powers” of ERISA plan adminis­\ntrators.

S., at 111–113. While, as the majority recognizes, ante,\nat 8, trust law may “not tell the entire story,” Varity Corp.\nv. Howe, 516 U. S. 489, 497 (1996), I am aware of no other\ncase in which this Court has simply ignored trust law (on\nthe basis that it was unclear) and crafted a legal rule\nbased on nothing but “the guiding principles we have\nidentified underlying ERISA,” ante, at 9. See Varity,\nsupra, at 497 (“In some instances, trust law will offer only\na starting point, after which courts must go on to ask\nwhether, or to what extent, the language of the statute, its\nstructure, or its purposes require departing from common­\nlaw trust requirements” (emphasis added)).\n   In any event, it is far from clear that the Court’s legal\nrule reflects an appropriate analysis of ERISA-based\npolicy. To the contrary, the majority’s absolute “one free\nhonest mistake” rule is impractical, for it requires courts\nto determine what is “honest,” encourages appeals on the\npoint, and threatens to delay further proceedings that\nalready take too long. (Respondents initially filed this\nretirement benefits case in 1999.) See Glenn, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 10). It also ignores what we previously have\npointed out—namely, that abuses of discretion “arise in\ntoo many contexts” and “concern too many circumstances”\nfor this Court “to come up with a one-size-fits-all proce­\ndural [approach] that is likely to promote fair and accu­\nrate” benefits determinations. Ibid. And, finally, the\nmajority’s approach creates incentives for administrators\nto take “one free shot” at employer-favorable plan inter­\npretations and to draft ambiguous retirement plans in the\nfirst instance with the expectation that they will have\nrepeated opportunities to interpret (and possibly reinter­\npret) the ambiguous terms. I thus fail to see how the\nmajority’s “one free honest mistake” approach furthers\nERISA’s core purpose of “promot[ing] the interests of\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

S. 85, 90\n(1983); see also, e.g., 29 U. S. C. §1001(b) (noting that\nERISA was enacted “to protect . . . employee benefit plans\nand their beneficiaries”); Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoone\njongen, 514 U. S. 73, 83 (1995) (discussing ERISA’s central\n“goa[l]” of “enab[ing] plan beneficiaries to learn their\nrights and obligations at any time”); Massachusetts Mut.\nLife Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U. S. 134, 148 (1985) (ERISA\nwas enacted “to protect contractually defined benefits”).\n   The majority does identify ERISA-related factors—e.g.,\npromoting predictability and uniformity, encouraging\nemployers to adopt strong plans—that it believes favor\ngiving more power to plan administrators. See ante, at 9–\n13. But, in my view, these factors are, at the least, offset\nby the factors discussed above—e.g., discouraging admin­\nistrators from writing opaque plans and interpreting them\naggressively—that argue to the contrary. At best, the\npolicies at issue—some arguing in one direction, some the\nother—are far less able than trust law to provide a “guid­\ning principle.” Thus, I conclude that here, as elsewhere,\ntrust law ultimately provides the best way for courts to\napproach the administration and interpretation of ERISA.\nSee, e.g., Firestone, supra, at 111–113. And trust law\nhere, as I have said, leaves to the supervising court the\ndecision as to how much weight to give to a plan adminis­\ntrator’s remedial opinion.\n                            III\n  Since the District Court was not required to defer to the\nAdministrator’s fallback position, I should consider the\nsecond question presented, namely, whether the Court of\nAppeals properly reviewed the District Court’s decision\nunder an “abuse of discretion” standard.

FROMMERT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nCourt of Appeals’ decision. If the court deferred to the\nDistrict Court’s interpretation of Plan terms, then the\nCourt of Appeals most likely should have reviewed the\ndecision de novo. See Firestone, supra, at 112; cf. Davila,\nsupra, at 210 (“Any dispute over the precise terms of the\nplan is resolved by a court under a de novo review stan­\ndard”). If instead the Court of Appeals deferred to the\nDistrict Court’s creation of a remedy, in significant part on\nthe basis of “equitable principles,” then it properly re­\nviewed the District Court decision for “abuse of discre­\ntion.” See, e.g., Cook v. Liberty Life Assurance Co., 320\nF. 3d 11, 24 (CA1 2003); Zervos v. Verizon N. Y., Inc., 277\nF. 3d 635, 648 (CA2 2002); Grosz-Salomon v. Paul Revere\nLife Ins. Co., 237 F. 3d 1154, 1163 (CA9 2001); Halpin v.\nW. W. Grainger, Inc., 962 F. 2d 685, 697 (CA7 1992).\n   The District Court opinion contains language that sup­\nports either characterization. On the one hand, the court\nwrote that its task was to “interpret the Plan as written.”\n472 F. Supp. 2d, at 457. On the other hand, the court said\nthat “virtually nothing is set forth in either the Plan or the\n[Summary Plan Description]” about how to treat prior\ndistributions; and, in describing its task, it said that the\nCourt of Appeals had directed it to use “equitable princi­\nples” in fashioning a remedy. Ibid. Ultimately, the Dis­\ntrict Court appears to have used both the Plan language\nand equitable principles to arrive at its conclusion. See\nid., at 457–459.\n   The Court of Appeals, too, used language that supports\nboth characterizations. Compare 535 F. 3d, at 117 (noting\nthat the District Court “applied [Plan] terms” in crafting\nits remedy), with id., at 117–119 (describing the District\nCourt’s decision as the “craft[ing]” of a “remedy” and\nacknowledging that it had directed the District Court to\nuse “equitable principles” in doing so). But the Court of\nAppeals ultimately treated the District Court’s opinion as\nif it primarily created a fair remedy. Ibid. Given the prior\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            17\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nCourt of Appeals opinion’s language, supra, at 6 (quoting\n433 F. 3d, at 268), I believe that view is a fair, indeed a\ncorrect, view. And I consequently believe the Court of\nAppeals properly reviewed the result for an “abuse of\ndiscretion.”\n   Petitioners argue that, because respondents were seek­\ning relief under 29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B), the Court of\nAppeals was, in effect, prohibited from treating the rem­\nedy as anything other than an application of a plan’s\nterms. Brief for Petitioners 55–56; Reply Brief for Peti­\ntioners 3, and n. 8, 16–17. While this provision allows\nplaintiffs only to “enforce” or “clarify” rights or to “recover\nbenefits” “under the terms of the plan,” §1132(a)(1)(B)\n(emphasis added), it does not so limit a court’s remedial\nauthority, Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson,\n534 U. S. 204, 221 (2002) (In §1132(a)(1)(B), “Congress\nauthorized ‘a participant or beneficiary’ to bring a civil\naction . . . without referenc[ing] whether the relief sought\nis legal or equitable”). The provision thus does not pro­\nhibit a court from shaping relief through the application of\nequitable principles, as trust law plainly permits. See,\ne.g., 2 Third Restatement §50, and Comment b, at 261\n(discussing remedial options); Bogert & Bogert §870, at\n123–126 (2d rev. ed. 1995). Indeed, a court that finds, for\nexample, that an administrator provided employees with\ninadequate notice of a plan’s terms (as was true here) may\nhave no alternative but to rely significantly upon those\nprinciples. Cf. 29 U. S. C. §1104(a)(1)(D) (plan fiduciary\nmust “discharge his dut[y] . . . in accordance with the\ndocuments and instruments governing the plan insofar as\nsuch documents and instruments are consistent” with\nERISA).\n   For these reasons I would affirm the decision of the\nCourt of Appeals. And I therefore respectfully dissent\nfrom the majority’s contrary determination.\n18               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n              AppendixREYER, J., dissenting\n                    B to the opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n                        APPENDIX\n\n                  The “Phantom Account” \n\n   This Appendix provides a simplified and illustrative\nexample of, as I understand it, how the “phantom account”\nworks. For the purposes of this Appendix, I make the\nfollowing assumptions: John worked at Xerox for 10 years\nfrom 1970 to 1980. At the time of his departure from\nXerox, he was issued a lump-sum benefits distribution of\n$140,000. He was then rehired in January 1989, and he\nworked for Xerox for 5 more years before retiring (until\nDecember 1993), earning $50,000 each year of his second\nterm of employment. I also assume that (1) Xerox’s con­\ntribution to John’s investment account was $2,500 in 1989\n(the last year such accounts were offered), (2) Xerox’s\ncontributions to John’s cash and investment accounts are\nalways made on the final day of the year, (3) the rate of\nreturn in John’s cash and investment accounts is always 5\npercent, and (4) annuity rates are also always 5 percent.\n(For the sake of simplicity, I treat all annuities as perpe­\ntuities, meaning that I calculate the present value of the\nannuities thusly: Present Value = Annual Pay­\nment/Annuity Rate.)\n   Given the above assumptions, John’s pension upon his\nretirement would be $10,500 per year ($50,000 × 1.4 per­\ncent × 15 years), which has a present value of $210,000\n($10,500/5 percent). John’s cash and investment accounts\nat the end of his fifth year would look as follows (While\nXerox’s ERISA Plan did not include cash accounts until\n1990, each employee’s opening cash account balance was\ncredited with the balance of his investment account at the\nend of 1989. The figures for John’s cash account in 1989\nthus reflect the performance of his investment account. In\naddition, all numbers are rounded to the nearest hun­\ndred):\n                        Cite as: 559 U.

In making this comparison, the Plan Administrator\nwould assume that John had never left Xerox when calcu­\nlating John’s pension. The Plan Administrator would also\nassume, when calculating the value of John’s cash and\ninvestment accounts, that the lump-sum distribution John\nhad received from Xerox had remained invested in his\naccounts. (In other words, the Plan Administrator would\ninclude the “phantom account” in his calculations. The\ntotal value of this phantom account in 1989, when John\nrejoined Xerox, is equal to John’s lump-sum distribution of\n$140,000 × 1.059, or approximately $217,200.)\n   The Plan Administrator would thus compare John’s\npension, column D, and column H to determine John’s\nbenefit. As you can see above, column H provides the\ngreatest benefit, so John’s cash account would be used to\ncalculate the benefits he would receive upon retirement.\n   Second, the Plan Administrator would “offset” John’s\nprior distribution against his current benefits to deter­\nmine the amount of benefits John would actually receive.\nThus, the Plan Administrator would take the “total” value\nof John’s cash account, including the “phantom account”\n($277,800), and subtract out the value of the “phantom\n20              CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n             AppendixREYER, J., dissenting\n                   B to the opinion of BREYER, J.\n\naccount” ($264,000). The total present value of the bene­\nfits John would receive upon his second retirement would\nthus be $13,800.\n   This means that John would receive approximately $690\nannually ($13,800 × 5 percent) upon retirement under the\nPlan Administrator’s “phantom account” approach. In\ncomparison, if John had simply been treated as a new\nemployee when he was rehired, his pension would have\nentitled him to at least $3,500 annually ($50,000 × 1.4\npercent × 5 years) upon his retirement. And the impact of\nthe “phantom account” may have been even more dramatic\nwith respect to some of the respondents in this case. See\nBrief for Respondents 24 (describing how respondent Paul\nFrommert erroneously received a report claiming that his\nretirement benefits were $2,482.00 per month, before later\ndiscovering that, because of the “phantom account,” his\nactual monthly pension was $5.31 per month); see also\nApp. 63a.\n</pre>", "id": 2359, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2010/04/21/Conkright_v._Frommert.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2009                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued January 20, 2010—Decided April 21, 2010\nPetitioners are Xerox Corporation’s pension plan (Plan) and the Plan’s\n  current and former administrators (Plan Administrator). Respon\n  dents are employees who left Xerox in the 1980’s, received lump-sum\n  distributions of retirement benefits earned up to that point, and were\n  later rehired. To account for the past distributions when calculating\n  respondents’ current benefits, the Plan Administrator initially inter\n  preted the Plan to call for an approach that has come to be known as\n  the “phantom account” method. Respondents challenged that method\n  in an action under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of\n  1974 (ERISA). The District Court granted summary judgment for\n  the Plan, but the Second Circuit vacated and remanded. It held that\n  the Plan Administrator’s interpretation was unreasonable and that\n  respondents had not received adequate notice that the phantom ac\n  count method would be used to calculate their benefits. On remand,\n  the Plan Administrator proposed a new interpretation of the Plan\n  that accounted for the time value of the money respondents had pre\n  viously received. The District Court declined to apply a deferential\n  standard to this interpretation, and adopted instead an approach\n  proposed by respondents that did not account for the time value of\n  money. Affirming in relevant part, the Second Circuit held that the\n  District Court was correct not to apply a deferential standard on re\n  mand, and that the District Court’s decision on the merits was not an\n  abuse of discretion.\nHeld: The District Court should have applied a deferential standard of\n review to the Plan Administrator’s interpretation of the Plan on re\n mand. Pp. 4–15.\n    (a) This Court addressed the standard for reviewing the decisions\n of ERISA plan administrators in Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v.\n2                      CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Bruch, 489 U. S. 101. Firestone looked to “principles of trust law” for\n    guidance. Id., at 111. Under trust law, the appropriate standard de\n    pends on the language of the instrument creating the trust. When a\n    trust instrument gives the trustee “power to construe disputed or\n    doubtful terms, . . . the trustee’s interpretation will not be disturbed\n    if reasonable.” Ibid. Under Firestone and the Plan’s terms, the Plan\n    Administrator here would normally be entitled to deference when in\n    terpreting the Plan. The Court of Appeals, however, crafted an ex\n    ception to Firestone deference, holding that a court need not apply a\n    deferential standard when a plan administrator’s previous construc\n    tion of the same plan terms was found to violate ERISA. Pp. 4–5.\n       (b) The Second Circuit’s “one-strike-and-you’re-out” approach has\n    no basis in Firestone, which set out a broad standard of deference\n    with no suggestion that it was susceptible to ad hoc exceptions. This\n    Court held in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn, 554 U. S. ___, ___,\n    that a plan administrator operating under a systemic conflict of in\n    terest is nonetheless still entitled to deferential review. In light of\n    that ruling, it is difficult to see why a single honest mistake should\n    require a different result. Nor is the Second Circuit’s decision sup\n    ported by the considerations on which Firestone and Glenn were\n    based—the plan’s terms, trust law principles, and ERISA’s purposes.\n    The Plan grants the Plan Administrator general interpretive author\n    ity without suggesting that the authority is limited to first efforts to\n    construe the Plan. An exception to Firestone deference is also not re\n    quired by trust law principles, which serve as a guide under ERISA\n    but do not “tell the entire story.” Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U. S. 489,\n    497. Trust law does not resolve the specific question whether courts\n    may strip a plan administrator of Firestone deference after one good\n    faith mistake, but the guiding principles underlying ERISA do.\n       ERISA represents a “ ‘careful balancing’ between ensuring fair and\n    prompt enforcement of rights under a plan and the encouragement of\n    the creation of such plans.” Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, 542 U. S.\n    200, 215. Firestone deference preserves this “careful balancing” and\n    protects the statute’s interests in efficiency, predictability, and uni\n    formity. Respondents claim that deference is less important once a\n    plan administrator’s interpretation has been found unreasonable, but\n    the interests in efficiency, predictability, and uniformity do not sud\n    denly disappear simply because of a single honest mistake, as illus\n    trated by this case. When the District Court declined to apply a def\n    erential standard of review on remand, the court made the case more\n    complicated than necessary. Respondents’ approach threatens to in\n    terject additional issues into ERISA litigation that “would create fur\n    ther complexity, adding time and expense to a process that may al\n    ready be too costly for many [seeking] redress.” Glenn, supra, at ___.\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  This case also demonstrates the harm to predictability and uniform\n  ity that would result from stripping a plan administrator of Firestone\n  deference. The District Court’s interpretation does not account for\n  the time value of money, but respondents’ own actuarial expert testi\n  fied that fairness required recognizing that principle. Respondents\n  do not dispute that the District Court’s approach would place them in\n  a better position than employees who never left the company. If\n  other courts construed the Plan to account for the time value of\n  money, moreover, Xerox could be placed in an impossible situation in\n  which the Plan is subject to different interpretations and obligations\n  in different States. Pp. 5–13.\n     (c) Respondents claim that plan administrators will adopt unrea\n  sonable interpretations of their plans seriatim, receiving deference\n  each time, thereby undermining the prompt resolution of benefit dis\n  putes, driving up litigation costs, and discouraging employees from\n  challenging administrators’ decisions. These concerns are overblown\n  because there is no reason to think that deference would be required\n  in the extreme circumstances that respondents foresee. Multiple er\n  roneous interpretations of the same plan provision, even if issued in\n  good faith, could support a finding that a plan administrator is too\n  incompetent to exercise his discretion fairly, cutting short the rounds\n  of costly litigation that respondents fear. Applying a deferential\n  standard of review also does not mean that the plan administrator\n  will always prevail on the merits. It means only that the plan admin\n  istrator’s interpretation “will not be disturbed if reasonable.” Fire\n  stone, 489 U. S., at 111.

Even administrators of ERISA\nplans. That should come as no surprise, given that the\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is “an\nenormously complex and detailed statute,” Mertens v.\nHewitt Associates, 508 U. S. 248, 262 (1993), and the plans\nthat administrators must construe can be lengthy and\ncomplicated. (The one at issue here runs to 81 pages, with\n139 sections.) We held in Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v.\nBruch, 489 U. S. 101 (1989), that an ERISA plan adminis\ntrator with discretionary authority to interpret a plan is\nentitled to deference in exercising that discretion. The\nquestion here is whether a single honest mistake in plan\ninterpretation justifies stripping the administrator of that\ndeference for subsequent related interpretations of the\nplan. We hold that it does not.\n                             I\n  As in many ERISA matters, the facts of this case are\nexceedingly complicated. Fortunately, most of the factual\ndetails are unnecessary to the legal issues before us, so we\n2                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncover them only in broad strokes. This case concerns\nXerox Corporation’s pension plan, which is covered by\nERISA, 88 Stat. 829, as amended, 29 U. S. C. §1001 et seq.\nPetitioners are the plan itself (hereinafter Plan), and the\nPlan’s current and former administrators (hereinafter\nPlan Administrator). See §1002(16)(A)(i); App. 32a. Re\nspondents are Xerox employees who left the company in\nthe 1980’s, received lump-sum distributions of retirement\nbenefits they had earned up to that point, and were later\nrehired. See 328 F. Supp. 2d 420, 424 (WDNY 2004); Brief\nfor Respondents 9–10. The dispute giving rise to this case\nconcerns how to account for respondents’ past distribu\ntions when calculating their current benefits—that is, how\nto avoid paying respondents the same benefits twice.\n   The Plan Administrator initially interpreted the Plan to\ncall for an approach that has come to be known as the\n“phantom account” method. 328 F. Supp. 2d, at 424.\nEssentially, that method calculated the hypothetical\ngrowth that respondents’ past distributions would have\nexperienced if the money had remained in Xerox’s invest\nment funds, and reduced respondents’ present benefits\naccordingly. See id., at 426–428; App. to Pet. for Cert.\n146a. After the Plan Administrator denied respondents’\nadministrative challenges to that method, respondents\nfiled suit in federal court under ERISA, 29 U. S. C.\n§1132(a)(1)(B). See 328 F. Supp. 2d, at 428–429. The\nDistrict Court granted summary judgment for the Plan,\napplying a deferential standard of review to the Plan\nAdministrator’s interpretation. See id., at 430–431, 439.\nThe Second Circuit vacated and remanded, holding that\nthe Plan Administrator’s interpretation was unreasonable\nand that respondents had not been adequately notified\nthat the phantom account method would be used to calcu\nlate their benefits. See 433 F. 3d 254, 257, 265–269\n(2006).\n   The phantom account method having been exorcised\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom the Plan, the District Court on remand considered\nother approaches for adjusting respondents’ present bene\nfits in light of their past distributions. See 472 F. Supp.\n2d 452, 456–458 (WDNY 2007). The Plan Administrator\nsubmitted an affidavit proposing an approach that, like\nthe phantom account method, accounted for the time value\nof the money that respondents had previously received.\nBut unlike the phantom account method, the Plan Admin\nistrator’s new approach did not calculate the present value\nof a past distribution based on events that occurred after\nthe distribution was made. Instead, the new approach\nused an interest rate that was fixed at the time of the\ndistribution, thereby calculating the current value of the\ndistribution based on information that was known at the\ntime of the distribution. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 147a–\n153a. Petitioners argued that the District Court should\napply a deferential standard of review to this approach,\nand accept it as a reasonable interpretation of the Plan.\nSee Defendants’ Pre-Hearing Brief Addressed to Remedies\nin No. 00–CV–6311 (WDNY), pp. 7–8; Defendants’ Pre-\nHearing Reply Brief Addressing Remedies in No. 00–CV–\n6311 (WDNY), p. 2.\n   The District Court did not apply a deferential standard\nof review. Nor did it accept the Plan Administrator’s\ninterpretation. Instead, after finding the Plan to be am\nbiguous, the District Court adopted an approach proposed\nby respondents that did not account for the time value of\nmoney. Under that approach, respondents’ present bene\nfits were reduced only by the nominal amount of their past\ndistributions—thereby treating a dollar distributed to\nrespondents in the 1980’s as equal in value to a dollar\ndistributed today. See 472 F. Supp. 2d, at 457–458. The\nSecond Circuit affirmed in relevant part, holding that the\nDistrict Court was correct not to apply a deferential stan\ndard on remand, and that the District Court’s decision on\nthe merits was not an abuse of discretion. See 535 F. 3d\n4                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n111, 119 (2008).\n   Petitioners asked us to grant certiorari on two ques\ntions: (1) whether the District Court owed deference to the\nPlan Administrator’s interpretation of the Plan on re\nmand, and (2) whether the Court of Appeals properly\ngranted deference to the District Court on the merits. Pet.\nfor Cert. i. We granted certiorari on both, 557 U. S. ___\n(2009), but find it necessary to decide only the first.\n                              II\n                               A\n   This Court addressed the standard for reviewing the\ndecisions of ERISA plan administrators in Firestone, 489\nU. S. 101. Because ERISA’s text does not directly resolve\nthe matter, we looked to “principles of trust law” for guid\nance. Id., at 109, 111. We recognized that, under trust\nlaw, the proper standard of review of a trustee’s decision\ndepends on the language of the instrument creating the\ntrust. See id., at 111–112. If the trust documents give the\ntrustee “power to construe disputed or doubtful terms, . . .\nthe trustee’s interpretation will not be disturbed if reason\nable.” Id., at 111. Based on these considerations, we held\nthat “a denial of benefits challenged under §1132(a)(1)(B)\nis to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the\nbenefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discre\ntionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to\nconstrue the terms of the plan.” Id., at 115.\n   We expanded Firestone’s approach in Metropolitan Life\nIns. Co. v. Glenn, 554 U. S. ___ (2008). In determining the\nproper standard of review when a plan administrator\noperates under a conflict of interest, we again looked to\ntrust law, the terms of the plan at issue, and the principles\nof ERISA—plus, of course, our precedent in Firestone. See\n554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4, 6–7, 9–10). We held that,\nwhen the terms of a plan grant discretionary authority to\nthe plan administrator, a deferential standard of review\n                   Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)               5\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nremains appropriate even in the face of a conflict. See id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 9).\n  It is undisputed that, under Firestone and the terms of\nthe Plan, the Plan Administrator here would normally be\nentitled to deference when interpreting the Plan. See 328\nF. Supp. 2d, at 430–431 (observing that the Plan grants\nthe Plan Administrator “broad discretion in making deci\nsions relative to the Plan”). The Court of Appeals, how\never, crafted an exception to Firestone deference. Specifi\ncally, the Second Circuit held that a court need not apply a\ndeferential standard “where the administrator ha[s] previ\nously construed the same [plan] terms and we found such\na construction to have violated ERISA.” 535 F. 3d, at 119.\nUnder that view, the District Court here was entitled to\nreject a reasonable interpretation of the Plan offered by\nthe Plan Administrator, solely because the Court of Ap\npeals had overturned a previous interpretation by\nthe Administrator.       Cf. ibid. (accepting the District\nCourt’s chosen method as one of “several reasonable\nalternatives”).\n                               B\n  We reject this “one-strike-and-you’re-out” approach.\nBrief for Petitioners 51. As an initial matter, it has no\nbasis in the Court’s holding in Firestone, which set out a\nbroad standard of deference without any suggestion that\nthe standard was susceptible to ad hoc exceptions like the\none adopted by the Court of Appeals. See 489 U. S., at\n111, 115. Indeed, we refused to create such an exception\nto Firestone deference in Glenn, recognizing that ERISA\nlaw was already complicated enough without adding\n“special procedural or evidentiary rules” to the mix. 554\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). If, as we held in Glenn, a\nsystemic conflict of interest does not strip a plan adminis\ntrator of deference, see id., at ___ (slip op., at 9), it is diffi\ncult to see why a single honest mistake would require a\n6                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndifferent result.\n  Nor is the Court of Appeals’ decision supported by the\nconsiderations on which our holdings in Firestone and\nGlenn were based—namely, the terms of the plan, princi\nples of trust law, and the purposes of ERISA. See supra,\nat 4–5. First, the Plan here grants the Plan Administrator\ngeneral authority to “[c]onstrue the Plan.” App. to Pet. for\nCert. 141a–142a. Nothing in that provision suggests that\nthe grant of authority is limited to first efforts to construe\nthe Plan.\n  Second, the Court of Appeals’ exception to Firestone\ndeference is not required by principles of trust law. Trust\nlaw is unclear on the narrow question before us. A leading\ntreatise states that a court will strip a trustee of his dis\ncretion when there is reason to believe that he will not\nexercise that discretion fairly—for example, upon a show\ning that the trustee has already acted in bad faith:\n    “If the trustee’s failure to pay a reasonable amount [to\n    the beneficiary of the trust] is due to a failure to exer\n    cise [the trustee’s] discretion honestly and fairly, the\n    court may well fix the amount [to be paid] itself. On\n    the other hand, if the trustee’s failure to provide rea\n    sonably for the beneficiary is due to a mistake as to\n    the trustee’s duties or powers, and there is no reason\n    to believe the trustee will not fairly exercise the dis\n    cretion once the court has determined the extent of\n    the trustee’s duties and powers, the court ordinarily\n    will not fix the amount but will instead direct the\n    trustee to make reasonable provision for the benefici\n    ary’s support.” 3 A. Scott, W. Fratcher, & M. Ascher,\n    Scott and Ascher on Trusts §18.2.1, pp. 1348–1349\n    (5th ed. 2007) (hereinafter Scott and Ascher) (footnote\n    omitted) (citing cases).\nThis is not surprising—if the settlor who creates a trust\ngrants discretion to the trustee, it seems doubtful that the\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

Eaton, 82 N. H.\n216, 218, 132 A. 10, 11 (1926), and stripped the Plan\n\n——————\n  1 The   dissent is wrong to suggest a lack of case support for this inter\npretation of trust law. Post, at 10–12 (opinion of BREYER, J.). See, e.g.,\nHanford v. Clancy, 87 N. H. 458, 461, 183 A. 271, 272–273 (1936)\n(“Affirmative orders of disposition, such as the court made in this case,\nmay only be sustained if, under the circumstances, there is but one\nreasonable disposition possible.

E. 2d 306, 310 (2003)\n(agreeing with lower court that trustee abused its discretion, but\nvacating the court’s remedial order because it would “strip discretion\nfrom the trustee and replace it with the judgment of the court”). See\nalso Brief for Petitioners 40–43.\n8                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAdministrator of the deference he would otherwise enjoy\nunder Firestone and the terms of the Plan.\n  Other trust law sources, however, point the other way.\nFor example, the Restatement (Second) of Trusts states\nthat “the court will control the trustee in the exercise of a\npower where he acts beyond the bounds of a reasonable\njudgment.” Restatement (Second) of Trusts §187, Com\nment i, p. 406 (1957). Another treatise states that, after a\ntrustee has abused his discretion, “[s]ometimes the court\ndecides for the trustee how he should act, either by stating\nthe exact result it desires to achieve, or by fixing some\nlimits on the trustee’s action and giving him leeway within\nthose limits.” G. Bogert & G. Bogert, Law of Trusts and\nTrustees §560, p. 223 (2d rev. ed. 1980).\n  The unclear state of trust law on the question was per\nhaps best captured by the Texas Supreme Court:\n    “There is authority for ordering a dismissal of the case\n    to afford the trustee an opportunity to exercise a rea\n    sonable discretion in arriving at the amount of pay\n    ments to be made in the light of our discussion of the\n    problem and after a proper consideration of the many\n    factors involved. On the other hand, there is author\n    ity for remanding the case to the trial court to hear\n    evidence and in the exercise of its supervisory juris\n    diction to fix the amount of such payments. There is\n    still other authority for remanding the case to the\n    trial court to hear evidence and fix the boundaries of a\n    reasonable discretion to be exercised by the trustee\n    within maximum and minimum limits.” State v.\n    Rubion, 158 Tex. 43, 54–55, 308 S. W. 2d 4, 11 (1957)\n    (citations omitted).\n  While we are “guided by principles of trust law” in\nERISA cases, Firestone, 489 U. S., at 111, we have recog\nnized before that “trust law does not tell the entire story,”\nVarity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U. S. 489, 497 (1996); see ibid.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(“In some instances, trust law will offer only a starting\npoint, after which courts must go on to ask whether, or to\nwhat extent, the language of the statute, its structure, or\nits purposes require departing from common-law trust\nrequirements”); Brief for Respondents 50 (pressing same\nview as the dissent but concluding that the dispute over\ntrust law “need not be resolved”). Here trust law does not\nresolve the specific issue before us, but the guiding princi\nples we have identified underlying ERISA do.\n   Congress enacted ERISA to ensure that employees\nwould receive the benefits they had earned, but Congress\ndid not require employers to establish benefit plans in the\nfirst place. Lockheed Corp. v. Spink, 517 U. S. 882, 887\n(1996). We have therefore recognized that ERISA repre\nsents a “ ‘careful balancing’ between ensuring fair and\nprompt enforcement of rights under a plan and the en\ncouragement of the creation of such plans.” Aetna Health\nInc. v. Davila, 542 U. S. 200, 215 (2004) (quoting Pilot Life\nIns. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 54 (1987)). Congress\nsought “to create a system that is [not] so complex that\nadministrative costs, or litigation expenses, unduly dis\ncourage employers from offering [ERISA] plans in the first\nplace.” Varity Corp., supra, at 497. ERISA “induc[es]\nemployers to offer benefits by assuring a predictable set of\nliabilities, under uniform standards of primary conduct\nand a uniform regime of ultimate remedial orders and\nawards when a violation has occurred.” Rush Prudential\nHMO, Inc. v. Moran, 536 U. S. 355, 379 (2002).\n   Firestone deference protects these interests and, by\npermitting an employer to grant primary interpretive\nauthority over an ERISA plan to the plan administrator,\npreserves the “careful balancing” on which ERISA is\nbased. Deference promotes efficiency by encouraging\nresolution of benefits disputes through internal adminis\ntrative proceedings rather than costly litigation. It also\npromotes predictability, as an employer can rely on the\n10               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nexpertise of the plan administrator rather than worry\nabout unexpected and inaccurate plan interpretations that\nmight result from de novo judicial review. Moreover,\nFirestone deference serves the interest of uniformity,\nhelping to avoid a patchwork of different interpretations of\na plan, like the one here, that covers employees in differ\nent jurisdictions—a result that “would introduce consider\nable inefficiencies in benefit program operation, which\nmight lead those employers with existing plans to reduce\nbenefits, and those without such plans to refrain from\nadopting them.” Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482\nU. S. 1, 11 (1987). Indeed, a group of prominent actuaries\ntells us that it is impossible even to determine whether an\nERISA plan is solvent (a duty imposed on actuaries by\nfederal law, see 29 U. S. C. §§1023(a)(4), (d)) if the plan is\ninterpreted to mean different things in different places.\nSee Brief for Chief Actuaries as Amici Curiae 5–11.\n   Respondents and the United States as amicus curiae do\nnot question that deference to plan administrators serves\nthese important purposes. Rather, they argue that defer\nence is less important once a plan administrator has is\nsued an interpretation of a plan found to be unreasonable.\nBut the interests in efficiency, predictability, and uniform\nity—and the manner in which they are promoted by defer\nence to reasonable plan construction by administrators—\ndo not suddenly disappear simply because a plan adminis\ntrator has made a single honest mistake.\n   This case illustrates the point. Consider first the inter\nest in efficiency, an interest that Xerox has pursued by\ngranting the Plan Administrator authority to construe the\nPlan. On remand from the Court of Appeals, if the Dis\ntrict Court had applied a deferential standard of review\nunder Firestone, the question before it would have been\nwhether the Plan Administrator’s interpretation of the\nPlan was reasonable. After answering that question, the\ncase might well have been over. Instead, the District\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt declined to defer, and therefore had to answer the\nmore complicated question of how best to interpret the\nPlan.\n   The prospect of increased litigation costs inherent in\nrespondents’ approach does not end there. Under respon\ndents’ and the Government’s view, the question whether a\ndeferential standard of review was required in this case\nturns on whether the Plan Administrator was interpreting\nthe “same terms” or deciding the “same issue” on remand.\nSee Brief for Respondents 43, 46–48, 53, and n. 13; Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 13–15, 23. Whether\nthat condition is satisfied will not always be clear. Indeed,\npetitioners dispute that question here, arguing that the\nPlan Administrator confronted an entirely new issue on\nremand—how to interpret the Plan, knowing that specific\nprovisions requiring use of the phantom account method\ncould not be applied to respondents due to a lack of notice.\nSee Brief for Petitioners 50–51. Respondents would force\nthe parties to litigate this potentially complicated “same\nissue” or “same terms” question before a district court\ncould even decide whether deference is owed to a plan\nadministrator’s view. As we recognized in Glenn, there is\nlittle place in the ERISA context for these sorts of “special\nprocedural rules [that] would create further complexity,\nadding time and expense to a process that may already be\ntoo costly for many of those who seek redress.” 554 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 10).\n   The position of respondents and the Government could\ninterject other additional issues into ERISA litigation. For\nexample, even under their view, the District Court here\ncould have granted deference to the Plan Administrator;\nthe court merely was not required to do so. See Brief for\nRespondents 43, 49–50, 52–53; Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 23–24. That raises the question of how a\ncourt is to decide between the two options; respondents’\nanswer is to weigh an indeterminate number of factors,\n12               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich would only further complicate ERISA proceedings.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 34, 40–45.\n  This case also demonstrates the harm to the interest in\npredictability that would result from stripping a plan\nadministrator of Firestone deference. After declining to\napply a deferential standard here, the District Court\nadopted an interpretation of the Plan that does not ac\ncount for the time value of money. 472 F. Supp. 2d, at\n458; 535 F. 3d, at 119. In the actuarial world, this is\nheresy, and highly unforeseeable. Indeed, the actuaries\ntell us that they have never encountered an ERISA plan\nresembling this one that did not include some adjustment\nfor the time value of money. Brief for Chief Actuaries as\nAmici Curiae 12.\n  Respondents’ own actuarial expert testified before the\nDistrict Court that fairness would require recognizing the\ntime value of money in some fashion. See App. 127a,\n130a. And respondents and the Government do not dis\npute that the District Court’s approach, which does not\naccount for the fact that respondents were able to use\ntheir past distributions as they saw fit for over 20 years,\nwould place respondents in a better position than employ\nees who never left the company. Cf. Brief for Respondents\n42–43; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 32–33.\nDeference to plan administrators, who have a duty to all\nbeneficiaries to preserve limited plan assets, see Varity\nCorp., 516 U. S., at 514, helps prevent such windfalls for\nparticular employees.\n  Finally, this case demonstrates the uniformity problems\nthat arise from creating ad hoc exceptions to Firestone\ndeference. If other courts were to adopt an interpretation\nof the Plan that does account for the time value of money,\nXerox could be placed in an impossible situation. Similar\nXerox employees could be entitled to different benefits\ndepending on where they live, or perhaps where they bring\na legal action. Cf. 29 U. S. C. §1132(e)(2) (permitting suit\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“where the plan is administered, where the breach took\nplace, or where a defendant resides or may be found”). In\nfact, that may already be the case. In similar litigation\nover the Plan, the Ninth Circuit also rejected the use of\nthe phantom account method, but held that the Plan\nAdministrator should utilize actuarial principles in ac\ncounting for rehired employees’ past distributions—which\nwould presumably include taking some cognizance of the\ntime value of money. See Miller v. Xerox Corp. Retirement\nIncome Guarantee Plan, 464 F. 3d 871, 875–876 (2006);\nBrief for ERISA Industry Committee and American Bene\nfits Council as Amici Curiae 8–9. Thus, failing to defer to\nthe Plan Administrator here could well cause the Plan to\nbe subject to different interpretations in California and\nNew York. “Uniformity is impossible, however, if plans\nare subject to different legal obligations in different\nStates.” Egelhoff v. Egelhoff, 532 U. S. 141, 148 (2001).\nFirestone deference serves to avoid that result and to\npreserve the “careful balancing” of interests that ERISA\nrepresents. Pilot Life Ins. Co., 481 U. S., at 54.\n                               C\n   In spite of all this, respondents and the Government\nargue that requiring the District Court to apply Firestone\ndeference in this case would actually disserve the purposes\nof ERISA. They argue that continued deference would\nencourage plan administrators to adopt unreasonable\ninterpretations of plans in the first instance, as adminis\ntrators would anticipate a second chance to interpret their\nplans if their first interpretations were rejected. And they\nargue that plan administrators would be able to proceed\nseriatim through several interpretations of their plans,\neach time receiving deference, thereby undermining the\nprompt resolution of disputes over benefits, driving up\nlitigation costs, and discouraging employees from chal\nlenging the decisions of plan administrators at all.\n14               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   All this is overblown. There is no reason to think that\ndeference would be required in the extreme circumstances\nthat respondents foresee. Under trust law, a trustee may\nbe stripped of deference when he does not exercise his\ndiscretion “honestly and fairly.” 3 Scott and Ascher 1348.\nMultiple erroneous interpretations of the same plan provi\nsion, even if issued in good faith, might well support a\nfinding that a plan administrator is too incompetent to\nexercise his discretion fairly, cutting short the rounds of\ncostly litigation that respondents fear.\n   Applying a deferential standard of review does not mean\nthat the plan administrator will prevail on the merits. It\nmeans only that the plan administrator’s interpretation of\nthe plan “will not be disturbed if reasonable.” Firestone,\n489 U. S., at 111; see also ibid. (“ ‘Where discretion is\nconferred upon the trustee with respect to the exercise of a\npower, its exercise is not subject to control by the court\nexcept to prevent an abuse by the trustee of his discre\ntion’ ” (quoting Restatement (Second) of Trusts §187)).\nThus, far from “impos[ing] [a] rigid and inflexible re\nquirement” that courts must defer to plan administrators,\npost, at 8, we simply hold that the lower courts should\nhave applied the standard established in Firestone and\nGlenn.\n                            III\n   The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the District\nCourt could refuse to defer to the Plan Administrator’s\ninterpretation of the Plan on remand, simply because the\nCourt of Appeals had found a previous related interpreta\ntion by the Administrator to be invalid. Because we re\nverse on that ground, we do not reach the question\nwhether the Court of Appeals also erred in applying a\ndeferential standard of review to the decision of the Dis\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

FROMMERT ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n                        [April 21, 2010] \n\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS and\nJUSTICE GINSBURG join, dissenting.\n  I agree with the Court that “[p]eople make mistakes,”\nante, at 1, but I do not share its view of the law applicable\nto those mistakes. To explain my view, I shall describe the\nthree significant mistakes involved in this case.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  The first mistake is that of Xerox Corporation’s pension\nplan (Plan) and its administrators (collectively, Plan\nAdministrator), petitioners here. The Plan, as I under­\nstand it, pays employees the highest of three benefits upon\nretirement. App. 29a–31a. These benefits are calculated\nas follows (I simplify and use my own words, not those of\nthe Plan):\n    (1) “The Pension”: Take your average salary for your\n    five highest salary years at Xerox; multiply by 1.4 per­\n    cent; and multiply again by the number of years you\n    worked at Xerox (up to 30). Id., at 7a–11a, 29a–30a.\n    Thus, if the average salary of your five highest paid\n    years was $50,000 and you worked at Xerox for 30\n    years, you would be entitled to receive $21,000 per\n    year ($50,000 × 1.4 percent × 30).\n    (2) “The Cash Account”: Every year, Xerox credits 5\n2               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n    percent of your salary to a cash account. Id., at 40a.\n    This account accrues interest at a yearly fixed rate 1\n    percent above the 1-year Treasury bill rate. Id., at\n    41a. To determine your benefits under this approach,\n    take the balance of your cash account and convert the\n    final amount to an annuity. Id., at 31a. Thus, if you\n    have accrued, say, $200,000 in your account and the\n    relevant annuity rate at the time of your retirement is\n    7 percent, you would be entitled to receive approxi­\n    mately $14,000 per year upon your retirement (ap­\n    proximately $200,000 ×7 percent).\n    (3) “The Investment Account”: Before 1990, Xerox\n    contributed to an employee profit sharing plan. Id., at\n    33a–34a. Thus, all employees who were hired by the\n    end of 1989 have an investment account that consists\n    of all of the contributions Xerox made to this profit\n    sharing plan (prior to its discontinuation) and the in­\n    vestment returns on those contributions. Id., at 33a–\n    36a. To determine your benefits under this approach,\n    take the balance of your investment account and con­\n    vert the final amount to an annuity. Id., at 31a.\n    Thus, just like the cash account, if you have accrued\n    $400,000 in your account and the relevant annuity\n    rate at the time of your retirement is 7 percent, you\n    would be entitled to receive approximately $28,000\n    per year upon your retirement (approximately\n    $400,000 × 7 percent).\nGiven these three examples, the retiring employee’s pen­\nsion would come from the investment account, and the\nemployee would receive $28,000 per year.\n  This case concerns one aspect of Xerox’s retirement\nplan, namely, the way in which the Plan treats employees\nwho leave Xerox and later return, working for additional\nyears before their ultimate retirement. The Plan has long\ntreated such leaving-and-returning employees as follows\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(again, I simplify and use my own words):\n   First, when an employee initially leaves, she is paid a\nlump-sum distribution equivalent to the benefits she has\naccrued up to that point (i.e., the highest of her pension,\nher cash account, or, if she was hired before the end of\n1989, her investment account). See ante, at 2.\n   Second, when the employee returns, she again begins to\naccrue amounts in her cash account, App. 40a–41a, start­\ning from scratch. (She accrues nothing in her investment\naccount, because Xerox no longer makes profit sharing\ncontributions. Id., at 34a.) Thus, by the time of her re­\ntirement the employee may not have accrued much money\nin this account.\n   Third, a rehired employee’s pension is calculated in the\nway I have set forth above, with her entire tenure at Xerox\n(both before her departure and after her return) taken into\naccount. See Brief for Petitioners 9–10.\n   Fourth, the employee’s benefits calculation is adjusted\nto take account of the fact that the employee has already\nreceived a lump-sum distribution from the Plan. See App.\n32a; Brief for Petitioners 10–11.\n   This case is about the adjustment that takes place dur­\ning step four. It concerns the way in which the Plan Ad­\nministrator calculates that adjustment so as to reflect the\nfact that a retiring leaving-and-returning employee has\nalready received a distribution when she initially left\nXerox. Before 1989, the Plan Administrator calculated the\nadjusted amount by taking the benefits distribution previ­\nously received (say, $100,000) and adjusting it to equal the\namount that would have existed in the investment account\nhad no distribution been made. Ibid. Thus, if an employee\nhad not left Xerox, and if the $100,000 had been left in her\ninvestment account for, say, 20 years, that amount would\nlikely have increased dramatically—perhaps doubling,\ntripling, or quadrupling in amount, depending upon how\nwell the Plan’s investments performed.\n4                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   It is this hypothetical sum—termed the “phantom ac­\ncount,” ante, at 2—that is at issue in this case. Xerox’s\npre-1989 Plan assumed that a rehired employee had this\nhypothetical sum on hand at the time of her final retire­\nment from the company, and in effect subtracted the\namount from the employee’s benefits upon her departure.\nBrief for Petitioners 10–11; cf. ante, at 2. Depending on\nhow the Plan’s investments did over time, the Administra­\ntor’s use of this “phantom account” could have a substan­\ntial impact on a rehired employee’s benefits. (See Appen­\ndix, infra, for an example of how this “phantom account”\nworks.)\n   When the Plan Administrator amended Xerox’s Em­\nployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)\nPlan in 1989, however, it made what it tells us was an\n“inadverten[t]” omission. Brief for Petitioners 11, n. 3. In\na section of the 1989 Plan applicable to the roughly 100\nleaving-and-returning employees who are plaintiffs here,\nthe Plan said that it would “offset” the retiring employees’\n“accrued benefit” (as ordinarily calculated) “by the accrued\nbenefit attributable” to the prior lump-sum “distribution”\nthose employees received when they initially left Xerox.\nApp. 32a. But the Plan said nothing about how it would\ncalculate this “offset.” In other words, the Plan said noth­\ning about the Administrator’s use of the “phantom ac­\ncount.”\n   This led to the first mistake in this case. Despite the\nPlan’s failure to include language explaining how the\nAdministrator would take into account an employee’s prior\ndistribution, the Plan Administrator continued to employ\nthe “phantom account” methodology. In essence, the\nAdministrator read the 1989 Plan to include the language\nthat had been omitted—an interpretation that, as de­\nscribed below, see Part I–B, infra, the Court of Appeals\nfound to be arbitrary and capricious and in violation of\nERISA.\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n                               B\n   The District Court committed the second mistake in this\ncase. In 1999, the respondents, nearly 100 employees who\nleft and were later rehired by Xerox, brought this lawsuit.\nAnte, at 2; Brief for Petitioners ii–iii, 12. They pointed out\nthat the 1989 Plan said that it would decrease their re­\ntirement benefits to reflect the fact that they had already\nreceived a lump-sum benefits distribution when they\ninitially left Xerox. But, they added, neither the 1989\nPlan, nor the 1989 Plan’s Summary Plan Description, said\nanything about whether (or how) the Administrator would\nadjust their previous benefits distribution to take into\naccount that they had received the distribution well before\ntheir retirement. They thus claimed that the Plan Admin­\nistrator could not use the “phantom account” methodology\nto adjust their previous distributions. See Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 4–5.\n   The District Court, however, rejected respondents’\nclaims. 328 F. Supp. 2d 420 (WDNY 2004). The court\naccepted the Administrator’s argument that the 1989 Plan\nimplicitly incorporated the “phantom account” approach\nthat had previously been part of Xerox’s retirement plan.\nId., at 433–434. And the court thus held in favor of peti­\ntioners—thereby committing the second mistake in this\ncase. Id., at 439.\n   On appeal, the Second Circuit disagreed with the Dis­\ntrict Court and vacated the District Court’s decision in\nrelevant part. 433 F. 3d 254 (2006). The Court of Appeals\nconcluded that, because the 1989 Plan said nothing about\nhow the Administrator would adjust the previous benefits\ndistributions, it was “arbitrary and capricious” for the\nAdministrator to interpret the 1989 Plan as if it still in­\ncorporated the “phantom account.” Id., at 265–266, and\nn. 11. And the Court of Appeals thus held that the lan­\nguage of the Plan and the Summary Plan Description, at\nthe least, violated ERISA by failing to provide respondents\n6                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwith fair notice that the Administrator was going to use\nthe “phantom account” approach. See id., at 265 (discuss­\ning 29 U. S. C. §1022); see also 433 F. 3d, at 263, 267–268\n(holding that the Administrator’s attempt to apply the\n“phantom account” to respondents violated two other\nERISA provisions: 29 U. S. C. §1054(h)’s notice require­\nment and §1054(g)’s prohibition on retroactive benefit\ncutbacks). Rather, the court noted, respondents “likely\nbelieved”—based on the language of the Plan—“that their\npast distributions would only be factored into their [cur­\nrent] benefits calculations by taking into account the\namounts they had actually received.” 433 F. 3d, at 267.\n  In light of these conclusions, the Court of Appeals rec­\nognized the need to devise a remedy for the Administra­\ntor’s abuse of discretion and ERISA violations—a remedy\nthat took into account the previous benefits distributions\nrespondents had received in a manner consistent with the\n1989 Plan. The court therefore remanded the case to the\nDistrict Court, with the following instructions:\n    “On remand, the remedy crafted by the district court\n    for those employees [in the respondents’ situation]\n    should utilize an appropriate [pre-1989 Plan] calcula­\n    tion to determine their benefits. We recognize the dif­\n    ficulty that this task poses . . . . As guidance for the\n    district court, we suggest that it may wish to employ\n    equitable principles when determining the appropri­\n    ate calculation and fashioning the appropriate rem­\n    edy.” Id., at 268.\n  On remand, the District Court invited the parties to\nsubmit remedial recommendations. Brief for Petitioners\n14. The Plan Administrator proposed an approach that\nwould adjust respondents’ previous benefits distributions\nby adding interest, and, as a fallback, the Administrator\nsuggested that the Plan should treat respondents as new\nhires. Ante, at 3; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n6–7. The District Court rejected these suggestions and\nconcluded that the “appropriate” remedy was the one\nsuggested by the Second Circuit: no adjustment to the\nprior distributions received by respondents.              472\nF. Supp. 2d 452, 458 (WDNY 2007). The court stated that\nthis remedy was “straightforward; it adequately pre­\nvent[ed] employees from receiving a windfall[;] and . . . it\nmost clearly reflect[ed] what a reasonable employee would\nhave anticipated based on the not-very-clear language in\nthe Plan.” Ibid. And the Court of Appeals, finding that\nthe District Court did not abuse its discretion in crafting a\nremedy, affirmed. 535 F. 3d 111 (CA2 2008).\n                             II\n   The third mistake, I believe, is the Court’s. As the\nmajority recognizes, ante, at 4, “principles of trust law”\nguide this Court in “determining the appropriate stan­\ndard” by which to review the actions of an ERISA plan\nadministrator. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489\nU. S. 101, 111–113 (1989); see also Metropolitan Life Ins.\nCo. v. Glenn, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 4);\nAetna Health Inc. v. Davila, 542 U. S. 200, 218–219\n(2004); Central States, Southeast & Southwest Areas Pen\nsion Fund v. Central Transport, Inc., 472 U. S. 559, 570\n(1985). And, as the majority also recognizes, ante, at 4,\nwhere an ERISA plan grants an administrator the discre­\ntionary authority to interpret plan terms, trust law re\nquires a court to defer to the plan administrator’s inter­\npretation of plan terms. See, e.g., Glenn, supra, at ____\n(slip op., at 4). But the majority further concludes that\ntrust law “does not resolve the specific issue before” the\nCourt in this case—i.e., whether a court is required to\ndefer to an administrator’s second attempt at interpreting\nplan documents, even after the court has already deter­\nmined that the administrator’s first attempt amounted to\nan abuse of discretion. Ante, at 9. In my view, this final\n8                 CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nconclusion is erroneous, as trust law imposes no such rigid\nand inflexible requirement.\n   The Second Circuit found the Administrator’s interpre­\ntation of the Plan to be arbitrary and capricious and in\nviolation of ERISA, and it made clear that the District\nCourt’s task on remand was to “craf[t]” a “remedy.” See\n433 F. 3d, at 268. Trust law treatise writers say that in\nthese circumstances a court may (but need not) exercise its\nown discretion rather than defer to a trustee’s interpreta­\ntion of trust language. See G. Bogert & G. Bogert, Law of\nTrusts and Trustees §560, pp. 222–223 (2d rev. ed. 1980)\n(hereinafter Bogert & Bogert) (after finding an abuse of\ndiscretion, a court may “decid[e] for the trustee how he\nshould act,” possibly by “stating the exact result” the court\n“desires to achieve”); see also 2 Restatement (Third) of\nTrusts §50, p. 258 (2001) (hereinafter Third Restatement)\n(“A discretionary power conferred upon the trustee . . . is\nsubject to judicial control only to prevent misinterpreta­\ntion or abuse of the discretion by the trustee”); 1 Restate­\nment (Second) of Trusts §187, p. 402 (1957) (hereinafter\nSecond Restatement) (“Where discretion is conferred upon\nthe trustee . . . , its exercise is not subject to control by the\ncourt, except to prevent an abuse by the trustee of his\ndiscretion”); see also Firestone, supra, at 111. Judges\ndeciding trust law cases have said the same. See, e.g.,\nColton v. Colton, 127 U. S. 300, 322 (1888) (stating that it\nwas the “duty of the court” to determine the trust pay­\nments due after rejecting the trustee’s interpretation);\nState v. Rubion, 158 Tex. 43, 55, 308 S. W. 2d 4, 11 (1957)\n(“Considering that we have held that there has already\nbeen an abuse of discretion by the trustee . . . , we have\nconcluded that a remand of the case to the trial court for\nthe definite establishment of amounts to be paid will\nbetter promote a speedy administration of justice and a\nfinal termination of this litigation”); Glenn, supra, at ____\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5) (court may exercise\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)              9\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndiscretion under trust law when a “trustee had discretion\nbut abused it”). In short, the controlling trust law princi­\nple appears to be that, “[w]here the court finds that there\nhas been an abuse of a discretionary power, the decree to\nbe rendered is in its discretion.” Bogert & Bogert §560, at\n222.\n   Of course, the fact that trust law grants courts discre­\ntion does not mean that they will exercise that discretion\nin all instances. The majority refers to the 2007 edition of\nScott on Trusts, ante, at 6, which says that, if there is “no\nreason” to doubt that a trustee “will . . . fairly exercise” his\n“discretion,” then courts “ordinarily will not fix the\namount” of a payment “but will instead direct the trustee\nto make reasonable provision for the beneficiary’s sup­\nport,” 3 A. Scott, W. Fratcher, & M. Ascher, Scott and\nAscher on Trusts §18.2.1, pp. 1348–1349 (5th ed. 2007)\n(emphasis added). As this passage demonstrates, there\nare situations in which a court will typically defer to a\ntrustee’s remedial suggestion.      The word “ordinarily”\nconfirms, however, that the Scott treatise writers recog­\nnize that there are instances in which courts will not\ndefer. And other treatises indicate that black letter trust\nlaw gives the district courts authority to decide which\ninstances are which. See Bogert & Bogert §560, at 222–\n223 (when there is an abuse of discretion, a court “may set\naside the transaction,” “award damages to the benefici­\nary,” or “order a new decision to be made in the light of\nrules expounded by the court”); 2 Third Restatement §50,\nand Comment b, at 261 (discussing similar remedial op­\ntions); 1 Second Restatement §187, and Comment b, at\n402 (same); see also 3 Third Restatement §87, and Com­\nment c, at 244–245 (noting that “judicial intervention on\nthe ground of abuse” is allowed when a “good-faith,” yet\n“unreasonable,” decision is made by a trustee); Rubion,\nsupra, at 54–55, 308 S. W. 2d, at 11 (discussing a court’s\nremedial options).\n10               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n  Nevertheless, the majority reads the Scott treatise as\nestablishing an absolute requirement that courts defer to\na trustee’s fallback position absent “reason to believe that\n[the trustee] will not exercise [his] discretion fairly—for\nexample, upon a showing that the trustee has already\nacted in bad faith.” Ante, at 6. And based on this reading,\nthe majority further concludes that the existence of the\nScott treatise creates uncertainty as to whether, under\nbasic trust law principles, a court has the power to craft a\nremedy for a trustee’s abuse of discretion. Ante, at 6–9.\n  It is unclear to me, however, why the majority reads the\npassage from Scott as creating a war among treatise writ­\ners, compare ante, at 6 (discussing Scott) with ante, at 8\n(discussing Bogert), when the relevant passages can so\neasily be read as consistent with one another. I simply\nread the Scott treatise language as identifying circum­\nstances in which courts typically choose to defer to an\nadministrator’s fallback position. The treatise does not\nsuggest that the law forbids a court from acting on its own\nin the exercise of its broad remedial authority—authority\nthat trust law plainly grants to supervising courts. See\nsupra, at 8–9.\n  A closer look at the Scott treatise confirms this under­\nstanding. The treatise cites seven cases in support of the\npassage upon which the majority relies. See 3 Scott\n§18.2.1, at 1349, n. 4. Three of these cases explicitly state\nthat a court may exercise its discretion to craft a remedy if\na trustee has previously abused its discretion. See Old\nColony Trust Co. v. Rodd, 356 Mass. 584, 589, 254 N. E.\n2d 886, 889 (1970) (“A court of equity may control a trus­\ntee in the exercise of a fiduciary discretion if it fails to\nobserve standards of judgment apparent from the applica­\nble instrument”); In re Marre’s Estate, 18 Cal. 2d 184, 190,\n114 P. 2d 586, 590–591 (1941) (“It is well settled that the\ncourts will not attempt to exercise discretion which has\nbeen confided to a trustee unless it is clear that the trustee\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nhas abused his discretion in some manner” (emphasis\nadded)); In re Ferrall’s Estate, 92 Cal. App. 2d 712, 716–\n717, 207 P. 2d 1077, 1079–1080 (1949) (following In re\nMarre’s Estate). Three other cases are inapposite because\ntheir circumstances do not involve any allegation of abuse\nof discretion by the trustee. See In re Ziegler’s Trusts, 157\nSo. 2d 549, 550 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1963) (per curiam)\n(“There is no contention here that the court . . . would not\nretain its rights, upon appropriate petition or other plead­\nings by an interested party, to review an alleged abuse, if\nany, of the discretion exercised by the trustees”); In re\nGrubel’s Will, 37 Misc. 2d 910, 911, 235 N. Y. S. 2d 21, 23\n(Surr. Ct. 1962) (stating that “in the first instance” it is\nthe “proper function of the trustees” to set an amount to be\npaid (emphasis added)); Orr v. Moses, 94 N. H. 309, 312,\n52 A. 2d 128, 130 (1947) (declining to construe will be­\ncause none “of the parties now assert claims adverse to\nany position taken by the trustee”). In the final case, the\ncourt decided that, on the facts before it, it did not need to\ncontrol the trustees’ discretion. See Estate of Stillman,\n107 Misc. 2d 102, 111, 433 N. Y. S. 2d 701 (Surr. Ct. 1980)\n(“The fine record of the trustees in enhancing the equity of\nthese trusts while earning substantial income, also per­\nsuades the court of the wisdom of retaining their services\nas fiduciaries”). Which of these cases says that, after the\ntrustee has abused its discretion, a district court must still\ndefer to the trustee? None of them do. I repeat: Not a\nsingle case cited by the Scott treatise writers supports the\nmajority’s reading of the treatise.\n   The majority seeks to justify its reading of the Scott\ntreatise by referring to four cases that Scott does not cite.\nSee ante, at 7, n. 1. I am not surprised that the treatise\ndoes not refer to these cases. In the first three, a court\nthought it best, when a trustee had not yet exercised\njudgment about a particular matter, to direct the trustee\nto do so. See In re Sullivan’s Will, 144 Neb. 36, 40–41, 12\n12                CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nN. W. 2d 148, 150–151 (1943) (finding that the trustees’\n“failure to act” was erroneous, and directing the trustees\nto exercise their discretion in setting a payment amount);\nEaton v. Eaton, 82 N. H. 216, 218, 132 A. 10, 11 (1926)\n(same); Finch v. Wachovia Bank & Trust Co., 156 N. C.\nApp. 343, 347–348, 577 S. E. 2d 306, 309–310 (2003) (hold­\ning trustee erred by “[f]ail[ing] to exercise judgment,” and\ndirecting it to do so). The fourth case concerns circum­\nstances so distant from those before us that it is difficult to\nknow what to say. (The question was whether the benefi­\nciary of a small trust had title in certain trust assets or\nwhether the trustee had discretionary power to allocate\nthem in her best interest; the court held the latter, adding\nthat, if the trustee acted unreasonably, the lower court in\nthat particular case should seek to have the trustee re­\nmoved rather than trying to administer the trust funds\nitself.) See Hanford v. Clancy, 87 N. H. 458, 460–461, 183\nA. 271, 272–273 (1936).\n   I cannot read these four cases, or any other case to\nwhich the majority refers, as holding that a court, as a\ngeneral matter, is required to defer to a trust administra­\ntor’s second attempt at exercising discretion. And I am\naware of no such case. In contrast, the Restatement and\nBogert and Scott treatises identify numerous cases in\nwhich courts have remedied a trustee’s abuse of discretion\nby ordering the trustee to pay a specific amount. See 2\nThird Restatement §50, Reporter’s Note, at 283 (citing\ncases such as Coker v. Coker, 208 Ala. 354, 94 So. 566\n(1922)); Bogert & Bogert §560, at 223, n. 19 (citing cases\nsuch as Rubion); 3 Scott §18.2.1, at 1348–1349, nn. 3–4\n(citing cases such as Emmert v. Old Nat. Bank of Martins\nburg, 162 W. Va. 48, 246 S. E. 2d 236 (1978)); see also\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18 (listing cases).\nI thus do not find trust law “unclear” on this matter. Ante,\nat 6. When a trustee abuses its discretion, trust law\ngrants courts the authority either to defer anew to the\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          13\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntrustee’s discretion or to craft a remedy. See, e.g., 3 A.\nScott & W. Fratcher, Scott on Trusts §187, pp. 14–15 (4th\ned. 1988) (“This ordinarily means that so long as [the\ntrustee] acts not only in good faith and from proper mo­\ntives, but also within the bounds of reasonable judgment,\nthe court will not interfere; but the court will inter-\nfere when he acts outside the bounds of a reasonable\njudgment”).\n   Nor does anything in the present case suggest that the\nDistrict Court abused its remedial authority. The Second\nCircuit stated that the interpretive problem on remand\nwas in essence a remedial problem. See 433 F. 3d, at 268.\nIt added that the remedial problem was “difficul[t]” and\nthat “the district court . . . may wish to employ equitable\nprinciples when determining the appropriate calculation\nand fashioning the appropriate remedy.” Ibid. The Ad­\nministrator had previously abused his discretionary\npower. Id., at 265–268. And the District Court found that\nthe Administrator’s primary remedial suggestion on re­\nmand—adjusting respondents’ previous benefits distribu­\ntions by adding interest—probably would have violated\nERISA’s notice provisions. 472 F. Supp. 2d, at 457. Under\nthese circumstances, the District Court reasonably could\nhave found a need to use its own remedial judgment,\nrather than rely on the Administrator’s—which is just\nwhat the Second Circuit said. 535 F. 3d, at 119.\n   Moreover, even if the “narrow” trust law “question\nbefore us” were difficult, ante, at 6—which it is not—this\ndifficulty would not excuse the Court from trying to do its\nbest to work out a legal solution that nonetheless respects\nbasic principles of trust law. “Congress invoked the com­\nmon law of trusts” in enacting ERISA, and this Court has\nthus repeatedly looked to trust law in order to determine\n“the particular duties and powers” of ERISA plan adminis­\ntrators. Central States, Southeast & Southwest Areas\nPension Fund v. Central Transport, Inc., 472 U. S. 559,\n14               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n570–572 (1985); see also, e.g., Glenn, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 4); Davila, 542 U. S., at 218–219; Firestone, 489\nU. S., at 111–113. While, as the majority recognizes, ante,\nat 8, trust law may “not tell the entire story,” Varity Corp.\nv. Howe, 516 U. S. 489, 497 (1996), I am aware of no other\ncase in which this Court has simply ignored trust law (on\nthe basis that it was unclear) and crafted a legal rule\nbased on nothing but “the guiding principles we have\nidentified underlying ERISA,” ante, at 9. See Varity,\nsupra, at 497 (“In some instances, trust law will offer only\na starting point, after which courts must go on to ask\nwhether, or to what extent, the language of the statute, its\nstructure, or its purposes require departing from common­\nlaw trust requirements” (emphasis added)).\n   In any event, it is far from clear that the Court’s legal\nrule reflects an appropriate analysis of ERISA-based\npolicy. To the contrary, the majority’s absolute “one free\nhonest mistake” rule is impractical, for it requires courts\nto determine what is “honest,” encourages appeals on the\npoint, and threatens to delay further proceedings that\nalready take too long. (Respondents initially filed this\nretirement benefits case in 1999.) See Glenn, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 10). It also ignores what we previously have\npointed out—namely, that abuses of discretion “arise in\ntoo many contexts” and “concern too many circumstances”\nfor this Court “to come up with a one-size-fits-all proce­\ndural [approach] that is likely to promote fair and accu­\nrate” benefits determinations. Ibid. And, finally, the\nmajority’s approach creates incentives for administrators\nto take “one free shot” at employer-favorable plan inter­\npretations and to draft ambiguous retirement plans in the\nfirst instance with the expectation that they will have\nrepeated opportunities to interpret (and possibly reinter­\npret) the ambiguous terms. I thus fail to see how the\nmajority’s “one free honest mistake” approach furthers\nERISA’s core purpose of “promot[ing] the interests of\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

S. 85, 90\n(1983); see also, e.g., 29 U. S. C. §1001(b) (noting that\nERISA was enacted “to protect . . . employee benefit plans\nand their beneficiaries”); Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoone\njongen, 514 U. S. 73, 83 (1995) (discussing ERISA’s central\n“goa[l]” of “enab[ing] plan beneficiaries to learn their\nrights and obligations at any time”); Massachusetts Mut.\nLife Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U. S. 134, 148 (1985) (ERISA\nwas enacted “to protect contractually defined benefits”).\n   The majority does identify ERISA-related factors—e.g.,\npromoting predictability and uniformity, encouraging\nemployers to adopt strong plans—that it believes favor\ngiving more power to plan administrators. See ante, at 9–\n13. But, in my view, these factors are, at the least, offset\nby the factors discussed above—e.g., discouraging admin­\nistrators from writing opaque plans and interpreting them\naggressively—that argue to the contrary. At best, the\npolicies at issue—some arguing in one direction, some the\nother—are far less able than trust law to provide a “guid­\ning principle.” Thus, I conclude that here, as elsewhere,\ntrust law ultimately provides the best way for courts to\napproach the administration and interpretation of ERISA.\nSee, e.g., Firestone, supra, at 111–113. And trust law\nhere, as I have said, leaves to the supervising court the\ndecision as to how much weight to give to a plan adminis­\ntrator’s remedial opinion.\n                            III\n  Since the District Court was not required to defer to the\nAdministrator’s fallback position, I should consider the\nsecond question presented, namely, whether the Court of\nAppeals properly reviewed the District Court’s decision\nunder an “abuse of discretion” standard. Ante, at 4 (ac­\nknowledging, but not reaching, this issue). The answer to\nthis question depends upon how one characterizes the\n16               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nCourt of Appeals’ decision. If the court deferred to the\nDistrict Court’s interpretation of Plan terms, then the\nCourt of Appeals most likely should have reviewed the\ndecision de novo. See Firestone, supra, at 112; cf. Davila,\nsupra, at 210 (“Any dispute over the precise terms of the\nplan is resolved by a court under a de novo review stan­\ndard”). If instead the Court of Appeals deferred to the\nDistrict Court’s creation of a remedy, in significant part on\nthe basis of “equitable principles,” then it properly re­\nviewed the District Court decision for “abuse of discre­\ntion.” See, e.g., Cook v. Liberty Life Assurance Co., 320\nF. 3d 11, 24 (CA1 2003); Zervos v. Verizon N. Y., Inc., 277\nF. 3d 635, 648 (CA2 2002); Grosz-Salomon v. Paul Revere\nLife Ins. Co., 237 F. 3d 1154, 1163 (CA9 2001); Halpin v.\nW. W. Grainger, Inc., 962 F. 2d 685, 697 (CA7 1992).\n   The District Court opinion contains language that sup­\nports either characterization. On the one hand, the court\nwrote that its task was to “interpret the Plan as written.”\n472 F. Supp. 2d, at 457. On the other hand, the court said\nthat “virtually nothing is set forth in either the Plan or the\n[Summary Plan Description]” about how to treat prior\ndistributions; and, in describing its task, it said that the\nCourt of Appeals had directed it to use “equitable princi­\nples” in fashioning a remedy. Ibid. Ultimately, the Dis­\ntrict Court appears to have used both the Plan language\nand equitable principles to arrive at its conclusion. See\nid., at 457–459.\n   The Court of Appeals, too, used language that supports\nboth characterizations. Compare 535 F. 3d, at 117 (noting\nthat the District Court “applied [Plan] terms” in crafting\nits remedy), with id., at 117–119 (describing the District\nCourt’s decision as the “craft[ing]” of a “remedy” and\nacknowledging that it had directed the District Court to\nuse “equitable principles” in doing so). But the Court of\nAppeals ultimately treated the District Court’s opinion as\nif it primarily created a fair remedy. Ibid. Given the prior\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

And I consequently believe the Court of\nAppeals properly reviewed the result for an “abuse of\ndiscretion.”\n   Petitioners argue that, because respondents were seek­\ning relief under 29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B), the Court of\nAppeals was, in effect, prohibited from treating the rem­\nedy as anything other than an application of a plan’s\nterms. Brief for Petitioners 55–56; Reply Brief for Peti­\ntioners 3, and n. 8, 16–17. While this provision allows\nplaintiffs only to “enforce” or “clarify” rights or to “recover\nbenefits” “under the terms of the plan,” §1132(a)(1)(B)\n(emphasis added), it does not so limit a court’s remedial\nauthority, Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson,\n534 U. S. 204, 221 (2002) (In §1132(a)(1)(B), “Congress\nauthorized ‘a participant or beneficiary’ to bring a civil\naction . . . without referenc[ing] whether the relief sought\nis legal or equitable”). The provision thus does not pro­\nhibit a court from shaping relief through the application of\nequitable principles, as trust law plainly permits. See,\ne.g., 2 Third Restatement §50, and Comment b, at 261\n(discussing remedial options); Bogert & Bogert §870, at\n123–126 (2d rev. ed. 1995). Indeed, a court that finds, for\nexample, that an administrator provided employees with\ninadequate notice of a plan’s terms (as was true here) may\nhave no alternative but to rely significantly upon those\nprinciples. Cf. 29 U. S. C. §1104(a)(1)(D) (plan fiduciary\nmust “discharge his dut[y] . . . in accordance with the\ndocuments and instruments governing the plan insofar as\nsuch documents and instruments are consistent” with\nERISA).\n   For these reasons I would affirm the decision of the\nCourt of Appeals. And I therefore respectfully dissent\nfrom the majority’s contrary determination.\n18               CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n              AppendixREYER, J., dissenting\n                    B to the opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n                        APPENDIX\n\n                  The “Phantom Account” \n\n   This Appendix provides a simplified and illustrative\nexample of, as I understand it, how the “phantom account”\nworks. For the purposes of this Appendix, I make the\nfollowing assumptions: John worked at Xerox for 10 years\nfrom 1970 to 1980. At the time of his departure from\nXerox, he was issued a lump-sum benefits distribution of\n$140,000. He was then rehired in January 1989, and he\nworked for Xerox for 5 more years before retiring (until\nDecember 1993), earning $50,000 each year of his second\nterm of employment. I also assume that (1) Xerox’s con­\ntribution to John’s investment account was $2,500 in 1989\n(the last year such accounts were offered), (2) Xerox’s\ncontributions to John’s cash and investment accounts are\nalways made on the final day of the year, (3) the rate of\nreturn in John’s cash and investment accounts is always 5\npercent, and (4) annuity rates are also always 5 percent.\n(For the sake of simplicity, I treat all annuities as perpe­\ntuities, meaning that I calculate the present value of the\nannuities thusly: Present Value = Annual Pay­\nment/Annuity Rate.)\n   Given the above assumptions, John’s pension upon his\nretirement would be $10,500 per year ($50,000 × 1.4 per­\ncent × 15 years), which has a present value of $210,000\n($10,500/5 percent). John’s cash and investment accounts\nat the end of his fifth year would look as follows (While\nXerox’s ERISA Plan did not include cash accounts until\n1990, each employee’s opening cash account balance was\ncredited with the balance of his investment account at the\nend of 1989. The figures for John’s cash account in 1989\nthus reflect the performance of his investment account. In\naddition, all numbers are rounded to the nearest hun­\ndred):\n                        Cite as: 559 U.

In making this comparison, the Plan Administrator\nwould assume that John had never left Xerox when calcu­\nlating John’s pension. The Plan Administrator would also\nassume, when calculating the value of John’s cash and\ninvestment accounts, that the lump-sum distribution John\nhad received from Xerox had remained invested in his\naccounts. (In other words, the Plan Administrator would\ninclude the “phantom account” in his calculations. The\ntotal value of this phantom account in 1989, when John\nrejoined Xerox, is equal to John’s lump-sum distribution of\n$140,000 × 1.059, or approximately $217,200.)\n   The Plan Administrator would thus compare John’s\npension, column D, and column H to determine John’s\nbenefit. As you can see above, column H provides the\ngreatest benefit, so John’s cash account would be used to\ncalculate the benefits he would receive upon retirement.\n   Second, the Plan Administrator would “offset” John’s\nprior distribution against his current benefits to deter­\nmine the amount of benefits John would actually receive.\nThus, the Plan Administrator would take the “total” value\nof John’s cash account, including the “phantom account”\n($277,800), and subtract out the value of the “phantom\n20              CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT\n\n             AppendixREYER, J., dissenting\n                   B to the opinion of BREYER, J.\n\naccount” ($264,000). The total present value of the bene­\nfits John would receive upon his second retirement would\nthus be $13,800.\n   This means that John would receive approximately $690\nannually ($13,800 × 5 percent) upon retirement under the\nPlan Administrator’s “phantom account” approach. In\ncomparison, if John had simply been treated as a new\nemployee when he was rehired, his pension would have\nentitled him to at least $3,500 annually ($50,000 × 1.4\npercent × 5 years) upon his retirement. And the impact of\nthe “phantom account” may have been even more dramatic\nwith respect to some of the respondents in this case. See\nBrief for Respondents 24 (describing how respondent Paul\nFrommert erroneously received a report claiming that his\nretirement benefits were $2,482.00 per month, before later\ndiscovering that, because of the “phantom account,” his\nactual monthly pension was $5.31 per month); see also\nApp. 63a.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2359/", "sha1": "0dd514875104966d026a85ba4c1da118aec45d4c", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2009-046", "time_retrieved": "2010-04-22T10:53:42"}
