ANIMALFEEDS IN-\n\n              TERNATIONAL CORP. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 08–1198. Argued December 9, 2009—Decided April 27, 2010\nPetitioner shipping companies serve much of the world market for par\n  cel tankers—seagoing vessels with compartments that are separately\n  chartered to customers, such as respondent (AnimalFeeds), who wish\n  to ship liquids in small quantities. AnimalFeeds ships its goods pur\n  suant to a standard contract known in the maritime trade as a char\n  ter party. The charter party that AnimalFeeds uses contains an arbi\n  tration clause. AnimalFeeds brought a class action antitrust suit\n  against petitioners for price fixing, and that suit was consolidated\n  with similar suits brought by other charterers, including one in\n  which the Second Circuit subsequently reversed a lower court ruling\n  that the charterers’ claims were not subject to arbitration. As a con\n  sequence, the parties in this case agree that they must arbitrate their\n  antitrust dispute. AnimalFeeds sought arbitration on behalf of a\n  class of purchasers of parcel tanker transportation services. The par\n  ties agreed to submit the question whether their arbitration agree\n  ment allowed for class arbitration to a panel of arbitrators, who\n  would be bound by rules (Class Rules) developed by the American\n  Arbitration Association following Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Baz\n  zle, 539 U. S. 444. One Class Rule requires an arbitrator to deter\n  mine whether an arbitration clause permits class arbitration. The\n  parties selected an arbitration panel, designated New York City as\n  the arbitration site, and stipulated that their arbitration clause was\n  “silent” on the class arbitration issue. The panel determined that the\n  arbitration clause allowed for class arbitration, but the District Court\n  vacated the award. It concluded that the arbitrators’ award was\n  made in “manifest disregard” of the law, for had the arbitrators con\n  ducted a choice-of-law analysis, they would have applied the rule of\n2        STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    federal maritime law requiring contracts to be interpreted in light of\n    custom and usage. The Second Circuit reversed, holding that be\n    cause petitioners had cited no authority applying a maritime rule of\n    custom and usage against class arbitration, the arbitrators’ decision\n    was not in manifest disregard of maritime law; and that the arbitra\n    tors had not manifestly disregarded New York law, which had not es\n    tablished a rule against class arbitration.\nHeld: Imposing class arbitration on parties who have not agreed to au\n thorize class arbitration is inconsistent with the Federal Arbitration\n Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. §1 et seq. Pp. 7–23.\n    (a) The arbitration panel exceeded its powers by imposing its own\n policy choice instead of identifying and applying a rule of decision de\n rived from the FAA or from maritime or New York law. Pp. 7–12.\n       (1) An arbitration decision may be vacated under FAA §10(a)(4)\n on the ground that the arbitrator exceeded his powers, “only when\n [an] arbitrator strays from interpretation and application of the\n agreement and effectively ‘dispense[s] his own brand of industrial\n justice,’ ” Major League Baseball Players Assn. v. Garvey, 532 U. S.\n 504, 509 (per curiam), for an arbitrator’s task is to interpret and en\n force a contract, not to make public policy. P. 7.\n       (2) The arbitration panel appears to have rested its decision on\n AnimalFeeds’ public policy argument for permitting class arbitration\n under the charter party’s arbitration clause. However, because the\n parties agreed that their agreement was “silent” on the class arbitra\n tion issue, the arbitrators’ proper task was to identify the rule of law\n governing in that situation. Instead, the panel based its decision on\n post-Bazzle arbitral decisions without mentioning whether they were\n based on a rule derived from the FAA or on maritime or New York\n law. Rather than inquiring whether those bodies of law contained a\n “default rule” permitting an arbitration clause to allow class arbitra\n tion absent express consent, the panel proceeded as if it had a com\n mon-law court’s authority to develop what it viewed as the best rule\n for such a situation. Finding no reason to depart from its perception\n of a post-Bazzle consensus among arbitrators that class arbitration\n was beneficial in numerous settings, the panel simply imposed its\n own conception of sound policy and permitted class arbitration. The\n panel’s few references to intent do not show that the panel did any\n thing other than impose its own policy preference. Thus, under FAA\n §10(b), this Court must either “direct a rehearing by the arbitrators”\n or decide the question originally referred to the panel. Because there\n can be only one possible outcome on the facts here, there is no need to\n direct a rehearing by the arbitrators. Pp. 7–12.\n    (b) Bazzle did not control resolution of the question whether the in\n stant charter party permits arbitration to proceed on behalf of this\n                   Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nclass. Pp. 12–17.\n      (1) No single rationale commanded a majority in Bazzle, which\nconcerned contracts between a commercial lender and its customers\nthat had an arbitration clause that did not expressly mention class\narbitration. The plurality decided only the question whether the\ncourt or arbitrator should decide whether the contracts were “silent”\non the class arbitration issue, concluding that it was the arbitrator.\nJUSTICE STEVENS’ opinion bypassed that question, resting instead on\nhis resolution of the questions of what standard the appropriate deci\nsionmaker should apply in determining whether a contract allows\nclass arbitration, and whether, under whatever standard is appropri\nate, class arbitration had been properly ordered in the case at hand.\nPp. 12–15.\n      (2) The Bazzle opinions appear to have baffled these parties at\ntheir arbitration proceeding. For one thing, the parties appear to\nhave believed that Bazzle requires an arbitrator, not a court, to de\ncide whether a contract permits class arbitration, a question ad\ndressed only by the plurality. That question need not be revisited\nhere because the parties expressly assigned that issue to the arbitra\ntion panel, and no party argues that this assignment was impermis\nsible. Both the parties and the arbitration panel also seem to have\nmisunderstood Bazzle as establishing the standard to be applied in\ndeciding whether class arbitration is permitted. However, Bazzle left\nthat question open. Pp. 15–17.\n   (c) Imposing class arbitration here is inconsistent with the FAA.\nPp. 17–23.\n      (1) The FAA imposes rules of fundamental importance, including\nthe basic precept that arbitration “is a matter of consent, not coer\ncion.” Volt v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489\nU. S. 468, 479. The FAA requires that a “written provision in any\nmaritime transaction” calling for the arbitration of a controversy\narising out of such transaction “shall be valid, irrevocable, and en\nforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the\nrevocation of any contract,” 9 U. S. C. §2, and permits a party to an\narbitration agreement to petition a federal district court for an order\ndirecting that arbitration proceed “in the manner provided for in such\nagreement,” §4. Thus, this Court has said that the FAA’s central\npurpose is to ensure that “private agreements to arbitrate are en\nforced according to their terms.” Volt, 489 U. S., at 479. Whether en\nforcing an agreement to arbitrate or construing an arbitration clause,\ncourts and arbitrators must “give effect to the [parties’] contractual\nrights and expectations.” Ibid. The parties’ “intentions control,”\nMitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S.\n614, 626, and the parties are “generally free to structure their arbi\n4        STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tration agreements as they see fit,” Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman\n    Hutton, Inc., 514 U. S. 52, 57. They may agree to limit the issues ar\n    bitrated and may agree on rules under which an arbitration will pro\n    ceed. They may also specify with whom they choose to arbitrate their\n    disputes. See EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U. S. 279, 289.\n    Pp. 17–20.\n         (2) It follows that a party may not be compelled under the FAA to\n    submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for con\n    cluding that the party agreed to do so. Here, the arbitration panel\n    imposed class arbitration despite the parties’ stipulation that they\n    had reached “no agreement” on that issue. The panel’s conclusion is\n    fundamentally at war with the foundational FAA principle that arbi\n    tration is a matter of consent. It may be appropriate to presume that\n    parties to an arbitration agreement implicitly authorize the arbitra\n    tor to adopt those procedures necessary to give effect to the parties’\n    agreement. See Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79,\n    84. But an implicit agreement to authorize class action arbitration is\n    not a term that the arbitrator may infer solely from the fact of an\n    agreement to arbitrate. The differences between simple bilateral and\n    complex class action arbitration are too great for such a presumption.\n    Pp. 20–23.\n548 F. 3d 85, reversed and remanded.\n\n  ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS, C.

The parties agree that as a consequence of\nthese judgments and orders, AnimalFeeds and petitioners\nmust arbitrate their antitrust dispute.\n                              B\n   In 2005, AnimalFeeds served petitioners with a demand\nfor class arbitration, designating New York City as the\nplace of arbitration and seeking to represent a class of\n“[a]ll direct purchasers of parcel tanker transportation\nservices globally for bulk liquid chemicals, edible oils,\nacids, and other specialty liquids from [petitioners] at any\ntime during the period from August 1, 1998, to November\n30, 2002.” 548 F. 3d 85, 87 (CA2 2008) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The parties entered into a supplemental\nagreement providing for the question of class arbitration\nto be submitted to a panel of three arbitrators who were to\n“follow and be bound by Rules 3 through 7 of the American\nArbitration Association’s Supplementary Rules for Class\nArbitrations (as effective Oct. 8, 2003).” App. to Pet. for\nCert. 59a. These rules (hereinafter Class Rules) were\ndeveloped by the American Arbitration Association (AAA)\nafter our decision in Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Bazzle,\n4     STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n539 U. S. 444 (2003), and Class Rule 3, in accordance with\nthe plurality opinion in that case, requires an arbitrator,\nas a threshold matter, to determine “whether the applica­\nble arbitration clause permits the arbitration to proceed\non behalf of or against a class.” App. 56a.\n   The parties selected a panel of arbitrators and stipu­\nlated that the arbitration clause was “silent” with respect\nto class arbitration. Counsel for AnimalFeeds explained to\nthe arbitration panel that the term “silent” did not simply\nmean that the clause made no express reference to class\narbitration. Rather, he said, “[a]ll the parties agree that\nwhen a contract is silent on an issue there’s been no\nagreement that has been reached on that issue.” Id.,\nat 77a.\n   After hearing argument and evidence, including testi­\nmony from petitioners’ experts regarding arbitration\ncustoms and usage in the maritime trade, the arbitrators\nconcluded that the arbitration clause allowed for class\narbitration. They found persuasive the fact that other\narbitrators ruling after Bazzle had construed “a wide\nvariety of clauses in a wide variety of settings as allowing\nfor class arbitration,” but the panel acknowledged that\nnone of these decisions was “exactly comparable” to the\npresent dispute. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a–50a.\nPetitioners’ expert evidence did not show an “inten[t] to\npreclude class arbitration,” the arbitrators reasoned, and\npetitioners’ argument would leave “no basis for a class\naction absent express agreement among all parties and\nthe putative class members.” Id., at 51a.\n   The arbitrators stayed the proceeding to allow the par­\nties to seek judicial review, and petitioners filed an appli­\ncation to vacate the arbitrators’ award in the District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York.

Had such an analysis been conducted,\nthe District Court held, the arbitrators would have applied\nthe rule of federal maritime law requiring that contracts\nbe interpreted in light of custom and usage. 435 F. Supp.\n2d, at 385–386.\n   AnimalFeeds appealed to the Court of Appeals, which\nreversed. See 9 U. S. C. §16(a)(1)(E) (“An appeal may be\ntaken from . . . an order . . . vacating an award”). As an\ninitial matter, the Court of Appeals held that the “mani­\nfest disregard” standard survived our decision in Hall\nStreet Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. 576\n(2008), as a “judicial gloss” on the enumerated grounds for\nvacatur of arbitration awards under 9 U. S. C. §10. 548\nF. 3d, at 94. Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals concluded\nthat, because petitioners had cited no authority applying a\nfederal maritime rule of custom and usage against class\narbitration, the arbitrators’ decision was not in manifest\ndisregard of federal maritime law. Id., at 97–98. Nor had\nthe arbitrators manifestly disregarded New York law, the\nCourt of Appeals continued, since nothing in New York\n6        STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v.

S. ___ (2009).2\n\n——————\n    2 Invokingan argument not pressed in or considered by the courts\nbelow, the dissent concludes that the question presented is not ripe for\nour review. See post, at 1, 3–6 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.). In so doing,\nthe dissent offers no clear justification for now embracing an argument\n“we necessarily considered and rejected” in granting certiorari. United\nStates v. Williams, 504 U. S. 36, 40 (1992). Ripeness reflects constitu­\ntional considerations that implicate “Article III limitations on judicial\npower,” as well as “prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdic­\ntion.” Reno v. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S. 43, 57, n. 18\n(1993). In evaluating a claim to determine whether it is ripe for judicial\nreview, we consider both “the fitness of the issues for judicial decision”\nand “the hardship of withholding court consideration.” National Park\nHospitality Assn. v. Department of Interior, 538 U. S. 803, 808 (2003).\nTo the extent the dissent believes that the question on which we\ngranted certiorari is constitutionally unripe for review, we disagree.\nThe arbitration panel’s award means that petitioners must now submit\nto class determination proceedings before arbitrators who, if petitioners\nare correct, have no authority to require class arbitration absent the\nparties’ agreement to resolve their disputes on that basis. See Class\nRule 4(a) (cited in App. 57a); Brief for American Arbitration Association\nas Amicus Curiae 17. Should petitioners refuse to proceed with what\nthey maintain is essentially an ultra vires proceeding, they would\nalmost certainly be subject to a petition to compel arbitration under 9\nU. S. C. §4. Cf. Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U. S. 102,\n143 (1974) (“Where the inevitability of the operation of a statute\nagainst certain individuals is patent, it is irrelevant to the existence of\na justiciable controversy that there will be a time delay before the\ndisputed provisions will come into effect”). We think it is clear on these\nfacts that petitioners have demonstrated sufficient hardship, and that\ntheir question is fit for our review at this time. To the extent the\ndissent believes that the question is prudentially unripe, we reject that\nargument as waived, Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51, 56,\nn. 4 (2002), and we see no reason to disregard the waiver.

It is not enough for peti­\ntioners to show that the panel committed an error—or\neven a serious error. See Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v.\nMine Workers, 531 U.

In this case, we must conclude that what the arbi­\ntration panel did was simply to impose its own view of\nsound policy regarding class arbitration.3\n                         B\n                         1\n  In its memorandum of law filed in the arbitration pro­\n——————\n  3 We  do not decide whether “ ‘manifest disregard’ ” survives our deci­\nsion in Hall Street Associates, L.

Animal-\nFeeds characterizes that standard as requiring a showing that the\narbitrators “knew of the relevant [legal] principle, appreciated that this\nprinciple controlled the outcome of the disputed issue, and nonetheless\nwillfully flouted the governing law by refusing to apply it.” Brief for\nRespondent 25 (internal quotation marks omitted). Assuming, ar\nguendo, that such a standard applies, we find it satisfied for the rea­\nsons that follow.\n8     STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nceedings, AnimalFeeds made three arguments in sup-\nport of construing the arbitration clause to permit class\narbitration:\n       “The parties’ arbitration clause should be construed\n    to allow class arbitration because (a) the clause is si-\n    lent on the issue of class treatment and, without ex-\n    press prohibition, class arbitration is permitted under\n    Bazzle; (b) the clause should be construed to permit\n    class arbitration as a matter of public policy; and (c)\n    the clause would be unconscionable and unenforceable\n    if it forbade class arbitration.” App. in No. 06–3474–\n    cv (CA2), at A–308 to A–309 (emphasis added).\n   The arbitrators expressly rejected AnimalFeeds’ first\nargument, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a, and said nothing\nabout the third. Instead, the panel appears to have rested\nits decision on AnimalFeeds’ public policy argument.\nBecause the parties agreed their agreement was “silent” in\nthe sense that they had not reached any agreement on the\nissue of class arbitration, the arbitrators’ proper task was\nto identify the rule of law that governs in that situation.\nHad they engaged in that undertaking, they presumably\nwould have looked either to the FAA itself or to one of the\ntwo bodies of law that the parties claimed were governing,\ni.e., either federal maritime law or New York law. But the\npanel did not consider whether the FAA provides the rule\nof decision in such a situation; nor did the panel attempt\nto determine what rule would govern under either mari-\ntime or New York law in the case of a “silent” contract.\nInstead, the panel based its decision on post-Bazzle arbi-\ntral decisions that “construed a wide variety of clauses in a\nwide variety of settings as allowing for class arbitration.”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 49a–50a. The panel did not mention\nwhether any of these decisions were based on a rule de-\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

Perceiving a post-Bazzle consensus among\narbitrators that class arbitration is beneficial in “a wide\nvariety of settings,” the panel considered only whether\nthere was any good reason not to follow that consensus in\nthis case. App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a–50a. The panel was\nnot persuaded by “court cases denying consolidation of\narbitrations,”5 by undisputed evidence that the Vegoilvoy\ncharter party had “never been the basis of a class action,”\nor by expert opinion that “sophisticated, multinational\ncommercial parties of the type that are sought to be in­\n——————\n  4 The panel’s reliance on these arbitral awards confirms that the\n\npanel’s decision was not based on a determination regarding the\nparties’ intent. All of the arbitral awards were made under the AAA’s\nClass Rules, which were adopted in 2003, and thus none was available\nwhen the parties here entered into the Vegoilvoy charter party during\nthe class period ranging from 1998 to 2002. See 548 F. 3d 85, 87 (CA2\n2008) (defining the class period). Indeed, at the hearing before the\npanel, counsel for AnimalFeeds conceded that “[w]hen you talk about\nexpectations, virtually every one of the arbitration clauses that were\nthe subject of the 25 AAA decisions were drafted before [Bazzle]. So\ntherefore, if you are going to talk about the parties’ intentions, pre\n[Bazzle] class arbitrations were not common, post [Bazzle] they are\ncommon.” App. 87a. Moreover, in its award, the panel appeared to\nacknowledge that none of the cited arbitration awards involved a\ncontract between sophisticated business entities. See App. to Pet. for\nCert. 50a.\n  5 See Government of United Kingdom v. Boeing Co., 998 F. 2d 68, 71,\n\n74 (CA2 1993); see also Glencore, Ltd. v. Schnitzer Steel Prods. Co., 189\nF. 3d 264, 268 (CA2 1999); Champ v. Siegel Trading Co., 55 F. 3d 269,\n275 (CA7 1995). Unlike the subsequent arbitration awards that the\narbitrators cited, these decisions were available to the parties when\nthey entered into their contracts.\n10     STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncluded in the class would never intend that the arbitration\nclauses would permit a class arbitration.”6 Id., at 50a–\n——————\n   6 Petitioners produced expert evidence from experienced maritime\n\narbitrators demonstrating that it is customary in the shipping business\nfor parties to resolve their disputes through bilateral arbitration. See,\ne.g., App. 126a (expert declaration of John Kimball) (“In the 30 years I\nhave been practicing as a maritime lawyer, I have never encountered\nan arbitration clause in a charter party that could be construed as\nallowing class action arbitration”); id., at 139a (expert declaration of\nBruce Harris) (“I have been working as a maritime arbitrator for thirty\nyears and this matter is the first I have ever encountered where the\nissue of a class action arbitration has even been raised”). These experts\namplified their written statements in their live testimony, as well. See,\ne.g., App. 112a, 113a (Mr. Kimball) (opining that the prospect of a class\naction in a maritime arbitration would be “quite foreign” to overseas\nshipping executives and charterers); id., at 111a–112a (Mr. Harris)\n(opining that in the view of the London Corps of International Arbitra­\ntion, class arbitration is “inconceivable”).\n   Under both New York law and general maritime law, evidence of\n“custom and usage” is relevant to determining the parties’ intent when\nan express agreement is ambiguous.

Accordingly, finding no convincing ground for depart­\ning from the post-Bazzle arbitral consensus, the panel held\nthat class arbitration was permitted in this case. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 52a. The conclusion is inescapable that the\npanel simply imposed its own conception of sound policy.7\n                              2\n  It is true that the panel opinion makes a few references\nto intent, but none of these shows that the panel did any­\nthing other than impose its own policy preference. The\nopinion states that, under Bazzle, “arbitrators must look\nto the language of the parties’ agreement to ascertain the\nparties’ intention whether they intended to permit or to\npreclude class action,” and the panel added that “[t]his is\nalso consistent with New York law.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n49a. But the panel had no occasion to “ascertain the\nparties’ intention” in the present case because the parties\nwere in complete agreement regarding their intent. In the\nvery next sentence after the one quoted above, the panel\n——————\ncustoms” and the “custom of the sea . . . includes a customary interpre­\ntation of contract language”).\n   7 The dissent calls this conclusion “hardly fair,” noting that the word\n\n“ ‘policy’ is not so much as mentioned in the arbitrators’ award.” Post,\nat 8. But just as merely saying something is so does not make it so, cf.\nUnited States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 614 (2000), the arbitrators\nneed not have said they were relying on policy to make it so. At the\nhearing before the arbitration panel, one of the arbitrators recognized\nthat the body of post-Bazzle arbitration awards on which AnimalFeeds\nrelied involved “essentially consumer non-value cases.” App. 82a. In\nresponse, counsel for AnimalFeeds defended the applicability of those\nawards by asserting that the “vast majority” of the claimants against\npetitioners “have negative value claims . . . meaning it costs more to\nlitigate than you would get if you won.” Id., at 82a–83a. The panel\ncredited this body of awards in concluding that petitioners had not\ndemonstrated the parties’ intent to preclude class arbitration, and\nfurther observed that if petitioners’ anticonsolidation precedents\ncontrolled, then “there would appear to be no basis for a class action\nabsent express agreement among all parties and the putative class\nmembers.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a, 51a.\n12    STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nacknowledged that the parties in this case agreed that the\nVegoilvoy charter party was “silent on whether [it] per­\nmit[ted] or preclude[d] class arbitration,” but that the\ncharter party was “not ambiguous so as to call for parol\nevidence.” Ibid. This stipulation left no room for an in­\nquiry regarding the parties’ intent, and any inquiry into\nthat settled question would have been outside the panel’s\nassigned task.\n   The panel also commented on the breadth of the lan­\nguage in the Vegoilvoy charter party, see id., at 50a, but\nsince the only task that was left for the panel, in light of\nthe parties’ stipulation, was to identify the governing rule\napplicable in a case in which neither the language of the\ncontract nor any other evidence established that the par­\nties had reached any agreement on the question of class\narbitration, the particular wording of the charter party\nwas quite beside the point.\n   In sum, instead of identifying and applying a rule of\ndecision derived from the FAA or either maritime or New\nYork law, the arbitration panel imposed its own policy\nchoice and thus exceeded its powers. As a result, under\n§10(b) of the FAA, we must either “direct a rehearing by\nthe arbitrators” or decide the question that was originally\nreferred to the panel. Because we conclude that there can\nbe only one possible outcome on the facts before us, we see\nno need to direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n  The arbitration panel thought that Bazzle “controlled”\nthe “resolution” of the question whether the Vegoilvoy\ncharter party “permit[s] this arbitration to proceed on\nbehalf of a class,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a–49a, but that\nunderstanding was incorrect.\n  Bazzle concerned contracts between a commercial lender\n(Green Tree) and its customers.

Nevertheless, an arbitrator conducted\nclass arbitration proceedings and entered awards for the\ncustomers.\n   The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the\nawards. Bazzle v. Green Tree Financial Corp., 351 S. C.\n244, 569 S. E. 2d 349 (2002). After discussing both Sev-\nenth Circuit precedent holding that a court lacks authority\nto order classwide arbitration under §4 of the FAA, see\nChamp v. Siegel Trading Co., 55 F. 3d 269 (1995), and\nconflicting California precedent, see Keating v. Superior\nCourt of Alameda Cty., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1231723\"><a href=\"/opinion/1231723/keating-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">584</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 645 P. 2d 1192\n(1982), the State Supreme Court elected to follow the\nCalifornia approach, which it characterized as permitting\na trial court to “order class-wide arbitration under adhe-\nsive but enforceable franchise contracts,” 351 S. C., at 259,\n266, 569 S. E. 2d, at 357, 360. Under this approach, the\nSouth Carolina court observed, a trial judge must\n“[b]alanc[e] the potential inequities and inefficiencies” of\nrequiring each aggrieved party to proceed on an individual\nbasis against “resulting prejudice to the drafting party”\nand should take into account factors such as “efficiency”\nand “equity.” Id., at 260, and n. 15, 569 S. E. 2d, at 357,\nand n. 15.\n   Applying these standards to the case before it, the South\nCarolina Supreme Court found that the arbitration clause\nin the Green Tree contracts was “silent regarding class-\nwide arbitration.” Id., at 263, 569 S. E. 2d, at 359\n(emphasis deleted). The Court described its holding as\nfollows:\n    “[W]e . . . hold that class-wide arbitration may be or-\n    dered when the arbitration agreement is silent if it\n    would serve efficiency and equity, and would not re-\n    sult in prejudice. If we enforced a mandatory, adhe-\n    sive arbitration clause, but prohibited class actions in\n14    STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n     arbitration where the agreement is silent, the drafting\n     party could effectively prevent class actions against\n     it without having to say it was doing so in the\n     agreement.” Id., at 266, 569 S. E. 2d, at 360 (footnote\n     omitted).\n   When Bazzle reached this Court, no single rationale\ncommanded a majority. The opinions of the Justices who\njoined the judgment—that is, the plurality opinion and\nJUSTICE STEVENS’ opinion—collectively addressed three\nseparate questions. The first was which decision maker\n(court or arbitrator) should decide whether the contracts\nin question were “silent” on the issue of class arbitration.\nThe second was what standard the appropriate decision\nmaker should apply in determining whether a contract\nallows class arbitration. (For example, does the FAA\nentirely preclude class arbitration? Does the FAA permit\nclass arbitration only under limited circumstances, such\nas when the contract expressly so provides? Or is this\nquestion left entirely to state law?) The final question was\nwhether, under whatever standard is appropriate, class\narbitration had been properly ordered in the case\nat hand.\n   The plurality opinion decided only the first question,\nconcluding that the arbitrator and not a court should\ndecide whether the contracts were indeed “silent” on the\nissue of class arbitration. The plurality noted that, “[i]n\ncertain limited circumstances,” involving “gateway mat­\nters, such as whether the parties have a valid arbitration\nagreement at all or whether a concededly binding arbitra­\ntion clause applies to a certain type of controversy,” it is\nassumed “that the parties intended courts, not arbitra­\ntors,” to make the decision. 539 U. S., at 452. But the\nplurality opined that the question whether a contract with\nan arbitration clause forbids class arbitration “does not\nfall into this narrow exception.” Ibid. The plurality there­\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfore concluded that the decision of the State Supreme\nCourt should be vacated and that the case should be re­\nmanded for a decision by the arbitrator on the question\nwhether the contracts were indeed “silent.” The plurality\ndid not decide either the second or the third question\nnoted above.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS concurred in the judgment vacating\nand remanding because otherwise there would have been\n“no controlling judgment of the Court,” but he did not\nendorse the plurality’s rationale. Id., at 455 (opinion\nconcurring in judgment and dissenting in part). He did\nnot take a definitive position on the first question, stating\nonly that “[a]rguably the interpretation of the parties’\nagreement should have been made in the first instance by\nthe arbitrator.” Ibid. (emphasis added). But because he\ndid not believe that Green Tree had raised the question of\nthe appropriate decision maker, he preferred not to reach\nthat question and, instead, would have affirmed the deci­\nsion of the State Supreme Court on the ground that “the\ndecision to conduct a class-action arbitration was correct\nas a matter of law.” Ibid. Accordingly, his analysis by­\npassed the first question noted above and rested instead\non his resolution of the second and third questions. Thus,\nBazzle did not yield a majority decision on any of the three\nquestions.\n                              B\n   Unfortunately, the opinions in Bazzle appear to have\nbaffled the parties in this case at the time of the arbitra­\ntion proceeding. For one thing, the parties appear to have\nbelieved that the judgment in Bazzle requires an arbitra­\ntor, not a court, to decide whether a contract permits class\narbitration. See App. 89a (transcript of argument before\narbitration panel) (counsel for Stolt-Nielsen states: “What\n[Bazzle] says is that the contract interpretation issue is\nleft up to the arbitrator, that’s the rule in [Bazzle]”). In\n16     STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfact, however, only the plurality decided that question.\nBut we need not revisit that question here because the\nparties’ supplemental agreement expressly assigned this\nissue to the arbitration panel, and no party argues that\nthis assignment was impermissible.\n  Unfortunately, however, both the parties and the arbi-\ntration panel seem to have misunderstood Bazzle in an-\nother respect, namely, that it established the standard to\nbe applied by a decision maker in determining whether a\ncontract may permissibly be interpreted to allow class\narbitration. The arbitration panel began its discussion\nby stating that the parties “differ regarding the rule of\ninterpretation to be gleaned from [the Bazzle] decision.”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 49a (emphasis added). The panel\ncontinued:\n     “Claimants argue that Bazzle requires clear language\n     that forbids class arbitration in order to bar a class\n     action. The Panel, however, agrees with Respondents\n     that the test is a more general one—arbitrators must\n     look to the language of the parties’ agreement to as-\n     certain the parties’ intention whether they intended to\n     permit or to preclude class action.” Ibid.\nAs we have explained, however, Bazzle did not establish\nthe rule to be applied in deciding whether class arbitration\nis permitted.8 The decision in Bazzle left that question\n——————\n  8 AnimalFeeds   invokes the parties’ supplemental agreement as evi-\ndence that petitioners “waived” any claim that the arbitrators could not\nconstrue the arbitration agreement to permit class arbitration. Brief\nfor Respondent 15. The dissent concludes, likewise, that the existence\nof the parties’ supplemental agreement renders petitioners’ argument\nunder §10(a)(4) “scarcely debatable.” Post, at 7. These arguments are\neasily answered by the clear terms of the supplemental agreement\nitself. The parties expressly provided that their supplemental agree-\nment “does not alter the scope of the Parties’ arbitration agreements in\nany Charter Party Agreement,” and that “[n]either the fact of this\nAgreement nor any of its terms may be used to support or oppose any\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

As with any agreement to arbitrate, we are obliged to enforce\nthe parties’ supplemental agreement “according to its terms.” Mastro\nbuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U. S. 52, 58 (1995). The\nquestion that the arbitration panel was charged with deciding was\nwhether the arbitration clause in the Vegoilvoy charter party allowed\nfor class arbitration, and nothing in the supplemental agreement\nconferred authority on the arbitrators to exceed the terms of the charter\nparty itself. Thus, contrary to AnimalFeeds’ argument, these state­\nments show that petitioners did not waive their argument that Bazzle\ndid not establish the standard for the decision maker to apply when\nconstruing an arbitration clause.\n   9 See generally Sturges & Murphy, Some Confusing Matters Relating\n\nto Arbitration Under the United States Arbitration Act, 17 Law &\nContemp.

Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U. S.\n52, 57, 58 (1995); see also Doctor’s Associates, Inc. v.\nCasarotto, 517 U. S. 681, 688 (1996). See generally 9\nU. S. C. §4.\n   Whether enforcing an agreement to arbitrate or constru­\ning an arbitration clause, courts and arbitrators must\n“give effect to the contractual rights and expectations of\nthe parties.” Volt, supra, at 479. In this endeavor, “as\nwith any other contract, the parties’ intentions control.”\nMitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,\n473 U. S. 614, 626 (1985). This is because an arbitrator\nderives his or her powers from the parties’ agreement to\nforgo the legal process and submit their disputes to pri­\nvate dispute resolution.

It falls to courts and\narbitrators to give effect to these contractual limitations,\nand when doing so, courts and arbitrators must not lose\nsight of the purpose of the exercise: to give effect to the\nintent of the parties. Volt, 489 U. S., at 479.\n                              B\n   From these principles, it follows that a party may not be\ncompelled under the FAA to submit to class arbitration\nunless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the\nparty agreed to do so. In this case, however, the arbitra­\ntion panel imposed class arbitration even though the\nparties concurred that they had reached “no agreement”\non that issue, see App. 77a. The critical point, in the view\nof the arbitration panel, was that petitioners did not “es­\ntablish that the parties to the charter agreements in­\ntended to preclude class arbitration.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n51a. Even though the parties are sophisticated business\nentities, even though there is no tradition of class arbitra­\ntion under maritime law, and even though AnimalFeeds\ndoes not dispute that it is customary for the shipper to\nchoose the charter party that is used for a particular\nshipment, the panel regarded the agreement’s silence on\nthe question of class arbitration as dispositive. The\npanel’s conclusion is fundamentally at war with the foun­\ndational FAA principle that arbitration is a matter of\nconsent.\n   In certain contexts, it is appropriate to presume that\nparties that enter into an arbitration agreement implicitly\nauthorize the arbitrator to adopt such procedures as are\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnecessary to give effect to the parties’ agreement. Thus,\nwe have said that “ ‘ “procedural” questions which grow out\nof the dispute and bear on its final disposition’ are pre­\nsumptively not for the judge, but for an arbitrator, to\ndecide.” Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S.\n79, 84 (2002) (quoting John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v.\nLivingston, 376 U. S. 543, 557 (1964)). This recognition is\ngrounded in the background principle that “[w]hen the\nparties to a bargain sufficiently defined to be a contract\nhave not agreed with respect to a term which is essential\nto a determination of their rights and duties, a term which\nis reasonable in the circumstances is supplied by the\ncourt.” Restatement (Second) of Contracts §204 (1979).\n   An implicit agreement to authorize class-action arbitra­\ntion, however, is not a term that the arbitrator may infer\nsolely from the fact of the parties’ agreement to arbitrate.\nThis is so because class-action arbitration changes the\nnature of arbitration to such a degree that it cannot be\npresumed the parties consented to it by simply agreeing to\nsubmit their disputes to an arbitrator. In bilateral arbi­\ntration, parties forgo the procedural rigor and appellate\nreview of the courts in order to realize the benefits of\nprivate dispute resolution: lower costs, greater efficiency\nand speed, and the ability to choose expert adjudicators to\nresolve specialized disputes.        See Gilmer v. Inter\nstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 31 (1991); Mitsu\nbishi Motors, 473 U. S., at 628; see also 14 Penn Plaza\nLLC v. Pyett, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip. op., at 7–8)\n(“Parties generally favor arbitration precisely because of\nthe economics of dispute resolution” (citing Circuit City\nStores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U. S. 105, 123 (2001)); Gardner-\nDenver, supra, at 57 (“Parties usually choose an arbitrator\nbecause they trust his knowledge and judgment concern­\ning the demands and norms of industrial relations”). But\nthe relative benefits of class-action arbitration are much\nless assured, giving reason to doubt the parties’ mutual\n22    STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconsent to resolve disputes through class-wide arbitration.\nCf. First Options, supra, at 945 (noting that “one can\nunderstand why courts might hesitate to interpret silence\nor ambiguity on the ‘who should decide arbitrability’ point\nas giving the arbitrators that power, for doing so might too\noften force unwilling parties to arbitrate” contrary to their\nexpectations).\n   Consider just some of the fundamental changes brought\nabout by the shift from bilateral arbitration to class-action\narbitration. An arbitrator chosen according to an agreed­\nupon procedure, see, e.g., supra, at 2, no longer resolves a\nsingle dispute between the parties to a single agreement,\nbut instead resolves many disputes between hundreds or\nperhaps even thousands of parties. See App. 86a (“[W]e\nbelieve domestic class members could be in the hundreds”\nand that “[t]here could be class members that ship to and\nfrom the U. S. who are not domestic who we think would\nbe covered”); see also, e.g., Bazzle, 351 S. C., at 251, 569\nS. E. 2d, at 352–353 (involving a class of 1,899 individuals\nthat was awarded damages, fees, and costs of more than\n$14 million by a single arbitrator). Under the Class Rules,\n“the presumption of privacy and confidentiality” that\napplies in many bilateral arbitrations “shall not apply in\nclass arbitrations,” see Addendum to Brief for American\nArbitration Association as Amicus Curiae 10a (Class Rule\n9(a)), thus potentially frustrating the parties’ assumptions\nwhen they agreed to arbitrate. The arbitrator’s award no\nlonger purports to bind just the parties to a single arbitra­\ntion agreement, but adjudicates the rights of absent par­\nties as well. Cf. Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U. S. 815,\n846 (1999) (noting that “the burden of justification rests on\nthe exception” to the general rule that “one is not bound by\na judgment in personam in a litigation in which he is not\ndesignated as a party or to which he has not been made a\nparty by service of process” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). And the commercial stakes of class-action\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

We\nthink that the differences between bilateral and class­\naction arbitration are too great for arbitrators to presume,\nconsistent with their limited powers under the FAA, that\nthe parties’ mere silence on the issue of class-action arbi­\ntration constitutes consent to resolve their disputes in\nclass proceedings.10\n   The dissent minimizes these crucial differences by\ncharacterizing the question before the arbitrators as being\nmerely what “procedural mode” was available to present\nAnimalFeeds’ claims. Post, at 9. If the question were that\nsimple, there would be no need to consider the parties’\nintent with respect to class arbitration. See Howsam,\nsupra, at 84 (committing “procedural questions” presump­\ntively to the arbitrator’s discretion (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). But the FAA requires more. Contrary to\nthe dissent, but consistent with our precedents emphasiz­\ning the consensual basis of arbitration, we see the ques­\ntion as being whether the parties agreed to authorize class\narbitration. Here, where the parties stipulated that there\nwas “no agreement” on this question, it follows that the\nparties cannot be compelled to submit their dispute to\nclass arbitration.\n                             V\n   For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nis reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceed­\nings consistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n——————\n  10 We have no occasion to decide what contractual basis may support\na finding that the parties agreed to authorize class-action arbitration.\nHere, as noted, the parties stipulated that there was “no agreement” on\nthe issue of class-action arbitration.

That court\naction terminated when the Second Circuit held, first, that\nthe parties’ transactions were governed by contracts (char\nter parties) with enforceable arbitration clauses, and\nsecond, that the antitrust claims were arbitrable. JLM\nIndustries, Inc. v. Stolt-Nielsen S. A., 387 F. 3d 163, 175,\n181 (2004).\n   Cargo-shipper AnimalFeeds International Corp. (Ani\nmalFeeds) thereupon filed a demand for class arbitration\nof the antitrust-conspiracy claims.3 Stolt-Nielsen con\ntested AnimalFeeds’ right to proceed on behalf of a class,\nbut agreed to submission of that threshold dispute to a\npanel of arbitrators. Thus, the parties entered into a\nsupplemental agreement to choose arbitrators and in\nstruct them to “follow . . .

The Court of Appeals upheld the award: “Be\ncause the parties specifically agreed that the arbitration\npanel would decide whether the arbitration claus[e] per\nmitted class arbitration,” the Second Circuit reasoned,\n“the arbitration panel did not exceed its authority in decid\ning that issue—irrespective of whether it decided the issue\ncorrectly.” 548 F. 3d 85, 101 (2008).\n                                II\n   I consider, first, the fitness of the arbitrators’ clause\nconstruction award for judicial review. The arbitrators\ndecided the issue, in accord with the parties’ supplemental\nagreement, “as a threshold matter.” App. 56a. Their\ndecision that the charter-party arbitration clause permit\nted class arbitration was abstract and highly interlocu\ntory. The panel did not decide whether the particular\nclaims AnimalFeeds advanced were suitable for class\nresolution, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a–49a; much less\ndid it delineate any class or consider whether, “if a class is\ncertified, . . . members of the putative class should be\nrequired to ‘opt in’ to th[e] proceeding,” id., at 52a.\n   The Court, ante, at 6, n. 2, does not persuasively justify\njudicial intervention so early in the game or convincingly\nreconcile its adjudication with the firm final-judgment\nrule prevailing in the federal court system. See, e.g., 28\nU. S. C. §1257 (providing for petitions for certiorari from\n“[f]inal judgments or decrees” of state courts); §1291 (pro\nviding for Court of Appeals review of district court “final\ndecisions”); Catlin v. United States, 324 U. S. 229, 233\n(1945) (describing “final decision” generally as “one which\nends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for\nthe court to do but execute the judgment”).\n   We have equated to “final decisions” a slim set of “col\nlateral orders” that share these characteristics: They “are\nconclusive, [they] resolve important questions separate\n4      STOLT-NIELSEN S.

The question under\nthat provision is “whether the arbitrators had the power,\nbased on the parties’ submissions or the arbitration\nagreement, to reach a certain issue, not whether the arbi\ntrators correctly decided that issue.” DiRussa v. Dean\nWitter Reynolds Inc., 121 F. 3d 818, 824 (CA2 1997); Com\nprehensive Accounting Corp. v. Rudell, 760 F. 2d 138, 140\n(CA7 1985). The parties’ supplemental agreement, refer\nring the class-arbitration issue to an arbitration panel,\nundoubtedly empowered the arbitrators to render their\nclause-construction decision.      That scarcely debatable\npoint should resolve this case.\n\n\n——————\n  “In any of the following cases the United States court in and for the\ndistrict wherein the award was made may make an order vacating the\naward upon the application of any party to the arbitration—\n  “(1) where the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue\nmeans;\n  “(2) where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitra\ntors, or either of them;\n  “(3) where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to\npostpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to\nhear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other\nmisbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced; or\n  “(4) where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly\nexecuted them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the\nsubject matter submitted was not made.”\n8     STOLT-NIELSEN S.

Instead, the panel tied its conclusion\nthat the arbitration clause permitted class arbitration,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 52a, to New York law, federal mari\ntime law, and decisions made by other panels pursuant to\nRule 3 of the American Arbitration Association’s Supple\nmentary Rules for Class Arbitrations. Id., at 49a–50a.\n    At the outset of its explanation, the panel rejected the\nargument, proffered by AnimalFeeds, that this Court’s\ndecision in Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Bazzle, 539 U. S.\n444 (2003), settled the matter by “requir[ing] clear lan\nguage that forbids class arbitration in order to bar a class\naction.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a (emphasis added).\nAgreeing with Stolt-Nielsen in this regard, the panel said\nthat the test it employed looked to the language of the\nparticular agreement to gauge whether the parties “in\ntended to permit or to preclude class action[s].” Ibid.\nConcentrating on the wording of the arbitration clause,\nthe panel observed, is “consistent with New York law as\narticulated by the [New York] Court of Appeals . . . and\nwith federal maritime law.” Ibid.9\n    Emphasizing the breadth of the clause in question—\n“ ‘any dispute arising from the making, performance or\ntermination of this Charter Party’ shall be put to arbitra\ntion,” id., at 50a—the panel noted that numerous other\npartial awards had relied on language similarly compre\nhensive to permit class proceedings “in a wide variety of\nsettings.” Id., at 49a–50a. The panel further noted “that\nmany of the other panels [had] rejected arguments similar\nto those advanced by [Stolt-Nielsen].” Id., at 50a.\n——————\n  9 On New York law, the panel referred to Evans v.

The sentence quoted from the hearing tran\nscript concluded: “therefore there has been no agreement\nto bar class arbitrations.” App. 77a (emphasis added).\nCounsel quickly clarified his position: “It’s also undisputed\nthat the arbitration clause here contains broad language\nand this language should be interpreted to permit class\narbitrations.” Id., at 79a. See also id., at 80a (noting\nconsistent recognition by arbitration panels that “a silent\nbroadly worded arbitration clause, just like the one at\nissue here, should be construed to permit class arbitra\ntion”); id., at 88a (“[B]road . . . language . . . silent as to\nclass proceedings should be interpreted to permit a class\nproceeding.”).\n   Stolt-Nielsen, the panel acknowledged, had vigorously\nargued, with the support of expert testimony, that “the\nbulk of international shippers would never intend to have\ntheir disputes decided in a class arbitration.” App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 52a. That concern, the panel suggested, might be\nmet at a later stage; “if a class is certified,” the panel\nnoted, class membership could be confined to those who\naffirmatively “ ‘opt in’ ” to the proceeding. Ibid.\n   The question properly before the Court is not whether\nthe arbitrators’ ruling was erroneous, but whether the\narbitrators “exceeded their powers.” §10(a)(4). The arbi\ntrators decided a threshold issue, explicitly committed to\nthem, see supra, at 2, about the procedural mode available\nfor presentation of AnimalFeeds’ antitrust claims. Cf.\nShady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P. A. v. Allstate Ins.\nCo., 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (plurality opinion) (slip op.,\n10      STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v.

Misco, Inc.,\n484 U. S. 29, 38 (1987). The arbitrators here not merely\n“arguably,” but certainly, “constru[ed] . . . the contract”\nwith fidelity to their commission. Ibid. This Court, there\nfore, may not disturb the arbitrators’ judgment, even if\nconvinced that “serious error” infected the panel’s award.\nIbid.\n                              C\n   The Court not only intrudes on a decision the parties\nreferred to arbitrators. It compounds the intrusion by\naccording the arbitrators no opportunity to clarify their\ndecision and thereby to cure the error the Court perceives.\nSection 10(b), the Court asserts, invests in this tribunal\nauthority to “decide the question that was originally re\nferred to the panel.” Ante, at 12. The controlling provi\nsion, however, says nothing of the kind. Section 10(b)\nreads, in full: “If an award is vacated and the time within\nwhich the agreement required the award to be made has\nnot expired, the court may, in its discretion, direct a re\nhearing by the arbitrators.” (Emphasis added.) Just as\n§10(a)(4) provides no justification for the Court’s disposi\ntion, see supra, at 6–9 and this page, so, too, §10(b) pro\nvides no grounding for the Court’s peremptory action.\n                             IV\n                              A\n     For arbitrators to consider whether a claim should\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

See ante, at 20 (“[A] party may not\nbe compelled under the FAA to submit to class arbitration\nunless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the\nparty agreed to do so.”); ante, at 23. The breadth of the\narbitration clause, and the absence of any provision waiv\ning or banning class proceedings,10 will not do. Ante, at\n20–23.\n    The Court ties the requirement of affirmative authoriza\ntion to “the basic precept that arbitration ‘is a matter of\nconsent, not coercion.’ ” Ante, at 17 (quoting Volt Informa\ntion Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford\nJunior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 479 (1989)). Parties may\n“specify with whom they choose to arbitrate,” the Court\nobserves, just as they may “limit the issues they choose to\narbitrate.” Ante, at 19. But arbitrators, in delineating an\nappropriate class, need not, and should not, disregard\nsuch contractual constraints. In this case, for example,\nAnimalFeeds proposes to pursue, on behalf of a class, only\n“claims . . . arising out of any [charter party agreement]\n. . . that provides for arbitration.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n56a (emphasis added). Should the arbitrators certify the\nproposed class, they would adjudicate only the rights of\npersons “with whom” Stolt-Nielsen agreed to arbitrate,\nand only “issues” subject to arbitration. Ante, at 19 (em\nphasis omitted).\n——————\n  10 Several courts have invalidated contractual bans on, or waivers of,\n\nclass arbitration because proceeding on an individual basis was not\nfeasible in view of the high costs entailed and the slim benefits achiev\nable.

Were there no right to proceed on\nbehalf of a class in the first place, however, a provision banning or\nwaiving recourse to this aggregation device would be superfluous.\n12    STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court also links its affirmative-authorization re\nquirement to the parties’ right to stipulate rules under\nwhich arbitration may proceed. See ibid. The question,\nhowever, is the proper default rule when there is no stipu\nlation. Arbitration provisions, this Court has noted, are a\nspecies of forum-selection clauses. See Scherk v. Alberto-\nCulver Co., 417 U. S. 506, 519 (1974). Suppose the parties\nhad chosen a New York judicial forum for resolution of\n“any dispute” involving a contract for ocean carriage of\ngoods. There is little question that the designated court,\nstate or federal, would have authority to conduct claims\nlike AnimalFeeds’ on a class basis. Why should the class\naction prospect vanish when the “any dispute” clause is\ncontained in an arbitration agreement? Cf. Connecticut\nGeneral Life Ins. Co. v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada,\n210 F. 3d 771, 774–776 (CA7 2000) (reading contract’s\nauthorization to arbitrate “[a]ny dispute” to permit con\nsolidation of arbitrations). If the Court is right that arbi\ntrators ordinarily are not equipped to manage class pro\nceedings, see ante, at 21–22, then the claimant should\nretain its right to proceed in that format in court.\n                               B\n   When adjudication is costly and individual claims are no\nmore than modest in size, class proceedings may be “the\nthing,” i.e., without them, potential claimants will have\nlittle, if any, incentive to seek vindication of their rights.\nAmchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 617\n(1997); Carnegie v.

Mindful that\ndisallowance of class proceedings severely shrinks the\ndimensions of the case or controversy a claimant can\nmount, I note some stopping points in the Court’s decision.\n   First, the Court does not insist on express consent to\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

Class arbitration may be ordered if\n“there is a contractual basis for concluding that the\npart[ies] agreed” “to submit to class arbitration”. Ante, at\n20; see ante, at 23, n. 10 (“We have no occasion to decide\nwhat contractual basis may support a finding that the\nparties agreed to authorize class-action arbitration.”).\nSecond, by observing that “the parties [here] are sophisti\ncated business entities,” and “that it is customary for the\nshipper to choose the charter party that is used for a\nparticular shipment,” the Court apparently spares from its\naffirmative-authorization requirement contracts of adhe\nsion presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Ante, at 20.\nWhile these qualifications limit the scope of the Court’s\ndecision, I remain persuaded that the arbitrators’ judg\nment should not have been disturbed.\n                       *     *    *\n  For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the petition\nfor want of a controversy ripe for judicial review.

Argued December 9, 2009—Decided April 27, 2010\nPetitioner shipping companies serve much of the world market for par\n  cel tankers—seagoing vessels with compartments that are separately\n  chartered to customers, such as respondent (AnimalFeeds), who wish\n  to ship liquids in small quantities. AnimalFeeds ships its goods pur\n  suant to a standard contract known in the maritime trade as a char\n  ter party. The charter party that AnimalFeeds uses contains an arbi\n  tration clause. AnimalFeeds brought a class action antitrust suit\n  against petitioners for price fixing, and that suit was consolidated\n  with similar suits brought by other charterers, including one in\n  which the Second Circuit subsequently reversed a lower court ruling\n  that the charterers’ claims were not subject to arbitration. As a con\n  sequence, the parties in this case agree that they must arbitrate their\n  antitrust dispute. AnimalFeeds sought arbitration on behalf of a\n  class of purchasers of parcel tanker transportation services. The par\n  ties agreed to submit the question whether their arbitration agree\n  ment allowed for class arbitration to a panel of arbitrators, who\n  would be bound by rules (Class Rules) developed by the American\n  Arbitration Association following Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Baz\n  zle, 539 U. S. 444. One Class Rule requires an arbitrator to deter\n  mine whether an arbitration clause permits class arbitration. The\n  parties selected an arbitration panel, designated New York City as\n  the arbitration site, and stipulated that their arbitration clause was\n  “silent” on the class arbitration issue. The panel determined that the\n  arbitration clause allowed for class arbitration, but the District Court\n  vacated the award. It concluded that the arbitrators’ award was\n  made in “manifest disregard” of the law, for had the arbitrators con\n  ducted a choice-of-law analysis, they would have applied the rule of\n2        STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    federal maritime law requiring contracts to be interpreted in light of\n    custom and usage. The Second Circuit reversed, holding that be\n    cause petitioners had cited no authority applying a maritime rule of\n    custom and usage against class arbitration, the arbitrators’ decision\n    was not in manifest disregard of maritime law; and that the arbitra\n    tors had not manifestly disregarded New York law, which had not es\n    tablished a rule against class arbitration.\nHeld: Imposing class arbitration on parties who have not agreed to au\n thorize class arbitration is inconsistent with the Federal Arbitration\n Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. §1 et seq. Pp. 7–23.\n    (a) The arbitration panel exceeded its powers by imposing its own\n policy choice instead of identifying and applying a rule of decision de\n rived from the FAA or from maritime or New York law. Pp. 7–12.\n       (1) An arbitration decision may be vacated under FAA §10(a)(4)\n on the ground that the arbitrator exceeded his powers, “only when\n [an] arbitrator strays from interpretation and application of the\n agreement and effectively ‘dispense[s] his own brand of industrial\n justice,’ ” Major League Baseball Players Assn. v. Garvey, 532 U. S.\n 504, 509 (per curiam), for an arbitrator’s task is to interpret and en\n force a contract, not to make public policy. P. 7.\n       (2) The arbitration panel appears to have rested its decision on\n AnimalFeeds’ public policy argument for permitting class arbitration\n under the charter party’s arbitration clause. However, because the\n parties agreed that their agreement was “silent” on the class arbitra\n tion issue, the arbitrators’ proper task was to identify the rule of law\n governing in that situation. Instead, the panel based its decision on\n post-Bazzle arbitral decisions without mentioning whether they were\n based on a rule derived from the FAA or on maritime or New York\n law. Rather than inquiring whether those bodies of law contained a\n “default rule” permitting an arbitration clause to allow class arbitra\n tion absent express consent, the panel proceeded as if it had a com\n mon-law court’s authority to develop what it viewed as the best rule\n for such a situation. Finding no reason to depart from its perception\n of a post-Bazzle consensus among arbitrators that class arbitration\n was beneficial in numerous settings, the panel simply imposed its\n own conception of sound policy and permitted class arbitration. The\n panel’s few references to intent do not show that the panel did any\n thing other than impose its own policy preference. Thus, under FAA\n §10(b), this Court must either “direct a rehearing by the arbitrators”\n or decide the question originally referred to the panel. Because there\n can be only one possible outcome on the facts here, there is no need to\n direct a rehearing by the arbitrators. Pp. 7–12.\n    (b) Bazzle did not control resolution of the question whether the in\n stant charter party permits arbitration to proceed on behalf of this\n                   Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nclass. Pp. 12–17.\n      (1) No single rationale commanded a majority in Bazzle, which\nconcerned contracts between a commercial lender and its customers\nthat had an arbitration clause that did not expressly mention class\narbitration. The plurality decided only the question whether the\ncourt or arbitrator should decide whether the contracts were “silent”\non the class arbitration issue, concluding that it was the arbitrator.\nJUSTICE STEVENS’ opinion bypassed that question, resting instead on\nhis resolution of the questions of what standard the appropriate deci\nsionmaker should apply in determining whether a contract allows\nclass arbitration, and whether, under whatever standard is appropri\nate, class arbitration had been properly ordered in the case at hand.\nPp. 12–15.\n      (2) The Bazzle opinions appear to have baffled these parties at\ntheir arbitration proceeding. For one thing, the parties appear to\nhave believed that Bazzle requires an arbitrator, not a court, to de\ncide whether a contract permits class arbitration, a question ad\ndressed only by the plurality. That question need not be revisited\nhere because the parties expressly assigned that issue to the arbitra\ntion panel, and no party argues that this assignment was impermis\nsible. Both the parties and the arbitration panel also seem to have\nmisunderstood Bazzle as establishing the standard to be applied in\ndeciding whether class arbitration is permitted. However, Bazzle left\nthat question open. Pp. 15–17.\n   (c) Imposing class arbitration here is inconsistent with the FAA.\nPp. 17–23.\n      (1) The FAA imposes rules of fundamental importance, including\nthe basic precept that arbitration “is a matter of consent, not coer\ncion.” Volt v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489\nU. S. 468, 479. The FAA requires that a “written provision in any\nmaritime transaction” calling for the arbitration of a controversy\narising out of such transaction “shall be valid, irrevocable, and en\nforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the\nrevocation of any contract,” 9 U. S. C. §2, and permits a party to an\narbitration agreement to petition a federal district court for an order\ndirecting that arbitration proceed “in the manner provided for in such\nagreement,” §4. Thus, this Court has said that the FAA’s central\npurpose is to ensure that “private agreements to arbitrate are en\nforced according to their terms.” Volt, 489 U. S., at 479. Whether en\nforcing an agreement to arbitrate or construing an arbitration clause,\ncourts and arbitrators must “give effect to the [parties’] contractual\nrights and expectations.” Ibid. The parties’ “intentions control,”\nMitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S.\n614, 626, and the parties are “generally free to structure their arbi\n4        STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v.

They may agree to limit the issues ar\n    bitrated and may agree on rules under which an arbitration will pro\n    ceed. They may also specify with whom they choose to arbitrate their\n    disputes. See EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U. S. 279, 289.\n    Pp. 17–20.\n         (2) It follows that a party may not be compelled under the FAA to\n    submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for con\n    cluding that the party agreed to do so. Here, the arbitration panel\n    imposed class arbitration despite the parties’ stipulation that they\n    had reached “no agreement” on that issue. The panel’s conclusion is\n    fundamentally at war with the foundational FAA principle that arbi\n    tration is a matter of consent. It may be appropriate to presume that\n    parties to an arbitration agreement implicitly authorize the arbitra\n    tor to adopt those procedures necessary to give effect to the parties’\n    agreement. See Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79,\n    84. But an implicit agreement to authorize class action arbitration is\n    not a term that the arbitrator may infer solely from the fact of an\n    agreement to arbitrate. The differences between simple bilateral and\n    complex class action arbitration are too great for such a presumption.\n    Pp. 20–23.\n548 F. 3d 85, reversed and remanded.\n\n  ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS, C.

In one of these,\nthe District Court for the District of Connecticut held that\nthe charterers’ claims were not subject to arbitration\nunder the applicable arbitration clause, but the Second\nCircuit reversed. See JLM Industries, Inc. v. Stolt-Nielsen\nS. A., 387 F. 3d 163, 183 (2004). While that appeal was\npending, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation\nordered the consolidation of then-pending actions against\npetitioners, including AnimalFeeds’ action, in the District\nof Connecticut. See In re Parcel Tanker Shipping Services\nAntitrust Litigation, 296 F. Supp. 2d 1370, 1371, and n. 1\n(JPML 2003). The parties agree that as a consequence of\nthese judgments and orders, AnimalFeeds and petitioners\nmust arbitrate their antitrust dispute.\n                              B\n   In 2005, AnimalFeeds served petitioners with a demand\nfor class arbitration, designating New York City as the\nplace of arbitration and seeking to represent a class of\n“[a]ll direct purchasers of parcel tanker transportation\nservices globally for bulk liquid chemicals, edible oils,\nacids, and other specialty liquids from [petitioners] at any\ntime during the period from August 1, 1998, to November\n30, 2002.” 548 F. 3d 85, 87 (CA2 2008) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The parties entered into a supplemental\nagreement providing for the question of class arbitration\nto be submitted to a panel of three arbitrators who were to\n“follow and be bound by Rules 3 through 7 of the American\nArbitration Association’s Supplementary Rules for Class\nArbitrations (as effective Oct. 8, 2003).” App. to Pet. for\nCert. 59a. These rules (hereinafter Class Rules) were\ndeveloped by the American Arbitration Association (AAA)\nafter our decision in Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Bazzle,\n4     STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n539 U. S. 444 (2003), and Class Rule 3, in accordance with\nthe plurality opinion in that case, requires an arbitrator,\nas a threshold matter, to determine “whether the applica­\nble arbitration clause permits the arbitration to proceed\non behalf of or against a class.” App. 56a.\n   The parties selected a panel of arbitrators and stipu­\nlated that the arbitration clause was “silent” with respect\nto class arbitration. Counsel for AnimalFeeds explained to\nthe arbitration panel that the term “silent” did not simply\nmean that the clause made no express reference to class\narbitration. Rather, he said, “[a]ll the parties agree that\nwhen a contract is silent on an issue there’s been no\nagreement that has been reached on that issue.” Id.,\nat 77a.\n   After hearing argument and evidence, including testi­\nmony from petitioners’ experts regarding arbitration\ncustoms and usage in the maritime trade, the arbitrators\nconcluded that the arbitration clause allowed for class\narbitration. They found persuasive the fact that other\narbitrators ruling after Bazzle had construed “a wide\nvariety of clauses in a wide variety of settings as allowing\nfor class arbitration,” but the panel acknowledged that\nnone of these decisions was “exactly comparable” to the\npresent dispute. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a–50a.\nPetitioners’ expert evidence did not show an “inten[t] to\npreclude class arbitration,” the arbitrators reasoned, and\npetitioners’ argument would leave “no basis for a class\naction absent express agreement among all parties and\nthe putative class members.” Id., at 51a.\n   The arbitrators stayed the proceeding to allow the par­\nties to seek judicial review, and petitioners filed an appli­\ncation to vacate the arbitrators’ award in the District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York. See 9\nU. S.

A–17, ¶16 (citing §10(a)(4) as a ground for vaca­\ntur of the award); see also id., at A–15 to A–16, ¶9 (invok­\ning the District Court’s jurisdiction under 9 U. S. C. §203\nand 28 U. S. C. §§1331 and 1333). The District Court\nvacated the award, concluding that the arbitrators’ deci­\nsion was made in “manifest disregard” of the law insofar\nas the arbitrators failed to conduct a choice-of-law analy­\nsis. 435 F. Supp. 2d 382, 384–385 (SDNY 2006). See\nWilko v. Swan, 346 U. S. 427, 436–437 (1953) (“[T]he\ninterpretations of the law by the arbitrators in contrast to\nmanifest disregard are not subject, in the federal courts, to\njudicial review for error in interpretation”); see also Peti­\ntion to Vacate Arbitration Award, supra, at A–17, ¶17\n(alleging that the arbitration panel “manifestly disre­\ngarded the law”). Had such an analysis been conducted,\nthe District Court held, the arbitrators would have applied\nthe rule of federal maritime law requiring that contracts\nbe interpreted in light of custom and usage. 435 F. Supp.\n2d, at 385–386.\n   AnimalFeeds appealed to the Court of Appeals, which\nreversed. See 9 U. S. C. §16(a)(1)(E) (“An appeal may be\ntaken from . . . an order . . . vacating an award”). As an\ninitial matter, the Court of Appeals held that the “mani­\nfest disregard” standard survived our decision in Hall\nStreet Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. 576\n(2008), as a “judicial gloss” on the enumerated grounds for\nvacatur of arbitration awards under 9 U. S. C. §10. 548\nF. 3d, at 94. Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals concluded\nthat, because petitioners had cited no authority applying a\nfederal maritime rule of custom and usage against class\narbitration, the arbitrators’ decision was not in manifest\ndisregard of federal maritime law. Id., at 97–98. Nor had\nthe arbitrators manifestly disregarded New York law, the\nCourt of Appeals continued, since nothing in New York\n6        STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncase law established a rule against class arbitration. Id.,\nat 98–99.\n  We granted certiorari. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).2\n\n——————\n    2 Invokingan argument not pressed in or considered by the courts\nbelow, the dissent concludes that the question presented is not ripe for\nour review. See post, at 1, 3–6 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.). In so doing,\nthe dissent offers no clear justification for now embracing an argument\n“we necessarily considered and rejected” in granting certiorari. United\nStates v. Williams, 504 U. S. 36, 40 (1992). Ripeness reflects constitu­\ntional considerations that implicate “Article III limitations on judicial\npower,” as well as “prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdic­\ntion.” Reno v. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S. 43, 57, n. 18\n(1993). In evaluating a claim to determine whether it is ripe for judicial\nreview, we consider both “the fitness of the issues for judicial decision”\nand “the hardship of withholding court consideration.” National Park\nHospitality Assn. v. Department of Interior, 538 U. S. 803, 808 (2003).\nTo the extent the dissent believes that the question on which we\ngranted certiorari is constitutionally unripe for review, we disagree.\nThe arbitration panel’s award means that petitioners must now submit\nto class determination proceedings before arbitrators who, if petitioners\nare correct, have no authority to require class arbitration absent the\nparties’ agreement to resolve their disputes on that basis. See Class\nRule 4(a) (cited in App. 57a); Brief for American Arbitration Association\nas Amicus Curiae 17. Should petitioners refuse to proceed with what\nthey maintain is essentially an ultra vires proceeding, they would\nalmost certainly be subject to a petition to compel arbitration under 9\nU. S. C. §4. Cf. Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U. S. 102,\n143 (1974) (“Where the inevitability of the operation of a statute\nagainst certain individuals is patent, it is irrelevant to the existence of\na justiciable controversy that there will be a time delay before the\ndisputed provisions will come into effect”). We think it is clear on these\nfacts that petitioners have demonstrated sufficient hardship, and that\ntheir question is fit for our review at this time. To the extent the\ndissent believes that the question is prudentially unripe, we reject that\nargument as waived, Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51, 56,\nn. 4 (2002), and we see no reason to disregard the waiver. We express\nno view as to whether, in a similar case, a federal court may consider a\nquestion of prudential ripeness on its own motion. See National Park\nHospitality Assn., supra, at 808 (“[E]ven in a case raising only pruden­\ntial concerns, the question of ripeness may be considered on a court’s\nown motion”).\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

It is not enough for peti­\ntioners to show that the panel committed an error—or\neven a serious error. See Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v.\nMine Workers, 531 U. S. 57, 62 (2000); Paperworkers v.\nMisco, Inc., 484 U. S. 29, 38 (1987). “It is only when [an]\narbitrator strays from interpretation and application of\nthe agreement and effectively ‘dispense[s] his own brand\nof industrial justice’ that his decision may be unenforce­\nable.” Major League Baseball Players Assn. v. Garvey, 532\nU. S. 504, 509 (2001) (per curiam) (quoting Steelworkers v.\nEnterprise Wheel & Car Corp., 363 U. S. 593, 597 (1960)).\nIn that situation, an arbitration decision may be vacated\nunder §10(a)(4) of the FAA on the ground that the arbitra­\ntor “exceeded [his] powers,” for the task of an arbitrator is\nto interpret and enforce a contract, not to make public\npolicy. In this case, we must conclude that what the arbi­\ntration panel did was simply to impose its own view of\nsound policy regarding class arbitration.3\n                         B\n                         1\n  In its memorandum of law filed in the arbitration pro­\n——————\n  3 We  do not decide whether “ ‘manifest disregard’ ” survives our deci­\nsion in Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. 576, 585\n(2008), as an independent ground for review or as a judicial gloss on the\nenumerated grounds for vacatur set forth at 9 U. S. C. §10. Animal-\nFeeds characterizes that standard as requiring a showing that the\narbitrators “knew of the relevant [legal] principle, appreciated that this\nprinciple controlled the outcome of the disputed issue, and nonetheless\nwillfully flouted the governing law by refusing to apply it.” Brief for\nRespondent 25 (internal quotation marks omitted). Assuming, ar\nguendo, that such a standard applies, we find it satisfied for the rea­\nsons that follow.\n8     STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nceedings, AnimalFeeds made three arguments in sup-\nport of construing the arbitration clause to permit class\narbitration:\n       “The parties’ arbitration clause should be construed\n    to allow class arbitration because (a) the clause is si-\n    lent on the issue of class treatment and, without ex-\n    press prohibition, class arbitration is permitted under\n    Bazzle; (b) the clause should be construed to permit\n    class arbitration as a matter of public policy; and (c)\n    the clause would be unconscionable and unenforceable\n    if it forbade class arbitration.” App. in No. 06–3474–\n    cv (CA2), at A–308 to A–309 (emphasis added).\n   The arbitrators expressly rejected AnimalFeeds’ first\nargument, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a, and said nothing\nabout the third. Instead, the panel appears to have rested\nits decision on AnimalFeeds’ public policy argument.\nBecause the parties agreed their agreement was “silent” in\nthe sense that they had not reached any agreement on the\nissue of class arbitration, the arbitrators’ proper task was\nto identify the rule of law that governs in that situation.\nHad they engaged in that undertaking, they presumably\nwould have looked either to the FAA itself or to one of the\ntwo bodies of law that the parties claimed were governing,\ni.e., either federal maritime law or New York law. But the\npanel did not consider whether the FAA provides the rule\nof decision in such a situation; nor did the panel attempt\nto determine what rule would govern under either mari-\ntime or New York law in the case of a “silent” contract.\nInstead, the panel based its decision on post-Bazzle arbi-\ntral decisions that “construed a wide variety of clauses in a\nwide variety of settings as allowing for class arbitration.”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 49a–50a. The panel did not mention\nwhether any of these decisions were based on a rule de-\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nrived from the FAA or on maritime or New York law.4\n   Rather than inquiring whether the FAA, maritime law,\nor New York law contains a “default rule” under which an\narbitration clause is construed as allowing class arbitra­\ntion in the absence of express consent, the panel proceeded\nas if it had the authority of a common-law court to develop\nwhat it viewed as the best rule to be applied in such a\nsituation. Perceiving a post-Bazzle consensus among\narbitrators that class arbitration is beneficial in “a wide\nvariety of settings,” the panel considered only whether\nthere was any good reason not to follow that consensus in\nthis case. App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a–50a. The panel was\nnot persuaded by “court cases denying consolidation of\narbitrations,”5 by undisputed evidence that the Vegoilvoy\ncharter party had “never been the basis of a class action,”\nor by expert opinion that “sophisticated, multinational\ncommercial parties of the type that are sought to be in­\n——————\n  4 The panel’s reliance on these arbitral awards confirms that the\n\npanel’s decision was not based on a determination regarding the\nparties’ intent. All of the arbitral awards were made under the AAA’s\nClass Rules, which were adopted in 2003, and thus none was available\nwhen the parties here entered into the Vegoilvoy charter party during\nthe class period ranging from 1998 to 2002. See 548 F. 3d 85, 87 (CA2\n2008) (defining the class period). Indeed, at the hearing before the\npanel, counsel for AnimalFeeds conceded that “[w]hen you talk about\nexpectations, virtually every one of the arbitration clauses that were\nthe subject of the 25 AAA decisions were drafted before [Bazzle]. So\ntherefore, if you are going to talk about the parties’ intentions, pre\n[Bazzle] class arbitrations were not common, post [Bazzle] they are\ncommon.” App. 87a. Moreover, in its award, the panel appeared to\nacknowledge that none of the cited arbitration awards involved a\ncontract between sophisticated business entities. See App. to Pet. for\nCert. 50a.\n  5 See Government of United Kingdom v. Boeing Co., 998 F. 2d 68, 71,\n\n74 (CA2 1993); see also Glencore, Ltd. v. Schnitzer Steel Prods. Co., 189\nF. 3d 264, 268 (CA2 1999); Champ v. Siegel Trading Co., 55 F. 3d 269,\n275 (CA7 1995). Unlike the subsequent arbitration awards that the\narbitrators cited, these decisions were available to the parties when\nthey entered into their contracts.\n10     STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncluded in the class would never intend that the arbitration\nclauses would permit a class arbitration.”6 Id., at 50a–\n——————\n   6 Petitioners produced expert evidence from experienced maritime\n\narbitrators demonstrating that it is customary in the shipping business\nfor parties to resolve their disputes through bilateral arbitration. See,\ne.g., App. 126a (expert declaration of John Kimball) (“In the 30 years I\nhave been practicing as a maritime lawyer, I have never encountered\nan arbitration clause in a charter party that could be construed as\nallowing class action arbitration”); id., at 139a (expert declaration of\nBruce Harris) (“I have been working as a maritime arbitrator for thirty\nyears and this matter is the first I have ever encountered where the\nissue of a class action arbitration has even been raised”). These experts\namplified their written statements in their live testimony, as well. See,\ne.g., App. 112a, 113a (Mr. Kimball) (opining that the prospect of a class\naction in a maritime arbitration would be “quite foreign” to overseas\nshipping executives and charterers); id., at 111a–112a (Mr. Harris)\n(opining that in the view of the London Corps of International Arbitra­\ntion, class arbitration is “inconceivable”).\n   Under both New York law and general maritime law, evidence of\n“custom and usage” is relevant to determining the parties’ intent when\nan express agreement is ambiguous.

But just as merely saying something is so does not make it so, cf.\nUnited States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 614 (2000), the arbitrators\nneed not have said they were relying on policy to make it so. At the\nhearing before the arbitration panel, one of the arbitrators recognized\nthat the body of post-Bazzle arbitration awards on which AnimalFeeds\nrelied involved “essentially consumer non-value cases.” App. 82a. In\nresponse, counsel for AnimalFeeds defended the applicability of those\nawards by asserting that the “vast majority” of the claimants against\npetitioners “have negative value claims . . . meaning it costs more to\nlitigate than you would get if you won.” Id., at 82a–83a. The panel\ncredited this body of awards in concluding that petitioners had not\ndemonstrated the parties’ intent to preclude class arbitration, and\nfurther observed that if petitioners’ anticonsolidation precedents\ncontrolled, then “there would appear to be no basis for a class action\nabsent express agreement among all parties and the putative class\nmembers.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a, 51a.\n12    STOLT-NIELSEN S.

ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nacknowledged that the parties in this case agreed that the\nVegoilvoy charter party was “silent on whether [it] per­\nmit[ted] or preclude[d] class arbitration,” but that the\ncharter party was “not ambiguous so as to call for parol\nevidence.” Ibid. This stipulation left no room for an in­\nquiry regarding the parties’ intent, and any inquiry into\nthat settled question would have been outside the panel’s\nassigned task.\n   The panel also commented on the breadth of the lan­\nguage in the Vegoilvoy charter party, see id., at 50a, but\nsince the only task that was left for the panel, in light of\nthe parties’ stipulation, was to identify the governing rule\napplicable in a case in which neither the language of the\ncontract nor any other evidence established that the par­\nties had reached any agreement on the question of class\narbitration, the particular wording of the charter party\nwas quite beside the point.\n   In sum, instead of identifying and applying a rule of\ndecision derived from the FAA or either maritime or New\nYork law, the arbitration panel imposed its own policy\nchoice and thus exceeded its powers. As a result, under\n§10(b) of the FAA, we must either “direct a rehearing by\nthe arbitrators” or decide the question that was originally\nreferred to the panel. Because we conclude that there can\nbe only one possible outcome on the facts before us, we see\nno need to direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n  The arbitration panel thought that Bazzle “controlled”\nthe “resolution” of the question whether the Vegoilvoy\ncharter party “permit[s] this arbitration to proceed on\nbehalf of a class,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a–49a, but that\nunderstanding was incorrect.\n  Bazzle concerned contracts between a commercial lender\n(Green Tree) and its customers. These contracts con­\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntained an arbitration clause but did not expressly mention\nclass arbitration. Nevertheless, an arbitrator conducted\nclass arbitration proceedings and entered awards for the\ncustomers.\n   The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the\nawards. Bazzle v. Green Tree Financial Corp., 351 S. C.\n244, 569 S. E. 2d 349 (2002). After discussing both Sev-\nenth Circuit precedent holding that a court lacks authority\nto order classwide arbitration under §4 of the FAA, see\nChamp v. Siegel Trading Co., 55 F. 3d 269 (1995), and\nconflicting California precedent, see Keating v. Superior\nCourt of Alameda Cty., 31 Cal. 3d 584, 645 P. 2d 1192\n(1982), the State Supreme Court elected to follow the\nCalifornia approach, which it characterized as permitting\na trial court to “order class-wide arbitration under adhe-\nsive but enforceable franchise contracts,” 351 S. C., at 259,\n266, 569 S. E. 2d, at 357, 360. Under this approach, the\nSouth Carolina court observed, a trial judge must\n“[b]alanc[e] the potential inequities and inefficiencies” of\nrequiring each aggrieved party to proceed on an individual\nbasis against “resulting prejudice to the drafting party”\nand should take into account factors such as “efficiency”\nand “equity.” Id., at 260, and n. 15, 569 S. E. 2d, at 357,\nand n. 15.\n   Applying these standards to the case before it, the South\nCarolina Supreme Court found that the arbitration clause\nin the Green Tree contracts was “silent regarding class-\nwide arbitration.” Id., at 263, 569 S. E. 2d, at 359\n(emphasis deleted). The Court described its holding as\nfollows:\n    “[W]e . . . hold that class-wide arbitration may be or-\n    dered when the arbitration agreement is silent if it\n    would serve efficiency and equity, and would not re-\n    sult in prejudice. If we enforced a mandatory, adhe-\n    sive arbitration clause, but prohibited class actions in\n14    STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n     arbitration where the agreement is silent, the drafting\n     party could effectively prevent class actions against\n     it without having to say it was doing so in the\n     agreement.” Id., at 266, 569 S. E. 2d, at 360 (footnote\n     omitted).\n   When Bazzle reached this Court, no single rationale\ncommanded a majority. The opinions of the Justices who\njoined the judgment—that is, the plurality opinion and\nJUSTICE STEVENS’ opinion—collectively addressed three\nseparate questions. The first was which decision maker\n(court or arbitrator) should decide whether the contracts\nin question were “silent” on the issue of class arbitration.\nThe second was what standard the appropriate decision\nmaker should apply in determining whether a contract\nallows class arbitration. (For example, does the FAA\nentirely preclude class arbitration? Does the FAA permit\nclass arbitration only under limited circumstances, such\nas when the contract expressly so provides? Or is this\nquestion left entirely to state law?) The final question was\nwhether, under whatever standard is appropriate, class\narbitration had been properly ordered in the case\nat hand.\n   The plurality opinion decided only the first question,\nconcluding that the arbitrator and not a court should\ndecide whether the contracts were indeed “silent” on the\nissue of class arbitration. The plurality noted that, “[i]n\ncertain limited circumstances,” involving “gateway mat­\nters, such as whether the parties have a valid arbitration\nagreement at all or whether a concededly binding arbitra­\ntion clause applies to a certain type of controversy,” it is\nassumed “that the parties intended courts, not arbitra­\ntors,” to make the decision. 539 U. S., at 452. But the\nplurality opined that the question whether a contract with\nan arbitration clause forbids class arbitration “does not\nfall into this narrow exception.” Ibid. The plurality there­\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfore concluded that the decision of the State Supreme\nCourt should be vacated and that the case should be re­\nmanded for a decision by the arbitrator on the question\nwhether the contracts were indeed “silent.” The plurality\ndid not decide either the second or the third question\nnoted above.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS concurred in the judgment vacating\nand remanding because otherwise there would have been\n“no controlling judgment of the Court,” but he did not\nendorse the plurality’s rationale. Id., at 455 (opinion\nconcurring in judgment and dissenting in part). He did\nnot take a definitive position on the first question, stating\nonly that “[a]rguably the interpretation of the parties’\nagreement should have been made in the first instance by\nthe arbitrator.” Ibid. (emphasis added). But because he\ndid not believe that Green Tree had raised the question of\nthe appropriate decision maker, he preferred not to reach\nthat question and, instead, would have affirmed the deci­\nsion of the State Supreme Court on the ground that “the\ndecision to conduct a class-action arbitration was correct\nas a matter of law.” Ibid. Accordingly, his analysis by­\npassed the first question noted above and rested instead\non his resolution of the second and third questions. Thus,\nBazzle did not yield a majority decision on any of the three\nquestions.\n                              B\n   Unfortunately, the opinions in Bazzle appear to have\nbaffled the parties in this case at the time of the arbitra­\ntion proceeding. For one thing, the parties appear to have\nbelieved that the judgment in Bazzle requires an arbitra­\ntor, not a court, to decide whether a contract permits class\narbitration. See App. 89a (transcript of argument before\narbitration panel) (counsel for Stolt-Nielsen states: “What\n[Bazzle] says is that the contract interpretation issue is\nleft up to the arbitrator, that’s the rule in [Bazzle]”). In\n16     STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfact, however, only the plurality decided that question.\nBut we need not revisit that question here because the\nparties’ supplemental agreement expressly assigned this\nissue to the arbitration panel, and no party argues that\nthis assignment was impermissible.\n  Unfortunately, however, both the parties and the arbi-\ntration panel seem to have misunderstood Bazzle in an-\nother respect, namely, that it established the standard to\nbe applied by a decision maker in determining whether a\ncontract may permissibly be interpreted to allow class\narbitration. The arbitration panel began its discussion\nby stating that the parties “differ regarding the rule of\ninterpretation to be gleaned from [the Bazzle] decision.”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 49a (emphasis added). The panel\ncontinued:\n     “Claimants argue that Bazzle requires clear language\n     that forbids class arbitration in order to bar a class\n     action. The Panel, however, agrees with Respondents\n     that the test is a more general one—arbitrators must\n     look to the language of the parties’ agreement to as-\n     certain the parties’ intention whether they intended to\n     permit or to preclude class action.” Ibid.\nAs we have explained, however, Bazzle did not establish\nthe rule to be applied in deciding whether class arbitration\nis permitted.8 The decision in Bazzle left that question\n——————\n  8 AnimalFeeds   invokes the parties’ supplemental agreement as evi-\ndence that petitioners “waived” any claim that the arbitrators could not\nconstrue the arbitration agreement to permit class arbitration. Brief\nfor Respondent 15. The dissent concludes, likewise, that the existence\nof the parties’ supplemental agreement renders petitioners’ argument\nunder §10(a)(4) “scarcely debatable.” Post, at 7. These arguments are\neasily answered by the clear terms of the supplemental agreement\nitself. The parties expressly provided that their supplemental agree-\nment “does not alter the scope of the Parties’ arbitration agreements in\nany Charter Party Agreement,” and that “[n]either the fact of this\nAgreement nor any of its terms may be used to support or oppose any\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

Carlisle, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 6); Perry v.\nThomas, 482 U. S. 483, 493, n. 9 (1987), the FAA imposes\ncertain rules of fundamental importance, including the\nbasic precept that arbitration “is a matter of consent, not\ncoercion,” Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of\nTrustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468,\n479 (1989).\n                              A\n  In 1925, Congress enacted the United States Arbitration\nAct, as the FAA was formerly known, for the express\npurpose of making “valid and enforceable written provi­\nsions or agreements for arbitration of disputes arising out\nof contracts, maritime transactions, or commerce among\nthe States or Territories or with foreign nations.” 43 Stat.\n883. Reenacted and codified in 1947, see 61 Stat. 669,9 the\n——————\nargument in favor of a class action arbitration . . . and may not be relied\nupon by the Parties, any arbitration panel, any court, or any other\ntribunal for such purposes.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a–63a (emphasis\nadded). As with any agreement to arbitrate, we are obliged to enforce\nthe parties’ supplemental agreement “according to its terms.” Mastro\nbuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U. S. 52, 58 (1995). The\nquestion that the arbitration panel was charged with deciding was\nwhether the arbitration clause in the Vegoilvoy charter party allowed\nfor class arbitration, and nothing in the supplemental agreement\nconferred authority on the arbitrators to exceed the terms of the charter\nparty itself. Thus, contrary to AnimalFeeds’ argument, these state­\nments show that petitioners did not waive their argument that Bazzle\ndid not establish the standard for the decision maker to apply when\nconstruing an arbitration clause.\n   9 See generally Sturges & Murphy, Some Confusing Matters Relating\n\nto Arbitration Under the United States Arbitration Act, 17 Law &\nContemp. Prob. 580, 580–581, n. 1 (1952) (recounting the history of\nthe United States Arbitration Act and its 1947 reenactment and\n18     STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v.

S. C. §2. Under the FAA, a party to an\narbitration agreement may petition a United States dis­\ntrict court for an order directing that “arbitration proceed\nin the manner provided for in such agreement.” §4. Con­\nsistent with these provisions, we have said on numerous\noccasions that the central or “primary” purpose of the FAA\nis to ensure that “private agreements to arbitrate are\nenforced according to their terms.” Volt, supra, at 479;\nMastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U. S.\n52, 57, 58 (1995); see also Doctor’s Associates, Inc. v.\nCasarotto, 517 U. S. 681, 688 (1996). See generally 9\nU. S.

In this endeavor, “as\nwith any other contract, the parties’ intentions control.”\nMitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,\n473 U. S. 614, 626 (1985). This is because an arbitrator\nderives his or her powers from the parties’ agreement to\nforgo the legal process and submit their disputes to pri­\nvate dispute resolution.

For example, we have held that par­\nties may agree to limit the issues they choose to arbitrate,\nsee Mitsubishi Motors, supra, at 628, and may agree on\nrules under which any arbitration will proceed, Volt,\nsupra, at 479. They may choose who will resolve specific\ndisputes. E.g., App. 30a; Alexander v. Gardner-Denver\nCo., 415 U. S. 36, 57 (1974); Burchell v. Marsh, 17 How.\n344, 349 (1855); see also International Produce, Inc. v.\nA/S Rosshavet, 638 F. 2d 548, 552 (CA2) (“The most\nsought-after arbitrators are those who are prominent and\nexperienced members of the specific business community\nin which the dispute to be arbitrated arose”), cert. denied,\n451 U. S. 1017 (1981).\n   We think it is also clear from our precedents and the\ncontractual nature of arbitration that parties may specify\nwith whom they choose to arbitrate their disputes. See\nEEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U. S. 279, 289 (2002)\n(“[N]othing in the [FAA] authorizes a court to compel\narbitration of any issues, or by any parties, that are not\nalready covered in the agreement” (emphasis added));\nMoses H.

It falls to courts and\narbitrators to give effect to these contractual limitations,\nand when doing so, courts and arbitrators must not lose\nsight of the purpose of the exercise: to give effect to the\nintent of the parties. Volt, 489 U. S., at 479.\n                              B\n   From these principles, it follows that a party may not be\ncompelled under the FAA to submit to class arbitration\nunless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the\nparty agreed to do so. In this case, however, the arbitra­\ntion panel imposed class arbitration even though the\nparties concurred that they had reached “no agreement”\non that issue, see App. 77a. The critical point, in the view\nof the arbitration panel, was that petitioners did not “es­\ntablish that the parties to the charter agreements in­\ntended to preclude class arbitration.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n51a. Even though the parties are sophisticated business\nentities, even though there is no tradition of class arbitra­\ntion under maritime law, and even though AnimalFeeds\ndoes not dispute that it is customary for the shipper to\nchoose the charter party that is used for a particular\nshipment, the panel regarded the agreement’s silence on\nthe question of class arbitration as dispositive. The\npanel’s conclusion is fundamentally at war with the foun­\ndational FAA principle that arbitration is a matter of\nconsent.\n   In certain contexts, it is appropriate to presume that\nparties that enter into an arbitration agreement implicitly\nauthorize the arbitrator to adopt such procedures as are\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnecessary to give effect to the parties’ agreement. Thus,\nwe have said that “ ‘ “procedural” questions which grow out\nof the dispute and bear on its final disposition’ are pre­\nsumptively not for the judge, but for an arbitrator, to\ndecide.” Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S.\n79, 84 (2002) (quoting John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v.\nLivingston, 376 U. S. 543, 557 (1964)). This recognition is\ngrounded in the background principle that “[w]hen the\nparties to a bargain sufficiently defined to be a contract\nhave not agreed with respect to a term which is essential\nto a determination of their rights and duties, a term which\nis reasonable in the circumstances is supplied by the\ncourt.” Restatement (Second) of Contracts §204 (1979).\n   An implicit agreement to authorize class-action arbitra­\ntion, however, is not a term that the arbitrator may infer\nsolely from the fact of the parties’ agreement to arbitrate.\nThis is so because class-action arbitration changes the\nnature of arbitration to such a degree that it cannot be\npresumed the parties consented to it by simply agreeing to\nsubmit their disputes to an arbitrator. In bilateral arbi­\ntration, parties forgo the procedural rigor and appellate\nreview of the courts in order to realize the benefits of\nprivate dispute resolution: lower costs, greater efficiency\nand speed, and the ability to choose expert adjudicators to\nresolve specialized disputes.        See Gilmer v. Inter\nstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 31 (1991); Mitsu\nbishi Motors, 473 U. S., at 628; see also 14 Penn Plaza\nLLC v. Pyett, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip. op., at 7–8)\n(“Parties generally favor arbitration precisely because of\nthe economics of dispute resolution” (citing Circuit City\nStores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U. S. 105, 123 (2001)); Gardner-\nDenver, supra, at 57 (“Parties usually choose an arbitrator\nbecause they trust his knowledge and judgment concern­\ning the demands and norms of industrial relations”). But\nthe relative benefits of class-action arbitration are much\nless assured, giving reason to doubt the parties’ mutual\n22    STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconsent to resolve disputes through class-wide arbitration.\nCf. First Options, supra, at 945 (noting that “one can\nunderstand why courts might hesitate to interpret silence\nor ambiguity on the ‘who should decide arbitrability’ point\nas giving the arbitrators that power, for doing so might too\noften force unwilling parties to arbitrate” contrary to their\nexpectations).\n   Consider just some of the fundamental changes brought\nabout by the shift from bilateral arbitration to class-action\narbitration. An arbitrator chosen according to an agreed­\nupon procedure, see, e.g., supra, at 2, no longer resolves a\nsingle dispute between the parties to a single agreement,\nbut instead resolves many disputes between hundreds or\nperhaps even thousands of parties. See App. 86a (“[W]e\nbelieve domestic class members could be in the hundreds”\nand that “[t]here could be class members that ship to and\nfrom the U. S. who are not domestic who we think would\nbe covered”); see also, e.g., Bazzle, 351 S. C., at 251, 569\nS. E. 2d, at 352–353 (involving a class of 1,899 individuals\nthat was awarded damages, fees, and costs of more than\n$14 million by a single arbitrator). Under the Class Rules,\n“the presumption of privacy and confidentiality” that\napplies in many bilateral arbitrations “shall not apply in\nclass arbitrations,” see Addendum to Brief for American\nArbitration Association as Amicus Curiae 10a (Class Rule\n9(a)), thus potentially frustrating the parties’ assumptions\nwhen they agreed to arbitrate. The arbitrator’s award no\nlonger purports to bind just the parties to a single arbitra­\ntion agreement, but adjudicates the rights of absent par­\nties as well. Cf. Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U. S. 815,\n846 (1999) (noting that “the burden of justification rests on\nthe exception” to the general rule that “one is not bound by\na judgment in personam in a litigation in which he is not\ndesignated as a party or to which he has not been made a\nparty by service of process” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). And the commercial stakes of class-action\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

We\nthink that the differences between bilateral and class­\naction arbitration are too great for arbitrators to presume,\nconsistent with their limited powers under the FAA, that\nthe parties’ mere silence on the issue of class-action arbi­\ntration constitutes consent to resolve their disputes in\nclass proceedings.10\n   The dissent minimizes these crucial differences by\ncharacterizing the question before the arbitrators as being\nmerely what “procedural mode” was available to present\nAnimalFeeds’ claims. Post, at 9. If the question were that\nsimple, there would be no need to consider the parties’\nintent with respect to class arbitration. See Howsam,\nsupra, at 84 (committing “procedural questions” presump­\ntively to the arbitrator’s discretion (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). But the FAA requires more. Contrary to\nthe dissent, but consistent with our precedents emphasiz­\ning the consensual basis of arbitration, we see the ques­\ntion as being whether the parties agreed to authorize class\narbitration. Here, where the parties stipulated that there\nwas “no agreement” on this question, it follows that the\nparties cannot be compelled to submit their dispute to\nclass arbitration.\n                             V\n   For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nis reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceed­\nings consistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n——————\n  10 We have no occasion to decide what contractual basis may support\na finding that the parties agreed to authorize class-action arbitration.\nHere, as noted, the parties stipulated that there was “no agreement” on\nthe issue of class-action arbitration.

The Court\nprematurely takes up that important question and, in\ndulging in de novo review, overturns the ruling of experi\nenced arbitrators.1\n  The Court errs in addressing an issue not ripe for judi\ncial review. Compounding that error, the Court substi\ntutes its judgment for that of the decisionmakers chosen\nby the parties. I would dismiss the petition as improvi\ndently granted.2 Were I to reach the merits, I would ad\nhere to the strict limitations the Federal Arbitration Act\n(FAA), 9 U. S. C. §1 et seq., places on judicial review of\narbitral awards. §10. Accordingly, I would affirm the\njudgment of the Second Circuit, which rejected petitioners’\nplea for vacation of the arbitrators’ decision.\n                              I\n  As the Court recounts, ante, at 2–6, this case was\nlaunched as a class action in federal court charging named\n——————\n  1 All  three panelists are leaders in the international-dispute\nresolution bar.

A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nocean carriers (collectively, Stolt-Nielsen) with a conspir\nacy to extract supracompetitive prices from their custom\ners (buyers of ocean-transportation services). That court\naction terminated when the Second Circuit held, first, that\nthe parties’ transactions were governed by contracts (char\nter parties) with enforceable arbitration clauses, and\nsecond, that the antitrust claims were arbitrable. JLM\nIndustries, Inc. v. Stolt-Nielsen S. A., 387 F. 3d 163, 175,\n181 (2004).\n   Cargo-shipper AnimalFeeds International Corp. (Ani\nmalFeeds) thereupon filed a demand for class arbitration\nof the antitrust-conspiracy claims.3 Stolt-Nielsen con\ntested AnimalFeeds’ right to proceed on behalf of a class,\nbut agreed to submission of that threshold dispute to a\npanel of arbitrators. Thus, the parties entered into a\nsupplemental agreement to choose arbitrators and in\nstruct them to “follow . . . Rul[e] 3 . . . of the American\nArbitration Association’s Supplementary Rules for Class\nArbitrations.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a. Rule 3, in turn,\ndirected the panel to “determine . . . whether the applica\nble arbitration clause permits the arbitration to proceed\non behalf of . . . a class.” App. 56a.\n   After receiving written submissions and hearing argu\nments, the arbitration panel rendered a clause\nconstruction award. It decided unanimously—and only—\nthat the “arbitration claus[e] [used in the parties’ stan\ndard-form shipping contracts] permit[s] this . . . arbitra\ntion to proceed as a class arbitration.” App. to Pet. for\nCert. 52a. Stolt-Nielsen petitioned for court review urging\nvacatur of the clause-construction award on the ground\n——————\n   3 Counsel for AnimalFeeds submitted in arbitration that “[i]t would\n\ncost . . . the vast majority of absent class members, and indeed the\ncurrent claimants, . . . more to litigate the matter on an individual basis\nthan they could recover. An antitrust case, particularly involving an\ninternational cartel[,] . . . is extraordinarily difficult and expensive to\nlitigate.” App. 82a (paragraph break omitted).\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nthat “the arbitrators [had] exceeded their powers.”\n§10(a)(4). The Court of Appeals upheld the award: “Be\ncause the parties specifically agreed that the arbitration\npanel would decide whether the arbitration claus[e] per\nmitted class arbitration,” the Second Circuit reasoned,\n“the arbitration panel did not exceed its authority in decid\ning that issue—irrespective of whether it decided the issue\ncorrectly.” 548 F. 3d 85, 101 (2008).\n                                II\n   I consider, first, the fitness of the arbitrators’ clause\nconstruction award for judicial review. The arbitrators\ndecided the issue, in accord with the parties’ supplemental\nagreement, “as a threshold matter.” App. 56a. Their\ndecision that the charter-party arbitration clause permit\nted class arbitration was abstract and highly interlocu\ntory. The panel did not decide whether the particular\nclaims AnimalFeeds advanced were suitable for class\nresolution, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a–49a; much less\ndid it delineate any class or consider whether, “if a class is\ncertified, . . . members of the putative class should be\nrequired to ‘opt in’ to th[e] proceeding,” id., at 52a.\n   The Court, ante, at 6, n. 2, does not persuasively justify\njudicial intervention so early in the game or convincingly\nreconcile its adjudication with the firm final-judgment\nrule prevailing in the federal court system. See, e.g., 28\nU. S. C. §1257 (providing for petitions for certiorari from\n“[f]inal judgments or decrees” of state courts); §1291 (pro\nviding for Court of Appeals review of district court “final\ndecisions”); Catlin v. United States, 324 U. S. 229, 233\n(1945) (describing “final decision” generally as “one which\nends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for\nthe court to do but execute the judgment”).\n   We have equated to “final decisions” a slim set of “col\nlateral orders” that share these characteristics: They “are\nconclusive, [they] resolve important questions separate\n4      STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nfrom the merits, and [they] are effectively unreviewable on\nappeal from the final judgment in the underlying action.”\nMohawk Industries, Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U. S. ___, ___\n(2009) (slip op., at 4–5) (quoting Swint v. Chambers\nCounty Comm’n, 514 U. S. 35, 42 (1995)). “[O]rders relat\ning to class certification” in federal court, it is settled, do\nnot fit that bill. Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S.\n463, 470 (1978).4\n   Congress, of course, can provide exceptions to the “final\ndecision” rule. Prescriptions in point include §1292 (im\nmediately appealable “[i]nterlocutory decisions”); §2072(c)\n(authorizing promulgation of rules defining when a dis\ntrict court ruling is final for purposes of appeal under\n§1291); Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(f) (pursuant to §1292(e),\naccords Courts of Appeals discretion to permit appeals\nfrom district court orders granting or denying class-action\ncertification); Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 54(b) (providing for\n“entry of a final judgment as to one or more, but fewer\nthan all, of the claims or parties”). Did Congress provide\nfor immediate review of the preliminary ruling in question\nhere?\n   Section 16 of the FAA, governing appellate review of\ndistrict court arbitration orders, lists as an appealable\ndisposition a district court decision “confirming or denying\nconfirmation of an award or partial award.” 9 U. S. C.\n§16(a)(1)(D). Notably, the arbitrators in the matter at\nhand labeled their decision “Partial Final Clause Con\nstruction Award.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a. It cannot be\ntrue, however, that parties or arbitrators can gain instant\nreview by slicing off a preliminary decision or a procedural\n——————\n  4 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f), adopted in response to Coopers\n\n& Lybrand, gives Courts of Appeals discretion to permit an appeal from\nan order granting or denying class-action certification. But the rule\nwould not permit review of a preliminary order of the kind at\nissue here, i.e., one that defers decision whether to grant or deny\ncertification.\n                      Cite as: 559 U.

G. v. M/V Capitan Constante,\n790 F. 2d 280, 283 (CA2 1986).5 Others have considered\n“partial award[s]” that finally “determin[e] liability, but\n. . . not . . . damages.” E.g., Hart Surgical, Inc. v. Ultraci\nsion, Inc., 244 F. 3d 231, 234 (CA1 2001).6 Another con\nfirmed an interim ruling on a “separate, discrete, inde\npendent, severable issue.” Island Creek Coal Sales Co. v.\nGainesville, 729 F. 2d 1046, 1049 (CA6 1984) (internal\nquotation marks omitted), abrogated on other grounds by\nCortez Byrd Chips, Inc. v. Bill Harbert Constr. Co., 529\nU. S. 193 (2000).\n    Receptivity to review of preliminary rulings rendered by\narbitrators, however, is hardly universal. See Dealer\nComputer Servs., Inc. v. Dub Herring Ford, 547 F. 3d 558\n(CA6 2008) (arbitration panel’s preliminary ruling that\ncontract did not bar class proceedings held not ripe for\nreview; arbitrators had not yet determined that arbitra\ntion should proceed on behalf of a class); Metallgesellschaft\nA. G., 790 F. 2d, at 283, 285 (Feinberg, C. J., dissenting)\n——————\n  5 See Metallgesellschaft A. G., 790 F. 2d, at 283, 284 (Feinberg, C. J.,\n\ndissenting) (describing exception for separate and independent claims\nas “creat[ing], in effect, an arbitration analogue to [Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.]\n54(b)”).\n  6 But see Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wetzel, 424 U. S. 737 (1976) (district\n\ncourt order determining liability but reserving decision on damages\nheld not immediately appealable).\n6      STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n(“[Piecemeal review] will make arbitration more like liti\ngation, a result not to be desired. It would be better to\nminimize the number of occasions the parties to arbitra\ntion can come to court; on the whole, this benefits the\nparties, the arbitration process and the courts.”).\n   While lower court opinions are thus divided, this much\nis plain: No decision of this Court, until today, has ever\napproved immediate judicial review of an arbitrator’s\ndecision as preliminary as the “partial award” made in\nthis case.7\n                             III\n  Even if Stolt-Nielsen had a plea ripe for judicial review,\nthe Court should reject it on the merits. Recall that the\nparties jointly asked the arbitrators to decide, initially,\nwhether the arbitration clause in their shipping contracts\npermitted class proceedings. See supra, at 2. The panel\ndid just what it was commissioned to do. It construed the\nbroad arbitration clause (covering “[a]ny dispute arising\nfrom the making, performance or termination of this\nCharter Party,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 47a) and ruled,\nexpressly and only, that the clause permitted class arbi\ntration. The Court acts without warrant in allowing Stolt-\nNielsen essentially to repudiate its submission of the\ncontract-construction issue to the arbitration panel, and to\ngain, in place of the arbitrators’ judgment, this Court’s de\nnovo determination.\n                            A\n    The controlling FAA prescription, §10(a),8 authorizes a\n——————\n  7 The parties agreed that the arbitrators would issue a “partial final\n\naward,” and then “stay all proceedings . . . to permit any party to move\na court of competent jurisdiction to confirm or to vacate” the award.\nApp. 56a.

Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 942 (1995). The four\ngrounds for vacatur codified in §10(a) restate the long\nstanding rule that, “[i]f [an arbitration] award is within\nthe submission, and contains the honest decision of the\narbitrators, after a full and fair hearing of the parties, a\ncourt . . . will not set [the award] aside for error, either in\nlaw or fact.” Burchell v. Marsh, 17 How. 344, 349 (1855).\n  The sole §10 ground Stolt-Nielsen invokes for vacating\nthe arbitrators’ decision is §10(a)(4). The question under\nthat provision is “whether the arbitrators had the power,\nbased on the parties’ submissions or the arbitration\nagreement, to reach a certain issue, not whether the arbi\ntrators correctly decided that issue.” DiRussa v. Dean\nWitter Reynolds Inc., 121 F. 3d 818, 824 (CA2 1997); Com\nprehensive Accounting Corp. v. Rudell, 760 F. 2d 138, 140\n(CA7 1985). The parties’ supplemental agreement, refer\nring the class-arbitration issue to an arbitration panel,\nundoubtedly empowered the arbitrators to render their\nclause-construction decision.      That scarcely debatable\npoint should resolve this case.\n\n\n——————\n  “In any of the following cases the United States court in and for the\ndistrict wherein the award was made may make an order vacating the\naward upon the application of any party to the arbitration—\n  “(1) where the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue\nmeans;\n  “(2) where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitra\ntors, or either of them;\n  “(3) where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to\npostpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to\nhear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other\nmisbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced; or\n  “(4) where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly\nexecuted them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the\nsubject matter submitted was not made.”\n8     STOLT-NIELSEN S.

Instead, the panel tied its conclusion\nthat the arbitration clause permitted class arbitration,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 52a, to New York law, federal mari\ntime law, and decisions made by other panels pursuant to\nRule 3 of the American Arbitration Association’s Supple\nmentary Rules for Class Arbitrations. Id., at 49a–50a.\n    At the outset of its explanation, the panel rejected the\nargument, proffered by AnimalFeeds, that this Court’s\ndecision in Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Bazzle, 539 U. S.\n444 (2003), settled the matter by “requir[ing] clear lan\nguage that forbids class arbitration in order to bar a class\naction.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a (emphasis added).\nAgreeing with Stolt-Nielsen in this regard, the panel said\nthat the test it employed looked to the language of the\nparticular agreement to gauge whether the parties “in\ntended to permit or to preclude class action[s].” Ibid.\nConcentrating on the wording of the arbitration clause,\nthe panel observed, is “consistent with New York law as\narticulated by the [New York] Court of Appeals . . . and\nwith federal maritime law.” Ibid.9\n    Emphasizing the breadth of the clause in question—\n“ ‘any dispute arising from the making, performance or\ntermination of this Charter Party’ shall be put to arbitra\ntion,” id., at 50a—the panel noted that numerous other\npartial awards had relied on language similarly compre\nhensive to permit class proceedings “in a wide variety of\nsettings.” Id., at 49a–50a. The panel further noted “that\nmany of the other panels [had] rejected arguments similar\nto those advanced by [Stolt-Nielsen].” Id., at 50a.\n——————\n  9 On New York law, the panel referred to Evans v.

S. ____ (2010)             9\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court features a statement counsel for Animal-\nFeeds made at the hearing before the arbitration panel,\nand maintains that it belies any argument that the clause\nin question permits class arbitration: “All the parties\nagree that when a contract is silent on an issue there’s\nbeen no agreement that has been reached on that issue.”\nAnte, at 4 (quoting App. 77a); see ante, at 8, 11–12, 20, 23,\nand n. 10. The sentence quoted from the hearing tran\nscript concluded: “therefore there has been no agreement\nto bar class arbitrations.” App. 77a (emphasis added).\nCounsel quickly clarified his position: “It’s also undisputed\nthat the arbitration clause here contains broad language\nand this language should be interpreted to permit class\narbitrations.” Id., at 79a. See also id., at 80a (noting\nconsistent recognition by arbitration panels that “a silent\nbroadly worded arbitration clause, just like the one at\nissue here, should be construed to permit class arbitra\ntion”); id., at 88a (“[B]road . . . language . . . silent as to\nclass proceedings should be interpreted to permit a class\nproceeding.”).\n   Stolt-Nielsen, the panel acknowledged, had vigorously\nargued, with the support of expert testimony, that “the\nbulk of international shippers would never intend to have\ntheir disputes decided in a class arbitration.” App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 52a. That concern, the panel suggested, might be\nmet at a later stage; “if a class is certified,” the panel\nnoted, class membership could be confined to those who\naffirmatively “ ‘opt in’ ” to the proceeding. Ibid.\n   The question properly before the Court is not whether\nthe arbitrators’ ruling was erroneous, but whether the\narbitrators “exceeded their powers.” §10(a)(4). The arbi\ntrators decided a threshold issue, explicitly committed to\nthem, see supra, at 2, about the procedural mode available\nfor presentation of AnimalFeeds’ antitrust claims. Cf.\nShady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P. A. v. Allstate Ins.\nCo., 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (plurality opinion) (slip op.,\n10      STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.\n\n                     GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nat 13–14) (“[R]ules allowing multiple claims (and claims\nby or against multiple parties) to be litigated together . . .\nneither change plaintiffs’ separate entitlements to relief\nnor abridge defendants’ rights; they alter only how the\nclaims are processed.”). That the arbitrators endeavored\nto perform their assigned task honestly is not contested.\n“Courts . . . do not sit to hear claims of factual or legal\nerror by an arbitrator as an appellate court does in review\ning decisions of lower courts.” Paperworkers v. Misco, Inc.,\n484 U. S. 29, 38 (1987). The arbitrators here not merely\n“arguably,” but certainly, “constru[ed] . . . the contract”\nwith fidelity to their commission. Ibid. This Court, there\nfore, may not disturb the arbitrators’ judgment, even if\nconvinced that “serious error” infected the panel’s award.\nIbid.\n                              C\n   The Court not only intrudes on a decision the parties\nreferred to arbitrators. It compounds the intrusion by\naccording the arbitrators no opportunity to clarify their\ndecision and thereby to cure the error the Court perceives.\nSection 10(b), the Court asserts, invests in this tribunal\nauthority to “decide the question that was originally re\nferred to the panel.” Ante, at 12. The controlling provi\nsion, however, says nothing of the kind. Section 10(b)\nreads, in full: “If an award is vacated and the time within\nwhich the agreement required the award to be made has\nnot expired, the court may, in its discretion, direct a re\nhearing by the arbitrators.” (Emphasis added.) Just as\n§10(a)(4) provides no justification for the Court’s disposi\ntion, see supra, at 6–9 and this page, so, too, §10(b) pro\nvides no grounding for the Court’s peremptory action.\n                             IV\n                              A\n     For arbitrators to consider whether a claim should\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

See ante, at 20 (“[A] party may not\nbe compelled under the FAA to submit to class arbitration\nunless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the\nparty agreed to do so.”); ante, at 23. The breadth of the\narbitration clause, and the absence of any provision waiv\ning or banning class proceedings,10 will not do. Ante, at\n20–23.\n    The Court ties the requirement of affirmative authoriza\ntion to “the basic precept that arbitration ‘is a matter of\nconsent, not coercion.’ ” Ante, at 17 (quoting Volt Informa\ntion Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford\nJunior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 479 (1989)). Parties may\n“specify with whom they choose to arbitrate,” the Court\nobserves, just as they may “limit the issues they choose to\narbitrate.” Ante, at 19. But arbitrators, in delineating an\nappropriate class, need not, and should not, disregard\nsuch contractual constraints. In this case, for example,\nAnimalFeeds proposes to pursue, on behalf of a class, only\n“claims . . . arising out of any [charter party agreement]\n. . . that provides for arbitration.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n56a (emphasis added). Should the arbitrators certify the\nproposed class, they would adjudicate only the rights of\npersons “with whom” Stolt-Nielsen agreed to arbitrate,\nand only “issues” subject to arbitration. Ante, at 19 (em\nphasis omitted).\n——————\n  10 Several courts have invalidated contractual bans on, or waivers of,\n\nclass arbitration because proceeding on an individual basis was not\nfeasible in view of the high costs entailed and the slim benefits achiev\nable. See, e.g., In re American Express Merchants’ Litigation, 554 F. 3d\n300, 315–316, 320 (CA2 2009); Kristian v. Comcast Corp., 446 F. 3d 25,\n55, 59 (CA1 2006); Discover Bank v.

Were there no right to proceed on\nbehalf of a class in the first place, however, a provision banning or\nwaiving recourse to this aggregation device would be superfluous.\n12    STOLT-NIELSEN S. A. v. ANIMALFEEDS INT’L CORP.\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court also links its affirmative-authorization re\nquirement to the parties’ right to stipulate rules under\nwhich arbitration may proceed. See ibid. The question,\nhowever, is the proper default rule when there is no stipu\nlation. Arbitration provisions, this Court has noted, are a\nspecies of forum-selection clauses. See Scherk v. Alberto-\nCulver Co., 417 U. S. 506, 519 (1974). Suppose the parties\nhad chosen a New York judicial forum for resolution of\n“any dispute” involving a contract for ocean carriage of\ngoods. There is little question that the designated court,\nstate or federal, would have authority to conduct claims\nlike AnimalFeeds’ on a class basis. Why should the class\naction prospect vanish when the “any dispute” clause is\ncontained in an arbitration agreement? Cf. Connecticut\nGeneral Life Ins. Co. v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada,\n210 F. 3d 771, 774–776 (CA7 2000) (reading contract’s\nauthorization to arbitrate “[a]ny dispute” to permit con\nsolidation of arbitrations). If the Court is right that arbi\ntrators ordinarily are not equipped to manage class pro\nceedings, see ante, at 21–22, then the claimant should\nretain its right to proceed in that format in court.\n                               B\n   When adjudication is costly and individual claims are no\nmore than modest in size, class proceedings may be “the\nthing,” i.e., without them, potential claimants will have\nlittle, if any, incentive to seek vindication of their rights.\nAmchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591, 617\n(1997); Carnegie v. Household Int’l, Inc., 376 F. 3d 656,\n661 (CA7 2004) (“The realistic alternative to a class action\nis not 17 million individual suits, but zero individual suits,\nas only a lunatic or a fanatic sues for $30.”). Mindful that\ndisallowance of class proceedings severely shrinks the\ndimensions of the case or controversy a claimant can\nmount, I note some stopping points in the Court’s decision.\n   First, the Court does not insist on express consent to\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          13\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nclass arbitration. Class arbitration may be ordered if\n“there is a contractual basis for concluding that the\npart[ies] agreed” “to submit to class arbitration”. Ante, at\n20; see ante, at 23, n. 10 (“We have no occasion to decide\nwhat contractual basis may support a finding that the\nparties agreed to authorize class-action arbitration.”).\nSecond, by observing that “the parties [here] are sophisti\ncated business entities,” and “that it is customary for the\nshipper to choose the charter party that is used for a\nparticular shipment,” the Court apparently spares from its\naffirmative-authorization requirement contracts of adhe\nsion presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Ante, at 20.\nWhile these qualifications limit the scope of the Court’s\ndecision, I remain persuaded that the arbitrators’ judg\nment should not have been disturbed.\n                       *     *    *\n  For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the petition\nfor want of a controversy ripe for judicial review. Were I\nto reach the merits, I would affirm the Second Circuit’s\njudgment confirming the arbitrators’ clause-construction\ndecision.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/78783/", "sha1": "5d56cca4b79590c483de9e74f47e1af747c8f172", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2009-042", "time_retrieved": "2010-04-27T23:44:07"}
