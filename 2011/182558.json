UNITED STATES\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 09–1555. Decided January 10, 2011\n\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins\nexcept for footnote 2, dissenting from the denial of certio\nrari.\n   Today the Court tacitly accepts the nullification of our\nrecent Commerce Clause jurisprudence. Joining other\nCircuits, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has\ndecided that an “implic[it] assum[ption]” of constitutional\nity in a 33-year old statutory interpretation opinion\n“carve[s] out” a separate constitutional place for statutes\nlike the one in this case and pre-empts a “careful parsing\nof post-Lopez case law.” 565 F. 3d 641, 645, 647, 648\n(2009) (citing Scarborough v. United States, 431 U. S. 563\n(1977)). That logic threatens the proper limits on Con\ngress’ commerce power and may allow Congress to exer\ncise police powers that our Constitution reserves to the\nStates. I would grant certiorari.\n                               I\n   Title 18 U. S. C. §931(a) makes it “unlawful for a person\nto purchase, own, or possess body armor, if that person\nhas been convicted of a felony that is . . . a crime of vio\nlence.” James Guelff and Chris McCurley Body Armor Act\nof 2002, §11009(e)(2)(A), 116 Stat. 1821. The statute\ndefines “body armor” as “any product sold or offered for\nsale, in interstate or foreign commerce, as personal protec\ntive body covering intended to protect against gunfire.” 18\nU. S. C. §921(a)(35).\n   In October 2005, federal prosecutors indicted Cedrick\n2               ALDERMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nAlderman under §931. Seattle police had stopped Alder\nman on suspicion of selling cocaine. The officers found no\ncocaine but discovered that Alderman was wearing a\nbulletproof vest. Although possession of the vest was legal\nunder Washington state law, the elements of §931 were\nsatisfied. Alderman had been convicted of robbery in\n1999, and the vest had been sold in interstate commerce\nthree years earlier when the California manufacturer sold\nit to a distributor in Washington State. 565 F. 3d, at 644.\nThere were no allegations that Alderman had purchased\nthe body armor from another State or ever carried it\nacross state lines.\n   Alderman entered a conditional guilty plea and was\nsentenced to 18 months in prison. He then appealed,\narguing that §931 exceeded Congress’ power under the\nCommerce Clause. U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 3. Over a\ndissent, a panel of the Ninth Circuit found §931 constitu\ntional. 565 F. 3d, at 648; ibid. (Paez, J., dissenting). The\nNinth Circuit denied rehearing en banc, with four judges\ndissenting. 593 F. 3d 1141 (2010) (O’Scannlain, J., dis\nsenting from denial of rehearing en banc).\n                             II\n   This Court has consistently recognized that the Consti\ntution imposes real limits on federal power. See Gregory\nv. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 457 (1991); Marbury v. Madi\nson, 1 Cranch 137, 176 (1803) (opinion for the Court by\nMarshall, C. J.) (“The powers of the legislature are de\nfined, and limited; and that those limits may not be mis\ntaken, or forgotten, the constitution is written”). It follows\nfrom the enumeration of specific powers that there are\nboundaries to what the Federal Government may do. See,\ne.g., Gibbons v.

S. ____ (2011)           3\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nof legislation.” United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 566\n(1995).\n   Recently we have endeavored to more sharply define\nand enforce limits on Congress’ enumerated “[p]ower . . .\n[t]o regulate Commerce . . . among the several States.”\nU. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 3. Lopez marked the first time\nin half a century that this Court held that an Act of Con\ngress exceeded its commerce power. We identified three\ncategories of activity that Congress’ commerce power\nauthorizes it to regulate: (1) the use of the channels of\ninterstate commerce; (2) the instrumentalities of inter\nstate commerce; and (3) “activities having a substantial\nrelation to interstate commerce . . . i.e., those activities\nthat substantially affect interstate commerce.” 514 U. S.,\nat 558–559. Emphasizing that we were unwilling to “con\nvert congressional authority under the Commerce Clause\nto a general police power,” id., at 567, we struck down a\nban on the possession of firearms within a 1,000-foot\nradius of schools because the statute did not regulate an\nactivity that “substantially affect[ed]” interstate com\nmerce, id., at 561.\n   Five years after Lopez, we reaffirmed the “substantial\neffects” test in United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598\n(2000). We rejected Congress’ attempt to “regulate none\nconomic, violent criminal conduct based solely on that\nconduct’s aggregate effect on interstate commerce,” and\nheld unconstitutional the civil remedy portion of the Vio\nlence Against Women Act of 1994. Id., at 617, 619. We\ncould think of “no better example of the police power,\nwhich the Founders denied the National Government and\nreposed in the States.” Id., at 618.\n                           III\n  In upholding §931(a), the Ninth Circuit recognized that\nLopez and Morrison had “significantly altered the land\nscape of congressional power under the Commerce Clause”\n4               ALDERMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nbut held that it was guided “first and foremost” by Scar\nborough, supra. 565 F. 3d, at 643, 645. In Scarborough,\nthis Court construed 18 U. S. C. App. §1202(a) (1970 ed.),\nwhich made it a crime for a felon to “receiv[e], posses[s], or\ntranspor[t] in commerce or affecting commerce” any fire\narm. 431 U. S., at 564. The question in that case was\nwhether the “statutorily required nexus between the\npossession of a firearm by a convicted felon and commerce”\ncould be satisfied by evidence that the gun had once trav\neled in interstate commerce. Ibid. The Court held that\nsuch evidence was sufficient, noting that the legislative\nhistory suggested that Congress wished to assert “ ‘its full\nCommerce Clause power.’ ” Id., at 571. No party alleged\nthat the statute exceeded Congress’ authority, and the\nCourt did not hold that the statute was constitutional.\nThe Ninth Circuit concluded that Scarborough had “im\nplicitly assumed the constitutionality of” §1202(a). 565\nF. 3d, at 645.\n  The Ninth Circuit discussed how it might apply Lopez\nand Morrison “when traveling in uncharted waters” but\nultimately concluded that it was “bound by Scarborough,”\nin which this Court had “blessed” a “nearly identical juris\ndictional hook.” 565 F. 3d, at 648. Although it would\n“generally analyze cases in the framework of th[e] three\n[Lopez] categories,” the Ninth Circuit determined that\nScarborough had “carved out” a separate constitutional\nniche for statutes like §931(a) and §1202(a). 565 F. 3d, at\n646–647. The Ninth Circuit thus upheld the statute with\nout “engag[ing] in the careful parsing of post-Lopez case\nlaw that would otherwise be required.” Id., at 648. The\ncourt recognized a tension between Scarborough and\nLopez but declined to “deviate from binding precedent.”\n565 F. 3d, at 646.\n  The dissent argued that the court had “effectively ren\nder[ed] the Supreme Court’s three-part Commerce Clause\nanalysis superfluous.” Id., at 648 (opinion of Paez, J.).\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    5\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nScarborough, the dissent explained, “decided only a ques\ntion of statutory interpretation.” 565 F. 3d, at 656. Sec\ntion 931 was, in the dissent’s view, unconstitutional be\ncause applying Lopez, “felon-possession of body armor does\nnot have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.” 565\nF. 3d, at 648.\n   The Ninth Circuit is not alone in its confusion about\nScarborough and Lopez. The Tenth Circuit, also uphold\ning §931 under Scarborough, has observed that “[l]ike our\nsister circuits, we see considerable tension between Scar\nborough and the three-category approach adopted by the\nSupreme Court in its recent Commerce Clause cases.”\nUnited States v. Patton, 451 F. 3d 615, 636 (2006).1 These\nCircuits have determined that “[a]ny doctrinal inconsis\ntency between Scarborough and the Supreme Court’s more\nrecent decisions is not for [us] to remedy,” ibid., and have\nstated their intent to follow Scarborough “until the Su\npreme Court tells us otherwise.” 565 F. 3d, at 648 (inter\nnal quotation marks and brackets omitted).\n                            IV\n  It is difficult to imagine a better case for certiorari.\nScarborough, as the lower courts have read it, cannot be\nreconciled with Lopez because it reduces the constitutional\nanalysis to the mere identification of a jurisdictional\nhook like the one in §1202(a). See 593 F. 3d, at 1142\n(O’Scannlain, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en\nbanc) (“The majority’s opinion makes Lopez superfluous”).\nIn fact, the Tenth Circuit has concluded that “[a]lthough\nthe body armor statute does not fit within any of the Lopez\n——————\n  1 Other Courts of Appeals, considering the constitutionality of differ\n\nent possession statutes, have applied Scarborough similarly, although\nthe issue has divided some panels. See, e.g., United States v. Bishop, 66\nF. 3d 569 (CA3 1995); id., at 595–596 (Becker, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part); United States v. Vasquez, 611 F. 3d 325 (CA7\n2010); id., at 337 (Manion, J., dissenting).\n6                 ALDERMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncategories, it is supported by the pre-Lopez precedent of\nScarborough.” Patton, supra, at 634.\n   Recognizing the conflict between Lopez and their inter\npretation of Scarborough, the lower courts have cried out\nfor guidance from this Court. See 565 F. 3d, at 643\n(“[A]bsent the Supreme Court or our en banc court telling\nus otherwise . . . the felon-in-possession of body armor\nstatute passes muster”); Patton, supra, at 636 (“We sus\npect the Supreme Court will revisit this issue in an appro\npriate case—maybe even this one”). This Court has a duty\nto defend the integrity of its precedents, and we should\ngrant certiorari to affirm that Lopez provides the proper\nframework for a Commerce Clause analysis of this type.2\n   Further, the lower courts’ reading of Scarborough, by\ntrumping the Lopez framework, could very well remove\nany limit on the commerce power. The Ninth Circuit’s\ninterpretation of Scarborough seems to permit Congress to\nregulate or ban possession of any item that has ever been\noffered for sale or crossed state lines. Congress arguably\ncould outlaw “the theft of a Hershey kiss from a corner\nstore in Youngstown, Ohio, by a neighborhood juvenile on\nthe basis that the candy once traveled . . . to the store from\nHershey, Pennsylvania.” United States v. Bishop, 66 F. 3d\n569, 596 (CA3 1995) (Becker, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part). The Government actually conceded at\noral argument in the Ninth Circuit that Congress could\nban possession of french fries that have been offered for\nsale in interstate commerce.\n   Such an expansion of federal authority would trespass\non traditional state police powers. See Morrison, 529\nU. S., at 618; Lopez, 514 U. S., at 566; id., at 584 (THOMAS,\n——————\n  2 I adhere to my previously stated views on the proper scope of the\n\nCommerce Clause. See United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 585\n(1995) (concurring opinion); United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598,\n627 (2000) (same); Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.

Before Congress enacted §931, the\nmajority of States already had employed their police pow\ners to address body armor and its use or possession by\ncriminals. The States’ different regimes range from laws\nrequiring sales of body armor to be face-to-face, to laws\nincreasing sentences for criminals who commit certain\ncrimes with weapons and body armor, to no regulation at\nall.3 Cf. Lopez, supra, at 581 (KENNEDY, J., concurring)\n(noting that more than 40 States had already outlawed\ngun possession at or near schools, and observing that “the\nreserved powers of the States are sufficient to enact those\nmeasures”).\n                        *    *     *\n  Fifteen years ago in Lopez, we took a significant step\ntoward reaffirming this Court’s commitment to proper\nconstitutional limits on Congress’ commerce power. If the\n\n——————\n  3 At  least 31 States have some form of body armor regulation. For\ninstance, Maryland makes it a crime to wear body armor while commit\nting certain crimes, Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. §4–106 (Lexis Supp.\n2010), and also prohibits individuals who have been convicted of crimes\nof violence or drug crimes from possessing, owning, or using body\narmor, although individuals may be exempted through a permit sys\ntem. §4–107 (Lexis 2002). Virginia makes it a Class 4 felony to wear\nbody armor while possessing a knife or firearm and committing a drug\nor violence offense. Va. Code Ann. §18.2–287.2 (Lexis 2009). North\nCarolina, by comparison, enhances all felony offenses by one class level\nif the offender wears or possesses body armor during the commission of\nthe felony. N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §15A–1340.16C (Lexis 2009). The\nStates also define “body armor” in many different ways. See M.\nPuckett, Body Armor: A Survey of State & Federal Law (2d ed. 2004).\nMontana, Hawaii, Alaska, Maine, Nebraska, and Rhode Island, among\nothers, have elected not to regulate body armor at all. See United\nStates v. Patton, 451 F. 3d 615, 631, n. 7 (CA10 2006) (categorizing the\nvarious state schemes).\n8              ALDERMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nLopez framework is to have any ongoing vitality, it is up to\nthis Court to prevent it from being undermined by a 1977\nprecedent that does not squarely address the constitu\ntional issue.

Sec\ntion 931 was, in the dissent’s view, unconstitutional be\ncause applying Lopez, “felon-possession of body armor does\nnot have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.” 565\nF. 3d, at 648.\n   The Ninth Circuit is not alone in its confusion about\nScarborough and Lopez. The Tenth Circuit, also uphold\ning §931 under Scarborough, has observed that “[l]ike our\nsister circuits, we see considerable tension between Scar\nborough and the three-category approach adopted by the\nSupreme Court in its recent Commerce Clause cases.”\nUnited States v. Patton, 451 F. 3d 615, 636 (2006).1 These\nCircuits have determined that “[a]ny doctrinal inconsis\ntency between Scarborough and the Supreme Court’s more\nrecent decisions is not for [us] to remedy,” ibid., and have\nstated their intent to follow Scarborough “until the Su\npreme Court tells us otherwise.” 565 F. 3d, at 648 (inter\nnal quotation marks and brackets omitted).\n                            IV\n  It is difficult to imagine a better case for certiorari.\nScarborough, as the lower courts have read it, cannot be\nreconciled with Lopez because it reduces the constitutional\nanalysis to the mere identification of a jurisdictional\nhook like the one in §1202(a). See 593 F. 3d, at 1142\n(O’Scannlain, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en\nbanc) (“The majority’s opinion makes Lopez superfluous”).\nIn fact, the Tenth Circuit has concluded that “[a]lthough\nthe body armor statute does not fit within any of the Lopez\n——————\n  1 Other Courts of Appeals, considering the constitutionality of differ\n\nent possession statutes, have applied Scarborough similarly, although\nthe issue has divided some panels. See, e.g., United States v. Bishop, 66\nF. 3d 569 (CA3 1995); id., at 595–596 (Becker, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part); United States v. Vasquez, 611 F. 3d 325 (CA7\n2010); id., at 337 (Manion, J., dissenting).\n6                 ALDERMAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncategories, it is supported by the pre-Lopez precedent of\nScarborough.” Patton, supra, at 634.\n   Recognizing the conflict between Lopez and their inter\npretation of Scarborough, the lower courts have cried out\nfor guidance from this Court. See 565 F. 3d, at 643\n(“[A]bsent the Supreme Court or our en banc court telling\nus otherwise . . . the felon-in-possession of body armor\nstatute passes muster”); Patton, supra, at 636 (“We sus\npect the Supreme Court will revisit this issue in an appro\npriate case—maybe even this one”). This Court has a duty\nto defend the integrity of its precedents, and we should\ngrant certiorari to affirm that Lopez provides the proper\nframework for a Commerce Clause analysis of this type.2\n   Further, the lower courts’ reading of Scarborough, by\ntrumping the Lopez framework, could very well remove\nany limit on the commerce power. The Ninth Circuit’s\ninterpretation of Scarborough seems to permit Congress to\nregulate or ban possession of any item that has ever been\noffered for sale or crossed state lines. Congress arguably\ncould outlaw “the theft of a Hershey kiss from a corner\nstore in Youngstown, Ohio, by a neighborhood juvenile on\nthe basis that the candy once traveled . . . to the store from\nHershey, Pennsylvania.” United States v. Bishop, 66 F. 3d\n569, 596 (CA3 1995) (Becker, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part). The Government actually conceded at\noral argument in the Ninth Circuit that Congress could\nban possession of french fries that have been offered for\nsale in interstate commerce.\n   Such an expansion of federal authority would trespass\non traditional state police powers. See Morrison, 529\nU. S., at 618; Lopez, 514 U. S., at 566; id., at 584 (THOMAS,\n——————\n  2 I adhere to my previously stated views on the proper scope of the\n\nCommerce Clause.

Before Congress enacted §931, the\nmajority of States already had employed their police pow\ners to address body armor and its use or possession by\ncriminals. The States’ different regimes range from laws\nrequiring sales of body armor to be face-to-face, to laws\nincreasing sentences for criminals who commit certain\ncrimes with weapons and body armor, to no regulation at\nall.3 Cf. Lopez, supra, at 581 (KENNEDY, J., concurring)\n(noting that more than 40 States had already outlawed\ngun possession at or near schools, and observing that “the\nreserved powers of the States are sufficient to enact those\nmeasures”).\n                        *    *     *\n  Fifteen years ago in Lopez, we took a significant step\ntoward reaffirming this Court’s commitment to proper\nconstitutional limits on Congress’ commerce power. If the\n\n——————\n  3 At  least 31 States have some form of body armor regulation. For\ninstance, Maryland makes it a crime to wear body armor while commit\nting certain crimes, Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. §4–106 (Lexis Supp.\n2010), and also prohibits individuals who have been convicted of crimes\nof violence or drug crimes from possessing, owning, or using body\narmor, although individuals may be exempted through a permit sys\ntem. §4–107 (Lexis 2002). Virginia makes it a Class 4 felony to wear\nbody armor while possessing a knife or firearm and committing a drug\nor violence offense. Va. Code Ann. §18.2–287.2 (Lexis 2009). North\nCarolina, by comparison, enhances all felony offenses by one class level\nif the offender wears or possesses body armor during the commission of\nthe felony. N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §15A–1340.16C (Lexis 2009). The\nStates also define “body armor” in many different ways. See M.\nPuckett, Body Armor: A Survey of State & Federal Law (2d ed. 2004).\nMontana, Hawaii, Alaska, Maine, Nebraska, and Rhode Island, among\nothers, have elected not to regulate body armor at all. See United\nStates v. Patton, 451 F. 3d 615, 631, n. 7 (CA10 2006) (categorizing the\nvarious state schemes).\n8              ALDERMAN v.
