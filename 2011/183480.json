NORTH AMERICAN STAINLESS, LP\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 09–291.      Argued December 7, 2010—Decided January 24, 2011\nAfter petitioner Thompson’s fiancée, Miriam Regalado, filed a sex dis­\n  crimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Com­\n  mission (EEOC) against their employer, respondent North American\n  Stainless (NAS), NAS fired Thompson. He filed his own charge and a\n  subsequent suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, claiming that\n  NAS fired him to retaliate against Regalado for filing her charge.\n  The District Court granted NAS summary judgment on the ground\n  that third-party retaliation claims were not permitted by Title VII,\n  which prohibits discrimination against an employee “because he has\n  made a [Title VII] charge,” 42 U. S. C. §2000e–3(a), and which per­\n  mits, inter alia, a “person claiming to be aggrieved . . . by [an] alleged\n  employment practice” to file a civil action, §2000e–5(f)(1). The en\n  banc Sixth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that Thompson was not enti­\n  tled to sue NAS for retaliation because he had not engaged in any ac­\n  tivity protected by the statute.\nHeld:\n    1. If the facts Thompson alleges are true, his firing by NAS consti­\n tuted unlawful retaliation. Title VII’s antiretaliation provision must\n be construed to cover a broad range of employer conduct. Burlington\n N. & S. F. R. Co. v. White, 548 U. S. 53. It prohibits any employer ac­\n tion that “ ‘well might have “dissuaded a reasonable worker from\n making or supporting a [discrimination] charge,” ’ ” id., at 68. That\n test must be applied in an objective fashion, to “avoi[d] the uncertain­\n ties and unfair discrepancies that can plague a judicial effort to de­\n termine a plaintiff’s unusual subjective feelings.” Id., at 68–69. A\n reasonable worker obviously might be dissuaded from engaging in\n protected activity if she knew that her fiancé would be fired. Pp. 2–4.\n    2. Title VII grants Thompson a cause of action. Pp. 4–7.\n2         THOMPSON v. NORTH AMERICAN STAINLESS, LP\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n          (a) For Title VII standing purposes, the term “person aggrieved”\n    must be construed more narrowly than the outer boundaries of Arti­\n    cle III. Dictum in Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U. S.\n    205, suggesting that Title VII’s aggrievement requirement reaches as\n    far as Article III permits, is too expansive and the Court declines to\n    follow it. At the other extreme, limiting “person aggrieved” to the\n    person who was the subject of unlawful retaliation is an artificially\n    narrow reading. A common usage of the term “person aggrieved”\n    avoids both of these extremes. The Administrative Procedure Act,\n    which authorizes suit to challenge a federal agency by any “person\n    . . . adversely affected or aggrieved . . . within the meaning of a rele­\n    vant statute,” 5 U. S. C. §702, establishes a regime under which a\n    plaintiff may not sue unless he “falls within the ‘zone of interests’\n    sought to be protected by the statutory provision whose violation\n    forms the legal basis for his complaint,” Lujan v. National Wildlife\n    Federation, 497 U. S. 871, 883. Title VII’s term “aggrieved” incorpo­\n    rates that test, enabling suit by any plaintiff with an interest “ ‘ar­\n    guably [sought] to be protected’ by the statutes,” National Credit Un\n    ion Admin. v. First Nat. Bank & Trust Co., 522 U. S. 479, 495, while\n    excluding plaintiffs who might technically be injured in an Article III\n    sense but whose interests are unrelated to Title VII’s statutory pro­\n    hibitions. Pp. 4–7.\n          (b) Applying that test here, Thompson falls within the zone of in­\n    terests protected by Title VII. He was an employee of NAS, and Title\n    VII’s purpose is to protect employees from their employers’ unlawful\n    actions. Moreover, accepting the facts as alleged, Thompson is not an\n    accidental victim of the retaliation. Hurting him was the unlawful\n    act by which NAS punished Regalado. Thus, Thompson is a person\n    aggrieved with standing to sue under Title VII.

NORTH\n\n             AMERICAN STAINLESS, LP\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                               [January 24, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Until 2003, both petitioner Eric Thompson and his\nfiancée, Miriam Regalado, were employees of respondent\nNorth American Stainless (NAS). In February 2003, the\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)\nnotified NAS that Regalado had filed a charge alleging sex\ndiscrimination. Three weeks later, NAS fired Thompson.\n   Thompson then filed a charge with the EEOC. After\nconciliation efforts proved unsuccessful, he sued NAS in\nthe United States District Court for the Eastern District of\nKentucky under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n78 Stat. 253, 42 U. S. C. §2000e et seq., claiming that NAS\nhad fired him in order to retaliate against Regalado for\nfiling her charge with the EEOC. The District Court\ngranted summary judgment to NAS, concluding that Title\nVII “does not permit third party retaliation claims.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2434876\"><a href=\"/opinion/2434876/thompson-v-north-american-stainless-lp/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

After a panel of the\nSixth Circuit reversed the District Court, the Sixth Circuit\ngranted rehearing en banc and affirmed by a 10-to-6 vote.\n567 F. 3d 804 (2009). The court reasoned that because\nThompson did not “engag[e] in any statutorily protected\n2      THOMPSON v. NORTH AMERICAN STAINLESS, LP\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nactivity, either on his own behalf or on behalf of Miriam\nRegalado,” he “is not included in the class of persons for\nwhom Congress created a retaliation cause of action.” Id.,\nat 807–808.\n  We granted certiorari. 561 U. S. ___ (2010).\n\n                              I\n    Title VII provides that “[i]t shall be an unlawful em­\nployment practice for an employer to discriminate against\nany of his employees . . . because he has made a charge”\nunder Title VII. 42 U. S. C. §2000e–3(a). The statute\npermits “a person claiming to be aggrieved” to file a charge\nwith the EEOC alleging that the employer committed an\nunlawful employment practice, and, if the EEOC declines\nto sue the employer, it permits a civil action to “be brought\n. . . by the person claiming to be aggrieved . . . by the al­\nleged unlawful employment practice.” §2000e–5(b), (f)(1).\n    It is undisputed that Regalado’s filing of a charge with\nthe EEOC was protected conduct under Title VII. In the\nprocedural posture of this case, we are also required to\nassume that NAS fired Thompson in order to retaliate\nagainst Regalado for filing a charge of discrimination.\nThis case therefore presents two questions: First, did\nNAS’s firing of Thompson constitute unlawful retaliation?\nAnd second, if it did, does Title VII grant Thompson a\ncause of action?\n\n                              II\n  With regard to the first question, we have little diffi­\nculty concluding that if the facts alleged by Thompson are\ntrue, then NAS’s firing of Thompson violated Title VII. In\nBurlington N. & S. F. R. Co. v. White, 548 U. S. 53 (2006),\nwe held that Title VII’s antiretaliation provision must be\nconstrued to cover a broad range of employer conduct. We\nreached that conclusion by contrasting the text of Title\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nVII’s antiretaliation provision with its substantive antidis­\ncrimination provision. Title VII prohibits discrimination\non the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin\n“ ‘with respect to . . . compensation, terms, conditions, or\nprivileges of employment,’ ” and discriminatory practices\nthat would “ ‘deprive any individual of employment oppor­\ntunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an\nemployee.’ ” Id., at 62 (quoting 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(a)\n(emphasis deleted)). In contrast, Title VII’s antiretaliation\nprovision prohibits an employer from “ ‘discriminat[ing]\nagainst any of his employees’ ” for engaging in protected\nconduct, without specifying the employer acts that are\nprohibited. 548 U. S., at 62 (quoting §2000e–3(a) (empha­\nsis deleted)). Based on this textual distinction and our\nunderstanding of the antiretaliation provision’s purpose,\nwe held that “the antiretaliation provision, unlike the\nsubstantive provision, is not limited to discriminatory\nactions that affect the terms and conditions of employ­\nment.” Id., at 64. Rather, Title VII’s antiretaliation pro­\nvision prohibits any employer action that “well might have\ndissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting\na charge of discrimination.” Id., at 68 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   We think it obvious that a reasonable worker might be\ndissuaded from engaging in protected activity if she knew\nthat her fiancé would be fired. Indeed, NAS does not\ndispute that Thompson’s firing meets the standard set\nforth in Burlington. Tr. of Oral Arg. 30. NAS raises the\nconcern, however, that prohibiting reprisals against third\nparties will lead to difficult line-drawing problems con­\ncerning the types of relationships entitled to protection.\nPerhaps retaliating against an employee by firing his\nfiancée would dissuade the employee from engaging in\nprotected activity, but what about firing an employee’s\ngirlfriend, close friend, or trusted co-worker? Applying the\nBurlington standard to third-party reprisals, NAS argues,\n4      THOMPSON v. NORTH AMERICAN STAINLESS, LP\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwill place the employer at risk any time it fires any em­\nployee who happens to have a connection to a different\nemployee who filed a charge with the EEOC.\n   Although we acknowledge the force of this point, we do\nnot think it justifies a categorical rule that third-party\nreprisals do not violate Title VII. As explained above, we\nadopted a broad standard in Burlington because Title\nVII’s antiretaliation provision is worded broadly. We\nthink there is no textual basis for making an exception to\nit for third-party reprisals, and a preference for clear rules\ncannot justify departing from statutory text.\n   We must also decline to identify a fixed class of relation­\nships for which third-party reprisals are unlawful. We\nexpect that firing a close family member will almost al­\nways meet the Burlington standard, and inflicting a\nmilder reprisal on a mere acquaintance will almost never\ndo so, but beyond that we are reluctant to generalize. As\nwe explained in Burlington, 548 U. S., at 69, “the signifi­\ncance of any given act of retaliation will often depend upon\nthe particular circumstances.” Given the broad statutory\ntext and the variety of workplace contexts in which re­\ntaliation may occur, Title VII’s antiretaliation provision is\nsimply not reducible to a comprehensive set of clear rules.\nWe emphasize, however, that “the provision’s standard for\njudging harm must be objective,” so as to “avoi[d] the\nuncertainties and unfair discrepancies that can plague a\njudicial effort to determine a plaintiff’s unusual subjective\nfeelings.” Id., at 68–69.\n                            III\n  The more difficult question in this case is whether\nThompson may sue NAS for its alleged violation of Title\nVII. The statute provides that “a civil action may be\nbrought . . . by the person claiming to be aggrieved.” 42\nU. S. C. §2000e–5(f)(1). The Sixth Circuit concluded that\nthis provision was merely a reiteration of the requirement\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the plaintiff have Article III standing. 567 F. 3d, at\n808, n. 1. We do not understand how that can be. The\nprovision unquestionably permits a person “claiming to be\naggrieved” to bring “a civil action.” It is arguable that the\naggrievement referred to is nothing more than the mini­\nmal Article III standing, which consists of injury in fact\ncaused by the defendant and remediable by the court. See\nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560–561\n(1992). But Thompson’s claim undoubtedly meets those\nrequirements, so if that is indeed all that aggrievement\nconsists of, he may sue.\n  We have suggested in dictum that the Title VII ag­\ngrievement requirement conferred a right to sue on all\nwho satisfied Article III standing. Trafficante v. Metro\npolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U. S. 205 (1972), involved the\n“person aggrieved” provision of Title VIII (the Fair Hous­\ning Act) rather than Title VII. In deciding the case, how­\never, we relied upon, and cited with approval, a Third\nCircuit opinion involving Title VII, which, we said, “con­\ncluded that the words used showed ‘a congressional\nintention to define standing as broadly as is permitted by\nArticle III of the Constitution.’ ” Id., at 209 (quoting\nHackett v. McGuire Bros., Inc., 445 F. 2d 442, 446 (1971)).\nWe think that dictum regarding Title VII was too expan­\nsive. Indeed, the Trafficante opinion did not adhere to it\nin expressing its Title VIII holding that residents of an\napartment complex could sue the owner for his racial\ndiscrimination against prospective tenants. The opinion\nsaid that the “person aggrieved” of Title VIII was coexten­\nsive with Article III “insofar as tenants of the same hous\ning unit that is charged with discrimination are con\ncerned.” 409 U. S., at 209 (emphasis added). Later\nopinions, we must acknowledge, reiterate that the term\n“aggrieved” in Title VIII reaches as far as Article III per­\nmits, see Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, 165–166 (1997);\nGladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U. S. 91,\n6      THOMPSON v. NORTH AMERICAN STAINLESS, LP\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n109 (1979), though the holdings of those cases are com­\npatible with the “zone of interests” limitation that we\ndiscuss below. In any event, it is Title VII rather than\nTitle VIII that is before us here, and as to that we are\nsurely not bound by the Trafficante dictum.\n  We now find that this dictum was ill-considered, and we\ndecline to follow it. If any person injured in the Article III\nsense by a Title VII violation could sue, absurd conse­\nquences would follow. For example, a shareholder would\nbe able to sue a company for firing a valuable employee for\nracially discriminatory reasons, so long as he could show\nthat the value of his stock decreased as a consequence. At\noral argument Thompson acknowledged that such a suit\nwould not lie, Tr. of Oral Arg. 5–6. We agree, and there­\nfore conclude that the term “aggrieved” must be construed\nmore narrowly than the outer boundaries of Article III.\n  At the other extreme from the position that “person\naggrieved” means anyone with Article III standing, NAS\nargues that it is a term of art that refers only to the em­\nployee who engaged in the protected activity. We know of\nno other context in which the words carry this artificially\nnarrow meaning, and if that is what Congress intended it\nwould more naturally have said “person claiming to have\nbeen discriminated against” rather than “person claiming\nto be aggrieved.” We see no basis in text or prior practice\nfor limiting the latter phrase to the person who was the\nsubject of unlawful retaliation. Moreover, such a reading\ncontradicts the very holding of Trafficante, which was that\nresidents of an apartment complex were “person[s] ag­\ngrieved” by discrimination against prospective tenants.\nWe see no reason why the same phrase in Title VII should\nbe given a narrower meaning.\n  In our view there is a common usage of the term “person\naggrieved” that avoids the extremity of equating it with\nArticle III and yet is fully consistent with our application\nof the term in Trafficante.

C. §551 et seq., authorizes suit to challenge a\nfederal agency by any “person . . . adversely affected or\naggrieved . . . within the meaning of a relevant statute.”\n§702. We have held that this language establishes a\nregime under which a plaintiff may not sue unless he\n“falls within the ‘zone of interests’ sought to be protected\nby the statutory provision whose violation forms the legal\nbasis for his complaint.” Lujan v. National Wildlife Fed\neration, 497 U. S. 871, 883 (1990). We have described the\n“zone of interests” test as denying a right of review “if\nthe plaintiff’s interests are so marginally related to or in­\nconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it\ncannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to\npermit the suit.” Clarke v. Securities Industry Assn., 479\nU. S. 388, 399–400 (1987). We hold that the term “ag­\ngrieved” in Title VII incorporates this test, enabling suit\nby any plaintiff with an interest “arguably [sought] to be\nprotected by the statutes,” National Credit Union Admin.\nv. First Nat. Bank & Trust Co., 522 U. S. 479, 495 (1998)\n(internal quotation marks omitted), while excluding plain­\ntiffs who might technically be injured in an Article III\nsense but whose interests are unrelated to the statutory\nprohibitions in Title VII.\n   Applying that test here, we conclude that Thompson\nfalls within the zone of interests protected by Title VII.\nThompson was an employee of NAS, and the purpose of\nTitle VII is to protect employees from their employers’\nunlawful actions. Moreover, accepting the facts as alleged,\nThompson is not an accidental victim of the retaliation—\ncollateral damage, so to speak, of the employer’s unlawful\nact. To the contrary, injuring him was the employer’s\nintended means of harming Regalado. Hurting him was\nthe unlawful act by which the employer punished her. In\nthose circumstances, we think Thompson well within the\nzone of interests sought to be protected by Title VII. He is\na person aggrieved with standing to sue.\n8      THOMPSON v.

In\nits Compliance Manual, the EEOC counsels that Title VII\n“prohibit[s] retaliation against someone so closely related\nto or associated with the person exercising his or her\nstatutory rights that it would discourage or prevent the\nperson from pursuing those rights. ” Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 12–13 (quoting EEOC Compli\nance Manual §8–II(C)(3) (1998)). Such retaliation “can be\nchallenged,” the Manual affirms, “by both the individual\nwho engaged in protected activity and the relative, where\nboth are employees.” Id., at 25–26 (quoting Compliance\nManual §8–II(B)(3)(c)). The EEOC’s statements in the\nManual merit deference under Skidmore v. Swift & Co.,\n323 U. S. 134 (1944). See Federal Express Corp. v.\nHolowecki, 552 U. S. 389, 399–400 (2008). The EEOC’s\ninterpretation of Title VII, I further note, is consistent\nwith interpretations of analogous statutes by other federal\nagencies. See, e.g., NLRB v. Advertisers Mfg.

Argued December 7, 2010—Decided January 24, 2011\nAfter petitioner Thompson’s fiancée, Miriam Regalado, filed a sex dis­\n  crimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Com­\n  mission (EEOC) against their employer, respondent North American\n  Stainless (NAS), NAS fired Thompson. He filed his own charge and a\n  subsequent suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, claiming that\n  NAS fired him to retaliate against Regalado for filing her charge.\n  The District Court granted NAS summary judgment on the ground\n  that third-party retaliation claims were not permitted by Title VII,\n  which prohibits discrimination against an employee “because he has\n  made a [Title VII] charge,” 42 U. S. C. §2000e–3(a), and which per­\n  mits, inter alia, a “person claiming to be aggrieved . . . by [an] alleged\n  employment practice” to file a civil action, §2000e–5(f)(1). The en\n  banc Sixth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that Thompson was not enti­\n  tled to sue NAS for retaliation because he had not engaged in any ac­\n  tivity protected by the statute.\nHeld:\n    1. If the facts Thompson alleges are true, his firing by NAS consti­\n tuted unlawful retaliation. Title VII’s antiretaliation provision must\n be construed to cover a broad range of employer conduct. Burlington\n N. & S. F. R. Co. v. White, 548 U. S. 53. It prohibits any employer ac­\n tion that “ ‘well might have “dissuaded a reasonable worker from\n making or supporting a [discrimination] charge,” ’ ” id., at 68. That\n test must be applied in an objective fashion, to “avoi[d] the uncertain­\n ties and unfair discrepancies that can plague a judicial effort to de­\n termine a plaintiff’s unusual subjective feelings.” Id., at 68–69. A\n reasonable worker obviously might be dissuaded from engaging in\n protected activity if she knew that her fiancé would be fired. Pp. 2–4.\n    2. Title VII grants Thompson a cause of action. Pp. 4–7.\n2         THOMPSON v. NORTH AMERICAN STAINLESS, LP\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n          (a) For Title VII standing purposes, the term “person aggrieved”\n    must be construed more narrowly than the outer boundaries of Arti­\n    cle III. Dictum in Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U. S.\n    205, suggesting that Title VII’s aggrievement requirement reaches as\n    far as Article III permits, is too expansive and the Court declines to\n    follow it. At the other extreme, limiting “person aggrieved” to the\n    person who was the subject of unlawful retaliation is an artificially\n    narrow reading. A common usage of the term “person aggrieved”\n    avoids both of these extremes. The Administrative Procedure Act,\n    which authorizes suit to challenge a federal agency by any “person\n    . . . adversely affected or aggrieved . . . within the meaning of a rele­\n    vant statute,” 5 U. S. C. §702, establishes a regime under which a\n    plaintiff may not sue unless he “falls within the ‘zone of interests’\n    sought to be protected by the statutory provision whose violation\n    forms the legal basis for his complaint,” Lujan v. National Wildlife\n    Federation, 497 U. S. 871, 883. Title VII’s term “aggrieved” incorpo­\n    rates that test, enabling suit by any plaintiff with an interest “ ‘ar­\n    guably [sought] to be protected’ by the statutes,” National Credit Un\n    ion Admin. v. First Nat. Bank & Trust Co., 522 U. S. 479, 495, while\n    excluding plaintiffs who might technically be injured in an Article III\n    sense but whose interests are unrelated to Title VII’s statutory pro­\n    hibitions. Pp. 4–7.\n          (b) Applying that test here, Thompson falls within the zone of in­\n    terests protected by Title VII. He was an employee of NAS, and Title\n    VII’s purpose is to protect employees from their employers’ unlawful\n    actions. Moreover, accepting the facts as alleged, Thompson is not an\n    accidental victim of the retaliation. Hurting him was the unlawful\n    act by which NAS punished Regalado. Thus, Thompson is a person\n    aggrieved with standing to sue under Title VII.

THOMPSON, PETITIONER v. NORTH\n\n             AMERICAN STAINLESS, LP\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                               [January 24, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Until 2003, both petitioner Eric Thompson and his\nfiancée, Miriam Regalado, were employees of respondent\nNorth American Stainless (NAS). In February 2003, the\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)\nnotified NAS that Regalado had filed a charge alleging sex\ndiscrimination. Three weeks later, NAS fired Thompson.\n   Thompson then filed a charge with the EEOC. After\nconciliation efforts proved unsuccessful, he sued NAS in\nthe United States District Court for the Eastern District of\nKentucky under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n78 Stat. 253, 42 U. S. C. §2000e et seq., claiming that NAS\nhad fired him in order to retaliate against Regalado for\nfiling her charge with the EEOC. The District Court\ngranted summary judgment to NAS, concluding that Title\nVII “does not permit third party retaliation claims.” 435\nF. Supp. 2d 633, 639 (ED Ky. 2006). After a panel of the\nSixth Circuit reversed the District Court, the Sixth Circuit\ngranted rehearing en banc and affirmed by a 10-to-6 vote.\n567 F. 3d 804 (2009). The court reasoned that because\nThompson did not “engag[e] in any statutorily protected\n2      THOMPSON v. NORTH AMERICAN STAINLESS, LP\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nactivity, either on his own behalf or on behalf of Miriam\nRegalado,” he “is not included in the class of persons for\nwhom Congress created a retaliation cause of action.” Id.,\nat 807–808.\n  We granted certiorari. 561 U. S. ___ (2010).\n\n                              I\n    Title VII provides that “[i]t shall be an unlawful em­\nployment practice for an employer to discriminate against\nany of his employees . . . because he has made a charge”\nunder Title VII. 42 U. S. C. §2000e–3(a). The statute\npermits “a person claiming to be aggrieved” to file a charge\nwith the EEOC alleging that the employer committed an\nunlawful employment practice, and, if the EEOC declines\nto sue the employer, it permits a civil action to “be brought\n. . . by the person claiming to be aggrieved . . . by the al­\nleged unlawful employment practice.” §2000e–5(b), (f)(1).\n    It is undisputed that Regalado’s filing of a charge with\nthe EEOC was protected conduct under Title VII. In the\nprocedural posture of this case, we are also required to\nassume that NAS fired Thompson in order to retaliate\nagainst Regalado for filing a charge of discrimination.\nThis case therefore presents two questions: First, did\nNAS’s firing of Thompson constitute unlawful retaliation?\nAnd second, if it did, does Title VII grant Thompson a\ncause of action?\n\n                              II\n  With regard to the first question, we have little diffi­\nculty concluding that if the facts alleged by Thompson are\ntrue, then NAS’s firing of Thompson violated Title VII. In\nBurlington N. & S. F. R. Co. v. White, 548 U. S. 53 (2006),\nwe held that Title VII’s antiretaliation provision must be\nconstrued to cover a broad range of employer conduct. We\nreached that conclusion by contrasting the text of Title\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nVII’s antiretaliation provision with its substantive antidis­\ncrimination provision. Title VII prohibits discrimination\non the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin\n“ ‘with respect to . . . compensation, terms, conditions, or\nprivileges of employment,’ ” and discriminatory practices\nthat would “ ‘deprive any individual of employment oppor­\ntunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an\nemployee.’ ” Id., at 62 (quoting 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(a)\n(emphasis deleted)). In contrast, Title VII’s antiretaliation\nprovision prohibits an employer from “ ‘discriminat[ing]\nagainst any of his employees’ ” for engaging in protected\nconduct, without specifying the employer acts that are\nprohibited. 548 U. S., at 62 (quoting §2000e–3(a) (empha­\nsis deleted)). Based on this textual distinction and our\nunderstanding of the antiretaliation provision’s purpose,\nwe held that “the antiretaliation provision, unlike the\nsubstantive provision, is not limited to discriminatory\nactions that affect the terms and conditions of employ­\nment.” Id., at 64. Rather, Title VII’s antiretaliation pro­\nvision prohibits any employer action that “well might have\ndissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting\na charge of discrimination.” Id., at 68 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   We think it obvious that a reasonable worker might be\ndissuaded from engaging in protected activity if she knew\nthat her fiancé would be fired. Indeed, NAS does not\ndispute that Thompson’s firing meets the standard set\nforth in Burlington. Tr. of Oral Arg. 30. NAS raises the\nconcern, however, that prohibiting reprisals against third\nparties will lead to difficult line-drawing problems con­\ncerning the types of relationships entitled to protection.\nPerhaps retaliating against an employee by firing his\nfiancée would dissuade the employee from engaging in\nprotected activity, but what about firing an employee’s\ngirlfriend, close friend, or trusted co-worker? Applying the\nBurlington standard to third-party reprisals, NAS argues,\n4      THOMPSON v. NORTH AMERICAN STAINLESS, LP\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwill place the employer at risk any time it fires any em­\nployee who happens to have a connection to a different\nemployee who filed a charge with the EEOC.\n   Although we acknowledge the force of this point, we do\nnot think it justifies a categorical rule that third-party\nreprisals do not violate Title VII. As explained above, we\nadopted a broad standard in Burlington because Title\nVII’s antiretaliation provision is worded broadly. We\nthink there is no textual basis for making an exception to\nit for third-party reprisals, and a preference for clear rules\ncannot justify departing from statutory text.\n   We must also decline to identify a fixed class of relation­\nships for which third-party reprisals are unlawful. We\nexpect that firing a close family member will almost al­\nways meet the Burlington standard, and inflicting a\nmilder reprisal on a mere acquaintance will almost never\ndo so, but beyond that we are reluctant to generalize. As\nwe explained in Burlington, 548 U. S., at 69, “the signifi­\ncance of any given act of retaliation will often depend upon\nthe particular circumstances.” Given the broad statutory\ntext and the variety of workplace contexts in which re­\ntaliation may occur, Title VII’s antiretaliation provision is\nsimply not reducible to a comprehensive set of clear rules.\nWe emphasize, however, that “the provision’s standard for\njudging harm must be objective,” so as to “avoi[d] the\nuncertainties and unfair discrepancies that can plague a\njudicial effort to determine a plaintiff’s unusual subjective\nfeelings.” Id., at 68–69.\n                            III\n  The more difficult question in this case is whether\nThompson may sue NAS for its alleged violation of Title\nVII. The statute provides that “a civil action may be\nbrought . . . by the person claiming to be aggrieved.” 42\nU. S. C. §2000e–5(f)(1). The Sixth Circuit concluded that\nthis provision was merely a reiteration of the requirement\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the plaintiff have Article III standing. 567 F. 3d, at\n808, n. 1. We do not understand how that can be. The\nprovision unquestionably permits a person “claiming to be\naggrieved” to bring “a civil action.” It is arguable that the\naggrievement referred to is nothing more than the mini­\nmal Article III standing, which consists of injury in fact\ncaused by the defendant and remediable by the court. See\nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560–561\n(1992). But Thompson’s claim undoubtedly meets those\nrequirements, so if that is indeed all that aggrievement\nconsists of, he may sue.\n  We have suggested in dictum that the Title VII ag­\ngrievement requirement conferred a right to sue on all\nwho satisfied Article III standing. Trafficante v. Metro\npolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U. S. 205 (1972), involved the\n“person aggrieved” provision of Title VIII (the Fair Hous­\ning Act) rather than Title VII. In deciding the case, how­\never, we relied upon, and cited with approval, a Third\nCircuit opinion involving Title VII, which, we said, “con­\ncluded that the words used showed ‘a congressional\nintention to define standing as broadly as is permitted by\nArticle III of the Constitution.’ ” Id., at 209 (quoting\nHackett v. McGuire Bros., Inc., 445 F. 2d 442, 446 (1971)).\nWe think that dictum regarding Title VII was too expan­\nsive. Indeed, the Trafficante opinion did not adhere to it\nin expressing its Title VIII holding that residents of an\napartment complex could sue the owner for his racial\ndiscrimination against prospective tenants. The opinion\nsaid that the “person aggrieved” of Title VIII was coexten­\nsive with Article III “insofar as tenants of the same hous\ning unit that is charged with discrimination are con\ncerned.” 409 U. S., at 209 (emphasis added). Later\nopinions, we must acknowledge, reiterate that the term\n“aggrieved” in Title VIII reaches as far as Article III per­\nmits, see Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, 165–166 (1997);\nGladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U. S. 91,\n6      THOMPSON v. NORTH AMERICAN STAINLESS, LP\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n109 (1979), though the holdings of those cases are com­\npatible with the “zone of interests” limitation that we\ndiscuss below. In any event, it is Title VII rather than\nTitle VIII that is before us here, and as to that we are\nsurely not bound by the Trafficante dictum.\n  We now find that this dictum was ill-considered, and we\ndecline to follow it. If any person injured in the Article III\nsense by a Title VII violation could sue, absurd conse­\nquences would follow. For example, a shareholder would\nbe able to sue a company for firing a valuable employee for\nracially discriminatory reasons, so long as he could show\nthat the value of his stock decreased as a consequence. At\noral argument Thompson acknowledged that such a suit\nwould not lie, Tr. of Oral Arg. 5–6. We agree, and there­\nfore conclude that the term “aggrieved” must be construed\nmore narrowly than the outer boundaries of Article III.\n  At the other extreme from the position that “person\naggrieved” means anyone with Article III standing, NAS\nargues that it is a term of art that refers only to the em­\nployee who engaged in the protected activity. We know of\nno other context in which the words carry this artificially\nnarrow meaning, and if that is what Congress intended it\nwould more naturally have said “person claiming to have\nbeen discriminated against” rather than “person claiming\nto be aggrieved.” We see no basis in text or prior practice\nfor limiting the latter phrase to the person who was the\nsubject of unlawful retaliation. Moreover, such a reading\ncontradicts the very holding of Trafficante, which was that\nresidents of an apartment complex were “person[s] ag­\ngrieved” by discrimination against prospective tenants.\nWe see no reason why the same phrase in Title VII should\nbe given a narrower meaning.\n  In our view there is a common usage of the term “person\naggrieved” that avoids the extremity of equating it with\nArticle III and yet is fully consistent with our application\nof the term in Trafficante.

We have held that this language establishes a\nregime under which a plaintiff may not sue unless he\n“falls within the ‘zone of interests’ sought to be protected\nby the statutory provision whose violation forms the legal\nbasis for his complaint.” Lujan v. National Wildlife Fed\neration, 497 U. S. 871, 883 (1990). We have described the\n“zone of interests” test as denying a right of review “if\nthe plaintiff’s interests are so marginally related to or in­\nconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it\ncannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to\npermit the suit.” Clarke v. Securities Industry Assn., 479\nU. S. 388, 399–400 (1987). We hold that the term “ag­\ngrieved” in Title VII incorporates this test, enabling suit\nby any plaintiff with an interest “arguably [sought] to be\nprotected by the statutes,” National Credit Union Admin.\nv. First Nat. Bank & Trust Co., 522 U. S. 479, 495 (1998)\n(internal quotation marks omitted), while excluding plain­\ntiffs who might technically be injured in an Article III\nsense but whose interests are unrelated to the statutory\nprohibitions in Title VII.\n   Applying that test here, we conclude that Thompson\nfalls within the zone of interests protected by Title VII.\nThompson was an employee of NAS, and the purpose of\nTitle VII is to protect employees from their employers’\nunlawful actions. Moreover, accepting the facts as alleged,\nThompson is not an accidental victim of the retaliation—\ncollateral damage, so to speak, of the employer’s unlawful\nact. To the contrary, injuring him was the employer’s\nintended means of harming Regalado. Hurting him was\nthe unlawful act by which the employer punished her. In\nthose circumstances, we think Thompson well within the\nzone of interests sought to be protected by Title VII. He is\na person aggrieved with standing to sue.\n8      THOMPSON v.

In\nits Compliance Manual, the EEOC counsels that Title VII\n“prohibit[s] retaliation against someone so closely related\nto or associated with the person exercising his or her\nstatutory rights that it would discourage or prevent the\nperson from pursuing those rights. ” Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 12–13 (quoting EEOC Compli\nance Manual §8–II(C)(3) (1998)). Such retaliation “can be\nchallenged,” the Manual affirms, “by both the individual\nwho engaged in protected activity and the relative, where\nboth are employees.” Id., at 25–26 (quoting Compliance\nManual §8–II(B)(3)(c)). The EEOC’s statements in the\nManual merit deference under Skidmore v. Swift & Co.,\n323 U. S. 134 (1944). See Federal Express Corp. v.\nHolowecki, 552 U. S. 389, 399–400 (2008).
