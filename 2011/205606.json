BRYANT\r\n\r\n       CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MICHIGAN\r\n\r\n   No. 09–150.      Argued October 5, 2010—Decided February 28, 2011\r\nMichigan police dispatched to a gas station parking lot found Anthony\r\n Covington mortally wounded. Covington told them that he had been\r\n shot by respondent Bryant outside Bryant’s house and had then\r\n driven himself to the lot. At trial, which occurred before Crawford v.\r\n Washington, 541 U. S. 36, and Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813,\r\n were decided, the officers testified about what Covington said. Bry\r\n ant was found guilty of, inter alia, second-degree murder. Ulti\r\n mately, the Michigan Supreme Court reversed his conviction, holding\r\n that the Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause, as explained in\r\n Crawford and Davis, rendered Covington’s statements inadmissible\r\n testimonial hearsay.\r\nHeld: Covington’s identification and description of the shooter and the\r\n location of the shooting were not testimonial statements because they\r\n had a “primary purpose . . . to enable police assistance to meet an on\r\n going emergency.” Davis, 547 U. S., at 822. Therefore, their admis\r\n sion at Bryant’s trial did not violate the Confrontation Clause. Pp. 5–\r\n 32.\r\n    (a) In Crawford, this Court held that in order for testimonial evi\r\n dence to be admissible, the Sixth Amendment “demands . . . unavail\r\n ability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.” 541 U. S., at\r\n 68. Crawford did not “spell out a comprehensive definition of ‘testi\r\n monial,’ ” but it noted that testimonial evidence includes, among\r\n other things, “police interrogations.” Ibid. Thus, Sylvia Crawford’s\r\n statements during a station-house interrogation about a stabbing\r\n were testimonial, and their admission when her husband, the ac\r\n cused, had “no opportunity” for cross-examination due to spousal\r\n privilege made out a Sixth Amendment violation. In Davis and\r\n Hammon, both domestic violence cases, the Court explained that\r\n “[s]tatements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police\r\n2                         MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                                  Syllabus\r\n\r\n    interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the [in\r\n    terrogation’s] primary purpose . . . is to enable police assistance to\r\n    meet an ongoing emergency,” but they “are testimonial when the cir\r\n    cumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emer\r\n    gency, and that the [interrogation’s] primary purpose is to establish\r\n    or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecu\r\n    tion.” 547 U. S., at 822. Thus, a recording of a 911 call describing an\r\n    ongoing domestic disturbance was nontestimonial in Davis, where\r\n    the victim’s “elicited statements were necessary to be able to resolve\r\n    [the ongoing] emergency,” and the statements were not formal. Id.,\r\n    at 827. But the statements in Hammon were testimonial, where the\r\n    victim was interviewed after the event in a room separate from her\r\n    husband and “deliberately recounted, in response to police question\r\n    ing” the past events. Id., at 830. Here, the context is a nondomestic\r\n    dispute, with the “ongoing emergency” extending beyond an initial\r\n    victim to a potential threat to the responding police and the public.\r\n    This context requires additional clarification of what Davis meant by\r\n    “the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assis\r\n    tance to meet an ongoing emergency.” Id., at 822. Pp. 5–12.\r\n       (b) To make the “primary purpose” determination, the Court must\r\n    objectively evaluate the circumstances in which the encounter be\r\n    tween the individual and the police occurs and the parties’ state\r\n    ments and actions. Pp. 12–23.\r\n         (1) The primary purpose inquiry is objective. The circumstances\r\n    in which an encounter occurs—e.g., at or near a crime scene versus at\r\n    a police station, during an ongoing emergency or afterwards—are\r\n    clearly matters of objective fact. And the relevant inquiry into the\r\n    parties’ statements and actions is not the subjective or actual purpose\r\n    of the particular parties, but the purpose that reasonable partici\r\n    pants would have had, as ascertained from the parties’ statements\r\n    and actions and the circumstances in which the encounter occurred.\r\n    P. 13.\r\n         (2) The existence of an “ongoing emergency” at the time of the\r\n    encounter is among the most important circumstances informing the\r\n    interrogation’s “primary purpose.” See, e.g., Davis, 547 U. S., at 828–\r\n    830. An emergency focuses the participants not on “prov[ing] past\r\n    events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution,” id., at 822,\r\n    but on “end[ing] a threatening situation,” id., at 832. The Michigan\r\n    Supreme Court failed to appreciate that whether an emergency exists\r\n    and is ongoing is a highly context-dependent inquiry. An assessment\r\n    of whether an emergency threatening the police and public is ongoing\r\n    cannot narrowly focus on whether the threat to the first victim has\r\n    been neutralized because the threat to the first responders and public\r\n    may continue. The State Supreme Court also did not appreciate that\r\n                   Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\r\n\r\n                              Syllabus\r\n\r\nan emergency’s duration and scope may depend in part on the type of\r\nweapon involved; the court below relied on Davis and Hammon,\r\nwhere the assailants used their fists, as controlling the scope of an\r\nemergency involving a gun. A victim’s medical condition is important\r\nto the primary purpose inquiry to the extent that it sheds light on the\r\nvictim’s ability to have any purpose at all in responding to police\r\nquestions and on the likelihood that any such purpose would be a tes\r\ntimonial one. It also provides important context for first responders\r\nto judge the existence and magnitude of a continuing threat to the\r\nvictim, themselves, and the public. This does not mean that an\r\nemergency lasts the entire time that a perpetrator is on the loose, but\r\ntrial courts can determine in the first instance when an interrogation\r\ntransitions from nontestimonial to testimonial. Finally, whether an\r\nongoing emergency exists is simply one factor informing the ultimate\r\ninquiry regarding an interrogation’s “primary purpose.” Another is\r\nthe encounter’s informality. Formality suggests the absence of an\r\nemergency, but informality does not necessarily indicate the presence\r\nof an emergency or the lack of testimonial intent. The facts here—\r\nthe questioning occurred in an exposed, public area, before emer\r\ngency medical services arrived, and in a disorganized fashion—\r\ndistinguish this case from Crawford’s formal station-house interroga\r\ntion. Pp. 14–20.\r\n      (3) The statements and actions of both the declarant and interro\r\ngators also provide objective evidence of the interrogation’s primary\r\npurpose. Looking to the contents of both the questions and the an\r\nswers ameliorates problems that could arise from looking solely to\r\none participant, since both interrogators and declarants may have\r\nmixed motives. Police officers’ dual responsibilities as both first re\r\nsponders and criminal investigators may lead them to act with differ\r\nent motives simultaneously or in quick succession. And during an\r\nongoing emergency, victims may want the threat to end, but may not\r\nenvision prosecution. Alternatively, a severely injured victim may\r\nhave no purpose at all in answering questions. Taking into account\r\nsuch injuries does not make the inquiry subjective. The inquiry still\r\nfocuses on the understanding and purpose of a reasonable victim in\r\nthe actual victim’s circumstances, which prominently include the vic\r\ntim’s physical state. Objectively ascertaining the primary purpose of\r\nthe interrogation by examining the statements and actions of all par\r\nticipants is also consistent with this Court’s prior holdings. E.g.,\r\nDavis, 547 U. S., at 822–823, n. 1. Pp. 20–23.\r\n   (c) Here, the circumstances of the encounter as well as the state\r\nments and actions of Covington and the police objectively indicate\r\nthat the interrogation’s “primary purpose” was “to enable police as\r\nsistance to meet an ongoing emergency,” 547 U. S., at 822. The cir\r\n4                        MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                                 Syllabus\r\n\r\n    cumstances of the interrogation involved an armed shooter, whose\r\n    motive for and location after the shooting were unknown and who\r\n    had mortally wounded Covington within a few blocks and a few min\r\n    utes of the location where police found Covington. Unlike the emer\r\n    gencies in Davis and Hammon, this dispute’s potential scope and\r\n    thus the emergency encompassed a potential threat to the police and\r\n    the public. And since this case involved a gun, the physical separa\r\n    tion that was sufficient to end the emergency in Hammon was not\r\n    necessarily sufficient to end the threat here. Informed by the circum\r\n    stances of the ongoing emergency, the Court now turns to determin\r\n    ing the “primary purpose of the interrogation” as evidenced by the\r\n    statements and actions of Covington and the police. The circum\r\n    stances of the encounter provide important context for understanding\r\n    Covington’s statements to the police. When he responded to their\r\n    questions, he was lying in a gas station parking lot bleeding from a\r\n    mortal gunshot wound, and his answers were punctuated with ques\r\n    tions about when emergency medical services would arrive. Thus,\r\n    this Court cannot say that a person in his situation would have had a\r\n    “primary purpose” “to establish or prove past events potentially rele\r\n    vant to later criminal prosecution.” Ibid. For their part, the police\r\n    responded to a call that a man had been shot. They did not know\r\n    why, where, or when the shooting had occurred; the shooter’s loca\r\n    tion; or anything else about the crime. They asked exactly the type of\r\n    questions necessary to enable them “to meet an ongoing emergency.”\r\n    Ibid. Nothing in Covington’s responses indicated to the police that\r\n    there was no emergency or that the emergency had ended. Finally,\r\n    this situation is more similar to the informal, harried 911 call in\r\n    Davis than to the structured, station-house interview in Crawford.\r\n    The officers all arrived at different times; asked, upon arrival, what\r\n    had happened; and generally did not conduct a structured interroga\r\n    tion. The informality suggests that their primary purpose was to ad\r\n    dress what they considered to be an ongoing emergency, and the cir\r\n    cumstances lacked a formality that would have alerted Covington to\r\n    or focused him on the possible future prosecutorial use of his state\r\n    ments.

W. 2d 65, 67–68 (2009). On appeal, the Supreme Court\r\nof Michigan held that the Sixth Amendment’s Confronta\r\ntion Clause, as explained in our decisions in Crawford v.\r\nWashington, 541 U. S. 36 (2004), and Davis v. Washington,\r\n547 U. S. 813 (2006), rendered Covington’s statements\r\ninadmissible testimonial hearsay, and the court reversed\r\nBryant’s conviction. 483 Mich., at 157, 768 N. W. 2d, at\r\n79. We granted the State’s petition for a writ of certiorari\r\nto consider whether the Confrontation Clause barred the\r\nadmission at trial of Covington’s statements to the police.\r\nWe hold that the circumstances of the interaction between\r\nCovington and the police objectively indicate that the\r\n“primary purpose of the interrogation” was “to enable\r\npolice assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.” Davis,\r\n547 U. S., at 822. Therefore, Covington’s identification\r\n2                  MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nand description of the shooter and the location of the\r\nshooting were not testimonial statements, and their ad\r\nmission at Bryant’s trial did not violate the Confrontation\r\nClause. We vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of\r\nMichigan and remand.\r\n                              I\r\n  Around 3:25 a.m. on April 29, 2001, Detroit, Michigan\r\npolice officers responded to a radio dispatch indicating\r\nthat a man had been shot. At the scene, they found the\r\nvictim, Anthony Covington, lying on the ground next to his\r\ncar in a gas station parking lot. Covington had a gunshot\r\nwound to his abdomen, appeared to be in great pain, and\r\nspoke with difficulty.\r\n  The police asked him “what had happened, who had\r\nshot him, and where the shooting had occurred.” 483\r\nMich., at 143, 768 N. W. 2d, at 71. Covington stated that\r\n“Rick” shot him at around 3 a.m. Id., at 136, and n. 1, 768\r\nN. W. 2d, at 67, and n. 1. He also indicated that he had a\r\nconversation with Bryant, whom he recognized based on\r\nhis voice, through the back door of Bryant’s house. Cov\r\nington explained that when he turned to leave, he was\r\nshot through the door and then drove to the gas station,\r\nwhere police found him.\r\n  Covington’s conversation with the police ended within 5\r\nto 10 minutes when emergency medical services arrived.\r\nCovington was transported to a hospital and died within\r\nhours. The police left the gas station after speaking with\r\nCovington, called for backup, and traveled to Bryant’s\r\nhouse. They did not find Bryant there but did find blood\r\nand a bullet on the back porch and an apparent bullet hole\r\nin the back door. Police also found Covington’s wallet and\r\nidentification outside the house.\r\n  At trial, which occurred prior to our decisions in Craw\r\nford, 541 U. S. 36, and Davis, 547 U. S. 813, the police\r\nofficers who spoke with Covington at the gas station testi\r\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

The jury re\r\nturned a guilty verdict on charges of second-degree\r\nmurder, being a felon in possession of a firearm, and pos\r\nsession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.\r\n   Bryant appealed, and the Michigan Court of Appeals\r\naffirmed his conviction.

Bryant then appealed to the\r\nSupreme Court of Michigan, arguing that the trial court\r\nerred in admitting Covington’s statements to the police.\r\nThe Supreme Court of Michigan eventually remanded the\r\ncase to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of\r\nour 2006 decision in Davis. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">902</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 722 N.

W. 2d 65.\r\n   Before the Supreme Court of Michigan, Bryant argued\r\nthat Covington’s statements to the police were testimonial\r\nunder Crawford and Davis and were therefore inadmissi\r\nble. The State, on the other hand, argued that the state\r\nments were admissible as “excited utterances” under the\r\nMichigan Rules of Evidence. 483 Mich., at 142, and n. 6,\r\n768 N. W. 2d, at 70, and n. 6. There was no dispute that\r\nCovington was unavailable at trial and Bryant had no\r\nprior opportunity to cross-examine him. The court there\r\nfore assessed whether Covington’s statements to the police\r\nidentifying and describing the shooter and the time and\r\nlocation of the shooting were testimonial hearsay for\r\npurposes of the Confrontation Clause. The court con\r\ncluded that the circumstances “clearly indicate that the\r\n‘primary purpose’ of the questioning was to establish the\r\nfacts of an event that had already occurred; the ‘primary\r\npurpose’ was not to enable police assistance to meet an\r\nongoing emergency.” Id., at 143, 768 N. W. 2d, at 71. The\r\n4                      MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ncourt explained that, in its view, Covington was describing\r\npast events and as such, his “primary purpose in making\r\nthese statements to the police . . . was . . . to tell the police\r\nwho had committed the crime against him, where the\r\ncrime had been committed, and where the police could find\r\nthe criminal.” Id., at 144, 768 N. W. 2d, at 71. Noting\r\nthat the officers’ actions did not suggest that they per\r\nceived an ongoing emergency at the gas station, the court\r\nheld that there was in fact no ongoing emergency. Id., at\r\n145–147, 768 N. W. 2d, at 71–73. The court distinguished\r\nthe facts of this case from those in Davis, where we held a\r\ndeclarant’s statements in a 911 call to be nontestimonial.\r\nIt instead analogized this case to Hammon v. Indiana,\r\nwhich we decided jointly with Davis and in which we\r\nfound testimonial a declarant’s statements to police just\r\nafter an assault. See 547 U. S., at 829–832. Based on this\r\nanalysis, the Supreme Court of Michigan held that the\r\nadmission of Covington’s statements constituted prejudi\r\ncial plain error warranting reversal and ordered a new\r\ntrial. 483 Mich., at 151–153, 768 N. W. 2d, at 75–76. The\r\ncourt did not address whether, absent a Confrontation\r\nClause bar, the statements’ admission would have been\r\notherwise consistent with Michigan’s hearsay rules or due\r\nprocess.1\r\n——————\r\n  1 The Supreme Court of Michigan held that the question whether the\r\n\r\nvictim’s statements would have been admissible as “dying declarations”\r\nwas not properly before it because at the preliminary examination, the\r\nprosecution, after first invoking both the dying declaration and excited\r\nutterance hearsay exceptions, established the factual foundation only\r\nfor admission of the statements as excited utterances. The trial court\r\nruled that the statements were admissible as excited utterances and\r\ndid not address their admissibility as dying declarations. 483 Mich., at\r\n153–154, 768 N. W. 2d, at 76–77. This occurred prior to our 2004\r\ndecision in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, where we first\r\nsuggested that dying declarations, even if testimonial, might be admis\r\nsible as a historical exception to the Confrontation Clause. Id., at 56,\r\nn. 6; see also Giles v. California, 554 U. S. 353, 358–359 (2008). We\r\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

Justice Corrigan concluded that the\r\nobjective circumstances of Covington’s interaction with\r\npolice rendered this case more similar to the nontestimo\r\nnial statements in Davis than to the testimonial state\r\nments in Crawford. 483 Mich., at 164, 768 N.

Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S.\r\n400, 403 (1965). In Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56, 66\r\n(1980), we explained that the confrontation right does not\r\nbar admission of statements of an unavailable witness if\r\nthe statements “bea[r] adequate ‘indicia of reliability.’ ”\r\n\r\n——————\r\nnoted in Crawford that we “need not decide in this case whether the\r\nSixth Amendment incorporates an exception for testimonial dying\r\ndeclarations.” 541 U. S., at 56, n. 6. Because of the State’s failure to\r\npreserve its argument with regard to dying declarations, we similarly\r\nneed not decide that question here. See also post, p. __ (GINSBURG, J.,\r\ndissenting).\r\n6                   MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nWe held that reliability can be established if “the evidence\r\nfalls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception,” or if it does\r\nnot fall within such an exception, then if it bears “particu\r\nlarized guarantees of trustworthiness.” Ibid.\r\n   Nearly a quarter century later, we decided Crawford v.\r\nWashington, 541 U. S. 36. Petitioner Michael Crawford\r\nwas prosecuted for stabbing a man who had allegedly\r\nattempted to rape his wife, Sylvia. Sylvia witnessed the\r\nstabbing, and later that night, after she and her husband\r\nwere both arrested, police interrogated her about the\r\nincident. At trial, Sylvia Crawford claimed spousal privi\r\nlege and did not testify, but the State introduced a tape\r\nrecording of Sylvia’s statement to the police in an effort to\r\nprove that the stabbing was not in self-defense, as Michael\r\nCrawford claimed. The Washington Supreme Court af\r\nfirmed Crawford’s conviction because it found Sylvia’s\r\nstatement to be reliable, as required under Ohio v. Rob\r\nerts. We reversed, overruling Ohio v. Roberts. 541 U. S.,\r\nat 60–68; see also Davis, 547 U. S., at 825, n. 4.\r\n   Crawford examined the common-law history of the\r\nconfrontation right and explained that “the principal evil\r\nat which the Confrontation Clause was directed was the\r\ncivil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its\r\nuse of ex parte examinations as evidence against the ac\r\ncused.” 541 U. S., at 50. We noted that in England, pre\r\ntrial examinations of suspects and witnesses by govern\r\nment officials “were sometimes read in court in lieu of live\r\ntestimony.” Id., at 43. In light of this history, we empha\r\nsized the word “witnesses” in the Sixth Amendment, defin\r\ning it as “those who ‘bear testimony.’ ” Id., at 51 (quoting\r\n2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English\r\nLanguage (1828)). We defined “testimony” as “ ‘ [a] solemn\r\ndeclaration or affirmation made for the purpose of estab\r\nlishing or proving some fact.’ ” 541 U. S., at 51 (quoting\r\nWebster). We noted that “[a]n accuser who makes a for\r\nmal statement to government officers bears testimony in a\r\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           7\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nsense that a person who makes a casual remark to an\r\nacquaintance does not.” Ibid. We therefore limited the\r\nConfrontation Clause’s reach to testimonial statements\r\nand held that in order for testimonial evidence to be ad\r\nmissible, the Sixth Amendment “demands what the com\r\nmon law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity\r\nfor cross-examination.” Id., at 68. Although “leav[ing] for\r\nanother day any effort to spell out a comprehensive defini\r\ntion of ‘testimonial,’ ” Crawford noted that “at a minimum”\r\nit includes “prior testimony at a preliminary hearing,\r\nbefore a grand jury, or at a former trial; and . . . police\r\ninterrogations.” Ibid. Under this reasoning, we held that\r\nSylvia Crawford’s statements in the course of police ques\r\ntioning were testimonial and that their admission when\r\nMichael Crawford “had no opportunity to cross-examine\r\nher” due to spousal privilege was “sufficient to make out a\r\nviolation of the Sixth Amendment.” Ibid.\r\n   In 2006, the Court in Davis v. Washington and Hammon\r\nv. Indiana, 547 U. S. 813, took a further step to “deter\r\nmine more precisely which police interrogations produce\r\ntestimony” and therefore implicate a Confrontation Clause\r\nbar. Id., at 822. We explained that when Crawford said\r\nthat\r\n    “ ‘interrogations by law enforcement officers fall\r\n    squarely within [the] class’ of testimonial hearsay, we\r\n    had immediately in mind (for that was the case before\r\n    us) interrogations solely directed at establishing the\r\n    facts of a past crime, in order to identify (or provide\r\n    evidence to convict) the perpetrator. The product of\r\n    such interrogation, whether reduced to a writing\r\n    signed by the declarant or embedded in the memory\r\n    (and perhaps notes) of the interrogating officer, is tes\r\n    timonial.” Davis, 547 U. S., at 826.\r\nWe thus made clear in Davis that not all those questioned\r\nby the police are witnesses and not all “interrogations by\r\n8                       MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nlaw enforcement officers,” Crawford, 541 U. S., at 53, are\r\nsubject to the Confrontation Clause.2\r\n  Davis and Hammon were both domestic violence cases.\r\nIn Davis, Michelle McCottry made the statements at issue\r\nto a 911 operator during a domestic disturbance with\r\nAdrian Davis, her former boyfriend. McCottry told the\r\noperator, “ ‘He’s here jumpin’ on me again,’ ” and, “ ‘He’s\r\nusin’ his fists.’ ” 547 U. S., at 817. The operator then\r\nasked McCottry for Davis’ first and last names and middle\r\ninitial, and at that point in the conversation McCottry\r\nreported that Davis had fled in a car. Id., at 818.\r\nMcCottry did not appear at Davis’ trial, and the State\r\nintroduced the recording of her conversation with the 911\r\noperator. Id., at 819.\r\n  In Hammon, decided along with Davis, police responded\r\nto a domestic disturbance call at the home of Amy and\r\nHershel Hammon, where they found Amy alone on the\r\nfront porch. Ibid. She appeared “ ‘somewhat frightened,’ ”\r\nbut told them “ ‘nothing was the matter.’ ” Ibid. (quoting\r\nHammon v. State, 829 N. E. 2d 444, 446–447 (Ind. 2005)).\r\nShe gave the police permission to enter the house, where\r\nthey saw a gas heating unit with the glass front shattered\r\non the floor. One officer remained in the kitchen with\r\nHershel, while another officer talked to Amy in the living\r\nroom about what had happened. Hershel tried several\r\ntimes to participate in Amy’s conversation with the police\r\nand became angry when the police required him to stay\r\nseparated from Amy. 547 U. S., at 819–820. The police\r\nasked Amy to fill out and sign a battery affidavit. She\r\nwrote: “ ‘Broke our Furnace & shoved me down on the floor\r\n——————\r\n   2 We noted in Crawford that “[w]e use the term ‘interrogation’ in its\r\n\r\ncolloquial, rather than any technical legal, sense,” and that “[j]ust as\r\nvarious definitions of ‘testimonial’ exist, one can imagine various\r\ndefinitions of ‘interrogation,’ and we need not select among them in this\r\ncase.” 541 U. S., at 53, n. 4. Davis did not abandon those qualifica\r\ntions; nor do we do so here.\r\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

Tore up my van where I\r\ncouldn’t leave the house. Attacked my daughter.’ ” Id., at\r\n820. Amy did not appear at Hershel’s trial, so the police\r\nofficers who spoke with her testified as to her statements\r\nand authenticated the affidavit. Ibid. The trial court\r\nadmitted the affidavit as a present sense impression and\r\nadmitted the oral statements as excited utterances under\r\nstate hearsay rules. Ibid. The Indiana Supreme Court\r\naffirmed Hammon’s conviction, holding that Amy’s oral\r\nstatements were not testimonial and that the admission of\r\nthe affidavit, although erroneous because the affidavit was\r\ntestimonial, was harmless. Hammon v. State, 829 N. E.\r\n2d, at 458–459.\r\n  To address the facts of both cases, we expanded upon\r\nthe meaning of “testimonial” that we first employed in\r\nCrawford and discussed the concept of an ongoing emer\r\ngency. We explained:\r\n    “Statements are nontestimonial when made in the\r\n    course of police interrogation under circumstances ob\r\n    jectively indicating that the primary purpose of the\r\n    interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an\r\n    ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the\r\n    circumstances objectively indicate that there is no\r\n    such ongoing emergency, and that the primary pur\r\n    pose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past\r\n    events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecu\r\n    tion.” Davis, 547 U. S., at 822.\r\nExamining the Davis and Hammon statements in light of\r\nthose definitions, we held that the statements at issue\r\nin Davis were nontestimonial and the statements in\r\nHammon were testimonial. We distinguished the state\r\nments in Davis from the testimonial statements in Craw\r\nford on several grounds, including that the victim in Davis\r\nwas “speaking about events as they were actually happen\r\n10                       MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                           Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ning, rather than ‘describ[ing] past events,’ ” that there was\r\nan ongoing emergency, that the “elicited statements were\r\nnecessary to be able to resolve the present emergency,”\r\nand that the statements were not formal. 547 U. S., at\r\n827. In Hammon, on the other hand, we held that, “[i]t is\r\nentirely clear from the circumstances that the interroga\r\ntion was part of an investigation into possibly criminal\r\npast conduct.” Id., at 829. There was “no emergency in\r\nprogress.” Ibid. The officer questioning Amy “was not\r\nseeking to determine . . . ‘what is happening,’ but rather\r\n‘what happened.’ ” Id., at 830. It was “formal enough”\r\nthat the police interrogated Amy in a room separate from\r\nher husband where, “some time after the events described\r\nwere over,” she “deliberately recounted, in response to\r\npolice questioning, how potentially criminal past events\r\nbegan and progressed.” Ibid. Because her statements\r\n“were neither a cry for help nor the provision of informa\r\ntion enabling officers immediately to end a threatening\r\nsituation,” id., at 832, we held that they were testimonial.\r\n   Davis did not “attemp[t] to produce an exhaustive classi\r\nfication of all conceivable statements—or even all conceiv\r\nable statements in response to police interrogation—as\r\neither testimonial or nontestimonial.” Id., at 822.3 The\r\n——————\r\n  3 Davis  explained that 911 operators “may at least be agents of\r\nlaw enforcement when they conduct interrogations of 911 callers,” and\r\ntherefore “consider[ed] their acts to be acts of the police” for purposes of\r\nthe opinion. 547 U. S., at 823, n. 2. Davis explicitly reserved the\r\nquestion of “whether and when statements made to someone other than\r\nlaw enforcement personnel are ‘testimonial.’ ” Ibid. We have no need to\r\ndecide that question in this case either because Covington’s statements\r\nwere made to police officers. The dissent also claims to reserve this\r\nquestion, see post, at 3, n. 1 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), but supports one of\r\nits arguments by relying on King v. Brasier, 1 Leach 199, 200, 168 Eng.\r\nRep. 202, 202–203 (K. B. 1779), which involved statements made by a\r\nchild to her mother—a private citizen—just after the child had been\r\nsexually assaulted. See also Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 69–\r\n70 (2004) (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment) (citing King v.\r\n                      Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                     11\r\n\r\n                           Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nbasic purpose of the Confrontation Clause was to “targe[t]”\r\nthe sort of “abuses” exemplified at the notorious treason\r\ntrial of Sir Walter Raleigh. Crawford, 541 U. S., at 51.\r\nThus, the most important instances in which the Clause\r\nrestricts the introduction of out-of-court statements are\r\nthose in which state actors are involved in a formal, out-of\r\ncourt interrogation of a witness to obtain evidence for\r\ntrial.4 See id., at 43–44. Even where such an interroga\r\ntion is conducted with all good faith, introduction of the\r\nresulting statements at trial can be unfair to the accused\r\nif they are untested by cross-examination. Whether for\r\nmal or informal, out-of-court statements can evade the\r\nbasic objective of the Confrontation Clause, which is to\r\nprevent the accused from being deprived of the opportu\r\nnity to cross-examine the declarant about statements\r\ntaken for use at trial. When, as in Davis, the primary\r\npurpose of an interrogation is to respond to an “ongoing\r\nemergency,” its purpose is not to create a record for trial\r\nand thus is not within the scope of the Clause. But there\r\nmay be other circumstances, aside from ongoing emergen\r\ncies, when a statement is not procured with a primary\r\npurpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for trial\r\ntestimony. In making the primary purpose determination,\r\nstandard rules of hearsay, designed to identify some state\r\n——————\r\nBrasier for the different proposition that “out-of-court statements made\r\nby someone other than the accused and not taken under oath, unlike ex\r\nparte depositions or affidavits, were generally not considered substan\r\ntive evidence upon which a conviction could be based”).\r\n   4 Contrary to the dissent’s excited suggestion, nothing in this opinion\r\n\r\ncasts “favorable light,” post, at 11 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), on the conduct\r\nof Sir Walter Raleigh’s trial or other 16th- and 17th-century English\r\ntreason trials. The dissent is correct that such trials are “unquestiona\r\nbly infamous,” ibid., and our decision here confirms, rather than un\r\ndermines, that assessment. See also n. 17, infra. For all of the\r\nreasons discussed in JUSTICE THOMAS’ opinion concurring in the judg\r\nment, the situation presented in this case is nothing like the circum\r\nstances presented by Sir Walter Raleigh’s trial. See post, p. __.\r\n12                      MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nments as reliable, will be relevant. Where no such pri\r\nmary purpose exists, the admissibility of a statement is\r\nthe concern of state and federal rules of evidence, not the\r\nConfrontation Clause.5\r\n  Deciding this case also requires further explanation of\r\nthe “ongoing emergency” circumstance addressed in Davis.\r\nBecause Davis and Hammon arose in the domestic vio\r\nlence context, that was the situation “we had immediately\r\nin mind (for that was the case before us).” 547 U. S., at\r\n826. We now face a new context: a nondomestic dispute,\r\ninvolving a victim found in a public location, suffering\r\nfrom a fatal gunshot wound, and a perpetrator whose\r\nlocation was unknown at the time the police located the\r\nvictim. Thus, we confront for the first time circumstances\r\nin which the “ongoing emergency” discussed in Davis\r\nextends beyond an initial victim to a potential threat to\r\nthe responding police and the public at large. This new\r\ncontext requires us to provide additional clarification with\r\nregard to what Davis meant by “the primary purpose of\r\nthe interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an\r\nongoing emergency.” Id., at 822.\r\n                           III\r\n   To determine whether the “primary purpose” of an\r\ninterrogation is “to enable police assistance to meet an\r\nongoing emergency,” Davis, 547 U. S., at 822, which would\r\nrender the resulting statements nontestimonial, we objec\r\ntively evaluate the circumstances in which the encounter\r\noccurs and the statements and actions of the parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n——————\r\n   5 See Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 823–824 (2006) (explaining\r\n\r\nthe question before the Court as “whether the Confrontation Clause\r\napplies only to testimonial hearsay” and answering in the affirmative\r\nbecause “[a] limitation so clearly reflected in the text of the constitu\r\ntional provision must fairly be said to mark out not merely its ‘core,’ but\r\nits perimeter”).

W. 2d,\r\nat 70. Davis uses the word “objective” or “objectively” no\r\nfewer than eight times in describing the relevant inquiry.\r\nSee 547 U. S., at 822, 826–828, 830–831, and n. 5; see, e.g.,\r\nid., at 826 (“The question before us in Davis, then, is\r\nwhether, objectively considered, the interrogation that\r\ntook place in the course of the 911 call produced testimo\r\nnial statements”). “Objectively” also appears in the defini\r\ntions of both testimonial and nontestimonial statements\r\nthat Davis established. Id., at 822.\r\n   An objective analysis of the circumstances of an encoun\r\nter and the statements and actions of the parties to it\r\nprovides the most accurate assessment of the “primary\r\npurpose of the interrogation.” The circumstances in which\r\nan encounter occurs—e.g., at or near the scene of the crime\r\nversus at a police station, during an ongoing emergency\r\nor afterwards—are clearly matters of objective fact. The\r\nstatements and actions of the parties must also be objec\r\ntively evaluated. That is, the relevant inquiry is not the\r\nsubjective or actual purpose of the individuals involved in\r\na particular encounter, but rather the purpose that rea\r\nsonable participants would have had, as ascertained from\r\nthe individuals’ statements and actions and the circum\r\nstances in which the encounter occurred.7\r\n——————\r\n  6 Bryant suggests that Michigan is arguing for “a subjective analysis\r\nof the intent of the interrogator’s questioning.” Brief for Respondent\r\n12. We do not read Michigan’s brief to be arguing for a subjective\r\ninquiry, and any such argument would be in error. We do not under\r\nstand the dissent to disagree that the inquiry is objective.\r\n  7 This approach is consistent with our rejection of subjective inquiries\r\n\r\nin other areas of criminal law. See, e.g., Whren v. United States, 517\r\nU. S. 806, 813 (1996) (refusing to evaluate Fourth Amendment reason\r\nableness subjectively in light of the officers’ actual motivations); New\r\nYork v.

BRYANT\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n                              B\r\n   As our recent Confrontation Clause cases have ex\r\nplained, the existence of an “ongoing emergency” at the\r\ntime of an encounter between an individual and the police\r\nis among the most important circumstances informing the\r\n“primary purpose” of an interrogation. See Davis, 547\r\nU. S., at 828–830; Crawford, 541 U. S., at 65. The exis\r\ntence of an ongoing emergency is relevant to determining\r\nthe primary purpose of the interrogation because an\r\nemergency focuses the participants on something other\r\nthan “prov[ing] past events potentially relevant to later\r\ncriminal prosecution.”8 Davis, 547 U. S., at 822. Rather,\r\nit focuses them on “end[ing] a threatening situation.” Id.,\r\nat 832. Implicit in Davis is the idea that because the\r\nprospect of fabrication in statements given for the primary\r\npurpose of resolving that emergency is presumably signifi\r\ncantly diminished, the Confrontation Clause does not\r\nrequire such statements to be subject to the crucible of\r\ncross-examination.\r\n   This logic is not unlike that justifying the excited utter\r\nance exception in hearsay law. Statements “relating to a\r\nstartling event or condition made while the declarant was\r\nunder the stress of excitement caused by the event or\r\n—————— \r\n\r\napplicability of the public safety exception to Miranda v.

S. 291, 301–302 (1980)\r\n(holding that a police officer’s subjective intent to obtain incriminatory\r\nstatements is not relevant to determining whether an interrogation has\r\noccurred).\r\n  8 The existence of an ongoing emergency must be objectively assessed\r\n\r\nfrom the perspective of the parties to the interrogation at the time, not\r\nwith the benefit of hindsight. If the information the parties knew at\r\nthe time of the encounter would lead a reasonable person to believe\r\nthat there was an emergency, even if that belief was later proved\r\nincorrect, that is sufficient for purposes of the Confrontation Clause.\r\nThe emergency is relevant to the “primary purpose of the interrogation”\r\nbecause of the effect it has on the parties’ purpose, not because of its\r\nactual existence.\r\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

BRYANT\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nN. W. 2d, at 71. But in doing so, the court construed Davis\r\nto have decided more than it did and thus employed an\r\nunduly narrow understanding of “ongoing emergency” that\r\nDavis does not require.\r\n  First, the Michigan Supreme Court repeatedly and\r\nincorrectly asserted that Davis “defined” “ ‘ongoing emer\r\ngency.’ ” 483 Mich., at 147, 768 N. W. 2d, at 73; see also\r\nid., at 144, 768 N. W. 2d, at 71–72. In fact, Davis did not\r\neven define the extent of the emergency in that case. The\r\nMichigan Supreme Court erroneously read Davis as decid\r\ning that “the statements made after the defendant stopped\r\nassaulting the victim and left the premises did not occur\r\nduring an ‘ongoing emergency.’ ” 483 Mich., at 150, n. 15,\r\n768 N. W. 2d, at 75, n. 15. We explicitly explained in\r\nDavis, however, that we were asked to review only the\r\ntestimonial nature of Michelle McCottry’s initial state\r\nments during the 911 call; we therefore merely assumed\r\nthe correctness of the Washington Supreme Court’s hold\r\ning that admission of her other statements was harmless,\r\nwithout deciding whether those subsequent statements\r\nwere also made for the primary purpose of resolving an\r\nongoing emergency. 547 U. S., at 829.\r\n  Second, by assuming that Davis defined the outer\r\nbounds of “ongoing emergency,” the Michigan Supreme\r\nCourt failed to appreciate that whether an emergency\r\nexists and is ongoing is a highly context-dependent in\r\nquiry. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20.\r\nDavis and Hammon involved domestic violence, a known\r\nand identified perpetrator, and, in Hammon, a neutralized\r\nthreat. Because Davis and Hammon were domestic vio\r\nlence cases, we focused only on the threat to the victims\r\nand assessed the ongoing emergency from the perspective\r\nof whether there was a continuing threat to them. 547\r\nU. S., at 827, 829–830.\r\n  Domestic violence cases like Davis and Hammon often\r\nhave a narrower zone of potential victims than cases\r\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          17\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ninvolving threats to public safety. An assessment of\r\nwhether an emergency that threatens the police and pub\r\nlic is ongoing cannot narrowly focus on whether the threat\r\nsolely to the first victim has been neutralized because the\r\nthreat to the first responders and public may continue.\r\nSee 483 Mich., at 164, 768 N. W. 2d, at 82 (Corrigan, J.,\r\ndissenting) (examining the threat to the victim, police, and\r\nthe public); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19–\r\n20 (“An emergency posed by an unknown shooter who\r\nremains at large does not automatically abate just because\r\nthe police can provide security to his first victim”).\r\n   The Michigan Supreme Court also did not appreciate\r\nthat the duration and scope of an emergency may depend\r\nin part on the type of weapon employed. The court relied\r\non Davis and Hammon, in which the assailants used their\r\nfists, as controlling the scope of the emergency here, which\r\ninvolved the use of a gun. The problem with that reason\r\ning is clear when considered in light of the assault on Amy\r\nHammon. Hershel Hammon was armed only with his fists\r\nwhen he attacked his wife, so removing Amy to a separate\r\nroom was sufficient to end the emergency. 547 U. S., at\r\n830–832. If Hershel had been reported to be armed with a\r\ngun, however, separation by a single household wall might\r\nnot have been sufficient to end the emergency. Id., at 819.\r\n   The Michigan Supreme Court’s failure to focus on the\r\ncontext-dependent nature of our Davis decision also led it\r\nto conclude that the medical condition of a declarant is\r\nirrelevant. 483 Mich., at 149, 768 N. W. 2d, at 74 (“The\r\nCourt said nothing at all that would remotely suggest that\r\nwhether the victim was in need of medical attention was\r\nin any way relevant to whether there was an ‘ongoing\r\nemergency’ ”). But Davis and Hammon did not present\r\nmedical emergencies, despite some injuries to the victims.\r\n547 U. S., at 818, 820. Thus, we have not previously\r\nconsidered, much less ruled out, the relevance of a victim’s\r\nsevere injuries to the primary purpose inquiry.\r\n18                     MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                        Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   Taking into account the victim’s medical state does not,\r\nas the Michigan Supreme Court below thought, “rende[r]\r\nnon-testimonial” “all statements made while the police are\r\nquestioning a seriously injured complainant.” 483 Mich.,\r\nat 149, 768 N. W. 2d, at 74. The medical condition of the\r\nvictim is important to the primary purpose inquiry to the\r\nextent that it sheds light on the ability of the victim to\r\nhave any purpose at all in responding to police questions\r\nand on the likelihood that any purpose formed would\r\nnecessarily be a testimonial one. The victim’s medical\r\nstate also provides important context for first responders\r\nto judge the existence and magnitude of a continuing\r\nthreat to the victim, themselves, and the public.\r\n   As the Solicitor General’s brief observes, Brief for\r\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 20, and contrary to the\r\nMichigan Supreme Court’s claims, 483 Mich., at 147, 768\r\nN. W. 2d, at 73, none of this suggests that an emergency is\r\nongoing in every place or even just surrounding the victim\r\nfor the entire time that the perpetrator of a violent crime\r\nis on the loose. As we recognized in Davis, “a conversation\r\nwhich begins as an interrogation to determine the need for\r\nemergency assistance” can “evolve into testimonial state\r\nments.” 547 U. S., at 828 (internal quotation marks omit\r\nted). This evolution may occur if, for example, a declarant\r\nprovides police with information that makes clear that\r\nwhat appeared to be an emergency is not or is no longer an\r\nemergency or that what appeared to be a public threat is\r\nactually a private dispute. It could also occur if a perpe\r\ntrator is disarmed, surrenders, is apprehended, or, as in\r\nDavis, flees with little prospect of posing a threat to the\r\npublic. Trial courts can determine in the first instance\r\nwhen any transition from nontestimonial to testimonial\r\noccurs,10 and exclude “the portions of any statement that\r\n——————\r\n  10 Recognizing the evolutionary potential of a situation in criminal\r\n\r\nlaw is not unique to the Confrontation Clause context. We noted in\r\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    19\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nhave become testimonial, as they do, for example, with\r\nunduly prejudicial portions of otherwise admissible evi\r\ndence.” Id., at 829.\r\n   Finally, our discussion of the Michigan Supreme Court’s\r\nmisunderstanding of what Davis meant by “ongoing emer\r\ngency” should not be taken to imply that the existence vel\r\nnon of an ongoing emergency is dispositive of the testimo\r\nnial inquiry. As Davis made clear, whether an ongoing\r\nemergency exists is simply one factor—albeit an important\r\nfactor—that informs the ultimate inquiry regarding the\r\n“primary purpose” of an interrogation. Another factor the\r\nMichigan Supreme Court did not sufficiently account for is\r\nthe importance of informality in an encounter between a\r\nvictim and police. Formality is not the sole touchstone of\r\nour primary purpose inquiry because, although formality\r\nsuggests the absence of an emergency and therefore an\r\nincreased likelihood that the purpose of the interrogation\r\nis to “establish or prove past events potentially relevant to\r\nlater criminal prosecution,” id., at 822, informality does\r\nnot necessarily indicate the presence of an emergency or\r\nthe lack of testimonial intent. Cf. id., at 826 (explaining\r\nthat Confrontation Clause requirements cannot “readily\r\nbe evaded” by the parties deliberately keeping the written\r\nproduct of an interrogation informal “instead of having the\r\ndeclarant sign a deposition”). The court below, however,\r\ntoo readily dismissed the informality of the circumstances\r\nin this case in a single brief footnote and in fact seems to\r\nhave suggested that the encounter in this case was formal.\r\n483 Mich., at 150, n. 16, 768 N. W. 2d, at 75, n. 16. As we\r\n——————\r\nDavis that “[j]ust as, for Fifth Amendment purposes, ‘police officers can\r\nand will distinguish almost instinctively between questions necessary\r\nto secure their own safety or the safety of the public and questions\r\ndesigned solely to elicit testimonial evidence from a suspect, . . . trial\r\ncourts will recognize the point at which, for Sixth Amendment pur\r\nposes, statements in response to interrogations become testimonial.”\r\n547 U. S., at 829 (quoting New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S., at 658–659).\r\n20                      MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nexplain further below, the questioning in this case oc\r\ncurred in an exposed, public area, prior to the arrival of\r\nemergency medical services, and in a disorganized fashion.\r\nAll of those facts make this case distinguishable from\r\nthe formal station-house interrogation in Crawford. See\r\nDavis, 547 U. S., at 827.\r\n                              C\r\n  In addition to the circumstances in which an encounter\r\noccurs, the statements and actions of both the declarant\r\nand interrogators provide objective evidence of the pri\r\nmary purpose of the interrogation. See, e.g., Davis, 547\r\nU. S., at 827 (“[T]he nature of what was asked and an\r\nswered in Davis, again viewed objectively, was such that\r\nthe elicited statements were necessary to be able to resolve\r\nthe present emergency, rather than simply to learn (as in\r\nCrawford) what had happened in the past” (first emphasis\r\nadded)). The Michigan Supreme Court did, at least\r\nbriefly, conduct this inquiry. 483 Mich., at 144–147, 768\r\nN. W. 2d, at 71–73.\r\n  As the Michigan Supreme Court correctly recognized,\r\nid., at 140, n. 5, 768 N. W. 2d, at 69, n. 5, Davis requires a\r\ncombined inquiry that accounts for both the declarant and\r\nthe interrogator.11 In many instances, the primary pur\r\n——————\r\n  11 Some  portions of Davis, however, have caused confusion about\r\nwhether the inquiry prescribes examination of one participant to the\r\nexclusion of the other. Davis’ language indicating that a statement’s\r\ntestimonial or nontestimonial nature derives from “the primary pur\r\npose of the interrogation,” 547 U. S., at 822 (emphasis added), could be\r\nread to suggest that the relevant purpose is that of the interrogator. In\r\ncontrast, footnote 1 in Davis explains, “it is in the final analysis the\r\ndeclarant’s statements, not the interrogator’s questions, that the\r\nConfrontation Clause requires us to evaluate.” Id., at 822–823, n. 1.\r\nBryant draws on the footnote to argue that the primary purpose inquiry\r\nmust be conducted solely from the perspective of the declarant, and\r\nargues against adoption of a purpose-of-the-interrogator perspective.\r\nBrief for Respondent 10–13; see also Brief for Richard D. Friedman as\r\nAmicus Curiae 5–15. But this statement in footnote 1 of Davis merely\r\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                   21\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\npose of the interrogation will be most accurately ascer\r\ntained by looking to the contents of both the questions and\r\nthe answers. To give an extreme example, if the police say\r\nto a victim, “Tell us who did this to you so that we can\r\narrest and prosecute them,” the victim’s response that\r\n“Rick did it,” appears purely accusatory because by virtue\r\nof the phrasing of the question, the victim necessarily has\r\nprosecution in mind when she answers.\r\n  The combined approach also ameliorates problems that\r\ncould arise from looking solely to one participant. Pre\r\ndominant among these is the problem of mixed motives\r\non the part of both interrogators and declarants. Police\r\nofficers in our society function as both first responders and\r\ncriminal investigators. Their dual responsibilities may\r\nmean that they act with different motives simultaneously\r\nor in quick succession. See New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S.\r\n649, 656 (1984) (“Undoubtedly most police officers [decid\r\ning whether to give Miranda warnings in a possible emer\r\ngency situation] would act out of a host of different, in\r\nstinctive, and largely unverifiable motives—their own\r\nsafety, the safety of others, and perhaps as well the desire\r\nto obtain incriminating evidence from the suspect”); see\r\nalso Davis, 547 U. S., at 839 (THOMAS, J., concurring in\r\njudgment in part and dissenting in part) (“In many, if not\r\nmost, cases where police respond to a report of a crime,\r\nwhether pursuant to a 911 call from the victim or other\r\nwise, the purposes of an interrogation, viewed from the\r\nperspective of the police, are both to respond to the emer\r\n——————\r\nacknowledges that the Confrontation Clause is not implicated when\r\nstatements are offered “for purposes other than establishing the truth\r\nof the matter asserted.” Crawford, 541 U. S., at 60, n. 9. An interroga\r\ntor’s questions, unlike a declarant’s answers, do not assert the truth of\r\nany matter. The language in the footnote was not meant to determine\r\nhow the courts are to assess the nature of the declarant’s purpose, but\r\nmerely to remind readers that it is the statements, and not the ques\r\ntions, that must be evaluated under the Sixth Amendment.\r\n22                      MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ngency situation and to gather evidence”).\r\n   Victims are also likely to have mixed motives when they\r\nmake statements to the police. During an ongoing emer\r\ngency, a victim is most likely to want the threat to her and\r\nto other potential victims to end, but that does not neces\r\nsarily mean that the victim wants or envisions prosecution\r\nof the assailant. A victim may want the attacker to be\r\nincapacitated temporarily or rehabilitated. Alternatively,\r\na severely injured victim may have no purpose at all in\r\nanswering questions posed; the answers may be simply\r\nreflexive. The victim’s injuries could be so debilitating\r\nas to prevent her from thinking sufficiently clearly to un\r\nderstand whether her statements are for the purpose of\r\naddressing an ongoing emergency or for the purpose of fu\r\nture prosecution.12 Taking into account a victim’s injuries\r\ndoes not transform this objective inquiry into a subjective\r\none. The inquiry is still objective because it focuses on the\r\nunderstanding and purpose of a reasonable victim in the\r\ncircumstances of the actual victim—circumstances that\r\nprominently include the victim’s physical state.\r\n   The dissent suggests, post, at 3–4 (opinion of SCALIA, J.),\r\nthat we intend to give controlling weight to the “intentions\r\nof the police,” post, at 4. That is a misreading of our opin\r\nion. At trial, the declarant’s statements, not the interro\r\ngator’s questions, will be introduced to “establis[h] the\r\ntruth of the matter asserted,” Crawford, 541 U. S., at 60,\r\nn. 9, and must therefore pass the Sixth Amendment test.\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  12 In such a situation, the severe injuries of the victim would un\r\n\r\ndoubtedly also weigh on the credibility and reliability that the trier of\r\nfact would afford to the statements. Cf. Advisory Committee’s Notes on\r\nFed. Rule Evid. 803(2), 28 U. S. C. App., p. 371 (noting that although\r\nthe “theory” of the excited utterance exception “has been criticized on\r\nthe ground that excitement impairs [the] accuracy of observation as\r\nwell as eliminating conscious fabrication,” it “finds support in cases\r\nwithout number” (citing 6 J.

In determining whether a declarant’s\r\nstatements are testimonial, courts should look to all of the\r\nrelevant circumstances. Even JUSTICE SCALIA concedes\r\nthat the interrogator is relevant to this evaluation, post,\r\nat 3, and we agree that “[t]he identity of an interrogator,\r\nand the content and tenor of his questions,” ibid., can illu\r\nminate the “primary purpose of the interrogation.” The\r\ndissent, see post, at 3–5 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), criticizes\r\nthe complexity of our approach, but we, at least, are un\r\nwilling to sacrifice accuracy for simplicity. Simpler is not\r\nalways better, and courts making a “primary purpose”\r\nassessment should not be unjustifiably restrained from\r\nconsulting all relevant information, including the state\r\nments and actions of interrogators.\r\n  Objectively ascertaining the primary purpose of the\r\ninterrogation by examining the statements and actions of\r\nall participants is also the approach most consistent with\r\nour past holdings. E.g., Davis, 547 U. S., at 822–823, n. 1\r\n(noting that “volunteered testimony” is still testimony and\r\nremains subject to the requirements of the Confrontation\r\nClause).\r\n                             IV\r\n   As we suggested in Davis, when a court must determine\r\nwhether the Confrontation Clause bars the admission of a\r\nstatement at trial, it should determine the “primary pur\r\npose of the interrogation” by objectively evaluating the\r\nstatements and actions of the parties to the encounter, in\r\nlight of the circumstances in which the interrogation\r\noccurs. The existence of an emergency or the parties’\r\nperception that an emergency is ongoing is among the\r\nmost important circumstances that courts must take into\r\naccount in determining whether an interrogation is tes\r\ntimonial because statements made to assist police in\r\naddressing an ongoing emergency presumably lack the\r\ntestimonial purpose that would subject them to the\r\n24                      MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nrequirement of confrontation.13 As the context of this case\r\nbrings into sharp relief, the existence and duration of an\r\nemergency depend on the type and scope of danger posed\r\nto the victim, the police, and the public.\r\n  Applying this analysis to the facts of this case is more\r\ndifficult than in Davis because we do not have the luxury\r\nof reviewing a transcript of the conversation between the\r\nvictim and the police officers. Further complicating our\r\ntask is the fact that the trial in this case occurred before\r\nour decisions in Crawford and Davis. We therefore review\r\na record that was not developed to ascertain the “primary\r\npurpose of the interrogation.”\r\n  We first examine the circumstances in which the inter\r\nrogation occurred. The parties disagree over whether\r\nthere was an emergency when the police arrived at the gas\r\nstation. Bryant argues, and the Michigan Supreme Court\r\naccepted, 483 Mich., at 147, 768 N. W. 2d, at 73, that there\r\nwas no ongoing emergency because “there . . . was no\r\ncriminal conduct occurring. No shots were being fired, no\r\none was seen in possession of a firearm, nor were any\r\nwitnesses seen cowering in fear or running from the\r\nscene.” Brief for Respondent 27. Bryant, while conceding\r\nthat “a serious or life-threatening injury creates a medical\r\nemergency for a victim,” id., at 30, further argues that a\r\ndeclarant’s medical emergency is not relevant to the ongo\r\n——————\r\n   13 Of course the Confrontation Clause is not the only bar to admissi\r\n\r\nbility of hearsay statements at trial. State and federal rules of evidence\r\nprohibit the introduction of hearsay, subject to exceptions.

A He said what\r\nhappened was that he heard a shot and then he started to turn to get\r\noff the porch and then another one and then that’s when he was hit by\r\na gunshot” (testimony of Officer Stuglin) (paragraph breaks omitted)).\r\nUnlike the dissent’s apparent ability to read Covington’s mind, post, at\r\n6 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), we rely on the available evidence, which\r\nsuggests that Covington perceived an ongoing threat.\r\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                   27\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\npotential scope of the dispute and therefore the emergency\r\nin this case thus stretches more broadly than those at\r\nissue in Davis and Hammon and encompasses a threat\r\npotentially to the police and the public.\r\n  This is also the first of our post-Crawford Confrontation\r\nClause cases to involve a gun. The physical separation\r\nthat was sufficient to end the emergency in Hammon was\r\nnot necessarily sufficient to end the threat in this case;\r\nCovington was shot through the back door of Bryant’s\r\nhouse. Bryant’s argument that there was no ongoing\r\nemergency because “[n]o shots were being fired,” Brief for\r\nRespondent 27, surely construes ongoing emergency too\r\nnarrowly. An emergency does not last only for the time\r\nbetween when the assailant pulls the trigger and the\r\nbullet hits the victim. If an out-of-sight sniper pauses\r\nbetween shots, no one would say that the emergency\r\nceases during the pause. That is an extreme example and\r\nnot the situation here, but it serves to highlight the im\r\nplausibility, at least as to certain weapons, of construing\r\nthe emergency to last only precisely as long as the violent\r\nact itself, as some have construed our opinion in Davis.\r\nSee Brief for Respondent 23–25.\r\n  At no point during the questioning did either Covington\r\nor the police know the location of the shooter. In fact,\r\nBryant was not at home by the time the police searched\r\nhis house at approximately 5:30 a.m. 483 Mich., at 136,\r\n768 N. W. 2d, at 67. At some point between 3 a.m. and\r\n5:30 a.m., Bryant left his house. At bottom, there was an\r\nongoing emergency here where an armed shooter, whose\r\nmotive for and location after the shooting were unknown,\r\nhad mortally wounded Covington within a few blocks\r\nand a few minutes of the location where the police found\r\nCovington.17\r\n——————\r\n  17 It hardly bears mention that the emergency situation in this case is\r\n\r\nreadily distinguishable from the “treasonous conspiracies of unknown\r\n28                       MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                           Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n  This is not to suggest that the emergency continued\r\nuntil Bryant was arrested in California a year after the\r\nshooting. Id., at 137, 768 N. W. 2d, at 67. We need not\r\ndecide precisely when the emergency ended because Cov\r\nington’s encounter with the police and all of the state\r\nments he made during that interaction occurred within\r\nthe first few minutes of the police officers’ arrival and\r\nwell before they secured the scene of the shooting—the\r\nshooter’s last known location.\r\n  We reiterate, moreover, that the existence vel non of an\r\nongoing emergency is not the touchstone of the testimonial\r\ninquiry; rather, the ultimate inquiry is whether the “pri\r\nmary purpose of the interrogation [was] to enable police\r\nassistance to meet [the] ongoing emergency.” Davis, 547\r\nU. S., at 822. We turn now to that inquiry, as informed by\r\nthe circumstances of the ongoing emergency just de\r\nscribed. The circumstances of the encounter provide im\r\nportant context for understanding Covington’s statements\r\nto the police. When the police arrived at Covington’s side,\r\ntheir first question to him was “What happened?”18 Cov\r\nington’s response was either “Rick shot me” or “I was\r\nshot,” followed very quickly by an identification of “Rick”\r\n——————\r\nscope, aimed at killing or overthrowing the king,” post, at 11, about\r\nwhich JUSTICE SCALIA’s dissent is quite concerned.\r\n   18 Although the dissent claims otherwise, post, at 7 (opinion of\r\n\r\nSCALIA, J.), at least one officer asked Covington something akin to “how\r\nwas he doing.” App. 131 (testimony of Officer Stuglin) (“A I approached\r\nthe subject, the victim, Mr. Covington, on the ground and had asked\r\nsomething like what happened or are you okay, something to that\r\nline. . . . Q So you asked this man how are you, how are you doing? A\r\nWell, basically it’s, you know, what’s wrong, you know” (paragraph\r\nbreaks omitted)). The officers also testified about their assessment of\r\nCovington’s wounds. See id., at 35 (suppression hearing testimony of\r\nOfficer Brown) (“[H]e had blood . . . on the front of his body”); id., at 75\r\n(testimony of Officer McCallister) (“It appeared he had a stomach\r\nwound of a gunshot”); id., at 132 (testimony of Officer Stuglin) (“Q Did\r\nyou see the wound? A Yes, I did. Q You had to move some clothing to\r\ndo that? A Yes” (paragraph breaks omitted)).\r\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    29\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nas the shooter. App. 76. In response to further questions,\r\nCovington explained that the shooting occurred through\r\nthe back door of Bryant’s house and provided a physical\r\ndescription of the shooter. When he made the statements,\r\nCovington was lying in a gas station parking lot bleeding\r\nfrom a mortal gunshot wound to his abdomen. His an\r\nswers to the police officers’ questions were punctuated\r\nwith questions about when emergency medical services\r\nwould arrive. Id., at 56–57 (suppression hearing testi\r\nmony of Officer Brown). He was obviously in considerable\r\npain and had difficulty breathing and talking. Id., at 75,\r\n83–84 (testimony of Officer McCallister); id., at 101, 110–\r\n111 (testimony of Sgt. Wenturine); id., at 126, 137 (testi\r\nmony of Officer Stuglin). From this description of his\r\ncondition and report of his statements, we cannot say that\r\na person in Covington’s situation would have had a “pri\r\nmary purpose” “to establish or prove past events poten\r\ntially relevant to later criminal prosecution.” Davis, 547\r\nU. S., at 822.\r\n   For their part, the police responded to a call that a man\r\nhad been shot. As discussed above, they did not know\r\nwhy, where, or when the shooting had occurred. Nor did\r\nthey know the location of the shooter or anything else\r\nabout the circumstances in which the crime occurred.19\r\n——————\r\n   19 Contrary to the dissent’s suggestion, post, at 8 (opinion of SCALIA,\r\n\r\nJ.), and despite the fact that the record was developed prior to Davis’\r\nfocus on the existence of an “ongoing emergency,” the record contains\r\nsome testimony to support the idea that the police officers were con\r\ncerned about the location of the shooter when they arrived on the scene\r\nand thus to suggest that the purpose of the questioning of Covington\r\nwas to determine the shooter’s location. See App. 136 (testimony of\r\nOfficer Stuglin) (stating that upon arrival officers questioned the gas\r\nstation clerk about whether the shooting occurred in the gas station\r\nparking lot and about concern for safety); see also ibid. (testimony of\r\nOfficer Stuglin) (“Q . . . So you have some concern, there may be a\r\nperson with a gun or somebody, a shooter right there in the immediate\r\narea? A Sure, yes. Q And you want to see that that area gets secured?\r\n30                      MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nThe questions they asked—“what had happened, who had\r\nshot him, and where the shooting occurred,” 483 Mich., at\r\n143, 768 N. W. 2d, at 71—were the exact type of questions\r\nnecessary to allow the police to “ ‘assess the situation, the\r\nthreat to their own safety, and possible danger to the\r\npotential victim’ ” and to the public, Davis, 547 U. S., at\r\n832 (quoting Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Court of Nev.,\r\nHumboldt Cty., 542 U. S. 177, 186 (2004)), including to\r\nallow them to ascertain “whether they would be encoun\r\ntering a violent felon,”20 Davis, 547 U. S., at 827. In other\r\nwords, they solicited the information necessary to enable\r\nthem “to meet an ongoing emergency.” Id., at 822.\r\n  Nothing in Covington’s responses indicated to the police\r\nthat, contrary to their expectation upon responding to a\r\ncall reporting a shooting, there was no emergency or that\r\na prior emergency had ended. Covington did indicate that\r\nhe had been shot at another location about 25 minutes\r\nearlier, but he did not know the location of the shooter at\r\nthe time the police arrived and, as far as we can tell from\r\nthe record, he gave no indication that the shooter, having\r\nshot at him twice, would be satisfied that Covington was\r\nonly wounded. In fact, Covington did not indicate any\r\npossible motive for the shooting, and thereby gave no\r\nreason to think that the shooter would not shoot again if\r\nhe arrived on the scene. As we noted in Davis, “initial\r\ninquiries” may “often . . . produce nontestimonial state\r\n——————\r\nA Correct. Q For your safety as well as everyone else? A Correct”\r\n(paragraph breaks omitted)); id., at 82 (testimony of Officer McCallis\r\nter). But see id., at 83 (cross-examination of Officer McAllister) (“Q You\r\ndidn’t, you didn’t look around and say, gee, there might be a shooter\r\naround here, I better keep an eye open? A I did not, no. That could\r\nhave been my partner I don’t know” (paragraph breaks omitted)).\r\n  20 Hiibel, like our post-Crawford Confrontation Clause cases, involved\r\n\r\ndomestic violence, which explains the Court’s focus on the security of\r\nthe victim and the police: they were the only parties potentially threat\r\nened by the assailant. 542 U. S., at 186 (noting that the case involved a\r\n“domestic assault”).\r\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           31\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nments.” Id., at 832. The initial inquiries in this case\r\nresulted in the type of nontestimonial statements we\r\ncontemplated in Davis.\r\n   Finally, we consider the informality of the situation and\r\nthe interrogation. This situation is more similar, though\r\nnot identical, to the informal, harried 911 call in Davis\r\nthan to the structured, station-house interview in Craw\r\nford. As the officers’ trial testimony reflects, the situation\r\nwas fluid and somewhat confused: the officers arrived at\r\ndifferent times; apparently each, upon arrival, asked\r\nCovington “what happened?”; and, contrary to the dis\r\nsent’s portrayal, post, at 7–9 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), they\r\ndid not conduct a structured interrogation. App. 84 (tes\r\ntimony of Officer McCallister) (explaining duplicate ques\r\ntioning, especially as to “what happened?”); id., at 101–102\r\n(testimony of Sgt. Wenturine) (same); id., at 126–127\r\n(testimony of Officer Stuglin) (same). The informality\r\nsuggests that the interrogators’ primary purpose was\r\nsimply to address what they perceived to be an ongoing\r\nemergency, and the circumstances lacked any formality\r\nthat would have alerted Covington to or focused him on\r\nthe possible future prosecutorial use of his statements.\r\n   Because the circumstances of the encounter as well as\r\nthe statements and actions of Covington and the police\r\nobjectively indicate that the “primary purpose of the inter\r\nrogation” was “to enable police assistance to meet an\r\nongoing emergency,” Davis, 547 U. S., at 822, Covington’s\r\nidentification and description of the shooter and the lo\r\ncation of the shooting were not testimonial hearsay.\r\nThe Confrontation Clause did not bar their admission at\r\nBryant’s trial.\r\n\r\n                         *      *     *\r\n\r\n  For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Covington’s\r\nstatements were not testimonial and that their admission\r\n32                 MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nat Bryant’s trial did not violate the Confrontation Clause.\r\nWe leave for the Michigan courts to decide on remand\r\nwhether the statements’ admission was otherwise permit\r\nted by state hearsay rules. The judgment of the Supreme\r\nCourt of Michigan is vacated, and the case is remanded for\r\nfurther proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\n                                            It is so ordered.\r\n\r\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\r\ndecision of this case.\r\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 68 (2004).\r\n  In determining whether Covington’s statements to\r\npolice implicate the Confrontation Clause, the Court\r\nevaluates the “ ‘primary purpose’ ” of the interrogation.\r\nAnte, at 12. The majority’s analysis⎯which relies on,\r\ninter alia, what the police knew when they arrived at the\r\nscene, the specific questions they asked, the particular\r\ninformation Covington conveyed, the weapon involved,\r\nand Covington’s medical condition⎯illustrates the uncer\r\ntainty that this test creates for law enforcement and the\r\nlower courts. Ante, at 25–31. I have criticized the\r\nprimary-purpose test as “an exercise in fiction” that is\r\n“disconnected from history” and “yields no predictable\r\nresults.” Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 839, 838\r\n(2006) (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dis\r\nsenting in part).\r\n  Rather than attempting to reconstruct the “primary\r\npurpose” of the participants, I would consider the extent to\r\nwhich the interrogation resembles those historical prac\r\n2                   MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\ntices that the Confrontation Clause addressed. See, e.g.,\r\nid., at 835–836 (describing “practices that occurred under\r\nthe English bail and committal statutes passed during the\r\nreign of Queen Mary”). As the majority notes, Covington\r\ninteracted with the police under highly informal circum\r\nstances, while he bled from a fatal gunshot wound. Ante,\r\nat 19–20, 31. The police questioning was not “a formalized\r\ndialogue,” did not result in “formalized testimonial ma\r\nterials” such as a deposition or affidavit, and bore no “in-\r\ndicia of solemnity.” Davis, supra, at 840, 837 (opinion of\r\nTHOMAS, J.); see also Giles v. California, 554 U. S. 353,\r\n377–378 (2008) (THOMAS, J., concurring). Nor is there any\r\nindication that the statements were offered at trial “in\r\norder to evade confrontation.” Davis, supra, at 840. This\r\ninterrogation bears little if any resemblance to the histori\r\ncal practices that the Confrontation Clause aimed to elimi\r\nnate. Covington thus did not “bea[r] testimony” against\r\nBryant, Crawford, supra, at 51, and the introduction of his\r\nstatements at trial did not implicate the Confrontation\r\nClause. I concur in the judgment.\r\n                  Cite as: 562 U.

But reaching a patently incorrect conclu\r\nsion on the facts is a relatively benign judicial mischief; it\r\naffects, after all, only the case at hand. In its vain attempt\r\nto make the incredible plausible, however—or perhaps as\r\nan intended second goal—today’s opinion distorts our\r\nConfrontation Clause jurisprudence and leaves it in a\r\nshambles. Instead of clarifying the law, the Court makes\r\nitself the obfuscator of last resort. Because I continue to\r\nadhere to the Confrontation Clause that the People\r\nadopted, as described in Crawford v. Washington, 541\r\nU. S. 36 (2004), I dissent.\r\n                              I\r\n\r\n                              A\r\n\r\n  The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment,\r\nmade binding on the States by the Fourteenth Amend\r\nment, Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400, 403 (1965), provides\r\nthat “[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy\r\n2                   MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nthe right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against\r\nhim.” In Crawford, we held that this provision guarantees\r\na defendant his common-law right to confront those “who\r\n‘bear testimony’ ” against him. 541 U. S., at 51. A witness\r\nmust deliver his testimony against the defendant in per\r\nson, or the prosecution must prove that the witness is\r\nunavailable to appear at trial and that the defendant\r\nhas had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. Id., at\r\n53–54.\r\n    Not all hearsay falls within the Confrontation Clause’s\r\ngrasp. At trial a witness “bears testimony” by providing\r\n“ ‘[a] solemn declaration or affirmation . . . for the purpose\r\nof establishing or proving some fact.’ ” Id., at 51 (quoting 2\r\nN. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Lan\r\nguage (1828)). The Confrontation Clause protects defen\r\ndants only from hearsay statements that do the same.\r\nDavis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 823–824 (2006). In\r\nDavis, we explained how to identify testimonial hearsay\r\nprompted by police questioning in the field. A statement\r\nis testimonial “when the circumstances objectively indi\r\ncate . . . that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to\r\nestablish or prove past events potentially relevant to later\r\ncriminal prosecution.” Id., at 822. When, however, the\r\ncircumstances objectively indicate that the declarant’s\r\nstatements were “a cry for help [o]r the provision of infor\r\nmation enabling officers immediately to end a threatening\r\nsituation,” id., at 832, they bear little resemblance to in\r\ncourt testimony. “No ‘witness’ goes into court to proclaim\r\nan emergency and seek help.” Id., at 828.\r\n    Crawford and Davis did not address whose perspective\r\nmatters—the declarant’s, the interrogator’s, or both—\r\nwhen assessing “the primary purpose of [an] interroga\r\ntion.” In those cases the statements were testimonial from\r\nany perspective. I think the same is true here, but be\r\ncause the Court picks a perspective so will I: The decla\r\nrant’s intent is what counts. In-court testimony is more\r\n                   Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                 3\r\n\r\n                       SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nthan a narrative of past events; it is a solemn declaration\r\nmade in the course of a criminal trial. For an out-of-court\r\nstatement to qualify as testimonial, the declarant must\r\nintend the statement to be a solemn declaration rather\r\nthan an unconsidered or offhand remark; and he must\r\nmake the statement with the understanding that it may\r\nbe used to invoke the coercive machinery of the State\r\nagainst the accused.1 See Friedman, Grappling with the\r\nMeaning of “Testimonial,” 71 Brooklyn L. Rev. 241, 259\r\n(2005). That is what distinguishes a narrative told to a\r\nfriend over dinner from a statement to the police. See\r\nCrawford, supra, at 51. The hidden purpose of an interro\r\ngator cannot substitute for the declarant’s intentional\r\nsolemnity or his understanding of how his words may be\r\nused.\r\n   A declarant-focused inquiry is also the only inquiry that\r\nwould work in every fact pattern implicating the Confron\r\ntation Clause. The Clause applies to volunteered testi\r\nmony as well as statements solicited through police inter\r\nrogation. See Davis, supra, at 822–823, n. 1. An inquiry\r\ninto an officer’s purposes would make no sense when a\r\ndeclarant blurts out “Rick shot me” as soon as the officer\r\narrives on the scene. I see no reason to adopt a different\r\ntest—one that accounts for an officer’s intent—when the\r\nofficer asks “what happened” before the declarant makes\r\nhis accusation. (This does not mean the interrogator is\r\nirrelevant. The identity of an interrogator, and the con\r\ntent and tenor of his questions, can bear upon whether a\r\ndeclarant intends to make a solemn statement, and envi\r\nsions its use at a criminal trial. But none of this means\r\nthat the interrogator’s purpose matters.)\r\n   In an unsuccessful attempt to make its finding of emer\r\n——————\r\n  1 I remain agnostic about whether and when statements to nonstate\r\n\r\nactors are testimonial. See Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 823,\r\nn. 2 (2006).\r\n4                  MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ngency plausible, the Court instead adopts a test that looks\r\nto the purposes of both the police and the declarant. It\r\nclaims that this is demanded by necessity, fretting that a\r\ndomestic-violence victim may want her abuser briefly\r\narrested—presumably to teach him a lesson—but not\r\ndesire prosecution. See ante, at 22. I do not need to probe\r\nthe purposes of the police to solve that problem. Even if a\r\nvictim speaks to the police “to establish or prove past\r\nevents” solely for the purpose of getting her abuser ar\r\nrested, she surely knows her account is “potentially rel\r\nevant to later criminal prosecution” should one ensue.\r\nDavis, supra, at 822.\r\n   The Court also wrings its hands over the possibility that\r\n“a severely injured victim” may lack the capacity to form a\r\npurpose, and instead answer questions “reflexive[ly].”\r\nAnte, at 22. How to assess whether a declarant with\r\ndiminished capacity bore testimony is a difficult question,\r\nand one I do not need to answer today. But the Court’s\r\nproposed answer—to substitute the intentions of the police\r\nfor the missing intentions of the declarant—cannot be the\r\ncorrect one. When the declarant has diminished capacity,\r\nfocusing on the interrogators make less sense, not more.\r\nThe inquiry under Crawford turns in part on the actions\r\nand statements of a declarant’s audience only because\r\nthey shape the declarant’s perception of why his audience\r\nis listening and therefore influence his purpose in making\r\nthe declaration. See 541 U. S., at 51. But a person who\r\ncannot perceive his own purposes certainly cannot per\r\nceive why a listener might be interested in what he has to\r\nsay. As far as I can tell, the Court’s substituted-intent\r\ntheory “has nothing to be said for it except that it can\r\nsometimes make our job easier,” Jerman v. Carlisle,\r\nMcNellie, Rini, Kramer & Ulrich, L. P. A., 559 U. S. ___,\r\n___ (2010) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring\r\nin judgment) (slip op., at 2).\r\n   The Court claims one affirmative virtue for its focus on\r\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\r\n\r\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nthe purposes of both the declarant and the police: It “ame\r\nliorates problems that . . . arise” when declarants have\r\n“mixed motives.” Ante, at 21. I am at a loss to know how.\r\nSorting out the primary purpose of a declarant with mixed\r\nmotives is sometimes difficult. But adding in the mixed\r\nmotives of the police only compounds the problem. Now\r\ncourts will have to sort through two sets of mixed motives\r\nto determine the primary purpose of an interrogation.\r\nAnd the Court’s solution creates a mixed-motive problem\r\nwhere (under the proper theory) it does not exist—viz.,\r\nwhere the police and the declarant each have one motive,\r\nbut those motives conflict. The Court does not provide an\r\nanswer to this glaringly obvious problem, probably be\r\ncause it does not have one.\r\n   The only virtue of the Court’s approach (if it can be\r\nmisnamned a virtue) is that it leaves judges free to reach\r\nthe “fairest” result under the totality of the circumstances.\r\nIf the dastardly police trick a declarant into giving an\r\nincriminating statement against a sympathetic defendant,\r\na court can focus on the police’s intent and declare the\r\nstatement testimonial. If the defendant “deserves” to go to\r\njail, then a court can focus on whatever perspective is\r\nnecessary to declare damning hearsay nontestimonial.\r\nAnd when all else fails, a court can mix-and-match per\r\nspectives to reach its desired outcome. Unfortunately,\r\nunder this malleable approach “the guarantee of confron\r\ntation is no guarantee at all.” Giles v. California, 554\r\nU. S. 353, 375 (2008) (plurality).\r\n                             B\r\n  Looking to the declarant’s purpose (as we should), this is\r\nan absurdly easy case. Roughly 25 minutes after Anthony\r\nCovington had been shot, Detroit police responded to a 911\r\ncall reporting that a gunshot victim had appeared at a\r\nneighborhood gas station. They quickly arrived at the\r\nscene, and in less than 10 minutes five different Detroit\r\n6                   MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\npolice officers questioned Covington about the shooting.\r\nEach asked him a similar battery of questions: “what\r\nhappened” and when, App. 39, 126, “who shot” the victim,”\r\nid., at 22, and “where” did the shooting take place, id., at\r\n132. See also id., at 113. After Covington would answer,\r\nthey would ask follow-up questions, such as “how tall is”\r\nthe shooter, id., at 134, “[h]ow much does he weigh,” ibid.\r\nwhat is the exact address or physical description of the\r\nhouse where the shooting took place, and what chain\r\nof events led to the shooting. The battery relented when\r\nthe paramedics arrived and began tending to Covington’s\r\nwounds.\r\n   From Covington’s perspective, his statements had little\r\nvalue except to ensure the arrest and eventual prosecution\r\nof Richard Bryant. He knew the “threatening situation,”\r\nDavis, 547 U. S., at 832, had ended six blocks away and 25\r\nminutes earlier when he fled from Bryant’s back porch.\r\nSee </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"836812\"><a href=\"/opinion/836812/people-v-bryant/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">132</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 135–136, 768 N.W. 2d 65, 67 (2009);\r\nApp. 105. Bryant had not confronted him face-to-face\r\nbefore he was mortally wounded, instead shooting him\r\nthrough a door. See 483 Mich., at 136–137, 768 N.W. 2d,\r\nat 67. Even if Bryant had pursued him (unlikely), and\r\nafter seeing that Covington had ended up at the gas sta\r\ntion was unable to confront him there before the police\r\narrived (doubly unlikely), it was entirely beyond imagina\r\ntion that Bryant would again open fire while Covington\r\nwas surrounded by five armed police officers. And Coving\r\nton knew the shooting was the work of a drug dealer, not a\r\nspree killer who might randomly threaten others.

See id., at 831.\r\n   Covington’s pressing medical needs do not suggest that\r\nhe was responding to an emergency, but to the contrary\r\nreinforce the testimonial character of his statements. He\r\nunderstood the police were focused on investigating a past\r\ncrime, not his medical needs. None of the officers asked\r\nCovington how he was doing, attempted more than super\r\nficially to assess the severity of his wounds, or attempted\r\nto administer first aid.2 They instead primarily asked\r\nquestions with little, if any, relevance to Covington’s dire\r\nsituation. Police, paramedics, and doctors do not need to\r\nknow the address where a shooting took place, the name of\r\nthe shooter, or the shooter’s height and weight to provide\r\nproper medical care. Underscoring that Covington under\r\nstood the officers’ investigative role, he interrupted their\r\ninterrogation to ask “when is EMS coming?” App. 57.\r\nWhen, in other words, would the focus shift to his medical\r\nneeds rather than Bryant’s crime?\r\n   Neither Covington’s statements nor the colloquy be\r\ntween him and the officers would have been out of place at\r\na trial; it would have been a routine direct examination.\r\nSee Davis, 547 U. S., at 830. Like a witness, Covington\r\nrecounted in detail how a past criminal event began and\r\nprogressed, and like a prosecutor, the police elicited that\r\naccount through structured questioning. Preventing the\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  2 Officer Stuglin’s testimony does not undermine my assessment of\r\n\r\nthe officers’ behavior, although the Court suggests otherwise. See ante,\r\nat 28, n. 18. Officer Stuglin first testified that he “asked something like\r\nwhat happened or are you okay, something to that line.” App., 131.\r\nWhen pressed on whether he asked “how are you doing?,” he responded,\r\n“Well, basically . . . what’s wrong.” Ibid. Other officers were not so\r\nequivocal: They admitted they had no need to “ask him how he was\r\ndoing. . . . It was very obvious how he was doing.” Id., at 110; see also\r\nid., at 19.\r\n8                       MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nadmission of “weaker substitute[s] for live testimony at\r\ntrial” such as this, id., at 828 (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted), is precisely what motivated the Framers to adopt\r\nthe Confrontation Clause and what motivated our deci\r\nsions in Crawford and in Hammon v. Indiana, decided\r\nwith Davis. Ex parte examinations raise the same consti\r\ntutional concerns whether they take place in a gas-station\r\nparking lot or in a police interrogation room.\r\n                               C\r\n  Worse still for the repute of today’s opinion, this is an\r\nabsurdly easy case even if one (erroneously) takes the\r\ninterrogating officers’ purpose into account. The five\r\nofficers interrogated Covington primarily to investigate\r\npast criminal events. None—absolutely none—of their\r\nactions indicated that they perceived an imminent threat.\r\nThey did not draw their weapons, and indeed did not\r\nimmediately search the gas station for potential shooters.3\r\nTo the contrary, all five testified that they questioned\r\nCovington before conducting any investigation at the scene.\r\nWould this have made any sense if they feared the pres\r\nence of a shooter? Most tellingly, none of the officers\r\nstarted his interrogation by asking what would have been\r\nthe obvious first question if any hint of such a fear existed:\r\nWhere is the shooter?\r\n  But do not rely solely on my word about the officers’\r\nprimary purpose. Listen to Sergeant Wenturine, who\r\ncandidly admitted that he interrogated Covington because\r\nhe “ha[d] a man here that [he] believe[d] [was] dying [so\r\n——————\r\n    3 The\r\n        Court cites Officer Stuglin’s testimony that “I think [Brown and\r\nPellerito] did a little bit of both” joining the interrogation and helping\r\nto secure the scene. Id., at 135–136. But the point is not whether they\r\ndid both; it is whether they moved to secure the area first. No officer’s\r\ntestimony suggests this. Pellerito testified that he, Stuglin, and Brown\r\narrived at the scene at roughly the same time and all three immedi\r\nately went to Covington. See id., at 17–18. The testimony of Brown\r\nand McCallister corroborate that account. See id., at 34–36, 79–82.\r\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

In\r\nshort, he needed to interrogate Covington to solve a crime.\r\nWenturine never mentioned an interest in ending an\r\nongoing emergency.\r\n  At the very least, the officers’ intentions turned investi\r\ngative during their 10-minute encounter with Covington,\r\nand the conversation “evolve[d] into testimonial state\r\nments.” Davis, 547 U. S., at 828 (internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted). The fifth officer to arrive at the scene did\r\nnot need to run straight to Covington and ask a battery of\r\nquestions “to determine the need for emergency assis\r\ntance,” Ibid. He could have asked his fellow officers, who\r\npresumably had a better sense of that than Covington—\r\nand a better sense of what he could do to assist. No, the\r\nvalue of asking the same battery of questions a fifth time\r\nwas to ensure that Covington told a consistent story and\r\nto see if any new details helpful to the investigation and\r\neventual prosecution would emerge. Having the testimony\r\nof five officers to recount Covington’s consistent story\r\nundoubtedly helped obtain Bryant’s conviction. (Which\r\ncame, I may note, after the first jury could not reach a\r\nverdict. See 483 Mich., at 137, 768 N.W. 2d, at 67.)\r\n                            D\r\n   A final word about the Court’s active imagination. The\r\nCourt invents a world where an ongoing emergency exists\r\nwhenever “an armed shooter, whose motive for and lo\r\ncation after the shooting [are] unknown, . . . mortally\r\nwound[s]” one individual “within a few blocks and [25]\r\nminutes of the location where the police” ultimately find\r\nthat victim. Ante, at 27. Breathlessly, it worries that a\r\nshooter could leave the scene armed and ready to pull the\r\ntrigger again. See ante, at 17–18, 27, 30. Nothing sug\r\ngests the five officers in this case shared the Court’s\r\n10                     MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ndystopian4 view of Detroit, where drug dealers hunt their\r\nshooting victim down and fire into a crowd of police offi\r\ncers to finish him off, see ante, at 30, or where spree kill\r\ners shoot through a door and then roam the streets leaving\r\na trail of bodies behind. Because almost 90 percent of\r\nmurders involve a single victim,5 it is much more likely—\r\nindeed, I think it certain—that the officers viewed their\r\nencounter with Covington for what it was: an investi\r\ngation into a past crime with no ongoing or immediate\r\nconsequences.\r\n   The Court’s distorted view creates an expansive excep\r\ntion to the Confrontation Clause for violent crimes. Be\r\ncause Bryant posed a continuing threat to public safety in\r\nthe Court’s imagination, the emergency persisted for\r\nconfrontation purposes at least until the police learned his\r\n“motive for and location after the shooting.” Ante, at 27.\r\nIt may have persisted in this case until the police “secured\r\nthe scene of the shooting” two-and-a-half hours later.\r\nAnte, at 28. (The relevance of securing the scene is un\r\nclear so long as the killer is still at large—especially if, as\r\nthe Court speculates, he may be a spree-killer.) This is a\r\ndangerous definition of emergency. Many individuals who\r\ntestify against a defendant at trial first offer their ac\r\ncounts to police in the hours after a violent act. If the\r\npolice can plausibly claim that a “potential threat to . . .\r\nthe public” persisted through those first few hours, ante,\r\nat 12 (and if the claim is plausible here it is always plau\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  4 The opposite of utopian.

His conviction could rest (as perhaps it did\r\nhere) solely on the officers’ recollection at trial of the\r\nwitnesses’ accusations.\r\n   The Framers could not have envisioned such a hollow\r\nconstitutional guarantee. No framing-era confrontation\r\ncase that I know of, neither here nor in England, took such\r\nan enfeebled view of the right to confrontation. For exam\r\nple, King v. Brasier, 1 Leach 199, 200, 168 Eng. Rep. 202,\r\n202–203 (K. B. 1779), held inadmissible a mother’s ac\r\ncount of her young daughter’s statements “immediately on\r\nher coming home” after being sexually assaulted. The\r\ndaughter needed to testify herself. But today’s majority\r\npresumably would hold the daughter’s account to her\r\nmother a nontestimonial statement made during an ongo\r\ning emergency. She could not have known whether her\r\nattacker might reappear to attack again or attempt to\r\nsilence the lone witness against him. Her mother likely\r\nlistened to the account to assess the threat to her own\r\nsafety and to decide whether the rapist posed a threat\r\nto the community that required the immediate interven\r\ntion of the local authorities. Cf. ante, at 29–30. Utter\r\nnonsense.\r\n   The 16th- and 17th-century English treason trials that\r\nhelped inspire the Confrontation Clause show that today’s\r\ndecision is a mistake. The Court’s expansive definition of\r\nan “ongoing emergency” and its willingness to consider the\r\nperspective of the interrogator and the declarant cast a\r\nmore favorable light on those trials than history or our\r\npast decisions suggest they deserve. Royal officials con\r\nducted many of the ex parte examinations introduced\r\nagainst Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir John Fenwick while\r\ninvestigating alleged treasonous conspiracies of unknown\r\nscope, aimed at killing or overthrowing the King. See\r\nBrief for National Association of Criminal Defense Law\r\n12                 MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nyers as Amicus Curiae 21–22, and n. 11. Social stability in\r\n16th- and 17th-century England depended mainly on the\r\ncontinuity of the ruling monarch, cf. 1 J. Stephen, A His\r\ntory of the Criminal Law of England 354 (1883), so such a\r\nconspiracy posed the most pressing emergency imaginable.\r\nPresumably, the royal officials investigating it would have\r\nunderstood the gravity of the situation and would have\r\nfocused their interrogations primarily on ending the\r\nthreat, not on generating testimony for trial. I therefore\r\ndoubt that under the Court’s test English officials acted\r\nimproperly by denying Raleigh and Fenwick the opportu\r\nnity to confront their accusers “face to face,” id., at 326.\r\n  Under my approach, in contrast, those English trials\r\nremain unquestionably infamous. Lord Cobham did not\r\nspeak with royal officials to end an ongoing emergency.\r\nHe was a traitor! He spoke, as Raleigh correctly observed,\r\nto establish Raleigh’s guilt and to save his own life. See 1\r\nD. Jardine, Criminal Trials 435 (1832). Cobham’s state\r\nments, when assessed from his perspective, had only a\r\ntestimonial purpose. The same is true of Covington’s\r\nstatements here.\r\n                             II \r\n\r\n                             A\r\n\r\n  But today’s decision is not only a gross distortion of the\r\nfacts. It is a gross distortion of the law—a revisionist\r\nnarrative in which reliability continues to guide our Con\r\nfrontation Clause jurisprudence, at least where emergen\r\ncies and faux emergencies are concerned.\r\n  According to today’s opinion, the Davis inquiry into\r\nwhether a declarant spoke to end an ongoing emergency or\r\nrather to “prove past events potentially relevant to later\r\ncriminal prosecution,” 547 U. S., at 822, is not aimed at\r\nanswering whether the declarant acted as a witness.\r\nInstead, the Davis inquiry probes the reliability of a decla\r\nrant’s statements, “[i]mplicit[ly]” importing the excited\r\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

A statement during an ongoing emergency is\r\nsufficiently reliable, the Court says, “because the prospect\r\nof fabrication . . . is presumably significantly diminished,”\r\nso it “does not [need] to be subject to the crucible of cross\r\nexamination.” Id., at 14.\r\n   Compare that with the holding of Crawford: “Where\r\ntestimonial statements are at issue, the only indicium of\r\nreliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is\r\nthe one the Constitution actually prescribes: confronta\r\ntion.” 541 U. S., at 68–69. Today’s opinion adopts, for\r\nemergencies and faux emergencies at least, the discredited\r\nlogic of White v. Illinois, 502 U. S. 346, 355–356, and n. 8\r\n(1992), and Idaho v. Wright, 497 U. S. 805, 819–820\r\n(1990). White is, of course, the decision that both Craw\r\nford and Davis found most incompatible with the text and\r\nhistory of the Confrontation Clause. See Davis, supra, at\r\n825; Crawford, supra, at 58, n. 8. (This is not to say that\r\nthat “reliability” logic can actually justify today’s result:\r\nTwenty-five minutes is plenty of time for a shooting victim\r\nto reflect and fabricate a false story.)\r\n   The Court announces that in future cases it will look to\r\n“standard rules of hearsay, designed to identify some\r\nstatements as reliable,” when deciding whether a state\r\nment is testimonial. Ante, at 11–12. Ohio v. Roberts, 448\r\nU. S. 56 (1980) said something remarkably similar: An\r\nout-of-court statement is admissible if it “falls within a\r\nfirmly rooted hearsay exception” or otherwise “bears ade\r\nquate ‘indicia of reliability.’ ” Id., at 66. We tried that\r\napproach to the Confrontation Clause for nearly 25 years\r\nbefore Crawford rejected it as an unworkable standard\r\nunmoored from the text and the historical roots of the\r\nConfrontation Clause. See 541 U. S., at 54, 60, 63–65, 67–\r\n68. The arguments in Raleigh’s infamous 17th-century\r\ntreason trial contained full debate about the reliability of\r\nLord Cobham’s ex parte accusations, see Raleigh’s Case,\r\n14                  MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n2 How. St. Tr. 1, 14, 17, 19–20, 22–23, 29 (1603); that\r\ncase remains the canonical example of a Confrontation\r\nClause violation, not because Raleigh should have won the\r\ndebate but because he should have been allowed\r\ncross-examination.\r\n   The Court attempts to fit its resurrected interest in\r\nreliability into the Crawford framework, but the result is\r\nincoherent. Reliability, the Court tells us, is a good indi\r\ncator of whether “a statement is . . . an out-of-court substi\r\ntute for trial testimony.” Ante, at 11. That is patently\r\nfalse. Reliability tells us nothing about whether a state\r\nment is testimonial. Testimonial and nontestimonial\r\nstatements alike come in varying degrees of reliability.\r\nAn eyewitness’s statements to the police after a fender\r\nbender, for example, are both reliable and testimonial.\r\nStatements to the police from one driver attempting to\r\nblame the other would be similarly testimonial but rarely\r\nreliable.\r\n   The Court suggests otherwise because it “misunder\r\nstands the relationship” between qualification for one of\r\nthe standard hearsay exceptions and exemption from the\r\nconfrontation requirement. Melendez-Diaz v. Massachu\r\nsetts, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 18). That rela\r\ntionship is not a causal one. Hearsay law exempts busi\r\nness records, for example, because businesses have a\r\nfinancial incentive to keep reliable records. See Fed. Rule\r\nEvid. 803(6). The Sixth Amendment also generally admits\r\nbusiness records into evidence, but not because the records\r\nare reliable or because hearsay law says so. It admits\r\nthem “because—having been created for the administra\r\ntion of an entity’s affairs and not for the purpose of estab\r\nlishing or proving some fact at trial—they are not” weaker\r\nsubstitutes for live testimony. Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S.,\r\nat ___ (slip op., at 18). Moreover, the scope of the exemp\r\ntion from confrontation and that of the hearsay exceptions\r\nalso are not always coextensive. The reliability logic of the\r\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

The Confrontation\r\nClause is not so forgiving. Business records prepared\r\nspecifically for use at a criminal trial are testimonial and\r\nrequire confrontation. See ibid.\r\n  Is it possible that the Court does not recognize the\r\ncontradiction between its focus on reliable statements and\r\nCrawford’s focus on testimonial ones? Does it not realize\r\nthat the two cannot coexist? Or does it intend, by follow\r\ning today’s illogical roadmap, to resurrect Roberts by a\r\nthousand unprincipled distinctions without ever explicitly\r\noverruling Crawford? After all, honestly overruling Craw\r\nford would destroy the illusion of judicial minimalism and\r\nrestraint. And it would force the Court to explain how\r\nthe Justices’ preference comports with the meaning of the\r\nConfrontation Clause that the People adopted—or to\r\nconfess that only the Justices’ preference really matters.\r\n                              B\r\n  The Court recedes from Crawford in a second significant\r\nway. It requires judges to conduct “open-ended balancing\r\ntests” and “amorphous, if not entirely subjective,” inquir\r\nies into the totality of the circumstances bearing upon\r\nreliability. 541 U. S., at 63, 68. Where the prosecution\r\ncries “emergency,” the admissibility of a statement now\r\nturns on “a highly context-dependent inquiry,” ante, at 16,\r\ninto the type of weapon the defendant wielded, see ante, at\r\n17; the type of crime the defendant committed, see ante, at\r\n12, 16–17; the medical condition of the declarant, see ante,\r\nat 17–18; if the declarant is injured, whether paramedics\r\nhave arrived on the scene, see ante, at 20; whether the\r\nencounter takes place in an “exposed public area,” ibid.;\r\nwhether the encounter appears disorganized, see ibid.;\r\nwhether the declarant is capable of forming a purpose, see\r\nante, at 22; whether the police have secured the scene of\r\n16                 MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nthe crime, see ante, at 28; the formality of the statement,\r\nsee ante, at 19; and finally, whether the statement strikes\r\nus as reliable, see ante, at 11–12, 14–15. This is no better\r\nthan the nine-factor balancing test we rejected in Craw\r\nford, 541 U. S., at 63. I do not look forward to resolving\r\nconflicts in the future over whether knives and poison are\r\nmore like guns or fists for Confrontation Clause purposes,\r\nor whether rape and armed robbery are more like murder\r\nor domestic violence.\r\n   It can be said, of course, that under Crawford analysis\r\nof whether a statement is testimonial requires considera\r\ntion of all the circumstances, and so is also something of a\r\nmultifactor balancing test. But the “reliability” test does\r\nnot replace that analysis; it supplements it. As I under\r\nstand the Court’s opinion, even when it is determined that\r\nno emergency exists (or perhaps before that determination\r\nis made) the statement would be found admissible as far\r\nas the Confrontation Clause is concerned if it is not\r\ntestimonial.\r\n   In any case, we did not disavow multifactor balancing\r\nfor reliability in Crawford out of a preference for rules\r\nover standards. We did so because it “d[id] violence to” the\r\nFramers’ design. Id., at 68. It was judges’ open-ended\r\ndetermination of what was reliable that violated the trial\r\nrights of Englishmen in the political trials of the 16th and\r\n17th centuries. See, e.g., Throckmorton’s Case, 1 How. St.\r\nTr. 869, 875–876 (1554); Raleigh’s Case, 2 How. St. Tr., at\r\n15–16, 24. The Framers placed the Confrontation Clause\r\nin the Bill of Rights to ensure that those abuses (and the\r\nabuses by the Admiralty courts in colonial America) would\r\nnot be repeated in this country. Not even the least dan\r\ngerous branch can be trusted to assess the reliability of\r\nuncross-examined testimony in politically charged trials or\r\ntrials implicating threats to national security.

Today’s opinion\r\nfalls far short of living up to that obligation—short on the\r\nfacts, and short on the law.\r\n   For all I know, Bryant has received his just deserts. But\r\nhe surely has not received them pursuant to the proce\r\ndures that our Constitution requires.

Even if\r\nthe interrogators’ intent were what counts, I further\r\nagree, Covington’s statements would still be testimonial.\r\nAnte, at 8. It is most likely that “the officers viewed their\r\nencounter with Covington [as] an investigation into a past\r\ncrime with no ongoing or immediate consequences.” Ante,\r\nat 10. Today’s decision, JUSTICE SCALIA rightly notes,\r\n“creates an expansive exception to the Confrontation\r\nClause for violent crimes.” Ibid. In so doing, the decision\r\nconfounds our recent Confrontation Clause jurisprudence,\r\nante, at 12, which made it plain that “[r]eliability tells us\r\nnothing about whether a statement is testimonial,” ante,\r\nat 14 (emphasis deleted).\r\n   I would add, however, this observation. In Crawford v.\r\nWashington, 541 U. S. 36, 56, n. 6 (2004), this Court noted\r\nthat, in the law we inherited from England, there was a\r\nwell-established exception to the confrontation require\r\nment: The cloak protecting the accused against admission\r\nof out-of-court testimonial statements was removed for\r\ndying declarations. This historic exception, we recalled in\r\nGiles v. California, 554 U. S. 353, 358 (2008); see id., at\r\n361–362, 368, applied to statements made by a person\r\n2                  MICHIGAN v.

Were\r\nthe issue properly tendered here, I would take up the\r\nquestion whether the exception for dying declarations\r\nsurvives our recent Confrontation Clause decisions. The\r\nMichigan Supreme Court, however, held, as a matter of\r\nstate law, that the prosecutor had abandoned the issue.\r\nSee </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"836812\"><a href=\"/opinion/836812/people-v-bryant/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">132</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 156–157, 768 N.

BRYANT\r\n\r\n       CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MICHIGAN\r\n\r\n   No. 09–150.      Argued October 5, 2010—Decided February 28, 2011\r\nMichigan police dispatched to a gas station parking lot found Anthony\r\n Covington mortally wounded. Covington told them that he had been\r\n shot by respondent Bryant outside Bryant’s house and had then\r\n driven himself to the lot. At trial, which occurred before Crawford v.\r\n Washington, 541 U. S. 36, and Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813,\r\n were decided, the officers testified about what Covington said. Bry\r\n ant was found guilty of, inter alia, second-degree murder. Ulti\r\n mately, the Michigan Supreme Court reversed his conviction, holding\r\n that the Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause, as explained in\r\n Crawford and Davis, rendered Covington’s statements inadmissible\r\n testimonial hearsay.\r\nHeld: Covington’s identification and description of the shooter and the\r\n location of the shooting were not testimonial statements because they\r\n had a “primary purpose . . . to enable police assistance to meet an on\r\n going emergency.” Davis, 547 U. S., at 822. Therefore, their admis\r\n sion at Bryant’s trial did not violate the Confrontation Clause. Pp. 5–\r\n 32.\r\n    (a) In Crawford, this Court held that in order for testimonial evi\r\n dence to be admissible, the Sixth Amendment “demands . . . unavail\r\n ability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.” 541 U. S., at\r\n 68. Crawford did not “spell out a comprehensive definition of ‘testi\r\n monial,’ ” but it noted that testimonial evidence includes, among\r\n other things, “police interrogations.” Ibid. Thus, Sylvia Crawford’s\r\n statements during a station-house interrogation about a stabbing\r\n were testimonial, and their admission when her husband, the ac\r\n cused, had “no opportunity” for cross-examination due to spousal\r\n privilege made out a Sixth Amendment violation. In Davis and\r\n Hammon, both domestic violence cases, the Court explained that\r\n “[s]tatements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police\r\n2                         MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                                  Syllabus\r\n\r\n    interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the [in\r\n    terrogation’s] primary purpose . . . is to enable police assistance to\r\n    meet an ongoing emergency,” but they “are testimonial when the cir\r\n    cumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emer\r\n    gency, and that the [interrogation’s] primary purpose is to establish\r\n    or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecu\r\n    tion.” 547 U. S., at 822. Thus, a recording of a 911 call describing an\r\n    ongoing domestic disturbance was nontestimonial in Davis, where\r\n    the victim’s “elicited statements were necessary to be able to resolve\r\n    [the ongoing] emergency,” and the statements were not formal. Id.,\r\n    at 827. But the statements in Hammon were testimonial, where the\r\n    victim was interviewed after the event in a room separate from her\r\n    husband and “deliberately recounted, in response to police question\r\n    ing” the past events. Id., at 830. Here, the context is a nondomestic\r\n    dispute, with the “ongoing emergency” extending beyond an initial\r\n    victim to a potential threat to the responding police and the public.\r\n    This context requires additional clarification of what Davis meant by\r\n    “the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assis\r\n    tance to meet an ongoing emergency.” Id., at 822. Pp. 5–12.\r\n       (b) To make the “primary purpose” determination, the Court must\r\n    objectively evaluate the circumstances in which the encounter be\r\n    tween the individual and the police occurs and the parties’ state\r\n    ments and actions. Pp. 12–23.\r\n         (1) The primary purpose inquiry is objective. The circumstances\r\n    in which an encounter occurs—e.g., at or near a crime scene versus at\r\n    a police station, during an ongoing emergency or afterwards—are\r\n    clearly matters of objective fact. And the relevant inquiry into the\r\n    parties’ statements and actions is not the subjective or actual purpose\r\n    of the particular parties, but the purpose that reasonable partici\r\n    pants would have had, as ascertained from the parties’ statements\r\n    and actions and the circumstances in which the encounter occurred.\r\n    P. 13.\r\n         (2) The existence of an “ongoing emergency” at the time of the\r\n    encounter is among the most important circumstances informing the\r\n    interrogation’s “primary purpose.” See, e.g., Davis, 547 U. S., at 828–\r\n    830. An emergency focuses the participants not on “prov[ing] past\r\n    events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution,” id., at 822,\r\n    but on “end[ing] a threatening situation,” id., at 832. The Michigan\r\n    Supreme Court failed to appreciate that whether an emergency exists\r\n    and is ongoing is a highly context-dependent inquiry. An assessment\r\n    of whether an emergency threatening the police and public is ongoing\r\n    cannot narrowly focus on whether the threat to the first victim has\r\n    been neutralized because the threat to the first responders and public\r\n    may continue. The State Supreme Court also did not appreciate that\r\n                   Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\r\n\r\n                              Syllabus\r\n\r\nan emergency’s duration and scope may depend in part on the type of\r\nweapon involved; the court below relied on Davis and Hammon,\r\nwhere the assailants used their fists, as controlling the scope of an\r\nemergency involving a gun. A victim’s medical condition is important\r\nto the primary purpose inquiry to the extent that it sheds light on the\r\nvictim’s ability to have any purpose at all in responding to police\r\nquestions and on the likelihood that any such purpose would be a tes\r\ntimonial one. It also provides important context for first responders\r\nto judge the existence and magnitude of a continuing threat to the\r\nvictim, themselves, and the public. This does not mean that an\r\nemergency lasts the entire time that a perpetrator is on the loose, but\r\ntrial courts can determine in the first instance when an interrogation\r\ntransitions from nontestimonial to testimonial. Finally, whether an\r\nongoing emergency exists is simply one factor informing the ultimate\r\ninquiry regarding an interrogation’s “primary purpose.” Another is\r\nthe encounter’s informality. Formality suggests the absence of an\r\nemergency, but informality does not necessarily indicate the presence\r\nof an emergency or the lack of testimonial intent. The facts here—\r\nthe questioning occurred in an exposed, public area, before emer\r\ngency medical services arrived, and in a disorganized fashion—\r\ndistinguish this case from Crawford’s formal station-house interroga\r\ntion. Pp. 14–20.\r\n      (3) The statements and actions of both the declarant and interro\r\ngators also provide objective evidence of the interrogation’s primary\r\npurpose. Looking to the contents of both the questions and the an\r\nswers ameliorates problems that could arise from looking solely to\r\none participant, since both interrogators and declarants may have\r\nmixed motives. Police officers’ dual responsibilities as both first re\r\nsponders and criminal investigators may lead them to act with differ\r\nent motives simultaneously or in quick succession. And during an\r\nongoing emergency, victims may want the threat to end, but may not\r\nenvision prosecution. Alternatively, a severely injured victim may\r\nhave no purpose at all in answering questions. Taking into account\r\nsuch injuries does not make the inquiry subjective. The inquiry still\r\nfocuses on the understanding and purpose of a reasonable victim in\r\nthe actual victim’s circumstances, which prominently include the vic\r\ntim’s physical state. Objectively ascertaining the primary purpose of\r\nthe interrogation by examining the statements and actions of all par\r\nticipants is also consistent with this Court’s prior holdings. E.g.,\r\nDavis, 547 U. S., at 822–823, n. 1. Pp. 20–23.\r\n   (c) Here, the circumstances of the encounter as well as the state\r\nments and actions of Covington and the police objectively indicate\r\nthat the interrogation’s “primary purpose” was “to enable police as\r\nsistance to meet an ongoing emergency,” 547 U. S., at 822. The cir\r\n4                        MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                                 Syllabus\r\n\r\n    cumstances of the interrogation involved an armed shooter, whose\r\n    motive for and location after the shooting were unknown and who\r\n    had mortally wounded Covington within a few blocks and a few min\r\n    utes of the location where police found Covington. Unlike the emer\r\n    gencies in Davis and Hammon, this dispute’s potential scope and\r\n    thus the emergency encompassed a potential threat to the police and\r\n    the public. And since this case involved a gun, the physical separa\r\n    tion that was sufficient to end the emergency in Hammon was not\r\n    necessarily sufficient to end the threat here. Informed by the circum\r\n    stances of the ongoing emergency, the Court now turns to determin\r\n    ing the “primary purpose of the interrogation” as evidenced by the\r\n    statements and actions of Covington and the police. The circum\r\n    stances of the encounter provide important context for understanding\r\n    Covington’s statements to the police. When he responded to their\r\n    questions, he was lying in a gas station parking lot bleeding from a\r\n    mortal gunshot wound, and his answers were punctuated with ques\r\n    tions about when emergency medical services would arrive. Thus,\r\n    this Court cannot say that a person in his situation would have had a\r\n    “primary purpose” “to establish or prove past events potentially rele\r\n    vant to later criminal prosecution.” Ibid. For their part, the police\r\n    responded to a call that a man had been shot. They did not know\r\n    why, where, or when the shooting had occurred; the shooter’s loca\r\n    tion; or anything else about the crime. They asked exactly the type of\r\n    questions necessary to enable them “to meet an ongoing emergency.”\r\n    Ibid. Nothing in Covington’s responses indicated to the police that\r\n    there was no emergency or that the emergency had ended. Finally,\r\n    this situation is more similar to the informal, harried 911 call in\r\n    Davis than to the structured, station-house interview in Crawford.\r\n    The officers all arrived at different times; asked, upon arrival, what\r\n    had happened; and generally did not conduct a structured interroga\r\n    tion. The informality suggests that their primary purpose was to ad\r\n    dress what they considered to be an ongoing emergency, and the cir\r\n    cumstances lacked a formality that would have alerted Covington to\r\n    or focused him on the possible future prosecutorial use of his state\r\n    ments.

A jury convicted Bryant of, inter\r\nalia, second-degree murder. 483 Mich. 132, 137, 768\r\nN. W. 2d 65, 67–68 (2009). On appeal, the Supreme Court\r\nof Michigan held that the Sixth Amendment’s Confronta\r\ntion Clause, as explained in our decisions in Crawford v.\r\nWashington, 541 U. S. 36 (2004), and Davis v. Washington,\r\n547 U. S. 813 (2006), rendered Covington’s statements\r\ninadmissible testimonial hearsay, and the court reversed\r\nBryant’s conviction. 483 Mich., at 157, 768 N. W. 2d, at\r\n79. We granted the State’s petition for a writ of certiorari\r\nto consider whether the Confrontation Clause barred the\r\nadmission at trial of Covington’s statements to the police.\r\nWe hold that the circumstances of the interaction between\r\nCovington and the police objectively indicate that the\r\n“primary purpose of the interrogation” was “to enable\r\npolice assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.” Davis,\r\n547 U. S., at 822. Therefore, Covington’s identification\r\n2                  MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nand description of the shooter and the location of the\r\nshooting were not testimonial statements, and their ad\r\nmission at Bryant’s trial did not violate the Confrontation\r\nClause. We vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of\r\nMichigan and remand.\r\n                              I\r\n  Around 3:25 a.m. on April 29, 2001, Detroit, Michigan\r\npolice officers responded to a radio dispatch indicating\r\nthat a man had been shot. At the scene, they found the\r\nvictim, Anthony Covington, lying on the ground next to his\r\ncar in a gas station parking lot. Covington had a gunshot\r\nwound to his abdomen, appeared to be in great pain, and\r\nspoke with difficulty.\r\n  The police asked him “what had happened, who had\r\nshot him, and where the shooting had occurred.” 483\r\nMich., at 143, 768 N. W. 2d, at 71. Covington stated that\r\n“Rick” shot him at around 3 a.m. Id., at 136, and n. 1, 768\r\nN. W. 2d, at 67, and n. 1. He also indicated that he had a\r\nconversation with Bryant, whom he recognized based on\r\nhis voice, through the back door of Bryant’s house. Cov\r\nington explained that when he turned to leave, he was\r\nshot through the door and then drove to the gas station,\r\nwhere police found him.\r\n  Covington’s conversation with the police ended within 5\r\nto 10 minutes when emergency medical services arrived.\r\nCovington was transported to a hospital and died within\r\nhours. The police left the gas station after speaking with\r\nCovington, called for backup, and traveled to Bryant’s\r\nhouse. They did not find Bryant there but did find blood\r\nand a bullet on the back porch and an apparent bullet hole\r\nin the back door. Police also found Covington’s wallet and\r\nidentification outside the house.\r\n  At trial, which occurred prior to our decisions in Craw\r\nford, 541 U. S. 36, and Davis, 547 U.

The jury re\r\nturned a guilty verdict on charges of second-degree\r\nmurder, being a felon in possession of a firearm, and pos\r\nsession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.\r\n   Bryant appealed, and the Michigan Court of Appeals\r\naffirmed his conviction. No. 247039, 2004 WL 1882661\r\n(Aug. 24, 2004) (per curiam). Bryant then appealed to the\r\nSupreme Court of Michigan, arguing that the trial court\r\nerred in admitting Covington’s statements to the police.\r\nThe Supreme Court of Michigan eventually remanded the\r\ncase to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of\r\nour 2006 decision in Davis. 477 Mich. 902, 722 N. W. 2d\r\n797 (2006). On remand, the Court of Appeals again af\r\nfirmed, holding that Covington’s statements were properly\r\nadmitted because they were not testimonial. No. 247039,\r\n2007 WL 675471 (Mar. 6, 2007) (per curiam). Bryant\r\nagain appealed to the Supreme Court of Michigan, which\r\nreversed his conviction. 483 Mich. 132, 768 N. W. 2d 65.\r\n   Before the Supreme Court of Michigan, Bryant argued\r\nthat Covington’s statements to the police were testimonial\r\nunder Crawford and Davis and were therefore inadmissi\r\nble. The State, on the other hand, argued that the state\r\nments were admissible as “excited utterances” under the\r\nMichigan Rules of Evidence. 483 Mich., at 142, and n. 6,\r\n768 N. W. 2d, at 70, and n. 6. There was no dispute that\r\nCovington was unavailable at trial and Bryant had no\r\nprior opportunity to cross-examine him. The court there\r\nfore assessed whether Covington’s statements to the police\r\nidentifying and describing the shooter and the time and\r\nlocation of the shooting were testimonial hearsay for\r\npurposes of the Confrontation Clause. The court con\r\ncluded that the circumstances “clearly indicate that the\r\n‘primary purpose’ of the questioning was to establish the\r\nfacts of an event that had already occurred; the ‘primary\r\npurpose’ was not to enable police assistance to meet an\r\nongoing emergency.” Id., at 143, 768 N. W. 2d, at 71. The\r\n4                      MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ncourt explained that, in its view, Covington was describing\r\npast events and as such, his “primary purpose in making\r\nthese statements to the police . . . was . . . to tell the police\r\nwho had committed the crime against him, where the\r\ncrime had been committed, and where the police could find\r\nthe criminal.” Id., at 144, 768 N. W. 2d, at 71. Noting\r\nthat the officers’ actions did not suggest that they per\r\nceived an ongoing emergency at the gas station, the court\r\nheld that there was in fact no ongoing emergency. Id., at\r\n145–147, 768 N. W. 2d, at 71–73. The court distinguished\r\nthe facts of this case from those in Davis, where we held a\r\ndeclarant’s statements in a 911 call to be nontestimonial.\r\nIt instead analogized this case to Hammon v. Indiana,\r\nwhich we decided jointly with Davis and in which we\r\nfound testimonial a declarant’s statements to police just\r\nafter an assault. See 547 U. S., at 829–832. Based on this\r\nanalysis, the Supreme Court of Michigan held that the\r\nadmission of Covington’s statements constituted prejudi\r\ncial plain error warranting reversal and ordered a new\r\ntrial. 483 Mich., at 151–153, 768 N. W. 2d, at 75–76. The\r\ncourt did not address whether, absent a Confrontation\r\nClause bar, the statements’ admission would have been\r\notherwise consistent with Michigan’s hearsay rules or due\r\nprocess.1\r\n——————\r\n  1 The Supreme Court of Michigan held that the question whether the\r\n\r\nvictim’s statements would have been admissible as “dying declarations”\r\nwas not properly before it because at the preliminary examination, the\r\nprosecution, after first invoking both the dying declaration and excited\r\nutterance hearsay exceptions, established the factual foundation only\r\nfor admission of the statements as excited utterances. The trial court\r\nruled that the statements were admissible as excited utterances and\r\ndid not address their admissibility as dying declarations. 483 Mich., at\r\n153–154, 768 N. W. 2d, at 76–77. This occurred prior to our 2004\r\ndecision in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, where we first\r\nsuggested that dying declarations, even if testimonial, might be admis\r\nsible as a historical exception to the Confrontation Clause. Id., at 56,\r\nn. 6; see also Giles v. California, 554 U. S. 353, 358–359 (2008). We\r\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                   5\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n  The majority’s opinion provoked two dissents, both of\r\nwhich would have held Covington’s statements admissible\r\nbecause they were made in circumstances indicating that\r\ntheir “primary purpose” was to assist police in addressing\r\nan ongoing emergency. Id., at 157, 768 N. W. 2d, at 79\r\n(opinion of Weaver, J.); id., at 157–158, 768 N. W. 2d, at\r\n79 (opinion of Corrigan, J.). Justice Corrigan’s dissent\r\nexplained that the time and space between “the onset of\r\nan emergency and statements about that emergency\r\nclearly must be considered in context.” Id., at 161, 768\r\nN. W. 2d, at 80. Justice Corrigan concluded that the\r\nobjective circumstances of Covington’s interaction with\r\npolice rendered this case more similar to the nontestimo\r\nnial statements in Davis than to the testimonial state\r\nments in Crawford. 483 Mich., at 164, 768 N. W. 2d,\r\nat 82.\r\n  We granted certiorari to determine whether the Con\r\nfrontation Clause barred admission of Covington’s state\r\nments. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).\r\n                             II\r\n  The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment\r\nstates: “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall\r\nenjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses\r\nagainst him.” The Fourteenth Amendment renders the\r\nClause binding on the States. Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S.\r\n400, 403 (1965). In Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56, 66\r\n(1980), we explained that the confrontation right does not\r\nbar admission of statements of an unavailable witness if\r\nthe statements “bea[r] adequate ‘indicia of reliability.’ ”\r\n\r\n——————\r\nnoted in Crawford that we “need not decide in this case whether the\r\nSixth Amendment incorporates an exception for testimonial dying\r\ndeclarations.” 541 U. S., at 56, n. 6. Because of the State’s failure to\r\npreserve its argument with regard to dying declarations, we similarly\r\nneed not decide that question here. See also post, p. __ (GINSBURG, J.,\r\ndissenting).\r\n6                   MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nWe held that reliability can be established if “the evidence\r\nfalls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception,” or if it does\r\nnot fall within such an exception, then if it bears “particu\r\nlarized guarantees of trustworthiness.” Ibid.\r\n   Nearly a quarter century later, we decided Crawford v.\r\nWashington, 541 U. S. 36. Petitioner Michael Crawford\r\nwas prosecuted for stabbing a man who had allegedly\r\nattempted to rape his wife, Sylvia. Sylvia witnessed the\r\nstabbing, and later that night, after she and her husband\r\nwere both arrested, police interrogated her about the\r\nincident. At trial, Sylvia Crawford claimed spousal privi\r\nlege and did not testify, but the State introduced a tape\r\nrecording of Sylvia’s statement to the police in an effort to\r\nprove that the stabbing was not in self-defense, as Michael\r\nCrawford claimed. The Washington Supreme Court af\r\nfirmed Crawford’s conviction because it found Sylvia’s\r\nstatement to be reliable, as required under Ohio v. Rob\r\nerts. We reversed, overruling Ohio v. Roberts. 541 U. S.,\r\nat 60–68; see also Davis, 547 U. S., at 825, n. 4.\r\n   Crawford examined the common-law history of the\r\nconfrontation right and explained that “the principal evil\r\nat which the Confrontation Clause was directed was the\r\ncivil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its\r\nuse of ex parte examinations as evidence against the ac\r\ncused.” 541 U. S., at 50. We noted that in England, pre\r\ntrial examinations of suspects and witnesses by govern\r\nment officials “were sometimes read in court in lieu of live\r\ntestimony.” Id., at 43. In light of this history, we empha\r\nsized the word “witnesses” in the Sixth Amendment, defin\r\ning it as “those who ‘bear testimony.’ ” Id., at 51 (quoting\r\n2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English\r\nLanguage (1828)). We defined “testimony” as “ ‘ [a] solemn\r\ndeclaration or affirmation made for the purpose of estab\r\nlishing or proving some fact.’ ” 541 U. S., at 51 (quoting\r\nWebster). We noted that “[a]n accuser who makes a for\r\nmal statement to government officers bears testimony in a\r\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           7\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nsense that a person who makes a casual remark to an\r\nacquaintance does not.” Ibid. We therefore limited the\r\nConfrontation Clause’s reach to testimonial statements\r\nand held that in order for testimonial evidence to be ad\r\nmissible, the Sixth Amendment “demands what the com\r\nmon law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity\r\nfor cross-examination.” Id., at 68. Although “leav[ing] for\r\nanother day any effort to spell out a comprehensive defini\r\ntion of ‘testimonial,’ ” Crawford noted that “at a minimum”\r\nit includes “prior testimony at a preliminary hearing,\r\nbefore a grand jury, or at a former trial; and . . . police\r\ninterrogations.” Ibid. Under this reasoning, we held that\r\nSylvia Crawford’s statements in the course of police ques\r\ntioning were testimonial and that their admission when\r\nMichael Crawford “had no opportunity to cross-examine\r\nher” due to spousal privilege was “sufficient to make out a\r\nviolation of the Sixth Amendment.” Ibid.\r\n   In 2006, the Court in Davis v. Washington and Hammon\r\nv. Indiana, 547 U. S. 813, took a further step to “deter\r\nmine more precisely which police interrogations produce\r\ntestimony” and therefore implicate a Confrontation Clause\r\nbar. Id., at 822. We explained that when Crawford said\r\nthat\r\n    “ ‘interrogations by law enforcement officers fall\r\n    squarely within [the] class’ of testimonial hearsay, we\r\n    had immediately in mind (for that was the case before\r\n    us) interrogations solely directed at establishing the\r\n    facts of a past crime, in order to identify (or provide\r\n    evidence to convict) the perpetrator. The product of\r\n    such interrogation, whether reduced to a writing\r\n    signed by the declarant or embedded in the memory\r\n    (and perhaps notes) of the interrogating officer, is tes\r\n    timonial.” Davis, 547 U. S., at 826.\r\nWe thus made clear in Davis that not all those questioned\r\nby the police are witnesses and not all “interrogations by\r\n8                       MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nlaw enforcement officers,” Crawford, 541 U. S., at 53, are\r\nsubject to the Confrontation Clause.2\r\n  Davis and Hammon were both domestic violence cases.\r\nIn Davis, Michelle McCottry made the statements at issue\r\nto a 911 operator during a domestic disturbance with\r\nAdrian Davis, her former boyfriend. McCottry told the\r\noperator, “ ‘He’s here jumpin’ on me again,’ ” and, “ ‘He’s\r\nusin’ his fists.’ ” 547 U. S., at 817. The operator then\r\nasked McCottry for Davis’ first and last names and middle\r\ninitial, and at that point in the conversation McCottry\r\nreported that Davis had fled in a car. Id., at 818.\r\nMcCottry did not appear at Davis’ trial, and the State\r\nintroduced the recording of her conversation with the 911\r\noperator. Id., at 819.\r\n  In Hammon, decided along with Davis, police responded\r\nto a domestic disturbance call at the home of Amy and\r\nHershel Hammon, where they found Amy alone on the\r\nfront porch. Ibid. She appeared “ ‘somewhat frightened,’ ”\r\nbut told them “ ‘nothing was the matter.’ ” Ibid. (quoting\r\nHammon v. State, 829 N. E. 2d 444, 446–447 (Ind. 2005)).\r\nShe gave the police permission to enter the house, where\r\nthey saw a gas heating unit with the glass front shattered\r\non the floor. One officer remained in the kitchen with\r\nHershel, while another officer talked to Amy in the living\r\nroom about what had happened. Hershel tried several\r\ntimes to participate in Amy’s conversation with the police\r\nand became angry when the police required him to stay\r\nseparated from Amy. 547 U. S., at 819–820. The police\r\nasked Amy to fill out and sign a battery affidavit. She\r\nwrote: “ ‘Broke our Furnace & shoved me down on the floor\r\n——————\r\n   2 We noted in Crawford that “[w]e use the term ‘interrogation’ in its\r\n\r\ncolloquial, rather than any technical legal, sense,” and that “[j]ust as\r\nvarious definitions of ‘testimonial’ exist, one can imagine various\r\ndefinitions of ‘interrogation,’ and we need not select among them in this\r\ncase.” 541 U. S., at 53, n. 4. Davis did not abandon those qualifica\r\ntions; nor do we do so here.\r\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

Tore up my van where I\r\ncouldn’t leave the house. Attacked my daughter.’ ” Id., at\r\n820. Amy did not appear at Hershel’s trial, so the police\r\nofficers who spoke with her testified as to her statements\r\nand authenticated the affidavit. Ibid. The trial court\r\nadmitted the affidavit as a present sense impression and\r\nadmitted the oral statements as excited utterances under\r\nstate hearsay rules. Ibid. The Indiana Supreme Court\r\naffirmed Hammon’s conviction, holding that Amy’s oral\r\nstatements were not testimonial and that the admission of\r\nthe affidavit, although erroneous because the affidavit was\r\ntestimonial, was harmless. Hammon v. State, 829 N. E.\r\n2d, at 458–459.\r\n  To address the facts of both cases, we expanded upon\r\nthe meaning of “testimonial” that we first employed in\r\nCrawford and discussed the concept of an ongoing emer\r\ngency. We explained:\r\n    “Statements are nontestimonial when made in the\r\n    course of police interrogation under circumstances ob\r\n    jectively indicating that the primary purpose of the\r\n    interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an\r\n    ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the\r\n    circumstances objectively indicate that there is no\r\n    such ongoing emergency, and that the primary pur\r\n    pose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past\r\n    events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecu\r\n    tion.” Davis, 547 U. S., at 822.\r\nExamining the Davis and Hammon statements in light of\r\nthose definitions, we held that the statements at issue\r\nin Davis were nontestimonial and the statements in\r\nHammon were testimonial. We distinguished the state\r\nments in Davis from the testimonial statements in Craw\r\nford on several grounds, including that the victim in Davis\r\nwas “speaking about events as they were actually happen\r\n10                       MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                           Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ning, rather than ‘describ[ing] past events,’ ” that there was\r\nan ongoing emergency, that the “elicited statements were\r\nnecessary to be able to resolve the present emergency,”\r\nand that the statements were not formal. 547 U. S., at\r\n827. In Hammon, on the other hand, we held that, “[i]t is\r\nentirely clear from the circumstances that the interroga\r\ntion was part of an investigation into possibly criminal\r\npast conduct.” Id., at 829. There was “no emergency in\r\nprogress.” Ibid. The officer questioning Amy “was not\r\nseeking to determine . . . ‘what is happening,’ but rather\r\n‘what happened.’ ” Id., at 830. It was “formal enough”\r\nthat the police interrogated Amy in a room separate from\r\nher husband where, “some time after the events described\r\nwere over,” she “deliberately recounted, in response to\r\npolice questioning, how potentially criminal past events\r\nbegan and progressed.” Ibid. Because her statements\r\n“were neither a cry for help nor the provision of informa\r\ntion enabling officers immediately to end a threatening\r\nsituation,” id., at 832, we held that they were testimonial.\r\n   Davis did not “attemp[t] to produce an exhaustive classi\r\nfication of all conceivable statements—or even all conceiv\r\nable statements in response to police interrogation—as\r\neither testimonial or nontestimonial.” Id., at 822.3 The\r\n——————\r\n  3 Davis  explained that 911 operators “may at least be agents of\r\nlaw enforcement when they conduct interrogations of 911 callers,” and\r\ntherefore “consider[ed] their acts to be acts of the police” for purposes of\r\nthe opinion. 547 U. S., at 823, n. 2. Davis explicitly reserved the\r\nquestion of “whether and when statements made to someone other than\r\nlaw enforcement personnel are ‘testimonial.’ ” Ibid. We have no need to\r\ndecide that question in this case either because Covington’s statements\r\nwere made to police officers. The dissent also claims to reserve this\r\nquestion, see post, at 3, n. 1 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), but supports one of\r\nits arguments by relying on King v. Brasier, 1 Leach 199, 200, 168 Eng.\r\nRep. 202, 202–203 (K. B. 1779), which involved statements made by a\r\nchild to her mother—a private citizen—just after the child had been\r\nsexually assaulted. See also Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 69–\r\n70 (2004) (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment) (citing King v.\r\n                      Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                     11\r\n\r\n                           Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nbasic purpose of the Confrontation Clause was to “targe[t]”\r\nthe sort of “abuses” exemplified at the notorious treason\r\ntrial of Sir Walter Raleigh. Crawford, 541 U. S., at 51.\r\nThus, the most important instances in which the Clause\r\nrestricts the introduction of out-of-court statements are\r\nthose in which state actors are involved in a formal, out-of\r\ncourt interrogation of a witness to obtain evidence for\r\ntrial.4 See id., at 43–44. Even where such an interroga\r\ntion is conducted with all good faith, introduction of the\r\nresulting statements at trial can be unfair to the accused\r\nif they are untested by cross-examination. Whether for\r\nmal or informal, out-of-court statements can evade the\r\nbasic objective of the Confrontation Clause, which is to\r\nprevent the accused from being deprived of the opportu\r\nnity to cross-examine the declarant about statements\r\ntaken for use at trial. When, as in Davis, the primary\r\npurpose of an interrogation is to respond to an “ongoing\r\nemergency,” its purpose is not to create a record for trial\r\nand thus is not within the scope of the Clause. But there\r\nmay be other circumstances, aside from ongoing emergen\r\ncies, when a statement is not procured with a primary\r\npurpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for trial\r\ntestimony. In making the primary purpose determination,\r\nstandard rules of hearsay, designed to identify some state\r\n——————\r\nBrasier for the different proposition that “out-of-court statements made\r\nby someone other than the accused and not taken under oath, unlike ex\r\nparte depositions or affidavits, were generally not considered substan\r\ntive evidence upon which a conviction could be based”).\r\n   4 Contrary to the dissent’s excited suggestion, nothing in this opinion\r\n\r\ncasts “favorable light,” post, at 11 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), on the conduct\r\nof Sir Walter Raleigh’s trial or other 16th- and 17th-century English\r\ntreason trials. The dissent is correct that such trials are “unquestiona\r\nbly infamous,” ibid., and our decision here confirms, rather than un\r\ndermines, that assessment. See also n. 17, infra. For all of the\r\nreasons discussed in JUSTICE THOMAS’ opinion concurring in the judg\r\nment, the situation presented in this case is nothing like the circum\r\nstances presented by Sir Walter Raleigh’s trial. See post, p. __.\r\n12                      MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nments as reliable, will be relevant. Where no such pri\r\nmary purpose exists, the admissibility of a statement is\r\nthe concern of state and federal rules of evidence, not the\r\nConfrontation Clause.5\r\n  Deciding this case also requires further explanation of\r\nthe “ongoing emergency” circumstance addressed in Davis.\r\nBecause Davis and Hammon arose in the domestic vio\r\nlence context, that was the situation “we had immediately\r\nin mind (for that was the case before us).” 547 U. S., at\r\n826. We now face a new context: a nondomestic dispute,\r\ninvolving a victim found in a public location, suffering\r\nfrom a fatal gunshot wound, and a perpetrator whose\r\nlocation was unknown at the time the police located the\r\nvictim. Thus, we confront for the first time circumstances\r\nin which the “ongoing emergency” discussed in Davis\r\nextends beyond an initial victim to a potential threat to\r\nthe responding police and the public at large. This new\r\ncontext requires us to provide additional clarification with\r\nregard to what Davis meant by “the primary purpose of\r\nthe interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an\r\nongoing emergency.” Id., at 822.\r\n                           III\r\n   To determine whether the “primary purpose” of an\r\ninterrogation is “to enable police assistance to meet an\r\nongoing emergency,” Davis, 547 U. S., at 822, which would\r\nrender the resulting statements nontestimonial, we objec\r\ntively evaluate the circumstances in which the encounter\r\noccurs and the statements and actions of the parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n——————\r\n   5 See Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 823–824 (2006) (explaining\r\n\r\nthe question before the Court as “whether the Confrontation Clause\r\napplies only to testimonial hearsay” and answering in the affirmative\r\nbecause “[a] limitation so clearly reflected in the text of the constitu\r\ntional provision must fairly be said to mark out not merely its ‘core,’ but\r\nits perimeter”).

W. 2d,\r\nat 70. Davis uses the word “objective” or “objectively” no\r\nfewer than eight times in describing the relevant inquiry.\r\nSee 547 U. S., at 822, 826–828, 830–831, and n. 5; see, e.g.,\r\nid., at 826 (“The question before us in Davis, then, is\r\nwhether, objectively considered, the interrogation that\r\ntook place in the course of the 911 call produced testimo\r\nnial statements”). “Objectively” also appears in the defini\r\ntions of both testimonial and nontestimonial statements\r\nthat Davis established. Id., at 822.\r\n   An objective analysis of the circumstances of an encoun\r\nter and the statements and actions of the parties to it\r\nprovides the most accurate assessment of the “primary\r\npurpose of the interrogation.” The circumstances in which\r\nan encounter occurs—e.g., at or near the scene of the crime\r\nversus at a police station, during an ongoing emergency\r\nor afterwards—are clearly matters of objective fact. The\r\nstatements and actions of the parties must also be objec\r\ntively evaluated. That is, the relevant inquiry is not the\r\nsubjective or actual purpose of the individuals involved in\r\na particular encounter, but rather the purpose that rea\r\nsonable participants would have had, as ascertained from\r\nthe individuals’ statements and actions and the circum\r\nstances in which the encounter occurred.7\r\n——————\r\n  6 Bryant suggests that Michigan is arguing for “a subjective analysis\r\nof the intent of the interrogator’s questioning.” Brief for Respondent\r\n12. We do not read Michigan’s brief to be arguing for a subjective\r\ninquiry, and any such argument would be in error. We do not under\r\nstand the dissent to disagree that the inquiry is objective.\r\n  7 This approach is consistent with our rejection of subjective inquiries\r\n\r\nin other areas of criminal law. See, e.g., Whren v. United States, 517\r\nU. S. 806, 813 (1996) (refusing to evaluate Fourth Amendment reason\r\nableness subjectively in light of the officers’ actual motivations); New\r\nYork v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649, 655–656, and n. 6 (1984) (holding that\r\nan officer’s subjective motivation is irrelevant to determining the\r\n14                      MICHIGAN v.

See Davis, 547\r\nU. S., at 828–830; Crawford, 541 U. S., at 65. The exis\r\ntence of an ongoing emergency is relevant to determining\r\nthe primary purpose of the interrogation because an\r\nemergency focuses the participants on something other\r\nthan “prov[ing] past events potentially relevant to later\r\ncriminal prosecution.”8 Davis, 547 U. S., at 822. Rather,\r\nit focuses them on “end[ing] a threatening situation.” Id.,\r\nat 832. Implicit in Davis is the idea that because the\r\nprospect of fabrication in statements given for the primary\r\npurpose of resolving that emergency is presumably signifi\r\ncantly diminished, the Confrontation Clause does not\r\nrequire such statements to be subject to the crucible of\r\ncross-examination.\r\n   This logic is not unlike that justifying the excited utter\r\nance exception in hearsay law. Statements “relating to a\r\nstartling event or condition made while the declarant was\r\nunder the stress of excitement caused by the event or\r\n—————— \r\n\r\napplicability of the public safety exception to Miranda v.

S. 291, 301–302 (1980)\r\n(holding that a police officer’s subjective intent to obtain incriminatory\r\nstatements is not relevant to determining whether an interrogation has\r\noccurred).\r\n  8 The existence of an ongoing emergency must be objectively assessed\r\n\r\nfrom the perspective of the parties to the interrogation at the time, not\r\nwith the benefit of hindsight. If the information the parties knew at\r\nthe time of the encounter would lead a reasonable person to believe\r\nthat there was an emergency, even if that belief was later proved\r\nincorrect, that is sufficient for purposes of the Confrontation Clause.\r\nThe emergency is relevant to the “primary purpose of the interrogation”\r\nbecause of the effect it has on the parties’ purpose, not because of its\r\nactual existence.\r\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

An ongoing\r\nemergency has a similar effect of focusing an individual’s\r\nattention on responding to the emergency.9\r\n   Following our precedents, the court below correctly\r\nbegan its analysis with the circumstances in which Cov\r\nington interacted with the police. 483 Mich., at 143, 768\r\n——————\r\n  9 Many other exceptions to the hearsay rules similarly rest on the\r\n\r\nbelief that certain statements are, by their nature, made for a purpose\r\nother than use in a prosecution and therefore should not be barred by\r\nhearsay prohibitions.

BRYANT\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nN. W. 2d, at 71. But in doing so, the court construed Davis\r\nto have decided more than it did and thus employed an\r\nunduly narrow understanding of “ongoing emergency” that\r\nDavis does not require.\r\n  First, the Michigan Supreme Court repeatedly and\r\nincorrectly asserted that Davis “defined” “ ‘ongoing emer\r\ngency.’ ” 483 Mich., at 147, 768 N. W. 2d, at 73; see also\r\nid., at 144, 768 N. W. 2d, at 71–72. In fact, Davis did not\r\neven define the extent of the emergency in that case. The\r\nMichigan Supreme Court erroneously read Davis as decid\r\ning that “the statements made after the defendant stopped\r\nassaulting the victim and left the premises did not occur\r\nduring an ‘ongoing emergency.’ ” 483 Mich., at 150, n. 15,\r\n768 N. W. 2d, at 75, n. 15. We explicitly explained in\r\nDavis, however, that we were asked to review only the\r\ntestimonial nature of Michelle McCottry’s initial state\r\nments during the 911 call; we therefore merely assumed\r\nthe correctness of the Washington Supreme Court’s hold\r\ning that admission of her other statements was harmless,\r\nwithout deciding whether those subsequent statements\r\nwere also made for the primary purpose of resolving an\r\nongoing emergency. 547 U. S., at 829.\r\n  Second, by assuming that Davis defined the outer\r\nbounds of “ongoing emergency,” the Michigan Supreme\r\nCourt failed to appreciate that whether an emergency\r\nexists and is ongoing is a highly context-dependent in\r\nquiry. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20.\r\nDavis and Hammon involved domestic violence, a known\r\nand identified perpetrator, and, in Hammon, a neutralized\r\nthreat. Because Davis and Hammon were domestic vio\r\nlence cases, we focused only on the threat to the victims\r\nand assessed the ongoing emergency from the perspective\r\nof whether there was a continuing threat to them. 547\r\nU. S., at 827, 829–830.\r\n  Domestic violence cases like Davis and Hammon often\r\nhave a narrower zone of potential victims than cases\r\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          17\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ninvolving threats to public safety. An assessment of\r\nwhether an emergency that threatens the police and pub\r\nlic is ongoing cannot narrowly focus on whether the threat\r\nsolely to the first victim has been neutralized because the\r\nthreat to the first responders and public may continue.\r\nSee 483 Mich., at 164, 768 N. W. 2d, at 82 (Corrigan, J.,\r\ndissenting) (examining the threat to the victim, police, and\r\nthe public); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19–\r\n20 (“An emergency posed by an unknown shooter who\r\nremains at large does not automatically abate just because\r\nthe police can provide security to his first victim”).\r\n   The Michigan Supreme Court also did not appreciate\r\nthat the duration and scope of an emergency may depend\r\nin part on the type of weapon employed. The court relied\r\non Davis and Hammon, in which the assailants used their\r\nfists, as controlling the scope of the emergency here, which\r\ninvolved the use of a gun. The problem with that reason\r\ning is clear when considered in light of the assault on Amy\r\nHammon. Hershel Hammon was armed only with his fists\r\nwhen he attacked his wife, so removing Amy to a separate\r\nroom was sufficient to end the emergency. 547 U. S., at\r\n830–832. If Hershel had been reported to be armed with a\r\ngun, however, separation by a single household wall might\r\nnot have been sufficient to end the emergency. Id., at 819.\r\n   The Michigan Supreme Court’s failure to focus on the\r\ncontext-dependent nature of our Davis decision also led it\r\nto conclude that the medical condition of a declarant is\r\nirrelevant. 483 Mich., at 149, 768 N. W. 2d, at 74 (“The\r\nCourt said nothing at all that would remotely suggest that\r\nwhether the victim was in need of medical attention was\r\nin any way relevant to whether there was an ‘ongoing\r\nemergency’ ”). But Davis and Hammon did not present\r\nmedical emergencies, despite some injuries to the victims.\r\n547 U. S., at 818, 820. Thus, we have not previously\r\nconsidered, much less ruled out, the relevance of a victim’s\r\nsevere injuries to the primary purpose inquiry.\r\n18                     MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                        Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   Taking into account the victim’s medical state does not,\r\nas the Michigan Supreme Court below thought, “rende[r]\r\nnon-testimonial” “all statements made while the police are\r\nquestioning a seriously injured complainant.” 483 Mich.,\r\nat 149, 768 N. W. 2d, at 74. The medical condition of the\r\nvictim is important to the primary purpose inquiry to the\r\nextent that it sheds light on the ability of the victim to\r\nhave any purpose at all in responding to police questions\r\nand on the likelihood that any purpose formed would\r\nnecessarily be a testimonial one. The victim’s medical\r\nstate also provides important context for first responders\r\nto judge the existence and magnitude of a continuing\r\nthreat to the victim, themselves, and the public.\r\n   As the Solicitor General’s brief observes, Brief for\r\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 20, and contrary to the\r\nMichigan Supreme Court’s claims, 483 Mich., at 147, 768\r\nN. W. 2d, at 73, none of this suggests that an emergency is\r\nongoing in every place or even just surrounding the victim\r\nfor the entire time that the perpetrator of a violent crime\r\nis on the loose. As we recognized in Davis, “a conversation\r\nwhich begins as an interrogation to determine the need for\r\nemergency assistance” can “evolve into testimonial state\r\nments.” 547 U. S., at 828 (internal quotation marks omit\r\nted). This evolution may occur if, for example, a declarant\r\nprovides police with information that makes clear that\r\nwhat appeared to be an emergency is not or is no longer an\r\nemergency or that what appeared to be a public threat is\r\nactually a private dispute. It could also occur if a perpe\r\ntrator is disarmed, surrenders, is apprehended, or, as in\r\nDavis, flees with little prospect of posing a threat to the\r\npublic. Trial courts can determine in the first instance\r\nwhen any transition from nontestimonial to testimonial\r\noccurs,10 and exclude “the portions of any statement that\r\n——————\r\n  10 Recognizing the evolutionary potential of a situation in criminal\r\n\r\nlaw is not unique to the Confrontation Clause context. We noted in\r\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

As Davis made clear, whether an ongoing\r\nemergency exists is simply one factor—albeit an important\r\nfactor—that informs the ultimate inquiry regarding the\r\n“primary purpose” of an interrogation. Another factor the\r\nMichigan Supreme Court did not sufficiently account for is\r\nthe importance of informality in an encounter between a\r\nvictim and police. Formality is not the sole touchstone of\r\nour primary purpose inquiry because, although formality\r\nsuggests the absence of an emergency and therefore an\r\nincreased likelihood that the purpose of the interrogation\r\nis to “establish or prove past events potentially relevant to\r\nlater criminal prosecution,” id., at 822, informality does\r\nnot necessarily indicate the presence of an emergency or\r\nthe lack of testimonial intent. Cf. id., at 826 (explaining\r\nthat Confrontation Clause requirements cannot “readily\r\nbe evaded” by the parties deliberately keeping the written\r\nproduct of an interrogation informal “instead of having the\r\ndeclarant sign a deposition”). The court below, however,\r\ntoo readily dismissed the informality of the circumstances\r\nin this case in a single brief footnote and in fact seems to\r\nhave suggested that the encounter in this case was formal.\r\n483 Mich., at 150, n. 16, 768 N. W. 2d, at 75, n. 16. As we\r\n——————\r\nDavis that “[j]ust as, for Fifth Amendment purposes, ‘police officers can\r\nand will distinguish almost instinctively between questions necessary\r\nto secure their own safety or the safety of the public and questions\r\ndesigned solely to elicit testimonial evidence from a suspect, . . . trial\r\ncourts will recognize the point at which, for Sixth Amendment pur\r\nposes, statements in response to interrogations become testimonial.”\r\n547 U. S., at 829 (quoting New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S., at 658–659).\r\n20                      MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nexplain further below, the questioning in this case oc\r\ncurred in an exposed, public area, prior to the arrival of\r\nemergency medical services, and in a disorganized fashion.\r\nAll of those facts make this case distinguishable from\r\nthe formal station-house interrogation in Crawford. See\r\nDavis, 547 U. S., at 827.\r\n                              C\r\n  In addition to the circumstances in which an encounter\r\noccurs, the statements and actions of both the declarant\r\nand interrogators provide objective evidence of the pri\r\nmary purpose of the interrogation. See, e.g., Davis, 547\r\nU. S., at 827 (“[T]he nature of what was asked and an\r\nswered in Davis, again viewed objectively, was such that\r\nthe elicited statements were necessary to be able to resolve\r\nthe present emergency, rather than simply to learn (as in\r\nCrawford) what had happened in the past” (first emphasis\r\nadded)). The Michigan Supreme Court did, at least\r\nbriefly, conduct this inquiry. 483 Mich., at 144–147, 768\r\nN. W. 2d, at 71–73.\r\n  As the Michigan Supreme Court correctly recognized,\r\nid., at 140, n. 5, 768 N. W. 2d, at 69, n. 5, Davis requires a\r\ncombined inquiry that accounts for both the declarant and\r\nthe interrogator.11 In many instances, the primary pur\r\n——————\r\n  11 Some  portions of Davis, however, have caused confusion about\r\nwhether the inquiry prescribes examination of one participant to the\r\nexclusion of the other. Davis’ language indicating that a statement’s\r\ntestimonial or nontestimonial nature derives from “the primary pur\r\npose of the interrogation,” 547 U. S., at 822 (emphasis added), could be\r\nread to suggest that the relevant purpose is that of the interrogator. In\r\ncontrast, footnote 1 in Davis explains, “it is in the final analysis the\r\ndeclarant’s statements, not the interrogator’s questions, that the\r\nConfrontation Clause requires us to evaluate.” Id., at 822–823, n. 1.\r\nBryant draws on the footnote to argue that the primary purpose inquiry\r\nmust be conducted solely from the perspective of the declarant, and\r\nargues against adoption of a purpose-of-the-interrogator perspective.\r\nBrief for Respondent 10–13; see also Brief for Richard D. Friedman as\r\nAmicus Curiae 5–15. But this statement in footnote 1 of Davis merely\r\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                   21\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\npose of the interrogation will be most accurately ascer\r\ntained by looking to the contents of both the questions and\r\nthe answers. To give an extreme example, if the police say\r\nto a victim, “Tell us who did this to you so that we can\r\narrest and prosecute them,” the victim’s response that\r\n“Rick did it,” appears purely accusatory because by virtue\r\nof the phrasing of the question, the victim necessarily has\r\nprosecution in mind when she answers.\r\n  The combined approach also ameliorates problems that\r\ncould arise from looking solely to one participant. Pre\r\ndominant among these is the problem of mixed motives\r\non the part of both interrogators and declarants. Police\r\nofficers in our society function as both first responders and\r\ncriminal investigators. Their dual responsibilities may\r\nmean that they act with different motives simultaneously\r\nor in quick succession. See New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S.\r\n649, 656 (1984) (“Undoubtedly most police officers [decid\r\ning whether to give Miranda warnings in a possible emer\r\ngency situation] would act out of a host of different, in\r\nstinctive, and largely unverifiable motives—their own\r\nsafety, the safety of others, and perhaps as well the desire\r\nto obtain incriminating evidence from the suspect”); see\r\nalso Davis, 547 U. S., at 839 (THOMAS, J., concurring in\r\njudgment in part and dissenting in part) (“In many, if not\r\nmost, cases where police respond to a report of a crime,\r\nwhether pursuant to a 911 call from the victim or other\r\nwise, the purposes of an interrogation, viewed from the\r\nperspective of the police, are both to respond to the emer\r\n——————\r\nacknowledges that the Confrontation Clause is not implicated when\r\nstatements are offered “for purposes other than establishing the truth\r\nof the matter asserted.” Crawford, 541 U. S., at 60, n. 9. An interroga\r\ntor’s questions, unlike a declarant’s answers, do not assert the truth of\r\nany matter. The language in the footnote was not meant to determine\r\nhow the courts are to assess the nature of the declarant’s purpose, but\r\nmerely to remind readers that it is the statements, and not the ques\r\ntions, that must be evaluated under the Sixth Amendment.\r\n22                      MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ngency situation and to gather evidence”).\r\n   Victims are also likely to have mixed motives when they\r\nmake statements to the police. During an ongoing emer\r\ngency, a victim is most likely to want the threat to her and\r\nto other potential victims to end, but that does not neces\r\nsarily mean that the victim wants or envisions prosecution\r\nof the assailant. A victim may want the attacker to be\r\nincapacitated temporarily or rehabilitated. Alternatively,\r\na severely injured victim may have no purpose at all in\r\nanswering questions posed; the answers may be simply\r\nreflexive. The victim’s injuries could be so debilitating\r\nas to prevent her from thinking sufficiently clearly to un\r\nderstand whether her statements are for the purpose of\r\naddressing an ongoing emergency or for the purpose of fu\r\nture prosecution.12 Taking into account a victim’s injuries\r\ndoes not transform this objective inquiry into a subjective\r\none. The inquiry is still objective because it focuses on the\r\nunderstanding and purpose of a reasonable victim in the\r\ncircumstances of the actual victim—circumstances that\r\nprominently include the victim’s physical state.\r\n   The dissent suggests, post, at 3–4 (opinion of SCALIA, J.),\r\nthat we intend to give controlling weight to the “intentions\r\nof the police,” post, at 4. That is a misreading of our opin\r\nion. At trial, the declarant’s statements, not the interro\r\ngator’s questions, will be introduced to “establis[h] the\r\ntruth of the matter asserted,” Crawford, 541 U. S., at 60,\r\nn. 9, and must therefore pass the Sixth Amendment test.\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  12 In such a situation, the severe injuries of the victim would un\r\n\r\ndoubtedly also weigh on the credibility and reliability that the trier of\r\nfact would afford to the statements.

In determining whether a declarant’s\r\nstatements are testimonial, courts should look to all of the\r\nrelevant circumstances. Even JUSTICE SCALIA concedes\r\nthat the interrogator is relevant to this evaluation, post,\r\nat 3, and we agree that “[t]he identity of an interrogator,\r\nand the content and tenor of his questions,” ibid., can illu\r\nminate the “primary purpose of the interrogation.” The\r\ndissent, see post, at 3–5 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), criticizes\r\nthe complexity of our approach, but we, at least, are un\r\nwilling to sacrifice accuracy for simplicity. Simpler is not\r\nalways better, and courts making a “primary purpose”\r\nassessment should not be unjustifiably restrained from\r\nconsulting all relevant information, including the state\r\nments and actions of interrogators.\r\n  Objectively ascertaining the primary purpose of the\r\ninterrogation by examining the statements and actions of\r\nall participants is also the approach most consistent with\r\nour past holdings. E.g., Davis, 547 U. S., at 822–823, n. 1\r\n(noting that “volunteered testimony” is still testimony and\r\nremains subject to the requirements of the Confrontation\r\nClause).\r\n                             IV\r\n   As we suggested in Davis, when a court must determine\r\nwhether the Confrontation Clause bars the admission of a\r\nstatement at trial, it should determine the “primary pur\r\npose of the interrogation” by objectively evaluating the\r\nstatements and actions of the parties to the encounter, in\r\nlight of the circumstances in which the interrogation\r\noccurs. The existence of an emergency or the parties’\r\nperception that an emergency is ongoing is among the\r\nmost important circumstances that courts must take into\r\naccount in determining whether an interrogation is tes\r\ntimonial because statements made to assist police in\r\naddressing an ongoing emergency presumably lack the\r\ntestimonial purpose that would subject them to the\r\n24                      MICHIGAN v.

Further complicating our\r\ntask is the fact that the trial in this case occurred before\r\nour decisions in Crawford and Davis. We therefore review\r\na record that was not developed to ascertain the “primary\r\npurpose of the interrogation.”\r\n  We first examine the circumstances in which the inter\r\nrogation occurred. The parties disagree over whether\r\nthere was an emergency when the police arrived at the gas\r\nstation. Bryant argues, and the Michigan Supreme Court\r\naccepted, 483 Mich., at 147, 768 N.

W. 2d, at 71. The joint appendix contains the\r\ntranscripts of the preliminary examination, suppression\r\nhearing, and trial testimony of five officers who responded\r\nto the scene and found Covington. The officers’ testimony\r\nis essentially consistent but, at the same time, not specific.\r\nThe officers basically agree on what information they\r\nlearned from Covington, but not on the order in which\r\nthey learned it or on whether Covington’s statements were\r\nin response to general or detailed questions. They all\r\nagree that the first question was “what happened?” The\r\nanswer was either “I was shot” or “Rick shot me.”14\r\n——————\r\n   14 See App. 76 (testimony of Officer McCallister); id., at 101, 113–114\r\n\r\n(testimony of Sgt. Wenturine); id., at 127, 131–133 (testimony of Officer\r\nStuglin). Covington told them that Rick had shot him through the back\r\ndoor of Rick’s house, id., at 127–128 (testimony of Officer Stuglin),\r\nlocated at the corner of Pennsylvania and Laura, id., at 102 (testimony\r\n26                       MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                           Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   As explained above, the scope of an emergency in terms\r\nof its threat to individuals other than the initial assailant\r\nand victim will often depend on the type of dispute in\r\nvolved. Nothing Covington said to the police indicated\r\nthat the cause of the shooting was a purely private dispute\r\nor that the threat from the shooter had ended. The record\r\nreveals little about the motive for the shooting. The police\r\nofficers who spoke with Covington at the gas station testi\r\nfied that Covington did not tell them what words Coving\r\nton and Rick had exchanged prior to the shooting.15 What\r\nCovington did tell the officers was that he fled Bryant’s\r\nback porch, indicating that he perceived an ongoing\r\nthreat.16 The police did not know, and Covington did not\r\ntell them, whether the threat was limited to him. The\r\n——————\r\nof Sgt. Wenturine), and that Covington recognized Rick by his voice, id.,\r\nat 128 (testimony of Officer Stuglin). Covington also gave them a\r\nphysical description of Rick.

Wenturine); id., at 134\r\n(testimony of Officer Stuglin).\r\n   15 See id., at 114 (“Q Did he tell you what Rick said? A He said they\r\n\r\nwere having a conversation. Q Did he tell you what Rick said? A He\r\ndid not” (testimony of Sgt. Wenturine) (paragraph breaks omitted)); see\r\nalso id., at 79 (testimony of Officer McAllister); id., at 128 (testimony of\r\nOfficer Stuglin).\r\n   16 See id., at 127–128 (“A He said he’d went up, he went up to the\r\n\r\nback door of a house; that a person he said he knew, and he was knock\r\ning and he was knocking on the door he said he’d talked to somebody\r\nthrough the door. He said he recognized the voice. Q Did he say who it\r\nwas that he recognized the voice of? A That’s when he told me it was,\r\nhe said it was Rick a/k/a Buster.

A He said what\r\nhappened was that he heard a shot and then he started to turn to get\r\noff the porch and then another one and then that’s when he was hit by\r\na gunshot” (testimony of Officer Stuglin) (paragraph breaks omitted)).\r\nUnlike the dissent’s apparent ability to read Covington’s mind, post, at\r\n6 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), we rely on the available evidence, which\r\nsuggests that Covington perceived an ongoing threat.\r\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                   27\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\npotential scope of the dispute and therefore the emergency\r\nin this case thus stretches more broadly than those at\r\nissue in Davis and Hammon and encompasses a threat\r\npotentially to the police and the public.\r\n  This is also the first of our post-Crawford Confrontation\r\nClause cases to involve a gun. The physical separation\r\nthat was sufficient to end the emergency in Hammon was\r\nnot necessarily sufficient to end the threat in this case;\r\nCovington was shot through the back door of Bryant’s\r\nhouse. Bryant’s argument that there was no ongoing\r\nemergency because “[n]o shots were being fired,” Brief for\r\nRespondent 27, surely construes ongoing emergency too\r\nnarrowly. An emergency does not last only for the time\r\nbetween when the assailant pulls the trigger and the\r\nbullet hits the victim. If an out-of-sight sniper pauses\r\nbetween shots, no one would say that the emergency\r\nceases during the pause. That is an extreme example and\r\nnot the situation here, but it serves to highlight the im\r\nplausibility, at least as to certain weapons, of construing\r\nthe emergency to last only precisely as long as the violent\r\nact itself, as some have construed our opinion in Davis.\r\nSee Brief for Respondent 23–25.\r\n  At no point during the questioning did either Covington\r\nor the police know the location of the shooter. In fact,\r\nBryant was not at home by the time the police searched\r\nhis house at approximately 5:30 a.m. 483 Mich., at 136,\r\n768 N. W. 2d, at 67. At some point between 3 a.m. and\r\n5:30 a.m., Bryant left his house. At bottom, there was an\r\nongoing emergency here where an armed shooter, whose\r\nmotive for and location after the shooting were unknown,\r\nhad mortally wounded Covington within a few blocks\r\nand a few minutes of the location where the police found\r\nCovington.17\r\n——————\r\n  17 It hardly bears mention that the emergency situation in this case is\r\n\r\nreadily distinguishable from the “treasonous conspiracies of unknown\r\n28                       MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                           Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n  This is not to suggest that the emergency continued\r\nuntil Bryant was arrested in California a year after the\r\nshooting. Id., at 137, 768 N. W. 2d, at 67. We need not\r\ndecide precisely when the emergency ended because Cov\r\nington’s encounter with the police and all of the state\r\nments he made during that interaction occurred within\r\nthe first few minutes of the police officers’ arrival and\r\nwell before they secured the scene of the shooting—the\r\nshooter’s last known location.\r\n  We reiterate, moreover, that the existence vel non of an\r\nongoing emergency is not the touchstone of the testimonial\r\ninquiry; rather, the ultimate inquiry is whether the “pri\r\nmary purpose of the interrogation [was] to enable police\r\nassistance to meet [the] ongoing emergency.” Davis, 547\r\nU. S., at 822. We turn now to that inquiry, as informed by\r\nthe circumstances of the ongoing emergency just de\r\nscribed. The circumstances of the encounter provide im\r\nportant context for understanding Covington’s statements\r\nto the police. When the police arrived at Covington’s side,\r\ntheir first question to him was “What happened?”18 Cov\r\nington’s response was either “Rick shot me” or “I was\r\nshot,” followed very quickly by an identification of “Rick”\r\n——————\r\nscope, aimed at killing or overthrowing the king,” post, at 11, about\r\nwhich JUSTICE SCALIA’s dissent is quite concerned.\r\n   18 Although the dissent claims otherwise, post, at 7 (opinion of\r\n\r\nSCALIA, J.), at least one officer asked Covington something akin to “how\r\nwas he doing.” App. 131 (testimony of Officer Stuglin) (“A I approached\r\nthe subject, the victim, Mr. Covington, on the ground and had asked\r\nsomething like what happened or are you okay, something to that\r\nline. . . . Q So you asked this man how are you, how are you doing? A\r\nWell, basically it’s, you know, what’s wrong, you know” (paragraph\r\nbreaks omitted)). The officers also testified about their assessment of\r\nCovington’s wounds. See id., at 35 (suppression hearing testimony of\r\nOfficer Brown) (“[H]e had blood . . . on the front of his body”); id., at 75\r\n(testimony of Officer McCallister) (“It appeared he had a stomach\r\nwound of a gunshot”); id., at 132 (testimony of Officer Stuglin) (“Q Did\r\nyou see the wound? A Yes, I did. Q You had to move some clothing to\r\ndo that? A Yes” (paragraph breaks omitted)).\r\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    29\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nas the shooter. App. 76. In response to further questions,\r\nCovington explained that the shooting occurred through\r\nthe back door of Bryant’s house and provided a physical\r\ndescription of the shooter. When he made the statements,\r\nCovington was lying in a gas station parking lot bleeding\r\nfrom a mortal gunshot wound to his abdomen. His an\r\nswers to the police officers’ questions were punctuated\r\nwith questions about when emergency medical services\r\nwould arrive. Id., at 56–57 (suppression hearing testi\r\nmony of Officer Brown). He was obviously in considerable\r\npain and had difficulty breathing and talking. Id., at 75,\r\n83–84 (testimony of Officer McCallister); id., at 101, 110–\r\n111 (testimony of Sgt. Wenturine); id., at 126, 137 (testi\r\nmony of Officer Stuglin). From this description of his\r\ncondition and report of his statements, we cannot say that\r\na person in Covington’s situation would have had a “pri\r\nmary purpose” “to establish or prove past events poten\r\ntially relevant to later criminal prosecution.” Davis, 547\r\nU. S., at 822.\r\n   For their part, the police responded to a call that a man\r\nhad been shot. As discussed above, they did not know\r\nwhy, where, or when the shooting had occurred. Nor did\r\nthey know the location of the shooter or anything else\r\nabout the circumstances in which the crime occurred.19\r\n——————\r\n   19 Contrary to the dissent’s suggestion, post, at 8 (opinion of SCALIA,\r\n\r\nJ.), and despite the fact that the record was developed prior to Davis’\r\nfocus on the existence of an “ongoing emergency,” the record contains\r\nsome testimony to support the idea that the police officers were con\r\ncerned about the location of the shooter when they arrived on the scene\r\nand thus to suggest that the purpose of the questioning of Covington\r\nwas to determine the shooter’s location. See App. 136 (testimony of\r\nOfficer Stuglin) (stating that upon arrival officers questioned the gas\r\nstation clerk about whether the shooting occurred in the gas station\r\nparking lot and about concern for safety); see also ibid. (testimony of\r\nOfficer Stuglin) (“Q . . . So you have some concern, there may be a\r\nperson with a gun or somebody, a shooter right there in the immediate\r\narea? A Sure, yes. Q And you want to see that that area gets secured?\r\n30                      MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nThe questions they asked—“what had happened, who had\r\nshot him, and where the shooting occurred,” 483 Mich., at\r\n143, 768 N. W. 2d, at 71—were the exact type of questions\r\nnecessary to allow the police to “ ‘assess the situation, the\r\nthreat to their own safety, and possible danger to the\r\npotential victim’ ” and to the public, Davis, 547 U. S., at\r\n832 (quoting Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Court of Nev.,\r\nHumboldt Cty., 542 U. S. 177, 186 (2004)), including to\r\nallow them to ascertain “whether they would be encoun\r\ntering a violent felon,”20 Davis, 547 U. S., at 827. In other\r\nwords, they solicited the information necessary to enable\r\nthem “to meet an ongoing emergency.” Id., at 822.\r\n  Nothing in Covington’s responses indicated to the police\r\nthat, contrary to their expectation upon responding to a\r\ncall reporting a shooting, there was no emergency or that\r\na prior emergency had ended. Covington did indicate that\r\nhe had been shot at another location about 25 minutes\r\nearlier, but he did not know the location of the shooter at\r\nthe time the police arrived and, as far as we can tell from\r\nthe record, he gave no indication that the shooter, having\r\nshot at him twice, would be satisfied that Covington was\r\nonly wounded. In fact, Covington did not indicate any\r\npossible motive for the shooting, and thereby gave no\r\nreason to think that the shooter would not shoot again if\r\nhe arrived on the scene. As we noted in Davis, “initial\r\ninquiries” may “often . . . produce nontestimonial state\r\n——————\r\nA Correct. Q For your safety as well as everyone else? A Correct”\r\n(paragraph breaks omitted)); id., at 82 (testimony of Officer McCallis\r\nter). But see id., at 83 (cross-examination of Officer McAllister) (“Q You\r\ndidn’t, you didn’t look around and say, gee, there might be a shooter\r\naround here, I better keep an eye open? A I did not, no. That could\r\nhave been my partner I don’t know” (paragraph breaks omitted)).\r\n  20 Hiibel, like our post-Crawford Confrontation Clause cases, involved\r\n\r\ndomestic violence, which explains the Court’s focus on the security of\r\nthe victim and the police: they were the only parties potentially threat\r\nened by the assailant. 542 U. S., at 186 (noting that the case involved a\r\n“domestic assault”).\r\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           31\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nments.” Id., at 832. The initial inquiries in this case\r\nresulted in the type of nontestimonial statements we\r\ncontemplated in Davis.\r\n   Finally, we consider the informality of the situation and\r\nthe interrogation. This situation is more similar, though\r\nnot identical, to the informal, harried 911 call in Davis\r\nthan to the structured, station-house interview in Craw\r\nford. As the officers’ trial testimony reflects, the situation\r\nwas fluid and somewhat confused: the officers arrived at\r\ndifferent times; apparently each, upon arrival, asked\r\nCovington “what happened?”; and, contrary to the dis\r\nsent’s portrayal, post, at 7–9 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), they\r\ndid not conduct a structured interrogation. App. 84 (tes\r\ntimony of Officer McCallister) (explaining duplicate ques\r\ntioning, especially as to “what happened?”); id., at 101–102\r\n(testimony of Sgt. Wenturine) (same); id., at 126–127\r\n(testimony of Officer Stuglin) (same). The informality\r\nsuggests that the interrogators’ primary purpose was\r\nsimply to address what they perceived to be an ongoing\r\nemergency, and the circumstances lacked any formality\r\nthat would have alerted Covington to or focused him on\r\nthe possible future prosecutorial use of his statements.\r\n   Because the circumstances of the encounter as well as\r\nthe statements and actions of Covington and the police\r\nobjectively indicate that the “primary purpose of the inter\r\nrogation” was “to enable police assistance to meet an\r\nongoing emergency,” Davis, 547 U. S., at 822, Covington’s\r\nidentification and description of the shooter and the lo\r\ncation of the shooting were not testimonial hearsay.\r\nThe Confrontation Clause did not bar their admission at\r\nBryant’s trial.\r\n\r\n                         *      *     *\r\n\r\n  For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Covington’s\r\nstatements were not testimonial and that their admission\r\n32                 MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nat Bryant’s trial did not violate the Confrontation Clause.\r\nWe leave for the Michigan courts to decide on remand\r\nwhether the statements’ admission was otherwise permit\r\nted by state hearsay rules. The judgment of the Supreme\r\nCourt of Michigan is vacated, and the case is remanded for\r\nfurther proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\n                                            It is so ordered.\r\n\r\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\r\ndecision of this case.\r\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 68 (2004).\r\n  In determining whether Covington’s statements to\r\npolice implicate the Confrontation Clause, the Court\r\nevaluates the “ ‘primary purpose’ ” of the interrogation.\r\nAnte, at 12. The majority’s analysis⎯which relies on,\r\ninter alia, what the police knew when they arrived at the\r\nscene, the specific questions they asked, the particular\r\ninformation Covington conveyed, the weapon involved,\r\nand Covington’s medical condition⎯illustrates the uncer\r\ntainty that this test creates for law enforcement and the\r\nlower courts. Ante, at 25–31. I have criticized the\r\nprimary-purpose test as “an exercise in fiction” that is\r\n“disconnected from history” and “yields no predictable\r\nresults.” Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 839, 838\r\n(2006) (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dis\r\nsenting in part).\r\n  Rather than attempting to reconstruct the “primary\r\npurpose” of the participants, I would consider the extent to\r\nwhich the interrogation resembles those historical prac\r\n2                   MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\r\n\r\ntices that the Confrontation Clause addressed. See, e.g.,\r\nid., at 835–836 (describing “practices that occurred under\r\nthe English bail and committal statutes passed during the\r\nreign of Queen Mary”). As the majority notes, Covington\r\ninteracted with the police under highly informal circum\r\nstances, while he bled from a fatal gunshot wound. Ante,\r\nat 19–20, 31. The police questioning was not “a formalized\r\ndialogue,” did not result in “formalized testimonial ma\r\nterials” such as a deposition or affidavit, and bore no “in-\r\ndicia of solemnity.” Davis, supra, at 840, 837 (opinion of\r\nTHOMAS, J.); see also Giles v. California, 554 U. S. 353,\r\n377–378 (2008) (THOMAS, J., concurring). Nor is there any\r\nindication that the statements were offered at trial “in\r\norder to evade confrontation.” Davis, supra, at 840. This\r\ninterrogation bears little if any resemblance to the histori\r\ncal practices that the Confrontation Clause aimed to elimi\r\nnate. Covington thus did not “bea[r] testimony” against\r\nBryant, Crawford, supra, at 51, and the introduction of his\r\nstatements at trial did not implicate the Confrontation\r\nClause. I concur in the judgment.\r\n                  Cite as: 562 U.

In its vain attempt\r\nto make the incredible plausible, however—or perhaps as\r\nan intended second goal—today’s opinion distorts our\r\nConfrontation Clause jurisprudence and leaves it in a\r\nshambles. Instead of clarifying the law, the Court makes\r\nitself the obfuscator of last resort.

BRYANT\r\n\r\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nthe right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against\r\nhim.” In Crawford, we held that this provision guarantees\r\na defendant his common-law right to confront those “who\r\n‘bear testimony’ ” against him. 541 U. S., at 51. A witness\r\nmust deliver his testimony against the defendant in per\r\nson, or the prosecution must prove that the witness is\r\nunavailable to appear at trial and that the defendant\r\nhas had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. Id., at\r\n53–54.\r\n    Not all hearsay falls within the Confrontation Clause’s\r\ngrasp. At trial a witness “bears testimony” by providing\r\n“ ‘[a] solemn declaration or affirmation . . . for the purpose\r\nof establishing or proving some fact.’ ” Id., at 51 (quoting 2\r\nN. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Lan\r\nguage (1828)). The Confrontation Clause protects defen\r\ndants only from hearsay statements that do the same.\r\nDavis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 823–824 (2006). In\r\nDavis, we explained how to identify testimonial hearsay\r\nprompted by police questioning in the field. A statement\r\nis testimonial “when the circumstances objectively indi\r\ncate . . . that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to\r\nestablish or prove past events potentially relevant to later\r\ncriminal prosecution.” Id., at 822. When, however, the\r\ncircumstances objectively indicate that the declarant’s\r\nstatements were “a cry for help [o]r the provision of infor\r\nmation enabling officers immediately to end a threatening\r\nsituation,” id., at 832, they bear little resemblance to in\r\ncourt testimony. “No ‘witness’ goes into court to proclaim\r\nan emergency and seek help.” Id., at 828.\r\n    Crawford and Davis did not address whose perspective\r\nmatters—the declarant’s, the interrogator’s, or both—\r\nwhen assessing “the primary purpose of [an] interroga\r\ntion.” In those cases the statements were testimonial from\r\nany perspective. I think the same is true here, but be\r\ncause the Court picks a perspective so will I: The decla\r\nrant’s intent is what counts. In-court testimony is more\r\n                   Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                 3\r\n\r\n                       SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nthan a narrative of past events; it is a solemn declaration\r\nmade in the course of a criminal trial. For an out-of-court\r\nstatement to qualify as testimonial, the declarant must\r\nintend the statement to be a solemn declaration rather\r\nthan an unconsidered or offhand remark; and he must\r\nmake the statement with the understanding that it may\r\nbe used to invoke the coercive machinery of the State\r\nagainst the accused.1 See Friedman, Grappling with the\r\nMeaning of “Testimonial,” 71 Brooklyn L. Rev. 241, 259\r\n(2005). That is what distinguishes a narrative told to a\r\nfriend over dinner from a statement to the police. See\r\nCrawford, supra, at 51. The hidden purpose of an interro\r\ngator cannot substitute for the declarant’s intentional\r\nsolemnity or his understanding of how his words may be\r\nused.\r\n   A declarant-focused inquiry is also the only inquiry that\r\nwould work in every fact pattern implicating the Confron\r\ntation Clause. The Clause applies to volunteered testi\r\nmony as well as statements solicited through police inter\r\nrogation. See Davis, supra, at 822–823, n. 1. An inquiry\r\ninto an officer’s purposes would make no sense when a\r\ndeclarant blurts out “Rick shot me” as soon as the officer\r\narrives on the scene. I see no reason to adopt a different\r\ntest—one that accounts for an officer’s intent—when the\r\nofficer asks “what happened” before the declarant makes\r\nhis accusation. (This does not mean the interrogator is\r\nirrelevant. The identity of an interrogator, and the con\r\ntent and tenor of his questions, can bear upon whether a\r\ndeclarant intends to make a solemn statement, and envi\r\nsions its use at a criminal trial. But none of this means\r\nthat the interrogator’s purpose matters.)\r\n   In an unsuccessful attempt to make its finding of emer\r\n——————\r\n  1 I remain agnostic about whether and when statements to nonstate\r\n\r\nactors are testimonial. See Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 823,\r\nn. 2 (2006).\r\n4                  MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ngency plausible, the Court instead adopts a test that looks\r\nto the purposes of both the police and the declarant. It\r\nclaims that this is demanded by necessity, fretting that a\r\ndomestic-violence victim may want her abuser briefly\r\narrested—presumably to teach him a lesson—but not\r\ndesire prosecution. See ante, at 22. I do not need to probe\r\nthe purposes of the police to solve that problem. Even if a\r\nvictim speaks to the police “to establish or prove past\r\nevents” solely for the purpose of getting her abuser ar\r\nrested, she surely knows her account is “potentially rel\r\nevant to later criminal prosecution” should one ensue.\r\nDavis, supra, at 822.\r\n   The Court also wrings its hands over the possibility that\r\n“a severely injured victim” may lack the capacity to form a\r\npurpose, and instead answer questions “reflexive[ly].”\r\nAnte, at 22. How to assess whether a declarant with\r\ndiminished capacity bore testimony is a difficult question,\r\nand one I do not need to answer today. But the Court’s\r\nproposed answer—to substitute the intentions of the police\r\nfor the missing intentions of the declarant—cannot be the\r\ncorrect one. When the declarant has diminished capacity,\r\nfocusing on the interrogators make less sense, not more.\r\nThe inquiry under Crawford turns in part on the actions\r\nand statements of a declarant’s audience only because\r\nthey shape the declarant’s perception of why his audience\r\nis listening and therefore influence his purpose in making\r\nthe declaration. See 541 U. S., at 51. But a person who\r\ncannot perceive his own purposes certainly cannot per\r\nceive why a listener might be interested in what he has to\r\nsay. As far as I can tell, the Court’s substituted-intent\r\ntheory “has nothing to be said for it except that it can\r\nsometimes make our job easier,” Jerman v. Carlisle,\r\nMcNellie, Rini, Kramer & Ulrich, L. P. A., 559 U. S. ___,\r\n___ (2010) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring\r\nin judgment) (slip op., at 2).\r\n   The Court claims one affirmative virtue for its focus on\r\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

I am at a loss to know how.\r\nSorting out the primary purpose of a declarant with mixed\r\nmotives is sometimes difficult. But adding in the mixed\r\nmotives of the police only compounds the problem. Now\r\ncourts will have to sort through two sets of mixed motives\r\nto determine the primary purpose of an interrogation.\r\nAnd the Court’s solution creates a mixed-motive problem\r\nwhere (under the proper theory) it does not exist—viz.,\r\nwhere the police and the declarant each have one motive,\r\nbut those motives conflict. The Court does not provide an\r\nanswer to this glaringly obvious problem, probably be\r\ncause it does not have one.\r\n   The only virtue of the Court’s approach (if it can be\r\nmisnamned a virtue) is that it leaves judges free to reach\r\nthe “fairest” result under the totality of the circumstances.\r\nIf the dastardly police trick a declarant into giving an\r\nincriminating statement against a sympathetic defendant,\r\na court can focus on the police’s intent and declare the\r\nstatement testimonial. If the defendant “deserves” to go to\r\njail, then a court can focus on whatever perspective is\r\nnecessary to declare damning hearsay nontestimonial.\r\nAnd when all else fails, a court can mix-and-match per\r\nspectives to reach its desired outcome. Unfortunately,\r\nunder this malleable approach “the guarantee of confron\r\ntation is no guarantee at all.” Giles v. California, 554\r\nU. S. 353, 375 (2008) (plurality).\r\n                             B\r\n  Looking to the declarant’s purpose (as we should), this is\r\nan absurdly easy case. Roughly 25 minutes after Anthony\r\nCovington had been shot, Detroit police responded to a 911\r\ncall reporting that a gunshot victim had appeared at a\r\nneighborhood gas station. They quickly arrived at the\r\nscene, and in less than 10 minutes five different Detroit\r\n6                   MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\npolice officers questioned Covington about the shooting.\r\nEach asked him a similar battery of questions: “what\r\nhappened” and when, App. 39, 126, “who shot” the victim,”\r\nid., at 22, and “where” did the shooting take place, id., at\r\n132. See also id., at 113. After Covington would answer,\r\nthey would ask follow-up questions, such as “how tall is”\r\nthe shooter, id., at 134, “[h]ow much does he weigh,” ibid.\r\nwhat is the exact address or physical description of the\r\nhouse where the shooting took place, and what chain\r\nof events led to the shooting. The battery relented when\r\nthe paramedics arrived and began tending to Covington’s\r\nwounds.\r\n   From Covington’s perspective, his statements had little\r\nvalue except to ensure the arrest and eventual prosecution\r\nof Richard Bryant. He knew the “threatening situation,”\r\nDavis, 547 U. S., at 832, had ended six blocks away and 25\r\nminutes earlier when he fled from Bryant’s back porch.\r\nSee 483 Mich. 132, 135–136, 768 N.W. 2d 65, 67 (2009);\r\nApp. 105. Bryant had not confronted him face-to-face\r\nbefore he was mortally wounded, instead shooting him\r\nthrough a door. See 483 Mich., at 136–137, 768 N.W. 2d,\r\nat 67. Even if Bryant had pursued him (unlikely), and\r\nafter seeing that Covington had ended up at the gas sta\r\ntion was unable to confront him there before the police\r\narrived (doubly unlikely), it was entirely beyond imagina\r\ntion that Bryant would again open fire while Covington\r\nwas surrounded by five armed police officers. And Coving\r\nton knew the shooting was the work of a drug dealer, not a\r\nspree killer who might randomly threaten others. Id., at\r\n135, 137, 768 N.W. 2d, at 67.\r\n   Covington’s knowledge that he had nothing to fear\r\ndiffers significantly from Michelle McCottry’s state of\r\nmind during her “frantic” statements to a 911 operator at\r\nissue in Davis, 547 U. S., at 827. Her “call was plainly a\r\ncall for help against a bona fide physical threat” describing\r\n“events as they were actually happening.” Ibid. She did\r\n                      Cite as: 562 U.

See id., at 831.\r\n   Covington’s pressing medical needs do not suggest that\r\nhe was responding to an emergency, but to the contrary\r\nreinforce the testimonial character of his statements. He\r\nunderstood the police were focused on investigating a past\r\ncrime, not his medical needs. None of the officers asked\r\nCovington how he was doing, attempted more than super\r\nficially to assess the severity of his wounds, or attempted\r\nto administer first aid.2 They instead primarily asked\r\nquestions with little, if any, relevance to Covington’s dire\r\nsituation. Police, paramedics, and doctors do not need to\r\nknow the address where a shooting took place, the name of\r\nthe shooter, or the shooter’s height and weight to provide\r\nproper medical care. Underscoring that Covington under\r\nstood the officers’ investigative role, he interrupted their\r\ninterrogation to ask “when is EMS coming?” App. 57.\r\nWhen, in other words, would the focus shift to his medical\r\nneeds rather than Bryant’s crime?\r\n   Neither Covington’s statements nor the colloquy be\r\ntween him and the officers would have been out of place at\r\na trial; it would have been a routine direct examination.\r\nSee Davis, 547 U. S., at 830. Like a witness, Covington\r\nrecounted in detail how a past criminal event began and\r\nprogressed, and like a prosecutor, the police elicited that\r\naccount through structured questioning. Preventing the\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  2 Officer Stuglin’s testimony does not undermine my assessment of\r\n\r\nthe officers’ behavior, although the Court suggests otherwise. See ante,\r\nat 28, n. 18. Officer Stuglin first testified that he “asked something like\r\nwhat happened or are you okay, something to that line.” App., 131.\r\nWhen pressed on whether he asked “how are you doing?,” he responded,\r\n“Well, basically . . . what’s wrong.” Ibid. Other officers were not so\r\nequivocal: They admitted they had no need to “ask him how he was\r\ndoing. . . . It was very obvious how he was doing.” Id., at 110; see also\r\nid., at 19.\r\n8                       MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nadmission of “weaker substitute[s] for live testimony at\r\ntrial” such as this, id., at 828 (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted), is precisely what motivated the Framers to adopt\r\nthe Confrontation Clause and what motivated our deci\r\nsions in Crawford and in Hammon v. Indiana, decided\r\nwith Davis. Ex parte examinations raise the same consti\r\ntutional concerns whether they take place in a gas-station\r\nparking lot or in a police interrogation room.\r\n                               C\r\n  Worse still for the repute of today’s opinion, this is an\r\nabsurdly easy case even if one (erroneously) takes the\r\ninterrogating officers’ purpose into account. The five\r\nofficers interrogated Covington primarily to investigate\r\npast criminal events. None—absolutely none—of their\r\nactions indicated that they perceived an imminent threat.\r\nThey did not draw their weapons, and indeed did not\r\nimmediately search the gas station for potential shooters.3\r\nTo the contrary, all five testified that they questioned\r\nCovington before conducting any investigation at the scene.\r\nWould this have made any sense if they feared the pres\r\nence of a shooter? Most tellingly, none of the officers\r\nstarted his interrogation by asking what would have been\r\nthe obvious first question if any hint of such a fear existed:\r\nWhere is the shooter?\r\n  But do not rely solely on my word about the officers’\r\nprimary purpose. Listen to Sergeant Wenturine, who\r\ncandidly admitted that he interrogated Covington because\r\nhe “ha[d] a man here that [he] believe[d] [was] dying [so\r\n——————\r\n    3 The\r\n        Court cites Officer Stuglin’s testimony that “I think [Brown and\r\nPellerito] did a little bit of both” joining the interrogation and helping\r\nto secure the scene. Id., at 135–136. But the point is not whether they\r\ndid both; it is whether they moved to secure the area first. No officer’s\r\ntestimony suggests this. Pellerito testified that he, Stuglin, and Brown\r\narrived at the scene at roughly the same time and all three immedi\r\nately went to Covington. See id., at 17–18. The testimony of Brown\r\nand McCallister corroborate that account. See id., at 34–36, 79–82.\r\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

In\r\nshort, he needed to interrogate Covington to solve a crime.\r\nWenturine never mentioned an interest in ending an\r\nongoing emergency.\r\n  At the very least, the officers’ intentions turned investi\r\ngative during their 10-minute encounter with Covington,\r\nand the conversation “evolve[d] into testimonial state\r\nments.” Davis, 547 U. S., at 828 (internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted). The fifth officer to arrive at the scene did\r\nnot need to run straight to Covington and ask a battery of\r\nquestions “to determine the need for emergency assis\r\ntance,” Ibid. He could have asked his fellow officers, who\r\npresumably had a better sense of that than Covington—\r\nand a better sense of what he could do to assist. No, the\r\nvalue of asking the same battery of questions a fifth time\r\nwas to ensure that Covington told a consistent story and\r\nto see if any new details helpful to the investigation and\r\neventual prosecution would emerge. Having the testimony\r\nof five officers to recount Covington’s consistent story\r\nundoubtedly helped obtain Bryant’s conviction. (Which\r\ncame, I may note, after the first jury could not reach a\r\nverdict. See 483 Mich., at 137, 768 N.W. 2d, at 67.)\r\n                            D\r\n   A final word about the Court’s active imagination. The\r\nCourt invents a world where an ongoing emergency exists\r\nwhenever “an armed shooter, whose motive for and lo\r\ncation after the shooting [are] unknown, . . . mortally\r\nwound[s]” one individual “within a few blocks and [25]\r\nminutes of the location where the police” ultimately find\r\nthat victim. Ante, at 27. Breathlessly, it worries that a\r\nshooter could leave the scene armed and ready to pull the\r\ntrigger again. See ante, at 17–18, 27, 30. Nothing sug\r\ngests the five officers in this case shared the Court’s\r\n10                     MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ndystopian4 view of Detroit, where drug dealers hunt their\r\nshooting victim down and fire into a crowd of police offi\r\ncers to finish him off, see ante, at 30, or where spree kill\r\ners shoot through a door and then roam the streets leaving\r\na trail of bodies behind. Because almost 90 percent of\r\nmurders involve a single victim,5 it is much more likely—\r\nindeed, I think it certain—that the officers viewed their\r\nencounter with Covington for what it was: an investi\r\ngation into a past crime with no ongoing or immediate\r\nconsequences.\r\n   The Court’s distorted view creates an expansive excep\r\ntion to the Confrontation Clause for violent crimes. Be\r\ncause Bryant posed a continuing threat to public safety in\r\nthe Court’s imagination, the emergency persisted for\r\nconfrontation purposes at least until the police learned his\r\n“motive for and location after the shooting.” Ante, at 27.\r\nIt may have persisted in this case until the police “secured\r\nthe scene of the shooting” two-and-a-half hours later.\r\nAnte, at 28. (The relevance of securing the scene is un\r\nclear so long as the killer is still at large—especially if, as\r\nthe Court speculates, he may be a spree-killer.) This is a\r\ndangerous definition of emergency. Many individuals who\r\ntestify against a defendant at trial first offer their ac\r\ncounts to police in the hours after a violent act. If the\r\npolice can plausibly claim that a “potential threat to . . .\r\nthe public” persisted through those first few hours, ante,\r\nat 12 (and if the claim is plausible here it is always plau\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  4 The opposite of utopian.

B. 1779), held inadmissible a mother’s ac\r\ncount of her young daughter’s statements “immediately on\r\nher coming home” after being sexually assaulted. The\r\ndaughter needed to testify herself. But today’s majority\r\npresumably would hold the daughter’s account to her\r\nmother a nontestimonial statement made during an ongo\r\ning emergency. She could not have known whether her\r\nattacker might reappear to attack again or attempt to\r\nsilence the lone witness against him. Her mother likely\r\nlistened to the account to assess the threat to her own\r\nsafety and to decide whether the rapist posed a threat\r\nto the community that required the immediate interven\r\ntion of the local authorities. Cf. ante, at 29–30. Utter\r\nnonsense.\r\n   The 16th- and 17th-century English treason trials that\r\nhelped inspire the Confrontation Clause show that today’s\r\ndecision is a mistake. The Court’s expansive definition of\r\nan “ongoing emergency” and its willingness to consider the\r\nperspective of the interrogator and the declarant cast a\r\nmore favorable light on those trials than history or our\r\npast decisions suggest they deserve. Royal officials con\r\nducted many of the ex parte examinations introduced\r\nagainst Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir John Fenwick while\r\ninvestigating alleged treasonous conspiracies of unknown\r\nscope, aimed at killing or overthrowing the King. See\r\nBrief for National Association of Criminal Defense Law\r\n12                 MICHIGAN v.

Stephen, A His\r\ntory of the Criminal Law of England 354 (1883), so such a\r\nconspiracy posed the most pressing emergency imaginable.\r\nPresumably, the royal officials investigating it would have\r\nunderstood the gravity of the situation and would have\r\nfocused their interrogations primarily on ending the\r\nthreat, not on generating testimony for trial. I therefore\r\ndoubt that under the Court’s test English officials acted\r\nimproperly by denying Raleigh and Fenwick the opportu\r\nnity to confront their accusers “face to face,” id., at 326.\r\n  Under my approach, in contrast, those English trials\r\nremain unquestionably infamous. Lord Cobham did not\r\nspeak with royal officials to end an ongoing emergency.\r\nHe was a traitor! He spoke, as Raleigh correctly observed,\r\nto establish Raleigh’s guilt and to save his own life. See 1\r\nD. Jardine, Criminal Trials 435 (1832). Cobham’s state\r\nments, when assessed from his perspective, had only a\r\ntestimonial purpose.

A statement during an ongoing emergency is\r\nsufficiently reliable, the Court says, “because the prospect\r\nof fabrication . . . is presumably significantly diminished,”\r\nso it “does not [need] to be subject to the crucible of cross\r\nexamination.” Id., at 14.\r\n   Compare that with the holding of Crawford: “Where\r\ntestimonial statements are at issue, the only indicium of\r\nreliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is\r\nthe one the Constitution actually prescribes: confronta\r\ntion.” 541 U. S., at 68–69. Today’s opinion adopts, for\r\nemergencies and faux emergencies at least, the discredited\r\nlogic of White v. Illinois, 502 U. S. 346, 355–356, and n. 8\r\n(1992), and Idaho v. Wright, 497 U. S. 805, 819–820\r\n(1990). White is, of course, the decision that both Craw\r\nford and Davis found most incompatible with the text and\r\nhistory of the Confrontation Clause. See Davis, supra, at\r\n825; Crawford, supra, at 58, n. 8. (This is not to say that\r\nthat “reliability” logic can actually justify today’s result:\r\nTwenty-five minutes is plenty of time for a shooting victim\r\nto reflect and fabricate a false story.)\r\n   The Court announces that in future cases it will look to\r\n“standard rules of hearsay, designed to identify some\r\nstatements as reliable,” when deciding whether a state\r\nment is testimonial. Ante, at 11–12. Ohio v. Roberts, 448\r\nU. S. 56 (1980) said something remarkably similar: An\r\nout-of-court statement is admissible if it “falls within a\r\nfirmly rooted hearsay exception” or otherwise “bears ade\r\nquate ‘indicia of reliability.’ ” Id., at 66. We tried that\r\napproach to the Confrontation Clause for nearly 25 years\r\nbefore Crawford rejected it as an unworkable standard\r\nunmoored from the text and the historical roots of the\r\nConfrontation Clause. See 541 U. S., at 54, 60, 63–65, 67–\r\n68. The arguments in Raleigh’s infamous 17th-century\r\ntreason trial contained full debate about the reliability of\r\nLord Cobham’s ex parte accusations, see Raleigh’s Case,\r\n14                  MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n2 How. St. Tr. 1, 14, 17, 19–20, 22–23, 29 (1603); that\r\ncase remains the canonical example of a Confrontation\r\nClause violation, not because Raleigh should have won the\r\ndebate but because he should have been allowed\r\ncross-examination.\r\n   The Court attempts to fit its resurrected interest in\r\nreliability into the Crawford framework, but the result is\r\nincoherent. Reliability, the Court tells us, is a good indi\r\ncator of whether “a statement is . . . an out-of-court substi\r\ntute for trial testimony.” Ante, at 11. That is patently\r\nfalse. Reliability tells us nothing about whether a state\r\nment is testimonial. Testimonial and nontestimonial\r\nstatements alike come in varying degrees of reliability.\r\nAn eyewitness’s statements to the police after a fender\r\nbender, for example, are both reliable and testimonial.\r\nStatements to the police from one driver attempting to\r\nblame the other would be similarly testimonial but rarely\r\nreliable.\r\n   The Court suggests otherwise because it “misunder\r\nstands the relationship” between qualification for one of\r\nthe standard hearsay exceptions and exemption from the\r\nconfrontation requirement. Melendez-Diaz v. Massachu\r\nsetts, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 18). That rela\r\ntionship is not a causal one. Hearsay law exempts busi\r\nness records, for example, because businesses have a\r\nfinancial incentive to keep reliable records. See Fed. Rule\r\nEvid. 803(6). The Sixth Amendment also generally admits\r\nbusiness records into evidence, but not because the records\r\nare reliable or because hearsay law says so. It admits\r\nthem “because—having been created for the administra\r\ntion of an entity’s affairs and not for the purpose of estab\r\nlishing or proving some fact at trial—they are not” weaker\r\nsubstitutes for live testimony. Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S.,\r\nat ___ (slip op., at 18). Moreover, the scope of the exemp\r\ntion from confrontation and that of the hearsay exceptions\r\nalso are not always coextensive. The reliability logic of the\r\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          15\r\n\r\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nbusiness-record exception would extend to records main\r\ntained by neutral parties providing litigation-support\r\nservices, such as evidence testing. The Confrontation\r\nClause is not so forgiving. Business records prepared\r\nspecifically for use at a criminal trial are testimonial and\r\nrequire confrontation. See ibid.\r\n  Is it possible that the Court does not recognize the\r\ncontradiction between its focus on reliable statements and\r\nCrawford’s focus on testimonial ones? Does it not realize\r\nthat the two cannot coexist? Or does it intend, by follow\r\ning today’s illogical roadmap, to resurrect Roberts by a\r\nthousand unprincipled distinctions without ever explicitly\r\noverruling Crawford? After all, honestly overruling Craw\r\nford would destroy the illusion of judicial minimalism and\r\nrestraint. And it would force the Court to explain how\r\nthe Justices’ preference comports with the meaning of the\r\nConfrontation Clause that the People adopted—or to\r\nconfess that only the Justices’ preference really matters.\r\n                              B\r\n  The Court recedes from Crawford in a second significant\r\nway. It requires judges to conduct “open-ended balancing\r\ntests” and “amorphous, if not entirely subjective,” inquir\r\nies into the totality of the circumstances bearing upon\r\nreliability. 541 U. S., at 63, 68. Where the prosecution\r\ncries “emergency,” the admissibility of a statement now\r\nturns on “a highly context-dependent inquiry,” ante, at 16,\r\ninto the type of weapon the defendant wielded, see ante, at\r\n17; the type of crime the defendant committed, see ante, at\r\n12, 16–17; the medical condition of the declarant, see ante,\r\nat 17–18; if the declarant is injured, whether paramedics\r\nhave arrived on the scene, see ante, at 20; whether the\r\nencounter takes place in an “exposed public area,” ibid.;\r\nwhether the encounter appears disorganized, see ibid.;\r\nwhether the declarant is capable of forming a purpose, see\r\nante, at 22; whether the police have secured the scene of\r\n16                 MICHIGAN v. BRYANT\r\n\r\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nthe crime, see ante, at 28; the formality of the statement,\r\nsee ante, at 19; and finally, whether the statement strikes\r\nus as reliable, see ante, at 11–12, 14–15. This is no better\r\nthan the nine-factor balancing test we rejected in Craw\r\nford, 541 U. S., at 63. I do not look forward to resolving\r\nconflicts in the future over whether knives and poison are\r\nmore like guns or fists for Confrontation Clause purposes,\r\nor whether rape and armed robbery are more like murder\r\nor domestic violence.\r\n   It can be said, of course, that under Crawford analysis\r\nof whether a statement is testimonial requires considera\r\ntion of all the circumstances, and so is also something of a\r\nmultifactor balancing test. But the “reliability” test does\r\nnot replace that analysis; it supplements it. As I under\r\nstand the Court’s opinion, even when it is determined that\r\nno emergency exists (or perhaps before that determination\r\nis made) the statement would be found admissible as far\r\nas the Confrontation Clause is concerned if it is not\r\ntestimonial.\r\n   In any case, we did not disavow multifactor balancing\r\nfor reliability in Crawford out of a preference for rules\r\nover standards. We did so because it “d[id] violence to” the\r\nFramers’ design. Id., at 68. It was judges’ open-ended\r\ndetermination of what was reliable that violated the trial\r\nrights of Englishmen in the political trials of the 16th and\r\n17th centuries. See, e.g., Throckmorton’s Case, 1 How. St.\r\nTr. 869, 875–876 (1554); Raleigh’s Case, 2 How. St. Tr., at\r\n15–16, 24. The Framers placed the Confrontation Clause\r\nin the Bill of Rights to ensure that those abuses (and the\r\nabuses by the Admiralty courts in colonial America) would\r\nnot be repeated in this country. Not even the least dan\r\ngerous branch can be trusted to assess the reliability of\r\nuncross-examined testimony in politically charged trials or\r\ntrials implicating threats to national security. See Craw\r\nford, supra, at 67–68; cf. Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S.\r\n507, 576–578 (2004) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\r\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

Even if\r\nthe interrogators’ intent were what counts, I further\r\nagree, Covington’s statements would still be testimonial.\r\nAnte, at 8. It is most likely that “the officers viewed their\r\nencounter with Covington [as] an investigation into a past\r\ncrime with no ongoing or immediate consequences.” Ante,\r\nat 10. Today’s decision, JUSTICE SCALIA rightly notes,\r\n“creates an expansive exception to the Confrontation\r\nClause for violent crimes.” Ibid. In so doing, the decision\r\nconfounds our recent Confrontation Clause jurisprudence,\r\nante, at 12, which made it plain that “[r]eliability tells us\r\nnothing about whether a statement is testimonial,” ante,\r\nat 14 (emphasis deleted).\r\n   I would add, however, this observation. In Crawford v.\r\nWashington, 541 U. S. 36, 56, n. 6 (2004), this Court noted\r\nthat, in the law we inherited from England, there was a\r\nwell-established exception to the confrontation require\r\nment: The cloak protecting the accused against admission\r\nof out-of-court testimonial statements was removed for\r\ndying declarations. This historic exception, we recalled in\r\nGiles v. California, 554 U. S. 353, 358 (2008); see id., at\r\n361–362, 368, applied to statements made by a person\r\n2                  MICHIGAN v.

Were\r\nthe issue properly tendered here, I would take up the\r\nquestion whether the exception for dying declarations\r\nsurvives our recent Confrontation Clause decisions. The\r\nMichigan Supreme Court, however, held, as a matter of\r\nstate law, that the prosecutor had abandoned the issue.\r\nSee 483 Mich. 132, 156–157, 768 N.
