Argued January 19, 2011—Decided March 1, 2011\nThe Freedom of Information Act requires federal agencies to make re\n  cords and documents publicly available upon request, subject to sev\n  eral statutory exemptions. One of those exemptions, Exemption 7(C),\n  covers law enforcement records the disclosure of which “could rea\n  sonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of per\n  sonal privacy.” 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(7)(C). CompTel, a trade associa\n  tion, submitted a FOIA request for documents AT&T had provided to\n  the Federal Communications Commission Enforcement Bureau dur\n  ing an investigation of that company. The Bureau found that Ex\n  emption 7(C) applied to individuals identified in AT&T’s submissions\n  but not to the company itself, concluding that corporations do not\n  have “personal privacy” interests as required by the exemption. The\n  FCC agreed with the Bureau, but the Court of Appeals for the Third\n  Circuit did not. It held that Exemption 7(C) extends to the “personal\n  privacy” of corporations, reasoning that “personal” is the adjective\n  form of the term “person,” which Congress has defined, as applicable\n  here, to include corporations, §551(2).\nHeld: Corporations do not have “personal privacy” for the purposes of\n Exemption 7(C). Pp. 3–12.\n    (a) AT&T argues that the word “personal” in Exemption 7(C) incor\n porates the statutory definition of “person,” which includes corpora\n tions, §551(2). But adjectives do not always reflect the meaning of\n corresponding nouns. “Person” is a defined term in the statute; “per\n sonal” is not. When a statute does not define a term, the Court typi\n cally “give[s] the phrase its ordinary meaning.” Johnson v. United\n States, 559 U. S. ___, ___. “Personal” ordinarily refers to individuals.\n People do not generally use terms such as personal characteristics or\n2                            FCC v. AT&T INC.\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    personal correspondence to describe the characteristics or correspon\n    dence of corporations. In fact, “personal” is often used to mean pre\n    cisely the opposite of business-related: We speak of personal expenses\n    and business expenses, personal life and work life, personal opinion\n    and a company’s view. Dictionary definitions also suggest that “per\n    sonal” does not ordinarily relate to artificial “persons” like corpora\n    tions.\n       AT&T contends that its reading of “personal” is supported by the\n    common legal usage of the word “person.” Yet while “person,” in a le\n    gal setting, often refers to artificial entities, AT&T’s effort to ascribe\n    a corresponding legal meaning to “personal” again elides the differ\n    ence between “person” and “personal.” AT&T provides scant support\n    for the proposition that “personal” denotes corporations, even in a le\n    gal context.\n       Regardless of whether “personal” can carry a legal meaning apart\n    from its ordinary one, statutory language should be construed “in\n    light of the terms surrounding it.” Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 9.\n    Exemption 7(C) refers not just to the word “personal,” but to the term\n    “personal privacy.” “Personal” in that phrase conveys more than just\n    “of a person”; it suggests a type of privacy evocative of human con\n    cerns—not the sort usually associated with an entity like AT&T.\n    AT&T does not cite any other instance in which a court has expressly\n    referred to a corporation’s “personal privacy.” Nor does it identify\n    any other statute that does so. While AT&T argues that this Court\n    has recognized “privacy” interests of corporations in the Fourth\n    Amendment and double jeopardy contexts, this case does not call for\n    the Court to pass on the scope of a corporation’s “privacy” interests as\n    a matter of constitutional or common law. AT&T contends that the\n    FCC has not demonstrated that the phrase “personal privacy” neces\n    sarily excludes corporations’ privacy. But construing statutory lan\n    guage is not merely an exercise in ascertaining “the outer limits of [a\n    word’s] definitional possibilities,” Dolan v. Postal Service, 546 U. S.\n    481, 486, and AT&T has provided no sound reason in the statutory\n    text or context to disregard the ordinary meaning of the phrase.\n    Pp. 3–9.\n       (b) The meaning of “personal privacy” in Exemption 7(C) is further\n    clarified by two pre-existing FOIA exemptions. Exemption 6, which\n    Congress enacted eight years before Exemption 7(C), covers “person\n    nel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would\n    constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”\n    §552(b)(6). This Court has regularly referred to Exemption 6 as in\n    volving an “individual’s right of privacy,” Department of State v. Ray,\n    502 U. S. 164, 175, and Congress used in Exemption 7(C) the same\n    phrase—“personal privacy”—used in Exemption 6. In contrast, FOIA\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  Exemption 4, which protects “trade secrets and commercial or finan\n  cial information obtained from a person and privileged or confiden\n  tial,” §552(b)(4), clearly applies to corporations. Congress did not use\n  any language similar to that in Exemption 4 in Exemption 7(C).\n  Pp. 9–11.\n582 F. 3d 490, reversed.\n\n   ROBERTS, C.

AT&T INC. ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n                                [March 1, 2011]\n\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n   The Freedom of Information Act requires federal agen\ncies to make records and documents publicly available\nupon request, unless they fall within one of several statu\ntory exemptions. One of those exemptions covers law\nenforcement records, the disclosure of which “could rea\nsonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion\nof personal privacy.” 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(7)(C). The ques\ntion presented is whether corporations have “personal\nprivacy” for the purposes of this exemption.\n                             I\n  The Freedom of Information Act request at issue in this\ncase relates to an investigation of respondent AT&T Inc.,\nconducted by the Federal Communications Commission.\nAT&T participated in an FCC-administered program—the\nE-Rate (or Education-Rate) program—that was created to\nenhance access for schools and libraries to advanced tele\ncommunications and information services. In August\n2004, AT&T voluntarily reported to the FCC that it might\n2                    FCC v. AT&T INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhave overcharged the Government for services it provided\nas part of the program.\n   The FCC’s Enforcement Bureau launched an investiga\ntion. As part of that investigation, AT&T provided the\nBureau various documents, including responses to inter\nrogatories, invoices, emails with pricing and billing infor\nmation, names and job descriptions of employees involved,\nand AT&T’s assessment of whether those employees had\nviolated the company’s code of conduct. 582 F. 3d 490,\n492–493 (CA3 2009). The FCC and AT&T resolved the\nmatter in December 2004 through a consent decree in\nwhich AT&T—without conceding liability—agreed to pay\nthe Government $500,000 and to institute a plan to ensure\ncompliance with the program. See 19 FCC Rcd. 24014,\n24016–24019.\n   Several months later, CompTel—“a trade association\nrepresenting some of AT&T’s competitors”—submitted a\nFOIA request seeking “ ‘[a]ll pleadings and correspon\ndence’ ” in the Bureau’s file on the AT&T investigation.\n582 F. 3d, at 493. AT&T opposed CompTel’s request, and\nthe Bureau issued a letter-ruling in response.\n   The Bureau concluded that some of the information\nAT&T had provided (including cost and pricing data,\nbilling-related information, and identifying information\nabout staff, contractors, and customer representatives)\nshould be protected from disclosure under FOIA Exemp\ntion 4, which relates to “trade secrets and commercial or\nfinancial information,” 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(4). App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 40a–41a. The Bureau also decided to withhold\nother information under FOIA Exemption 7(C). Exemp\ntion 7(C) exempts “records or information compiled for law\nenforcement purposes” that “could reasonably be expected\nto constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal pri\nvacy.” §552(b)(7)(C). The Bureau concluded that “indi\nviduals identified in [AT&T’s] submissions” have “privacy\nrights” that warrant protection under Exemption 7(C).\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nId., at 43a. The Bureau did not, however, apply that\nexemption to the corporation itself, reasoning that “busi\nnesses do not possess ‘personal privacy’ interests as re\nquired” by the exemption. Id., at 42a–43a.\n   On review the FCC agreed with the Bureau. The Com\nmission found AT&T’s position that it is “a ‘private corpo\nrate citizen’ with personal privacy rights that should be\nprotected from disclosure that would ‘embarrass’ it . . .\nwithin the meaning of Exemption 7(C) . . . at odds with\nestablished [FCC] and judicial precedent.” 23 FCC Rcd.\n13704, 13707 (2008). It therefore concluded that “Exemp\ntion 7(C) has no applicability to corporations such as\n[AT&T].” Id., at 13710.\n   AT&T sought review in the Court of Appeals for the\nThird Circuit, and that court rejected the FCC’s reasoning.\nNoting that Congress had defined the word “person” to\ninclude corporations as well as individuals, 5 U. S. C.\n§551(2), the court held that Exemption 7(C) extends to the\n“personal privacy” of corporations, since “the root from\nwhich the statutory word [personal] . . . is derived” is the\ndefined term “person.” 582 F. 3d, at 497. As the court\nexplained, “[i]t would be very odd indeed for an adjectival\nform of a defined term not to refer back to that defined\nterm.” Ibid. The court accordingly ruled “that FOIA’s text\nunambiguously indicates that a corporation may have a\n‘personal privacy’ interest within the meaning of Exemp\ntion 7(C).” Id., at 498.\n   The FCC petitioned this Court for review of the Third\nCircuit’s decision and CompTel filed as a respondent\nsupporting petitioners. We granted certiorari, 561 U. S.\n___ (2010), and now reverse.\n                            II\n  Like the Court of Appeals below, AT&T relies on the\nargument that the word “personal” in Exemption 7(C)\nincorporates the statutory definition of the word “person.”\n4                    FCC v. AT&T INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSee Brief for Respondent AT&T 8–9, 14–15 (AT&T Brief);\n582 F. 3d, at 497. The Administrative Procedure Act\ndefines “person” to include “an individual, partnership,\ncorporation, association, or public or private organization\nother than an agency.” 5 U. S. C. §551(2). Because that\ndefinition applies here, the argument goes, “personal”\nmust mean relating to those “person[s]”: namely, corpora\ntions and other entities as well as individuals. This read\ning, we are told, is dictated by a “basic principle of gram\nmar and usage.” AT&T Brief 8; see id., at 14–15; see also\n582 F. 3d, at 497 (citing Delaware River Stevedores v.\nDiFidelto, 440 F. 3d 615, 623 (CA3 2006) (Fisher, J., con\ncurring), for “[t]he grammatical imperativ[e]” that “a\nstatute which defines a noun has thereby defined the\nadjectival form of that noun”). According to AT&T, “[b]y\nexpressly defining the noun ‘person’ to include corpora\ntions, Congress necessarily defined the adjective form\nof that noun—‘personal’—also to include corporations.”\nAT&T Brief 14 (emphasis added).\n   We disagree. Adjectives typically reflect the meaning of\ncorresponding nouns, but not always. Sometimes they\nacquire distinct meanings of their own. The noun “crab”\nrefers variously to a crustacean and a type of apple, while\nthe related adjective “crabbed” can refer to handwriting\nthat is “difficult to read,” Webster’s Third New Interna\ntional Dictionary 527 (2002); “corny” can mean “using\nfamiliar and stereotyped formulas believed to appeal to\nthe unsophisticated,” id., at 509, which has little to do\nwith “corn,” id., at 507 (“the seeds of any of the cereal\ngrasses used for food”); and while “crank” is “a part of an\naxis bent at right angles,” “cranky” can mean “given to\nfretful fussiness,” id., at 530.\n   Even in cases such as these there may well be a link\nbetween the noun and the adjective. “Cranky” describes a\nperson with a “wayward” or “capricious” temper, see 3\nOxford English Dictionary 1117 (2d ed. 1989) (OED),\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich might bear some relation to the distorted or crooked\nangular shape from which a “crank” takes its name. That\nis not the point. What is significant is that, in ordinary\nusage, a noun and its adjective form may have meanings\nas disparate as any two unrelated words. The FCC’s\nargument that “personal” does not, in fact, derive from the\nEnglish word “person,” but instead developed along its\nown etymological path, Reply Brief for Petitioners 6, sim\nply highlights the shortcomings of AT&T’s proposed rule.\n   “Person” is a defined term in the statute; “personal” is\nnot. When a statute does not define a term, we typically\n“give the phrase its ordinary meaning.” Johnson v. United\nStates, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 4). “Personal”\nordinarily refers to individuals. We do not usually speak\nof personal characteristics, personal effects, personal\ncorrespondence, personal influence, or personal tragedy as\nreferring to corporations or other artificial entities. This is\nnot to say that corporations do not have correspondence,\ninfluence, or tragedies of their own, only that we do not\nuse the word “personal” to describe them.\n   Certainly, if the chief executive officer of a corporation\napproached the chief financial officer and said, “I have\nsomething personal to tell you,” we would not assume the\nCEO was about to discuss company business. Responding\nto a request for information, an individual might say,\n“that’s personal.” A company spokesman, when asked for\ninformation about the company, would not. In fact, we\noften use the word “personal” to mean precisely the oppo\nsite of business-related: We speak of personal expenses\nand business expenses, personal life and work life, per\nsonal opinion and a company’s view.\n   Dictionaries also suggest that “personal” does not ordi\nnarily relate to artificial “persons” such as corporations.\nSee, e.g., 7 OED 726 (1933) (“[1] [o]f, pertaining to . . . the\nindividual person or self,” “individual; private; one’s own,”\n“[3] [o]f or pertaining to one’s person, body, or figure,” “[5]\n6                     FCC v. AT&T INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n[o]f, pertaining to, or characteristic of a person or self\nconscious being, as opposed to a thing or abstraction”); 11\nOED at 599–600 (2d ed. 1989) (same); Webster’s Third\nNew International Dictionary 1686 (1976) (“[3] relating to\nthe person or body”; “[4] relating to an individual, his\ncharacter, conduct, motives, or private affairs”; “[5] relat\ning to or characteristic of human beings as distinct from\nthings”); ibid. (2002) (same).\n   AT&T dismisses these definitions, correctly noting that\n“personal”—at its most basic level—simply means “[o]f or\npertaining to a particular person.” Webster’s New Inter\nnational Dictionary 1828 (2d ed. 1954). The company\nacknowledges that “in non-legal usage, where a ‘person’ is\na human being, it is entirely unsurprising that the word\n‘personal’ is used to refer to human beings.” AT&T Brief\n8. But in a watered-down version of the “grammatical\nimperative” argument, AT&T contends that “person”—in\ncommon legal usage—is understood to include a corpora\ntion. “Personal” in the same context therefore can and\nshould have the same scope, especially here in light of the\nstatutory definition. See id., at 8–9, 16.\n   The construction of statutory language often turns on\ncontext, see, e.g., Johnson, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5),\nwhich certainly may include the definitions of related\nwords. But here the context to which AT&T points does\nnot dissuade us from the ordinary meaning of “personal.”\nWe have no doubt that “person,” in a legal setting, often\nrefers to artificial entities. The Dictionary Act makes that\nclear. 1 U. S. C. §1 (defining “person” to include “corpora\ntions, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, socie\nties, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals”).\nBut AT&T’s effort to ascribe a corresponding legal mean\ning to “personal” again elides the difference between “per\nson” and “personal.”\n   When it comes to the word “personal,” there is little\nsupport for the notion that it denotes corporations, even in\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe legal context. AT&T notes that corporations are “pro\ntected by the doctrine of ‘personal’ jurisdiction,” AT&T\nBrief 19, but that phrase refers to jurisdiction in per\nsonam, as opposed to in rem, not the jurisdiction “of a\nperson.” The only other example AT&T cites is an 1896\ncase that referred to the “ ‘personal privilege’ ” of a corpora\ntion. Ibid. (quoting Mercantile Bank v. Tennessee ex rel.\nMemphis, 161 U. S. 161, 171 (1896) (emphasis deleted)).\nThese examples fall far short of establishing that “per\nsonal” here has a legal meaning apart from its ordinary\none, even if “person” does. Cf. Merck & Co. v. Reynolds,\n559 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2010) (slip op., at 8–10) (noting\nthat “ ‘discovery’ is often used as a term of art in connec\ntion with the ‘discovery rule’ ” and describing the judicial\nand legislative codification of that meaning over time);\nMolzof v. United States, 502 U. S. 301, 306 (1992) (“ ‘Puni\ntive damages’ is a legal term of art that has a widely\naccepted common-law meaning . . . this Court’s decisions\nmake clear that the concept . . . has a long pedigree in the\nlaw”).\n   Regardless of whether “personal” can carry a special\nmeaning in legal usage, “when interpreting a statute . . .\nwe construe language . . . in light of the terms surrounding\nit.” Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 9 (2004). Exemption\n7(C) refers not just to the word “personal,” but to the term\n“personal privacy.” §552(b)(7)(C); cf. Textron Lycoming\nReciprocating Engine Div., AVCO Corp. v. Automobile\nWorkers, 523 U. S. 653, 657 (1998) (“It is not the meaning\nof ‘for’ we are seeking here, but the meaning of ‘[s]uits for\nviolation of contracts’ ”). AT&T’s effort to attribute a\nspecial legal meaning to the word “personal” in this par\nticular context is wholly unpersuasive.\n   AT&T’s argument treats the term “personal privacy” as\nsimply the sum of its two words: the privacy of a person.\nUnder that view, the defined meaning of the noun “per\nson,” or the asserted specialized legal meaning, takes on\n8                     FCC v. AT&T INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngreater significance. But two words together may assume\na more particular meaning than those words in isolation.\nWe understand a golden cup to be a cup made of or resem\nbling gold. A golden boy, on the other hand, is one who\nis charming, lucky, and talented. A golden opportunity is\none not to be missed. “Personal” in the phrase “personal\nprivacy” conveys more than just “of a person.” It suggests\na type of privacy evocative of human concerns—not the\nsort usually associated with an entity like, say, AT&T.\n   Despite its contention that “[c]ommon legal usage” of the\nword “person” supports its reading of the term “personal\nprivacy,” AT&T Brief 9, 13, 18, AT&T does not cite a\nsingle instance in which this Court or any other (aside\nfrom the Court of Appeals below) has expressly referred to\na corporation’s “personal privacy.” Nor does it identify any\nother statute that does so. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26. On the\ncontrary, treatises in print around the time that Congress\ndrafted the exemptions at hand reflect the understanding\nthat the specific concept of “personal privacy,” at least as a\nmatter of common law, did not apply to corporations. See\nRestatement (Second) of Torts §652I, Comment c (1976)\n(“A corporation, partnership or unincorporated association\nhas no personal right of privacy”); W. Prosser, Law of\nTorts §97, pp. 641–642 (2d ed. 1955) (“A corporation or a\npartnership as such can have no personal privacy, al\nthough it seems clear that it may have an exclusive right\nto its name and its business prestige” (footnotes omitted));\ncf. id., §112, at 843–844 (3d ed. 1964) (“It seems to be\ngenerally agreed that the right of privacy is one pertaining\nonly to individuals, and that a corporation or a partner\nship cannot claim it as such” (footnotes omitted)); id.,\n§117, at 815 (4th ed. 1971) (same).\n   AT&T contends that this Court has recognized “privacy”\ninterests of corporations in the Fourth Amendment and\ndouble jeopardy contexts, and that the term should be\nsimilarly construed here. See AT&T Brief 20–25. But this\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

The discrete question before us is instead\nwhether Congress used the term “personal privacy” to\nrefer to the privacy of artificial persons in FOIA Exemp\ntion 7(C); the cases AT&T cites are too far afield to be of\nhelp here.\n   AT&T concludes that the FCC has simply failed to\ndemonstrate that the phrase “personal privacy” “necessar\nily excludes the privacy of corporations.” Id., at 31–32\n(emphasis added). But construing statutory language is\nnot merely an exercise in ascertaining “the outer limits of\n[a word’s] definitional possibilities,” Dolan v. Postal Ser\nvice, 546 U. S. 481, 486 (2006). AT&T has given us no\nsound reason in the statutory text or context to disregard\nthe ordinary meaning of the phrase “personal privacy.”\n                               III\n   The meaning of “personal privacy” in Exemption 7(C) is\nfurther clarified by the rest of the statute. Congress en\nacted Exemption 7(C) against the backdrop of pre-existing\nFOIA exemptions, and the purpose and scope of Exemp\ntion 7(C) becomes even more apparent when viewed in this\ncontext. See Nken v. Holder, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop., at 6) (“statutory interpretation turns on ‘the language\nitself, the specific context in which that language is used,\nand the broader context of the statute as a whole’ ” (quot\ning Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341 (1997))).\nTwo of those other exemptions are particularly relevant\nhere.\n   The phrase “personal privacy” first appeared in the\nFOIA exemptions in Exemption 6, enacted in 1966, eight\nyears before Congress enacted Exemption 7(C). See 80\nStat. 250, codified as amended at 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(6).\nExemption 6 covers “personnel and medical files and\nsimilar files the disclosure of which would constitute\n10                    FCC v. AT&T INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\na clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”\n§552(b)(6). Not only did Congress choose the same term in\ndrafting Exemption 7(C), it also used the term in a nearly\nidentical manner.\n   Although the question whether Exemption 6 is limited\nto individuals has not come to us directly, we have regu\nlarly referred to that exemption as involving an “individ\nual’s right of privacy.” Department of State v. Ray, 502\nU. S. 164, 175 (1991) (quoting Department of Air Force v.\nRose, 425 U. S. 352, 372 (1976) (internal quotation marks\nomitted)); see also Department of State v. Washington Post\nCo., 456 U. S. 595, 599 (1982).\n   AT&T does not dispute that “identical words and\nphrases within the same statute should normally be given\nthe same meaning,” Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy\nServices, Inc., 551 U. S. 224, 232 (2007), but contends that\n“if Exemption 6 does not protect corporations, it is because\n[it] applies only to ‘personnel and medical files and similar\nfiles,’ ” not because of the term “personal privacy.” AT&T\nBrief 36 (quoting §552(b)(6)). Yet the significance of the\npertinent phrase—“the disclosure of which would consti\ntute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,”\n§552(b)(6)—cannot be so readily dismissed. Without it,\nExemption 6 would categorically exempt “personnel and\nmedical files” as well as any “similar” file. Even if the\nscope of Exemption 6 is also limited by the types of files it\nprotects, the “personal privacy” phrase importantly de\nfines the particular subset of that information Congress\nsought to exempt. See Washington Post Co., supra, at 599.\nAnd because Congress used the same phrase in Exemption\n7(C), the reach of that phrase in Exemption 6 is pertinent\nin construing Exemption 7(C).\n   In drafting Exemption 7(C), Congress did not, on the\nother hand, use language similar to that in Exemption 4.\nExemption 4 pertains to “trade secrets and commercial or\nfinancial information obtained from a person and privi\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nleged or confidential.” 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(4). This clearly\napplies to corporations—it uses the defined term “person”\nto describe the source of the information—and we far more\nreadily think of corporations as having “privileged or\nconfidential” documents than personally private ones. So\nat the time Congress enacted Exemption 7(C), it had in\nplace an exemption that plainly covered a corporation’s\ncommercial and financial information, and another that\nwe have described as relating to “individuals.” The lan\nguage of Exemption 7(C) tracks the latter.\n  The Government has long interpreted the phrase “per\nsonal privacy” in Exemption 7(C) accordingly. Shortly\nafter Congress passed the 1974 amendments that enacted\nExemption 7(C), the Attorney General issued a memoran\ndum to executive departments and agencies explaining\nthat “personal privacy” in that exemption “pertains to the\nprivacy interests of individuals.” U. S. Dept. of Justice,\nAttorney General’s Memorandum on the 1974 Amend\nments to the Freedom of Information Act 9, reprinted in\nHouse Committee on Government Operations and Senate\nCommittee on the Judiciary, Freedom of Information Act\nand Amendments of 1974 (P. L. 93–502), 94th Cong., 1st\nSess., 507, 579 (Jt. Comm. Print 1975). The exemption,\nthe Attorney General noted, “does not seem applicable to\ncorporations or other entities.” Ibid. We have previously\nviewed this Memorandum as a reliable guide in interpret\ning FOIA, see National Archives and Records Admin. v.\nFavish, 541 U. S. 157, 169 (2004); FBI v. Abramson, 456\nU. S. 615, 622, n. 5 (1982), and we agree with its conclu\nsion here.\n                       *    *    *\n  We reject the argument that because “person” is defined\nfor purposes of FOIA to include a corporation, the phrase\n“personal privacy” in Exemption 7(C) reaches corporations\nas well.

Argued January 19, 2011—Decided March 1, 2011\nThe Freedom of Information Act requires federal agencies to make re\n  cords and documents publicly available upon request, subject to sev\n  eral statutory exemptions. One of those exemptions, Exemption 7(C),\n  covers law enforcement records the disclosure of which “could rea\n  sonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of per\n  sonal privacy.” 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(7)(C). CompTel, a trade associa\n  tion, submitted a FOIA request for documents AT&T had provided to\n  the Federal Communications Commission Enforcement Bureau dur\n  ing an investigation of that company. The Bureau found that Ex\n  emption 7(C) applied to individuals identified in AT&T’s submissions\n  but not to the company itself, concluding that corporations do not\n  have “personal privacy” interests as required by the exemption. The\n  FCC agreed with the Bureau, but the Court of Appeals for the Third\n  Circuit did not. It held that Exemption 7(C) extends to the “personal\n  privacy” of corporations, reasoning that “personal” is the adjective\n  form of the term “person,” which Congress has defined, as applicable\n  here, to include corporations, §551(2).\nHeld: Corporations do not have “personal privacy” for the purposes of\n Exemption 7(C). Pp. 3–12.\n    (a) AT&T argues that the word “personal” in Exemption 7(C) incor\n porates the statutory definition of “person,” which includes corpora\n tions, §551(2). But adjectives do not always reflect the meaning of\n corresponding nouns. “Person” is a defined term in the statute; “per\n sonal” is not. When a statute does not define a term, the Court typi\n cally “give[s] the phrase its ordinary meaning.” Johnson v. United\n States, 559 U. S. ___, ___. “Personal” ordinarily refers to individuals.\n People do not generally use terms such as personal characteristics or\n2                            FCC v. AT&T INC.\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    personal correspondence to describe the characteristics or correspon\n    dence of corporations. In fact, “personal” is often used to mean pre\n    cisely the opposite of business-related: We speak of personal expenses\n    and business expenses, personal life and work life, personal opinion\n    and a company’s view. Dictionary definitions also suggest that “per\n    sonal” does not ordinarily relate to artificial “persons” like corpora\n    tions.\n       AT&T contends that its reading of “personal” is supported by the\n    common legal usage of the word “person.” Yet while “person,” in a le\n    gal setting, often refers to artificial entities, AT&T’s effort to ascribe\n    a corresponding legal meaning to “personal” again elides the differ\n    ence between “person” and “personal.” AT&T provides scant support\n    for the proposition that “personal” denotes corporations, even in a le\n    gal context.\n       Regardless of whether “personal” can carry a legal meaning apart\n    from its ordinary one, statutory language should be construed “in\n    light of the terms surrounding it.” Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 9.\n    Exemption 7(C) refers not just to the word “personal,” but to the term\n    “personal privacy.” “Personal” in that phrase conveys more than just\n    “of a person”; it suggests a type of privacy evocative of human con\n    cerns—not the sort usually associated with an entity like AT&T.\n    AT&T does not cite any other instance in which a court has expressly\n    referred to a corporation’s “personal privacy.” Nor does it identify\n    any other statute that does so. While AT&T argues that this Court\n    has recognized “privacy” interests of corporations in the Fourth\n    Amendment and double jeopardy contexts, this case does not call for\n    the Court to pass on the scope of a corporation’s “privacy” interests as\n    a matter of constitutional or common law. AT&T contends that the\n    FCC has not demonstrated that the phrase “personal privacy” neces\n    sarily excludes corporations’ privacy. But construing statutory lan\n    guage is not merely an exercise in ascertaining “the outer limits of [a\n    word’s] definitional possibilities,” Dolan v. Postal Service, 546 U. S.\n    481, 486, and AT&T has provided no sound reason in the statutory\n    text or context to disregard the ordinary meaning of the phrase.\n    Pp. 3–9.\n       (b) The meaning of “personal privacy” in Exemption 7(C) is further\n    clarified by two pre-existing FOIA exemptions. Exemption 6, which\n    Congress enacted eight years before Exemption 7(C), covers “person\n    nel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would\n    constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”\n    §552(b)(6). This Court has regularly referred to Exemption 6 as in\n    volving an “individual’s right of privacy,” Department of State v. Ray,\n    502 U. S. 164, 175, and Congress used in Exemption 7(C) the same\n    phrase—“personal privacy”—used in Exemption 6. In contrast, FOIA\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

One of those exemptions covers law\nenforcement records, the disclosure of which “could rea\nsonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion\nof personal privacy.” 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(7)(C). The ques\ntion presented is whether corporations have “personal\nprivacy” for the purposes of this exemption.\n                             I\n  The Freedom of Information Act request at issue in this\ncase relates to an investigation of respondent AT&T Inc.,\nconducted by the Federal Communications Commission.\nAT&T participated in an FCC-administered program—the\nE-Rate (or Education-Rate) program—that was created to\nenhance access for schools and libraries to advanced tele\ncommunications and information services. In August\n2004, AT&T voluntarily reported to the FCC that it might\n2                    FCC v. AT&T INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhave overcharged the Government for services it provided\nas part of the program.\n   The FCC’s Enforcement Bureau launched an investiga\ntion. As part of that investigation, AT&T provided the\nBureau various documents, including responses to inter\nrogatories, invoices, emails with pricing and billing infor\nmation, names and job descriptions of employees involved,\nand AT&T’s assessment of whether those employees had\nviolated the company’s code of conduct. 582 F. 3d 490,\n492–493 (CA3 2009). The FCC and AT&T resolved the\nmatter in December 2004 through a consent decree in\nwhich AT&T—without conceding liability—agreed to pay\nthe Government $500,000 and to institute a plan to ensure\ncompliance with the program. See 19 FCC Rcd. 24014,\n24016–24019.\n   Several months later, CompTel—“a trade association\nrepresenting some of AT&T’s competitors”—submitted a\nFOIA request seeking “ ‘[a]ll pleadings and correspon\ndence’ ” in the Bureau’s file on the AT&T investigation.\n582 F. 3d, at 493. AT&T opposed CompTel’s request, and\nthe Bureau issued a letter-ruling in response.\n   The Bureau concluded that some of the information\nAT&T had provided (including cost and pricing data,\nbilling-related information, and identifying information\nabout staff, contractors, and customer representatives)\nshould be protected from disclosure under FOIA Exemp\ntion 4, which relates to “trade secrets and commercial or\nfinancial information,” 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(4). App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 40a–41a. The Bureau also decided to withhold\nother information under FOIA Exemption 7(C). Exemp\ntion 7(C) exempts “records or information compiled for law\nenforcement purposes” that “could reasonably be expected\nto constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal pri\nvacy.” §552(b)(7)(C). The Bureau concluded that “indi\nviduals identified in [AT&T’s] submissions” have “privacy\nrights” that warrant protection under Exemption 7(C).\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nId., at 43a. The Bureau did not, however, apply that\nexemption to the corporation itself, reasoning that “busi\nnesses do not possess ‘personal privacy’ interests as re\nquired” by the exemption. Id., at 42a–43a.\n   On review the FCC agreed with the Bureau. The Com\nmission found AT&T’s position that it is “a ‘private corpo\nrate citizen’ with personal privacy rights that should be\nprotected from disclosure that would ‘embarrass’ it . . .\nwithin the meaning of Exemption 7(C) . . . at odds with\nestablished [FCC] and judicial precedent.” 23 FCC Rcd.\n13704, 13707 (2008). It therefore concluded that “Exemp\ntion 7(C) has no applicability to corporations such as\n[AT&T].” Id., at 13710.\n   AT&T sought review in the Court of Appeals for the\nThird Circuit, and that court rejected the FCC’s reasoning.\nNoting that Congress had defined the word “person” to\ninclude corporations as well as individuals, 5 U. S. C.\n§551(2), the court held that Exemption 7(C) extends to the\n“personal privacy” of corporations, since “the root from\nwhich the statutory word [personal] . . . is derived” is the\ndefined term “person.” 582 F. 3d, at 497. As the court\nexplained, “[i]t would be very odd indeed for an adjectival\nform of a defined term not to refer back to that defined\nterm.” Ibid. The court accordingly ruled “that FOIA’s text\nunambiguously indicates that a corporation may have a\n‘personal privacy’ interest within the meaning of Exemp\ntion 7(C).” Id., at 498.\n   The FCC petitioned this Court for review of the Third\nCircuit’s decision and CompTel filed as a respondent\nsupporting petitioners. We granted certiorari, 561 U. S.\n___ (2010), and now reverse.\n                            II\n  Like the Court of Appeals below, AT&T relies on the\nargument that the word “personal” in Exemption 7(C)\nincorporates the statutory definition of the word “person.”\n4                    FCC v. AT&T INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSee Brief for Respondent AT&T 8–9, 14–15 (AT&T Brief);\n582 F. 3d, at 497. The Administrative Procedure Act\ndefines “person” to include “an individual, partnership,\ncorporation, association, or public or private organization\nother than an agency.” 5 U. S. C. §551(2). Because that\ndefinition applies here, the argument goes, “personal”\nmust mean relating to those “person[s]”: namely, corpora\ntions and other entities as well as individuals. This read\ning, we are told, is dictated by a “basic principle of gram\nmar and usage.” AT&T Brief 8; see id., at 14–15; see also\n582 F. 3d, at 497 (citing Delaware River Stevedores v.\nDiFidelto, 440 F. 3d 615, 623 (CA3 2006) (Fisher, J., con\ncurring), for “[t]he grammatical imperativ[e]” that “a\nstatute which defines a noun has thereby defined the\nadjectival form of that noun”). According to AT&T, “[b]y\nexpressly defining the noun ‘person’ to include corpora\ntions, Congress necessarily defined the adjective form\nof that noun—‘personal’—also to include corporations.”\nAT&T Brief 14 (emphasis added).\n   We disagree. Adjectives typically reflect the meaning of\ncorresponding nouns, but not always. Sometimes they\nacquire distinct meanings of their own. The noun “crab”\nrefers variously to a crustacean and a type of apple, while\nthe related adjective “crabbed” can refer to handwriting\nthat is “difficult to read,” Webster’s Third New Interna\ntional Dictionary 527 (2002); “corny” can mean “using\nfamiliar and stereotyped formulas believed to appeal to\nthe unsophisticated,” id., at 509, which has little to do\nwith “corn,” id., at 507 (“the seeds of any of the cereal\ngrasses used for food”); and while “crank” is “a part of an\naxis bent at right angles,” “cranky” can mean “given to\nfretful fussiness,” id., at 530.\n   Even in cases such as these there may well be a link\nbetween the noun and the adjective. “Cranky” describes a\nperson with a “wayward” or “capricious” temper, see 3\nOxford English Dictionary 1117 (2d ed. 1989) (OED),\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich might bear some relation to the distorted or crooked\nangular shape from which a “crank” takes its name. That\nis not the point. What is significant is that, in ordinary\nusage, a noun and its adjective form may have meanings\nas disparate as any two unrelated words. The FCC’s\nargument that “personal” does not, in fact, derive from the\nEnglish word “person,” but instead developed along its\nown etymological path, Reply Brief for Petitioners 6, sim\nply highlights the shortcomings of AT&T’s proposed rule.\n   “Person” is a defined term in the statute; “personal” is\nnot. When a statute does not define a term, we typically\n“give the phrase its ordinary meaning.” Johnson v. United\nStates, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 4). “Personal”\nordinarily refers to individuals. We do not usually speak\nof personal characteristics, personal effects, personal\ncorrespondence, personal influence, or personal tragedy as\nreferring to corporations or other artificial entities. This is\nnot to say that corporations do not have correspondence,\ninfluence, or tragedies of their own, only that we do not\nuse the word “personal” to describe them.\n   Certainly, if the chief executive officer of a corporation\napproached the chief financial officer and said, “I have\nsomething personal to tell you,” we would not assume the\nCEO was about to discuss company business. Responding\nto a request for information, an individual might say,\n“that’s personal.” A company spokesman, when asked for\ninformation about the company, would not. In fact, we\noften use the word “personal” to mean precisely the oppo\nsite of business-related: We speak of personal expenses\nand business expenses, personal life and work life, per\nsonal opinion and a company’s view.\n   Dictionaries also suggest that “personal” does not ordi\nnarily relate to artificial “persons” such as corporations.\nSee, e.g., 7 OED 726 (1933) (“[1] [o]f, pertaining to . . . the\nindividual person or self,” “individual; private; one’s own,”\n“[3] [o]f or pertaining to one’s person, body, or figure,” “[5]\n6                     FCC v. AT&T INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n[o]f, pertaining to, or characteristic of a person or self\nconscious being, as opposed to a thing or abstraction”); 11\nOED at 599–600 (2d ed. 1989) (same); Webster’s Third\nNew International Dictionary 1686 (1976) (“[3] relating to\nthe person or body”; “[4] relating to an individual, his\ncharacter, conduct, motives, or private affairs”; “[5] relat\ning to or characteristic of human beings as distinct from\nthings”); ibid. (2002) (same).\n   AT&T dismisses these definitions, correctly noting that\n“personal”—at its most basic level—simply means “[o]f or\npertaining to a particular person.” Webster’s New Inter\nnational Dictionary 1828 (2d ed. 1954). The company\nacknowledges that “in non-legal usage, where a ‘person’ is\na human being, it is entirely unsurprising that the word\n‘personal’ is used to refer to human beings.” AT&T Brief\n8. But in a watered-down version of the “grammatical\nimperative” argument, AT&T contends that “person”—in\ncommon legal usage—is understood to include a corpora\ntion. “Personal” in the same context therefore can and\nshould have the same scope, especially here in light of the\nstatutory definition. See id., at 8–9, 16.\n   The construction of statutory language often turns on\ncontext, see, e.g., Johnson, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5),\nwhich certainly may include the definitions of related\nwords. But here the context to which AT&T points does\nnot dissuade us from the ordinary meaning of “personal.”\nWe have no doubt that “person,” in a legal setting, often\nrefers to artificial entities. The Dictionary Act makes that\nclear. 1 U. S. C. §1 (defining “person” to include “corpora\ntions, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, socie\nties, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals”).\nBut AT&T’s effort to ascribe a corresponding legal mean\ning to “personal” again elides the difference between “per\nson” and “personal.”\n   When it comes to the word “personal,” there is little\nsupport for the notion that it denotes corporations, even in\n                  Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe legal context. AT&T notes that corporations are “pro\ntected by the doctrine of ‘personal’ jurisdiction,” AT&T\nBrief 19, but that phrase refers to jurisdiction in per\nsonam, as opposed to in rem, not the jurisdiction “of a\nperson.” The only other example AT&T cites is an 1896\ncase that referred to the “ ‘personal privilege’ ” of a corpora\ntion. Ibid. (quoting Mercantile Bank v. Tennessee ex rel.\nMemphis, 161 U. S. 161, 171 (1896) (emphasis deleted)).\nThese examples fall far short of establishing that “per\nsonal” here has a legal meaning apart from its ordinary\none, even if “person” does. Cf. Merck & Co. v. Reynolds,\n559 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2010) (slip op., at 8–10) (noting\nthat “ ‘discovery’ is often used as a term of art in connec\ntion with the ‘discovery rule’ ” and describing the judicial\nand legislative codification of that meaning over time);\nMolzof v. United States, 502 U. S. 301, 306 (1992) (“ ‘Puni\ntive damages’ is a legal term of art that has a widely\naccepted common-law meaning . . . this Court’s decisions\nmake clear that the concept . . . has a long pedigree in the\nlaw”).\n   Regardless of whether “personal” can carry a special\nmeaning in legal usage, “when interpreting a statute . . .\nwe construe language . . . in light of the terms surrounding\nit.” Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 9 (2004). Exemption\n7(C) refers not just to the word “personal,” but to the term\n“personal privacy.” §552(b)(7)(C); cf. Textron Lycoming\nReciprocating Engine Div., AVCO Corp. v. Automobile\nWorkers, 523 U. S. 653, 657 (1998) (“It is not the meaning\nof ‘for’ we are seeking here, but the meaning of ‘[s]uits for\nviolation of contracts’ ”). AT&T’s effort to attribute a\nspecial legal meaning to the word “personal” in this par\nticular context is wholly unpersuasive.\n   AT&T’s argument treats the term “personal privacy” as\nsimply the sum of its two words: the privacy of a person.\nUnder that view, the defined meaning of the noun “per\nson,” or the asserted specialized legal meaning, takes on\n8                     FCC v. AT&T INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngreater significance. But two words together may assume\na more particular meaning than those words in isolation.\nWe understand a golden cup to be a cup made of or resem\nbling gold. A golden boy, on the other hand, is one who\nis charming, lucky, and talented. A golden opportunity is\none not to be missed. “Personal” in the phrase “personal\nprivacy” conveys more than just “of a person.” It suggests\na type of privacy evocative of human concerns—not the\nsort usually associated with an entity like, say, AT&T.\n   Despite its contention that “[c]ommon legal usage” of the\nword “person” supports its reading of the term “personal\nprivacy,” AT&T Brief 9, 13, 18, AT&T does not cite a\nsingle instance in which this Court or any other (aside\nfrom the Court of Appeals below) has expressly referred to\na corporation’s “personal privacy.” Nor does it identify any\nother statute that does so. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26. On the\ncontrary, treatises in print around the time that Congress\ndrafted the exemptions at hand reflect the understanding\nthat the specific concept of “personal privacy,” at least as a\nmatter of common law, did not apply to corporations. See\nRestatement (Second) of Torts §652I, Comment c (1976)\n(“A corporation, partnership or unincorporated association\nhas no personal right of privacy”); W. Prosser, Law of\nTorts §97, pp. 641–642 (2d ed. 1955) (“A corporation or a\npartnership as such can have no personal privacy, al\nthough it seems clear that it may have an exclusive right\nto its name and its business prestige” (footnotes omitted));\ncf. id., §112, at 843–844 (3d ed. 1964) (“It seems to be\ngenerally agreed that the right of privacy is one pertaining\nonly to individuals, and that a corporation or a partner\nship cannot claim it as such” (footnotes omitted)); id.,\n§117, at 815 (4th ed. 1971) (same).\n   AT&T contends that this Court has recognized “privacy”\ninterests of corporations in the Fourth Amendment and\ndouble jeopardy contexts, and that the term should be\nsimilarly construed here. See AT&T Brief 20–25. But this\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncase does not call upon us to pass on the scope of a corpo\nration’s “privacy” interests as a matter of constitutional or\ncommon law. The discrete question before us is instead\nwhether Congress used the term “personal privacy” to\nrefer to the privacy of artificial persons in FOIA Exemp\ntion 7(C); the cases AT&T cites are too far afield to be of\nhelp here.\n   AT&T concludes that the FCC has simply failed to\ndemonstrate that the phrase “personal privacy” “necessar\nily excludes the privacy of corporations.” Id., at 31–32\n(emphasis added). But construing statutory language is\nnot merely an exercise in ascertaining “the outer limits of\n[a word’s] definitional possibilities,” Dolan v. Postal Ser\nvice, 546 U. S. 481, 486 (2006). AT&T has given us no\nsound reason in the statutory text or context to disregard\nthe ordinary meaning of the phrase “personal privacy.”\n                               III\n   The meaning of “personal privacy” in Exemption 7(C) is\nfurther clarified by the rest of the statute. Congress en\nacted Exemption 7(C) against the backdrop of pre-existing\nFOIA exemptions, and the purpose and scope of Exemp\ntion 7(C) becomes even more apparent when viewed in this\ncontext. See Nken v. Holder, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop., at 6) (“statutory interpretation turns on ‘the language\nitself, the specific context in which that language is used,\nand the broader context of the statute as a whole’ ” (quot\ning Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341 (1997))).\nTwo of those other exemptions are particularly relevant\nhere.\n   The phrase “personal privacy” first appeared in the\nFOIA exemptions in Exemption 6, enacted in 1966, eight\nyears before Congress enacted Exemption 7(C). See 80\nStat. 250, codified as amended at 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(6).\nExemption 6 covers “personnel and medical files and\nsimilar files the disclosure of which would constitute\n10                    FCC v. AT&T INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\na clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”\n§552(b)(6). Not only did Congress choose the same term in\ndrafting Exemption 7(C), it also used the term in a nearly\nidentical manner.\n   Although the question whether Exemption 6 is limited\nto individuals has not come to us directly, we have regu\nlarly referred to that exemption as involving an “individ\nual’s right of privacy.” Department of State v. Ray, 502\nU. S. 164, 175 (1991) (quoting Department of Air Force v.\nRose, 425 U. S. 352, 372 (1976) (internal quotation marks\nomitted)); see also Department of State v. Washington Post\nCo., 456 U. S. 595, 599 (1982).\n   AT&T does not dispute that “identical words and\nphrases within the same statute should normally be given\nthe same meaning,” Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy\nServices, Inc., 551 U. S. 224, 232 (2007), but contends that\n“if Exemption 6 does not protect corporations, it is because\n[it] applies only to ‘personnel and medical files and similar\nfiles,’ ” not because of the term “personal privacy.” AT&T\nBrief 36 (quoting §552(b)(6)). Yet the significance of the\npertinent phrase—“the disclosure of which would consti\ntute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,”\n§552(b)(6)—cannot be so readily dismissed. Without it,\nExemption 6 would categorically exempt “personnel and\nmedical files” as well as any “similar” file. Even if the\nscope of Exemption 6 is also limited by the types of files it\nprotects, the “personal privacy” phrase importantly de\nfines the particular subset of that information Congress\nsought to exempt. See Washington Post Co., supra, at 599.\nAnd because Congress used the same phrase in Exemption\n7(C), the reach of that phrase in Exemption 6 is pertinent\nin construing Exemption 7(C).\n   In drafting Exemption 7(C), Congress did not, on the\nother hand, use language similar to that in Exemption 4.\nExemption 4 pertains to “trade secrets and commercial or\nfinancial information obtained from a person and privi\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nleged or confidential.” 5 U. S. C. §552(b)(4). This clearly\napplies to corporations—it uses the defined term “person”\nto describe the source of the information—and we far more\nreadily think of corporations as having “privileged or\nconfidential” documents than personally private ones. So\nat the time Congress enacted Exemption 7(C), it had in\nplace an exemption that plainly covered a corporation’s\ncommercial and financial information, and another that\nwe have described as relating to “individuals.” The lan\nguage of Exemption 7(C) tracks the latter.\n  The Government has long interpreted the phrase “per\nsonal privacy” in Exemption 7(C) accordingly. Shortly\nafter Congress passed the 1974 amendments that enacted\nExemption 7(C), the Attorney General issued a memoran\ndum to executive departments and agencies explaining\nthat “personal privacy” in that exemption “pertains to the\nprivacy interests of individuals.” U. S. Dept. of Justice,\nAttorney General’s Memorandum on the 1974 Amend\nments to the Freedom of Information Act 9, reprinted in\nHouse Committee on Government Operations and Senate\nCommittee on the Judiciary, Freedom of Information Act\nand Amendments of 1974 (P. L. 93–502), 94th Cong., 1st\nSess., 507, 579 (Jt. Comm. Print 1975). The exemption,\nthe Attorney General noted, “does not seem applicable to\ncorporations or other entities.” Ibid. We have previously\nviewed this Memorandum as a reliable guide in interpret\ning FOIA, see National Archives and Records Admin. v.\nFavish, 541 U. S. 157, 169 (2004); FBI v. Abramson, 456\nU. S. 615, 622, n. 5 (1982), and we agree with its conclu\nsion here.\n                       *    *    *\n  We reject the argument that because “person” is defined\nfor purposes of FOIA to include a corporation, the phrase\n“personal privacy” in Exemption 7(C) reaches corporations\nas well.
