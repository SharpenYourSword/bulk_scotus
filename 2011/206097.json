KHOLI\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 09–868.      Argued November 29, 2010—Decided March 7, 2011\nRespondent was convicted in Rhode Island Superior Court on 10 counts\n  of first-degree sexual assault and sentenced to consecutive life terms.\n  His conviction became final on direct review on May 29, 1996. In ad\n  dition to his direct appeal, he filed two relevant state motions. One, a\n  May 16, 1996, motion to reduce his sentence under Rhode Island Su\n  perior Court Rule of Criminal Procedure 35, was denied. The State\n  Supreme Court affirmed on January 16, 1998. The second, a state\n  postconviction relief motion, was also denied. That decision was af\n  firmed on December 14, 2006. When respondent filed his federal ha\n  beas petition, his conviction had been final for over 11 years. The\n  Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) gen\n  erally requires a federal petition to be filed within one year of the\n  date on which a judgment became final, 28 U. S. C. §2244(d)(1)(A),\n  but “a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other col\n  lateral review” tolls that period, §2244(d)(2). Respondent’s postcon\n  viction relief motion tolled the period for over nine years, but his Rule\n  35 motion must also trigger the tolling provision for his habeas peti\n  tion to be timely. The District Court dismissed the petition as un\n  timely, adopting the Magistrate Judge’s conclusion that the Rule 35\n  motion was not “a properly filed application for . . . collateral review”\n  under §2244(d)(2). The First Circuit reversed.\nHeld:\n    1. The phrase “collateral review” in §2244(d)(2) means judicial re\n view of a judgment in a proceeding that is not part of direct review.\n Pp. 4–8.\n       (a) The parties agree that the answer to the question whether a\n motion to reduce sentence is an “application for State post-conviction\n2                            WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    or other collateral review” turns on the meaning of “collateral re\n    view,” but they disagree about what that meaning should be. Pp.\n    4–5.\n          (b) Because “collateral review” is not defined in AEDPA, the\n    Court begins with the ordinary understanding of that phrase. By\n    definition, “collateral” describes something that is “indirect,” not di\n    rect. 3 Oxford English Dictionary 473. This suggests that “collat\n    eral” review is not part of direct review. This conclusion is supported\n    by the definition of the related phrase “collateral attack” and by the\n    Court’s prior use of the term “collateral” to describe proceedings that\n    are separate from the direct review process. Pp. 5–7.\n          (c) The term “review” is best understood as a “judicial reexami\n    nation.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 1944. Pp.\n    7–8.\n       2. A Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law is\n    an application for “collateral review” that triggers AEDPA’s tolling\n    provision. Pp. 8–15.\n          (a) Rhode Island’s Rule 35 is similar to the version of Federal\n    Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 in effect before the federal Sentencing\n    Reform Act of 1984. The Rule permits a court to provide relief, as\n    relevant here, to “reduce any sentence,” and it is generally addressed\n    to the sound discretion of the sentencing justice. Under the limited\n    review available, an appellate court may disturb the trial justice’s de\n    cision if the sentence imposed is without justification and is grossly\n    disparate when compared to sentences for similar offenses. Pp. 8–9.\n          (b) Keeping these principles in mind, a Rule 35 sentence reduc\n    tion proceeding is “collateral.” The parties agree that the motion is\n    not part of the direct review process, and both this Court and lower\n    federal courts have described a motion to reduce sentence under old\n    Federal Rule 35 as invoking a “collateral” remedy. Therefore, it is\n    not difficult to conclude that Rhode Island’s motion to reduce sen\n    tence is “collateral.” A Rule 35 motion also calls for “review” of the\n    sentence within §2244(d)(2)’s meaning. The decision to reduce a sen\n    tence involves judicial reexamination of the sentence to determine\n    whether a more lenient sentence is proper. The trial justice is guided\n    by several sentencing factors in making that decision. And those fac\n    tors are also used by the State Supreme Court in evaluating the trial\n    justice’s justifications for the sentence. Pp. 9–11.\n          (c) Rhode Island’s arguments in support of its opposing view that\n    “collateral review” includes only “legal” challenges to a conviction or\n    sentence, and thus excludes motions for a discretionary sentence re\n    duction, are unpersuasive. Nor does “collateral review” turn on\n    whether a motion is part of the same criminal case. Pp. 11–15.\n582 F. 3d 147, affirmed.\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

KHALIL KHOLI \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n             APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 7, 2011] \n\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (AEDPA), “a properly filed application for\nState post-conviction or other collateral review with re\nspect to the pertinent judgment or claim” tolls the 1-year\nlimitation period for filing a federal habeas petition. 28\nU. S. C. §2244(d)(2). The question in this case is whether\na motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law tolls\nthe limitation period, thereby rendering respondent Khalil\nKholi’s federal habeas petition timely. We hold that the\nphrase “collateral review” in §2244(d)(2) means judicial\nreview of a judgment in a proceeding that is not part of\ndirect review. Because the parties agree that a motion to\nreduce sentence under Rhode Island law is not part of the\ndirect review process, we hold that respondent’s motion\ntolled the AEDPA limitation period and that his federal\nhabeas petition was therefore timely.\n                         I\n                         A\n  In 1993, respondent was convicted in Rhode Island\n2                          WALL v.

Respondent raised various challenges to\nhis conviction on direct appeal, but the Supreme Court of\nRhode Island affirmed his conviction. See State v. Kholi,\n672 A. 2d 429, 431 (1996). The parties agree that respon\ndent’s conviction became final on direct review when his\ntime expired for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari in\nthis Court. Brief for Petitioner 7, n. 4; Brief for Respon\ndent 3, n. 1; 582 F. 3d 147, 150 (CA1 2009); see generally\nJimenez v. Quarterman, 555 U. S. 113, ___ (2009) (slip op.,\nat 6). That date was May 29, 1996. See this Court’s Rules\n13.1, 13.3, 30.1.\n   In addition to taking a direct appeal, respondent filed\ntwo state motions that are relevant to our decision. The\nfirst, filed on May 16, 1996, was a motion to reduce sen\ntence under Rule 35 of the Rhode Island Superior Court\nRules of Criminal Procedure.1 App. 8. In that motion,\nrespondent asked the trial court to “reconsider its prior\ndetermination” and “order that his life sentences run\nconcurrently.” State v. Kholi, 706 A. 2d 1326 (R. I. 1998)\n(order). Concluding that “the sentence imposed was ap\n——————\n   1 This Rule provides in relevant part:\n\n“The court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.

On January 16, 1998, the State Supreme Court\naffirmed and observed that the facts clearly justified the\nsentence. Id., at 1326–1327.\n  On May 23, 1997, while the Rule 35 motion was pend\ning, respondent also filed an application for state postcon\nviction relief, see R. I. Gen. Laws 10–9.1–1 et seq. (Lexis\n1997) (titled “Post Conviction Remedy”), which challenged\nhis conviction. The trial court denied this motion as well,\nand the State Supreme Court affirmed that decision on\nDecember 14, 2006. See Kholi v. Wall, 911 A. 2d 262, 263–\n264 (R. I. 2006).\n                              B\n   Respondent filed a federal habeas petition in the Dis\ntrict of Rhode Island on September 5, 2007. App. 3. By\nthat time, his conviction had been final for over 11 years.\nAEDPA generally requires a federal habeas petition to be\nfiled within one year of the date on which the judgment\nbecame final by the conclusion of direct review. 28\nU. S. C. §2244(d)(1)(A). But the 1-year limitation period is\ntolled during the pendency of “a properly filed application\nfor State post-conviction or other collateral review with\nrespect to the pertinent judgment or claim.” §2244(d)(2).\n   There is no dispute that respondent’s application for\npostconviction relief tolled the limitation period for over\nnine years—from May 23, 1997, through December 14,\n2006. 582 F. 3d, at 151. Even after subtracting that\nstretch of time from the 11-year period, however, the\nperiod between the conclusion of direct review and the\nfiling of the federal habeas petition still exceeds one year.\nThus, in order for respondent’s petition to be timely, the\nRule 35 motion to reduce sentence must also trigger the\ntolling provision.\n   Respondent’s federal habeas petition was referred to a\nMagistrate Judge for a report and recommendation, and\n4                         WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Magistrate Judge concluded that the Rule 35 motion\nwas not a “ ‘properly filed application for post-conviction or\nother collateral review’ ” under §2244(d)(2) because it was\n“a ‘plea of leniency,’ and not a motion challenging the legal\nsufficiency of his sentence.” No. CA 07–346S, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">60194</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *4 (R.

On appeal, the First Circuit re\nversed. 582 F. 3d 147.\n  The Courts of Appeals are divided over the question\nwhether a motion to reduce sentence tolls the period of\nlimitation under §2244(d)(2).2 We granted certiorari to\nanswer this question with respect to a motion to reduce\nsentence under Rhode Island law. 560 U.

The question\nin this case is whether a motion for reduction of sentence\nunder Rhode Island’s Rule 35 is an “application for State\npost-conviction or other collateral review.”\n   The parties agree that the answer to this question turns\non the meaning of the phrase “collateral review,” see Brief\nfor Petitioner 19; Brief for Respondent 12–13, but they\ndisagree about the definition of that term. Rhode Island\nargues that “collateral review” includes only “legal” chal\nlenges to a conviction or sentence and thus excludes mo\ntions seeking a discretionary sentence reduction. Respon\ndent, on the other hand, maintains that “collateral review”\nis “review other than review of a judgment in the direct\nappeal process” and thus includes motions to reduce sen\ntence. Brief for Respondent 17. We agree with respon\ndent’s understanding of “collateral review.”\n                             B\n  “Collateral review” is not defined in AEDPA, and we\nhave never provided a comprehensive definition of that\nterm. See Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 175–178\n(2001). We therefore begin by considering the ordinary\nunderstanding of the phrase “collateral review.” See\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 431 (2000) (“We give the\nwords of a statute their ordinary, contemporary, common\nmeaning, absent an indication Congress intended them to\nbear some different import” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)); see also Carey v. Saffold, 536 U. S. 214, 219\n(2002) (considering the ordinary meaning of the word\n“pending” in §2244(d)(2)).\n  The term “collateral,” in its “customary and preferred\nsense,” Williams, supra, at 431, means “[l]ying aside from\nthe main subject, line of action, issue, purpose, etc.; . . .\nsubordinate, indirect,” 3 Oxford English Dictionary 473\n(2d ed. 1989) (hereinafter OED); see also Webster’s Third\nNew International Dictionary 444 (1993) (hereinafter\n6                      WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nWebster’s) (“accompanying as . . . secondary,” “indirect,” or\n“ancillary”). By definition, something that is “collateral”\nis “indirect,” not direct. 3 OED 473. This suggests that\n“collateral” review is review that is “[l]ying aside from the\nmain” review, i.e., that is not part of direct review. See\nibid.\n   The definition of the related phrase “collateral attack”\npoints in the same direction. A “collateral attack” is “[a]n\nattack on a judgment in a proceeding other than a direct\nappeal.” Black’s Law Dictionary 298 (9th ed. 2009) (em\nphasis added); cf. Wash. Rev. Code §10.73.090(2) (2008)\n(defining “collateral attack” as “any form of postconviction\nrelief other than a direct appeal”). This usage buttresses\nthe conclusion that “collateral review” means a form of\nreview that is not part of the direct appeal process.\n                              C\n    Our prior usage of the term “collateral” also supports\nthis understanding. We have previously described a vari\nety of proceedings as “collateral,” and all of these proceed\nings share the characteristic that we have identified, i.e.,\nthey stand apart from the process of direct review.\n    For example, our cases make it clear that habeas corpus\nis a form of collateral review. We have used the terms\nhabeas corpus and “collateral review” interchangeably,\nsee, e.g., Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 482–483 (1986),\nand it is well accepted that state petitions for habeas\ncorpus toll the limitation period, e.g., Rhines v. Weber, 544\nU. S. 269, 272 (2005) (“[T]he 1-year statute of limitations\n. . . was tolled while Rhines’ state habeas corpus petition\nwas pending”).\n    We have also described coram nobis as a means of “col\nlateral attack,” see, e.g., United States v. Morgan, 346\nU. S. 502, 510–511 (1954) (internal quotation marks omit\nted), and we have used the term “collateral” to describe\nproceedings under 28 U. S. C. §2255 and a prior version of\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nRule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. In\nUnited States v. Robinson, 361 U. S. 220 (1960), we distin\nguished between the process of direct appeal and “a num\nber of collateral remedies,” including Federal Rule 35\nmotions, §2255 motions, and coram nobis. Id., at 230,\nn. 14. Similarly, in Bartone v. United States, 375 U. S. 52\n(1963) (per curiam), we drew a distinction between a\n“[d]irect attack” on a criminal judgment and “collateral\nproceedings,” such as Rule 35, habeas corpus, and §2255\nproceedings. Id., at 53–54.\n  All of the proceedings identified in these prior opinions\nas “collateral” are separate from the direct review process,\nand thus our prior usage of the term “collateral” but\ntresses the conclusion that “collateral review” means a\nform of review that is not direct.\n                              D\n  Of course, to trigger the tolling provision, a “collateral”\nproceeding must also involve a form of “review,” but the\nmeaning of that term seems clear. “Review” is best under\nstood as an “act of inspecting or examining” or a “judicial\nreexamination.” Webster’s 1944; see also Black’s, supra,\nat 1434 (“[c]onsideration, inspection, or reexamination of a\nsubject or thing”); 13 OED 831 (“[t]o submit (a decree, act,\netc.) to examination or revision”). We thus agree with the\nFirst Circuit that “ ‘review’ commonly denotes ‘a looking\nover or examination with a view to amendment or im\nprovement.’ ” 582 F. 3d, at 153 (quoting Webster’s 1944\n(2002)). Viewed as a whole, then, “collateral review” of a\njudgment or claim means a judicial reexamination of\na judgment or claim in a proceeding outside of the direct\nreview process.\n                         III\n We now apply this definition of “collateral review” to a\nRule 35 motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island\n8                      WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlaw.\n                              A\n   Rule 35 of the Rhode Island Rules of Criminal Procedure\nis much like the version of Federal Rule of Criminal Pro\ncedure 35 that was in force prior to the enactment of the\nfederal Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 and the promulga\ntion of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. See State v.\nByrnes, 456 A. 2d 742, 744 (R. I. 1983) (per curiam); Re\nporter’s Notes following R. I. Super. Ct. Rule Crim. Proc.\n35, R. I. Court Rules Ann., p. 620 (Lexis 2010). Under the\nRhode Island Rules, a Rule 35 motion permits a court to\nprovide relief from a sentence in three ways: A court “may”\n“correct an illegal sentence,” “correct a sentence imposed\nin an illegal manner,” and “reduce any sentence.” R.

In this\ncase, respondent filed a motion to reduce his sentence,\nwhich permits a trial justice to decide “ ‘ “on reflection or\non the basis of changed circumstances that the sentence\noriginally imposed was, for any reason, unduly severe.” ’ ”\nState v. Ruffner, 5 A. 3d 864, 867 (R. I. 2010) (quoting\nState v. Mendoza, 958 A. 2d 1159, 1161 (R. I. 2008)); see\nalso Reporter’s Notes following R. I. Super. Ct. Rule Crim.\nProc. 35, R. I.

Rhode Island\ncourts have, at times, referred to such a motion as a “ ‘plea\nfor leniency.’ ” Ruffner, supra, at 867 (quoting Mendoza,\nsupra, at 1161).\n   A Rule 35 motion is made in the Superior Court, and it\nis generally heard by the same trial justice who sentenced\nthe defendant. Byrnes, supra, at 745. The Rhode Island\nSupreme Court has explained that a motion to reduce\nsentence is “ ‘addressed to the sound discretion of the trial\njustice’ ” and that appellate review of the trial justice’s\ndecision is limited. Ruffner, supra, at 867 (quoting Men\ndoza, supra, at 1161). An appellate court may neverthe\nless disturb the trial justice’s decision “when the trial\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\njustice has imposed a sentence that is without justification\nand is grossly disparate from other sentences generally\nimposed for similar offenses.” Ruffner, supra, at 867\n(quoting State v. Coleman, 984 A. 2d 650, 654 (R. I. 2009);\ninternal quotation marks omitted); see also Ruffner, su\npra, at 867 (asking whether trial justice “abuse[d] his\ndiscretion”).\n                               B\n   With these principles in mind, we consider whether\nRhode Island’s Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence is an\napplication for “collateral review.”\n   The first—and the critical—question is whether a Rhode\nIsland Rule 35 sentence reduction proceeding is “collat\neral.” Respondent and Rhode Island agree that such a\nmotion is not part of the direct review process. Moreover,\nwe have previously referred to a motion to reduce sentence\nunder old Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Proce\ndure as invoking a “collateral” remedy, see Robinson,\nsupra, at 230, n. 14, and Rhode Island’s Rule 35 motion to\nreduce sentence is “substantially similar” to former Fed\neral Rule 35, Byrnes, supra, at 744. Lower courts have\nalso referred to Federal Rule 35 sentence reduction mo\ntions as “collateral.” See, e.g., Fernandez v. United States,\n941 F. 2d 1488, 1492 (CA11 1991) (“Fernandez initiated a\ncollateral attack on his sentence with a Rule 35(b) motion\nto reduce his sentence” under the old Federal Rule). We\nthus have little difficulty concluding that a Rhode Island\nsentence reduction proceeding is “collateral.”3\n——————\n  3 We  can imagine an argument that a Rhode Island Rule 35 proceed\ning is in fact part of direct review under §2244(d)(1) because, according\nto the parties, defendants in Rhode Island cannot raise any challenge to\ntheir sentences on direct appeal; instead, they must bring a Rule 35\nmotion. See, e.g., State v. Day, 925 A. 2d 962, 985 (R. I. 2007) (“It is\nwell settled in this jurisdiction that a challenge to a criminal sentence\nmust begin with the filing of a [Rule 35] motion . . . . [W]e will not\nconsider the validity or legality of a sentence on direct appeal unless\n10                         WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Not only is a motion to reduce sentence under Rhode\nIsland law “collateral,” but it also undoubtedly calls for\n“review” of the sentence. The decision to reduce a sen\ntence, while largely within the discretion of the trial jus\ntice, involves judicial reexamination of the sentence to\ndetermine whether a more lenient sentence is proper.4\nWhen ruling on such a motion, a trial justice is guided by\nseveral factors, including “(1) the severity of the crime, (2)\nthe defendant’s personal, educational, and employment\nbackground, (3) the potential for rehabilitation, (4) the\nelement of societal deterrence, and (5) the appropriateness\nof the punishment.” State v. Mollicone, 746 A. 2d 135, 138\n(R. I. 2000) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omit\nted); see also Ruffner, supra, at 867; Coleman, supra, at\n655. On appeal from a trial justice’s decision on a motion\nto reduce sentence, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island\nevaluates the trial justice’s justifications in light of the\nrelevant sentencing factors to determine whether a sen\ntence is “without justification” and “grossly disparate from\nother sentences.” Ruffner, supra, at 867 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted).5 This process surely qualifies as\n——————\nextraordinary circumstances exist” (internal quotation marks omitted));\nState v. McManus, 990 A. 2d 1229, 1238 (R. I. 2010) (refusing to con\nsider Eighth Amendment challenge on direct review because “[t]o\nchallenge a criminal sentence, the defendant must first file a motion to\nreduce in accordance with Rule 35”); see also Jimenez v. Quarterman,\n555 U. S. 113, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 6–7). That issue has not been\nbriefed or argued by the parties, however, and we express no opinion as\nto the merit of such an argument. Even if we were to assume that a\nRhode Island Rule 35 motion is part of direct review, our disposition of\nthis case would not change: Respondent’s habeas petition still would be\ntimely, because the limitation period would not have begun to run until\nafter the Rule 35 proceedings concluded.\n  4 A motion to reduce sentence is unlike a motion for postconviction\n\ndiscovery or a motion for appointment of counsel, which generally are\nnot direct requests for judicial review of a judgment and do not provide\na state court with authority to order relief from a judgment.\n  5 E.g., State v. Coleman, 984 A. 2d 650, 657 (R. I. 2009) (“Given these\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

Rhode Island argues that Congress, in enacting\nAEDPA, must be presumed to have been aware of this\nusage and must have intended the phrase to carry this\nnarrow meaning.\n  This argument reads far too much into these prior refer\nences to “collateral review.” While our opinions have used\nthe phrase “collateral review” to refer to proceedings that\nchallenge the lawfulness of a prior judgment, we have\nnever suggested that the phrase may properly be used to\ndescribe only proceedings of this type. In addition, Rhode\nIsland overlooks opinions describing a motion to reduce\nsentence as “collateral.” E.g., Robinson, 361 U. S., at 230,\nn. 14; Fernandez, supra, at 1492; see also 1 D. Wilkes,\n——————\nfactors, and the trial justice’s exhaustive explanation of her reasoning\nin sentencing Mr. Coleman, we hold it was not an abuse of her discre\ntion to order Mr. Coleman to serve consecutive sentences”); State v.\nFerrara, 818 A. 2d 642, 645 (R.

KHOLI\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nState Postconviction Remedies and Relief Handbook §§1:2,\n1:7, pp. 2, 15 (2010) (characterizing a motion to reduce\nsentence as a “collateral” or “postconviction” remedy).\n  In a related argument, Rhode Island notes that several\nother AEDPA provisions use the term “collateral review”\nto refer to proceedings that involve a challenge to the\nlawfulness of a state-court judgment, see 28 U. S. C.\n§§2244(b)(2)(A), (d)(1)(C), 2254(e)(2)(A)(i),6 and Rhode\nIsland reasons that the phrase “collateral review” in\n§2244(d)(2) should be limited to proceedings of this nature.\nThis argument has the same flaw as the argument just\ndiscussed. Just because the phrase “collateral review”\nencompasses proceedings that challenge the lawfulness of\na prior judgment, it does not follow that other proceedings\nmay not also be described as involving “collateral review.”\n  Finally, Rhode Island contends that the purpose of the\ntolling provision is to allow a state prisoner to exhaust\nstate remedies and that this purpose is not served when a\nprisoner’s state application merely seeks sentencing leni\nency, a matter that cannot be raised in a federal habeas\npetition. This argument is based on an excessively narrow\nunderstanding of §2244(d)(2)’s role.\n  It is certainly true that a purpose—and perhaps the\nchief purpose—of tolling under §2244(d)(2) is to permit\nthe exhaustion of state remedies, see Duncan, 533 U. S., at\n178–179, but that is not §2244(d)(2)’s only role. The toll\ning provision “provides a powerful incentive for litigants to\nexhaust all available state remedies before proceeding in\nthe lower federal courts.” Id., at 180 (emphasis added).\nTolling the limitation period for all “collateral review”\nmotions provides both litigants and States with an oppor\ntunity to resolve objections at the state level, potentially\nobviating the need for a litigant to resort to federal court.\n——————\n  6 All of these provisions refer to a new rule of constitutional law made\n\nretroactively applicable by this Court to “cases on collateral review.”\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nIf, for example, a litigant obtains relief on state-law\ngrounds, there may be no need for federal habeas. The\nsame dynamic may be present to a degree with respect to\nmotions that do not challenge the lawfulness of a judg\nment. If a defendant receives relief in state court, the\nneed for federal habeas review may be narrowed or even\nobviated, and this furthers principles of “comity, finality,\nand federalism.” Williams, 529 U. S., at 436.\n   Rhode Island’s interpretation of §2244(d)(2) would also\ngreatly complicate the work of federal habeas courts.\nRhode Island would require those courts to separate mo\ntions for a reduced sentence into two categories: those that\nchallenge a sentence on legal grounds and those that\nmerely ask for leniency. But this taxonomy is problem\natic. Even if a jurisdiction allows sentencing judges to\nexercise a high degree of discretion in selecting a sentence\nfrom within a prescribed range, it does not necessarily\nfollow that the judge’s choice is insulated from challenge\non legal grounds. “[D]iscretionary choices are not left to a\ncourt’s ‘inclination, but to its judgment; and its judgment\nis to be guided by sound legal principles.’ ” Albemarle\nPaper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 416 (1975) (quoting\nUnited States v. Burr, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1761527\"><a href=\"/opinion/1761527/state-v-burr/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Cas.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 35 (No. 14,692d) (CC\nVa. 1807) (Marshall, C. J.)). If the law of a jurisdiction\nprovides criteria to guide a trial judge’s exercise of sen\ntencing discretion, a motion to reduce sentence may argue\nthat a sentence is inconsistent with those criteria. In that\nsense, the motion argues that the sentence is contrary to\nsentencing law. See, e.g., Ruffner, 5 A. 3d, at 867 (“A trial\njustice considers a number of factors when determining a\nfair sentence[,] including the defendant’s potential for\nrehabilitation. The defendant asserts that the trial justice\ndid not consider defendant’s participation in rehabilitative\nprograms” (citations omitted)). We do not think that\n§2244(d)(2) was meant to require federal habeas courts to\ndraw the sort of difficult distinction that Rhode Island’s\n14                         WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpretation would demand.\n   We also reject the argument that the meaning of the\nphrase “collateral review” should turn on whether the\nmotion or application that triggers that review is cap\ntioned as a part of the criminal case or as a separate pro\nceeding. See Walkowiak v. Haines, 272 F. 3d 234, 237\n(CA4 2001). This interpretation of §2244(d)(2) would\nproduce confusion and inconsistency.\n   For one thing, some “collateral” proceedings are often\nregarded as part of the criminal case. We have said, for\nexample, that a writ of coram nobis “is a step in the crimi\nnal case and not . . . a separate case and record, the begin\nning of a separate civil proceeding.” Morgan, 346 U. S., at\n505, n. 4; see also United States v. Denedo, 556 U. S. ___,\n___ (2009) (slip op., at 8) (“[A]n application for the writ is\nproperly viewed as a belated extension of the original\nproceeding during which the error allegedly transpired”).\nBut we have nonetheless suggested that coram nobis is a\nmeans of “collateral attack.” Morgan, supra, at 510–511\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Robinson, 361\nU. S., at 230, n. 14. Similarly, a motion under 28 U. S. C.\n§2255 (2006 ed., Supp. III) is entered on the docket of the\noriginal criminal case and is typically referred to the judge\nwho originally presided over the challenged proceedings,\nsee §2255 Rules 3(b), 4(a), but there is no dispute that\n§2255 proceedings are “collateral,” see, e.g., Massaro v.\nUnited States, 538 U. S. 500, 504 (2003) (describing §2255\nproceedings as “collateral”); Daniels v. United States, 532\nU. S. 374, 379 (2001) (same).7\n——————\n   7 In other contexts not relevant here, there has been some confusion\n\nover whether §2255 proceedings are civil or criminal in nature. See,\ne.g., Postconviction Remedies §3:5, p. 251 (2010) (“[T]here is a dispute\nover whether the [§2255] motion initiates an independent civil action\nor, instead, is merely a further step in the criminal prosecution”); 3 C.\nWright & S. Welling, Federal Practice and Procedure §622 (4th ed.\n2011). We express no opinion on this question.\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Moreover, the methods of filing for postconviction or\ncollateral review vary among the States. In the District of\nColumbia and fourteen States, the principal postconviction\nremedy is part of the original case; in other States, it is\nnot. 1 Wilkes, State Postconviction Remedies and Relief\nHandbook §1:3, at 6–7. Given the States’ “different forms\nof collateral review,” Duncan, 533 U. S., at 177, the ap\nplication of AEDPA’s tolling provision should not turn\non such formalities. See ibid. (“Congress may have re\nfrained from exclusive reliance on the term ‘post-conviction’\nso as to leave no doubt that the tolling provision applies\nto all types of state collateral review available after a\nconviction”).\n  We thus define “collateral review” according to its ordi\nnary meaning: It refers to judicial review that occurs in a\nproceeding outside of the direct review process.\n                        *    *   *\n   For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nis affirmed.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 562 U.

KHOLI\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 09–868.      Argued November 29, 2010—Decided March 7, 2011\nRespondent was convicted in Rhode Island Superior Court on 10 counts\n  of first-degree sexual assault and sentenced to consecutive life terms.\n  His conviction became final on direct review on May 29, 1996. In ad\n  dition to his direct appeal, he filed two relevant state motions. One, a\n  May 16, 1996, motion to reduce his sentence under Rhode Island Su\n  perior Court Rule of Criminal Procedure 35, was denied. The State\n  Supreme Court affirmed on January 16, 1998. The second, a state\n  postconviction relief motion, was also denied. That decision was af\n  firmed on December 14, 2006. When respondent filed his federal ha\n  beas petition, his conviction had been final for over 11 years. The\n  Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) gen\n  erally requires a federal petition to be filed within one year of the\n  date on which a judgment became final, 28 U. S. C. §2244(d)(1)(A),\n  but “a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other col\n  lateral review” tolls that period, §2244(d)(2). Respondent’s postcon\n  viction relief motion tolled the period for over nine years, but his Rule\n  35 motion must also trigger the tolling provision for his habeas peti\n  tion to be timely. The District Court dismissed the petition as un\n  timely, adopting the Magistrate Judge’s conclusion that the Rule 35\n  motion was not “a properly filed application for . . . collateral review”\n  under §2244(d)(2). The First Circuit reversed.\nHeld:\n    1. The phrase “collateral review” in §2244(d)(2) means judicial re\n view of a judgment in a proceeding that is not part of direct review.\n Pp. 4–8.\n       (a) The parties agree that the answer to the question whether a\n motion to reduce sentence is an “application for State post-conviction\n2                            WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    or other collateral review” turns on the meaning of “collateral re\n    view,” but they disagree about what that meaning should be. Pp.\n    4–5.\n          (b) Because “collateral review” is not defined in AEDPA, the\n    Court begins with the ordinary understanding of that phrase. By\n    definition, “collateral” describes something that is “indirect,” not di\n    rect. 3 Oxford English Dictionary 473. This suggests that “collat\n    eral” review is not part of direct review. This conclusion is supported\n    by the definition of the related phrase “collateral attack” and by the\n    Court’s prior use of the term “collateral” to describe proceedings that\n    are separate from the direct review process. Pp. 5–7.\n          (c) The term “review” is best understood as a “judicial reexami\n    nation.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 1944. Pp.\n    7–8.\n       2. A Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law is\n    an application for “collateral review” that triggers AEDPA’s tolling\n    provision. Pp. 8–15.\n          (a) Rhode Island’s Rule 35 is similar to the version of Federal\n    Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 in effect before the federal Sentencing\n    Reform Act of 1984. The Rule permits a court to provide relief, as\n    relevant here, to “reduce any sentence,” and it is generally addressed\n    to the sound discretion of the sentencing justice. Under the limited\n    review available, an appellate court may disturb the trial justice’s de\n    cision if the sentence imposed is without justification and is grossly\n    disparate when compared to sentences for similar offenses. Pp. 8–9.\n          (b) Keeping these principles in mind, a Rule 35 sentence reduc\n    tion proceeding is “collateral.” The parties agree that the motion is\n    not part of the direct review process, and both this Court and lower\n    federal courts have described a motion to reduce sentence under old\n    Federal Rule 35 as invoking a “collateral” remedy. Therefore, it is\n    not difficult to conclude that Rhode Island’s motion to reduce sen\n    tence is “collateral.” A Rule 35 motion also calls for “review” of the\n    sentence within §2244(d)(2)’s meaning. The decision to reduce a sen\n    tence involves judicial reexamination of the sentence to determine\n    whether a more lenient sentence is proper. The trial justice is guided\n    by several sentencing factors in making that decision. And those fac\n    tors are also used by the State Supreme Court in evaluating the trial\n    justice’s justifications for the sentence. Pp. 9–11.\n          (c) Rhode Island’s arguments in support of its opposing view that\n    “collateral review” includes only “legal” challenges to a conviction or\n    sentence, and thus excludes motions for a discretionary sentence re\n    duction, are unpersuasive. Nor does “collateral review” turn on\n    whether a motion is part of the same criminal case. Pp. 11–15.\n582 F. 3d 147, affirmed.\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

WALL, II, DIRECTOR, RHODE ISLAND \n\n     DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, PETI- \n\n            TIONER v. KHALIL KHOLI \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n             APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 7, 2011] \n\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (AEDPA), “a properly filed application for\nState post-conviction or other collateral review with re\nspect to the pertinent judgment or claim” tolls the 1-year\nlimitation period for filing a federal habeas petition. 28\nU. S. C. §2244(d)(2). The question in this case is whether\na motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law tolls\nthe limitation period, thereby rendering respondent Khalil\nKholi’s federal habeas petition timely. We hold that the\nphrase “collateral review” in §2244(d)(2) means judicial\nreview of a judgment in a proceeding that is not part of\ndirect review. Because the parties agree that a motion to\nreduce sentence under Rhode Island law is not part of the\ndirect review process, we hold that respondent’s motion\ntolled the AEDPA limitation period and that his federal\nhabeas petition was therefore timely.\n                         I\n                         A\n  In 1993, respondent was convicted in Rhode Island\n2                          WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nSuperior Court on 10 counts of first-degree sexual assault,\nand he was sentenced to consecutive terms of life im\nprisonment. Respondent raised various challenges to\nhis conviction on direct appeal, but the Supreme Court of\nRhode Island affirmed his conviction. See State v. Kholi,\n672 A. 2d 429, 431 (1996). The parties agree that respon\ndent’s conviction became final on direct review when his\ntime expired for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari in\nthis Court. Brief for Petitioner 7, n. 4; Brief for Respon\ndent 3, n. 1; 582 F. 3d 147, 150 (CA1 2009); see generally\nJimenez v. Quarterman, 555 U. S. 113, ___ (2009) (slip op.,\nat 6). That date was May 29, 1996. See this Court’s Rules\n13.1, 13.3, 30.1.\n   In addition to taking a direct appeal, respondent filed\ntwo state motions that are relevant to our decision. The\nfirst, filed on May 16, 1996, was a motion to reduce sen\ntence under Rule 35 of the Rhode Island Superior Court\nRules of Criminal Procedure.1 App. 8. In that motion,\nrespondent asked the trial court to “reconsider its prior\ndetermination” and “order that his life sentences run\nconcurrently.” State v. Kholi, 706 A. 2d 1326 (R. I. 1998)\n(order). Concluding that “the sentence imposed was ap\n——————\n   1 This Rule provides in relevant part:\n\n“The court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.

On January 16, 1998, the State Supreme Court\naffirmed and observed that the facts clearly justified the\nsentence. Id., at 1326–1327.\n  On May 23, 1997, while the Rule 35 motion was pend\ning, respondent also filed an application for state postcon\nviction relief, see R. I. Gen. Laws 10–9.1–1 et seq. (Lexis\n1997) (titled “Post Conviction Remedy”), which challenged\nhis conviction. The trial court denied this motion as well,\nand the State Supreme Court affirmed that decision on\nDecember 14, 2006. See Kholi v. Wall, 911 A. 2d 262, 263–\n264 (R. I. 2006).\n                              B\n   Respondent filed a federal habeas petition in the Dis\ntrict of Rhode Island on September 5, 2007. App. 3. By\nthat time, his conviction had been final for over 11 years.\nAEDPA generally requires a federal habeas petition to be\nfiled within one year of the date on which the judgment\nbecame final by the conclusion of direct review. 28\nU. S. C. §2244(d)(1)(A). But the 1-year limitation period is\ntolled during the pendency of “a properly filed application\nfor State post-conviction or other collateral review with\nrespect to the pertinent judgment or claim.” §2244(d)(2).\n   There is no dispute that respondent’s application for\npostconviction relief tolled the limitation period for over\nnine years—from May 23, 1997, through December 14,\n2006. 582 F. 3d, at 151. Even after subtracting that\nstretch of time from the 11-year period, however, the\nperiod between the conclusion of direct review and the\nfiling of the federal habeas petition still exceeds one year.\nThus, in order for respondent’s petition to be timely, the\nRule 35 motion to reduce sentence must also trigger the\ntolling provision.\n   Respondent’s federal habeas petition was referred to a\nMagistrate Judge for a report and recommendation, and\n4                         WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Magistrate Judge concluded that the Rule 35 motion\nwas not a “ ‘properly filed application for post-conviction or\nother collateral review’ ” under §2244(d)(2) because it was\n“a ‘plea of leniency,’ and not a motion challenging the legal\nsufficiency of his sentence.” No. CA 07–346S, 2008 WL\n60194, *4 (R. I., Jan. 3, 2008). The District Court adopted\nthe Magistrate Judge’s report and recommendation and\ntherefore dismissed the federal habeas petition as un\ntimely. See id., at *1. On appeal, the First Circuit re\nversed. 582 F. 3d 147.\n  The Courts of Appeals are divided over the question\nwhether a motion to reduce sentence tolls the period of\nlimitation under §2244(d)(2).2 We granted certiorari to\nanswer this question with respect to a motion to reduce\nsentence under Rhode Island law. 560 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                               II \n\n                               A\n\n  AEDPA establishes a 1-year period of limitation for a\nstate prisoner to file a federal application for a writ of\nhabeas corpus. §2244(d)(1). This period runs “from the\nlatest of” four specified dates, including “the date on which\nthe judgment became final by the conclusion of direct\nreview or the expiration of the time for seeking such re\nview.” §2244(d)(1)(A); see also Jimenez, supra, at ___ (slip\nop., at 6) (explaining when “the conclusion of direct review\noccurs”).

The question\nin this case is whether a motion for reduction of sentence\nunder Rhode Island’s Rule 35 is an “application for State\npost-conviction or other collateral review.”\n   The parties agree that the answer to this question turns\non the meaning of the phrase “collateral review,” see Brief\nfor Petitioner 19; Brief for Respondent 12–13, but they\ndisagree about the definition of that term. Rhode Island\nargues that “collateral review” includes only “legal” chal\nlenges to a conviction or sentence and thus excludes mo\ntions seeking a discretionary sentence reduction. Respon\ndent, on the other hand, maintains that “collateral review”\nis “review other than review of a judgment in the direct\nappeal process” and thus includes motions to reduce sen\ntence. Brief for Respondent 17. We agree with respon\ndent’s understanding of “collateral review.”\n                             B\n  “Collateral review” is not defined in AEDPA, and we\nhave never provided a comprehensive definition of that\nterm. See Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 175–178\n(2001). We therefore begin by considering the ordinary\nunderstanding of the phrase “collateral review.” See\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 431 (2000) (“We give the\nwords of a statute their ordinary, contemporary, common\nmeaning, absent an indication Congress intended them to\nbear some different import” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)); see also Carey v. Saffold, 536 U. S. 214, 219\n(2002) (considering the ordinary meaning of the word\n“pending” in §2244(d)(2)).\n  The term “collateral,” in its “customary and preferred\nsense,” Williams, supra, at 431, means “[l]ying aside from\nthe main subject, line of action, issue, purpose, etc.; . . .\nsubordinate, indirect,” 3 Oxford English Dictionary 473\n(2d ed. 1989) (hereinafter OED); see also Webster’s Third\nNew International Dictionary 444 (1993) (hereinafter\n6                      WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nWebster’s) (“accompanying as . . . secondary,” “indirect,” or\n“ancillary”). By definition, something that is “collateral”\nis “indirect,” not direct. 3 OED 473. This suggests that\n“collateral” review is review that is “[l]ying aside from the\nmain” review, i.e., that is not part of direct review. See\nibid.\n   The definition of the related phrase “collateral attack”\npoints in the same direction. A “collateral attack” is “[a]n\nattack on a judgment in a proceeding other than a direct\nappeal.” Black’s Law Dictionary 298 (9th ed. 2009) (em\nphasis added); cf. Wash. Rev. Code §10.73.090(2) (2008)\n(defining “collateral attack” as “any form of postconviction\nrelief other than a direct appeal”). This usage buttresses\nthe conclusion that “collateral review” means a form of\nreview that is not part of the direct appeal process.\n                              C\n    Our prior usage of the term “collateral” also supports\nthis understanding. We have previously described a vari\nety of proceedings as “collateral,” and all of these proceed\nings share the characteristic that we have identified, i.e.,\nthey stand apart from the process of direct review.\n    For example, our cases make it clear that habeas corpus\nis a form of collateral review. We have used the terms\nhabeas corpus and “collateral review” interchangeably,\nsee, e.g., Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 482–483 (1986),\nand it is well accepted that state petitions for habeas\ncorpus toll the limitation period, e.g., Rhines v. Weber, 544\nU. S. 269, 272 (2005) (“[T]he 1-year statute of limitations\n. . . was tolled while Rhines’ state habeas corpus petition\nwas pending”).\n    We have also described coram nobis as a means of “col\nlateral attack,” see, e.g., United States v. Morgan, 346\nU. S. 502, 510–511 (1954) (internal quotation marks omit\nted), and we have used the term “collateral” to describe\nproceedings under 28 U. S. C. §2255 and a prior version of\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nRule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. In\nUnited States v. Robinson, 361 U. S. 220 (1960), we distin\nguished between the process of direct appeal and “a num\nber of collateral remedies,” including Federal Rule 35\nmotions, §2255 motions, and coram nobis. Id., at 230,\nn. 14. Similarly, in Bartone v. United States, 375 U. S. 52\n(1963) (per curiam), we drew a distinction between a\n“[d]irect attack” on a criminal judgment and “collateral\nproceedings,” such as Rule 35, habeas corpus, and §2255\nproceedings. Id., at 53–54.\n  All of the proceedings identified in these prior opinions\nas “collateral” are separate from the direct review process,\nand thus our prior usage of the term “collateral” but\ntresses the conclusion that “collateral review” means a\nform of review that is not direct.\n                              D\n  Of course, to trigger the tolling provision, a “collateral”\nproceeding must also involve a form of “review,” but the\nmeaning of that term seems clear. “Review” is best under\nstood as an “act of inspecting or examining” or a “judicial\nreexamination.” Webster’s 1944; see also Black’s, supra,\nat 1434 (“[c]onsideration, inspection, or reexamination of a\nsubject or thing”); 13 OED 831 (“[t]o submit (a decree, act,\netc.) to examination or revision”). We thus agree with the\nFirst Circuit that “ ‘review’ commonly denotes ‘a looking\nover or examination with a view to amendment or im\nprovement.’ ” 582 F. 3d, at 153 (quoting Webster’s 1944\n(2002)). Viewed as a whole, then, “collateral review” of a\njudgment or claim means a judicial reexamination of\na judgment or claim in a proceeding outside of the direct\nreview process.\n                         III\n We now apply this definition of “collateral review” to a\nRule 35 motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island\n8                      WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlaw.\n                              A\n   Rule 35 of the Rhode Island Rules of Criminal Procedure\nis much like the version of Federal Rule of Criminal Pro\ncedure 35 that was in force prior to the enactment of the\nfederal Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 and the promulga\ntion of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. See State v.\nByrnes, 456 A. 2d 742, 744 (R. I. 1983) (per curiam); Re\nporter’s Notes following R. I. Super. Ct. Rule Crim. Proc.\n35, R. I. Court Rules Ann., p. 620 (Lexis 2010). Under the\nRhode Island Rules, a Rule 35 motion permits a court to\nprovide relief from a sentence in three ways: A court “may”\n“correct an illegal sentence,” “correct a sentence imposed\nin an illegal manner,” and “reduce any sentence.” R. I.\nSuper. Ct. Rule Crim. Proc. 35(a); see n. 1, supra. In this\ncase, respondent filed a motion to reduce his sentence,\nwhich permits a trial justice to decide “ ‘ “on reflection or\non the basis of changed circumstances that the sentence\noriginally imposed was, for any reason, unduly severe.” ’ ”\nState v. Ruffner, 5 A. 3d 864, 867 (R. I. 2010) (quoting\nState v. Mendoza, 958 A. 2d 1159, 1161 (R. I. 2008)); see\nalso Reporter’s Notes following R. I. Super. Ct. Rule Crim.\nProc. 35, R. I. Court Rules Ann., at 620–621. Rhode Island\ncourts have, at times, referred to such a motion as a “ ‘plea\nfor leniency.’ ” Ruffner, supra, at 867 (quoting Mendoza,\nsupra, at 1161).\n   A Rule 35 motion is made in the Superior Court, and it\nis generally heard by the same trial justice who sentenced\nthe defendant. Byrnes, supra, at 745. The Rhode Island\nSupreme Court has explained that a motion to reduce\nsentence is “ ‘addressed to the sound discretion of the trial\njustice’ ” and that appellate review of the trial justice’s\ndecision is limited. Ruffner, supra, at 867 (quoting Men\ndoza, supra, at 1161). An appellate court may neverthe\nless disturb the trial justice’s decision “when the trial\n                     Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\njustice has imposed a sentence that is without justification\nand is grossly disparate from other sentences generally\nimposed for similar offenses.” Ruffner, supra, at 867\n(quoting State v. Coleman, 984 A. 2d 650, 654 (R. I. 2009);\ninternal quotation marks omitted); see also Ruffner, su\npra, at 867 (asking whether trial justice “abuse[d] his\ndiscretion”).\n                               B\n   With these principles in mind, we consider whether\nRhode Island’s Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence is an\napplication for “collateral review.”\n   The first—and the critical—question is whether a Rhode\nIsland Rule 35 sentence reduction proceeding is “collat\neral.” Respondent and Rhode Island agree that such a\nmotion is not part of the direct review process. Moreover,\nwe have previously referred to a motion to reduce sentence\nunder old Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Proce\ndure as invoking a “collateral” remedy, see Robinson,\nsupra, at 230, n. 14, and Rhode Island’s Rule 35 motion to\nreduce sentence is “substantially similar” to former Fed\neral Rule 35, Byrnes, supra, at 744. Lower courts have\nalso referred to Federal Rule 35 sentence reduction mo\ntions as “collateral.” See, e.g., Fernandez v. United States,\n941 F. 2d 1488, 1492 (CA11 1991) (“Fernandez initiated a\ncollateral attack on his sentence with a Rule 35(b) motion\nto reduce his sentence” under the old Federal Rule). We\nthus have little difficulty concluding that a Rhode Island\nsentence reduction proceeding is “collateral.”3\n——————\n  3 We  can imagine an argument that a Rhode Island Rule 35 proceed\ning is in fact part of direct review under §2244(d)(1) because, according\nto the parties, defendants in Rhode Island cannot raise any challenge to\ntheir sentences on direct appeal; instead, they must bring a Rule 35\nmotion. See, e.g., State v. Day, 925 A. 2d 962, 985 (R. I. 2007) (“It is\nwell settled in this jurisdiction that a challenge to a criminal sentence\nmust begin with the filing of a [Rule 35] motion . . . . [W]e will not\nconsider the validity or legality of a sentence on direct appeal unless\n10                         WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Not only is a motion to reduce sentence under Rhode\nIsland law “collateral,” but it also undoubtedly calls for\n“review” of the sentence. The decision to reduce a sen\ntence, while largely within the discretion of the trial jus\ntice, involves judicial reexamination of the sentence to\ndetermine whether a more lenient sentence is proper.4\nWhen ruling on such a motion, a trial justice is guided by\nseveral factors, including “(1) the severity of the crime, (2)\nthe defendant’s personal, educational, and employment\nbackground, (3) the potential for rehabilitation, (4) the\nelement of societal deterrence, and (5) the appropriateness\nof the punishment.” State v. Mollicone, 746 A. 2d 135, 138\n(R. I. 2000) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omit\nted); see also Ruffner, supra, at 867; Coleman, supra, at\n655. On appeal from a trial justice’s decision on a motion\nto reduce sentence, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island\nevaluates the trial justice’s justifications in light of the\nrelevant sentencing factors to determine whether a sen\ntence is “without justification” and “grossly disparate from\nother sentences.” Ruffner, supra, at 867 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted).5 This process surely qualifies as\n——————\nextraordinary circumstances exist” (internal quotation marks omitted));\nState v. McManus, 990 A. 2d 1229, 1238 (R. I. 2010) (refusing to con\nsider Eighth Amendment challenge on direct review because “[t]o\nchallenge a criminal sentence, the defendant must first file a motion to\nreduce in accordance with Rule 35”); see also Jimenez v. Quarterman,\n555 U. S. 113, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 6–7). That issue has not been\nbriefed or argued by the parties, however, and we express no opinion as\nto the merit of such an argument. Even if we were to assume that a\nRhode Island Rule 35 motion is part of direct review, our disposition of\nthis case would not change: Respondent’s habeas petition still would be\ntimely, because the limitation period would not have begun to run until\nafter the Rule 35 proceedings concluded.\n  4 A motion to reduce sentence is unlike a motion for postconviction\n\ndiscovery or a motion for appointment of counsel, which generally are\nnot direct requests for judicial review of a judgment and do not provide\na state court with authority to order relief from a judgment.\n  5 E.g., State v. Coleman, 984 A. 2d 650, 657 (R. I. 2009) (“Given these\n                     Cite as: 562 U.

Rhode Island argues that Congress, in enacting\nAEDPA, must be presumed to have been aware of this\nusage and must have intended the phrase to carry this\nnarrow meaning.\n  This argument reads far too much into these prior refer\nences to “collateral review.” While our opinions have used\nthe phrase “collateral review” to refer to proceedings that\nchallenge the lawfulness of a prior judgment, we have\nnever suggested that the phrase may properly be used to\ndescribe only proceedings of this type. In addition, Rhode\nIsland overlooks opinions describing a motion to reduce\nsentence as “collateral.” E.g., Robinson, 361 U. S., at 230,\nn. 14; Fernandez, supra, at 1492; see also 1 D. Wilkes,\n——————\nfactors, and the trial justice’s exhaustive explanation of her reasoning\nin sentencing Mr. Coleman, we hold it was not an abuse of her discre\ntion to order Mr. Coleman to serve consecutive sentences”); State v.\nFerrara, 818 A. 2d 642, 645 (R.

KHOLI\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nState Postconviction Remedies and Relief Handbook §§1:2,\n1:7, pp. 2, 15 (2010) (characterizing a motion to reduce\nsentence as a “collateral” or “postconviction” remedy).\n  In a related argument, Rhode Island notes that several\nother AEDPA provisions use the term “collateral review”\nto refer to proceedings that involve a challenge to the\nlawfulness of a state-court judgment, see 28 U. S. C.\n§§2244(b)(2)(A), (d)(1)(C), 2254(e)(2)(A)(i),6 and Rhode\nIsland reasons that the phrase “collateral review” in\n§2244(d)(2) should be limited to proceedings of this nature.\nThis argument has the same flaw as the argument just\ndiscussed. Just because the phrase “collateral review”\nencompasses proceedings that challenge the lawfulness of\na prior judgment, it does not follow that other proceedings\nmay not also be described as involving “collateral review.”\n  Finally, Rhode Island contends that the purpose of the\ntolling provision is to allow a state prisoner to exhaust\nstate remedies and that this purpose is not served when a\nprisoner’s state application merely seeks sentencing leni\nency, a matter that cannot be raised in a federal habeas\npetition. This argument is based on an excessively narrow\nunderstanding of §2244(d)(2)’s role.\n  It is certainly true that a purpose—and perhaps the\nchief purpose—of tolling under §2244(d)(2) is to permit\nthe exhaustion of state remedies, see Duncan, 533 U. S., at\n178–179, but that is not §2244(d)(2)’s only role. The toll\ning provision “provides a powerful incentive for litigants to\nexhaust all available state remedies before proceeding in\nthe lower federal courts.” Id., at 180 (emphasis added).\nTolling the limitation period for all “collateral review”\nmotions provides both litigants and States with an oppor\ntunity to resolve objections at the state level, potentially\nobviating the need for a litigant to resort to federal court.\n——————\n  6 All of these provisions refer to a new rule of constitutional law made\n\nretroactively applicable by this Court to “cases on collateral review.”\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nIf, for example, a litigant obtains relief on state-law\ngrounds, there may be no need for federal habeas. The\nsame dynamic may be present to a degree with respect to\nmotions that do not challenge the lawfulness of a judg\nment. If a defendant receives relief in state court, the\nneed for federal habeas review may be narrowed or even\nobviated, and this furthers principles of “comity, finality,\nand federalism.” Williams, 529 U. S., at 436.\n   Rhode Island’s interpretation of §2244(d)(2) would also\ngreatly complicate the work of federal habeas courts.\nRhode Island would require those courts to separate mo\ntions for a reduced sentence into two categories: those that\nchallenge a sentence on legal grounds and those that\nmerely ask for leniency. But this taxonomy is problem\natic. Even if a jurisdiction allows sentencing judges to\nexercise a high degree of discretion in selecting a sentence\nfrom within a prescribed range, it does not necessarily\nfollow that the judge’s choice is insulated from challenge\non legal grounds. “[D]iscretionary choices are not left to a\ncourt’s ‘inclination, but to its judgment; and its judgment\nis to be guided by sound legal principles.’ ” Albemarle\nPaper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 416 (1975) (quoting\nUnited States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 30, 35 (No. 14,692d) (CC\nVa. 1807) (Marshall, C. J.)). If the law of a jurisdiction\nprovides criteria to guide a trial judge’s exercise of sen\ntencing discretion, a motion to reduce sentence may argue\nthat a sentence is inconsistent with those criteria. In that\nsense, the motion argues that the sentence is contrary to\nsentencing law. See, e.g., Ruffner, 5 A. 3d, at 867 (“A trial\njustice considers a number of factors when determining a\nfair sentence[,] including the defendant’s potential for\nrehabilitation. The defendant asserts that the trial justice\ndid not consider defendant’s participation in rehabilitative\nprograms” (citations omitted)). We do not think that\n§2244(d)(2) was meant to require federal habeas courts to\ndraw the sort of difficult distinction that Rhode Island’s\n14                         WALL v. KHOLI\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpretation would demand.\n   We also reject the argument that the meaning of the\nphrase “collateral review” should turn on whether the\nmotion or application that triggers that review is cap\ntioned as a part of the criminal case or as a separate pro\nceeding. See Walkowiak v. Haines, 272 F. 3d 234, 237\n(CA4 2001). This interpretation of §2244(d)(2) would\nproduce confusion and inconsistency.\n   For one thing, some “collateral” proceedings are often\nregarded as part of the criminal case. We have said, for\nexample, that a writ of coram nobis “is a step in the crimi\nnal case and not . . . a separate case and record, the begin\nning of a separate civil proceeding.” Morgan, 346 U. S., at\n505, n. 4; see also United States v. Denedo, 556 U. S. ___,\n___ (2009) (slip op., at 8) (“[A]n application for the writ is\nproperly viewed as a belated extension of the original\nproceeding during which the error allegedly transpired”).\nBut we have nonetheless suggested that coram nobis is a\nmeans of “collateral attack.” Morgan, supra, at 510–511\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Robinson, 361\nU. S., at 230, n. 14. Similarly, a motion under 28 U. S. C.\n§2255 (2006 ed., Supp. III) is entered on the docket of the\noriginal criminal case and is typically referred to the judge\nwho originally presided over the challenged proceedings,\nsee §2255 Rules 3(b), 4(a), but there is no dispute that\n§2255 proceedings are “collateral,” see, e.g., Massaro v.\nUnited States, 538 U. S. 500, 504 (2003) (describing §2255\nproceedings as “collateral”); Daniels v. United States, 532\nU. S. 374, 379 (2001) (same).7\n——————\n   7 In other contexts not relevant here, there has been some confusion\n\nover whether §2255 proceedings are civil or criminal in nature. See,\ne.g., Postconviction Remedies §3:5, p. 251 (2010) (“[T]here is a dispute\nover whether the [§2255] motion initiates an independent civil action\nor, instead, is merely a further step in the criminal prosecution”); 3 C.\nWright & S. Welling, Federal Practice and Procedure §622 (4th ed.\n2011). We express no opinion on this question.\n                 Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Moreover, the methods of filing for postconviction or\ncollateral review vary among the States. In the District of\nColumbia and fourteen States, the principal postconviction\nremedy is part of the original case; in other States, it is\nnot. 1 Wilkes, State Postconviction Remedies and Relief\nHandbook §1:3, at 6–7. Given the States’ “different forms\nof collateral review,” Duncan, 533 U. S., at 177, the ap\nplication of AEDPA’s tolling provision should not turn\non such formalities. See ibid. (“Congress may have re\nfrained from exclusive reliance on the term ‘post-conviction’\nso as to leave no doubt that the tolling provision applies\nto all types of state collateral review available after a\nconviction”).\n  We thus define “collateral review” according to its ordi\nnary meaning: It refers to judicial review that occurs in a\nproceeding outside of the direct review process.\n                        *    *   *\n   For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nis affirmed.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 562 U.
