Argued January 19, 2011—Decided March 29, 2011\nSection 340B of the Public Health Services Act imposes ceilings on\n  prices drug manufacturers may charge for medications sold to speci\n  fied health care facilities (340B or covered entities), dominantly, local\n  providers of medical care for the poor. The §340B ceiling-price pro\n  gram (340B Program) is superintended by the Health Resources and\n  Services Administration (HRSA), part of the Department of Health\n  and Human Services (HHS). It is tied to the earlier-enacted, much\n  larger Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, under which manufacturers\n  gain Medicaid coverage for their drugs. To qualify for participation\n  in this program, a manufacturer must enter into a standardized\n  agreement with HHS undertaking to provide rebates to States on\n  their Medicaid drug purchases. The amount of the rebates depends\n  on a manufacturer’s “average” and “best” prices, as defined by legisla\n  tion and regulation. The 340B Program, like the Medicaid Rebate\n  Program, uses a form contract as an opt-in mechanism. The 340B\n  Program also draws on the larger scheme’s pricing methodology. In\n  the 340B Program’s contract, called the Pharmaceutical Pricing\n  Agreement (PPA), manufacturers agree to charge covered entities no\n  more than predetermined ceiling prices, derived from the “average”\n  and “best” prices and rebates calculated under the Medicaid Rebate\n  Program.\n     HRSA may require a manufacturer who overcharges a covered en\n  tity to reimburse that entity. HRSA may also terminate the manu\n  facturer’s PPA, which terminates as well the manufacturer’s eligibil\n  ity for Medicaid coverage of its drugs. Currently, HRSA handles\n  overcharge complaints through informal procedures, but the 2010 Pa\n  tient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) directs the Secre\n2            ASTRA USA, INC. v. SANTA CLARA COUNTY\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    tary to develop formal procedures. Once those procedures are in\n    place, HRSA will reach an “administrative resolution,” which will be\n    subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act\n    (APA). In addition to authorizing compensation awards to over\n    charged entities, the PPACA provides for the imposition of monetary\n    penalties payable to the Government.\n       Respondent Santa Clara County (County), operator of several 340B\n    entities, filed suit against Astra and eight other pharmaceutical com\n    panies, alleging that they were overcharging 340B entities in viola\n    tion of the PPAs. Asserting that 340B entities are the PPAs’ in\n    tended beneficiaries, the County sought compensatory damages for\n    breach of contract. The District Court dismissed the complaint, con\n    cluding that the PPAs conferred no enforceable rights on 340B enti\n    ties. Reversing, the Ninth Circuit held that, while 340B entities have\n    no right to sue under the statute, they could proceed against drug\n    manufacturers as third-party beneficiaries of the PPAs.\nHeld: Suits by 340B entities to enforce ceiling-price contracts running\n between drug manufacturers and the Secretary of HHS are incom\n patible with the statutory regime. As the County has conceded, cov\n ered entities have no right of action under §340B itself. Congress\n vested authority to oversee compliance with the 340B Program in\n HHS and assigned no auxiliary enforcement role to covered entities.\n Nonetheless, the County maintains that the PPAs are contracts en\n forceable by covered entities as third-party beneficiaries. This argu\n ment overlooks that the PPAs simply incorporate statutory obliga\n tions and record the manufacturers’ agreement to abide by them.\n The agreements have no negotiable terms. Like the Medicaid Rebate\n Program agreements, the PPAs provide the means by which drug\n manufacturers opt into the statutory scheme. A third-party suit to\n enforce an HHS-drug manufacturer agreement, therefore, is in es\n sence a suit to enforce the statute itself. Telling in this regard, the\n County based its suit on allegations that the manufacturers charged\n more than the §340B ceiling price, not that they violated an inde\n pendent substantive obligation arising from the PPAs.\n    The Ninth Circuit reasoned that suits like the County’s would\n spread the enforcement burden instead of placing it entirely on the\n Government. But spreading the enforcement burden is hardly what\n Congress contemplated when it made HHS administrator of the in\n terdependent Medicaid Rebate Program and 340B Program. Suits by\n 340B entities would undermine the agency’s efforts to administer\n these two programs harmoniously and uniformly. Notably, the Medi\n caid Rebate Program’s statute prohibits HHS from disclosing pricing\n information that could reveal the prices a manufacturer charges for\n its drugs. Had Congress meant to leave open the prospect of third\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

But\n  Congress did not respond to the reports of lax enforcement by invit\n  ing 340B entities to launch lawsuits. Instead, Congress opted to\n  strengthen and formalize HRSA’s enforcement authority, to make the\n  new adjudicative framework the proper remedy for covered entities’\n  complaints, and to render the agency’s resolution of those complaints\n  binding, subject to judicial review under the APA.

S. C. A. §256b (Oct. 2010 Supp.), imposes ceilings on\nprices drug manufacturers may charge for medications\nsold to specified health care facilities. Those facilities,\nhere called “340B” or “covered” entities, include public\nhospitals and community health centers, many of them\nproviders of safety-net services to the poor. The §340B\nceiling-price program (340B Program) is superintended by\nthe Health Resources and Services Administration\n(HRSA), a unit of the Department of Health and Human\nServices (HHS). Drug manufacturers opt into the 340B\nProgram by signing a form Pharmaceutical Pricing\nAgreement (PPA) used nationwide. PPAs are not transac­\ntional, bargained-for contracts. They are uniform agree­\nments that recite the responsibilities §340B imposes,\nrespectively, on drug manufacturers and the Secretary of\nHHS. Manufacturers’ eligibility to participate in state\nMedicaid programs is conditioned on their entry into PPAs\nfor covered drugs purchased by 340B entities.\n   It is conceded that Congress authorized no private right\n2        ASTRA USA, INC. v. SANTA CLARA COUNTY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof action under §340B for covered entities who claim they\nhave been charged prices exceeding the statutory ceiling.\nThis case presents the question whether 340B entities,\nthough accorded no right to sue for overcharges under the\nstatute itself, may nonetheless sue allegedly overcharging\nmanufacturers as third-party beneficiaries of the PPAs to\nwhich the manufacturers subscribed. We hold that suits\nby 340B entities to enforce ceiling-price contracts running\nbetween drug manufacturers and the Secretary of HHS\nare incompatible with the statutory regime.\n   Congress placed the Secretary (acting through her\ndesignate, HRSA) in control of §340B’s drug-price pre­\nscriptions. That control could not be maintained were\npotentially thousands of covered entities permitted to\nbring suits alleging errors in manufacturers’ price calcula­\ntions. If 340B entities may not sue under the statute, it\nwould make scant sense to allow them to sue on a form\ncontract implementing the statute, setting out terms\nidentical to those contained in the statute. Though labeled\ndifferently, suits to enforce §340B and suits to enforce\nPPAs are in substance one and the same. Their treat­\nment, therefore, must be the same, “[n]o matter the cloth­\ning in which [340B entities] dress their claims.” Tenet v.\nDoe, 544 U.

To enable HHS to calcu-\nlate the rebate rate for each drug, manufacturers submit\nthe relevant data to HHS on a quarterly basis. §1396r–\n8(b)(3). With exceptions set out in the legislation, HHS is\nprohibited from disclosing the submitted information “in a\nform which discloses the identity of a specific manufac­\nturer . . .

See §256b(a); §1396r–8(a)(1). The 340B Pro­\ngram, like the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, employs a\nform contract as an opt-in mechanism.

The County styled its suit a class action on behalf\nof both 340B entities in California and the counties that\nfund those entities. Asserting that the 340B entities and\nthe counties that fund them are the intended beneficiaries\nof the PPAs, the County sought compensatory damages for\nthe pharmaceutical companies’ breach of contract.\n   The District Court dismissed the complaint, concluding\nthat the PPAs conferred no enforceable rights on 340B\nentities. Reversing the District Court’s judgment, the\nNinth Circuit held that covered entities, although they\nhave no right to sue under the statute, could maintain the\naction as third-party beneficiaries of the PPAs. 588 F. 3d\n1237, 1241 (2009).\n   We granted certiorari, 561 U.

S. 275, 286 (2001).\nCongress vested authority to oversee compliance with the\n340B Program in HHS and assigned no auxiliary enforce­\nment role to covered entities.\n   Notwithstanding its inability to assert a statutory right\nof action, the County maintains that the PPAs implement­\ning the 340B Program are agreements enforceable by\ncovered entities as third-party beneficiaries. A nonparty\nbecomes legally entitled to a benefit promised in a\ncontract, the County recognizes, only if the contracting\nparties so intend. Brief for Respondent 31 (citing Re­\nstatement (Second) of Contracts §302(1)(b) (1979)). The\nPPAs “specifically nam[e]” covered entities as the recipi­\nents of discounted drugs, the County observes; indeed the\nvery object of the agreements is to ensure that those enti­\nties would be “charge[d] . . . no more than the ceiling\nprice.” Brief for Respondent 33. When the Government\nuses a contract to secure a benefit, the County urges, the\nintended recipient acquires a right to the benefit enforce­\nable under federal common law. Id., at 30. But see 9 J.\nMurray, Corbin on Contracts §45.6, p. 92 (rev. ed. 2007)\n(“The distinction between an intention to benefit a third\nparty and an intention that the third party should have\nthe right to enforce that intention is emphasized where\nthe promisee is a governmental entity.”).\n   The County’s argument overlooks that the PPAs simply\nincorporate statutory obligations and record the manufac­\nturers’ agreement to abide by them. The form agree­\nments, composed by HHS, contain no negotiable terms.\nLike the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program agreements, see\nsupra, at 3, the 340B Program agreements serve as the\nmeans by which drug manufacturers opt into the statutory\nscheme. A third-party suit to enforce an HHS-drug manu­\nfacturer agreement, therefore, is in essence a suit to en­\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

The absence of a private right to\nenforce the statutory ceiling price obligations would be\nrendered meaningless if 340B entities could overcome that\nobstacle by suing to enforce the contract’s ceiling price\nobligations instead. The statutory and contractual obliga­\ntions, in short, are one and the same. See Grochowski v.\nPhoenix Construction, 318 F. 3d 80, 86 (CA2 2003) (when\na government contract confirms a statutory obligation, “a\nthird-party private contract action [to enforce that obliga­\ntion] would be inconsistent with . . . the legislative scheme\n. . . to the same extent as would a cause of action directly\nunder the statute” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n    Telling in this regard, the County based its suit on\nallegations that the manufacturers charged more than the\n§340B ceiling price, see, e.g., Third Amended Complaint in\nNo. 3:05–cv–03740 (ND Cal.), ¶1, 65, not that they vio­\nlated any independent substantive obligation arising only\nfrom the PPAs.4 Repeatedly, the County acknowledged\nthat §340B is the source of the contractual term allegedly\nbreached. See, e.g., id., ¶28 (“[Section] 340B requires\npharmaceutical manufacturers to ensure that §340B\nParticipants pay no more than the ‘ceiling price’ . . . for\nany pharmaceutical product.”); id., ¶36 (“Under both\n§340B and the PPA, [drug manufacturers] are required to\nensure that the §340B Participants . . . pay no more for\nany product than the §340B ceiling price.”).\n——————\n  4 Whether   a contracting agency may authorize third-party suits to\nenforce a Government contract is not at issue in this case. Cf. Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 22. We can infer no such authorization\nwhere a contract simply incorporates statutorily required terms and\notherwise fails to demonstrate any intent to allow beneficiaries to en­\nforce those terms. Permitting such a suit, it is evident, would “allo[w]\nthird parties to circumvent Congress’s decision not to permit private\nenforcement of the statute.” Id., at 23–24; cf. Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae in No. 09–15216 (CA9), p. 21 (“In drafting and entering\ninto [PPAs], HHS never imagined that a 340B entity could bring a\nthird-party beneficiary lawsuit like [the County]’s.”).\n8          ASTRA USA, INC. v.

With HHS unable to hold the control rein, the\nrisk of conflicting adjudications would be substantial.\n   As earlier noted, see supra, at 3, the Medicaid Rebate\nProgram’s statute prohibits HHS from disclosing pricing\ninformation in a form that could reveal the prices a manu­\nfacturer charges for drugs it produces. §1396r–8(b)(3)(D).7\nThis ban on disclosure is a further indication of the in­\ncompatibility of private suits with the statute Congress\nenacted. If Congress meant to leave open the prospect of\nthird-party beneficiary suits by 340B entities, it likely\nwould not have barred the potential suitors from obtaining\nthe very information necessary to determine whether their\nasserted rights have been violated.8\n   It is true, as the Ninth Circuit observed, that HHS’s\n——————\n   6 Because the Ninth Circuit focused on the 340B Program in isolation,\n\nit failed to recognize that the interests of States under the Medicaid\nDrug Rebate Program and covered entities under the 340B Program\nmay conflict. For example, “average” prices are used both to set the\namount manufacturers must pay in Medicaid rebates and to establish\n§340B ceiling prices. §1396r–8(c); §256b(a)(1). Typically, the lower the\n“average” price, the lower a product’s price to a 340B entity. Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae in No. 09–15216, p. 31. But the higher\nthe “average” price, the more a State Medicaid agency typically receives\nin rebates from the manufacturers. Ibid.

Courts as\nfirst-line decisionmakers are not similarly equipped to deal with the\nwhole picture.\n   7 HHS interprets this provision, the United States informs us, as pro­\n\nhibiting the agency from disclosing to covered entities the ceiling prices\ncalculated based on information submitted by the manufacturers.

Argued January 19, 2011—Decided March 29, 2011\nSection 340B of the Public Health Services Act imposes ceilings on\n  prices drug manufacturers may charge for medications sold to speci\n  fied health care facilities (340B or covered entities), dominantly, local\n  providers of medical care for the poor. The §340B ceiling-price pro\n  gram (340B Program) is superintended by the Health Resources and\n  Services Administration (HRSA), part of the Department of Health\n  and Human Services (HHS). It is tied to the earlier-enacted, much\n  larger Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, under which manufacturers\n  gain Medicaid coverage for their drugs. To qualify for participation\n  in this program, a manufacturer must enter into a standardized\n  agreement with HHS undertaking to provide rebates to States on\n  their Medicaid drug purchases. The amount of the rebates depends\n  on a manufacturer’s “average” and “best” prices, as defined by legisla\n  tion and regulation. The 340B Program, like the Medicaid Rebate\n  Program, uses a form contract as an opt-in mechanism. The 340B\n  Program also draws on the larger scheme’s pricing methodology. In\n  the 340B Program’s contract, called the Pharmaceutical Pricing\n  Agreement (PPA), manufacturers agree to charge covered entities no\n  more than predetermined ceiling prices, derived from the “average”\n  and “best” prices and rebates calculated under the Medicaid Rebate\n  Program.\n     HRSA may require a manufacturer who overcharges a covered en\n  tity to reimburse that entity. HRSA may also terminate the manu\n  facturer’s PPA, which terminates as well the manufacturer’s eligibil\n  ity for Medicaid coverage of its drugs. Currently, HRSA handles\n  overcharge complaints through informal procedures, but the 2010 Pa\n  tient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) directs the Secre\n2            ASTRA USA, INC. v. SANTA CLARA COUNTY\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    tary to develop formal procedures. Once those procedures are in\n    place, HRSA will reach an “administrative resolution,” which will be\n    subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act\n    (APA). In addition to authorizing compensation awards to over\n    charged entities, the PPACA provides for the imposition of monetary\n    penalties payable to the Government.\n       Respondent Santa Clara County (County), operator of several 340B\n    entities, filed suit against Astra and eight other pharmaceutical com\n    panies, alleging that they were overcharging 340B entities in viola\n    tion of the PPAs. Asserting that 340B entities are the PPAs’ in\n    tended beneficiaries, the County sought compensatory damages for\n    breach of contract. The District Court dismissed the complaint, con\n    cluding that the PPAs conferred no enforceable rights on 340B enti\n    ties. Reversing, the Ninth Circuit held that, while 340B entities have\n    no right to sue under the statute, they could proceed against drug\n    manufacturers as third-party beneficiaries of the PPAs.\nHeld: Suits by 340B entities to enforce ceiling-price contracts running\n between drug manufacturers and the Secretary of HHS are incom\n patible with the statutory regime. As the County has conceded, cov\n ered entities have no right of action under §340B itself. Congress\n vested authority to oversee compliance with the 340B Program in\n HHS and assigned no auxiliary enforcement role to covered entities.\n Nonetheless, the County maintains that the PPAs are contracts en\n forceable by covered entities as third-party beneficiaries. This argu\n ment overlooks that the PPAs simply incorporate statutory obliga\n tions and record the manufacturers’ agreement to abide by them.\n The agreements have no negotiable terms. Like the Medicaid Rebate\n Program agreements, the PPAs provide the means by which drug\n manufacturers opt into the statutory scheme. A third-party suit to\n enforce an HHS-drug manufacturer agreement, therefore, is in es\n sence a suit to enforce the statute itself. Telling in this regard, the\n County based its suit on allegations that the manufacturers charged\n more than the §340B ceiling price, not that they violated an inde\n pendent substantive obligation arising from the PPAs.\n    The Ninth Circuit reasoned that suits like the County’s would\n spread the enforcement burden instead of placing it entirely on the\n Government. But spreading the enforcement burden is hardly what\n Congress contemplated when it made HHS administrator of the in\n terdependent Medicaid Rebate Program and 340B Program. Suits by\n 340B entities would undermine the agency’s efforts to administer\n these two programs harmoniously and uniformly. Notably, the Medi\n caid Rebate Program’s statute prohibits HHS from disclosing pricing\n information that could reveal the prices a manufacturer charges for\n its drugs.

But\n  Congress did not respond to the reports of lax enforcement by invit\n  ing 340B entities to launch lawsuits. Instead, Congress opted to\n  strengthen and formalize HRSA’s enforcement authority, to make the\n  new adjudicative framework the proper remedy for covered entities’\n  complaints, and to render the agency’s resolution of those complaints\n  binding, subject to judicial review under the APA.

S. C. A. §256b (Oct. 2010 Supp.), imposes ceilings on\nprices drug manufacturers may charge for medications\nsold to specified health care facilities. Those facilities,\nhere called “340B” or “covered” entities, include public\nhospitals and community health centers, many of them\nproviders of safety-net services to the poor. The §340B\nceiling-price program (340B Program) is superintended by\nthe Health Resources and Services Administration\n(HRSA), a unit of the Department of Health and Human\nServices (HHS). Drug manufacturers opt into the 340B\nProgram by signing a form Pharmaceutical Pricing\nAgreement (PPA) used nationwide. PPAs are not transac­\ntional, bargained-for contracts. They are uniform agree­\nments that recite the responsibilities §340B imposes,\nrespectively, on drug manufacturers and the Secretary of\nHHS. Manufacturers’ eligibility to participate in state\nMedicaid programs is conditioned on their entry into PPAs\nfor covered drugs purchased by 340B entities.\n   It is conceded that Congress authorized no private right\n2        ASTRA USA, INC. v. SANTA CLARA COUNTY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof action under §340B for covered entities who claim they\nhave been charged prices exceeding the statutory ceiling.\nThis case presents the question whether 340B entities,\nthough accorded no right to sue for overcharges under the\nstatute itself, may nonetheless sue allegedly overcharging\nmanufacturers as third-party beneficiaries of the PPAs to\nwhich the manufacturers subscribed. We hold that suits\nby 340B entities to enforce ceiling-price contracts running\nbetween drug manufacturers and the Secretary of HHS\nare incompatible with the statutory regime.\n   Congress placed the Secretary (acting through her\ndesignate, HRSA) in control of §340B’s drug-price pre­\nscriptions. That control could not be maintained were\npotentially thousands of covered entities permitted to\nbring suits alleging errors in manufacturers’ price calcula­\ntions. If 340B entities may not sue under the statute, it\nwould make scant sense to allow them to sue on a form\ncontract implementing the statute, setting out terms\nidentical to those contained in the statute. Though labeled\ndifferently, suits to enforce §340B and suits to enforce\nPPAs are in substance one and the same. Their treat­\nment, therefore, must be the same, “[n]o matter the cloth­\ning in which [340B entities] dress their claims.” Tenet v.\nDoe, 544 U.

To enable HHS to calcu-\nlate the rebate rate for each drug, manufacturers submit\nthe relevant data to HHS on a quarterly basis. §1396r–\n8(b)(3). With exceptions set out in the legislation, HHS is\nprohibited from disclosing the submitted information “in a\nform which discloses the identity of a specific manufac­\nturer . . .

See §256b(a); §1396r–8(a)(1). The 340B Pro­\ngram, like the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, employs a\nform contract as an opt-in mechanism.

A nonparty\nbecomes legally entitled to a benefit promised in a\ncontract, the County recognizes, only if the contracting\nparties so intend. Brief for Respondent 31 (citing Re­\nstatement (Second) of Contracts §302(1)(b) (1979)). The\nPPAs “specifically nam[e]” covered entities as the recipi­\nents of discounted drugs, the County observes; indeed the\nvery object of the agreements is to ensure that those enti­\nties would be “charge[d] . . . no more than the ceiling\nprice.” Brief for Respondent 33. When the Government\nuses a contract to secure a benefit, the County urges, the\nintended recipient acquires a right to the benefit enforce­\nable under federal common law. Id., at 30. But see 9 J.\nMurray, Corbin on Contracts §45.6, p. 92 (rev. ed. 2007)\n(“The distinction between an intention to benefit a third\nparty and an intention that the third party should have\nthe right to enforce that intention is emphasized where\nthe promisee is a governmental entity.”).\n   The County’s argument overlooks that the PPAs simply\nincorporate statutory obligations and record the manufac­\nturers’ agreement to abide by them. The form agree­\nments, composed by HHS, contain no negotiable terms.\nLike the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program agreements, see\nsupra, at 3, the 340B Program agreements serve as the\nmeans by which drug manufacturers opt into the statutory\nscheme. A third-party suit to enforce an HHS-drug manu­\nfacturer agreement, therefore, is in essence a suit to en­\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

The absence of a private right to\nenforce the statutory ceiling price obligations would be\nrendered meaningless if 340B entities could overcome that\nobstacle by suing to enforce the contract’s ceiling price\nobligations instead. The statutory and contractual obliga­\ntions, in short, are one and the same. See Grochowski v.\nPhoenix Construction, 318 F. 3d 80, 86 (CA2 2003) (when\na government contract confirms a statutory obligation, “a\nthird-party private contract action [to enforce that obliga­\ntion] would be inconsistent with . . . the legislative scheme\n. . . to the same extent as would a cause of action directly\nunder the statute” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n    Telling in this regard, the County based its suit on\nallegations that the manufacturers charged more than the\n§340B ceiling price, see, e.g., Third Amended Complaint in\nNo. 3:05–cv–03740 (ND Cal.), ¶1, 65, not that they vio­\nlated any independent substantive obligation arising only\nfrom the PPAs.4 Repeatedly, the County acknowledged\nthat §340B is the source of the contractual term allegedly\nbreached. See, e.g., id., ¶28 (“[Section] 340B requires\npharmaceutical manufacturers to ensure that §340B\nParticipants pay no more than the ‘ceiling price’ . . . for\nany pharmaceutical product.”); id., ¶36 (“Under both\n§340B and the PPA, [drug manufacturers] are required to\nensure that the §340B Participants . . . pay no more for\nany product than the §340B ceiling price.”).\n——————\n  4 Whether   a contracting agency may authorize third-party suits to\nenforce a Government contract is not at issue in this case. Cf. Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 22. We can infer no such authorization\nwhere a contract simply incorporates statutorily required terms and\notherwise fails to demonstrate any intent to allow beneficiaries to en­\nforce those terms. Permitting such a suit, it is evident, would “allo[w]\nthird parties to circumvent Congress’s decision not to permit private\nenforcement of the statute.” Id., at 23–24; cf. Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae in No. 09–15216 (CA9), p. 21 (“In drafting and entering\ninto [PPAs], HHS never imagined that a 340B entity could bring a\nthird-party beneficiary lawsuit like [the County]’s.”).\n8          ASTRA USA, INC. v. SANTA CLARA COUNTY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Ninth Circuit determined that “[p]ermitting covered\nentities to sue as intended beneficiaries of the PPA is . . .\nwholly compatible with the Section 340B program’s objec­\ntives” to ensure “that drug companies comply with their\nobligations under the program and provide [the required]\ndiscounts.” 588 F. 3d, at 1251. Suits like the County’s,\nthe Court of Appeals reasoned, would spread the enforce­\nment burden instead of placing it “[entirely] on the gov­\nernment.” Ibid. (citing Price v. Pierce, 823 F. 2d 1114,\n1121 (CA7 1987)). But spreading the enforcement burden,\nthe United States stressed, both in the Ninth Circuit and\nin this Court, is hardly what Congress contemplated when\nit “centralized enforcement in the government.” Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 32; see Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae in No. 09–15216 (CA9), p. 13\n(County’s challenge is at odds with Congress’ unitary\nadministrative and enforcement scheme).5\n   Congress made HHS administrator of both the Medicaid\nDrug Rebate Program and the 340B Program, the United\nStates observed, Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n33–34, and “[t]he interdependent nature of the two pro­\ngrams’ requirements means that an adjudication of rights\nunder one program must proceed with an eye towards any\nimplications for the other,” id., at 34. Far from assisting\nHHS, suits by 340B entities would undermine the agency’s\nefforts to administer both Medicaid and §340B harmoni­\n\n——————\n  5 The County notes that in In re Pharmaceutical Industry Average\n\nWholesale Price Litigation, 263 F. Supp. 2d 172 (Mass. 2003), the\nUnited States urged that the statute establishing the Medicaid Drug\nRebate Program, §1396r–8, does not preempt States from maintaining\nstate-law fraud claims based on fraudulent reporting of “best prices” to\nHHS. Brief for Respondent 22–23. See Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae in No. 1:01–cv–12257 (D Mass.), pp. 6–9 (observing that\nStates make their own payments to manufacturers and have long\nplayed a role in identifying and prosecuting Medicaid fraud). We take\nno position on this issue.\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

With HHS unable to hold the control rein, the\nrisk of conflicting adjudications would be substantial.\n   As earlier noted, see supra, at 3, the Medicaid Rebate\nProgram’s statute prohibits HHS from disclosing pricing\ninformation in a form that could reveal the prices a manu­\nfacturer charges for drugs it produces. §1396r–8(b)(3)(D).7\nThis ban on disclosure is a further indication of the in­\ncompatibility of private suits with the statute Congress\nenacted. If Congress meant to leave open the prospect of\nthird-party beneficiary suits by 340B entities, it likely\nwould not have barred the potential suitors from obtaining\nthe very information necessary to determine whether their\nasserted rights have been violated.8\n   It is true, as the Ninth Circuit observed, that HHS’s\n——————\n   6 Because the Ninth Circuit focused on the 340B Program in isolation,\n\nit failed to recognize that the interests of States under the Medicaid\nDrug Rebate Program and covered entities under the 340B Program\nmay conflict. For example, “average” prices are used both to set the\namount manufacturers must pay in Medicaid rebates and to establish\n§340B ceiling prices. §1396r–8(c); §256b(a)(1). Typically, the lower the\n“average” price, the lower a product’s price to a 340B entity. Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae in No. 09–15216, p. 31. But the higher\nthe “average” price, the more a State Medicaid agency typically receives\nin rebates from the manufacturers. Ibid. HHS can use its expertise to\nascertain and balance the competing interests. Id., at 31–32. Courts as\nfirst-line decisionmakers are not similarly equipped to deal with the\nwhole picture.\n   7 HHS interprets this provision, the United States informs us, as pro­\n\nhibiting the agency from disclosing to covered entities the ceiling prices\ncalculated based on information submitted by the manufacturers. Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 28.\n   8 Going forward, the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,\n\nPub. L. 111–148, 124 Stat. 119, in conjunction with the new adminis­\ntrative adjudication process directed by the Act, will require HHS to\ngive covered entities access to some of the information submitted by\nmanufacturers. Id., at 826, 42 U. S. C. A. §256b(d)(3)(B)(iii).\n10        ASTRA USA, INC. v. SANTA CLARA COUNTY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nOffice of the Inspector General (OIG) has published re­\nports finding that “HRSA lacks the oversight mechanisms\nand authority to ensure that [covered] entities pay at or\nbelow the . . . ceiling price.” 588 F. 3d, at 1242 (quoting\nOIG, D. Levinson, Deficiencies in the Oversight of the\n340B Drug Pricing Program ii (OEI–05–02–00072, Oct.\n2005)). See also 588 F. 3d, at 1242–1243 (citing OIG, D.\nLevinson, Review of 340B Prices 11 (OEI–05–02–00073,\nJuly 2006) (estimating that covered entities overpaid $3.9\nmillion in June 2005 alone)). But Congress did not re­\nspond to the reports of inadequate HRSA enforcement by\ninviting 340B entities to launch lawsuits in district courts\nacross the country. Instead, in the PPACA, Congress\ndirected HRSA to create a formal dispute resolution pro­\ncedure, institute refund and civil penalty systems, and\nperform audits of manufacturers. 124 Stat. 823–827, 42\nU. S. C. A. §256b(d). Congress thus opted to strengthen\nand formalize HRSA’s enforcement authority, to make the\nnew adjudicative framework the proper remedy for cov­\nered entities complaining of “overcharges and other viola­\ntions of the discounted pricing requirements,” id., at 823,\n42 U. S. C. A. §256b(d)(1)(A), and to render the agency’s\nresolution of covered entities’ complaints binding, subject\nto judicial review under the APA, id., at 827, 42 U. S. C.
