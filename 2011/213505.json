Argued October 6, 2010—Decided March 29, 2011\nPetitioner the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office concedes that,\n  in prosecuting respondent Thompson for attempted armed robbery,\n  prosecutors violated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, by failing to\n  disclose a crime lab report. Because of his robbery conviction,\n  Thompson elected not to testify at his later murder trial and was\n  convicted. A month before his scheduled execution, the lab report\n  was discovered. A reviewing court vacated both convictions, and\n  Thompson was found not guilty in a retrial on the murder charge. He\n  then filed suit against the district attorney’s office under 42 U. S. C.\n  §1983, alleging, inter alia, that the Brady violation was caused by the\n  office’s deliberate indifference to an obvious need to train prosecutors\n  to avoid such constitutional violations. The district court held that,\n  to prove deliberate indifference, Thompson did not need to show a\n  pattern of similar Brady violations when he could demonstrate that\n  the need for training was obvious. The jury found the district attor\n  ney’s office liable for failure to train and awarded Thompson dam\n  ages. The Fifth Circuit affirmed by an equally divided court.\nHeld: A district attorney’s office may not be held liable under §1983 for\n  failure to train its prosecutors based on a single Brady violation. Pp.\n  6–20.\n     (a) Plaintiffs seeking to impose §1983 liability on local governments\n  must prove that their injury was caused by “action pursuant to offi\n  cial municipal policy,” which includes the decisions of a government’s\n  lawmakers, the acts of its policymaking officials, and practices so\n  persistent and widespread as to practically have the force of law.\n  Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 691. A\n  local government’s decision not to train certain employees about their\n2                        CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    legal duty to avoid violating citizens’ rights may rise to the level of an\n    official government policy for §1983 purposes, but the failure to train\n    must amount to “deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with\n    whom the [untrained employees] come into contact.” Canton v. Har\n    ris, 489 U. S. 378, 388. Deliberate indifference in this context re\n    quires proof that city policymakers disregarded the “known or obvi\n    ous consequence” that a particular omission in their training\n    program would cause city employees to violate citizens’ constitutional\n    rights. Board of Comm’rs of Bryan Cty. v. Brown, 520 U. S. 397, 410.\n    Pp. 6–9.\n       (b) A pattern of similar constitutional violations by untrained em\n    ployees is “ordinarily necessary” to demonstrate deliberate indiffer\n    ence. Bryan Cty., supra, at 409. Without notice that a course of\n    training is deficient, decisionmakers can hardly be said to have delib\n    erately chosen a training program that will cause violations of consti\n    tutional rights. Thompson does not contend that he proved a pattern\n    of similar Brady violations, and four reversals by Louisiana courts for\n    dissimilar Brady violations in the 10 years before the robbery trial\n    could not have put the district attorney’s office on notice of the need\n    for specific training. Pp. 9–10.\n       (c) Thompson mistakenly relies on the “single-incident” liability\n    hypothesized in Canton, contending that the Brady violation in his\n    case was the “obvious” consequence of failing to provide specific\n    Brady training and that this “obviousness” showing can substitute\n    for the pattern of violations ordinarily necessary to establish munici\n    pal culpability. In Canton, the Court theorized that if a city armed\n    its police force and deployed them into the public to capture fleeing\n    felons without training the officers in the constitutional limitation on\n    the use of deadly force, the failure to train could reflect the city’s de\n    liberate indifference to the highly predictable consequence, namely,\n    violations of constitutional rights. Failure to train prosecutors in\n    their Brady obligations does not fall within the narrow range of Can\n    ton’s hypothesized single-incident liability. The obvious need for spe\n    cific legal training present in Canton’s scenario—police academy ap\n    plicants are unlikely to be familiar with constitutional constraints on\n    deadly force and, absent training, cannot obtain that knowledge—is\n    absent here. Attorneys are trained in the law and equipped with the\n    tools to interpret and apply legal principles, understand constitu\n    tional limits, and exercise legal judgment. They receive training be\n    fore entering the profession, must usually satisfy continuing educa\n    tion requirements, often train on the job with more experienced\n    attorneys, and must satisfy licensing standards and ongoing ethical\n    obligations. Prosecutors not only are equipped but are ethically\n    bound to know what Brady entails and to perform legal research\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  when they are uncertain. Thus, recurring constitutional violations\n  are not the “obvious consequence” of failing to provide prosecutors\n  with formal in-house training. The nuance of the allegedly necessary\n  training also distinguishes the case from the example in Canton.\n  Here, the prosecutors were familiar with the general Brady rule.\n  Thus, Thompson cannot rely on the lack of an ability to cope with\n  constitutional situations that underlies the Canton hypothetical, but\n  must assert that prosecutors were not trained about particular Brady\n  evidence or the specific scenario related to the violation in his case.\n  That sort of nuance simply cannot support an inference of deliberate\n  indifference here. Contrary to the holding below, it does not follow\n  that, because Brady has gray areas and some Brady decisions are dif\n  ficult, prosecutors will so obviously make wrong decisions that failing\n  to train them amounts, as it must, to “a decision by the city itself to\n  violate the Constitution.” Canton, 489 U.

CONNICK, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, ET AL., \n\n      PETITIONERS v. JOHN THOMPSON\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 29, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office now con\ncedes that, in prosecuting respondent John Thompson for\nattempted armed robbery, prosecutors failed to disclose\nevidence that should have been turned over to the defense\nunder Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). Thompson\nwas convicted. Because of that conviction Thompson\nelected not to testify in his own defense in his later trial\nfor murder, and he was again convicted. Thompson spent\n18 years in prison, including 14 years on death row. One\nmonth before Thompson’s scheduled execution, his inves\ntigator discovered the undisclosed evidence from his\narmed robbery trial. The reviewing court determined that\nthe evidence was exculpatory, and both of Thompson’s\nconvictions were vacated.\n   After his release from prison, Thompson sued petitioner\nHarry Connick, in his official capacity as the Orleans\nParish District Attorney, for damages under Rev. Stat.\n§1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983. Thompson alleged that Connick\nhad failed to train his prosecutors adequately about their\nduty to produce exculpatory evidence and that the lack of\n2                 CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntraining had caused the nondisclosure in Thompson’s rob\nbery case. The jury awarded Thompson $14 million,\nand the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed by\nan evenly divided en banc court. We granted certiorari to\ndecide whether a district attorney’s office may be held\nliable under §1983 for failure to train based on a single\nBrady violation. We hold that it cannot.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   In early 1985, John Thompson was charged with the\nmurder of Raymond T. Liuzza, Jr. in New Orleans. Pub\nlicity following the murder charge led the victims of an\nunrelated armed robbery to identify Thompson as their\nattacker. The district attorney charged Thompson with\nattempted armed robbery.\n   As part of the robbery investigation, a crime scene\ntechnician took from one of the victims’ pants a swatch of\nfabric stained with the robber’s blood. Approximately one\nweek before Thompson’s armed robbery trial, the swatch\nwas sent to the crime laboratory. Two days before the\ntrial, assistant district attorney Bruce Whittaker received\nthe crime lab’s report, which stated that the perpetrator\nhad blood type B. There is no evidence that the prosecu\ntors ever had Thompson’s blood tested or that they knew\nwhat his blood type was. Whittaker claimed he placed the\nreport on assistant district attorney James Williams’ desk,\nbut Williams denied seeing it. The report was never dis\nclosed to Thompson’s counsel.\n   Williams tried the armed robbery case with assistant\ndistrict attorney Gerry Deegan. On the first day of trial,\nDeegan checked all of the physical evidence in the case out\nof the police property room, including the blood-stained\nswatch. Deegan then checked all of the evidence but the\nswatch into the courthouse property room. The prosecu\ntors did not mention the swatch or the crime lab report at\n                   Cite as: 563 U.

Because\nof the armed robbery conviction, Thompson chose not to\ntestify in his own defense. He was convicted and sen\ntenced to death. State v.

The\nState scheduled Thompson’s execution for May 20, 1999.\n   In late April 1999, Thompson’s private investigator\ndiscovered the crime lab report from the armed robbery\ninvestigation in the files of the New Orleans Police Crime\nLaboratory. Thompson was tested and found to have\nblood type O, proving that the blood on the swatch was not\nhis. Thompson’s attorneys presented this evidence to the\ndistrict attorney’s office, which, in turn, moved to stay the\nexecution and vacate Thompson’s armed robbery convic\ntion.1 The Louisiana Court of Appeals then reversed\nThompson’s murder conviction, concluding that the armed\nrobbery conviction unconstitutionally deprived Thompson\nof his right to testify in his own defense at the murder\ntrial.

Following a disciplinary complaint by\nthe district attorney’s office, the Supreme Court of Louisiana repri\nmanded Riehlmann for failing to disclose Deegan’s admission earlier.\nIn re Riehlmann, 2004–0680 (La. 1/19/05), 891 So. 2d 1239.\n4                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nretried Thompson for Liuzza’s murder.2 The jury found\nhim not guilty.\n                               B\n   Thompson then brought this action against the district\nattorney’s office, Connick, Williams, and others, alleging\nthat their conduct caused him to be wrongfully convicted,\nincarcerated for 18 years, and nearly executed. The only\nclaim that proceeded to trial was Thompson’s claim under\n§1983 that the district attorney’s office had violated Brady\nby failing to disclose the crime lab report in his armed\nrobbery trial. See Brady, 373 U. S. 83. Thompson alleged\nliability under two theories: (1) the Brady violation was\ncaused by an unconstitutional policy of the district attor\nney’s office; and (2) the violation was caused by Connick’s\ndeliberate indifference to an obvious need to train the\nprosecutors in his office in order to avoid such constitu\ntional violations.\n   Before trial, Connick conceded that the failure to pro\nduce the crime lab report constituted a Brady violation.3\nSee Record EX608, EX880. Accordingly, the District Court\ninstructed the jury that the “only issue” was whether the\nnondisclosure was caused by either a policy, practice, or\ncustom of the district attorney’s office or a deliberately\nindifferent failure to train the office’s prosecutors. Record\n1615.\n   Although no prosecutor remembered any specific train\ning session regarding Brady prior to 1985, it was undis\nputed at trial that the prosecutors were familiar with the\n\n——————\n  2 Thompson testified in his own defense at the second trial and pre\n\nsented evidence suggesting that another man committed the murder.\nThat man, the government’s key witness at the first murder trial, had\ndied in the interval between the first and second trials.\n  3 Because Connick conceded that the failure to disclose the crime lab\n\nreport violated Brady, that question is not presented here, and we do\nnot address it.\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

Prosecutors testified that office policy was to\nturn crime lab reports and other scientific evidence over\nto the defense. They also testified that, after the discovery\nof the undisclosed crime lab report in 1999, prosecutors\ndisagreed about whether it had to be disclosed under\nBrady absent knowledge of Thompson’s blood type.\n   The jury rejected Thompson’s claim that an unconstitu\ntional office policy caused the Brady violation, but found\nthe district attorney’s office liable for failing to train the\nprosecutors. The jury awarded Thompson $14 million in\ndamages, and the District Court added more than $1\nmillion in attorney’s fees and costs.\n   After the verdict, Connick renewed his objection—which\nhe had raised on summary judgment—that he could not\nhave been deliberately indifferent to an obvious need for\nmore or different Brady training because there was no\nevidence that he was aware of a pattern of similar Brady\nviolations. The District Court rejected this argument for\nthe reasons that it had given in the summary judgment\norder. In that order, the court had concluded that a pat\ntern of violations is not necessary to prove deliberate\nindifference when the need for training is “so obvious.”\nNo. Civ.

Relying on Canton\nv. Harris, 489 U. S. 378 (1989), the court had held that\nThompson could demonstrate deliberate indifference by\nproving that “the DA’s office knew to a moral certainty\nthat assistan[t] [district attorneys] would acquire Brady\nmaterial, that without training it is not always obvious\nwhat Brady requires, and that withholding Brady mate\nrial will virtually always lead to a substantial violation of\nconstitutional rights.”4 App. to Pet. for Cert. 141a, 2005\n——————\n 4 The   District Court rejected Connick’s proposed deliberate indiffer\n6                    CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nWL 3541035, *13.\n   A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\naffirmed. The panel acknowledged that Thompson did not\npresent evidence of a pattern of similar Brady violations,\n553 F. 3d 836, 851 (2008), but held that Thompson did not\nneed to prove a pattern, id., at 854. According to the\npanel, Thompson demonstrated that Connick was on\nnotice of an obvious need for Brady training by presenting\nevidence “that attorneys, often fresh out of law school,\nwould undoubtedly be required to confront Brady issues\nwhile at the DA’s Office, that erroneous decisions regard\ning Brady evidence would result in serious constitutional\nviolations, that resolution of Brady issues was often un\nclear, and that training in Brady would have been help\nful.” 553 F. 3d, at 854.\n   The Court of Appeals sitting en banc vacated the panel\nopinion, granted rehearing, and divided evenly, thereby\naffirming the District Court. 578 F. 3d 293 (CA5 2009)\n(per curiam). In four opinions, the divided en banc court\ndisputed whether Thompson could establish municipal\nliability for failure to train the prosecutors based on the\nsingle Brady violation without proving a prior pattern of\nsimilar violations, and, if so, what evidence would make\nthat showing. We granted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                              II\n  The Brady violation conceded in this case occurred when\none or more of the four prosecutors involved with Thomp\nson’s armed robbery prosecution failed to disclose the\ncrime lab report to Thompson’s counsel. Under Thomp\nson’s failure-to-train theory, he bore the burden of proving\nboth (1) that Connick, the policymaker for the district\nattorney’s office, was deliberately indifferent to the need to\n——————\nence jury instruction—which would have required Thompson to prove a\npattern of similar violations—for the same reasons as the summary\njudgment motion.

Connick argues that he was entitled to judgment as\na matter of law because Thompson did not prove that he\nwas on actual or constructive notice of, and therefore\ndeliberately indifferent to, a need for more or different\nBrady training.

Thus, we do not address whether\nthe alleged training deficiency, or some other cause, was the “ ‘moving\nforce,’ ” Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378, 389 (1989) (quoting Monell v.\nNew York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 694 (1978), and\nPolk County v. Dodson, 454 U. S. 312, 326 (1981)), that “actually\ncaused” the failure to disclose the crime lab report, Canton, supra, at\n391.\n   The same cannot be said for the dissent, however. Affirming the\nverdict in favor of Thompson would require finding both that he proved\ndeliberate indifference and that he proved causation. Perhaps unsur\nprisingly, the dissent has not conducted the second step of the analysis,\nwhich would require showing that the failure to provide particular\ntraining (which the dissent never clearly identifies) “actually caused”\nthe flagrant—and quite possibly intentional—misconduct that occurred\nin this case. See post, at 21 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.) (assuming that,\n“[h]ad Brady’s importance been brought home to prosecutors,” the\nviolation at issue “surely” would not have occurred). The dissent\nbelieves that evidence that the prosecutors allegedly “misappre\nhen[ded]” Brady proves causation. Post, at 27, n. 20. Of course, if\nevidence of a need for training, by itself, were sufficient to prove that\nthe lack of training “actually caused” the violation at issue, no causa\ntion requirement would be necessary because every plaintiff who\nsatisfied the deliberate indifference requirement would necessarily\nsatisfy the causation requirement.\n8                  CONNICK v.

These are\n“action[s] for which the municipality is actually responsi\nble.” Pembaur, supra, at 479–480.\n  In limited circumstances, a local government’s decision\nnot to train certain employees about their legal duty to\navoid violating citizens’ rights may rise to the level of an\nofficial government policy for purposes of §1983. A mu\nnicipality’s culpability for a deprivation of rights is at its\nmost tenuous where a claim turns on a failure to train.\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

S. 808, 822–823\n(1985) (plurality opinion) (“[A] ‘policy’ of ‘inadequate train\ning’ ” is “far more nebulous, and a good deal further re\nmoved from the constitutional violation, than was the\npolicy in Monell”). To satisfy the statute, a municipality’s\nfailure to train its employees in a relevant respect must\namount to “deliberate indifference to the rights of persons\nwith whom the [untrained employees] come into contact.”\nCanton, 489 U. S., at 388. Only then “can such a short\ncoming be properly thought of as a city ‘policy or custom’\nthat is actionable under §1983.” Id., at 389.\n   “ ‘[D]eliberate indifference’ is a stringent standard of\nfault, requiring proof that a municipal actor disregarded a\nknown or obvious consequence of his action.” Bryan Cty.,\n520 U. S., at 410. Thus, when city policymakers are on\nactual or constructive notice that a particular omission in\ntheir training program causes city employees to violate\ncitizens’ constitutional rights, the city may be deemed\ndeliberately indifferent if the policymakers choose to\nretain that program. Id., at 407. The city’s “policy of\ninaction” in light of notice that its program will cause\nconstitutional violations “is the functional equivalent of a\ndecision by the city itself to violate the Constitution.”\nCanton, 489 U. S., at 395 (O’Connor, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part). A less stringent standard of fault\nfor a failure-to-train claim “would result in de facto re\nspondeat superior liability on municipalities . . . .” Id., at\n392; see also Pembaur, supra, at 483 (opinion of Brennan,\nJ.) (“[M]unicipal liability under §1983 attaches where—\nand only where—a deliberate choice to follow a course of\naction is made from among various alternatives by [the\nrelevant] officials . . .”).\n                            B\n  A pattern of similar constitutional violations by un\ntrained employees is “ordinarily necessary” to demonstrate\n10                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndeliberate indifference for purposes of failure to train.\nBryan Cty., 520 U. S., at 409. Policymakers’ “continued\nadherence to an approach that they know or should know\nhas failed to prevent tortious conduct by employees may\nestablish the conscious disregard for the consequences of\ntheir action—the ‘deliberate indifference’—necessary to\ntrigger municipal liability.” Id., at 407. Without notice\nthat a course of training is deficient in a particular re\nspect, decisionmakers can hardly be said to have deliber\nately chosen a training program that will cause violations\nof constitutional rights.\n   Although Thompson does not contend that he proved a\npattern of similar Brady violations, 553 F. 3d, at 851,\nvacated, 578 F. 3d 293 (en banc), he points out that, dur\ning the ten years preceding his armed robbery trial, Lou\nisiana courts had overturned four convictions because of\nBrady violations by prosecutors in Connick’s office.6 Those\nfour reversals could not have put Connick on notice that\nthe office’s Brady training was inadequate with respect to\nthe sort of Brady violation at issue here. None of those\ncases involved failure to disclose blood evidence, a crime\nlab report, or physical or scientific evidence of any kind.\nBecause those incidents are not similar to the violation at\nissue here, they could not have put Connick on notice that\nspecific training was necessary to avoid this constitutional\nviolation.7\n——————\n  6 Thompson    had every incentive at trial to attempt to establish a\npattern of similar violations, given that the jury instruction allowed\nthe jury to find deliberate indifference based on, among other things,\nprosecutors’ “history of mishandling” similar situations. Record 1619.\n   7 Thompson also asserts that this case is not about a “single incident”\n\nbecause up to four prosecutors may have been responsible for the\nnondisclosure of the crime lab report and, according to his allegations,\nwithheld additional evidence in his armed robbery and murder trials.\nBut contemporaneous or subsequent conduct cannot establish a pattern\nof violations that would provide “notice to the cit[y] and the opportunity\nto conform to constitutional dictates . . . .” Canton, 489 U.

He contends that\nthe Brady violation in his case was the “obvious” conse\nquence of failing to provide specific Brady training, and\nthat this showing of “obviousness” can substitute for the\npattern of violations ordinarily necessary to establish\nmunicipal culpability.\n   In Canton, the Court left open the possibility that, “in a\nnarrow range of circumstances,” a pattern of similar viola\ntions might not be necessary to show deliberate indiffer\nence. Bryan Cty., supra, at 409. The Court posed the\nhypothetical example of a city that arms its police force\nwith firearms and deploys the armed officers into the\npublic to capture fleeing felons without training the offi\ncers in the constitutional limitation on the use of deadly\nforce. Canton, supra, at 390, n. 10. Given the known\nfrequency with which police attempt to arrest fleeing\nfelons and the “predictability that an officer lacking spe\ncific tools to handle that situation will violate citizens’\nrights,” the Court theorized that a city’s decision not to\ntrain the officers about constitutional limits on the use of\ndeadly force could reflect the city’s deliberate indifference\nto the “highly predictable consequence,” namely, violations\nof constitutional rights. Bryan Cty., supra, at 409. The\nCourt sought not to foreclose the possibility, however rare,\nthat the unconstitutional consequences of failing to train\ncould be so patently obvious that a city could be liable\nunder §1983 without proof of a pre-existing pattern of\nviolations.\n—————— \n\n(O’Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Moreover, no \n\ncourt has ever found any of the other Brady violations that Thompson\n\nalleges occurred in his armed robbery and murder trials. \n\n12                CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Failure to train prosecutors in their Brady obligations\ndoes not fall within the narrow range of Canton’s hypothe\nsized single-incident liability. The obvious need for spe\ncific legal training that was present in the Canton scenario\nis absent here. Armed police must sometimes make split\nsecond decisions with life-or-death consequences. There is\nno reason to assume that police academy applicants are\nfamiliar with the constitutional constraints on the use of\ndeadly force. And, in the absence of training, there is no\nway for novice officers to obtain the legal knowledge they\nrequire. Under those circumstances there is an obvious\nneed for some form of training. In stark contrast, legal\n“[t]raining is what differentiates attorneys from average\npublic employees.” 578 F. 3d, at 304–305 (opinion of\nClement, J.).\n   Attorneys are trained in the law and equipped with the\ntools to interpret and apply legal principles, understand\nconstitutional limits, and exercise legal judgment. Before\nthey may enter the profession and receive a law license,\nall attorneys must graduate from law school or pass a\nsubstantive examination; attorneys in the vast majority of\njurisdictions must do both. See, e.g., La. State Bar Assn.\n(LSBA), Articles of Incorporation, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §37,\nch. 4, App., Art. 14, §7 (1988 West Supp.) (as amended\nthrough 1985). These threshold requirements are de\nsigned to ensure that all new attorneys have learned how\nto find, understand, and apply legal rules. Cf. United\nStates v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 658, 664 (1984) (noting\nthat the presumption “that the lawyer is competent to\nprovide the guiding hand that the defendant needs” ap\nplies even to young and inexperienced lawyers in their\nfirst jury trial and even when the case is complex).\n   Nor does professional training end at graduation. Most\njurisdictions require attorneys to satisfy continuing\neducation requirements. See, e.g., LSBA, Articles of In\ncorporation, Art. 16, Rule 1.1(b) (effective 1987); La. Sup.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCt. Rule XXX (effective 1988). Even those few jurisdic\ntions that do not impose mandatory continuing-education\nrequirements mandate that attorneys represent their\nclients competently and encourage attorneys to engage in\ncontinuing study and education. See, e.g., Mass. Rule\nProf. Conduct 1.1 and comment 6 (West 2006). Before\nLouisiana adopted continuing-education requirements, it\nimposed similar general competency requirements on its\nstate bar. LSBA, Articles of Incorporation, Art. 16, EC 1–\n1, 1–2, DR 6–101 (West 1974) (effective 1971).\n   Attorneys who practice with other attorneys, such as in\ndistrict attorney’s offices, also train on the job as they\nlearn from more experienced attorneys. For instance, here\nin the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office, junior\nprosecutors were trained by senior prosecutors who super\nvised them as they worked together to prepare cases for\ntrial, and trial chiefs oversaw the preparation of the cases.\nSenior attorneys also circulated court decisions and in\nstructional memoranda to keep the prosecutors abreast of\nrelevant legal developments.\n   In addition, attorneys in all jurisdictions must satisfy\ncharacter and fitness standards to receive a law license\nand are personally subject to an ethical regime designed to\nreinforce the profession’s standards. See, e.g., LSBA,\nArticles of Incorporation, Art. 14, §7 (1985); see generally\nid., Art. 16 (1971) (Code of Professional Responsibility).\nTrial lawyers have a “duty to bring to bear such skill and\nknowledge as will render the trial a reliable adversarial\ntesting process.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668,\n688 (1984). Prosecutors have a special “duty to seek jus\ntice, not merely to convict.” LSBA, Articles of Incorpora\ntion, Art. 16, EC 7–13 (1971); ABA Standards for Criminal\nJustice 3–1.1(c) (2d ed. 1980). Among prosecutors’ unique\nethical obligations is the duty to produce Brady evidence\nto the defense. See, e.g., LSBA, Articles of Incorporation,\nArt. 16, EC 7–13 (1971); ABA Model Rule of Prof. Conduct\n14                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n3.8(d) (1984).8 An attorney who violates his or her ethical\nobligations is subject to professional discipline, including\nsanctions, suspension, and disbarment. See, e.g., LSBA,\nArticles of Incorporation, Art. 15, §§5, 6 (1971); id., Art.\n16, DR 1–102; ABA Model Rule of Prof. Conduct 8.4\n(1984).\n  In light of this regime of legal training and professional\nresponsibility, recurring constitutional violations are not\nthe “obvious consequence” of failing to provide prosecutors\nwith formal in-house training about how to obey the law.\nBryan Cty., 520 U. S., at 409. Prosecutors are not only\nequipped but are also ethically bound to know what Brady\nentails and to perform legal research when they are uncer\ntain. A district attorney is entitled to rely on prosecutors’\nprofessional training and ethical obligations in the ab\n——————\n  8 The   Louisiana State Bar Code of Professional Responsibility in\ncluded a broad understanding of the prosecutor’s duty to disclose in\n1985:\n“With respect to evidence and witnesses, the prosecutor has responsi\nbilities different from those of a lawyer in private practice: the prosecu\ntor should make timely disclosure to the defense of available evidence,\nknown to him, that tends to negate the guilt of the accused, mitigate\nthe degree of the offense, or reduce the punishment. Further, a prose\ncutor should not intentionally avoid pursuit of evidence merely because\nhe believes it will damage the prosecution’s case or aid the accused.”\nLSBA, Articles of Incorporation, Art. 16, EC 7–13 (1971); see also ABA\nModel Rule of Prof. Conduct 3.8(d) (1984) (“The prosecutor in a criminal\ncase shall . . . make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or\ninformation known to the prosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of\nthe accused or mitigates the offense . . .”).\n  In addition to these ethical rules, the Louisiana Code of Criminal\nProcedure, with which Louisiana prosecutors are no doubt familiar, in\n1985 required prosecutors, upon order of the court, to permit inspection\nof evidence “favorable to the defendant . . . which [is] material and\nrelevant to the issue of guilt or punishment,” La. Code Crim. Proc.\nAnn., Art. 718 (West 1981) (added 1977), as well as “any results or\nreports” of “scientific tests or experiments, made in connection with\nor material to the particular case” if those reports are exculpatory or\nintended for use at trial, id., Art. 719.\n                      Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                      15\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nsence of specific reason, such as a pattern of violations, to\nbelieve that those tools are insufficient to prevent future\nconstitutional violations in “the usual and recurring situa\ntions with which [the prosecutors] must deal.”9 Canton,\n489 U. S., at 391. A licensed attorney making legal judg\nments, in his capacity as a prosecutor, about Brady mate\nrial simply does not present the same “highly predictable”\nconstitutional danger as Canton’s untrained officer.\n   A second significant difference between this case and\nthe example in Canton is the nuance of the allegedly\nnecessary training. The Canton hypothetical assumes\nthat the armed police officers have no knowledge at all of\nthe constitutional limits on the use of deadly force. But it\nis undisputed here that the prosecutors in Connick’s office\nwere familiar with the general Brady rule. Thompson’s\ncomplaint therefore cannot rely on the utter lack of an\nability to cope with constitutional situations that underlies\nthe Canton hypothetical, but rather must assert that\nprosecutors were not trained about particular Brady evi\ndence or the specific scenario related to the violation in his\ncase. That sort of nuance simply cannot support an infer\nence of deliberate indifference here. As the Court said in\nCanton, “[i]n virtually every instance where a person has\nhad his or her constitutional rights violated by a city\nemployee, a §1983 plaintiff will be able to point to some\nthing the city ‘could have done’ to prevent the unfortunate\nincident.” 489 U. S., at 392 (citing Tuttle, 471 U. S., at 823\n(plurality opinion)).\n   Thompson suggests that the absence of any formal\ntraining sessions about Brady is equivalent to the com\nplete absence of legal training that the Court imagined in\n\n——————\n  9 Contrary to the dissent’s assertion, see post, at 31, n. 26 (citing post,\nat 18–20), a prosecutor’s youth is not a “specific reason” not to rely on\nprofessional training and ethical obligations. See supra, at 12 (citing\nUnited States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 658, 664 (1984)).\n16                    CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nCanton. But failure-to-train liability is concerned with the\nsubstance of the training, not the particular instructional\nformat. The statute does not provide plaintiffs or courts\ncarte blanche to micromanage local governments through\nout the United States.\n  We do not assume that prosecutors will always make\ncorrect Brady decisions or that guidance regarding specific\nBrady questions would not assist prosecutors. But show\ning merely that additional training would have been\nhelpful in making difficult decisions does not establish\nmunicipal liability. “[P]rov[ing] that an injury or accident\ncould have been avoided if an [employee] had had better or\nmore training, sufficient to equip him to avoid the particu\nlar injury-causing conduct” will not suffice. Canton, su\npra, at 391. The possibility of single-incident liability that\nthe Court left open in Canton is not this case.10\n                              2\n  The dissent rejects our holding that Canton’s hypothe\nsized single-incident liability does not, as a legal matter,\nencompass failure to train prosecutors in their Brady\nobligation. It would instead apply the Canton hypotheti\ncal to this case, and thus devotes almost all of its opinion\nto explaining why the evidence supports liability under\nthat theory.11 But the dissent’s attempt to address our\n——————\n   10 Thompson also argues that he proved deliberate indifference by\n\n“direct evidence of policymaker fault” and so, presumably, did not need\nto rely on circumstantial evidence at all. Brief for Respondent 37. In\nsupport, Thompson contends that Connick created a “culture of indif\nference” in the district attorney’s office, id., at 38, as evidenced by\nConnick’s own allegedly inadequate understanding of Brady, the office’s\nunwritten Brady policy that was later incorporated into a 1987 hand\nbook, and an officewide “restrictive discovery policy,” Brief for Respon\ndent 39–40. This argument is essentially an assertion that Connick’s\noffice had an unconstitutional policy or custom. The jury rejected this\nclaim, and Thompson does not challenge that finding.\n   11 The dissent spends considerable time finding new Brady violations\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nholding—by pointing out that not all prosecutors will\nnecessarily have enrolled in criminal procedure class—\nmisses the point. See post, at 29–30. The reason why the\nCanton hypothetical is inapplicable is that attorneys,\nunlike police officers, are equipped with the tools to find,\n——————\nin Thompson’s trials. See post, at 3–13. How these violations are\nrelevant even to the dissent’s own legal analysis is “a mystery.” Post, at\n4, n. 2.     The dissent does not list these violations among the\n“[a]bundant evidence” that it believes supports the jury’s finding that\nBrady training was obviously necessary. Post, at 16. Nor does the\ndissent quarrel with our conclusion that contemporaneous or subse\nquent conduct cannot establish a pattern of violations. The only point\nappears to be to highlight what the dissent sees as sympathetic, even if\nlegally irrelevant, facts.\n   In any event, the dissent’s findings are highly suspect. In finding two\nof the “new” violations, the dissent belatedly tries to reverse the Court\nof Appeals’ 1998 decision that those Brady claims were “without merit.”\nCompare Thompson v. Cain, 161 F. 3d 802, 806–808 (CA5) (rejecting\nBrady claims regarding the Perkins-Liuzza audiotapes and the Perkins\npolice report), with post, at 8–9 (concluding that these were Brady\nviolations). There is no basis to the dissent’s suggestion that materially\nnew facts have called the Court of Appeals’ 1998 decision into question.\nCf. State v. Thompson, 2002–0361, p. 6 (La.

Regarding the blood-stained swatch, which the\ndissent asserts prosecutors “blocked” the defense from inspecting by\nsending it to the crime lab for testing, post, at 6, Thompson’s counsel\nconceded at oral argument that trial counsel had access to the evidence\nlocker where the swatch was recorded as evidence. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n37, 42; Record EX42, EX43 (evidence card identifying “One (1) Piece of\nVictims [sic] Right Pants Leg, W/Blood” among the evidence in the\nevidence locker and indicating that some evidence had been checked\nout); Tr. 401 (testimony from Thompson’s counsel that he “[w]ent down\nto the evidence room and checked all of the evidence”); id., at 103, 369–\n370, 586, 602 (testimony that evidence card was “available to the\npublic,” would have been available to Thompson’s counsel, and would\nhave been seen by Thompson’s counsel because it was stapled to the\nevidence bag in “the normal process”). Moreover, the dissent cannot\nseriously believe that the jury could have found Brady violations—\nindisputably, questions of law. See post, at 12, n. 10, 15, n. 11.\n18                     CONNICK v.

The dissent does\nnot see “any reason,” post, at 31, for the Court’s conclusion\nin Bryan County that a pattern of violations is “ordinarily\nnecessary” to demonstrate deliberate indifference for\npurposes of failure to train, 520 U. S., at 409. Cf. id., at\n406–408 (explaining why a pattern of violations is ordinar\nily necessary). But cf. post, at 30–31 (describing our reli\nance on Bryan County as “imply[ing]” a new “limitation”\non §1983). As our precedent makes clear, proving that a\nmunicipality itself actually caused a constitutional viola\ntion by failing to train the offending employee presents\n“difficult problems of proof,” and we must adhere to a\n“stringent standard of fault,” lest municipal liability under\n§1983 collapse into respondeat superior.12 Bryan County,\n520 U.

They based this conclusion on Con\nnick’s awareness that (1) prosecutors would confront\n——————\n   12 Although the dissent acknowledges that “deliberate indifference\n\nliability and respondeat superior liability are not one and the same,” the\nopinion suggests that it believes otherwise.

We stand by the longstanding rule—reaffirmed by a unani\nmous Court earlier this Term—that to prove a violation of §1983, a\nplaintiff must prove that “the municipality’s own wrongful conduct”\ncaused his injury, not that the municipality is ultimately responsible\nfor the torts of its employees.

This is insufficient.\n  It does not follow that, because Brady has gray areas\nand some Brady decisions are difficult, prosecutors will so\nobviously make wrong decisions that failing to train them\namounts to “a decision by the city itself to violate the\nConstitution.” Canton, 489 U. S., at 395 (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). To prove delib\nerate indifference, Thompson needed to show that Connick\nwas on notice that, absent additional specified training, it\nwas “highly predictable” that the prosecutors in his office\nwould be confounded by those gray areas and make incor\nrect Brady decisions as a result. In fact, Thompson had to\nshow that it was so predictable that failing to train the\nprosecutors amounted to conscious disregard for defen\ndants’ Brady rights. See Bryan Cty., 520 U.

By their own admission, the prosecutors who tried\nThompson’s armed robbery case failed to carry out that\nresponsibility.

CONNICK, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, ET AL., \n\n      PETITIONERS v. JOHN THOMPSON\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                       [March 29, 2011] \n\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE ALITO joins,\nconcurring.\n  I join the Court’s opinion in full. I write separately only\nto address several aspects of the dissent.\n  1. The dissent’s lengthy excavation of the trial record is\na puzzling exertion. The question presented for our re\nview is whether a municipality is liable for a single Brady\nviolation by one of its prosecutors, even though no pattern\nor practice of prior violations put the municipality on\nnotice of a need for specific training that would have pre\nvented it. See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963).\nThat question is a legal one: whether a Brady violation\npresents one of those rare circumstances we hypothesized\nin Canton’s footnote 10, in which the need for training in\nconstitutional requirements is so obvious ex ante that the\nmunicipality’s failure to provide that training amounts\nto deliberate indifference to constitutional violations. See\nCanton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378, 390, n. 10 (1989).\n  The dissent defers consideration of this question until\npage 23 of its opinion. It first devotes considerable space\nto allegations that Connick’s prosecutors misunderstood\nBrady when asked about it at trial, see post, at 16–18\n(opinion of GINSBURG, J.), and to supposed gaps in the\nBrady guidance provided by Connick’s office to prosecu\ntors, including deficiencies (unrelated to the specific Brady\n2                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                         SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nviolation at issue in this case) in a policy manual pub\nlished by Connick’s office three years after Thompson’s\ntrial, see post, at 18–21. None of that is relevant. Thomp\nson’s failure-to-train theory at trial was not based on a\npervasive culture of indifference to Brady, but rather on\nthe inevitability of mistakes over enough iterations of\ncriminal trials. The District Court instructed the jury it\ncould find Connick deliberately indifferent if:\n       “First: The District Attorney was certain that prosecu\n       tors would confront the situation where they would\n       have to decide which evidence was required by the\n       constitution to be provided to an accused[;]\n       “Second: The situation involved a difficult choice, or\n       one that prosecutors had a history of mishandling,\n       such that additional training, supervision, or monitor\n       ing was clearly needed[; and]\n       “Third: The wrong choice by a prosecutor in that\n       situation will frequently cause a deprivation of an ac\n       cused’s constitutional rights.” App. 828.\n  That theory of deliberate indifference would repeal the\nlaw of Monell1 in favor of the Law of Large Numbers.\nBrady mistakes are inevitable. So are all species of error\nroutinely confronted by prosecutors: authorizing a bad\nwarrant; losing a Batson2 claim; crossing the line in clos\ning argument; or eliciting hearsay that violates the Con\nfrontation Clause. Nevertheless, we do not have “de facto\nrespondeat superior liability,” Canton, 489 U. S., at 392,\nfor each such violation under the rubric of failure-to-train\nsimply because the municipality does not have a profes\nsional educational program covering the specific violation\nin sufficient depth.3 Were Thompson’s theory the law,\n——————\n    1 Monell\n          v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658 (1978).\n    2 Batson\n          v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986).\n  3 I do not share the dissent’s confidence that this result will be\n\navoided by the instruction’s requirement that “ ‘more likely than not the\n                    Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                   3\n\n                        SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nthere would have been no need for Canton’s footnote to\nconfine its hypothetical to the extreme circumstance of\narming police officers with guns without telling them\nabout the constitutional limitations upon shooting fleeing\nfelons; the District Court’s instructions cover every recur\nring situation in which citizens’ rights can be violated.\n   That result cannot be squared with our admonition that\nfailure-to-train liability is available only in “limited cir\ncumstances,” id., at 387, and that a pattern of consti\ntutional violations is “ordinarily necessary to establish\nmunicipal culpability and causation,” Board of Comm’rs of\nBryan Cty. v. Brown, 520 U. S. 397, 409 (1997). These\nrestrictions are indispensable because without them,\n“failure to train” would become a talismanic incantation\nproducing municipal liability “[i]n virtually every instance\nwhere a person has had his or her constitutional rights\nviolated by a city employee”—which is what Monell re\njects. Canton, 489 U. S., at 392. Worse, it would “engage\nthe federal courts in an endless exercise of second\nguessing municipal employee-training programs,” thereby\ndiminishing the autonomy of state and local governments.\nIbid.\n   2. Perhaps for that reason, the dissent does not seri\nously contend that Thompson’s theory of recovery was\nproper. Rather, it accuses Connick of acquiescing in that\ntheory at trial. See post, at 25. The accusation is false.\nConnick’s central claim was and is that failure-to-train\n\n—————— \n\nBrady material would have been produced if the prosecutors involved in \n\nhis underlying criminal cases had been properly trained, supervised or \n\nmonitored regarding the production of Brady evidence.’ ” Post, at 25, \n\nn. 17 (quoting Tr. 1100). How comforting that assurance is depends\nentirely on what proper training consists of. If it is not limited to\ntraining in aspects of Brady that have been repeatedly violated, but\nincludes—as the dissent would have it include here—training that\nwould avoid any one-time violation, the assurance is no assurance at\nall.\n4                       CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                          SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nliability for a Brady violation cannot be premised on a\nsingle incident, but requires a pattern or practice of previ\nous violations. He pressed that argument at the summary\njudgment stage but was rebuffed. At trial, when Connick\noffered a jury instruction to the same effect, the trial judge\neffectively told him to stop bringing up the subject:\n        “[Connick’s counsel]: Also, as part of that definition\n     in that same location, Your Honor, we would like to\n     include language that says that deliberate indiffer\n     ence to training requires a pattern of similar viola\n     tions and proof of deliberate indifference requires\n     more than a single isolated act.\n        “[Thompson’s counsel]: That’s not the law, Your\n     Honor.\n        “THE COURT: No, I’m not giving that. That was in\n     your motion for summary judgment that I denied.”\n     Tr. 1013.\nNothing more is required to preserve a claim of error. See\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 51(d)(1)(B).4\n  3. But in any event, to recover from a municipality\nunder 42 U. S. C. §1983, a plaintiff must satisfy a “rigor\nous” standard of causation, Bryan Cty., 520 U. S., at 405;\nhe must “demonstrate a direct causal link between the\n\n——————\n  4 The dissent’s contention that “[t]he instruction Connick proposed\n\nresembled the charge given by the District Court,” post, at 25, n. 18,\ndisregards his requested instruction concerning the necessity of a\npattern of prior violations. It is meaningless to say that after “the court\nrejected [Connick’s] categorical position,” as it did, he did not “assail the\nDistrict Court’s formulation of the deliberate indifference instruction,”\npost, at 26, n. 18. The prior-pattern requirement was part of Connick’s\nrequested formulation of deliberate indifference: “To prove deliberate\nindifference, a plaintiff must demonstrate ‘at least a pattern of similar\nviolations arising from training that is so clearly inadequate as to be\nobviously likely to result in a constitutional violation.’ ” Record, Doc.\n94, p. 18 (emphasis added).\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                      SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nmunicipal action and the deprivation of federal rights.”\nId., at 404. Thompson cannot meet that standard. The\nwithholding of evidence in his case was almost certainly\ncaused not by a failure to give prosecutors specific train\ning, but by miscreant prosecutor Gerry Deegan’s willful\nsuppression of evidence he believed to be exculpatory, in\nan effort to railroad Thompson. According to Deegan’s\ncolleague Michael Riehlmann, in 1994 Deegan confessed to\nhim—in the same conversation in which Deegan revealed\nhe had only a few months to live—that he had “suppressed\nblood evidence in the armed robbery trial of John Thomp\nson that in some way exculpated the defendant.” App.\n367; see also id., at 362 (“[Deegan] told me . . . that he had\nfailed to inform the defense of exculpatory information”). I\nhave no reason to disbelieve that account, particularly\nsince Riehlmann’s testimony hardly paints a flattering\npicture of himself: Riehlmann kept silent about Deegan’s\nmisconduct for another five years, as a result of which he\nincurred professional sanctions. See In re Riehlmann,\n2004–0680 (La. 1/19/05), 891 So. 2d 1239.              And if\nRiehlmann’s story is true, then the “moving force,” Bryan\nCty., supra, at 404 (internal quotation marks omitted),\nbehind the suppression of evidence was Deegan, not a\nfailure of continuing legal education.\n  4. The dissent suspends disbelief about this, insisting\nthat with proper Brady training, “surely at least one” of\nthe prosecutors in Thompson’s trial would have turned\nover the lab report and blood swatch. Post, at 21. But\ntraining must consist of more than mere broad encomiums\nof Brady: We have made clear that “the identified defi\nciency in a city’s training program [must be] closely re\nlated to the ultimate injury.” Canton, supra, at 391. So\neven indulging the dissent’s assumption that Thompson’s\nprosecutors failed to disclose the lab report in good faith—\nin a way that could be prevented by training—what sort of\n6                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                         SCALIA, J., concurring\n\ntraining would have prevented the good-faith nondisclo\nsure of a blood report not known to be exculpatory?\n   Perhaps a better question to ask is what legally accurate\ntraining would have prevented it. The dissent’s sugges\ntion is to instruct prosecutors to ignore the portion of\nBrady limiting prosecutors’ disclosure obligations to evi\ndence that is “favorable to an accused,” 373 U. S., at 87.\nInstead, the dissent proposes that “Connick could have\ncommunicated to Orleans Parish prosecutors, in no uncer\ntain terms, that, ‘[i]f you have physical evidence that, if\ntested, can establish the innocence of the person who is\ncharged, you have to turn it over.’ ” Post, at 20, n. 13\n(quoting Tr. of Oral Arg. 34). Though labeled a training\nsuggestion, the dissent’s proposal is better described as a\nsub silentio expansion of the substantive law of Brady. If\nany of our cases establishes such an obligation, I have\nnever read it, and the dissent does not cite it.5\n   Since Thompson’s trial, however, we have decided a case\nthat appears to say just the opposite of the training the\ndissent would require: In Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U. S.\n51, 58 (1988), we held that “unless a criminal defendant\ncan show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to\npreserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a\ndenial of due process of law.” We acknowledged that\n“Brady . . . makes the good or bad faith of the State irrele\nvant when the State fails to disclose to the defendant\nmaterial exculpatory evidence,” but concluded that “the\n——————\n  5 What the dissent does cite in support of its theory comes from an\n\nunexpected source: Connick’s testimony about what qualifies as Brady\nmaterial. See post, at 20–21, n. 13. (“Or Connick could have told\nprosecutors what he told the jury when he was asked whether a prose\ncutor must disclose a crime lab report to the defense, even if the pros\necutor does not know the defendant’s blood type: ‘Under the law, it\nqualifies as Brady material.’ ” (quoting Tr. 872)). Given the effort the\ndissent has expended persuading us that Connick’s understanding of\nBrady is profoundly misguided, its newfound trust in his expertise on\nthe subject is, to the say the least, surprising.\n                      Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                      7\n\n                          SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nDue Process Clause requires a different result when we\ndeal with the failure of the State to preserve evidentiary\nmaterial of which no more can be said than that it could\nhave been subjected to tests, the results of which might\nhave exonerated the defendant.” Id., at 57. Perhaps one\nday we will recognize a distinction between good-faith\nfailures to preserve from destruction evidence whose\ninculpatory or exculpatory character is unknown, and\ngood-faith failures to turn such evidence over to the de\nfense. But until we do so, a failure to train prosecutors to\nobserve that distinction cannot constitute deliberate indif\nference.\n   5. By now the reader has doubtless guessed the best\nkept secret of this case: There was probably no Brady\nviolation at all—except for Deegan’s (which, since it was a\nbad-faith, knowing violation, could not possibly be attrib\nuted to lack of training).6 The dissent surely knows this,\nwhich is why it leans heavily on the fact that Connick\nconceded that Brady was violated. I can honor that con\ncession in my analysis of the case because even if it ex\ntends beyond Deegan’s deliberate actions, it remains\nirrelevant to Connick’s training obligations. For any\nBrady violation apart from Deegan’s was surely on the\nvery frontier of our Brady jurisprudence; Connick could\nnot possibly have been on notice decades ago that he was\nrequired to instruct his prosecutors to respect a right to\nuntested evidence that we had not (and still have not)\n\n——————\n   6 The dissent’s only response to this is that the jury must have found\n\notherwise, since it was instructed that “ ‘[f]or liability to attach because\nof a failure to train, the fault must be in the training program itself, not\nin any particular prosecutor.’ ” Post, at 28, n. 20 (quoting Tr. 1098).\nBut this instruction did not require the jury to find that Deegan did not\ncommit a bad-faith, knowing violation; it merely prevented the jury\nfrom finding that, if he did so, Connick was liable for a failure to train.\nI not only agree with that; it is part of my point.\n8                 CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                    SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nrecognized. As a consequence, even if I accepted the dis\nsent’s conclusion that failure-to-train liability could be\npremised on a single Brady error, I could not agree that\nthe lack of an accurate training regimen caused the viola\ntion Connick has conceded.\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, 87 (1963), this\nCourt held that due process requires the prosecution to\nturn over evidence favorable to the accused and material\nto his guilt or punishment. That obligation, the parties\nhave stipulated, was dishonored in this case; conse\nquently, John Thompson spent 18 years in prison, 14 of\nthem isolated on death row, before the truth came to light:\nHe was innocent of the charge of attempted armed rob\nbery, and his subsequent trial on a murder charge, by\nprosecutorial design, was fundamentally unfair.\n  The Court holds that the Orleans Parish District Attor\nney’s Office (District Attorney’s Office or Office) cannot be\nheld liable, in a civil rights action under 42 U. S. C. §1983,\nfor the grave injustice Thompson suffered. That is so, the\nCourt tells us, because Thompson has shown only an\naberrant Brady violation, not a routine practice of giving\nshort shrift to Brady’s requirements. The evidence pre\nsented to the jury that awarded compensation to Thomp\nson, however, points distinctly away from the Court’s\nassessment. As the trial record in the §1983 action re\nveals, the conceded, long-concealed prosecutorial trans\ngressions were neither isolated nor atypical.\n  From the top down, the evidence showed, members of\n2                  CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nthe District Attorney’s Office, including the District At\ntorney himself, misperceived Brady’s compass and there\nfore inadequately attended to their disclosure obligations.\nThroughout the pretrial and trial proceedings against\nThompson, the team of four engaged in prosecuting him\nfor armed robbery and murder hid from the defense and\nthe court exculpatory information Thompson requested\nand had a constitutional right to receive. The prosecutors\ndid so despite multiple opportunities, spanning nearly two\ndecades, to set the record straight. Based on the prosecu\ntors’ conduct relating to Thompson’s trials, a fact trier\ncould reasonably conclude that inattention to Brady was\nstandard operating procedure at the District Attorney’s\nOffice.\n   What happened here, the Court’s opinion obscures, was\nno momentary oversight, no single incident of a lone offi\ncer’s misconduct. Instead, the evidence demonstrated that\nmisperception and disregard of Brady’s disclosure re\nquirements were pervasive in Orleans Parish. That evi\ndence, I would hold, established persistent, deliberately\nindifferent conduct for which the District Attorney’s Office\nbears responsibility under §1983.\n   I dissent from the Court’s judgment mindful that Brady\nviolations, as this case illustrates, are not easily detected.\nBut for a chance discovery made by a defense team inves\ntigator weeks before Thompson’s scheduled execution, the\nevidence that led to his exoneration might have remained\nunder wraps. The prosecutorial concealment Thompson\nencountered, however, is bound to be repeated unless\nmunicipal agencies bear responsibility—made tangible by\n§1983 liability—for adequately conveying what Brady\nrequires and for monitoring staff compliance. Failure to\ntrain, this Court has said, can give rise to municipal liabil\nity under §1983 “where the failure . . . amounts to deliber\nate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the\n[untrained employees] come into contact.” Canton v.\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

Liuzza, Jr., son of a\nprominent New Orleans business executive, on the street\nfronting the victim’s home. Only one witness saw the\nassailant. As recorded in two contemporaneous police\nreports, that eyewitness initially described the assailant\nas African-American, six feet tall, with “close cut hair.”\nRecord EX2–EX3, EX9.1 Thompson is five feet eight\ninches tall and, at the time of the murder, styled his hair\nin a large “Afro.” Id., at EX13. The police reports of the\nwitness’ immediate identification were not disclosed to\nThompson or to the court.\n  While engaged in the murder investigation, the Orleans\nParish prosecutors linked Thompson to another violent\ncrime committed three weeks later. On December 28, an\nassailant attempted to rob three siblings at gunpoint.\nDuring the struggle, the perpetrator’s blood stained the\noldest child’s pant leg. That blood, preserved on a swatch\nof fabric cut from the pant leg by a crime scene analyst,\nwas eventually tested. The test conclusively established\nthat the perpetrator’s blood was type B. Id., at EX151.\nThompson’s blood is type O. His prosecutors failed to\ndisclose the existence of the swatch or the test results.\n\n\n——————\n   1 Exhibits entered into evidence in Thompson’s §1983 trial are herein\n\ncited by reference to the page number in the exhibit binder compiled by\nthe District Court and included in the record on appeal.\n4                     CONNICK v.

Police officers surreptitiously recorded the\nPerkins-Liuzza conversations.2 As documented on tape,\nPerkins told the family, “I don’t mind helping [you] catch\n[the perpetrator], . . . but I would like [you] to help me\nand, you know, I’ll help [you].” Id., at EX479, EX481.\nOnce the family assured Perkins, “we’re on your side, we\nwant to try and help you,” id., at EX481, Perkins inti\nmated that Thompson and another man, Kevin Freeman,\nhad been involved in Liuzza’s murder. Perkins thereafter\ntold the police what he had learned from Freeman about\nthe murder, and that information was recorded in a police\nreport. Based on Perkins’ account, Thompson and Free\nman were arrested on murder charges.\n  Freeman was six feet tall and went by the name “Kojak”\nbecause he kept his hair so closely trimmed that his scalp\nwas visible. Unlike Thompson, Freeman fit the eyewit\nness’ initial description of the Liuzza assailant’s height\nand hair style. As the Court notes, ante, at 4, n. 2, Free\nman became the key witness for the prosecution at\nThompson’s trial for the murder of Liuzza.\n  After Thompson’s arrest for the Liuzza murder, the\nfather of the armed robbery victims saw a newspaper\nphoto of Thompson with a large Afro hairstyle and showed\n——————\n    2 Themajority endorses the Fifth Circuit’s conclusion that, when\nThompson was tried for murder, no Brady violation occurred with\nrespect to these audio tapes “[b]ecause defense counsel had knowledge\nof such evidence and could easily have requested access from the\nprosecution.” Thompson v.

He reported to the District Attorney’s\nOffice that the children had identified Thompson as their\nattacker, and the children then picked that same photo\nout of a “photographic lineup.” Record EX120, EX642–\nEX643. Indicting Thompson on the basis of these ques\ntionable identifications, the District Attorney’s Office did\nnot pause to test the pant leg swatch dyed by the perpe\ntrator’s blood. This lapse ignored or overlooked a prosecu\ntor’s notation that the Office “may wish to do [a] blood\ntest.” Id., at EX122.\n   The murder trial was scheduled to begin in mid-March\n1985. Armed with the later indictment against Thompson\nfor robbery, however, the prosecutors made a strategic\nchoice: They switched the order of the two trials, proceed\ning first on the robbery indictment. Id., at EX128–EX129.\nTheir aim was twofold. A robbery conviction gained first\nwould serve to inhibit Thompson from testifying in his\nown defense at the murder trial, for the prior conviction\ncould be used to impeach his credibility. In addition, an\narmed robbery conviction could be invoked at the penalty\nphase of the murder trial in support of the prosecution’s\nplea for the death penalty. Id., at 682.\n   Recognizing the need for an effective prosecution team,\npetitioner Harry F. Connick, District Attorney for the\nParish of Orleans, appointed his third-in-command, Eric\nDubelier, as special prosecutor in both cases.

Prosecutorial re\nsponses to this motion fell far short of Brady compliance.4\n   First, prosecutors blocked defense counsel’s inspection of\nthe pant leg swatch stained by the robber’s blood. Al\nthough Dubelier’s April 3 response stated, “Inspection to\nbe permitted,” id., at EX149, the swatch was signed out\nfrom the property room at 10:05 a.m. the next day, and\nwas not returned until noon on April 10, the day before\ntrial, id., at EX43, EX670. Thompson’s attorney inspected\nthe evidence made available to him and found no blood\nevidence. No one told defense counsel about the swatch\nand its recent removal from the property room. Id., at\nEX701–EX702; Tr. 400–402. But cf. ante, at 17, n. 11\n(Thompson’s attorney had “access to the evidence locker\nwhere the swatch was recorded as evidence.”).5\n——————\n   4 Connick did not dispute that failure to disclose the swatch and the\n\ncrime lab report violated Brady. See Tr. 46, 1095. But cf. ante, at 4, 6\n(limiting Connick’s concession, as Connick himself did not, to failure to\ndisclose the crime lab report).\n   In JUSTICE SCALIA’s contrary view, “[t]here was probably no Brady\nviolation at all,” or, if there was any violation of Thompson’s rights, it\n“was surely on the very frontier of our Brady jurisprudence,” such that\n“Connick could not possibly have been on notice” of the need to train.\nAnte, at 7. Connick’s counsel, however, saw the matter differently.\n“[A]ny reasonable prosecutor would have recognized blood evidence as\nBrady material,” he said, indeed “the proper response” was “obvious to\nall.” Record 1663, 1665.\n   5 The majority assails as “highly suspect” the suggestion that prose\n\ncutors violated Brady by failing to disclose the blood-stained swatch.\nSee ante, at 17, n. 11. But the parties stipulated in Thompson’s §1983\naction, and the jury was so informed, that, “[p]rior to the armed robbery\ntrial, Mr. Thompson and his attorneys were not advised of the existence\n                      Cite as: 563 U.

Tr. 952–954.\nWhittaker received the lab report, addressed to his atten\ntion, two days before trial commenced. Immediately\nthereafter, he placed the lab report on Williams’ desk.\nRecord EX151, EX589. Although the lab report conclu\nsively identified the perpetrator’s blood type, id., at\nEX151, the District Attorney’s Office never revealed the\nreport to the defense.6\n   Third, Deegan checked the swatch out of the property\nroom on the morning of the first day of trial, but the\nprosecution did not produce the swatch at trial. Id., at\nEX43. Deegan did not return the swatch to the property\nroom after trial, and the swatch has never been found. Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 37.\n   “[B]ased solely on the descriptions” provided by the\nthree victims, Record 683, the jury convicted Thompson of\nattempted armed robbery.

And the\nDistrict Court instructed the jury, with no objection from Connick, “that\nthe nonproduced blood evidence . . . violated [Thompson’s] constitu\ntional rights as a matter of law.” Id., at 1095.\n   6 JUSTICE SCALIA questions petitioners’ concession that Brady was\n\nviolated when the prosecution failed to inform Thompson of the blood\nevidence. He considers the evidence outside Brady because the prose\ncution did not endeavor to test Thompson’s blood, and therefore avoided\nknowing that the evidence was in fact exculpatory. Ante, at 6–7. Such\na “don’t ask, don’t tell” view of a prosecutor’s Brady obligations garners\nno support from precedent. See also supra, at 6, n. 4; infra, at 21, n. 13.\n8                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nmurder trial, held in May 1985, at which the prosecution’s\norder-of-trial strategy achieved its aim.7 By prosecuting\nThompson for armed robbery first—and withholding blood\nevidence that might have exonerated Thompson of that\ncharge—the District Attorney’s Office disabled Thompson\nfrom testifying in his own defense at the murder trial.8 As\nearlier observed, see supra, at 5, impeaching use of the\nprior conviction would have severely undermined Thomp\nson’s credibility. And because Thompson was effectively\nstopped from testifying in his own defense, the testimony\nof the witnesses against him gained force. The prosecu\ntion’s failure to reveal evidence that could have impeached\nthose witnesses helped to seal Thompson’s fate.\n   First, the prosecution undermined Thompson’s efforts to\nimpeach Perkins. Perkins testified that he volunteered\ninformation to the police with no knowledge of reward\nmoney. Record EX366, EX372–EX373. Because prosecu\ntors had not produced the audiotapes of Perkins’ conversa\ntions with the Liuzza family (or a police summary of the\ntapes), Thompson’s attorneys could do little to cast doubt\non Perkins’ credibility. In closing argument, the prosecu\ntion emphasized that Thompson presented no “direct\nevidence” that reward money had motivated any of the\nwitnesses. Id., at EX3171–EX3172.\n   Second, the prosecution impeded Thompson’s impeach\nment of key witness Kevin Freeman. It did so by failing to\ndisclose a police report containing Perkins’ account of\n\n——————\n  7 During jury deliberations in the armed robbery case, Williams, the\n\nonly Orleans Parish trial attorney common to the two prosecutions, told\nThompson of his objective in no uncertain terms: “I’m going to fry you.\nYou will die in the electric chair.” Tr. 252–253.\n  8 The Louisiana Court of Appeal concluded, and Connick does not\n\ndispute, that Thompson “would have testified in the absence of the\nattempted armed robbery conviction.” State v.

Freeman’s trial testimony was materially\ninconsistent with that report. Tr. 382–384, 612–614;\nRecord EX270–EX274. Lacking any knowledge of the police\nreport, Thompson could not point to the inconsistencies.\n   Third, and most vital, the eyewitness’ initial description\nof the assailant’s hair, see supra, at 3, was of prime rele\nvance, for it suggested that Freeman, not Thompson,\nmurdered Liuzza, see supra, at 4. The materiality of the\neyewitness’ contemporaneous description of the murderer\nshould have been altogether apparent to the prosecution.\nFailure to produce the police reports setting out what the\neyewitness first said not only undermined efforts to im\npeach that witness and the police officer who initially\ninterviewed him. The omission left defense counsel with\nout knowledge that the prosecutors were restyling the\nkiller’s “close cut hair” into an “Afro.”\n   Prosecutors finessed the discrepancy between the eye\nwitness’ initial description and Thompson’s appearance.\nThey asked leading questions prompting the eyewitness to\nagree on the stand that the perpetrator’s hair was “afro\ntype,” yet “straight back.” Record EX322–EX323. Cor\nroboratively, the police officer—after refreshing his recol\nlection by reviewing material at the prosecution’s table—\ngave artful testimony. He characterized the witness’\ninitial description of the perpetrator’s hair as “black and\nshort, afro style.” Id., at EX265 (emphasis added). As\nprosecutors well knew, nothing in the withheld police\nreports, which described the murderer’s hair simply as\n“close cut,” portrayed a perpetrator with an Afro or Afro\nstyle hair.\n   The jury found Thompson guilty of first-degree murder.\nHaving prevented Thompson from testifying that Freeman\nwas the killer, the prosecution delivered its ultimate\nargument.

THOMPSON\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nnear-life sentence for attempted armed robbery, the prose\ncution urged, the only way to punish him for murder was\nto execute him. The strategy worked as planned; Thomp\nson was sentenced to death.\n                             E\n   Thompson discovered the prosecutors’ misconduct\nthrough a serendipitous series of events. In 1994, nine\nyears after Thompson’s convictions, Deegan, the assistant\nprosecutor in the armed robbery trial, learned he was\nterminally ill. Soon thereafter, Deegan confessed to his\nfriend Michael Riehlmann that he had suppressed blood\nevidence in the armed robbery case. Id., at EX709.\nDeegan did not heed Riehlmann’s counsel to reveal what\nhe had done. For five years, Riehlmann, himself a former\nOrleans Parish prosecutor, kept Deegan’s confession to\nhimself. Id., at EX712–EX713.\n   On April 16, 1999, the State of Louisiana scheduled\nThompson’s execution. Id., at EX1366–EX1367. In an\neleventh-hour effort to save his life, Thompson’s attorneys\nhired a private investigator. Deep in the crime lab ar\nchives, the investigator unearthed a microfiche copy of the\nlab report identifying the robber’s blood type. The copy\nshowed that the report had been addressed to Whittaker.\nSee supra, at 7.         Thompson’s attorneys contacted\nWhittaker, who informed Riehlmann that the lab report\nhad been found. Riehlmann thereupon told Whittaker\nthat Deegan “had failed to turn over stuff that might have\nbeen exculpatory.” Tr. 718. Riehlmann prepared an\naffidavit describing Deegan’s disclosure “that he had\nintentionally suppressed blood evidence in the armed\nrobbery trial of John Thompson.” Record EX583.\n   Thompson’s lawyers presented to the trial court the\ncrime lab report showing that the robber’s blood type was\nB, and a report identifying Thompson’s blood type as O.\nThis evidence proved Thompson innocent of the robbery.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

A full hearing\nwas unnecessary, he urged, because the Office had con\nfessed error and had moved to dismiss the armed robbery\ncharges. See, e.g., id., at EX617. The court insisted on a\npublic hearing. Given “the history of this case,” the court\nsaid, it “was not willing to accept the representations that\n[Connick] and [his] office made [in their motion to dis\nmiss].” id., at EX882. After a full day’s hearing, the court\nvacated Thompson’s attempted armed robbery conviction\nand dismissed the charges. Before doing so, the court\nadmonished:\n    “[A]ll day long there have been a number of young As\n    sistant D.

Connick terminated the grand jury after just\none day. He maintained that the lab report would not be\nBrady material if prosecutors did not know Thompson’s\nblood type. Tr. 986; cf. supra, at 7, n. 6. And he told the\ninvestigating prosecutor that the grand jury “w[ould]\nmake [his] job more difficult.” Tr. 978–979.

The merits of\nseveral Brady claims arising out of the murder trial, the\ncourt observed, had therefore become “moot.” 825 So. 2d,\nat 555; see also Record 684.9 But cf. ante, at 10–11, n. 7,\n16–17, n. 11 (suggesting that there were no Brady viola\ntions in the murder prosecution because no court had\nadjudicated any violations).10\n——————\n   9 Thompson argued that “the State failed to produce police reports\n\n‘and other information’ which would have identified ‘eye- and ear\nwitnesses’ whose testimony would have exonerated him and inculpated\n[Freeman], . . . and would have shown that [Perkins,] . . . who stated\n[he] heard [Thompson] admit to committing the murder[,] had been\npromised reward money for [his] testimony.” Thompson, 825 So. 2d, at\n555. In leaving these arguments unaddressed, the Louisiana Court of\nAppeal surely did not defer to the Fifth Circuit’s earlier assessment\nof those claims, made on an anemic record, in Thompson v. Cain, 161\nF. 3d 802. Nor did the Louisiana Court of Appeal suggest that Thomp\nson was “belatedly tr[ying] to reverse” the Fifth Circuit’s decision. But\ncf. ante, at 17, n. 11.\n   10 The Court notes that in Thompson v. Cain, the Fifth Circuit re\n\njected Brady claims raised by Thompson, characterizing one of those\nclaims as “without merit.” Ante, at 17, n. 11 (quoting Thompson, 161\nF. 3d, at 807); see supra, at 4, n. 2. The Court, however, overlooks the\ndate of that Fifth Circuit decision. It was rendered before revelation of\nthe Brady violations in the armed robbery trial, before Thompson had\nthe opportunity for discovery in his §1983 suit, and before Thompson or\nany court was aware of the “close cut hair” police reports. See Thomp\nson, 161 F. 3d, at 812, n. 8. It is these later revelations, not the little\nThompson knew in 1998, that should count. For example, the Fifth\nCircuit, in 1998, believed that Perkins’ statement recorded in the police\nreport did not “differ from Freeman’s trial testimony.” Id., at 808. But\nevidence put before the jury in 2007 in the §1983 trial showed that the\npolice report, in several material respects, was inconsistent with\nFreeman’s trial testimony. Tr. 382–383.\n   Connick has never suggested to this Court that the jury in the §1983\ntrial was bound by the Fifth Circuit’s 1998 Brady rulings. That court\n“afford[ed] great deference to” the state trial court’s findings, made\nafter a 1995 post-conviction relief hearing. Thompson, 161 F. 3d, at\n805. The jury in the §1983 trial, of course, had far more extensive and\naccurate information on which to reach its decision. Moreover, as\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                   13\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n  Undeterred by his assistants’ disregard of Thompson’s\nrights, Connick retried him for the Liuzza murder.\nThompson’s defense was bolstered by evidence earlier\nunavailable to him: ten exhibits the prosecution had not\ndisclosed when Thompson was first tried. The newly\nproduced items included police reports describing the\nassailant in the murder case as having “close cut” hair, the\npolice report recounting Perkins’ meetings with the Liuzza\nfamily, see supra, at 3–4, audio recordings of those meet\nings, and a 35-page supplemental police report. After\ndeliberating for only 35 minutes, the jury found Thompson\nnot guilty.\n  On May 9, 2003, having served more than 18 years\nin prison for crimes he did not commit, Thompson was\nreleased.\n                              II\n   On July 16, 2003, Thompson commenced a civil action\nunder 42 U. S. C. §1983 alleging that Connick, other\nofficials of the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office,\nand the Office itself, had violated his constitutional rights\nby wrongfully withholding Brady evidence. Thompson\nsought to hold Connick and the District Attorney’s Office\nliable for failure adequately to train prosecutors concern\ning their Brady obligations. Such liability attaches, I\nagree with the Court, only when the failure “amount[s] to\n‘deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom\nthe [untrained employees] come into contact.’ ” Ante, at 9\n(quoting Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378, 388 (1989)). I\ndisagree, however, with the Court’s conclusion that\n——————\nearlier noted, the same trial court that made the 1995 findings was, in\n1999, outraged by the subsequently discovered Brady violations and by\nConnick’s reluctance to bring those violations to light. See supra, at\n10–11. Certainly that judge would not have wanted the jury that\nassessed Connick’s deliberate indifference in the §1983 trial to defer to\nfindings he earlier made on a notably incomplete record.\n14                 CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nThompson failed to prove deliberate indifference.\n   Having weighed all the evidence, the jury in the §1983\ncase found for Thompson, concluding that the District\nAttorney’s Office had been deliberately indifferent to\nThompson’s Brady rights and to the need for training and\nsupervision to safeguard those rights. “Viewing the evi\ndence in the light most favorable to [Thompson], as appro\npriate in light of the verdic[t] rendered by the jury,” Pat\nrick v. Burget, 486 U. S. 94, 98, n. 3 (1988), I see no cause\nto upset the District Court’s determination, affirmed by\nthe Fifth Circuit, that “ample evidence . . . adduced at\ntrial” supported the jury’s verdict. Record 1917.\n   Over 20 years ago, we observed that a municipality’s\nfailure to provide training may be so egregious that, even\nwithout notice of prior constitutional violations, the failure\n“could properly be characterized as ‘deliberate indiffer\nence’ to constitutional rights.” Canton, 489 U. S., at 390,\nn. 10. “[I]n light of the duties assigned to specific officers\nor employees,” Canton recognized, “it may happen that . . .\nthe need for more or different training is so obvious, and\nthe inadequacy so likely to result in the violation of consti\ntutional rights, that the policymakers . . . can reasonably\nbe said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need.”\nId., at 390. Thompson presented convincing evidence to\nsatisfy this standard.\n                             A\n  Thompson’s §1983 suit proceeded to a jury trial on two\ntheories of liability: First, the Orleans Parish Office’s\nofficial Brady policy was unconstitutional; and second,\nConnick was deliberately indifferent to an obvious need to\ntrain his prosecutors about their Brady obligations. Con\nnick’s Brady policy directed prosecutors to “turn over what\nwas required by state and federal law, but no more.” Brief\nfor Petitioners 6–7.

Ante, at 5.\n  The jury found, however, that Connick was deliberately\nindifferent to the need to train prosecutors about Brady’s\ncommand. On the special verdict form, the jury answered\nyes to the following question:\n     “Was the Brady violation in the armed robbery case or\n     any infringements of John Thompson’s rights in the\n     murder trial substantially caused by [Connick’s] fail\n     ure, through deliberate indifference, to establish poli\n     cies and procedures to protect one accused of a crime\n     from these constitutional violations?” Record 1585.\n  Consistent with the question put to the jury, and with\nout objection, the court instructed the jurors: “[Y]ou are\nnot limited to the nonproduced blood evidence and the\nresulting infringement of Mr. Thompson’s right to testify\nat the murder trial. You may consider all of the evidence\npresented during this trial.” Tr. 1099; Record 1620.11 But\n——————\n  11 The   court permitted Thompson to introduce evidence of other\nBrady violations, but because “the blood evidence alone proved the\nviolation [of Thompson’s constitutional rights],” the court declined\nspecifically “to ask the jury [whether] this other stuff [was] also Brady.”\nTr. 1003. The court allowed Thompson to submit proof of other viola\ntions to “sho[w] the cumulative nature . . . and impact [of] evidence . . .\nas to . . . the training and deliberate indifference . . . .” Ibid. But cf.\nante, at 17, n. 11 (questioning how “these violations are relevant” to\nthis case). Far from indulging in my own factfindings, but cf. ante, at\n16–17, n. 11, I simply recite the evidence supporting the jury’s verdict\nin Thompson’s §1983 trial.\n   The Court misleadingly states that “the District Court instructed the\njury that the ‘only issue’ was whether the nondisclosure [of the crime\nlab report] was caused by either a policy, practice, or custom of the dis\ntrict attorney’s office or a deliberately indifferent failure to train the\noffice’s prosecutors.” Ante, at 4. The jury instruction the majority cites\nsimply directed the jury that, with regard to the blood evidence, as a\nmatter of law, Thompson’s constitutional rights had been violated.\nRecord 1614–1615. The court did not preclude the jury from assessing\nevidence of other infringements of Thompson’s rights. Id., at 1585; see\nKyles v. Whitley, 514 U.

That evidence included a stipulation that in his\nretrial for the Liuzza murder, Thompson had introduced\nten exhibits containing relevant information withheld by\nthe prosecution in 1985. See supra, at 13.\n   Abundant evidence supported the jury’s finding that\nadditional Brady training was obviously necessary to\nensure that Brady violations would not occur: (1) Connick,\nthe Office’s sole policymaker, misunderstood Brady. (2)\nOther leaders in the Office, who bore direct responsibility\nfor training less experienced prosecutors, were similarly\nuninformed about Brady. (3) Prosecutors in the Office\nreceived no Brady training. (4) The Office shirked its\nresponsibility to keep prosecutors abreast of relevant legal\ndevelopments concerning Brady requirements. As a result\nof these multiple shortfalls, it was hardly surprising that\nBrady violations in fact occurred, severely undermining\nthe integrity of Thompson’s trials.\n                             1\n  Connick was the Office’s sole policymaker, and his\ntestimony exposed a flawed understanding of a prosecu\ntor’s Brady obligations. First, Connick admitted to the\njury that his earlier understanding of Brady, conveyed in\nprior sworn testimony, had been too narrow. Tr. 181–182.\nSecond, Connick confessed to having withheld a crime lab\nreport “one time as a prosecutor and I got indicted by the\nU. S. Attorney over here for doing it.” Id., at 872. Third,\neven at trial Connick persisted in misstating Brady’s\nrequirements. For example, Connick urged that there\ncould be no Brady violation arising out of “the inadvertent\nconduct of [an] assistant under pressure with a lot of case\n\n—————— \n\nunder Brady . . . turns on the cumulative effect of all . . . evidence \n\nsuppressed by the government . . . .”). \n\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

The court, however, correctly in\nstructed the jury that, in determining whether there has\nbeen a Brady violation, the “good or bad faith of the prose\ncution does not matter.” Tr. 1094–1095.\n                               2\n  The testimony of other leaders in the District Attorney’s\nOffice revealed similar misunderstandings. Those misun\nderstandings, the jury could find, were in large part re\nsponsible for the gross disregard of Brady rights Thomp\nson experienced.       Dubelier admitted that he never\nreviewed police files, but simply relied on the police to flag\nany potential Brady information. Tr. 542. The court,\nhowever, instructed the jury that an individual prosecutor\nhas a “duty . . . to learn of any favorable evidence known\nto others acting on the government’s behalf in the case,\nincluding the police.” Id., at 1095; Record 1614. Williams\nwas asked whether “Brady material includes documents in\nthe possession of the district attorney that could be used to\nimpeach a witness, to show that he’s lying”; he responded\nsimply, and mistakenly, “No.” Tr. 381. The testimony of\n“high-ranking individuals in the Orleans Parish District\nAttorney’s Office,” Thompson’s expert explained,12 exposed\n“complete errors . . . as to what Brady required [prosecu\ntors] to do.” Id., at 427, 434. “Dubelier had no under\nstanding of his obligations under Brady whatsoever,” id.,\nat 458, the expert observed, and Williams “is still not sure\n——————\n  12 With no objection from petitioners, the court found Thompson’s\n\nexpert, Joseph Lawless, qualified to testify as an expert in criminal law\nand procedure.

But\ncf. ante, at 4–5 (“[I]t was undisputed at trial that the\nprosecutors were familiar with the general Brady re\nquirement that the State disclose to the defense evidence\nin its possession that is favorable to the accused.”).\n   The jury could attribute the violations of Thompson’s\nrights directly to prosecutors’ misapprehension of Brady.\nThe prosecution had no obligation to produce the “close-cut\nhair” police reports, Williams maintained, because news\npaper reports had suggested that witness descrip\ntions were not consistent with Thompson’s appearance.\nTherefore, Williams urged, the defense already “had every\nthing.” Tr. 139. Dubelier tendered an alternative ex\nplanation for the nondisclosure. In Dubelier’s view, the\ndescriptions were not “inconsistent with [Thompson’s]\nappearance,” as portrayed in a police photograph showing\nThompson’s hair extending at least three inches above his\nforehead. Id., at 171–172; Record EX73. Williams in\nsisted that he had discharged the prosecution’s duty to\ndisclose the blood evidence by mentioning, in a motion\nhearing, that the prosecution intended to obtain a blood\nsample from Thompson. Tr. 393–394. During the armed\nrobbery trial, Williams told one of the victims that the\nresults of the blood test made on the swatch had been\n“inconclusive.” Id., at 962. And he testified in the §1983\naction that the lab report was not Brady material “because\nI didn’t know what the blood type of Mr. Thompson was.”\nTr. 393. But see supra, at 6–7, n. 5 (District Court in\nstructed the jury that the lab report was Brady material).\n                             3\n  Connick should have comprehended that Orleans Parish\nprosecutors lacked essential guidance on Brady and its\napplication. In fact, Connick has effectively conceded that\nBrady training in his Office was inadequate. Tr. of Oral\nArg. 60. Connick explained to the jury that prosecutors’\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)          19\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\noffices must “make . . . very clear to [new prosecutors]\nwhat their responsibility [i]s” under Brady and must not\n“giv[e] them a lot of leeway.” Tr. 834–835. But the jury\nheard ample evidence that Connick’s Office gave prosecu\ntors no Brady guidance, and had installed no procedures\nto monitor Brady compliance.\n  In 1985, Connick acknowledged, many of his prosecutors\n“were coming fresh out of law school,” and the Office’s\n“[h]uge turnover” allowed attorneys with little experience\nto advance quickly to supervisory positions. See Tr. 853–\n854, 832. By 1985, Dubelier and Williams were two of the\nhighest ranking attorneys in the Office, id., at 342, 356–\n357, yet neither man had even five years of experience as\na prosecutor, see supra, at 5, n. 3; Record EX746; Tr. 55,\n571–576.\n  Dubelier and Williams learned the prosecutorial craft in\nConnick’s Office, and, as earlier observed, see supra, at\n17–18, their testimony manifested a woefully deficient\nunderstanding of Brady. Dubelier and Williams told the\njury that they did not recall any Brady training in the\nOffice. Tr. 170–171, 364.\n  Connick testified that he relied on supervisors, includ\ning Dubelier and Williams, to ensure prosecutors were\nfamiliar with their Brady obligations. Tr. 805–806. Yet\nConnick did not inquire whether the supervisors them\nselves understood the importance of teaching newer prose\ncutors about Brady. Riehlmann could not “recall that [he]\nwas ever trained or instructed by anybody about [his]\nBrady obligations,” on the job or otherwise. Tr. 728–729.\nWhittaker agreed it was possible for “inexperienced law\nyers, just a few weeks out of law school with no training,”\nto bear responsibility for “decisions on . . . whether mate\nrial was Brady material and had to be produced.” Id., at\n319.\n  Thompson’s expert characterized Connick’s supervision\nregarding Brady as “the blind leading the blind.” Tr. 458.\n20                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nFor example, in 1985 trial attorneys “sometimes . . . went\nto Mr. Connick” with Brady questions, “and he would tell\nthem” how to proceed. Tr. 892. But Connick acknowl\nedged that he had “stopped reading law books . . . and\nlooking at opinions” when he was first elected District\nAttorney in 1974. Id., at 175–176.\n   As part of their training, prosecutors purportedly at\ntended a pretrial conference with the Office’s chief of trials\nbefore taking a case to trial. Connick intended the prac\ntice to provide both training and accountability. But it\nachieved neither aim in Thompson’s prosecutions, for\nDubelier and Williams, as senior prosecutors in the Office,\nwere free to take cases to trial without pretrying them,\nand that is just how they proceeded in Thompson’s prose\ncutions. Id., at 901–902; Record 685. But cf. ante, at 13\n(“[T]rial chiefs oversaw the preparation of the cases.”).\n   Prosecutors confirmed that training in the District\nAttorney’s Office, overall, was deficient. Soon after Con\nnick retired, a survey of assistant district attorneys in the\nOffice revealed that more than half felt that they had not\nreceived the training they needed to do their jobs. Tr. 178.\n   Thompson, it bears emphasis, is not complaining about\nthe absence of formal training sessions. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n55. But cf. ante, at 15–16. His complaint does not demand\nthat Brady compliance be enforced in any particular way.\nHe asks only that Brady obligations be communicated\naccurately and genuinely enforced.13 Because that did not\n——————\n   13 To ward off Brady violations of the kind Connick conceded, for ex\n\nample, Connick could have communicated to Orleans Parish prosecu\ntors, in no uncertain terms, that, “[i]f you have physical evidence that,\nif tested, can establish the innocence of the person who is charged, you\nhave to turn it over.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 34; id., at 36 (“[I]f you have\nevidence that can conclusively establish to a scientific certainty the\ninnocence of the person being charged, you have to turn it over . . . .”).\nOr Connick could have told prosecutors what he told the jury when he\nwas asked whether a prosecutor must disclose a crime lab report to the\ndefense, even if the prosecutor does not know the defendant’s blood\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

Had Brady’s\nimportance been brought home to prosecutors, surely at\nleast one of the four officers who knew of the swatch and\nlab report would have revealed their existence to defense\ncounsel and the court.14\n                              4\n  Louisiana did not require continuing legal education at\nthe time of Thompson’s trials. Tr. 361. But cf. ante, at\n12–13. Primary responsibility for keeping prosecutors au\ncourant with developments in the law, therefore, resided\nin the District Attorney’s Office. Over the course of Con\nnick’s tenure as District Attorney, the jury learned, the\nOffice’s chief of appeals circulated memoranda when ap\npellate courts issued important opinions. Tr. 751–754,\n798.\n  The 1987 Office policy manual was a compilation of\nmemoranda on criminal law and practice circulated to\nprosecutors from 1974, when Connick became District\nAttorney, through 1987. Id., at 798. The manual con\ntained four sentences, nothing more, on Brady.15 This\n——————\ntype: “Under the law it qualifies as Brady material. Under Louisiana\nlaw we must turn that over. Under Brady we must turn that over. I\n[failed to disclose a crime lab report] one time as a prosecutor and I got\nindicted by the U. S. Attorney over here for doing it.” Tr. 872. But cf.\nante, at 7 (SCALIA, J., concurring) (questioning how Connick could have\nbeen on notice of the need to train prosecutors about the Brady viola\ntions conceded in this case).\n   14 The Court can scarcely disagree with respect to Dubelier, Williams,\n\nand Whittaker, for it acknowledges the “flagran[cy]” of Deegan’s con\nduct, see ante, at 7, n. 5, and does not dispute that, pretrial, other\nprosecutors knew of the existence of the swatch and lab report.\n   15 Section 5.25 of the manual, titled “Brady Material,” states in full:\n\n“In most cases, in response to the request of defense attorneys, the\nJudge orders the State to produce so called Brady material—that is,\ninformation in the possession of the State which is exculpatory regard\ning the defendant.

Failure to produce\nBrady material has resulted in mistrials and reversals, as well as\nextended court battles over jeopardy issues. In all cases, a review of\nBrady issues, including apparently self-serving statements made by the\ndefendant, must be included in a pre-trial conference and each Assis\ntant must be familiar with the law regarding exculpatory information\npossessed by the State.” Record EX427.\n   16 During the relevant time period, there were many significant de\n\nvelopments in this Court’s Brady jurisprudence. Among the Brady\nrelated decisions this Court handed down were United States v. Bagley,\n473 U. S. 667, 676 (1985) (“This Court has rejected any . . . distinction\nbetween impeachment evidence and exculpatory evidence [in the Brady\ncontext].”); Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U. S. 545, 559–560 (1977)\n(“Brady is not implicated . . . where the only claim is that the State\nshould have revealed that it would present the eyewitness testimony of\na particular agent against the defendant at trial.”); and United States v.\nAgurs, 427 U. S. 97, 103, 104, 106–107 (1976) (Brady claim may arise\nwhen “the undisclosed evidence demonstrates that the prosecution’s\ncase includes perjured testimony and that the prosecution knew, or\nshould have known, of the perjury,” when defense counsel makes “a\npretrial request for specific evidence” and the government fails to\naccede to that request, and when defense counsel makes no request and\nthe government fails to disclose “obviously exculpatory” evidence).\nThese decisions were not referenced in the manual that compiled\ncirculated memoranda.\n   In the same period, the Louisiana Supreme Court issued dozens of\nopinions discussing Brady, including State v.

First, Connick did not ensure that\nprosecutors in his Office knew their Brady obligations; he\nneither confirmed their familiarity with Brady when he\nhired them, nor saw to it that training took place on his\nwatch. Second, the need for Brady training and monitor\ning was obvious to Connick. Indeed he so testified. Third,\nConnick’s cavalier approach to his staff’s knowledge and\nobservation of Brady requirements contributed to a cul\nture of inattention to Brady in Orleans Parish.\n   As earlier noted, see supra, at 11, Connick resisted an\neffort to hold prosecutors accountable for Brady compli\nance because he felt the effort would “make [his] job more\ndifficult.” Tr. 978. He never disciplined or fired a single\nprosecutor for violating Brady. Tr. 182–183. The jury was\ntold of this Court’s decision in Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S.\n419 (1995), a capital case prosecuted by Connick’s Office\nthat garnered attention because it featured “so many\ninstances of the state’s failure to disclose exculpatory\nevidence.” Id., at 455 (Stevens, J., concurring). When\nquestioned about Kyles, Connick told the jury he was\nsatisfied with his Office’s practices and saw no need,\noccasioned by Kyles, to make any changes. Tr. 184–185.\nIn both quantity and quality, then, the evidence canvassed\nhere was more than sufficient to warrant a jury determi\nnation that Connick and the prosecutors who served under\nhim were not merely negligent regarding Brady. Rather,\nthey were deliberately indifferent to what the law\nrequires.\n                           B\n  In Canton, this Court spoke of circumstances in which\nthe need for training may be “so obvious,” and the lack of\n\n—————— \n\nprosecution fails, even inadvertently, to disclose bargain with a wit\nness).\n\n24                    CONNICK v.

This case, I am convinced, belongs in the category\nCanton marked out.\n   Canton offered an often-cited illustration. “[C]ity poli\ncymakers know to a moral certainty that their police\nofficers will be required to arrest fleeing felons.” Ibid.,\nn. 10. Those policymakers, Canton observed, equip police\nofficers with firearms to facilitate such arrests. Ibid. The\nneed to instruct armed officers about “constitutional limi\ntations on the use of deadly force,” Canton said, is “ ‘so\nobvious,’ that failure to [train the officers] could properly\nbe characterized as ‘deliberate indifference’ to constitu\ntional rights.” Ibid.\n   The District Court, tracking Canton’s language, in\nstructed the jury that Thompson could prevail on his\n“deliberate indifference” claim only if the evidence per\nsuaded the jury on three points. First, Connick “was\ncertain that prosecutors would confront the situation\nwhere they would have to decide which evidence was\nrequired by the Constitution to be provided to the ac\ncused.” Tr. 1099. Second, “the situation involved a diffi\ncult choice[,] or one that prosecutors had a history of\nmishandling, such that additional training, supervision or\nmonitoring was clearly needed.” Ibid. Third, “the wrong\nchoice by a prosecutor in that situation would frequently\ncause a deprivation of an accused’s constitutional rights.”\nIbid.; Record 1619–1620; see Canton, 489 U.

The District Court’s charge, how\never, cautiously cabined the jury’s assessment of Connick’s deliberate\nindifference. See, e.g., Tr. 1100 (“Mr. Thompson must prove that more\nlikely than not the Brady material would have been produced if the\nprosecutors involved in his underlying criminal cases had been properly\ntrained, supervised or monitored regarding the production of Brady\nevidence.”). See also id., at 1096–1097, 1099–1100.\n   The deliberate indifference jury instruction in this case was based on\nthe Second Circuit’s opinion in Walker v. New York, 974 F. 2d 293, 297–\n298 (1992), applying Canton to a §1983 complaint alleging that a\ndistrict attorney failed to train prosecutors about Brady. JUSTICE\nSCALIA’s fears should be calmed by post-Walker experience in the\nSecond Circuit. There has been no “litigation flood or even rainfall,”\nSkinner v. Switzer, 562 U. S. ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12), in that Circuit\nin Walker’s wake. See Brief for National Association of Criminal\nDefense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 39 (“Tellingly, in the Second Cir\ncuit, in the nearly 20 years since the court decided Walker, there have\nbeen no successful lawsuits for non-Brady constitutional violations\ncommitted by prosecutors at trial (and no reported ‘single violation’\nBrady case).” (citation omitted)); Brief for Center on the Administration\nof Criminal Law, New York University School of Law, et al. as Amici\nCuriae 35–36 (Walker has prompted “no flood of §1983 liability”).\n   18 The instruction Connick proposed resembled the charge given by\n\nthe District Court. See supra, at 24. Connick’s proposed instruction\nread: “Before a district attorney’s failure to train or supervise consti\ntutes deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of citizens: (1)\nthe plaintiff must show that Harry Connick knew ‘to a moral certainty’\nthat his employees will confront a given situation; (2) the plaintiff must\nshow that the situation either presents the employee with a difficult\nchoice . . . such that training or supervision will make the choice less\ndifficult or that there is a history of employees mishandling the situa\ntion; and (3) the plaintiff must show that the wrong choice by the\nassistant district attorney will frequently cause the deprivation of a\ncitizen’s constitutional rights.” Record 992 (citing Canton, 489 U.

See Canton, 489 U. S., at 390, and n. 10.19 As\ndemonstrated earlier, see supra, at 16–18, even at trial\nprosecutors failed to give an accurate account of their\nBrady obligations. And, again as emphasized earlier, see\nsupra, at 18–20, the evidence permitted the jury to con\nclude that Connick should have known Brady training in\nhis office bordered on “zero.” See Tr. of Oral Arg. 41.\nMoreover, Connick understood that newer prosecutors\nneeded “very clear” guidance and should not be left to\ngrapple with Brady on their own. Tr. 834–835. It was\nthus “obvious” to him, the jury could find, that constitu\ntional rights would be in jeopardy if prosecutors received\nslim to no Brady training.\n   Based on the evidence presented, the jury could con\nclude that Brady errors by untrained prosecutors would\nfrequently cause deprivations of defendants’ constitutional\nrights.

They were just what one would expect given the\nattitude toward Brady pervasive in the District Attorney’s\nOffice. Thompson demonstrated that no fewer than five\nprosecutors—the four trial prosecutors and Riehlmann—\ndisregarded his Brady rights. He established that they\nkept from him, year upon year, evidence vital to his de\nfense. Their conduct, he showed with equal force, was a\nforeseeable consequence of lax training in, and absence of\nmonitoring of, a legal requirement fundamental to a fair\ntrial.20\n——————\n   20 The jury could draw a direct, causal connection between Connick’s\n\ndeliberate indifference, prosecutors’ misapprehension of Brady, and the\nBrady violations in Thompson’s case.

But as this case so vividly shows, a municipal\nity that empowers prosecutors to press for a death sen\ntence without ensuring that those prosecutors know and\nhonor Brady rights may be no less “deliberately indiffer\n\n——————\nimportance been brought home to prosecutors, surely at least one of the\nfour officers who knew of the swatch and lab report would have re\nvealed their existence to defense counsel and the court.”); supra, at 23\n(Connick did not want to hold prosecutors accountable for Brady\ncompliance because he felt that doing so would make his job more\ndifficult); supra, at 23 (Connick never disciplined a single prosecutor for\nviolating Brady); supra, at 27 (“Because prosecutors faced considerable\npressure to get convictions, and were instructed to turn over what was\nrequired by state and federal law, but no more, the risk was all too real\nthat they would err by withholding rather than revealing information\nfavorable to the defense.” (citations and internal quotation marks\nomitted)). But cf. ante, at 7, n. 5 (“The dissent believes that evidence\nthat the prosecutors allegedly ‘misapprehen[ded]’ Brady proves causa\ntion.”).\n   I note, furthermore, that the jury received clear instructions on the\ncausation element, and neither Connick nor the majority disputes the\naccuracy or adequacy of the instruction that, to prevail, Thompson\nmust prove “that more likely than not the Brady material would have\nbeen produced if the prosecutors involved in his underlying criminal\ncases had been properly trained, supervised or monitored regarding the\nproduction of Brady evidence.” Tr. 1100.\n   The jury was properly instructed that “[f]or liability to attach because\nof a failure to train, the fault must be in the training program itself, not\nin any particular prosecutor.” Id., at 1098. Under that instruction, in\nfinding Connick liable, the jury necessarily rejected the argument—\nechoed by JUSTICE SCALIA—that Deegan “was the only bad guy.” Id., at\n1074. See also id., at 1057; ante, at 5. If indeed Thompson had shown\nsimply and only that Deegan deliberately withheld evidence, I would\nagree that there would be no basis for liability. But, as reams of\nevidence showed, disregard of Brady occurred, over and over again in\nOrleans Parish, before, during, and after Thompson’s 1985 robbery and\nmurder trials.\n                    Cite as: 563 U.

See Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(slip op., at 1). See also United States v. Bagley, 473 U. S.\n667, 695 (1985) (Marshall, J., dissenting). Vigilance in\nsuperintending prosecutors’ attention to Brady’s require\nment is all the more important for this reason: A Brady\nviolation, by its nature, causes suppression of evidence\nbeyond the defendant’s capacity to ferret out. Because the\nabsence of the withheld evidence may result in the convic\ntion of an innocent defendant, it is unconscionable not to\nimpose reasonable controls impelling prosecutors to bring\nthe information to light.\n   The Court nevertheless holds Canton’s example inappo\nsite. It maintains that professional obligations, ethics\nrules, and training—including on-the-job training—set\nattorneys apart from other municipal employees, including\nrookie police officers. Ante, at 12–15. Connick “had every\nincentive at trial to attempt to establish” that he could\nreasonably rely on the professional education and status of\nhis staff. Cf. ante, at 10, n. 6. But the jury heard and\nrejected his argument to that effect. Tr. 364, 576–577,\n834–835.\n   The Court advances Connick’s argument with greater\nclarity, but with no greater support. On what basis can\none be confident that law schools acquaint students with\nprosecutors’ unique obligation under Brady? Whittaker\ntold the jury he did not recall covering Brady in his crimi\nnal procedure class in law school. Tr. 335. Dubelier’s\nalma mater, like most other law faculties, does not make\ncriminal procedure a required course.21\n——————\n   21 See Tulane University Law School, Curriculum, http://www.law\n\n.tulane.edu (select “Academics”; select “Curriculum”) (as visited Mar.\n21, 2011, and in Clerk of Court’s case file).\n30                    CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   Connick suggested that the bar examination ensures\nthat new attorneys will know what Brady demands. Tr.\n835. Research indicates, however, that from 1980 to the\npresent, Brady questions have not accounted for even\n10% of the total points in the criminal law and procedure\nsection of any administration of the Louisiana Bar Exami\nnation.22 A person sitting for the Louisiana Bar Examina\ntion, moreover, need pass only five of the exam’s nine\nsections.23 One can qualify for admission to the profession\nwith no showing of even passing knowledge of criminal\nlaw and procedure.\n   The majority’s suggestion that lawyers do not need\nBrady training because they “are equipped with the tools\nto find, interpret, and apply legal principles,” ante, at 17–\n18, “blinks reality” and is belied by the facts of this case.\nSee Brief for Former Federal Civil Rights Officials and\nProsecutors as Amici Curiae 13. Connick himself recog\nnized that his prosecutors, because of their inexperience,\nwere not so equipped. Indeed, “understanding and com\nplying with Brady obligations are not easy tasks, and the\nappropriate way to resolve Brady issues is not always self\nevident.” Brief for Former Federal Civil Rights Officials\nand Prosecutors as Amici Curiae 6. “Brady compliance,”\ntherefore, “is too much at risk, and too fundamental to the\nfairness of our criminal justice system, to be taken for\ngranted,” and “training remains critical.” Id., at 3, 7.\n   The majority further suggests that a prior pattern of\nsimilar violations is necessary to show deliberate indiffer\nence to defendants’ Brady rights. See ante, at 5–6, and\nn. 4, 11–12.24 The text of §1983 contains no such limita\n——————\n  22 See Supreme Court of Louisiana, Committee on Bar Admissions,\n\nCompilation of Louisiana State Bar Examinations, Feb. 1980 through\nJuly 2010 (available in Clerk of Court’s case file).\n  23 See La.

Con\nducting this inquiry, the Court has acknowledged, “may not be an easy\ntask for the factfinder.” Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378, 391 (1989).\nBryan County did not retreat from this Court’s conclusion in Canton\nthat “judge and jury, doing their respective jobs, will be adequate to the\ntask.” 489 U. S., at 391. See also Bryan County, 520 U. S., at 410\n(absent a pattern, municipal liability may be predicated on “a particu\nlar glaring omission in a training regimen”). But cf. ante, at 16–18\n(suggesting that under no set of facts could a plaintiff establish deliber\nate indifference for failure to train prosecutors in their Brady obligation\nwithout showing a prior pattern of violations).\n    25 When Congress sought to render a claim for relief contingent on\n\nshowing a pattern or practice, it did so expressly. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C.\n§14141(a) (“It shall be unlawful for any governmental authority . . . to\nengage in a pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers\n. . . that deprives persons of rights . . . protected by the Constitution\n. . . .”); 15 U. S. C. §6104(a) (“Any person adversely affected by any\npattern or practice of telemarketing . . . may . . . bring a civil action\n. . . .”); 49 U. S. C. §306(e) (authorizing the Attorney General to bring a\ncivil action when he “has reason to believe that a person is engaged in a\npattern or practice [of] violating this section”). See also 47 U. S. C.\n§532(e)(2)–(3) (authorizing the Federal Communications Commission to\nestablish additional rules when “the Commission finds that the prior\nadjudicated violations of this section constitute a pattern or practice of\nviolations”).\n    26 In the end, the majority leaves open the possibility that something\n\nother than “a pattern of violations” could also give a district attorney\n“specific reason” to know that additional training is necessary. See\nante, at 14–15. Connick, by his own admission, had such a reason. See\nsupra, at 18–20.\n    27 For example, a prosecutor’s office could be deliberately indifferent if\n\nit had a longstanding open-file policy, abandoned that policy, but failed\nto provide training to show prosecutors how to comply with their Brady\nobligations in the altered circumstances. Or a district attorney could be\ndeliberately indifferent if he had a practice of paring well-trained\nprosecutors with untrained prosecutors, knew that such supervision\n32                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ncase is one such instance. Connick, who himself had been\nindicted for suppression of evidence, created a tinderbox in\nOrleans Parish in which Brady violations were nigh inevi\ntable. And when they did occur, Connick insisted there\nwas no need to change anything, and opposed efforts to\nhold prosecutors accountable on the ground that doing so\nwould make his job more difficult.\n   A District Attorney aware of his office’s high turnover\nrate, who recruits prosecutors fresh out of law school and\npromotes them rapidly through the ranks, bears responsi\nbility for ensuring that on-the-job training takes place. In\nshort, the buck stops with him.28 As the Court recognizes,\n“the duty to produce Brady evidence to the defense” is\n“[a]mong prosecutors’ unique ethical obligations.” Ante, at\n13. The evidence in this case presents overwhelming\nsupport for the conclusion that the Orleans Parish Office\nslighted its responsibility to the profession and to the\nState’s system of justice by providing no on-the-job Brady\ntraining. Connick was not “entitled to rely on prosecutors’\nprofessional training,” ante, at 14, for Connick himself\nshould have been the principal insurer of that training.\n                         *    *     *\n  For the reasons stated, I would affirm the judgment of\nthe U.

Like that\ncourt and, before it, the District Court, I would uphold the\n——————\nhad stopped untrained prosecutors from committing Brady violations,\nbut nevertheless changed the staffing on cases so that untrained\nprosecutors worked without supervision.\n   28 If the majority reads this statement as an endorsement of respon\n\ndeat superior liability, ante, at 18, n. 12, then it entirely “misses [my]\npoint,” cf. ante, at 17. Canton recognized that deliberate indifference\nliability and respondeat superior liability are not one and the same.\n489 U. S., at 385, 388–389. Connick was directly responsible for the\nBrady violations in Thompson’s prosecutions not because he hired\nprosecutors who violated Brady, but because of his own deliberate\nindifference.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Argued October 6, 2010—Decided March 29, 2011\nPetitioner the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office concedes that,\n  in prosecuting respondent Thompson for attempted armed robbery,\n  prosecutors violated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, by failing to\n  disclose a crime lab report. Because of his robbery conviction,\n  Thompson elected not to testify at his later murder trial and was\n  convicted. A month before his scheduled execution, the lab report\n  was discovered. A reviewing court vacated both convictions, and\n  Thompson was found not guilty in a retrial on the murder charge. He\n  then filed suit against the district attorney’s office under 42 U. S. C.\n  §1983, alleging, inter alia, that the Brady violation was caused by the\n  office’s deliberate indifference to an obvious need to train prosecutors\n  to avoid such constitutional violations. The district court held that,\n  to prove deliberate indifference, Thompson did not need to show a\n  pattern of similar Brady violations when he could demonstrate that\n  the need for training was obvious. The jury found the district attor\n  ney’s office liable for failure to train and awarded Thompson dam\n  ages. The Fifth Circuit affirmed by an equally divided court.\nHeld: A district attorney’s office may not be held liable under §1983 for\n  failure to train its prosecutors based on a single Brady violation. Pp.\n  6–20.\n     (a) Plaintiffs seeking to impose §1983 liability on local governments\n  must prove that their injury was caused by “action pursuant to offi\n  cial municipal policy,” which includes the decisions of a government’s\n  lawmakers, the acts of its policymaking officials, and practices so\n  persistent and widespread as to practically have the force of law.\n  Monell v.

Har\n    ris, 489 U. S. 378, 388. Deliberate indifference in this context re\n    quires proof that city policymakers disregarded the “known or obvi\n    ous consequence” that a particular omission in their training\n    program would cause city employees to violate citizens’ constitutional\n    rights. Board of Comm’rs of Bryan Cty. v. Brown, 520 U. S. 397, 410.\n    Pp. 6–9.\n       (b) A pattern of similar constitutional violations by untrained em\n    ployees is “ordinarily necessary” to demonstrate deliberate indiffer\n    ence. Bryan Cty., supra, at 409. Without notice that a course of\n    training is deficient, decisionmakers can hardly be said to have delib\n    erately chosen a training program that will cause violations of consti\n    tutional rights. Thompson does not contend that he proved a pattern\n    of similar Brady violations, and four reversals by Louisiana courts for\n    dissimilar Brady violations in the 10 years before the robbery trial\n    could not have put the district attorney’s office on notice of the need\n    for specific training. Pp. 9–10.\n       (c) Thompson mistakenly relies on the “single-incident” liability\n    hypothesized in Canton, contending that the Brady violation in his\n    case was the “obvious” consequence of failing to provide specific\n    Brady training and that this “obviousness” showing can substitute\n    for the pattern of violations ordinarily necessary to establish munici\n    pal culpability. In Canton, the Court theorized that if a city armed\n    its police force and deployed them into the public to capture fleeing\n    felons without training the officers in the constitutional limitation on\n    the use of deadly force, the failure to train could reflect the city’s de\n    liberate indifference to the highly predictable consequence, namely,\n    violations of constitutional rights. Failure to train prosecutors in\n    their Brady obligations does not fall within the narrow range of Can\n    ton’s hypothesized single-incident liability. The obvious need for spe\n    cific legal training present in Canton’s scenario—police academy ap\n    plicants are unlikely to be familiar with constitutional constraints on\n    deadly force and, absent training, cannot obtain that knowledge—is\n    absent here. Attorneys are trained in the law and equipped with the\n    tools to interpret and apply legal principles, understand constitu\n    tional limits, and exercise legal judgment. They receive training be\n    fore entering the profession, must usually satisfy continuing educa\n    tion requirements, often train on the job with more experienced\n    attorneys, and must satisfy licensing standards and ongoing ethical\n    obligations. Prosecutors not only are equipped but are ethically\n    bound to know what Brady entails and to perform legal research\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  when they are uncertain. Thus, recurring constitutional violations\n  are not the “obvious consequence” of failing to provide prosecutors\n  with formal in-house training. The nuance of the allegedly necessary\n  training also distinguishes the case from the example in Canton.\n  Here, the prosecutors were familiar with the general Brady rule.\n  Thus, Thompson cannot rely on the lack of an ability to cope with\n  constitutional situations that underlies the Canton hypothetical, but\n  must assert that prosecutors were not trained about particular Brady\n  evidence or the specific scenario related to the violation in his case.\n  That sort of nuance simply cannot support an inference of deliberate\n  indifference here. Contrary to the holding below, it does not follow\n  that, because Brady has gray areas and some Brady decisions are dif\n  ficult, prosecutors will so obviously make wrong decisions that failing\n  to train them amounts, as it must, to “a decision by the city itself to\n  violate the Constitution.” Canton, 489 U.

JOHN THOMPSON\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 29, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office now con\ncedes that, in prosecuting respondent John Thompson for\nattempted armed robbery, prosecutors failed to disclose\nevidence that should have been turned over to the defense\nunder Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). Thompson\nwas convicted. Because of that conviction Thompson\nelected not to testify in his own defense in his later trial\nfor murder, and he was again convicted. Thompson spent\n18 years in prison, including 14 years on death row. One\nmonth before Thompson’s scheduled execution, his inves\ntigator discovered the undisclosed evidence from his\narmed robbery trial. The reviewing court determined that\nthe evidence was exculpatory, and both of Thompson’s\nconvictions were vacated.\n   After his release from prison, Thompson sued petitioner\nHarry Connick, in his official capacity as the Orleans\nParish District Attorney, for damages under Rev. Stat.\n§1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983. Thompson alleged that Connick\nhad failed to train his prosecutors adequately about their\nduty to produce exculpatory evidence and that the lack of\n2                 CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntraining had caused the nondisclosure in Thompson’s rob\nbery case. The jury awarded Thompson $14 million,\nand the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed by\nan evenly divided en banc court. We granted certiorari to\ndecide whether a district attorney’s office may be held\nliable under §1983 for failure to train based on a single\nBrady violation. We hold that it cannot.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   In early 1985, John Thompson was charged with the\nmurder of Raymond T. Liuzza, Jr. in New Orleans. Pub\nlicity following the murder charge led the victims of an\nunrelated armed robbery to identify Thompson as their\nattacker. The district attorney charged Thompson with\nattempted armed robbery.\n   As part of the robbery investigation, a crime scene\ntechnician took from one of the victims’ pants a swatch of\nfabric stained with the robber’s blood. Approximately one\nweek before Thompson’s armed robbery trial, the swatch\nwas sent to the crime laboratory. Two days before the\ntrial, assistant district attorney Bruce Whittaker received\nthe crime lab’s report, which stated that the perpetrator\nhad blood type B. There is no evidence that the prosecu\ntors ever had Thompson’s blood tested or that they knew\nwhat his blood type was. Whittaker claimed he placed the\nreport on assistant district attorney James Williams’ desk,\nbut Williams denied seeing it. The report was never dis\nclosed to Thompson’s counsel.\n   Williams tried the armed robbery case with assistant\ndistrict attorney Gerry Deegan. On the first day of trial,\nDeegan checked all of the physical evidence in the case out\nof the police property room, including the blood-stained\nswatch. Deegan then checked all of the evidence but the\nswatch into the courthouse property room. The prosecu\ntors did not mention the swatch or the crime lab report at\n                   Cite as: 563 U.

Because\nof the armed robbery conviction, Thompson chose not to\ntestify in his own defense. He was convicted and sen\ntenced to death. State v. Thompson, 516 So. 2d 349 (La.\n1987). In the 14 years following Thompson’s murder\nconviction, state and federal courts reviewed and denied\nhis challenges to the conviction and sentence. See State ex\nrel. Thompson v. Cain, 95–2463 (La. 4/25/96), 672 So. 2d\n906; Thompson v. Cain, 161 F. 3d 802 (CA5 1998). The\nState scheduled Thompson’s execution for May 20, 1999.\n   In late April 1999, Thompson’s private investigator\ndiscovered the crime lab report from the armed robbery\ninvestigation in the files of the New Orleans Police Crime\nLaboratory. Thompson was tested and found to have\nblood type O, proving that the blood on the swatch was not\nhis. Thompson’s attorneys presented this evidence to the\ndistrict attorney’s office, which, in turn, moved to stay the\nexecution and vacate Thompson’s armed robbery convic\ntion.1 The Louisiana Court of Appeals then reversed\nThompson’s murder conviction, concluding that the armed\nrobbery conviction unconstitutionally deprived Thompson\nof his right to testify in his own defense at the murder\ntrial.

Following a disciplinary complaint by\nthe district attorney’s office, the Supreme Court of Louisiana repri\nmanded Riehlmann for failing to disclose Deegan’s admission earlier.\nIn re Riehlmann, 2004–0680 (La. 1/19/05), 891 So. 2d 1239.\n4                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nretried Thompson for Liuzza’s murder.2 The jury found\nhim not guilty.\n                               B\n   Thompson then brought this action against the district\nattorney’s office, Connick, Williams, and others, alleging\nthat their conduct caused him to be wrongfully convicted,\nincarcerated for 18 years, and nearly executed. The only\nclaim that proceeded to trial was Thompson’s claim under\n§1983 that the district attorney’s office had violated Brady\nby failing to disclose the crime lab report in his armed\nrobbery trial. See Brady, 373 U. S. 83. Thompson alleged\nliability under two theories: (1) the Brady violation was\ncaused by an unconstitutional policy of the district attor\nney’s office; and (2) the violation was caused by Connick’s\ndeliberate indifference to an obvious need to train the\nprosecutors in his office in order to avoid such constitu\ntional violations.\n   Before trial, Connick conceded that the failure to pro\nduce the crime lab report constituted a Brady violation.3\nSee Record EX608, EX880. Accordingly, the District Court\ninstructed the jury that the “only issue” was whether the\nnondisclosure was caused by either a policy, practice, or\ncustom of the district attorney’s office or a deliberately\nindifferent failure to train the office’s prosecutors.

Prosecutors testified that office policy was to\nturn crime lab reports and other scientific evidence over\nto the defense. They also testified that, after the discovery\nof the undisclosed crime lab report in 1999, prosecutors\ndisagreed about whether it had to be disclosed under\nBrady absent knowledge of Thompson’s blood type.\n   The jury rejected Thompson’s claim that an unconstitu\ntional office policy caused the Brady violation, but found\nthe district attorney’s office liable for failing to train the\nprosecutors. The jury awarded Thompson $14 million in\ndamages, and the District Court added more than $1\nmillion in attorney’s fees and costs.\n   After the verdict, Connick renewed his objection—which\nhe had raised on summary judgment—that he could not\nhave been deliberately indifferent to an obvious need for\nmore or different Brady training because there was no\nevidence that he was aware of a pattern of similar Brady\nviolations. The District Court rejected this argument for\nthe reasons that it had given in the summary judgment\norder. In that order, the court had concluded that a pat\ntern of violations is not necessary to prove deliberate\nindifference when the need for training is “so obvious.”\nNo. Civ. A. 03–2045 (ED La., Nov. 15, 2005), App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 141a, 2005 WL 3541035, *13. Relying on Canton\nv. Harris, 489 U. S. 378 (1989), the court had held that\nThompson could demonstrate deliberate indifference by\nproving that “the DA’s office knew to a moral certainty\nthat assistan[t] [district attorneys] would acquire Brady\nmaterial, that without training it is not always obvious\nwhat Brady requires, and that withholding Brady mate\nrial will virtually always lead to a substantial violation of\nconstitutional rights.”4 App. to Pet. for Cert. 141a, 2005\n——————\n 4 The   District Court rejected Connick’s proposed deliberate indiffer\n6                    CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nWL 3541035, *13.\n   A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\naffirmed. The panel acknowledged that Thompson did not\npresent evidence of a pattern of similar Brady violations,\n553 F. 3d 836, 851 (2008), but held that Thompson did not\nneed to prove a pattern, id., at 854. According to the\npanel, Thompson demonstrated that Connick was on\nnotice of an obvious need for Brady training by presenting\nevidence “that attorneys, often fresh out of law school,\nwould undoubtedly be required to confront Brady issues\nwhile at the DA’s Office, that erroneous decisions regard\ning Brady evidence would result in serious constitutional\nviolations, that resolution of Brady issues was often un\nclear, and that training in Brady would have been help\nful.” 553 F. 3d, at 854.\n   The Court of Appeals sitting en banc vacated the panel\nopinion, granted rehearing, and divided evenly, thereby\naffirming the District Court. 578 F. 3d 293 (CA5 2009)\n(per curiam). In four opinions, the divided en banc court\ndisputed whether Thompson could establish municipal\nliability for failure to train the prosecutors based on the\nsingle Brady violation without proving a prior pattern of\nsimilar violations, and, if so, what evidence would make\nthat showing. We granted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                              II\n  The Brady violation conceded in this case occurred when\none or more of the four prosecutors involved with Thomp\nson’s armed robbery prosecution failed to disclose the\ncrime lab report to Thompson’s counsel. Under Thomp\nson’s failure-to-train theory, he bore the burden of proving\nboth (1) that Connick, the policymaker for the district\nattorney’s office, was deliberately indifferent to the need to\n——————\nence jury instruction—which would have required Thompson to prove a\npattern of similar violations—for the same reasons as the summary\njudgment motion.

Thus, we do not address whether\nthe alleged training deficiency, or some other cause, was the “ ‘moving\nforce,’ ” Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378, 389 (1989) (quoting Monell v.\nNew York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 694 (1978), and\nPolk County v. Dodson, 454 U. S. 312, 326 (1981)), that “actually\ncaused” the failure to disclose the crime lab report, Canton, supra, at\n391.\n   The same cannot be said for the dissent, however. Affirming the\nverdict in favor of Thompson would require finding both that he proved\ndeliberate indifference and that he proved causation. Perhaps unsur\nprisingly, the dissent has not conducted the second step of the analysis,\nwhich would require showing that the failure to provide particular\ntraining (which the dissent never clearly identifies) “actually caused”\nthe flagrant—and quite possibly intentional—misconduct that occurred\nin this case. See post, at 21 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.) (assuming that,\n“[h]ad Brady’s importance been brought home to prosecutors,” the\nviolation at issue “surely” would not have occurred). The dissent\nbelieves that evidence that the prosecutors allegedly “misappre\nhen[ded]” Brady proves causation. Post, at 27, n. 20. Of course, if\nevidence of a need for training, by itself, were sufficient to prove that\nthe lack of training “actually caused” the violation at issue, no causa\ntion requirement would be necessary because every plaintiff who\nsatisfied the deliberate indifference requirement would necessarily\nsatisfy the causation requirement.\n8                  CONNICK v.

See Monell v.\nNew York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 692\n(1978). But, under §1983, local governments are responsi\nble only for “their own illegal acts.” Pembaur v. Cincin\nnati, 475 U. S. 469, 479 (1986) (citing Monell, 436 U. S., at\n665–683). They are not vicariously liable under §1983 for\ntheir employees’ actions. See id., at 691; Canton, 489\nU. S., at 392; Board of Comm’rs of Bryan Cty. v. Brown,\n520 U. S. 397, 403 (1997) (collecting cases).\n  Plaintiffs who seek to impose liability on local govern\nments under §1983 must prove that “action pursuant to\nofficial municipal policy” caused their injury. Monell, 436\nU. S., at 691; see id., at 694. Official municipal policy\nincludes the decisions of a government’s lawmakers, the\nacts of its policymaking officials, and practices so persis\ntent and widespread as to practically have the force of law.\nSee ibid.; Pembaur, supra, at 480–481; Adickes v. S. H.\nKress & Co., 398 U. S. 144, 167–168 (1970). These are\n“action[s] for which the municipality is actually responsi\nble.” Pembaur, supra, at 479–480.\n  In limited circumstances, a local government’s decision\nnot to train certain employees about their legal duty to\navoid violating citizens’ rights may rise to the level of an\nofficial government policy for purposes of §1983. A mu\nnicipality’s culpability for a deprivation of rights is at its\nmost tenuous where a claim turns on a failure to train.\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nSee Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U. S. 808, 822–823\n(1985) (plurality opinion) (“[A] ‘policy’ of ‘inadequate train\ning’ ” is “far more nebulous, and a good deal further re\nmoved from the constitutional violation, than was the\npolicy in Monell”). To satisfy the statute, a municipality’s\nfailure to train its employees in a relevant respect must\namount to “deliberate indifference to the rights of persons\nwith whom the [untrained employees] come into contact.”\nCanton, 489 U. S., at 388. Only then “can such a short\ncoming be properly thought of as a city ‘policy or custom’\nthat is actionable under §1983.” Id., at 389.\n   “ ‘[D]eliberate indifference’ is a stringent standard of\nfault, requiring proof that a municipal actor disregarded a\nknown or obvious consequence of his action.” Bryan Cty.,\n520 U. S., at 410. Thus, when city policymakers are on\nactual or constructive notice that a particular omission in\ntheir training program causes city employees to violate\ncitizens’ constitutional rights, the city may be deemed\ndeliberately indifferent if the policymakers choose to\nretain that program. Id., at 407. The city’s “policy of\ninaction” in light of notice that its program will cause\nconstitutional violations “is the functional equivalent of a\ndecision by the city itself to violate the Constitution.”\nCanton, 489 U. S., at 395 (O’Connor, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part). A less stringent standard of fault\nfor a failure-to-train claim “would result in de facto re\nspondeat superior liability on municipalities . . . .” Id., at\n392; see also Pembaur, supra, at 483 (opinion of Brennan,\nJ.) (“[M]unicipal liability under §1983 attaches where—\nand only where—a deliberate choice to follow a course of\naction is made from among various alternatives by [the\nrelevant] officials . . .”).\n                            B\n  A pattern of similar constitutional violations by un\ntrained employees is “ordinarily necessary” to demonstrate\n10                     CONNICK v.

Policymakers’ “continued\nadherence to an approach that they know or should know\nhas failed to prevent tortious conduct by employees may\nestablish the conscious disregard for the consequences of\ntheir action—the ‘deliberate indifference’—necessary to\ntrigger municipal liability.” Id., at 407. Without notice\nthat a course of training is deficient in a particular re\nspect, decisionmakers can hardly be said to have deliber\nately chosen a training program that will cause violations\nof constitutional rights.\n   Although Thompson does not contend that he proved a\npattern of similar Brady violations, 553 F. 3d, at 851,\nvacated, 578 F. 3d 293 (en banc), he points out that, dur\ning the ten years preceding his armed robbery trial, Lou\nisiana courts had overturned four convictions because of\nBrady violations by prosecutors in Connick’s office.6 Those\nfour reversals could not have put Connick on notice that\nthe office’s Brady training was inadequate with respect to\nthe sort of Brady violation at issue here. None of those\ncases involved failure to disclose blood evidence, a crime\nlab report, or physical or scientific evidence of any kind.\nBecause those incidents are not similar to the violation at\nissue here, they could not have put Connick on notice that\nspecific training was necessary to avoid this constitutional\nviolation.7\n——————\n  6 Thompson    had every incentive at trial to attempt to establish a\npattern of similar violations, given that the jury instruction allowed\nthe jury to find deliberate indifference based on, among other things,\nprosecutors’ “history of mishandling” similar situations. Record 1619.\n   7 Thompson also asserts that this case is not about a “single incident”\n\nbecause up to four prosecutors may have been responsible for the\nnondisclosure of the crime lab report and, according to his allegations,\nwithheld additional evidence in his armed robbery and murder trials.\nBut contemporaneous or subsequent conduct cannot establish a pattern\nof violations that would provide “notice to the cit[y] and the opportunity\nto conform to constitutional dictates . . . .” Canton, 489 U.

He contends that\nthe Brady violation in his case was the “obvious” conse\nquence of failing to provide specific Brady training, and\nthat this showing of “obviousness” can substitute for the\npattern of violations ordinarily necessary to establish\nmunicipal culpability.\n   In Canton, the Court left open the possibility that, “in a\nnarrow range of circumstances,” a pattern of similar viola\ntions might not be necessary to show deliberate indiffer\nence. Bryan Cty., supra, at 409. The Court posed the\nhypothetical example of a city that arms its police force\nwith firearms and deploys the armed officers into the\npublic to capture fleeing felons without training the offi\ncers in the constitutional limitation on the use of deadly\nforce. Canton, supra, at 390, n. 10. Given the known\nfrequency with which police attempt to arrest fleeing\nfelons and the “predictability that an officer lacking spe\ncific tools to handle that situation will violate citizens’\nrights,” the Court theorized that a city’s decision not to\ntrain the officers about constitutional limits on the use of\ndeadly force could reflect the city’s deliberate indifference\nto the “highly predictable consequence,” namely, violations\nof constitutional rights. Bryan Cty., supra, at 409. The\nCourt sought not to foreclose the possibility, however rare,\nthat the unconstitutional consequences of failing to train\ncould be so patently obvious that a city could be liable\nunder §1983 without proof of a pre-existing pattern of\nviolations.\n—————— \n\n(O’Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Moreover, no \n\ncourt has ever found any of the other Brady violations that Thompson\n\nalleges occurred in his armed robbery and murder trials. \n\n12                CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Failure to train prosecutors in their Brady obligations\ndoes not fall within the narrow range of Canton’s hypothe\nsized single-incident liability. The obvious need for spe\ncific legal training that was present in the Canton scenario\nis absent here. Armed police must sometimes make split\nsecond decisions with life-or-death consequences. There is\nno reason to assume that police academy applicants are\nfamiliar with the constitutional constraints on the use of\ndeadly force. And, in the absence of training, there is no\nway for novice officers to obtain the legal knowledge they\nrequire. Under those circumstances there is an obvious\nneed for some form of training. In stark contrast, legal\n“[t]raining is what differentiates attorneys from average\npublic employees.” 578 F. 3d, at 304–305 (opinion of\nClement, J.).\n   Attorneys are trained in the law and equipped with the\ntools to interpret and apply legal principles, understand\nconstitutional limits, and exercise legal judgment. Before\nthey may enter the profession and receive a law license,\nall attorneys must graduate from law school or pass a\nsubstantive examination; attorneys in the vast majority of\njurisdictions must do both. See, e.g., La. State Bar Assn.\n(LSBA), Articles of Incorporation, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §37,\nch. 4, App., Art. 14, §7 (1988 West Supp.) (as amended\nthrough 1985). These threshold requirements are de\nsigned to ensure that all new attorneys have learned how\nto find, understand, and apply legal rules. Cf. United\nStates v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 658, 664 (1984) (noting\nthat the presumption “that the lawyer is competent to\nprovide the guiding hand that the defendant needs” ap\nplies even to young and inexperienced lawyers in their\nfirst jury trial and even when the case is complex).\n   Nor does professional training end at graduation. Most\njurisdictions require attorneys to satisfy continuing\neducation requirements. See, e.g., LSBA, Articles of In\ncorporation, Art. 16, Rule 1.1(b) (effective 1987); La. Sup.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCt. Rule XXX (effective 1988). Even those few jurisdic\ntions that do not impose mandatory continuing-education\nrequirements mandate that attorneys represent their\nclients competently and encourage attorneys to engage in\ncontinuing study and education. See, e.g., Mass. Rule\nProf. Conduct 1.1 and comment 6 (West 2006). Before\nLouisiana adopted continuing-education requirements, it\nimposed similar general competency requirements on its\nstate bar. LSBA, Articles of Incorporation, Art. 16, EC 1–\n1, 1–2, DR 6–101 (West 1974) (effective 1971).\n   Attorneys who practice with other attorneys, such as in\ndistrict attorney’s offices, also train on the job as they\nlearn from more experienced attorneys. For instance, here\nin the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office, junior\nprosecutors were trained by senior prosecutors who super\nvised them as they worked together to prepare cases for\ntrial, and trial chiefs oversaw the preparation of the cases.\nSenior attorneys also circulated court decisions and in\nstructional memoranda to keep the prosecutors abreast of\nrelevant legal developments.\n   In addition, attorneys in all jurisdictions must satisfy\ncharacter and fitness standards to receive a law license\nand are personally subject to an ethical regime designed to\nreinforce the profession’s standards. See, e.g., LSBA,\nArticles of Incorporation, Art. 14, §7 (1985); see generally\nid., Art. 16 (1971) (Code of Professional Responsibility).\nTrial lawyers have a “duty to bring to bear such skill and\nknowledge as will render the trial a reliable adversarial\ntesting process.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668,\n688 (1984). Prosecutors have a special “duty to seek jus\ntice, not merely to convict.” LSBA, Articles of Incorpora\ntion, Art. 16, EC 7–13 (1971); ABA Standards for Criminal\nJustice 3–1.1(c) (2d ed. 1980). Among prosecutors’ unique\nethical obligations is the duty to produce Brady evidence\nto the defense. See, e.g., LSBA, Articles of Incorporation,\nArt. 16, EC 7–13 (1971); ABA Model Rule of Prof. Conduct\n14                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n3.8(d) (1984).8 An attorney who violates his or her ethical\nobligations is subject to professional discipline, including\nsanctions, suspension, and disbarment. See, e.g., LSBA,\nArticles of Incorporation, Art. 15, §§5, 6 (1971); id., Art.\n16, DR 1–102; ABA Model Rule of Prof. Conduct 8.4\n(1984).\n  In light of this regime of legal training and professional\nresponsibility, recurring constitutional violations are not\nthe “obvious consequence” of failing to provide prosecutors\nwith formal in-house training about how to obey the law.\nBryan Cty., 520 U. S., at 409. Prosecutors are not only\nequipped but are also ethically bound to know what Brady\nentails and to perform legal research when they are uncer\ntain. A district attorney is entitled to rely on prosecutors’\nprofessional training and ethical obligations in the ab\n——————\n  8 The   Louisiana State Bar Code of Professional Responsibility in\ncluded a broad understanding of the prosecutor’s duty to disclose in\n1985:\n“With respect to evidence and witnesses, the prosecutor has responsi\nbilities different from those of a lawyer in private practice: the prosecu\ntor should make timely disclosure to the defense of available evidence,\nknown to him, that tends to negate the guilt of the accused, mitigate\nthe degree of the offense, or reduce the punishment. Further, a prose\ncutor should not intentionally avoid pursuit of evidence merely because\nhe believes it will damage the prosecution’s case or aid the accused.”\nLSBA, Articles of Incorporation, Art. 16, EC 7–13 (1971); see also ABA\nModel Rule of Prof. Conduct 3.8(d) (1984) (“The prosecutor in a criminal\ncase shall . . . make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or\ninformation known to the prosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of\nthe accused or mitigates the offense . . .”).\n  In addition to these ethical rules, the Louisiana Code of Criminal\nProcedure, with which Louisiana prosecutors are no doubt familiar, in\n1985 required prosecutors, upon order of the court, to permit inspection\nof evidence “favorable to the defendant . . . which [is] material and\nrelevant to the issue of guilt or punishment,” La. Code Crim. Proc.\nAnn., Art. 718 (West 1981) (added 1977), as well as “any results or\nreports” of “scientific tests or experiments, made in connection with\nor material to the particular case” if those reports are exculpatory or\nintended for use at trial, id., Art. 719.\n                      Cite as: 563 U.

S., at 391. A licensed attorney making legal judg\nments, in his capacity as a prosecutor, about Brady mate\nrial simply does not present the same “highly predictable”\nconstitutional danger as Canton’s untrained officer.\n   A second significant difference between this case and\nthe example in Canton is the nuance of the allegedly\nnecessary training. The Canton hypothetical assumes\nthat the armed police officers have no knowledge at all of\nthe constitutional limits on the use of deadly force. But it\nis undisputed here that the prosecutors in Connick’s office\nwere familiar with the general Brady rule. Thompson’s\ncomplaint therefore cannot rely on the utter lack of an\nability to cope with constitutional situations that underlies\nthe Canton hypothetical, but rather must assert that\nprosecutors were not trained about particular Brady evi\ndence or the specific scenario related to the violation in his\ncase. That sort of nuance simply cannot support an infer\nence of deliberate indifference here. As the Court said in\nCanton, “[i]n virtually every instance where a person has\nhad his or her constitutional rights violated by a city\nemployee, a §1983 plaintiff will be able to point to some\nthing the city ‘could have done’ to prevent the unfortunate\nincident.” 489 U. S., at 392 (citing Tuttle, 471 U. S., at 823\n(plurality opinion)).\n   Thompson suggests that the absence of any formal\ntraining sessions about Brady is equivalent to the com\nplete absence of legal training that the Court imagined in\n\n——————\n  9 Contrary to the dissent’s assertion, see post, at 31, n. 26 (citing post,\nat 18–20), a prosecutor’s youth is not a “specific reason” not to rely on\nprofessional training and ethical obligations.

But failure-to-train liability is concerned with the\nsubstance of the training, not the particular instructional\nformat. The statute does not provide plaintiffs or courts\ncarte blanche to micromanage local governments through\nout the United States.\n  We do not assume that prosecutors will always make\ncorrect Brady decisions or that guidance regarding specific\nBrady questions would not assist prosecutors. But show\ning merely that additional training would have been\nhelpful in making difficult decisions does not establish\nmunicipal liability. “[P]rov[ing] that an injury or accident\ncould have been avoided if an [employee] had had better or\nmore training, sufficient to equip him to avoid the particu\nlar injury-causing conduct” will not suffice. Canton, su\npra, at 391. The possibility of single-incident liability that\nthe Court left open in Canton is not this case.10\n                              2\n  The dissent rejects our holding that Canton’s hypothe\nsized single-incident liability does not, as a legal matter,\nencompass failure to train prosecutors in their Brady\nobligation. It would instead apply the Canton hypotheti\ncal to this case, and thus devotes almost all of its opinion\nto explaining why the evidence supports liability under\nthat theory.11 But the dissent’s attempt to address our\n——————\n   10 Thompson also argues that he proved deliberate indifference by\n\n“direct evidence of policymaker fault” and so, presumably, did not need\nto rely on circumstantial evidence at all. Brief for Respondent 37. In\nsupport, Thompson contends that Connick created a “culture of indif\nference” in the district attorney’s office, id., at 38, as evidenced by\nConnick’s own allegedly inadequate understanding of Brady, the office’s\nunwritten Brady policy that was later incorporated into a 1987 hand\nbook, and an officewide “restrictive discovery policy,” Brief for Respon\ndent 39–40. This argument is essentially an assertion that Connick’s\noffice had an unconstitutional policy or custom. The jury rejected this\nclaim, and Thompson does not challenge that finding.\n   11 The dissent spends considerable time finding new Brady violations\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nholding—by pointing out that not all prosecutors will\nnecessarily have enrolled in criminal procedure class—\nmisses the point. See post, at 29–30. The reason why the\nCanton hypothetical is inapplicable is that attorneys,\nunlike police officers, are equipped with the tools to find,\n——————\nin Thompson’s trials. See post, at 3–13. How these violations are\nrelevant even to the dissent’s own legal analysis is “a mystery.” Post, at\n4, n. 2.     The dissent does not list these violations among the\n“[a]bundant evidence” that it believes supports the jury’s finding that\nBrady training was obviously necessary. Post, at 16. Nor does the\ndissent quarrel with our conclusion that contemporaneous or subse\nquent conduct cannot establish a pattern of violations. The only point\nappears to be to highlight what the dissent sees as sympathetic, even if\nlegally irrelevant, facts.\n   In any event, the dissent’s findings are highly suspect. In finding two\nof the “new” violations, the dissent belatedly tries to reverse the Court\nof Appeals’ 1998 decision that those Brady claims were “without merit.”\nCompare Thompson v. Cain, 161 F. 3d 802, 806–808 (CA5) (rejecting\nBrady claims regarding the Perkins-Liuzza audiotapes and the Perkins\npolice report), with post, at 8–9 (concluding that these were Brady\nviolations). There is no basis to the dissent’s suggestion that materially\nnew facts have called the Court of Appeals’ 1998 decision into question.\nCf. State v. Thompson, 2002–0361, p. 6 (La. App. 7/17/02), 825 So. 2d\n552, 555 (noting Thompson’s admission that some of his current Brady\nclaims “ha[ve] been rejected by both the Louisiana Supreme Court and\nthe federal courts”). Regarding the blood-stained swatch, which the\ndissent asserts prosecutors “blocked” the defense from inspecting by\nsending it to the crime lab for testing, post, at 6, Thompson’s counsel\nconceded at oral argument that trial counsel had access to the evidence\nlocker where the swatch was recorded as evidence. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n37, 42; Record EX42, EX43 (evidence card identifying “One (1) Piece of\nVictims [sic] Right Pants Leg, W/Blood” among the evidence in the\nevidence locker and indicating that some evidence had been checked\nout); Tr. 401 (testimony from Thompson’s counsel that he “[w]ent down\nto the evidence room and checked all of the evidence”); id., at 103, 369–\n370, 586, 602 (testimony that evidence card was “available to the\npublic,” would have been available to Thompson’s counsel, and would\nhave been seen by Thompson’s counsel because it was stapled to the\nevidence bag in “the normal process”). Moreover, the dissent cannot\nseriously believe that the jury could have found Brady violations—\nindisputably, questions of law. See post, at 12, n. 10, 15, n. 11.\n18                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpret, and apply legal principles.\n   By the end of its opinion, however, the dissent finally\nreveals that its real disagreement is not with our holding\ntoday, but with this Court’s precedent. The dissent does\nnot see “any reason,” post, at 31, for the Court’s conclusion\nin Bryan County that a pattern of violations is “ordinarily\nnecessary” to demonstrate deliberate indifference for\npurposes of failure to train, 520 U. S., at 409. Cf. id., at\n406–408 (explaining why a pattern of violations is ordinar\nily necessary). But cf. post, at 30–31 (describing our reli\nance on Bryan County as “imply[ing]” a new “limitation”\non §1983). As our precedent makes clear, proving that a\nmunicipality itself actually caused a constitutional viola\ntion by failing to train the offending employee presents\n“difficult problems of proof,” and we must adhere to a\n“stringent standard of fault,” lest municipal liability under\n§1983 collapse into respondeat superior.12 Bryan County,\n520 U. S., at 406, 410; see Canton, 489 U. S., at 391–392.\n                            3\n  The District Court and the Court of Appeals panel erro\nneously believed that Thompson had proved deliberate\nindifference by showing the “obviousness” of a need for\nadditional training. They based this conclusion on Con\nnick’s awareness that (1) prosecutors would confront\n——————\n   12 Although the dissent acknowledges that “deliberate indifference\n\nliability and respondeat superior liability are not one and the same,” the\nopinion suggests that it believes otherwise. Post, at 32, n. 28; see, e.g.,\npost, at 32 (asserting that “the buck stops with [the district attorney]”);\npost, at 23 (suggesting municipal liability attaches when “the prosecu\ntors” themselves are “deliberately indifferent to what the law re\nquires”). We stand by the longstanding rule—reaffirmed by a unani\nmous Court earlier this Term—that to prove a violation of §1983, a\nplaintiff must prove that “the municipality’s own wrongful conduct”\ncaused his injury, not that the municipality is ultimately responsible\nfor the torts of its employees. Los Angeles County v. Humphries, ante,\nat 9; see Humphries, ante, at 6, 7 (citing Monell, 436 U. S., at 691).\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

This is insufficient.\n  It does not follow that, because Brady has gray areas\nand some Brady decisions are difficult, prosecutors will so\nobviously make wrong decisions that failing to train them\namounts to “a decision by the city itself to violate the\nConstitution.” Canton, 489 U. S., at 395 (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). To prove delib\nerate indifference, Thompson needed to show that Connick\nwas on notice that, absent additional specified training, it\nwas “highly predictable” that the prosecutors in his office\nwould be confounded by those gray areas and make incor\nrect Brady decisions as a result. In fact, Thompson had to\nshow that it was so predictable that failing to train the\nprosecutors amounted to conscious disregard for defen\ndants’ Brady rights. See Bryan Cty., 520 U. S., at 409;\nCanton, supra, at 389. He did not do so.\n                              III\n  The role of a prosecutor is to see that justice is done.\nBerger v. United States, 295 U. S. 78, 88 (1935). “It is as\nmuch [a prosecutor’s] duty to refrain from improper meth\nods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to\nuse every legitimate means to bring about a just one.”\nIbid. By their own admission, the prosecutors who tried\nThompson’s armed robbery case failed to carry out that\nresponsibility. But the only issue before us is whether\nConnick, as the policymaker for the district attorney’s\noffice, was deliberately indifferent to the need to train the\nattorneys under his authority.\n  We conclude that this case does not fall within the\n20                 CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnarrow range of “single-incident” liability hypothesized in\nCanton as a possible exception to the pattern of violations\nnecessary to prove deliberate indifference in §1983 actions\nalleging failure to train. The District Court should have\ngranted Connick judgment as a matter of law on the fail\nure-to-train claim because Thompson did not prove a\npattern of similar violations that would “establish that the\n‘policy of inaction’ [was] the functional equivalent of a\ndecision by the city itself to violate the Constitution.”\nCanton, supra, at 395 (opinion of O’Connor, J.).\n  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Fifth Circuit is reversed.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

I write separately only\nto address several aspects of the dissent.\n  1. The dissent’s lengthy excavation of the trial record is\na puzzling exertion. The question presented for our re\nview is whether a municipality is liable for a single Brady\nviolation by one of its prosecutors, even though no pattern\nor practice of prior violations put the municipality on\nnotice of a need for specific training that would have pre\nvented it. See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963).\nThat question is a legal one: whether a Brady violation\npresents one of those rare circumstances we hypothesized\nin Canton’s footnote 10, in which the need for training in\nconstitutional requirements is so obvious ex ante that the\nmunicipality’s failure to provide that training amounts\nto deliberate indifference to constitutional violations. See\nCanton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378, 390, n. 10 (1989).\n  The dissent defers consideration of this question until\npage 23 of its opinion. It first devotes considerable space\nto allegations that Connick’s prosecutors misunderstood\nBrady when asked about it at trial, see post, at 16–18\n(opinion of GINSBURG, J.), and to supposed gaps in the\nBrady guidance provided by Connick’s office to prosecu\ntors, including deficiencies (unrelated to the specific Brady\n2                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                         SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nviolation at issue in this case) in a policy manual pub\nlished by Connick’s office three years after Thompson’s\ntrial, see post, at 18–21. None of that is relevant. Thomp\nson’s failure-to-train theory at trial was not based on a\npervasive culture of indifference to Brady, but rather on\nthe inevitability of mistakes over enough iterations of\ncriminal trials. The District Court instructed the jury it\ncould find Connick deliberately indifferent if:\n       “First: The District Attorney was certain that prosecu\n       tors would confront the situation where they would\n       have to decide which evidence was required by the\n       constitution to be provided to an accused[;]\n       “Second: The situation involved a difficult choice, or\n       one that prosecutors had a history of mishandling,\n       such that additional training, supervision, or monitor\n       ing was clearly needed[; and]\n       “Third: The wrong choice by a prosecutor in that\n       situation will frequently cause a deprivation of an ac\n       cused’s constitutional rights.” App. 828.\n  That theory of deliberate indifference would repeal the\nlaw of Monell1 in favor of the Law of Large Numbers.\nBrady mistakes are inevitable. So are all species of error\nroutinely confronted by prosecutors: authorizing a bad\nwarrant; losing a Batson2 claim; crossing the line in clos\ning argument; or eliciting hearsay that violates the Con\nfrontation Clause. Nevertheless, we do not have “de facto\nrespondeat superior liability,” Canton, 489 U. S., at 392,\nfor each such violation under the rubric of failure-to-train\nsimply because the municipality does not have a profes\nsional educational program covering the specific violation\nin sufficient depth.3 Were Thompson’s theory the law,\n——————\n    1 Monell\n          v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658 (1978).\n    2 Batson\n          v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986).\n  3 I do not share the dissent’s confidence that this result will be\n\navoided by the instruction’s requirement that “ ‘more likely than not the\n                    Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                   3\n\n                        SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nthere would have been no need for Canton’s footnote to\nconfine its hypothetical to the extreme circumstance of\narming police officers with guns without telling them\nabout the constitutional limitations upon shooting fleeing\nfelons; the District Court’s instructions cover every recur\nring situation in which citizens’ rights can be violated.\n   That result cannot be squared with our admonition that\nfailure-to-train liability is available only in “limited cir\ncumstances,” id., at 387, and that a pattern of consti\ntutional violations is “ordinarily necessary to establish\nmunicipal culpability and causation,” Board of Comm’rs of\nBryan Cty. v. Brown, 520 U. S. 397, 409 (1997). These\nrestrictions are indispensable because without them,\n“failure to train” would become a talismanic incantation\nproducing municipal liability “[i]n virtually every instance\nwhere a person has had his or her constitutional rights\nviolated by a city employee”—which is what Monell re\njects. Canton, 489 U. S., at 392. Worse, it would “engage\nthe federal courts in an endless exercise of second\nguessing municipal employee-training programs,” thereby\ndiminishing the autonomy of state and local governments.\nIbid.\n   2. Perhaps for that reason, the dissent does not seri\nously contend that Thompson’s theory of recovery was\nproper. Rather, it accuses Connick of acquiescing in that\ntheory at trial. See post, at 25. The accusation is false.\nConnick’s central claim was and is that failure-to-train\n\n—————— \n\nBrady material would have been produced if the prosecutors involved in \n\nhis underlying criminal cases had been properly trained, supervised or \n\nmonitored regarding the production of Brady evidence.’ ” Post, at 25, \n\nn. 17 (quoting Tr. 1100). How comforting that assurance is depends\nentirely on what proper training consists of. If it is not limited to\ntraining in aspects of Brady that have been repeatedly violated, but\nincludes—as the dissent would have it include here—training that\nwould avoid any one-time violation, the assurance is no assurance at\nall.\n4                       CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                          SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nliability for a Brady violation cannot be premised on a\nsingle incident, but requires a pattern or practice of previ\nous violations. He pressed that argument at the summary\njudgment stage but was rebuffed. At trial, when Connick\noffered a jury instruction to the same effect, the trial judge\neffectively told him to stop bringing up the subject:\n        “[Connick’s counsel]: Also, as part of that definition\n     in that same location, Your Honor, we would like to\n     include language that says that deliberate indiffer\n     ence to training requires a pattern of similar viola\n     tions and proof of deliberate indifference requires\n     more than a single isolated act.\n        “[Thompson’s counsel]: That’s not the law, Your\n     Honor.\n        “THE COURT: No, I’m not giving that. That was in\n     your motion for summary judgment that I denied.”\n     Tr. 1013.\nNothing more is required to preserve a claim of error. See\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 51(d)(1)(B).4\n  3. But in any event, to recover from a municipality\nunder 42 U. S. C. §1983, a plaintiff must satisfy a “rigor\nous” standard of causation, Bryan Cty., 520 U. S., at 405;\nhe must “demonstrate a direct causal link between the\n\n——————\n  4 The dissent’s contention that “[t]he instruction Connick proposed\n\nresembled the charge given by the District Court,” post, at 25, n. 18,\ndisregards his requested instruction concerning the necessity of a\npattern of prior violations. It is meaningless to say that after “the court\nrejected [Connick’s] categorical position,” as it did, he did not “assail the\nDistrict Court’s formulation of the deliberate indifference instruction,”\npost, at 26, n. 18. The prior-pattern requirement was part of Connick’s\nrequested formulation of deliberate indifference: “To prove deliberate\nindifference, a plaintiff must demonstrate ‘at least a pattern of similar\nviolations arising from training that is so clearly inadequate as to be\nobviously likely to result in a constitutional violation.’ ” Record, Doc.\n94, p. 18 (emphasis added).\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                      SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nmunicipal action and the deprivation of federal rights.”\nId., at 404. Thompson cannot meet that standard. The\nwithholding of evidence in his case was almost certainly\ncaused not by a failure to give prosecutors specific train\ning, but by miscreant prosecutor Gerry Deegan’s willful\nsuppression of evidence he believed to be exculpatory, in\nan effort to railroad Thompson. According to Deegan’s\ncolleague Michael Riehlmann, in 1994 Deegan confessed to\nhim—in the same conversation in which Deegan revealed\nhe had only a few months to live—that he had “suppressed\nblood evidence in the armed robbery trial of John Thomp\nson that in some way exculpated the defendant.” App.\n367; see also id., at 362 (“[Deegan] told me . . . that he had\nfailed to inform the defense of exculpatory information”). I\nhave no reason to disbelieve that account, particularly\nsince Riehlmann’s testimony hardly paints a flattering\npicture of himself: Riehlmann kept silent about Deegan’s\nmisconduct for another five years, as a result of which he\nincurred professional sanctions. See In re Riehlmann,\n2004–0680 (La. 1/19/05), 891 So. 2d 1239.              And if\nRiehlmann’s story is true, then the “moving force,” Bryan\nCty., supra, at 404 (internal quotation marks omitted),\nbehind the suppression of evidence was Deegan, not a\nfailure of continuing legal education.\n  4. The dissent suspends disbelief about this, insisting\nthat with proper Brady training, “surely at least one” of\nthe prosecutors in Thompson’s trial would have turned\nover the lab report and blood swatch. Post, at 21. But\ntraining must consist of more than mere broad encomiums\nof Brady: We have made clear that “the identified defi\nciency in a city’s training program [must be] closely re\nlated to the ultimate injury.” Canton, supra, at 391. So\neven indulging the dissent’s assumption that Thompson’s\nprosecutors failed to disclose the lab report in good faith—\nin a way that could be prevented by training—what sort of\n6                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                         SCALIA, J., concurring\n\ntraining would have prevented the good-faith nondisclo\nsure of a blood report not known to be exculpatory?\n   Perhaps a better question to ask is what legally accurate\ntraining would have prevented it. The dissent’s sugges\ntion is to instruct prosecutors to ignore the portion of\nBrady limiting prosecutors’ disclosure obligations to evi\ndence that is “favorable to an accused,” 373 U. S., at 87.\nInstead, the dissent proposes that “Connick could have\ncommunicated to Orleans Parish prosecutors, in no uncer\ntain terms, that, ‘[i]f you have physical evidence that, if\ntested, can establish the innocence of the person who is\ncharged, you have to turn it over.’ ” Post, at 20, n. 13\n(quoting Tr. of Oral Arg. 34). Though labeled a training\nsuggestion, the dissent’s proposal is better described as a\nsub silentio expansion of the substantive law of Brady. If\nany of our cases establishes such an obligation, I have\nnever read it, and the dissent does not cite it.5\n   Since Thompson’s trial, however, we have decided a case\nthat appears to say just the opposite of the training the\ndissent would require: In Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U. S.\n51, 58 (1988), we held that “unless a criminal defendant\ncan show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to\npreserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a\ndenial of due process of law.” We acknowledged that\n“Brady . . . makes the good or bad faith of the State irrele\nvant when the State fails to disclose to the defendant\nmaterial exculpatory evidence,” but concluded that “the\n——————\n  5 What the dissent does cite in support of its theory comes from an\n\nunexpected source: Connick’s testimony about what qualifies as Brady\nmaterial. See post, at 20–21, n. 13. (“Or Connick could have told\nprosecutors what he told the jury when he was asked whether a prose\ncutor must disclose a crime lab report to the defense, even if the pros\necutor does not know the defendant’s blood type: ‘Under the law, it\nqualifies as Brady material.’ ” (quoting Tr. 872)). Given the effort the\ndissent has expended persuading us that Connick’s understanding of\nBrady is profoundly misguided, its newfound trust in his expertise on\nthe subject is, to the say the least, surprising.\n                      Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                      7\n\n                          SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nDue Process Clause requires a different result when we\ndeal with the failure of the State to preserve evidentiary\nmaterial of which no more can be said than that it could\nhave been subjected to tests, the results of which might\nhave exonerated the defendant.” Id., at 57. Perhaps one\nday we will recognize a distinction between good-faith\nfailures to preserve from destruction evidence whose\ninculpatory or exculpatory character is unknown, and\ngood-faith failures to turn such evidence over to the de\nfense. But until we do so, a failure to train prosecutors to\nobserve that distinction cannot constitute deliberate indif\nference.\n   5. By now the reader has doubtless guessed the best\nkept secret of this case: There was probably no Brady\nviolation at all—except for Deegan’s (which, since it was a\nbad-faith, knowing violation, could not possibly be attrib\nuted to lack of training).6 The dissent surely knows this,\nwhich is why it leans heavily on the fact that Connick\nconceded that Brady was violated. I can honor that con\ncession in my analysis of the case because even if it ex\ntends beyond Deegan’s deliberate actions, it remains\nirrelevant to Connick’s training obligations. For any\nBrady violation apart from Deegan’s was surely on the\nvery frontier of our Brady jurisprudence; Connick could\nnot possibly have been on notice decades ago that he was\nrequired to instruct his prosecutors to respect a right to\nuntested evidence that we had not (and still have not)\n\n——————\n   6 The dissent’s only response to this is that the jury must have found\n\notherwise, since it was instructed that “ ‘[f]or liability to attach because\nof a failure to train, the fault must be in the training program itself, not\nin any particular prosecutor.’ ” Post, at 28, n. 20 (quoting Tr. 1098).\nBut this instruction did not require the jury to find that Deegan did not\ncommit a bad-faith, knowing violation; it merely prevented the jury\nfrom finding that, if he did so, Connick was liable for a failure to train.\nI not only agree with that; it is part of my point.\n8                 CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                    SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nrecognized. As a consequence, even if I accepted the dis\nsent’s conclusion that failure-to-train liability could be\npremised on a single Brady error, I could not agree that\nthe lack of an accurate training regimen caused the viola\ntion Connick has conceded.\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

JOHN THOMPSON\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [March 29, 2011] \n\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER,\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, and JUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting.\n  In Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, 87 (1963), this\nCourt held that due process requires the prosecution to\nturn over evidence favorable to the accused and material\nto his guilt or punishment. That obligation, the parties\nhave stipulated, was dishonored in this case; conse\nquently, John Thompson spent 18 years in prison, 14 of\nthem isolated on death row, before the truth came to light:\nHe was innocent of the charge of attempted armed rob\nbery, and his subsequent trial on a murder charge, by\nprosecutorial design, was fundamentally unfair.\n  The Court holds that the Orleans Parish District Attor\nney’s Office (District Attorney’s Office or Office) cannot be\nheld liable, in a civil rights action under 42 U. S. C. §1983,\nfor the grave injustice Thompson suffered. That is so, the\nCourt tells us, because Thompson has shown only an\naberrant Brady violation, not a routine practice of giving\nshort shrift to Brady’s requirements. The evidence pre\nsented to the jury that awarded compensation to Thomp\nson, however, points distinctly away from the Court’s\nassessment. As the trial record in the §1983 action re\nveals, the conceded, long-concealed prosecutorial trans\ngressions were neither isolated nor atypical.\n  From the top down, the evidence showed, members of\n2                  CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nthe District Attorney’s Office, including the District At\ntorney himself, misperceived Brady’s compass and there\nfore inadequately attended to their disclosure obligations.\nThroughout the pretrial and trial proceedings against\nThompson, the team of four engaged in prosecuting him\nfor armed robbery and murder hid from the defense and\nthe court exculpatory information Thompson requested\nand had a constitutional right to receive. The prosecutors\ndid so despite multiple opportunities, spanning nearly two\ndecades, to set the record straight. Based on the prosecu\ntors’ conduct relating to Thompson’s trials, a fact trier\ncould reasonably conclude that inattention to Brady was\nstandard operating procedure at the District Attorney’s\nOffice.\n   What happened here, the Court’s opinion obscures, was\nno momentary oversight, no single incident of a lone offi\ncer’s misconduct. Instead, the evidence demonstrated that\nmisperception and disregard of Brady’s disclosure re\nquirements were pervasive in Orleans Parish. That evi\ndence, I would hold, established persistent, deliberately\nindifferent conduct for which the District Attorney’s Office\nbears responsibility under §1983.\n   I dissent from the Court’s judgment mindful that Brady\nviolations, as this case illustrates, are not easily detected.\nBut for a chance discovery made by a defense team inves\ntigator weeks before Thompson’s scheduled execution, the\nevidence that led to his exoneration might have remained\nunder wraps. The prosecutorial concealment Thompson\nencountered, however, is bound to be repeated unless\nmunicipal agencies bear responsibility—made tangible by\n§1983 liability—for adequately conveying what Brady\nrequires and for monitoring staff compliance. Failure to\ntrain, this Court has said, can give rise to municipal liabil\nity under §1983 “where the failure . . . amounts to deliber\nate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the\n[untrained employees] come into contact.” Canton v.\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

That standard is well\nmet in this case.\n                              I\n   I turn first to a contextual account of the Brady viola\ntions that infected Thompson’s trials.\n                              A\n  In the early morning hours of December 6, 1984, an\nassailant shot and killed Raymond T. Liuzza, Jr., son of a\nprominent New Orleans business executive, on the street\nfronting the victim’s home. Only one witness saw the\nassailant. As recorded in two contemporaneous police\nreports, that eyewitness initially described the assailant\nas African-American, six feet tall, with “close cut hair.”\nRecord EX2–EX3, EX9.1 Thompson is five feet eight\ninches tall and, at the time of the murder, styled his hair\nin a large “Afro.” Id., at EX13. The police reports of the\nwitness’ immediate identification were not disclosed to\nThompson or to the court.\n  While engaged in the murder investigation, the Orleans\nParish prosecutors linked Thompson to another violent\ncrime committed three weeks later. On December 28, an\nassailant attempted to rob three siblings at gunpoint.\nDuring the struggle, the perpetrator’s blood stained the\noldest child’s pant leg. That blood, preserved on a swatch\nof fabric cut from the pant leg by a crime scene analyst,\nwas eventually tested. The test conclusively established\nthat the perpetrator’s blood was type B. Id., at EX151.\nThompson’s blood is type O. His prosecutors failed to\ndisclose the existence of the swatch or the test results.\n\n\n——————\n   1 Exhibits entered into evidence in Thompson’s §1983 trial are herein\n\ncited by reference to the page number in the exhibit binder compiled by\nthe District Court and included in the record on appeal.\n4                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n                              B\n  One month after the Liuzza murder, Richard Perkins, a\nman who knew Thompson, approached the Liuzza family.\nPerkins did so after the family’s announcement of a\n$15,000 reward for information leading to the murderer’s\nconviction. Police officers surreptitiously recorded the\nPerkins-Liuzza conversations.2 As documented on tape,\nPerkins told the family, “I don’t mind helping [you] catch\n[the perpetrator], . . . but I would like [you] to help me\nand, you know, I’ll help [you].” Id., at EX479, EX481.\nOnce the family assured Perkins, “we’re on your side, we\nwant to try and help you,” id., at EX481, Perkins inti\nmated that Thompson and another man, Kevin Freeman,\nhad been involved in Liuzza’s murder. Perkins thereafter\ntold the police what he had learned from Freeman about\nthe murder, and that information was recorded in a police\nreport. Based on Perkins’ account, Thompson and Free\nman were arrested on murder charges.\n  Freeman was six feet tall and went by the name “Kojak”\nbecause he kept his hair so closely trimmed that his scalp\nwas visible. Unlike Thompson, Freeman fit the eyewit\nness’ initial description of the Liuzza assailant’s height\nand hair style. As the Court notes, ante, at 4, n. 2, Free\nman became the key witness for the prosecution at\nThompson’s trial for the murder of Liuzza.\n  After Thompson’s arrest for the Liuzza murder, the\nfather of the armed robbery victims saw a newspaper\nphoto of Thompson with a large Afro hairstyle and showed\n——————\n    2 Themajority endorses the Fifth Circuit’s conclusion that, when\nThompson was tried for murder, no Brady violation occurred with\nrespect to these audio tapes “[b]ecause defense counsel had knowledge\nof such evidence and could easily have requested access from the\nprosecution.” Thompson v. Cain, 161 F. 3d 802, 806–807 (1998); ante,\nat 17, n. 11. The basis for that asserted “knowledge” is a mystery. The\nrecordings secretly made did not come to light until long after Thomp\nson’s trials.\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                    5\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nit to his children. He reported to the District Attorney’s\nOffice that the children had identified Thompson as their\nattacker, and the children then picked that same photo\nout of a “photographic lineup.” Record EX120, EX642–\nEX643. Indicting Thompson on the basis of these ques\ntionable identifications, the District Attorney’s Office did\nnot pause to test the pant leg swatch dyed by the perpe\ntrator’s blood. This lapse ignored or overlooked a prosecu\ntor’s notation that the Office “may wish to do [a] blood\ntest.” Id., at EX122.\n   The murder trial was scheduled to begin in mid-March\n1985. Armed with the later indictment against Thompson\nfor robbery, however, the prosecutors made a strategic\nchoice: They switched the order of the two trials, proceed\ning first on the robbery indictment. Id., at EX128–EX129.\nTheir aim was twofold. A robbery conviction gained first\nwould serve to inhibit Thompson from testifying in his\nown defense at the murder trial, for the prior conviction\ncould be used to impeach his credibility. In addition, an\narmed robbery conviction could be invoked at the penalty\nphase of the murder trial in support of the prosecution’s\nplea for the death penalty. Id., at 682.\n   Recognizing the need for an effective prosecution team,\npetitioner Harry F. Connick, District Attorney for the\nParish of Orleans, appointed his third-in-command, Eric\nDubelier, as special prosecutor in both cases. Dubelier\nenlisted Jim Williams to try the armed robbery case and to\nassist him in the murder case. Gerry Deegan assisted\nWilliams in the armed robbery case. Bruce Whittaker, the\nfourth prosecutor involved in the cases, had approved\nThompson’s armed robbery indictment.3\n\n——————\n  3 At the time of their assignment, Dubelier had served in the District\nAttorney’s Office for three and a half years, Williams, for four and a\nhalf years, Deegan, a recent law school graduate, for less than one year,\nand Whittaker, for three years.\n6                      CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n                              C\n   During pretrial proceedings in the armed robbery case,\nThompson filed a motion requesting access to all materials\nand information “favorable to the defendant” and “mate\nrial and relevant to the issue of guilt or punishment,” as\nwell as “any results or reports” of “scientific tests or ex\nperiments.” Id., at EX144, EX145. Prosecutorial re\nsponses to this motion fell far short of Brady compliance.4\n   First, prosecutors blocked defense counsel’s inspection of\nthe pant leg swatch stained by the robber’s blood. Al\nthough Dubelier’s April 3 response stated, “Inspection to\nbe permitted,” id., at EX149, the swatch was signed out\nfrom the property room at 10:05 a.m. the next day, and\nwas not returned until noon on April 10, the day before\ntrial, id., at EX43, EX670. Thompson’s attorney inspected\nthe evidence made available to him and found no blood\nevidence. No one told defense counsel about the swatch\nand its recent removal from the property room. Id., at\nEX701–EX702; Tr. 400–402. But cf. ante, at 17, n. 11\n(Thompson’s attorney had “access to the evidence locker\nwhere the swatch was recorded as evidence.”).5\n——————\n   4 Connick did not dispute that failure to disclose the swatch and the\n\ncrime lab report violated Brady. See Tr. 46, 1095. But cf. ante, at 4, 6\n(limiting Connick’s concession, as Connick himself did not, to failure to\ndisclose the crime lab report).\n   In JUSTICE SCALIA’s contrary view, “[t]here was probably no Brady\nviolation at all,” or, if there was any violation of Thompson’s rights, it\n“was surely on the very frontier of our Brady jurisprudence,” such that\n“Connick could not possibly have been on notice” of the need to train.\nAnte, at 7. Connick’s counsel, however, saw the matter differently.\n“[A]ny reasonable prosecutor would have recognized blood evidence as\nBrady material,” he said, indeed “the proper response” was “obvious to\nall.” Record 1663, 1665.\n   5 The majority assails as “highly suspect” the suggestion that prose\n\ncutors violated Brady by failing to disclose the blood-stained swatch.\nSee ante, at 17, n. 11. But the parties stipulated in Thompson’s §1983\naction, and the jury was so informed, that, “[p]rior to the armed robbery\ntrial, Mr. Thompson and his attorneys were not advised of the existence\n                      Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     7\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   Second, Dubelier or Whittaker ordered the crime labora\ntory to rush a pretrial test of the swatch. Tr. 952–954.\nWhittaker received the lab report, addressed to his atten\ntion, two days before trial commenced. Immediately\nthereafter, he placed the lab report on Williams’ desk.\nRecord EX151, EX589. Although the lab report conclu\nsively identified the perpetrator’s blood type, id., at\nEX151, the District Attorney’s Office never revealed the\nreport to the defense.6\n   Third, Deegan checked the swatch out of the property\nroom on the morning of the first day of trial, but the\nprosecution did not produce the swatch at trial. Id., at\nEX43. Deegan did not return the swatch to the property\nroom after trial, and the swatch has never been found. Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 37.\n   “[B]ased solely on the descriptions” provided by the\nthree victims, Record 683, the jury convicted Thompson of\nattempted armed robbery. The court sentenced him to\n49.5 years without possibility of parole—the maximum\navailable sentence.\n                          D\n  Prosecutors continued to disregard Brady during the\n——————\nof the blood evidence, that the evidence had been tested, [or] that a\nblood type was determined definitively from the swatch . . . .” Tr. 46.\nConsistent with this stipulation, Thompson’s trial counsel testified that\nhe spoke to “[t]he clerk who maintain[ed] the evidence” and learned\nthat “[t]hey didn’t have any blood evidence.” Id., at 401. And the\nDistrict Court instructed the jury, with no objection from Connick, “that\nthe nonproduced blood evidence . . . violated [Thompson’s] constitu\ntional rights as a matter of law.” Id., at 1095.\n   6 JUSTICE SCALIA questions petitioners’ concession that Brady was\n\nviolated when the prosecution failed to inform Thompson of the blood\nevidence. He considers the evidence outside Brady because the prose\ncution did not endeavor to test Thompson’s blood, and therefore avoided\nknowing that the evidence was in fact exculpatory. Ante, at 6–7. Such\na “don’t ask, don’t tell” view of a prosecutor’s Brady obligations garners\nno support from precedent. See also supra, at 6, n. 4; infra, at 21, n. 13.\n8                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nmurder trial, held in May 1985, at which the prosecution’s\norder-of-trial strategy achieved its aim.7 By prosecuting\nThompson for armed robbery first—and withholding blood\nevidence that might have exonerated Thompson of that\ncharge—the District Attorney’s Office disabled Thompson\nfrom testifying in his own defense at the murder trial.8 As\nearlier observed, see supra, at 5, impeaching use of the\nprior conviction would have severely undermined Thomp\nson’s credibility. And because Thompson was effectively\nstopped from testifying in his own defense, the testimony\nof the witnesses against him gained force. The prosecu\ntion’s failure to reveal evidence that could have impeached\nthose witnesses helped to seal Thompson’s fate.\n   First, the prosecution undermined Thompson’s efforts to\nimpeach Perkins. Perkins testified that he volunteered\ninformation to the police with no knowledge of reward\nmoney. Record EX366, EX372–EX373. Because prosecu\ntors had not produced the audiotapes of Perkins’ conversa\ntions with the Liuzza family (or a police summary of the\ntapes), Thompson’s attorneys could do little to cast doubt\non Perkins’ credibility. In closing argument, the prosecu\ntion emphasized that Thompson presented no “direct\nevidence” that reward money had motivated any of the\nwitnesses. Id., at EX3171–EX3172.\n   Second, the prosecution impeded Thompson’s impeach\nment of key witness Kevin Freeman. It did so by failing to\ndisclose a police report containing Perkins’ account of\n\n——————\n  7 During jury deliberations in the armed robbery case, Williams, the\n\nonly Orleans Parish trial attorney common to the two prosecutions, told\nThompson of his objective in no uncertain terms: “I’m going to fry you.\nYou will die in the electric chair.” Tr. 252–253.\n  8 The Louisiana Court of Appeal concluded, and Connick does not\n\ndispute, that Thompson “would have testified in the absence of the\nattempted armed robbery conviction.” State v. Thompson, 2002–0361,\np. 7 (7/17/02), 825 So. 2d 552, 556. But cf. ante, at 1, 3 (Thompson\n“elected” not to testify).\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nwhat he had learned from Freeman about the murder.\nSee supra, at 4. Freeman’s trial testimony was materially\ninconsistent with that report. Tr. 382–384, 612–614;\nRecord EX270–EX274. Lacking any knowledge of the police\nreport, Thompson could not point to the inconsistencies.\n   Third, and most vital, the eyewitness’ initial description\nof the assailant’s hair, see supra, at 3, was of prime rele\nvance, for it suggested that Freeman, not Thompson,\nmurdered Liuzza, see supra, at 4. The materiality of the\neyewitness’ contemporaneous description of the murderer\nshould have been altogether apparent to the prosecution.\nFailure to produce the police reports setting out what the\neyewitness first said not only undermined efforts to im\npeach that witness and the police officer who initially\ninterviewed him. The omission left defense counsel with\nout knowledge that the prosecutors were restyling the\nkiller’s “close cut hair” into an “Afro.”\n   Prosecutors finessed the discrepancy between the eye\nwitness’ initial description and Thompson’s appearance.\nThey asked leading questions prompting the eyewitness to\nagree on the stand that the perpetrator’s hair was “afro\ntype,” yet “straight back.” Record EX322–EX323. Cor\nroboratively, the police officer—after refreshing his recol\nlection by reviewing material at the prosecution’s table—\ngave artful testimony. He characterized the witness’\ninitial description of the perpetrator’s hair as “black and\nshort, afro style.” Id., at EX265 (emphasis added). As\nprosecutors well knew, nothing in the withheld police\nreports, which described the murderer’s hair simply as\n“close cut,” portrayed a perpetrator with an Afro or Afro\nstyle hair.\n   The jury found Thompson guilty of first-degree murder.\nHaving prevented Thompson from testifying that Freeman\nwas the killer, the prosecution delivered its ultimate\nargument. Because Thompson was already serving a\n10                CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nnear-life sentence for attempted armed robbery, the prose\ncution urged, the only way to punish him for murder was\nto execute him. The strategy worked as planned; Thomp\nson was sentenced to death.\n                             E\n   Thompson discovered the prosecutors’ misconduct\nthrough a serendipitous series of events. In 1994, nine\nyears after Thompson’s convictions, Deegan, the assistant\nprosecutor in the armed robbery trial, learned he was\nterminally ill. Soon thereafter, Deegan confessed to his\nfriend Michael Riehlmann that he had suppressed blood\nevidence in the armed robbery case. Id., at EX709.\nDeegan did not heed Riehlmann’s counsel to reveal what\nhe had done. For five years, Riehlmann, himself a former\nOrleans Parish prosecutor, kept Deegan’s confession to\nhimself. Id., at EX712–EX713.\n   On April 16, 1999, the State of Louisiana scheduled\nThompson’s execution. Id., at EX1366–EX1367. In an\neleventh-hour effort to save his life, Thompson’s attorneys\nhired a private investigator. Deep in the crime lab ar\nchives, the investigator unearthed a microfiche copy of the\nlab report identifying the robber’s blood type. The copy\nshowed that the report had been addressed to Whittaker.\nSee supra, at 7.         Thompson’s attorneys contacted\nWhittaker, who informed Riehlmann that the lab report\nhad been found. Riehlmann thereupon told Whittaker\nthat Deegan “had failed to turn over stuff that might have\nbeen exculpatory.” Tr. 718. Riehlmann prepared an\naffidavit describing Deegan’s disclosure “that he had\nintentionally suppressed blood evidence in the armed\nrobbery trial of John Thompson.” Record EX583.\n   Thompson’s lawyers presented to the trial court the\ncrime lab report showing that the robber’s blood type was\nB, and a report identifying Thompson’s blood type as O.\nThis evidence proved Thompson innocent of the robbery.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)          11\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nThe court immediately stayed Thompson’s execution, id.,\nat EX590, and commenced proceedings to assess the newly\ndiscovered evidence.\n  Connick sought an abbreviated hearing. A full hearing\nwas unnecessary, he urged, because the Office had con\nfessed error and had moved to dismiss the armed robbery\ncharges. See, e.g., id., at EX617. The court insisted on a\npublic hearing. Given “the history of this case,” the court\nsaid, it “was not willing to accept the representations that\n[Connick] and [his] office made [in their motion to dis\nmiss].” id., at EX882. After a full day’s hearing, the court\nvacated Thompson’s attempted armed robbery conviction\nand dismissed the charges. Before doing so, the court\nadmonished:\n    “[A]ll day long there have been a number of young As\n    sistant D. A.’s . . . sitting in this courtroom watching\n    this, and I hope they take home . . . and take to heart\n    the message that this kind of conduct cannot go on in\n    this Parish if this Criminal Justice System is going to\n    work.” Id., at EX883.\n  The District Attorney’s Office then initiated grand jury\nproceedings against the prosecutors who had withheld the\nlab report. Connick terminated the grand jury after just\none day. He maintained that the lab report would not be\nBrady material if prosecutors did not know Thompson’s\nblood type. Tr. 986; cf. supra, at 7, n. 6. And he told the\ninvestigating prosecutor that the grand jury “w[ould]\nmake [his] job more difficult.” Tr. 978–979. In protest,\nthat prosecutor tendered his resignation.\n                             F\n  Thereafter, the Louisiana Court of Appeal reversed\nThompson’s murder conviction. State v. Thompson, 2002–\n0361, p. 10 (7/17/02), 825 So. 2d 552, 558. The unlawfully\nprocured robbery conviction, the court held, had violated\n12                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nThompson’s right to testify and thus fully present his\ndefense in the murder trial. Id., at 557. The merits of\nseveral Brady claims arising out of the murder trial, the\ncourt observed, had therefore become “moot.” 825 So. 2d,\nat 555; see also Record 684.9 But cf. ante, at 10–11, n. 7,\n16–17, n. 11 (suggesting that there were no Brady viola\ntions in the murder prosecution because no court had\nadjudicated any violations).10\n——————\n   9 Thompson argued that “the State failed to produce police reports\n\n‘and other information’ which would have identified ‘eye- and ear\nwitnesses’ whose testimony would have exonerated him and inculpated\n[Freeman], . . . and would have shown that [Perkins,] . . . who stated\n[he] heard [Thompson] admit to committing the murder[,] had been\npromised reward money for [his] testimony.” Thompson, 825 So. 2d, at\n555. In leaving these arguments unaddressed, the Louisiana Court of\nAppeal surely did not defer to the Fifth Circuit’s earlier assessment\nof those claims, made on an anemic record, in Thompson v. Cain, 161\nF. 3d 802. Nor did the Louisiana Court of Appeal suggest that Thomp\nson was “belatedly tr[ying] to reverse” the Fifth Circuit’s decision. But\ncf. ante, at 17, n. 11.\n   10 The Court notes that in Thompson v. Cain, the Fifth Circuit re\n\njected Brady claims raised by Thompson, characterizing one of those\nclaims as “without merit.” Ante, at 17, n. 11 (quoting Thompson, 161\nF. 3d, at 807); see supra, at 4, n. 2. The Court, however, overlooks the\ndate of that Fifth Circuit decision. It was rendered before revelation of\nthe Brady violations in the armed robbery trial, before Thompson had\nthe opportunity for discovery in his §1983 suit, and before Thompson or\nany court was aware of the “close cut hair” police reports. See Thomp\nson, 161 F. 3d, at 812, n. 8. It is these later revelations, not the little\nThompson knew in 1998, that should count. For example, the Fifth\nCircuit, in 1998, believed that Perkins’ statement recorded in the police\nreport did not “differ from Freeman’s trial testimony.” Id., at 808. But\nevidence put before the jury in 2007 in the §1983 trial showed that the\npolice report, in several material respects, was inconsistent with\nFreeman’s trial testimony. Tr. 382–383.\n   Connick has never suggested to this Court that the jury in the §1983\ntrial was bound by the Fifth Circuit’s 1998 Brady rulings. That court\n“afford[ed] great deference to” the state trial court’s findings, made\nafter a 1995 post-conviction relief hearing. Thompson, 161 F. 3d, at\n805. The jury in the §1983 trial, of course, had far more extensive and\naccurate information on which to reach its decision. Moreover, as\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                   13\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n  Undeterred by his assistants’ disregard of Thompson’s\nrights, Connick retried him for the Liuzza murder.\nThompson’s defense was bolstered by evidence earlier\nunavailable to him: ten exhibits the prosecution had not\ndisclosed when Thompson was first tried. The newly\nproduced items included police reports describing the\nassailant in the murder case as having “close cut” hair, the\npolice report recounting Perkins’ meetings with the Liuzza\nfamily, see supra, at 3–4, audio recordings of those meet\nings, and a 35-page supplemental police report. After\ndeliberating for only 35 minutes, the jury found Thompson\nnot guilty.\n  On May 9, 2003, having served more than 18 years\nin prison for crimes he did not commit, Thompson was\nreleased.\n                              II\n   On July 16, 2003, Thompson commenced a civil action\nunder 42 U. S. C. §1983 alleging that Connick, other\nofficials of the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office,\nand the Office itself, had violated his constitutional rights\nby wrongfully withholding Brady evidence. Thompson\nsought to hold Connick and the District Attorney’s Office\nliable for failure adequately to train prosecutors concern\ning their Brady obligations. Such liability attaches, I\nagree with the Court, only when the failure “amount[s] to\n‘deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom\nthe [untrained employees] come into contact.’ ” Ante, at 9\n(quoting Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378, 388 (1989)). I\ndisagree, however, with the Court’s conclusion that\n——————\nearlier noted, the same trial court that made the 1995 findings was, in\n1999, outraged by the subsequently discovered Brady violations and by\nConnick’s reluctance to bring those violations to light. See supra, at\n10–11. Certainly that judge would not have wanted the jury that\nassessed Connick’s deliberate indifference in the §1983 trial to defer to\nfindings he earlier made on a notably incomplete record.\n14                 CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nThompson failed to prove deliberate indifference.\n   Having weighed all the evidence, the jury in the §1983\ncase found for Thompson, concluding that the District\nAttorney’s Office had been deliberately indifferent to\nThompson’s Brady rights and to the need for training and\nsupervision to safeguard those rights. “Viewing the evi\ndence in the light most favorable to [Thompson], as appro\npriate in light of the verdic[t] rendered by the jury,” Pat\nrick v. Burget, 486 U. S. 94, 98, n. 3 (1988), I see no cause\nto upset the District Court’s determination, affirmed by\nthe Fifth Circuit, that “ample evidence . . . adduced at\ntrial” supported the jury’s verdict. Record 1917.\n   Over 20 years ago, we observed that a municipality’s\nfailure to provide training may be so egregious that, even\nwithout notice of prior constitutional violations, the failure\n“could properly be characterized as ‘deliberate indiffer\nence’ to constitutional rights.” Canton, 489 U. S., at 390,\nn. 10. “[I]n light of the duties assigned to specific officers\nor employees,” Canton recognized, “it may happen that . . .\nthe need for more or different training is so obvious, and\nthe inadequacy so likely to result in the violation of consti\ntutional rights, that the policymakers . . . can reasonably\nbe said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need.”\nId., at 390. Thompson presented convincing evidence to\nsatisfy this standard.\n                             A\n  Thompson’s §1983 suit proceeded to a jury trial on two\ntheories of liability: First, the Orleans Parish Office’s\nofficial Brady policy was unconstitutional; and second,\nConnick was deliberately indifferent to an obvious need to\ntrain his prosecutors about their Brady obligations. Con\nnick’s Brady policy directed prosecutors to “turn over what\nwas required by state and federal law, but no more.” Brief\nfor Petitioners 6–7. The jury thus understandably rejected\nThompson’s claim that the official policy itself was uncon\n                      Cite as: 563 U.

Ante, at 5.\n  The jury found, however, that Connick was deliberately\nindifferent to the need to train prosecutors about Brady’s\ncommand. On the special verdict form, the jury answered\nyes to the following question:\n     “Was the Brady violation in the armed robbery case or\n     any infringements of John Thompson’s rights in the\n     murder trial substantially caused by [Connick’s] fail\n     ure, through deliberate indifference, to establish poli\n     cies and procedures to protect one accused of a crime\n     from these constitutional violations?” Record 1585.\n  Consistent with the question put to the jury, and with\nout objection, the court instructed the jurors: “[Y]ou are\nnot limited to the nonproduced blood evidence and the\nresulting infringement of Mr. Thompson’s right to testify\nat the murder trial. You may consider all of the evidence\npresented during this trial.” Tr. 1099; Record 1620.11 But\n——————\n  11 The   court permitted Thompson to introduce evidence of other\nBrady violations, but because “the blood evidence alone proved the\nviolation [of Thompson’s constitutional rights],” the court declined\nspecifically “to ask the jury [whether] this other stuff [was] also Brady.”\nTr. 1003. The court allowed Thompson to submit proof of other viola\ntions to “sho[w] the cumulative nature . . . and impact [of] evidence . . .\nas to . . . the training and deliberate indifference . . . .” Ibid. But cf.\nante, at 17, n. 11 (questioning how “these violations are relevant” to\nthis case). Far from indulging in my own factfindings, but cf. ante, at\n16–17, n. 11, I simply recite the evidence supporting the jury’s verdict\nin Thompson’s §1983 trial.\n   The Court misleadingly states that “the District Court instructed the\njury that the ‘only issue’ was whether the nondisclosure [of the crime\nlab report] was caused by either a policy, practice, or custom of the dis\ntrict attorney’s office or a deliberately indifferent failure to train the\noffice’s prosecutors.” Ante, at 4. The jury instruction the majority cites\nsimply directed the jury that, with regard to the blood evidence, as a\nmatter of law, Thompson’s constitutional rights had been violated.\nRecord 1614–1615. The court did not preclude the jury from assessing\nevidence of other infringements of Thompson’s rights. Id., at 1585; see\nKyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 421 (1995) (“[T]he state’s obligation\n16                   CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ncf. ante, at 2, 6, 10, n. 7, 16; ante, at 1 (SCALIA, J., concur\nring) (maintaining that the case involves a single Brady\nviolation). That evidence included a stipulation that in his\nretrial for the Liuzza murder, Thompson had introduced\nten exhibits containing relevant information withheld by\nthe prosecution in 1985. See supra, at 13.\n   Abundant evidence supported the jury’s finding that\nadditional Brady training was obviously necessary to\nensure that Brady violations would not occur: (1) Connick,\nthe Office’s sole policymaker, misunderstood Brady. (2)\nOther leaders in the Office, who bore direct responsibility\nfor training less experienced prosecutors, were similarly\nuninformed about Brady. (3) Prosecutors in the Office\nreceived no Brady training. (4) The Office shirked its\nresponsibility to keep prosecutors abreast of relevant legal\ndevelopments concerning Brady requirements. As a result\nof these multiple shortfalls, it was hardly surprising that\nBrady violations in fact occurred, severely undermining\nthe integrity of Thompson’s trials.\n                             1\n  Connick was the Office’s sole policymaker, and his\ntestimony exposed a flawed understanding of a prosecu\ntor’s Brady obligations. First, Connick admitted to the\njury that his earlier understanding of Brady, conveyed in\nprior sworn testimony, had been too narrow. Tr. 181–182.\nSecond, Connick confessed to having withheld a crime lab\nreport “one time as a prosecutor and I got indicted by the\nU. S. Attorney over here for doing it.” Id., at 872. Third,\neven at trial Connick persisted in misstating Brady’s\nrequirements. For example, Connick urged that there\ncould be no Brady violation arising out of “the inadvertent\nconduct of [an] assistant under pressure with a lot of case\n\n—————— \n\nunder Brady . . . turns on the cumulative effect of all . . . evidence \n\nsuppressed by the government . . . .”). \n\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

The court, however, correctly in\nstructed the jury that, in determining whether there has\nbeen a Brady violation, the “good or bad faith of the prose\ncution does not matter.” Tr. 1094–1095.\n                               2\n  The testimony of other leaders in the District Attorney’s\nOffice revealed similar misunderstandings. Those misun\nderstandings, the jury could find, were in large part re\nsponsible for the gross disregard of Brady rights Thomp\nson experienced.       Dubelier admitted that he never\nreviewed police files, but simply relied on the police to flag\nany potential Brady information. Tr. 542. The court,\nhowever, instructed the jury that an individual prosecutor\nhas a “duty . . . to learn of any favorable evidence known\nto others acting on the government’s behalf in the case,\nincluding the police.” Id., at 1095; Record 1614. Williams\nwas asked whether “Brady material includes documents in\nthe possession of the district attorney that could be used to\nimpeach a witness, to show that he’s lying”; he responded\nsimply, and mistakenly, “No.” Tr. 381. The testimony of\n“high-ranking individuals in the Orleans Parish District\nAttorney’s Office,” Thompson’s expert explained,12 exposed\n“complete errors . . . as to what Brady required [prosecu\ntors] to do.” Id., at 427, 434. “Dubelier had no under\nstanding of his obligations under Brady whatsoever,” id.,\nat 458, the expert observed, and Williams “is still not sure\n——————\n  12 With no objection from petitioners, the court found Thompson’s\n\nexpert, Joseph Lawless, qualified to testify as an expert in criminal law\nand procedure. Tr. 419, 426. Lawless has practiced criminal law for 30\nyears; from 1976 to 1979, he was an assistant district attorney, and\nthereafter he entered private practice. Id., at 412. He is the author of\nProsecutorial Misconduct: Law, Procedure, Forms (4th ed. 2008), first\npublished in 1985. Tr. 414. The text is used in a class on ethics and\ntactics for the criminal lawyer at Harvard Law School and in the\nfederal defender training program of the Administrative Office of the\nUnited States Courts.

But\ncf. ante, at 4–5 (“[I]t was undisputed at trial that the\nprosecutors were familiar with the general Brady re\nquirement that the State disclose to the defense evidence\nin its possession that is favorable to the accused.”).\n   The jury could attribute the violations of Thompson’s\nrights directly to prosecutors’ misapprehension of Brady.\nThe prosecution had no obligation to produce the “close-cut\nhair” police reports, Williams maintained, because news\npaper reports had suggested that witness descrip\ntions were not consistent with Thompson’s appearance.\nTherefore, Williams urged, the defense already “had every\nthing.” Tr. 139. Dubelier tendered an alternative ex\nplanation for the nondisclosure. In Dubelier’s view, the\ndescriptions were not “inconsistent with [Thompson’s]\nappearance,” as portrayed in a police photograph showing\nThompson’s hair extending at least three inches above his\nforehead. Id., at 171–172; Record EX73. Williams in\nsisted that he had discharged the prosecution’s duty to\ndisclose the blood evidence by mentioning, in a motion\nhearing, that the prosecution intended to obtain a blood\nsample from Thompson. Tr. 393–394. During the armed\nrobbery trial, Williams told one of the victims that the\nresults of the blood test made on the swatch had been\n“inconclusive.” Id., at 962. And he testified in the §1983\naction that the lab report was not Brady material “because\nI didn’t know what the blood type of Mr. Thompson was.”\nTr. 393. But see supra, at 6–7, n. 5 (District Court in\nstructed the jury that the lab report was Brady material).\n                             3\n  Connick should have comprehended that Orleans Parish\nprosecutors lacked essential guidance on Brady and its\napplication. In fact, Connick has effectively conceded that\nBrady training in his Office was inadequate. Tr. of Oral\nArg. 60. Connick explained to the jury that prosecutors’\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)          19\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\noffices must “make . . . very clear to [new prosecutors]\nwhat their responsibility [i]s” under Brady and must not\n“giv[e] them a lot of leeway.” Tr. 834–835. But the jury\nheard ample evidence that Connick’s Office gave prosecu\ntors no Brady guidance, and had installed no procedures\nto monitor Brady compliance.\n  In 1985, Connick acknowledged, many of his prosecutors\n“were coming fresh out of law school,” and the Office’s\n“[h]uge turnover” allowed attorneys with little experience\nto advance quickly to supervisory positions. See Tr. 853–\n854, 832. By 1985, Dubelier and Williams were two of the\nhighest ranking attorneys in the Office, id., at 342, 356–\n357, yet neither man had even five years of experience as\na prosecutor, see supra, at 5, n. 3; Record EX746; Tr. 55,\n571–576.\n  Dubelier and Williams learned the prosecutorial craft in\nConnick’s Office, and, as earlier observed, see supra, at\n17–18, their testimony manifested a woefully deficient\nunderstanding of Brady. Dubelier and Williams told the\njury that they did not recall any Brady training in the\nOffice. Tr. 170–171, 364.\n  Connick testified that he relied on supervisors, includ\ning Dubelier and Williams, to ensure prosecutors were\nfamiliar with their Brady obligations. Tr. 805–806. Yet\nConnick did not inquire whether the supervisors them\nselves understood the importance of teaching newer prose\ncutors about Brady. Riehlmann could not “recall that [he]\nwas ever trained or instructed by anybody about [his]\nBrady obligations,” on the job or otherwise. Tr. 728–729.\nWhittaker agreed it was possible for “inexperienced law\nyers, just a few weeks out of law school with no training,”\nto bear responsibility for “decisions on . . . whether mate\nrial was Brady material and had to be produced.” Id., at\n319.\n  Thompson’s expert characterized Connick’s supervision\nregarding Brady as “the blind leading the blind.” Tr. 458.\n20                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nFor example, in 1985 trial attorneys “sometimes . . . went\nto Mr. Connick” with Brady questions, “and he would tell\nthem” how to proceed. Tr. 892. But Connick acknowl\nedged that he had “stopped reading law books . . . and\nlooking at opinions” when he was first elected District\nAttorney in 1974. Id., at 175–176.\n   As part of their training, prosecutors purportedly at\ntended a pretrial conference with the Office’s chief of trials\nbefore taking a case to trial. Connick intended the prac\ntice to provide both training and accountability. But it\nachieved neither aim in Thompson’s prosecutions, for\nDubelier and Williams, as senior prosecutors in the Office,\nwere free to take cases to trial without pretrying them,\nand that is just how they proceeded in Thompson’s prose\ncutions. Id., at 901–902; Record 685. But cf. ante, at 13\n(“[T]rial chiefs oversaw the preparation of the cases.”).\n   Prosecutors confirmed that training in the District\nAttorney’s Office, overall, was deficient. Soon after Con\nnick retired, a survey of assistant district attorneys in the\nOffice revealed that more than half felt that they had not\nreceived the training they needed to do their jobs. Tr. 178.\n   Thompson, it bears emphasis, is not complaining about\nthe absence of formal training sessions. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n55. But cf. ante, at 15–16. His complaint does not demand\nthat Brady compliance be enforced in any particular way.\nHe asks only that Brady obligations be communicated\naccurately and genuinely enforced.13 Because that did not\n——————\n   13 To ward off Brady violations of the kind Connick conceded, for ex\n\nample, Connick could have communicated to Orleans Parish prosecu\ntors, in no uncertain terms, that, “[i]f you have physical evidence that,\nif tested, can establish the innocence of the person who is charged, you\nhave to turn it over.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 34; id., at 36 (“[I]f you have\nevidence that can conclusively establish to a scientific certainty the\ninnocence of the person being charged, you have to turn it over . . . .”).\nOr Connick could have told prosecutors what he told the jury when he\nwas asked whether a prosecutor must disclose a crime lab report to the\ndefense, even if the prosecutor does not know the defendant’s blood\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

Had Brady’s\nimportance been brought home to prosecutors, surely at\nleast one of the four officers who knew of the swatch and\nlab report would have revealed their existence to defense\ncounsel and the court.14\n                              4\n  Louisiana did not require continuing legal education at\nthe time of Thompson’s trials. Tr. 361. But cf. ante, at\n12–13. Primary responsibility for keeping prosecutors au\ncourant with developments in the law, therefore, resided\nin the District Attorney’s Office. Over the course of Con\nnick’s tenure as District Attorney, the jury learned, the\nOffice’s chief of appeals circulated memoranda when ap\npellate courts issued important opinions. Tr. 751–754,\n798.\n  The 1987 Office policy manual was a compilation of\nmemoranda on criminal law and practice circulated to\nprosecutors from 1974, when Connick became District\nAttorney, through 1987. Id., at 798. The manual con\ntained four sentences, nothing more, on Brady.15 This\n——————\ntype: “Under the law it qualifies as Brady material. Under Louisiana\nlaw we must turn that over. Under Brady we must turn that over. I\n[failed to disclose a crime lab report] one time as a prosecutor and I got\nindicted by the U. S. Attorney over here for doing it.” Tr. 872. But cf.\nante, at 7 (SCALIA, J., concurring) (questioning how Connick could have\nbeen on notice of the need to train prosecutors about the Brady viola\ntions conceded in this case).\n   14 The Court can scarcely disagree with respect to Dubelier, Williams,\n\nand Whittaker, for it acknowledges the “flagran[cy]” of Deegan’s con\nduct, see ante, at 7, n. 5, and does not dispute that, pretrial, other\nprosecutors knew of the existence of the swatch and lab report.\n   15 Section 5.25 of the manual, titled “Brady Material,” states in full:\n\n“In most cases, in response to the request of defense attorneys, the\nJudge orders the State to produce so called Brady material—that is,\ninformation in the possession of the State which is exculpatory regard\ning the defendant. The duty to produce Brady material is ongoing and\n22                     CONNICK v.

But cf.\nante, at 13 (“Senior attorneys also circulated court deci\nsions and instructional memoranda to keep the prose\ncutors abreast of relevant legal developments.”). For\nexample, the manual did not acknowledge what Giglio v.\nUnited States, 405 U. S. 150 (1972), made plain: Im\npeachment evidence is Brady material prosecutors are\nobligated to disclose.16\n——————\ncontinues throughout the entirety of the trial. Failure to produce\nBrady material has resulted in mistrials and reversals, as well as\nextended court battles over jeopardy issues. In all cases, a review of\nBrady issues, including apparently self-serving statements made by the\ndefendant, must be included in a pre-trial conference and each Assis\ntant must be familiar with the law regarding exculpatory information\npossessed by the State.” Record EX427.\n   16 During the relevant time period, there were many significant de\n\nvelopments in this Court’s Brady jurisprudence. Among the Brady\nrelated decisions this Court handed down were United States v. Bagley,\n473 U. S. 667, 676 (1985) (“This Court has rejected any . . . distinction\nbetween impeachment evidence and exculpatory evidence [in the Brady\ncontext].”); Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U. S. 545, 559–560 (1977)\n(“Brady is not implicated . . . where the only claim is that the State\nshould have revealed that it would present the eyewitness testimony of\na particular agent against the defendant at trial.”); and United States v.\nAgurs, 427 U. S. 97, 103, 104, 106–107 (1976) (Brady claim may arise\nwhen “the undisclosed evidence demonstrates that the prosecution’s\ncase includes perjured testimony and that the prosecution knew, or\nshould have known, of the perjury,” when defense counsel makes “a\npretrial request for specific evidence” and the government fails to\naccede to that request, and when defense counsel makes no request and\nthe government fails to disclose “obviously exculpatory” evidence).\nThese decisions were not referenced in the manual that compiled\ncirculated memoranda.\n   In the same period, the Louisiana Supreme Court issued dozens of\nopinions discussing Brady, including State v. Sylvester, 388 So. 2d 1155,\n1161 (1980) (impeachment evidence must be disclosed in response to a\nspecific request if it would create a “reasonable doubt that did not\notherwise exist”); State v. Brooks, 386 So. 2d 1348, 1351 (1980) (Brady\nextends to any material information favorable to the accused); and\nState v.

First, Connick did not ensure that\nprosecutors in his Office knew their Brady obligations; he\nneither confirmed their familiarity with Brady when he\nhired them, nor saw to it that training took place on his\nwatch. Second, the need for Brady training and monitor\ning was obvious to Connick. Indeed he so testified. Third,\nConnick’s cavalier approach to his staff’s knowledge and\nobservation of Brady requirements contributed to a cul\nture of inattention to Brady in Orleans Parish.\n   As earlier noted, see supra, at 11, Connick resisted an\neffort to hold prosecutors accountable for Brady compli\nance because he felt the effort would “make [his] job more\ndifficult.” Tr. 978. He never disciplined or fired a single\nprosecutor for violating Brady. Tr. 182–183. The jury was\ntold of this Court’s decision in Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S.\n419 (1995), a capital case prosecuted by Connick’s Office\nthat garnered attention because it featured “so many\ninstances of the state’s failure to disclose exculpatory\nevidence.” Id., at 455 (Stevens, J., concurring). When\nquestioned about Kyles, Connick told the jury he was\nsatisfied with his Office’s practices and saw no need,\noccasioned by Kyles, to make any changes. Tr. 184–185.\nIn both quantity and quality, then, the evidence canvassed\nhere was more than sufficient to warrant a jury determi\nnation that Connick and the prosecutors who served under\nhim were not merely negligent regarding Brady. Rather,\nthey were deliberately indifferent to what the law\nrequires.\n                           B\n  In Canton, this Court spoke of circumstances in which\nthe need for training may be “so obvious,” and the lack of\n\n—————— \n\nprosecution fails, even inadvertently, to disclose bargain with a wit\nness).\n\n24                    CONNICK v.

This case, I am convinced, belongs in the category\nCanton marked out.\n   Canton offered an often-cited illustration. “[C]ity poli\ncymakers know to a moral certainty that their police\nofficers will be required to arrest fleeing felons.” Ibid.,\nn. 10. Those policymakers, Canton observed, equip police\nofficers with firearms to facilitate such arrests. Ibid. The\nneed to instruct armed officers about “constitutional limi\ntations on the use of deadly force,” Canton said, is “ ‘so\nobvious,’ that failure to [train the officers] could properly\nbe characterized as ‘deliberate indifference’ to constitu\ntional rights.” Ibid.\n   The District Court, tracking Canton’s language, in\nstructed the jury that Thompson could prevail on his\n“deliberate indifference” claim only if the evidence per\nsuaded the jury on three points. First, Connick “was\ncertain that prosecutors would confront the situation\nwhere they would have to decide which evidence was\nrequired by the Constitution to be provided to the ac\ncused.” Tr. 1099. Second, “the situation involved a diffi\ncult choice[,] or one that prosecutors had a history of\nmishandling, such that additional training, supervision or\nmonitoring was clearly needed.” Ibid. Third, “the wrong\nchoice by a prosecutor in that situation would frequently\ncause a deprivation of an accused’s constitutional rights.”\nIbid.; Record 1619–1620; see Canton, 489 U.

The District Court’s charge, how\never, cautiously cabined the jury’s assessment of Connick’s deliberate\nindifference. See, e.g., Tr. 1100 (“Mr. Thompson must prove that more\nlikely than not the Brady material would have been produced if the\nprosecutors involved in his underlying criminal cases had been properly\ntrained, supervised or monitored regarding the production of Brady\nevidence.”). See also id., at 1096–1097, 1099–1100.\n   The deliberate indifference jury instruction in this case was based on\nthe Second Circuit’s opinion in Walker v. New York, 974 F. 2d 293, 297–\n298 (1992), applying Canton to a §1983 complaint alleging that a\ndistrict attorney failed to train prosecutors about Brady. JUSTICE\nSCALIA’s fears should be calmed by post-Walker experience in the\nSecond Circuit. There has been no “litigation flood or even rainfall,”\nSkinner v. Switzer, 562 U. S. ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12), in that Circuit\nin Walker’s wake. See Brief for National Association of Criminal\nDefense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 39 (“Tellingly, in the Second Cir\ncuit, in the nearly 20 years since the court decided Walker, there have\nbeen no successful lawsuits for non-Brady constitutional violations\ncommitted by prosecutors at trial (and no reported ‘single violation’\nBrady case).” (citation omitted)); Brief for Center on the Administration\nof Criminal Law, New York University School of Law, et al. as Amici\nCuriae 35–36 (Walker has prompted “no flood of §1983 liability”).\n   18 The instruction Connick proposed resembled the charge given by\n\nthe District Court. See supra, at 24. Connick’s proposed instruction\nread: “Before a district attorney’s failure to train or supervise consti\ntutes deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of citizens: (1)\nthe plaintiff must show that Harry Connick knew ‘to a moral certainty’\nthat his employees will confront a given situation; (2) the plaintiff must\nshow that the situation either presents the employee with a difficult\nchoice . . . such that training or supervision will make the choice less\ndifficult or that there is a history of employees mishandling the situa\ntion; and (3) the plaintiff must show that the wrong choice by the\nassistant district attorney will frequently cause the deprivation of a\ncitizen’s constitutional rights.” Record 992 (citing Canton, 489 U.

S., at 390, n. 10.\n   The jury, furthermore, could reasonably find that Brady\nrights may involve choices so difficult that Connick obvi\nously knew or should have known prosecutors needed\nmore than perfunctory training to make the correct\nchoices. See Canton, 489 U. S., at 390, and n. 10.19 As\ndemonstrated earlier, see supra, at 16–18, even at trial\nprosecutors failed to give an accurate account of their\nBrady obligations. And, again as emphasized earlier, see\nsupra, at 18–20, the evidence permitted the jury to con\nclude that Connick should have known Brady training in\nhis office bordered on “zero.” See Tr. of Oral Arg. 41.\nMoreover, Connick understood that newer prosecutors\nneeded “very clear” guidance and should not be left to\ngrapple with Brady on their own. Tr. 834–835. It was\nthus “obvious” to him, the jury could find, that constitu\ntional rights would be in jeopardy if prosecutors received\nslim to no Brady training.\n   Based on the evidence presented, the jury could con\nclude that Brady errors by untrained prosecutors would\nfrequently cause deprivations of defendants’ constitutional\nrights.

E.g., Record 1662.\n  19 Courts have noted the often trying nature of a prosecutor’s Brady\n\nobligation. See, e.g., State v. Whitlock, 454 So. 2d 871, 874 (La. App.\n1984) (recognizing, in a case involving Brady issues in Connick’s Office,\nthat “it is usually most difficult to determine whether or not inconsis\ntencies or omitted information in witnesses’ statements are material to\nthe defendant’s guilt” (quoting State v.

Because prosecutors faced considerable pressure\nto get convictions, id., at 317, 341, and were instructed to\n“turn over what was required by state and federal law, but\nno more,” Brief for Petitioners 6–7, the risk was all too\nreal that they would err by withholding rather than re\nvealing information favorable to the defense.\n   In sum, despite JUSTICE SCALIA’s protestations to the\ncontrary, ante, at 1, 5, the Brady violations in Thompson’s\nprosecutions were not singular and they were not aberra\ntional. They were just what one would expect given the\nattitude toward Brady pervasive in the District Attorney’s\nOffice. Thompson demonstrated that no fewer than five\nprosecutors—the four trial prosecutors and Riehlmann—\ndisregarded his Brady rights. He established that they\nkept from him, year upon year, evidence vital to his de\nfense. Their conduct, he showed with equal force, was a\nforeseeable consequence of lax training in, and absence of\nmonitoring of, a legal requirement fundamental to a fair\ntrial.20\n——————\n   20 The jury could draw a direct, causal connection between Connick’s\n\ndeliberate indifference, prosecutors’ misapprehension of Brady, and the\nBrady violations in Thompson’s case. See, e.g., supra, at 17 (prosecu\ntors’ misunderstandings of Brady “were in large part responsible for the\ngross disregard of Brady rights Thompson experienced”); supra, at 18\n(“The jury could attribute the violations of Thompson’s rights directly to\nprosecutors’ misapprehension of Brady.”); supra, at 17–18 (Williams did\nnot believe Brady required disclosure of impeachment evidence and did\nnot believe he had any obligation to turn over the impeaching “close-cut\nhair” police reports); supra, at 18 (At the time of the armed robbery\ntrial, Williams reported that the results of the blood test on the swatch\nwere “inconclusive”); ibid. (“[Williams] testified . . . that the lab report\nwas not Brady material . . . .”); supra, at 19–20 (Dubelier and Williams,\nthe lead prosecutors in Thompson’s trials, “learned the prosecutorial\ncraft in Connick’s Office,” “did not recall any Brady training,” demon\nstrated “a woefully deficient understanding of Brady,” and received no\nsupervision during Thompson’s trials); supra, at 21 (“Had Brady’s\n28                     CONNICK v.

Canton, 489 U. S., at\n390, n. 10. But as this case so vividly shows, a municipal\nity that empowers prosecutors to press for a death sen\ntence without ensuring that those prosecutors know and\nhonor Brady rights may be no less “deliberately indiffer\n\n——————\nimportance been brought home to prosecutors, surely at least one of the\nfour officers who knew of the swatch and lab report would have re\nvealed their existence to defense counsel and the court.”); supra, at 23\n(Connick did not want to hold prosecutors accountable for Brady\ncompliance because he felt that doing so would make his job more\ndifficult); supra, at 23 (Connick never disciplined a single prosecutor for\nviolating Brady); supra, at 27 (“Because prosecutors faced considerable\npressure to get convictions, and were instructed to turn over what was\nrequired by state and federal law, but no more, the risk was all too real\nthat they would err by withholding rather than revealing information\nfavorable to the defense.” (citations and internal quotation marks\nomitted)). But cf. ante, at 7, n. 5 (“The dissent believes that evidence\nthat the prosecutors allegedly ‘misapprehen[ded]’ Brady proves causa\ntion.”).\n   I note, furthermore, that the jury received clear instructions on the\ncausation element, and neither Connick nor the majority disputes the\naccuracy or adequacy of the instruction that, to prevail, Thompson\nmust prove “that more likely than not the Brady material would have\nbeen produced if the prosecutors involved in his underlying criminal\ncases had been properly trained, supervised or monitored regarding the\nproduction of Brady evidence.” Tr. 1100.\n   The jury was properly instructed that “[f]or liability to attach because\nof a failure to train, the fault must be in the training program itself, not\nin any particular prosecutor.” Id., at 1098. Under that instruction, in\nfinding Connick liable, the jury necessarily rejected the argument—\nechoed by JUSTICE SCALIA—that Deegan “was the only bad guy.” Id., at\n1074. See also id., at 1057; ante, at 5. If indeed Thompson had shown\nsimply and only that Deegan deliberately withheld evidence, I would\nagree that there would be no basis for liability. But, as reams of\nevidence showed, disregard of Brady occurred, over and over again in\nOrleans Parish, before, during, and after Thompson’s 1985 robbery and\nmurder trials.\n                    Cite as: 563 U.

See Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(slip op., at 1). See also United States v. Bagley, 473 U. S.\n667, 695 (1985) (Marshall, J., dissenting). Vigilance in\nsuperintending prosecutors’ attention to Brady’s require\nment is all the more important for this reason: A Brady\nviolation, by its nature, causes suppression of evidence\nbeyond the defendant’s capacity to ferret out. Because the\nabsence of the withheld evidence may result in the convic\ntion of an innocent defendant, it is unconscionable not to\nimpose reasonable controls impelling prosecutors to bring\nthe information to light.\n   The Court nevertheless holds Canton’s example inappo\nsite. It maintains that professional obligations, ethics\nrules, and training—including on-the-job training—set\nattorneys apart from other municipal employees, including\nrookie police officers. Ante, at 12–15. Connick “had every\nincentive at trial to attempt to establish” that he could\nreasonably rely on the professional education and status of\nhis staff. Cf. ante, at 10, n. 6. But the jury heard and\nrejected his argument to that effect. Tr. 364, 576–577,\n834–835.\n   The Court advances Connick’s argument with greater\nclarity, but with no greater support. On what basis can\none be confident that law schools acquaint students with\nprosecutors’ unique obligation under Brady? Whittaker\ntold the jury he did not recall covering Brady in his crimi\nnal procedure class in law school. Tr. 335.

Research indicates, however, that from 1980 to the\npresent, Brady questions have not accounted for even\n10% of the total points in the criminal law and procedure\nsection of any administration of the Louisiana Bar Exami\nnation.22 A person sitting for the Louisiana Bar Examina\ntion, moreover, need pass only five of the exam’s nine\nsections.23 One can qualify for admission to the profession\nwith no showing of even passing knowledge of criminal\nlaw and procedure.\n   The majority’s suggestion that lawyers do not need\nBrady training because they “are equipped with the tools\nto find, interpret, and apply legal principles,” ante, at 17–\n18, “blinks reality” and is belied by the facts of this case.\nSee Brief for Former Federal Civil Rights Officials and\nProsecutors as Amici Curiae 13. Connick himself recog\nnized that his prosecutors, because of their inexperience,\nwere not so equipped. Indeed, “understanding and com\nplying with Brady obligations are not easy tasks, and the\nappropriate way to resolve Brady issues is not always self\nevident.” Brief for Former Federal Civil Rights Officials\nand Prosecutors as Amici Curiae 6. “Brady compliance,”\ntherefore, “is too much at risk, and too fundamental to the\nfairness of our criminal justice system, to be taken for\ngranted,” and “training remains critical.” Id., at 3, 7.\n   The majority further suggests that a prior pattern of\nsimilar violations is necessary to show deliberate indiffer\nence to defendants’ Brady rights.

Con\nducting this inquiry, the Court has acknowledged, “may not be an easy\ntask for the factfinder.” Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378, 391 (1989).\nBryan County did not retreat from this Court’s conclusion in Canton\nthat “judge and jury, doing their respective jobs, will be adequate to the\ntask.” 489 U. S., at 391. See also Bryan County, 520 U. S., at 410\n(absent a pattern, municipal liability may be predicated on “a particu\nlar glaring omission in a training regimen”). But cf. ante, at 16–18\n(suggesting that under no set of facts could a plaintiff establish deliber\nate indifference for failure to train prosecutors in their Brady obligation\nwithout showing a prior pattern of violations).\n    25 When Congress sought to render a claim for relief contingent on\n\nshowing a pattern or practice, it did so expressly. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C.\n§14141(a) (“It shall be unlawful for any governmental authority . . . to\nengage in a pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers\n. . . that deprives persons of rights . . . protected by the Constitution\n. . . .”); 15 U. S. C. §6104(a) (“Any person adversely affected by any\npattern or practice of telemarketing . . . may . . . bring a civil action\n. . . .”); 49 U. S. C. §306(e) (authorizing the Attorney General to bring a\ncivil action when he “has reason to believe that a person is engaged in a\npattern or practice [of] violating this section”). See also 47 U. S. C.\n§532(e)(2)–(3) (authorizing the Federal Communications Commission to\nestablish additional rules when “the Commission finds that the prior\nadjudicated violations of this section constitute a pattern or practice of\nviolations”).\n    26 In the end, the majority leaves open the possibility that something\n\nother than “a pattern of violations” could also give a district attorney\n“specific reason” to know that additional training is necessary. See\nante, at 14–15. Connick, by his own admission, had such a reason. See\nsupra, at 18–20.\n    27 For example, a prosecutor’s office could be deliberately indifferent if\n\nit had a longstanding open-file policy, abandoned that policy, but failed\nto provide training to show prosecutors how to comply with their Brady\nobligations in the altered circumstances. Or a district attorney could be\ndeliberately indifferent if he had a practice of paring well-trained\nprosecutors with untrained prosecutors, knew that such supervision\n32                     CONNICK v. THOMPSON\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ncase is one such instance. Connick, who himself had been\nindicted for suppression of evidence, created a tinderbox in\nOrleans Parish in which Brady violations were nigh inevi\ntable. And when they did occur, Connick insisted there\nwas no need to change anything, and opposed efforts to\nhold prosecutors accountable on the ground that doing so\nwould make his job more difficult.\n   A District Attorney aware of his office’s high turnover\nrate, who recruits prosecutors fresh out of law school and\npromotes them rapidly through the ranks, bears responsi\nbility for ensuring that on-the-job training takes place. In\nshort, the buck stops with him.28 As the Court recognizes,\n“the duty to produce Brady evidence to the defense” is\n“[a]mong prosecutors’ unique ethical obligations.” Ante, at\n13. The evidence in this case presents overwhelming\nsupport for the conclusion that the Orleans Parish Office\nslighted its responsibility to the profession and to the\nState’s system of justice by providing no on-the-job Brady\ntraining. Connick was not “entitled to rely on prosecutors’\nprofessional training,” ante, at 14, for Connick himself\nshould have been the principal insurer of that training.\n                         *    *     *\n  For the reasons stated, I would affirm the judgment of\nthe U.
