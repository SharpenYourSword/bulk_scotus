Argued November 2, 2010—Decided April 20, 2011\nAfter this Court held that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of\n  1993 was unconstitutional as applied to state and local governments\n  because it exceeded Congress’ power under §5 of the Fourteenth\n  Amendment, see City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, Congress\n  passed the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of\n  2000 (RLUIPA) pursuant to its Spending Clause and Commerce\n  Clause authority. RLUIPA targets two areas of state and local ac\n  tion: land–use regulation, RLUIPA §2, 42 U. S. C. §2000cc, and re\n  strictions on the religious exercise of institutionalized persons,\n  RLUIPA §3, §2000cc–1. It also provides an express private cause of\n  action for “appropriate relief against a government,” §2000cc–2(a),\n  including, inter alia, States, their instrumentalities and officers, and\n  persons acting under color of state law, §2000cc–5(4)(A).\n     Petitioner Sossamon, a Texas prison inmate, sued respondents, the\n  State and prison officials, seeking injunctive and monetary relief un\n  der RLUIPA for prison policies that prevented inmates from attend\n  ing religious services while on cell restriction for disciplinary infrac\n  tions and that barred use of the prison chapel for religious worship.\n  Granting respondents summary judgment, the District Court held\n  that sovereign immunity barred Sossamon’s claims for monetary re\n  lief. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that the statutory phrase\n  “appropriate relief against a government” did not unambiguously no\n  tify Texas that its acceptance of federal funds was conditioned on a\n  waiver of sovereign immunity to claims for monetary relief.\nHeld: States, in accepting federal funding, do not consent to waive their\n sovereign immunity to private suits for money damages under\n RLUIPA. Pp. 4–14.\n    (a) Sovereign immunity principles enforce an important constitu\n2                         SOSSAMON v. TEXAS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tional limitation on the power of the federal courts. See Pennhurst\n    State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 98. This\n    Court has consistently made clear that “federal jurisdiction over suits\n    against unconsenting States ‘was not contemplated by the Constitu\n    tion when establishing the judicial power of the United States.’ ”\n    Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 54. A State, however,\n    may choose to waive its immunity. Clark v. Barnard, 108 U. S. 436,\n    447–448. The “ ‘test for determining whether [it has done so] is a\n    stringent one.’ ” College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsec­\n    ondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 675. The State’s consent to\n    suit must be “unequivocally expressed” in the relevant statute’s text.\n    Pennhurst, supra, at 99. A waiver “will be strictly construed, in\n    terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.” Lane v. Peña, 518 U. S.\n    187, 192. Pp. 4–6.\n       (b) RLUIPA’s authorization of “appropriate relief against a gov\n    ernment,” is not an unequivocal expression of state consent. Pp. 6–\n    10.\n          (1) “Appropriate relief” is open-ended and ambiguous about the\n    relief it includes. “Appropriate” is inherently context-dependent.\n    And the context here—where the defendant is a sovereign—suggests,\n    if anything, that monetary damages are not “suitable” or “proper.”\n    See Federal Maritime Comm’n v. South Carolina Ports Authority, 535\n    U. S. 743, 765. Further, where a statute is susceptible of multiple\n    plausible interpretations, including one preserving immunity, this\n    Court will not consider a State to have waived its sovereign immu\n    nity. Sossamon’s and Texas’ conflicting plausible arguments about\n    whether immunity is preserved here demonstrate that “appropriate\n    relief” in RLUIPA is not so free from ambiguity that the Court may\n    conclude that the States, by receiving federal funds, have unequivo\n    cally expressed intent to waive their immunity. Pp. 6–9.\n          (2) The Court’s use of the phrase “appropriate relief” in Franklin\n    v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60, and Barnes v. Gor­\n    man, 536 U. S. 181, does not compel a contrary conclusion. In those\n    cases, where there was no express congressional intent to limit reme\n    dies available against municipal entities under an implied right of\n    action, the Court presumed that compensatory damages were avail\n    able. Franklin, supra, at 73. But that presumption is irrelevant to\n    construing the scope of an express waiver of sovereign immunity,\n    where the question is not whether Congress has given clear direction\n    that it intends to exclude a damages remedy, but whether it has\n    given clear direction that it intends to include a damages remedy.\n    Pp. 9–10.\n       (c) Sossamon mistakenly contends that Congress’ enactment of\n    RLUIPA §3 pursuant to the Spending Clause put the States on notice\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  that they would be liable for damages because Spending Clause legis\n  lation operates as a contract and damages are always available for a\n  breach of contract. While acknowledging the contract-law analogy,\n  this Court has been clear “not [to] imply . . . that suits under Spend\n  ing Clause legislation are suits in contract, or that contract-law prin\n  ciples apply to all issues that they raise,” Barnes, supra, at 188, n. 2,\n  or to rely on that analogy to expand liability beyond what would exist\n  under nonspending statutes, much less to extend monetary liability\n  against the States. Applying ordinary contract principles here would\n  also make little sense because contracts with a sovereign are unique:\n  They do not traditionally confer a right of action for damages to en\n  force compliance. More fundamentally, Sossamon’s implied-contract\n  remedy cannot be squared with the rule that a sovereign immunity\n  waiver must be expressly and unequivocally stated in the relevant\n  statute’s text. Pp. 10–12.\n     (d) Sossamon also errs in arguing that Texas was put on notice that\n  it could be sued for damages under RLUIPA by §1003 of the Rehabili\n  tation Act Amendments of 1986, which expressly waives state sover\n  eign immunity for violations of “section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n  of 1973, title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the Age Dis\n  crimination Act of 1975, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or the\n  provisions of any other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by\n  recipients of Federal financial assistance,” 42 U. S. C. §2000d–7.\n  Even if such a residual clause could constitute an unequivocal textual\n  waiver, RLUIPA §3—which prohibits “substantial burden[s]” on reli\n  gious exercise—is not unequivocally a “statute prohibiting discrimi\n  nation” within §1003’s meaning. All the statutory provisions enu\n  merated in §1003 explicitly prohibit discrimination; a State might\n  reasonably conclude that the residual clause, strictly construed, cov\n  ers only provisions using the term “discrimination.” Pp. 12–14.\n560 F. 3d 316, affirmed.\n\n  THOMAS, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

S. C. §2000cc et seq. We\nhold that they do not. Sovereign immunity therefore bars\nthis suit for damages against the State of Texas.\n                              I\n\n                             A\n\n  RLUIPA is Congress’ second attempt to accord height\nened statutory protection to religious exercise in the wake\nof this Court’s decision in Employment Division, Depart­\nment of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U. S.\n872 (1990). Congress first enacted the Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 107 Stat. 1488, 42\nU. S. C. §2000bb et seq., with which it intended to “restore\nthe compelling interest test as set forth in Sherbert v.\nVerner, 374 U. S. 398 (1963) and Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406\nU. S. 205 (1972) . . . in all cases where free exercise of\nreligion is substantially burdened.” §2000bb(b)(1). See\n2                       SOSSAMON v. TEXAS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ngenerally Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficente União\ndo Vegetal, 546 U. S. 418, 424 (2006). We held RFRA\nunconstitutional as applied to state and local governments\nbecause it exceeded Congress’ power under §5 of the Four\nteenth Amendment. See City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S.\n507 (1997).\n   Congress responded by enacting RLUIPA pursuant to\nits Spending Clause and Commerce Clause authority.\nRLUIPA borrows important elements from RFRA—which\ncontinues to apply to the Federal Government—but\nRLUIPA is less sweeping in scope. See Cutter v. Wilkin­\nson, 544 U. S. 709, 715 (2005). It targets two areas of\nstate and local action: land-use regulation, 42 U. S. C.\n§2000cc (RLUIPA §2), and restrictions on the religious\nexercise of institutionalized persons, §2000cc–1 (RLUIPA\n§3).\n   Section 3 of RLUIPA provides that “[n]o government\nshall impose a substantial burden on the religious exer\ncise” of an institutionalized person unless, as in RFRA, the\ngovernment demonstrates that the burden “is in further\nance of a compelling governmental interest” and “is the\nleast restrictive means of furthering” that interest.\n§2000cc–1(a); cf. §§2000bb–1(a), (b). As relevant here, §3\napplies “in any case” in which “the substantial burden is\nimposed in a program or activity that receives Federal\nfinancial assistance.”1 §2000cc–1(b)(1).\n   RLUIPA also includes an express private cause of action\nthat is taken from RFRA: “A person may assert a violation\nof [RLUIPA] as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding\nand obtain appropriate relief against a government.”\n§2000cc–2(a); cf. §2000bb–1(c). For purposes of this provi\n——————\n  1 No party contends that the Commerce Clause permitted Congress to\n\naddress the alleged burden on religious exercise at issue in this case.\nSee 42 U. S. C. §2000cc–1(b)(2). Nor is Congress’ authority to enact\nRLUIPA under the Spending Clause challenged here. We therefore do\nnot address those issues.\n                      Cite as: 563 U.

In 2006, Sos\nsamon sued the State of Texas and various prison officials\nin their official capacities under RLUIPA’s private cause of\naction, seeking injunctive and monetary relief. Sossamon\nalleged that two prison policies violated RLUIPA: (1) a\npolicy preventing inmates from attending religious ser\nvices while on cell restriction for disciplinary infractions;\nand (2) a policy barring use of the prison chapel for reli\ngious worship. The District Court granted summary\njudgment in favor of respondents and held, as relevant\nhere, that sovereign immunity barred Sossamon’s claims\nfor monetary relief.2 See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2540207\"><a href=\"/opinion/2540207/sossamon-v-lone-star-state-of-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">713</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Acknowledging that Congress\nenacted RLUIPA pursuant to the Spending Clause, the\ncourt determined that Texas had not waived its sovereign\nimmunity by accepting federal funds. The Court of Ap\npeals strictly construed the text of RLUIPA’s cause of\naction in favor of the State and concluded that the statu\n——————\n  2 The District Court also denied injunctive relief. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2540207\"><a href=\"/opinion/2540207/sossamon-v-lone-star-state-of-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">713</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The Court of Appeals subsequently held that\nSossamon’s claim for injunctive relief with respect to the cell-restriction\npolicy was moot because the State had abandoned that policy after\nSossamon filed a prison grievance. 560 F. 3d 316, 326 (CA5 2009). The\nCourt of Appeals reversed the District Court with respect to Sossamon’s\nchapel-use policy claim, id., at 331–335, although the Robertson Unit\nlater amended that policy also and now permits inmates to attend\nscheduled worship services in the chapel subject to certain safety\nprecautions.\n4                       SOSSAMON v. TEXAS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntory phrase “appropriate relief against a government” did\nnot “unambiguously notif[y]” Texas that its acceptance of\nfunds was conditioned on a waiver of immunity from\nclaims for money damages. Id., at 330–331. We granted\ncertiorari to resolve a division of authority among the\ncourts of appeals on this question.3 560 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                             II\n  “Dual sovereignty is a defining feature of our Nation’s\nconstitutional blueprint.” Federal Maritime Comm’n v.\nSouth Carolina Ports Authority, 535 U. S. 743, 751 (2002).\nUpon ratification of the Constitution, the States entered\nthe Union “with their sovereignty intact.” Ibid. (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n  Immunity from private suits has long been considered\n“central to sovereign dignity.” Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S.\n706, 715 (1999). As was widely understood at the time the\nConstitution was drafted:\n        “It is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be\n     amenable to the suit of an individual without its con­\n     sent. This is the general sense, and the general prac\n     tice of mankind; and the exemption, as one of the\n     attributes of sovereignty, is now enjoyed by the\n     government of every State in the Union.” The Feder\n     alist No. 81, p. 511 (Wright ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton).\nIndeed, when this Court threatened state immunity from\nprivate suits early in our Nation’s history, the people\nresponded swiftly to reiterate that fundamental principle.\nSee Hans v.

Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793), and the Eleventh\nAmendment).\n   Sovereign immunity principles enforce an important\nconstitutional limitation on the power of the federal\ncourts. See Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Hal­\nderman, 465 U. S. 89, 98 (1984). For over a century now,\nthis Court has consistently made clear that “federal juris\ndiction over suits against unconsenting States ‘was not\ncontemplated by the Constitution when establishing the\njudicial power of the United States.’ ” Seminole Tribe of\nFla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 54 (1996) (quoting Hans,\nsupra, at 15); see Seminole Tribe, supra, at 54–55, n. 7\n(collecting cases). A State, however, may choose to waive\nits immunity in federal court at its pleasure. Clark v.\nBarnard, 108 U. S. 436, 447–448 (1883).\n   Accordingly, “our test for determining whether a State\nhas waived its immunity from federal-court jurisdiction is\na stringent one.” College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid\nPostsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 675 (1999)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). A State’s consent to\nsuit must be “unequivocally expressed” in the text of the\nrelevant statute. Pennhurst State School and Hospital,\nsupra, at 99; see Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473\nU. S. 234, 238, n. 1, 239–240 (1985). Only by requiring\nthis “clear declaration” by the State can we be “certain\nthat the State in fact consents to suit.” College Savings\nBank, 527 U. S., at 680. Waiver may not be implied. Id.,\nat 682.\n   For these reasons, a waiver of sovereign immunity “will\nbe strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the\nsovereign.” Lane v. Peña, 518 U. S. 187, 192 (1996).4 So,\n——————\n  4 Although Lane concerned the Federal Government, the strict con\n\nstruction principle, which flows logically from the requirement that\nconsent be “unequivocally expressed,” applies to the sovereign immu\nnity of the States as well. Cf. United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503\nU. S. 30, 37 (1992) (equating the “unequivocal expression” principle\n6                       SOSSAMON v.

Similarly, a waiver\nof sovereign immunity to other types of relief does not\nwaive immunity to damages: “[T]he waiver of sovereign\nimmunity must extend unambiguously to such monetary\nclaims.” Lane, supra, at 192; cf. United States v. Nordic\nVillage, 503 U. S. 30, 34 (1992) (construing an ambiguous\nwaiver of sovereign immunity to permit equitable but not\nmonetary claims); Hoffman v. Connecticut Dept. of Income\nMaintenance, 492 U. S. 96, 101–102 (1989) (construing a\nstatute to authorize injunctive relief but not “monetary\nrecovery from the States” because intent to abrogate im\nmunity to monetary recovery was not “ ‘unmistakably clear\nin the language of the statute’ ” (quoting Atascadero, su­\npra, at 242)).\n                               III \n\n                                A\n\n  RLUIPA’s authorization of “appropriate relief against a\ngovernment,” §2000cc–2(a), is not the unequivocal expres\nsion of state consent that our precedents require. “Appro\npriate relief ” does not so clearly and unambiguously waive\nsovereign immunity to private suits for damages that we\ncan “be certain that the State in fact consents” to such a\nsuit.

The context\nhere—where the defendant is a sovereign—suggests, if\nanything, that monetary damages are not “suitable” or\n“proper.” See Federal Maritime Comm’n, 535 U. S., at 765\n(“[S]tate sovereign immunity serves the important func\ntion of shielding state treasuries . . .”).\n   Indeed, both the Court and dissent appeared to agree in\nWest v. Gibson, 527 U. S. 212 (1999), that “appropriate”\nrelief, by itself, does not unambiguously include damages\nagainst a sovereign. The question was whether the Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission, which has author\nity to enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act against the\nFederal Government “through appropriate remedies,”\ncould require the Federal Government to pay damages. 42\nU. S. C. §2000e–16(b). The dissent argued that the phrase\n“appropriate remedies” did not authorize damages “in\nexpress and unequivocal terms.” Gibson, 527 U. S., at 226\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.). The Court apparently did not\ndisagree but reasoned that “appropriate remedies” had a\nflexible meaning that had expanded to include money\ndamages after a related statute was amended to explicitly\nallow damages in actions under Title VII. See id., at 217–\n218.\n   Further, where a statute is susceptible of multiple\nplausible interpretations, including one preserving immu\nnity, we will not consider a State to have waived its sover\neign immunity. See Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U. S. 223, 232\n\n——————\n  5 See also Holley, supra, at 1112; Nelson, supra, at 884; Van Wyhe,\nsupra, at 654; Cardinal, supra, at 801; Madison, supra, at 131–132; cf.\nWebman v. Federal Bur. of Prisons, 441 F. 3d 1022, 1023 (CADC 2006)\n(interpreting the “appropriate relief ” provision of RFRA).\n8                    SOSSAMON v. TEXAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(1989) (holding that “a permissible inference” is not the\nnecessary “unequivocal declaration” that States were\nintended to be subject to damages actions); Nordic Village,\nsupra, at 37 (holding that the existence of “plausible”\ninterpretations that would not permit recovery “is enough\nto establish that a reading imposing monetary liability on\nthe Government is not ‘unambiguous’ and therefore should\nnot be adopted”). That is the case here.\n   Sossamon argues that, because RLUIPA expressly\nlimits the United States to “injunctive or declaratory\nrelief ” to enforce the statute, the phrase “appropriate re\nlief ” in the private cause of action necessarily must be\nbroader. 42 U. S. C. §2000cc–2(f). Texas responds that,\nbecause the State has no immunity defense to a suit\nbrought by the Federal Government, Congress needed to\nexclude damages affirmatively in that context but not in\nthe context of private suits. Further, the private cause of\naction provides that a person may assert a violation of the\nstatute “as a claim or defense.” §2000cc–2(a) (emphasis\nadded). Because an injunction or declaratory judgment is\nnot “appropriate relief ” for a successful defense, Texas\nexplains, explicitly limiting the private cause of action to\nthose forms of relief would make no sense.\n   Sossamon also emphasizes that the statute requires\nthat it be “construed in favor of a broad protection of\nreligious exercise.” §2000cc–3(g). Texas responds that\nthis provision is best read as addressing the substantive\nstandards in the statute, not the scope of “appropriate\nrelief.” Texas also highlights Congress’ choice of the word\n“relief,” which it argues primarily connotes equitable\nrelief. See Black’s Law Dictionary 1295 (7th ed. 1999)\n(defining “relief ” as “[t]he redress or benefit, esp. equitable\nin nature . . . , that a party asks of a court”).\n   These plausible arguments demonstrate that the phrase\n“appropriate relief ” in RLUIPA is not so free from ambigu\nity that we may conclude that the States, by receiving\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

S., at 192—we conclude that\nit does not include suits for damages against a State.\n                                2\n   The Court’s use of the phrase “appropriate relief” in\nFranklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60\n(1992), and Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U. S. 181 (2002), does\nnot compel a contrary conclusion. In those cases, the\nCourt addressed what remedies are available against\nmunicipal entities under the implied right of action to\nenforce Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,\n§202 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and\n§504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. With no statutory\ntext to interpret, the Court “presume[d] the availability of\nall appropriate remedies unless Congress ha[d] expressly\nindicated otherwise.” Franklin, 503 U. S., at 66. The\nCourt described the presumption as “[t]he general rule”\nthat “the federal courts have the power to award any\nappropriate relief in a cognizable cause of action brought\npursuant to a federal statute.” Id., at 70–71 (emphasis\nadded); see Barnes, supra, at 185 (quoting Franklin, su­\npra, at 73). Finding no express congressional intent to\nlimit the remedies available under the implied right of\naction, the Court held that compensatory damages were\navailable. Franklin, supra, at 73.\n   The presumption in Franklin and Barnes is irrelevant to\nconstruing the scope of an express waiver of sovereign\nimmunity. See Lane, supra, at 196 (“[R]eliance on Frank­\nlin . . . is misplaced” in determining whether damages are\navailable against the Federal Government). The question\nhere is not whether Congress has given clear direction\nthat it intends to exclude a damages remedy, see Franklin,\nsupra, at 70–71, but whether Congress has given clear\n10                      SOSSAMON v. TEXAS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndirection that it intends to include a damages remedy.\nThe text must “establish unambiguously that the waiver\nextends to monetary claims.” Nordic Village, 503 U. S., at\n34. In Franklin and Barnes, congressional silence had an\nentirely different implication than it does here. Whatever\n“appropriate relief ” might have meant in those cases does\nnot translate to this context.6\n                              B\n    Sossamon contends that, because Congress enacted §3 of\nRLUIPA pursuant to the Spending Clause, the States\nwere necessarily on notice that they would be liable for\ndamages. He argues that Spending Clause legislation\noperates as a contract and damages are always available\nrelief for a breach of contract, whether the contract explic\nitly includes a damages remedy or not. Relying on Barnes\nand Franklin, he asserts that all recipients of federal\nfunding are “ ‘generally on notice that [they are] subject\n. . . to those remedies traditionally available in suits for\nbreach of contract,’ ” including compensatory damages.\nBrief for Petitioner 27 (quoting Barnes, 536 U. S., at 187).\n    We have acknowledged the contract-law analogy, but we\nhave been clear “not [to] imply . . . that suits under Spend\ning Clause legislation are suits in contract, or that\n\n——————\n   6 Nor can it be said that this Court’s use of the phrase “appropriate\n\nrelief ” in Franklin and Barnes somehow put the States on notice that\nthe same phrase in RLUIPA subjected them to suits for monetary\nrelief. Those cases did not involve sovereign defendants, so the Court\nhad no occasion to consider sovereign immunity. Liability against\nnonsovereigns could not put the States on notice that they would be\nliable in the same manner, absent an unequivocal textual waiver.\nMoreover, the same phrase in RFRA had been interpreted not to\ninclude damages relief against the Federal Government or the States\nand so could have signaled to the States that damages are not “appro\npriate relief ” under RLUIPA.

We have not relied on the\nSpending Clause contract analogy to expand liability\nbeyond what would exist under non-spending statutes,\nmuch less to extend monetary liability against the States,\nas Sossamon would have us do. In fact, in Barnes and\nFranklin, the Court discussed the Spending Clause con\ntext only as a potential limitation on liability. See Barnes,\nsupra, at 187–188; Franklin, supra, at 74–75.\n  In any event, applying ordinary contract principles here\nwould make little sense because contracts with a sovereign\nare unique. They do not traditionally confer a right of\naction for damages to enforce compliance: “ ‘The contracts\nbetween a Nation and an individual are only binding on\nthe conscience of the sovereign and have no pretensions to\ncompulsive force. They confer no right of action independ\nent of the sovereign will.’ ” Lynch v. United States, 292\nU. S. 571, 580–581 (1934) (quoting The Federalist, No. 81,\nat 511 (A. Hamilton)).7\n  More fundamentally, Sossamon’s implied-contract\nremedies proposal cannot be squared with our longstand\ning rule that a waiver of sovereign immunity must be\nexpressly and unequivocally stated in the text of the rele\nvant statute. It would be bizarre to create an “unequivocal\nstatement” rule and then find that every Spending Clause\nenactment, no matter what its text, satisfies that rule\nbecause it includes unexpressed, implied remedies against\nthe States. The requirement of a clear statement in the\ntext of the statute ensures that Congress has specifically\nconsidered state sovereign immunity and has intentionally\nlegislated on the matter. Cf. Spector v. Norwegian Cruise\nLine Ltd., 545 U. S. 119, 139 (2005) (plurality opinion)\n——————\n  7 Of course, the Federal Government has, by statute, waived its sov\n\nereign immunity to damages for breach of contract in certain contexts.\nSee, e.g., 28 U. S. C. §1491(a)(1).\n12                       SOSSAMON v. TEXAS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n(“[C]lear statement rules ensure Congress does not, by\nbroad or general language, legislate on a sensitive topic\ninadvertently or without due deliberation”). Without such\na clear statement from Congress and notice to the States,\nfederal courts may not step in and abrogate state sover\neign immunity.8\n                              IV\n   Sossamon also argues that §1003 of the Rehabilitation\nAct Amendments of 1986, 42 U. S. C. §2000d–7, independ\nently put the State on notice that it could be sued for\ndamages under RLUIPA. That provision expressly waives\nstate sovereign immunity for violations of “section 504 of\nthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973, title IX of the Education\nAmendments of 1972, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975,\ntitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or the provisions of\nany other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by\nrecipients of Federal financial assistance.” §2000d–7(a)(1)\n(emphasis added). Section 1003 makes “remedies (includ\ning remedies both at law and in equity) . . . available for\nsuch a violation to the same extent as such remedies are\navailable for such a violation in the suit against any public\nor private entity other than a State.” §2000d–7(a)(2).\nSossamon contends that §3 of RLUIPA falls within the\nresidual clause of §1003 and therefore §1003 waives Texas’\nsovereign immunity to RLUIPA suits for damages.\n——————\n  8 The  dissent finds our decision “difficult to understand,” post, at 6\n(opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.), but it follows naturally from this Court’s\nprecedents regarding waiver of sovereign immunity, which the dissent\ngives astonishingly short shrift. The dissent instead concerns itself\nprimarily with “general remedies principles.” Post, at 1. The essence of\nsovereign immunity, however, is that remedies against the government\ndiffer from “general remedies principles” applicable to private litigants.\nSee, e.g., Lane v. Peña, 518 U. S. 187, 196 (1996) (calling it a “crucial\npoint that, when it comes to an award of money damages, sovereign\nimmunity places the . . . Government on an entirely different footing\nthan private parties”).\n                    Cite as: 563 U.

This distinction is espe\ncially conspicuous in light of §2 of RLUIPA, in which\nCongress expressly prohibited “land use regulation[s] that\ndiscriminat[e] . . . on the basis of religion.” §2000cc(b)(2).\nA waiver of sovereign immunity must be “strictly con\nstrued, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.”\nLane, 518 U. S., at 192. We cannot say that the residual\nclause clearly extends to §3; a State might reasonably\nconclude that the clause covers only provisions using the\nterm “discrimination.”\n   The statutory provisions specifically listed in §1003\nconfirm that §3 does not unequivocally come within the\nscope of the residual clause. “[G]eneral words,” such as\nthe residual clause here, “are construed to embrace only\nobjects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by\nthe preceding specific words.” Washington State Dept. of\nSocial and Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of Keffe­\nler, 537 U. S. 371, 384 (2003) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also Jarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S.\n303, 307 (1961) (noting that this maxim “is often wisely\napplied where a word is capable of many meanings in\norder to avoid the giving of unintended breadth to the Acts\nof Congress”). Unlike §3, each of the statutes specifically\nenumerated in §1003 explicitly prohibits “discrimination.”\nSee 29 U. S. C. §794(a); 20 U. S. C. §1681(a); 42 U. S. C.\n§§6101, 6102; 42 U. S.

S. C. §2000cc et seq. I dis\nagree. No one disputes that, in accepting federal funds,\nthe States consent to suit for violations of RLUIPA’s sub\nstantive provisions; the only question is what relief is\navailable to plaintiffs asserting injury from such viola\ntions. That monetary damages are “appropriate relief” is,\nin my view, self-evident. Under general remedies princi\nples, the usual remedy for a violation of a legal right is\ndamages. Consistent with these principles, our precedents\nmake clear that the phrase “appropriate relief” includes\nmonetary relief. By adopting a contrary reading of the\nterm, the majority severely undermines the “broad protec\ntion of religious exercise” Congress intended the statute to\nprovide. §2000cc–3(g). For these reasons, I respectfully\ndissent.\n                          I\n                          A\n  As the Court acknowledges, the proposition that “States\n2                       SOSSAMON v.

S. 706, 737\n(1999) (“[W]e have not questioned the general proposition\nthat a State may waive its sovereign immunity and con\nsent to suit”); Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473\nU.

Tennessee-Missouri Bridge\nComm’n, 359 U. S. 275, 276 (1959) (noting that a State\nmay waive sovereign immunity “at its pleasure”).\n   Neither the majority nor respondents (hereinafter\nTexas) dispute that, pursuant to its power under the\nSpending Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 1, Congress\nmay secure a State’s consent to suit as a condition of the\nState’s receipt of federal funding.1 See College Savings\nBank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd.,\n527 U. S. 666, 686 (1999) (“Congress may, in the exercise\nof its spending power, condition its grant of funds to the\nStates upon their taking certain actions that Congress\ncould not require them to take, and . . . acceptance of the\nfunds entails an agreement to the actions”); Atascadero,\n473 U. S., at 247 (suggesting that a federal statute can\n“condition participation in the programs funded under the\n[statute] on a State’s consent to waive its constitutional\nimmunity”). As with all waivers of sovereign immunity,\nthe question is whether the State has unequivocally con\nsented to suit in federal court. See College Savings Bank,\n527 U. S., at 680; Atascadero, 473 U. S., at 238, n. 1.\n——————\n   1 Though the Court reserves the general question whether RLUIPA is\n\na valid exercise of Congress’ power under the Spending Clause, see\nante, at 2, n. 1, there is apparently no disagreement among the Federal\nCourts of Appeals, see 560 F. 3d 316, 328, n. 34 (CA5 2009) (“Every\ncircuit to consider whether RLUIPA is Spending Clause legislation has\nconcluded that it is constitutional under at least that power”).\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   Thus, in order to attach a waiver of sovereign immunity\nto federal funds, Congress “must do so unambiguously,” so\nas to “enable the States to exercise their choice know\ningly.” Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halder­\nman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981). In other words, the State\nmust have notice of the condition it is accepting. See\nArlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy, 548\nU. S. 291, 298 (2006) (“[C]lear notice . . . is required under\nthe Spending Clause”). The reason for requiring notice is\nsimple: “States cannot knowingly accept conditions of\nwhich they are ‘unaware’ or which they are ‘unable to\nascertain.’ ” Id., at 296 (quoting Pennhurst, 451 U. S., at\n17). In assessing whether a federal statute provides clear\nnotice of the conditions attached, “we must view the [stat\nute] from the perspective of a state official who is engaged\nin the process of deciding whether the State should accept\n[federal] funds and the obligations that go with those\nfunds.” Arlington Central, 548 U. S., at 296.\n   There is also no dispute that RLUIPA clearly conditions\na State’s receipt of federal funding on its consent to suit\nfor violations of the statute’s substantive provisions. The\nstatute states that “program[s] or activit[ies] that receiv[e]\nFederal financial assistance” may not impose a “substan\ntial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in\nor confined to an institution.” §2000cc–1. When such a\nburden has been imposed, the victim “may assert a viola\ntion of [RLUIPA] as a claim . . . in a judicial proceeding\nand obtain appropriate relief against a government,”\n§2000cc–2(a), which the statute defines, as relevant, as “a\nState, county, municipality, or other governmental entity\ncreated under the authority of a State,” §2000cc–5(4)(A)(i).\nAccordingly, it is evident that Texas had notice that, in\naccepting federal funds, it waived its sovereign immunity\nto suit by institutionalized persons upon whom it has\nimposed an unlawful substantial burden. See Madison v.\nVirginia, 474 F. 3d 118, 130 (CA4 2006) (“On its face,\n4                    SOSSAMON v.

This holding is contrary\nto general remedies principles and our precedents.\n  RLUIPA straightforwardly provides a private right of\naction to “obtain appropriate relief against a government.”\n§2000cc–2(a). Under “our traditional approach to deciding\nwhat remedies are available for violation of a federal\nright,” damages are the default—and equitable relief the\nexception—for “it is axiomatic that a court should deter\nmine the adequacy of a remedy in law before resorting to\nequitable relief.” Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public\nSchools, 503 U. S. 60, 75–76 (1992); see also Weinberger v.\nRomero-Barcelo, 456 U.

C. §6395(e)(1)\n(providing a cause of action for “appropriate relief,” but\nspecifying that “[n]othing in this subsection shall author\nize any person to recover damages”); 15 U. S. C. §797(b)(5)\n(similar).\n   If, despite the clarity of this background principle, state\nofficials reading RLUIPA were somehow still uncertain as\nto whether the phrase “appropriate relief” encompasses\nmonetary damages, our precedents would relieve any\ndoubt. In Franklin we made clear that, “absent clear\ndirection to the contrary by Congress,” federal statutes\nproviding a private right of action authorize all “appropri\nate relief,” including damages, against violators of its\nsubstantive terms. 503 U. S., at 70–71, 75–76. We reiter\nated this principle in Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U. S. 181,\n185, 187 (2002), affirming that “the scope of ‘appropriate\nrelief ’ ” includes compensatory damages.2 The holdings in\nthese cases are fully consistent with the general principle\n\n——————\n   2 The majority suggests that our use of the phrase “appropriate relief ”\n\nin Franklin and Barnes did not “put the States on notice that the same\nphrase in RLUIPA subjected them to suits for monetary relief,” because\n“[t]hose cases did not involve sovereign defendants.” Ante, at 10, n. 6.\nThe majority misperceives the point. Franklin and Barnes simply\nconfirmed what otherwise would have been already apparent to any\ninformed reader of RLUIPA—when it comes to remedying injuries to\nlegal rights, monetary damages are “appropriate relief.” Moreover, as\nnoted in the text, see supra, at 4–5, the Administrative Procedure Act\nexpressly excludes “money damages” from the “relief ” available against\nthe United States, suggesting that Congress understands the term\nnormally to encompass monetary relief even when the defendant enjoys\nsovereign immunity. See 5 U. S. C. §702; Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487\nU. S. 879, 891–892 (1988) (noting that §702 waives the United States’\nsovereign immunity to suit).\n6                         SOSSAMON v. TEXAS\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthat monetary relief is available for violations of the sub\nstantive conditions Congress attaches, through Spending\nClause legislation, to the acceptance of federal funding.\nSee Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Ed., 526 U. S. 629, 640\n(1999) (“[P]ursuant to Congress’ authority under the\nSpending Clause . . . private damages actions are avail\nable”); Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School Dist., 524\nU. S. 274, 287 (1998) (noting that “[w]hen Congress at\ntaches conditions to the award of federal funds under its\nspending power . . . private actions holding the recipient\nliable in monetary damages” are permissible). It would be\nan odd derogation of the normal rules of statutory con\nstruction for state officials reading RLUIPA to assume\nthat Congress drafted the statute in ignorance of these\nunambiguous precedents. See Merck & Co. v. Reynolds,\n559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 12) (“We normally\nassume that, when Congress enacts statutes, it is aware of\nrelevant judicial precedent”).3\n                                C\n  Accordingly, it is difficult to understand the basis for the\nCourt’s position that the phrase “appropriate relief” in\n§2000cc–2(a) fails to provide state officials with clear\nnotice that waiving sovereign immunity to monetary relief\n——————\n    3 Curiously,the majority appears to believe that it would be appro\npriate for state officials to read the statutory phrase “appropriate relief ”\nwithout reference to general remedies principles. See ante, at 12, n. 8.\nIt is well-established, however, that “Congress is understood to legis\nlate against a background of common-law . . . principles,” Astoria Fed.\nSav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501 U. S. 104, 108 (1991), and there can\nbe no doubt that general legal principles necessarily inform judicial\ndeterminations as to what remedies are available to civil plaintiffs, see,\ne.g., Atlantic Sounding Co. v. Townsend, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop., at 15) (concluding that, in light of “general principles of maritime\ntort law” punitive damages were a remedy available to the plaintiff\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). Why Texas’s sovereign immunity\ndefense renders this approach improper is a mystery the majority\nopinion leaves unsolved.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           7\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nis a condition of accepting federal funds. In arguing that\n“a waiver of sovereign immunity to other types of relief\ndoes not waive immunity to damages,” ante, at 6 (empha\nsis added), the majority appears to accept that equitable\nrelief is available to RLUIPA plaintiffs. See Madison, 474\nF. 3d, at 131 (holding that a RLUIPA plaintiff’s “claims for\nequitable relief are not barred by the Eleventh Amend\nment”); cf. 560 F. 3d 316, 331, 336 (CA5 2009) (reversing\nthe District Court’s grant of summary judgment to Texas\non one of petitioner’s RLUIPA claims for declaratory and\ninjunctive relief ). The explanation for the majority’s\nimplicit acceptance of suits for injunctive and declaratory\nrelief is obvious enough: It would be a particularly curious\nreading of the statute to conclude that Congress’ express\nprovision of a private right of action to seek “appropriate\nrelief” against “a State” nonetheless left plaintiffs suing\nfor state violations of RLUIPA with no available relief.\n   It is not apparent, however, why the phrase “appropri\nate relief” is too ambiguous to secure a waiver of state\nsovereign immunity with respect to damages but is clear\nenough as to injunctive and other forms of equitable relief.\nThe majority appears to believe that equitable relief is a\n“suitable” or “proper” remedy for a state violation of\nRLUIPA’s substantive provisions but monetary relief is\nnot; therefore, a state official reading the “open-ended and\nambiguous” phrase “appropriate relief” will be unaware\nthat it includes damages but fully apprised that it makes\nequitable relief available. See ante, at 6–7. But sovereign\nimmunity is not simply a defense against certain classes of\nremedies—it is a defense against being sued at all. See,\ne.g., Federal Maritime Comm’n v. South Carolina Ports\nAuthority, 535 U. S. 743, 766 (2002). As a result, there is\nno inherent reason why the phrase “appropriate relief”\nwould provide adequate notice as to equitable remedies\nbut not as to monetary ones. In fact, as discussed earlier,\nin light of general remedies principles the presumption\n8                       SOSSAMON v. TEXAS\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\narguably should be the reverse. See supra, at 4–6.\n   The majority suggests that equitable relief is the sole\n“appropriate relief” for statutory violations “where the\ndefendant is a sovereign.” Ante, at 6–7. There can be\nlittle doubt, however, that the “appropriateness” of relief\nto be afforded a civil plaintiff is generally determined by\nthe nature of the injury to his legal rights. See Franklin,\n503 U. S., at 76 (concluding that monetary damages were\n“appropriate” because equitable relief offered no redress\nfor the injury suffered); see also Milliken v. Bradley, 433\nU. S. 267, 280 (1977) (“[T]he nature of the . . . remedy is to\nbe determined by the nature and scope of the . . . viola\ntion”); Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 684 (1946) (“[W]here\nfederally protected rights have been invaded, it has been\nthe rule from the beginning that courts will be alert to\nadjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary relief”).\nIn support of its proposition the majority cites only to a\ncase in which we expressly rejected the argument that\nstate sovereign immunity operates differently according to\nwhat type of relief is sought. See Federal Maritime, 535\nU. S., at 765 (“[S]overeign immunity applies regardless of\nwhether a private plaintiff’s suit is for monetary damages\nor some other type of relief”); cf. id., at 769 (“[T]he primary\nfunction of sovereign immunity is not to protect state\ntreasuries, but to afford the States the dignity and respect\ndue sovereign entities” (citation omitted)). Nor is the basis\nfor the majority’s view apparent from the other cases that\nit cites.4\n——————\n    4 In\n       Lane v. Peña, 518 U. S. 187 (1996), United States v. Nordic Vil­\nlage, Inc., 503 U. S. 30 (1992), and Hoffman v. Connecticut Dept. of\nIncome Maintenance, 492 U. S. 96 (1989), we simply reaffirmed the\nprinciple that a sovereign’s liability for damages must be unambigu\nously expressed in the statute purporting to waive immunity; as dem\nonstrated above, RLUIPA satisfies this requirement. The majority\ntellingly relies on the dissent’s assertion in West v. Gibson, 527 U. S.\n212 (1999), that the phrase “appropriate remedies” was too ambiguous\n                    Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                  9\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n  The majority’s additional arguments in support of its\nholding also fail to persuade. The majority contends that\nthe use of a “context-dependent” word like “appropriate”\nnecessarily renders the provision ambiguous. Ante, at 7.\nBut the fact that the precise relief afforded by a court may\nvary depending on the particular injury to be addressed in\na given case does not render §2000cc–2(a) ambiguous; it\nsimply means that Congress meant for that provision to be\ncomprehensive. See Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections\nv. Yeskey, 524 U. S. 206, 212 (1998) (“[T]he fact that\na statute can be applied in situations not expressly anti\ncipated by Congress does not demonstrate ambiguity. It\ndemonstrates breadth” (internal quotation marks omit\nted)); cf. West v. Gibson, 527 U. S. 212, 217–218 (1999)\n(holding that the phrase “appropriate remedies” in 42\nU. S. C. §2000e–16(b) includes remedies not expressly\nenumerated).\n  Next, the majority repeats Texas’s dictionary-based\ncontention that in using the word “relief” Congress meant\nto “connot[e] equitable relief.” Ante, at 8. This proposition\nsuffers from three flaws. First, it is not established by the\ndictionary to which the majority cites. See Black’s Law\nDictionary 1293 (7th ed. 1999) (“relief: . . . Also termed\nremedy”); id., at 1296 (“remedy: . . . The means of enforc\ning a right or preventing or redressing a wrong; legal or\nequitable relief” (emphasis added)). Second, it is inconsis\ntent with our precedent. See Barnes, 536 U. S., at 185–\n187 (noting that “appropriate relief” includes monetary\nand injunctive relief ). Third, it is undermined by the fact\nthat, on numerous occasions, Congress has deemed it\nnecessary to specify that “relief” includes injunctive and\nother equitable relief. See 16 U. S. C. §973i(e) (authoriz\n—————— \n\nto waive sovereign immunity to monetary relief. See id., at 226 (opin\nion of KENNEDY, J.). Accordingly, the cases the majority cites do not\n\nmandate the conclusion it draws today. \n\n10                   SOSSAMON v. TEXAS\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ning the Attorney General to “commence a civil action\nfor appropriate relief, including permanent or tempo-\nrary injunction”); see also 2 U. S. C. §437g(a)(6)(A); 8\nU. S. C. §1324a(f)(2); 12 U. S. C. §1715z–4a(b); 15 U. S. C.\n§6309(a). If the term “relief” already connotes equitable\nrelief—and only equitable relief—additional explication is\nredundant.\n   Finally, the majority asserts that because the parties to\nthis case advance opposing “plausible arguments” regard\ning the correct interpretation of RLUIPA’s text, we must\nconclude that the statute is ambiguous. Ante, at 8–9. This\nview of how we adjudicate cases is incorrect as a descrip\ntive matter. See, e.g., Carcieri v. Salazar, 555 U. S. 379,\n390 (2009) (reviewing the parties’ conflicting textual in\nterpretations of a statute but concluding that it was un\nambiguous nonetheless). Moreover, I cannot agree with\nthe majority that our capacity to interpret authoritatively\nthe text of a federal statute is held hostage to the litigants’\nstrategic arguments. If this were true, there would be few\ncases in which we would be able to decide that a statute\nwas unambiguous.\n   In sum, the majority’s conclusion that States accepting\nfederal funds have not consented to suit for monetary\nrelief cannot be reconciled with the fact that the availabil\nity of such relief is evident in light of RLUIPA’s plain\nterms and the principles animating our relevant prece\ndents. In so holding, the majority discovers ambiguity\nwhere none is to be found.\n\n                             II\n  There is another reason to question the soundness of\ntoday’s decision. The Court’s reading of §2000cc–2(a)\nseverely undermines Congress’ unmistakably stated intent\nin passing the statute: to afford “broad protection of reli\ngious exercise, to the maximum extent permitted by the\n                      Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     11\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nterms of [the statute] and the Constitution.” §2000cc–3(g).\nI find it improbable that, in light of this express statutory\npurpose and the history of “long-running congressional\nefforts to accord religious exercise heightened protection\nfrom government-imposed burdens,” Cutter v. Wilkinson,\n544 U. S. 709, 714 (2005), state officials would read\nRLUIPA’s relief provision in the same limited manner the\nmajority does.5\n   As the majority acknowledges, RLUIPA was Congress’\nsecond attempt to guarantee by statute the “broad protec\ntion” of religious exercise that we found to be unwarranted\nas a constitutional matter in Employment Div., Dept. of\nHuman Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990).\nAs we have previously recognized, in passing RLUIPA\nCongress was clearly concerned that state institutions\nregularly imposed “frivolous or arbitrary barriers im\nped[ing] institutionalized persons’ religious exercise.”\nCutter, 544 U. S., at 716 (internal quotation marks omit\nted); see also 146 Cong. Rec. 16698, 16699 (2000) (joint\nstatement of Sen. Hatch and Sen. Kennedy on RLUIPA)\n(“Whether from indifference, ignorance, bigotry, or lack of\nresources, some institutions restrict religious liberty in\n\n——————\n   5 I agree with the majority’s conclusion that, because Section 3 of\n\nRLUIPA, addressing the rights of institutionalized persons, is not a\n“provisio[n] of [a] . . . Federal statute prohibiting discrimination” within\nthe meaning of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 42 U. S. C.\n§2000d–7(a)(1), the latter statute’s waiver provision does not put the\nStates on notice that they can be sued for damages under RLUIPA. See\nante, at 12–14. It bears noting, however, that Section 2 of RLUIPA\nexplicitly prohibits discrimination in land use regulation.              See\n§2000cc(b)(2) (“No government shall impose or implement a land use\nregulation that discriminates . . . on the basis of religion or religious\ndenomination”). As a result, the majority’s decision in this case means\nthat some RLUIPA plaintiffs will be able to seek monetary damages\nagainst a State and others will not, even though RLUIPA’s provision of\n“appropriate relief ” applies equally to suits for violations of the terms\nof both Section 2 and Section 3.\n12                    SOSSAMON v. TEXAS\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\negregious and unnecessary ways”); ibid. (“Institutional\nresidents’ rights to practice their faith is at the mercy of\nthose running the institution . . .”). It is difficult to believe\nthat Congress would have devoted such care and effort to\nestablishing significant statutory protections for religious\nexercise and specifically extended those protections to\npersons in state institutions, yet withheld from plaintiffs a\ncrucial tool for securing the rights the statute guarantees.\n   By depriving prisoners of a damages remedy for viola\ntions of their statutory rights, the majority ensures that\nplaintiffs suing state defendants under RLUIPA will be\nforced to seek enforcement of those rights with one hand\ntied behind their backs. Most obviously, the majority’s\ncategorical denial of monetary relief means that a plaintiff\nwho prevails on the merits of his claim that a State has\nsubstantially burdened his religious exercise will often be\ndenied redress for the injury he has suffered, because in\nmany instances “prospective relief accords . . . no remedy\nat all.” Franklin, 503 U. S., at 76; see H. R. Rep. No. 102–\n40, pt. 2, p. 25 (1991) (Report of Committee on the Judici\nary on the Civil Rights Act of 1991) (“The limitation of\nrelief under Title VII to equitable remedies often means\nthat victims . . . may not recover for the very real effects of\nthe [statutory violation]”). Injunctive relief from a federal\ncourt may address a violation going forward, but this\nfact will be of cold comfort to the victims of serious, non\nrecurring violations for which equitable relief may be\ninappropriate.\n   In addition, the unavailability of monetary relief will\neffectively shield unlawful policies and practices from\njudicial review in many cases. Under state law, discretion\nto transfer prisoners “in a wide variety of circumstances is\nvested in prison officials.” Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S.\n215, 227 (1976).

Absent a damages remedy, longstand\ning RLUIPA challenges may well be dismissed for lack of a\ncase or controversy conferring Article III jurisdiction on\nthe federal court. Cf. Moussazadeh v.

The\nFifth Circuit declined to apply the “voluntary cessation” doctrine in this\ncase and instead granted Texas’s motion that the court dismiss as moot\npetitioner’s claim for injunctive relief with respect to the prison’s cell\nrestriction policy. Because the prison director averred that the policy\nwas no longer in force, and “absent evidence that the voluntary ces\nsation [wa]s a sham,” the court held that the “good faith nature” of\nTexas’s change in policy rendered moot petitioner’s claim for injunctive\nrelief.

TEXAS\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   Of course, under the rule the majority announces, Con\ngress can revise RLUIPA to provide specifically for mone\ntary relief against the States, perhaps by inserting the\nphrase “including monetary relief” into the text of\n§2000cc–2(a). But we have never demanded that a waiver\nbe presented in a particular formulation to be effective; we\nonly require that it be clear. See, e.g., Edelman v. Jordan,\n415 U. S. 651, 673 (1974) (holding that waiver may be\nfound in “express language” or by “overwhelming implica\ntions from the text” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nIn holding to the contrary, the majority erects a formalis\ntic barrier to the vindication of statutory rights deliber\nately provided for by Congress.\n   More problematically, because there is no apparent\nreason why the term “appropriate relief” is sufficiently\nclear as to equitable relief but not as to monetary relief,\nwe are left with the very real possibility that, in order to\nsecure a waiver of immunity under the majority’s new\nrule, Congress must now itemize in the statutory text\nevery type of relief meant to be available against sovereign\ndefendants. I, for one, do not relish the prospect of federal\ncourts being presented with endless state challenges to all\nmanner of federal statutes, on the ground that Congress\nfailed to predict that a laundry list of terms must be in\ncluded to waive sovereign immunity to all forms of relief.\nI would avoid the problems the majority’s decision invites\nand hold instead that, as is the case here, when a general\nstatutory term like “appropriate relief” is used, clear no\ntice has been provided and a State’s acceptance of federal\nfunds constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity to all\nrelief, equitable and monetary.\n\n——————\n868, 882–883 (CA7 2009) (affirming the District Court’s dismissal as\nmoot of a RLUIPA claim because there was no evidence that the prison\nintended to revoke the plaintiff ’s religious diet); El v.

Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 54. A State, however,\n    may choose to waive its immunity. Clark v. Barnard, 108 U. S. 436,\n    447–448. The “ ‘test for determining whether [it has done so] is a\n    stringent one.’ ” College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsec­\n    ondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 675. The State’s consent to\n    suit must be “unequivocally expressed” in the relevant statute’s text.\n    Pennhurst, supra, at 99. A waiver “will be strictly construed, in\n    terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.” Lane v. Peña, 518 U. S.\n    187, 192. Pp. 4–6.\n       (b) RLUIPA’s authorization of “appropriate relief against a gov\n    ernment,” is not an unequivocal expression of state consent. Pp. 6–\n    10.\n          (1) “Appropriate relief” is open-ended and ambiguous about the\n    relief it includes. “Appropriate” is inherently context-dependent.\n    And the context here—where the defendant is a sovereign—suggests,\n    if anything, that monetary damages are not “suitable” or “proper.”\n    See Federal Maritime Comm’n v. South Carolina Ports Authority, 535\n    U. S. 743, 765. Further, where a statute is susceptible of multiple\n    plausible interpretations, including one preserving immunity, this\n    Court will not consider a State to have waived its sovereign immu\n    nity. Sossamon’s and Texas’ conflicting plausible arguments about\n    whether immunity is preserved here demonstrate that “appropriate\n    relief” in RLUIPA is not so free from ambiguity that the Court may\n    conclude that the States, by receiving federal funds, have unequivo\n    cally expressed intent to waive their immunity. Pp. 6–9.\n          (2) The Court’s use of the phrase “appropriate relief” in Franklin\n    v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60, and Barnes v. Gor­\n    man, 536 U. S. 181, does not compel a contrary conclusion. In those\n    cases, where there was no express congressional intent to limit reme\n    dies available against municipal entities under an implied right of\n    action, the Court presumed that compensatory damages were avail\n    able. Franklin, supra, at 73. But that presumption is irrelevant to\n    construing the scope of an express waiver of sovereign immunity,\n    where the question is not whether Congress has given clear direction\n    that it intends to exclude a damages remedy, but whether it has\n    given clear direction that it intends to include a damages remedy.\n    Pp. 9–10.\n       (c) Sossamon mistakenly contends that Congress’ enactment of\n    RLUIPA §3 pursuant to the Spending Clause put the States on notice\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  that they would be liable for damages because Spending Clause legis\n  lation operates as a contract and damages are always available for a\n  breach of contract. While acknowledging the contract-law analogy,\n  this Court has been clear “not [to] imply . . . that suits under Spend\n  ing Clause legislation are suits in contract, or that contract-law prin\n  ciples apply to all issues that they raise,” Barnes, supra, at 188, n. 2,\n  or to rely on that analogy to expand liability beyond what would exist\n  under nonspending statutes, much less to extend monetary liability\n  against the States. Applying ordinary contract principles here would\n  also make little sense because contracts with a sovereign are unique:\n  They do not traditionally confer a right of action for damages to en\n  force compliance. More fundamentally, Sossamon’s implied-contract\n  remedy cannot be squared with the rule that a sovereign immunity\n  waiver must be expressly and unequivocally stated in the relevant\n  statute’s text. Pp. 10–12.\n     (d) Sossamon also errs in arguing that Texas was put on notice that\n  it could be sued for damages under RLUIPA by §1003 of the Rehabili\n  tation Act Amendments of 1986, which expressly waives state sover\n  eign immunity for violations of “section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n  of 1973, title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the Age Dis\n  crimination Act of 1975, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or the\n  provisions of any other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by\n  recipients of Federal financial assistance,” 42 U. S. C. §2000d–7.\n  Even if such a residual clause could constitute an unequivocal textual\n  waiver, RLUIPA §3—which prohibits “substantial burden[s]” on reli\n  gious exercise—is not unequivocally a “statute prohibiting discrimi\n  nation” within §1003’s meaning. All the statutory provisions enu\n  merated in §1003 explicitly prohibit discrimination; a State might\n  reasonably conclude that the residual clause, strictly construed, cov\n  ers only provisions using the term “discrimination.” Pp. 12–14.\n560 F. 3d 316, affirmed.\n\n  THOMAS, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

S. C. §2000cc et seq. We\nhold that they do not. Sovereign immunity therefore bars\nthis suit for damages against the State of Texas.\n                              I\n\n                             A\n\n  RLUIPA is Congress’ second attempt to accord height\nened statutory protection to religious exercise in the wake\nof this Court’s decision in Employment Division, Depart­\nment of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U. S.\n872 (1990). Congress first enacted the Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 107 Stat. 1488, 42\nU. S. C. §2000bb et seq., with which it intended to “restore\nthe compelling interest test as set forth in Sherbert v.\nVerner, 374 U. S. 398 (1963) and Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406\nU. S. 205 (1972) . . . in all cases where free exercise of\nreligion is substantially burdened.” §2000bb(b)(1). See\n2                       SOSSAMON v. TEXAS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ngenerally Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficente União\ndo Vegetal, 546 U. S. 418, 424 (2006). We held RFRA\nunconstitutional as applied to state and local governments\nbecause it exceeded Congress’ power under §5 of the Four\nteenth Amendment. See City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S.\n507 (1997).\n   Congress responded by enacting RLUIPA pursuant to\nits Spending Clause and Commerce Clause authority.\nRLUIPA borrows important elements from RFRA—which\ncontinues to apply to the Federal Government—but\nRLUIPA is less sweeping in scope. See Cutter v. Wilkin­\nson, 544 U. S. 709, 715 (2005). It targets two areas of\nstate and local action: land-use regulation, 42 U. S. C.\n§2000cc (RLUIPA §2), and restrictions on the religious\nexercise of institutionalized persons, §2000cc–1 (RLUIPA\n§3).\n   Section 3 of RLUIPA provides that “[n]o government\nshall impose a substantial burden on the religious exer\ncise” of an institutionalized person unless, as in RFRA, the\ngovernment demonstrates that the burden “is in further\nance of a compelling governmental interest” and “is the\nleast restrictive means of furthering” that interest.\n§2000cc–1(a); cf. §§2000bb–1(a), (b). As relevant here, §3\napplies “in any case” in which “the substantial burden is\nimposed in a program or activity that receives Federal\nfinancial assistance.”1 §2000cc–1(b)(1).\n   RLUIPA also includes an express private cause of action\nthat is taken from RFRA: “A person may assert a violation\nof [RLUIPA] as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding\nand obtain appropriate relief against a government.”\n§2000cc–2(a); cf. §2000bb–1(c). For purposes of this provi\n——————\n  1 No party contends that the Commerce Clause permitted Congress to\n\naddress the alleged burden on religious exercise at issue in this case.\nSee 42 U. S. C. §2000cc–1(b)(2). Nor is Congress’ authority to enact\nRLUIPA under the Spending Clause challenged here. We therefore do\nnot address those issues.\n                      Cite as: 563 U.

In 2006, Sos\nsamon sued the State of Texas and various prison officials\nin their official capacities under RLUIPA’s private cause of\naction, seeking injunctive and monetary relief. Sossamon\nalleged that two prison policies violated RLUIPA: (1) a\npolicy preventing inmates from attending religious ser\nvices while on cell restriction for disciplinary infractions;\nand (2) a policy barring use of the prison chapel for reli\ngious worship. The District Court granted summary\njudgment in favor of respondents and held, as relevant\nhere, that sovereign immunity barred Sossamon’s claims\nfor monetary relief.2 See 713 F. Supp. 2d 657, 662–663\n(WD Tex. 2007).\n  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 560\nF. 3d 316, 329 (2009). Acknowledging that Congress\nenacted RLUIPA pursuant to the Spending Clause, the\ncourt determined that Texas had not waived its sovereign\nimmunity by accepting federal funds.

The Court of Appeals subsequently held that\nSossamon’s claim for injunctive relief with respect to the cell-restriction\npolicy was moot because the State had abandoned that policy after\nSossamon filed a prison grievance. 560 F. 3d 316, 326 (CA5 2009). The\nCourt of Appeals reversed the District Court with respect to Sossamon’s\nchapel-use policy claim, id., at 331–335, although the Robertson Unit\nlater amended that policy also and now permits inmates to attend\nscheduled worship services in the chapel subject to certain safety\nprecautions.\n4                       SOSSAMON v.

See Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Hal­\nderman, 465 U. S. 89, 98 (1984). For over a century now,\nthis Court has consistently made clear that “federal juris\ndiction over suits against unconsenting States ‘was not\ncontemplated by the Constitution when establishing the\njudicial power of the United States.’ ” Seminole Tribe of\nFla. v.

A State, however, may choose to waive\nits immunity in federal court at its pleasure. Clark v.\nBarnard, 108 U.

Florida Prepaid\nPostsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 675 (1999)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). A State’s consent to\nsuit must be “unequivocally expressed” in the text of the\nrelevant statute. Pennhurst State School and Hospital,\nsupra, at 99; see Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473\nU. S. 234, 238, n. 1, 239–240 (1985). Only by requiring\nthis “clear declaration” by the State can we be “certain\nthat the State in fact consents to suit.” College Savings\nBank, 527 U. S., at 680. Waiver may not be implied.

Similarly, a waiver\nof sovereign immunity to other types of relief does not\nwaive immunity to damages: “[T]he waiver of sovereign\nimmunity must extend unambiguously to such monetary\nclaims.” Lane, supra, at 192; cf. United States v. Nordic\nVillage, 503 U. S. 30, 34 (1992) (construing an ambiguous\nwaiver of sovereign immunity to permit equitable but not\nmonetary claims); Hoffman v. Connecticut Dept. of Income\nMaintenance, 492 U. S. 96, 101–102 (1989) (construing a\nstatute to authorize injunctive relief but not “monetary\nrecovery from the States” because intent to abrogate im\nmunity to monetary recovery was not “ ‘unmistakably clear\nin the language of the statute’ ” (quoting Atascadero, su­\npra, at 242)).\n                               III \n\n                                A\n\n  RLUIPA’s authorization of “appropriate relief against a\ngovernment,” §2000cc–2(a), is not the unequivocal expres\nsion of state consent that our precedents require. “Appro\npriate relief ” does not so clearly and unambiguously waive\nsovereign immunity to private suits for damages that we\ncan “be certain that the State in fact consents” to such a\nsuit.

See, e.g., 560 F. 3d, at 330–331.5 Far from\nclearly identifying money damages, the word “appropriate”\nis inherently context-dependent. See Webster’s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 106 (1993) (defining “appropri\nate” as “specially suitable: FIT, PROPER”). The context\nhere—where the defendant is a sovereign—suggests, if\nanything, that monetary damages are not “suitable” or\n“proper.” See Federal Maritime Comm’n, 535 U. S., at 765\n(“[S]tate sovereign immunity serves the important func\ntion of shielding state treasuries . . .”).\n   Indeed, both the Court and dissent appeared to agree in\nWest v. Gibson, 527 U. S. 212 (1999), that “appropriate”\nrelief, by itself, does not unambiguously include damages\nagainst a sovereign. The question was whether the Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission, which has author\nity to enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act against the\nFederal Government “through appropriate remedies,”\ncould require the Federal Government to pay damages. 42\nU. S. C. §2000e–16(b). The dissent argued that the phrase\n“appropriate remedies” did not authorize damages “in\nexpress and unequivocal terms.” Gibson, 527 U. S., at 226\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.). The Court apparently did not\ndisagree but reasoned that “appropriate remedies” had a\nflexible meaning that had expanded to include money\ndamages after a related statute was amended to explicitly\nallow damages in actions under Title VII. See id., at 217–\n218.\n   Further, where a statute is susceptible of multiple\nplausible interpretations, including one preserving immu\nnity, we will not consider a State to have waived its sover\neign immunity.

TEXAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(1989) (holding that “a permissible inference” is not the\nnecessary “unequivocal declaration” that States were\nintended to be subject to damages actions); Nordic Village,\nsupra, at 37 (holding that the existence of “plausible”\ninterpretations that would not permit recovery “is enough\nto establish that a reading imposing monetary liability on\nthe Government is not ‘unambiguous’ and therefore should\nnot be adopted”). That is the case here.\n   Sossamon argues that, because RLUIPA expressly\nlimits the United States to “injunctive or declaratory\nrelief ” to enforce the statute, the phrase “appropriate re\nlief ” in the private cause of action necessarily must be\nbroader. 42 U. S. C. §2000cc–2(f). Texas responds that,\nbecause the State has no immunity defense to a suit\nbrought by the Federal Government, Congress needed to\nexclude damages affirmatively in that context but not in\nthe context of private suits. Further, the private cause of\naction provides that a person may assert a violation of the\nstatute “as a claim or defense.” §2000cc–2(a) (emphasis\nadded). Because an injunction or declaratory judgment is\nnot “appropriate relief ” for a successful defense, Texas\nexplains, explicitly limiting the private cause of action to\nthose forms of relief would make no sense.\n   Sossamon also emphasizes that the statute requires\nthat it be “construed in favor of a broad protection of\nreligious exercise.” §2000cc–3(g). Texas responds that\nthis provision is best read as addressing the substantive\nstandards in the statute, not the scope of “appropriate\nrelief.” Texas also highlights Congress’ choice of the word\n“relief,” which it argues primarily connotes equitable\nrelief. See Black’s Law Dictionary 1295 (7th ed. 1999)\n(defining “relief ” as “[t]he redress or benefit, esp. equitable\nin nature . . . , that a party asks of a court”).\n   These plausible arguments demonstrate that the phrase\n“appropriate relief ” in RLUIPA is not so free from ambigu\nity that we may conclude that the States, by receiving\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal funds, have unequivocally expressed intent to\nwaive their sovereign immunity to suits for damages.\nStrictly construing that phrase in favor of the sovereign—\nas we must, see Lane, 518 U. S., at 192—we conclude that\nit does not include suits for damages against a State.\n                                2\n   The Court’s use of the phrase “appropriate relief” in\nFranklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60\n(1992), and Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U. S. 181 (2002), does\nnot compel a contrary conclusion. In those cases, the\nCourt addressed what remedies are available against\nmunicipal entities under the implied right of action to\nenforce Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,\n§202 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and\n§504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. With no statutory\ntext to interpret, the Court “presume[d] the availability of\nall appropriate remedies unless Congress ha[d] expressly\nindicated otherwise.” Franklin, 503 U. S., at 66. The\nCourt described the presumption as “[t]he general rule”\nthat “the federal courts have the power to award any\nappropriate relief in a cognizable cause of action brought\npursuant to a federal statute.” Id., at 70–71 (emphasis\nadded); see Barnes, supra, at 185 (quoting Franklin, su­\npra, at 73). Finding no express congressional intent to\nlimit the remedies available under the implied right of\naction, the Court held that compensatory damages were\navailable. Franklin, supra, at 73.\n   The presumption in Franklin and Barnes is irrelevant to\nconstruing the scope of an express waiver of sovereign\nimmunity. See Lane, supra, at 196 (“[R]eliance on Frank­\nlin . . . is misplaced” in determining whether damages are\navailable against the Federal Government). The question\nhere is not whether Congress has given clear direction\nthat it intends to exclude a damages remedy, see Franklin,\nsupra, at 70–71, but whether Congress has given clear\n10                      SOSSAMON v. TEXAS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndirection that it intends to include a damages remedy.\nThe text must “establish unambiguously that the waiver\nextends to monetary claims.” Nordic Village, 503 U. S., at\n34. In Franklin and Barnes, congressional silence had an\nentirely different implication than it does here. Whatever\n“appropriate relief ” might have meant in those cases does\nnot translate to this context.6\n                              B\n    Sossamon contends that, because Congress enacted §3 of\nRLUIPA pursuant to the Spending Clause, the States\nwere necessarily on notice that they would be liable for\ndamages. He argues that Spending Clause legislation\noperates as a contract and damages are always available\nrelief for a breach of contract, whether the contract explic\nitly includes a damages remedy or not. Relying on Barnes\nand Franklin, he asserts that all recipients of federal\nfunding are “ ‘generally on notice that [they are] subject\n. . . to those remedies traditionally available in suits for\nbreach of contract,’ ” including compensatory damages.\nBrief for Petitioner 27 (quoting Barnes, 536 U. S., at 187).\n    We have acknowledged the contract-law analogy, but we\nhave been clear “not [to] imply . . . that suits under Spend\ning Clause legislation are suits in contract, or that\n\n——————\n   6 Nor can it be said that this Court’s use of the phrase “appropriate\n\nrelief ” in Franklin and Barnes somehow put the States on notice that\nthe same phrase in RLUIPA subjected them to suits for monetary\nrelief. Those cases did not involve sovereign defendants, so the Court\nhad no occasion to consider sovereign immunity. Liability against\nnonsovereigns could not put the States on notice that they would be\nliable in the same manner, absent an unequivocal textual waiver.\nMoreover, the same phrase in RFRA had been interpreted not to\ninclude damages relief against the Federal Government or the States\nand so could have signaled to the States that damages are not “appro\npriate relief ” under RLUIPA. See, e.g., Tinsley v. Pittari, 952 F. Supp.\n384, 389 (ND Tex. 1996); Commack Self-Service Kosher Meats Inc. v.\nNew York, 954 F. Supp. 65, 69 (EDNY 1997).\n                    Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                 11\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ncontract-law principles apply to all issues that they raise.”\nBarnes, supra, at 189, n. 2. We have not relied on the\nSpending Clause contract analogy to expand liability\nbeyond what would exist under non-spending statutes,\nmuch less to extend monetary liability against the States,\nas Sossamon would have us do. In fact, in Barnes and\nFranklin, the Court discussed the Spending Clause con\ntext only as a potential limitation on liability. See Barnes,\nsupra, at 187–188; Franklin, supra, at 74–75.\n  In any event, applying ordinary contract principles here\nwould make little sense because contracts with a sovereign\nare unique. They do not traditionally confer a right of\naction for damages to enforce compliance: “ ‘The contracts\nbetween a Nation and an individual are only binding on\nthe conscience of the sovereign and have no pretensions to\ncompulsive force. They confer no right of action independ\nent of the sovereign will.’ ” Lynch v. United States, 292\nU. S. 571, 580–581 (1934) (quoting The Federalist, No. 81,\nat 511 (A. Hamilton)).7\n  More fundamentally, Sossamon’s implied-contract\nremedies proposal cannot be squared with our longstand\ning rule that a waiver of sovereign immunity must be\nexpressly and unequivocally stated in the text of the rele\nvant statute. It would be bizarre to create an “unequivocal\nstatement” rule and then find that every Spending Clause\nenactment, no matter what its text, satisfies that rule\nbecause it includes unexpressed, implied remedies against\nthe States. The requirement of a clear statement in the\ntext of the statute ensures that Congress has specifically\nconsidered state sovereign immunity and has intentionally\nlegislated on the matter. Cf. Spector v. Norwegian Cruise\nLine Ltd., 545 U. S. 119, 139 (2005) (plurality opinion)\n——————\n  7 Of course, the Federal Government has, by statute, waived its sov\n\nereign immunity to damages for breach of contract in certain contexts.\nSee, e.g., 28 U. S. C. §1491(a)(1).\n12                       SOSSAMON v. TEXAS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n(“[C]lear statement rules ensure Congress does not, by\nbroad or general language, legislate on a sensitive topic\ninadvertently or without due deliberation”). Without such\na clear statement from Congress and notice to the States,\nfederal courts may not step in and abrogate state sover\neign immunity.8\n                              IV\n   Sossamon also argues that §1003 of the Rehabilitation\nAct Amendments of 1986, 42 U. S. C. §2000d–7, independ\nently put the State on notice that it could be sued for\ndamages under RLUIPA. That provision expressly waives\nstate sovereign immunity for violations of “section 504 of\nthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973, title IX of the Education\nAmendments of 1972, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975,\ntitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or the provisions of\nany other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by\nrecipients of Federal financial assistance.” §2000d–7(a)(1)\n(emphasis added). Section 1003 makes “remedies (includ\ning remedies both at law and in equity) . . . available for\nsuch a violation to the same extent as such remedies are\navailable for such a violation in the suit against any public\nor private entity other than a State.” §2000d–7(a)(2).\nSossamon contends that §3 of RLUIPA falls within the\nresidual clause of §1003 and therefore §1003 waives Texas’\nsovereign immunity to RLUIPA suits for damages.\n——————\n  8 The  dissent finds our decision “difficult to understand,” post, at 6\n(opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.), but it follows naturally from this Court’s\nprecedents regarding waiver of sovereign immunity, which the dissent\ngives astonishingly short shrift. The dissent instead concerns itself\nprimarily with “general remedies principles.” Post, at 1. The essence of\nsovereign immunity, however, is that remedies against the government\ndiffer from “general remedies principles” applicable to private litigants.\nSee, e.g., Lane v. Peña, 518 U. S. 187, 196 (1996) (calling it a “crucial\npoint that, when it comes to an award of money damages, sovereign\nimmunity places the . . . Government on an entirely different footing\nthan private parties”).\n                    Cite as: 563 U.

This distinction is espe\ncially conspicuous in light of §2 of RLUIPA, in which\nCongress expressly prohibited “land use regulation[s] that\ndiscriminat[e] . . . on the basis of religion.” §2000cc(b)(2).\nA waiver of sovereign immunity must be “strictly con\nstrued, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.”\nLane, 518 U. S., at 192. We cannot say that the residual\nclause clearly extends to §3; a State might reasonably\nconclude that the clause covers only provisions using the\nterm “discrimination.”\n   The statutory provisions specifically listed in §1003\nconfirm that §3 does not unequivocally come within the\nscope of the residual clause. “[G]eneral words,” such as\nthe residual clause here, “are construed to embrace only\nobjects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by\nthe preceding specific words.” Washington State Dept. of\nSocial and Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of Keffe­\nler, 537 U. S. 371, 384 (2003) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also Jarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S.\n303, 307 (1961) (noting that this maxim “is often wisely\napplied where a word is capable of many meanings in\norder to avoid the giving of unintended breadth to the Acts\nof Congress”). Unlike §3, each of the statutes specifically\nenumerated in §1003 explicitly prohibits “discrimination.”\nSee 29 U. S. C. §794(a); 20 U. S. C. §1681(a); 42 U. S. C.\n§§6101, 6102; 42 U. S.

By Sossamon’s reasoning,\nevery Spending Clause statute that arguably provides a benefit to a\nclass of people or activities would become a federal statute “prohibiting\ndiscrimination,” thereby waiving sovereign immunity.

S. C. §2000cc et seq. I dis\nagree. No one disputes that, in accepting federal funds,\nthe States consent to suit for violations of RLUIPA’s sub\nstantive provisions; the only question is what relief is\navailable to plaintiffs asserting injury from such viola\ntions. That monetary damages are “appropriate relief” is,\nin my view, self-evident. Under general remedies princi\nples, the usual remedy for a violation of a legal right is\ndamages. Consistent with these principles, our precedents\nmake clear that the phrase “appropriate relief” includes\nmonetary relief. By adopting a contrary reading of the\nterm, the majority severely undermines the “broad protec\ntion of religious exercise” Congress intended the statute to\nprovide. §2000cc–3(g). For these reasons, I respectfully\ndissent.\n                          I\n                          A\n  As the Court acknowledges, the proposition that “States\n2                       SOSSAMON v.

S. 44,\n65 (1996); see also Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 737\n(1999) (“[W]e have not questioned the general proposition\nthat a State may waive its sovereign immunity and con\nsent to suit”); Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473\nU. S. 234, 238 (1985) (noting the “well-established” prin\nciple that “if a State waives its immunity and consents\nto suit in federal court, the Eleventh Amendment does\nnot bar the action”); Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge\nComm’n, 359 U. S. 275, 276 (1959) (noting that a State\nmay waive sovereign immunity “at its pleasure”).\n   Neither the majority nor respondents (hereinafter\nTexas) dispute that, pursuant to its power under the\nSpending Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 1, Congress\nmay secure a State’s consent to suit as a condition of the\nState’s receipt of federal funding.1 See College Savings\nBank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd.,\n527 U. S. 666, 686 (1999) (“Congress may, in the exercise\nof its spending power, condition its grant of funds to the\nStates upon their taking certain actions that Congress\ncould not require them to take, and . . . acceptance of the\nfunds entails an agreement to the actions”); Atascadero,\n473 U. S., at 247 (suggesting that a federal statute can\n“condition participation in the programs funded under the\n[statute] on a State’s consent to waive its constitutional\nimmunity”). As with all waivers of sovereign immunity,\nthe question is whether the State has unequivocally con\nsented to suit in federal court. See College Savings Bank,\n527 U. S., at 680; Atascadero, 473 U. S., at 238, n. 1.\n——————\n   1 Though the Court reserves the general question whether RLUIPA is\n\na valid exercise of Congress’ power under the Spending Clause, see\nante, at 2, n. 1, there is apparently no disagreement among the Federal\nCourts of Appeals, see 560 F. 3d 316, 328, n. 34 (CA5 2009) (“Every\ncircuit to consider whether RLUIPA is Spending Clause legislation has\nconcluded that it is constitutional under at least that power”).\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   Thus, in order to attach a waiver of sovereign immunity\nto federal funds, Congress “must do so unambiguously,” so\nas to “enable the States to exercise their choice know\ningly.” Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halder­\nman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981). In other words, the State\nmust have notice of the condition it is accepting. See\nArlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy, 548\nU. S. 291, 298 (2006) (“[C]lear notice . . . is required under\nthe Spending Clause”). The reason for requiring notice is\nsimple: “States cannot knowingly accept conditions of\nwhich they are ‘unaware’ or which they are ‘unable to\nascertain.’ ” Id., at 296 (quoting Pennhurst, 451 U. S., at\n17). In assessing whether a federal statute provides clear\nnotice of the conditions attached, “we must view the [stat\nute] from the perspective of a state official who is engaged\nin the process of deciding whether the State should accept\n[federal] funds and the obligations that go with those\nfunds.” Arlington Central, 548 U. S., at 296.\n   There is also no dispute that RLUIPA clearly conditions\na State’s receipt of federal funding on its consent to suit\nfor violations of the statute’s substantive provisions. The\nstatute states that “program[s] or activit[ies] that receiv[e]\nFederal financial assistance” may not impose a “substan\ntial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in\nor confined to an institution.” §2000cc–1. When such a\nburden has been imposed, the victim “may assert a viola\ntion of [RLUIPA] as a claim . . . in a judicial proceeding\nand obtain appropriate relief against a government,”\n§2000cc–2(a), which the statute defines, as relevant, as “a\nState, county, municipality, or other governmental entity\ncreated under the authority of a State,” §2000cc–5(4)(A)(i).\nAccordingly, it is evident that Texas had notice that, in\naccepting federal funds, it waived its sovereign immunity\nto suit by institutionalized persons upon whom it has\nimposed an unlawful substantial burden. See Madison v.\nVirginia, 474 F. 3d 118, 130 (CA4 2006) (“On its face,\n4                    SOSSAMON v. TEXAS\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nRLUIPA . . . creates a private cause of action against the\nState, and Virginia cannot be heard to claim that it was\nunaware of this condition” (citations omitted)); Benning v.\nGeorgia, 391 F. 3d 1299, 1305 (CA11 2004) (“Congress\nunambiguously required states to waive their sovereign\nimmunity from suits filed by prisoners to enforce\nRLUIPA”).\n                              B\n  The Court holds that the phrase “appropriate relief”\ndoes not provide state officials clear notice that monetary\nrelief will be available against the States, meaning that\nthey could not have waived their immunity with respect to\nthat particular type of liability. This holding is contrary\nto general remedies principles and our precedents.\n  RLUIPA straightforwardly provides a private right of\naction to “obtain appropriate relief against a government.”\n§2000cc–2(a). Under “our traditional approach to deciding\nwhat remedies are available for violation of a federal\nright,” damages are the default—and equitable relief the\nexception—for “it is axiomatic that a court should deter\nmine the adequacy of a remedy in law before resorting to\nequitable relief.” Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public\nSchools, 503 U. S. 60, 75–76 (1992); see also Weinberger v.\nRomero-Barcelo, 456 U. S. 305, 312 (1982) (“The Court has\nrepeatedly held that the basis for injunctive relief in the\nfederal courts has always been . . . the inadequacy of legal\nremedies”); Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed.

Geertson\nSeed Farms, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 24) (“An\ninjunction is a drastic and extraordinary remedy, which\nshould not be granted as a matter of course”).

C. §702 (providing that,\nunder the Administrative Procedure Act, “relief other than\nmoney damages” is available against a federal agency to\nremedy a “legal wrong”); see also 42 U. S. C. §6395(e)(1)\n(providing a cause of action for “appropriate relief,” but\nspecifying that “[n]othing in this subsection shall author\nize any person to recover damages”); 15 U. S. C. §797(b)(5)\n(similar).\n   If, despite the clarity of this background principle, state\nofficials reading RLUIPA were somehow still uncertain as\nto whether the phrase “appropriate relief” encompasses\nmonetary damages, our precedents would relieve any\ndoubt. In Franklin we made clear that, “absent clear\ndirection to the contrary by Congress,” federal statutes\nproviding a private right of action authorize all “appropri\nate relief,” including damages, against violators of its\nsubstantive terms. 503 U. S., at 70–71, 75–76. We reiter\nated this principle in Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U. S. 181,\n185, 187 (2002), affirming that “the scope of ‘appropriate\nrelief ’ ” includes compensatory damages.2 The holdings in\nthese cases are fully consistent with the general principle\n\n——————\n   2 The majority suggests that our use of the phrase “appropriate relief ”\n\nin Franklin and Barnes did not “put the States on notice that the same\nphrase in RLUIPA subjected them to suits for monetary relief,” because\n“[t]hose cases did not involve sovereign defendants.” Ante, at 10, n. 6.\nThe majority misperceives the point. Franklin and Barnes simply\nconfirmed what otherwise would have been already apparent to any\ninformed reader of RLUIPA—when it comes to remedying injuries to\nlegal rights, monetary damages are “appropriate relief.” Moreover, as\nnoted in the text, see supra, at 4–5, the Administrative Procedure Act\nexpressly excludes “money damages” from the “relief ” available against\nthe United States, suggesting that Congress understands the term\nnormally to encompass monetary relief even when the defendant enjoys\nsovereign immunity. See 5 U. S. C. §702; Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487\nU. S. 879, 891–892 (1988) (noting that §702 waives the United States’\nsovereign immunity to suit).\n6                         SOSSAMON v. TEXAS\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthat monetary relief is available for violations of the sub\nstantive conditions Congress attaches, through Spending\nClause legislation, to the acceptance of federal funding.\nSee Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Ed., 526 U. S. 629, 640\n(1999) (“[P]ursuant to Congress’ authority under the\nSpending Clause . . . private damages actions are avail\nable”); Gebser v.

S. 274, 287 (1998) (noting that “[w]hen Congress at\ntaches conditions to the award of federal funds under its\nspending power . . . private actions holding the recipient\nliable in monetary damages” are permissible). It would be\nan odd derogation of the normal rules of statutory con\nstruction for state officials reading RLUIPA to assume\nthat Congress drafted the statute in ignorance of these\nunambiguous precedents. See Merck & Co. v. Reynolds,\n559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 12) (“We normally\nassume that, when Congress enacts statutes, it is aware of\nrelevant judicial precedent”).3\n                                C\n  Accordingly, it is difficult to understand the basis for the\nCourt’s position that the phrase “appropriate relief” in\n§2000cc–2(a) fails to provide state officials with clear\nnotice that waiving sovereign immunity to monetary relief\n——————\n    3 Curiously,the majority appears to believe that it would be appro\npriate for state officials to read the statutory phrase “appropriate relief ”\nwithout reference to general remedies principles. See ante, at 12, n. 8.\nIt is well-established, however, that “Congress is understood to legis\nlate against a background of common-law . . . principles,” Astoria Fed.\nSav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501 U. S. 104, 108 (1991), and there can\nbe no doubt that general legal principles necessarily inform judicial\ndeterminations as to what remedies are available to civil plaintiffs, see,\ne.g., Atlantic Sounding Co. v. Townsend, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop., at 15) (concluding that, in light of “general principles of maritime\ntort law” punitive damages were a remedy available to the plaintiff\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). Why Texas’s sovereign immunity\ndefense renders this approach improper is a mystery the majority\nopinion leaves unsolved.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

In arguing that\n“a waiver of sovereign immunity to other types of relief\ndoes not waive immunity to damages,” ante, at 6 (empha\nsis added), the majority appears to accept that equitable\nrelief is available to RLUIPA plaintiffs. See Madison, 474\nF. 3d, at 131 (holding that a RLUIPA plaintiff’s “claims for\nequitable relief are not barred by the Eleventh Amend\nment”); cf. 560 F. 3d 316, 331, 336 (CA5 2009) (reversing\nthe District Court’s grant of summary judgment to Texas\non one of petitioner’s RLUIPA claims for declaratory and\ninjunctive relief ). The explanation for the majority’s\nimplicit acceptance of suits for injunctive and declaratory\nrelief is obvious enough: It would be a particularly curious\nreading of the statute to conclude that Congress’ express\nprovision of a private right of action to seek “appropriate\nrelief” against “a State” nonetheless left plaintiffs suing\nfor state violations of RLUIPA with no available relief.\n   It is not apparent, however, why the phrase “appropri\nate relief” is too ambiguous to secure a waiver of state\nsovereign immunity with respect to damages but is clear\nenough as to injunctive and other forms of equitable relief.\nThe majority appears to believe that equitable relief is a\n“suitable” or “proper” remedy for a state violation of\nRLUIPA’s substantive provisions but monetary relief is\nnot; therefore, a state official reading the “open-ended and\nambiguous” phrase “appropriate relief” will be unaware\nthat it includes damages but fully apprised that it makes\nequitable relief available. See ante, at 6–7. But sovereign\nimmunity is not simply a defense against certain classes of\nremedies—it is a defense against being sued at all. See,\ne.g., Federal Maritime Comm’n v. South Carolina Ports\nAuthority, 535 U. S. 743, 766 (2002). As a result, there is\nno inherent reason why the phrase “appropriate relief”\nwould provide adequate notice as to equitable remedies\nbut not as to monetary ones. In fact, as discussed earlier,\nin light of general remedies principles the presumption\n8                       SOSSAMON v. TEXAS\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\narguably should be the reverse. See supra, at 4–6.\n   The majority suggests that equitable relief is the sole\n“appropriate relief” for statutory violations “where the\ndefendant is a sovereign.” Ante, at 6–7. There can be\nlittle doubt, however, that the “appropriateness” of relief\nto be afforded a civil plaintiff is generally determined by\nthe nature of the injury to his legal rights. See Franklin,\n503 U. S., at 76 (concluding that monetary damages were\n“appropriate” because equitable relief offered no redress\nfor the injury suffered); see also Milliken v. Bradley, 433\nU. S. 267, 280 (1977) (“[T]he nature of the . . . remedy is to\nbe determined by the nature and scope of the . . . viola\ntion”); Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 684 (1946) (“[W]here\nfederally protected rights have been invaded, it has been\nthe rule from the beginning that courts will be alert to\nadjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary relief”).\nIn support of its proposition the majority cites only to a\ncase in which we expressly rejected the argument that\nstate sovereign immunity operates differently according to\nwhat type of relief is sought. See Federal Maritime, 535\nU. S., at 765 (“[S]overeign immunity applies regardless of\nwhether a private plaintiff’s suit is for monetary damages\nor some other type of relief”); cf. id., at 769 (“[T]he primary\nfunction of sovereign immunity is not to protect state\ntreasuries, but to afford the States the dignity and respect\ndue sovereign entities” (citation omitted)). Nor is the basis\nfor the majority’s view apparent from the other cases that\nit cites.4\n——————\n    4 In\n       Lane v. Peña, 518 U. S. 187 (1996), United States v. Nordic Vil­\nlage, Inc., 503 U. S. 30 (1992), and Hoffman v. Connecticut Dept. of\nIncome Maintenance, 492 U. S. 96 (1989), we simply reaffirmed the\nprinciple that a sovereign’s liability for damages must be unambigu\nously expressed in the statute purporting to waive immunity; as dem\nonstrated above, RLUIPA satisfies this requirement. The majority\ntellingly relies on the dissent’s assertion in West v. Gibson, 527 U. S.\n212 (1999), that the phrase “appropriate remedies” was too ambiguous\n                    Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                  9\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n  The majority’s additional arguments in support of its\nholding also fail to persuade. The majority contends that\nthe use of a “context-dependent” word like “appropriate”\nnecessarily renders the provision ambiguous. Ante, at 7.\nBut the fact that the precise relief afforded by a court may\nvary depending on the particular injury to be addressed in\na given case does not render §2000cc–2(a) ambiguous; it\nsimply means that Congress meant for that provision to be\ncomprehensive. See Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections\nv. Yeskey, 524 U. S. 206, 212 (1998) (“[T]he fact that\na statute can be applied in situations not expressly anti\ncipated by Congress does not demonstrate ambiguity. It\ndemonstrates breadth” (internal quotation marks omit\nted)); cf. West v. Gibson, 527 U. S. 212, 217–218 (1999)\n(holding that the phrase “appropriate remedies” in 42\nU. S. C. §2000e–16(b) includes remedies not expressly\nenumerated).\n  Next, the majority repeats Texas’s dictionary-based\ncontention that in using the word “relief” Congress meant\nto “connot[e] equitable relief.” Ante, at 8. This proposition\nsuffers from three flaws. First, it is not established by the\ndictionary to which the majority cites. See Black’s Law\nDictionary 1293 (7th ed. 1999) (“relief: . . . Also termed\nremedy”); id., at 1296 (“remedy: . . . The means of enforc\ning a right or preventing or redressing a wrong; legal or\nequitable relief” (emphasis added)). Second, it is inconsis\ntent with our precedent. See Barnes, 536 U. S., at 185–\n187 (noting that “appropriate relief” includes monetary\nand injunctive relief ). Third, it is undermined by the fact\nthat, on numerous occasions, Congress has deemed it\nnecessary to specify that “relief” includes injunctive and\nother equitable relief. See 16 U. S. C. §973i(e) (authoriz\n—————— \n\nto waive sovereign immunity to monetary relief. See id., at 226 (opin\nion of KENNEDY, J.). Accordingly, the cases the majority cites do not\n\nmandate the conclusion it draws today. \n\n10                   SOSSAMON v. TEXAS\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ning the Attorney General to “commence a civil action\nfor appropriate relief, including permanent or tempo-\nrary injunction”); see also 2 U. S. C. §437g(a)(6)(A); 8\nU. S. C. §1324a(f)(2); 12 U. S. C. §1715z–4a(b); 15 U. S. C.\n§6309(a). If the term “relief” already connotes equitable\nrelief—and only equitable relief—additional explication is\nredundant.\n   Finally, the majority asserts that because the parties to\nthis case advance opposing “plausible arguments” regard\ning the correct interpretation of RLUIPA’s text, we must\nconclude that the statute is ambiguous. Ante, at 8–9. This\nview of how we adjudicate cases is incorrect as a descrip\ntive matter. See, e.g., Carcieri v. Salazar, 555 U. S. 379,\n390 (2009) (reviewing the parties’ conflicting textual in\nterpretations of a statute but concluding that it was un\nambiguous nonetheless). Moreover, I cannot agree with\nthe majority that our capacity to interpret authoritatively\nthe text of a federal statute is held hostage to the litigants’\nstrategic arguments. If this were true, there would be few\ncases in which we would be able to decide that a statute\nwas unambiguous.\n   In sum, the majority’s conclusion that States accepting\nfederal funds have not consented to suit for monetary\nrelief cannot be reconciled with the fact that the availabil\nity of such relief is evident in light of RLUIPA’s plain\nterms and the principles animating our relevant prece\ndents. In so holding, the majority discovers ambiguity\nwhere none is to be found.\n\n                             II\n  There is another reason to question the soundness of\ntoday’s decision. The Court’s reading of §2000cc–2(a)\nseverely undermines Congress’ unmistakably stated intent\nin passing the statute: to afford “broad protection of reli\ngious exercise, to the maximum extent permitted by the\n                      Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     11\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nterms of [the statute] and the Constitution.” §2000cc–3(g).\nI find it improbable that, in light of this express statutory\npurpose and the history of “long-running congressional\nefforts to accord religious exercise heightened protection\nfrom government-imposed burdens,” Cutter v. Wilkinson,\n544 U. S. 709, 714 (2005), state officials would read\nRLUIPA’s relief provision in the same limited manner the\nmajority does.5\n   As the majority acknowledges, RLUIPA was Congress’\nsecond attempt to guarantee by statute the “broad protec\ntion” of religious exercise that we found to be unwarranted\nas a constitutional matter in Employment Div., Dept. of\nHuman Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990).\nAs we have previously recognized, in passing RLUIPA\nCongress was clearly concerned that state institutions\nregularly imposed “frivolous or arbitrary barriers im\nped[ing] institutionalized persons’ religious exercise.”\nCutter, 544 U. S., at 716 (internal quotation marks omit\nted); see also 146 Cong. Rec. 16698, 16699 (2000) (joint\nstatement of Sen. Hatch and Sen. Kennedy on RLUIPA)\n(“Whether from indifference, ignorance, bigotry, or lack of\nresources, some institutions restrict religious liberty in\n\n——————\n   5 I agree with the majority’s conclusion that, because Section 3 of\n\nRLUIPA, addressing the rights of institutionalized persons, is not a\n“provisio[n] of [a] . . . Federal statute prohibiting discrimination” within\nthe meaning of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 42 U. S. C.\n§2000d–7(a)(1), the latter statute’s waiver provision does not put the\nStates on notice that they can be sued for damages under RLUIPA. See\nante, at 12–14. It bears noting, however, that Section 2 of RLUIPA\nexplicitly prohibits discrimination in land use regulation.              See\n§2000cc(b)(2) (“No government shall impose or implement a land use\nregulation that discriminates . . . on the basis of religion or religious\ndenomination”). As a result, the majority’s decision in this case means\nthat some RLUIPA plaintiffs will be able to seek monetary damages\nagainst a State and others will not, even though RLUIPA’s provision of\n“appropriate relief ” applies equally to suits for violations of the terms\nof both Section 2 and Section 3.\n12                    SOSSAMON v. TEXAS\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\negregious and unnecessary ways”); ibid. (“Institutional\nresidents’ rights to practice their faith is at the mercy of\nthose running the institution . . .”). It is difficult to believe\nthat Congress would have devoted such care and effort to\nestablishing significant statutory protections for religious\nexercise and specifically extended those protections to\npersons in state institutions, yet withheld from plaintiffs a\ncrucial tool for securing the rights the statute guarantees.\n   By depriving prisoners of a damages remedy for viola\ntions of their statutory rights, the majority ensures that\nplaintiffs suing state defendants under RLUIPA will be\nforced to seek enforcement of those rights with one hand\ntied behind their backs. Most obviously, the majority’s\ncategorical denial of monetary relief means that a plaintiff\nwho prevails on the merits of his claim that a State has\nsubstantially burdened his religious exercise will often be\ndenied redress for the injury he has suffered, because in\nmany instances “prospective relief accords . . . no remedy\nat all.” Franklin, 503 U. S., at 76; see H. R. Rep. No. 102–\n40, pt. 2, p. 25 (1991) (Report of Committee on the Judici\nary on the Civil Rights Act of 1991) (“The limitation of\nrelief under Title VII to equitable remedies often means\nthat victims . . . may not recover for the very real effects of\nthe [statutory violation]”). Injunctive relief from a federal\ncourt may address a violation going forward, but this\nfact will be of cold comfort to the victims of serious, non\nrecurring violations for which equitable relief may be\ninappropriate.\n   In addition, the unavailability of monetary relief will\neffectively shield unlawful policies and practices from\njudicial review in many cases. Under state law, discretion\nto transfer prisoners “in a wide variety of circumstances is\nvested in prison officials.” Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S.\n215, 227 (1976). A number of RLUIPA suits seeking in\njunctive relief have been dismissed as moot because the\nplaintiff was transferred from the institution where the\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

Caruso, 605 F. 3d 282, 287, 289\n(CA6 2010); Simmons v. Herrera, No. C 09–0318 JSW\n(PR), 2010 WL 1233815, *3 (ND Cal., Mar. 26, 2010); see\ngenerally Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as\nAmici Curiae 8–11. Absent a damages remedy, longstand\ning RLUIPA challenges may well be dismissed for lack of a\ncase or controversy conferring Article III jurisdiction on\nthe federal court. Cf. Moussazadeh v. Texas Dept. of Crim.\nJustice, Civ. Action No. G–07–574, 2009 WL 819497, *9\n(SD Tex., Mar. 26, 2009) (dismissing as moot plaintiff’s\nRLUIPA claim because he had been transferred to a facil\nity that provided kosher food), remanded, 364 Fed. Appx.\n110 (CA5 2010); Opening Brief for Plaintiff-Appellant in\nMoussazadeh v. Texas Dept. of Crim. Justice, No. 09–\n40400 (CA5), p. 11 (noting that transfer to a special facil\nity took place 19 months after the plaintiff filed suit and\njust before discovery—which had been stayed 12 months\nfor negotiation—was scheduled to recommence). Or, as\nhappened in this case, officials may change the policy\nwhile litigation is pending. The fact of “voluntary cessa\ntion” may allow some of these claims to go forward, but\nmany will nonetheless be dismissed as moot (as happened\nin this case).6\n——————\n  6 See Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist.\n\nNo. 1, 551 U. S. 701, 719 (2007) (“Voluntary cessation does not moot a\ncase or controversy unless subsequent events make it absolutely clear\nthat the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected\nto recur” (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)). The\nFifth Circuit declined to apply the “voluntary cessation” doctrine in this\ncase and instead granted Texas’s motion that the court dismiss as moot\npetitioner’s claim for injunctive relief with respect to the prison’s cell\nrestriction policy. Because the prison director averred that the policy\nwas no longer in force, and “absent evidence that the voluntary ces\nsation [wa]s a sham,” the court held that the “good faith nature” of\nTexas’s change in policy rendered moot petitioner’s claim for injunctive\nrelief. See 560 F. 3d, at 324–326; see also Nelson v. Miller, 570 F. 3d\n14                     SOSSAMON v. TEXAS\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   Of course, under the rule the majority announces, Con\ngress can revise RLUIPA to provide specifically for mone\ntary relief against the States, perhaps by inserting the\nphrase “including monetary relief” into the text of\n§2000cc–2(a). But we have never demanded that a waiver\nbe presented in a particular formulation to be effective; we\nonly require that it be clear. See, e.g., Edelman v. Jordan,\n415 U. S. 651, 673 (1974) (holding that waiver may be\nfound in “express language” or by “overwhelming implica\ntions from the text” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nIn holding to the contrary, the majority erects a formalis\ntic barrier to the vindication of statutory rights deliber\nately provided for by Congress.\n   More problematically, because there is no apparent\nreason why the term “appropriate relief” is sufficiently\nclear as to equitable relief but not as to monetary relief,\nwe are left with the very real possibility that, in order to\nsecure a waiver of immunity under the majority’s new\nrule, Congress must now itemize in the statutory text\nevery type of relief meant to be available against sovereign\ndefendants. I, for one, do not relish the prospect of federal\ncourts being presented with endless state challenges to all\nmanner of federal statutes, on the ground that Congress\nfailed to predict that a laundry list of terms must be in\ncluded to waive sovereign immunity to all forms of relief.\nI would avoid the problems the majority’s decision invites\nand hold instead that, as is the case here, when a general\nstatutory term like “appropriate relief” is used, clear no\ntice has been provided and a State’s acceptance of federal\nfunds constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity to all\nrelief, equitable and monetary.\n\n——————\n868, 882–883 (CA7 2009) (affirming the District Court’s dismissal as\nmoot of a RLUIPA claim because there was no evidence that the prison\nintended to revoke the plaintiff ’s religious diet); El v.
