TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 09–846.      Argued November 1, 2010—Decided April 26, 2011\nRespondent Tohono O’odham Nation (Nation) filed suit in Federal Dis\n  trict Court against federal officials who managed tribal assets held in\n  trust by the Federal Government, alleging violations of fiduciary duty\n  and requesting equitable relief. The next day, the Nation filed this\n  action against the United States in the Court of Federal Claims\n  (CFC), alleging almost identical violations and requesting money\n  damages. The CFC case was dismissed under 28 U. S. C. §1500,\n  which bars CFC jurisdiction over a claim if the plaintiff has another\n  suit “for or in respect to” that claim pending against the United\n  States or its agents in another court. The Federal Circuit reversed,\n  finding that the two suits were not for or in respect to the same claim\n  because, although they shared operative facts, they did not seek over\n  lapping relief.\nHeld:\n    1. Two suits are for or in respect to the same claim, precluding CFC\n jurisdiction, if they are based on substantially the same operative\n facts, regardless of the relief sought in each suit. Pp. 2–9.\n       (a) Since 1868, Congress has restricted the jurisdiction of the\n CFC and its predecessors when related actions are pending else\n where. Keene Corp. v. United States, 508 U. S. 200, 212, held that\n two suits are for or in respect to the same claim when they are “based\n on substantially the same operative facts . . . , at least if there [is]\n some overlap in the relief requested,” but it reserved the question\n whether the jurisdictional bar operates if suits based on the same op\n erative facts do not seek overlapping relief. The rule now codified in\n §1500 was first enacted to curb duplicate lawsuits by residents of the\n Confederacy who, in seeking to recover for cotton taken by the Fed\n eral Government, sued the Government in the Court of Claims and,\n2          UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    at the same time, sued federal officials in other courts, seeking tort\n    relief for the same actions. Section 1500’s robust response to this\n    problem bars CFC jurisdiction not only if the plaintiff sues on an\n    identical claim elsewhere, but also if the other action is related but\n    not identical. The phrase “in respect to” does not resolve all doubt as\n    to the bar’s scope, but it suggests a broad prohibition, regardless of\n    whether “claim” carries a special or limited meaning. Pp. 2–4.\n         (b) Keene permits two constructions of “for or in respect to” the\n    same claim, one based on facts alone and the other on factual plus\n    remedial overlap. The former is the more reasonable interpretation\n    in light of the statute’s use of a similar phrase in a way consistent\n    only with factual overlap. The CFC bar applies where the other ac\n    tion is against a “person who, . . . when the cause of action . . . arose,\n    was, in respect thereto, acting” under color of federal law. But at the\n    time that a cause of action arose, the person could not act in respect\n    to the relief requested, for no complaint was yet filed. Although the\n    phrase at issue involves a “claim” rather than a cause of action, there\n    is reason to think that both phrases refer to facts alone and not to re\n    lief. As Keene explained, “ ‘claim’ is used here synonymously with\n    ‘cause of action,’ ” 508 U. S., at 210. And if the phrase that uses\n    “cause of action,” the more technical term, does not embrace the con\n    cept of remedy, it is reasonable to conclude that neither phrase does.\n    Pp. 4–5.\n         (c) This reading also makes sense in light of the CFC’s unique\n    remedial powers. Because the CFC is the only judicial forum for\n    most nontort requests for significant monetary relief against the\n    United States and because it has no general power to provide equita\n    ble relief against the Government or its officers, a statute aimed at\n    precluding duplicate CFC suits would be unlikely to require remedial\n    overlap. Remedial overlap was even more unusual when §1500’s rule\n    was first enacted in 1868. The Federal Circuit could identify no pur\n    pose the statute served in light of that court’s precedent. But courts\n    should not render statutes nugatory through construction. The stat\n    ute’s purpose is clear from its origins—the need to save the Govern\n    ment from redundant litigation—and the conclusion that two suits\n    are for or in respect to the same claim when they share substantially\n    the same operative facts allows the statute to achieve that aim. Con\n    centrating on operative facts is also consistent with the doctrine of\n    claim preclusion, or res judicata. The Nation errs in arguing that\n    this Court’s interpretation unjustly forces plaintiffs to choose be\n    tween partial remedies available in different courts. The Nation\n    could have recovered any losses in the CFC alone. Even if some\n    hardship were shown, this Court “enjoy[s] no ‘liberty to add an excep\n    tion . . . to remove apparent hardship.’ ” Keene, supra, at 217–218.\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

The substantial overlap in operative facts between the Nation’s\n  District Court and CFC suits precludes jurisdiction in the CFC.

TOHONO O’ODHAM\n                   NATION\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [April 26, 2011] \n\n\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Tohono O’odham Nation is an Indian Tribe with\nfederal recognition. The Nation’s main reservation is in\nthe Sonoran desert of southern Arizona. Counting this\nand other reservation lands, the Nation’s landholdings are\napproximately 3 million acres.\n  The Nation brought two actions based on the same\nalleged violations of fiduciary duty with respect to the\nNation’s lands and other assets. One action was filed\nagainst federal officials in district court and the other\nagainst the United States in the Court of Federal Claims\n(CFC). The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held\nthat the CFC suit was not barred by the rule that the CFC\nlacks jurisdiction over an action “for or in respect to” a\nclaim that is also the subject of an action pending in an\nother court. 28 U. S. C. §1500. The question presented is\nwhether a common factual basis like the one apparent in\nthe Nation’s suits suffices to bar jurisdiction under §1500.\n                             I\n  The case turns on the relationship between the two suits\nthe Nation filed. The first suit was filed in the United\n2       UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStates District Court for the District of Columbia against\nfederal officials responsible for managing tribal assets\nheld in trust by the Federal Government. The complaint\nalleged various violations of fiduciary duty with respect to\nthose assets. The Nation claimed, for example, that the\nofficials failed to provide an accurate accounting of trust\nproperty; to refrain from self-dealing; or to use reasonable\nskill in investing trust assets. The complaint requested\nequitable relief, including an accounting.\n  The next day the Nation filed the instant action against\nthe United States in the CFC. The CFC complaint de\nscribed the same trust assets and the same fiduciary\nduties that were the subject of the District Court com\nplaint. And it alleged almost identical violations of fiduci\nary duty, for which it requested money damages. The CFC\ncase was dismissed under §1500 for want of jurisdiction.\n  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit reversed. 559 F. 3d 1284 (2009). Two suits are for\nor in respect to the same claim, it reasoned, only if they\nshare operative facts and also seek overlapping relief.\nFinding no overlap in the relief requested, the court held\nthat the two suits at issue were not for or in respect to the\nsame claim.\n  This Court granted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                              II\n  Since 1868, Congress has restricted the jurisdiction of\nthe CFC and its predecessors when related actions are\npending elsewhere. Section 1500, identical in most re\nspects to the original statute, provides:\n      “The United States Court of Federal Claims shall\n    not have jurisdiction of any claim for or in respect to\n    which the plaintiff or his assignee has pending in any\n    other court any suit or process against the United\n    States or any person who, at the time when the cause\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    of action alleged in such suit or process arose, was, in\n    respect thereto, acting or professing to act, directly or\n    indirectly under the authority of the United States.”\nThe rule is more straightforward than its complex wording\nsuggests. The CFC has no jurisdiction over a claim if the\nplaintiff has another suit for or in respect to that claim\npending against the United States or its agents.\n   The question to be resolved is what it means for two\nsuits to be “for or in respect to” the same claim. Keene\nCorp. v. United States, 508 U. S. 200 (1993), provided a\npartial answer. It held that two suits are for or in respect\nto the same claim when they are “based on substantially\nthe same operative facts . . . , at least if there [is] some\noverlap in the relief requested.” Id., at 212. The Keene\ncase did not decide whether the jurisdictional bar also\noperates if the suits are based on the same operative facts\nbut do not seek overlapping relief. Still, Keene narrows\nthe permissible constructions of “for or in respect to” a\nclaim to one of two interpretations. Either it requires\nsubstantial factual and some remedial overlap, or it re\nquires substantial factual overlap without more.\n   Congress first enacted the jurisdictional bar now codi\nfied in §1500 to curb duplicate lawsuits brought by resi\ndents of the Confederacy following the Civil War. The\nso-called “cotton claimants”—named for their suits to\nrecover for cotton taken by the Federal Government—sued\nthe United States in the Court of Claims under the Aban\ndoned Property Collection Act, 12 Stat. 820, while at the\nsame time suing federal officials in other courts, seeking\nrelief under tort law for the same alleged actions. See\nKeene, supra, at 206–207; Schwartz, Section 1500 of the\nJudicial Code and Duplicate Suits Against the Govern\nment and Its Agents, 55 Geo. L. J. 573, 574–580 (1967).\nAlthough the rule embodied in §1500 originated long ago,\nCongress reenacted the statute at various times, most\n4       UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrecently in 1948. See Act of June 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 942;\nKeene, 508 U. S., at 206–207.\n   The text of §1500 reflects a robust response to the prob\nlem first presented by the cotton claimants. It bars juris\ndiction in the CFC not only if the plaintiff sues on an\nidentical claim elsewhere—a suit “for” the same claim—\nbut also if the plaintiff’s other action is related although\nnot identical—a suit “in respect to” the same claim. The\nphrase “in respect to” does not resolve all doubt as to the\nscope of the jurisdictional bar, but “it does make it clear\nthat Congress did not intend the statute to be rendered\nuseless by a narrow concept of identity.” Id., at 213. It\nsuggests a broad prohibition, regardless of whether\n“claim” carries a special or limited meaning. Cf. United\nStates v. Jones, 131 U. S. 1 (1889) (“claim” in the Little\nTucker Act refers only to requests for money).\n   Of the two constructions of “for or in respect to” the\nsame claim that Keene permits—one based on facts alone\nand the other on factual plus remedial overlap—the for\nmer is the more reasonable interpretation in light of the\nstatute’s use of a similar phrase in a way consistent only\nwith factual overlap. The CFC bar applies even where the\nother action is not against the Government but instead\nagainst a “person who, at the time when the cause of\naction alleged in such suit or process arose, was, in respect\nthereto, acting or professing to act, directly or indirectly\nunder the authority of the United States.” The statute\nrefers to a person who acts under color of federal law in\nrespect to a cause of action at the time it arose. But at\nthat time, the person could not act in respect to the relief\nrequested, for no complaint was yet filed. This use of the\nphrase “in respect to a cause of action” must refer to op\nerative facts and not whatever remedies an aggrieved\nparty might later request. A person acts under color of\nfederal law in respect to a cause of action by claiming or\nwielding federal authority in the relevant factual context.\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Although the two phrases are not identical—one is in\nrespect to a claim, the other a cause of action—they are\nalmost so, and there is reason to think that both phrases\nrefer to facts alone and not to relief. As the Keene Court\nexplained, “the term ‘claim’ is used here synonymously\nwith ‘cause of action.’ ” 508 U. S., at 210. And if either of\nthe two phrases were to include both operative facts and a\nspecific remedy, it would be the one that uses the term\n“cause of action” rather than “claim.” “Cause of action” is\nthe more technical term, while “claim” is often used in a\ncommonsense way to mean a right or demand. Here, for\nthe reasons stated in the preceding paragraph, “in respect\nto a cause of action” refers simply to facts without regard\nto judicial remedies. So, if the phrase with the more tech\nnical of the two terms does not embrace the concept of\nremedy, it is reasonable to conclude that neither phrase\ndoes. Even if the terms “claim” or “cause of action” include\nthe request for relief, the phrase “for or in respect to” gives\nthe statutory bar a broader scope.\n  Reading the statute to require only factual and not also\nremedial overlap makes sense in light of the unique reme\ndial powers of the CFC. The CFC is the only judicial\nforum for most non-tort requests for significant monetary\nrelief against the United States. See 28 U. S. C. §1491\n(2006 ed. and Supp. III); §1346(a)(2) (2006 ed.). Unlike\nthe district courts, however, the CFC has no general power\nto provide equitable relief against the Government or its\nofficers. Compare United States v. King, 395 U. S. 1, 2–3\n(1969), with 5 U. S. C. §702; see also United States v.\nAlire, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87957\"><a href=\"/opinion/87957/united-states-v-alire/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 575 (1868) (“[T]he only judgments\nwhich the Court of Claims are authorized to render\nagainst the government . . . are judgments for money\nfound due from the government to the petitioner”). The\ndistinct jurisdiction of the CFC makes overlapping relief\nthe exception and distinct relief the norm. For that rea\nson, a statute aimed at precluding suits in the CFC that\n6       UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nduplicate suits elsewhere would be unlikely to require\nremedial overlap.\n  Remedial overlap between CFC actions and those in\nother courts was even more unusual when §1500’s rule\nwas first enacted in 1868. At that time the CFC had a\nmore limited jurisdiction than it does now, for the Tucker\nAct’s general waiver of sovereign immunity for non-tort\nclaims for monetary relief had not yet been enacted. See\n24 Stat. 505. And while the district courts can today\nadjudicate suits against the United States for money\ndamages under the Little Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C.\n§1346(a)(2), and the Federal Tort Claims Act §1346(b), in\n1868 the United States could only be sued in the Court of\nClaims. United States v. Mitchell, 463 U. S. 206, 212–214\n(1983); G. Sisk, Litigation with the Federal Government\n§4.02(a)(1) (4th ed. 2006). Because the kinds of suits and\nforms of relief available against the United States were\nfew and constrained, remedial overlap between CFC suits\nand those in other courts was even less common then than\nnow. If the statute were to require remedial as well as\nfactual overlap, it would have had very limited application\nin 1868 despite its broad language that bars not only\nidentical but also related claims. The rule in §1500 effects\na significant jurisdictional limitation, and Congress reen\nacted it even as changes in the structure of the courts\nmade suits on the same facts more likely to arise. Doing\nso reaffirmed the force of the bar and thus the commit\nment to curtailing redundant litigation.\n  The panel of the Court of Appeals could not identify\n“any purpose that §1500 serves today,” 559 F. 3d, at 1292,\nin large part because it was bound by Circuit precedent\nthat left the statute without meaningful force. For exam\nple, the panel cited Tecon Engineers, Inc. v. United States,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ct. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 343 F. 2d 943 (1965), which held that\n§1500 does not prohibit two identical suits from proceed\ning so long as the action in the CFC, or at that time the\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt of Claims, is filed first. The Tecon holding is not\npresented in this case because the CFC action here was\nfiled after the District Court suit.\n   Still, the Court of Appeals was wrong to allow its prece\ndent to suppress the statute’s aims. Courts should not\nrender statutes nugatory through construction. In fact the\nstatute’s purpose is clear from its origins with the cotton\nclaimants—the need to save the Government from bur\ndens of redundant litigation—and that purpose is no less\nsignificant today. The conclusion that two suits are for or\nin respect to the same claim when they are based on sub\nstantially the same operative facts allows the statute to\nachieve its aim. Keene, supra, at 206. Developing a fac\ntual record is responsible for much of the cost of litigation.\nDiscovery is a conspicuous example, and the preparation\nand examination of witnesses at trial is another. The form\nof relief requested matters less, except insofar as it affects\nwhat facts parties must prove. An interpretation of §1500\nfocused on the facts rather than the relief a party seeks\npreserves the provision as it was meant to function, and it\nkeeps the provision from becoming a mere pleading rule,\nto be circumvented by carving up a single transaction into\noverlapping pieces seeking different relief. Cf. Casman v.\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ct. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">647</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1956) (CFC had jurisdiction\nnotwithstanding common facts in district court suit be\ncause the plaintiff sought different relief in each forum).\n   Concentrating on operative facts is also consistent with\nthe doctrine of claim preclusion, or res judicata, which\nbars “repetitious suits involving the same cause of action”\nonce “a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a final\njudgment on the merits.” Commissioner v. Sunnen, 333\nU. S. 591, 597 (1948). The jurisdictional bar in §1500 was\nenacted in part to address the problem that judgments in\nsuits against officers were not preclusive in suits against\nthe United States. Matson Nav. Co. v. United States, 284\nU. S. 352, 355–356 (1932). So it is no surprise that the\n8       UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute would operate in similar fashion. The now\naccepted test in preclusion law for determining whether\ntwo suits involve the same claim or cause of action de\npends on factual overlap, barring “claims arising from the\nsame transaction.” Kremer v. Chemical Constr. Corp., 456\nU. S. 461, 482, n. 22 (1982); see also Restatement (Second)\nof Judgments §24 (1980). The transactional test is of\ncourse much younger than the rule embodied in §1500, but\neven in the 19th century it was not uncommon to identify\na claim for preclusion purposes based on facts rather than\nrelief. See J. Wells, Res Adjudicata and Stare Decisis\n§241, p. 208 (1878) (“The true distinction between de\nmands or rights of action which are single and entire, and\nthose which are several and distinct, is, that the former\nimmediately arise out of one and the same act or contract,\nand the latter out of different acts or contracts” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)); 2 H. Black, Law of Judgments\n§726, p. 866 (1891) (The test for identity is: “Would the\nsame evidence support and establish both the present and\nthe former cause of action?”). Reading §1500 to depend on\nthe underlying facts and not also on the relief requested\ngives effect to the principles of preclusion law embodied in\nthe statute.\n  There is no merit to the Nation’s assertion that the\ninterpretation adopted here cannot prevail because it is\nunjust, forcing plaintiffs to choose between partial reme\ndies available in different courts. The hardship in this\ncase is far from clear. The Nation could have filed in the\nCFC alone and if successful obtained monetary relief to\ncompensate for any losses caused by the Government’s\nbreach of duty. It also seems likely that Indian tribes in\nthe Nation’s position could go to district court first without\nlosing the chance to later file in the CFC, for Congress has\nprovided in every appropriations Act for the Department\nof Interior since 1990 that the statute of limitations on\nIndian trust mismanagement claims shall not run until\n                  Cite as: 563 U.

See, e.g., 123 Stat. 2922; 104 Stat. 1930.\n  Even were some hardship to be shown, considerations of\npolicy divorced from the statute’s text and purpose could\nnot override its meaning. Although Congress has permit\nted claims against the United States for monetary relief in\nthe CFC, that relief is available by grace and not by right.\nSee Beers v. Arkansas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87177\"><a href=\"/opinion/87177/beers-v-arkansas/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 529 (1858) (“[A]s this\npermission is altogether voluntary on the part of the\nsovereignty, it follows that it may prescribe the terms and\nconditions on which it consents to be sued, and the man\nner in which the suit shall be conducted”). If indeed the\nstatute leads to incomplete relief, and if plaintiffs like the\nNation are dissatisfied, they are free to direct their com\nplaints to Congress. This Court “enjoy[s] no ‘liberty to add\nan exception . . . to remove apparent hardship.’ ” Keene,\n508 U. S., at 217–218 (quoting Corona Coal Co. v. United\nStates, 263 U. S. 537, 540 (1924)).\n  Keene reserved the question whether common facts are\nsufficient to bar a CFC action where a similar case is\npending elsewhere. To continue to reserve the question\nwould force the CFC to engage in an unnecessary and\ncomplicated remedial inquiry, and it would increase the\nexpense and duration of litigation. The question thus\ndemands an answer, and the answer is yes. Two suits are\nfor or in respect to the same claim, precluding jurisdiction\nin the CFC, if they are based on substantially the same\noperative facts, regardless of the relief sought in each suit.\n                              III\n   The remaining question is whether the Nation’s two\nsuits have sufficient factual overlap to trigger the jurisdic\ntional bar. The CFC dismissed the action here in part\nbecause it concluded that the facts in the Nation’s two\nsuits were, “for all practical purposes, identical.” 79 Fed.\nCl. 645, 656 (2007). It was correct to do so.\n10      UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The two actions both allege that the United States holds\nthe same assets in trust for the Nation’s benefit. They\ndescribe almost identical breaches of fiduciary duty—that\nthe United States engaged in self-dealing and imprudent\ninvestment, and failed to provide an accurate accounting\nof the assets held in trust, for example. Indeed, it appears\nthat the Nation could have filed two identical complaints,\nsave the caption and prayer for relief, without changing\neither suit in any significant respect.\n   Under §1500, the substantial overlap in operative facts\nbetween the Nation’s District Court and CFC suits pre\ncludes jurisdiction in the CFC. The Court of Appeals erred\nwhen it concluded otherwise.\n                               IV\n   The holding here precludes the CFC from exercising\njurisdiction over the Nation’s suit while the District Court\ncase is pending. Should the Nation choose to dismiss the\nlatter action, or upon that action’s completion, the Nation\nis free to file suit again in the CFC if the statute of limita\ntions is no bar. In the meantime, and in light of the sub\nstantial overlap in operative facts between them, the two\nsuits are “for or in respect to” the same claim under §1500,\nand the CFC case must be dismissed. The contrary judg\nment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                               It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

S. C. §1500 to put an end to parallel litigation seeking\nduplicative relief against the United States and its agents.\nRespondent Tohono O’odham Nation seeks in the Court of\nFederal Claims (CFC) some of the same relief on the same\nfacts as it does in its pending District Court action. Ac\ncordingly, applying our decision in Keene Corp. v. United\nStates, 508 U. S. 200 (1993), I agree with the Court that\n§1500 bars the Nation’s CFC action. Because the Nation’s\ntwo actions seek overlapping relief, this case does not\npresent the question that the Court decides today—\nwhether §1500 bars an action in the CFC when the plain\ntiff’s actions share a common factual basis but seek differ\nent forms of relief. Nonetheless, the Court holds that a\ncommon factual basis alone suffices to bar jurisdiction in\nthe CFC. Under the Court’s reading of the statute, a\nplaintiff cannot pursue a claim in the CFC based on the\nsame facts as another pending action, even when Congress\nhas required that plaintiff to file separate actions in two\ncourts to obtain different forms of relief necessary to make\nthe plaintiff whole. I cannot agree that §1500 demands\nthis result.\n2           UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION \n\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\n                                I\n\n   Section 1500 bars jurisdiction in the CFC over “any\nclaim for or in respect to which the plaintiff . . . has pend\ning in any other court any suit or process against the\nUnited States” or any agent of the United States. In\nKeene, we construed this statute to “turn on whether the\nplaintiff’s other suit was based on substantially the same\noperative facts as the Court of Claims action, at least if\nthere was some overlap in the relief requested.” Id., at\n212. It was irrelevant for purposes of §1500, we observed,\nthat the two suits proceeded on different legal theories.\nId., at 212. Because the plaintiff’s actions both sought the\nsame monetary relief, albeit on different theories, we held\nthat the CFC lacked jurisdiction. Id., at 217–218. We\nthus found “it unnecessary to consider” whether §1500\nbarred a CFC claim that was based on substantially the\nsame operative facts as another suit but that sought dif\nferent relief. See id., at 212, n. 6, 216.\n   As construed in Keene, §1500 bars the Nation’s CFC\naction. As the majority holds, see ante, at 9–10, the Na\ntion’s CFC and District Court actions are based on nearly\nidentical facts. The two actions also seek overlapping\nrelief: Both complaints request money to remedy the same\ninjury—the Government’s alleged breach of its fiduciary\nduty to maintain accurate accounts of the Nation’s assets.\nThe Nation does not dispute that its District Court com\nplaint requests such relief.1 See Brief for Respondent 51\n(“If . . . the accounting reveals that assets that belong to\nthe Nation do not appear on the books, it may be appro\npriate to order equitable restitution of those assets”). The\nNation’s CFC complaint is fairly read to do the same. The\n——————\n    1 The\n       majority characterizes the Nation’s District Court complaint as\nseeking “equitable relief,” ante, at 2, but does not mention that the\ncomplaint seeks, among other things, equitable monetary relief such as\ndisgorgement and restitution, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 91a.\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                   3\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nCFC complaint alleges that the Government has failed\n“to keep and render clear and accurate accounts.” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 66a. It claims that by reason of this and\nother alleged breaches of fiduciary duty, the Nation “has\nbeen damaged in such amounts as may be proven at trial.”\nId., at 67a. And the complaint requests “a determination\nthat the Defendant is liable to the Nation in damages for\nthe injuries and losses caused as a result of Defendant’s\nbreaches of fiduciary duty” and a “determination of the\namount of damages due the Nation.” Id., at 72a–73a.\nThus, just like the District Court complaint, the CFC\ncomplaint requests money to remedy the Government’s\nalleged failure to keep accurate accounts.2\n  Because the Nation’s two complaints are “based on\nsubstantially the same operative facts” and there is “at\nleast . . . some overlap in the relief requested,” Keene, 508\nU. S., at 212, §1500 bars jurisdiction over the Nation’s\nCFC action.\n                             II\n  The case does not present the question, left open in\nKeene, “whether common facts [alone] are sufficient to bar\na CFC action where a similar case is pending elsewhere.”\nAnte, at 9. Indeed, for most of the history of this case, the\nGovernment did not even argue that common facts were\nsufficient to preclude CFC jurisdiction; until its petition\nfor rehearing in the Court of Appeals, the Government\n——————\n   2 In reaching the opposite conclusion, the Court of Appeals relied on\n\nthe fact that the Nation’s District Court complaint seeks equitable\nrelief whereas its CFC complaint seeks damages. See 559 F. 3d 1284,\n1288–1289 (CA Fed. 2009). Keene makes clear, however, that actions\nbased on substantially the same operative facts implicate §1500 so long\nas they seek overlapping relief. See Keene Corp. v. United States, 508\nU. S. 200, 212 (1993). The formal label affixed to the form of relief\nsought is irrelevant. In this case, both the Nation’s CFC complaint and\nits District Court complaint seek money to remedy the Government’s\nalleged failure to keep accurate accounts.\n4           UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION\n\n                 SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nargued only that Keene required dismissal of the Nation’s\nCFC action because the Nation’s two actions were based\non the same facts and sought overlapping relief. Deciding\nthis case on the basis of Keene would have been the “far\nmore prudent course than recharacterizing the case in an\nattempt to reach premature decision on an important\nquestion.” Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U. S. 33, 80 (1990)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg\nment). Instead, discarding the restraint we exhibited in\nKeene, the Court unnecessarily chooses to hold that §1500\nbars jurisdiction in the CFC whenever a plaintiff’s CFC\naction is based on substantially the same facts as a suit\npending elsewhere.3 This reading of §1500 is, in my opin\nion, incorrect.\n                               A\n  Since the enactment of §1500 in 1868, Congress has\nexpanded the avenues by which persons with legitimate\nclaims against the United States may obtain relief. See\nante, at 6. In some circumstances, Congress has chosen to\nrequire plaintiffs to file actions in two different courts to\nobtain complete relief relating to a single set of operative\nfacts. For example, with some exceptions, the CFC has no\npower to issue equitable relief. See Bowen v. Massachu\n——————\n    3 Themajority does not contend that the facts of this case require it to\ndecide this question. It justifies its decision to reach the question on\nthe ground that its rule would eliminate “an unnecessary and compli\ncated remedial inquiry” and would decrease “the expense and duration\nof litigation.” Ante, at 9. It provides no reason to believe, however, that\ninquiry into relief requested is unduly complicated in the vast majority\nof cases. Cf. Loveladies Harbor, Inc. v. United States, 27 F. 3d 1545,\n1552 (CA Fed. 1994) (en banc) (“The principles of Casman [v.

More importantly, the majority does not explain why the\nbenefits it perceives to result from deciding this question today out\nweigh the potential for its reading of the statute to leave some plaintiffs\nwith incomplete recompense for their injuries.

As a result, a plaintiff seeking both money\ndamages and injunctive relief to remedy distinct harms\narising from the same set of facts may be forced to file\nactions in both the CFC and federal district court.\n  For half a century, the CFC has recognized that §1500\ndoes not preclude jurisdiction in that court when Congress\nhas required a plaintiff to split a claim into two actions to\nobtain different forms of relief necessary to make the\nplaintiff whole. In Casman v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ct. Cl.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">647</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1956), a terminated federal employee sought backpay\nin the Court of Claims and reinstatement to his position in\nDistrict Court. The plaintiff’s two suits arose from the\nsame facts (his termination) but sought “entirely different”\nforms of relief within the exclusive jurisdiction of two\ncourts.4 Id., at 650. In light of our previous recognition\nthat the purpose of §1500 “ ‘was only to require an election\nbetween a suit in the Court of Claims and one brought in\nanother court,’ ” id., at 649 (quoting Matson Nav. Co. v.\nUnited States, 284 U. S. 352, 355–356 (1932)), the Court of\nClaims held that §1500 was inapplicable when a “plaintiff\nhas no right to elect between two courts,” 135 Ct. Cl., at\n650. To hold otherwise, the court acknowledged, “would\nbe to say to plaintiff, ‘If you want your job back you must\nforget your back pay’; conversely, ‘If you want your back\npay, you cannot have your job back.’ ” Ibid.; see also Love\nladies Harbor, Inc. v. United States, 27 F. 3d 1545, 1551\n(CA Fed. 1994) (en banc) (reaffirming Casman’s inquiry\ninto the form of relief sought).\n  By reserving the question “whether two actions based on\n——————\n  4 Congress has since enacted legislation to permit plaintiffs in Cas\n\nman’s situation to obtain complete relief in the CFC. See Act of Aug.\n29, 1972, §1, 86 Stat. 652, 28 U. S. C. §1491(a)(2) (permitting the CFC\nto “issue orders directing restoration to office or position, placement in\nappropriate duty or retirement status, and correction of applicable\nrecords”).\n6        UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe same operative facts, but seeking completely different\nrelief, would implicate §1500,” our decision in Keene ex\npressly preserved the Casman holding. 508 U. S., at 212,\nn. 6. The consequence of today’s decision is clear: The\nCasman rule is no longer good law. Under the majority’s\nreading of §1500, because Casman’s two suits were based\non common facts, §1500 barred jurisdiction in the CFC\nover his backpay claim even though he could not have\nobtained backpay in his District Court action.\n  The jurisdictional scheme governing actions against the\nUnited States often requires other plaintiffs to file two\nactions in different courts to obtain complete relief in\nconnection with one set of facts. As just one example, an\naction seeking injunctive relief to set aside agency action\nmust proceed in district court, but a claim that the same\nagency action constitutes a taking of property requiring\njust compensation must proceed in the CFC. See, e.g.,\nAlaska v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995). After\ntoday’s decision, §1500 may well prevent a plaintiff from\npursuing a takings claim in the CFC if an action to set\naside the agency action is pending in district court. This\ntype of plaintiff may face a choice between equally unat\ntractive options: forgo injunctive relief in the district court\nto preserve her claim for monetary relief in the CFC, or\npursue injunctive relief and hope that the statute of limi\ntations on her takings claim, see 28 U. S. C. §2501, does\nnot expire before the district court action is resolved.5\n——————\n   5 The majority apparently doubts that its holding puts the Nation to a\n\nsimilarly difficult choice. It first suggests that the Nation could file\nsolely in the CFC to obtain damages for the Government’s alleged\nbreaches of fiduciary duty. See ante, at 8. The Nation could indeed\nchoose to file only in the CFC—just as any plaintiff could choose to\nforgo injunctive relief to pursue money damages in the CFC—but the\nNation believes it is entitled to more than monetary relief. The Na\ntion’s District Court action seeks an equitable accounting to remedy the\nsame breaches of fiduciary duty, and the CFC has held that it lacks\njurisdiction to issue a preliability accounting. See Klamath and Modoc\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

The statute bars jurisdiction in the CFC over\na “claim for or in respect to which” a plaintiff has a suit or\nprocess pending elsewhere. When Congress first enacted\n§1500’s predecessor, the statute establishing the jurisdic\ntion of the Court of Claims used the term “claims” to refer\nto demands for money damages. See Act of Mar. 3, 1863,\n§§2–3, 12 Stat. 765; see United States v. Jones, 131 U. S.\n1, 17 (1889) (noting that the statute’s provisions “were\ninconsistent with the enforcement of any claims under the\nlaw except claims for money”).6 Congress thus would have\n——————\nTribes v.

United States, 582 F. 3d 1306, 1308\n(CA Fed. 2009) (suggesting in dicta that the CFC can order an equita\nble accounting as “ancillary relief” under 28 U. S. C. §§1491(a)(2) and\n(b)(2)), cert. pending, No. 09–1521.\n   The majority next suggests that Congress has tolled the statute of\nlimitations governing the Nation’s CFC claims. See ante, at 8–9. But\nthe cited statute only applies to claims “concerning losses to or mis\nmanagement of trust funds.” 123 Stat. 2922. It does not appear to toll\nthe statute of limitations for claims concerning assets other than funds,\nsuch as tangible assets. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a–69a (seeking\ndamages for the Government’s mismanagement of the Nation’s mineral\nestates). Expiration of the 6-year statute of limitations governing\nclaims in the CFC is a very real prospect in this and other cases; the\nNation’s District Court action has been pending for more than four\nyears.\n   As the majority notes, see ante, at 6–7, the validity of the Court of\nClaims’ holding in Tecon Engineers, Inc. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ct. Cl.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">389</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 343 F. 2d 943 (1965), is not presented in this case. This Court has\nnever considered that holding. Accordingly, I do not consider whether\nthe Nation could have avoided application of §1500 altogether by filing\nits CFC action first.\n   6 Congress has consistently used the term “claim” to refer to a de\n8        UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION\n\n               SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nunderstood the term “claim” in §1500 to describe the\nparticular relief sought in the Court of Claims. Cf. Com\nmissioner v. Keystone Consol. Industries, Inc., 508 U. S.\n152, 159 (1993).\n  Determining the meaning of “claim” is only part of the\ninquiry, however. The question remains what constitutes\na suit or process “for or in respect to” a CFC claim. The\npurpose and history of the statute elucidate the meaning\nof this ambiguous phrase. As the majority explains, Con\ngress enacted the statute to prevent “duplicative lawsuits”\nbrought by the so-called “cotton claimants” in the after\nmath of the Civil War. Keene, 508 U. S., at 206; see ante,\nat 3. The cotton claimants sought monetary compensation\nfor seized cotton in the Court of Claims pursuant to the\nAbandoned Property Collection Act, 12 Stat. 820. Because\nthey had difficulty satisfying the statutory requirement\nthat, to obtain compensation, they must not have given aid\nor comfort to participants in the rebellion, see §3 of the\nAct, they also sought relief—either in the form of money\ndamages or actual cotton—in separate lawsuits against\nfederal officials on tort theories such as conversion. “It\nwas these duplicative lawsuits that induced Congress” to\nenact §1500’s predecessor. Keene, 508 U. S., at 206.\n  This historical backdrop sheds light on what Congress\nwould have understood to be a suit or process “for or in\nrespect to” a “claim” in the Court of Claims. Congress\nundoubtedly intended to preclude a claim for money in the\n\n——————\nmand for money in the context of the CFC. See 28 U. S. C. §1491(a)(1)\n(conferring jurisdiction in the CFC over “any claim against the United\nStates founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress\nor any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or\nimplied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliqui\ndated damages in cases not sounding in tort” (emphasis added)). Of\ncourse, since §1500’s enactment, Congress has authorized the CFC\nto issue relief other than money damages in certain cases. See\n§1491(a)(2).\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

Because, however,\nsome cotton claimants sought return of the cotton itself in\ndistrict court, it was also necessary to preclude jurisdiction\nin the Court of Claims when the plaintiff’s other action\nwas “in respect to” that demand for money—i.e., when the\nplaintiff was seeking duplicative relief. Had the courts\nawarded such plaintiffs both the cotton itself and money\ndamages, the plaintiffs would have obtained twice what\nthey deserved. In this way, Congress eschewed “a narrow\nconcept of identity” that would have permitted plaintiffs to\npursue and obtain duplicative relief to remedy the very\nsame harm. Id., at 213.\n   The legislative history confirms Congress’ intent to\npreclude requests for duplicative relief. The statute’s\nsponsor explained that the purpose of the statute was “to\nput to their election that large class of persons having\ncotton claims[,] . . . who are here at the same time endeav\noring to prosecute their claims, and have filed them in the\nCourt of Claims, so that after they put the Government to\nthe expense of beating them once in a court of law they\ncan turn around and try the whole question in the Court of\nClaims.”7 Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 2d Sess., 2769 (1868)\n(statement of Sen. Edmunds); see also Matson Nav. Co.,\n284 U. S., at 355–356. Congress thus appears to have had\nin mind cases in which “the whole question” could be tried\nin the Court of Claims. The statute’s history does not\nsuggest that Congress intended to require an election\nbetween two nonduplicative forms of relief available ex\nclusively in two different courts. In such a case, “the\nwhole question” could not be tried in either court.\n\n——————\n  7 Because  §1500’s jurisdictional bar applies only when the other suit\nis pending, “there is a good argument that, even when first enacted, the\nstatute did not actually perform the preclusion function emphasized by\nits sponsor.” Keene, 508 U. S., at 217.\n10       UNITED STATES v.

First, the majority rea\nsons that the phrase “claim for or in respect to” must refer\nonly to factual overlap because the statute uses the phrase\n“cause of action . . . in respect thereto” (which the majority\nparaphrases as “in respect to a cause of action”) in a way\nthat is “consistent only with factual overlap.” Ante, at 4.\nThis point rests on a misreading of the statutory text. The\nstatute asks whether a plaintiff has pending a “suit or\nprocess” for or in respect to the plaintiff’s CFC claim—not\nwhether it has pending a “cause of action” for or in respect\nto that claim.8 Even if the term “cause of action” refers\nonly to operative facts—such that the inquiry whether a\nperson was acting under color of federal law in respect to\na cause of action is purely factual in nature—a “suit or\nprocess” will inevitably include a request for relief.\n   Second, the majority states that, “in light of the unique\nremedial powers of the CFC,” requiring remedial overlap\nwould make no sense because it would result in a “very\nlimited application” of the statute. Ante, at 5, 6. Here, the\nmajority overlooks the nearly 150-year history of the\nstatute. It was the cotton claimants’ parallel requests for\nduplicative relief that prompted passage of §1500 in the\nfirst place. Since then, litigants have continued to seek\nduplicative relief against the Government in two courts, as\nKeene and this very case illustrate. See 508 U.

As these cases make clear,\ninterpreting §1500 to prohibit requests for duplicative\nrelief hardly renders the statute of limited application.\n   Third, the majority suggests that its construction of\n§1500 is necessary to achieve the statute’s aim of “sav[ing]\nthe Government from burdens of redundant litigation.”\nAnte, at 7. Parallel actions seeking the same or duplica\ntive relief, or different forms of relief that are available\nentirely in one court, are redundant; actions seeking dif\nferent forms of relief that Congress has made available\nexclusively in different courts are not. To the extent the\nmajority is concerned about the burdens of parallel discov\nery, federal courts have ample tools at their disposal, such\nas stays, to prevent such burdens. See Schwartz, Section\n1500 of the Judicial Code and Duplicate Suits Against the\nGovernment and Its Agents, 55 Geo. L. J. 573, 599 (1967).\n   Finally, the majority contends that focusing on opera\ntive facts is consistent with the principles of claim preclu\nsion embodied in the statute. Claim preclusion ordinarily\n“bar[s] claims arising from the same transaction.” Kremer\nv. Chemical Constr. Corp., 456 U. S. 461, 482, n. 22 (1982).\nThere is, however, an exception to this rule when a plain\ntiff was unable to obtain a certain remedy in the earlier\naction. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments §26(1)(c)\n(1980) (claim preclusion does not apply where “[t]he plain\ntiff was unable to rely on a certain theory of the case or to\n12      UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION\n\n              SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nseek a certain remedy or form of relief in the first action\nbecause of the limitations on the subject matter jurisdic\ntion of the courts”); see also Marrese v. American Academy\nof Orthopaedic Surgeons, 470 U. S. 373, 382 (1985); 18 C.\nWright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and\nProcedure §4412, p. 276 (2d ed. 2002). This principle has\nlong informed claim preclusion law. See, e.g., Restatement\nof Judgments §62, Comment k (1942) (“[W]here a plaintiff\nbrings an action in a State in which the courts have juris\ndiction only with reference to one portion of his cause of\naction, he is not barred from maintaining an action in a\nproper court for the other portion”); 2 H. Black, Law of\nJudgments §618, p. 744 (1891) (“A judgment is not conclu\nsive of any matter which, from the nature of the case, the\nform of action, or the character of the pleadings, could not\nhave been adjudicated in the former suit”). For these\nreasons, preclusion doctrine actually undermines the\nmajority’s position.\n   In sum, the majority offers no coherent justification for\nits conclusion that Congress intended to preclude jurisdic\ntion in the CFC whenever a plaintiff’s claim in that court\nis based on substantially the same facts as a suit pending\nelsewhere without reference to the relief sought.\n                         *     *     *\n   Even before today’s decision, §1500 had been described\nas “anachronistic,” Keene, 508 U.

S. C. §1500 and would affirm the Federal Circuit’s\njudgment.\n  According to the Court, the Court of Federal Claims\n(CFC) lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the Tohono\nO’odham Nation’s (Nation) claim because the Tribe was\nsimultaneously pursuing in the D. C. District Court an\naction with “a common factual basis.” Ante, at 1. It mat\nters not, the Court holds, that to gain complete relief, the\nNation had to launch two suits, for neither of the two\ncourts whose jurisdiction the Tribe invoked could alone\nprovide full redress. See ante, at 8–9.\n  The Court concludes that “claim” or “cause of action,”\nterms the Court considers synonymous as used in §1500,*\n——————\n  * “ ‘Cause of action,’ ” the Court simultaneously states, “is the more\ntechnical term.” Ante, at 5. If “more technical” means more precise,\nclear or certain, the Court is incorrect. See United States v. Memphis\nCotton Oil Co., 288 U. S. 62, 67–68 (1933) (“A ‘cause of action’ may\nmean one thing for one purpose and something different for another.”).\nIn its discourse on the term, the Court has fallen into an old error; the\ndrafters of the Federal Rules endeavored to “eliminate the unfortunate\nrigidity and confusion surrounding the words ‘cause of action.’ ” 5 C.\nWright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure §1216, p. 207 (3d\ned. 2004). Today’s invocation of a supposed particular or exact meaning\nfor the phrase risks reviving that confusion.\n2       UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nsee ante, at 5, refers to “operative facts,” and not to the\nremedies a plaintiff seeks. See ante, at 4. Section 1500\nspeaks of “the time when the cause of action . . . arose,” a\ntime antedating the commencement of suit. The Court\ninfers, therefore, that a “claim” or “cause of action” is\ndiscrete from a pleading’s request for relief. See ante, at 4.\nIn fact, however, entitlement to relief is essential to the\nexistence of a claim or cause of action, which arises when a\nperson suffers a harm capable of judicial redress. See 2 J.\nStory, Equity Jurisprudence §1521a, p. 741 (8th ed. 1861)\n(“[T]he cause of action . . . arises when . . . the party has a\nright to apply to a court . . . for relief.”).\n   A plaintiff may not, §1500 instructs, petition both the\nCFC and a district court, invoking in each a distinct legal\ntheory appropriate to the forum, but seeking redress for a\nsingle injury. When Congress bars a plaintiff from obtain\ning complete relief in one suit, however, and does not call\nfor an election of remedies, Congress is most sensibly read\nto have comprehended that the operative facts give rise to\ntwo discrete claims. Casman v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ct.

There, a discharged federal em\nployee, complaining of wrongful termination, sought rein\nstatement in a district-court action and backpay in the\nCourt of Claims. Section 1500 does not stand in the way,\nthe Court of Claims held in Casman, when the plaintiff\nsuffered two distinct injuries, for which she seeks discrete\nforms of relief within the exclusive competence of different\ncourts. See 135 Ct. Cl., at 649–650 (claim for backpay\n“entirely different” from claim for reinstatement). The\nFederal Circuit, in my view, rightly adhered to Casman in\nLoveladies Harbor, Inc. v. United States, 27 F. 3d 1545\n(1994) (en banc), and rightly did so in this case.\n   While I agree with much of JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s opin\nion concurring in the judgment, I do not agree with her\nconclusion that §1500 bars the Nation’s CFC action.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR joins the Court’s judgment (although\nnot the Court’s reasoning) because the “Tohono O’odham\nNation seeks in the [CFC] . . . some of the same relief on\nthe same facts as it does in its pending District Court\naction.” Ante, at 1 (emphasis added). But to the extent\nthat “the Nation’s two actions seek overlapping relief,”\nibid., a disposition less harsh would be in order. Ordinar\nily, when a plaintiff’s allegations and demands for relief\nare excessive, her complaint is not instantly dismissed on\nthat account. Instead, she may seek leave to trim her\npleading, permission a court “should freely give . . . when\njustice so requires.” Rule 15(a)(2) (CFC 2010). Cf. Rule\n54(c) (CFC 2010) (judgment, other than default, need not\nconform to demand for relief, but “should grant the relief\nto which each party is entitled”).\n   As JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR and the Nation recognize, to\navoid both duplication and the running of the statute of\nlimitations, the CFC suit could be stayed while the com\npanion District Court action proceeds. See ante, at 11;\nBrief for Respondent 35. That is a common practice when\na prior action is pending. See Pennsylvania R. Co. v.\nUnited States, 363 U. S. 202, 204–206 (1960) (instructing\nCourt of Claims to stay pending proceedings to enable\nlitigant to obtain District Court review of relevant agency\norder); Creppel v.

I see no\nimpediment to either course, in §1500 or any other law or\nrule.\n</pre>", "id": 215412, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2011/04/26/United_States_v._Tohono_Oodham_Nation.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2010                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 09–846.      Argued November 1, 2010—Decided April 26, 2011\nRespondent Tohono O’odham Nation (Nation) filed suit in Federal Dis\n  trict Court against federal officials who managed tribal assets held in\n  trust by the Federal Government, alleging violations of fiduciary duty\n  and requesting equitable relief. The next day, the Nation filed this\n  action against the United States in the Court of Federal Claims\n  (CFC), alleging almost identical violations and requesting money\n  damages. The CFC case was dismissed under 28 U. S. C. §1500,\n  which bars CFC jurisdiction over a claim if the plaintiff has another\n  suit “for or in respect to” that claim pending against the United\n  States or its agents in another court. The Federal Circuit reversed,\n  finding that the two suits were not for or in respect to the same claim\n  because, although they shared operative facts, they did not seek over\n  lapping relief.\nHeld:\n    1. Two suits are for or in respect to the same claim, precluding CFC\n jurisdiction, if they are based on substantially the same operative\n facts, regardless of the relief sought in each suit. Pp. 2–9.\n       (a) Since 1868, Congress has restricted the jurisdiction of the\n CFC and its predecessors when related actions are pending else\n where. Keene Corp. v. United States, 508 U. S. 200, 212, held that\n two suits are for or in respect to the same claim when they are “based\n on substantially the same operative facts . . . , at least if there [is]\n some overlap in the relief requested,” but it reserved the question\n whether the jurisdictional bar operates if suits based on the same op\n erative facts do not seek overlapping relief. The rule now codified in\n §1500 was first enacted to curb duplicate lawsuits by residents of the\n Confederacy who, in seeking to recover for cotton taken by the Fed\n eral Government, sued the Government in the Court of Claims and,\n2          UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    at the same time, sued federal officials in other courts, seeking tort\n    relief for the same actions. Section 1500’s robust response to this\n    problem bars CFC jurisdiction not only if the plaintiff sues on an\n    identical claim elsewhere, but also if the other action is related but\n    not identical. The phrase “in respect to” does not resolve all doubt as\n    to the bar’s scope, but it suggests a broad prohibition, regardless of\n    whether “claim” carries a special or limited meaning. Pp. 2–4.\n         (b) Keene permits two constructions of “for or in respect to” the\n    same claim, one based on facts alone and the other on factual plus\n    remedial overlap. The former is the more reasonable interpretation\n    in light of the statute’s use of a similar phrase in a way consistent\n    only with factual overlap. The CFC bar applies where the other ac\n    tion is against a “person who, . . . when the cause of action . . . arose,\n    was, in respect thereto, acting” under color of federal law. But at the\n    time that a cause of action arose, the person could not act in respect\n    to the relief requested, for no complaint was yet filed. Although the\n    phrase at issue involves a “claim” rather than a cause of action, there\n    is reason to think that both phrases refer to facts alone and not to re\n    lief. As Keene explained, “ ‘claim’ is used here synonymously with\n    ‘cause of action,’ ” 508 U. S., at 210. And if the phrase that uses\n    “cause of action,” the more technical term, does not embrace the con\n    cept of remedy, it is reasonable to conclude that neither phrase does.\n    Pp. 4–5.\n         (c) This reading also makes sense in light of the CFC’s unique\n    remedial powers. Because the CFC is the only judicial forum for\n    most nontort requests for significant monetary relief against the\n    United States and because it has no general power to provide equita\n    ble relief against the Government or its officers, a statute aimed at\n    precluding duplicate CFC suits would be unlikely to require remedial\n    overlap. Remedial overlap was even more unusual when §1500’s rule\n    was first enacted in 1868. The Federal Circuit could identify no pur\n    pose the statute served in light of that court’s precedent. But courts\n    should not render statutes nugatory through construction. The stat\n    ute’s purpose is clear from its origins—the need to save the Govern\n    ment from redundant litigation—and the conclusion that two suits\n    are for or in respect to the same claim when they share substantially\n    the same operative facts allows the statute to achieve that aim. Con\n    centrating on operative facts is also consistent with the doctrine of\n    claim preclusion, or res judicata. The Nation errs in arguing that\n    this Court’s interpretation unjustly forces plaintiffs to choose be\n    tween partial remedies available in different courts. The Nation\n    could have recovered any losses in the CFC alone. Even if some\n    hardship were shown, this Court “enjoy[s] no ‘liberty to add an excep\n    tion . . . to remove apparent hardship.’ ” Keene, supra, at 217–218.\n                     Cite as: 563 U.

The substantial overlap in operative facts between the Nation’s\n  District Court and CFC suits precludes jurisdiction in the CFC.

The Nation’s main reservation is in\nthe Sonoran desert of southern Arizona. Counting this\nand other reservation lands, the Nation’s landholdings are\napproximately 3 million acres.\n  The Nation brought two actions based on the same\nalleged violations of fiduciary duty with respect to the\nNation’s lands and other assets. One action was filed\nagainst federal officials in district court and the other\nagainst the United States in the Court of Federal Claims\n(CFC). The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held\nthat the CFC suit was not barred by the rule that the CFC\nlacks jurisdiction over an action “for or in respect to” a\nclaim that is also the subject of an action pending in an\nother court. 28 U. S. C. §1500. The question presented is\nwhether a common factual basis like the one apparent in\nthe Nation’s suits suffices to bar jurisdiction under §1500.\n                             I\n  The case turns on the relationship between the two suits\nthe Nation filed. The first suit was filed in the United\n2       UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStates District Court for the District of Columbia against\nfederal officials responsible for managing tribal assets\nheld in trust by the Federal Government. The complaint\nalleged various violations of fiduciary duty with respect to\nthose assets. The Nation claimed, for example, that the\nofficials failed to provide an accurate accounting of trust\nproperty; to refrain from self-dealing; or to use reasonable\nskill in investing trust assets. The complaint requested\nequitable relief, including an accounting.\n  The next day the Nation filed the instant action against\nthe United States in the CFC. The CFC complaint de\nscribed the same trust assets and the same fiduciary\nduties that were the subject of the District Court com\nplaint. And it alleged almost identical violations of fiduci\nary duty, for which it requested money damages. The CFC\ncase was dismissed under §1500 for want of jurisdiction.\n  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit reversed. 559 F. 3d 1284 (2009). Two suits are for\nor in respect to the same claim, it reasoned, only if they\nshare operative facts and also seek overlapping relief.\nFinding no overlap in the relief requested, the court held\nthat the two suits at issue were not for or in respect to the\nsame claim.\n  This Court granted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                              II\n  Since 1868, Congress has restricted the jurisdiction of\nthe CFC and its predecessors when related actions are\npending elsewhere. Section 1500, identical in most re\nspects to the original statute, provides:\n      “The United States Court of Federal Claims shall\n    not have jurisdiction of any claim for or in respect to\n    which the plaintiff or his assignee has pending in any\n    other court any suit or process against the United\n    States or any person who, at the time when the cause\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    of action alleged in such suit or process arose, was, in\n    respect thereto, acting or professing to act, directly or\n    indirectly under the authority of the United States.”\nThe rule is more straightforward than its complex wording\nsuggests. The CFC has no jurisdiction over a claim if the\nplaintiff has another suit for or in respect to that claim\npending against the United States or its agents.\n   The question to be resolved is what it means for two\nsuits to be “for or in respect to” the same claim. Keene\nCorp. v. United States, 508 U. S. 200 (1993), provided a\npartial answer. It held that two suits are for or in respect\nto the same claim when they are “based on substantially\nthe same operative facts . . . , at least if there [is] some\noverlap in the relief requested.” Id., at 212. The Keene\ncase did not decide whether the jurisdictional bar also\noperates if the suits are based on the same operative facts\nbut do not seek overlapping relief. Still, Keene narrows\nthe permissible constructions of “for or in respect to” a\nclaim to one of two interpretations. Either it requires\nsubstantial factual and some remedial overlap, or it re\nquires substantial factual overlap without more.\n   Congress first enacted the jurisdictional bar now codi\nfied in §1500 to curb duplicate lawsuits brought by resi\ndents of the Confederacy following the Civil War. The\nso-called “cotton claimants”—named for their suits to\nrecover for cotton taken by the Federal Government—sued\nthe United States in the Court of Claims under the Aban\ndoned Property Collection Act, 12 Stat. 820, while at the\nsame time suing federal officials in other courts, seeking\nrelief under tort law for the same alleged actions. See\nKeene, supra, at 206–207; Schwartz, Section 1500 of the\nJudicial Code and Duplicate Suits Against the Govern\nment and Its Agents, 55 Geo. L. J. 573, 574–580 (1967).\nAlthough the rule embodied in §1500 originated long ago,\nCongress reenacted the statute at various times, most\n4       UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrecently in 1948. See Act of June 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 942;\nKeene, 508 U. S., at 206–207.\n   The text of §1500 reflects a robust response to the prob\nlem first presented by the cotton claimants. It bars juris\ndiction in the CFC not only if the plaintiff sues on an\nidentical claim elsewhere—a suit “for” the same claim—\nbut also if the plaintiff’s other action is related although\nnot identical—a suit “in respect to” the same claim. The\nphrase “in respect to” does not resolve all doubt as to the\nscope of the jurisdictional bar, but “it does make it clear\nthat Congress did not intend the statute to be rendered\nuseless by a narrow concept of identity.” Id., at 213. It\nsuggests a broad prohibition, regardless of whether\n“claim” carries a special or limited meaning. Cf. United\nStates v. Jones, 131 U. S. 1 (1889) (“claim” in the Little\nTucker Act refers only to requests for money).\n   Of the two constructions of “for or in respect to” the\nsame claim that Keene permits—one based on facts alone\nand the other on factual plus remedial overlap—the for\nmer is the more reasonable interpretation in light of the\nstatute’s use of a similar phrase in a way consistent only\nwith factual overlap. The CFC bar applies even where the\nother action is not against the Government but instead\nagainst a “person who, at the time when the cause of\naction alleged in such suit or process arose, was, in respect\nthereto, acting or professing to act, directly or indirectly\nunder the authority of the United States.” The statute\nrefers to a person who acts under color of federal law in\nrespect to a cause of action at the time it arose. But at\nthat time, the person could not act in respect to the relief\nrequested, for no complaint was yet filed. This use of the\nphrase “in respect to a cause of action” must refer to op\nerative facts and not whatever remedies an aggrieved\nparty might later request. A person acts under color of\nfederal law in respect to a cause of action by claiming or\nwielding federal authority in the relevant factual context.\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Although the two phrases are not identical—one is in\nrespect to a claim, the other a cause of action—they are\nalmost so, and there is reason to think that both phrases\nrefer to facts alone and not to relief. As the Keene Court\nexplained, “the term ‘claim’ is used here synonymously\nwith ‘cause of action.’ ” 508 U. S., at 210. And if either of\nthe two phrases were to include both operative facts and a\nspecific remedy, it would be the one that uses the term\n“cause of action” rather than “claim.” “Cause of action” is\nthe more technical term, while “claim” is often used in a\ncommonsense way to mean a right or demand. Here, for\nthe reasons stated in the preceding paragraph, “in respect\nto a cause of action” refers simply to facts without regard\nto judicial remedies. So, if the phrase with the more tech\nnical of the two terms does not embrace the concept of\nremedy, it is reasonable to conclude that neither phrase\ndoes. Even if the terms “claim” or “cause of action” include\nthe request for relief, the phrase “for or in respect to” gives\nthe statutory bar a broader scope.\n  Reading the statute to require only factual and not also\nremedial overlap makes sense in light of the unique reme\ndial powers of the CFC. The CFC is the only judicial\nforum for most non-tort requests for significant monetary\nrelief against the United States. See 28 U. S. C. §1491\n(2006 ed. and Supp. III); §1346(a)(2) (2006 ed.). Unlike\nthe district courts, however, the CFC has no general power\nto provide equitable relief against the Government or its\nofficers. Compare United States v. King, 395 U. S. 1, 2–3\n(1969), with 5 U. S. C. §702; see also United States v.\nAlire, 6 Wall. 573, 575 (1868) (“[T]he only judgments\nwhich the Court of Claims are authorized to render\nagainst the government . . . are judgments for money\nfound due from the government to the petitioner”). The\ndistinct jurisdiction of the CFC makes overlapping relief\nthe exception and distinct relief the norm. For that rea\nson, a statute aimed at precluding suits in the CFC that\n6       UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nduplicate suits elsewhere would be unlikely to require\nremedial overlap.\n  Remedial overlap between CFC actions and those in\nother courts was even more unusual when §1500’s rule\nwas first enacted in 1868. At that time the CFC had a\nmore limited jurisdiction than it does now, for the Tucker\nAct’s general waiver of sovereign immunity for non-tort\nclaims for monetary relief had not yet been enacted. See\n24 Stat. 505. And while the district courts can today\nadjudicate suits against the United States for money\ndamages under the Little Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C.\n§1346(a)(2), and the Federal Tort Claims Act §1346(b), in\n1868 the United States could only be sued in the Court of\nClaims. United States v. Mitchell, 463 U. S. 206, 212–214\n(1983); G. Sisk, Litigation with the Federal Government\n§4.02(a)(1) (4th ed. 2006). Because the kinds of suits and\nforms of relief available against the United States were\nfew and constrained, remedial overlap between CFC suits\nand those in other courts was even less common then than\nnow. If the statute were to require remedial as well as\nfactual overlap, it would have had very limited application\nin 1868 despite its broad language that bars not only\nidentical but also related claims. The rule in §1500 effects\na significant jurisdictional limitation, and Congress reen\nacted it even as changes in the structure of the courts\nmade suits on the same facts more likely to arise. Doing\nso reaffirmed the force of the bar and thus the commit\nment to curtailing redundant litigation.\n  The panel of the Court of Appeals could not identify\n“any purpose that §1500 serves today,” 559 F. 3d, at 1292,\nin large part because it was bound by Circuit precedent\nthat left the statute without meaningful force. For exam\nple, the panel cited Tecon Engineers, Inc. v. United States,\n170 Ct. Cl. 389, 343 F. 2d 943 (1965), which held that\n§1500 does not prohibit two identical suits from proceed\ning so long as the action in the CFC, or at that time the\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt of Claims, is filed first. The Tecon holding is not\npresented in this case because the CFC action here was\nfiled after the District Court suit.\n   Still, the Court of Appeals was wrong to allow its prece\ndent to suppress the statute’s aims. Courts should not\nrender statutes nugatory through construction. In fact the\nstatute’s purpose is clear from its origins with the cotton\nclaimants—the need to save the Government from bur\ndens of redundant litigation—and that purpose is no less\nsignificant today. The conclusion that two suits are for or\nin respect to the same claim when they are based on sub\nstantially the same operative facts allows the statute to\nachieve its aim. Keene, supra, at 206. Developing a fac\ntual record is responsible for much of the cost of litigation.\nDiscovery is a conspicuous example, and the preparation\nand examination of witnesses at trial is another. The form\nof relief requested matters less, except insofar as it affects\nwhat facts parties must prove. An interpretation of §1500\nfocused on the facts rather than the relief a party seeks\npreserves the provision as it was meant to function, and it\nkeeps the provision from becoming a mere pleading rule,\nto be circumvented by carving up a single transaction into\noverlapping pieces seeking different relief. Cf. Casman v.\nUnited States, 135 Ct. Cl. 647 (1956) (CFC had jurisdiction\nnotwithstanding common facts in district court suit be\ncause the plaintiff sought different relief in each forum).\n   Concentrating on operative facts is also consistent with\nthe doctrine of claim preclusion, or res judicata, which\nbars “repetitious suits involving the same cause of action”\nonce “a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a final\njudgment on the merits.” Commissioner v. Sunnen, 333\nU. S. 591, 597 (1948). The jurisdictional bar in §1500 was\nenacted in part to address the problem that judgments in\nsuits against officers were not preclusive in suits against\nthe United States. Matson Nav. Co. v. United States, 284\nU. S. 352, 355–356 (1932). So it is no surprise that the\n8       UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute would operate in similar fashion. The now\naccepted test in preclusion law for determining whether\ntwo suits involve the same claim or cause of action de\npends on factual overlap, barring “claims arising from the\nsame transaction.” Kremer v. Chemical Constr. Corp., 456\nU. S. 461, 482, n. 22 (1982); see also Restatement (Second)\nof Judgments §24 (1980). The transactional test is of\ncourse much younger than the rule embodied in §1500, but\neven in the 19th century it was not uncommon to identify\na claim for preclusion purposes based on facts rather than\nrelief. See J. Wells, Res Adjudicata and Stare Decisis\n§241, p. 208 (1878) (“The true distinction between de\nmands or rights of action which are single and entire, and\nthose which are several and distinct, is, that the former\nimmediately arise out of one and the same act or contract,\nand the latter out of different acts or contracts” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)); 2 H. Black, Law of Judgments\n§726, p. 866 (1891) (The test for identity is: “Would the\nsame evidence support and establish both the present and\nthe former cause of action?”). Reading §1500 to depend on\nthe underlying facts and not also on the relief requested\ngives effect to the principles of preclusion law embodied in\nthe statute.\n  There is no merit to the Nation’s assertion that the\ninterpretation adopted here cannot prevail because it is\nunjust, forcing plaintiffs to choose between partial reme\ndies available in different courts. The hardship in this\ncase is far from clear. The Nation could have filed in the\nCFC alone and if successful obtained monetary relief to\ncompensate for any losses caused by the Government’s\nbreach of duty. It also seems likely that Indian tribes in\nthe Nation’s position could go to district court first without\nlosing the chance to later file in the CFC, for Congress has\nprovided in every appropriations Act for the Department\nof Interior since 1990 that the statute of limitations on\nIndian trust mismanagement claims shall not run until\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe affected tribe has been given an appropriate account\ning. See, e.g., 123 Stat. 2922; 104 Stat. 1930.\n  Even were some hardship to be shown, considerations of\npolicy divorced from the statute’s text and purpose could\nnot override its meaning. Although Congress has permit\nted claims against the United States for monetary relief in\nthe CFC, that relief is available by grace and not by right.\nSee Beers v. Arkansas, 20 How. 527, 529 (1858) (“[A]s this\npermission is altogether voluntary on the part of the\nsovereignty, it follows that it may prescribe the terms and\nconditions on which it consents to be sued, and the man\nner in which the suit shall be conducted”). If indeed the\nstatute leads to incomplete relief, and if plaintiffs like the\nNation are dissatisfied, they are free to direct their com\nplaints to Congress. This Court “enjoy[s] no ‘liberty to add\nan exception . . . to remove apparent hardship.’ ” Keene,\n508 U. S., at 217–218 (quoting Corona Coal Co. v. United\nStates, 263 U. S. 537, 540 (1924)).\n  Keene reserved the question whether common facts are\nsufficient to bar a CFC action where a similar case is\npending elsewhere. To continue to reserve the question\nwould force the CFC to engage in an unnecessary and\ncomplicated remedial inquiry, and it would increase the\nexpense and duration of litigation. The question thus\ndemands an answer, and the answer is yes. Two suits are\nfor or in respect to the same claim, precluding jurisdiction\nin the CFC, if they are based on substantially the same\noperative facts, regardless of the relief sought in each suit.\n                              III\n   The remaining question is whether the Nation’s two\nsuits have sufficient factual overlap to trigger the jurisdic\ntional bar. The CFC dismissed the action here in part\nbecause it concluded that the facts in the Nation’s two\nsuits were, “for all practical purposes, identical.” 79 Fed.\nCl. 645, 656 (2007). It was correct to do so.\n10      UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The two actions both allege that the United States holds\nthe same assets in trust for the Nation’s benefit. They\ndescribe almost identical breaches of fiduciary duty—that\nthe United States engaged in self-dealing and imprudent\ninvestment, and failed to provide an accurate accounting\nof the assets held in trust, for example. Indeed, it appears\nthat the Nation could have filed two identical complaints,\nsave the caption and prayer for relief, without changing\neither suit in any significant respect.\n   Under §1500, the substantial overlap in operative facts\nbetween the Nation’s District Court and CFC suits pre\ncludes jurisdiction in the CFC. The Court of Appeals erred\nwhen it concluded otherwise.\n                               IV\n   The holding here precludes the CFC from exercising\njurisdiction over the Nation’s suit while the District Court\ncase is pending. Should the Nation choose to dismiss the\nlatter action, or upon that action’s completion, the Nation\nis free to file suit again in the CFC if the statute of limita\ntions is no bar. In the meantime, and in light of the sub\nstantial overlap in operative facts between them, the two\nsuits are “for or in respect to” the same claim under §1500,\nand the CFC case must be dismissed. The contrary judg\nment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                               It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

S. C. §1500 to put an end to parallel litigation seeking\nduplicative relief against the United States and its agents.\nRespondent Tohono O’odham Nation seeks in the Court of\nFederal Claims (CFC) some of the same relief on the same\nfacts as it does in its pending District Court action. Ac\ncordingly, applying our decision in Keene Corp. v. United\nStates, 508 U. S. 200 (1993), I agree with the Court that\n§1500 bars the Nation’s CFC action. Because the Nation’s\ntwo actions seek overlapping relief, this case does not\npresent the question that the Court decides today—\nwhether §1500 bars an action in the CFC when the plain\ntiff’s actions share a common factual basis but seek differ\nent forms of relief. Nonetheless, the Court holds that a\ncommon factual basis alone suffices to bar jurisdiction in\nthe CFC. Under the Court’s reading of the statute, a\nplaintiff cannot pursue a claim in the CFC based on the\nsame facts as another pending action, even when Congress\nhas required that plaintiff to file separate actions in two\ncourts to obtain different forms of relief necessary to make\nthe plaintiff whole. I cannot agree that §1500 demands\nthis result.\n2           UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION \n\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\n                                I\n\n   Section 1500 bars jurisdiction in the CFC over “any\nclaim for or in respect to which the plaintiff . . . has pend\ning in any other court any suit or process against the\nUnited States” or any agent of the United States. In\nKeene, we construed this statute to “turn on whether the\nplaintiff’s other suit was based on substantially the same\noperative facts as the Court of Claims action, at least if\nthere was some overlap in the relief requested.” Id., at\n212. It was irrelevant for purposes of §1500, we observed,\nthat the two suits proceeded on different legal theories.\nId., at 212. Because the plaintiff’s actions both sought the\nsame monetary relief, albeit on different theories, we held\nthat the CFC lacked jurisdiction. Id., at 217–218. We\nthus found “it unnecessary to consider” whether §1500\nbarred a CFC claim that was based on substantially the\nsame operative facts as another suit but that sought dif\nferent relief. See id., at 212, n. 6, 216.\n   As construed in Keene, §1500 bars the Nation’s CFC\naction. As the majority holds, see ante, at 9–10, the Na\ntion’s CFC and District Court actions are based on nearly\nidentical facts. The two actions also seek overlapping\nrelief: Both complaints request money to remedy the same\ninjury—the Government’s alleged breach of its fiduciary\nduty to maintain accurate accounts of the Nation’s assets.\nThe Nation does not dispute that its District Court com\nplaint requests such relief.1 See Brief for Respondent 51\n(“If . . . the accounting reveals that assets that belong to\nthe Nation do not appear on the books, it may be appro\npriate to order equitable restitution of those assets”). The\nNation’s CFC complaint is fairly read to do the same. The\n——————\n    1 The\n       majority characterizes the Nation’s District Court complaint as\nseeking “equitable relief,” ante, at 2, but does not mention that the\ncomplaint seeks, among other things, equitable monetary relief such as\ndisgorgement and restitution, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 91a.\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                   3\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nCFC complaint alleges that the Government has failed\n“to keep and render clear and accurate accounts.” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 66a. It claims that by reason of this and\nother alleged breaches of fiduciary duty, the Nation “has\nbeen damaged in such amounts as may be proven at trial.”\nId., at 67a. And the complaint requests “a determination\nthat the Defendant is liable to the Nation in damages for\nthe injuries and losses caused as a result of Defendant’s\nbreaches of fiduciary duty” and a “determination of the\namount of damages due the Nation.” Id., at 72a–73a.\nThus, just like the District Court complaint, the CFC\ncomplaint requests money to remedy the Government’s\nalleged failure to keep accurate accounts.2\n  Because the Nation’s two complaints are “based on\nsubstantially the same operative facts” and there is “at\nleast . . . some overlap in the relief requested,” Keene, 508\nU. S., at 212, §1500 bars jurisdiction over the Nation’s\nCFC action.\n                             II\n  The case does not present the question, left open in\nKeene, “whether common facts [alone] are sufficient to bar\na CFC action where a similar case is pending elsewhere.”\nAnte, at 9. Indeed, for most of the history of this case, the\nGovernment did not even argue that common facts were\nsufficient to preclude CFC jurisdiction; until its petition\nfor rehearing in the Court of Appeals, the Government\n——————\n   2 In reaching the opposite conclusion, the Court of Appeals relied on\n\nthe fact that the Nation’s District Court complaint seeks equitable\nrelief whereas its CFC complaint seeks damages. See 559 F. 3d 1284,\n1288–1289 (CA Fed. 2009). Keene makes clear, however, that actions\nbased on substantially the same operative facts implicate §1500 so long\nas they seek overlapping relief. See Keene Corp. v. United States, 508\nU. S. 200, 212 (1993). The formal label affixed to the form of relief\nsought is irrelevant. In this case, both the Nation’s CFC complaint and\nits District Court complaint seek money to remedy the Government’s\nalleged failure to keep accurate accounts.\n4           UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION\n\n                 SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nargued only that Keene required dismissal of the Nation’s\nCFC action because the Nation’s two actions were based\non the same facts and sought overlapping relief. Deciding\nthis case on the basis of Keene would have been the “far\nmore prudent course than recharacterizing the case in an\nattempt to reach premature decision on an important\nquestion.” Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U. S. 33, 80 (1990)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg\nment). Instead, discarding the restraint we exhibited in\nKeene, the Court unnecessarily chooses to hold that §1500\nbars jurisdiction in the CFC whenever a plaintiff’s CFC\naction is based on substantially the same facts as a suit\npending elsewhere.3 This reading of §1500 is, in my opin\nion, incorrect.\n                               A\n  Since the enactment of §1500 in 1868, Congress has\nexpanded the avenues by which persons with legitimate\nclaims against the United States may obtain relief. See\nante, at 6. In some circumstances, Congress has chosen to\nrequire plaintiffs to file actions in two different courts to\nobtain complete relief relating to a single set of operative\nfacts. For example, with some exceptions, the CFC has no\npower to issue equitable relief. See Bowen v. Massachu\n——————\n    3 Themajority does not contend that the facts of this case require it to\ndecide this question. It justifies its decision to reach the question on\nthe ground that its rule would eliminate “an unnecessary and compli\ncated remedial inquiry” and would decrease “the expense and duration\nof litigation.” Ante, at 9. It provides no reason to believe, however, that\ninquiry into relief requested is unduly complicated in the vast majority\nof cases. Cf. Loveladies Harbor, Inc. v. United States, 27 F. 3d 1545,\n1552 (CA Fed. 1994) (en banc) (“The principles of Casman [v. United\nStates, 135 Ct. Cl. 647 (1956)] . . . are not that difficult to comprehend\nor apply”). More importantly, the majority does not explain why the\nbenefits it perceives to result from deciding this question today out\nweigh the potential for its reading of the statute to leave some plaintiffs\nwith incomplete recompense for their injuries.

S. 879, 905 (1988); see also 28 U. S. C.\n§1491(a). As a result, a plaintiff seeking both money\ndamages and injunctive relief to remedy distinct harms\narising from the same set of facts may be forced to file\nactions in both the CFC and federal district court.\n  For half a century, the CFC has recognized that §1500\ndoes not preclude jurisdiction in that court when Congress\nhas required a plaintiff to split a claim into two actions to\nobtain different forms of relief necessary to make the\nplaintiff whole. In Casman v. United States, 135 Ct. Cl.\n647 (1956), a terminated federal employee sought backpay\nin the Court of Claims and reinstatement to his position in\nDistrict Court. The plaintiff’s two suits arose from the\nsame facts (his termination) but sought “entirely different”\nforms of relief within the exclusive jurisdiction of two\ncourts.4 Id., at 650. In light of our previous recognition\nthat the purpose of §1500 “ ‘was only to require an election\nbetween a suit in the Court of Claims and one brought in\nanother court,’ ” id., at 649 (quoting Matson Nav. Co. v.\nUnited States, 284 U. S. 352, 355–356 (1932)), the Court of\nClaims held that §1500 was inapplicable when a “plaintiff\nhas no right to elect between two courts,” 135 Ct. Cl., at\n650. To hold otherwise, the court acknowledged, “would\nbe to say to plaintiff, ‘If you want your job back you must\nforget your back pay’; conversely, ‘If you want your back\npay, you cannot have your job back.’ ” Ibid.; see also Love\nladies Harbor, Inc. v. United States, 27 F. 3d 1545, 1551\n(CA Fed. 1994) (en banc) (reaffirming Casman’s inquiry\ninto the form of relief sought).\n  By reserving the question “whether two actions based on\n——————\n  4 Congress has since enacted legislation to permit plaintiffs in Cas\n\nman’s situation to obtain complete relief in the CFC. See Act of Aug.\n29, 1972, §1, 86 Stat. 652, 28 U. S.

S., at 212,\nn. 6. The consequence of today’s decision is clear: The\nCasman rule is no longer good law. Under the majority’s\nreading of §1500, because Casman’s two suits were based\non common facts, §1500 barred jurisdiction in the CFC\nover his backpay claim even though he could not have\nobtained backpay in his District Court action.\n  The jurisdictional scheme governing actions against the\nUnited States often requires other plaintiffs to file two\nactions in different courts to obtain complete relief in\nconnection with one set of facts. As just one example, an\naction seeking injunctive relief to set aside agency action\nmust proceed in district court, but a claim that the same\nagency action constitutes a taking of property requiring\njust compensation must proceed in the CFC. See, e.g.,\nAlaska v. United States, 32 Fed. Cl. 689 (1995). After\ntoday’s decision, §1500 may well prevent a plaintiff from\npursuing a takings claim in the CFC if an action to set\naside the agency action is pending in district court. This\ntype of plaintiff may face a choice between equally unat\ntractive options: forgo injunctive relief in the district court\nto preserve her claim for monetary relief in the CFC, or\npursue injunctive relief and hope that the statute of limi\ntations on her takings claim, see 28 U. S. C. §2501, does\nnot expire before the district court action is resolved.5\n——————\n   5 The majority apparently doubts that its holding puts the Nation to a\n\nsimilarly difficult choice. It first suggests that the Nation could file\nsolely in the CFC to obtain damages for the Government’s alleged\nbreaches of fiduciary duty. See ante, at 8. The Nation could indeed\nchoose to file only in the CFC—just as any plaintiff could choose to\nforgo injunctive relief to pursue money damages in the CFC—but the\nNation believes it is entitled to more than monetary relief. The Na\ntion’s District Court action seeks an equitable accounting to remedy the\nsame breaches of fiduciary duty, and the CFC has held that it lacks\njurisdiction to issue a preliability accounting.

The statute bars jurisdiction in the CFC over\na “claim for or in respect to which” a plaintiff has a suit or\nprocess pending elsewhere. When Congress first enacted\n§1500’s predecessor, the statute establishing the jurisdic\ntion of the Court of Claims used the term “claims” to refer\nto demands for money damages. See Act of Mar. 3, 1863,\n§§2–3, 12 Stat. 765; see United States v. Jones, 131 U. S.\n1, 17 (1889) (noting that the statute’s provisions “were\ninconsistent with the enforcement of any claims under the\nlaw except claims for money”).6 Congress thus would have\n——————\nTribes v. United States, 174 Ct. Cl. 483, 487–488, 490 (1966). But see\nEastern Shawnee Tribe of Okla. v. United States, 582 F. 3d 1306, 1308\n(CA Fed. 2009) (suggesting in dicta that the CFC can order an equita\nble accounting as “ancillary relief” under 28 U. S. C. §§1491(a)(2) and\n(b)(2)), cert. pending, No. 09–1521.\n   The majority next suggests that Congress has tolled the statute of\nlimitations governing the Nation’s CFC claims. See ante, at 8–9. But\nthe cited statute only applies to claims “concerning losses to or mis\nmanagement of trust funds.” 123 Stat. 2922. It does not appear to toll\nthe statute of limitations for claims concerning assets other than funds,\nsuch as tangible assets. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a–69a (seeking\ndamages for the Government’s mismanagement of the Nation’s mineral\nestates). Expiration of the 6-year statute of limitations governing\nclaims in the CFC is a very real prospect in this and other cases; the\nNation’s District Court action has been pending for more than four\nyears.\n   As the majority notes, see ante, at 6–7, the validity of the Court of\nClaims’ holding in Tecon Engineers, Inc. v. United States, 170 Ct. Cl.\n389, 343 F. 2d 943 (1965), is not presented in this case. This Court has\nnever considered that holding. Accordingly, I do not consider whether\nthe Nation could have avoided application of §1500 altogether by filing\nits CFC action first.\n   6 Congress has consistently used the term “claim” to refer to a de\n8        UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION\n\n               SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nunderstood the term “claim” in §1500 to describe the\nparticular relief sought in the Court of Claims. Cf. Com\nmissioner v. Keystone Consol. Industries, Inc., 508 U. S.\n152, 159 (1993).\n  Determining the meaning of “claim” is only part of the\ninquiry, however. The question remains what constitutes\na suit or process “for or in respect to” a CFC claim. The\npurpose and history of the statute elucidate the meaning\nof this ambiguous phrase. As the majority explains, Con\ngress enacted the statute to prevent “duplicative lawsuits”\nbrought by the so-called “cotton claimants” in the after\nmath of the Civil War. Keene, 508 U. S., at 206; see ante,\nat 3. The cotton claimants sought monetary compensation\nfor seized cotton in the Court of Claims pursuant to the\nAbandoned Property Collection Act, 12 Stat. 820. Because\nthey had difficulty satisfying the statutory requirement\nthat, to obtain compensation, they must not have given aid\nor comfort to participants in the rebellion, see §3 of the\nAct, they also sought relief—either in the form of money\ndamages or actual cotton—in separate lawsuits against\nfederal officials on tort theories such as conversion. “It\nwas these duplicative lawsuits that induced Congress” to\nenact §1500’s predecessor. Keene, 508 U. S., at 206.\n  This historical backdrop sheds light on what Congress\nwould have understood to be a suit or process “for or in\nrespect to” a “claim” in the Court of Claims. Congress\nundoubtedly intended to preclude a claim for money in the\n\n——————\nmand for money in the context of the CFC. See 28 U. S. C. §1491(a)(1)\n(conferring jurisdiction in the CFC over “any claim against the United\nStates founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress\nor any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or\nimplied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliqui\ndated damages in cases not sounding in tort” (emphasis added)). Of\ncourse, since §1500’s enactment, Congress has authorized the CFC\nto issue relief other than money damages in certain cases. See\n§1491(a)(2).\n                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                   9\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nCourt of Claims when the plaintiff was pursuing a suit\n“for” the same money in district court. Because, however,\nsome cotton claimants sought return of the cotton itself in\ndistrict court, it was also necessary to preclude jurisdiction\nin the Court of Claims when the plaintiff’s other action\nwas “in respect to” that demand for money—i.e., when the\nplaintiff was seeking duplicative relief. Had the courts\nawarded such plaintiffs both the cotton itself and money\ndamages, the plaintiffs would have obtained twice what\nthey deserved. In this way, Congress eschewed “a narrow\nconcept of identity” that would have permitted plaintiffs to\npursue and obtain duplicative relief to remedy the very\nsame harm. Id., at 213.\n   The legislative history confirms Congress’ intent to\npreclude requests for duplicative relief. The statute’s\nsponsor explained that the purpose of the statute was “to\nput to their election that large class of persons having\ncotton claims[,] . . . who are here at the same time endeav\noring to prosecute their claims, and have filed them in the\nCourt of Claims, so that after they put the Government to\nthe expense of beating them once in a court of law they\ncan turn around and try the whole question in the Court of\nClaims.”7 Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 2d Sess., 2769 (1868)\n(statement of Sen. Edmunds); see also Matson Nav. Co.,\n284 U. S., at 355–356. Congress thus appears to have had\nin mind cases in which “the whole question” could be tried\nin the Court of Claims. The statute’s history does not\nsuggest that Congress intended to require an election\nbetween two nonduplicative forms of relief available ex\nclusively in two different courts. In such a case, “the\nwhole question” could not be tried in either court.\n\n——————\n  7 Because  §1500’s jurisdictional bar applies only when the other suit\nis pending, “there is a good argument that, even when first enacted, the\nstatute did not actually perform the preclusion function emphasized by\nits sponsor.” Keene, 508 U. S., at 217.\n10       UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION \n\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\n                                2\n\n   None of the majority’s reasons for its contrary construc\ntion of the statute is convincing. First, the majority rea\nsons that the phrase “claim for or in respect to” must refer\nonly to factual overlap because the statute uses the phrase\n“cause of action . . . in respect thereto” (which the majority\nparaphrases as “in respect to a cause of action”) in a way\nthat is “consistent only with factual overlap.” Ante, at 4.\nThis point rests on a misreading of the statutory text. The\nstatute asks whether a plaintiff has pending a “suit or\nprocess” for or in respect to the plaintiff’s CFC claim—not\nwhether it has pending a “cause of action” for or in respect\nto that claim.8 Even if the term “cause of action” refers\nonly to operative facts—such that the inquiry whether a\nperson was acting under color of federal law in respect to\na cause of action is purely factual in nature—a “suit or\nprocess” will inevitably include a request for relief.\n   Second, the majority states that, “in light of the unique\nremedial powers of the CFC,” requiring remedial overlap\nwould make no sense because it would result in a “very\nlimited application” of the statute. Ante, at 5, 6. Here, the\nmajority overlooks the nearly 150-year history of the\nstatute. It was the cotton claimants’ parallel requests for\nduplicative relief that prompted passage of §1500 in the\nfirst place. Since then, litigants have continued to seek\nduplicative relief against the Government in two courts, as\nKeene and this very case illustrate. See 508 U. S., at 204–\n205 (seeking tort damages in the District Court and com\npensation on a takings theory in the CFC); supra, at 1–3\n(seeking restitution and disgorgement in the District\n\n——————\n  8 Section 1500 refers to the “cause of action alleged in such suit or\n\nprocess” only for the limited purpose of determining whether the other\nsuit or process is against an agent of the United States. When the\nplaintiff’s other action is against the United States itself, the term\n“cause of action” has no relevance to the §1500 inquiry.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n             SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nCourt and money damages in the CFC); see also, e.g., Ex\nparte Skinner & Eddy Corp., 265 U. S. 86, 91–92 (1924)\n(seeking money damages against the United States in the\nCourt of Claims and against a federal entity in state\ncourt); Corona Coal Co. v. United States, 263 U. S. 537,\n539 (1924) (seeking money damages against the United\nStates in the Court of Claims and against a federal agent\nin District Court); British American Tobacco Co. v. United\nStates, 89 Ct. Cl. 438, 439–440 (1939) (per curiam) (seek\ning tort damages in the District Court and contract dam\nages in the Court of Claims). As these cases make clear,\ninterpreting §1500 to prohibit requests for duplicative\nrelief hardly renders the statute of limited application.\n   Third, the majority suggests that its construction of\n§1500 is necessary to achieve the statute’s aim of “sav[ing]\nthe Government from burdens of redundant litigation.”\nAnte, at 7. Parallel actions seeking the same or duplica\ntive relief, or different forms of relief that are available\nentirely in one court, are redundant; actions seeking dif\nferent forms of relief that Congress has made available\nexclusively in different courts are not. To the extent the\nmajority is concerned about the burdens of parallel discov\nery, federal courts have ample tools at their disposal, such\nas stays, to prevent such burdens. See Schwartz, Section\n1500 of the Judicial Code and Duplicate Suits Against the\nGovernment and Its Agents, 55 Geo. L. J. 573, 599 (1967).\n   Finally, the majority contends that focusing on opera\ntive facts is consistent with the principles of claim preclu\nsion embodied in the statute. Claim preclusion ordinarily\n“bar[s] claims arising from the same transaction.” Kremer\nv. Chemical Constr. Corp., 456 U. S. 461, 482, n. 22 (1982).\nThere is, however, an exception to this rule when a plain\ntiff was unable to obtain a certain remedy in the earlier\naction. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments §26(1)(c)\n(1980) (claim preclusion does not apply where “[t]he plain\ntiff was unable to rely on a certain theory of the case or to\n12      UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION\n\n              SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nseek a certain remedy or form of relief in the first action\nbecause of the limitations on the subject matter jurisdic\ntion of the courts”); see also Marrese v. American Academy\nof Orthopaedic Surgeons, 470 U. S. 373, 382 (1985); 18 C.\nWright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and\nProcedure §4412, p. 276 (2d ed. 2002). This principle has\nlong informed claim preclusion law. See, e.g., Restatement\nof Judgments §62, Comment k (1942) (“[W]here a plaintiff\nbrings an action in a State in which the courts have juris\ndiction only with reference to one portion of his cause of\naction, he is not barred from maintaining an action in a\nproper court for the other portion”); 2 H. Black, Law of\nJudgments §618, p. 744 (1891) (“A judgment is not conclu\nsive of any matter which, from the nature of the case, the\nform of action, or the character of the pleadings, could not\nhave been adjudicated in the former suit”). For these\nreasons, preclusion doctrine actually undermines the\nmajority’s position.\n   In sum, the majority offers no coherent justification for\nits conclusion that Congress intended to preclude jurisdic\ntion in the CFC whenever a plaintiff’s claim in that court\nis based on substantially the same facts as a suit pending\nelsewhere without reference to the relief sought.\n                         *     *     *\n   Even before today’s decision, §1500 had been described\nas “anachronistic,” Keene, 508 U. S., at 217, “harsh,” id., at\n222 (Stevens, J., dissenting), and “arbitrar[y],” 79 Fed. Cl.\n645, 659, n. 16 (2007). Judges and commentators have\nlong called for congressional attention to the statute. See,\ne.g., Keene, 508 U. S., at 222 (Stevens, J., dissenting);\nSchwartz, supra, at 601. Today’s decision—which unnec\nessarily considers and repudiates the Casman rule—\nrenders such attention all the more pressing.

S. C. §1500 and would affirm the Federal Circuit’s\njudgment.\n  According to the Court, the Court of Federal Claims\n(CFC) lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the Tohono\nO’odham Nation’s (Nation) claim because the Tribe was\nsimultaneously pursuing in the D. C. District Court an\naction with “a common factual basis.” Ante, at 1. It mat\nters not, the Court holds, that to gain complete relief, the\nNation had to launch two suits, for neither of the two\ncourts whose jurisdiction the Tribe invoked could alone\nprovide full redress. See ante, at 8–9.\n  The Court concludes that “claim” or “cause of action,”\nterms the Court considers synonymous as used in §1500,*\n——————\n  * “ ‘Cause of action,’ ” the Court simultaneously states, “is the more\ntechnical term.” Ante, at 5. If “more technical” means more precise,\nclear or certain, the Court is incorrect. See United States v. Memphis\nCotton Oil Co., 288 U. S. 62, 67–68 (1933) (“A ‘cause of action’ may\nmean one thing for one purpose and something different for another.”).\nIn its discourse on the term, the Court has fallen into an old error; the\ndrafters of the Federal Rules endeavored to “eliminate the unfortunate\nrigidity and confusion surrounding the words ‘cause of action.’ ” 5 C.\nWright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure §1216, p. 207 (3d\ned. 2004). Today’s invocation of a supposed particular or exact meaning\nfor the phrase risks reviving that confusion.\n2       UNITED STATES v. TOHONO O’ODHAM NATION\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nsee ante, at 5, refers to “operative facts,” and not to the\nremedies a plaintiff seeks. See ante, at 4. Section 1500\nspeaks of “the time when the cause of action . . . arose,” a\ntime antedating the commencement of suit. The Court\ninfers, therefore, that a “claim” or “cause of action” is\ndiscrete from a pleading’s request for relief. See ante, at 4.\nIn fact, however, entitlement to relief is essential to the\nexistence of a claim or cause of action, which arises when a\nperson suffers a harm capable of judicial redress. See 2 J.\nStory, Equity Jurisprudence §1521a, p. 741 (8th ed. 1861)\n(“[T]he cause of action . . . arises when . . . the party has a\nright to apply to a court . . . for relief.”).\n   A plaintiff may not, §1500 instructs, petition both the\nCFC and a district court, invoking in each a distinct legal\ntheory appropriate to the forum, but seeking redress for a\nsingle injury. When Congress bars a plaintiff from obtain\ning complete relief in one suit, however, and does not call\nfor an election of remedies, Congress is most sensibly read\nto have comprehended that the operative facts give rise to\ntwo discrete claims. Casman v. United States, 135 Ct. Cl.\n647 (1956), as JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR spells out, see ante, at\n5, is the paradigm case. There, a discharged federal em\nployee, complaining of wrongful termination, sought rein\nstatement in a district-court action and backpay in the\nCourt of Claims. Section 1500 does not stand in the way,\nthe Court of Claims held in Casman, when the plaintiff\nsuffered two distinct injuries, for which she seeks discrete\nforms of relief within the exclusive competence of different\ncourts. See 135 Ct. Cl., at 649–650 (claim for backpay\n“entirely different” from claim for reinstatement). The\nFederal Circuit, in my view, rightly adhered to Casman in\nLoveladies Harbor, Inc. v. United States, 27 F. 3d 1545\n(1994) (en banc), and rightly did so in this case.\n   While I agree with much of JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s opin\nion concurring in the judgment, I do not agree with her\nconclusion that §1500 bars the Nation’s CFC action.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           3\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR joins the Court’s judgment (although\nnot the Court’s reasoning) because the “Tohono O’odham\nNation seeks in the [CFC] . . . some of the same relief on\nthe same facts as it does in its pending District Court\naction.” Ante, at 1 (emphasis added). But to the extent\nthat “the Nation’s two actions seek overlapping relief,”\nibid., a disposition less harsh would be in order. Ordinar\nily, when a plaintiff’s allegations and demands for relief\nare excessive, her complaint is not instantly dismissed on\nthat account. Instead, she may seek leave to trim her\npleading, permission a court “should freely give . . . when\njustice so requires.” Rule 15(a)(2) (CFC 2010). Cf. Rule\n54(c) (CFC 2010) (judgment, other than default, need not\nconform to demand for relief, but “should grant the relief\nto which each party is entitled”).\n   As JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR and the Nation recognize, to\navoid both duplication and the running of the statute of\nlimitations, the CFC suit could be stayed while the com\npanion District Court action proceeds. See ante, at 11;\nBrief for Respondent 35. That is a common practice when\na prior action is pending. See Pennsylvania R. Co. v.\nUnited States, 363 U. S. 202, 204–206 (1960) (instructing\nCourt of Claims to stay pending proceedings to enable\nlitigant to obtain District Court review of relevant agency\norder); Creppel v.
