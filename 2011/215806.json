Decided May 2, 2011 \n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   An Ohio jury convicted respondent Harry Mitts on two\ncounts of aggravated murder and two counts of attempted\nmurder. He was sentenced to death. At issue here is part\nof the jury instructions given during the penalty phase of\nMitts’s trial. The instructions, in pertinent part, were as\nfollows:\n    “[Y]ou must determine beyond a reasonable doubt\n    whether the aggravating circumstances, which [Mitts]\n    was found guilty of committing in the separate counts,\n    are sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors you\n    find are present in this case.\n       “When all 12 members of the jury find by proof be\n    yond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circum\n    stances in each separate count with which [Mitts] has\n    been found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigat\n    ing factors, if any, then you must return such finding\n    to the Court.\n       “I instruct you as a matter of law that if you make\n    such a finding, then you must recommend to the\n    Court that the sentence of death be imposed on\n    [Mitts].\n         .           .          .           .           .\n       “On the other hand, [if] after considering all the\n    relevant evidence raised at trial, the evidence and tes\n    timony received at this hearing and the arguments of\n    counsel, you find that the state of Ohio failed to prove\n2                      BOBBY v.

Spisak, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 7). See Mitts v. Bagley, 620 F. 3d 650, 652\n(CA6 2010) (noting that the “instructions in this case are\nthe same Ohio instructions that were given in” Spisak).\nThat case, like this one, involved review of a federal ha\nbeas petition under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). AEDPA provides, as rele\nvant here, that relief may not be granted unless the state\ncourt adjudication “resulted in a decision that was con\ntrary to . . . clearly established Federal law, as determined\nby the Supreme Court of the United States.” 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(d)(1).\n   In Spisak, we reversed a Court of Appeals decision that\nhad found these instructions invalid under our decision in\nMills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367 (1988). See 558 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 8–9). Up until our decision in Spisak,\nMitts had also pressed the claim that the instructions\nwere invalid under Mills. After Spisak rejected that\nclaim, the Court of Appeals in this case determined that\nthe instructions were contrary to our decision in Beck v.\nAlabama, 447 U. S. 625 (1980), and accordingly vacated\nMitts’s death sentence. See 620 F. 3d, at 658.\n   In Beck, we held that the death penalty may not be\nimposed “when the jury was not permitted to consider a\nverdict of guilt of a lesser included non-capital offense, and\nwhen the evidence would have supported such a verdict.”\n447 U. S., at 627 (internal quotation marks omitted). We\nexplained that such a scheme intolerably enhances the\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

Id., at 632, 642, 637. Be\ncause the scheme in Beck created a danger that the jury\nwould resolve any doubts in favor of conviction, we con\ncluded that it violated due process. See id., at 638, 643.\n   According to the Court of Appeals below, the penalty\nphase instructions given at Mitts’s trial—and the Supreme\nCourt of Ohio decision upholding their use—were “con\ntrary to” Beck, because they “interposed before the jury\nthe same false choice” that our holding in Beck prohibits.\n620 F. 3d, at 658, 657 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nReferring to the instructions as “acquittal-first,” the Court\nof Appeals stated that they impermissibly required the\njury to first decide whether to “acquit” Mitts of the death\npenalty before considering “mercy and some form of life\nimprisonment.” Id., at 656–657. Interpreting Beck to\nstand for the proposition that “a jury instruction violates\ndue process if it requires a mandatory death penalty sen\ntence that can only be avoided by an acquittal before the\njury has an opportunity to consider life imprisonment,” the\nCourt of Appeals concluded that the instructions given\nduring the penalty phase of Mitts’s trial unconstitutionally\n“deprived the jury of a meaningful opportunity to con\nsider” a life sentence. 620 F. 3d, at 658, 657 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   The instructions here are surely not invalid under our\n4                     BOBBY v. MITTS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ndecision in Beck. The concern addressed in Beck was “the\nrisk of an unwarranted conviction” created when the jury\nis forced to choose between finding the defendant guilty of\na capital offense and declaring him innocent of any\nwrongdoing. 447 U. S., at 637 (emphasis added); id., at\n638; see also Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U. S. 447, 455\n(1984) (explaining that the “goal of the Beck rule” is “to\neliminate the distortion of the factfinding process that is\ncreated when the jury is forced into an all-or-nothing\nchoice between capital murder and innocence”); Schad v.\nArizona, 501 U. S. 624, 646 (1991) (“Our fundamental\nconcern in Beck was that a jury convinced that the defen\ndant had committed some violent crime but not convinced\nthat he was guilty of a capital crime might nonetheless\nvote for a capital conviction if the only alternative was to\nset the defendant free with no punishment at all”).\n   The question here, however, concerns the penalty phase,\nnot the guilt phase, and we have already concluded that\nthe logic of Beck is not directly applicable to penalty phase\nproceedings. In California v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992 (1983),\nwe rejected an argument that Beck prohibited an instruc\ntion to “a capital sentencing jury regarding the Governor’s\npower to commute a sentence of life without possibility of\nparole.” 463 U. S., at 994, 1006–1009. In so doing, we\nnoted the “fundamental difference between the nature of\nthe guilt/innocence determination at issue in Beck and the\nnature of the life/death choice at the penalty phase.” Id.,\nat 1007. In light of that critical distinction, we observed\nthat “the concern of Beck regarding the risk of an unwar\nranted conviction is simply not directly translatable to the\ndeliberative process in which the capital jury engages in\ndetermining the appropriate penalty.” Id., at 1009; see\nalso Schad, supra, at 647 (stating that the “central con\ncern of Beck simply is not implicated” when the “jury was\nnot faced with an all-or-nothing choice between the offense\nof conviction (capital murder) and innocence”).\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)             5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\n   The jurors in Mitts’s case could not have plausibly\nthought that if they declined to recommend the death\npenalty Mitts would “escape all penalties for his alleged\nparticipation in the crime.” Beck, supra, at 629. They had\njust convicted him on two counts of aggravated murder\nand two counts of attempted murder. They were specifi\ncally instructed that if they did not find that the aggravat\ning factors outweighed the mitigating factors—and there\nfore did not recommend the death penalty—they would\nchoose from two life sentence options. There is accord\ningly no reason to believe that the jurors in this case,\nunlike the jurors in Beck, could have been improperly\ninfluenced by a fear that a decision short of death would\nhave resulted in Mitts walking free.\n   We all but decided the question presented here in\nSpisak itself. After rejecting the contention that the Ohio\ninstructions were contrary to Mills, we noted that “the\nCourt of Appeals found the jury instructions unconstitu\ntional for an additional reason, that the instructions ‘re\nquire[d] the jury to unanimously reject a death sentence\nbefore considering other sentencing alternatives.’ ” 558\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting Spisak v. Mitchell, 465\nF. 3d 684, 709 (CA6 2006)). That is essentially the Beck\nclaim presented here. See 620 F. 3d, at 658 (holding that\na “jury instruction violates due process if it requires a\nmandatory death penalty sentence that can only be\navoided by an acquittal before the jury has an opportunity\nto consider life imprisonment”). We rejected that claim in\nSpisak under AEDPA, noting that “[w]e have not . . .\npreviously held jury instructions unconstitutional for this\nreason.” 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9). Although neither\nthe parties nor the courts below in Spisak had cited Beck,\na separate concurrence in Spisak would have struck down\nthe instructions in reliance on that decision. See 558\nU.
