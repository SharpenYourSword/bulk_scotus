AL-KIDD\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n        No. 10–98. Argued March 2, 2011—Decided May 31, 2011\nRespondent al-Kidd alleges that, after the September 11th terrorist\n  attacks, then-Attorney General Ashcroft authorized federal officials\n  to detain terrorism suspects using the federal material-witness stat\n  ute, 18 U. S. C. §3144. He claims that this pretextual detention pol\n  icy led to his material-witness arrest as he was boarding a plane to\n  Saudi Arabia. To secure the warrant, federal officials had told a\n  Magistrate Judge that information “crucial” to Sami Omar al-\n  Hussayen’s prosecution would be lost if al-Kidd boarded his flight.\n  Prosecutors never called al-Kidd as a witness, and (as he alleges)\n  never meant to do so. Al-Kidd filed suit pursuant to Bivens v. Six\n  Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, challenging the con\n  stitutionality of Ashcroft’s alleged policy. The District Court denied\n  Ashcroft’s motion to dismiss on absolute and qualified immunity\n  grounds. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the Fourth\n  Amendment prohibits pretextual arrests absent probable cause of\n  criminal wrongdoing, and that Ashcroft could not claim qualified or\n  absolute immunity.\nHeld:\n    1. The objectively reasonable arrest and detention of a material\n witness pursuant to a validly obtained warrant cannot be challenged\n as unconstitutional on the basis of allegations that the arresting au\n thority had an improper motive. Pp. 3–9.\n       (a) Qualified immunity shields a government official from money\n damages unless (1) the official violated a statutory or constitutional\n right, and (2) that right was “clearly established” at the time of the\n challenged conduct. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818.\n Where, as here, a court considers both prongs of this inquiry, this\n2                         ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Court has the discretion to correct the lower court’s errors at each\n    step. P. 3.\n          (b) Whether a detention is reasonable under the Fourth Amend\n    ment “is predominantly an objective inquiry.” Indianapolis v. Ed\n    mond, 531 U. S. 32, 47. Courts ask whether “the circumstances,\n    viewed objectively, justify [the challenged] action.” Scott v. United\n    States, 436 U. S. 128, 138. Except for cases that involve special\n    needs, e.g., Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646, 653, or\n    administrative searches, e.g., Michigan v. Clifford, 464 U. S. 287,\n    294, this Court has almost uniformly rejected invitations to probe\n    subjective intent. The Court of Appeals was mistaken in believing\n    that Edmond established that “ ‘programmatic purpose’ is relevant to\n    Fourth Amendment analysis of programs of seizures without prob\n    able cause.” 580 F. 3d 949, 968. It was not the absence of probable\n    cause that triggered Edmond’s invalidating-purpose inquiry, but the\n    checkpoints’ failure to be based on “individualized suspicion.” 531\n    U. S., at 47. Here a neutral Magistrate Judge issued a warrant au\n    thorizing al-Kidd’s arrest, and the affidavit accompanying the war\n    rant application gave individualized reasons to believe that he was a\n    material witness who would soon disappear. A warrant based on in\n    dividualized suspicion grants more protection than existed in most of\n    this Court’s cases eschewing inquiries into intent, e.g., Whren v.\n    United States, 517 U. S. 806, 813, and Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 21–\n    22. Al-Kidd’s contrary, narrow reading of those cases is rejected. Be\n    cause he concedes that individualized suspicion supported the issu\n    ance of the material-witness arrest warrant; and does not assert that\n    his arrest would have been unconstitutional absent the alleged pre\n    text; there is no Fourth Amendment violation here. Pp. 3–9.\n       2. Ashcroft did not violate clearly established law and thus is enti\n    tled to qualified immunity. A Government official’s conduct violates\n    clearly established law when, at the time of the challenged conduct,\n    “[t]he contours of [a] right [are] sufficiently clear” that every “reason\n    able official would have understood that what he is doing violates\n    that right.” Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 640. Here, the as\n    serted constitutional right falls far short of that threshold. At the\n    time of al-Kidd’s arrest, not a single judicial opinion had held that\n    pretext could render an objectively reasonable arrest pursuant to a\n    material-witness warrant unconstitutional. The Ninth Circuit’s reli\n    ance on a District Court’s footnoted dictum, irrelevant cases from this\n    Court, and the Fourth Amendment’s broad purposes and history is\n    rejected. Because Ashcroft did not violate clearly established law, the\n    question whether he enjoys absolute immunity need not be ad\n    dressed.

ASHCROFT, PETITIONER v. ABDULLAH \n\n                  AL-KIDD \n\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [May 31, 2011] \n\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  We decide whether a former Attorney General enjoys\nimmunity from suit for allegedly authorizing federal\nprosecutors to obtain valid material-witness warrants for\ndetention of terrorism suspects whom they would other\nwise lack probable cause to arrest.\n                              I\n  The federal material-witness statute authorizes judges\nto “order the arrest of [a] person” whose testimony “is\nmaterial in a criminal proceeding . . . if it is shown that it\nmay become impracticable to secure the presence of the\nperson by subpoena.” 18 U. S. C. §3144. Material wit\nnesses enjoy the same constitutional right to pretrial\nrelease as other federal detainees, and federal law re\nquires release if their testimony “can adequately be\nsecured by deposition, and if further detention is not nec\nessary to prevent a failure of justice.” Ibid.\n  Because this case arises from a motion to dismiss, we\naccept as true the factual allegations in Abdullah al-Kidd’s\ncomplaint. The complaint alleges that, in the aftermath of\nthe September 11th terrorist attacks, then-Attorney Gen\n2                   ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\neral John Ashcroft authorized federal prosecutors and law\nenforcement officials to use the material-witness statute to\ndetain individuals with suspected ties to terrorist organi\nzations. It is alleged that federal officials had no intention\nof calling most of these individuals as witnesses, and that\nthey were detained, at Ashcroft’s direction, because fed\neral officials suspected them of supporting terrorism but\nlacked sufficient evidence to charge them with a crime.\n   It is alleged that this pretextual detention policy led\nto the material-witness arrest of al-Kidd, a native-born\nUnited States citizen. FBI agents apprehended him in\nMarch 2003 as he checked in for a flight to Saudi Arabia.\nTwo days earlier, federal officials had informed a Magis\ntrate Judge that, if al-Kidd boarded his flight, they be\nlieved information “crucial” to the prosecution of Sami\nOmar al-Hussayen would be lost. App. 64. Al-Kidd re\nmained in federal custody for 16 days and on supervised\nrelease until al-Hussayen’s trial concluded 14 months\nlater. Prosecutors never called him as a witness.\n   In March 2005, al-Kidd filed this Bivens action, see\nBivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S.\n388 (1971) to challenge the constitutionality of Ashcroft’s\nalleged policy; he also asserted several other claims not\nrelevant here against Ashcroft and others. Ashcroft filed a\nmotion to dismiss based on absolute and qualified immu\nnity, which the District Court denied. A divided panel of\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\naffirmed, holding that the Fourth Amendment prohibits\npretextual arrests absent probable cause of criminal\nwrongdoing, and that Ashcroft could not claim qualified or\nabsolute immunity. See 580 F. 3d 949 (2009).\n   Judge Bea dissented, 580 F. 3d, at 981, and eight judges\ndissented from the denial of rehearing en banc, see 598\nF. 3d 1129, 1137, 1142 (CA9 2010). We granted certiorari,\nsee 562 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011) \n          3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              II \n\n   Qualified immunity shields federal and state officials\nfrom money damages unless a plaintiff pleads facts show\ning (1) that the official violated a statutory or constitu\ntional right, and (2) that the right was “clearly estab\nlished” at the time of the challenged conduct. Harlow v.\nFitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982). We recently reaf\nfirmed that lower courts have discretion to decide which of\nthe two prongs of qualified-immunity analysis to tackle\nfirst. See Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 236 (2009).\n   Courts should think carefully before expending “scarce\njudicial resources” to resolve difficult and novel questions\nof constitutional or statutory interpretation that will “have\nno effect on the outcome of the case.” Id., at 236–237; see\nid., at 237–242. When, however, a Court of Appeals does\naddress both prongs of qualified-immunity analysis, we\nhave discretion to correct its errors at each step. Although\nnot necessary to reverse an erroneous judgment, doing so\nensures that courts do not insulate constitutional deci\nsions at the frontiers of the law from our review or inad\nvertently undermine the values qualified immunity seeks\nto promote. The former occurs when the constitutional\nlaw question is wrongly decided; the latter when what is\nnot clearly established is held to be so. In this case, the\nCourt of Appeals’ analysis at both steps of the qualified\nimmunity inquiry needs correction.\n                             A\n   The Fourth Amendment protects “[t]he right of the\npeople to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and\neffects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” An\narrest, of course, qualifies as a “seizure” of a “person”\nunder this provision, Dunaway v. New York, 442 U. S. 200,\n207–208 (1979), and so must be reasonable under the\ncircumstances. Al-Kidd does not assert that Government\nofficials would have acted unreasonably if they had used a\n4                  ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmaterial-witness warrant to arrest him for the purpose of\nsecuring his testimony for trial. See Brief for Respondent\n16–17; Tr. of Oral Arg. 20–22. He contests, however (and\nthe Court of Appeals here rejected), the reasonableness of\nusing the warrant to detain him as a suspected criminal.\n  Fourth Amendment reasonableness “is predominantly\nan objective inquiry.” Edmond, supra, at 47. We ask\nwhether “the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify\n[the challenged] action.” Scott v. United States, 436 U. S.\n128, 138 (1978). If so, that action was reasonable “what\never the subjective intent” motivating the relevant offi\ncials. Whren v. United States, 517 U. S. 806, 814 (1996).\nThis approach recognizes that the Fourth Amendment\nregulates conduct rather than thoughts, Bond v. United\nStates, 529 U. S. 334, 338, n. 2 (2000); and it promotes\nevenhanded, uniform enforcement of the law, Devenpeck v.\nAlford, 543 U. S. 146, 153–154 (2004).\n  Two “limited exception[s]” to this rule are our special\nneeds and administrative-search cases, where “actual\nmotivations” do matter. United States v. Knights, 534\nU. S. 112, 122 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nA judicial warrant and probable cause are not needed\nwhere the search or seizure is justified by “special needs,\nbeyond the normal need for law enforcement,” such as the\nneed to deter drug use in public schools, Vernonia School\nDist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646, 653 (1995) (internal\nquotation marks omitted), or the need to assure that\nrailroad employees engaged in train operations are not\nunder the influence of drugs or alcohol, Skinner v. Railway\nLabor Executives’ Assn., 489 U. S. 602 (1989); and where\nthe search or seizure is in execution of an administrative\nwarrant authorizing, for example, an inspection of fire\ndamaged premises to determine the cause, Michigan v.\nClifford, 464 U. S. 287, 294 (1984) (plurality opinion), or\nan inspection of residential premises to assure compliance\nwith a housing code, Camara v. Municipal Court of City\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand County of San Francisco, 387 U. S. 523, 535–538\n(1967). But those exceptions do not apply where the offi\ncer’s purpose is not to attend to the special needs or to the\ninvestigation for which the administrative inspection is\njustified. See Whren, supra, at 811–812. The Government\nseeks to justify the present arrest on the basis of a prop\nerly issued judicial warrant—so that the special-needs and\nadministrative-inspection cases cannot be the basis for a\npurpose inquiry here.\n   Apart from those cases, we have almost uniformly re\njected invitations to probe subjective intent. See Brigham\nCity v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 404 (2006). There is one\ncategory of exception, upon which the Court of Appeals\nprincipally relied. In Edmond, 531 U. S. 32, we held that\nthe Fourth Amendment could not condone suspicionless\nvehicle checkpoints set up for the purpose of detecting\nillegal narcotics. Although we had previously approved\nvehicle checkpoints set up for the purpose of keeping off\nthe road unlicensed drivers, Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S.\n648, 663 (1979), or alcohol-impaired drivers, Michigan\nDept. of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U. S. 444 (1990); and for\nthe purpose of interdicting those who illegally cross the\nborder, United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543\n(1976); we found the drug-detection purpose in Edmond\ninvalidating because it was “ultimately indistinguishable\nfrom the general interest in crime control,” 531 U. S., at\n44. In the Court of Appeals’ view, Edmond established\nthat “ ‘programmatic purpose’ is relevant to Fourth\nAmendment analysis of programs of seizures without\nprobable cause.” 580 F. 3d, at 968.\n    That was mistaken. It was not the absence of probable\ncause that triggered the invalidating-purpose inquiry in\nEdmond. To the contrary, Edmond explicitly said that it\nwould approve checkpoint stops for “general crime control\npurposes” that were based upon merely “some quantum of\nindividualized suspicion.” 531 U. S., at 47. Purpose was\n6                      ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nrelevant in Edmond because “programmatic purposes may\nbe relevant to the validity of Fourth Amendment intru\nsions undertaken pursuant to a general scheme without\nindividualized suspicion,” id., at 45–46 (emphasis added).1\n  Needless to say, warrantless, “suspicionless intrusions\npursuant to a general scheme,” id., at 47, are far removed\nfrom the facts of this case. A warrant issued by a neutral\nMagistrate Judge authorized al-Kidd’s arrest. The affida\nvit accompanying the warrant application (as al-Kidd\nconcedes) gave individualized reasons to believe that he\nwas a material witness and that he would soon disappear.\nThe existence of a judicial warrant based on individualized\nsuspicion takes this case outside the domain of not only\nour special-needs and administrative-search cases, but of\nEdmond as well.\n  A warrant based on individualized suspicion2 in fact\ngrants more protection against the malevolent and the\nincompetent than existed in most of our cases eschewing\ninquiries into intent. In Whren, 517 U. S., at 813, and\nDevenpeck, 543 U. S., at 153, we declined to probe the\nmotives behind seizures supported by probable cause but\nlacking a warrant approved by a detached magistrate.\n\n——————\n  1 The Court of Appeals also relied upon Ferguson v. Charleston, 532\n\nU. S. 67 (2001), which held unconstitutional a program of mandatory\ndrug testing of maternity patients. Like Edmond, that case involved a\ngeneral scheme of searches without individualized suspicion. 532 U. S.,\nat 77, n. 10.\n  2 JUSTICE GINSBURG suggests that our use of the word “suspicion” is\n\npeculiar because that word “ordinarily” means “that the person sus\npected has engaged in wrongdoing.” Post, at 3, n. 2 (opinion concurring\nin judgment). We disagree. No usage of the word is more common and\nidiomatic than a statement such as “I have a suspicion he knows\nsomething about the crime,” or even “I have a suspicion she is throwing\nme a surprise birthday party.” The many cases cited by JUSTICE\nGINSBURG, post, at 3, n. 2, which use the neutral word “suspicion” in\nconnection with wrongdoing, prove nothing except that searches and\nseizures for reasons other than suspected wrongdoing are rare.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nTerry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 21–22 (1968), and Knights, 534\nU. S., at 121–122, applied an objective standard to war\nrantless searches justified by a lesser showing of reason\nable suspicion.     We review even some suspicionless\nsearches for objective reasonableness. See Bond, 529\nU. S., at 335–336, 338, n. 2. If concerns about improper\nmotives and pretext do not justify subjective inquiries in\nthose less protective contexts, we see no reason to adopt\nthat inquiry here.\n  Al-Kidd would read our cases more narrowly. He as\nserts that Whren establishes that we ignore subjective\nintent only when there exists “probable cause to believe\nthat a violation of law has occurred,” 517 U. S., at 811—\nwhich was not the case here. That is a distortion of Whren.\nOur unanimous opinion held that we would not look\nbehind an objectively reasonable traffic stop to determine\nwhether racial profiling or a desire to investigate other\npotential crimes was the real motive. See id., at 810, 813.\nIn the course of our analysis, we dismissed Whren’s\nreliance on our inventory-search and administrative\ninspection cases by explaining that those cases do not\n“endors[e] the principle that ulterior motives can invali\ndate police conduct that is justifiable on the basis of prob\nable cause to believe that a violation of law has occurred,”\nid., at 811 But to say that ulterior motives do not in\nvalidate a search that is legitimate because of probable\ncause to believe a crime has occurred is not to say that it\ndoes invalidate all searches that are legitimate for other\nreasons.\n  “[O]nly an undiscerning reader,” ibid., would think\notherwise. We referred to probable cause to believe that a\nviolation of law had occurred because that was the legiti\nmating factor in the case at hand. But the analysis of\nour opinion swept broadly to reject inquiries into motive\ngenerally. See id., at 812–815. We remarked that our\nspecial-needs and administrative-inspection cases are un\n8                       ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nusual in their concern for pretext, and do nothing more\nthan “explain that the exemption from the need for prob\nable cause (and warrant), which is accorded to searches\nmade for the purpose of inventory or administrative regu\nlation, is not accorded to searches that are not made for\nthose purposes,” id., at 811–812. And our opinion empha\nsized that we had at that time (prior to Edmond) rejected\nevery request to examine subjective intent outside the\nnarrow context of special needs and administrative inspec\ntions. See 517 U. S., at 812. Thus, al-Kidd’s approach\nadds an “only” to a sentence plucked from the Whren\nopinion, and then elevates that sentence (as so revised)\nover the remainder of the opinion, and over the consistent\nholdings of our other cases.\n   Because al-Kidd concedes that individualized suspicion\nsupported the issuance of the material-witness arrest\nwarrant; and does not assert that his arrest would have\nbeen unconstitutional absent the alleged pretextual use of\nthe warrant; we find no Fourth Amendment violation.3\nEfficient4 and evenhanded application of the law demands\n——————\n    3 The\n        concerns of JUSTICES GINSBURG and SOTOMAYOR about the valid\nity of the warrant in this case are beside the point. See post, at 1–2\n(GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment); post, at 2 (SOTOMAYOR, J.,\nconcurring in judgment). The validity of the warrant is not our “open\ning assumption,” post, at 2 (GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment); it is\nthe premise of al-Kidd’s argument. Al-Kidd does not claim that\nAshcroft is liable because the FBI agents failed to obtain a valid war\nrant. He takes the validity of the warrant as a given, and argues that\nhis arrest nevertheless violated the Constitution because it was moti\nvated by an illegitimate purpose. His separate Fourth Amendment and\nstatutory claims against the FBI agents who sought the material\nwitness warrant, which are the focus of both concurrences, are not\nbefore us.\n   4 We may note in passing that al-Kidd alleges that the Attorney Gen\n\neral authorized the use of material-witness warrants for detention of\nsuspected terrorists, but not that he forbade the use of those warrants\nto detain material witnesses. Which means that if al-Kidd’s inquiry\ninto actual motive is accepted, mere determination that the Attorney\n                    Cite as: 563 U.

Creigh\nton, 483 U. S. 635, 640 (1987). We do not require a case\ndirectly on point, but existing precedent must have placed\nthe statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.\nSee ibid.; Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 341 (1986). The\nconstitutional question in this case falls far short of that\nthreshold.\n   At the time of al-Kidd’s arrest, not a single judicial\nopinion had held that pretext could render an objectively\nreasonable arrest pursuant to a material-witness warrant\nunconstitutional. A district-court opinion had suggested,\nin a footnoted dictum devoid of supporting citation, that\nusing such a warrant for preventive detention of suspects\n“is an illegitimate use of the statute”—implying (we accept\nfor the sake of argument) that the detention would there\nfore be unconstitutional. United States v. Awadallah, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2518594\"><a href=\"/opinion/2518594/united-states-v-awadallah/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 77, n. 28 (SDNY 2002). The Court of\nAppeals thought nothing could “have given John Ashcroft\nfair[er] warning” that his conduct violated the Fourth\nAmendment, because the footnoted dictum “call[ed] out\nAshcroft by name”! 580 F. 3d, at 972–973 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted; emphasis added). We will indulge the\nassumption (though it does not seem to us realistic) that\nJustice Department lawyers bring to the Attorney Gen\n—————— \n\nGeneral promulgated the alleged policy would not alone decide the case. \n\nAl-Kidd would also have to prove that the officials who sought his \n\nmaterial-arrest warrant were motivated by Ashcroft’s policy, not by a\n\ndesire to call al-Kidd as a witness. \n\n10                  ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\neral’s personal attention all district judges’ footnoted\nspeculations that boldly “call him out by name.” On that\nassumption, would it prove that for him (and for him\nonly?) it became clearly established that pretextual use of\nthe material-witness statute rendered the arrest unconsti\ntutional? An extraordinary proposition. Even a district\njudge’s ipse dixit of a holding is not “controlling authority”\nin any jurisdiction, much less in the entire United States;\nand his ipse dixit of a footnoted dictum falls far short of\nwhat is necessary absent controlling authority: a robust\n“consensus of cases of persuasive authority.” Wilson v.\nLayne, 526 U. S. 603, 617 (1999).\n   The Court of Appeals’ other cases “clearly establishing”\nthe constitutional violation are, of course, those we re\njected as irrelevant in our discussion of whether there was\nany constitutional violation at all. And the Court of Ap\npeals’ reference to those cases here makes the same error\nof assuming that purpose is only disregarded when there\nis probable cause to suspect a violation of law.\n   The Court of Appeals also found clearly established law\nlurking in the broad “history and purposes of the Fourth\nAmendment.” 580 F. 3d, at 971. We have repeatedly told\ncourts—and the Ninth Circuit in particular, see Brosseau\nv. Haugen, 543 U. S. 194, 198–199 (2004) (per curiam)—\nnot to define clearly established law at a high level of\ngenerality. See also, e.g., Wilson, supra, at 615; Anderson,\nsupra, at 639–640; cf. Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 236\n(1990). The general proposition, for example, that an\nunreasonable search or seizure violates the Fourth\nAmendment is of little help in determining whether the\nviolative nature of particular conduct is clearly estab\nlished. See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 201–202 (2001);\nWilson, supra, at 615.\n   The same is true of the Court of Appeals’ broad histori\ncal assertions. The Fourth Amendment was a response to\nthe English Crown’s use of general warrants, which often\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nallowed royal officials to search and seize whatever and\nwhomever they pleased while investigating crimes or\naffronts to the Crown. See Stanford v. Texas, 379 U. S.\n476, 481–485 (1965). According to the Court of Appeals,\nAshcroft should have seen that a pretextual warrant\nsimilarly “gut[s] the substantive protections of the Fourth\nAmendmen[t]” and allows the State “to arrest upon the\nexecutive’s mere suspicion.” 580 F. 3d, at 972.\n   Ashcroft must be forgiven for missing the parallel,\nwhich escapes us as well. The principal evil of the general\nwarrant was addressed by the Fourth Amendment’s par\nticularity requirement, Stanford, supra, at 485, which\nAshcroft’s alleged policy made no effort to evade. The\nwarrant authorizing al-Kidd’s arrest named al-Kidd and\nonly al-Kidd. It might be argued, perhaps, that when, in\nresponse to the English abuses, the Fourth Amendment\nsaid that warrants could only issue “on probable cause” it\nmeant only probable cause to suspect a violation of law,\nand not probable cause to believe that the individual\nnamed in the warrant was a material witness. But that\nwould make all arrests pursuant to material-witness\nwarrants unconstitutional, whether pretextual or not—\nand that is not the position taken by al-Kidd in this case.\n   While featuring a District Court’s footnoted dictum, the\nCourt of Appeals made no mention of this Court’s affirma\ntion in Edmond of the “predominan[t]” rule that reason\nableness is an objective inquiry, 531 U. S., at 47. Nor did it\nmention Whren’s and Knights’ statements that subjective\nintent mattered in a very limited subset of our Fourth\nAmendment cases; or Terry’s objective evaluation of inves\ntigatory searches premised on reasonable suspicion rather\nthan probable cause; or Bond’s objective evaluation of a\nsuspicionless investigatory search. The Court of Appeals\nseems to have cherry-picked the aspects of our opinions\nthat gave colorable support to the proposition that the un\nconstitutionality of the action here was clearly established.\n12                  ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Qualified immunity gives government officials breathing\nroom to make reasonable but mistaken judgments about\nopen legal questions. When properly applied, it protects\n“all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly\nviolate the law.” Malley, 475 U. S., at 341. Ashcroft de\nserves neither label, not least because eight Court of\nAppeals judges agreed with his judgment in a case of first\nimpression. See Wilson, supra, at 618. He deserves quali\nfied immunity even assuming—contrafactually—that his\nalleged detention policy violated the Fourth Amendment.\n                        *    *     *\n   We hold that an objectively reasonable arrest and deten\ntion of a material witness pursuant to a validly obtained\nwarrant cannot be challenged as unconstitutional on the\nbasis of allegations that the arresting authority had an\nimproper motive. Because Ashcroft did not violate clearly\nestablished law, we need not address the more difficult\nquestion whether he enjoys absolute immunity. The\njudgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case\nis remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

In holding that\nthe Attorney General could be liable for damages based on\nan unprecedented constitutional rule, the Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit disregarded the purposes of the doc\ntrine of qualified immunity. This concurring opinion makes\ntwo additional observations.\n                               I\n   The Court’s holding is limited to the arguments pre\nsented by the parties and leaves unresolved whether the\nGovernment’s use of the Material Witness Statute in this\ncase was lawful. See ante, at 8 (noting that al-Kidd “does\nnot assert that his arrest would have been unconstitu\ntional absent the alleged pretextual use of the warrant”).\nUnder the statute, a Magistrate Judge may issue a war\nrant to arrest someone as a material witness upon a show\ning by affidavit that “the testimony of a person is material\nin a criminal proceeding” and “that it may become imprac\nticable to secure the presence of the person by subpoena.”\n18 U. S. C. §3144. The scope of the statute’s lawful\nauthorization is uncertain. For example, a law-abiding\ncitizen might observe a crime during the days or weeks\n2                  ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nbefore a scheduled flight abroad. It is unclear whether\nthose facts alone might allow police to obtain a material\nwitness warrant on the ground that it “may become im\npracticable” to secure the person’s presence by subpoena.\nIbid. The question becomes more difficult if one further\nassumes the traveler would be willing to testify if asked;\nand more difficult still if one supposes that authorities\ndelay obtaining or executing the warrant until the traveler\nhas arrived at the airport. These possibilities resemble\nthe facts in this case. See ante, at 2.\n   In considering these issues, it is important to bear in\nmind that the Material Witness Statute might not provide\nfor the issuance of warrants within the meaning of the\nFourth Amendment’s Warrant Clause. The typical arrest\nwarrant is based on probable cause that the arrestee has\ncommitted a crime; but that is not the standard for the\nissuance of warrants under the Material Witness Statute.\nSee ante, at 11 (reserving the possibility that probable\ncause for purposes of the Fourth Amendment’s Warrant\nClause means “only probable cause to suspect a violation\nof law”). If material witness warrants do not qualify as\n“Warrants” under the Fourth Amendment, then material\nwitness arrests might still be governed by the Fourth\nAmendment’s separate reasonableness requirement for\nseizures of the person. See United States v. Watson, 423\nU. S. 411 (1976). Given the difficulty of these issues, the\nCourt is correct to address only the legal theory put before\nit, without further exploring when material witness ar\nrests might be consistent with statutory and constitutional\nrequirements.\n                             II\n   The fact that the Attorney General holds a high office in\nthe Government must inform what law is clearly estab\nlished for the purposes of this case. Mitchell v. Forsyth,\n472 U. S. 511, 525 (1985). Some federal officers perform\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

They\n“reasonably can anticipate when their conduct may give\nrise to liability for damages” and so are expected to adjust\ntheir behavior in accordance with local precedent. Davis\nv. Scherer, 468 U. S. 183, 195 (1984); see also Anderson v.\nCreighton, 483 U. S. 635, 639–640 (1987). In contrast the\nAttorney General occupies a national office and so sets\npolicies implemented in many jurisdictions throughout the\ncountry. The official with responsibilities in many juris\ndictions may face ambiguous and sometimes inconsistent\nsources of decisional law. While it may be clear that one\nCourt of Appeals has approved a certain course of conduct,\nother Courts of Appeals may have disapproved it, or at\nleast reserved the issue.\n   When faced with inconsistent legal rules in different\njurisdictions, national officeholders should be given some\ndeference for qualified immunity purposes, at least if they\nimplement policies consistent with the governing law of\nthe jurisdiction where the action is taken. As we have\nexplained, qualified immunity is lost when plaintiffs point\neither to “cases of controlling authority in their jurisdic\ntion at the time of the incident” or to “a consensus of cases\nof persuasive authority such that a reasonable officer\ncould not have believed that his actions were lawful.”\nWilson v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 617 (1999); see also ante,\nat 9–10. These standards ensure the officer has “fair and\nclear warning” of what the Constitution requires. United\nStates v. Lanier, 520 U. S. 259, 271 (1997).\n   A national officeholder intent on retaining qualified\nimmunity need not abide by the most stringent standard\nadopted anywhere in the United States. And the national\nofficeholder need not guess at when a relatively small set\nof appellate precedents have established a binding legal\nrule. If national officeholders were subject to personal\nliability whenever they confronted disagreement among\n4                   ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nappellate courts, those officers would be deterred from full\nuse of their legal authority. The consequences of that\ndeterrence must counsel caution by the Judicial Branch,\nparticularly in the area of national security. See Ashcroft\nv. Iqbal, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 21). Fur\nthermore, too expansive a view of “clearly established law”\nwould risk giving local judicial determinations the effect of\nrules with de facto national significance, contrary to the\nnormal process of ordered appellate review.\n  The proceedings in this case illustrate these concerns.\nThe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit appears to\nhave reasoned that a Federal District Court sitting in New\nYork had authority to establish a legal rule binding on\nthe Attorney General and, therefore, on federal law\nenforcement operations conducted nationwide. See 580\nF. 3d 949, 972–973 (2009). Indeed, this case involves a\nmaterial witness warrant issued in Boise, Idaho, and an\narrest near Washington, D. C. Of course, district court\ndecisions are not precedential to this extent. Ante, at 9–\n10. But nationwide security operations should not have to\ngrind to a halt even when an appellate court finds those\noperations unconstitutional. The doctrine of qualified\nimmunity does not so constrain national officeholders\nentrusted with urgent responsibilities.\n                    Cite as: 563 U.

But I join JUSTICE\nSOTOMAYOR in objecting to the Court’s disposition of al-\nKidd’s Fourth Amendment claim on the merits; as she\nobserves, post, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment), that\nclaim involves novel and trying questions that will “have\nno effect on the outcome of th[is] case.” Pearson v. Calla\nhan, 555 U. S. 223, 236–237 (2009).\n  In addressing al-Kidd’s Fourth Amendment claim\nagainst Ashcroft, the Court assumes at the outset the\nexistence of a validly obtained material witness warrant.\nAnte, at 1, 12. That characterization is puzzling. See post,\nat 2 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.).1 Is a warrant “validly\n\n——————\n   1 Nowhere in al-Kidd’s complaint is there any concession that the\n\nwarrant gained by the FBI agents was validly obtained.

In addition,\nthe affidavit misrepresented that al-Kidd was about to\ntake a one-way flight to Saudi Arabia, with a first-class\nticket costing approximately $5,000; in fact, al-Kidd had a\nround-trip, coach-class ticket that cost $1,700.2 Given\nthese omissions and misrepresentations, there is strong\ncause to question the Court’s opening assumption—a valid\nmaterial-witness warrant—and equally strong reason to\nconclude that a merits determination was neither neces\nsary nor proper.3\n——————\n   2 Judicial officers asked to issue material witness warrants must\n\ndetermine whether the affidavit supporting the application shows that\n“the testimony of a person is material in a criminal proceeding” and\nthat “it may become impracticable to secure the presence of the person\nby subpoena.” 18 U. S. C. §3144. Even if these conditions are met,\nissuance of the warrant is discretionary. Ibid. (“judicial officer may\norder the arrest of the person” (emphasis added)). Al-Kidd’s experience\nillustrates the importance of vigilant exercise of this checking role by\nthe judicial officer to whom the warrant application is presented.\n   The affidavit used to secure al-Kidd’s detention was spare; it did not\nstate with particularity the information al-Kidd purportedly possessed,\nnor did it specify how al-Kidd’s knowledge would be material to Sami\nOmar al-Hussayen’s prosecution. As to impracticability, the affidavit\ncontained only this unelaborated statement: “It is believed that if Al-\nKidd travels to Saudi Arabia, the United States Government will be\nunable to secure his presence at trial via subpoena.” App. 64.

See Black’s Law Dictionary\n1585 (9th ed. 2009) (defining “reasonable suspicion” to mean “[a] par\nticularized and objective basis, supported by specific and articulable\nfacts, for suspecting a person of criminal activity”).

In addition to the questions JUSTICE\nKENNEDY poses, and even if the initial material witness\nclassification had been proper, what even arguably legiti\nmate basis could there be for the harsh custodial condi\ntions to which al-Kidd was subjected: Ostensibly held only\nto secure his testimony, al-Kidd was confined in three\ndifferent detention centers during his 16 days’ incarcera\ntion, kept in high-security cells lit 24 hours a day, strip\nsearched and subjected to body-cavity inspections on more\nthan one occasion, and handcuffed and shackled about his\nwrists, legs, and waist.

I\ncannot join the majority’s opinion, however, because it\nunnecessarily “resolve[s] [a] difficult and novel questio[n]\nof constitutional . . . interpretation that will ‘have no effect\non the outcome of the case.’ ” Ante, at 3 (quoting Pearson\nv. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 237 (2009)).\n   Whether the Fourth Amendment permits the pretextual\nuse of a material witness warrant for preventive detention\nof an individual whom the Government has no intention\nof using at trial is, in my view, a closer question than\nthe majority’s opinion suggests. Although the majority\nis correct that a government official’s subjective intent is\ngenerally “irrelevant in determining whether that officer’s\nactions violate the Fourth Amendment,” Bond v. United\nStates, 529 U. S. 334, 338, n. 2 (2000), none of our prior\ncases recognizing that principle involved prolonged deten­\ntion of an individual without probable cause to believe he\nhad committed any criminal offense. We have never\nconsidered whether an official’s subjective intent matters\nfor purposes of the Fourth Amendment in that novel con­\ntext, and we need not and should not resolve that question\n2                   ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD\n\n             SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nin this case. All Members of the Court agree that, what­\never the merits of the underlying Fourth Amendment\nquestion, Ashcroft did not violate clearly established law.\n   The majority’s constitutional ruling is a narrow one pre­\nmised on the existence of a “valid material-witness war­\nran[t],” ante, at 1—a premise that, at the very least, is\nquestionable in light of the allegations set forth in al-\nKidd’s complaint. Based on those allegations, it is not at\nall clear that it would have been “impracticable to secure\n[al-Kidd’s] presence . . . by subpoena” or that his testimony\ncould not “adequately be secured by deposition.” 18\nU. S. C. §3144; see First Amended Complaint in No. 05–\n093–EJL, ¶55, App. 26 (“Mr. al-Kidd would have complied\nwith a subpoena had he been issued one or agreed to a\ndeposition”). Nor is it clear that the affidavit supporting\nthe warrant was sufficient; its failure to disclose that the\nGovernment had no intention of using al-Kidd as a wit­\nness at trial may very well have rendered the affidavit\ndeliberately false and misleading. Cf. Franks v. Delaware,\n438 U. S. 154, 155–156 (1978). The majority assumes\naway these factual difficulties, but in my view, they point\nto the artificiality of the way the Fourth Amendment\nquestion has been presented to this Court and provide\nfurther reason to avoid rendering an unnecessary holding\non the constitutional question.\n   I also join Part I of JUSTICE KENNEDY’s concurring\nopinion. As that opinion makes clear, this case does not\npresent an occasion to address the proper scope of the\nmaterial witness statute or its constitutionality as applied\nin this case. Indeed, nothing in the majority’s opinion\ntoday should be read as placing this Court’s imprimatur\non the actions taken by the Government against al-Kidd.\nAnte, at 1 (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (“The Court’s holding\nis limited to the arguments presented by the parties and\nleaves unresolved whether the Government’s use of the\nMaterial Witness Statute in this case was lawful”).\n</pre>", "id": 217703, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2011/05/31/Ashcroft_v._al-Kidd.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2010                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

AL-KIDD\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n        No. 10–98. Argued March 2, 2011—Decided May 31, 2011\nRespondent al-Kidd alleges that, after the September 11th terrorist\n  attacks, then-Attorney General Ashcroft authorized federal officials\n  to detain terrorism suspects using the federal material-witness stat\n  ute, 18 U. S. C. §3144. He claims that this pretextual detention pol\n  icy led to his material-witness arrest as he was boarding a plane to\n  Saudi Arabia. To secure the warrant, federal officials had told a\n  Magistrate Judge that information “crucial” to Sami Omar al-\n  Hussayen’s prosecution would be lost if al-Kidd boarded his flight.\n  Prosecutors never called al-Kidd as a witness, and (as he alleges)\n  never meant to do so. Al-Kidd filed suit pursuant to Bivens v. Six\n  Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, challenging the con\n  stitutionality of Ashcroft’s alleged policy. The District Court denied\n  Ashcroft’s motion to dismiss on absolute and qualified immunity\n  grounds. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the Fourth\n  Amendment prohibits pretextual arrests absent probable cause of\n  criminal wrongdoing, and that Ashcroft could not claim qualified or\n  absolute immunity.\nHeld:\n    1. The objectively reasonable arrest and detention of a material\n witness pursuant to a validly obtained warrant cannot be challenged\n as unconstitutional on the basis of allegations that the arresting au\n thority had an improper motive. Pp. 3–9.\n       (a) Qualified immunity shields a government official from money\n damages unless (1) the official violated a statutory or constitutional\n right, and (2) that right was “clearly established” at the time of the\n challenged conduct. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818.\n Where, as here, a court considers both prongs of this inquiry, this\n2                         ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Court has the discretion to correct the lower court’s errors at each\n    step. P. 3.\n          (b) Whether a detention is reasonable under the Fourth Amend\n    ment “is predominantly an objective inquiry.” Indianapolis v. Ed\n    mond, 531 U. S. 32, 47. Courts ask whether “the circumstances,\n    viewed objectively, justify [the challenged] action.” Scott v. United\n    States, 436 U. S. 128, 138. Except for cases that involve special\n    needs, e.g., Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646, 653, or\n    administrative searches, e.g., Michigan v. Clifford, 464 U. S. 287,\n    294, this Court has almost uniformly rejected invitations to probe\n    subjective intent. The Court of Appeals was mistaken in believing\n    that Edmond established that “ ‘programmatic purpose’ is relevant to\n    Fourth Amendment analysis of programs of seizures without prob\n    able cause.” 580 F. 3d 949, 968. It was not the absence of probable\n    cause that triggered Edmond’s invalidating-purpose inquiry, but the\n    checkpoints’ failure to be based on “individualized suspicion.” 531\n    U. S., at 47. Here a neutral Magistrate Judge issued a warrant au\n    thorizing al-Kidd’s arrest, and the affidavit accompanying the war\n    rant application gave individualized reasons to believe that he was a\n    material witness who would soon disappear. A warrant based on in\n    dividualized suspicion grants more protection than existed in most of\n    this Court’s cases eschewing inquiries into intent, e.g., Whren v.\n    United States, 517 U. S. 806, 813, and Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 21–\n    22. Al-Kidd’s contrary, narrow reading of those cases is rejected. Be\n    cause he concedes that individualized suspicion supported the issu\n    ance of the material-witness arrest warrant; and does not assert that\n    his arrest would have been unconstitutional absent the alleged pre\n    text; there is no Fourth Amendment violation here. Pp. 3–9.\n       2. Ashcroft did not violate clearly established law and thus is enti\n    tled to qualified immunity. A Government official’s conduct violates\n    clearly established law when, at the time of the challenged conduct,\n    “[t]he contours of [a] right [are] sufficiently clear” that every “reason\n    able official would have understood that what he is doing violates\n    that right.” Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 640. Here, the as\n    serted constitutional right falls far short of that threshold. At the\n    time of al-Kidd’s arrest, not a single judicial opinion had held that\n    pretext could render an objectively reasonable arrest pursuant to a\n    material-witness warrant unconstitutional. The Ninth Circuit’s reli\n    ance on a District Court’s footnoted dictum, irrelevant cases from this\n    Court, and the Fourth Amendment’s broad purposes and history is\n    rejected. Because Ashcroft did not violate clearly established law, the\n    question whether he enjoys absolute immunity need not be ad\n    dressed.

S. C. §3144. Material wit\nnesses enjoy the same constitutional right to pretrial\nrelease as other federal detainees, and federal law re\nquires release if their testimony “can adequately be\nsecured by deposition, and if further detention is not nec\nessary to prevent a failure of justice.” Ibid.\n  Because this case arises from a motion to dismiss, we\naccept as true the factual allegations in Abdullah al-Kidd’s\ncomplaint. The complaint alleges that, in the aftermath of\nthe September 11th terrorist attacks, then-Attorney Gen\n2                   ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\neral John Ashcroft authorized federal prosecutors and law\nenforcement officials to use the material-witness statute to\ndetain individuals with suspected ties to terrorist organi\nzations. It is alleged that federal officials had no intention\nof calling most of these individuals as witnesses, and that\nthey were detained, at Ashcroft’s direction, because fed\neral officials suspected them of supporting terrorism but\nlacked sufficient evidence to charge them with a crime.\n   It is alleged that this pretextual detention policy led\nto the material-witness arrest of al-Kidd, a native-born\nUnited States citizen. FBI agents apprehended him in\nMarch 2003 as he checked in for a flight to Saudi Arabia.\nTwo days earlier, federal officials had informed a Magis\ntrate Judge that, if al-Kidd boarded his flight, they be\nlieved information “crucial” to the prosecution of Sami\nOmar al-Hussayen would be lost. App. 64. Al-Kidd re\nmained in federal custody for 16 days and on supervised\nrelease until al-Hussayen’s trial concluded 14 months\nlater. Prosecutors never called him as a witness.\n   In March 2005, al-Kidd filed this Bivens action, see\nBivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S.\n388 (1971) to challenge the constitutionality of Ashcroft’s\nalleged policy; he also asserted several other claims not\nrelevant here against Ashcroft and others. Ashcroft filed a\nmotion to dismiss based on absolute and qualified immu\nnity, which the District Court denied. A divided panel of\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\naffirmed, holding that the Fourth Amendment prohibits\npretextual arrests absent probable cause of criminal\nwrongdoing, and that Ashcroft could not claim qualified or\nabsolute immunity. See 580 F. 3d 949 (2009).\n   Judge Bea dissented, 580 F. 3d, at 981, and eight judges\ndissented from the denial of rehearing en banc, see 598\nF. 3d 1129, 1137, 1142 (CA9 2010). We granted certiorari,\nsee 562 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011) \n          3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              II \n\n   Qualified immunity shields federal and state officials\nfrom money damages unless a plaintiff pleads facts show\ning (1) that the official violated a statutory or constitu\ntional right, and (2) that the right was “clearly estab\nlished” at the time of the challenged conduct. Harlow v.\nFitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982). We recently reaf\nfirmed that lower courts have discretion to decide which of\nthe two prongs of qualified-immunity analysis to tackle\nfirst. See Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 236 (2009).\n   Courts should think carefully before expending “scarce\njudicial resources” to resolve difficult and novel questions\nof constitutional or statutory interpretation that will “have\nno effect on the outcome of the case.” Id., at 236–237; see\nid., at 237–242. When, however, a Court of Appeals does\naddress both prongs of qualified-immunity analysis, we\nhave discretion to correct its errors at each step. Although\nnot necessary to reverse an erroneous judgment, doing so\nensures that courts do not insulate constitutional deci\nsions at the frontiers of the law from our review or inad\nvertently undermine the values qualified immunity seeks\nto promote. The former occurs when the constitutional\nlaw question is wrongly decided; the latter when what is\nnot clearly established is held to be so. In this case, the\nCourt of Appeals’ analysis at both steps of the qualified\nimmunity inquiry needs correction.\n                             A\n   The Fourth Amendment protects “[t]he right of the\npeople to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and\neffects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” An\narrest, of course, qualifies as a “seizure” of a “person”\nunder this provision, Dunaway v. New York, 442 U. S. 200,\n207–208 (1979), and so must be reasonable under the\ncircumstances. Al-Kidd does not assert that Government\nofficials would have acted unreasonably if they had used a\n4                  ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmaterial-witness warrant to arrest him for the purpose of\nsecuring his testimony for trial. See Brief for Respondent\n16–17; Tr. of Oral Arg. 20–22. He contests, however (and\nthe Court of Appeals here rejected), the reasonableness of\nusing the warrant to detain him as a suspected criminal.\n  Fourth Amendment reasonableness “is predominantly\nan objective inquiry.” Edmond, supra, at 47. We ask\nwhether “the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify\n[the challenged] action.” Scott v. United States, 436 U. S.\n128, 138 (1978). If so, that action was reasonable “what\never the subjective intent” motivating the relevant offi\ncials. Whren v. United States, 517 U. S. 806, 814 (1996).\nThis approach recognizes that the Fourth Amendment\nregulates conduct rather than thoughts, Bond v. United\nStates, 529 U. S. 334, 338, n. 2 (2000); and it promotes\nevenhanded, uniform enforcement of the law, Devenpeck v.\nAlford, 543 U. S. 146, 153–154 (2004).\n  Two “limited exception[s]” to this rule are our special\nneeds and administrative-search cases, where “actual\nmotivations” do matter. United States v. Knights, 534\nU. S. 112, 122 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nA judicial warrant and probable cause are not needed\nwhere the search or seizure is justified by “special needs,\nbeyond the normal need for law enforcement,” such as the\nneed to deter drug use in public schools, Vernonia School\nDist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646, 653 (1995) (internal\nquotation marks omitted), or the need to assure that\nrailroad employees engaged in train operations are not\nunder the influence of drugs or alcohol, Skinner v. Railway\nLabor Executives’ Assn., 489 U. S. 602 (1989); and where\nthe search or seizure is in execution of an administrative\nwarrant authorizing, for example, an inspection of fire\ndamaged premises to determine the cause, Michigan v.\nClifford, 464 U. S. 287, 294 (1984) (plurality opinion), or\nan inspection of residential premises to assure compliance\nwith a housing code, Camara v. Municipal Court of City\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand County of San Francisco, 387 U. S. 523, 535–538\n(1967). But those exceptions do not apply where the offi\ncer’s purpose is not to attend to the special needs or to the\ninvestigation for which the administrative inspection is\njustified. See Whren, supra, at 811–812. The Government\nseeks to justify the present arrest on the basis of a prop\nerly issued judicial warrant—so that the special-needs and\nadministrative-inspection cases cannot be the basis for a\npurpose inquiry here.\n   Apart from those cases, we have almost uniformly re\njected invitations to probe subjective intent. See Brigham\nCity v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 404 (2006). There is one\ncategory of exception, upon which the Court of Appeals\nprincipally relied. In Edmond, 531 U. S. 32, we held that\nthe Fourth Amendment could not condone suspicionless\nvehicle checkpoints set up for the purpose of detecting\nillegal narcotics. Although we had previously approved\nvehicle checkpoints set up for the purpose of keeping off\nthe road unlicensed drivers, Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S.\n648, 663 (1979), or alcohol-impaired drivers, Michigan\nDept. of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U. S. 444 (1990); and for\nthe purpose of interdicting those who illegally cross the\nborder, United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543\n(1976); we found the drug-detection purpose in Edmond\ninvalidating because it was “ultimately indistinguishable\nfrom the general interest in crime control,” 531 U. S., at\n44. In the Court of Appeals’ view, Edmond established\nthat “ ‘programmatic purpose’ is relevant to Fourth\nAmendment analysis of programs of seizures without\nprobable cause.” 580 F. 3d, at 968.\n    That was mistaken. It was not the absence of probable\ncause that triggered the invalidating-purpose inquiry in\nEdmond. To the contrary, Edmond explicitly said that it\nwould approve checkpoint stops for “general crime control\npurposes” that were based upon merely “some quantum of\nindividualized suspicion.” 531 U. S., at 47. Purpose was\n6                      ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nrelevant in Edmond because “programmatic purposes may\nbe relevant to the validity of Fourth Amendment intru\nsions undertaken pursuant to a general scheme without\nindividualized suspicion,” id., at 45–46 (emphasis added).1\n  Needless to say, warrantless, “suspicionless intrusions\npursuant to a general scheme,” id., at 47, are far removed\nfrom the facts of this case. A warrant issued by a neutral\nMagistrate Judge authorized al-Kidd’s arrest. The affida\nvit accompanying the warrant application (as al-Kidd\nconcedes) gave individualized reasons to believe that he\nwas a material witness and that he would soon disappear.\nThe existence of a judicial warrant based on individualized\nsuspicion takes this case outside the domain of not only\nour special-needs and administrative-search cases, but of\nEdmond as well.\n  A warrant based on individualized suspicion2 in fact\ngrants more protection against the malevolent and the\nincompetent than existed in most of our cases eschewing\ninquiries into intent. In Whren, 517 U. S., at 813, and\nDevenpeck, 543 U. S., at 153, we declined to probe the\nmotives behind seizures supported by probable cause but\nlacking a warrant approved by a detached magistrate.\n\n——————\n  1 The Court of Appeals also relied upon Ferguson v. Charleston, 532\n\nU. S. 67 (2001), which held unconstitutional a program of mandatory\ndrug testing of maternity patients. Like Edmond, that case involved a\ngeneral scheme of searches without individualized suspicion. 532 U. S.,\nat 77, n. 10.\n  2 JUSTICE GINSBURG suggests that our use of the word “suspicion” is\n\npeculiar because that word “ordinarily” means “that the person sus\npected has engaged in wrongdoing.” Post, at 3, n. 2 (opinion concurring\nin judgment). We disagree. No usage of the word is more common and\nidiomatic than a statement such as “I have a suspicion he knows\nsomething about the crime,” or even “I have a suspicion she is throwing\nme a surprise birthday party.” The many cases cited by JUSTICE\nGINSBURG, post, at 3, n. 2, which use the neutral word “suspicion” in\nconnection with wrongdoing, prove nothing except that searches and\nseizures for reasons other than suspected wrongdoing are rare.\n                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nTerry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 21–22 (1968), and Knights, 534\nU. S., at 121–122, applied an objective standard to war\nrantless searches justified by a lesser showing of reason\nable suspicion.     We review even some suspicionless\nsearches for objective reasonableness. See Bond, 529\nU. S., at 335–336, 338, n. 2. If concerns about improper\nmotives and pretext do not justify subjective inquiries in\nthose less protective contexts, we see no reason to adopt\nthat inquiry here.\n  Al-Kidd would read our cases more narrowly. He as\nserts that Whren establishes that we ignore subjective\nintent only when there exists “probable cause to believe\nthat a violation of law has occurred,” 517 U. S., at 811—\nwhich was not the case here. That is a distortion of Whren.\nOur unanimous opinion held that we would not look\nbehind an objectively reasonable traffic stop to determine\nwhether racial profiling or a desire to investigate other\npotential crimes was the real motive. See id., at 810, 813.\nIn the course of our analysis, we dismissed Whren’s\nreliance on our inventory-search and administrative\ninspection cases by explaining that those cases do not\n“endors[e] the principle that ulterior motives can invali\ndate police conduct that is justifiable on the basis of prob\nable cause to believe that a violation of law has occurred,”\nid., at 811 But to say that ulterior motives do not in\nvalidate a search that is legitimate because of probable\ncause to believe a crime has occurred is not to say that it\ndoes invalidate all searches that are legitimate for other\nreasons.\n  “[O]nly an undiscerning reader,” ibid., would think\notherwise. We referred to probable cause to believe that a\nviolation of law had occurred because that was the legiti\nmating factor in the case at hand. But the analysis of\nour opinion swept broadly to reject inquiries into motive\ngenerally. See id., at 812–815. We remarked that our\nspecial-needs and administrative-inspection cases are un\n8                       ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nusual in their concern for pretext, and do nothing more\nthan “explain that the exemption from the need for prob\nable cause (and warrant), which is accorded to searches\nmade for the purpose of inventory or administrative regu\nlation, is not accorded to searches that are not made for\nthose purposes,” id., at 811–812. And our opinion empha\nsized that we had at that time (prior to Edmond) rejected\nevery request to examine subjective intent outside the\nnarrow context of special needs and administrative inspec\ntions. See 517 U. S., at 812. Thus, al-Kidd’s approach\nadds an “only” to a sentence plucked from the Whren\nopinion, and then elevates that sentence (as so revised)\nover the remainder of the opinion, and over the consistent\nholdings of our other cases.\n   Because al-Kidd concedes that individualized suspicion\nsupported the issuance of the material-witness arrest\nwarrant; and does not assert that his arrest would have\nbeen unconstitutional absent the alleged pretextual use of\nthe warrant; we find no Fourth Amendment violation.3\nEfficient4 and evenhanded application of the law demands\n——————\n    3 The\n        concerns of JUSTICES GINSBURG and SOTOMAYOR about the valid\nity of the warrant in this case are beside the point. See post, at 1–2\n(GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment); post, at 2 (SOTOMAYOR, J.,\nconcurring in judgment). The validity of the warrant is not our “open\ning assumption,” post, at 2 (GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment); it is\nthe premise of al-Kidd’s argument. Al-Kidd does not claim that\nAshcroft is liable because the FBI agents failed to obtain a valid war\nrant. He takes the validity of the warrant as a given, and argues that\nhis arrest nevertheless violated the Constitution because it was moti\nvated by an illegitimate purpose. His separate Fourth Amendment and\nstatutory claims against the FBI agents who sought the material\nwitness warrant, which are the focus of both concurrences, are not\nbefore us.\n   4 We may note in passing that al-Kidd alleges that the Attorney Gen\n\neral authorized the use of material-witness warrants for detention of\nsuspected terrorists, but not that he forbade the use of those warrants\nto detain material witnesses. Which means that if al-Kidd’s inquiry\ninto actual motive is accepted, mere determination that the Attorney\n                    Cite as: 563 U.

Creigh\nton, 483 U. S. 635, 640 (1987). We do not require a case\ndirectly on point, but existing precedent must have placed\nthe statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.\nSee ibid.; Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 341 (1986). The\nconstitutional question in this case falls far short of that\nthreshold.\n   At the time of al-Kidd’s arrest, not a single judicial\nopinion had held that pretext could render an objectively\nreasonable arrest pursuant to a material-witness warrant\nunconstitutional. A district-court opinion had suggested,\nin a footnoted dictum devoid of supporting citation, that\nusing such a warrant for preventive detention of suspects\n“is an illegitimate use of the statute”—implying (we accept\nfor the sake of argument) that the detention would there\nfore be unconstitutional. United States v. Awadallah, 202\nF. Supp. 2d 55, 77, n. 28 (SDNY 2002). The Court of\nAppeals thought nothing could “have given John Ashcroft\nfair[er] warning” that his conduct violated the Fourth\nAmendment, because the footnoted dictum “call[ed] out\nAshcroft by name”! 580 F. 3d, at 972–973 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted; emphasis added). We will indulge the\nassumption (though it does not seem to us realistic) that\nJustice Department lawyers bring to the Attorney Gen\n—————— \n\nGeneral promulgated the alleged policy would not alone decide the case. \n\nAl-Kidd would also have to prove that the officials who sought his \n\nmaterial-arrest warrant were motivated by Ashcroft’s policy, not by a\n\ndesire to call al-Kidd as a witness. \n\n10                  ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\neral’s personal attention all district judges’ footnoted\nspeculations that boldly “call him out by name.” On that\nassumption, would it prove that for him (and for him\nonly?) it became clearly established that pretextual use of\nthe material-witness statute rendered the arrest unconsti\ntutional? An extraordinary proposition. Even a district\njudge’s ipse dixit of a holding is not “controlling authority”\nin any jurisdiction, much less in the entire United States;\nand his ipse dixit of a footnoted dictum falls far short of\nwhat is necessary absent controlling authority: a robust\n“consensus of cases of persuasive authority.” Wilson v.\nLayne, 526 U. S. 603, 617 (1999).\n   The Court of Appeals’ other cases “clearly establishing”\nthe constitutional violation are, of course, those we re\njected as irrelevant in our discussion of whether there was\nany constitutional violation at all. And the Court of Ap\npeals’ reference to those cases here makes the same error\nof assuming that purpose is only disregarded when there\nis probable cause to suspect a violation of law.\n   The Court of Appeals also found clearly established law\nlurking in the broad “history and purposes of the Fourth\nAmendment.” 580 F. 3d, at 971. We have repeatedly told\ncourts—and the Ninth Circuit in particular, see Brosseau\nv. Haugen, 543 U. S. 194, 198–199 (2004) (per curiam)—\nnot to define clearly established law at a high level of\ngenerality. See also, e.g., Wilson, supra, at 615; Anderson,\nsupra, at 639–640; cf. Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 236\n(1990). The general proposition, for example, that an\nunreasonable search or seizure violates the Fourth\nAmendment is of little help in determining whether the\nviolative nature of particular conduct is clearly estab\nlished. See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 201–202 (2001);\nWilson, supra, at 615.\n   The same is true of the Court of Appeals’ broad histori\ncal assertions. The Fourth Amendment was a response to\nthe English Crown’s use of general warrants, which often\n                  Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nallowed royal officials to search and seize whatever and\nwhomever they pleased while investigating crimes or\naffronts to the Crown. See Stanford v. Texas, 379 U. S.\n476, 481–485 (1965). According to the Court of Appeals,\nAshcroft should have seen that a pretextual warrant\nsimilarly “gut[s] the substantive protections of the Fourth\nAmendmen[t]” and allows the State “to arrest upon the\nexecutive’s mere suspicion.” 580 F. 3d, at 972.\n   Ashcroft must be forgiven for missing the parallel,\nwhich escapes us as well. The principal evil of the general\nwarrant was addressed by the Fourth Amendment’s par\nticularity requirement, Stanford, supra, at 485, which\nAshcroft’s alleged policy made no effort to evade. The\nwarrant authorizing al-Kidd’s arrest named al-Kidd and\nonly al-Kidd. It might be argued, perhaps, that when, in\nresponse to the English abuses, the Fourth Amendment\nsaid that warrants could only issue “on probable cause” it\nmeant only probable cause to suspect a violation of law,\nand not probable cause to believe that the individual\nnamed in the warrant was a material witness. But that\nwould make all arrests pursuant to material-witness\nwarrants unconstitutional, whether pretextual or not—\nand that is not the position taken by al-Kidd in this case.\n   While featuring a District Court’s footnoted dictum, the\nCourt of Appeals made no mention of this Court’s affirma\ntion in Edmond of the “predominan[t]” rule that reason\nableness is an objective inquiry, 531 U. S., at 47. Nor did it\nmention Whren’s and Knights’ statements that subjective\nintent mattered in a very limited subset of our Fourth\nAmendment cases; or Terry’s objective evaluation of inves\ntigatory searches premised on reasonable suspicion rather\nthan probable cause; or Bond’s objective evaluation of a\nsuspicionless investigatory search. The Court of Appeals\nseems to have cherry-picked the aspects of our opinions\nthat gave colorable support to the proposition that the un\nconstitutionality of the action here was clearly established.\n12                  ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Qualified immunity gives government officials breathing\nroom to make reasonable but mistaken judgments about\nopen legal questions. When properly applied, it protects\n“all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly\nviolate the law.” Malley, 475 U. S., at 341. Ashcroft de\nserves neither label, not least because eight Court of\nAppeals judges agreed with his judgment in a case of first\nimpression. See Wilson, supra, at 618. He deserves quali\nfied immunity even assuming—contrafactually—that his\nalleged detention policy violated the Fourth Amendment.\n                        *    *     *\n   We hold that an objectively reasonable arrest and deten\ntion of a material witness pursuant to a validly obtained\nwarrant cannot be challenged as unconstitutional on the\nbasis of allegations that the arresting authority had an\nimproper motive. Because Ashcroft did not violate clearly\nestablished law, we need not address the more difficult\nquestion whether he enjoys absolute immunity. The\njudgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case\nis remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

In holding that\nthe Attorney General could be liable for damages based on\nan unprecedented constitutional rule, the Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit disregarded the purposes of the doc\ntrine of qualified immunity. This concurring opinion makes\ntwo additional observations.\n                               I\n   The Court’s holding is limited to the arguments pre\nsented by the parties and leaves unresolved whether the\nGovernment’s use of the Material Witness Statute in this\ncase was lawful. See ante, at 8 (noting that al-Kidd “does\nnot assert that his arrest would have been unconstitu\ntional absent the alleged pretextual use of the warrant”).\nUnder the statute, a Magistrate Judge may issue a war\nrant to arrest someone as a material witness upon a show\ning by affidavit that “the testimony of a person is material\nin a criminal proceeding” and “that it may become imprac\nticable to secure the presence of the person by subpoena.”\n18 U. S. C. §3144. The scope of the statute’s lawful\nauthorization is uncertain. For example, a law-abiding\ncitizen might observe a crime during the days or weeks\n2                  ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nbefore a scheduled flight abroad. It is unclear whether\nthose facts alone might allow police to obtain a material\nwitness warrant on the ground that it “may become im\npracticable” to secure the person’s presence by subpoena.\nIbid. The question becomes more difficult if one further\nassumes the traveler would be willing to testify if asked;\nand more difficult still if one supposes that authorities\ndelay obtaining or executing the warrant until the traveler\nhas arrived at the airport. These possibilities resemble\nthe facts in this case. See ante, at 2.\n   In considering these issues, it is important to bear in\nmind that the Material Witness Statute might not provide\nfor the issuance of warrants within the meaning of the\nFourth Amendment’s Warrant Clause. The typical arrest\nwarrant is based on probable cause that the arrestee has\ncommitted a crime; but that is not the standard for the\nissuance of warrants under the Material Witness Statute.\nSee ante, at 11 (reserving the possibility that probable\ncause for purposes of the Fourth Amendment’s Warrant\nClause means “only probable cause to suspect a violation\nof law”). If material witness warrants do not qualify as\n“Warrants” under the Fourth Amendment, then material\nwitness arrests might still be governed by the Fourth\nAmendment’s separate reasonableness requirement for\nseizures of the person. See United States v. Watson, 423\nU. S. 411 (1976). Given the difficulty of these issues, the\nCourt is correct to address only the legal theory put before\nit, without further exploring when material witness ar\nrests might be consistent with statutory and constitutional\nrequirements.\n                             II\n   The fact that the Attorney General holds a high office in\nthe Government must inform what law is clearly estab\nlished for the purposes of this case. Mitchell v. Forsyth,\n472 U. S. 511, 525 (1985). Some federal officers perform\n                 Cite as: 563 U.

They\n“reasonably can anticipate when their conduct may give\nrise to liability for damages” and so are expected to adjust\ntheir behavior in accordance with local precedent. Davis\nv. Scherer, 468 U. S. 183, 195 (1984); see also Anderson v.\nCreighton, 483 U. S. 635, 639–640 (1987). In contrast the\nAttorney General occupies a national office and so sets\npolicies implemented in many jurisdictions throughout the\ncountry. The official with responsibilities in many juris\ndictions may face ambiguous and sometimes inconsistent\nsources of decisional law. While it may be clear that one\nCourt of Appeals has approved a certain course of conduct,\nother Courts of Appeals may have disapproved it, or at\nleast reserved the issue.\n   When faced with inconsistent legal rules in different\njurisdictions, national officeholders should be given some\ndeference for qualified immunity purposes, at least if they\nimplement policies consistent with the governing law of\nthe jurisdiction where the action is taken. As we have\nexplained, qualified immunity is lost when plaintiffs point\neither to “cases of controlling authority in their jurisdic\ntion at the time of the incident” or to “a consensus of cases\nof persuasive authority such that a reasonable officer\ncould not have believed that his actions were lawful.”\nWilson v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 617 (1999); see also ante,\nat 9–10. These standards ensure the officer has “fair and\nclear warning” of what the Constitution requires. United\nStates v. Lanier, 520 U. S. 259, 271 (1997).\n   A national officeholder intent on retaining qualified\nimmunity need not abide by the most stringent standard\nadopted anywhere in the United States. And the national\nofficeholder need not guess at when a relatively small set\nof appellate precedents have established a binding legal\nrule. If national officeholders were subject to personal\nliability whenever they confronted disagreement among\n4                   ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nappellate courts, those officers would be deterred from full\nuse of their legal authority. The consequences of that\ndeterrence must counsel caution by the Judicial Branch,\nparticularly in the area of national security. See Ashcroft\nv. Iqbal, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 21). Fur\nthermore, too expansive a view of “clearly established law”\nwould risk giving local judicial determinations the effect of\nrules with de facto national significance, contrary to the\nnormal process of ordered appellate review.\n  The proceedings in this case illustrate these concerns.\nThe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit appears to\nhave reasoned that a Federal District Court sitting in New\nYork had authority to establish a legal rule binding on\nthe Attorney General and, therefore, on federal law\nenforcement operations conducted nationwide. See 580\nF. 3d 949, 972–973 (2009). Indeed, this case involves a\nmaterial witness warrant issued in Boise, Idaho, and an\narrest near Washington, D. C. Of course, district court\ndecisions are not precedential to this extent. Ante, at 9–\n10. But nationwide security operations should not have to\ngrind to a halt even when an appellate court finds those\noperations unconstitutional. The doctrine of qualified\nimmunity does not so constrain national officeholders\nentrusted with urgent responsibilities.\n                    Cite as: 563 U.

In addition,\nthe affidavit misrepresented that al-Kidd was about to\ntake a one-way flight to Saudi Arabia, with a first-class\nticket costing approximately $5,000; in fact, al-Kidd had a\nround-trip, coach-class ticket that cost $1,700.2 Given\nthese omissions and misrepresentations, there is strong\ncause to question the Court’s opening assumption—a valid\nmaterial-witness warrant—and equally strong reason to\nconclude that a merits determination was neither neces\nsary nor proper.3\n——————\n   2 Judicial officers asked to issue material witness warrants must\n\ndetermine whether the affidavit supporting the application shows that\n“the testimony of a person is material in a criminal proceeding” and\nthat “it may become impracticable to secure the presence of the person\nby subpoena.” 18 U. S. C. §3144. Even if these conditions are met,\nissuance of the warrant is discretionary. Ibid. (“judicial officer may\norder the arrest of the person” (emphasis added)). Al-Kidd’s experience\nillustrates the importance of vigilant exercise of this checking role by\nthe judicial officer to whom the warrant application is presented.\n   The affidavit used to secure al-Kidd’s detention was spare; it did not\nstate with particularity the information al-Kidd purportedly possessed,\nnor did it specify how al-Kidd’s knowledge would be material to Sami\nOmar al-Hussayen’s prosecution. As to impracticability, the affidavit\ncontained only this unelaborated statement: “It is believed that if Al-\nKidd travels to Saudi Arabia, the United States Government will be\nunable to secure his presence at trial via subpoena.” App. 64.

See Black’s Law Dictionary\n1585 (9th ed. 2009) (defining “reasonable suspicion” to mean “[a] par\nticularized and objective basis, supported by specific and articulable\nfacts, for suspecting a person of criminal activity”).

In addition to the questions JUSTICE\nKENNEDY poses, and even if the initial material witness\nclassification had been proper, what even arguably legiti\nmate basis could there be for the harsh custodial condi\ntions to which al-Kidd was subjected: Ostensibly held only\nto secure his testimony, al-Kidd was confined in three\ndifferent detention centers during his 16 days’ incarcera\ntion, kept in high-security cells lit 24 hours a day, strip\nsearched and subjected to body-cavity inspections on more\nthan one occasion, and handcuffed and shackled about his\nwrists, legs, and waist. App. 29–36; cf. Bell v. Wolfish, 441\nU. S. 520, 539, n. 20 (1979) (“[L]oading a detainee with\nchains and shackles and throwing him in a dungeon may\nensure his presence at trial and preserve the security of\nthe institution. But it would be difficult to conceive of a\nsituation where conditions so harsh, employed to achieve\nobjectives that could be accomplished in so many alterna\ntive and less harsh methods, would not support a conclu\nsion that the purpose for which they were imposed was to\npunish.”).\n   However circumscribed al-Kidd’s Bivens claim against\nAshcroft may have been, see Bivens v.

When\nthe evening news reports that a murder “suspect” is on the loose, the\nviewer is meant to be on the lookout for the perpetrator, not the wit\nness. Ashcroft understood the term as lawyers commonly do: He spoke\nof detaining material witnesses as a means to “tak[e] suspected terror\nists off the street.” App. 41 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n                    Cite as: 563 U.

I\ncannot join the majority’s opinion, however, because it\nunnecessarily “resolve[s] [a] difficult and novel questio[n]\nof constitutional . . . interpretation that will ‘have no effect\non the outcome of the case.’ ” Ante, at 3 (quoting Pearson\nv. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 237 (2009)).\n   Whether the Fourth Amendment permits the pretextual\nuse of a material witness warrant for preventive detention\nof an individual whom the Government has no intention\nof using at trial is, in my view, a closer question than\nthe majority’s opinion suggests. Although the majority\nis correct that a government official’s subjective intent is\ngenerally “irrelevant in determining whether that officer’s\nactions violate the Fourth Amendment,” Bond v. United\nStates, 529 U. S. 334, 338, n. 2 (2000), none of our prior\ncases recognizing that principle involved prolonged deten­\ntion of an individual without probable cause to believe he\nhad committed any criminal offense. We have never\nconsidered whether an official’s subjective intent matters\nfor purposes of the Fourth Amendment in that novel con­\ntext, and we need not and should not resolve that question\n2                   ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD\n\n             SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nin this case. All Members of the Court agree that, what­\never the merits of the underlying Fourth Amendment\nquestion, Ashcroft did not violate clearly established law.\n   The majority’s constitutional ruling is a narrow one pre­\nmised on the existence of a “valid material-witness war­\nran[t],” ante, at 1—a premise that, at the very least, is\nquestionable in light of the allegations set forth in al-\nKidd’s complaint. Based on those allegations, it is not at\nall clear that it would have been “impracticable to secure\n[al-Kidd’s] presence . . . by subpoena” or that his testimony\ncould not “adequately be secured by deposition.” 18\nU. S. C. §3144; see First Amended Complaint in No. 05–\n093–EJL, ¶55, App. 26 (“Mr. al-Kidd would have complied\nwith a subpoena had he been issued one or agreed to a\ndeposition”). Nor is it clear that the affidavit supporting\nthe warrant was sufficient; its failure to disclose that the\nGovernment had no intention of using al-Kidd as a wit­\nness at trial may very well have rendered the affidavit\ndeliberately false and misleading. Cf. Franks v. Delaware,\n438 U. S. 154, 155–156 (1978). The majority assumes\naway these factual difficulties, but in my view, they point\nto the artificiality of the way the Fourth Amendment\nquestion has been presented to this Court and provide\nfurther reason to avoid rendering an unnecessary holding\non the constitutional question.\n   I also join Part I of JUSTICE KENNEDY’s concurring\nopinion. As that opinion makes clear, this case does not\npresent an occasion to address the proper scope of the\nmaterial witness statute or its constitutionality as applied\nin this case. Indeed, nothing in the majority’s opinion\ntoday should be read as placing this Court’s imprimatur\non the actions taken by the Government against al-Kidd.\nAnte, at 1 (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (“The Court’s holding\nis limited to the arguments presented by the parties and\nleaves unresolved whether the Government’s use of the\nMaterial Witness Statute in this case was lawful”).\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/217703/", "sha1": "9c0ded6710fbaaba55bb881310c548f9e4c9877c", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2011-05-31T07:13:37"}
