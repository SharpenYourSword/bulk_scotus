Argued April 18, 2011—Decided June 9, 2011\nIn asserting patent invalidity as a defense to an infringement action, an\n  alleged infringer must contend with §282 of the Patent Act of 1952\n  (Act), under which “[a] patent shall be presumed valid” and “[t]he\n  burden of establishing invalidity . . . shall rest on the party asserting”\n  it. Since 1984, the Federal Circuit has read §282 to require a defen\n  dant seeking to overcome the presumption to persuade the factfinder\n  of its invalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence.\n     Respondents (collectively, i4i) hold the patent at issue, which\n  claims an improved method for editing computer documents. After\n  i4i sued petitioner Microsoft Corp. for willful infringement of that\n  patent, Microsoft counterclaimed and sought a declaration that the\n  patent was invalid under §102(b)’s on-sale bar, which precludes pat\n  ent protection for any “invention” that was “on sale in this country”\n  more than one year prior to the filing of a patent application. The\n  parties agreed that, more than a year before filing its patent applica\n  tion, i4i had sold a software program known as S4 in the United\n  States, but they disagreed over whether that software embodied the\n  invention claimed in i4i’s patent. Relying on the undisputed fact that\n  the S4 software was never presented to the Patent and Trademark\n  Office (PTO) during its examination of the patent application, Micro\n  soft objected to i4i’s proposed jury instruction that the invalidity de\n  fense must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. The District\n  Court nevertheless gave that instruction, rejecting Microsoft’s alter\n  native instruction proposing a preponderance of the evidence stan\n  dard. The jury found that Microsoft willfully infringed the i4i patent\n  and had failed to prove the patent’s invalidity. The Federal Circuit\n  affirmed, relying on its settled interpretation of §282.\n2          MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld: Section 282 requires an invalidity defense to be proved by clear\n and convincing evidence. Pp. 5–20.\n    (a) The Court rejects Microsoft’s contention that a defendant need\n only persuade the jury of a patent invalidity defense by a preponder\n ance of the evidence. Where Congress has prescribed the governing\n standard of proof, its choice generally controls. Steadman v. SEC,\n 450 U. S. 91, 95. Congress has made such a choice here. While §282\n includes no express articulation of the standard of proof, where Con\n gress uses a common-law term in a statute, the Court assumes the\n “term . . . comes with a common law meaning.” Safeco Ins. Co. of\n America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 58. Here, by stating that a patent is\n “presumed valid,” §282, Congress used a term with a settled common\n law meaning. Radio Corp. of America v. Radio Engineering Labora\n tories, Inc., 293 U. S. 1 (RCA), is authoritative. There, tracing nearly\n a century of case law, the Court stated, inter alia, that “there is a\n presumption of [patent] validity [that is] not to be overthrown except\n by clear and cogent evidence,” id., at 2. Microsoft’s contention that\n the Court’s pre-Act precedents applied a clear-and-convincing stan\n dard only in two limited circumstances is unavailing, given the ab\n sence of those qualifications from the Court’s cases. Also unpersua\n sive is Microsoft’s argument that the Federal Circuit’s interpretation\n must fail because it renders superfluous §282’s additional statement\n that “[t]he burden of establishing invalidity . . . shall rest on the\n party asserting” it. The canon against superfluity assists only where\n a competing interpretation gives effect “ ‘to every clause and word of\n a statute.’ ” Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174. Here, no inter\n pretation of §282 avoids excess language because, under either of Mi\n crosoft’s alternative theories—that the presumption only allocates\n the burden of production or that it shifts both the burdens of produc\n tion and persuasion—the presumption itself would be unnecessary in\n light of §282’s additional statement as to the challenger’s burden.\n Pp. 5–13.\n    (b) Also rejected is Microsoft’s argument that a preponderance\n standard must at least apply where the evidence before the factfinder\n was not before the PTO during the examination process. It is true\n enough that, in these circumstances, “the rationale underlying the\n presumption—that the PTO, in its expertise, has approved the\n claim—seems much diminished,” KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550\n U. S. 398, 426, though other rationales may still animate the pre\n sumption. But the question remains whether Congress has specified\n the applicable standard of proof. As established here today, Congress\n did just that by codifying the common-law presumption of patent va\n lidity and, implicitly, the heightened standard of proof attached to it.\n The Court’s pre-Act cases never adopted or endorsed Microsoft’s fluc\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  tuating standard of proof. And they do not indicate, even in dicta,\n  that anything less than a clear-and-convincing standard would ever\n  apply to an invalidity defense. In fact, the Court indicated to the con\n  trary. See RCA, 293 U. S., at 8. Finally, the Court often applied the\n  heightened standard of proof without mentioning whether the rele\n  vant prior-art evidence had been before the PTO examiner, in cir\n  cumstances strongly suggesting it had not. See, e.g., Smith v. Hall,\n  301 U. S. 216, 227, 233. Nothing in §282’s text suggests that Con\n  gress meant to depart from that understanding to enact a standard of\n  proof that would rise and fall with the facts of each case. Indeed, had\n  Congress intended to drop the heightened standard of proof where\n  the evidence before the jury varied from that before the PTO, it pre\n  sumably would have said so expressly. Those pre-Act cases where\n  various Courts of Appeals observed that the presumption is weak\n  ened or dissipated where the evidence was never considered by the\n  PTO should be read to reflect the commonsense principle that if the\n  PTO did not have all material facts before it, its considered judgment\n  may lose significant force. Cf. KSR, 550 U. S., at 427. Consistent\n  with that principle, a jury may be instructed to evaluate whether the\n  evidence before it is materially new, and if so, to consider that fact\n  when determining whether an invalidity defense has been proved by\n  clear and convincing evidence. Pp. 14–18.\n     (c) This Court is in no position to judge the comparative force of the\n  parties’ policy arguments as to the wisdom of the clear-and\n  convincing-evidence standard that Congress adopted.            Congress\n  specified the applicable standard of proof in 1952 when it codified the\n  common-law presumption of patent validity. During the nearly 30\n  years that the Federal Circuit has interpreted §282 as the Court does\n  today, Congress has often amended §282 and other patent laws, but\n  apparently has never considered any proposal to lower the standard\n  of proof. Indeed, Congress has left the Federal Circuit’s interpreta\n  tion in place despite ongoing criticism, both from within the Federal\n  Government and without. Accordingly, any recalibration of the stan\n  dard of proof remains in Congress’ hands.

S. C. §282. We\nconsider whether §282 requires an invalidity defense to be\nproved by clear and convincing evidence. We hold that it\ndoes.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n  Pursuant to its authority under the Patent Clause, U. S.\nConst., Art. I, §8, cl. 8, Congress has charged the United\nStates Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) with the task\nof examining patent applications, 35 U. S. C. §2(a)(1), and\nissuing patents if “it appears that the applicant is entitled\nto a patent under the law,” §131. Congress has set forth\nthe prerequisites for issuance of a patent, which the PTO\nmust evaluate in the examination process. To receive\npatent protection a claimed invention must, among other\nthings, fall within one of the express categories of pat\nentable subject matter, §101, and be novel, §102, and\n2        MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnonobvious, §103. Most relevant here, the on-sale bar of\n§102(b) precludes patent protection for any “invention”\nthat was “on sale in this country” more than one year prior\nto the filing of a patent application. See generally Pfaff v.\nWells Electronics, Inc., 525 U. S. 55, 67–68 (1998). In\nevaluating whether these and other statutory conditions\nhave been met, PTO examiners must make various factual\ndeterminations—for instance, the state of the prior art in\nthe field and the nature of the advancement embodied in\nthe invention. See Dickinson v. Zurko, 527 U. S. 150, 153\n(1999).\n   Once issued, a patent grants certain exclusive rights to\nits holder, including the exclusive right to use the inven\ntion during the patent’s duration. To enforce that right, a\npatentee can bring a civil action for infringement if an\nother person “without authority makes, uses, offers to sell,\nor sells any patented invention, within the United States.”\n§271(a); see also §281.\n   Among other defenses under §282 of the Patent Act of\n1952 (1952 Act), an alleged infringer may assert the inva\nlidity of the patent—that is, he may attempt to prove that\nthe patent never should have issued in the first place. See\n§§282(2), (3). A defendant may argue, for instance, that\nthe claimed invention was obvious at the time and thus\nthat one of the conditions of patentability was lacking.\nSee §282(2); see also §103. “While the ultimate question of\npatent validity is one of law,” Graham v. John Deere Co.\nof Kansas City, 383 U. S. 1, 17 (1966) (citing Great Atlantic\n& Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340\nU. S. 147, 155 (1950) (Douglas, J., concurring)); see post,\nat 1 (BREYER, J., concurring), the same factual questions\nunderlying the PTO’s original examination of a patent ap\nplication will also bear on an invalidity defense in an in\nfringement action. See, e.g., 383 U. S., at 17 (describing\nthe “basic factual inquiries” that form the “background”\nfor evaluating obviousness); Pfaff, 525 U. S., at 67–69\n                    Cite as: 564 U.

Judge\nRich, a principal drafter of the 1952 Act, articulated this\nview for the court in American Hoist & Derrick Co. v.\nSowa & Sons, Inc., 725 F. 2d 1350 (CA Fed. 1984). There,\nthe Federal Circuit held that §282 codified “the existing\npresumption of validity of patents,” id., at 1359 (internal\nquotation marks omitted)—what, until that point, had\nbeen a common-law presumption based on “the basic\nproposition that a government agency such as the [PTO]\nwas presumed to do its job,” ibid. Relying on this Court’s\npre-1952 precedent as to the “force of the presumption,”\nibid. (citing Radio Corp. of America v. Radio Engineering\nLaboratories, Inc., 293 U. S. 1 (1934) (RCA)), Judge Rich\nconcluded:\n     “[Section] 282 creates a presumption that a patent is\n     valid and imposes the burden of proving invalidity on\n     the attacker. That burden is constant and never\n     changes and is to convince the court of invalidity by\n     clear evidence.” 725 F. 2d, at 1360.\nIn the nearly 30 years since American Hoist, the Federal\nCircuit has never wavered in this interpretation of §282.\nSee, e.g., Greenwood v. Hattori Seiko Co., 900 F. 2d 238,\n——————\n  1 As originally enacted in 1952, the first paragraph of §282 read: “A\n\npatent shall be presumed valid. The burden of establishing invalidity\nof a patent shall rest on a party asserting it.” 66 Stat. 812. Congress\nhas since amended §282, inserting two sentences not relevant here and\nmodifying the language of the second sentence to that in the text.\n4        MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n240–241 (CA Fed. 1990); Ultra-Tex Surfaces, Inc. v. Hill\nBros. Chemical Co., 204 F. 3d 1360, 1367 (CA Fed. 2000);\nALZA Corp. v. Andrx Pharmaceuticals, LLC, 603 F. 3d\n935, 940 (CA Fed. 2010).\n                                B\n   Respondents i4i Limited Partnership and Infrastruc\ntures for Information Inc. (collectively, i4i) hold the patent\nat issue in this suit. The i4i patent claims an improved\nmethod for editing computer documents, which stores a\ndocument’s content separately from the metacodes asso\nciated with the document’s structure. In 2007, i4i sued\npetitioner Microsoft Corporation for willful infringement,\nclaiming that Microsoft’s manufacture and sale of certain\nMicrosoft Word products infringed i4i’s patent. In addi\ntion to denying infringement, Microsoft counterclaimed\nand sought a declaration that i4i’s patent was invalid and\nunenforceable.\n   Specifically and as relevant here, Microsoft claimed that\nthe on-sale bar of §102(b) rendered the patent invalid,\npointing to i4i’s prior sale of a software program known as\nS4. The parties agreed that, more than one year prior to\nthe filing of the i4i patent application, i4i had sold S4\nin the United States. They presented opposing arguments\nto the jury, however, as to whether that software embod\nied the invention claimed in i4i’s patent. Because the\nsoftware’s source code had been destroyed years before the\ncommencement of this litigation, the factual dispute\nturned largely on trial testimony by S4’s two inventors—\nalso the named inventors on the i4i patent—both of whom\ntestified that S4 did not practice the key invention dis\nclosed in the patent.\n   Relying on the undisputed fact that the S4 software was\nnever presented to the PTO examiner, Microsoft objected\nto i4i’s proposed instruction that it was required to prove\nits invalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence.\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

How\n     ever, Microsoft’s burden of proof with regard to its\n     defense of invalidity based on prior art that the ex\n     aminer did not review during the prosecution of the\n     patent-in-suit is by preponderance of the evidence.’ ”\n     Ibid.\nRejecting the hybrid standard of proof that Microsoft\nadvocated, the District Court instructed the jury that\n“Microsoft has the burden of proving invalidity by clear\nand convincing evidence.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 195a.\n   The jury found that Microsoft willfully infringed the i4i\npatent and that Microsoft failed to prove invalidity due to\nthe on-sale bar or otherwise. Denying Microsoft’s post\ntrial motions, the District Court rejected Microsoft’s con\ntention that the court improperly instructed the jury on\nthe standard of proof. The Court of Appeals for the Fed\neral Circuit affirmed.2 598 F. 3d 831, 848 (2010). Relying\non its settled interpretation of §282, the court explained\nthat it could “discern [no] error” in the jury instruction\nrequiring Microsoft to prove its invalidity defense by clear\nand convincing evidence. Ibid. We granted certiorari.\n562 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                            II\n  According to Microsoft, a defendant in an infringement\naction need only persuade the jury of an invalidity defense\nby a preponderance of the evidence.

We reject both contentions.3\n                              A\n   Where Congress has prescribed the governing standard\nof proof, its choice controls absent “countervailing consti\ntutional constraints.” Steadman v. SEC, 450 U. S. 91, 95\n(1981). The question, then, is whether Congress has made\nsuch a choice here.\n   As stated, the first paragraph of §282 provides that\n“[a] patent shall be presumed valid” and “[t]he burden of\nestablishing invalidity of a patent or any claim thereof\nshall rest on the party asserting such invalidity.” Thus, by\nits express terms, §282 establishes a presumption of pat\nent validity, and it provides that a challenger must over\ncome that presumption to prevail on an invalidity defense.\nBut, while the statute explicitly specifies the burden of\nproof, it includes no express articulation of the standard of\nproof.4\n——————\n   3 i4i contends that Microsoft forfeited the first argument by failing to\n\nraise it until its merits brief in this Court. The argument, however, is\nwithin the scope of the question presented, and because we reject it on\nits merits, we need not decide whether it has been preserved.\n   4 A preliminary word on terminology is in order. As we have said,\n\n“[t]he term ‘burden of proof’ is one of the ‘the slipperiest members of\nthe family of legal terms.’ ” Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. 49, 56 (2005)\n(quoting 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence §342, p. 433 (5th ed.\n1999) (alteration omitted)). Historically, the term has encompassed two\nseparate burdens: the “burden of persuasion” (specifying which party\nloses if the evidence is balanced), as well as the “burden of production”\n(specifying which party must come forward with evidence at various\nstages in the litigation). Ibid. Adding more confusion, the term “bur\nden of proof” has occasionally been used as a synonym for “standard of\nproof.” E.g., Grogan v. Garner, 498 U. S. 279, 286 (1991).\n   Here we use “burden of proof” interchangeably with “burden of per\nsuasion” to identify the party who must persuade the jury in its favor to\nprevail. We use the term “standard of proof” to refer to the degree of\ncertainty by which the factfinder must be persuaded of a factual conclu\n                      Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                       7\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   Our statutory inquiry, however, cannot simply end\nthere. We begin, of course, with “the assumption that the\nordinary meaning of the language” chosen by Congress\n“accurately expresses the legislative purpose.” Engine\nMfrs. Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist.,\n541 U. S. 246, 252 (2004) (internal quotation marks omit\nted). But where Congress uses a common-law term in a\nstatute, we assume the “term . . . comes with a common\nlaw meaning, absent anything pointing another way.”\nSafeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 58 (2007)\n(citing Beck v. Prupis, 529 U. S. 494, 500–501 (2000)).\nHere, by stating that a patent is “presumed valid,” §282,\nCongress used a term with a settled meaning in the com\nmon law.\n   Our decision in RCA, 293 U. S. 1, is authoritative.\nThere, tracing nearly a century of case law from this Court\nand others, Justice Cardozo wrote for a unanimous Court\nthat “there is a presumption of validity, a presumption not\nto be overthrown except by clear and cogent evidence.”\nId., at 2. Although the “force” of the presumption found\n“varying expression” in this Court and elsewhere, id., at 7,\nJustice Cardozo explained, one “common core of thought\nand truth” unified the decisions:\n     “[O]ne otherwise an infringer who assails the validity\n     of a patent fair upon its face bears a heavy burden of\n     persuasion, and fails unless his evidence has more\n     than a dubious preponderance. If that is true where\n—————— \n\nsion to find in favor of the party bearing the burden of persuasion. See \n\nAddington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 423 (1979). In other words, the term\n\n“standard of proof” specifies how difficult it will be for the party bearing \n\nthe burden of persuasion to convince the jury of the facts in its favor. \n\nVarious standards of proof are familiar—beyond a reasonable doubt, by\n\nclear and convincing evidence, and by a preponderance of the evidence. \n\nSee generally 21B C.

If it is true where the assailant launches his\n     attack with evidence different, at least in form, from\n     any theretofore produced in opposition to the patent,\n     it is so a bit more clearly where the evidence is\n     even verbally the same.” Id., at 8 (internal citation\n     omitted).5\nThe common-law presumption, in other words, reflected\nthe universal understanding that a preponderance stan\ndard of proof was too “dubious” a basis to deem a patent\ninvalid. Ibid.; see also id., at 7 (“[A] patent . . . is pre\nsumed to be valid until the presumption has been over\ncome by convincing evidence of error”).\n  Thus, by the time Congress enacted §282 and declared\nthat a patent is “presumed valid,” the presumption of\npatent validity had long been a fixture of the common law.\nAccording to its settled meaning, a defendant raising an\ninvalidity defense bore “a heavy burden of persuasion,”\nrequiring proof of the defense by clear and convincing\nevidence.

Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 23 (1999);\nsee also id., at 21 (“ ‘Where Congress uses terms that have\naccumulated settled meaning under . . . the common law,\n[we] must infer, unless the statute otherwise dictates, that\nCongress means to incorporate the established meaning of\nthose terms.’ ” (quoting Nationwide Mut.

S., at 23 (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted).\n   We recognize that it may be unusual to treat a presump\ntion as alone establishing the governing standard of proof.\nSee, e.g., J. Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at\nthe Common Law 336–337 (1898) (hereinafter Thayer)\n(“When . . . we read that the contrary of any particular\npresumption must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, . . .\nit is to be recognized that we have something superadded\nto the rule of presumption, namely, another rule as to\nthe amount of evidence which is needed to overcome the\npresumption”). But given how judges, including Justice\nCardozo, repeatedly understood and explained the pre\nsumption of patent validity, we cannot accept Microsoft’s\nargument that Congress used the words “presumed valid”\nto adopt only a procedural device for “shifting the burden\nof production,” or for “shifting both the burden of produc\ntion and the burden of persuasion.” Brief for Petitioner\n21–22 (emphasis deleted).

Beck, 529 U. S., at 501 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). And RCA leaves no doubt that\nattached to the common-law presumption of patent valid\nity was an expression as to its “force,” 293 U. S., at 7—that\nis, the standard of proof required to overcome it.6\n   Resisting the conclusion that Congress adopted the\nheightened standard of proof reflected in our pre-1952\ncases, Microsoft contends that those cases applied a clear\nand-convincing standard of proof only in two limited\ncircumstances, not in every case involving an invalidity\ndefense. First, according to Microsoft, the heightened\nstandard of proof applied in cases “involving oral testi\nmony of prior invention,” simply to account for the unreli\nability of such testimony. Brief for Petitioner 25. Second,\nMicrosoft tells us, the heightened standard of proof ap\nplied to “invalidity challenges based on priority of inven\ntion,” where that issue had previously been litigated\nbetween the parties in PTO proceedings. Id., at 28.\n   Squint as we may, we fail to see the qualifications that\nMicrosoft purports to identify in our cases.

In sup\nport, it relies on the “understanding” reflected in Federal Rule of\nEvidence 301, which explains the ordinary effect of a presumption in\nfederal civil actions. That Rule, however, postdates the 1952 Act by\nnearly 30 years, and it is not dispositive of how Congress in 1952\nunderstood presumptions generally, much less the presumption of pat\nent validity. In any event, the word “presumption” has often been\nused when another term might be more accurate. See Thayer 335\n(“Often . . . maxims and ground principles get expressed in this form of\na presumption perversely and inaccurately”). And, to the extent\nCongress used the words “presumed valid” in an imprecise way, we\ncannot fault it for following our lead.\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion of patent validity. RCA simply said, without qualifi\ncation, “that one otherwise an infringer who assails the\nvalidity of a patent fair upon its face bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion, and fails unless his evidence has more than\na dubious preponderance.” 293 U. S., at 8; see also id., at\n7 (“A patent regularly issued, and even more obviously\na patent issued after a hearing of all the rival claimants,\nis presumed to be valid until the presumption has been\novercome by convincing evidence of error” (emphasis\nadded)). Nor do they appear in any of our cases as express\nlimitations on the application of the heightened standard\nof proof. Cf., e.g., Smith v. Hall, 301 U. S. 216, 233 (1937)\n(citing RCA for the proposition that a “heavy burden of\npersuasion . . . rests upon one who seeks to negative nov\nelty in a patent by showing prior use”); Mumm v. Jacob E.\nDecker & Sons, 301 U. S. 168, 171 (1937) (“Not only is the\nburden to make good this defense upon the party setting it\nup, but his burden is a heavy one, as it has been held that\nevery reasonable doubt should be resolved against him”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). In fact, Microsoft\nitself admits that our cases “could be read as announcing a\nheightened standard applicable to all invalidity asser\ntions.” Brief for Petitioner 30 (emphasis deleted).\n   Furthermore, we cannot agree that Microsoft’s proposed\nlimitations are inherent—even if unexpressed—in our\npre-1952 cases. As early as 1874 we explained that the\nburden of proving prior inventorship “rests upon [the de\nfendant], and every reasonable doubt should be resolved\nagainst him,” without tying that rule to the vagaries and\nmanipulability of oral testimony. Coffin v.

And, more than 60 years later, we\napplied that rule where the evidence in support of a prior\nuse defense included documentary proof—not just oral\ntestimony—in a case presenting no priority issues at all.\nSee Smith, 301 U. S., at 221, 233. Thus, even if Congress\nsearched for some unstated limitations on the heightened\n12         MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nstandard of proof in our cases, it would have found none.7\n  Microsoft also argues that the Federal Circuit’s inter\npretation of §282’s statement that “[a] patent shall be pre\nsumed valid” must fail because it renders superfluous\nthe statute’s additional statement that “[t]he burden of\nestablishing invalidity of a patent . . . shall rest on the\nparty asserting such invalidity.” We agree that if the\npresumption imposes a heightened standard of proof on\nthe patent challenger, then it alone suffices to establish\nthat the defendant bears the burden of persuasion. Cf.\nDirector, Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs v.\nGreenwich Collieries, 512 U. S. 267, 278 (1994) (“A stan\ndard of proof . . . can apply only to a burden of persua\nsion”). Indeed, the Federal Circuit essentially recognized\nas much in American Hoist. See 725 F. 3d, at 1359.\n  But the canon against superfluity assists only where a\ncompeting interpretation gives effect “ ‘to every clause and\nword of a statute.’ ” Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174\n\n——————\n  7 In a similar vein, Microsoft insists that there simply was no settled\n\npresumption of validity for Congress to codify in 1952. Microsoft points\nto a handful of district court decisions, which “question[ed] whether any\npresumption of validity was warranted,” or which “required the pat\nentee to prove the validity of his patent by a preponderance of the\nevidence.” Brief for Petitioner 24 (emphasis deleted; brackets and\ninternal quotation marks omitted); see, e.g., Ginsberg v.

RCA makes clear, however, that the presumption of patent\nvalidity had an established meaning traceable to the mid-19th century,\n293 U. S. 1, 7–8 (1934); that some lower courts doubted its wisdom or\neven pretended it did not exist is of no moment. Microsoft may be\ncorrect that Congress enacted §282 to correct lower courts that required\nthe patentee to prove the validity of a patent. See American Hoist &\nDerrick Co. v. Sowa & Sons, Inc., 725 F. 2d 1350, 1359 (CA Fed. 1984).\nBut the language Congress selected reveals its intent not only to specify\nthat the defendant bears the burden of proving invalidity but also that\nthe evidence in support of the defense must be clear and convincing.\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

Wyeth LLC, 562 U. S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12). Here, no interpretation of\n§282—including the two alternatives advanced by Micro\nsoft—avoids excess language. That is, if the presumption\nonly “allocates the burden of production,” Brief for Peti\ntioner 21, or if it instead “shift[s] both the burden of pro\nduction and the burden of persuasion,” id., at 22 (empha\nsis deleted), then it would be unnecessary in light of §282’s\nstatement that the challenger bears the “burden of estab\nlishing invalidity.” See 21B Fed. Practice §5122, at 401\n(“[T]he same party who has the burden of persuasion also\nstarts out with the burden of producing evidence”). “There\nare times when Congress enacts provisions that are super\nfluous,” Corley v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(ALITO, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 3), and the kind of\nexcess language that Microsoft identifies in §282 is hardly\nunusual in comparison to other statutes that set forth a\npresumption, a burden of persuasion, and a standard of\nproof. Cf., e.g., 28 U. S. C. §2254(e)(1).8\n——————\n  8 For  those of us for whom it is relevant, the legislative history of §282\nprovides additional evidence that Congress meant to codify the judge\nmade presumption of validity, not to set forth a new presumption of\nits own making. The accompanying House and Senate Reports both\nexplain that §282 “introduces a declaration of the presumption of va\nlidity of a patent, which is now a statement made by courts in deci\nsions, but has had no expression in the statute.” H. R. Rep. No. 1923,\n82d Cong., 2d Sess., 10 (1952) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.); S. Rep. No.\n1979, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., 9 (1952) (hereinafter S. Rep.). To the same\neffect, the Reviser’s Note indicates that §282’s “first paragraph declares\nthe existing presumption of validity of patents.” Note following 35\nU. S. C. §282 (1952 ed.).\n   Prior to 1952, the existing patent laws already incorporated the sum\nand substance of the presumption as Microsoft would define it—that is,\nthey “assign[ed] the burden of proving invalidity to the accused in\nfringer,” Brief for Petitioner 14 (emphasis deleted). See 35 U. S. C. §69\n(1946 ed.) (providing that a defendant in an infringement action “may\nplead” and “prove on trial” the invalidity of the patent as a defense); see\n14          MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP \n\n\n                           Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                                B\n\n  Reprising the more limited argument that it pressed\nbelow, Microsoft argues in the alternative that a prepon\nderance standard must at least apply where the evidence\nbefore the factfinder was not before the PTO during the\nexamination process. In particular, it relies on KSR\nInt’l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U. S. 398 (2007), where we ob\nserved that, in these circumstances, “the rationale under\nlying the presumption—that the PTO, in its expertise, has\napproved the claim—seems much diminished.” Id., at 426.\n  That statement is true enough, although other ration\nales may animate the presumption in such circumstances.\nSee The Barbed Wire Patent, 143 U. S. 275, 292 (1892)\n(explaining that because the patentee “first published this\ndevice; put it upon record; made use of it for a practical\npurpose; and gave it to the public . . . . doubts . . . concern\ning the actual inventor . . . should be resolved in favor\nof the patentee”); cf. Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 33 (arguing that even when the administrative cor\nrectness rationale has no relevance, the heightened stan\ndard of proof “serves to protect the patent holder’s reliance\ninterests” in disclosing an invention to the public in\nexchange for patent protection).

II, §6, 1\nStat. 322 (similar); Coffin, 18 Wall., at 124 (explaining that the Patent\nAct of 1836 “allowed a party sued for infringement to prove, among\nother defences, that the patentee was not the original and first inventor\nof the thing patented, or of a substantial and material part thereof\nclaimed to be new” (internal quotation marks omitted)). The House and\nSenate Reports state, however, that §282 established a principle that\npreviously “had no expression in the statute.” H. R. Rep., at 10; S. Rep.,\nat 9. Thus, because the only thing missing from §282’s predecessor was\nthe heightened standard of proof itself, Congress must have understood\nthe presumption of patent validity to include the heightened standard\nof proof attached to it.\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

As established, Congress did just that\nby codifying the common-law presumption of patent valid\nity and, implicitly, the heightened standard of proof at\ntached to it.\n   Our pre-1952 cases never adopted or endorsed the kind\nof fluctuating standard of proof that Microsoft envisions.\nAnd they do not indicate, even in dicta, that anything less\nthan a clear-and-convincing standard would ever apply to\nan invalidity defense raised in an infringement action. To\nthe contrary, the Court spoke on this issue directly in\nRCA, stating that because the heightened standard of\nproof applied where the evidence before the court was\n“different” from that considered by the PTO, it applied\neven more clearly where the evidence was identical. 293\nU. S., at 8. Likewise, the Court’s statement that a “dubi\nous preponderance” will never suffice to sustain an inva\nlidity defense, ibid., admitted of no apparent exceptions.\nFinally, this Court often applied the heightened standard\nof proof without any mention of whether the relevant\nprior-art evidence had been before the PTO examiner, in\ncircumstances strongly suggesting it had not. See, e.g.,\nSmith, 301 U. S., at 227, 233.9\n   Nothing in §282’s text suggests that Congress meant to\n——————\n  9 Microsoft cites numerous court of appeals decisions as support for\nits claim that a preponderance standard must apply in the event that\nthe evidence in the infringement action varies from that considered by\nthe PTO. We see no hint of the hybrid standard of proof that Microsoft\nadvocates in these cases. Indeed, in some of these cases it appears that\nthe court even evaluated the evidence according to a heightened stan\ndard of proof. See Jacuzzi Bros., Inc. v. Berkeley Pump Co., 191 F. 2d\n632, 634 (CA9 1951) (“Although it is not expressly stated that th[e]\nconclusion [of invalidity] is based upon evidence establishing the thesis\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, the Trial Court expressed no doubt. And\nthe record shows that such conclusion was supported by substantial\nevidence”); Western Auto Supply Co. v. American-National Co., 114\nF. 2d 711, 713 (CA6 1940) (concluding that the patent was invalid\nwhere the court “entertain[ed] no doubt” on the question).\n16          MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ndepart from that understanding to enact a standard of\nproof that would rise and fall with the facts of each\ncase. Indeed, had Congress intended to drop the heightened\nstandard of proof where the evidence before the jury var\nied from that before the PTO—and thus to take the un\nusual and impractical step of enacting a variable standard\nof proof that must itself be adjudicated in each case, cf.\nSantosky v. Kramer, 455 U. S. 745, 757 (1982)10—we as\nsume it would have said so expressly.\n  To be sure, numerous courts of appeals in the years\npreceding the 1952 Act observed that the presumption of\nvalidity is “weakened” or “dissipated” in the circumstance\nthat the evidence in an infringement action was never\nconsidered by the PTO. See Jacuzzi Bros., Inc. v. Berkeley\nPump Co., 191 F. 2d 632, 634 (CA9 1951) (“largely dissi\npated”); H. Schindler & Co. v. C. Saladino & Sons, 81\nF. 2d 649, 651 (CA1 1936) (“weakened”); Gillette Safety\nRazor Co. v. Cliff Weil Cigar Co., 107 F. 2d 105, 107 (CA4\n1939) (“greatly weakened”); Butler Mfg. Co. v. Enterprise\nCleaning Co., 81 F. 2d 711, 716 (CA8 1936) (“weakened”).\nBut we cannot read these cases to hold or even to suggest\nthat a preponderance standard would apply in such cir\n——————\n   10 Not the least of the impracticalities of such an approach arises from\n\nthe fact that whether a PTO examiner considered a particular reference\nwill often be a question without a clear answer.

Instead, we understand these cases to reflect\nthe same commonsense principle that the Federal Circuit\nhas recognized throughout its existence—namely, that\nnew evidence supporting an invalidity defense may “carry\nmore weight” in an infringement action than evidence\npreviously considered by the PTO, American Hoist, 725\nF. 2d, at 1360. \tAs Judge Rich explained:\n    “When new evidence touching validity of the patent\n    not considered by the PTO is relied on, the tribunal\n    considering it is not faced with having to disagree\n    with the PTO or with deferring to its judgment or\n    with taking its expertise into account. The evidence\n    may, therefore, carry more weight and go further to\n    ward sustaining the attacker’s unchanging burden.”\n    Ibid. (emphasis deleted)\nSee also SIBIA Neurosciences, Inc. v. Cadus Pharmaceuti\ncal Corp., 225 F. 3d 1349, 1355–1356 (CA Fed. 2000)\n(“[T]he alleged infringer’s burden may be more easily car\nried because of th[e] additional [evidence]”); Group One,\nLtd. v. Hallmark Cards, Inc., 407 F. 3d 1297, 1306 (CA\nFed. 2005) (similar).\n   Simply put, if the PTO did not have all material facts\nbefore it, its considered judgment may lose significant\nforce. Cf. KSR, 550 U. S., at 427. And, concomitantly, the\nchallenger’s burden to persuade the jury of its invalidity\ndefense by clear and convincing evidence may be easier to\nsustain. In this respect, although we have no occasion to\nendorse any particular formulation, we note that a jury\ninstruction on the effect of new evidence can, and when\nrequested, most often should be given. When warranted,\nthe jury may be instructed to consider that it has heard\nevidence that the PTO had no opportunity to evaluate\nbefore granting the patent.

In either case, the jury may be instructed\nto evaluate whether the evidence before it is materially\nnew, and if so, to consider that fact when determining\nwhether an invalidity defense has been proved by clear\nand convincing evidence. Cf., e.g., Mendenhall v. Cedarap\nids, Inc., 5 F. 3d 1557, 1563–1564 (CA Fed. 1993); see\nalso Brief for International Business Machines Corp. as\nAmicus Curiae 31–37. Although Microsoft emphasized in\nits argument to the jury that S4 was never considered by\nthe PTO, it failed to request an instruction along these\nlines from the District Court. Now, in its reply brief in\nthis Court, Microsoft insists that an instruction of this\nkind was warranted. Reply Brief for Petitioner 22–23.\nThat argument, however, comes far too late, and we there\nfore refuse to consider it. See Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v.\nJackson, 561 U.

Microsoft and\nits amici contend that the heightened standard of proof\ndampens innovation by unduly insulating “bad” patents\nfrom invalidity challenges. They point to the high invali\ndation rate as evidence that the PTO grants patent protec\ntion to too many undeserving “inventions.” They claim\nthat inter partes reexamination proceedings before the\nPTO cannot fix the problem, as some grounds for invalida\ntion (like the on-sale bar at issue here) cannot be raised in\nsuch proceedings. They question the deference that the\nPTO’s expert determinations warrant, in light of the\nagency’s resources and procedures, which they deem in\nadequate. And, they insist that the heightened standard\nof proof essentially causes juries to abdicate their role in\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141,\n150–151 (1989), and the incentives for inventors to dis\nclose their innovations to the public in exchange for patent\nprotection. They disagree with the notion that the patent\nissuance rate is above the optimal level. They explain that\nlimits on the reexamination process reflect a judgment by\nCongress as to the appropriate degree of interference with\npatentees’ reliance interests. Finally, they maintain that\njuries that are properly instructed as to the application of\nthe clear-and-convincing-evidence standard can, and often\ndo, find an invalidity defense established.\n   We find ourselves in no position to judge the compara\ntive force of these policy arguments. For nearly 30 years,\nthe Federal Circuit has interpreted §282 as we do today.\nDuring this period, Congress has often amended §282, see,\ne.g., Pub. L. 104–141, §2, 109 Stat. 352; Pub. L. 98–417,\n§203, 98 Stat. 1603; not once, so far as we (and Microsoft)\nare aware, has it even considered a proposal to lower the\nstandard of proof, see Tr. Oral Arg. 10. Moreover, Con\ngress has amended the patent laws to account for concerns\nabout “bad” patents, including by expanding the reexami\nnation process to provide for inter partes proceedings. See\nOptional Inter Partes Reexamination Procedure Act of\n1999, 113 Stat. 1501A–567, codified at 35 U. S. C. §311 et\nseq. Through it all, the evidentiary standard adopted in\n§282 has gone untouched. Indeed, Congress has left the\nFederal Circuit’s interpretation of §282 in place despite\nongoing criticism, both from within the Federal Govern\n20          MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD.

I write separately be\ncause, given the technical but important nature of the\ninvalidity question, I believe it worth emphasizing that in\nthis area of law as in others the evidentiary standard of\nproof applies to questions of fact and not to questions of\nlaw. See, e.g., Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 423\n(1979). Thus a factfinder must use the “clear and convinc\ning” standard where there are disputes about, say, when a\nproduct was first sold or whether a prior art reference had\nbeen published.\n   Many claims of invalidity rest, however, not upon fac\ntual disputes, but upon how the law applies to facts as\ngiven. Do the given facts show that the product was pre\nviously “in public use”? 35 U. S. C. §102(b). Do they show\nthat the invention was “nove[l]” and that it was “non\nobvious”? §§102, 103. Do they show that the patent ap\nplicant described his claims properly? §112. Where the\nultimate question of patent validity turns on the correct\nanswer to legal questions—what these subsidiary legal\nstandards mean or how they apply to the facts as given—\ntoday’s strict standard of proof has no application. See,\ne.g., Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383 U. S. 1,\n17 (1966); Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co. v. Chemque, Inc.,\n2        MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD.

S. 370 (1996).\n   Courts can help to keep the application of today’s “clear\nand convincing” standard within its proper legal bounds\nby separating factual and legal aspects of an invalidity\nclaim, say, by using instructions based on case-specific\ncircumstances that help the jury make the distinction or\nby using interrogatories and special verdicts to make clear\nwhich specific factual findings underlie the jury’s conclu\nsions. See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 49 and 51. By isolating\nthe facts (determined with help of the “clear and convinc\ning” standard), courts can thereby assure the proper in\nterpretation or application of the correct legal standard\n(without use of the “clear and convincing” standard). By\npreventing the “clear and convincing” standard from roam\ning outside its fact-related reservation, courts can increase\nthe likelihood that discoveries or inventions will not re\nceive legal protection where none is due.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

S. C. §282; see\nante, at 7. “[W]here Congress borrows terms of art,” this\nCourt presumes that Congress “knows and adopts the\ncluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word\n. . . and the meaning its use will convey to the judicial\nmind.” Morissette v. United States, 342 U. S. 246, 263\n(1952). But I do not think that the words “[a] patent shall\nbe presumed valid” so clearly conveyed a particular stan\ndard of proof to the judicial mind in 1952 as to constitute\na term of art.

Therefore, I would not\nconclude that Congress’ use of that phrase codified a stan\ndard of proof.\n  Nevertheless, I reach the same outcome as the Court.\nBecause §282 is silent as to the standard of proof, it did\nnot alter the common-law rule.

Argued April 18, 2011—Decided June 9, 2011\nIn asserting patent invalidity as a defense to an infringement action, an\n  alleged infringer must contend with §282 of the Patent Act of 1952\n  (Act), under which “[a] patent shall be presumed valid” and “[t]he\n  burden of establishing invalidity . . . shall rest on the party asserting”\n  it. Since 1984, the Federal Circuit has read §282 to require a defen\n  dant seeking to overcome the presumption to persuade the factfinder\n  of its invalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence.\n     Respondents (collectively, i4i) hold the patent at issue, which\n  claims an improved method for editing computer documents. After\n  i4i sued petitioner Microsoft Corp. for willful infringement of that\n  patent, Microsoft counterclaimed and sought a declaration that the\n  patent was invalid under §102(b)’s on-sale bar, which precludes pat\n  ent protection for any “invention” that was “on sale in this country”\n  more than one year prior to the filing of a patent application. The\n  parties agreed that, more than a year before filing its patent applica\n  tion, i4i had sold a software program known as S4 in the United\n  States, but they disagreed over whether that software embodied the\n  invention claimed in i4i’s patent. Relying on the undisputed fact that\n  the S4 software was never presented to the Patent and Trademark\n  Office (PTO) during its examination of the patent application, Micro\n  soft objected to i4i’s proposed jury instruction that the invalidity de\n  fense must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. The District\n  Court nevertheless gave that instruction, rejecting Microsoft’s alter\n  native instruction proposing a preponderance of the evidence stan\n  dard. The jury found that Microsoft willfully infringed the i4i patent\n  and had failed to prove the patent’s invalidity. The Federal Circuit\n  affirmed, relying on its settled interpretation of §282.\n2          MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld: Section 282 requires an invalidity defense to be proved by clear\n and convincing evidence. Pp. 5–20.\n    (a) The Court rejects Microsoft’s contention that a defendant need\n only persuade the jury of a patent invalidity defense by a preponder\n ance of the evidence. Where Congress has prescribed the governing\n standard of proof, its choice generally controls. Steadman v. SEC,\n 450 U. S. 91, 95. Congress has made such a choice here. While §282\n includes no express articulation of the standard of proof, where Con\n gress uses a common-law term in a statute, the Court assumes the\n “term . . . comes with a common law meaning.” Safeco Ins. Co. of\n America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 58. Here, by stating that a patent is\n “presumed valid,” §282, Congress used a term with a settled common\n law meaning. Radio Corp. of America v. Radio Engineering Labora\n tories, Inc., 293 U. S. 1 (RCA), is authoritative. There, tracing nearly\n a century of case law, the Court stated, inter alia, that “there is a\n presumption of [patent] validity [that is] not to be overthrown except\n by clear and cogent evidence,” id., at 2. Microsoft’s contention that\n the Court’s pre-Act precedents applied a clear-and-convincing stan\n dard only in two limited circumstances is unavailing, given the ab\n sence of those qualifications from the Court’s cases. Also unpersua\n sive is Microsoft’s argument that the Federal Circuit’s interpretation\n must fail because it renders superfluous §282’s additional statement\n that “[t]he burden of establishing invalidity . . . shall rest on the\n party asserting” it. The canon against superfluity assists only where\n a competing interpretation gives effect “ ‘to every clause and word of\n a statute.’ ” Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174. Here, no inter\n pretation of §282 avoids excess language because, under either of Mi\n crosoft’s alternative theories—that the presumption only allocates\n the burden of production or that it shifts both the burdens of produc\n tion and persuasion—the presumption itself would be unnecessary in\n light of §282’s additional statement as to the challenger’s burden.\n Pp. 5–13.\n    (b) Also rejected is Microsoft’s argument that a preponderance\n standard must at least apply where the evidence before the factfinder\n was not before the PTO during the examination process. It is true\n enough that, in these circumstances, “the rationale underlying the\n presumption—that the PTO, in its expertise, has approved the\n claim—seems much diminished,” KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550\n U. S. 398, 426, though other rationales may still animate the pre\n sumption. But the question remains whether Congress has specified\n the applicable standard of proof. As established here today, Congress\n did just that by codifying the common-law presumption of patent va\n lidity and, implicitly, the heightened standard of proof attached to it.\n The Court’s pre-Act cases never adopted or endorsed Microsoft’s fluc\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  tuating standard of proof. And they do not indicate, even in dicta,\n  that anything less than a clear-and-convincing standard would ever\n  apply to an invalidity defense. In fact, the Court indicated to the con\n  trary. See RCA, 293 U. S., at 8. Finally, the Court often applied the\n  heightened standard of proof without mentioning whether the rele\n  vant prior-art evidence had been before the PTO examiner, in cir\n  cumstances strongly suggesting it had not. See, e.g., Smith v. Hall,\n  301 U. S. 216, 227, 233. Nothing in §282’s text suggests that Con\n  gress meant to depart from that understanding to enact a standard of\n  proof that would rise and fall with the facts of each case. Indeed, had\n  Congress intended to drop the heightened standard of proof where\n  the evidence before the jury varied from that before the PTO, it pre\n  sumably would have said so expressly. Those pre-Act cases where\n  various Courts of Appeals observed that the presumption is weak\n  ened or dissipated where the evidence was never considered by the\n  PTO should be read to reflect the commonsense principle that if the\n  PTO did not have all material facts before it, its considered judgment\n  may lose significant force. Cf. KSR, 550 U. S., at 427. Consistent\n  with that principle, a jury may be instructed to evaluate whether the\n  evidence before it is materially new, and if so, to consider that fact\n  when determining whether an invalidity defense has been proved by\n  clear and convincing evidence. Pp. 14–18.\n     (c) This Court is in no position to judge the comparative force of the\n  parties’ policy arguments as to the wisdom of the clear-and\n  convincing-evidence standard that Congress adopted.            Congress\n  specified the applicable standard of proof in 1952 when it codified the\n  common-law presumption of patent validity. During the nearly 30\n  years that the Federal Circuit has interpreted §282 as the Court does\n  today, Congress has often amended §282 and other patent laws, but\n  apparently has never considered any proposal to lower the standard\n  of proof. Indeed, Congress has left the Federal Circuit’s interpreta\n  tion in place despite ongoing criticism, both from within the Federal\n  Government and without. Accordingly, any recalibration of the stan\n  dard of proof remains in Congress’ hands.

S. C. §282. We\nconsider whether §282 requires an invalidity defense to be\nproved by clear and convincing evidence. We hold that it\ndoes.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n  Pursuant to its authority under the Patent Clause, U. S.\nConst., Art. I, §8, cl. 8, Congress has charged the United\nStates Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) with the task\nof examining patent applications, 35 U. S. C. §2(a)(1), and\nissuing patents if “it appears that the applicant is entitled\nto a patent under the law,” §131. Congress has set forth\nthe prerequisites for issuance of a patent, which the PTO\nmust evaluate in the examination process. To receive\npatent protection a claimed invention must, among other\nthings, fall within one of the express categories of pat\nentable subject matter, §101, and be novel, §102, and\n2        MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnonobvious, §103. Most relevant here, the on-sale bar of\n§102(b) precludes patent protection for any “invention”\nthat was “on sale in this country” more than one year prior\nto the filing of a patent application. See generally Pfaff v.\nWells Electronics, Inc., 525 U. S. 55, 67–68 (1998). In\nevaluating whether these and other statutory conditions\nhave been met, PTO examiners must make various factual\ndeterminations—for instance, the state of the prior art in\nthe field and the nature of the advancement embodied in\nthe invention. See Dickinson v. Zurko, 527 U. S. 150, 153\n(1999).\n   Once issued, a patent grants certain exclusive rights to\nits holder, including the exclusive right to use the inven\ntion during the patent’s duration. To enforce that right, a\npatentee can bring a civil action for infringement if an\nother person “without authority makes, uses, offers to sell,\nor sells any patented invention, within the United States.”\n§271(a); see also §281.\n   Among other defenses under §282 of the Patent Act of\n1952 (1952 Act), an alleged infringer may assert the inva\nlidity of the patent—that is, he may attempt to prove that\nthe patent never should have issued in the first place. See\n§§282(2), (3). A defendant may argue, for instance, that\nthe claimed invention was obvious at the time and thus\nthat one of the conditions of patentability was lacking.\nSee §282(2); see also §103. “While the ultimate question of\npatent validity is one of law,” Graham v. John Deere Co.\nof Kansas City, 383 U. S. 1, 17 (1966) (citing Great Atlantic\n& Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340\nU. S. 147, 155 (1950) (Douglas, J., concurring)); see post,\nat 1 (BREYER, J., concurring), the same factual questions\nunderlying the PTO’s original examination of a patent ap\nplication will also bear on an invalidity defense in an in\nfringement action.

Judge\nRich, a principal drafter of the 1952 Act, articulated this\nview for the court in American Hoist & Derrick Co. v.\nSowa & Sons, Inc., 725 F. 2d 1350 (CA Fed. 1984). There,\nthe Federal Circuit held that §282 codified “the existing\npresumption of validity of patents,” id., at 1359 (internal\nquotation marks omitted)—what, until that point, had\nbeen a common-law presumption based on “the basic\nproposition that a government agency such as the [PTO]\nwas presumed to do its job,” ibid. Relying on this Court’s\npre-1952 precedent as to the “force of the presumption,”\nibid. (citing Radio Corp. of America v. Radio Engineering\nLaboratories, Inc., 293 U. S. 1 (1934) (RCA)), Judge Rich\nconcluded:\n     “[Section] 282 creates a presumption that a patent is\n     valid and imposes the burden of proving invalidity on\n     the attacker. That burden is constant and never\n     changes and is to convince the court of invalidity by\n     clear evidence.” 725 F. 2d, at 1360.\nIn the nearly 30 years since American Hoist, the Federal\nCircuit has never wavered in this interpretation of §282.\nSee, e.g., Greenwood v. Hattori Seiko Co., 900 F. 2d 238,\n——————\n  1 As originally enacted in 1952, the first paragraph of §282 read: “A\n\npatent shall be presumed valid. The burden of establishing invalidity\nof a patent shall rest on a party asserting it.” 66 Stat. 812. Congress\nhas since amended §282, inserting two sentences not relevant here and\nmodifying the language of the second sentence to that in the text.\n4        MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD.

(collectively, i4i) hold the patent\nat issue in this suit. The i4i patent claims an improved\nmethod for editing computer documents, which stores a\ndocument’s content separately from the metacodes asso\nciated with the document’s structure. In 2007, i4i sued\npetitioner Microsoft Corporation for willful infringement,\nclaiming that Microsoft’s manufacture and sale of certain\nMicrosoft Word products infringed i4i’s patent. In addi\ntion to denying infringement, Microsoft counterclaimed\nand sought a declaration that i4i’s patent was invalid and\nunenforceable.\n   Specifically and as relevant here, Microsoft claimed that\nthe on-sale bar of §102(b) rendered the patent invalid,\npointing to i4i’s prior sale of a software program known as\nS4. The parties agreed that, more than one year prior to\nthe filing of the i4i patent application, i4i had sold S4\nin the United States. They presented opposing arguments\nto the jury, however, as to whether that software embod\nied the invention claimed in i4i’s patent. Because the\nsoftware’s source code had been destroyed years before the\ncommencement of this litigation, the factual dispute\nturned largely on trial testimony by S4’s two inventors—\nalso the named inventors on the i4i patent—both of whom\ntestified that S4 did not practice the key invention dis\nclosed in the patent.\n   Relying on the undisputed fact that the S4 software was\nnever presented to the PTO examiner, Microsoft objected\nto i4i’s proposed instruction that it was required to prove\nits invalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence.\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

How\n     ever, Microsoft’s burden of proof with regard to its\n     defense of invalidity based on prior art that the ex\n     aminer did not review during the prosecution of the\n     patent-in-suit is by preponderance of the evidence.’ ”\n     Ibid.\nRejecting the hybrid standard of proof that Microsoft\nadvocated, the District Court instructed the jury that\n“Microsoft has the burden of proving invalidity by clear\nand convincing evidence.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 195a.\n   The jury found that Microsoft willfully infringed the i4i\npatent and that Microsoft failed to prove invalidity due to\nthe on-sale bar or otherwise. Denying Microsoft’s post\ntrial motions, the District Court rejected Microsoft’s con\ntention that the court improperly instructed the jury on\nthe standard of proof. The Court of Appeals for the Fed\neral Circuit affirmed.2 598 F. 3d 831, 848 (2010). Relying\non its settled interpretation of §282, the court explained\nthat it could “discern [no] error” in the jury instruction\nrequiring Microsoft to prove its invalidity defense by clear\nand convincing evidence.

SEC, 450 U. S. 91, 95\n(1981). The question, then, is whether Congress has made\nsuch a choice here.\n   As stated, the first paragraph of §282 provides that\n“[a] patent shall be presumed valid” and “[t]he burden of\nestablishing invalidity of a patent or any claim thereof\nshall rest on the party asserting such invalidity.” Thus, by\nits express terms, §282 establishes a presumption of pat\nent validity, and it provides that a challenger must over\ncome that presumption to prevail on an invalidity defense.\nBut, while the statute explicitly specifies the burden of\nproof, it includes no express articulation of the standard of\nproof.4\n——————\n   3 i4i contends that Microsoft forfeited the first argument by failing to\n\nraise it until its merits brief in this Court. The argument, however, is\nwithin the scope of the question presented, and because we reject it on\nits merits, we need not decide whether it has been preserved.\n   4 A preliminary word on terminology is in order. As we have said,\n\n“[t]he term ‘burden of proof’ is one of the ‘the slipperiest members of\nthe family of legal terms.’ ” Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. 49, 56 (2005)\n(quoting 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence §342, p. 433 (5th ed.\n1999) (alteration omitted)). Historically, the term has encompassed two\nseparate burdens: the “burden of persuasion” (specifying which party\nloses if the evidence is balanced), as well as the “burden of production”\n(specifying which party must come forward with evidence at various\nstages in the litigation). Ibid. Adding more confusion, the term “bur\nden of proof” has occasionally been used as a synonym for “standard of\nproof.” E.g., Grogan v. Garner, 498 U. S. 279, 286 (1991).\n   Here we use “burden of proof” interchangeably with “burden of per\nsuasion” to identify the party who must persuade the jury in its favor to\nprevail. We use the term “standard of proof” to refer to the degree of\ncertainty by which the factfinder must be persuaded of a factual conclu\n                      Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                       7\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   Our statutory inquiry, however, cannot simply end\nthere. We begin, of course, with “the assumption that the\nordinary meaning of the language” chosen by Congress\n“accurately expresses the legislative purpose.” Engine\nMfrs. Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist.,\n541 U. S. 246, 252 (2004) (internal quotation marks omit\nted). But where Congress uses a common-law term in a\nstatute, we assume the “term . . . comes with a common\nlaw meaning, absent anything pointing another way.”\nSafeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 58 (2007)\n(citing Beck v. Prupis, 529 U. S. 494, 500–501 (2000)).\nHere, by stating that a patent is “presumed valid,” §282,\nCongress used a term with a settled meaning in the com\nmon law.\n   Our decision in RCA, 293 U. S. 1, is authoritative.\nThere, tracing nearly a century of case law from this Court\nand others, Justice Cardozo wrote for a unanimous Court\nthat “there is a presumption of validity, a presumption not\nto be overthrown except by clear and cogent evidence.”\nId., at 2. Although the “force” of the presumption found\n“varying expression” in this Court and elsewhere, id., at 7,\nJustice Cardozo explained, one “common core of thought\nand truth” unified the decisions:\n     “[O]ne otherwise an infringer who assails the validity\n     of a patent fair upon its face bears a heavy burden of\n     persuasion, and fails unless his evidence has more\n     than a dubious preponderance. If that is true where\n—————— \n\nsion to find in favor of the party bearing the burden of persuasion. See \n\nAddington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 423 (1979). In other words, the term\n\n“standard of proof” specifies how difficult it will be for the party bearing \n\nthe burden of persuasion to convince the jury of the facts in its favor. \n\nVarious standards of proof are familiar—beyond a reasonable doubt, by\n\nclear and convincing evidence, and by a preponderance of the evidence. \n\nSee generally 21B C. Wright & K. Graham, Federal Practice & Proce\ndure §5122, pp. 405–411 (2d ed. 2005) (hereinafter Fed. Practice)\n\n(describing these and other standards of proof). \n\n8          MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n     the assailant connects himself in some way with the\n     title of the true inventor, it is so a fortiori where he is\n     a stranger to the invention, without claim of title of\n     his own. If it is true where the assailant launches his\n     attack with evidence different, at least in form, from\n     any theretofore produced in opposition to the patent,\n     it is so a bit more clearly where the evidence is\n     even verbally the same.” Id., at 8 (internal citation\n     omitted).5\nThe common-law presumption, in other words, reflected\nthe universal understanding that a preponderance stan\ndard of proof was too “dubious” a basis to deem a patent\ninvalid. Ibid.; see also id., at 7 (“[A] patent . . . is pre\nsumed to be valid until the presumption has been over\ncome by convincing evidence of error”).\n  Thus, by the time Congress enacted §282 and declared\nthat a patent is “presumed valid,” the presumption of\npatent validity had long been a fixture of the common law.\nAccording to its settled meaning, a defendant raising an\ninvalidity defense bore “a heavy burden of persuasion,”\nrequiring proof of the defense by clear and convincing\nevidence. Id., at 8. That is, the presumption encompassed\nnot only an allocation of the burden of proof but also an\nimposition of a heightened standard of proof.

Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 23 (1999);\nsee also id., at 21 (“ ‘Where Congress uses terms that have\naccumulated settled meaning under . . . the common law,\n[we] must infer, unless the statute otherwise dictates, that\nCongress means to incorporate the established meaning of\nthose terms.’ ” (quoting Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Dar\nden, 503 U. S. 318, 322 (1992))); Standard Oil Co. of N. J.\nv. United Sates, 221 U. S. 1, 59 (1911) (“[W]here words are\nemployed in a statute which had at the time a well-known\nmeaning at common law or in the law of this country they\nare presumed to have been used in that sense . . .”). “On\nthe contrary, we must presume that Congress intended to\nincorporate” the heightened standard of proof, “unless the\nstatute otherwise dictates.” Neder, 527 U. S., at 23 (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted).\n   We recognize that it may be unusual to treat a presump\ntion as alone establishing the governing standard of proof.\nSee, e.g., J. Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at\nthe Common Law 336–337 (1898) (hereinafter Thayer)\n(“When . . . we read that the contrary of any particular\npresumption must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, . . .\nit is to be recognized that we have something superadded\nto the rule of presumption, namely, another rule as to\nthe amount of evidence which is needed to overcome the\npresumption”). But given how judges, including Justice\nCardozo, repeatedly understood and explained the pre\nsumption of patent validity, we cannot accept Microsoft’s\nargument that Congress used the words “presumed valid”\nto adopt only a procedural device for “shifting the burden\nof production,” or for “shifting both the burden of produc\ntion and the burden of persuasion.” Brief for Petitioner\n21–22 (emphasis deleted).

Beck, 529 U. S., at 501 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). And RCA leaves no doubt that\nattached to the common-law presumption of patent valid\nity was an expression as to its “force,” 293 U. S., at 7—that\nis, the standard of proof required to overcome it.6\n   Resisting the conclusion that Congress adopted the\nheightened standard of proof reflected in our pre-1952\ncases, Microsoft contends that those cases applied a clear\nand-convincing standard of proof only in two limited\ncircumstances, not in every case involving an invalidity\ndefense. First, according to Microsoft, the heightened\nstandard of proof applied in cases “involving oral testi\nmony of prior invention,” simply to account for the unreli\nability of such testimony. Brief for Petitioner 25. Second,\nMicrosoft tells us, the heightened standard of proof ap\nplied to “invalidity challenges based on priority of inven\ntion,” where that issue had previously been litigated\nbetween the parties in PTO proceedings. Id., at 28.\n   Squint as we may, we fail to see the qualifications that\nMicrosoft purports to identify in our cases. They certainly\nmake no appearance in RCA’s explanation of the presump\n——————\n  6 Microsoft objects that this reading of §282 “conflicts with the usual\n\nunderstanding of presumptions.” Reply Brief for Petitioner 4. In sup\nport, it relies on the “understanding” reflected in Federal Rule of\nEvidence 301, which explains the ordinary effect of a presumption in\nfederal civil actions. That Rule, however, postdates the 1952 Act by\nnearly 30 years, and it is not dispositive of how Congress in 1952\nunderstood presumptions generally, much less the presumption of pat\nent validity. In any event, the word “presumption” has often been\nused when another term might be more accurate. See Thayer 335\n(“Often . . . maxims and ground principles get expressed in this form of\na presumption perversely and inaccurately”). And, to the extent\nCongress used the words “presumed valid” in an imprecise way, we\ncannot fault it for following our lead.\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion of patent validity. RCA simply said, without qualifi\ncation, “that one otherwise an infringer who assails the\nvalidity of a patent fair upon its face bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion, and fails unless his evidence has more than\na dubious preponderance.” 293 U. S., at 8; see also id., at\n7 (“A patent regularly issued, and even more obviously\na patent issued after a hearing of all the rival claimants,\nis presumed to be valid until the presumption has been\novercome by convincing evidence of error” (emphasis\nadded)). Nor do they appear in any of our cases as express\nlimitations on the application of the heightened standard\nof proof. Cf., e.g., Smith v. Hall, 301 U. S. 216, 233 (1937)\n(citing RCA for the proposition that a “heavy burden of\npersuasion . . . rests upon one who seeks to negative nov\nelty in a patent by showing prior use”); Mumm v. Jacob E.\nDecker & Sons, 301 U. S. 168, 171 (1937) (“Not only is the\nburden to make good this defense upon the party setting it\nup, but his burden is a heavy one, as it has been held that\nevery reasonable doubt should be resolved against him”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). In fact, Microsoft\nitself admits that our cases “could be read as announcing a\nheightened standard applicable to all invalidity asser\ntions.” Brief for Petitioner 30 (emphasis deleted).\n   Furthermore, we cannot agree that Microsoft’s proposed\nlimitations are inherent—even if unexpressed—in our\npre-1952 cases. As early as 1874 we explained that the\nburden of proving prior inventorship “rests upon [the de\nfendant], and every reasonable doubt should be resolved\nagainst him,” without tying that rule to the vagaries and\nmanipulability of oral testimony. Coffin v. Ogden, 18\nWall. 120, 124 (1874). And, more than 60 years later, we\napplied that rule where the evidence in support of a prior\nuse defense included documentary proof—not just oral\ntestimony—in a case presenting no priority issues at all.\nSee Smith, 301 U. S., at 221, 233. Thus, even if Congress\nsearched for some unstated limitations on the heightened\n12         MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nstandard of proof in our cases, it would have found none.7\n  Microsoft also argues that the Federal Circuit’s inter\npretation of §282’s statement that “[a] patent shall be pre\nsumed valid” must fail because it renders superfluous\nthe statute’s additional statement that “[t]he burden of\nestablishing invalidity of a patent . . . shall rest on the\nparty asserting such invalidity.” We agree that if the\npresumption imposes a heightened standard of proof on\nthe patent challenger, then it alone suffices to establish\nthat the defendant bears the burden of persuasion. Cf.\nDirector, Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs v.\nGreenwich Collieries, 512 U. S. 267, 278 (1994) (“A stan\ndard of proof . . . can apply only to a burden of persua\nsion”). Indeed, the Federal Circuit essentially recognized\nas much in American Hoist. See 725 F. 3d, at 1359.\n  But the canon against superfluity assists only where a\ncompeting interpretation gives effect “ ‘to every clause and\nword of a statute.’ ” Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174\n\n——————\n  7 In a similar vein, Microsoft insists that there simply was no settled\n\npresumption of validity for Congress to codify in 1952. Microsoft points\nto a handful of district court decisions, which “question[ed] whether any\npresumption of validity was warranted,” or which “required the pat\nentee to prove the validity of his patent by a preponderance of the\nevidence.” Brief for Petitioner 24 (emphasis deleted; brackets and\ninternal quotation marks omitted); see, e.g., Ginsberg v. Railway\nExpress Agency, Inc., 72 F. Supp. 43, 44 (SDNY 1947) (stating, in dicta,\nthat “[i]t may now well be said that no presumption whatever arises\nfrom the grant of patent”); see also post, at 1 (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment). RCA makes clear, however, that the presumption of patent\nvalidity had an established meaning traceable to the mid-19th century,\n293 U. S. 1, 7–8 (1934); that some lower courts doubted its wisdom or\neven pretended it did not exist is of no moment. Microsoft may be\ncorrect that Congress enacted §282 to correct lower courts that required\nthe patentee to prove the validity of a patent. See American Hoist &\nDerrick Co. v. Sowa & Sons, Inc., 725 F. 2d 1350, 1359 (CA Fed. 1984).\nBut the language Congress selected reveals its intent not only to specify\nthat the defendant bears the burden of proving invalidity but also that\nthe evidence in support of the defense must be clear and convincing.\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

That is, if the presumption\nonly “allocates the burden of production,” Brief for Peti\ntioner 21, or if it instead “shift[s] both the burden of pro\nduction and the burden of persuasion,” id., at 22 (empha\nsis deleted), then it would be unnecessary in light of §282’s\nstatement that the challenger bears the “burden of estab\nlishing invalidity.” See 21B Fed. Practice §5122, at 401\n(“[T]he same party who has the burden of persuasion also\nstarts out with the burden of producing evidence”). “There\nare times when Congress enacts provisions that are super\nfluous,” Corley v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(ALITO, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 3), and the kind of\nexcess language that Microsoft identifies in §282 is hardly\nunusual in comparison to other statutes that set forth a\npresumption, a burden of persuasion, and a standard of\nproof. Cf., e.g., 28 U. S. C. §2254(e)(1).8\n——————\n  8 For  those of us for whom it is relevant, the legislative history of §282\nprovides additional evidence that Congress meant to codify the judge\nmade presumption of validity, not to set forth a new presumption of\nits own making. The accompanying House and Senate Reports both\nexplain that §282 “introduces a declaration of the presumption of va\nlidity of a patent, which is now a statement made by courts in deci\nsions, but has had no expression in the statute.” H. R. Rep. No. 1923,\n82d Cong., 2d Sess., 10 (1952) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.); S. Rep. No.\n1979, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., 9 (1952) (hereinafter S. Rep.). To the same\neffect, the Reviser’s Note indicates that §282’s “first paragraph declares\nthe existing presumption of validity of patents.” Note following 35\nU. S. C. §282 (1952 ed.).\n   Prior to 1952, the existing patent laws already incorporated the sum\nand substance of the presumption as Microsoft would define it—that is,\nthey “assign[ed] the burden of proving invalidity to the accused in\nfringer,” Brief for Petitioner 14 (emphasis deleted). See 35 U. S. C. §69\n(1946 ed.)

S. 398 (2007), where we ob\nserved that, in these circumstances, “the rationale under\nlying the presumption—that the PTO, in its expertise, has\napproved the claim—seems much diminished.” Id., at 426.\n  That statement is true enough, although other ration\nales may animate the presumption in such circumstances.\nSee The Barbed Wire Patent, 143 U. S. 275, 292 (1892)\n(explaining that because the patentee “first published this\ndevice; put it upon record; made use of it for a practical\npurpose; and gave it to the public . . . . doubts . . . concern\ning the actual inventor . . . should be resolved in favor\nof the patentee”); cf. Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 33 (arguing that even when the administrative cor\nrectness rationale has no relevance, the heightened stan\ndard of proof “serves to protect the patent holder’s reliance\ninterests” in disclosing an invention to the public in\nexchange for patent protection). The question remains,\nhowever, whether Congress has specified the applicable\n——————\nalso Patent Act of 1870, ch. 230, §61, 16 Stat. 208 (same); Patent Act of\n1836, ch. 357, §15, 5 Stat. 123 (similar); Patent Act of 1793, ch. II, §6, 1\nStat. 322 (similar); Coffin, 18 Wall., at 124 (explaining that the Patent\nAct of 1836 “allowed a party sued for infringement to prove, among\nother defences, that the patentee was not the original and first inventor\nof the thing patented, or of a substantial and material part thereof\nclaimed to be new” (internal quotation marks omitted)). The House and\nSenate Reports state, however, that §282 established a principle that\npreviously “had no expression in the statute.” H. R. Rep., at 10; S. Rep.,\nat 9. Thus, because the only thing missing from §282’s predecessor was\nthe heightened standard of proof itself, Congress must have understood\nthe presumption of patent validity to include the heightened standard\nof proof attached to it.\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

As established, Congress did just that\nby codifying the common-law presumption of patent valid\nity and, implicitly, the heightened standard of proof at\ntached to it.\n   Our pre-1952 cases never adopted or endorsed the kind\nof fluctuating standard of proof that Microsoft envisions.\nAnd they do not indicate, even in dicta, that anything less\nthan a clear-and-convincing standard would ever apply to\nan invalidity defense raised in an infringement action. To\nthe contrary, the Court spoke on this issue directly in\nRCA, stating that because the heightened standard of\nproof applied where the evidence before the court was\n“different” from that considered by the PTO, it applied\neven more clearly where the evidence was identical. 293\nU. S., at 8. Likewise, the Court’s statement that a “dubi\nous preponderance” will never suffice to sustain an inva\nlidity defense, ibid., admitted of no apparent exceptions.\nFinally, this Court often applied the heightened standard\nof proof without any mention of whether the relevant\nprior-art evidence had been before the PTO examiner, in\ncircumstances strongly suggesting it had not. See, e.g.,\nSmith, 301 U. S., at 227, 233.9\n   Nothing in §282’s text suggests that Congress meant to\n——————\n  9 Microsoft cites numerous court of appeals decisions as support for\nits claim that a preponderance standard must apply in the event that\nthe evidence in the infringement action varies from that considered by\nthe PTO. We see no hint of the hybrid standard of proof that Microsoft\nadvocates in these cases. Indeed, in some of these cases it appears that\nthe court even evaluated the evidence according to a heightened stan\ndard of proof. See Jacuzzi Bros., Inc. v. Berkeley Pump Co., 191 F. 2d\n632, 634 (CA9 1951) (“Although it is not expressly stated that th[e]\nconclusion [of invalidity] is based upon evidence establishing the thesis\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, the Trial Court expressed no doubt. And\nthe record shows that such conclusion was supported by substantial\nevidence”); Western Auto Supply Co. v. American-National Co., 114\nF. 2d 711, 713 (CA6 1940) (concluding that the patent was invalid\nwhere the court “entertain[ed] no doubt” on the question).\n16          MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ndepart from that understanding to enact a standard of\nproof that would rise and fall with the facts of each\ncase. Indeed, had Congress intended to drop the heightened\nstandard of proof where the evidence before the jury var\nied from that before the PTO—and thus to take the un\nusual and impractical step of enacting a variable standard\nof proof that must itself be adjudicated in each case, cf.\nSantosky v. Kramer, 455 U. S. 745, 757 (1982)10—we as\nsume it would have said so expressly.\n  To be sure, numerous courts of appeals in the years\npreceding the 1952 Act observed that the presumption of\nvalidity is “weakened” or “dissipated” in the circumstance\nthat the evidence in an infringement action was never\nconsidered by the PTO. See Jacuzzi Bros., Inc. v. Berkeley\nPump Co., 191 F. 2d 632, 634 (CA9 1951) (“largely dissi\npated”); H. Schindler & Co. v. C. Saladino & Sons, 81\nF. 2d 649, 651 (CA1 1936) (“weakened”); Gillette Safety\nRazor Co. v. Cliff Weil Cigar Co., 107 F. 2d 105, 107 (CA4\n1939) (“greatly weakened”); Butler Mfg. Co. v. Enterprise\nCleaning Co., 81 F. 2d 711, 716 (CA8 1936) (“weakened”).\nBut we cannot read these cases to hold or even to suggest\nthat a preponderance standard would apply in such cir\n——————\n   10 Not the least of the impracticalities of such an approach arises from\n\nthe fact that whether a PTO examiner considered a particular reference\nwill often be a question without a clear answer. In granting a patent,\nan examiner is under no duty to cite every reference he considers. 1\nDept. of Commerce, PTO, Manual of Patent Examining Procedure\n§904.03, p. 900–51 (8th rev. ed. 2010) (“The examiner is not called upon\nto cite all references that may be available, but only the ‘best.’ Multiply\ning references, any one of which is as good as, but no better than, the\nothers, adds to the burden and cost of prosecution and should therefore\nbe avoided” (emphasis deleted)); Manual of Patent Examining Proce\ndure §904.02, p. 129 (1st rev. ed. 1952) (same), http://www.uspto.gov/\nweb/offices/pac/mpep/old/E1R3_900.pdf (all Internet materials as\nvisited June 6, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file); see also\nBrief for Respondents 45–46 (describing additional impracticalities).\nWe see no indication in §282 that Congress meant to require collateral\nlitigation on such an inherently uncertain question.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Instead, we understand these cases to reflect\nthe same commonsense principle that the Federal Circuit\nhas recognized throughout its existence—namely, that\nnew evidence supporting an invalidity defense may “carry\nmore weight” in an infringement action than evidence\npreviously considered by the PTO, American Hoist, 725\nF. 2d, at 1360. \tAs Judge Rich explained:\n    “When new evidence touching validity of the patent\n    not considered by the PTO is relied on, the tribunal\n    considering it is not faced with having to disagree\n    with the PTO or with deferring to its judgment or\n    with taking its expertise into account. The evidence\n    may, therefore, carry more weight and go further to\n    ward sustaining the attacker’s unchanging burden.”\n    Ibid. (emphasis deleted)\nSee also SIBIA Neurosciences, Inc. v. Cadus Pharmaceuti\ncal Corp., 225 F. 3d 1349, 1355–1356 (CA Fed. 2000)\n(“[T]he alleged infringer’s burden may be more easily car\nried because of th[e] additional [evidence]”); Group One,\nLtd. v. Hallmark Cards, Inc., 407 F. 3d 1297, 1306 (CA\nFed. 2005) (similar).\n   Simply put, if the PTO did not have all material facts\nbefore it, its considered judgment may lose significant\nforce. Cf. KSR, 550 U. S., at 427. And, concomitantly, the\nchallenger’s burden to persuade the jury of its invalidity\ndefense by clear and convincing evidence may be easier to\nsustain. In this respect, although we have no occasion to\nendorse any particular formulation, we note that a jury\ninstruction on the effect of new evidence can, and when\nrequested, most often should be given. When warranted,\nthe jury may be instructed to consider that it has heard\nevidence that the PTO had no opportunity to evaluate\nbefore granting the patent. When it is disputed whether\nthe evidence presented to the jury differs from that evalu\n18       MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD. PARTNERSHIP\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nated by the PTO, the jury may be instructed to consider\nthat question. In either case, the jury may be instructed\nto evaluate whether the evidence before it is materially\nnew, and if so, to consider that fact when determining\nwhether an invalidity defense has been proved by clear\nand convincing evidence. Cf., e.g., Mendenhall v. Cedarap\nids, Inc., 5 F. 3d 1557, 1563–1564 (CA Fed. 1993); see\nalso Brief for International Business Machines Corp. as\nAmicus Curiae 31–37. Although Microsoft emphasized in\nits argument to the jury that S4 was never considered by\nthe PTO, it failed to request an instruction along these\nlines from the District Court. Now, in its reply brief in\nthis Court, Microsoft insists that an instruction of this\nkind was warranted. Reply Brief for Petitioner 22–23.\nThat argument, however, comes far too late, and we there\nfore refuse to consider it. See Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v.\nJackson, 561 U. S. ___ , ___ (2010) (slip op., at 12); cf. Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 51(d)(1)(B).\n                              III\n   The parties and their amici have presented opposing\nviews as to the wisdom of the clear-and-convincing\nevidence standard that Congress adopted. Microsoft and\nits amici contend that the heightened standard of proof\ndampens innovation by unduly insulating “bad” patents\nfrom invalidity challenges. They point to the high invali\ndation rate as evidence that the PTO grants patent protec\ntion to too many undeserving “inventions.” They claim\nthat inter partes reexamination proceedings before the\nPTO cannot fix the problem, as some grounds for invalida\ntion (like the on-sale bar at issue here) cannot be raised in\nsuch proceedings. They question the deference that the\nPTO’s expert determinations warrant, in light of the\nagency’s resources and procedures, which they deem in\nadequate. And, they insist that the heightened standard\nof proof essentially causes juries to abdicate their role in\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreviewing invalidity claims raised in infringement actions.\n   For their part, i4i and its amici, including the United\nStates, contend that the heightened standard of proof\nproperly limits the circumstances in which a lay jury\noverturns the considered judgment of an expert agency.\nThey claim that the heightened standard of proof is an\nessential component of the patent “bargain,” see Bonito\nBoats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141,\n150–151 (1989), and the incentives for inventors to dis\nclose their innovations to the public in exchange for patent\nprotection. They disagree with the notion that the patent\nissuance rate is above the optimal level. They explain that\nlimits on the reexamination process reflect a judgment by\nCongress as to the appropriate degree of interference with\npatentees’ reliance interests. Finally, they maintain that\njuries that are properly instructed as to the application of\nthe clear-and-convincing-evidence standard can, and often\ndo, find an invalidity defense established.\n   We find ourselves in no position to judge the compara\ntive force of these policy arguments. For nearly 30 years,\nthe Federal Circuit has interpreted §282 as we do today.\nDuring this period, Congress has often amended §282, see,\ne.g., Pub. L. 104–141, §2, 109 Stat. 352; Pub. L. 98–417,\n§203, 98 Stat. 1603; not once, so far as we (and Microsoft)\nare aware, has it even considered a proposal to lower the\nstandard of proof, see Tr. Oral Arg. 10. Moreover, Con\ngress has amended the patent laws to account for concerns\nabout “bad” patents, including by expanding the reexami\nnation process to provide for inter partes proceedings. See\nOptional Inter Partes Reexamination Procedure Act of\n1999, 113 Stat. 1501A–567, codified at 35 U. S. C. §311 et\nseq. Through it all, the evidentiary standard adopted in\n§282 has gone untouched. Indeed, Congress has left the\nFederal Circuit’s interpretation of §282 in place despite\nongoing criticism, both from within the Federal Govern\n20          MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD.

I write separately be\ncause, given the technical but important nature of the\ninvalidity question, I believe it worth emphasizing that in\nthis area of law as in others the evidentiary standard of\nproof applies to questions of fact and not to questions of\nlaw. See, e.g., Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 423\n(1979). Thus a factfinder must use the “clear and convinc\ning” standard where there are disputes about, say, when a\nproduct was first sold or whether a prior art reference had\nbeen published.\n   Many claims of invalidity rest, however, not upon fac\ntual disputes, but upon how the law applies to facts as\ngiven. Do the given facts show that the product was pre\nviously “in public use”? 35 U. S. C. §102(b). Do they show\nthat the invention was “nove[l]” and that it was “non\nobvious”? §§102, 103. Do they show that the patent ap\nplicant described his claims properly? §112. Where the\nultimate question of patent validity turns on the correct\nanswer to legal questions—what these subsidiary legal\nstandards mean or how they apply to the facts as given—\ntoday’s strict standard of proof has no application. See,\ne.g., Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383 U. S. 1,\n17 (1966); Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co. v. Chemque, Inc.,\n2        MICROSOFT CORP. v. i4i LTD.

S. 370 (1996).\n   Courts can help to keep the application of today’s “clear\nand convincing” standard within its proper legal bounds\nby separating factual and legal aspects of an invalidity\nclaim, say, by using instructions based on case-specific\ncircumstances that help the jury make the distinction or\nby using interrogatories and special verdicts to make clear\nwhich specific factual findings underlie the jury’s conclu\nsions. See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 49 and 51. By isolating\nthe facts (determined with help of the “clear and convinc\ning” standard), courts can thereby assure the proper in\nterpretation or application of the correct legal standard\n(without use of the “clear and convincing” standard). By\npreventing the “clear and convincing” standard from roam\ning outside its fact-related reservation, courts can increase\nthe likelihood that discoveries or inventions will not re\nceive legal protection where none is due.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

S. C. §282; see\nante, at 7. “[W]here Congress borrows terms of art,” this\nCourt presumes that Congress “knows and adopts the\ncluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word\n. . . and the meaning its use will convey to the judicial\nmind.” Morissette v. United States, 342 U. S. 246, 263\n(1952). But I do not think that the words “[a] patent shall\nbe presumed valid” so clearly conveyed a particular stan\ndard of proof to the judicial mind in 1952 as to constitute\na term of art. See, e.g., ante, at 12, n. 7 (“[S]ome lower\ncourts doubted [the presumption’s] wisdom or even pre\ntended it did not exist”); Philip A. Hunt Co. v. Mallinck\nrodt Chemical Works, 72 F.

Therefore, I would not\nconclude that Congress’ use of that phrase codified a stan\ndard of proof.\n  Nevertheless, I reach the same outcome as the Court.\nBecause §282 is silent as to the standard of proof, it did\nnot alter the common-law rule. See ante, at 6 (“[§282]\nincludes no express articulation of the standard of proof”).\nFor that reason, I agree with the Court that the height\nened standard of proof set forth in Radio Corp. of Amer-\nica v.
