Argued March 30, 2011—Decided June 9, 2011*\nThe Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires incumbent local ex\n  change carriers (LECs)—i.e., providers of local telephone service—to\n  share their physical networks with competitive LECs at cost-based\n  rates in two ways relevant here. First, 47 U. S. C. §251(c)(3) requires\n  an incumbent LEC to lease “on an unbundled basis”—i.e., a la carte—\n  network elements specified by the Federal Communications Commis\n  sion (FCC) to allow a competitor to create its own network without\n  having to build every element from scratch. In identifying those ele\n  ments, the FCC must consider whether access is “necessary” and\n  whether failing to provide it would “impair” the competitor’s provi\n  sion of service. §251(d)(2). Second, §251(c)(2) mandates that incum\n  bent LECs “provide . . . interconnection” between their networks and\n  competitive LECs’ to ensure that a competitor’s customers can call\n  the incumbent’s customers, and vice versa. The interconnection duty\n  is independent of the unbundling rules and not subject to impairment\n  analysis.\n     In 2003, the FCC issued its Triennial Review Order deciding, con\n  trary to previous orders, that §251(c)(3) did not require an incumbent\n  LEC to provide a competitive LEC with cost-based unbundled access\n  to existing “entrance facilities”—i.e., transmission facilities (typically\n  wires or cables) that connect the two LECs’ networks—because such\n  facilities are not network elements at all. The FCC noted, however,\n  that entrance facilities are used for both interconnection and back\n  hauling, and it emphasized that its order did not alter incumbent\n——————\n  * Together with No. 10–329, Isiogu et al. v. Michigan Bell Telephone\nCo. dba AT&T Michigan, also on certiorari to the same court.\n2              TALK AMERICA, INC. v. MICHIGAN BELL \n\n                        TELEPHONE CO.                                    \n\n                            Syllabus \n\n\n    LECs’ §251(c)(2) obligation to provide for interconnection. Thus, the\n    practical effect of the order was only that incumbent LECs were not\n    obligated to unbundle entrance facilities for backhauling purposes.\n       In 2005, following D. C. Circuit review, the FCC issued its Trien\n    nial Review Remand Order. The FCC retreated from the view that\n    entrance facilities are not network elements, but adhered to its pre\n    vious position that cost-based unbundled access to such facilities\n    need not be provided under §251(c)(3). Treating entrance facilities as\n    network elements, the FCC concluded that competitive LECs are not\n    impaired without access to such facilities. The FCC again empha\n    sized that competitive LECs’ §251(c)(2) right to obtain interconnec\n    tion had not been altered.\n       In the Remand Order’s wake, respondent AT&T notified competi\n    tive LECs that it would no longer provide entrance facilities at cost\n    based rates for either backhauling or interconnection, but would in\n    stead charge higher rates. Competitive LECs complained to the\n    Michigan Public Service Commission that AT&T was unlawfully ab\n    rogating their §251(c)(2) right to cost-based interconnection. The\n    Michigan Public Service Commission agreed and ordered AT&T to\n    continue providing entrance facilities for interconnection at cost\n    based rates. AT&T challenged the ruling. Relying on the Remand\n    Order, the Federal District Court ruled in AT&T’s favor. The Sixth\n    Circuit affirmed, declining to defer to the FCC’s argument that the\n    order did not change incumbent LECs’ interconnection obligations,\n    including the obligation to lease entrance facilities for interconnec\n    tion.\nHeld: The FCC has advanced a reasonable interpretation of its regula\n tions—i.e., that to satisfy its duty under §251(c)(2), an incumbent\n LEC must make its existing entrance facilities available to competi\n tors at cost-based rates if the facilities are to be used for interconnec\n tion—and this Court defers to the FCC’s views. Pp. 6–16.\n    (a) No statute or regulation squarely addresses the question. Pp.\n 6–7.\n    (b) Absent an unambiguous statute or regulation, the Court turns\n to the FCC’s interpretation of its regulations in its amicus brief. See,\n e.g., Chase Bank USA, N. A. v. McCoy, 562 U. S. ___, ___. The FCC\n proffers a three-step argument why its regulations require AT&T to\n provide access at cost-based rates to existing entrance facilities for\n interconnection purposes. Pp. 7–10.\n      (1) Interpreting 47 CFR §51.321(a), the FCC first contends that\n an incumbent LEC must lease “technically feasible” facilities for in\n terconnection. Pp. 8–9.\n      (2) The FCC contends, second, that existing entrance facilities\n are part of an incumbent LEC’s network, 47 CFR §51.319(e), and\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  therefore are among the facilities that an incumbent LEC must lease\n  for interconnection, if technically feasible. P. 9.\n       (3) Third, says the FCC, it is technically feasible to provide ac\n  cess to the particular entrance facilities at issue in these cases—a\n  point AT&T does not dispute. P. 10.\n    (c) Contrary to AT&T’s arguments, the FCC’s interpretation is not\n  “plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation[s]. ” Auer v.\n  Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461. First, it is perfectly sensible to read the\n  FCC’s regulations to include entrance facilities as part of incumbent\n  LECs’ networks. Second, the FCC’s views do not conflict with 47\n  CFR §51.5’s definition of interconnection as “the linking of two net\n  works for the mutual exchange of traffic[, but not] the transport and\n  termination of traffic.” Pp. 10–12.\n    (d) Nor is there any other “reason to suspect that the [FCC’s] in\n  terpretation does not reflect the agency’s fair and considered judg\n  ment on the matter in question.” Auer, supra, at 462. AT&T incor\n  rectly suggests that the FCC is attempting to require under\n  §251(c)(2) what courts have prevented it from requiring under\n  §251(c)(3) and what the FCC itself said was not required in the Re\n  mand Order.

We defer to\nthe Commission’s views and reverse the judgment below.\n                              I\n  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act), 110\nStat. 56, imposed a number of duties on incumbent pro­\nviders of local telephone service in order to facilitate mar­\nket entry by competitors. AT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utilities\nBd., 525 U. S. 366, 371 (1999). The incumbent local ex­\nchange carriers (LECs) owned the local exchange net­\nworks: the physical equipment necessary to receive, prop­\nerly route, and deliver phone calls among customers.\nVerizon Communications Inc. v. FCC, 535 U. S. 467, 490\n(2002). Before the 1996 Act, a new, competitive LEC could\nnot compete with an incumbent carrier without basically\nreplicating the incumbent’s entire existing network. Ibid.\n  The 1996 Act addressed that barrier to market entry by\nrequiring incumbent LECs to share their networks with\ncompetitive LECs in several ways, two of which are rele­\nvant here. First, 47 U. S. C. §251(c)(3) requires incumbent\nLECs to lease “on an unbundled basis”—i.e., a la carte—\nnetwork elements specified by the Commission. This\nmakes it easier for a competitor to create its own network\nwithout having to build every element from scratch. In\nidentifying which network elements must be available\nfor unbundled lease under §251(c)(3), the Commission\nis required to consider whether access is “necessary”\nand whether failing to provide access would “impair” a\ncompetitor’s provision of service. §251(d)(2). Second,\n§251(c)(2) mandates that incumbent LECs “provide . . .\ninterconnection” between their networks and competitive\nLECs’ facilities. This ensures that customers on a com­\npetitor’s network can call customers on the incumbent’s\nnetwork, and vice versa. The interconnection duty is\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nindependent of the unbundling rules and not subject to\nimpairment analysis. It is undisputed that both un­\nbundled network elements and interconnection must be\nprovided at cost-based rates. See §252(d)(1); Brief for\nPetitioner in No. 10–313, p. 28; Brief for Petitioners in No.\n10–329, p. 7; Brief for Respondent 4.\n  These cases concern incumbent LECs’ obligation to\nshare existing “entrance facilities” with competitive LECs.\nEntrance facilities are the transmission facilities (typically\nwires or cables) that connect competitive LECs’ networks\nwith incumbent LECs’ networks.           The FCC recently\nadopted a regulation specifying that entrance facilities are\nnot among the network elements that §251(c)(3) requires\nincumbents to lease to competitors on an unbundled basis\nat cost-based rates. See 47 CFR §51.319(e)(2)(i) (2005).\nThe Commission noted, however, that it “d[id] not alter\nthe right of competitive LECs to obtain interconnection\nfacilities pursuant to section 251(c)(2).” In re Unbundled\nAccess to Network Elements, 20 FCC Rcd. 2533, 2611, ¶140\n(2005) (Triennial Review Remand Order).\n  The specific issue here is whether respondent, Michigan\nBell Telephone Company d/b/a AT&T Michigan (AT&T),\nmust lease existing entrance facilities to competitive LECs\nat cost-based rates. The FCC interprets its regulations to\nrequire AT&T to do so for the purpose of interconnection.\nWe begin by reviewing the Commission’s recent actions\nregarding entrance facilities and then explain the particu­\nlar dispute that is before us today.\n                            A\n  In 2003, the FCC decided, contrary to its previous or­\nders, that incumbent LECs were not obligated to provide\ncost-based unbundled access to entrance facilities under\n§251(c)(3). In re Review of Section 251 Unbundling Obli\ngations of Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers, 18 FCC\nRcd. 16978, 17202–17205, ¶¶365–367 (2003) (Triennial\n4            TALK AMERICA, INC. v. MICHIGAN BELL \n\n                      TELEPHONE CO.                                      \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nReview Order). Explaining that its previous approach had\nbeen “misguided” and “overly broad,” id., ¶¶366, 365, the\nCommission concluded that entrance facilities were not\nsubject to the unbundling requirement because they are\nnot network elements at all. See id., ¶366 (entrance facili­\nties “exist outside the incumbent LEC’s local network”).\nThe Commission therefore did not conduct an impairment\nanalysis.\n   The FCC emphasized, however, the limits of this ruling.\nEntrance facilities are used for two purposes: interconnec­\ntion and backhauling.2 It expressly “d[id] not alter” an\nincumbent LEC’s obligation under §251(c)(2) to provide\n“facilities in order to ‘interconnect with the incumbent\nLEC’s network.’ ” Id., ¶366 (brackets omitted). Thus, al­\nthough the Commission specified that §251(c)(3) did not\nrequire any unbundled leasing of entrance facilities, it\ndetermined in practical effect only that “incumbent LECs\n[were not obligated] to unbundle [entrance facilities] for\nthe purpose of backhauling traffic.” Id., ¶365.\n   On direct review, the D. C. Circuit questioned the Com­\nmission’s determination that entrance facilities are not\nnetwork elements under §251(c)(3), but found the agency\nrulemaking record insufficient and remanded to the\nCommission for further consideration. See United States\nTelecom Assn. v. FCC, 359 F. 3d 554, 586, cert. denied, 543\nU. S. 925 (2004). The court noted that if entrance facilities\nwere in fact “ ‘network elements,’ ” then “an analysis of\n——————\n  2 Although the parties and their amici disagree over the precise defi­\n\nnition of backhauling, they all appear to agree that backhauling is\nimportant to competitive LECs and occurs when a competitive LEC\nuses an entrance facility to transport traffic from a leased portion of an\nincumbent network to the competitor’s own facilities. Backhauling does\nnot involve the exchange of traffic between incumbent and competitive\nnetworks. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioners in No. 10–329, p. 25; Brief for\nUnited States Telecom Association et al. as Amici Curiae 32.

See Triennial\nReview Remand Order ¶¶136–141. The Commission re­\ntreated from its view that entrance facilities are not net­\nwork elements but adhered to its previous position that\ncost-based unbundled access to them need not be provided\nunder §251(c)(3). Id., ¶¶137–138. Treating entrance\nfacilities as network elements, the Commission concluded\nthat competitive LECs are not impaired without access to\nthem. Ibid. The Commission again emphasized that it\n“d[id] not alter the right of competitive LECs to obtain\ninterconnection facilities pursuant to section 251(c)(2).”\nId., ¶140.\n                             B\n   In the wake of the Triennial Review Remand Order,\nAT&T notified competitive LECs that it would no longer\nprovide entrance facilities at cost-based rates for either\nbackhauling or interconnection, but would instead charge\nhigher rates. Competitive LECs complained to the Michi­\ngan Public Service Commission (PSC) that AT&T was\nunlawfully abrogating their right to cost-based intercon­\nnection under §251(c)(2). The Michigan PSC agreed with\nthe competitive LECs and ordered AT&T to continue\nproviding entrance facilities for interconnection at cost­\nbased rates.\n   AT&T challenged the Michigan PSC’s ruling in the\nDistrict Court, which, relying on the Triennial Review\nRemand Order, ruled in AT&T’s favor.

Nor does any regulation do so. See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 22, n. 6.\n  AT&T contends that the statute makes clear that an\nincumbent LEC need not provide access to any facilities—\nmuch less entrance facilities—to provide interconnection.\nThe company points out that §251(c)(2) does not mention\nincumbent LECs’ facilities, but rather mandates only that\nincumbent LECs provide interconnection “for the facilities\nand equipment of any [competing] carrier.” In contrast,\nAT&T notes, §251(c)(3) requires that incumbent LECs\nprovide unbundled “access to [their] network elements.”\n  We do not find the statute so clear. Although §251(c)(2)\ndoes not expressly require that incumbent LECs lease\nfacilities to provide interconnection, it also does not ex­\npressly excuse them from doing so. The statute says\nnothing about what an incumbent LEC must do to “pro­\nvide . . . interconnection.” §251(c)(2). “[T]he facilities and\nequipment of any [competing] carrier” identifies the\nequipment that an incumbent LEC must allow to inter­\nconnect, but it does not specify what the incumbent LEC\nmust do to make the interconnection possible.

Second, entrance facili-\nties are among the facilities that an incumbent must\nmake available for interconnection, if technically feasible.\nThird, it is technically feasible to provide access to the\nparticular entrance facilities at issue in these cases.\n                             1\n   The Commission first contends that an incumbent LEC\nmust lease, at cost-based rates, any requested facilities\nfor obtaining interconnection with the incumbent LEC’s\nnetwork, unless it is technically infeasible to do so. Sec­\ntion 251(c)(2) mandates that an incumbent LEC provide\ninterconnection, at cost-based rates, “at any technically\nfeasible point within the carrier’s network.” The FCC\nhas long construed §251(c)(2) to require incumbent LECs\nto provide, at cost-based rates, “any technically feasible\nmethod of obtaining interconnection . . . at a particular\npoint.” 47 CFR §51.321(a) (2010).\n   The requirement in §51.321(a) to provide a “method of\nobtaining interconnection,” the Commission argues, en­\ncompasses a duty to lease an existing facility to a compet­\ning LEC. When the Commission originally promulgated\n§51.321(a), it explained that incumbent LECs would be\nrequired to “adapt their facilities to interconnection” and\nto “accept the novel use of, and modification to, [their]\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Since then, as AT&T and its amici concede, in­\ncumbent LECs have commonly leased certain facilities at\ncost-based prices to accommodate interconnection. See\nBrief for Respondent 28–29; Brief for United States Tele­\ncom Association et al. as Amici Curiae 33–35.\n   As additional support for its assertion that incumbent\nLECs are obligated to lease facilities, the FCC highlights\nthe examples in §51.321(b) of “[t]echnically feasible meth­\nods of obtaining interconnection,” which include “[m]eet\npoint interconnection arrangements.” In a meet-point\narrangement, an incumbent LEC “accommodat[es]” inter­\nconnection by building a transmission facility from its\nnetwork to a designated point, where it connects with the\ncompetitor’s corresponding transmission facility. Local\nCompetition Order ¶553. Compared to that requirement,\nthe Commission argues, the obligation to lease existing\nfacilities for interconnection is quite modest.\n\n                               2\n   Next, the Commission contends that existing entrance\nfacilities are among the facilities that an incumbent LEC\nmust lease for interconnection. According to the FCC, the\nTriennial Review Remand Order adopted a regulatory def­\ninition that reestablished that entrance facilities are\npart of an incumbent LEC’s network. See ¶137; see also\n47 CFR §51.319(e) (2005). The end of every entrance\nfacility is therefore a “point within [an incumbent] car­\nrier’s network” at which a competing LEC could request\ninterconnection, 47 U. S. C. §251(c)(2), and each entrance\nfacility potentially provides a “technically feasible method\nof obtaining interconnection,” 47 CFR §51.321(a) (2010).\n10           TALK AMERICA, INC. v.

Under the Commission’s regulations,\nan incumbent LEC bears the burden of showing that a\nrequested method or point of interconnection is technically\ninfeasible. See 47 CFR §§51.305(e), 51.321(d); see also\n§§51.305(d), 51.321(c) (previously successful intercon­\nnection is “substantial evidence” of technical feasibility).\nAT&T does not dispute technical feasibility here.4\n                             C\n   The FCC’s interpretation is not “plainly erroneous or\ninconsistent with the regulation[s]. ” Auer, supra, at 461\n(internal quotation marks omitted). First, we disagree\nwith AT&T’s argument that entrance facilities are not a\npart of incumbent LECs’ networks. Indeed, the Commis­\nsion’s view on this question is more than reasonable; it is\ncertainly not plainly erroneous. The Triennial Review\nRemand Order responded to the D. C. Circuit’s decision\nquestioning the Commission’s earlier finding that en­\ntrance facilities are not network elements.

The Com­\nmission suggests here, as it has before, that additional considerations of\ncost or reasonableness might be appropriate if a competitive LEC were\nto request that an incumbent LEC build new entrance facilities for\ninterconnection. Ibid.

Triennial Review\nRemand Order ¶¶136–137; see 47 CFR §51.319(e)(1)\n(defining dedicated transport to include “incumbent LEC\ntransmission facilities . . . between wire centers or\nswitches owned by incumbent LECs and switches owned\nby [competing] carriers”). Given that revised definition, it\nis perfectly sensible to conclude that entrance facilities are\na part of incumbent LECs’ networks.\n   Second, we are not persuaded by AT&T’s argument that\nthe Commission’s views conflict with the definition of\ninterconnection in §51.5. That regulation provides: “Inter­\nconnection is the linking of two networks for the mutual\nexchange of traffic. This term does not include the trans­\nport and termination of traffic.” AT&T focuses on the\ndefinition’s exclusion of “transport and termination of\ntraffic.” An entrance facility is a transport facility, AT&T\nargues, and it makes no sense to require an incumbent\nLEC to furnish a transport facility for interconnection\nwhen the definition of interconnection expressly excludes\ntransport.\n   We think AT&T reads too much into the exclusion of\n“transport.” The regulation cannot possibly mean that no\ntransport can occur across an interconnection facility, as\nthat would directly conflict with the statutory language.\nSee §251(c)(2) (requiring “interconnection . . . for the\ntransmission and routing of [local] telephone exchange\nservice”). The very reason for interconnection is the “mu­\ntual exchange of traffic.” 47 CFR §51.5; see also Competi\ntive Telecommunications Assn. v. FCC, 117 F. 3d 1068,\n1071–1072 (CA8 1997) (“[T]he transmission and routing of\ntelephone exchange service” is “what the interconnection,\nthe physical link, would be used for” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n   The better reading of the regulation is that it merely\nreflects that the “transport and termination of traffic” is\nsubject to different regulatory treatment than intercon­\n12           TALK AMERICA, INC. v. MICHIGAN BELL \n\n                      TELEPHONE CO.                                       \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nnection.

See 47 U. S. C.\n§§251(b)(5), 252(d)(2); 47 CFR §51.701. The Commission\nexplains that a competitive LEC typically pays one fee for\ninterconnection—“just for having the link”—and then an\nadditional fee for the transport and termination of tele­\nphone calls. Tr. of Oral Arg. 28; see also Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 3, n. 1. Entrance facilities, at\nleast when used for the mutual exchange of traffic, seem\nto us to fall comfortably within the definition of intercon­\nnection. See 597 F. 3d, at 388 (Sutton, J., dissenting)\n(noting that entrance facilities are “designed for the very\npurpose of linking two carriers’ networks” (internal quota­\ntion marks omitted)).\n   In sum, the Commission’s interpretation of its regula­\ntions is neither plainly erroneous nor inconsistent with the\nregulatory text. Contrary to AT&T’s assertion, there is no\ndanger that deferring to the Commission would effectively\n“permit the agency, under the guise of interpreting a\nregulation, to create de facto a new regulation.”5 Christen\nsen v.

By its own terms, that list\nis nonexhaustive. See §51.321(b) (“[t]echnically feasible methods of\nobtaining interconnection . . . include, but are not limited to” the listed\nexamples); see also §51.321(a) (“[A]n incumbent LEC shall provide . . .\nany technically feasible method of obtaining interconnection” (emphasis\nadded)).\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

See ibid.; see also Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.\nUnited States, 371 U. S. 156, 168–169 (1962) (“The courts\nmay not accept appellate counsel’s post hoc rationaliza­\ntions for agency action; [SEC v.] Chenery[ Corp., 332 U. S.\n194 (1947),] requires that an agency’s discretionary order\nbe upheld, if at all, on the same basis articulated in the\norder by the agency itself”). And although the FCC con­\ncedes that it is advancing a novel interpretation of its\nlongstanding interconnection regulations, novelty alone\nis not a reason to refuse deference. The Commission ex­\nplains that the issue in these cases did not arise until\nrecently—when it initially eliminated unbundled access to\nentrance facilities in the Triennial Review Order. Until\nthen, the Commission says, a competitive LEC typically\nwould elect to lease a cost-priced entrance facility under\n§251(c)(3) since entrance facilities leased under §251(c)(3)\ncould be used for any purpose—i.e., both interconnection\nand backhauling—but entrance facilities leased under\n§251(c)(2) can be used only for interconnection. We see no\nreason to doubt this explanation.\n   AT&T suggests that the Commission is attempting to\nrequire under §251(c)(2) what courts have prevented it\nfrom requiring under §251(c)(3) and what the Commission\nitself said was not required in the Triennial Review Re\nmand Order. Tr. of Oral Arg. 50 (“[T]his is a rear guard\neffort to preserve [cost-based] pricing for things that the\n[C]ommission has said should no longer be available . . . at\n[such] pricing”). We do not think that AT&T is correct.\n                               1\n  To begin with, AT&T’s accusation does not square with\nthe regulatory history. The Commission was not com­\npelled to eliminate the obligation to lease unbundled\nentrance facilities at cost-based rates.\n  It is true that, prior to the Triennial Review orders, the\n14         TALK AMERICA, INC. v. MICHIGAN BELL \n\n                    TELEPHONE CO.                          \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nCommission twice unsuccessfully attempted to impose\nsweeping unbundling requirements on incumbent LECs.\nSee Local Competition Order ¶278; In re Implementation\nof Local Competition Provisions of the Telecommunications\nAct of 1996, 15 FCC Rcd. 3696, 3771–3904, ¶¶162–464\n(1999); see also 47 CFR §51.319 (1997); §51.319 (2000).\nEach time, the Commission’s efforts were rejected for\ntaking an unreasonably broad view of “impair[ment]”\nunder §251(d)(2). See Iowa Utilities Bd., 525 U. S., at 392;\nUnited States Telecom Assn. v. FCC, 290 F. 3d 415, 421–\n428 (2002), cert. denied, 538 U. S. 940 (2003). In the\nTriennial Review Order, the Commission once again rein­\nterpreted the “impair” standard and revised the list of\nnetwork elements that incumbents must provide unbun­\ndled to competitors.\n   The Commission’s initial decision to eliminate the obli­\ngation to unbundle entrance facilities, however, was not\na result of the narrower view of impairment mandated\nby this Court and the D. C. Circuit. Instead, the Commis­\nsion determined that entrance facilities need not be pro­\nvided on an unbundled basis under §251(c)(3) on the novel\nground that they are not network elements at all—\nsomething no court had ever suggested.\n   Moreover, since its initial decision to eliminate the\nunbundling obligation for entrance facilities, the Commis­\nsion has been committed to that position. When the D. C.\nCircuit questioned the Commission’s finding that entrance\nfacilities are not network elements, the Commission re­\nsponded by observing that the court “did not reject our\nconclusion that incumbent LECs need not unbundle en­\ntrance facilities, only the analysis through which we\nreached that conclusion.” Triennial Review Remand Order\n¶137. The Commission then found another way to support\nthat same conclusion.\n                    Cite as: 564 U.

The\nTriennial Review orders eliminated incumbent LECs’ obli­\ngation under §251(c)(3) to provide unbundled access to\nentrance facilities. But the FCC emphasized in both\norders that it “d[id] not alter” the obligation on incumbent\nLECs under §251(c)(2) to provide facilities for interconnec­\ntion purposes. Triennial Review Order ¶366; Triennial\nReview Remand Order ¶140. Because entrance facilities\nare used for backhauling and interconnection purposes,\nthe FCC effectively eliminated only unbundled access to\nentrance facilities for backhauling purposes—a nuance it\nexpressly noted in the first Triennial Review order. Tri\nennial Review Order ¶365. That distinction is neither\nunusual nor ambiguous.6 In these cases, the Commission\nis simply explaining the interconnection obligation that it\nleft undisturbed in the Triennial Review orders. We see\nno conflict between the Triennial Review orders and the\nCommission’s views expressed here.7\n   We are not concerned that the Triennial Review Re\nmand Order did not expressly distinguish between back­\n——————\n  6 The Commission has long recognized that a single facility can be\n\nused for different functions and that its regulatory treatment can vary\ndepending on its use. Unbundled network elements, for example, may\nnot be used for the exclusive provision of mobile wireless or long­\ndistance services. 47 CFR §51.309(b) (2010). Similarly, interconnection\narrangements may be used for local telephone service but not for long­\ndistance services. §51.305(b).\n  7 The parties and their amici dispute whether an incumbent LEC\n\nhas any way of knowing how a competitive LEC is using an entrance\nfacility. This technical factual dispute simply underscores the appro­\npriateness of deferring to the FCC. So long as the Commission is acting\nwithin the scope of its delegated authority and in accordance with\nprescribed procedures, it has greater expertise and stands in a better\nposition than this Court to make the technical and policy judgments\nnecessary to administer the complex regulatory program at issue here.\n16         TALK AMERICA, INC. v.

AT&T argues that the Commission’s holding\nin the Triennial Review Remand Order is broader than\nthat in the Triennial Review Order. In AT&T’s view, the\nCommission concluded in the Triennial Review Remand\nOrder that competitors are not impaired if they lack cost­\nbased access to entrance facilities for backhauling or\ninterconnection.\n  There are two flaws with AT&T’s reasoning. First, as\nwe have discussed, the Triennial Review Remand Order\nreinstated the ultimate conclusion of the Triennial Review\nOrder and changed only “the analysis through which [it]\nreached that conclusion.” Triennial Review Remand Order\n¶137. Second, unlike §251(c)(3)’s unbundling obligation,\n§251(c)(2)’s interconnection obligation does not require the\nCommission to consider impairment. As the dissent below\nobserved, it would be surprising indeed if the FCC had\ntaken the novel step of incorporating impairment into\ninterconnection without comment. 597 F. 3d, at 389 (opin­\nion of Sutton, J.).\n                         *     *    *\n  The FCC as amicus curiae has advanced a reasonable\ninterpretation of its regulations, and we defer to its views.\nThe judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Sixth Circuit is reversed.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of these cases.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

I would reach the same\nresult even without benefit of the rule that we will defer to\nan agency’s interpretation of its own regulations, a rule in\nrecent years attributed to our opinion in Auer v. Robbins,\n519 U. S. 452, 461 (1997), though it first appeared in our\njurisprudence more than half a century earlier, see Bowles\nv. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U. S. 410 (1945). In\nthis suit I have no need to rely on Auer deference, because\nI believe the FCC’s interpretation is the fairest reading of\nthe orders in question. Most cogently, ¶140 of the Trien\nnial Review Remand Order serves no purpose unless one\naccepts (as AT&T does not) the distinction between back­\nhauling and interconnection that is referred to in footnotes\nto ¶¶138 and 141 of the order. 20 FCC Rcd. 2533, 2610–\n2612 (2005). The order would have been clearer, to be\nsure, if the distinction had been made in a footnote to ¶140\n2          TALK AMERICA, INC. v. MICHIGAN BELL \n\n                    TELEPHONE CO.                           \n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring \n\n\nitself, but the distinction is there, and without it ¶140 has\nno point.\n   It is comforting to know that I would reach the Court’s\nresult even without Auer. For while I have in the past\nuncritically accepted that rule, I have become increasingly\ndoubtful of its validity. On the surface, it seems to be a\nnatural corollary—indeed, an a fortiori application—of the\nrule that we will defer to an agency’s interpretation of the\nstatute it is charged with implementing, see Chevron\nU. S. A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467\nU. S. 837 (1984). But it is not. When Congress enacts an\nimprecise statute that it commits to the implementation of\nan executive agency, it has no control over that implemen­\ntation (except, of course, through further, more precise,\nlegislation). The legislative and executive functions are\nnot combined. But when an agency promulgates an im­\nprecise rule, it leaves to itself the implementation of that\nrule, and thus the initial determination of the rule’s mean­\ning. And though the adoption of a rule is an exercise of\nthe executive rather than the legislative power, a properly\nadopted rule has fully the effect of law. It seems contrary\nto fundamental principles of separation of powers to per­\nmit the person who promulgates a law to interpret it as\nwell. “When the legislative and executive powers are\nunited in the same person, or in the same body of magis­\ntrates, there can be no liberty; because apprehensions may\narise, lest the same monarch or senate should enact ty­\nrannical laws, to execute them in a tyrannical manner.”\nMontesquieu, Spirit of the Laws bk. XI, ch. 6, pp. 151–152\n(O. Piest ed., T. Nugent transl. 1949).\n   Deferring to an agency’s interpretation of a statute does\nnot encourage Congress, out of a desire to expand its\npower, to enact vague statutes; the vagueness effectively\ncedes power to the Executive. By contrast, deferring to an\nagency’s interpretation of its own rule encourages the\nagency to enact vague rules which give it the power, in\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

This frustrates\nthe notice and predictability purposes of rulemaking, and\npromotes arbitrary government. The seeming inappro­\npriateness of Auer deference is especially evident in cases\nsuch as these, involving an agency that has repeatedly\nbeen rebuked in its attempts to expand the statute beyond\nits text, and has repeatedly sought new means to the same\nends.\n   There are undoubted advantages to Auer deference. It\nmakes the job of a reviewing court much easier, and since\nit usually produces affirmance of the agency’s view with­\nout conflict in the Circuits, it imparts (once the agency has\nspoken to clarify the regulation) certainty and predict­\nability to the administrative process.

Second, §251(c)(2) mandates that incum\n  bent LECs “provide . . . interconnection” between their networks and\n  competitive LECs’ to ensure that a competitor’s customers can call\n  the incumbent’s customers, and vice versa. The interconnection duty\n  is independent of the unbundling rules and not subject to impairment\n  analysis.\n     In 2003, the FCC issued its Triennial Review Order deciding, con\n  trary to previous orders, that §251(c)(3) did not require an incumbent\n  LEC to provide a competitive LEC with cost-based unbundled access\n  to existing “entrance facilities”—i.e., transmission facilities (typically\n  wires or cables) that connect the two LECs’ networks—because such\n  facilities are not network elements at all. The FCC noted, however,\n  that entrance facilities are used for both interconnection and back\n  hauling, and it emphasized that its order did not alter incumbent\n——————\n  * Together with No. 10–329, Isiogu et al. v.

MICHIGAN BELL \n\n                        TELEPHONE CO.                                    \n\n                            Syllabus \n\n\n    LECs’ §251(c)(2) obligation to provide for interconnection. Thus, the\n    practical effect of the order was only that incumbent LECs were not\n    obligated to unbundle entrance facilities for backhauling purposes.\n       In 2005, following D. C. Circuit review, the FCC issued its Trien\n    nial Review Remand Order. The FCC retreated from the view that\n    entrance facilities are not network elements, but adhered to its pre\n    vious position that cost-based unbundled access to such facilities\n    need not be provided under §251(c)(3). Treating entrance facilities as\n    network elements, the FCC concluded that competitive LECs are not\n    impaired without access to such facilities. The FCC again empha\n    sized that competitive LECs’ §251(c)(2) right to obtain interconnec\n    tion had not been altered.\n       In the Remand Order’s wake, respondent AT&T notified competi\n    tive LECs that it would no longer provide entrance facilities at cost\n    based rates for either backhauling or interconnection, but would in\n    stead charge higher rates. Competitive LECs complained to the\n    Michigan Public Service Commission that AT&T was unlawfully ab\n    rogating their §251(c)(2) right to cost-based interconnection. The\n    Michigan Public Service Commission agreed and ordered AT&T to\n    continue providing entrance facilities for interconnection at cost\n    based rates. AT&T challenged the ruling. Relying on the Remand\n    Order, the Federal District Court ruled in AT&T’s favor. The Sixth\n    Circuit affirmed, declining to defer to the FCC’s argument that the\n    order did not change incumbent LECs’ interconnection obligations,\n    including the obligation to lease entrance facilities for interconnec\n    tion.\nHeld: The FCC has advanced a reasonable interpretation of its regula\n tions—i.e., that to satisfy its duty under §251(c)(2), an incumbent\n LEC must make its existing entrance facilities available to competi\n tors at cost-based rates if the facilities are to be used for interconnec\n tion—and this Court defers to the FCC’s views. Pp. 6–16.\n    (a) No statute or regulation squarely addresses the question. Pp.\n 6–7.\n    (b) Absent an unambiguous statute or regulation, the Court turns\n to the FCC’s interpretation of its regulations in its amicus brief. See,\n e.g., Chase Bank USA, N. A. v.

The FCC\n proffers a three-step argument why its regulations require AT&T to\n provide access at cost-based rates to existing entrance facilities for\n interconnection purposes. Pp. 7–10.\n      (1) Interpreting 47 CFR §51.321(a), the FCC first contends that\n an incumbent LEC must lease “technically feasible” facilities for in\n terconnection.

P. 10.\n    (c) Contrary to AT&T’s arguments, the FCC’s interpretation is not\n  “plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation[s]. ” Auer v.\n  Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461. First, it is perfectly sensible to read the\n  FCC’s regulations to include entrance facilities as part of incumbent\n  LECs’ networks. Second, the FCC’s views do not conflict with 47\n  CFR §51.5’s definition of interconnection as “the linking of two net\n  works for the mutual exchange of traffic[, but not] the transport and\n  termination of traffic.” Pp. 10–12.\n    (d) Nor is there any other “reason to suspect that the [FCC’s] in\n  terpretation does not reflect the agency’s fair and considered judg\n  ment on the matter in question.” Auer, supra, at 462. AT&T incor\n  rectly suggests that the FCC is attempting to require under\n  §251(c)(2) what courts have prevented it from requiring under\n  §251(c)(3) and what the FCC itself said was not required in the Re\n  mand Order.

We defer to\nthe Commission’s views and reverse the judgment below.\n                              I\n  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act), 110\nStat. 56, imposed a number of duties on incumbent pro­\nviders of local telephone service in order to facilitate mar­\nket entry by competitors. AT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utilities\nBd., 525 U. S. 366, 371 (1999). The incumbent local ex­\nchange carriers (LECs) owned the local exchange net­\nworks: the physical equipment necessary to receive, prop­\nerly route, and deliver phone calls among customers.\nVerizon Communications Inc. v. FCC, 535 U. S. 467, 490\n(2002). Before the 1996 Act, a new, competitive LEC could\nnot compete with an incumbent carrier without basically\nreplicating the incumbent’s entire existing network. Ibid.\n  The 1996 Act addressed that barrier to market entry by\nrequiring incumbent LECs to share their networks with\ncompetitive LECs in several ways, two of which are rele­\nvant here. First, 47 U. S. C. §251(c)(3) requires incumbent\nLECs to lease “on an unbundled basis”—i.e., a la carte—\nnetwork elements specified by the Commission. This\nmakes it easier for a competitor to create its own network\nwithout having to build every element from scratch. In\nidentifying which network elements must be available\nfor unbundled lease under §251(c)(3), the Commission\nis required to consider whether access is “necessary”\nand whether failing to provide access would “impair” a\ncompetitor’s provision of service. §251(d)(2). Second,\n§251(c)(2) mandates that incumbent LECs “provide . . .\ninterconnection” between their networks and competitive\nLECs’ facilities. This ensures that customers on a com­\npetitor’s network can call customers on the incumbent’s\nnetwork, and vice versa. The interconnection duty is\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nindependent of the unbundling rules and not subject to\nimpairment analysis. It is undisputed that both un­\nbundled network elements and interconnection must be\nprovided at cost-based rates. See §252(d)(1); Brief for\nPetitioner in No. 10–313, p. 28; Brief for Petitioners in No.\n10–329, p. 7; Brief for Respondent 4.\n  These cases concern incumbent LECs’ obligation to\nshare existing “entrance facilities” with competitive LECs.\nEntrance facilities are the transmission facilities (typically\nwires or cables) that connect competitive LECs’ networks\nwith incumbent LECs’ networks.           The FCC recently\nadopted a regulation specifying that entrance facilities are\nnot among the network elements that §251(c)(3) requires\nincumbents to lease to competitors on an unbundled basis\nat cost-based rates. See 47 CFR §51.319(e)(2)(i) (2005).\nThe Commission noted, however, that it “d[id] not alter\nthe right of competitive LECs to obtain interconnection\nfacilities pursuant to section 251(c)(2).” In re Unbundled\nAccess to Network Elements, 20 FCC Rcd. 2533, 2611, ¶140\n(2005) (Triennial Review Remand Order).\n  The specific issue here is whether respondent, Michigan\nBell Telephone Company d/b/a AT&T Michigan (AT&T),\nmust lease existing entrance facilities to competitive LECs\nat cost-based rates. The FCC interprets its regulations to\nrequire AT&T to do so for the purpose of interconnection.\nWe begin by reviewing the Commission’s recent actions\nregarding entrance facilities and then explain the particu­\nlar dispute that is before us today.\n                            A\n  In 2003, the FCC decided, contrary to its previous or­\nders, that incumbent LECs were not obligated to provide\ncost-based unbundled access to entrance facilities under\n§251(c)(3). In re Review of Section 251 Unbundling Obli\ngations of Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers, 18 FCC\nRcd. 16978, 17202–17205, ¶¶365–367 (2003) (Triennial\n4            TALK AMERICA, INC. v. MICHIGAN BELL \n\n                      TELEPHONE CO.                                      \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nReview Order). Explaining that its previous approach had\nbeen “misguided” and “overly broad,” id., ¶¶366, 365, the\nCommission concluded that entrance facilities were not\nsubject to the unbundling requirement because they are\nnot network elements at all. See id., ¶366 (entrance facili­\nties “exist outside the incumbent LEC’s local network”).\nThe Commission therefore did not conduct an impairment\nanalysis.\n   The FCC emphasized, however, the limits of this ruling.\nEntrance facilities are used for two purposes: interconnec­\ntion and backhauling.2 It expressly “d[id] not alter” an\nincumbent LEC’s obligation under §251(c)(2) to provide\n“facilities in order to ‘interconnect with the incumbent\nLEC’s network.’ ” Id., ¶366 (brackets omitted). Thus, al­\nthough the Commission specified that §251(c)(3) did not\nrequire any unbundled leasing of entrance facilities, it\ndetermined in practical effect only that “incumbent LECs\n[were not obligated] to unbundle [entrance facilities] for\nthe purpose of backhauling traffic.” Id., ¶365.\n   On direct review, the D. C. Circuit questioned the Com­\nmission’s determination that entrance facilities are not\nnetwork elements under §251(c)(3), but found the agency\nrulemaking record insufficient and remanded to the\nCommission for further consideration. See United States\nTelecom Assn. v. FCC, 359 F. 3d 554, 586, cert. denied, 543\nU. S. 925 (2004). The court noted that if entrance facilities\nwere in fact “ ‘network elements,’ ” then “an analysis of\n——————\n  2 Although the parties and their amici disagree over the precise defi­\n\nnition of backhauling, they all appear to agree that backhauling is\nimportant to competitive LECs and occurs when a competitive LEC\nuses an entrance facility to transport traffic from a leased portion of an\nincumbent network to the competitor’s own facilities. Backhauling does\nnot involve the exchange of traffic between incumbent and competitive\nnetworks. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioners in No. 10–329, p. 25; Brief for\nUnited States Telecom Association et al. as Amici Curiae 32.

See Triennial\nReview Remand Order ¶¶136–141. The Commission re­\ntreated from its view that entrance facilities are not net­\nwork elements but adhered to its previous position that\ncost-based unbundled access to them need not be provided\nunder §251(c)(3). Id., ¶¶137–138. Treating entrance\nfacilities as network elements, the Commission concluded\nthat competitive LECs are not impaired without access to\nthem. Ibid. The Commission again emphasized that it\n“d[id] not alter the right of competitive LECs to obtain\ninterconnection facilities pursuant to section 251(c)(2).”\nId., ¶140.\n                             B\n   In the wake of the Triennial Review Remand Order,\nAT&T notified competitive LECs that it would no longer\nprovide entrance facilities at cost-based rates for either\nbackhauling or interconnection, but would instead charge\nhigher rates. Competitive LECs complained to the Michi­\ngan Public Service Commission (PSC) that AT&T was\nunlawfully abrogating their right to cost-based intercon­\nnection under §251(c)(2). The Michigan PSC agreed with\nthe competitive LECs and ordered AT&T to continue\nproviding entrance facilities for interconnection at cost­\nbased rates.\n   AT&T challenged the Michigan PSC’s ruling in the\nDistrict Court, which, relying on the Triennial Review\nRemand Order, ruled in AT&T’s favor.

Nor does any regulation do so. See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 22, n. 6.\n  AT&T contends that the statute makes clear that an\nincumbent LEC need not provide access to any facilities—\nmuch less entrance facilities—to provide interconnection.\nThe company points out that §251(c)(2) does not mention\nincumbent LECs’ facilities, but rather mandates only that\nincumbent LECs provide interconnection “for the facilities\nand equipment of any [competing] carrier.” In contrast,\nAT&T notes, §251(c)(3) requires that incumbent LECs\nprovide unbundled “access to [their] network elements.”\n  We do not find the statute so clear. Although §251(c)(2)\ndoes not expressly require that incumbent LECs lease\nfacilities to provide interconnection, it also does not ex­\npressly excuse them from doing so. The statute says\nnothing about what an incumbent LEC must do to “pro­\nvide . . . interconnection.” §251(c)(2). “[T]he facilities and\nequipment of any [competing] carrier” identifies the\nequipment that an incumbent LEC must allow to inter­\nconnect, but it does not specify what the incumbent LEC\nmust do to make the interconnection possible. Ibid.\n                             B\n   In the absence of any unambiguous statute or regula­\ntion, we turn to the FCC’s interpretation of its regulations\nin its amicus brief. See, e.g., Chase Bank USA, N. A. v.\nMcCoy, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12). As we\nreaffirmed earlier this Term, we defer to an agency’s\ninterpretation of its regulations, even in a legal brief,\n8          TALK AMERICA, INC. v.

Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461, 462 (1997)).\n   The Commission contends that its regulations require\nAT&T to provide access at cost-based rates to its exist­\ning entrance facilities for the purpose of interconnection.\nThe Commission’s interpretation proceeds in three steps.\nFirst, an incumbent LEC must lease “technically feasible”\nfacilities for interconnection. Second, entrance facili-\nties are among the facilities that an incumbent must\nmake available for interconnection, if technically feasible.\nThird, it is technically feasible to provide access to the\nparticular entrance facilities at issue in these cases.\n                             1\n   The Commission first contends that an incumbent LEC\nmust lease, at cost-based rates, any requested facilities\nfor obtaining interconnection with the incumbent LEC’s\nnetwork, unless it is technically infeasible to do so. Sec­\ntion 251(c)(2) mandates that an incumbent LEC provide\ninterconnection, at cost-based rates, “at any technically\nfeasible point within the carrier’s network.” The FCC\nhas long construed §251(c)(2) to require incumbent LECs\nto provide, at cost-based rates, “any technically feasible\nmethod of obtaining interconnection . . . at a particular\npoint.” 47 CFR §51.321(a) (2010).\n   The requirement in §51.321(a) to provide a “method of\nobtaining interconnection,” the Commission argues, en­\ncompasses a duty to lease an existing facility to a compet­\ning LEC. When the Commission originally promulgated\n§51.321(a), it explained that incumbent LECs would be\nrequired to “adapt their facilities to interconnection” and\nto “accept the novel use of, and modification to, [their]\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnetwork facilities.” In re Implementation of Local Compe\ntition Provisions in the Telecommunications Act of 1996,\n11 FCC Rcd. 15499, 15605, ¶202 (1996) (Local Competition\nOrder). Since then, as AT&T and its amici concede, in­\ncumbent LECs have commonly leased certain facilities at\ncost-based prices to accommodate interconnection. See\nBrief for Respondent 28–29; Brief for United States Tele­\ncom Association et al. as Amici Curiae 33–35.\n   As additional support for its assertion that incumbent\nLECs are obligated to lease facilities, the FCC highlights\nthe examples in §51.321(b) of “[t]echnically feasible meth­\nods of obtaining interconnection,” which include “[m]eet\npoint interconnection arrangements.” In a meet-point\narrangement, an incumbent LEC “accommodat[es]” inter­\nconnection by building a transmission facility from its\nnetwork to a designated point, where it connects with the\ncompetitor’s corresponding transmission facility. Local\nCompetition Order ¶553. Compared to that requirement,\nthe Commission argues, the obligation to lease existing\nfacilities for interconnection is quite modest.\n\n                               2\n   Next, the Commission contends that existing entrance\nfacilities are among the facilities that an incumbent LEC\nmust lease for interconnection. According to the FCC, the\nTriennial Review Remand Order adopted a regulatory def­\ninition that reestablished that entrance facilities are\npart of an incumbent LEC’s network. See ¶137; see also\n47 CFR §51.319(e) (2005). The end of every entrance\nfacility is therefore a “point within [an incumbent] car­\nrier’s network” at which a competing LEC could request\ninterconnection, 47 U. S. C. §251(c)(2), and each entrance\nfacility potentially provides a “technically feasible method\nof obtaining interconnection,” 47 CFR §51.321(a) (2010).\n10           TALK AMERICA, INC. v.

First, we disagree\nwith AT&T’s argument that entrance facilities are not a\npart of incumbent LECs’ networks. Indeed, the Commis­\nsion’s view on this question is more than reasonable; it is\ncertainly not plainly erroneous. The Triennial Review\nRemand Order responded to the D. C.

The Com­\nmission suggests here, as it has before, that additional considerations of\ncost or reasonableness might be appropriate if a competitive LEC were\nto request that an incumbent LEC build new entrance facilities for\ninterconnection. Ibid.

Triennial Review\nRemand Order ¶¶136–137; see 47 CFR §51.319(e)(1)\n(defining dedicated transport to include “incumbent LEC\ntransmission facilities . . . between wire centers or\nswitches owned by incumbent LECs and switches owned\nby [competing] carriers”). Given that revised definition, it\nis perfectly sensible to conclude that entrance facilities are\na part of incumbent LECs’ networks.\n   Second, we are not persuaded by AT&T’s argument that\nthe Commission’s views conflict with the definition of\ninterconnection in §51.5. That regulation provides: “Inter­\nconnection is the linking of two networks for the mutual\nexchange of traffic. This term does not include the trans­\nport and termination of traffic.” AT&T focuses on the\ndefinition’s exclusion of “transport and termination of\ntraffic.” An entrance facility is a transport facility, AT&T\nargues, and it makes no sense to require an incumbent\nLEC to furnish a transport facility for interconnection\nwhen the definition of interconnection expressly excludes\ntransport.\n   We think AT&T reads too much into the exclusion of\n“transport.” The regulation cannot possibly mean that no\ntransport can occur across an interconnection facility, as\nthat would directly conflict with the statutory language.\nSee §251(c)(2) (requiring “interconnection . . . for the\ntransmission and routing of [local] telephone exchange\nservice”). The very reason for interconnection is the “mu­\ntual exchange of traffic.” 47 CFR §51.5; see also Competi\ntive Telecommunications Assn. v. FCC, 117 F. 3d 1068,\n1071–1072 (CA8 1997) (“[T]he transmission and routing of\ntelephone exchange service” is “what the interconnection,\nthe physical link, would be used for” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n   The better reading of the regulation is that it merely\nreflects that the “transport and termination of traffic” is\nsubject to different regulatory treatment than intercon­\n12           TALK AMERICA, INC. v. MICHIGAN BELL \n\n                      TELEPHONE CO.                                       \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nnection.

See 47 U. S. C.\n§§251(b)(5), 252(d)(2); 47 CFR §51.701. The Commission\nexplains that a competitive LEC typically pays one fee for\ninterconnection—“just for having the link”—and then an\nadditional fee for the transport and termination of tele­\nphone calls. Tr. of Oral Arg. 28; see also Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 3, n. 1. Entrance facilities, at\nleast when used for the mutual exchange of traffic, seem\nto us to fall comfortably within the definition of intercon­\nnection. See 597 F. 3d, at 388 (Sutton, J., dissenting)\n(noting that entrance facilities are “designed for the very\npurpose of linking two carriers’ networks” (internal quota­\ntion marks omitted)).\n   In sum, the Commission’s interpretation of its regula­\ntions is neither plainly erroneous nor inconsistent with the\nregulatory text. Contrary to AT&T’s assertion, there is no\ndanger that deferring to the Commission would effectively\n“permit the agency, under the guise of interpreting a\nregulation, to create de facto a new regulation.”5 Christen\nsen v.

See §51.321(b) (“[t]echnically feasible methods of\nobtaining interconnection . . . include, but are not limited to” the listed\nexamples); see also §51.321(a) (“[A]n incumbent LEC shall provide . . .\nany technically feasible method of obtaining interconnection” (emphasis\nadded)).\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

See ibid.; see also Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.\nUnited States, 371 U. S. 156, 168–169 (1962) (“The courts\nmay not accept appellate counsel’s post hoc rationaliza­\ntions for agency action; [SEC v.] Chenery[ Corp., 332 U. S.\n194 (1947),] requires that an agency’s discretionary order\nbe upheld, if at all, on the same basis articulated in the\norder by the agency itself”). And although the FCC con­\ncedes that it is advancing a novel interpretation of its\nlongstanding interconnection regulations, novelty alone\nis not a reason to refuse deference. The Commission ex­\nplains that the issue in these cases did not arise until\nrecently—when it initially eliminated unbundled access to\nentrance facilities in the Triennial Review Order. Until\nthen, the Commission says, a competitive LEC typically\nwould elect to lease a cost-priced entrance facility under\n§251(c)(3) since entrance facilities leased under §251(c)(3)\ncould be used for any purpose—i.e., both interconnection\nand backhauling—but entrance facilities leased under\n§251(c)(2) can be used only for interconnection. We see no\nreason to doubt this explanation.\n   AT&T suggests that the Commission is attempting to\nrequire under §251(c)(2) what courts have prevented it\nfrom requiring under §251(c)(3) and what the Commission\nitself said was not required in the Triennial Review Re\nmand Order. Tr. of Oral Arg. 50 (“[T]his is a rear guard\neffort to preserve [cost-based] pricing for things that the\n[C]ommission has said should no longer be available . . . at\n[such] pricing”). We do not think that AT&T is correct.\n                               1\n  To begin with, AT&T’s accusation does not square with\nthe regulatory history. The Commission was not com­\npelled to eliminate the obligation to lease unbundled\nentrance facilities at cost-based rates.\n  It is true that, prior to the Triennial Review orders, the\n14         TALK AMERICA, INC. v.

See Iowa Utilities Bd., 525 U. S., at 392;\nUnited States Telecom Assn. v. FCC, 290 F. 3d 415, 421–\n428 (2002), cert. denied, 538 U. S. 940 (2003). In the\nTriennial Review Order, the Commission once again rein­\nterpreted the “impair” standard and revised the list of\nnetwork elements that incumbents must provide unbun­\ndled to competitors.\n   The Commission’s initial decision to eliminate the obli­\ngation to unbundle entrance facilities, however, was not\na result of the narrower view of impairment mandated\nby this Court and the D. C. Circuit. Instead, the Commis­\nsion determined that entrance facilities need not be pro­\nvided on an unbundled basis under §251(c)(3) on the novel\nground that they are not network elements at all—\nsomething no court had ever suggested.\n   Moreover, since its initial decision to eliminate the\nunbundling obligation for entrance facilities, the Commis­\nsion has been committed to that position. When the D. C.\nCircuit questioned the Commission’s finding that entrance\nfacilities are not network elements, the Commission re­\nsponded by observing that the court “did not reject our\nconclusion that incumbent LECs need not unbundle en­\ntrance facilities, only the analysis through which we\nreached that conclusion.” Triennial Review Remand Order\n¶137. The Commission then found another way to support\nthat same conclusion.\n                    Cite as: 564 U.

The\nTriennial Review orders eliminated incumbent LECs’ obli­\ngation under §251(c)(3) to provide unbundled access to\nentrance facilities. But the FCC emphasized in both\norders that it “d[id] not alter” the obligation on incumbent\nLECs under §251(c)(2) to provide facilities for interconnec­\ntion purposes. Triennial Review Order ¶366; Triennial\nReview Remand Order ¶140. Because entrance facilities\nare used for backhauling and interconnection purposes,\nthe FCC effectively eliminated only unbundled access to\nentrance facilities for backhauling purposes—a nuance it\nexpressly noted in the first Triennial Review order. Tri\nennial Review Order ¶365. That distinction is neither\nunusual nor ambiguous.6 In these cases, the Commission\nis simply explaining the interconnection obligation that it\nleft undisturbed in the Triennial Review orders. We see\nno conflict between the Triennial Review orders and the\nCommission’s views expressed here.7\n   We are not concerned that the Triennial Review Re\nmand Order did not expressly distinguish between back­\n——————\n  6 The Commission has long recognized that a single facility can be\n\nused for different functions and that its regulatory treatment can vary\ndepending on its use. Unbundled network elements, for example, may\nnot be used for the exclusive provision of mobile wireless or long­\ndistance services. 47 CFR §51.309(b) (2010). Similarly, interconnection\narrangements may be used for local telephone service but not for long­\ndistance services. §51.305(b).\n  7 The parties and their amici dispute whether an incumbent LEC\n\nhas any way of knowing how a competitive LEC is using an entrance\nfacility. This technical factual dispute simply underscores the appro­\npriateness of deferring to the FCC. So long as the Commission is acting\nwithin the scope of its delegated authority and in accordance with\nprescribed procedures, it has greater expertise and stands in a better\nposition than this Court to make the technical and policy judgments\nnecessary to administer the complex regulatory program at issue here.\n16         TALK AMERICA, INC. v.

AT&T argues that the Commission’s holding\nin the Triennial Review Remand Order is broader than\nthat in the Triennial Review Order. In AT&T’s view, the\nCommission concluded in the Triennial Review Remand\nOrder that competitors are not impaired if they lack cost­\nbased access to entrance facilities for backhauling or\ninterconnection.\n  There are two flaws with AT&T’s reasoning. First, as\nwe have discussed, the Triennial Review Remand Order\nreinstated the ultimate conclusion of the Triennial Review\nOrder and changed only “the analysis through which [it]\nreached that conclusion.” Triennial Review Remand Order\n¶137. Second, unlike §251(c)(3)’s unbundling obligation,\n§251(c)(2)’s interconnection obligation does not require the\nCommission to consider impairment. As the dissent below\nobserved, it would be surprising indeed if the FCC had\ntaken the novel step of incorporating impairment into\ninterconnection without comment. 597 F. 3d, at 389 (opin­\nion of Sutton, J.).\n                         *     *    *\n  The FCC as amicus curiae has advanced a reasonable\ninterpretation of its regulations, and we defer to its views.\nThe judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Sixth Circuit is reversed.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of these cases.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

I would reach the same\nresult even without benefit of the rule that we will defer to\nan agency’s interpretation of its own regulations, a rule in\nrecent years attributed to our opinion in Auer v. Robbins,\n519 U. S. 452, 461 (1997), though it first appeared in our\njurisprudence more than half a century earlier, see Bowles\nv. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U. S. 410 (1945). In\nthis suit I have no need to rely on Auer deference, because\nI believe the FCC’s interpretation is the fairest reading of\nthe orders in question. Most cogently, ¶140 of the Trien\nnial Review Remand Order serves no purpose unless one\naccepts (as AT&T does not) the distinction between back­\nhauling and interconnection that is referred to in footnotes\nto ¶¶138 and 141 of the order. 20 FCC Rcd. 2533, 2610–\n2612 (2005). The order would have been clearer, to be\nsure, if the distinction had been made in a footnote to ¶140\n2          TALK AMERICA, INC. v. MICHIGAN BELL \n\n                    TELEPHONE CO.                           \n\n                   SCALIA, J., concurring \n\n\nitself, but the distinction is there, and without it ¶140 has\nno point.\n   It is comforting to know that I would reach the Court’s\nresult even without Auer. For while I have in the past\nuncritically accepted that rule, I have become increasingly\ndoubtful of its validity. On the surface, it seems to be a\nnatural corollary—indeed, an a fortiori application—of the\nrule that we will defer to an agency’s interpretation of the\nstatute it is charged with implementing, see Chevron\nU. S. A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467\nU. S. 837 (1984). But it is not. When Congress enacts an\nimprecise statute that it commits to the implementation of\nan executive agency, it has no control over that implemen­\ntation (except, of course, through further, more precise,\nlegislation). The legislative and executive functions are\nnot combined. But when an agency promulgates an im­\nprecise rule, it leaves to itself the implementation of that\nrule, and thus the initial determination of the rule’s mean­\ning. And though the adoption of a rule is an exercise of\nthe executive rather than the legislative power, a properly\nadopted rule has fully the effect of law. It seems contrary\nto fundamental principles of separation of powers to per­\nmit the person who promulgates a law to interpret it as\nwell. “When the legislative and executive powers are\nunited in the same person, or in the same body of magis­\ntrates, there can be no liberty; because apprehensions may\narise, lest the same monarch or senate should enact ty­\nrannical laws, to execute them in a tyrannical manner.”\nMontesquieu, Spirit of the Laws bk. XI, ch. 6, pp. 151–152\n(O. Piest ed., T. Nugent transl. 1949).\n   Deferring to an agency’s interpretation of a statute does\nnot encourage Congress, out of a desire to expand its\npower, to enact vague statutes; the vagueness effectively\ncedes power to the Executive. By contrast, deferring to an\nagency’s interpretation of its own rule encourages the\nagency to enact vague rules which give it the power, in\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

This frustrates\nthe notice and predictability purposes of rulemaking, and\npromotes arbitrary government. The seeming inappro­\npriateness of Auer deference is especially evident in cases\nsuch as these, involving an agency that has repeatedly\nbeen rebuked in its attempts to expand the statute beyond\nits text, and has repeatedly sought new means to the same\nends.\n   There are undoubted advantages to Auer deference. It\nmakes the job of a reviewing court much easier, and since\nit usually produces affirmance of the agency’s view with­\nout conflict in the Circuits, it imparts (once the agency has\nspoken to clarify the regulation) certainty and predict­\nability to the administrative process.
