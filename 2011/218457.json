UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 09–11311.       Argued January 12, 2011—Decided June 9, 2011\nWhen he pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, see 8\n U. S. C. §922(g)(1), petitioner Sykes had prior convictions for at least\n three felonies, including the state-law crime of “us[ing] a vehicle” to\n “knowingly or intentionally” “fle[e] from a law enforcement officer”\n after being ordered to stop, Ind. Code §35–44–3–3(b)(1)(A) (2004).\n The Federal District Court decided that the prior convictions sub\n jected Sykes to the 15-year mandatory minimum prison term that the\n Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. §924(e), provides for\n an armed defendant who has three prior “violent felony” convictions.\n Rejecting Sykes’ argument that his vehicle flight felony was not “vio\n lent” under ACCA, the Seventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Felony vehicle flight, as proscribed by Indiana law, is a violent\n felony for purposes of ACCA. Pp. 5–14.\n    (a) The “categorical approach” used to determine if a particular\n crime is a violent felony “consider[s] whether the elements of the of\n fense are of the type that would justify its inclusion within the resid\n ual provision [of 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)], without inquiring into the\n specific conduct of th[e] particular offender.” James v. United States,\n 550 U. S. 192, 202 (emphasis deleted). When punishable by more\n than one year in prison, burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes that\n involve use of explosives are violet felonies. Under the residual\n clause in question so too is a crime that “otherwise involves conduct\n that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,”\n §924(e)(2)(B)(ii), i.e., a risk “comparable to that posed by its closest\n analog among” the statute’s enumerated offenses. Id., at 203. When\n a perpetrator flees police in a car, his determination to elude capture\n makes a lack of concern for the safety of others an inherent part of\n the offense. Even if he drives without going full speed or the wrong\n2                       SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    way, he creates the possibility that police will, in a legitimate and\n    lawful manner, exceed or almost match his speed or use force to bring\n    him within their custody. His indifference to these collateral conse\n    quences has violent—even lethal—potential for others. A fleeing\n    criminal who creates a risk of this dimension takes action similar in\n    degree of danger to that involved in arson, which also entails inten\n    tional release of a destructive force dangerous to others. Also telling\n    is a comparison to burglary, which is dangerous because it can end in\n    confrontation leading to violence. In fact, the risks associated with\n    vehicle flight may outstrip the dangers of both burglary and arson.\n    While statistics are not dispositive, studies show that the risk of per\n    sonal injuries is about 20% lower for each of those enumerated crimes\n    than for vehicle pursuits. Thus, Indiana’s prohibition on vehicle\n    flight falls within §924(e)(2)(B)(ii)’s residual clause because, as a\n    categorical matter, it presents a serious potential risk of physical in\n    jury to another. Pp. 5–9.\n       (b) Sykes’ argument—that Begay v. United States, 553 U. S. 137,\n    and Chambers v. United States, 555 U. S. 122, require ACCA predi\n    cate crimes to be purposeful, violent, and aggressive in ways that ve\n    hicle flight is not—overreads those opinions. In general, levels of risk\n    divide crimes that qualify as violent felonies from those that do not.\n    Chambers is no exception: It explained that failure to report does not\n    qualify because the typical offender is not “significantly more likely\n    than others to attack, or physically to resist, an apprehender.” 555\n    U. S., at ___–___. Begay, which held that driving under the influence\n    (DUI) is not an ACCA predicate and stated that it is not purposeful,\n    violent, and aggressive, 553 U. S., at 145–148, is the Court’s sole re\n    sidual clause decision in which risk was not the dispositive factor.\n    But Begay also gave a more specific reason for its holding: DUI “need\n    not be purposeful or deliberate,” id., at 145, and is analogous to\n    strict-liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes. Begay’s “pur\n    poseful, violent, and aggressive” phrase is an addition to the statu\n    tory text that has no precise link to the residual clause. Because ve\n    hicle flight is not a strict-liability, negligence, or recklessness crime\n    and is, as a categorical matter, similar in risk to the crimes listed in\n    the residual clause, it is a violent felony. Pp. 10–11\n       (c) Sykes contends that the fact that Ind. Code §35–44–3–3(b)(1)(B)\n    criminalizes flight by an offender who “operates a vehicle in a man\n    ner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person”\n    indicates that Indiana did not intend for §35–44–3–3(b)(1)(A), under\n    which he was convicted, to encompass the particular class of vehicle\n    flights reached by subsection (b)(1)(B). This argument is unconvinc\n    ing. Indiana treats the two subsections as felonies of the same mag\n    nitude carrying similar prison terms, suggesting that subsection\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  (b)(1)(A) is roughly equivalent to one type of subsection (b)(1)(B) vio\n  lation. Pp. 11–13.\n    (d) Congress framed ACCA in general and qualitative, rather than\n  encyclopedic, terms. The residual clause imposes enhanced punish\n  ment for unlawful firearm possession when the relevant prior of\n  fenses involved a potential risk of physical injury similar to that pre\n  sented by several enumerated offenses.          It instructs potential\n  recidivists regarding the applicable sentencing regime if they again\n  transgress. This intelligible principle provides guidance, allowing a\n  person to conform his conduct to the law. While this approach may at\n  times be more difficult for courts to implement, it is within congres\n  sional power to enact.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 9, 2011]\n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   It is a federal crime for a convicted felon to be in unlaw\nful possession of a firearm. 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(1). The or\ndinary maximum sentence for that crime is 10 years of\nimprisonment. §924(a)(2). If, however, when the unlawful\npossession occurred, the felon had three previous convic\ntions for a violent felony or serious drug offense, the\npunishment is increased to a minimum term of 15 years.\n§924(e). The instant case is another in a series in which\nthe Court is called upon to interpret §924(e) to determine\nif a particular previous conviction was for a “violent fel\nony,” as that term is used in the punishment enhancement\nstatute. See James v. United States, 550 U. S. 192 (2007);\nBegay v. United States, 553 U. S. 137 (2008); Chambers v.\nUnited States, 555 U. S. 122 (2009).\n   In this case the previous conviction in question is under\nan Indiana statute that makes it a criminal offense when\never the driver of a vehicle knowingly or intentionally\n“flees from a law enforcement officer.” Ind. Code §35–44–\n3–3 (2004). The relevant text of the statute is set out\nin the discussion below. For the reasons explained, the\nvehicle flight that the statute proscribes is a violent felony\n2                 SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nas the federal statute uses that term.\n                               I\n   Petitioner Marcus Sykes pleaded guilty to being a felon\nin possession of a firearm, 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(1), in con\nnection with an attempted robbery of two people at gun\npoint. Sykes had previous convictions for at least three\nfelonies. On two separate occasions Sykes used a firearm\nto commit robbery, in one case to rob a man of his $200\nwristwatch and in another to rob a woman of her purse.\n   His third prior felony is the one of concern here. Sykes\nwas convicted for vehicle flight, in violation of Indiana’s\n“resisting law enforcement” law. Ind. Code §35–44–3–3.\nThat law provides:\n       “(a) A person who knowingly or intentionally:\n       “(1) forcibly resists, obstructs, or interferes with a\n    law enforcement officer or a person assisting the offi\n    cer while the officer is lawfully engaged in the execu\n    tion of his duties as an officer;\n       “(2) forcibly resists, obstructs, or interferes with the\n    authorized service or execution of a civil or criminal\n    process or order of a court; or\n       “(3) flees from a law enforcement officer after the of\n    ficer has, by visible or audible means, identified him\n    self and ordered the person to stop;\n    “commits resisting law enforcement, a Class A mis\n    demeanor, except as provided in subsection (b).\n       “(b) The offense under subsection (a) is a:\n       “(1) Class D felony if:\n       “(A) the offense is described in subsection (a)(3) and\n    the person uses a vehicle to commit the offense; or\n       “(B) while committing any offense described in sub\n    section (a), the person draws or uses a deadly weapon,\n    inflicts bodily injury on another person, or operates a\n    vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of\n    bodily injury to another person;\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n      (2) Class C felony if, while committing any offense\n    described in subsection (a), the person operates a ve\n    hicle in a manner that causes serious bodily injury to\n    another person; and\n      (3) Class B felony if, while committing any offense\n    described in subsection (a), the person operates a ve\n    hicle in a manner that causes the death of another\n    person.”\n  Here, as will be further explained, Sykes used a vehicle\nto flee after an officer ordered him to stop, which was, as\nthe statute provides, a class D felony. The Court of Ap\npeals of Indiana has interpreted the crime of vehicle flight\nto require “a knowing attempt to escape law enforcement.”\nWoodward v. State, 770 N. E. 2d 897, 901 (2002) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Woodward involved a driver\nwho repeatedly flashed his bright lights and failed to obey\ntraffic signals. Id., at 898. When an officer activated his\nemergency equipment, the defendant became “aware . . .\nthat [the officer] wanted him to pull his vehicle over,” but\ninstead drove for a mile without “stopping, slowing, or\notherwise acknowledging” the officer because, he later\ntestified, he “was ‘trying to rationalize why [he] would be\npulled over.’ ” Id., at 898, 901. Though the defendant later\nclaimed that he was also seeking a “well-lighted place to\nstop where there would be someone who knew him,” id.,\nat 901, his actions suggested otherwise. He passed two\ngas stations, a food outlet store, and a McDonald’s be-\nfore pulling over. When he got out of the car, he began to\nshout profanities at the pursuing officer. Ibid. By that\ntime, the officer had called for backup and exited his own\nvehicle with his gun drawn. Id., at 898. In answering the\ndefendant’s challenge to the sufficiency of the above evi\ndence, the Indiana court held that because he knew that a\npolice officer sought to stop him, the defendant could not\n“choose the location of the stop” and insist on completing\n4                 SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe stop “on his own terms,” as he had done, “without\nadequate justification,” which he lacked. Id., at 901–902.\n   In the instant case a report prepared for Sykes’ federal\nsentencing describes the details of the Indiana crime.\nAfter observing Sykes driving without using needed head\nlights, police activated their emergency equipment for a\ntraffic stop. Sykes did not stop. A chase ensued. Sykes\nwove through traffic, drove on the wrong side of the road\nand through yards containing bystanders, passed through\na fence, and struck the rear of a house. Then he fled on\nfoot. He was found only with the aid of a police dog.\n   The District Court decided that his three prior convic\ntions, including the one for violating the prohibition on\nvehicle flight in subsection (b)(1)(A) of the Indiana statute\njust discussed, were violent felonies for purposes of §924(e)\nand sentenced Sykes to 188 months of imprisonment. On\nappeal Sykes conceded that his two prior robbery con\nvictions were violent felonies. He did not dispute that his\nvehicle flight offense was a felony, but he did argue that it\nwas not violent. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh\nCircuit affirmed. 598 F. 3d 334 (2010). The court’s opin\nion was consistent with the rulings of the Courts of Ap\npeals in the First, Fifth, Sixth, and Tenth Circuits. Powell\nv. United States, 430 F. 3d 490 (CA1 2005) (per curiam);\nUnited States v. Harrimon, 568 F. 3d 531, 534–537 (CA5\n2009); United States v. LaCasse, 567 F. 3d 763, 765–767\n(CA6 2009); United States v. McConnell, 605 F. 3d 822,\n827–830 (CA10 2010) (finding the flight to be a “crime of\nviolence” under the “nearly identical” §4B1.2(a)(2) of the\nUnited States Sentencing Guidelines). It was in conflict\nwith a ruling by a Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Cir\ncuit in United States v. Harrison, 558 F. 3d 1280, 1291–\n1296 (2009), and at least in tension, if not in conflict, with\nthe reasoning of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Cir\ncuit in United States v.

S. ___ (2010), allows this\nCourt to address the conflict.\n                          II\n  In determining whether an offense is a violent felony,\nthis Court has explained,\n    “we employ the categorical approach . . . . Under this\n    approach, we look only to the fact of conviction and\n    the statutory definition of the prior offense, and do not\n    generally consider the particular facts disclosed by the\n    record of conviction. That is, we consider whether the\n    elements of the offense are of the type that would\n    justify its inclusion within the residual provision,\n    without inquiring into the specific conduct of this par\n    ticular offender.” James, 550 U. S., at 202 (internal\n    quotation marks and citations omitted); see also Tay\n    lor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 599–602 (1990).\nSo while there may be little doubt that the circumstances\nof the flight in Sykes’ own case were violent, the question\nis whether §35–44–3–3 of the Indiana Code, as a categori\ncal matter, is a violent felony.\n   Under 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B), an offense is deemed a\nviolent felony if it is a crime punishable by more than one\nyear of imprisonment that\n      “(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or\n    threatened use of physical force against the person of\n    another; or\n      “(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of\n    explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that pre\n    sents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\n    another.”\nResisting law enforcement through felonious vehicle flight\n6                 SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndoes not meet the requirements of clause (i), and it is not\namong the specific offenses named in clause (ii). Thus, it\nis violent under this statutory scheme only if it fits within\nthe so-called residual provision of clause (ii). To be a vio\nlent crime, it must be an offense that “otherwise in-\nvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of\nphysical injury to another.”\n   The question, then, is whether Indiana’s prohibition on\nflight from an officer by driving a vehicle—the violation of\nIndiana law for which Sykes sustained his earlier convic\ntion—falls within the residual clause because, as a cate\ngorical matter, it presents a serious potential risk of\nphysical injury to another. The offenses enumerated in\n§924(e)(2)(B)(ii)—burglary, extortion, arson, and crimes\ninvolving use of explosives—provide guidance in making\nthis determination. For instance, a crime involves the\nrequisite risk when “the risk posed by [the crime in ques\ntion] is comparable to that posed by its closest analog\namong the enumerated offenses.” James, 550 U. S., at 203\n(explaining that attempted burglary poses risks akin to\nthat of completed burglary).\n   When a perpetrator defies a law enforcement command\nby fleeing in a car, the determination to elude capture\nmakes a lack of concern for the safety of property and\npersons of pedestrians and other drivers an inherent part\nof the offense. Even if the criminal attempting to elude\ncapture drives without going at full speed or going the\nwrong way, he creates the possibility that police will, in a\nlegitimate and lawful manner, exceed or almost match his\nspeed or use force to bring him within their custody. A\nperpetrator’s indifference to these collateral consequences\nhas violent—even lethal—potential for others. A criminal\nwho takes flight and creates a risk of this dimension takes\naction similar in degree of danger to that involved in\narson, which also entails intentional release of a destruc\ntive force dangerous to others. This similarity is a begin\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nning point in establishing that vehicle flight presents a\nserious potential risk of physical injury to another.\n   Another consideration is a comparison to the crime of\nburglary. Burglary is dangerous because it can end in\nconfrontation leading to violence. Id., at 200. The same is\ntrue of vehicle flight, but to an even greater degree. The\nattempt to elude capture is a direct challenge to an offi\ncer’s authority. It is a provocative and dangerous act that\ndares, and in a typical case requires, the officer to give\nchase. The felon’s conduct gives the officer reason to\nbelieve that the defendant has something more serious\nthan a traffic violation to hide. In Sykes’ case, officers\npursued a man with two prior violent felony convictions\nand marijuana in his possession. In other cases officers\nmay discover more about the violent potential of the flee\ning suspect by running a check on the license plate or by\nrecognizing the fugitive as a convicted felon. See, e.g.,\nArizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 2).\n   Because an accepted way to restrain a driver who poses\ndangers to others is through seizure, officers pursuing\nfleeing drivers may deem themselves duty bound to esca\nlate their response to ensure the felon is apprehended.\nScott v. Harris, 550 U. S. 372, 385 (2007), rejected the\npossibility that police could eliminate the danger from a\nvehicle flight by giving up the chase because the perpetra\ntor “might have been just as likely to respond by continu\ning to drive recklessly as by slowing down and wiping his\nbrow.” And once the pursued vehicle is stopped, it is\nsometimes necessary for officers to approach with guns\ndrawn to effect arrest. Confrontation with police is the\nexpected result of vehicle flight. It places property and\npersons at serious risk of injury.\n   Risk of violence is inherent to vehicle flight. Between\nthe confrontations that initiate and terminate the inci\ndent, the intervening pursuit creates high risks of crashes.\nIt presents more certain risk as a categorical matter than\n8                 SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nburglary. It is well known that when offenders use motor\nvehicles as their means of escape they create serious po\ntential risks of physical injury to others. Flight from a\nlaw enforcement officer invites, even demands, pursuit.\nAs that pursuit continues, the risk of an accident accumu\nlates. And having chosen to flee, and thereby commit a\ncrime, the perpetrator has all the more reason to seek to\navoid capture.\n   Unlike burglaries, vehicle flights from an officer by\ndefinitional necessity occur when police are present, are\nflights in defiance of their instructions, and are effected\nwith a vehicle that can be used in a way to cause serious\npotential risk of physical injury to another. See post, at 5–\n6 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment); see also post, at\n6–7 (listing Indiana cases addressing ordinary intentional\nvehicle flight and noting the high-risk conduct that those\nconvictions involved).\n   Although statistics are not dispositive, here they con\nfirm the commonsense conclusion that Indiana’s vehicular\nflight crime is a violent felony. See Chambers, 555 U. S.,\nat 129 (explaining that statistical evidence sometimes\n“helps provide a conclusive . . . answer” concerning the\nrisks that crimes present). As JUSTICE THOMAS explains,\nchase-related crashes kill more than 100 nonsuspects\nevery year. See post, at 4–5. Injury rates are much\nhigher. Studies show that between 18% and 41% of chases\ninvolve crashes, which always carry a risk of injury, and\nthat between 4% and 17% of all chases end in injury. See\nibid.\n   A 2008 International Association of Chiefs of Police\n(IACP) study examined 7,737 police pursuits reported by\n56 agencies in 30 States during 2001–2007. C.

Those pursuits, the study found, resulted in\n313 injuries to police and bystanders, a rate of slightly\nover 4 injuries to these nonsuspects per 100 pursuits. Id.,\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nat 57. Given that police may be least likely to pursue\nsuspects where the dangers to bystanders are greatest—\ni.e., when flights occur at extraordinarily high speeds—\nit is possible that risks associated with vehicle flight are\neven higher.\n   Those risks may outstrip the dangers of at least two\noffenses enumerated in 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Ac\ncording to a study by the Department of Justice, approxi\nmately 3.7 million burglaries occurred on average each\nyear in the United States between 2003 and 2007. Bureau\nof Justice Statistics, S. Catalano, Victimization during\nHousehold Burglary 1 (Sept. 2010). Those burglaries\nresulted in an annual average of approximately 118,000\ninjuries, or 3.2 injuries for every 100 burglaries. Id., at 9–\n10. That risk level is 20% lower than that which the IACP\nfound for vehicle pursuits.\n   The U. S. Fire Administration (USFA) maintains the\nworld’s largest data bank on fires. It secures participation\nfrom over one-third of U. S. fire departments. It reports\nan estimated 38,400 arsons in 2008. Those fires resulted\nin an estimated 1,255 injuries, or 3.3 injuries per 100\narsons.

That risk level is about 20% lower than that\nreported by the IACP for vehicle flight.\n10                SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               III \n\n   Sykes argues that, regardless of risk level, typical vehi\ncle flights do not involve the kinds of dangers that the\nArmed Career Criminal Act’s (ACCA) residual clause\ndemands. In his view this Court’s decisions in Begay and\nChambers require ACCA predicates to be purposeful,\nviolent, and aggressive in ways that vehicle flight is not.\nSykes, in taking this position, overreads the opinions of\nthis Court.\n   ACCA limits the residual clause to crimes “typically\ncommitted by those whom one normally labels ‘armed\ncareer criminals,’ ” that is, crimes that “show an increased\nlikelihood that the offender is the kind of person who\nmight deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.”\nBegay, 553 U. S., at 146. In general, levels of risk divide\ncrimes that qualify from those that do not. See, e.g.,\nJames, 550 U. S. 192 (finding attempted burglary risky\nenough to qualify). Chambers is no exception. 555 U. S.,\nat ___–___ (slip op., at 5–6) (explaining that failure to\nreport does not qualify because the typical offender is not\n“significantly more likely than others to attack, or physi\ncally to resist, an apprehender”).\n   The sole decision of this Court concerning the reach of\nACCA’s residual clause in which risk was not the dis\npositive factor is Begay, which held that driving under\nthe influence (DUI) is not an ACCA predicate. There, the\nCourt stated that DUI is not purposeful, violent, and\naggressive. 553 U. S., at 145–148. But the Court also\ngave a more specific reason for its holding. “[T]he conduct\nfor which the drunk driver is convicted (driving under the\ninfluence) need not be purposeful or deliberate,” id., at 145\n(analogizing DUI to strict-liability, negligence, and reck\nlessness crimes). By contrast, the Indiana statute at issue\nhere has a stringent mens rea requirement. Violators\nmust act “knowingly or intentionally.” Ind. Code §35–44–\n3–3(a); see Woodward, 770 N. E. 2d, at 901 (construing the\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute to require “a knowing attempt to escape law en\nforcement” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   The phrase “purposeful, violent, and aggressive” has no\nprecise textual link to the residual clause, which requires\nthat an ACCA predicate “otherwise involv[e] conduct that\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\nanother.” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The Begay phrase is an addi\ntion to the statutory text. In many cases the purposeful,\nviolent, and aggressive inquiry will be redundant with the\ninquiry into risk, for crimes that fall within the former\nformulation and those that present serious potential risks\nof physical injury to others tend to be one and the same.\nAs between the two inquiries, risk levels provide a cate\ngorical and manageable standard that suffices to resolve\nthe case before us.\n   Begay involved a crime akin to strict liability, negli\ngence, and recklessness crimes; and the purposeful, vio\nlent, and aggressive formulation was used in that case to\nexplain the result. The felony at issue here is not a strict\nliability, negligence, or recklessness crime and because it\nis, for the reasons stated and as a categorical matter,\nsimilar in risk to the listed crimes, it is a crime that “oth\nerwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential\nrisk of physical injury to another.” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii).\n                              IV\n   Sykes finds it significant that his flight conviction was\nnot under the Indiana provision that criminalizes flight in\nwhich the offender “operates a vehicle in a manner that\ncreates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another per\nson.” Ind. Code §35–44–3–3(b)(1)(B). In structuring its\nlaws in this way, Sykes contends, Indiana confirmed that\nit did not intend subsection (b)(1)(A)’s general prohibition\non vehicle flight to encompass the particular class of vehi\ncle flights that subsection (b)(1)(B) reaches.\n   Sykes’ argument is unconvincing. Indiana treats viola\n12                SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntions of subsections (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) as crimes of the\nsame magnitude. They are both class D felonies, and both\ncarry terms of between six months and three years, Ind.\nCode §35–50–2–7(a). The distinction between the provi\nsions is their relationship to subsection (a), which prohib\nits, among other acts, much conduct in which a person\n“(1) forcibly resists, obstructs, or interferes with a law en\nforcement officer . . . ; (2) forcibly resists, obstructs, or\ninterferes with the authorized service or execution of . . .\nprocess . . . ; or (3) flees from a law enforcement officer.”\n§35–44–3–3(a). Subsection (b)(1)(A) only involves the\nconduct barred by subsection (a)(3)—flight—which, it\nstates, is a felony whenever committed with a vehicle.\nUnder subsection (b)(1)(B), by contrast, any of the offenses\nin subsection (a) is a felony if the offender commits it\nwhile using a vehicle to create a substantial risk of bodily\ninjury to another. Taken together, the statutory incen\ntives always favor prosecuting vehicle flights under sub\nsection (b)(1)(A) rather than subsection (b)(1)(B). They\nreflect a judgment that some offenses in subsection (a) can\nbe committed without a vehicle or without creating sub\nstantial risks. They reflect the further judgment that this\nis not so for vehicle flights.\n   Serious and substantial risks are an inherent part of\nvehicle flight. Under subsection (b)(1)(A), they need not be\nproved separately to secure a conviction equal in magni\ntude to those available for other forms of resisting law\nenforcement with a vehicle that involve similar risks.\n   In other words, the “similarity in punishment for these\nrelated, overlapping offenses suggests that [subsection\n(b)(1)(A)] is the rough equivalent of one type of [subsection\n(b)(1)(B)] violation.” Post, at 10 (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment); see also ibid., n. 2. By adding subsection\n(b)(1)(A) in 1998, the Indiana Legislature determined that\nsubsection (b)(1)(A) by itself sufficed as a basis for the\npunishments available under subsection (b)(1)(B).

As\nthe above discussion indicates, however, the case at hand\ndoes not present the occasion to decide that question.\n                              V\n   Congress chose to frame ACCA in general and qualita\ntive, rather than encyclopedic, terms. It could have de\nfined violent felonies by compiling a list of specific covered\noffenses. Under the principle that all are deemed to know\nthe law, every armed felon would then be assumed to\nknow which of his prior felonies could serve to increase\nhis sentence. Given that ACCA “requires judges to make\nsometimes difficult evaluations of the risks posed by dif\nferent offenses,” this approach could simplify adjudica\ntions for judges in some cases. James, 550 U. S., at 210,\nn. 6.\n   Congress instead stated a normative principle. The re\nsidual clause imposes enhanced punishment for unlaw-\nful possession of the firearm when the relevant prior\noffenses involved a potential risk of physical injury similar\nto that presented by burglary, extortion, arson, and crimes\ninvolving use of explosives. The provision instructs poten\ntial recidivists regarding the applicable sentencing regime\nif they again transgress. It states an intelligible principle\nand provides guidance that allows a person to “conform his\nor her conduct to the law.” Chicago v. Morales, 527 U. S.\n14                SYKES v.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                         [June 9, 2011]\n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in the judgment.\n   I agree with the Court that the Indiana crime of in\ntentional vehicular flight, Ind. Code §35–44–3–3(b)(1)(A)\n(2004), is a “violent felony” under the Armed Career\nCriminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The\nmajority also correctly refuses to apply the “ purposeful,\nviolent, and aggressive ” test created in Begay v. United\nStates, 553 U. S. 137, 145 (2008). However, the majority\nerrs by implying that the “purposeful, violent, and aggres\nsive” test may still apply to offenses “akin to strict liabil\nity, negligence, and recklessness crimes.” Ante, at 11.\n   The error in imposing that test, which does not appear\nin ACCA, is well catalogued. See, e.g., Begay, 553 U. S., at\n150–152 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 158–\n159 (ALITO, J., dissenting); ante, at 11 (finding “no pre\ncise textual link” in the statute). I agree with JUSTICES\nSCALIA and KAGAN that the majority’s partial retreat from\nBegay only further muddies ACCA’s residual clause. Post,\nat 1 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); post, at 1, n. 1 (KAGAN, J.,\ndissenting).\n   The only question here is whether, in the ordinary case,\nusing a vehicle to knowingly flee from the police after\nbeing ordered to stop “involves conduct that presents a\nserious potential risk of physical injury to another.”\n§924(e)(2)(B)(ii). I believe that it does. Therefore I concur\nin the judgment.\n2                 SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n                              I\n   Under Indiana law, intentional vehicular flight is a\nfelony. Any person who “knowingly or intentionally . . .\nflees from a law enforcement officer after the officer has,\nby visible or audible means, identified himself and ordered\nthe person to stop” commits a misdemeanor. Ind. Code\n§35–44–3–3(a)(3). If the person “uses a vehicle” to flee,\nhowever, the offense is elevated to a class D felony.\n§3(b)(1)(A). That felony, the parties agree, qualifies as a\n“violent felony” under ACCA if it is “burglary, arson, or\nextortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves\nconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical\ninjury to another.” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii).\n   As explained below, Indiana’s crime of intentional ve\nhicular flight “involves conduct that presents a serious\npotential risk of physical injury to another.” Ibid. The\nelements of §3(b)(1)(A), compared to those of the enumer\nated ACCA offense of burglary, suggest that an ordinary\nviolation of §3(b)(1)(A) is far riskier than an ordinary\nburglary. Statistics, common experience, and Indiana\ncases support this conclusion.\n                               A\n   The specific crimes Congress listed as “violent felon\n[ies]” in ACCA—arson, extortion, burglary, and use of\nexplosives—provide a “baseline against which to measure\nthe degree of risk” that a nonenumerated offense must\npresent in order to qualify as a violent felony. James v.\nUnited States, 550 U. S. 192, 208 (2007); see also ante, at\n6. Burglary, for instance, sets a low baseline level for risk.\nIts elements are “unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or\nremaining in, a building or structure, with intent to com\nmit a crime.” Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 599\n(1990). As this Court has recognized, the risk of burglary\nis in “the possibility that an innocent person might appear\nwhile the crime is in progress” and the danger inherent in\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nsuch a “face-to-face confrontation.” James, 550 U. S., at\n203. The chance of an interruption or confrontation in an\nordinary burglary is, of course, quite small; burglars gen\nerally plan and commit their crimes with an eye toward\navoiding detection. Nevertheless, that small chance suf\nficed for Congress to list burglary as a “violent felony,” and\nfor this Court to hold that attempted burglary also quali\nfies. See id., at 195.\n   Compared to burglary, the elements of intentional ve\nhicular flight describe conduct that ordinarily poses\ngreater potential risk. Although interruption and confron\ntation are quite rare for burglary, every §3(a)(3) flight is\ncommitted in the presence of a police officer. Every\n§3(a)(3) flight also involves a perpetrator acting in know\ning defiance of an officer’s direct order to stop, “which is a\nclear challenge to the officer’s authority and typically\ninitiates pursuit.” United States v. Harrimon, 568 F. 3d\n531, 535 (CA5 2009); see also United States v. Spells, 537\nF. 3d 743, 752 (CA7 2008) (“Taking flight calls the officer\nto give chase, and aside from any accompanying risk to\npedestrians and other motorists, such flight dares the\nofficer to needlessly endanger himself in pursuit”). Fi\nnally, in every §3(b)(1)(A) flight, the perpetrator is armed\nwith what can be a deadly weapon: a vehicle. See, e.g.,\nScott v. Harris, 550 U. S. 372, 383 (2007) (noting that “the\nthreat posed by the flight on foot of an unarmed suspect”\nwas not “even remotely comparable to the extreme danger\nto human life” posed by that vehicular chase); United\nStates v. Kendrick, 423 F. 3d 803, 809 (CA8 2005) (“[T]he\ndangerous circumstances surrounding a person’s attempt\nto flee from law enforcement are compounded by the\nperson’s operation of a motor vehicle”); United States v.\nAceves-Rosales, 832 F. 2d 1155, 1157 (CA9 1987) (per\ncuriam) (“It is indisputable that an automobile . . . can be\nused as a deadly weapon”).\n   In sum, every violation of §3(b)(1)(A) involves a defiant\n4                 SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nsuspect with a dangerous weapon committing a felony in\nfront of a police officer. Based on its elements, the poten\ntial risk of intentional vehicular flight resembles “armed\nburglary in the presence of a security guard” more than\nsimple burglary. Section 3(b)(1)(A) outlaws conduct with\nmuch more risk—a far greater likelihood of confrontation\nwith police and a greater chance of violence in that\nconfrontation—than burglary. It follows that the “the con\nduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordi\nnary case,” poses a greater risk of harm than the enumer\nated offense of burglary. James, supra, at 208.\n                               B\n  Common experience and statistical evidence confirm the\n“potential risk” of intentional vehicular flight. Cf. Cham\nbers v. United States, 555 U. S. 122, 129 (2009) (statistical\nevidence, though not always necessary, “strongly supports\nthe intuitive belief that failure to report does not involve a\nserious potential risk of physical injury”). Data from the\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows\nthat approximately 100 police officers, pedestrians, and\noccupants of other cars are killed each year in chase\nrelated crashes. National Center for Statistics & Analysis,\nFatalities in Motor Vehicle Traffic Crashes Involving\nPolice in Pursuit 37–56 (2010) (reporting 1,269 such\ndeaths between 2000 and 2009).\n  The number injured must be much higher. Many thou\nsands of police chases occur every year. In California and\nPennsylvania, which collect statewide pursuit data, police\nwere involved in a combined total of more than 8,700\nchases in 2007 alone. See Pennsylvania State Police\nBureau of Research & Development, Police Pursuits 2007\nAnnual Report; Report to the Legislature, Senate Bill 719,\nCalifornia Police Pursuits (March 2008); see also Schultz,\nHudak, & Alpert, Emergency Driving and Pursuits, FBI\nLaw Enforcement Bulletin, Apr. 2009, pp. 1, 4 (surveying\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

And up to 41%\nof all chases involve a crash, which always carries some\nrisk of injury.

Police Strategies & Management 729,\n740 (1997) (citing nine studies, each showing a crash rate\nbetween 18% and 41%). Indeed, studies show that 4% to\n17% of all chases actually cause injury. Ibid.; see also C.\nLum & G. Fachner, Police Pursuits in an Age of Innova\ntion and Reform 57 (2008) (finding that 23.5% of flights\ninvolve a crash, and 9% of flights cause injury).\n   An International Association of Chiefs of Police study\nof 7,737 pursuits across 30 States found 900 injuries, of\nwhich 313 were to police or bystanders. Ibid. As the\nmajority observes, that injury rate is just over 4 injuries\nper 100 chases, excluding injuries to the perpetrator.\nAnte, at 8. By comparison, the injury rate for burglary\nand arson is around 3 injuries per 100 crimes, or less.\nAnte, at 9; see also Harrimon, supra, at 537 (citing similar\narson statistics, showing between 1 and 3 injuries per 100\nfires, apparently including injuries to perpetrators). Sta\ntistics support what logic suggests: The ordinary case of\nintentional vehicular flight is risky, indeed, more so than\nsome offenses listed in ACCA.\n   These statistical risks of intentional flight merely rein\nforce common sense and real world experience.

See Woodward v. State, 770 N. E. 2d\n897, 900–901 (Ind. App. 2002); post, at 4 (KAGAN, J., dis\nsenting). Such a flight, he urges, would not present “a\nserious potential risk of physical injury to another,” so\na conviction under the statute cannot categorically be a\nviolent felony.\n   The fact that Sykes can imagine a nonrisky way to\nviolate §3(b)(1)(A) does not disprove that intentional ve\nhicular flight is dangerous “in the ordinary case.” See\nJames, 550 U. S., at 208. It is also possible to imagine\ncommitting burglary—an enumerated offense—under\ncircumstances that pose virtually no risk of physical in\njury. See id., at 207 (hypothesizing a “break-in of an\nunoccupied structure located far off the beaten path and\naway from any potential intervenors”).\n   Nor has Sykes established that the nonrisky scenario he\nimagines is the ordinary violation of §3(b)(1)(A). Sykes\noffers nothing more than two Indiana cases that, in his\nview, are instances of nonrisky vehicular flight. See\nSwain v. State, 923 N.

Id., at 898, 901; see also id.,\nat 901, 902 (observing that the defendant had refused to\nstop “except on his own terms” and noting “the dangers\nthat could await a police officer stopping where the citizen\nselects”). These two cases fall well short of showing\nthat intentional flight in Indiana is ordinarily nonrisky.1\nSee also post, at 6 (KAGAN, J., dissenting) (noting that\nthe “intuition that dangerous flights outstrip mere failures\nto stop . . . seems consistent with common sense and\nexperience”).\n                              B\n   Sykes also notes that a different subparagraph, §3(b)\n(1)(B), covers intentional flight committed while “oper\nat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substan-\ntial risk of bodily injury to another person,” whereas\n§3(b)(1)(A) has no such element. From this, Sykes infers\nthat §3(b)(1)(A) necessarily concerns only flight that does\nnot present a serious potential risk. The argument is that,\neven though the elements of §3(b)(1)(A) describe conduct\nthat ordinarily will satisfy the requisite level of risk, the\npresence of §3(b)(1)(B) casts §3(b)(1)(A) in a less dangerous\nlight. Post, at 8 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). But the fact that\n§3(b)(1)(B) includes “substantial risk of bodily injury”\nas an element does not restrict §3(b)(1)(A) to nonrisky\n——————\n  1 Sykes certainly cannot use his own flight as an example.        His\n§3(b)(1)(A) conviction was based on fleeing from police in a damaged car\nat night without headlights, driving on the wrong side of the road,\nweaving through traffic, barreling through two yards and among\nbystanders, destroying a fence, and crashing into a house. Ante, at 4; 2\nApp. 11 (Sealed).\n10                   SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                 THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nconduct.\n   First, apart from the existence of §3(b)(1)(B), the ab\nsence of risk as an element of §3(b)(1)(A) does not mean\nthat the offense is not a violent felony. ACCA does not\nrequire that a violent felony expressly include a risk of\ninjury as an element of the offense. Enumerated violent\nfelonies like arson and burglary have no such element.\n   Second, §3(b)(1)(B) is not a risky, aggravated version\nof §3(b)(1)(A). Both are class D felonies, and at the time of\nSykes’ conviction, there was no statutory difference in\npunishment between them. Even now, the offenses re\nmain of a single class, meriting similar punishments.\n   The similarity in punishment for these related, overlap\nping offenses suggests that §3(b)(1)(A) is the rough equiva\nlent of one type of §3(b)(1)(B) violation. Section 3(b)(1)(B)\nenhances punishments for three separate types of in\ntentional misdemeanors: obstructing an officer, §3(a)(1);\ninterfering with service of process, §3(a)(2); and fleeing\nfrom a police officer, §3(a)(3). Under §3(b)(1)(B), commit\nting any of those offenses while also drawing a deadly\nweapon, inflicting injury, or “operat[ing] a vehicle in a\nmanner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to\nanother person” has long been a class D felony.\n   In 1998, the Indiana Legislature added §3(b)(1)(A) to\nprovide that any use of a vehicle to flee from an officer\nunder §3(a)(3) is always a class D felony.           Section\n3(b)(1)(A) is, in effect, a shortcut to the same punishment\nfor one particular violation of §3(b)(1)(B).2 It is still the\n——————\n  2 Indiana  law at the time of Sykes’ conviction presented two related\nprovisions, within a single statute, carrying the same punishment. One\nwas a broad provision that had risk as an element, and the other was a\nnarrower provision that did not. While JUSTICE KAGAN would infer that\nthe offense lacking risk as an element was likely not ordinarily risky,\npost, at 6–8, I think it makes more sense to infer the opposite.\n  Consider reckless endangerment statutes. In Hawaii, for instance, it\nis “reckless endangering in the second degree” either to “recklessly\n                      Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                      11\n\n                   THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\ncase that under §3(b)(1)(B), using a vehicle to obstruct an\nofficer or interfere with service of process is a class D\nfelony only if the vehicle is “operate[d] . . . in a manner\nthat creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another\nperson.” §3(b)(1)(B). But using a vehicle to intentionally\nflee is always a class D felony, without any need to prove\nrisk. §3(b)(1)(A).\n   This rough equivalence between §3(b)(1)(A) and §3(b)\n(1)(B) is borne out in Indiana case law. The conduct\nunderlying the Indiana cases discussed above, see supra,\nat 6–7, demonstrates that despite §3(b)(1)(B), convictions\nunder §3(b)(1)(A) include risky flights.\n   Third, the remainder of Indiana’s resisting law enforce\n\n——————\nplac[e] another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury,”\nHaw. Rev. Stat. §707–714(1)(a) (2009 Cum. Supp.), or to “[i]ntentionally\ndischarg[e] a firearm in a populated area,” §707–714(1)(b). I would\ninfer that discharging the firearm is deemed dangerous enough per se\nthat the statute does not require the State to prove danger in any given\ncase. Other States have similar statutes. See, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit.\n11, §§603(a)(1), (2) (2007); Wyo. Stat. Ann. §§6–2–504(a), (b) (2009); Me.\nRev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17–A, §§301(1)(B)(1), (2) (Supp. 2010).\n   Similarly here, I infer that §3(b)(1)(A)’s upgrade of intentional flight\nto a class D felony based on the use of a vehicle alone indicates that the\noffense inherently qualifies as, or approximates, “operat[ing] a vehicle\nin a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another\nperson” under §3(b)(1)(B).\n   JUSTICE KAGAN argues that if my reading were correct, the Indiana\nLegislature would have removed the reference to vehicular flight from\n§3(b)(1)(B) when it added §3(b)(1)(A). Post, at 12. There are at least\ntwo problems with this reasoning. First, even though §3(b)(1)(A) may\nbe redundant with §3(b)(1)(B) as to the vehicular flight offenses in\nsubsection (a)(3), the reference to “operat[ing] a vehicle” in §3(b)(1)(B) is\nstill independently useful for the offenses in subsections (a)(1) and (2).\nThus, it is hardly strange for the legislature to have left the reference\nto “operat[ing] a vehicle” in §3(b)(1)(B). Second, although JUSTICE\nKAGAN can envision a more perfectly drafted statute, we do not require\nperfection in statutory drafting. See, e.g., Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC,\n562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12). I think it clear enough what\nthe statute means.\n12                    SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nment statute confirms that its other provisions do not\nreserve §3(b)(1)(A) for nonrisky conduct. An intentional\nvehicular flight becomes a class C felony if the vehicle is\noperated “in a manner that causes serious bodily injury.”\nInd. Code §35–44–3–3(b)(2). The same act becomes a class\nB felony if someone is killed. §35–44–3–3(b)(3).3 JUSTICE\nKAGAN asserts that each of these “separate, escalating\ncrimes” captures an increasing degree of risk and neces\nsarily means that §3(b)(1)(A), the offense simpliciter, is\nless risky than it otherwise seems. Post, at 7.\n   The flaw in this reasoning is that §§3(b)(2) and (3) en\nhance punishment based solely on the results of the flight,\nnot the degree of risk it posed. Neither provision requires\nany action by a suspect beyond that which satisfies the\nelements of §3(b)(1)(A).4 Rather, each provision addresses\nwhat happens when the risk inherent in a violation of\n§3(b)(1)(A) is actualized and someone is hurt or killed.\nThe risk of physical injury inherent in intentional vehicu\nlar flight simpliciter was apparently clear enough to spur\nthe Indiana Legislature to specify greater penalties for the\ninevitable occasions when physical injury actually occurs.\nBy comparison, for obviously nonrisky felonies like insur\nance fraud or misappropriation of escrow funds, legisla\ntures do not specify what additional punishment is war\nranted when the crime kills or injures bystanders or\npolice. See, e.g., Ind. Code §35–43–5–7.2; §35–43–9–7. In\nsum, §§3(b)(2) and (3) do not demonstrate that §3(b)(1)(A)\nis less risky than it otherwise seems, but instead support\nthe idea that it is inherently risky.\n——————\n  3 Indiana recently added that if a police officer dies, it becomes a class\n\nA felony. 2010 Ind. Acts p. 1197.\n  4 For that matter, each provision also could be satisfied by a flight\n\nthat did not satisfy §3(b)(1)(B), which casts further doubt on JUSTICE\nKAGAN’s vision of the statutory scheme as a unified structure of neatly\nprogressing offenses with corresponding risk levels and punishments.\nSee post, at 7.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

More specifically, it is an at\ntempt to clarify, for the fourth time since 2007, what\ndistinguishes “violent felonies” under the residual clause\nof the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C.\n§924(e)(2)(B)(ii), from other crimes. See James v. United\nStates, 550 U. S. 192 (2007); Begay v. United States, 553\nU. S. 137 (2008); Chambers v. United States, 555 U. S. 122\n(2009). We try to include an ACCA residual-clause case in\nabout every second or third volume of the United States\nReports.\n   As was perhaps predictable, instead of producing a clar\nification of the Delphic residual clause, today’s opinion\nproduces a fourth ad hoc judgment that will sow further\nconfusion. Insanity, it has been said, is doing the same\nthing over and over again, but expecting different results.\nFour times is enough. We should admit that ACCA’s\nresidual provision is a drafting failure and declare it void\nfor vagueness. See Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 357\n(1983).\n                                I\n  ACCA defines “violent felony,” in relevant part, as “any\ncrime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding\none year . . . that . . . is burglary, arson, or extortion, in\n2                 SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nvolves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct\nthat presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\nanother.” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Many years of\nprison hinge on whether a crime falls within this defini\ntion. A felon convicted of possessing a firearm who has\nthree prior violent-felony convictions faces a 15-year man\ndatory minimum sentence and the possibility of life im\nprisonment. See §924(e)(1); see United States v. Harrison,\n558 F. 3d 1280, 1282, n. 1 (CA11 2009). Without those\nprior convictions, he would face a much lesser sentence,\nwhich could not possibly exceed 10 years. See §924(a)(2).\n   Vehicular flight is a violent felony only if it falls within\nACCA’s residual clause; that is, if it “involves conduct\nthat presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\nanother.” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Today’s opinion says, or ini\ntially seems to say, that an offense qualifies as a violent\nfelony if its elements, in the typical case, create a degree\nof risk “ ‘comparable to that posed by its closest analog\namong the enumerated offenses.’ ” Ante, at 6. That is a\nquotation from the Court’s opinion in the first of our\nresidual-clause trilogy, James, 550 U. S., at 203. I did not\njoin that opinion because I thought it should suffice if the\nelements created a degree of risk comparable to the least\nrisky of the enumerated offenses, whether or not it was\nthe closest analog. See id., at 230 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\nThe problem with applying the James standard to the pres\nent case is that the elements of vehicular flight under\nIndiana law are not analogous to any of the four enumer\nated offenses. See Ind. Code §35–44–3–3 (2004). Nor is it\napparent which of the enumerated offenses most closely\nresembles, for example, statutory rape, see United States\nv. Daye, 571 F. 3d 225, 228–236 (CA2 2009); possession of\na sawed-off shotgun, see United States v. Upton, 512 F. 3d\n394, 403–405 (CA7 2008); or a failure to report to prison,\nsee Chambers, supra. I predicted this inadequacy of the\n“closest analog” test in my James dissent. See 550 U. S.,\n                   Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                 3\n\n                       SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nat 215.\n   But as it turns out, the Court’s inability to identify an\nanalog makes no difference to the outcome of the present\ncase. For today’s opinion introduces the James standard\nwith the words “[f]or instance,” ante, at 6. It is (according\nto the Court) merely one example of how the enumerated\ncrimes (burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes using explo\nsives) “provide guidance.” Ibid. And the opinion then\nproceeds to obtain guidance from the risky-as-the-least\nrisky test that I suggested (but the Court rejected) in\nJames—finding vehicular flight at least as risky as both\narson and burglary. See ante, at 6–9.\n   But what about the test that determined the outcome in\nour second case in this “series”—the “purposeful, violent,\nand aggressive” test of Begay? Fear not. That incompati\nble variation has been neither overlooked nor renounced in\ntoday’s tutti-frutti opinion. “In many cases,” we are told,\nit “will be redundant with the inquiry into risk.” Ante, at\n11. That seems to be the case here—though why, and\nwhen it will not be the case, are not entirely clear. The\nCourt’s accusation that Sykes “overreads the opinions of\nthis Court,” ante, at 10, apparently applies to his interpre\ntation of Begay’s “purposeful, violent, and aggressive” test,\nwhich the Court now suggests applies only “to strict liabil\nity, negligence, and recklessness crimes,” ante, at 11. But\nthat makes no sense. If the test excluded only those unin\ntentional crimes, it would be recast as the “purposeful”\ntest, since the last two adjectives (“violent, and aggres\nsive”) would do no work. For that reason, perhaps, all 11\nCircuits that have addressed Begay “overrea[d]” it just as\nSykes does*—and as does the Government, see Brief for\n——————\n  * See United States v.

S. 122—which\napplied both the risky-as-the-least-risky test and the “pur\nposeful, violent, and aggressive” test to reach the con\nclusion that failure to report for periodic incarceration\nwas not a crime of violence under ACCA. But today’s\nopinion does cite Chambers for another point: Whereas\nJames rejected the risky-as-the-least-risky approach be\ncause, among other reasons, no “hard statistics” on risk\niness “have been called to our attention,” 550 U. S., at\n210; and whereas Begay made no mention of statistics;\nChambers explained (as today’s opinion points out) that\n“statistical evidence sometimes ‘helps provide a conclusive\n. . . answer’ concerning the risks that crimes present,”\nante, at 8 (quoting Chambers, supra, at 129). Today’s\nopinion then outdoes Chambers in the volume of statistics\nthat it spews forth—statistics compiled by the Interna\ntional Association of Chiefs of Police concerning injuries\nattributable to police pursuits, ante, at 8; statistics from\nthe Department of Justice concerning injuries attributable\nto burglaries, ante, at 9; statistics from the U.

We normally give parties\nmore robust protection, leaving important factual ques\ntions to district courts and juries aided by expert wit\nnesses and the procedural protections of discovery. See\nFed. Rule Crim. Proc. 16(a)(1)(F), (G); Fed. Rules Evid.\n702–703, 705. An adversarial process in the trial courts\ncan identify flaws in the methodology of the studies that\nthe parties put forward; here, we accept the studies’ find\nings on faith, without examining their methodology at all.\nThe Court does not examine, for example, whether the\npolice-pursuit data on which it relies is a representative\nsample of all vehicular flights. The data may be skewed\ntowards the rare and riskier forms of flight. See post, at 6,\nn. 4 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). We also have no way of\nknowing how many injuries reported in that data would\nhave occurred even absent pursuit, by a driver who was\ndriving recklessly even before the police gave chase.\nSimilar questions undermine confidence in the burglary\nand arson data the Court cites. For example, the Court\nrelies on a U. S. Fire Administration dataset to conclude\nthat 3.3 injuries occur per 100 arsons. See ante, at 9. But\na 2001 report from the same U. S. Fire Administration\nsuggests that roughly 1 injury occurs per 100 arsons. See\nArson in the United States, Vol. 1 Topical Fire Research\nSeries, No. 8, pp. 1–2 (rev. Dec. 2001), online at\nhttp://www.usfa.dhs.gov/downloads/pdf/tfrs/v1i8-508.pdf\n(as visited May 27, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s\ncase file). The Court does not reveal why it chose one\ndataset over another. In sum, our statistical analysis in\nACCA cases is untested judicial factfinding masquerading\nas statutory interpretation. Most of the statistics on\nwhich the Court relies today come from government\nfunded studies, and did not make an appearance in this\nlitigation until the Government’s merits brief to this\nCourt. See Brief for Petitioner 17; see also Chambers,\n6                 SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsupra, at 128–129 (demonstrating that the same was true\nin that case).\n   But the more fundamental problem with the Court’s use\nof statistics is that, far from eliminating the vagueness\nof the residual clause, it increases the vagueness. Vague\nness, of course, must be measured ex ante—before the\nCourt gives definitive meaning to a statutory provision,\nnot after. Nothing is vague once the Court decrees pre\ncisely what it means. And is it seriously to be expected\nthat the average citizen would be familiar with the sundry\nstatistical studies showing (if they are to be believed) that\nthis-or-that crime is more likely to lead to physical injury\nthan what sundry statistical studies (if they are to be\nbelieved) show to be the case for burglary, arson, extor\ntion, or use of explosives? To ask the question is to answer\nit. A few words, then, about unconstitutional vagueness.\n                              II\n  When I dissented from the Court’s judgment in James, I\nsaid that the residual clause’s “shoddy draftsmanship” put\ncourts to a difficult choice:\n    “They can (1) apply the ACCA enhancement to virtu\n    ally all predicate offenses, . . . ; (2) apply it case by\n    case in its pristine abstraction, finding it applicable\n    whenever the particular sentencing judge (or the par\n    ticular reviewing panel) believes there is a ‘serious po\n    tential risk of physical injury to another’ (whatever\n    that means); (3) try to figure out a coherent way of in\n    terpreting the statute so that it applies in a relatively\n    predictable and administrable fashion to a smaller\n    subset of crimes; or (4) recognize the statute for the\n    drafting failure it is and hold it void for vagueness\n    . . . .” 550 U. S., at 229–230.\nMy dissent “tried to implement,” id., at 230, the third\noption; and the Court, I believed, had chosen the second.\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n“Today’s opinion,” I wrote, “permits an unintelligible crim\ninal statute to survive uncorrected, unguided, and unex\nplained.” Id., at 230–231.\n   My assessment has not been changed by the Court’s\nlater decisions in the ACCA “series.” Today’s opinion,\nwhich adds to the “closest analog” test (James) the “pur\nposeful, violent, and aggressive” test (Begay), and even the\nrisky-as-the-least-risky test that I had proposed as the\nexclusive criterion, has not made the statute’s applica\ntion clear and predictable. And all of them together—or\neven the risky-as-the-least-risky test alone, I am now\nconvinced—never will. The residual-clause series will be\nendless, and we will be doing ad hoc application of ACCA\nto the vast variety of state criminal offenses until the cows\ncome home.\n   That does not violate the Constitution. What does vio\nlate the Constitution is approving the enforcement of a\nsentencing statute that does not “give a person of ordinar\nily intelligence fair notice” of its reach, United States v.\nBatchelder, 442 U. S. 114, 123 (1979) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted), and that permits, indeed invites, arbi\ntrary enforcement, see Kolender, 461 U. S., at 357. The\nCourt’s ever-evolving interpretation of the residual clause\nwill keep defendants and judges guessing for years to\ncome. The reality is that the phrase “otherwise involves\nconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical\ninjury to another” does not clearly define the crimes that\nwill subject defendants to the greatly increased ACCA\npenalties. It is not the job of this Court to impose a clarity\nwhich the text itself does not honestly contain. And even\nif that were our job, the further reality is that we have by\nnow demonstrated our inability to accomplish the task.\n   We have, I recognize, upheld hopelessly vague criminal\nstatutes in the past—indeed, in the recent past. See, e.g.,\nSkilling v. United States, 561 U. S. ___ (2010). That is\nregrettable, see id., at ___ (SCALIA, J., concurring in part\n8                 SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nand concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1). What sets\nACCA apart from those statutes—and what confirms its\nincurable vagueness—is our repeated inability to craft a\nprincipled test out of the statutory text. We have demon-\nstrated by our opinions that the clause is too vague to\nyield “an intelligible principle,” ante, at 13, each attempt\nto ignore that reality producing a new regime that is less\npredictable and more arbitrary than the last. ACCA’s\nresidual clause fails to speak with the clarity that criminal\nproscriptions require. See United States v. L. Cohen Gro-\ncery Co., 255 U. S. 81, 89–90 (1921).\n   The Court believes that the residual clause cannot be\nunconstitutionally vague because other criminal prohibi-\ntions also refer to the degree of risk posed by a defendant’s\nconduct. See ante, at 14. Even apart from the fact that\nour opinions dealing with those statutes have not dis-\nplayed the confusion evident in our four ACCA efforts,\nthis is not the first time I have found the comparison\nunpersuasive:\n     “None of the provisions the Court cites . . . is similar\n    in the crucial relevant respect: None prefaces its judi-\n    cially-to-be-determined requirement of risk of physical\n    injury with the word ‘otherwise,’ preceded by four con-\n    fusing examples that have little in common with re-\n    spect to the supposedly defining characteristic. The\n    phrase ‘shades of red,’ standing alone, does not gener-\n    ate confusion or unpredictability; but the phrase ‘fire-\n    engine red, light pink, maroon, navy blue, or colors\n    that otherwise involve shades of red’ assuredly does\n    so.” James, 550 U. S., at 230, n. 7.\nOf course even if the cited statutes were comparable,\nrepetition of constitutional error does not produce consti-\ntutional truth.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

In the field of criminal law, at least, it is time to\ncall a halt. I do not think it would be a radical step—\nindeed, I think it would be highly responsible—to limit\nACCA to the named violent crimes. Congress can quickly\nadd what it wishes. Because the majority prefers to let\nvagueness reign, I respectfully dissent.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

A person may\nattempt to outrun police officers by driving recklessly and\nat high speed, in disregard of traffic laws and with disdain\nfor others’ safety. Or a person may fail to heed an officer’s\ncommand to pull over, but otherwise drive in a lawful\nmanner, perhaps just trying to find a better place to stop.\nIn Indiana, as in most States, both of these individuals are\nlawbreakers. But in Indiana, again as in most States, the\nlaw takes account of the differences between them, by\ndistinguishing simple from aggravated forms of vehicular\nflight. Unlike the Court, I would attend to these distinc\ntions when deciding which of Indiana’s several vehicular\nflight crimes count as “violent felon[ies]” under the Armed\nCareer Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B).\nBecause petitioner Marcus Sykes was convicted only of\nsimple vehicular flight, and not of any flight offense in\nvolving aggressive or dangerous activity, I would find that\nhe did not commit a “violent felony” under ACCA.\n                            I\n  As the Court relates, we must decide whether the crime\nof which Sykes was convicted falls within ACCA’s “resid\nual clause.” See ante, at 5–6.

United\nStates, 553 U. S. 137, 145 (2008).1 Because we use the\n“categorical approach,” we do not concern ourselves with\nSykes’s own conduct. See Taylor v. United States, 495\nU. S. 575, 602 (1990). Nor do we proceed by exploring\nwhether some platonic form of an offense—here, some\nabstract notion of vehicular flight—satisfies ACCA’s re\nsidual clause. We instead focus on the elements of the\nactual state statute at issue. Cf. Chambers v. United\nStates, 555 U. S. 122, 126–127 (2009) (breaking down an\nIllinois statute into discrete offenses to decide whether the\ncrime of conviction fit within the residual clause); James v.\nUnited States, 550 U. S. 192, 202 (2007) (examining how\nFlorida’s law defined attempted burglary to determine if\nthe residual clause included that offense). More particu\nlarly, we ask whether “the conduct encompassed by the\nelements” of that statute, “in the ordinary case” (not in\nevery conceivable case), involves the requisite danger and\nviolence. Id., at 208. By making this inquiry, we attempt\n——————\n   1 I understand the majority to retain the “purposeful, violent, and\n\naggressive” test, but to conclude that it is “redundant” in this case. See\nante, at 11. Like JUSTICE SCALIA, see ante, at 3 (dissenting opinion), I\nfind this conclusion puzzling. I do not think the majority could mean to\nlimit the test to “strict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes.”\nAnte, at 11 (majority opinion). As JUSTICE SCALIA notes, see ante, at 3,\nthat would be to eliminate the test’s focus on “violence” and “aggres\nsion.” And it would collide with Chambers v. United States, 555 U. S.\n122 (2009)—a decision the majority cites approvingly, see ante, at 8—\nwhich applied the test to an intentional crime. See 555 U. S., at 128\n(opinion of the Court), 130 (Appendix A to opinion of the Court) (hold\ning that “knowin[g] fail[ure] to report to a penal institution” does not\ninvolve “purposeful, violent, or aggressive conduct” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). So I assume this test will make a resurgence—that it\nwill be declared non-redundant—the next time the Court considers a\ncrime, whether intentional or not, that involves risk of injury but not\naggression or violence.\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)             3\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nto determine whether the crime involved is “characteristic\nof the armed career criminal”—or otherwise said, whether\nthe prohibited conduct is of a kind that “makes more likely\nthat an offender, later possessing a gun, will use that gun\ndeliberately to harm a victim.” Begay, 553 U. S., at 145 (in\nternal quotation marks omitted).\n   Under this approach, some vehicular flight offenses\nshould count as violent felonies under ACCA. Consider,\nfor example, a statute that makes it a crime to “willfully\nflee from a law enforcement officer by driving at high\nspeed or otherwise demonstrating reckless disregard for\nthe safety of others.” Such a statute, by its terms, encom\npasses conduct that ordinarily “presents a serious poten\ntial risk of physical injury to another.” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii).\nAnd the covered conduct qualifies as “purposeful, violent,\nand aggressive.” Id., at 145. When a motorist responds to\nan officer’s signal to stop by increasing his speed or taking\nreckless evasive action, he turns his car into a weapon and\nprovokes confrontation. In so doing, he engages in behav\nior “roughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk\nposed,” to that involved in ACCA’s enumerated offenses—\nthe sort of conduct, in other words, “typically committed\nby . . . ‘armed career criminals.’ ” Id., at 143, 146. Like the\nmajority, see ante, at 9–10, I therefore would classify\ncrimes of this type—call them aggravated vehicular flight\noffenses—as violent felonies under ACCA.\n   But a vehicular flight offense need not target aggressive\nand dangerous behavior. Imagine the converse of the\nstatute described above—a statute making it a crime to\n“willfully flee from a law enforcement officer without\ndriving at high speed or otherwise demonstrating reckless\ndisregard for the safety of others.” That hypothetical\nstatute addresses only simple vehicular flight: mere dis\nregard of a police officer’s directive to stop, devoid of addi\ntional conduct creating risk to others. This behavior—\noften called “failure to stop”—is illegal in most States\n4                     SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n(under a wide variety of statutory provisions). In Indiana,\nfor example, a driver who “know[s] that a police officer\nwishes to effectuate a traffic stop” may commit a felony if\nhe attempts to “choose the location of the stop,” rather\nthan pulling over immediately; it makes no difference that\nthe driver “did not speed or disobey any . . . traffic laws.”\nWoodward v. State, 770 N. E. 2d 897, 902 (Ind. App.\n2002).2 But a mere failure to stop does not usually “pre\nsen[t] a serious potential risk of physical injury to an\nother,” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii), any more than normal driving\ndoes. Nor is this conduct “violent . . . and aggressive.”\nBegay, 553 U. S., at 145; see Brief for United States 43\n(characterizing as “nonviolent” a flight from police that\ncomplies with “all traffic laws”). True, the offender is\nignoring a command he should obey. But nothing in his\nbehavior is affirmatively belligerent: It does not “show an\nincreased likelihood that [he] is the kind of person who\nmight deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.”\nBegay, 553 U. S., at 146.3 And so, under our precedents, a\nstatute criminalizing only simple vehicular flight would\nnot fall within ACCA’s residual clause. I do not under\n——————\n   2 The majority attempts to show that Woodward involved conduct\n\nmore risky and violent than a simple failure to stop. See ante, at 3; see\nalso ante, at 7 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). But the facts of\nthat case, like the facts of this one, are irrelevant. Under ACCA, all\nthat matters is the elements of the offense, and the Indiana Court of\nAppeals held in Woodward that a person who “merely fail[s] to stop” for\npolice, and does nothing more, commits a felony under state law. 770\nN. E. 2d, at 900–902.\n   3 Indeed, a driver may refrain from pulling over immediately out of\n\nconcern for his own safety. He may worry, for example, that road con\nditions make it hazardous to stop. Or a driver may fear that the\nperson initiating the stop is a criminal rather than a police officer. See,\ne.g., Brennan, Rapist to Spend Life in Prison, Tampa Tribune, Feb. 18,\n2011, Metro section, p. 3 (“[A man] impersonating a police officer . . .\nused the ruse to pull over a woman . . . and then kidnap and rape her”);\nDeKunder, Watch for “Fake” Police, Local Authorities Warn, Northeast\nHerald, Jan. 14, 2010, pp. 12, 13 (noting several similar incidents).\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nstand the majority to disagree.\n   The Indiana provision under which Sykes was convicted\nstraddles the two hypothetical statutes I have just de\nscribed. That provision, subsection (b)(1)(A), states that a\nperson commits a felony if he “flees from a law enforce\nment officer” while “us[ing] a vehicle.” Ind. Code §§35–44–\n3–3(a)(3), (b)(1)(A) (2009). As the Indiana courts have\nrecognized, the subsection thus criminalizes mere failure\nto stop, which should not count as a violent felony under\nACCA. See Woodward, 770 N. E. 2d 897; supra, at 4, and\nn. 2. But the provision also includes more violent forms of\nvehicular flight: It covers a person who speeds or drives\nrecklessly, who leads the police on a “Hollywood-style car\nchase,” Scott v. Harris, 550 U. S. 372, 380 (2007), and who\nendangers police officers, other drivers, and pedestrians.\nAnd so the “conduct encompassed by the elements” of\nthis subsection, James, 550 U. S., at 208, runs the gamut—\nfrom simple to aggravated vehicular flight, from the least\nviolent to the most violent form of the activity. Accord,\nante, at 9–10 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (stat\ning that subsection (b)(1)(A) is “not restrict[ed] . . . to\nnonrisky conduct”). The question presented is whether\nsuch a facially broad provision meets the requirements of\nACCA’s residual clause.\n   If subsection (b)(1)(A) were the whole of Indiana’s law\non vehicular flight, the majority would have a reasonable\nargument that the provision does so. As noted, a statute\nfits within the residual clause if it covers conduct that in\nthe ordinary case—not in every conceivable case—poses\nserious risk of physical injury and is purposeful, violent,\nand aggressive. See James, 550 U. S., at 208; Begay, 553\nU. S., at 145. We therefore must decide what the ordinary\ncase of vehicular flight actually is. Is it the person trying\nto escape from police by speeding or driving recklessly, in\na way that endangers others? Or is it instead the person\ndriving normally who, for whatever reason, fails to re\n6                     SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nspond immediately to a police officer’s signal? The Gov\nernment has not presented any empirical evidence ad\ndressing this question, and such evidence may not in fact\nexist.4 See Wells & Falcone, Research on Police Pursuits:\nAdvantages of Multiple Data Collection Strategies, 20\nPolicing Int’l J. Police Strategies & Management 729\n(1997) (“Collecting valid and reliable data on policing\nactivities is a perennial problem . . . . This is particularly\ntrue when studying . . . vehicle pursuits”); cf. Begay, 553\nU. S., at 154 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (“Need\nless to say, we do not have these relevant statistics”). But\nthe majority’s intuition that dangerous flights outstrip\nmere failures to stop—that the aggravated form of the\nactivity is also the ordinary form—seems consistent with\ncommon sense and experience. So that judgment, even\nthough unsupported by data, would likely be sufficient to\njustify the Court’s conclusion were subsection (b)(1)(A) the\nonly relevant provision.\n  But subsection (b)(1)(A) does not stand alone, and the\ncontext of the provision casts a different light on it. Like a\ngreat many States (45 by my count), Indiana divides the\n——————\n   4 The Government offers anecdotal examples and statistical surveys\n\nof vehicular flights, see Brief for United States 13–15, 17–22, but none\nhelps to answer whether the “ordinary” case of vehicular flight is\naggravated or simple. Cf. ante, at 4–6 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). The an\necdotes and all but one of the surveys demonstrate only that some\nvehicular flights result in serious injury, a proposition no one does or\ncould dispute. The single statistical study cited by the Government\nthat posits an injury rate for vehicular flight concludes that about 4% of\n7,737 reported police pursuits harmed police or bystanders. But that\nstudy may well involve only aggravated flights. See C. Lum & G.\nFachner, Police Pursuits in an Age of Innovation and Reform 55 (2008)\n(noting that the study relies on voluntary and non-systematic reporting\nand that participating police departments might not have reported\n“informal” incidents). And even assuming the study is comprehensive,\nit is entirely consistent with the possibility that the “ordinary case”—\ni.e., the most common form—of vehicular flight is mere failure to stop,\nwhich produces a much lower rate of injury.\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

At\nthe time of Sykes’s conviction, Indiana had four degrees\nof vehicular flight, only the first of which—subsection\n(b)(1)(A)—covered mere failure to stop.5 See Ind. Code\n§35–44–3–3. Indiana classified as a felon any person who:\n    •\t “flees from a law enforcement officer” while “us[ing]\n        a vehicle,” §3(b)(1)(A);\n    •\t “flees from a law enforcement officer” while “op\n        erat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a sub\n        stantial risk of bodily injury to another person,”\n        §3(b)(1)(B);6\n    •\t “flees from a law enforcement officer” while “op\n        erat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that causes serious\n        bodily injury to another person,” §3(b)(2); or\n    •\t “flees from a law enforcement officer” while “op\n        erat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that causes the\n        death of another person,” §3(b)(3) (all emphasis\n        added).\nVehicular flight in Indiana is therefore not a single of\nfense, but instead a series of separate, escalating crimes.\nEach category captures conduct more dangerous than the\none before it, as shown by the language italicized above.7\n——————\n   5 After Sykes’s conviction, Indiana added yet a fifth degree. See 2010\n\nInd. Acts p. 1197. The four degrees described above remain unchanged.\n   6 This provision also bars a range of other conduct. See n. 9, infra.\n   7 JUSTICE THOMAS attempts to bisect this series by stating that the\n\ntwo most serious degrees of aggravated vehicular flight “enhance\npunishment based solely on the results of the flight, not the degree of\nrisk it posed.” Ante, at 11–12. But conduct that leads to serious injury\nor death is ordinarily more risky, viewed ex ante, than conduct that\ndoes not produce these results. And in any event, the fundamental\npoint here is that the Indiana statute grades vehicular flight according\nto the seriousness of the behavior—ranging from flight that need not\npose any risk of harm, through flight posing a substantial risk of harm,\nto flight involving a certainty of harm. Subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3)\n8                     SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nAnd at the very beginning of this series is subsection\n(b)(1)(A), the offense of which Sykes was convicted.\n   That placement alters the nature of the analysis. We\nhave previously examined the way statutory provisions\nrelate to each other to determine whether a particular\nprovision counts as a violent felony under ACCA. In\nChambers, 555 U. S., at 126–127, we considered an Illinois\nstatute prohibiting within a single section several differ\nent kinds of behavior, including escape from a penal insti\ntution and failure to report to a penal institution. The\ncourts below had treated the statute as defining a single\ncrime of felonious escape and held that crime to qualify as\na violent felony under ACCA. See id., at 125; United\nStates v. Chambers, 473 F. 3d 724, 725–726 (CA7 2007).\nWe disagreed, stating that failure to report was a distinct\noffense, which did not meet ACCA’s requirements. That\nwas so, we stated, because “[t]he behavior that likely\nunderlies a failure to report would seem less likely to\ninvolve a risk of physical harm than the less passive, more\naggressive behavior underlying an escape from custody.”\nChambers, 555 U. S., at 127. In addition, we noted, the\nstatute “list[ed] escape and failure to report separately\n(in its title and its body).” Ibid. We thus considered\nthe failure-to-report clause in its statutory context—as\none part of a legislature’s delineation of related criminal\noffenses—to determine whether the behavior it encom\npassed ordinarily poses a serious risk of injury.\n   That same focus on statutory structure resolves this\ncase, because it reveals subsection (b)(1)(A) to aim at a\nsingle form—the least serious form—of vehicular flight.\nRemember: Indiana has made a purposeful choice to di\nvide the full spectrum of vehicular flight into different\n—————— \n\nthus underscore that Indiana has divided the world of vehicular flight\n\ninto discrete, ascending crimes, rather than treating all vehicular flight \n\nas of a piece. \n\n                    Cite as: 564 U.

Once again, starting with the most serious con\nduct: flight resulting in death; flight resulting in physical\ninjury; flight creating a substantial risk of physical in-\njury; flight. That last category—flight—almost screams to\nhave the word “mere” placed before it. Under the In\ndiana statute, flight—the conduct prohibited by subsection\n(b)(1)(A)—is what is left over when no aggravating factor\ncausing substantial risk or harm exists. Put on blinders,\nand the subsection is naturally understood to address all\nflight, up to and including the most dangerous kinds. But\ntake off those blinders—view the statute as a whole—and\nthe subsection is instead seen to target failures to stop.\n   In this vein, the distinction between subsections\n(b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) is especially telling. As noted,\nsubsection (b)(1)(B) prohibits vehicular flight that “creates\na substantial risk of bodily injury to another person.”\nThat language almost precisely tracks the phrasing of\nACCA’s residual clause, which refers to conduct that\n“presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\nanother.” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). This correspon\ndence indicates that the conduct criminalized under sub\nsection (b)(1)(B) qualifies as a violent felony under ACCA.\nBut subsection (b)(1)(A) lacks the very feature that makes\nsubsection (b)(1)(B) and ACCA such a perfect match: It\ndoes not require any behavior that poses serious risk to\nothers. This difference in statutory elements indicates\nthat subsection (b)(1)(B)—but not subsection (b)(1)(A)—is\ndirected toward the conduct described in ACCA’s residual\nclause. To count both as ACCA offenses is to pay insuffi\ncient heed to the way the Indiana Legislature drafted its\nstatute—as a series of escalating offenses, ranging from\nthe simple to the most aggravated.8\n——————\n  8 None of this is to deny that prosecutors may sometimes charge vio\n\nlent and dangerous offenders under subsection (b)(1)(A). A prosecutor\n10                    SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\n                             II \n\n   The Court does not deny that a State’s decision to divide\na generic form of conduct (like vehicular flight) into sep\narate, escalating crimes may make a difference under\nACCA; rather, the Court declines to address that question.\nSee ante, at 13. The Court rejects the structural argument\nhere for one, and only one, reason. Indiana, the major-\nity says, “treats violations of subsections (b)(1)(A) and\n(b)(1)(B) as crimes of the same magnitude”: They are both\nclass D felonies carrying the same punishment.9 See also\n——————\nmay elect to use a lower grade of vehicular flight when he could use a\nhigher one, either as a matter of discretion or because the defendant\nentered into a plea bargain. This case provides one example, see ante,\nat 4 (majority opinion), and JUSTICE THOMAS offers several others, see\nante, at 6–7. But as everyone agrees, what matters in determining\nwhether an offense qualifies under ACCA’s residual clause is the\n“ordinary case” of conviction. And in the absence of reliable empirical\nevidence, the structure of the Indiana statute provides the best way to\ndiscern the ordinary case under each subsection.\n   9 The Government spurns the structural argument on a different\n\nground, contending that subsection (b)(1)(A) is not a lesser included\noffense of subsection (b)(1)(B). The Court wisely does not accept this\nclaim. Both subsections (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) involve the use of a\nvehicle to flee, with subsection (b)(1)(B) additionally requiring that this\nuse “creat[e] a substantial risk of bodily injury.” So a fleeing driver\nwho violates subsection (b)(1)(B) necessarily runs afoul of subsection\n(b)(1)(A) as well. The Government contends, in response, that a person\ncan violate subsection (b)(1)(B) and not (b)(1)(A) by engaging in conduct\nother than vehicular flight. See Brief for United States 48–49, n. 11.\nThat is because subsection (b)(1)(B) additionally prohibits “obstruct\n[ing]” or “resist[ing]” a police officer by a variety of means, including\nthrough use of a vehicle. But Indiana law makes clear that subsec\ntion (b)(1)(A) still counts as a lesser included offense of subsection\n(b)(1)(B) in any prosecution involving vehicular flight. See Wright v.\nState, 658 N. E. 2d 563, 566–567 (Ind. 1995) (holding a crime to be a\nlesser included offense if its elements are “factually” subsumed within\nanother offense). And even if that were not the case, it should make no\ndifference. The meaningful question for purposes of ACCA is whether\nsubsection (b)(1)(B)’s prohibition of aggravated vehicular flight indi\ncates that subsection (b)(1)(A) targets simple vehicular flight.

But\nthe Court is wrong to think that fact dispositive.\n   In general, “similar punishment does not necessarily\nimply similar risk” (or similar violence). James, 550 U. S.,\nat 217 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Because this is so, the\nCourt has never suggested that all state offenses falling\nwithin a single felony class and subject to the same penal\nties must receive the same treatment under ACCA. To the\ncontrary, we have always focused on the “conduct encom\npassed by the elements of the offense,” id., at 208 (major\nity opinion)—an inquiry that does not mention the of\nfense’s sentencing consequences. And that is for good\nreason. It would be quite remarkable if either all or none\nof Indiana’s (or any State’s) class D felonies satisfied the\nrequirements of the residual clause. In Indiana, other\nsuch felonies, subject to “the same magnitude” of punish\nment, ante, at 12, include election fraud, computer tam\npering, and “cemetery mischief.” See Ind. Code §3–14–2–1\net seq. (2009); §35–43–1–4; §35–43–1–2.1. I presume the\nCourt does not also intend to treat these offenses as vio\nlent felonies under ACCA.\n   Moreover, Indiana sentencing law has always enabled\njudges to take account of the difference between subsec\ntions (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) in imposing punishment. As\nthe majority notes, ante, at 12, Indiana provides for a\nrange of prison terms for class D felonies, stretching\nfrom six months to three years. And in deciding what\nterm to impose (or whether to suspend the term), courts\nmay consider an array of aggravating factors—including\nwhether the crime “threatened serious harm to per-\nsons,” §35–38–1–7.1(b)(1). Convictions under subsections\n(b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) therefore may produce widely vary\ning sentences, as judges respond to the different forms\n—————— \n\nperson can violate subsection (b)(1)(B) by means independent of any\n\nvehicular flight has no bearing on that question. \n\n12                  SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n of vehicular flight targeted by the offenses.\n   The Court argues, in support of its position, that the\n“similarity in punishment” reveals that the conduct falling\nwithin subsection (b)(1)(A) is “rough[ly] equivalent,” in\nterms of risk, to the conduct falling within subsection\n(b)(1)(B). Ante, at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted);\nsee also ante, at 10–11 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judg\nment). More specifically, the Court claims that the Indi\nana Legislature added subsection (b)(1)(A) to the statute\nin 1998 because it determined that vehicular flight is per\nse risky—and that all such flight therefore deserves the\nsame punishment as is meted out to the various non-flight\nconduct that subsection (b)(1)(B) prohibits upon a showing\nof risk. See ante, at 12; see also n. 9, supra. But that\nargument disregards the legislature’s decision to criminal\nize vehicular flight in both provisions—that is, to retain\nsubsection (b)(1)(B)’s prohibition on risky vehicular flight\nalongside subsection (b)(1)(A)’s ban on simple flight. In\neffect, the Court reads subsection (b)(1)(A) as including all\nvehicular flight and subsection (b)(1)(B) as including only\nthe other (non-flight) things it mentions—even though\nsubsection (b)(1)(B) specifically bars “flee[ing] from a law\nenforcement officer . . . in a manner that creates a sub\nstantial risk of bodily injury.”\n   Perhaps the Court assumes that the Indiana Legisla\nture, in enacting subsection (b)(1)(A), simply forgot to\nremove the reference to vehicular flight in subsection\n(b)(1)(B). Cf. ante, at 10 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judg\nment) (acknowledging superfluity). But if so, the legis\nlature forgot four more times to correct its error, as it\nserially amended and re-amended its vehicular-flight stat-\nute over the last 13 years.10 And more fundamentally, a\n——————\n  10 See 2011 Ind. Acts pp. 91–92; 2010 Ind. Acts pp. 1196–1197, 1186–\n\n1187; 2006 Ind. Acts p. 2470. Notably, one of these amendments\nrevised subsection (b)(1)(B) itself.

See 1998 Ind. Acts\n677–678. So Indiana’s decision to create that offense in\nsubsection (b)(1)(A)—and to distinguish it from the more\naggravated forms of vehicular flight already penalized\nunder subsections (b)(1)(B), (b)(2), and (b)(3)—brought\nthe State’s vehicular-flight statute into conformity with\nthe prevailing approach used nationwide. Especially given\nthat backdrop, I would not impute shoddy draftsmanship\nto the Indiana Legislature. I would heed what that body\nsaid, rather than assume (just because it made both of\nfenses class D felonies) that it must have meant something\ndifferent. And what the legislature said is that vehicular\nflight comes in different forms—one posing substantial\nrisk of injury (subsection (b)(1)(B)) and one not (subsection\n(b)(1)(A)).\n   The best that can be said for the Court’s approach is\nthat it is very narrow—indeed, that it decides almost no\ncase other than this one. As noted above, see supra, at 10,\nthe Court reserves the question whether a vehicular flight\nprovision like subsection (b)(1)(A) is a crime of violence\nunder ACCA “where that offense carries a less severe\npenalty than [a greater] offense that includes it.” Ante, at\n13. But as fate would have it, that reservation describes\nthe great majority of vehicular flight statutes across the\ncountry. Indiana is idiosyncratic in this respect; other\nStates not only separately prohibit, but also differently\npunish, simple and aggravated vehicular flight.11 Or\n——————\n  11 See, e.g., Fla. Stat. §316.1935 (2010); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann.\n\n§257.602a (West 2010); Minn. Stat. §609.487 (2009); N. J. Stat. Ann.\n§2C:29–2 (West Supp. 2011); S. C. Code Ann. §56–5–750 (2006); Tenn.\n14                SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nperhaps I should say Indiana was idiosyncratic. That is\nbecause in 2006, a few years after Sykes’s conviction,\nIndiana amended its vehicular flight statute to set differ\nent penalties for violations of subsections (b)(1)(A) and\n(b)(1)(B). A person who violates subsection (b)(1)(B) today\nfaces a mandatory 30-day sentence that cannot be sus\npended; that sentence rises to six months or one year\nfor repeat offenders. See Ind. Code §35–44–3–3(d). By\ncontrast, a person who violates subsection (b)(1)(A), even\nmore than once, is not subject to any mandatory jail time.\nSee §35–44–3–3(d). So by its own terms, the Court’s\nopinion—our fourth applying ACCA’s residual clause in as\nmany years—applies only to a single State’s vehicular\nflight statute as it existed from 1998 to 2006. Cf. ante, at\n7 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“[W]e will be doing ad hoc appli\ncation of ACCA . . . until the cows come home”).\n                         *     *     *\n   The Indiana statute before us creates a series of escalat\ning offenses dividing the universe of vehicular flight into\ndiscrete categories. One of those categories, subsection\n(b)(1)(B), requires proof that the defendant operated “a\nvehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of\nbodily injury.” That phrase tracks the language that\nACCA’s residual clause uses to define a crime of violence.\nOther provisions in the Indiana statute demand even\nmore—actual injury or death. In stark contrast, subsec\ntion (b)(1)(A), the least severe of the State’s vehicular\nflight offenses and the one of which Sykes was convicted,\nlacks any element relating to threat of physical injury. In\ndeciding this case, I would respect that statutory differ\nence. And because I would take the Indiana Legislature\nat its word, I respectfully dissent.\n\n——————\nCode Ann. §39–16–603 (Supp. 2011); Tex.

Argued January 12, 2011—Decided June 9, 2011\nWhen he pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, see 8\n U. S. C. §922(g)(1), petitioner Sykes had prior convictions for at least\n three felonies, including the state-law crime of “us[ing] a vehicle” to\n “knowingly or intentionally” “fle[e] from a law enforcement officer”\n after being ordered to stop, Ind. Code §35–44–3–3(b)(1)(A) (2004).\n The Federal District Court decided that the prior convictions sub\n jected Sykes to the 15-year mandatory minimum prison term that the\n Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. §924(e), provides for\n an armed defendant who has three prior “violent felony” convictions.\n Rejecting Sykes’ argument that his vehicle flight felony was not “vio\n lent” under ACCA, the Seventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Felony vehicle flight, as proscribed by Indiana law, is a violent\n felony for purposes of ACCA. Pp. 5–14.\n    (a) The “categorical approach” used to determine if a particular\n crime is a violent felony “consider[s] whether the elements of the of\n fense are of the type that would justify its inclusion within the resid\n ual provision [of 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)], without inquiring into the\n specific conduct of th[e] particular offender.” James v. United States,\n 550 U. S. 192, 202 (emphasis deleted). When punishable by more\n than one year in prison, burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes that\n involve use of explosives are violet felonies. Under the residual\n clause in question so too is a crime that “otherwise involves conduct\n that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,”\n §924(e)(2)(B)(ii), i.e., a risk “comparable to that posed by its closest\n analog among” the statute’s enumerated offenses. Id., at 203. When\n a perpetrator flees police in a car, his determination to elude capture\n makes a lack of concern for the safety of others an inherent part of\n the offense. Even if he drives without going full speed or the wrong\n2                       SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    way, he creates the possibility that police will, in a legitimate and\n    lawful manner, exceed or almost match his speed or use force to bring\n    him within their custody. His indifference to these collateral conse\n    quences has violent—even lethal—potential for others. A fleeing\n    criminal who creates a risk of this dimension takes action similar in\n    degree of danger to that involved in arson, which also entails inten\n    tional release of a destructive force dangerous to others. Also telling\n    is a comparison to burglary, which is dangerous because it can end in\n    confrontation leading to violence. In fact, the risks associated with\n    vehicle flight may outstrip the dangers of both burglary and arson.\n    While statistics are not dispositive, studies show that the risk of per\n    sonal injuries is about 20% lower for each of those enumerated crimes\n    than for vehicle pursuits. Thus, Indiana’s prohibition on vehicle\n    flight falls within §924(e)(2)(B)(ii)’s residual clause because, as a\n    categorical matter, it presents a serious potential risk of physical in\n    jury to another. Pp. 5–9.\n       (b) Sykes’ argument—that Begay v. United States, 553 U. S. 137,\n    and Chambers v. United States, 555 U. S. 122, require ACCA predi\n    cate crimes to be purposeful, violent, and aggressive in ways that ve\n    hicle flight is not—overreads those opinions. In general, levels of risk\n    divide crimes that qualify as violent felonies from those that do not.\n    Chambers is no exception: It explained that failure to report does not\n    qualify because the typical offender is not “significantly more likely\n    than others to attack, or physically to resist, an apprehender.” 555\n    U. S., at ___–___. Begay, which held that driving under the influence\n    (DUI) is not an ACCA predicate and stated that it is not purposeful,\n    violent, and aggressive, 553 U. S., at 145–148, is the Court’s sole re\n    sidual clause decision in which risk was not the dispositive factor.\n    But Begay also gave a more specific reason for its holding: DUI “need\n    not be purposeful or deliberate,” id., at 145, and is analogous to\n    strict-liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes. Begay’s “pur\n    poseful, violent, and aggressive” phrase is an addition to the statu\n    tory text that has no precise link to the residual clause. Because ve\n    hicle flight is not a strict-liability, negligence, or recklessness crime\n    and is, as a categorical matter, similar in risk to the crimes listed in\n    the residual clause, it is a violent felony. Pp. 10–11\n       (c) Sykes contends that the fact that Ind. Code §35–44–3–3(b)(1)(B)\n    criminalizes flight by an offender who “operates a vehicle in a man\n    ner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person”\n    indicates that Indiana did not intend for §35–44–3–3(b)(1)(A), under\n    which he was convicted, to encompass the particular class of vehicle\n    flights reached by subsection (b)(1)(B). This argument is unconvinc\n    ing. Indiana treats the two subsections as felonies of the same mag\n    nitude carrying similar prison terms, suggesting that subsection\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  (b)(1)(A) is roughly equivalent to one type of subsection (b)(1)(B) vio\n  lation. Pp. 11–13.\n    (d) Congress framed ACCA in general and qualitative, rather than\n  encyclopedic, terms. The residual clause imposes enhanced punish\n  ment for unlawful firearm possession when the relevant prior of\n  fenses involved a potential risk of physical injury similar to that pre\n  sented by several enumerated offenses.          It instructs potential\n  recidivists regarding the applicable sentencing regime if they again\n  transgress. This intelligible principle provides guidance, allowing a\n  person to conform his conduct to the law. While this approach may at\n  times be more difficult for courts to implement, it is within congres\n  sional power to enact.

S. 122 (2009).\n   In this case the previous conviction in question is under\nan Indiana statute that makes it a criminal offense when\never the driver of a vehicle knowingly or intentionally\n“flees from a law enforcement officer.” Ind. Code §35–44–\n3–3 (2004). The relevant text of the statute is set out\nin the discussion below. For the reasons explained, the\nvehicle flight that the statute proscribes is a violent felony\n2                 SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nas the federal statute uses that term.\n                               I\n   Petitioner Marcus Sykes pleaded guilty to being a felon\nin possession of a firearm, 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(1), in con\nnection with an attempted robbery of two people at gun\npoint. Sykes had previous convictions for at least three\nfelonies. On two separate occasions Sykes used a firearm\nto commit robbery, in one case to rob a man of his $200\nwristwatch and in another to rob a woman of her purse.\n   His third prior felony is the one of concern here. Sykes\nwas convicted for vehicle flight, in violation of Indiana’s\n“resisting law enforcement” law. Ind. Code §35–44–3–3.\nThat law provides:\n       “(a) A person who knowingly or intentionally:\n       “(1) forcibly resists, obstructs, or interferes with a\n    law enforcement officer or a person assisting the offi\n    cer while the officer is lawfully engaged in the execu\n    tion of his duties as an officer;\n       “(2) forcibly resists, obstructs, or interferes with the\n    authorized service or execution of a civil or criminal\n    process or order of a court; or\n       “(3) flees from a law enforcement officer after the of\n    ficer has, by visible or audible means, identified him\n    self and ordered the person to stop;\n    “commits resisting law enforcement, a Class A mis\n    demeanor, except as provided in subsection (b).\n       “(b) The offense under subsection (a) is a:\n       “(1) Class D felony if:\n       “(A) the offense is described in subsection (a)(3) and\n    the person uses a vehicle to commit the offense; or\n       “(B) while committing any offense described in sub\n    section (a), the person draws or uses a deadly weapon,\n    inflicts bodily injury on another person, or operates a\n    vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of\n    bodily injury to another person;\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n      (2) Class C felony if, while committing any offense\n    described in subsection (a), the person operates a ve\n    hicle in a manner that causes serious bodily injury to\n    another person; and\n      (3) Class B felony if, while committing any offense\n    described in subsection (a), the person operates a ve\n    hicle in a manner that causes the death of another\n    person.”\n  Here, as will be further explained, Sykes used a vehicle\nto flee after an officer ordered him to stop, which was, as\nthe statute provides, a class D felony. The Court of Ap\npeals of Indiana has interpreted the crime of vehicle flight\nto require “a knowing attempt to escape law enforcement.”\nWoodward v. State, 770 N. E. 2d 897, 901 (2002) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Woodward involved a driver\nwho repeatedly flashed his bright lights and failed to obey\ntraffic signals. Id., at 898. When an officer activated his\nemergency equipment, the defendant became “aware . . .\nthat [the officer] wanted him to pull his vehicle over,” but\ninstead drove for a mile without “stopping, slowing, or\notherwise acknowledging” the officer because, he later\ntestified, he “was ‘trying to rationalize why [he] would be\npulled over.’ ” Id., at 898, 901. Though the defendant later\nclaimed that he was also seeking a “well-lighted place to\nstop where there would be someone who knew him,” id.,\nat 901, his actions suggested otherwise. He passed two\ngas stations, a food outlet store, and a McDonald’s be-\nfore pulling over. When he got out of the car, he began to\nshout profanities at the pursuing officer. Ibid. By that\ntime, the officer had called for backup and exited his own\nvehicle with his gun drawn. Id., at 898. In answering the\ndefendant’s challenge to the sufficiency of the above evi\ndence, the Indiana court held that because he knew that a\npolice officer sought to stop him, the defendant could not\n“choose the location of the stop” and insist on completing\n4                 SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe stop “on his own terms,” as he had done, “without\nadequate justification,” which he lacked. Id., at 901–902.\n   In the instant case a report prepared for Sykes’ federal\nsentencing describes the details of the Indiana crime.\nAfter observing Sykes driving without using needed head\nlights, police activated their emergency equipment for a\ntraffic stop. Sykes did not stop. A chase ensued. Sykes\nwove through traffic, drove on the wrong side of the road\nand through yards containing bystanders, passed through\na fence, and struck the rear of a house. Then he fled on\nfoot. He was found only with the aid of a police dog.\n   The District Court decided that his three prior convic\ntions, including the one for violating the prohibition on\nvehicle flight in subsection (b)(1)(A) of the Indiana statute\njust discussed, were violent felonies for purposes of §924(e)\nand sentenced Sykes to 188 months of imprisonment. On\nappeal Sykes conceded that his two prior robbery con\nvictions were violent felonies. He did not dispute that his\nvehicle flight offense was a felony, but he did argue that it\nwas not violent. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh\nCircuit affirmed. 598 F. 3d 334 (2010). The court’s opin\nion was consistent with the rulings of the Courts of Ap\npeals in the First, Fifth, Sixth, and Tenth Circuits. Powell\nv. United States, 430 F. 3d 490 (CA1 2005) (per curiam);\nUnited States v. Harrimon, 568 F. 3d 531, 534–537 (CA5\n2009); United States v. LaCasse, 567 F. 3d 763, 765–767\n(CA6 2009); United States v. McConnell, 605 F. 3d 822,\n827–830 (CA10 2010) (finding the flight to be a “crime of\nviolence” under the “nearly identical” §4B1.2(a)(2) of the\nUnited States Sentencing Guidelines). It was in conflict\nwith a ruling by a Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Cir\ncuit in United States v. Harrison, 558 F. 3d 1280, 1291–\n1296 (2009), and at least in tension, if not in conflict, with\nthe reasoning of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Cir\ncuit in United States v.

Peter\nson, No. 07–30465, 2009 WL 3437834, *1 (Oct. 27, 2009).\nThe writ of certiorari, 561 U. S. ___ (2010), allows this\nCourt to address the conflict.\n                          II\n  In determining whether an offense is a violent felony,\nthis Court has explained,\n    “we employ the categorical approach . . . . Under this\n    approach, we look only to the fact of conviction and\n    the statutory definition of the prior offense, and do not\n    generally consider the particular facts disclosed by the\n    record of conviction. That is, we consider whether the\n    elements of the offense are of the type that would\n    justify its inclusion within the residual provision,\n    without inquiring into the specific conduct of this par\n    ticular offender.” James, 550 U. S., at 202 (internal\n    quotation marks and citations omitted); see also Tay\n    lor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 599–602 (1990).\nSo while there may be little doubt that the circumstances\nof the flight in Sykes’ own case were violent, the question\nis whether §35–44–3–3 of the Indiana Code, as a categori\ncal matter, is a violent felony.\n   Under 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B), an offense is deemed a\nviolent felony if it is a crime punishable by more than one\nyear of imprisonment that\n      “(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or\n    threatened use of physical force against the person of\n    another; or\n      “(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of\n    explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that pre\n    sents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\n    another.”\nResisting law enforcement through felonious vehicle flight\n6                 SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndoes not meet the requirements of clause (i), and it is not\namong the specific offenses named in clause (ii). Thus, it\nis violent under this statutory scheme only if it fits within\nthe so-called residual provision of clause (ii). To be a vio\nlent crime, it must be an offense that “otherwise in-\nvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of\nphysical injury to another.”\n   The question, then, is whether Indiana’s prohibition on\nflight from an officer by driving a vehicle—the violation of\nIndiana law for which Sykes sustained his earlier convic\ntion—falls within the residual clause because, as a cate\ngorical matter, it presents a serious potential risk of\nphysical injury to another. The offenses enumerated in\n§924(e)(2)(B)(ii)—burglary, extortion, arson, and crimes\ninvolving use of explosives—provide guidance in making\nthis determination. For instance, a crime involves the\nrequisite risk when “the risk posed by [the crime in ques\ntion] is comparable to that posed by its closest analog\namong the enumerated offenses.” James, 550 U. S., at 203\n(explaining that attempted burglary poses risks akin to\nthat of completed burglary).\n   When a perpetrator defies a law enforcement command\nby fleeing in a car, the determination to elude capture\nmakes a lack of concern for the safety of property and\npersons of pedestrians and other drivers an inherent part\nof the offense. Even if the criminal attempting to elude\ncapture drives without going at full speed or going the\nwrong way, he creates the possibility that police will, in a\nlegitimate and lawful manner, exceed or almost match his\nspeed or use force to bring him within their custody. A\nperpetrator’s indifference to these collateral consequences\nhas violent—even lethal—potential for others. A criminal\nwho takes flight and creates a risk of this dimension takes\naction similar in degree of danger to that involved in\narson, which also entails intentional release of a destruc\ntive force dangerous to others. This similarity is a begin\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nning point in establishing that vehicle flight presents a\nserious potential risk of physical injury to another.\n   Another consideration is a comparison to the crime of\nburglary. Burglary is dangerous because it can end in\nconfrontation leading to violence. Id., at 200. The same is\ntrue of vehicle flight, but to an even greater degree. The\nattempt to elude capture is a direct challenge to an offi\ncer’s authority. It is a provocative and dangerous act that\ndares, and in a typical case requires, the officer to give\nchase. The felon’s conduct gives the officer reason to\nbelieve that the defendant has something more serious\nthan a traffic violation to hide. In Sykes’ case, officers\npursued a man with two prior violent felony convictions\nand marijuana in his possession. In other cases officers\nmay discover more about the violent potential of the flee\ning suspect by running a check on the license plate or by\nrecognizing the fugitive as a convicted felon. See, e.g.,\nArizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 2).\n   Because an accepted way to restrain a driver who poses\ndangers to others is through seizure, officers pursuing\nfleeing drivers may deem themselves duty bound to esca\nlate their response to ensure the felon is apprehended.\nScott v. Harris, 550 U. S. 372, 385 (2007), rejected the\npossibility that police could eliminate the danger from a\nvehicle flight by giving up the chase because the perpetra\ntor “might have been just as likely to respond by continu\ning to drive recklessly as by slowing down and wiping his\nbrow.” And once the pursued vehicle is stopped, it is\nsometimes necessary for officers to approach with guns\ndrawn to effect arrest. Confrontation with police is the\nexpected result of vehicle flight. It places property and\npersons at serious risk of injury.\n   Risk of violence is inherent to vehicle flight. Between\nthe confrontations that initiate and terminate the inci\ndent, the intervening pursuit creates high risks of crashes.\nIt presents more certain risk as a categorical matter than\n8                 SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nburglary. It is well known that when offenders use motor\nvehicles as their means of escape they create serious po\ntential risks of physical injury to others. Flight from a\nlaw enforcement officer invites, even demands, pursuit.\nAs that pursuit continues, the risk of an accident accumu\nlates. And having chosen to flee, and thereby commit a\ncrime, the perpetrator has all the more reason to seek to\navoid capture.\n   Unlike burglaries, vehicle flights from an officer by\ndefinitional necessity occur when police are present, are\nflights in defiance of their instructions, and are effected\nwith a vehicle that can be used in a way to cause serious\npotential risk of physical injury to another. See post, at 5–\n6 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment); see also post, at\n6–7 (listing Indiana cases addressing ordinary intentional\nvehicle flight and noting the high-risk conduct that those\nconvictions involved).\n   Although statistics are not dispositive, here they con\nfirm the commonsense conclusion that Indiana’s vehicular\nflight crime is a violent felony. See Chambers, 555 U. S.,\nat 129 (explaining that statistical evidence sometimes\n“helps provide a conclusive . . . answer” concerning the\nrisks that crimes present). As JUSTICE THOMAS explains,\nchase-related crashes kill more than 100 nonsuspects\nevery year. See post, at 4–5. Injury rates are much\nhigher. Studies show that between 18% and 41% of chases\ninvolve crashes, which always carry a risk of injury, and\nthat between 4% and 17% of all chases end in injury. See\nibid.\n   A 2008 International Association of Chiefs of Police\n(IACP) study examined 7,737 police pursuits reported by\n56 agencies in 30 States during 2001–2007. C. Lum & G.\nFachner, Police Pursuits in an Age of Innovation and\nReform 54. Those pursuits, the study found, resulted in\n313 injuries to police and bystanders, a rate of slightly\nover 4 injuries to these nonsuspects per 100 pursuits. Id.,\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nat 57. Given that police may be least likely to pursue\nsuspects where the dangers to bystanders are greatest—\ni.e., when flights occur at extraordinarily high speeds—\nit is possible that risks associated with vehicle flight are\neven higher.\n   Those risks may outstrip the dangers of at least two\noffenses enumerated in 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Ac\ncording to a study by the Department of Justice, approxi\nmately 3.7 million burglaries occurred on average each\nyear in the United States between 2003 and 2007. Bureau\nof Justice Statistics, S. Catalano, Victimization during\nHousehold Burglary 1 (Sept. 2010). Those burglaries\nresulted in an annual average of approximately 118,000\ninjuries, or 3.2 injuries for every 100 burglaries. Id., at 9–\n10. That risk level is 20% lower than that which the IACP\nfound for vehicle pursuits.\n   The U. S. Fire Administration (USFA) maintains the\nworld’s largest data bank on fires. It secures participation\nfrom over one-third of U. S. fire departments. It reports\nan estimated 38,400 arsons in 2008. Those fires resulted\nin an estimated 1,255 injuries, or 3.3 injuries per 100\narsons.

That risk level is about 20% lower than that\nreported by the IACP for vehicle flight.\n10                SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               III \n\n   Sykes argues that, regardless of risk level, typical vehi\ncle flights do not involve the kinds of dangers that the\nArmed Career Criminal Act’s (ACCA) residual clause\ndemands. In his view this Court’s decisions in Begay and\nChambers require ACCA predicates to be purposeful,\nviolent, and aggressive in ways that vehicle flight is not.\nSykes, in taking this position, overreads the opinions of\nthis Court.\n   ACCA limits the residual clause to crimes “typically\ncommitted by those whom one normally labels ‘armed\ncareer criminals,’ ” that is, crimes that “show an increased\nlikelihood that the offender is the kind of person who\nmight deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.”\nBegay, 553 U. S., at 146. In general, levels of risk divide\ncrimes that qualify from those that do not. See, e.g.,\nJames, 550 U. S. 192 (finding attempted burglary risky\nenough to qualify). Chambers is no exception. 555 U. S.,\nat ___–___ (slip op., at 5–6) (explaining that failure to\nreport does not qualify because the typical offender is not\n“significantly more likely than others to attack, or physi\ncally to resist, an apprehender”).\n   The sole decision of this Court concerning the reach of\nACCA’s residual clause in which risk was not the dis\npositive factor is Begay, which held that driving under\nthe influence (DUI) is not an ACCA predicate. There, the\nCourt stated that DUI is not purposeful, violent, and\naggressive. 553 U. S., at 145–148. But the Court also\ngave a more specific reason for its holding. “[T]he conduct\nfor which the drunk driver is convicted (driving under the\ninfluence) need not be purposeful or deliberate,” id., at 145\n(analogizing DUI to strict-liability, negligence, and reck\nlessness crimes). By contrast, the Indiana statute at issue\nhere has a stringent mens rea requirement. Violators\nmust act “knowingly or intentionally.” Ind. Code §35–44–\n3–3(a); see Woodward, 770 N. E. 2d, at 901 (construing the\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute to require “a knowing attempt to escape law en\nforcement” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   The phrase “purposeful, violent, and aggressive” has no\nprecise textual link to the residual clause, which requires\nthat an ACCA predicate “otherwise involv[e] conduct that\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\nanother.” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The Begay phrase is an addi\ntion to the statutory text. In many cases the purposeful,\nviolent, and aggressive inquiry will be redundant with the\ninquiry into risk, for crimes that fall within the former\nformulation and those that present serious potential risks\nof physical injury to others tend to be one and the same.\nAs between the two inquiries, risk levels provide a cate\ngorical and manageable standard that suffices to resolve\nthe case before us.\n   Begay involved a crime akin to strict liability, negli\ngence, and recklessness crimes; and the purposeful, vio\nlent, and aggressive formulation was used in that case to\nexplain the result. The felony at issue here is not a strict\nliability, negligence, or recklessness crime and because it\nis, for the reasons stated and as a categorical matter,\nsimilar in risk to the listed crimes, it is a crime that “oth\nerwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential\nrisk of physical injury to another.” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii).\n                              IV\n   Sykes finds it significant that his flight conviction was\nnot under the Indiana provision that criminalizes flight in\nwhich the offender “operates a vehicle in a manner that\ncreates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another per\nson.” Ind. Code §35–44–3–3(b)(1)(B). In structuring its\nlaws in this way, Sykes contends, Indiana confirmed that\nit did not intend subsection (b)(1)(A)’s general prohibition\non vehicle flight to encompass the particular class of vehi\ncle flights that subsection (b)(1)(B) reaches.\n   Sykes’ argument is unconvincing. Indiana treats viola\n12                SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntions of subsections (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) as crimes of the\nsame magnitude. They are both class D felonies, and both\ncarry terms of between six months and three years, Ind.\nCode §35–50–2–7(a). The distinction between the provi\nsions is their relationship to subsection (a), which prohib\nits, among other acts, much conduct in which a person\n“(1) forcibly resists, obstructs, or interferes with a law en\nforcement officer . . . ; (2) forcibly resists, obstructs, or\ninterferes with the authorized service or execution of . . .\nprocess . . . ; or (3) flees from a law enforcement officer.”\n§35–44–3–3(a). Subsection (b)(1)(A) only involves the\nconduct barred by subsection (a)(3)—flight—which, it\nstates, is a felony whenever committed with a vehicle.\nUnder subsection (b)(1)(B), by contrast, any of the offenses\nin subsection (a) is a felony if the offender commits it\nwhile using a vehicle to create a substantial risk of bodily\ninjury to another. Taken together, the statutory incen\ntives always favor prosecuting vehicle flights under sub\nsection (b)(1)(A) rather than subsection (b)(1)(B). They\nreflect a judgment that some offenses in subsection (a) can\nbe committed without a vehicle or without creating sub\nstantial risks. They reflect the further judgment that this\nis not so for vehicle flights.\n   Serious and substantial risks are an inherent part of\nvehicle flight. Under subsection (b)(1)(A), they need not be\nproved separately to secure a conviction equal in magni\ntude to those available for other forms of resisting law\nenforcement with a vehicle that involve similar risks.\n   In other words, the “similarity in punishment for these\nrelated, overlapping offenses suggests that [subsection\n(b)(1)(A)] is the rough equivalent of one type of [subsection\n(b)(1)(B)] violation.” Post, at 10 (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment); see also ibid., n. 2. By adding subsection\n(b)(1)(A) in 1998, the Indiana Legislature determined that\nsubsection (b)(1)(A) by itself sufficed as a basis for the\npunishments available under subsection (b)(1)(B).

As\nthe above discussion indicates, however, the case at hand\ndoes not present the occasion to decide that question.\n                              V\n   Congress chose to frame ACCA in general and qualita\ntive, rather than encyclopedic, terms. It could have de\nfined violent felonies by compiling a list of specific covered\noffenses. Under the principle that all are deemed to know\nthe law, every armed felon would then be assumed to\nknow which of his prior felonies could serve to increase\nhis sentence. Given that ACCA “requires judges to make\nsometimes difficult evaluations of the risks posed by dif\nferent offenses,” this approach could simplify adjudica\ntions for judges in some cases. James, 550 U. S., at 210,\nn. 6.\n   Congress instead stated a normative principle. The re\nsidual clause imposes enhanced punishment for unlaw-\nful possession of the firearm when the relevant prior\noffenses involved a potential risk of physical injury similar\nto that presented by burglary, extortion, arson, and crimes\ninvolving use of explosives. The provision instructs poten\ntial recidivists regarding the applicable sentencing regime\nif they again transgress. It states an intelligible principle\nand provides guidance that allows a person to “conform his\nor her conduct to the law.” Chicago v. Morales, 527 U. S.\n14                SYKES v.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                         [June 9, 2011]\n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in the judgment.\n   I agree with the Court that the Indiana crime of in\ntentional vehicular flight, Ind. Code §35–44–3–3(b)(1)(A)\n(2004), is a “violent felony” under the Armed Career\nCriminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The\nmajority also correctly refuses to apply the “ purposeful,\nviolent, and aggressive ” test created in Begay v. United\nStates, 553 U. S. 137, 145 (2008). However, the majority\nerrs by implying that the “purposeful, violent, and aggres\nsive” test may still apply to offenses “akin to strict liabil\nity, negligence, and recklessness crimes.” Ante, at 11.\n   The error in imposing that test, which does not appear\nin ACCA, is well catalogued. See, e.g., Begay, 553 U. S., at\n150–152 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 158–\n159 (ALITO, J., dissenting); ante, at 11 (finding “no pre\ncise textual link” in the statute). I agree with JUSTICES\nSCALIA and KAGAN that the majority’s partial retreat from\nBegay only further muddies ACCA’s residual clause. Post,\nat 1 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); post, at 1, n. 1 (KAGAN, J.,\ndissenting).\n   The only question here is whether, in the ordinary case,\nusing a vehicle to knowingly flee from the police after\nbeing ordered to stop “involves conduct that presents a\nserious potential risk of physical injury to another.”\n§924(e)(2)(B)(ii). I believe that it does. Therefore I concur\nin the judgment.\n2                 SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n                              I\n   Under Indiana law, intentional vehicular flight is a\nfelony. Any person who “knowingly or intentionally . . .\nflees from a law enforcement officer after the officer has,\nby visible or audible means, identified himself and ordered\nthe person to stop” commits a misdemeanor. Ind. Code\n§35–44–3–3(a)(3). If the person “uses a vehicle” to flee,\nhowever, the offense is elevated to a class D felony.\n§3(b)(1)(A). That felony, the parties agree, qualifies as a\n“violent felony” under ACCA if it is “burglary, arson, or\nextortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves\nconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical\ninjury to another.” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii).\n   As explained below, Indiana’s crime of intentional ve\nhicular flight “involves conduct that presents a serious\npotential risk of physical injury to another.” Ibid. The\nelements of §3(b)(1)(A), compared to those of the enumer\nated ACCA offense of burglary, suggest that an ordinary\nviolation of §3(b)(1)(A) is far riskier than an ordinary\nburglary. Statistics, common experience, and Indiana\ncases support this conclusion.\n                               A\n   The specific crimes Congress listed as “violent felon\n[ies]” in ACCA—arson, extortion, burglary, and use of\nexplosives—provide a “baseline against which to measure\nthe degree of risk” that a nonenumerated offense must\npresent in order to qualify as a violent felony. James v.\nUnited States, 550 U. S. 192, 208 (2007); see also ante, at\n6. Burglary, for instance, sets a low baseline level for risk.\nIts elements are “unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or\nremaining in, a building or structure, with intent to com\nmit a crime.” Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 599\n(1990). As this Court has recognized, the risk of burglary\nis in “the possibility that an innocent person might appear\nwhile the crime is in progress” and the danger inherent in\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nsuch a “face-to-face confrontation.” James, 550 U. S., at\n203. The chance of an interruption or confrontation in an\nordinary burglary is, of course, quite small; burglars gen\nerally plan and commit their crimes with an eye toward\navoiding detection. Nevertheless, that small chance suf\nficed for Congress to list burglary as a “violent felony,” and\nfor this Court to hold that attempted burglary also quali\nfies. See id., at 195.\n   Compared to burglary, the elements of intentional ve\nhicular flight describe conduct that ordinarily poses\ngreater potential risk. Although interruption and confron\ntation are quite rare for burglary, every §3(a)(3) flight is\ncommitted in the presence of a police officer. Every\n§3(a)(3) flight also involves a perpetrator acting in know\ning defiance of an officer’s direct order to stop, “which is a\nclear challenge to the officer’s authority and typically\ninitiates pursuit.” United States v. Harrimon, 568 F. 3d\n531, 535 (CA5 2009); see also United States v. Spells, 537\nF. 3d 743, 752 (CA7 2008) (“Taking flight calls the officer\nto give chase, and aside from any accompanying risk to\npedestrians and other motorists, such flight dares the\nofficer to needlessly endanger himself in pursuit”). Fi\nnally, in every §3(b)(1)(A) flight, the perpetrator is armed\nwith what can be a deadly weapon: a vehicle. See, e.g.,\nScott v. Harris, 550 U. S. 372, 383 (2007) (noting that “the\nthreat posed by the flight on foot of an unarmed suspect”\nwas not “even remotely comparable to the extreme danger\nto human life” posed by that vehicular chase); United\nStates v. Kendrick, 423 F. 3d 803, 809 (CA8 2005) (“[T]he\ndangerous circumstances surrounding a person’s attempt\nto flee from law enforcement are compounded by the\nperson’s operation of a motor vehicle”); United States v.\nAceves-Rosales, 832 F. 2d 1155, 1157 (CA9 1987) (per\ncuriam) (“It is indisputable that an automobile . . . can be\nused as a deadly weapon”).\n   In sum, every violation of §3(b)(1)(A) involves a defiant\n4                 SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nsuspect with a dangerous weapon committing a felony in\nfront of a police officer. Based on its elements, the poten\ntial risk of intentional vehicular flight resembles “armed\nburglary in the presence of a security guard” more than\nsimple burglary. Section 3(b)(1)(A) outlaws conduct with\nmuch more risk—a far greater likelihood of confrontation\nwith police and a greater chance of violence in that\nconfrontation—than burglary. It follows that the “the con\nduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordi\nnary case,” poses a greater risk of harm than the enumer\nated offense of burglary. James, supra, at 208.\n                               B\n  Common experience and statistical evidence confirm the\n“potential risk” of intentional vehicular flight. Cf. Cham\nbers v. United States, 555 U. S. 122, 129 (2009) (statistical\nevidence, though not always necessary, “strongly supports\nthe intuitive belief that failure to report does not involve a\nserious potential risk of physical injury”). Data from the\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows\nthat approximately 100 police officers, pedestrians, and\noccupants of other cars are killed each year in chase\nrelated crashes. National Center for Statistics & Analysis,\nFatalities in Motor Vehicle Traffic Crashes Involving\nPolice in Pursuit 37–56 (2010) (reporting 1,269 such\ndeaths between 2000 and 2009).\n  The number injured must be much higher. Many thou\nsands of police chases occur every year. In California and\nPennsylvania, which collect statewide pursuit data, police\nwere involved in a combined total of more than 8,700\nchases in 2007 alone. See Pennsylvania State Police\nBureau of Research & Development, Police Pursuits 2007\nAnnual Report; Report to the Legislature, Senate Bill 719,\nCalifornia Police Pursuits (March 2008); see also Schultz,\nHudak, & Alpert, Emergency Driving and Pursuits, FBI\nLaw Enforcement Bulletin, Apr. 2009, pp. 1, 4 (surveying\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

And up to 41%\nof all chases involve a crash, which always carries some\nrisk of injury. Wells & Falcone, Research on Police Pur\nsuits: Advantages of Multiple Data Collection Strategies,\n20 Policing: Int’l J. Police Strategies & Management 729,\n740 (1997) (citing nine studies, each showing a crash rate\nbetween 18% and 41%). Indeed, studies show that 4% to\n17% of all chases actually cause injury. Ibid.; see also C.\nLum & G. Fachner, Police Pursuits in an Age of Innova\ntion and Reform 57 (2008) (finding that 23.5% of flights\ninvolve a crash, and 9% of flights cause injury).\n   An International Association of Chiefs of Police study\nof 7,737 pursuits across 30 States found 900 injuries, of\nwhich 313 were to police or bystanders. Ibid. As the\nmajority observes, that injury rate is just over 4 injuries\nper 100 chases, excluding injuries to the perpetrator.\nAnte, at 8. By comparison, the injury rate for burglary\nand arson is around 3 injuries per 100 crimes, or less.\nAnte, at 9; see also Harrimon, supra, at 537 (citing similar\narson statistics, showing between 1 and 3 injuries per 100\nfires, apparently including injuries to perpetrators). Sta\ntistics support what logic suggests: The ordinary case of\nintentional vehicular flight is risky, indeed, more so than\nsome offenses listed in ACCA.\n   These statistical risks of intentional flight merely rein\nforce common sense and real world experience.

In the real world, everyone—police, citizens, and\nsuspects who elect to flee—knows that vehicular flight is\ndangerous.\n                              C\n  Convictions under §3(b)(1)(A) further support this con\nclusion. See, e.g., Mason v. State, 944 N. E. 2d 68, 69–70\n(Ind.

Al\nthough these cases are only a limited collection, their facts\nillustrate that convictions under §3(b)(1)(A) often involve\nhighly dangerous conduct.\n                             II\n   Sykes argues that intentional vehicular flight is not a\nviolent felony for two main reasons. First, he asserts that\nit is possible to violate Indiana’s intentional vehicular\nflight statute without doing anything dangerous. Second,\nhe urges that the existence of Ind. Code §35–44–3–\n3(b)(1)(B), which includes “substantial risk” as an addi\n8                SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n              THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\ntional element, indicates that §3(b)(1)(A) is nonrisky.\nNeither argument is persuasive.\n                             A\n   Sykes observes that it would violate the statute to flee\nat low speed, obeying traffic signs and stopping after only\na short distance. See Woodward v. State, 770 N. E. 2d\n897, 900–901 (Ind. App. 2002); post, at 4 (KAGAN, J., dis\nsenting). Such a flight, he urges, would not present “a\nserious potential risk of physical injury to another,” so\na conviction under the statute cannot categorically be a\nviolent felony.\n   The fact that Sykes can imagine a nonrisky way to\nviolate §3(b)(1)(A) does not disprove that intentional ve\nhicular flight is dangerous “in the ordinary case.” See\nJames, 550 U. S., at 208. It is also possible to imagine\ncommitting burglary—an enumerated offense—under\ncircumstances that pose virtually no risk of physical in\njury. See id., at 207 (hypothesizing a “break-in of an\nunoccupied structure located far off the beaten path and\naway from any potential intervenors”).\n   Nor has Sykes established that the nonrisky scenario he\nimagines is the ordinary violation of §3(b)(1)(A). Sykes\noffers nothing more than two Indiana cases that, in his\nview, are instances of nonrisky vehicular flight. See\nSwain v. State, 923 N. E. 2d 32, 2010 WL 623720 (Ind.\nApp., Feb. 23, 2010); Woodward, supra, at 898. Yet not\neven those cases obviously involve nonrisky conduct. In\nSwain, the defendant was a getaway driver who picked up\nher boyfriend’s accomplice as he ran on foot from two\npolice officers. 2010 WL 623720, *1, *3. As the officers\napproached the car and shouted to stop, she yelled,\n“ ‘Hurry up. Come on. They’re coming,’ ” and drove off as\nthe runner jumped in. Id., at *1. She stopped 10 to 15\nseconds later, when police vehicles converging on the\nscene took up pursuit. Ibid. In Woodward, the defendant\n                     Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                   9\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nignored a police siren for approximately a mile, passed\nseveral good places to pull over, and drove all the way\nhome, but traveled at the speed limit of 45 mph and\nobeyed traffic laws. 770 N. E. 2d, at 898. Eventually the\ndefendant got out of his car and shouted profanities at the\nofficer, who drew his pistol. Id., at 898, 901; see also id.,\nat 901, 902 (observing that the defendant had refused to\nstop “except on his own terms” and noting “the dangers\nthat could await a police officer stopping where the citizen\nselects”). These two cases fall well short of showing\nthat intentional flight in Indiana is ordinarily nonrisky.1\nSee also post, at 6 (KAGAN, J., dissenting) (noting that\nthe “intuition that dangerous flights outstrip mere failures\nto stop . . . seems consistent with common sense and\nexperience”).\n                              B\n   Sykes also notes that a different subparagraph, §3(b)\n(1)(B), covers intentional flight committed while “oper\nat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substan-\ntial risk of bodily injury to another person,” whereas\n§3(b)(1)(A) has no such element. From this, Sykes infers\nthat §3(b)(1)(A) necessarily concerns only flight that does\nnot present a serious potential risk. The argument is that,\neven though the elements of §3(b)(1)(A) describe conduct\nthat ordinarily will satisfy the requisite level of risk, the\npresence of §3(b)(1)(B) casts §3(b)(1)(A) in a less dangerous\nlight. Post, at 8 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). But the fact that\n§3(b)(1)(B) includes “substantial risk of bodily injury”\nas an element does not restrict §3(b)(1)(A) to nonrisky\n——————\n  1 Sykes certainly cannot use his own flight as an example.        His\n§3(b)(1)(A) conviction was based on fleeing from police in a damaged car\nat night without headlights, driving on the wrong side of the road,\nweaving through traffic, barreling through two yards and among\nbystanders, destroying a fence, and crashing into a house. Ante, at 4; 2\nApp. 11 (Sealed).\n10                   SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                 THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nconduct.\n   First, apart from the existence of §3(b)(1)(B), the ab\nsence of risk as an element of §3(b)(1)(A) does not mean\nthat the offense is not a violent felony. ACCA does not\nrequire that a violent felony expressly include a risk of\ninjury as an element of the offense. Enumerated violent\nfelonies like arson and burglary have no such element.\n   Second, §3(b)(1)(B) is not a risky, aggravated version\nof §3(b)(1)(A). Both are class D felonies, and at the time of\nSykes’ conviction, there was no statutory difference in\npunishment between them. Even now, the offenses re\nmain of a single class, meriting similar punishments.\n   The similarity in punishment for these related, overlap\nping offenses suggests that §3(b)(1)(A) is the rough equiva\nlent of one type of §3(b)(1)(B) violation. Section 3(b)(1)(B)\nenhances punishments for three separate types of in\ntentional misdemeanors: obstructing an officer, §3(a)(1);\ninterfering with service of process, §3(a)(2); and fleeing\nfrom a police officer, §3(a)(3). Under §3(b)(1)(B), commit\nting any of those offenses while also drawing a deadly\nweapon, inflicting injury, or “operat[ing] a vehicle in a\nmanner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to\nanother person” has long been a class D felony.\n   In 1998, the Indiana Legislature added §3(b)(1)(A) to\nprovide that any use of a vehicle to flee from an officer\nunder §3(a)(3) is always a class D felony.           Section\n3(b)(1)(A) is, in effect, a shortcut to the same punishment\nfor one particular violation of §3(b)(1)(B).2 It is still the\n——————\n  2 Indiana  law at the time of Sykes’ conviction presented two related\nprovisions, within a single statute, carrying the same punishment. One\nwas a broad provision that had risk as an element, and the other was a\nnarrower provision that did not. While JUSTICE KAGAN would infer that\nthe offense lacking risk as an element was likely not ordinarily risky,\npost, at 6–8, I think it makes more sense to infer the opposite.\n  Consider reckless endangerment statutes. In Hawaii, for instance, it\nis “reckless endangering in the second degree” either to “recklessly\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

But using a vehicle to intentionally\nflee is always a class D felony, without any need to prove\nrisk. §3(b)(1)(A).\n   This rough equivalence between §3(b)(1)(A) and §3(b)\n(1)(B) is borne out in Indiana case law. The conduct\nunderlying the Indiana cases discussed above, see supra,\nat 6–7, demonstrates that despite §3(b)(1)(B), convictions\nunder §3(b)(1)(A) include risky flights.\n   Third, the remainder of Indiana’s resisting law enforce\n\n——————\nplac[e] another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury,”\nHaw. Rev. Stat. §707–714(1)(a) (2009 Cum. Supp.), or to “[i]ntentionally\ndischarg[e] a firearm in a populated area,” §707–714(1)(b). I would\ninfer that discharging the firearm is deemed dangerous enough per se\nthat the statute does not require the State to prove danger in any given\ncase. Other States have similar statutes. See, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit.\n11, §§603(a)(1), (2) (2007); Wyo. Stat. Ann. §§6–2–504(a), (b) (2009); Me.\nRev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17–A, §§301(1)(B)(1), (2) (Supp. 2010).\n   Similarly here, I infer that §3(b)(1)(A)’s upgrade of intentional flight\nto a class D felony based on the use of a vehicle alone indicates that the\noffense inherently qualifies as, or approximates, “operat[ing] a vehicle\nin a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another\nperson” under §3(b)(1)(B).\n   JUSTICE KAGAN argues that if my reading were correct, the Indiana\nLegislature would have removed the reference to vehicular flight from\n§3(b)(1)(B) when it added §3(b)(1)(A). Post, at 12. There are at least\ntwo problems with this reasoning. First, even though §3(b)(1)(A) may\nbe redundant with §3(b)(1)(B) as to the vehicular flight offenses in\nsubsection (a)(3), the reference to “operat[ing] a vehicle” in §3(b)(1)(B) is\nstill independently useful for the offenses in subsections (a)(1) and (2).\nThus, it is hardly strange for the legislature to have left the reference\nto “operat[ing] a vehicle” in §3(b)(1)(B). Second, although JUSTICE\nKAGAN can envision a more perfectly drafted statute, we do not require\nperfection in statutory drafting. See, e.g., Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC,\n562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12). I think it clear enough what\nthe statute means.\n12                    SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nment statute confirms that its other provisions do not\nreserve §3(b)(1)(A) for nonrisky conduct. An intentional\nvehicular flight becomes a class C felony if the vehicle is\noperated “in a manner that causes serious bodily injury.”\nInd. Code §35–44–3–3(b)(2). The same act becomes a class\nB felony if someone is killed. §35–44–3–3(b)(3).3 JUSTICE\nKAGAN asserts that each of these “separate, escalating\ncrimes” captures an increasing degree of risk and neces\nsarily means that §3(b)(1)(A), the offense simpliciter, is\nless risky than it otherwise seems. Post, at 7.\n   The flaw in this reasoning is that §§3(b)(2) and (3) en\nhance punishment based solely on the results of the flight,\nnot the degree of risk it posed. Neither provision requires\nany action by a suspect beyond that which satisfies the\nelements of §3(b)(1)(A).4 Rather, each provision addresses\nwhat happens when the risk inherent in a violation of\n§3(b)(1)(A) is actualized and someone is hurt or killed.\nThe risk of physical injury inherent in intentional vehicu\nlar flight simpliciter was apparently clear enough to spur\nthe Indiana Legislature to specify greater penalties for the\ninevitable occasions when physical injury actually occurs.\nBy comparison, for obviously nonrisky felonies like insur\nance fraud or misappropriation of escrow funds, legisla\ntures do not specify what additional punishment is war\nranted when the crime kills or injures bystanders or\npolice. See, e.g., Ind. Code §35–43–5–7.2; §35–43–9–7. In\nsum, §§3(b)(2) and (3) do not demonstrate that §3(b)(1)(A)\nis less risky than it otherwise seems, but instead support\nthe idea that it is inherently risky.\n——————\n  3 Indiana recently added that if a police officer dies, it becomes a class\n\nA felony. 2010 Ind. Acts p. 1197.\n  4 For that matter, each provision also could be satisfied by a flight\n\nthat did not satisfy §3(b)(1)(B), which casts further doubt on JUSTICE\nKAGAN’s vision of the statutory scheme as a unified structure of neatly\nprogressing offenses with corresponding risk levels and punishments.\nSee post, at 7.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

More specifically, it is an at\ntempt to clarify, for the fourth time since 2007, what\ndistinguishes “violent felonies” under the residual clause\nof the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C.\n§924(e)(2)(B)(ii), from other crimes. See James v. United\nStates, 550 U. S. 192 (2007); Begay v. United States, 553\nU. S. 137 (2008); Chambers v. United States, 555 U. S. 122\n(2009). We try to include an ACCA residual-clause case in\nabout every second or third volume of the United States\nReports.\n   As was perhaps predictable, instead of producing a clar\nification of the Delphic residual clause, today’s opinion\nproduces a fourth ad hoc judgment that will sow further\nconfusion. Insanity, it has been said, is doing the same\nthing over and over again, but expecting different results.\nFour times is enough. We should admit that ACCA’s\nresidual provision is a drafting failure and declare it void\nfor vagueness. See Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 357\n(1983).\n                                I\n  ACCA defines “violent felony,” in relevant part, as “any\ncrime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding\none year . . . that . . . is burglary, arson, or extortion, in\n2                 SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nvolves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct\nthat presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\nanother.” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Many years of\nprison hinge on whether a crime falls within this defini\ntion. A felon convicted of possessing a firearm who has\nthree prior violent-felony convictions faces a 15-year man\ndatory minimum sentence and the possibility of life im\nprisonment. See §924(e)(1); see United States v. Harrison,\n558 F. 3d 1280, 1282, n. 1 (CA11 2009). Without those\nprior convictions, he would face a much lesser sentence,\nwhich could not possibly exceed 10 years. See §924(a)(2).\n   Vehicular flight is a violent felony only if it falls within\nACCA’s residual clause; that is, if it “involves conduct\nthat presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\nanother.” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Today’s opinion says, or ini\ntially seems to say, that an offense qualifies as a violent\nfelony if its elements, in the typical case, create a degree\nof risk “ ‘comparable to that posed by its closest analog\namong the enumerated offenses.’ ” Ante, at 6. That is a\nquotation from the Court’s opinion in the first of our\nresidual-clause trilogy, James, 550 U. S., at 203. I did not\njoin that opinion because I thought it should suffice if the\nelements created a degree of risk comparable to the least\nrisky of the enumerated offenses, whether or not it was\nthe closest analog. See id., at 230 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\nThe problem with applying the James standard to the pres\nent case is that the elements of vehicular flight under\nIndiana law are not analogous to any of the four enumer\nated offenses. See Ind. Code §35–44–3–3 (2004). Nor is it\napparent which of the enumerated offenses most closely\nresembles, for example, statutory rape, see United States\nv. Daye, 571 F. 3d 225, 228–236 (CA2 2009); possession of\na sawed-off shotgun, see United States v. Upton, 512 F. 3d\n394, 403–405 (CA7 2008); or a failure to report to prison,\nsee Chambers, supra. I predicted this inadequacy of the\n“closest analog” test in my James dissent. See 550 U. S.,\n                   Cite as: 564 U.

For today’s opinion introduces the James standard\nwith the words “[f]or instance,” ante, at 6. It is (according\nto the Court) merely one example of how the enumerated\ncrimes (burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes using explo\nsives) “provide guidance.” Ibid. And the opinion then\nproceeds to obtain guidance from the risky-as-the-least\nrisky test that I suggested (but the Court rejected) in\nJames—finding vehicular flight at least as risky as both\narson and burglary. See ante, at 6–9.\n   But what about the test that determined the outcome in\nour second case in this “series”—the “purposeful, violent,\nand aggressive” test of Begay? Fear not. That incompati\nble variation has been neither overlooked nor renounced in\ntoday’s tutti-frutti opinion. “In many cases,” we are told,\nit “will be redundant with the inquiry into risk.” Ante, at\n11. That seems to be the case here—though why, and\nwhen it will not be the case, are not entirely clear. The\nCourt’s accusation that Sykes “overreads the opinions of\nthis Court,” ante, at 10, apparently applies to his interpre\ntation of Begay’s “purposeful, violent, and aggressive” test,\nwhich the Court now suggests applies only “to strict liabil\nity, negligence, and recklessness crimes,” ante, at 11. But\nthat makes no sense. If the test excluded only those unin\ntentional crimes, it would be recast as the “purposeful”\ntest, since the last two adjectives (“violent, and aggres\nsive”) would do no work. For that reason, perhaps, all 11\nCircuits that have addressed Begay “overrea[d]” it just as\nSykes does*—and as does the Government, see Brief for\n——————\n  * See United States v.

S. 122—which\napplied both the risky-as-the-least-risky test and the “pur\nposeful, violent, and aggressive” test to reach the con\nclusion that failure to report for periodic incarceration\nwas not a crime of violence under ACCA. But today’s\nopinion does cite Chambers for another point: Whereas\nJames rejected the risky-as-the-least-risky approach be\ncause, among other reasons, no “hard statistics” on risk\niness “have been called to our attention,” 550 U. S., at\n210; and whereas Begay made no mention of statistics;\nChambers explained (as today’s opinion points out) that\n“statistical evidence sometimes ‘helps provide a conclusive\n. . . answer’ concerning the risks that crimes present,”\nante, at 8 (quoting Chambers, supra, at 129). Today’s\nopinion then outdoes Chambers in the volume of statistics\nthat it spews forth—statistics compiled by the Interna\ntional Association of Chiefs of Police concerning injuries\nattributable to police pursuits, ante, at 8; statistics from\nthe Department of Justice concerning injuries attributable\nto burglaries, ante, at 9; statistics from the U. S. Fire\nAdministration concerning injuries attributable to fires,\nibid., and (by reference to JUSTICE THOMAS’s concurrence)\nstatistics from the National Center for Statistics & Analy\nsis, the Pennsylvania State Police Bureau of Research, the\nFBI Law Enforcement Bulletin and several articles pub\nlished elsewhere concerning injuries attributable to police\npursuits, ante, at 8 (citing ante, at 4–5 (THOMAS, J., con\ncurring in judgment)).\n——————\nF. 3d 373, 377 (CA6 2009); United States v.

We normally give parties\nmore robust protection, leaving important factual ques\ntions to district courts and juries aided by expert wit\nnesses and the procedural protections of discovery. See\nFed. Rule Crim. Proc. 16(a)(1)(F), (G); Fed. Rules Evid.\n702–703, 705. An adversarial process in the trial courts\ncan identify flaws in the methodology of the studies that\nthe parties put forward; here, we accept the studies’ find\nings on faith, without examining their methodology at all.\nThe Court does not examine, for example, whether the\npolice-pursuit data on which it relies is a representative\nsample of all vehicular flights. The data may be skewed\ntowards the rare and riskier forms of flight. See post, at 6,\nn. 4 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). We also have no way of\nknowing how many injuries reported in that data would\nhave occurred even absent pursuit, by a driver who was\ndriving recklessly even before the police gave chase.\nSimilar questions undermine confidence in the burglary\nand arson data the Court cites. For example, the Court\nrelies on a U. S. Fire Administration dataset to conclude\nthat 3.3 injuries occur per 100 arsons. See ante, at 9. But\na 2001 report from the same U. S. Fire Administration\nsuggests that roughly 1 injury occurs per 100 arsons. See\nArson in the United States, Vol. 1 Topical Fire Research\nSeries, No. 8, pp. 1–2 (rev. Dec. 2001), online at\nhttp://www.usfa.dhs.gov/downloads/pdf/tfrs/v1i8-508.pdf\n(as visited May 27, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s\ncase file). The Court does not reveal why it chose one\ndataset over another. In sum, our statistical analysis in\nACCA cases is untested judicial factfinding masquerading\nas statutory interpretation. Most of the statistics on\nwhich the Court relies today come from government\nfunded studies, and did not make an appearance in this\nlitigation until the Government’s merits brief to this\nCourt. See Brief for Petitioner 17; see also Chambers,\n6                 SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsupra, at 128–129 (demonstrating that the same was true\nin that case).\n   But the more fundamental problem with the Court’s use\nof statistics is that, far from eliminating the vagueness\nof the residual clause, it increases the vagueness. Vague\nness, of course, must be measured ex ante—before the\nCourt gives definitive meaning to a statutory provision,\nnot after. Nothing is vague once the Court decrees pre\ncisely what it means. And is it seriously to be expected\nthat the average citizen would be familiar with the sundry\nstatistical studies showing (if they are to be believed) that\nthis-or-that crime is more likely to lead to physical injury\nthan what sundry statistical studies (if they are to be\nbelieved) show to be the case for burglary, arson, extor\ntion, or use of explosives? To ask the question is to answer\nit. A few words, then, about unconstitutional vagueness.\n                              II\n  When I dissented from the Court’s judgment in James, I\nsaid that the residual clause’s “shoddy draftsmanship” put\ncourts to a difficult choice:\n    “They can (1) apply the ACCA enhancement to virtu\n    ally all predicate offenses, . . . ; (2) apply it case by\n    case in its pristine abstraction, finding it applicable\n    whenever the particular sentencing judge (or the par\n    ticular reviewing panel) believes there is a ‘serious po\n    tential risk of physical injury to another’ (whatever\n    that means); (3) try to figure out a coherent way of in\n    terpreting the statute so that it applies in a relatively\n    predictable and administrable fashion to a smaller\n    subset of crimes; or (4) recognize the statute for the\n    drafting failure it is and hold it void for vagueness\n    . . . .” 550 U. S., at 229–230.\nMy dissent “tried to implement,” id., at 230, the third\noption; and the Court, I believed, had chosen the second.\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n“Today’s opinion,” I wrote, “permits an unintelligible crim\ninal statute to survive uncorrected, unguided, and unex\nplained.” Id., at 230–231.\n   My assessment has not been changed by the Court’s\nlater decisions in the ACCA “series.” Today’s opinion,\nwhich adds to the “closest analog” test (James) the “pur\nposeful, violent, and aggressive” test (Begay), and even the\nrisky-as-the-least-risky test that I had proposed as the\nexclusive criterion, has not made the statute’s applica\ntion clear and predictable. And all of them together—or\neven the risky-as-the-least-risky test alone, I am now\nconvinced—never will. The residual-clause series will be\nendless, and we will be doing ad hoc application of ACCA\nto the vast variety of state criminal offenses until the cows\ncome home.\n   That does not violate the Constitution. What does vio\nlate the Constitution is approving the enforcement of a\nsentencing statute that does not “give a person of ordinar\nily intelligence fair notice” of its reach, United States v.\nBatchelder, 442 U. S. 114, 123 (1979) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted), and that permits, indeed invites, arbi\ntrary enforcement, see Kolender, 461 U. S., at 357. The\nCourt’s ever-evolving interpretation of the residual clause\nwill keep defendants and judges guessing for years to\ncome. The reality is that the phrase “otherwise involves\nconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical\ninjury to another” does not clearly define the crimes that\nwill subject defendants to the greatly increased ACCA\npenalties. It is not the job of this Court to impose a clarity\nwhich the text itself does not honestly contain. And even\nif that were our job, the further reality is that we have by\nnow demonstrated our inability to accomplish the task.\n   We have, I recognize, upheld hopelessly vague criminal\nstatutes in the past—indeed, in the recent past. See, e.g.,\nSkilling v. United States, 561 U. S. ___ (2010). That is\nregrettable, see id., at ___ (SCALIA, J., concurring in part\n8                 SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nand concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1). What sets\nACCA apart from those statutes—and what confirms its\nincurable vagueness—is our repeated inability to craft a\nprincipled test out of the statutory text. We have demon-\nstrated by our opinions that the clause is too vague to\nyield “an intelligible principle,” ante, at 13, each attempt\nto ignore that reality producing a new regime that is less\npredictable and more arbitrary than the last. ACCA’s\nresidual clause fails to speak with the clarity that criminal\nproscriptions require. See United States v. L. Cohen Gro-\ncery Co., 255 U. S. 81, 89–90 (1921).\n   The Court believes that the residual clause cannot be\nunconstitutionally vague because other criminal prohibi-\ntions also refer to the degree of risk posed by a defendant’s\nconduct. See ante, at 14. Even apart from the fact that\nour opinions dealing with those statutes have not dis-\nplayed the confusion evident in our four ACCA efforts,\nthis is not the first time I have found the comparison\nunpersuasive:\n     “None of the provisions the Court cites . . . is similar\n    in the crucial relevant respect: None prefaces its judi-\n    cially-to-be-determined requirement of risk of physical\n    injury with the word ‘otherwise,’ preceded by four con-\n    fusing examples that have little in common with re-\n    spect to the supposedly defining characteristic. The\n    phrase ‘shades of red,’ standing alone, does not gener-\n    ate confusion or unpredictability; but the phrase ‘fire-\n    engine red, light pink, maroon, navy blue, or colors\n    that otherwise involve shades of red’ assuredly does\n    so.” James, 550 U. S., at 230, n. 7.\nOf course even if the cited statutes were comparable,\nrepetition of constitutional error does not produce consti-\ntutional truth.\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Or a person may fail to heed an officer’s\ncommand to pull over, but otherwise drive in a lawful\nmanner, perhaps just trying to find a better place to stop.\nIn Indiana, as in most States, both of these individuals are\nlawbreakers. But in Indiana, again as in most States, the\nlaw takes account of the differences between them, by\ndistinguishing simple from aggravated forms of vehicular\nflight.

S. 122, 126–127 (2009) (breaking down an\nIllinois statute into discrete offenses to decide whether the\ncrime of conviction fit within the residual clause); James v.\nUnited States, 550 U. S. 192, 202 (2007) (examining how\nFlorida’s law defined attempted burglary to determine if\nthe residual clause included that offense). More particu\nlarly, we ask whether “the conduct encompassed by the\nelements” of that statute, “in the ordinary case” (not in\nevery conceivable case), involves the requisite danger and\nviolence. Id., at 208. By making this inquiry, we attempt\n——————\n   1 I understand the majority to retain the “purposeful, violent, and\n\naggressive” test, but to conclude that it is “redundant” in this case. See\nante, at 11. Like JUSTICE SCALIA, see ante, at 3 (dissenting opinion), I\nfind this conclusion puzzling. I do not think the majority could mean to\nlimit the test to “strict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes.”\nAnte, at 11 (majority opinion). As JUSTICE SCALIA notes, see ante, at 3,\nthat would be to eliminate the test’s focus on “violence” and “aggres\nsion.” And it would collide with Chambers v. United States, 555 U. S.\n122 (2009)—a decision the majority cites approvingly, see ante, at 8—\nwhich applied the test to an intentional crime. See 555 U. S., at 128\n(opinion of the Court), 130 (Appendix A to opinion of the Court) (hold\ning that “knowin[g] fail[ure] to report to a penal institution” does not\ninvolve “purposeful, violent, or aggressive conduct” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). So I assume this test will make a resurgence—that it\nwill be declared non-redundant—the next time the Court considers a\ncrime, whether intentional or not, that involves risk of injury but not\naggression or violence.\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

S., at 145 (in\nternal quotation marks omitted).\n   Under this approach, some vehicular flight offenses\nshould count as violent felonies under ACCA. Consider,\nfor example, a statute that makes it a crime to “willfully\nflee from a law enforcement officer by driving at high\nspeed or otherwise demonstrating reckless disregard for\nthe safety of others.” Such a statute, by its terms, encom\npasses conduct that ordinarily “presents a serious poten\ntial risk of physical injury to another.” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii).\nAnd the covered conduct qualifies as “purposeful, violent,\nand aggressive.” Id., at 145. When a motorist responds to\nan officer’s signal to stop by increasing his speed or taking\nreckless evasive action, he turns his car into a weapon and\nprovokes confrontation. In so doing, he engages in behav\nior “roughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk\nposed,” to that involved in ACCA’s enumerated offenses—\nthe sort of conduct, in other words, “typically committed\nby . . . ‘armed career criminals.’ ” Id., at 143, 146. Like the\nmajority, see ante, at 9–10, I therefore would classify\ncrimes of this type—call them aggravated vehicular flight\noffenses—as violent felonies under ACCA.\n   But a vehicular flight offense need not target aggressive\nand dangerous behavior. Imagine the converse of the\nstatute described above—a statute making it a crime to\n“willfully flee from a law enforcement officer without\ndriving at high speed or otherwise demonstrating reckless\ndisregard for the safety of others.” That hypothetical\nstatute addresses only simple vehicular flight: mere dis\nregard of a police officer’s directive to stop, devoid of addi\ntional conduct creating risk to others. This behavior—\noften called “failure to stop”—is illegal in most States\n4                     SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n(under a wide variety of statutory provisions). In Indiana,\nfor example, a driver who “know[s] that a police officer\nwishes to effectuate a traffic stop” may commit a felony if\nhe attempts to “choose the location of the stop,” rather\nthan pulling over immediately; it makes no difference that\nthe driver “did not speed or disobey any . . . traffic laws.”\nWoodward v. State, 770 N. E. 2d 897, 902 (Ind. App.\n2002).2 But a mere failure to stop does not usually “pre\nsen[t] a serious potential risk of physical injury to an\nother,” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii), any more than normal driving\ndoes. Nor is this conduct “violent . . . and aggressive.”\nBegay, 553 U. S., at 145; see Brief for United States 43\n(characterizing as “nonviolent” a flight from police that\ncomplies with “all traffic laws”). True, the offender is\nignoring a command he should obey. But nothing in his\nbehavior is affirmatively belligerent: It does not “show an\nincreased likelihood that [he] is the kind of person who\nmight deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.”\nBegay, 553 U. S., at 146.3 And so, under our precedents, a\nstatute criminalizing only simple vehicular flight would\nnot fall within ACCA’s residual clause. I do not under\n——————\n   2 The majority attempts to show that Woodward involved conduct\n\nmore risky and violent than a simple failure to stop. See ante, at 3; see\nalso ante, at 7 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). But the facts of\nthat case, like the facts of this one, are irrelevant. Under ACCA, all\nthat matters is the elements of the offense, and the Indiana Court of\nAppeals held in Woodward that a person who “merely fail[s] to stop” for\npolice, and does nothing more, commits a felony under state law. 770\nN. E. 2d, at 900–902.\n   3 Indeed, a driver may refrain from pulling over immediately out of\n\nconcern for his own safety. He may worry, for example, that road con\nditions make it hazardous to stop. Or a driver may fear that the\nperson initiating the stop is a criminal rather than a police officer. See,\ne.g., Brennan, Rapist to Spend Life in Prison, Tampa Tribune, Feb. 18,\n2011, Metro section, p. 3 (“[A man] impersonating a police officer . . .\nused the ruse to pull over a woman . . . and then kidnap and rape her”);\nDeKunder, Watch for “Fake” Police, Local Authorities Warn, Northeast\nHerald, Jan. 14, 2010, pp. 12, 13 (noting several similar incidents).\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nstand the majority to disagree.\n   The Indiana provision under which Sykes was convicted\nstraddles the two hypothetical statutes I have just de\nscribed. That provision, subsection (b)(1)(A), states that a\nperson commits a felony if he “flees from a law enforce\nment officer” while “us[ing] a vehicle.” Ind. Code §§35–44–\n3–3(a)(3), (b)(1)(A) (2009). As the Indiana courts have\nrecognized, the subsection thus criminalizes mere failure\nto stop, which should not count as a violent felony under\nACCA. See Woodward, 770 N. E. 2d 897; supra, at 4, and\nn. 2. But the provision also includes more violent forms of\nvehicular flight: It covers a person who speeds or drives\nrecklessly, who leads the police on a “Hollywood-style car\nchase,” Scott v. Harris, 550 U. S. 372, 380 (2007), and who\nendangers police officers, other drivers, and pedestrians.\nAnd so the “conduct encompassed by the elements” of\nthis subsection, James, 550 U. S., at 208, runs the gamut—\nfrom simple to aggravated vehicular flight, from the least\nviolent to the most violent form of the activity. Accord,\nante, at 9–10 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (stat\ning that subsection (b)(1)(A) is “not restrict[ed] . . . to\nnonrisky conduct”). The question presented is whether\nsuch a facially broad provision meets the requirements of\nACCA’s residual clause.\n   If subsection (b)(1)(A) were the whole of Indiana’s law\non vehicular flight, the majority would have a reasonable\nargument that the provision does so. As noted, a statute\nfits within the residual clause if it covers conduct that in\nthe ordinary case—not in every conceivable case—poses\nserious risk of physical injury and is purposeful, violent,\nand aggressive. See James, 550 U. S., at 208; Begay, 553\nU. S., at 145. We therefore must decide what the ordinary\ncase of vehicular flight actually is. Is it the person trying\nto escape from police by speeding or driving recklessly, in\na way that endangers others? Or is it instead the person\ndriving normally who, for whatever reason, fails to re\n6                     SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nspond immediately to a police officer’s signal? The Gov\nernment has not presented any empirical evidence ad\ndressing this question, and such evidence may not in fact\nexist.4 See Wells & Falcone, Research on Police Pursuits:\nAdvantages of Multiple Data Collection Strategies, 20\nPolicing Int’l J. Police Strategies & Management 729\n(1997) (“Collecting valid and reliable data on policing\nactivities is a perennial problem . . . . This is particularly\ntrue when studying . . . vehicle pursuits”); cf. Begay, 553\nU. S., at 154 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (“Need\nless to say, we do not have these relevant statistics”). But\nthe majority’s intuition that dangerous flights outstrip\nmere failures to stop—that the aggravated form of the\nactivity is also the ordinary form—seems consistent with\ncommon sense and experience. So that judgment, even\nthough unsupported by data, would likely be sufficient to\njustify the Court’s conclusion were subsection (b)(1)(A) the\nonly relevant provision.\n  But subsection (b)(1)(A) does not stand alone, and the\ncontext of the provision casts a different light on it. Like a\ngreat many States (45 by my count), Indiana divides the\n——————\n   4 The Government offers anecdotal examples and statistical surveys\n\nof vehicular flights, see Brief for United States 13–15, 17–22, but none\nhelps to answer whether the “ordinary” case of vehicular flight is\naggravated or simple. Cf. ante, at 4–6 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). The an\necdotes and all but one of the surveys demonstrate only that some\nvehicular flights result in serious injury, a proposition no one does or\ncould dispute. The single statistical study cited by the Government\nthat posits an injury rate for vehicular flight concludes that about 4% of\n7,737 reported police pursuits harmed police or bystanders. But that\nstudy may well involve only aggravated flights. See C. Lum & G.\nFachner, Police Pursuits in an Age of Innovation and Reform 55 (2008)\n(noting that the study relies on voluntary and non-systematic reporting\nand that participating police departments might not have reported\n“informal” incidents). And even assuming the study is comprehensive,\nit is entirely consistent with the possibility that the “ordinary case”—\ni.e., the most common form—of vehicular flight is mere failure to stop,\nwhich produces a much lower rate of injury.\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

At\nthe time of Sykes’s conviction, Indiana had four degrees\nof vehicular flight, only the first of which—subsection\n(b)(1)(A)—covered mere failure to stop.5 See Ind. Code\n§35–44–3–3. Indiana classified as a felon any person who:\n    •\t “flees from a law enforcement officer” while “us[ing]\n        a vehicle,” §3(b)(1)(A);\n    •\t “flees from a law enforcement officer” while “op\n        erat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a sub\n        stantial risk of bodily injury to another person,”\n        §3(b)(1)(B);6\n    •\t “flees from a law enforcement officer” while “op\n        erat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that causes serious\n        bodily injury to another person,” §3(b)(2); or\n    •\t “flees from a law enforcement officer” while “op\n        erat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that causes the\n        death of another person,” §3(b)(3) (all emphasis\n        added).\nVehicular flight in Indiana is therefore not a single of\nfense, but instead a series of separate, escalating crimes.\nEach category captures conduct more dangerous than the\none before it, as shown by the language italicized above.7\n——————\n   5 After Sykes’s conviction, Indiana added yet a fifth degree. See 2010\n\nInd. Acts p. 1197. The four degrees described above remain unchanged.\n   6 This provision also bars a range of other conduct. See n. 9, infra.\n   7 JUSTICE THOMAS attempts to bisect this series by stating that the\n\ntwo most serious degrees of aggravated vehicular flight “enhance\npunishment based solely on the results of the flight, not the degree of\nrisk it posed.” Ante, at 11–12. But conduct that leads to serious injury\nor death is ordinarily more risky, viewed ex ante, than conduct that\ndoes not produce these results. And in any event, the fundamental\npoint here is that the Indiana statute grades vehicular flight according\nto the seriousness of the behavior—ranging from flight that need not\npose any risk of harm, through flight posing a substantial risk of harm,\nto flight involving a certainty of harm. Subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3)\n8                     SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nAnd at the very beginning of this series is subsection\n(b)(1)(A), the offense of which Sykes was convicted.\n   That placement alters the nature of the analysis. We\nhave previously examined the way statutory provisions\nrelate to each other to determine whether a particular\nprovision counts as a violent felony under ACCA. In\nChambers, 555 U. S., at 126–127, we considered an Illinois\nstatute prohibiting within a single section several differ\nent kinds of behavior, including escape from a penal insti\ntution and failure to report to a penal institution. The\ncourts below had treated the statute as defining a single\ncrime of felonious escape and held that crime to qualify as\na violent felony under ACCA. See id., at 125; United\nStates v. Chambers, 473 F. 3d 724, 725–726 (CA7 2007).\nWe disagreed, stating that failure to report was a distinct\noffense, which did not meet ACCA’s requirements. That\nwas so, we stated, because “[t]he behavior that likely\nunderlies a failure to report would seem less likely to\ninvolve a risk of physical harm than the less passive, more\naggressive behavior underlying an escape from custody.”\nChambers, 555 U. S., at 127. In addition, we noted, the\nstatute “list[ed] escape and failure to report separately\n(in its title and its body).” Ibid. We thus considered\nthe failure-to-report clause in its statutory context—as\none part of a legislature’s delineation of related criminal\noffenses—to determine whether the behavior it encom\npassed ordinarily poses a serious risk of injury.\n   That same focus on statutory structure resolves this\ncase, because it reveals subsection (b)(1)(A) to aim at a\nsingle form—the least serious form—of vehicular flight.\nRemember: Indiana has made a purposeful choice to di\nvide the full spectrum of vehicular flight into different\n—————— \n\nthus underscore that Indiana has divided the world of vehicular flight\n\ninto discrete, ascending crimes, rather than treating all vehicular flight \n\nas of a piece. \n\n                    Cite as: 564 U.

Once again, starting with the most serious con\nduct: flight resulting in death; flight resulting in physical\ninjury; flight creating a substantial risk of physical in-\njury; flight. That last category—flight—almost screams to\nhave the word “mere” placed before it. Under the In\ndiana statute, flight—the conduct prohibited by subsection\n(b)(1)(A)—is what is left over when no aggravating factor\ncausing substantial risk or harm exists. Put on blinders,\nand the subsection is naturally understood to address all\nflight, up to and including the most dangerous kinds. But\ntake off those blinders—view the statute as a whole—and\nthe subsection is instead seen to target failures to stop.\n   In this vein, the distinction between subsections\n(b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) is especially telling. As noted,\nsubsection (b)(1)(B) prohibits vehicular flight that “creates\na substantial risk of bodily injury to another person.”\nThat language almost precisely tracks the phrasing of\nACCA’s residual clause, which refers to conduct that\n“presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\nanother.” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). This correspon\ndence indicates that the conduct criminalized under sub\nsection (b)(1)(B) qualifies as a violent felony under ACCA.\nBut subsection (b)(1)(A) lacks the very feature that makes\nsubsection (b)(1)(B) and ACCA such a perfect match: It\ndoes not require any behavior that poses serious risk to\nothers. This difference in statutory elements indicates\nthat subsection (b)(1)(B)—but not subsection (b)(1)(A)—is\ndirected toward the conduct described in ACCA’s residual\nclause. To count both as ACCA offenses is to pay insuffi\ncient heed to the way the Indiana Legislature drafted its\nstatute—as a series of escalating offenses, ranging from\nthe simple to the most aggravated.8\n——————\n  8 None of this is to deny that prosecutors may sometimes charge vio\n\nlent and dangerous offenders under subsection (b)(1)(A).

The Court rejects the structural argument\nhere for one, and only one, reason. Indiana, the major-\nity says, “treats violations of subsections (b)(1)(A) and\n(b)(1)(B) as crimes of the same magnitude”: They are both\nclass D felonies carrying the same punishment.9 See also\n——————\nmay elect to use a lower grade of vehicular flight when he could use a\nhigher one, either as a matter of discretion or because the defendant\nentered into a plea bargain. This case provides one example, see ante,\nat 4 (majority opinion), and JUSTICE THOMAS offers several others, see\nante, at 6–7. But as everyone agrees, what matters in determining\nwhether an offense qualifies under ACCA’s residual clause is the\n“ordinary case” of conviction. And in the absence of reliable empirical\nevidence, the structure of the Indiana statute provides the best way to\ndiscern the ordinary case under each subsection.\n   9 The Government spurns the structural argument on a different\n\nground, contending that subsection (b)(1)(A) is not a lesser included\noffense of subsection (b)(1)(B). The Court wisely does not accept this\nclaim. Both subsections (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) involve the use of a\nvehicle to flee, with subsection (b)(1)(B) additionally requiring that this\nuse “creat[e] a substantial risk of bodily injury.” So a fleeing driver\nwho violates subsection (b)(1)(B) necessarily runs afoul of subsection\n(b)(1)(A) as well. The Government contends, in response, that a person\ncan violate subsection (b)(1)(B) and not (b)(1)(A) by engaging in conduct\nother than vehicular flight. See Brief for United States 48–49, n. 11.\nThat is because subsection (b)(1)(B) additionally prohibits “obstruct\n[ing]” or “resist[ing]” a police officer by a variety of means, including\nthrough use of a vehicle. But Indiana law makes clear that subsec\ntion (b)(1)(A) still counts as a lesser included offense of subsection\n(b)(1)(B) in any prosecution involving vehicular flight. See Wright v.\nState, 658 N. E. 2d 563, 566–567 (Ind. 1995) (holding a crime to be a\nlesser included offense if its elements are “factually” subsumed within\nanother offense). And even if that were not the case, it should make no\ndifference. The meaningful question for purposes of ACCA is whether\nsubsection (b)(1)(B)’s prohibition of aggravated vehicular flight indi\ncates that subsection (b)(1)(A) targets simple vehicular flight.

But\nthe Court is wrong to think that fact dispositive.\n   In general, “similar punishment does not necessarily\nimply similar risk” (or similar violence). James, 550 U. S.,\nat 217 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Because this is so, the\nCourt has never suggested that all state offenses falling\nwithin a single felony class and subject to the same penal\nties must receive the same treatment under ACCA. To the\ncontrary, we have always focused on the “conduct encom\npassed by the elements of the offense,” id., at 208 (major\nity opinion)—an inquiry that does not mention the of\nfense’s sentencing consequences. And that is for good\nreason. It would be quite remarkable if either all or none\nof Indiana’s (or any State’s) class D felonies satisfied the\nrequirements of the residual clause. In Indiana, other\nsuch felonies, subject to “the same magnitude” of punish\nment, ante, at 12, include election fraud, computer tam\npering, and “cemetery mischief.” See Ind. Code §3–14–2–1\net seq. (2009); §35–43–1–4; §35–43–1–2.1. I presume the\nCourt does not also intend to treat these offenses as vio\nlent felonies under ACCA.\n   Moreover, Indiana sentencing law has always enabled\njudges to take account of the difference between subsec\ntions (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) in imposing punishment. As\nthe majority notes, ante, at 12, Indiana provides for a\nrange of prison terms for class D felonies, stretching\nfrom six months to three years. And in deciding what\nterm to impose (or whether to suspend the term), courts\nmay consider an array of aggravating factors—including\nwhether the crime “threatened serious harm to per-\nsons,” §35–38–1–7.1(b)(1). Convictions under subsections\n(b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) therefore may produce widely vary\ning sentences, as judges respond to the different forms\n—————— \n\nperson can violate subsection (b)(1)(B) by means independent of any\n\nvehicular flight has no bearing on that question. \n\n12                  SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n of vehicular flight targeted by the offenses.\n   The Court argues, in support of its position, that the\n“similarity in punishment” reveals that the conduct falling\nwithin subsection (b)(1)(A) is “rough[ly] equivalent,” in\nterms of risk, to the conduct falling within subsection\n(b)(1)(B). Ante, at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted);\nsee also ante, at 10–11 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judg\nment). More specifically, the Court claims that the Indi\nana Legislature added subsection (b)(1)(A) to the statute\nin 1998 because it determined that vehicular flight is per\nse risky—and that all such flight therefore deserves the\nsame punishment as is meted out to the various non-flight\nconduct that subsection (b)(1)(B) prohibits upon a showing\nof risk. See ante, at 12; see also n. 9, supra. But that\nargument disregards the legislature’s decision to criminal\nize vehicular flight in both provisions—that is, to retain\nsubsection (b)(1)(B)’s prohibition on risky vehicular flight\nalongside subsection (b)(1)(A)’s ban on simple flight. In\neffect, the Court reads subsection (b)(1)(A) as including all\nvehicular flight and subsection (b)(1)(B) as including only\nthe other (non-flight) things it mentions—even though\nsubsection (b)(1)(B) specifically bars “flee[ing] from a law\nenforcement officer . . . in a manner that creates a sub\nstantial risk of bodily injury.”\n   Perhaps the Court assumes that the Indiana Legisla\nture, in enacting subsection (b)(1)(A), simply forgot to\nremove the reference to vehicular flight in subsection\n(b)(1)(B). Cf. ante, at 10 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judg\nment) (acknowledging superfluity). But if so, the legis\nlature forgot four more times to correct its error, as it\nserially amended and re-amended its vehicular-flight stat-\nute over the last 13 years.10 And more fundamentally, a\n——————\n  10 See 2011 Ind.

See 1998 Ind. Acts\n677–678. So Indiana’s decision to create that offense in\nsubsection (b)(1)(A)—and to distinguish it from the more\naggravated forms of vehicular flight already penalized\nunder subsections (b)(1)(B), (b)(2), and (b)(3)—brought\nthe State’s vehicular-flight statute into conformity with\nthe prevailing approach used nationwide. Especially given\nthat backdrop, I would not impute shoddy draftsmanship\nto the Indiana Legislature. I would heed what that body\nsaid, rather than assume (just because it made both of\nfenses class D felonies) that it must have meant something\ndifferent. And what the legislature said is that vehicular\nflight comes in different forms—one posing substantial\nrisk of injury (subsection (b)(1)(B)) and one not (subsection\n(b)(1)(A)).\n   The best that can be said for the Court’s approach is\nthat it is very narrow—indeed, that it decides almost no\ncase other than this one. As noted above, see supra, at 10,\nthe Court reserves the question whether a vehicular flight\nprovision like subsection (b)(1)(A) is a crime of violence\nunder ACCA “where that offense carries a less severe\npenalty than [a greater] offense that includes it.” Ante, at\n13. But as fate would have it, that reservation describes\nthe great majority of vehicular flight statutes across the\ncountry. Indiana is idiosyncratic in this respect; other\nStates not only separately prohibit, but also differently\npunish, simple and aggravated vehicular flight.11 Or\n——————\n  11 See, e.g., Fla. Stat. §316.1935 (2010); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann.\n\n§257.602a (West 2010); Minn. Stat. §609.487 (2009); N. J. Stat. Ann.\n§2C:29–2 (West Supp. 2011); S. C. Code Ann. §56–5–750 (2006); Tenn.\n14                SYKES v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nperhaps I should say Indiana was idiosyncratic. That is\nbecause in 2006, a few years after Sykes’s conviction,\nIndiana amended its vehicular flight statute to set differ\nent penalties for violations of subsections (b)(1)(A) and\n(b)(1)(B). A person who violates subsection (b)(1)(B) today\nfaces a mandatory 30-day sentence that cannot be sus\npended; that sentence rises to six months or one year\nfor repeat offenders. See Ind. Code §35–44–3–3(d). By\ncontrast, a person who violates subsection (b)(1)(A), even\nmore than once, is not subject to any mandatory jail time.\nSee §35–44–3–3(d). So by its own terms, the Court’s\nopinion—our fourth applying ACCA’s residual clause in as\nmany years—applies only to a single State’s vehicular\nflight statute as it existed from 1998 to 2006. Cf. ante, at\n7 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“[W]e will be doing ad hoc appli\ncation of ACCA . . . until the cows come home”).\n                         *     *     *\n   The Indiana statute before us creates a series of escalat\ning offenses dividing the universe of vehicular flight into\ndiscrete categories. One of those categories, subsection\n(b)(1)(B), requires proof that the defendant operated “a\nvehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of\nbodily injury.” That phrase tracks the language that\nACCA’s residual clause uses to define a crime of violence.\nOther provisions in the Indiana statute demand even\nmore—actual injury or death. In stark contrast, subsec\ntion (b)(1)(A), the least severe of the State’s vehicular\nflight offenses and the one of which Sykes was convicted,\nlacks any element relating to threat of physical injury. In\ndeciding this case, I would respect that statutory differ\nence. And because I would take the Indiana Legislature\nat its word, I respectfully dissent.\n\n——————\nCode Ann. §39–16–603 (Supp. 2011); Tex.
