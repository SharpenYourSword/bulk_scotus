Argued December 7, 2010—Decided June 13, 2011\nRespondent First Derivative Traders (First Derivative), representing a\n  class of stockholders in petitioner Janus Capital Group, Inc. (JCG),\n  filed this private action under Securities and Exchange Commission\n  (SEC) Rule 10b–5, which forbids “any person . . . [t]o make any un\n  true statement of a material fact” in connection with the purchase or\n  sale of securities. The complaint alleged, inter alia, that JCG and its\n  wholly owned subsidiary, petitioner Janus Capital Management LLC\n  (JCM), made false statements in mutual fund prospectuses filed by\n  Janus Investment Fund—for which JCM was the investment adviser\n  and administrator—and that those statements affected the price of\n  JCG’s stock. Although JCG created Janus Investment Fund, it is a\n  separate legal entity owned entirely by mutual fund investors. The\n  District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.\n  The Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that First Derivative had suffi\n  ciently alleged that JCG and JCM, by participating in the writing\n  and dissemination of the prospectuses, made the misleading state\n  ments contained in the documents. Before this Court, First Deriva\n  tive continues to argue that JCM made the statements but seeks to\n  hold JCG liable only as a control person of JCM under §20(a).\nHeld: Because the false statements included in the prospectuses were\n made by Janus Investment Fund, not by JCM, JCM and JCG cannot\n be held liable in a private action under Rule 10b–5. Pp. 5–12.\n    (a) Although neither Rule 10b–5 nor the statute it interprets,\n §10(b) of the Act, expressly creates a private right of action, such an\n “action is implied under §10(b).” Superintendent of Ins. of N.

S. 148, 165, but, in analyzing the question at is\n    sue, the Court is mindful that it must give “narrow dimensions . . . to\n    a right . . . Congress did not authorize when it first enacted the stat\n    ute and did not expand when it revisited” it, id., at 167. Pp. 5–10.\n         (1) For Rule 10b–5 purposes, the maker of a statement is the\n    person or entity with ultimate authority over the statement, includ\n    ing its content and whether and how to communicate it. Without\n    control, a person or entity can merely suggest what to say, not\n    “make” a statement in its own right. This rule follows from Central\n    Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511\n    U. S. 164, 180, which held that Rule 10b–5’s private right of action\n    does not include suits against aiders and abettors who contribute\n    “substantial assistance” to the making of a statement but do not ac\n    tually make it. Reading “make” more broadly, to include persons or\n    entities lacking ultimate control over a statement, would substan\n    tially undermine Central Bank by rendering aiders and abettors al\n    most nonexistent. The Court’s interpretation is also suggested by\n    Stoneridge, 552 U. S., at 161, and accords with the narrow scope that\n    must be given the implied private right of action, id., at 167. Pp. 6–8.\n         (2) The Court rejects the Government’s contention that “make”\n    should be defined as “create,” thereby allowing private plaintiffs to\n    sue a person who provides the false or misleading information that\n    another person puts into a statement. Adopting that definition would\n    be inconsistent with Stoneridge, supra, at 161, which rejected a pri\n    vate Rule 10b–5 suit against companies involved in deceptive trans\n    actions, even when information about those transactions was later\n    incorporated into false public statements. First Derivative notes the\n    uniquely close relationship between a mutual fund and its invest\n    ment adviser, but the corporate formalities were observed, and reap\n    portionment of liability in light of this close relationship is properly\n    the responsibility of Congress, not the courts. Furthermore, First\n    Derivative’s rule would read into Rule 10b–5 a theory of liability\n    similar to—but broader than—control-person liability under §20(a).\n    Pp. 8–10.\n       (b) Although JCM may have been significantly involved in prepar\n    ing the prospectuses, it did not itself “make” the statements at issue\n    for Rule 10b–5 purposes. Its assistance in crafting what was said\n    was subject to Janus Investment Fund’s ultimate control.

Rule 10b–5 prohibits “mak[ing] any untrue\nstatement of a material fact” in connection with the pur\nchase or sale of securities. 17 CFR §240.10b–5 (2010). We\nconclude that JCM cannot be held liable because it did not\nmake the statements in the prospectuses.\n                            I\n  Janus Capital Group, Inc. (JCG), is a publicly traded\ncompany that created the Janus family of mutual funds.\nThese mutual funds are organized in a Massachusetts\nbusiness trust, the Janus Investment Fund. Janus In\nvestment Fund retained JCG’s wholly owned subsidiary,\nJCM, to be its investment adviser and administrator. JCG\nand JCM are the petitioners here.\n  Although JCG created Janus Investment Fund, Janus\nInvestment Fund is a separate legal entity owned entirely\n2      JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                        TRADERS                                              \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nby mutual fund investors. Janus Investment Fund has no\nassets apart from those owned by the investors. JCM\nprovides Janus Investment Fund with investment advi\nsory services, which include “the management and admin\nistrative services necessary for the operation of [Janus]\nFun[d],” App. 225a, but the two entities maintain legal\nindependence. At all times relevant to this case, all of\nthe officers of Janus Investment Fund were also officers of\nJCM, but only one member of Janus Investment Fund’s\nboard of trustees was associated with JCM. This is more\nindependence than is required: By statute, up to 60 per\ncent of the board of a mutual fund may be composed of\n“interested persons.” See 54 Stat. 806, as amended, 15\nU. S. C. §80a–10(a); see also 15 U. S. C. A. §80a–2(a)(19)\n(2009 ed. and Feb. 2011 Supp.) (defining “interested\nperson”).\n   As the securities laws require, Janus Investment Fund\nissued prospectuses describing the investment strategy\nand operations of its mutual funds to investors. See 15\nU. S. C. §§77b(a)(10), 77e(b)(2), 80a–8(b), 80a–2(a)(31),\n80a–29(a)–(b). The prospectuses for several funds repre\nsented that the funds were not suitable for market timing\nand can be read to suggest that JCM would implement\npolicies to curb the practice.1 For example, the Janus\n——————\n  1 Market timing is a trading strategy that exploits time delay in mu\n\ntual funds’ daily valuation system. The price for buying or selling\nshares of a mutual fund is ordinarily determined by the next net asset\nvalue (NAV) calculation after the order is placed. The NAV calculation\nusually happens once a day, at the close of the major U. S. markets.\nBecause of certain time delays, however, the values used in these\ncalculations do not always accurately reflect the true value of the\nunderlying assets. For example, a fund may value its foreign securities\nbased on the price at the close of the foreign market, which may have\noccurred several hours before the calculation. But events might have\ntaken place after the close of the foreign market that could be expected\nto affect their price. If the event were expected to increase the price of\nthe foreign securities, a market-timing investor could buy shares of a\n                    Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                  3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nMercury Fund prospectus dated February 25, 2002, stated\nthat the fund was “not intended for market timing or\nexcessive trading” and represented that it “may reject any\npurchase request . . . if it believes that any combination of\ntrading activity is attributable to market timing or is\notherwise excessive or potentially disruptive to the Fund.”\nApp. 141a. Although market timing is legal, it harms\nother investors in the mutual fund.\n   In September 2003, the Attorney General of the State of\nNew York filed a complaint against JCG and JCM alleging\nthat JCG entered into secret arrangements to permit\nmarket timing in several funds run by JCM. After the\ncomplaint’s allegations became public, investors withdrew\nsignificant amounts of money from the Janus Investment\nFund mutual funds.2 Because Janus Investment Fund\ncompensated JCM based on the total value of the funds\nand JCM’s management fees comprised a significant\npercentage of JCG’s income, Janus Investment Fund’s loss\nof value affected JCG’s value as well. JCG’s stock price\nfell nearly 25 percent, from $17.68 on September 2 to\n$13.50 on September 26.\n   Respondent First Derivative Traders (First Derivative)\nrepresents a class of plaintiffs who owned JCG stock as of\nSeptember 3, 2003. Its complaint asserts claims against\nJCG and JCM for violations of Rule 10b–5 and §10(b) of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 891, as\namended, 15 U. S. C. §78j(b). First Derivative alleges that\nJCG and JCM “caused mutual fund prospectuses to be\nissued for Janus mutual funds and made them available to\n——————\nmutual fund at the artificially low NAV and sell the next day when the\nNAV corrects itself upward. See Disclosure Regarding Market Timing\nand Selective Disclosure of Portfolio Holdings, 68 Fed. Reg. 70402\n(proposed Dec. 17, 2003).\n  2 In 2004, JCG and JCM settled these allegations and agreed to re\n\nduce their fees by $125 million and pay $50 million in civil penalties\nand $50 million in disgorgement to the mutual fund investors.\n4      JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v.

The complaint also alleges that JCG\nshould be held liable for the acts of JCM as a “controlling\nperson” under 15 U. S. C. A. §78t(a) (Feb. 2011 Supp.)\n(§20(a) of the Act).\n   The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to\nstate a claim.3 In re Mutual Funds Inv.

The Court of Appeals\nfor the Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that First Deriva\ntive had sufficiently alleged that “JCG and JCM, by par\nticipating in the writing and dissemination of the prospec\ntuses, made the misleading statements contained in the\ndocuments.” In re Mutual Funds Inv. Litigation, 566 F. 3d\n111, 121 (2009) (emphasis in original).

Id., at 128, 129–130.\n                             II\n   We granted certiorari to address whether JCM can be\nheld liable in a private action under Rule 10b–5 for false\nstatements included in Janus Investment Fund’s pro\nspectuses. 561 U.

[t]o\nmake any untrue statement of a material fact” in connec\ntion with the purchase or sale of securities. 17 CFR\n§240.10b–5(b).4 To be liable, therefore, JCM must have\n“made” the material misstatements in the prospectuses.\nWe hold that it did not.5\n                            A\n  The SEC promulgated Rule 10b–5 pursuant to authority\ngranted under §10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, 15 U. S. C. §78j(b). Although neither Rule 10b–5\nnor §10(b) expressly creates a private right of action, this\nCourt has held that “a private right of action is implied\nunder §10(b).” Superintendent of Ins. of N. Y. v.

The\nonly question we must answer, therefore, is whether JCM made the\nmisstatements. Whether First Derivative has stated a claim against\nJCG as a control person depends on whether it has stated a claim\nagainst JCM.\n6     JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                       TRADERS                                \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U. S. 148, 165\n(2008), but “[c]oncerns with the judicial creation of a pri\nvate cause of action caution against its expansion,” ibid.\nThus, in analyzing whether JCM “made” the statements\nfor purposes of Rule 10b–5, we are mindful that we must\ngive “narrow dimensions . . . to a right of action Congress\ndid not authorize when it first enacted the statute and did\nnot expand when it revisited the law.” Id., at 167.\n                              1\n  One “makes” a statement by stating it. When “make” is\npaired with a noun expressing the action of a verb, the\nresulting phrase is “approximately equivalent in sense” to\nthat verb. 6 Oxford English Dictionary 66 (def. 59) (1933)\n(hereinafter OED); accord, Webster’s New International\nDictionary 1485 (def. 43) (2d ed. 1934) (“Make followed by\na noun with the indefinite article is often nearly equiva\nlent to the verb intransitive corresponding to that noun”).\nFor instance, “to make a proclamation” is the approximate\nequivalent of “to proclaim,” and “to make a promise” ap\nproximates “to promise.” See 6 OED 66 (def. 59). The\nphrase at issue in Rule 10b–5, “[t]o make any . . . state\nment,” is thus the approximate equivalent of “to state.”\n  For purposes of Rule 10b–5, the maker of a statement is\nthe person or entity with ultimate authority over the\nstatement, including its content and whether and how to\ncommunicate it. Without control, a person or entity can\nmerely suggest what to say, not “make” a statement in its\nown right. One who prepares or publishes a statement on\nbehalf of another is not its maker. And in the ordinary\ncase, attribution within a statement or implicit from sur\nrounding circumstances is strong evidence that a state\nment was made by—and only by—the party to whom it is\nattributed. This rule might best be exemplified by the\nrelationship between a speechwriter and a speaker. Even\nwhen a speechwriter drafts a speech, the content is en\n                      Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntirely within the control of the person who delivers it. And\nit is the speaker who takes credit—or blame—for what is\nultimately said.\n   This rule follows from Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v.\nFirst Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164\n(1994), in which we held that Rule 10b–5’s private right of\naction does not include suits against aiders and abettors.\nSee id., at 180. Such suits—against entities that contrib\nute “substantial assistance” to the making of a statement\nbut do not actually make it—may be brought by the SEC,\nsee 15 U. S. C. A. §78t(e), but not by private parties. A\nbroader reading of “make,” including persons or entities\nwithout ultimate control over the content of a statement,\nwould substantially undermine Central Bank. If persons\nor entities without control over the content of a statement\ncould be considered primary violators who “made” the\nstatement, then aiders and abettors would be almost\nnonexistent.6\n   This interpretation is further supported by our recent\ndecision in Stoneridge. There, investors sued “entities\nwho, acting both as customers and suppliers, agreed to\narrangements that allowed the investors’ company to\nmislead its auditor and issue a misleading financial\nstatement.” 552 U. S., at 152–153. We held that dis\nmissal of the complaint was proper because the public\n——————\n  6 The dissent correctly notes that Central Bank involved secondary,\n\nnot primary, liability. Post, at 4 (opinion of BREYER, J.). But for Cen\ntral Bank to have any meaning, there must be some distinction be\ntween those who are primarily liable (and thus may be pursued in\nprivate suits) and those who are secondarily liable (and thus may not\nbe pursued in private suits).\n  We draw a clean line between the two—the maker is the person or\nentity with ultimate authority over a statement and others are not. In\ncontrast, the dissent’s only limit on primary liability is not much of a\nlimit at all. It would allow for primary liability whenever “[t]he specific\nrelationships alleged . . . warrant [that] conclusion”—whatever that\nmay mean. Post, at 11.\n8      JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                        TRADERS                                     \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\ncould not have relied on the entities’ undisclosed deceptive\nacts. Id., at 166–167. Significantly, in reaching that\nconclusion we emphasized that “nothing [the defendants]\ndid made it necessary or inevitable for [the company] to\nrecord the transactions as it did.” Id., at 161.7 This em\nphasis suggests the rule we adopt today: that the maker of\na statement is the entity with authority over the content\nof the statement and whether and how to communicate it.\nWithout such authority, it is not “necessary or inevitable”\nthat any falsehood will be contained in the statement.\n  Our holding also accords with the narrow scope that we\nmust give the implied private right of action.

This definition, although perhaps\nappropriate when “make” is directed at an object unasso\nciated with a verb (e.g., “to make a chair”), fails to capture\nits meaning when directed at an object expressing the\naction of a verb.\n   Adopting the Government’s definition of “make” would\nalso lead to results inconsistent with our precedent.

Only Janus Investment Fund—not\nJCM—bears the statutory obligation to file the prospec\ntuses with the SEC. 15 U. S. C. §§77e(b)(2), 80a–8(b),\n80a–29(a)–(b); see also 17 CFR §230.497 (imposing re\nquirements on “investment companies”). The SEC has\nrecorded that Janus Investment Fund filed the prospec\ntuses. See JIF Group1 Standalone Prospectuses (Feb. 25,\n2002), online at http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/\n277751 / 000027775102000049 / 0000277751-02-000049.txt\n(as visited June 10, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s\ncase file) (recording the “Filer” of the Janus Mercury Fund\nprospectus as “Janus Investment Fund”). There is no\nallegation that JCM in fact filed the prospectuses and\nfalsely attributed them to Janus Investment Fund. Nor\ndid anything on the face of the prospectuses indicate that\nany statements therein came from JCM rather than Janus\nInvestment Fund—a legally independent entity with its\nown board of trustees.11\n——————\n  11 First Derivative suggests that “indirectly” in Rule 10b–5 may\n\nbroaden the meaning of “make.” We disagree. The phrase “directly or\nindirectly” is set off by itself in Rule 10b–5 and modifies not just “to\nmake,” but also “to employ” and “to engage.” We think the phrase\nmerely clarifies that as long as a statement is made, it does not matter\nwhether the statement was communicated directly or indirectly to the\nrecipient. A different understanding of “indirectly” would, like a broad\ndefinition of “make,” threaten to erase the line between primary viola\ntors and aiders and abettors established by Central Bank.\n  In this case, we need not define precisely what it means to communi\ncate a “made” statement indirectly because none of the statements in\nthe prospectuses were attributed, explicitly or implicitly, to JCM.\nWithout attribution, there is no indication that Janus Investment Fund\nwas quoting or otherwise repeating a statement originally “made” by\nJCM. Cf. Anixter v. Home-Stake Production Co., 77 F. 3d 1215, 1220, and\nn. 4 (CA10 1996) (quoting a signed “ ‘Auditor’s Report’ ” included in a pro\nspectus); Basic, supra, at 227, n. 4 (quoting a news item reporting a state\nment by Basic’s president). More may be required to find that a person\nor entity made a statement indirectly, but attribution is necessary.\n12     JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v.

But this assistance, subject to the ultimate control\nof Janus Investment Fund, does not mean that JCM\n“made” any statements in the prospectuses. Although\nJCM, like a speechwriter, may have assisted Janus In\nvestment Fund with crafting what Janus Investment\nFund said in the prospectuses, JCM itself did not “make”\nthose statements for purposes of Rule 10b–5.12\n                      *    *    *\n  The statements in the Janus Investment Fund prospec\ntuses were made by Janus Investment Fund, not by JCM.\nAccordingly, First Derivative has not stated a claim\nagainst JCM under Rule 10b–5. The judgment of the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is\nreversed.\n                                         It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  12 That JCM provided access to Janus Investment Fund’s prospec\n\ntuses on its Web site is also not a basis for liability. Merely hosting a\ndocument on a Web site does not indicate that the hosting entity adopts\nthe document as its own statement or exercises control over its content.\nCf. United States v. Ware, 577 F. 3d 442, 448 (CA2 2009) (involving the\nissuance of false press releases through innocent companies). In doing\nso, we do not think JCM made any of the statements in Janus Invest\nment Fund’s prospectuses for purposes of Rule 10b–5 liability, just as\nwe do not think that the SEC “makes” the statements in the many\nprospectuses available on its Web site.\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

The inves­\ntors claim that Janus Management knowingly made mate­\nrially false or misleading statements that appeared in\nprospectuses issued by the Janus Fund. They say that\nthey relied upon those statements, and that they suffered\nresulting economic harm.\n  Janus Management and the Janus Fund are closely\nrelated. Each of the Fund’s officers is a Janus Manage­\nment employee. Janus Management, acting through those\nemployees (and other of its employees), manages the\npurchase, sale, redemption, and distribution of the Fund’s\ninvestments. Janus Management prepares, modifies, and\nimplements the Janus Fund’s long-term strategies. And\nJanus Management, acting through those employees,\ncarries out the Fund’s daily activities.\n  Rule 10b–5 says in relevant part that it is unlawful for\n“any person, directly or indirectly . . .

See also 15 U. S. C. §78j(b) (§10(b) of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934). The specific legal\nquestion before us is whether Janus Management can be\nheld responsible under the Rule for having “ma[d]e” cer­\ntain false statements about the Janus Fund’s activities.\nThe statements in question appear in the Janus Fund’s\nprospectuses.\n  The Court holds that only the Janus Fund, not Janus\nManagement, could have “ma[d]e” those statements. The\nmajority points out that the Janus Fund’s board of trus­\ntees has “ultimate authority” over the content of the\nstatements in a Fund prospectus. And in the majority’s\nview, only “the person or entity with ultimate authority\nover the statement, including its content and whether and\nhow to communicate it” can “make” a statement within the\nterms of Rule 10b–5. Ante, at 6.\n  In my view, however, the majority has incorrectly inter­\npreted the Rule’s word “make.” Neither common English\nnor this Court’s earlier cases limit the scope of that\nword to those with “ultimate authority” over a statement’s\ncontent. To the contrary, both language and case law\nindicate that, depending upon the circumstances, a man­\nagement company, a board of trustees, individual company\nofficers, or others, separately or together, might “make”\nstatements contained in a firm’s prospectus—even if a\nboard of directors has ultimate content-related responsi­\nbility. And the circumstances here are such that a court\ncould find that Janus Management made the statements\nin question.\n                            I\n  Respondent’s complaint sets forth the basic elements\nof a typical Rule 10b–5 “fraud on the market” claim. It\nalleges that Janus Management made statements that\n“created the misleading impression that” it “would\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

The\ncomplaint adds that Janus Management knew that these\n“market timing” statements were false; that the\nstatements were material; that the market, in pricing\nsecurities (including related securities) relied upon the\nstatements; that as a result, when the truth came out\n(that Janus Management indeed permitted “market\ntiming” in the Janus Fund), the price of relevant shares\nfell; and the false statements thereby caused respondent\nsignificant economic losses. Complaint ¶¶4–10, id., at\n60a–63a. Cf. Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v.\nScientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U. S. 148, 157 (2008) (identi­\nfying the elements of “a typical §10(b) private action”).\n   The majority finds the complaint fatally flawed,\nhowever, because (1) Rule 10b–5 says that no “person”\nshall “directly or indirectly . . . make any untrue statement\nof a material fact,” (2) the statements at issue appeared in\nthe Janus Fund’s prospectuses, and (3) only “the person or\nentity with ultimate authority over the statement, includ­\ning its content and whether and how to communicate it”\ncan “make” a false statement. Ante, at 2–3, 5–6.\n   But where can the majority find legal support for the\nrule that it enunciates? The English language does not\nimpose upon the word “make” boundaries of the kind the\nmajority finds determinative. Every day, hosts of corpo­\nrate officials make statements with content that more\nsenior officials or the board of directors have “ultimate\nauthority” to control. So do cabinet officials make state­\nments about matters that the Constitution places within\nthe ultimate authority of the President. So do thousands,\nperhaps millions, of other employees make statements\nthat, as to content, form, or timing, are subject to the\ncontrol of another.\n   Nothing in the English language prevents one from\n4     JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                       TRADERS                              \n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nsaying that several different individuals, separately or\ntogether, “make” a statement that each has a hand in\nproducing. For example, as a matter of English, one can\nsay that a national political party has made a statement\neven if the only written communication consists of uniform\npress releases issued in the name of local party branches;\none can say that one foreign nation has made a statement\neven when the officials of a different nation (subject to its\ninfluence) speak about the matter; and one can say that\nthe President has made a statement even if his press\nofficer issues a communication, sometimes in the press\nofficer’s own name. Practical matters related to context,\nincluding control, participation, and relevant audience,\nhelp determine who “makes” a statement and to whom\nthat statement may properly be “attributed,” see ante, at\n11, n. 11—at least as far as ordinary English is concerned.\n  Neither can the majority find support in any relevant\nprecedent. The majority says that its rule “follows from\nCentral Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of\nDenver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164 (1994),” in which the Court\n“held that Rule 10b–5’s private right of action does not\ninclude suits against aiders and abettors.” Ante, at 7. But\nCentral Bank concerns a different matter. And it no more\nrequires the majority’s rule than free air travel for small\nchildren requires free air travel for adults.\n  Central Bank is a case about secondary liability, liability\nattaching, not to an individual making a false statement,\nbut to an individual helping someone else do so. Central\nBank involved a bond issuer accused of having made\nmaterially false statements, which overstated the values\nof property that backed the bonds. Central Bank also\ninvolved a defendant that was a bank, serving as inden­\nture trustee, which was supposed to check the bond is­\nsuer’s valuations. The plaintiffs claimed that the bank\ndelayed its valuation checks and thereby helped the issuer\nmake its false statements credible. The question before\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthe Court concerned the bank’s liability—a secondary\nliability for “aiding and abetting” the bond issuer, who (on\nthe theory set forth) was primarily liable.\n   The Court made this clear. The question presented was\n“whether private civil liability under §10(b) extends . . . to\nthose who do not engage in the manipulative or deceptive\npractice, but who aid and abet the violation.” 511 U. S., at\n167 (emphasis added). The Court wrote that “aiding and\nabetting liability reaches persons who do not engage in the\nproscribed activities at all, but who give a degree of aid to\nthose who do.” Id., at 176 (emphasis added). The Court\ndescribed civil law “aiding and abetting” as “ ‘know[ing]\nthat the other’s conduct constitutes a breach of duty and\ngiv[ing] substantial assistance or encouragement to the\nother . . . .’ ” Id., at 181 (quoting Restatement (Second) of\nTorts §876(b) (1977); emphasis added). And it reviewed a\nCourt of Appeals decision that had defined the elements of\naiding and abetting as “(1) a primary violation of §10(b);\n(2) recklessness by the aider and abettor as to the exis­\ntence of the primary violation; and (3) substantial assis\ntance given to the primary violator by the aider and abet­\ntor.” 511 U. S., at 168 (emphasis added). Faced with this\nquestion, the Court answered that §10(b) and Rule 10b–5\ndo not provide for this kind of “aiding and abetting” liabil­\nity in private suits.\n   By way of contrast, the present case is about primary\nliability—about individuals who allegedly themselves\n“make” materially false statements, not about those who\nhelp others to do so. The question is whether Janus Man­\nagement is primarily liable for violating the Act, not\nwhether it simply helped others violate the Act. The\nCentral Bank defendant concededly did not make the false\nstatements in question (others did), while here the defen­\ndants allegedly did make those statements. And a rule\n(the majority’s rule) absolving those who allegedly did\nmake false statements does not “follow from” a rule (Cen\n6     JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                       TRADERS                                    \n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ntral Bank’s rule) absolving those who concededly did not\ndo so.\n  The majority adds that to interpret the word “make” as\nincluding those “without ultimate control over the content\nof a statement” would “substantially undermine” Central\nBank’s holding. Ante, at 7. Would it? The Court in Cen\ntral Bank specifically wrote that its holding did\n    “not mean that secondary actors in the securities\n    markets are always free from liability under the secu­\n    rities Acts. Any person or entity, including a lawyer,\n    accountant, or bank, who employs a manipulative de­\n    vice or makes a material misstatement (or omission)\n    on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies may\n    be liable as a primary violator under 10b–5, assuming\n    all of the requirements for primary liability under\n    Rule 10b–5 are met.” 511 U. S., at 191 (some empha­\n    sis added).\nThus, as far as Central Bank is concerned, depending upon\nthe circumstances, board members, senior firm officials,\nofficials tasked to develop a marketing document, large\ninvestors, or others (taken together or separately) all\nmight “make” materially false statements subjecting\nthemselves to primary liability. The majority’s rule does\nnot protect, it extends, Central Bank’s holding of no­\nliability into new territory that Central Bank explicitly\nplaced outside that holding. And by ignoring the language\nin which Central Bank did so, the majority’s rule itself\nundermines Central Bank. Where is the legal support for\nthe majority’s “draw[ing] a clean line,” ante, at 7, n. 6, that\nso seriously conflicts with Central Bank? Indeed, where is\nthe legal support for the majority’s suggestion that plain­\ntiffs must show some kind of “attribution” of a statement\nto a defendant, ante, at 11, n. 11—if it means plaintiffs\nmust show, not only that the defendant “ma[d]e” the\nstatement, but something more?\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

In Stoneridge, firms that supplied\nelectronic equipment to a cable television company agreed\nwith the cable television company to enter into a series of\nfraudulent sales and purchases, for example, a sale at an\nunusually high price, thereby providing funds which the\nsuppliers would use to buy advertising from the cable\ntelevision company. These arrangements enabled the\ncable television company to fool its accountants (and\nultimately the public) into believing that it had more\nrevenue (for example, advertising revenue) than it really\nhad. As part of the agreement, the companies exchanged\nletters and backdated contracts to conceal the fraud.\nInvestors subsequently sued the cable television company,\nsome of its officers, its auditors, and the equipment\nsuppliers, as well, claiming that all of them had engaged\nin a scheme to defraud securities purchasers. In respect to\nmost of the defendants, investors identified allegedly\nmaterially false statements contained in the cable\ntelevision company’s financial statements or similar docu-\nments. But in respect to the equipment suppliers, in­\nvestors claimed that the relevant deceptive conduct was\nin the letters, backdated contracts, and related oral\nconversations about the scheme. The investors argued\nthat the equipment suppliers, “by participating in the\ntransactions,” violated §10(b) and Rule 10b–5. Stoneridge,\n552 U. S., at 155.\n  The Court held that the equipment suppliers could not\nbe found liable for securities fraud in a private suit under\n§10(b). But in doing so, it did not deny that the equipment\nsuppliers had made the false statements contained in the\nletters, contracts, and conversations. See id., at 158–159.\nRather, the Court said the issue in the case was whether\n“any deceptive statement or act respondents made was not\nactionable because it did not have the requisite proximate\nrelation to the investors’ harm.” Ibid. (emphasis added).\n8     JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v.

And the Court\nwent on to say that “as a result,” the investors “cannot\nshow reliance upon any” of the equipment suppliers’\nactions, “except in an indirect chain that we find too\nremote for liability.” Ibid. The Court concluded,\n    “[the equipment suppliers’] deceptive acts, which were\n    not disclosed to the investing public, are too remote to\n    satisfy the requirement of reliance. It was [the cable\n    company], not [the equipment suppliers], that misled\n    its auditor and filed fraudulent financial statements;\n    nothing [the equipment suppliers] did made it\n    necessary or inevitable for [the cable company] to\n    record the transactions as it did.” Id., at 161.\nInsofar as the equipment suppliers’ conduct was at issue,\nthe fraudulent “arrangement . . . took place in the\nmarketplace for goods and services, not in the investment\nsphere.” Id., at 166.\n  It is difficult for me to see how Stoneridge “support[s]”\nthe majority’s rule. Ante, at 7. No one in Stoneridge\ndisputed the making of the relevant statements, the\nfraudulent contracts and the like.        And no one in\nStoneridge contended that the equipment suppliers were,\nin fact, the makers of the cable company’s misstatements.\nRather, Stoneridge was concerned with whether the\nequipment suppliers’ separate statements were sufficiently\ndisclosed in the securities marketplace so as to be the\nbasis for investor reliance. They were not. But this is a\ndifferent inquiry than whether statements acknowledged\nto have been disclosed in the securities marketplace and\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

How then does Stoneridge support the\nmajority’s new rule?\n  The majority adds that its rule is necessary to avoid “a\ntheory of liability similar to—but broader in application\nthan”—§20(a)’s liability, for “ ‘[e]very person who, directly\nor indirectly, controls any person liable’ ” for violations of\nthe securities laws. Ante, at 10 (quoting 15 U. S. C. A.\n§78t(a) (Feb. 2011 Supp.)). But that is not so. This Court\nhas explained that the possibility of an express remedy\nunder the securities laws does not preclude a claim under\n§10(b). Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375,\n388 (1983).\n  More importantly, a person who is liable under §20(a)\ncontrols another “person” who is “liable” for a securities\nviolation. Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561\nU. S. ___, ___, n. 2 (2010) (slip op., at 3, n. 2) (“Liability\nunder §20(a) is obviously derivative of liability under some\nother provision of the Exchange Act”). We here examine\nwhether a person is primarily liable whether they do, or\nthey do not, control another person who is liable. That is\nto say, here, the liability of some “other person” is not at\nissue.\n  And there is at least one significant category of cases\nthat §10(b) may address that derivative forms of liability,\nsuch as under §20(a), cannot, namely, cases in which one\nactor exploits another as an innocent intermediary for its\nmisstatements. Here, it may well be that the Fund’s\nboard of trustees knew nothing about the falsity of the\nprospectuses. See, e.g., In re Lammert, Release No. 348,\n93 S. E. C. Docket 5676, 5700 (2008) (Janus Management\nwas aware of market timing in the Janus Fund no later\nthan 2002, but “[t]his knowledge was never shared with\nthe Board”). And if so, §20(a) would not apply.\n  The possibility of guilty management and innocent\nboard is the 13th stroke of the new rule’s clock. What is to\n10    JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                       TRADERS                                \n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nhappen when guilty management writes a prospectus (for\nthe board) containing materially false statements and\nfools both board and public into believing they are true?\nApparently under the majority’s rule, in such circum­\nstances no one could be found to have “ma[d]e” a ma-\nterially false statement—even though under the common\nlaw the managers would likely have been guilty or liable\n(in analogous circumstances) for doing so as principals\n(and not as aiders and abettors). See, e.g., 2 W. LaFave,\nSubstantive Criminal Law §13.1(a) (2d ed. 2003); 1 M.\nHale, Pleas of the Crown 617 (1736); Perkins, Parties to\nCrime, 89 U. Pa. L. Rev. 581, 583 (1941) (one is guilty as a\nprincipal when one uses an innocent third party to commit\na crime); Restatement (Second) of Torts §533 (1976). Cf.\nUnited States v. Giles, 300 U. S. 41, 48–49 (1937).\n   Indeed, under the majority’s rule it seems unlikely that\nthe SEC itself in such circumstances could exercise the\nauthority Congress has granted it to pursue primary\nviolators who “make” false statements or the authority\nthat Congress has specifically provided to prosecute aiders\nand abettors to securities violations. See §104, 109 Stat.\n757 (codified at 15 U. S. C. A. §78t(e) (Feb. 2011 Supp.))\n(granting SEC authority to prosecute aiders and abettors).\nThat is because the managers, not having “ma[d]e” the\nstatement, would not be liable as principals and there\nwould be no other primary violator they might have\ntried to “aid” or “abet.” Ibid.; SEC v. DiBella, 587 F. 3d\n553, 566 (CA2 2009) (prosecution for aiding and abet-\nting requires primary violation to which offender gave\n“substantial assistance” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n   If the majority believes, as its footnote hints, that §20(b)\ncould provide a basis for liability in this case, ante, at 10,\nn. 10, then it should remand the case for possible amend­\nment of the complaint. “There is a dearth of authority\nconstruing Section 20(b),” which has been thought largely\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Hence respondent, who reasonably thought that it\nreferred to the proper securities law provision, is faultless\nfor failing to mention §20(b) as well.\n  In sum, I can find nothing in §10(b) or in Rule 10b–5, its\nlanguage, its history, or in precedent suggesting that\nCongress, in enacting the securities laws, intended a\nloophole of the kind that the majority’s rule may well\ncreate.\n                              II\n  Rejecting the majority’s rule, of course, does not decide\nthe question before us. We must still determine whether,\nin light of the complaint’s allegations, Janus Management\ncould have “ma[d]e” the false statements in the\nprospectuses at issue. In my view, the answer to this\nquestion is “Yes.”      The specific relationships alleged\namong Janus Management, the Janus Fund, and the\nprospectus statements warrant the conclusion that Janus\nManagement did “make” those statements.\n  In part, my conclusion reflects the fact that this Court\nand lower courts have made clear that at least sometimes\ncorporate officials and others can be held liable under Rule\n10b–5 for having “ma[d]e” a materially false statement\neven when that statement appears in a document (or is\nmade by a third person) that the officials do not legally\ncontrol. In Herman & MacLean, for example, this Court\npointed out that “certain individuals who play a part in\npreparing the registration statement,” including corporate\nofficers, lawyers, and accountants, may be primarily liable\neven where “they are not named as having prepared or\ncertified” the registration statement. 459 U. S., at 386, n.\n22. And as I have already pointed out, this Court wrote in\nCentral Bank that a “lawyer, accountant, or bank, who . . .\nmakes a material misstatement (or omission) on which a\n12    JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                       TRADERS                                  \n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\npurchaser or seller of securities relies may be liable as a\nprimary violator under 10b–5, assuming all of the re­\nquirements for primary liability under Rule 10b–5 are\nmet.” 511 U. S., at 191 (some emphasis added).\n   Given the statements in our opinions, it is not surpris­\ning that lower courts have found primary liability for\nactors without “ultimate authority” over issued state­\nments. One court, for example, concluded that an ac­\ncountant could be primarily liable for having “ma[d]e”\nfalse statements, where he issued fraudulent opinion and\ncertification letters reproduced in prospectuses, annual\nreports, and other corporate materials for which he was\nnot ultimately responsible.        Anixter v. Home-Stake\nProduction Co., 77 F. 3d 1215, 1225–1227 (CA10 1996). In\na later case postdating Stoneridge, that court reaffirmed\nthat an outside consultant could be primarily liable for\nhaving “ma[d]e” false statements, where he drafted\nfraudulent quarterly and annual filing statements later\nreviewed and certified by the firm’s auditor, officers, and\ncounsel. SEC v. Wolfson, 539 F. 3d 1249, 1261 (CA10\n2008). And another court found that a corporation’s chief\nfinancial officer could be held primarily liable as having\n“ma[d]e” misstatements that appeared in a form 10–K\nthat she prepared but did not sign or file. McConville v.\nSEC, 465 F. 3d 780, 787 (CA7 2006).\n   One can also easily find lower court cases explaining\nthat corporate officials may be liable for having “ma[d]e”\nfalse statements where those officials use innocent\npersons as conduits through which the false statements\nreach the public (without necessarily attributing the false\nstatements to the officials). See, e.g., In re Navarre Corp.\nSecurities Litigation, 299 F. 3d 735, 743 (CA8 2002) (liabil­\nity may be premised on use of analysts as a conduit to\ncommunicate false statements to market); In re Cabletron\nSystems, Inc., 311 F. 3d 11, 38 (CA1 2002) (rejecting a test\nrequiring legal “control” over third parties making state­\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

The complaint states that\n“Janus Management, as investment advisor to the funds,\nis responsible for the day-to-day management of its\ninvestment portfolio and other business affairs of the\nfunds. Janus Management furnishes advice and recom­\nmendations concerning the funds’ investments, as well as\nadministrative, compliance and accounting services for the\nfunds.” Complaint ¶18, App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a.

Argued December 7, 2010—Decided June 13, 2011\nRespondent First Derivative Traders (First Derivative), representing a\n  class of stockholders in petitioner Janus Capital Group, Inc. (JCG),\n  filed this private action under Securities and Exchange Commission\n  (SEC) Rule 10b–5, which forbids “any person . . . [t]o make any un\n  true statement of a material fact” in connection with the purchase or\n  sale of securities. The complaint alleged, inter alia, that JCG and its\n  wholly owned subsidiary, petitioner Janus Capital Management LLC\n  (JCM), made false statements in mutual fund prospectuses filed by\n  Janus Investment Fund—for which JCM was the investment adviser\n  and administrator—and that those statements affected the price of\n  JCG’s stock. Although JCG created Janus Investment Fund, it is a\n  separate legal entity owned entirely by mutual fund investors. The\n  District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.\n  The Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that First Derivative had suffi\n  ciently alleged that JCG and JCM, by participating in the writing\n  and dissemination of the prospectuses, made the misleading state\n  ments contained in the documents. Before this Court, First Deriva\n  tive continues to argue that JCM made the statements but seeks to\n  hold JCG liable only as a control person of JCM under §20(a).\nHeld: Because the false statements included in the prospectuses were\n made by Janus Investment Fund, not by JCM, JCM and JCG cannot\n be held liable in a private action under Rule 10b–5.

S. 148, 165, but, in analyzing the question at is\n    sue, the Court is mindful that it must give “narrow dimensions . . . to\n    a right . . . Congress did not authorize when it first enacted the stat\n    ute and did not expand when it revisited” it, id., at 167. Pp. 5–10.\n         (1) For Rule 10b–5 purposes, the maker of a statement is the\n    person or entity with ultimate authority over the statement, includ\n    ing its content and whether and how to communicate it. Without\n    control, a person or entity can merely suggest what to say, not\n    “make” a statement in its own right. This rule follows from Central\n    Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511\n    U. S. 164, 180, which held that Rule 10b–5’s private right of action\n    does not include suits against aiders and abettors who contribute\n    “substantial assistance” to the making of a statement but do not ac\n    tually make it. Reading “make” more broadly, to include persons or\n    entities lacking ultimate control over a statement, would substan\n    tially undermine Central Bank by rendering aiders and abettors al\n    most nonexistent. The Court’s interpretation is also suggested by\n    Stoneridge, 552 U. S., at 161, and accords with the narrow scope that\n    must be given the implied private right of action, id., at 167. Pp. 6–8.\n         (2) The Court rejects the Government’s contention that “make”\n    should be defined as “create,” thereby allowing private plaintiffs to\n    sue a person who provides the false or misleading information that\n    another person puts into a statement. Adopting that definition would\n    be inconsistent with Stoneridge, supra, at 161, which rejected a pri\n    vate Rule 10b–5 suit against companies involved in deceptive trans\n    actions, even when information about those transactions was later\n    incorporated into false public statements. First Derivative notes the\n    uniquely close relationship between a mutual fund and its invest\n    ment adviser, but the corporate formalities were observed, and reap\n    portionment of liability in light of this close relationship is properly\n    the responsibility of Congress, not the courts. Furthermore, First\n    Derivative’s rule would read into Rule 10b–5 a theory of liability\n    similar to—but broader than—control-person liability under §20(a).\n    Pp. 8–10.\n       (b) Although JCM may have been significantly involved in prepar\n    ing the prospectuses, it did not itself “make” the statements at issue\n    for Rule 10b–5 purposes. Its assistance in crafting what was said\n    was subject to Janus Investment Fund’s ultimate control.

Rule 10b–5 prohibits “mak[ing] any untrue\nstatement of a material fact” in connection with the pur\nchase or sale of securities. 17 CFR §240.10b–5 (2010). We\nconclude that JCM cannot be held liable because it did not\nmake the statements in the prospectuses.\n                            I\n  Janus Capital Group, Inc. (JCG), is a publicly traded\ncompany that created the Janus family of mutual funds.\nThese mutual funds are organized in a Massachusetts\nbusiness trust, the Janus Investment Fund. Janus In\nvestment Fund retained JCG’s wholly owned subsidiary,\nJCM, to be its investment adviser and administrator. JCG\nand JCM are the petitioners here.\n  Although JCG created Janus Investment Fund, Janus\nInvestment Fund is a separate legal entity owned entirely\n2      JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                        TRADERS                                              \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nby mutual fund investors. Janus Investment Fund has no\nassets apart from those owned by the investors. JCM\nprovides Janus Investment Fund with investment advi\nsory services, which include “the management and admin\nistrative services necessary for the operation of [Janus]\nFun[d],” App. 225a, but the two entities maintain legal\nindependence. At all times relevant to this case, all of\nthe officers of Janus Investment Fund were also officers of\nJCM, but only one member of Janus Investment Fund’s\nboard of trustees was associated with JCM. This is more\nindependence than is required: By statute, up to 60 per\ncent of the board of a mutual fund may be composed of\n“interested persons.” See 54 Stat. 806, as amended, 15\nU. S. C. §80a–10(a); see also 15 U. S. C. A. §80a–2(a)(19)\n(2009 ed. and Feb. 2011 Supp.) (defining “interested\nperson”).\n   As the securities laws require, Janus Investment Fund\nissued prospectuses describing the investment strategy\nand operations of its mutual funds to investors. See 15\nU. S. C. §§77b(a)(10), 77e(b)(2), 80a–8(b), 80a–2(a)(31),\n80a–29(a)–(b). The prospectuses for several funds repre\nsented that the funds were not suitable for market timing\nand can be read to suggest that JCM would implement\npolicies to curb the practice.1 For example, the Janus\n——————\n  1 Market timing is a trading strategy that exploits time delay in mu\n\ntual funds’ daily valuation system. The price for buying or selling\nshares of a mutual fund is ordinarily determined by the next net asset\nvalue (NAV) calculation after the order is placed. The NAV calculation\nusually happens once a day, at the close of the major U. S. markets.\nBecause of certain time delays, however, the values used in these\ncalculations do not always accurately reflect the true value of the\nunderlying assets. For example, a fund may value its foreign securities\nbased on the price at the close of the foreign market, which may have\noccurred several hours before the calculation. But events might have\ntaken place after the close of the foreign market that could be expected\nto affect their price.

Although market timing is legal, it harms\nother investors in the mutual fund.\n   In September 2003, the Attorney General of the State of\nNew York filed a complaint against JCG and JCM alleging\nthat JCG entered into secret arrangements to permit\nmarket timing in several funds run by JCM. After the\ncomplaint’s allegations became public, investors withdrew\nsignificant amounts of money from the Janus Investment\nFund mutual funds.2 Because Janus Investment Fund\ncompensated JCM based on the total value of the funds\nand JCM’s management fees comprised a significant\npercentage of JCG’s income, Janus Investment Fund’s loss\nof value affected JCG’s value as well. JCG’s stock price\nfell nearly 25 percent, from $17.68 on September 2 to\n$13.50 on September 26.\n   Respondent First Derivative Traders (First Derivative)\nrepresents a class of plaintiffs who owned JCG stock as of\nSeptember 3, 2003. Its complaint asserts claims against\nJCG and JCM for violations of Rule 10b–5 and §10(b) of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 891, as\namended, 15 U. S. C. §78j(b). First Derivative alleges that\nJCG and JCM “caused mutual fund prospectuses to be\nissued for Janus mutual funds and made them available to\n——————\nmutual fund at the artificially low NAV and sell the next day when the\nNAV corrects itself upward. See Disclosure Regarding Market Timing\nand Selective Disclosure of Portfolio Holdings, 68 Fed. Reg. 70402\n(proposed Dec. 17, 2003).\n  2 In 2004, JCG and JCM settled these allegations and agreed to re\n\nduce their fees by $125 million and pay $50 million in civil penalties\nand $50 million in disgorgement to the mutual fund investors.\n4      JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v.

The\nonly question we must answer, therefore, is whether JCM made the\nmisstatements. Whether First Derivative has stated a claim against\nJCG as a control person depends on whether it has stated a claim\nagainst JCM.\n6     JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                       TRADERS                                \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U. S. 148, 165\n(2008), but “[c]oncerns with the judicial creation of a pri\nvate cause of action caution against its expansion,” ibid.\nThus, in analyzing whether JCM “made” the statements\nfor purposes of Rule 10b–5, we are mindful that we must\ngive “narrow dimensions . . . to a right of action Congress\ndid not authorize when it first enacted the statute and did\nnot expand when it revisited the law.” Id., at 167.\n                              1\n  One “makes” a statement by stating it. When “make” is\npaired with a noun expressing the action of a verb, the\nresulting phrase is “approximately equivalent in sense” to\nthat verb. 6 Oxford English Dictionary 66 (def. 59) (1933)\n(hereinafter OED); accord, Webster’s New International\nDictionary 1485 (def. 43) (2d ed. 1934) (“Make followed by\na noun with the indefinite article is often nearly equiva\nlent to the verb intransitive corresponding to that noun”).\nFor instance, “to make a proclamation” is the approximate\nequivalent of “to proclaim,” and “to make a promise” ap\nproximates “to promise.” See 6 OED 66 (def. 59). The\nphrase at issue in Rule 10b–5, “[t]o make any . . . state\nment,” is thus the approximate equivalent of “to state.”\n  For purposes of Rule 10b–5, the maker of a statement is\nthe person or entity with ultimate authority over the\nstatement, including its content and whether and how to\ncommunicate it. Without control, a person or entity can\nmerely suggest what to say, not “make” a statement in its\nown right. One who prepares or publishes a statement on\nbehalf of another is not its maker. And in the ordinary\ncase, attribution within a statement or implicit from sur\nrounding circumstances is strong evidence that a state\nment was made by—and only by—the party to whom it is\nattributed. This rule might best be exemplified by the\nrelationship between a speechwriter and a speaker. Even\nwhen a speechwriter drafts a speech, the content is en\n                      Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntirely within the control of the person who delivers it. And\nit is the speaker who takes credit—or blame—for what is\nultimately said.\n   This rule follows from Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v.\nFirst Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164\n(1994), in which we held that Rule 10b–5’s private right of\naction does not include suits against aiders and abettors.\nSee id., at 180. Such suits—against entities that contrib\nute “substantial assistance” to the making of a statement\nbut do not actually make it—may be brought by the SEC,\nsee 15 U. S. C. A. §78t(e), but not by private parties. A\nbroader reading of “make,” including persons or entities\nwithout ultimate control over the content of a statement,\nwould substantially undermine Central Bank. If persons\nor entities without control over the content of a statement\ncould be considered primary violators who “made” the\nstatement, then aiders and abettors would be almost\nnonexistent.6\n   This interpretation is further supported by our recent\ndecision in Stoneridge. There, investors sued “entities\nwho, acting both as customers and suppliers, agreed to\narrangements that allowed the investors’ company to\nmislead its auditor and issue a misleading financial\nstatement.” 552 U. S., at 152–153. We held that dis\nmissal of the complaint was proper because the public\n——————\n  6 The dissent correctly notes that Central Bank involved secondary,\n\nnot primary, liability. Post, at 4 (opinion of BREYER, J.). But for Cen\ntral Bank to have any meaning, there must be some distinction be\ntween those who are primarily liable (and thus may be pursued in\nprivate suits) and those who are secondarily liable (and thus may not\nbe pursued in private suits).\n  We draw a clean line between the two—the maker is the person or\nentity with ultimate authority over a statement and others are not. In\ncontrast, the dissent’s only limit on primary liability is not much of a\nlimit at all. It would allow for primary liability whenever “[t]he specific\nrelationships alleged . . . warrant [that] conclusion”—whatever that\nmay mean. Post, at 11.\n8      JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v.

Id., at 166–167. Significantly, in reaching that\nconclusion we emphasized that “nothing [the defendants]\ndid made it necessary or inevitable for [the company] to\nrecord the transactions as it did.” Id., at 161.7 This em\nphasis suggests the rule we adopt today: that the maker of\na statement is the entity with authority over the content\nof the statement and whether and how to communicate it.\nWithout such authority, it is not “necessary or inevitable”\nthat any falsehood will be contained in the statement.\n  Our holding also accords with the narrow scope that we\nmust give the implied private right of action. Id., at 167.\nAlthough the existence of the private right is now settled,\nwe will not expand liability beyond the person or entity\nthat ultimately has authority over a false statement.\n                               2\n   The Government contends that “make” should be de\nfined as “create.” Brief for United States as Amicus Cu\nriae 14–15 (citing Webster’s New International Dictionary\n1485 (2d ed. 1958) (defining “make” as “[t]o cause to exist,\nappear, or occur”)). This definition, although perhaps\nappropriate when “make” is directed at an object unasso\nciated with a verb (e.g., “to make a chair”), fails to capture\nits meaning when directed at an object expressing the\naction of a verb.\n   Adopting the Government’s definition of “make” would\nalso lead to results inconsistent with our precedent. The\nGovernment’s definition would permit private plaintiffs to\nsue a person who “provides the false or misleading infor\nmation that another person then puts into the statement.”\n——————\n  7 We agree that “no one in Stoneridge contended that the equipment\n\nsuppliers were, in fact, the makers of the cable company’s misstate\nments.” Post, at 8. If Stoneridge had addressed whether the equipment\nsuppliers were “makers,” today’s decision would be unnecessary. The\npoint is that Stoneridge’s analysis suggests that they were not.\n                      Cite as: 564 U.

S., at 161. We\nsee no reason to treat participating in the drafting of a\nfalse statement differently from engaging in deceptive\ntransactions, when each is merely an undisclosed act\npreceding the decision of an independent entity to make a\npublic statement.\n  For its part, First Derivative suggests that the “well\nrecognized and uniquely close relationship between a\nmutual fund and its investment adviser” should inform\nour decision. Brief for Respondent 21. It suggests that an\ninvestment adviser should generally be understood to be\nthe “maker” of statements by its client mutual fund, like\na playwright whose lines are delivered by an actor.

We note, however, that we have previously expressed skepti\ncism over the degree to which the SEC should receive deference regard\ning the private right of action. See Piper v. Chris-Craft Industries, Inc.,\n430 U.

C. §80a–10.9 Any reapportionment of liability in\nthe securities industry in light of the close relationship\nbetween investment advisers and mutual funds is properly\nthe responsibility of Congress and not the courts. More\nover, just as with the Government’s theory, First Deriva\ntive’s rule would create the broad liability that we rejected\nin Stoneridge.\n   Congress also has established liability in §20(a) for\n“[e]very person who, directly or indirectly, controls any\nperson liable” for violations of the securities laws. 15\nU. S. C. A. §78t(a). First Derivative’s theory of liability\nbased on a relationship of influence resembles the liability\nimposed by Congress for control. To adopt First Deriva\ntive’s theory would read into Rule 10b–5 a theory of liabil\nity similar to—but broader in application than, see post, at\n9—what Congress has already created expressly else\nwhere.10 We decline to do so.\n                             B\n     Under this rule, JCM did not “make” any of the state\n——————\n  9 Nor  does First Derivative contend that any statements made by\nJCM to Janus Investment Fund were “public statements” for the\npurposes of Basic Inc. v.

C. §§77e(b)(2), 80a–8(b),\n80a–29(a)–(b); see also 17 CFR §230.497 (imposing re\nquirements on “investment companies”). The SEC has\nrecorded that Janus Investment Fund filed the prospec\ntuses. See JIF Group1 Standalone Prospectuses (Feb. 25,\n2002), online at http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/\n277751 / 000027775102000049 / 0000277751-02-000049.txt\n(as visited June 10, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s\ncase file) (recording the “Filer” of the Janus Mercury Fund\nprospectus as “Janus Investment Fund”). There is no\nallegation that JCM in fact filed the prospectuses and\nfalsely attributed them to Janus Investment Fund. Nor\ndid anything on the face of the prospectuses indicate that\nany statements therein came from JCM rather than Janus\nInvestment Fund—a legally independent entity with its\nown board of trustees.11\n——————\n  11 First Derivative suggests that “indirectly” in Rule 10b–5 may\n\nbroaden the meaning of “make.” We disagree. The phrase “directly or\nindirectly” is set off by itself in Rule 10b–5 and modifies not just “to\nmake,” but also “to employ” and “to engage.” We think the phrase\nmerely clarifies that as long as a statement is made, it does not matter\nwhether the statement was communicated directly or indirectly to the\nrecipient. A different understanding of “indirectly” would, like a broad\ndefinition of “make,” threaten to erase the line between primary viola\ntors and aiders and abettors established by Central Bank.\n  In this case, we need not define precisely what it means to communi\ncate a “made” statement indirectly because none of the statements in\nthe prospectuses were attributed, explicitly or implicitly, to JCM.\nWithout attribution, there is no indication that Janus Investment Fund\nwas quoting or otherwise repeating a statement originally “made” by\nJCM. Cf. Anixter v. Home-Stake Production Co., 77 F. 3d 1215, 1220, and\nn. 4 (CA10 1996) (quoting a signed “ ‘Auditor’s Report’ ” included in a pro\nspectus); Basic, supra, at 227, n. 4 (quoting a news item reporting a state\nment by Basic’s president). More may be required to find that a person\nor entity made a statement indirectly, but attribution is necessary.\n12     JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v.

But this assistance, subject to the ultimate control\nof Janus Investment Fund, does not mean that JCM\n“made” any statements in the prospectuses. Although\nJCM, like a speechwriter, may have assisted Janus In\nvestment Fund with crafting what Janus Investment\nFund said in the prospectuses, JCM itself did not “make”\nthose statements for purposes of Rule 10b–5.12\n                      *    *    *\n  The statements in the Janus Investment Fund prospec\ntuses were made by Janus Investment Fund, not by JCM.\nAccordingly, First Derivative has not stated a claim\nagainst JCM under Rule 10b–5. The judgment of the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is\nreversed.\n                                         It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  12 That JCM provided access to Janus Investment Fund’s prospec\n\ntuses on its Web site is also not a basis for liability. Merely hosting a\ndocument on a Web site does not indicate that the hosting entity adopts\nthe document as its own statement or exercises control over its content.\nCf. United States v. Ware, 577 F. 3d 442, 448 (CA2 2009) (involving the\nissuance of false press releases through innocent companies). In doing\nso, we do not think JCM made any of the statements in Janus Invest\nment Fund’s prospectuses for purposes of Rule 10b–5 liability, just as\nwe do not think that the SEC “makes” the statements in the many\nprospectuses available on its Web site.\n                  Cite as: 564 U.

The specific legal\nquestion before us is whether Janus Management can be\nheld responsible under the Rule for having “ma[d]e” cer­\ntain false statements about the Janus Fund’s activities.\nThe statements in question appear in the Janus Fund’s\nprospectuses.\n  The Court holds that only the Janus Fund, not Janus\nManagement, could have “ma[d]e” those statements. The\nmajority points out that the Janus Fund’s board of trus­\ntees has “ultimate authority” over the content of the\nstatements in a Fund prospectus. And in the majority’s\nview, only “the person or entity with ultimate authority\nover the statement, including its content and whether and\nhow to communicate it” can “make” a statement within the\nterms of Rule 10b–5. Ante, at 6.\n  In my view, however, the majority has incorrectly inter­\npreted the Rule’s word “make.” Neither common English\nnor this Court’s earlier cases limit the scope of that\nword to those with “ultimate authority” over a statement’s\ncontent. To the contrary, both language and case law\nindicate that, depending upon the circumstances, a man­\nagement company, a board of trustees, individual company\nofficers, or others, separately or together, might “make”\nstatements contained in a firm’s prospectus—even if a\nboard of directors has ultimate content-related responsi­\nbility. And the circumstances here are such that a court\ncould find that Janus Management made the statements\nin question.\n                            I\n  Respondent’s complaint sets forth the basic elements\nof a typical Rule 10b–5 “fraud on the market” claim. It\nalleges that Janus Management made statements that\n“created the misleading impression that” it “would\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

The\ncomplaint adds that Janus Management knew that these\n“market timing” statements were false; that the\nstatements were material; that the market, in pricing\nsecurities (including related securities) relied upon the\nstatements; that as a result, when the truth came out\n(that Janus Management indeed permitted “market\ntiming” in the Janus Fund), the price of relevant shares\nfell; and the false statements thereby caused respondent\nsignificant economic losses. Complaint ¶¶4–10, id., at\n60a–63a. Cf. Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v.\nScientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U. S. 148, 157 (2008) (identi­\nfying the elements of “a typical §10(b) private action”).\n   The majority finds the complaint fatally flawed,\nhowever, because (1) Rule 10b–5 says that no “person”\nshall “directly or indirectly . . . make any untrue statement\nof a material fact,” (2) the statements at issue appeared in\nthe Janus Fund’s prospectuses, and (3) only “the person or\nentity with ultimate authority over the statement, includ­\ning its content and whether and how to communicate it”\ncan “make” a false statement. Ante, at 2–3, 5–6.\n   But where can the majority find legal support for the\nrule that it enunciates? The English language does not\nimpose upon the word “make” boundaries of the kind the\nmajority finds determinative. Every day, hosts of corpo­\nrate officials make statements with content that more\nsenior officials or the board of directors have “ultimate\nauthority” to control. So do cabinet officials make state­\nments about matters that the Constitution places within\nthe ultimate authority of the President. So do thousands,\nperhaps millions, of other employees make statements\nthat, as to content, form, or timing, are subject to the\ncontrol of another.\n   Nothing in the English language prevents one from\n4     JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v.

For example, as a matter of English, one can\nsay that a national political party has made a statement\neven if the only written communication consists of uniform\npress releases issued in the name of local party branches;\none can say that one foreign nation has made a statement\neven when the officials of a different nation (subject to its\ninfluence) speak about the matter; and one can say that\nthe President has made a statement even if his press\nofficer issues a communication, sometimes in the press\nofficer’s own name. Practical matters related to context,\nincluding control, participation, and relevant audience,\nhelp determine who “makes” a statement and to whom\nthat statement may properly be “attributed,” see ante, at\n11, n. 11—at least as far as ordinary English is concerned.\n  Neither can the majority find support in any relevant\nprecedent. The majority says that its rule “follows from\nCentral Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of\nDenver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164 (1994),” in which the Court\n“held that Rule 10b–5’s private right of action does not\ninclude suits against aiders and abettors.” Ante, at 7. But\nCentral Bank concerns a different matter. And it no more\nrequires the majority’s rule than free air travel for small\nchildren requires free air travel for adults.\n  Central Bank is a case about secondary liability, liability\nattaching, not to an individual making a false statement,\nbut to an individual helping someone else do so. Central\nBank involved a bond issuer accused of having made\nmaterially false statements, which overstated the values\nof property that backed the bonds. Central Bank also\ninvolved a defendant that was a bank, serving as inden­\nture trustee, which was supposed to check the bond is­\nsuer’s valuations. The plaintiffs claimed that the bank\ndelayed its valuation checks and thereby helped the issuer\nmake its false statements credible. The question before\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthe Court concerned the bank’s liability—a secondary\nliability for “aiding and abetting” the bond issuer, who (on\nthe theory set forth) was primarily liable.\n   The Court made this clear. The question presented was\n“whether private civil liability under §10(b) extends . . . to\nthose who do not engage in the manipulative or deceptive\npractice, but who aid and abet the violation.” 511 U. S., at\n167 (emphasis added). The Court wrote that “aiding and\nabetting liability reaches persons who do not engage in the\nproscribed activities at all, but who give a degree of aid to\nthose who do.” Id., at 176 (emphasis added). The Court\ndescribed civil law “aiding and abetting” as “ ‘know[ing]\nthat the other’s conduct constitutes a breach of duty and\ngiv[ing] substantial assistance or encouragement to the\nother . . . .’ ” Id., at 181 (quoting Restatement (Second) of\nTorts §876(b) (1977); emphasis added). And it reviewed a\nCourt of Appeals decision that had defined the elements of\naiding and abetting as “(1) a primary violation of §10(b);\n(2) recklessness by the aider and abettor as to the exis­\ntence of the primary violation; and (3) substantial assis\ntance given to the primary violator by the aider and abet­\ntor.” 511 U. S., at 168 (emphasis added). Faced with this\nquestion, the Court answered that §10(b) and Rule 10b–5\ndo not provide for this kind of “aiding and abetting” liabil­\nity in private suits.\n   By way of contrast, the present case is about primary\nliability—about individuals who allegedly themselves\n“make” materially false statements, not about those who\nhelp others to do so. The question is whether Janus Man­\nagement is primarily liable for violating the Act, not\nwhether it simply helped others violate the Act. The\nCentral Bank defendant concededly did not make the false\nstatements in question (others did), while here the defen­\ndants allegedly did make those statements. And a rule\n(the majority’s rule) absolving those who allegedly did\nmake false statements does not “follow from” a rule (Cen\n6     JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                       TRADERS                                    \n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ntral Bank’s rule) absolving those who concededly did not\ndo so.\n  The majority adds that to interpret the word “make” as\nincluding those “without ultimate control over the content\nof a statement” would “substantially undermine” Central\nBank’s holding. Ante, at 7. Would it? The Court in Cen\ntral Bank specifically wrote that its holding did\n    “not mean that secondary actors in the securities\n    markets are always free from liability under the secu­\n    rities Acts. Any person or entity, including a lawyer,\n    accountant, or bank, who employs a manipulative de­\n    vice or makes a material misstatement (or omission)\n    on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies may\n    be liable as a primary violator under 10b–5, assuming\n    all of the requirements for primary liability under\n    Rule 10b–5 are met.” 511 U. S., at 191 (some empha­\n    sis added).\nThus, as far as Central Bank is concerned, depending upon\nthe circumstances, board members, senior firm officials,\nofficials tasked to develop a marketing document, large\ninvestors, or others (taken together or separately) all\nmight “make” materially false statements subjecting\nthemselves to primary liability. The majority’s rule does\nnot protect, it extends, Central Bank’s holding of no­\nliability into new territory that Central Bank explicitly\nplaced outside that holding. And by ignoring the language\nin which Central Bank did so, the majority’s rule itself\nundermines Central Bank. Where is the legal support for\nthe majority’s “draw[ing] a clean line,” ante, at 7, n. 6, that\nso seriously conflicts with Central Bank? Indeed, where is\nthe legal support for the majority’s suggestion that plain­\ntiffs must show some kind of “attribution” of a statement\nto a defendant, ante, at 11, n. 11—if it means plaintiffs\nmust show, not only that the defendant “ma[d]e” the\nstatement, but something more?\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n  The majority also refers to Stoneridge, but that case\noffers it no help. In Stoneridge, firms that supplied\nelectronic equipment to a cable television company agreed\nwith the cable television company to enter into a series of\nfraudulent sales and purchases, for example, a sale at an\nunusually high price, thereby providing funds which the\nsuppliers would use to buy advertising from the cable\ntelevision company. These arrangements enabled the\ncable television company to fool its accountants (and\nultimately the public) into believing that it had more\nrevenue (for example, advertising revenue) than it really\nhad. As part of the agreement, the companies exchanged\nletters and backdated contracts to conceal the fraud.\nInvestors subsequently sued the cable television company,\nsome of its officers, its auditors, and the equipment\nsuppliers, as well, claiming that all of them had engaged\nin a scheme to defraud securities purchasers. In respect to\nmost of the defendants, investors identified allegedly\nmaterially false statements contained in the cable\ntelevision company’s financial statements or similar docu-\nments. But in respect to the equipment suppliers, in­\nvestors claimed that the relevant deceptive conduct was\nin the letters, backdated contracts, and related oral\nconversations about the scheme. The investors argued\nthat the equipment suppliers, “by participating in the\ntransactions,” violated §10(b) and Rule 10b–5. Stoneridge,\n552 U. S., at 155.\n  The Court held that the equipment suppliers could not\nbe found liable for securities fraud in a private suit under\n§10(b). But in doing so, it did not deny that the equipment\nsuppliers had made the false statements contained in the\nletters, contracts, and conversations. See id., at 158–159.\nRather, the Court said the issue in the case was whether\n“any deceptive statement or act respondents made was not\nactionable because it did not have the requisite proximate\nrelation to the investors’ harm.” Ibid. (emphasis added).\n8     JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                       TRADERS                                  \n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nAnd it held that these deceptive statements or actions\ncould not provide a basis for liability because the investors\ncould not prove sufficient reliance upon the particular\nfalse statements that the equipment suppliers had made.\n  The Court pointed out that the equipment suppliers\n“had no duty to disclose; and their deceptive acts were not\ncommunicated to the public.” Id., at 159. And the Court\nwent on to say that “as a result,” the investors “cannot\nshow reliance upon any” of the equipment suppliers’\nactions, “except in an indirect chain that we find too\nremote for liability.” Ibid. The Court concluded,\n    “[the equipment suppliers’] deceptive acts, which were\n    not disclosed to the investing public, are too remote to\n    satisfy the requirement of reliance. It was [the cable\n    company], not [the equipment suppliers], that misled\n    its auditor and filed fraudulent financial statements;\n    nothing [the equipment suppliers] did made it\n    necessary or inevitable for [the cable company] to\n    record the transactions as it did.” Id., at 161.\nInsofar as the equipment suppliers’ conduct was at issue,\nthe fraudulent “arrangement . . . took place in the\nmarketplace for goods and services, not in the investment\nsphere.” Id., at 166.\n  It is difficult for me to see how Stoneridge “support[s]”\nthe majority’s rule. Ante, at 7. No one in Stoneridge\ndisputed the making of the relevant statements, the\nfraudulent contracts and the like.        And no one in\nStoneridge contended that the equipment suppliers were,\nin fact, the makers of the cable company’s misstatements.\nRather, Stoneridge was concerned with whether the\nequipment suppliers’ separate statements were sufficiently\ndisclosed in the securities marketplace so as to be the\nbasis for investor reliance. They were not. But this is a\ndifferent inquiry than whether statements acknowledged\nto have been disclosed in the securities marketplace and\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nripe for reliance can be said to have been “ma[d]e” by one\nor another actor. How then does Stoneridge support the\nmajority’s new rule?\n  The majority adds that its rule is necessary to avoid “a\ntheory of liability similar to—but broader in application\nthan”—§20(a)’s liability, for “ ‘[e]very person who, directly\nor indirectly, controls any person liable’ ” for violations of\nthe securities laws. Ante, at 10 (quoting 15 U. S. C. A.\n§78t(a) (Feb. 2011 Supp.)). But that is not so. This Court\nhas explained that the possibility of an express remedy\nunder the securities laws does not preclude a claim under\n§10(b). Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375,\n388 (1983).\n  More importantly, a person who is liable under §20(a)\ncontrols another “person” who is “liable” for a securities\nviolation. Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561\nU. S. ___, ___, n. 2 (2010) (slip op., at 3, n. 2) (“Liability\nunder §20(a) is obviously derivative of liability under some\nother provision of the Exchange Act”). We here examine\nwhether a person is primarily liable whether they do, or\nthey do not, control another person who is liable. That is\nto say, here, the liability of some “other person” is not at\nissue.\n  And there is at least one significant category of cases\nthat §10(b) may address that derivative forms of liability,\nsuch as under §20(a), cannot, namely, cases in which one\nactor exploits another as an innocent intermediary for its\nmisstatements. Here, it may well be that the Fund’s\nboard of trustees knew nothing about the falsity of the\nprospectuses. See, e.g., In re Lammert, Release No. 348,\n93 S. E. C. Docket 5676, 5700 (2008) (Janus Management\nwas aware of market timing in the Janus Fund no later\nthan 2002, but “[t]his knowledge was never shared with\nthe Board”). And if so, §20(a) would not apply.\n  The possibility of guilty management and innocent\nboard is the 13th stroke of the new rule’s clock. What is to\n10    JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                       TRADERS                                \n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nhappen when guilty management writes a prospectus (for\nthe board) containing materially false statements and\nfools both board and public into believing they are true?\nApparently under the majority’s rule, in such circum­\nstances no one could be found to have “ma[d]e” a ma-\nterially false statement—even though under the common\nlaw the managers would likely have been guilty or liable\n(in analogous circumstances) for doing so as principals\n(and not as aiders and abettors). See, e.g., 2 W. LaFave,\nSubstantive Criminal Law §13.1(a) (2d ed. 2003); 1 M.\nHale, Pleas of the Crown 617 (1736); Perkins, Parties to\nCrime, 89 U. Pa. L. Rev. 581, 583 (1941) (one is guilty as a\nprincipal when one uses an innocent third party to commit\na crime); Restatement (Second) of Torts §533 (1976). Cf.\nUnited States v. Giles, 300 U. S. 41, 48–49 (1937).\n   Indeed, under the majority’s rule it seems unlikely that\nthe SEC itself in such circumstances could exercise the\nauthority Congress has granted it to pursue primary\nviolators who “make” false statements or the authority\nthat Congress has specifically provided to prosecute aiders\nand abettors to securities violations. See §104, 109 Stat.\n757 (codified at 15 U. S. C. A. §78t(e) (Feb. 2011 Supp.))\n(granting SEC authority to prosecute aiders and abettors).\nThat is because the managers, not having “ma[d]e” the\nstatement, would not be liable as principals and there\nwould be no other primary violator they might have\ntried to “aid” or “abet.” Ibid.; SEC v. DiBella, 587 F. 3d\n553, 566 (CA2 2009) (prosecution for aiding and abet-\nting requires primary violation to which offender gave\n“substantial assistance” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n   If the majority believes, as its footnote hints, that §20(b)\ncould provide a basis for liability in this case, ante, at 10,\nn. 10, then it should remand the case for possible amend­\nment of the complaint. “There is a dearth of authority\nconstruing Section 20(b),” which has been thought largely\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Hence respondent, who reasonably thought that it\nreferred to the proper securities law provision, is faultless\nfor failing to mention §20(b) as well.\n  In sum, I can find nothing in §10(b) or in Rule 10b–5, its\nlanguage, its history, or in precedent suggesting that\nCongress, in enacting the securities laws, intended a\nloophole of the kind that the majority’s rule may well\ncreate.\n                              II\n  Rejecting the majority’s rule, of course, does not decide\nthe question before us. We must still determine whether,\nin light of the complaint’s allegations, Janus Management\ncould have “ma[d]e” the false statements in the\nprospectuses at issue. In my view, the answer to this\nquestion is “Yes.”      The specific relationships alleged\namong Janus Management, the Janus Fund, and the\nprospectus statements warrant the conclusion that Janus\nManagement did “make” those statements.\n  In part, my conclusion reflects the fact that this Court\nand lower courts have made clear that at least sometimes\ncorporate officials and others can be held liable under Rule\n10b–5 for having “ma[d]e” a materially false statement\neven when that statement appears in a document (or is\nmade by a third person) that the officials do not legally\ncontrol. In Herman & MacLean, for example, this Court\npointed out that “certain individuals who play a part in\npreparing the registration statement,” including corporate\nofficers, lawyers, and accountants, may be primarily liable\neven where “they are not named as having prepared or\ncertified” the registration statement. 459 U. S., at 386, n.\n22. And as I have already pointed out, this Court wrote in\nCentral Bank that a “lawyer, accountant, or bank, who . . .\nmakes a material misstatement (or omission) on which a\n12    JANUS CAPITAL GROUP, INC. v. FIRST DERIVATIVE \n\n                       TRADERS                                  \n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\npurchaser or seller of securities relies may be liable as a\nprimary violator under 10b–5, assuming all of the re­\nquirements for primary liability under Rule 10b–5 are\nmet.” 511 U. S., at 191 (some emphasis added).\n   Given the statements in our opinions, it is not surpris­\ning that lower courts have found primary liability for\nactors without “ultimate authority” over issued state­\nments. One court, for example, concluded that an ac­\ncountant could be primarily liable for having “ma[d]e”\nfalse statements, where he issued fraudulent opinion and\ncertification letters reproduced in prospectuses, annual\nreports, and other corporate materials for which he was\nnot ultimately responsible.        Anixter v. Home-Stake\nProduction Co., 77 F. 3d 1215, 1225–1227 (CA10 1996). In\na later case postdating Stoneridge, that court reaffirmed\nthat an outside consultant could be primarily liable for\nhaving “ma[d]e” false statements, where he drafted\nfraudulent quarterly and annual filing statements later\nreviewed and certified by the firm’s auditor, officers, and\ncounsel. SEC v. Wolfson, 539 F. 3d 1249, 1261 (CA10\n2008). And another court found that a corporation’s chief\nfinancial officer could be held primarily liable as having\n“ma[d]e” misstatements that appeared in a form 10–K\nthat she prepared but did not sign or file. McConville v.\nSEC, 465 F. 3d 780, 787 (CA7 2006).\n   One can also easily find lower court cases explaining\nthat corporate officials may be liable for having “ma[d]e”\nfalse statements where those officials use innocent\npersons as conduits through which the false statements\nreach the public (without necessarily attributing the false\nstatements to the officials). See, e.g., In re Navarre Corp.\nSecurities Litigation, 299 F. 3d 735, 743 (CA8 2002) (liabil­\nity may be premised on use of analysts as a conduit to\ncommunicate false statements to market); In re Cabletron\nSystems, Inc., 311 F. 3d 11, 38 (CA1 2002) (rejecting a test\nrequiring legal “control” over third parties making state­\n                 Cite as: 564 U.

Supp. 2d 59, 75–\n76 (DC 2008).\n   My conclusion also reflects the particular circumstances\nthat the complaint alleges. The complaint states that\n“Janus Management, as investment advisor to the funds,\nis responsible for the day-to-day management of its\ninvestment portfolio and other business affairs of the\nfunds. Janus Management furnishes advice and recom­\nmendations concerning the funds’ investments, as well as\nadministrative, compliance and accounting services for the\nfunds.” Complaint ¶18, App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a. Each of\nthe Fund’s 17 officers was a vice president of Janus\nManagement. App. 250a–258a. The Fund has “no assets\nseparate and apart from those they hold for shareholders.”\nIn re Mutual Funds Inv. Litigation, 384 F. Supp. 2d 845,\n853, n. 3 (Md. 2005). Janus Management disseminated\nthe fund prospectuses through its parent company’s Web\nsite. Complaint ¶38, App. to Pet. for Cert. 72a. Janus\nManagement employees drafted and reviewed the Fund\nprospectuses, including language about “market timing.”\nComplaint ¶31, id., at 69a; In re Mutual Funds Inv.\nLitigation, 590 F. Supp. 2d 741, 747 (Md. 2008). And\nJanus Management may well have kept the trustees in the\ndark about the true “market timing” facts. Complaint\n¶51, App. to Pet. for Cert. 80a; In re Lammert, 93 S.
