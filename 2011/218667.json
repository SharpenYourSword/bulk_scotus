CARRIGAN\n\n         CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEVADA\n\n       No. 10–568.      Argued April 27, 2011—Decided June 13, 2011\nNevada’s Ethics in Government Law requires public officials to recuse\n themselves from voting on, or advocating the passage or failure of, “a\n matter with respect to which the independence of judgment of a rea\n sonable person in his situation would be materially affected by,” inter\n alia, “[h]is commitment in a private capacity to the interests of oth\n ers,” Nev. Rev. Stat. §281A.420(2) (2007), which includes a “commit\n ment to a [specified] person,” e.g., a member of the officer’s household\n or the officer’s relative, §281A.420(8)(a)–(d), and “[a]ny other com\n mitment or relationship that is substantially similar” to one enumer\n ated in paragraphs (a)–(d), §281A.420(8)(e).\n    Petitioner (Commission) administers and enforces Nevada’s law.\n The Commission investigated respondent Carrigan, an elected local\n official who voted to approve a hotel/casino project proposed by a\n company that used Carrigan’s long-time friend and campaign man\n ager as a paid consultant. The Commission concluded that Carrigan\n had a disqualifying conflict of interest under §281A.420(8)(e)’s catch\n all provision, and censured him for failing to abstain from voting on\n the project. Carrigan sought judicial review, arguing that the Ne\n vada law violated the First Amendment. The State District Court\n denied the petition, but the Nevada Supreme Court reversed, holding\n that voting is protected speech and that §281A.420(8)(e)’s catchall\n definition is unconstitutionally overbroad.\nHeld: The Nevada Ethics in Government Law is not unconstitutionally\n overbroad. Pp. 3–11.\n    (a) That law prohibits a legislator who has a conflict both from vot\n ing on a proposal and from advocating its passage or failure. If it was\n constitutional to exclude Carrigan from voting, then his exclusion\n from advocating during a legislative session was not unconstitu\n tional, for it was a reasonable time, place, and manner limitation.\n2             NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    See Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288,\n    293. Pp. 3–4.\n       (b) “[A] ‘universal and long-established’ tradition of prohibiting cer\n    tain conduct creates ‘a strong presumption’ that the prohibition is\n    constitutional.’ ” Republican Party of Minn. v. White, 536 U. S. 765,\n    785. Here, dispositive evidence is provided by “early congressional\n    enactments,” which offer “ ‘contemporaneous and weighty evidence of\n    the Constitution’s meaning,’ ” Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898,\n    905. Within 15 years of the founding, both the House and the Senate\n    adopted recusal rules. Federal conflict-of-interest rules applicable to\n    judges also date back to the founding. The notion that Nevada’s\n    recusal rules violate legislators’ First Amendment rights is also in\n    consistent with long-standing traditions in the States, most of which\n    have some type of recusal law. Pp. 4–8.\n       (c) Restrictions on legislators’ voting are not restrictions on legisla\n    tors’ protected speech. A legislator’s vote is the commitment of his\n    apportioned share of the legislature’s power to the passage or defeat\n    of a particular proposal. He casts his vote “as trustee for his con\n    stituents, not as a prerogative of personal power.” Raines v. Byrd,\n    521 U. S. 811, 821. Moreover, voting is not a symbolic action, and the\n    fact that it is the product of a deeply held or highly unpopular per\n    sonal belief does not transform it into First Amendment speech.\n    Even if the mere vote itself could express depth of belief (which it\n    cannot), this Court has rejected the notion that the First Amendment\n    confers a right to use governmental mechanics to convey a message.\n    See, e.g., Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U. S. 351. Doe\n    v. Reed, 561 U. S. ___, distinguished. Pp. 8–10.\n       (d) The additional arguments raised in Carrigan’s brief were not\n    decided below or raised in his brief in opposition and are thus consid\n    ered waived.

Rev. Stat. §281A.420(2) (2007).1 Section\n——————\n  1 At the time of the relevant events in this case, the disclosure and\n\nrecusal provisions of the Ethics in Government Law were codified at\nNev. Rev. Stat. §281.501 (2003). They were recodified without relevant\nchange in 2007 at §281A.420, and all citations are to that version. The\nNevada Legislature further amended the statute in 2009, see Nev.\nStats., ch. 257, §9.5, p. 1057, but those changes are not relevant here.\n2        NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n281A.420(8)(a)–(d) of the law defines the term “commit\nment in a private capacity to the interests of others” to\nmean a “commitment to a person” who is a member of the\nofficer’s household; is related by blood, adoption, or mar\nriage to the officer; employs the officer or a member of his\nhousehold; or has a substantial and continuing business\nrelationship with the officer. Paragraph (e) of the same\nsubsection adds a catchall to that definition: “[a]ny other\ncommitment or relationship that is substantially similar”\nto one of those listed in paragraphs (a)–(d).\n   The Ethics in Government Law is administered and\nenforced by the petitioner in this litigation, the Nevada\nCommission on Ethics. In 2005, the Commission initiated\nan investigation of Michael Carrigan, an elected member\nof the City Council of Sparks, Nevada, in response to\ncomplaints that Carrigan had violated §281A.420(2) by\nvoting to approve an application for a hotel/casino project\nknown as the “Lazy 8.” Carrigan, the complaints asserted,\nhad a disabling conflict in the matter because his long\ntime friend and campaign manager, Carlos Vasquez,\nworked as a paid consultant for the Red Hawk Land Com\npany, which had proposed the Lazy 8 project and would\nbenefit from its approval.\n   Upon completion of its investigation, the Commission\nconcluded that Carrigan had a disqualifying conflict of\ninterest under §281A.420(8)(e)’s catchall provision because\nhis relationship with Vasquez was “substantially similar”\nto the prohibited relationships listed in §281A.420(8)(a)–\n(d). Its written decision censured Carrigan for failing to\nabstain from voting on the Lazy 8 matter, but did not\nimpose a civil penalty because his violation was not will\nful, see §281A.480. (Before the hearing, Carrigan had\nconsulted the Sparks city attorney, who advised him that\ndisclosing his relationship with Vasquez before voting on\nthe Lazy 8 project, which he did, would satisfy his obliga\ntions under the Ethics in Government Law.)\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Carrigan filed a petition for judicial review in the First\nJudicial District Court of the State of Nevada, arguing\nthat the provisions of the Ethics in Government Law that\nhe was found to have violated were unconstitutional under\nthe First Amendment. The District Court denied the\npetition, but a divided Nevada Supreme Court reversed.\nThe majority held that voting was protected by the First\nAmendment, and, applying strict scrutiny, found that\n§281A.420(8)(e)’s catchall definition was unconstitution\nally overbroad. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Nev.</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ___–___, 236 P. 3d 616, 621–\n624 (2010).\n  We granted certiorari, 562 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                              II\n  The First Amendment prohibits laws “abridging the\nfreedom of speech,” which, “ ‘as a general matter . . . means\nthat government has no power to restrict expression be\ncause of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its\ncontent.’ ” Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 535\nU. S. 564, 573 (2002) (quoting Bolger v. Youngs Drug\nProducts Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 65 (1983)). But the Amend\nment has no application when what is restricted is not\nprotected speech. See, e.g., Roth v. United States, 354\nU. S. 476, 483 (1957) (obscenity not protected speech). The\nNevada Supreme Court thought a legislator’s vote to be\nprotected speech because voting “is a core legislative\nfunction.” 126 Nev., at ___, 236 P. 3d, at 621 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n  We disagree, for the same reason. But before discussing\nthat issue, we must address a preliminary detail: The\nchallenged law not only prohibits the legislator who has a\nconflict from voting on the proposal in question, but also\nforbids him to “advocate the passage or failure” of the\nproposal—evidently meaning advocating its passage or\nfailure during the legislative debate. Neither Carrigan\nnor any of his amici contend that the prohibition on advo\n4        NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncating can be unconstitutional if the prohibition on voting\nis not. And with good reason. Legislative sessions would\nbecome massive town-hall meetings if those who had a\nright to speak were not limited to those who had a right\nto vote. If Carrigan was constitutionally excluded from\nvoting, his exclusion from “advocat[ing]” at the legislative\nsession was a reasonable time, place and manner limita\ntion. See Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence,\n468 U. S. 288, 293 (1984).\n                              III\n   “[A] universal and long-established tradition of prohibit\ning certain conduct creates a strong presumption that the\nprohibition is constitutional: Principles of liberty funda\nmental enough to have been embodied within constitu\ntional guarantees are not readily erased from the Nation’s\nconsciousness.” Republican Party of Minn. v. White, 536\nU. S. 765, 785 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nLaws punishing libel and obscenity are not thought to\nviolate “the freedom of speech” to which the First Amend\nment refers because such laws existed in 1791 and have\nbeen in place ever since. The same is true of legislative\nrecusal rules. The Nevada Supreme Court and Carrigan\nhave not cited a single decision invalidating a generally\napplicable conflict-of-interest recusal rule—and such rules\nhave been commonplace for over 200 years.\n   “[E]arly congressional enactments ‘provid[e] contempo\nraneous and weighty evidence of the Constitution’s mean\ning,’ ” Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898, 905 (1997)\n(quoting Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 723–724 (1986)).\nThat evidence is dispositive here. Within 15 years of the\nfounding, both the House of Representatives and the\nSenate adopted recusal rules. The House rule—to which\nno one is recorded as having objected, on constitutional or\nother grounds, see D. Currie, The Constitution in Con\ngress: The Federalist Period 1789–1801, p. 10 (1997)—was\n                   Cite as: 564 U.

His rule provided as follows:\n      “Where the private interests of a member are con\n    cerned in a bill or question, he is to withdraw. And\n    where such an interest has appeared, his voice [is]\n    disallowed, even after a division. In a case so contrary\n    not only to the laws of decency, but to the fundamen\n    tal principles of the social compact, which denies to\n    any man to be a judge in his own case, it is for the\n    honor of the house that this rule, of immemorial ob\n    servance, should be strictly adhered to.” A Manual of\n    Parliamentary Practice for the Use of the Senate of\n    the United States 31 (1801).\nContemporaneous treatises on parliamentary procedure\ntrack parts of Jefferson’s formulation. See, e.g., A. Clark,\nManual, Compiled and Prepared for the Use of the [New\nYork] Assembly 99 (1816); L. Cushing, Manual of Parlia\nmentary Practice, Rules of Proceeding and Debate in\nDeliberative Assemblies 30 (7th ed. 1854).\n   Federal conflict-of-interest rules applicable to judges\nalso date back to the founding.

CARRIGAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsel to a party appearing before them. Act of May 8, 1792,\nch. 36, §11, 1 Stat. 278–279. In 1821, Congress expanded\nthese bases for recusal to include situations in which “the\njudge . . . is so related to, or connected with, either party,\nas to render it improper for him, in his opinion, to sit on\nthe trial of such suit.” Act of Mar. 3, 1821, ch. 51, 3 Stat.\n643. The statute was again expanded in 1911, to make\nany “personal bias or prejudice” a basis for recusal. Act of\nMar. 3, 1911, §21, 36 Stat. 1090. The current version,\nwhich retains much of the 1911 version’s language, is\ncodified at 28 U. S. C. §144. See generally Liteky v. United\nStates, 510 U. S. 540, 544 (1994); Frank, Disqualification\nof Judges, 56 Yale L. J. 605, 626–630 (1947) (hereinafter\nFrank). There are of course differences between a legisla\ntor’s vote and a judge’s, and thus between legislative and\njudicial recusal rules; nevertheless, there do not appear to\nhave been any serious challenges to judicial recusal stat\nutes as having unconstitutionally restricted judges’ First\nAmendment rights.3\n  The Nevada Supreme Court’s belief that recusal rules\nviolate legislators’ First Amendment rights is also incon\nsistent with long-standing traditions in the States. A\nnumber of States, by common-law rule, have long required\nrecusal of public officials with a conflict. See, e.g., In\nre Nashua, 12 N.

See National Conference of State Legisla\ntures, Voting Recusal Provisions (2009), online at http://\nwww.ncsl.org/?TabID=15357 (as visited June 9, 2011, and\navailable in Clerk of Court’s case file).\n   In an attempt to combat this overwhelming evidence of\nconstitutional acceptability, Carrigan relies on a handful\nof lower-court cases from the 1980’s and afterwards. See\nBrief for Respondent 25 (citing Clark v. United States, 886\nF. 2d 404 (CADC 1989); Miller v. Hull, 878 F. 2d 523 (CA1\n1989); and Camacho v. Brandon, 317 F. 3d 153 (CA2\n2003)). Even if they were relevant, those cases would be\ntoo little and too late to contradict the long-recognized\nneed for legislative recusal. But they are not relevant.\nThe first was vacated as moot, see Clark v. United States,\n915 F. 2d 699, 700, 706 (CADC 1990) (en banc), and the\nother two involve retaliation amounting to viewpoint\ndiscrimination. See Miller, supra, at 533; Camacho, su\npra, at 160. In the past we have applied heightened scru\ntiny to laws that are viewpoint discriminatory even as to\nspeech not protected by the First Amendment, see R. A. V.\nv. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 383–386 (1992). Carrigan does\n——————\n  4A  number of States enacted early judicial recusal laws as well. See,\ne.g., 1797 Vt.

CARRIGAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnot assert that the recusal laws here are viewpoint dis\ncriminatory, nor could he: The statute is content-neutral\nand applies equally to all legislators regardless of party or\nposition.\n                              IV\n   But how can it be that restrictions upon legislators’\nvoting are not restrictions upon legislators’ protected\nspeech? The answer is that a legislator’s vote is the com\nmitment of his apportioned share of the legislature’s\npower to the passage or defeat of a particular proposal.\nThe legislative power thus committed is not personal to\nthe legislator but belongs to the people; the legislator has\nno personal right to it. As we said in Raines v. Byrd, 521\nU. S. 811, 821 (1997), when denying Article III standing to\nlegislators who claimed that their voting power had been\ndiluted by a statute providing for a line-item veto, the\nlegislator casts his vote “as trustee for his constituents,\nnot as a prerogative of personal power.” In this respect,\nvoting by a legislator is different from voting by a citizen.\nWhile “a voter’s franchise is a personal right,” “[t]he pro\ncedures for voting in legislative assemblies . . . pertain to\nlegislators not as individuals but as political representa\ntives executing the legislative process.” Coleman v. Miller,\n307 U. S. 433, 469–470 (1939) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).\n   Carrigan and JUSTICE ALITO say that legislators often\n“ ‘us[e] their votes to express deeply held and highly un\npopular views, often at great personal or political peril.’ ”\nPost, at 1 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment) (quoting Brief for Respondent 23). How do they\nexpress those deeply held views, one wonders? Do ballots\ncontain a check-one-of-the-boxes attachment that will be\ndisplayed to the public, reading something like “( ) I have\na deeply held view about this; ( ) this is probably desirable;\n( ) this is the least of the available evils; ( ) my personal\nview is the other way, but my constituents want this; ( )\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmy personal view is the other way, but my big contributors\nwant this; ( ) I don’t have the slightest idea what this\nlegislation does, but on my way in to vote the party Whip\nsaid vote ‘aye’ ”? There are, to be sure, instances where\naction conveys a symbolic meaning—such as the burning\nof a flag to convey disagreement with a country’s policies,\nsee Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 406 (1989). But the\nact of voting symbolizes nothing. It discloses, to be sure,\nthat the legislator wishes (for whatever reason) that the\nproposition on the floor be adopted, just as a physical\nassault discloses that the attacker dislikes the victim. But\nneither the one nor the other is an act of communication.\nCf. Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional\nRights, Inc., 547 U. S. 47, 66 (2006) (expressive value was\n“not created by the conduct itself but by the speech that\naccompanies it”).\n   Moreover, the fact that a nonsymbolic act is the product\nof deeply held personal belief—even if the actor would like\nit to convey his deeply held personal belief—does not\ntransform action into First Amendment speech. Nor does\nthe fact that action may have social consequences—such\nas the unpopularity that cost John Quincy Adams his\nSenate seat resulting from his vote in favor of the Em\nbargo Act of 1807, see post, at 1. However unpopular\nAdams’ vote may have made him, and however deeply\nAdams felt that his vote was the right thing to do, the act\nof voting was still nonsymbolic conduct engaged in for an\nindependent governmental purpose.\n   Even if it were true that the vote itself could “express\ndeeply held and highly unpopular views,” the argument\nwould still miss the mark. This Court has rejected the\nnotion that the First Amendment confers a right to use\ngovernmental mechanics to convey a message. For exam\nple, in Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U. S.\n351 (1997), we upheld a State’s prohibition on multiple\nparty or “fusion” candidates for elected office against a\n10            NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nFirst Amendment challenge. We admitted that a State’s\nban on a person’s appearing on the ballot as the candidate\nof more than one party might prevent a party from “using\nthe ballot to communicate to the public it supports a par\nticular candidate who is already another party’s candi\ndate,” id., at 362; but we nonetheless were “unpersuaded\n. . . by the party’s contention that it has a right to use the\nballot itself to send a particularized message.” Id., at 362–\n363; see also Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, 438\n(1992). In like manner, a legislator has no right to use\nofficial powers for expressive purposes.\n    Carrigan and JUSTICE ALITO also cite Doe v. Reed, 561\nU. S. ___ (2010), as establishing “the expressive character\nof voting.” Post, at 2; see also Brief for Respondent 26.\nBut Reed did no such thing. That case held only that a\ncitizen’s signing of a petition—“ ‘core political speech,’ ”\nMeyer v. Grant, 486 U. S. 414, 421–422 (1988)—was not\ndeprived of its protected status simply because, under\nstate law, a petition that garnered a sufficient number of\nsignatures would suspend the state law to which it per\ntained, pending a referendum. See Reed, 561 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 6); id., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (opinion of SCALIA,\nJ.). It is one thing to say that an inherently expressive act\nremains so despite its having governmental effect, but it is\naltogether another thing to say that a governmental act\nbecomes expressive simply because the governmental\nactor wishes it to be so. We have never said the latter is\ntrue.5\n——————\n  5 JUSTICE  ALITO reasons as follows: (1) If an ordinary citizen were to\nvote in a straw poll on an issue pending before a legislative body, that\nvote would be speech; (2) if a member of the legislative body were to do\nthe same, it would be no less expressive; therefore (3) the legislator’s\nactual vote must also be expressive. This conclusion does not follow. A\nlegislator voting on a bill is not fairly analogized to one simply discuss\ning that bill or expressing an opinion for or against it. The former is\nperforming a governmental act as a representative of his constituents,\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

What\never the merits of these arguments, we have no occasion to\nconsider them. Neither was decided below: The Nevada\nSupreme Court made no mention of the former argument\nand said that it need not address the latter given its reso\nlution of the overbreadth challenge, 126 Nev. ___, n. 4, 236\nP. 3d, at 619, n. 4. Nor was either argument raised in\nCarrigan’s brief in opposition to the petition for writ of\ncertiorari.

CARRIGAN\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF \n\n                       NEVADA\n\n                        [June 13, 2011] \n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY, concurring.\n   For the reasons the Court explains, the act of casting an\nofficial vote is not itself protected by the Speech Clause of\nthe First Amendment; and I join the Court’s opinion.\n   It does seem appropriate to note that the opinion does\nnot, and on this record should not, consider a free speech\ncontention that would have presented issues of consider\nable import, were it to have been a proper part of the case.\nNeither in the submissions of the parties to this Court\ndefining the issues presented, nor in the opinion of the\nNevada Supreme Court, were the Nevada statutory provi\nsions here at issue challenged or considered from the\nstandpoint of burdens they impose on the First Amend\nment speech rights of legislators and constituents apart\nfrom an asserted right to engage in the act of casting a\nvote.\n   The statute may well impose substantial burdens on\nwhat undoubtedly is speech. The democratic process\npresumes a constant interchange of voices. Quite apart\nfrom the act of voting, speech takes place both in the\nelection process and during the routine course of commu\nnications between and among legislators, candidates,\ncitizens, groups active in the political process, the press,\nand the public at large. This speech and expression often\nfinds powerful form in groups and associations with whom\n2        NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\na legislator or candidate has long and close ties, ties made\nall the stronger by shared outlook and civic purpose. The\nprocess is so intricate a part of communication in a democ\nracy that it is difficult to describe in summary form, lest\nits fundamental character be understated. It may suffice,\nhowever, to note just a few examples.\n   Assume a citizen has strong and carefully considered\npositions on family life; the environment; economic princi\nples; criminal justice; religious values; or the rights of\npersons. Assume, too, that based on those beliefs, he or\nshe has personal ties with others who share those views.\nThe occasion may arise when, to promote and protect\nthese beliefs, close friends and associates, perhaps in\nconcert with organized groups with whom the citizen also\nhas close ties, urge the citizen to run for office. These\npersons and entities may offer strong support in an elec\ntion campaign, support which itself can be expression in\nits classic form. The question then arises what application\nthe Nevada statute has if a legislator who was elected\nwith that support were to vote upon legislation central to\nthe shared cause, or, for that matter, any other cause\nsupported by those friends and affiliates.\n   As the Court notes, Nev. Rev. Stat. §281A.420(2) (2007)\nprovides:\n    “[A] public officer shall not vote upon or advocate the\n    passage or failure of, but may otherwise participate in\n    the consideration of, a matter with respect to which\n    the independence of judgment of a reasonable person\n    in his situation would be materially affected by . . .\n    [h]is commitment in a private capacity to the interests\n    of others.”\nThere is, in my view, a serious concern that the statute\nimposes burdens on the communications and expressions\njust discussed. The immediate response might be that the\nstatute does not apply because its application is confined\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nto the legislator’s “commitment in a private capacity to the\ninterests of others.” That proposition may be a debatable\none. At least without the benefit of further submissions or\nargument or explanation, it seems that one fair interpre\ntation, if not the necessary one, is that the statute could\napply to a legislator whose personal life is tied to the\nlongstanding, close friendships he or she has forged in the\ncommon cause now at stake.\n   The application of the statute’s language to the case just\nsupposed, and to any number of variations on the supposi\ntion, is not apparent. And if the statute imposes unjusti\nfied burdens on speech or association protected by the\nFirst Amendment, or if it operates to chill or suppress the\nexercise of those freedoms by reason of vague terms or\noverbroad coverage, it is invalid. See United States v.\nWilliams, 553 U. S. 285, 292–293, 304 (2008). A statute of\nthis sort is an invitation to selective enforcement; and\neven if enforcement is undertaken in good faith, the dan\ngers of suppression of particular speech or associational\nties may well be too significant to be accepted. See Gentile\nv. State Bar of Nev., 501 U. S. 1030, 1051 (1991).\n   The interests here at issue are at the heart of the First\nAmendment. “[T]he First Amendment has its fullest and\nmost urgent application to speech uttered during a cam\npaign for political office.” Eu v. San Francisco County\nDemocratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 223 (1989)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). And the Court has\nmade it clear that “the right of citizens to band together in\npromoting among the electorate candidates who espouse\ntheir political views” is among the First Amendment’s\nmost pressing concerns. Clingman v. Beaver, 544 U. S.\n581, 586 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The constitutionality of a law prohibiting a legislative\nor executive official from voting on matters advanced by or\nassociated with a political supporter is therefore a most\nserious matter from the standpoint of the logical and\n4         NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\ninevitable burden on speech and association that preceded\nthe vote. The restriction may impose a significant burden\non activities protected by the First Amendment. As a\ngeneral matter, citizens voice their support and lend their\naid because they wish to confer the powers of public office\non those whose positions correspond with their own. That\ndynamic, moreover, links the principles of participation\nand representation at the heart of our democratic govern\nment. Just as candidates announce positions in exchange\nfor citizens’ votes, Brown v. Hartlage, 456 U. S. 45, 55–56\n(1982), so too citizens offer endorsements, advertise their\nviews, and assist political campaigns based upon bonds of\ncommon purpose. These are the mechanisms that sustain\nrepresentative democracy. See ibid.\n   The Court has held that due process may require\nrecusal in the context of certain judicial determinations,\nsee Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U. S. ___\n(2009); but as the foregoing indicates, it is not at all clear\nthat a statute of this breadth can be enacted to extend\nprinciples of judicial impartiality to a quite different con\ntext. The differences between the role of political bodies in\nformulating and enforcing public policy, on the one hand,\nand the role of courts in adjudicating individual disputes\naccording to law, on the other, see ante, at 6, may call for a\ndifferent understanding of the responsibilities attendant\nupon holders of those respective offices and of the legiti\nmate restrictions that may be imposed upon them.\n   For these reasons, the possibility that Carrigan was\ncensured because he was thought to be beholden to a\nperson who helped him win an election raises constitu\ntional concerns of the first magnitude.\n   As the Court observes, however, the question whether\nNevada’s recusal statute was applied in a manner that\nburdens the First Amendment freedoms discussed above is\nnot presented in this case.

Ante, at 8. As respondent notes, “[o]ur his\ntory is rich with tales of legislators using their votes to\nexpress deeply held and highly unpopular views, often at\ngreat personal or political peril.” Brief for Respondent 23.\nTo illustrate this point, respondent notes, among other\nfamous incidents, John Quincy Adams’ vote in favor of the\nEmbargo Act of 1807, a vote that is said to have cost\nhim his Senate seat, and Sam Houston’s vote against the\nKansas-Nebraska Act, a vote that was deeply unpopular\nin the South. Id., at 23–24 (citing J. Kennedy, Profiles in\nCourage 48, 109 (commemorative ed. 1991)).\n  In response to respondent’s argument, the Court sug\ngests that the “expressive value” of such votes is “ ‘not\ncreated by the conduct itself but by the speech that ac\ncompanies it.’ ” Ante, at 9. This suggestion, however, is\nsurely wrong. If John Quincy Adams and Sam Houston\nhad done no more than cast the votes in question, their\nvotes would still have spoken loudly and clearly to every\none who was interested in the bills in question. Voting\nhas an expressive component in and of itself. The Court’s\n2             NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN\n\n                            Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nstrange understanding of the concept of speech is shown\nby its suggestion that the symbolic act of burning the\nAmerican flag is speech but John Quincy Adams calling\nout “yea” on the Embargo Act was not. Ibid.*\n  A legislative vote is not speech, the Court tells us, be\ncause the vote may express, not the legislator’s sincere\npersonal view, but simply the view that is favored by the\nlegislator’s constituents. See ibid. But the same is some\ntimes true of legislators’ speeches.\n  Not only is the Court incorrect in its analysis of the\nexpressive character of voting, but the Court’s position is\ninconsistent with our reasoning just last Term in Doe v.\nReed, 561 U. S. ___ (2010). There, respondents argued\nthat “signing a petition is a legally operative legislative\nact and therefore ‘does not involve any significant expres\nsive element.’ ” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (quoting Brief for\nRespondent Reed 31). But the Court rejected this argu\nment, stating:\n       “It is true that signing a referendum petition may ul\n       timately have the legal consequence of requiring the\n       secretary of state to place the referendum on the bal\n       lot. But we do not see how adding such legal effect to\n       an expressive activity somehow deprives that activity\n       of its expressive component, taking it outside the\n       scope of the First Amendment.” 561 U. S., at ___ (slip\n       op., at 6).\n   But cf. id., at ___ (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment)\n(slip op., at 1) (“I doubt whether signing a petition that has\nthe effect of suspending a law fits within ‘the freedom of\nspeech’ at all”).\n   Our reasoning in Reed is applicable here. Just as the\nact of signing a petition is not deprived of its expressive\ncharacter when the signature is given legal consequences,\n——————\n    * See 17 Annals of Congress 50 (1807); see also 15 id., at 201 (1806).\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nthe act of voting is not drained of its expressive content\nwhen the vote has a legal effect. If an ordinary citizen\ncasts a vote in a straw poll on an important proposal\npending before a legislative body, that act indisputably\nconstitutes a form of speech. If a member of the legislative\nbody chooses to vote in the same straw poll, the legislator’s\nact is no less expressive than that of an ordinary citizen.\nAnd if the legislator then votes on the measure in the\nlegislative chamber, the expressive character of that vote\nis not eliminated simply because it may affect the outcome\nof the legislative process.\n   In Part III of its opinion, the Court demonstrates that\nlegislative recusal rules were not regarded during the\nfounding era as impermissible restrictions on freedom of\nspeech. On that basis, I agree that the judgment below\nmust be reversed.\n</pre>", "id": 218667, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2011/06/13/Nevada_Commn_on_Ethics_v._Carrigan.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2010                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued April 27, 2011—Decided June 13, 2011\nNevada’s Ethics in Government Law requires public officials to recuse\n themselves from voting on, or advocating the passage or failure of, “a\n matter with respect to which the independence of judgment of a rea\n sonable person in his situation would be materially affected by,” inter\n alia, “[h]is commitment in a private capacity to the interests of oth\n ers,” Nev. Rev. Stat. §281A.420(2) (2007), which includes a “commit\n ment to a [specified] person,” e.g., a member of the officer’s household\n or the officer’s relative, §281A.420(8)(a)–(d), and “[a]ny other com\n mitment or relationship that is substantially similar” to one enumer\n ated in paragraphs (a)–(d), §281A.420(8)(e).\n    Petitioner (Commission) administers and enforces Nevada’s law.\n The Commission investigated respondent Carrigan, an elected local\n official who voted to approve a hotel/casino project proposed by a\n company that used Carrigan’s long-time friend and campaign man\n ager as a paid consultant. The Commission concluded that Carrigan\n had a disqualifying conflict of interest under §281A.420(8)(e)’s catch\n all provision, and censured him for failing to abstain from voting on\n the project. Carrigan sought judicial review, arguing that the Ne\n vada law violated the First Amendment. The State District Court\n denied the petition, but the Nevada Supreme Court reversed, holding\n that voting is protected speech and that §281A.420(8)(e)’s catchall\n definition is unconstitutionally overbroad.\nHeld: The Nevada Ethics in Government Law is not unconstitutionally\n overbroad. Pp. 3–11.\n    (a) That law prohibits a legislator who has a conflict both from vot\n ing on a proposal and from advocating its passage or failure. If it was\n constitutional to exclude Carrigan from voting, then his exclusion\n from advocating during a legislative session was not unconstitu\n tional, for it was a reasonable time, place, and manner limitation.\n2             NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v.

Pp. 3–4.\n       (b) “[A] ‘universal and long-established’ tradition of prohibiting cer\n    tain conduct creates ‘a strong presumption’ that the prohibition is\n    constitutional.’ ” Republican Party of Minn. v. White, 536 U. S. 765,\n    785. Here, dispositive evidence is provided by “early congressional\n    enactments,” which offer “ ‘contemporaneous and weighty evidence of\n    the Constitution’s meaning,’ ” Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898,\n    905. Within 15 years of the founding, both the House and the Senate\n    adopted recusal rules. Federal conflict-of-interest rules applicable to\n    judges also date back to the founding. The notion that Nevada’s\n    recusal rules violate legislators’ First Amendment rights is also in\n    consistent with long-standing traditions in the States, most of which\n    have some type of recusal law. Pp. 4–8.\n       (c) Restrictions on legislators’ voting are not restrictions on legisla\n    tors’ protected speech. A legislator’s vote is the commitment of his\n    apportioned share of the legislature’s power to the passage or defeat\n    of a particular proposal. He casts his vote “as trustee for his con\n    stituents, not as a prerogative of personal power.” Raines v. Byrd,\n    521 U. S. 811, 821. Moreover, voting is not a symbolic action, and the\n    fact that it is the product of a deeply held or highly unpopular per\n    sonal belief does not transform it into First Amendment speech.\n    Even if the mere vote itself could express depth of belief (which it\n    cannot), this Court has rejected the notion that the First Amendment\n    confers a right to use governmental mechanics to convey a message.\n    See, e.g., Timmons v.

Rev. Stat. §281A.420(2) (2007).1 Section\n——————\n  1 At the time of the relevant events in this case, the disclosure and\n\nrecusal provisions of the Ethics in Government Law were codified at\nNev. Rev. Stat. §281.501 (2003). They were recodified without relevant\nchange in 2007 at §281A.420, and all citations are to that version. The\nNevada Legislature further amended the statute in 2009, see Nev.\nStats., ch. 257, §9.5, p. 1057, but those changes are not relevant here.\n2        NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n281A.420(8)(a)–(d) of the law defines the term “commit\nment in a private capacity to the interests of others” to\nmean a “commitment to a person” who is a member of the\nofficer’s household; is related by blood, adoption, or mar\nriage to the officer; employs the officer or a member of his\nhousehold; or has a substantial and continuing business\nrelationship with the officer. Paragraph (e) of the same\nsubsection adds a catchall to that definition: “[a]ny other\ncommitment or relationship that is substantially similar”\nto one of those listed in paragraphs (a)–(d).\n   The Ethics in Government Law is administered and\nenforced by the petitioner in this litigation, the Nevada\nCommission on Ethics. In 2005, the Commission initiated\nan investigation of Michael Carrigan, an elected member\nof the City Council of Sparks, Nevada, in response to\ncomplaints that Carrigan had violated §281A.420(2) by\nvoting to approve an application for a hotel/casino project\nknown as the “Lazy 8.” Carrigan, the complaints asserted,\nhad a disabling conflict in the matter because his long\ntime friend and campaign manager, Carlos Vasquez,\nworked as a paid consultant for the Red Hawk Land Com\npany, which had proposed the Lazy 8 project and would\nbenefit from its approval.\n   Upon completion of its investigation, the Commission\nconcluded that Carrigan had a disqualifying conflict of\ninterest under §281A.420(8)(e)’s catchall provision because\nhis relationship with Vasquez was “substantially similar”\nto the prohibited relationships listed in §281A.420(8)(a)–\n(d). Its written decision censured Carrigan for failing to\nabstain from voting on the Lazy 8 matter, but did not\nimpose a civil penalty because his violation was not will\nful, see §281A.480. (Before the hearing, Carrigan had\nconsulted the Sparks city attorney, who advised him that\ndisclosing his relationship with Vasquez before voting on\nthe Lazy 8 project, which he did, would satisfy his obliga\ntions under the Ethics in Government Law.)\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Carrigan filed a petition for judicial review in the First\nJudicial District Court of the State of Nevada, arguing\nthat the provisions of the Ethics in Government Law that\nhe was found to have violated were unconstitutional under\nthe First Amendment. The District Court denied the\npetition, but a divided Nevada Supreme Court reversed.\nThe majority held that voting was protected by the First\nAmendment, and, applying strict scrutiny, found that\n§281A.420(8)(e)’s catchall definition was unconstitution\nally overbroad. 126 Nev. 28, ___–___, 236 P. 3d 616, 621–\n624 (2010).\n  We granted certiorari, 562 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                              II\n  The First Amendment prohibits laws “abridging the\nfreedom of speech,” which, “ ‘as a general matter . . . means\nthat government has no power to restrict expression be\ncause of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its\ncontent.’ ” Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 535\nU. S. 564, 573 (2002) (quoting Bolger v. Youngs Drug\nProducts Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 65 (1983)). But the Amend\nment has no application when what is restricted is not\nprotected speech. See, e.g., Roth v. United States, 354\nU. S. 476, 483 (1957) (obscenity not protected speech). The\nNevada Supreme Court thought a legislator’s vote to be\nprotected speech because voting “is a core legislative\nfunction.” 126 Nev., at ___, 236 P. 3d, at 621 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n  We disagree, for the same reason. But before discussing\nthat issue, we must address a preliminary detail: The\nchallenged law not only prohibits the legislator who has a\nconflict from voting on the proposal in question, but also\nforbids him to “advocate the passage or failure” of the\nproposal—evidently meaning advocating its passage or\nfailure during the legislative debate. Neither Carrigan\nnor any of his amici contend that the prohibition on advo\n4        NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncating can be unconstitutional if the prohibition on voting\nis not. And with good reason. Legislative sessions would\nbecome massive town-hall meetings if those who had a\nright to speak were not limited to those who had a right\nto vote. If Carrigan was constitutionally excluded from\nvoting, his exclusion from “advocat[ing]” at the legislative\nsession was a reasonable time, place and manner limita\ntion. See Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence,\n468 U. S. 288, 293 (1984).\n                              III\n   “[A] universal and long-established tradition of prohibit\ning certain conduct creates a strong presumption that the\nprohibition is constitutional: Principles of liberty funda\nmental enough to have been embodied within constitu\ntional guarantees are not readily erased from the Nation’s\nconsciousness.” Republican Party of Minn. v. White, 536\nU. S. 765, 785 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nLaws punishing libel and obscenity are not thought to\nviolate “the freedom of speech” to which the First Amend\nment refers because such laws existed in 1791 and have\nbeen in place ever since. The same is true of legislative\nrecusal rules. The Nevada Supreme Court and Carrigan\nhave not cited a single decision invalidating a generally\napplicable conflict-of-interest recusal rule—and such rules\nhave been commonplace for over 200 years.\n   “[E]arly congressional enactments ‘provid[e] contempo\nraneous and weighty evidence of the Constitution’s mean\ning,’ ” Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898, 905 (1997)\n(quoting Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 723–724 (1986)).\nThat evidence is dispositive here. Within 15 years of the\nfounding, both the House of Representatives and the\nSenate adopted recusal rules. The House rule—to which\nno one is recorded as having objected, on constitutional or\nother grounds, see D. Currie, The Constitution in Con\ngress: The Federalist Period 1789–1801, p. 10 (1997)—was\n                   Cite as: 564 U.

His rule provided as follows:\n      “Where the private interests of a member are con\n    cerned in a bill or question, he is to withdraw. And\n    where such an interest has appeared, his voice [is]\n    disallowed, even after a division. In a case so contrary\n    not only to the laws of decency, but to the fundamen\n    tal principles of the social compact, which denies to\n    any man to be a judge in his own case, it is for the\n    honor of the house that this rule, of immemorial ob\n    servance, should be strictly adhered to.” A Manual of\n    Parliamentary Practice for the Use of the Senate of\n    the United States 31 (1801).\nContemporaneous treatises on parliamentary procedure\ntrack parts of Jefferson’s formulation. See, e.g., A. Clark,\nManual, Compiled and Prepared for the Use of the [New\nYork] Assembly 99 (1816); L. Cushing, Manual of Parlia\nmentary Practice, Rules of Proceeding and Debate in\nDeliberative Assemblies 30 (7th ed. 1854).\n   Federal conflict-of-interest rules applicable to judges\nalso date back to the founding. In 1792, Congress passed\na law requiring district court judges to recuse themselves\nif they had a personal interest in a suit or had been coun\n——————\n  2 The House first achieved a quorum on April 1, 1789, 1 Annals of\n\nCong. 96, and it adopted rules governing its procedures on April 7,\n1789, see id., at 98–99.\n6           NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsel to a party appearing before them. Act of May 8, 1792,\nch. 36, §11, 1 Stat. 278–279. In 1821, Congress expanded\nthese bases for recusal to include situations in which “the\njudge . . . is so related to, or connected with, either party,\nas to render it improper for him, in his opinion, to sit on\nthe trial of such suit.” Act of Mar. 3, 1821, ch. 51, 3 Stat.\n643. The statute was again expanded in 1911, to make\nany “personal bias or prejudice” a basis for recusal. Act of\nMar. 3, 1911, §21, 36 Stat. 1090. The current version,\nwhich retains much of the 1911 version’s language, is\ncodified at 28 U. S. C. §144. See generally Liteky v. United\nStates, 510 U. S. 540, 544 (1994); Frank, Disqualification\nof Judges, 56 Yale L. J. 605, 626–630 (1947) (hereinafter\nFrank). There are of course differences between a legisla\ntor’s vote and a judge’s, and thus between legislative and\njudicial recusal rules; nevertheless, there do not appear to\nhave been any serious challenges to judicial recusal stat\nutes as having unconstitutionally restricted judges’ First\nAmendment rights.3\n  The Nevada Supreme Court’s belief that recusal rules\nviolate legislators’ First Amendment rights is also incon\nsistent with long-standing traditions in the States. A\nnumber of States, by common-law rule, have long required\nrecusal of public officials with a conflict. See, e.g., In\nre Nashua, 12 N. H. 425, 430 (1841) (“If one of the com\nmissioners be interested, he shall not serve”); Commis\nsioners’ Court v. Tarver, 25 Ala. 480, 481 (1854) (“If any\nmember . . . has a peculiar, personal interest, such mem\nber would be disqualified”); Stubbs v.

See National Conference of State Legisla\ntures, Voting Recusal Provisions (2009), online at http://\nwww.ncsl.org/?TabID=15357 (as visited June 9, 2011, and\navailable in Clerk of Court’s case file).\n   In an attempt to combat this overwhelming evidence of\nconstitutional acceptability, Carrigan relies on a handful\nof lower-court cases from the 1980’s and afterwards. See\nBrief for Respondent 25 (citing Clark v. United States, 886\nF. 2d 404 (CADC 1989); Miller v. Hull, 878 F. 2d 523 (CA1\n1989); and Camacho v. Brandon, 317 F. 3d 153 (CA2\n2003)). Even if they were relevant, those cases would be\ntoo little and too late to contradict the long-recognized\nneed for legislative recusal. But they are not relevant.\nThe first was vacated as moot, see Clark v. United States,\n915 F. 2d 699, 700, 706 (CADC 1990) (en banc), and the\nother two involve retaliation amounting to viewpoint\ndiscrimination. See Miller, supra, at 533; Camacho, su\npra, at 160. In the past we have applied heightened scru\ntiny to laws that are viewpoint discriminatory even as to\nspeech not protected by the First Amendment, see R. A. V.\nv. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 383–386 (1992). Carrigan does\n——————\n  4A  number of States enacted early judicial recusal laws as well. See,\ne.g., 1797 Vt. Laws, §23, p. 178 (“[N]o justice of the peace shall take\ncognizance of any cause, where he shall be within either the first,\nsecond, third, or fourth degree of affinity, or consanguinity, to either of\nthe parties, or shall be directly or indirectly interested, in the cause or\nmatter to be determined”); 1818 Mass. Laws, §5, p. 632 (“[W]henever\nany Judge of Probate shall be interested in the estate of any person\ndeceased, within the county of such Judge, such estate shall be settled\nin the Probate Court of the most ancient next adjoining county . . .”);\nMacon v. Huff, 60 Ga. 221, 223–226 (1878). See generally Frank 609–\n626.\n8         NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnot assert that the recusal laws here are viewpoint dis\ncriminatory, nor could he: The statute is content-neutral\nand applies equally to all legislators regardless of party or\nposition.\n                              IV\n   But how can it be that restrictions upon legislators’\nvoting are not restrictions upon legislators’ protected\nspeech? The answer is that a legislator’s vote is the com\nmitment of his apportioned share of the legislature’s\npower to the passage or defeat of a particular proposal.\nThe legislative power thus committed is not personal to\nthe legislator but belongs to the people; the legislator has\nno personal right to it. As we said in Raines v. Byrd, 521\nU. S. 811, 821 (1997), when denying Article III standing to\nlegislators who claimed that their voting power had been\ndiluted by a statute providing for a line-item veto, the\nlegislator casts his vote “as trustee for his constituents,\nnot as a prerogative of personal power.” In this respect,\nvoting by a legislator is different from voting by a citizen.\nWhile “a voter’s franchise is a personal right,” “[t]he pro\ncedures for voting in legislative assemblies . . . pertain to\nlegislators not as individuals but as political representa\ntives executing the legislative process.” Coleman v. Miller,\n307 U. S. 433, 469–470 (1939) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).\n   Carrigan and JUSTICE ALITO say that legislators often\n“ ‘us[e] their votes to express deeply held and highly un\npopular views, often at great personal or political peril.’ ”\nPost, at 1 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment) (quoting Brief for Respondent 23). How do they\nexpress those deeply held views, one wonders? Do ballots\ncontain a check-one-of-the-boxes attachment that will be\ndisplayed to the public, reading something like “( ) I have\na deeply held view about this; ( ) this is probably desirable;\n( ) this is the least of the available evils; ( ) my personal\nview is the other way, but my constituents want this; ( )\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmy personal view is the other way, but my big contributors\nwant this; ( ) I don’t have the slightest idea what this\nlegislation does, but on my way in to vote the party Whip\nsaid vote ‘aye’ ”? There are, to be sure, instances where\naction conveys a symbolic meaning—such as the burning\nof a flag to convey disagreement with a country’s policies,\nsee Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 406 (1989). But the\nact of voting symbolizes nothing. It discloses, to be sure,\nthat the legislator wishes (for whatever reason) that the\nproposition on the floor be adopted, just as a physical\nassault discloses that the attacker dislikes the victim. But\nneither the one nor the other is an act of communication.\nCf. Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional\nRights, Inc., 547 U. S. 47, 66 (2006) (expressive value was\n“not created by the conduct itself but by the speech that\naccompanies it”).\n   Moreover, the fact that a nonsymbolic act is the product\nof deeply held personal belief—even if the actor would like\nit to convey his deeply held personal belief—does not\ntransform action into First Amendment speech. Nor does\nthe fact that action may have social consequences—such\nas the unpopularity that cost John Quincy Adams his\nSenate seat resulting from his vote in favor of the Em\nbargo Act of 1807, see post, at 1. However unpopular\nAdams’ vote may have made him, and however deeply\nAdams felt that his vote was the right thing to do, the act\nof voting was still nonsymbolic conduct engaged in for an\nindependent governmental purpose.\n   Even if it were true that the vote itself could “express\ndeeply held and highly unpopular views,” the argument\nwould still miss the mark. This Court has rejected the\nnotion that the First Amendment confers a right to use\ngovernmental mechanics to convey a message. For exam\nple, in Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U. S.\n351 (1997), we upheld a State’s prohibition on multiple\nparty or “fusion” candidates for elected office against a\n10            NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nFirst Amendment challenge. We admitted that a State’s\nban on a person’s appearing on the ballot as the candidate\nof more than one party might prevent a party from “using\nthe ballot to communicate to the public it supports a par\nticular candidate who is already another party’s candi\ndate,” id., at 362; but we nonetheless were “unpersuaded\n. . . by the party’s contention that it has a right to use the\nballot itself to send a particularized message.” Id., at 362–\n363; see also Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, 438\n(1992). In like manner, a legislator has no right to use\nofficial powers for expressive purposes.\n    Carrigan and JUSTICE ALITO also cite Doe v. Reed, 561\nU. S. ___ (2010), as establishing “the expressive character\nof voting.” Post, at 2; see also Brief for Respondent 26.\nBut Reed did no such thing. That case held only that a\ncitizen’s signing of a petition—“ ‘core political speech,’ ”\nMeyer v. Grant, 486 U. S. 414, 421–422 (1988)—was not\ndeprived of its protected status simply because, under\nstate law, a petition that garnered a sufficient number of\nsignatures would suspend the state law to which it per\ntained, pending a referendum. See Reed, 561 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 6); id., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (opinion of SCALIA,\nJ.). It is one thing to say that an inherently expressive act\nremains so despite its having governmental effect, but it is\naltogether another thing to say that a governmental act\nbecomes expressive simply because the governmental\nactor wishes it to be so. We have never said the latter is\ntrue.5\n——————\n  5 JUSTICE  ALITO reasons as follows: (1) If an ordinary citizen were to\nvote in a straw poll on an issue pending before a legislative body, that\nvote would be speech; (2) if a member of the legislative body were to do\nthe same, it would be no less expressive; therefore (3) the legislator’s\nactual vote must also be expressive. This conclusion does not follow. A\nlegislator voting on a bill is not fairly analogized to one simply discuss\ning that bill or expressing an opinion for or against it. The former is\nperforming a governmental act as a representative of his constituents,\n                     Cite as: 564 U.

What\never the merits of these arguments, we have no occasion to\nconsider them. Neither was decided below: The Nevada\nSupreme Court made no mention of the former argument\nand said that it need not address the latter given its reso\nlution of the overbreadth challenge, 126 Nev. ___, n. 4, 236\nP. 3d, at 619, n. 4. Nor was either argument raised in\nCarrigan’s brief in opposition to the petition for writ of\ncertiorari. Arguments thus omitted are normally consid\nered waived, see this Court’s Rule 15.2; Baldwin v. Reese,\n541 U.

The democratic process\npresumes a constant interchange of voices. Quite apart\nfrom the act of voting, speech takes place both in the\nelection process and during the routine course of commu\nnications between and among legislators, candidates,\ncitizens, groups active in the political process, the press,\nand the public at large. This speech and expression often\nfinds powerful form in groups and associations with whom\n2        NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v.

The\nprocess is so intricate a part of communication in a democ\nracy that it is difficult to describe in summary form, lest\nits fundamental character be understated.

Assume, too, that based on those beliefs, he or\nshe has personal ties with others who share those views.\nThe occasion may arise when, to promote and protect\nthese beliefs, close friends and associates, perhaps in\nconcert with organized groups with whom the citizen also\nhas close ties, urge the citizen to run for office. These\npersons and entities may offer strong support in an elec\ntion campaign, support which itself can be expression in\nits classic form. The question then arises what application\nthe Nevada statute has if a legislator who was elected\nwith that support were to vote upon legislation central to\nthe shared cause, or, for that matter, any other cause\nsupported by those friends and affiliates.\n   As the Court notes, Nev. Rev. Stat. §281A.420(2) (2007)\nprovides:\n    “[A] public officer shall not vote upon or advocate the\n    passage or failure of, but may otherwise participate in\n    the consideration of, a matter with respect to which\n    the independence of judgment of a reasonable person\n    in his situation would be materially affected by . . .\n    [h]is commitment in a private capacity to the interests\n    of others.”\nThere is, in my view, a serious concern that the statute\nimposes burdens on the communications and expressions\njust discussed. The immediate response might be that the\nstatute does not apply because its application is confined\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nto the legislator’s “commitment in a private capacity to the\ninterests of others.” That proposition may be a debatable\none. At least without the benefit of further submissions or\nargument or explanation, it seems that one fair interpre\ntation, if not the necessary one, is that the statute could\napply to a legislator whose personal life is tied to the\nlongstanding, close friendships he or she has forged in the\ncommon cause now at stake.\n   The application of the statute’s language to the case just\nsupposed, and to any number of variations on the supposi\ntion, is not apparent. And if the statute imposes unjusti\nfied burdens on speech or association protected by the\nFirst Amendment, or if it operates to chill or suppress the\nexercise of those freedoms by reason of vague terms or\noverbroad coverage, it is invalid. See United States v.\nWilliams, 553 U. S. 285, 292–293, 304 (2008). A statute of\nthis sort is an invitation to selective enforcement; and\neven if enforcement is undertaken in good faith, the dan\ngers of suppression of particular speech or associational\nties may well be too significant to be accepted. See Gentile\nv. State Bar of Nev., 501 U. S. 1030, 1051 (1991).\n   The interests here at issue are at the heart of the First\nAmendment. “[T]he First Amendment has its fullest and\nmost urgent application to speech uttered during a cam\npaign for political office.” Eu v. San Francisco County\nDemocratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 223 (1989)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). And the Court has\nmade it clear that “the right of citizens to band together in\npromoting among the electorate candidates who espouse\ntheir political views” is among the First Amendment’s\nmost pressing concerns. Clingman v. Beaver, 544 U. S.\n581, 586 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The constitutionality of a law prohibiting a legislative\nor executive official from voting on matters advanced by or\nassociated with a political supporter is therefore a most\nserious matter from the standpoint of the logical and\n4         NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\ninevitable burden on speech and association that preceded\nthe vote. The restriction may impose a significant burden\non activities protected by the First Amendment. As a\ngeneral matter, citizens voice their support and lend their\naid because they wish to confer the powers of public office\non those whose positions correspond with their own. That\ndynamic, moreover, links the principles of participation\nand representation at the heart of our democratic govern\nment. Just as candidates announce positions in exchange\nfor citizens’ votes, Brown v. Hartlage, 456 U. S. 45, 55–56\n(1982), so too citizens offer endorsements, advertise their\nviews, and assist political campaigns based upon bonds of\ncommon purpose. These are the mechanisms that sustain\nrepresentative democracy. See ibid.\n   The Court has held that due process may require\nrecusal in the context of certain judicial determinations,\nsee Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U. S. ___\n(2009); but as the foregoing indicates, it is not at all clear\nthat a statute of this breadth can be enacted to extend\nprinciples of judicial impartiality to a quite different con\ntext. The differences between the role of political bodies in\nformulating and enforcing public policy, on the one hand,\nand the role of courts in adjudicating individual disputes\naccording to law, on the other, see ante, at 6, may call for a\ndifferent understanding of the responsibilities attendant\nupon holders of those respective offices and of the legiti\nmate restrictions that may be imposed upon them.\n   For these reasons, the possibility that Carrigan was\ncensured because he was thought to be beholden to a\nperson who helped him win an election raises constitu\ntional concerns of the first magnitude.\n   As the Court observes, however, the question whether\nNevada’s recusal statute was applied in a manner that\nburdens the First Amendment freedoms discussed above is\nnot presented in this case.

Ante, at 8. As respondent notes, “[o]ur his\ntory is rich with tales of legislators using their votes to\nexpress deeply held and highly unpopular views, often at\ngreat personal or political peril.” Brief for Respondent 23.\nTo illustrate this point, respondent notes, among other\nfamous incidents, John Quincy Adams’ vote in favor of the\nEmbargo Act of 1807, a vote that is said to have cost\nhim his Senate seat, and Sam Houston’s vote against the\nKansas-Nebraska Act, a vote that was deeply unpopular\nin the South. Id., at 23–24 (citing J. Kennedy, Profiles in\nCourage 48, 109 (commemorative ed. 1991)).\n  In response to respondent’s argument, the Court sug\ngests that the “expressive value” of such votes is “ ‘not\ncreated by the conduct itself but by the speech that ac\ncompanies it.’ ” Ante, at 9. This suggestion, however, is\nsurely wrong. If John Quincy Adams and Sam Houston\nhad done no more than cast the votes in question, their\nvotes would still have spoken loudly and clearly to every\none who was interested in the bills in question. Voting\nhas an expressive component in and of itself. The Court’s\n2             NEVADA COMM’N ON ETHICS v. CARRIGAN\n\n                            Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nstrange understanding of the concept of speech is shown\nby its suggestion that the symbolic act of burning the\nAmerican flag is speech but John Quincy Adams calling\nout “yea” on the Embargo Act was not. Ibid.*\n  A legislative vote is not speech, the Court tells us, be\ncause the vote may express, not the legislator’s sincere\npersonal view, but simply the view that is favored by the\nlegislator’s constituents. See ibid. But the same is some\ntimes true of legislators’ speeches.\n  Not only is the Court incorrect in its analysis of the\nexpressive character of voting, but the Court’s position is\ninconsistent with our reasoning just last Term in Doe v.\nReed, 561 U. S. ___ (2010). There, respondents argued\nthat “signing a petition is a legally operative legislative\nact and therefore ‘does not involve any significant expres\nsive element.’ ” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (quoting Brief for\nRespondent Reed 31). But the Court rejected this argu\nment, stating:\n       “It is true that signing a referendum petition may ul\n       timately have the legal consequence of requiring the\n       secretary of state to place the referendum on the bal\n       lot. But we do not see how adding such legal effect to\n       an expressive activity somehow deprives that activity\n       of its expressive component, taking it outside the\n       scope of the First Amendment.” 561 U. S., at ___ (slip\n       op., at 6).\n   But cf. id., at ___ (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment)\n(slip op., at 1) (“I doubt whether signing a petition that has\nthe effect of suspending a law fits within ‘the freedom of\nspeech’ at all”).\n   Our reasoning in Reed is applicable here. Just as the\nact of signing a petition is not deprived of its expressive\ncharacter when the signature is given legal consequences,\n——————\n    * See 17 Annals of Congress 50 (1807); see also 15 id., at 201 (1806).\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nthe act of voting is not drained of its expressive content\nwhen the vote has a legal effect. If an ordinary citizen\ncasts a vote in a straw poll on an important proposal\npending before a legislative body, that act indisputably\nconstitutes a form of speech. If a member of the legislative\nbody chooses to vote in the same straw poll, the legislator’s\nact is no less expressive than that of an ordinary citizen.\nAnd if the legislator then votes on the measure in the\nlegislative chamber, the expressive character of that vote\nis not eliminated simply because it may affect the outcome\nof the legislative process.\n   In Part III of its opinion, the Court demonstrates that\nlegislative recusal rules were not regarded during the\nfounding era as impermissible restrictions on freedom of\nspeech. On that basis, I agree that the judgment below\nmust be reversed.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/218667/", "sha1": "aec98f482d080793ea0bbe1c8ee792714a1ccfca", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2011-06-13T07:13:18"}
