In 1994, he kidnaped 16-year-old Adria\nSauceda, raped her with a large stick, and bludgeoned her\nto death with a piece of asphalt. He was convicted of mur­\nder and sentenced to death by a Texas court.

J. 12 (Judgment of Mar. 31), in which the\nInternational Court of Justice (ICJ) held that the United\nStates had violated the Vienna Convention by failing to\nnotify him of his right to consular assistance. His ar­\ngument is foreclosed by Medellín v. Texas, 552 U. S. 491\n(2008) (Medellín I), in which we held that neither the\nAvena decision nor the President’s Memorandum purport­\ning to implement that decision constituted directly en­\nforceable federal law. 552 U. S., at 498–499.\n   Leal and the United States ask us to stay the execution\nso that Congress may consider whether to enact legisla­\ntion implementing the Avena decision. Leal contends that\nthe Due Process Clause prohibits Texas from executing\nhim while such legislation is under consideration. This\nargument is meritless. The Due Process Clause does not\nprohibit a State from carrying out a lawful judgment in\nlight of unenacted legislation that might someday author­\nize a collateral attack on that judgment.\n   The United States does not endorse Leal’s due process\nclaim. Instead, it asks us to stay the execution until\nJanuary 2012 in support of our “future jurisdiction to\nreview the judgment in a proceeding” under this yet-to-be­\nenacted legislation.

Medellín himself sought a stay of exe­\ncution on the ground that Congress might enact imple­\nmenting legislation. We denied his stay application, ex­\nplaining that “Congress has not progressed beyond the\nbare introduction of a bill in the four years since the ICJ\nruling and the four months since our ruling in [Medellín\nI].” Medellín v. Texas, 554 U. S. 759, 760 (2008) (per\ncuriam) (Medellín II). It has now been seven years since\nthe ICJ ruling and three years since our decision in\nMedellín I, making a stay based on the bare introduction\nof a bill in a single house of Congress even less justified. If\na statute implementing Avena had genuinely been a prior­\nity for the political branches, it would have been enacted\nby now.\n   The United States and JUSTICE BREYER complain of the\ngrave international consequences that will follow from\nLeal’s execution. Post, at 4. Congress evidently did not\nfind these consequences sufficiently grave to prompt its\nenactment of implementing legislation, and we will follow\nthe law as written by Congress. We have no authority to\nstay an execution in light of an “appeal of the President,”\npost, at 6, presenting free-ranging assertions of foreign\npolicy consequences, when those assertions come unac­\ncompanied by a persuasive legal claim.\n   Finally, we noted in Medellín II that “[t]he beginning\npremise for any stay . . . must be that petitioner’s confes­\nsion was obtained unlawfully,” and that “[t]he United\nStates has not wavered in its position that petitioner was\nnot prejudiced by his lack of consular access.” 554 U.

Here, the United States studiously refuses to\nargue that Leal was prejudiced by the Vienna Convention\nviolation, contending instead that the Court should issue a\nstay simply in light of the possibility that Leal might be\nable to bring a Vienna Convention claim in federal court,\nregardless of whether his conviction will be found to be\ninvalid. We decline to follow the United States’ suggestion\nof granting a stay to allow Leal to bring a claim based on\nhypothetical legislation when it cannot even bring itself to\nsay that his attempt to overturn his conviction has any\nprospect of success. We may note that in a portion of its\nopinion vacated by the Fifth Circuit on procedural\ngrounds, the District Court found that any violation of the\nVienna Convention would have been harmless.

He asks this Court to stay his execution\npending resolution of his petitions for writs of certiorari\nand habeas corpus. I would grant the applications and\nstay the execution.\n  As the Solicitor General points out, Leal’s execution at\nthis time “would place the United States in irreparable\nbreach” of its “obligation[s]” under international law.\n2                  LEAL GARCIA v. TEXAS\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 1 (hereinafter\nU. S. Brief); see also id., at 11–13, 26, 30. The United\nStates has signed and ratified the Vienna Convention, a\ntreaty under which the United States has promised,\namong other things, to inform an arrested foreign na\ntional, such as Leal, that he has a right to request the\nassistance of his country’s consulate. Vienna Convention\non Consular Relations (Vienna Convention), Art. 36, Apr.\n24, 1963, 21 U. S. T. 77, 100–101, T. I. A. S. No. 6820. The\nUnited States has also signed and ratified an optional\nprotocol, a treaty in which the United States agrees that\n“[d]isputes arising out of the interpretation of application\nof the Convention shall lie within the compulsory jurisdic\ntion of the International Court of Justice.” Optional Pro\ntocol Concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes\n(Optional Protocol), Art. I, Apr. 24, 1963, 21 U. S. T. 325,\n326, T. I. A. S. No. 6820. Although the United States has\nsince given notice of withdrawal from the Optional Proto\ncol, see Letter from Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of State,\nto Kofi A. Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations\n(Mar. 7, 2005), that withdrawal does not alter the binding\nstatus of its prewithdrawal obligations, see U. S. Brief 22,\nn. 4.\n   When officials of the State of Texas arrested Leal,\nthey failed to inform him of his Vienna Convention rights,\nthereby placing the United States in violation of its obliga\ntions under that Convention. And so far neither Texas nor\nany other judicial authority has implemented what the\nInternational Court of Justice found (in a related case\nbrought by the Government of Mexico) to be the proper\nremedy for that Convention violation, namely a hearing\nto determine whether that violation amounted in effect to\nharmless error. Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexi­\ncan Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004 I. C. J. 12, 61–64. See\nalso U. S. Brief 15 (explaining that “President Bush ac\nknowledged the international legal obligation created by\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nAvena”). In other words, the international court made\nclear that Leal is entitled to a certain procedure, namely\na hearing. That being so, a domestic court’s guesses as\nto the results of that procedure are, as far as our treaty\nobligations are concerned, irrelevant.\n    This Court subsequently held that, because Congress\nhad not embodied our international legal obligations in a\nstatute, the Court lacked the power to enforce those obliga\ntions as a matter of domestic law. Medellín v. Texas, 552\nU. S. 491, 525–526 (2008) (“The responsibility for trans\nforming an international obligation arising from a non\nself-executing treaty into domestic law falls to Congress”).\nAnd the Court later refused to grant a stay of execution in\na similar case in significant part because “the President\n. . . has [not] represented to us that there is any likelihood\nof congressional . . . action.” Medellín v. Texas, 554 U. S.\n759, 759–760 (2008) (per curiam).\n    But these applications for stay do not suffer from this\nlast mentioned legal defect. The Solicitor General has\nfiled an amicus brief in which he states that “after ex\ntensive consultation with the Department of State and\nthe Department of Justice,” Senator Patrick Leahy, the\nchairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, has\nintroduced (and expressed an intention to hold speedy\nhearings on) a bill that would permit Leal and other simi\nlarly situated individuals to obtain the hearing that inter\nnational law requires. U. S. Brief 8; see id., at 8–9, 12–13\n(describing the Consular Notification Compliance Act of\n2011, S. 1194, 112th Cong., 1st Sess.). The amicus brief\nindicates that “congressional . . . action” is a reasonable\npossibility. Medellín, 554 U. S., at 760. And the Solicitor\nGeneral urges this Court to grant a stay, providing Con\ngress with adequate time to carry out the legal responsi\nbility that this Court has held belongs to the Legislative\nBranch, Medellín v. Texas, 552 U. S. 491, 525–526 (2008),\nnamely the enactment of a law that will bring the United\n4                  LEAL GARCIA v. TEXAS\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nStates into compliance with its treaty obligations and\nprovide Leal with the hearing that those obligations le\ngally demand. U. S. Brief 2.\n   At the same time, the Solicitor General sets forth strong\nreasons, related to the conduct of foreign affairs, for grant\ning a stay. Representing the Executive Branch (hence\nthe President), the Solicitor General tells us that “[p]e\ntitioner’s execution would cause irreparable harm” to\n“foreign-policy interests of the highest order.” Id., at 11.\nThe Solicitor General says that failing to halt Leal’s execu\ntion would place “the United States in irremediable breach\nof its international-law obligation,” with\n    “serious repercussions for United States foreign rela\n    tions, law-enforcement and other cooperation with\n    Mexico, and the ability of American citizens traveling\n    abroad to have the benefits of consular assistance in\n    the event of detention.” Id., at 12.\n  These statements are supported by the fact that the\nGovernment of Mexico has also filed a brief in which it\nstates that declining to stay Leal’s imminent execution\n    “would seriously jeopardize the ability of the Govern\n    ment of Mexico to continue working collaboratively\n    with the United States on a number of joint ventures,\n    including extraditions, mutual judicial assistance, and\n    our efforts to strengthen our common border.” Brief\n    for United Mexican States as Amicus Curiae 23 (in\n    ternal quotation marks omitted).\n  This Court has described interests of the kind set forth\nby the Solicitor General as “plainly compelling.” Medellín,\n552 U. S., at 524; id., at 537 (Stevens, J., concurring in\njudgment); see also id., at 566 (BREYER, J., dissenting)\n(observing harms that would flow from noncompliance).\nThe Court has long recognized the President’s special\nconstitutionally based authority in matters of foreign\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrelations. See, e.g., United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export\nCorp., 299 U. S. 304, 320 (1936). And it has ordinarily\ngiven his views significant weight in such matters. Jama\nv. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 543 U. S. 335,\n348 (2005) (noting the Court’s “customary policy of defer\nence to the President in matters of foreign affairs”). It\nshould do so here.\n  Finally, this Court has adequate legal authority to grant\nthe requested stay. Should Senator Leahy’s bill become\nlaw by the end of September (when we would consider the\npetition in the ordinary course), this Court would almost\ncertainly grant the petition for a writ of certiorari, vacate\nthe judgment below, and remand the case for further\nproceedings consistent with that law. Indeed, were the\nSolicitor General to indicate at that time that the bill was\nabout to become law, I believe it likely that we would hold\nthe petition for at least several weeks until the bill was\nenacted and then do the same. And this Court, under the\nAll Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. §1651, can take appropriate\naction to preserve its “potential jurisdiction.” FTC v. Dean\nFoods Co., 384 U. S. 597, 603 (1966).\n  Thus, on the one hand, international legal obligations,\nrelated foreign policy considerations, the prospect of legis\nlation, and the consequent injustice involved should that\nlegislation, coming too late for Leal, help others in identi\ncal circumstances all favor granting a stay. And issuing a\nbrief stay until the end of September, when the Court\ncould consider this matter in the ordinary course, would\nput Congress on clear notice that it must act quickly. On\nthe other hand, the State has an interest in proceeding\nwith an immediate execution. But it is difficult to see how\nthe State’s interest in the immediate execution of an\nindividual convicted of capital murder 16 years ago\ncan outweigh the considerations that support additional\ndelay, perhaps only until the end of the summer.\n  Consequently I would grant the stay that the petitioner\n6                 LEAL GARCIA v. TEXAS\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrequests. In reaching its contrary conclusion, the Court\nignores the appeal of the President in a matter related\nto foreign affairs, it substitutes its own views about the\nlikelihood of congressional action for the views of Execu\ntive Branch officials who have consulted with Members of\nCongress, and it denies the request by four Members of\nthe Court to delay the execution until the Court can dis\ncuss the matter at Conference in September. In my view,\nthe Court is wrong in each respect.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 220538, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2011/07/07/Leal_Garcia_v._Texas.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                  Cite as: 564 U.

We have no authority to\nstay an execution in light of an “appeal of the President,”\npost, at 6, presenting free-ranging assertions of foreign\npolicy consequences, when those assertions come unac­\ncompanied by a persuasive legal claim.\n   Finally, we noted in Medellín II that “[t]he beginning\npremise for any stay . . . must be that petitioner’s confes­\nsion was obtained unlawfully,” and that “[t]he United\nStates has not wavered in its position that petitioner was\nnot prejudiced by his lack of consular access.” 554 U.

Here, the United States studiously refuses to\nargue that Leal was prejudiced by the Vienna Convention\nviolation, contending instead that the Court should issue a\nstay simply in light of the possibility that Leal might be\nable to bring a Vienna Convention claim in federal court,\nregardless of whether his conviction will be found to be\ninvalid. We decline to follow the United States’ suggestion\nof granting a stay to allow Leal to bring a claim based on\nhypothetical legislation when it cannot even bring itself to\nsay that his attempt to overturn his conviction has any\nprospect of success. We may note that in a portion of its\nopinion vacated by the Fifth Circuit on procedural\ngrounds, the District Court found that any violation of the\nVienna Convention would have been harmless.

He asks this Court to stay his execution\npending resolution of his petitions for writs of certiorari\nand habeas corpus. I would grant the applications and\nstay the execution.\n  As the Solicitor General points out, Leal’s execution at\nthis time “would place the United States in irreparable\nbreach” of its “obligation[s]” under international law.\n2                  LEAL GARCIA v. TEXAS\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 1 (hereinafter\nU. S. Brief); see also id., at 11–13, 26, 30. The United\nStates has signed and ratified the Vienna Convention, a\ntreaty under which the United States has promised,\namong other things, to inform an arrested foreign na\ntional, such as Leal, that he has a right to request the\nassistance of his country’s consulate. Vienna Convention\non Consular Relations (Vienna Convention), Art. 36, Apr.\n24, 1963, 21 U. S. T. 77, 100–101, T. I. A. S. No. 6820. The\nUnited States has also signed and ratified an optional\nprotocol, a treaty in which the United States agrees that\n“[d]isputes arising out of the interpretation of application\nof the Convention shall lie within the compulsory jurisdic\ntion of the International Court of Justice.” Optional Pro\ntocol Concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes\n(Optional Protocol), Art. I, Apr. 24, 1963, 21 U. S. T. 325,\n326, T. I. A. S. No. 6820. Although the United States has\nsince given notice of withdrawal from the Optional Proto\ncol, see Letter from Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of State,\nto Kofi A. Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations\n(Mar. 7, 2005), that withdrawal does not alter the binding\nstatus of its prewithdrawal obligations, see U. S. Brief 22,\nn. 4.\n   When officials of the State of Texas arrested Leal,\nthey failed to inform him of his Vienna Convention rights,\nthereby placing the United States in violation of its obliga\ntions under that Convention. And so far neither Texas nor\nany other judicial authority has implemented what the\nInternational Court of Justice found (in a related case\nbrought by the Government of Mexico) to be the proper\nremedy for that Convention violation, namely a hearing\nto determine whether that violation amounted in effect to\nharmless error. Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexi­\ncan Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004 I. C. J. 12, 61–64. See\nalso U. S. Brief 15 (explaining that “President Bush ac\nknowledged the international legal obligation created by\n                  Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nAvena”). In other words, the international court made\nclear that Leal is entitled to a certain procedure, namely\na hearing. That being so, a domestic court’s guesses as\nto the results of that procedure are, as far as our treaty\nobligations are concerned, irrelevant.\n    This Court subsequently held that, because Congress\nhad not embodied our international legal obligations in a\nstatute, the Court lacked the power to enforce those obliga\ntions as a matter of domestic law. Medellín v. Texas, 552\nU. S. 491, 525–526 (2008) (“The responsibility for trans\nforming an international obligation arising from a non\nself-executing treaty into domestic law falls to Congress”).\nAnd the Court later refused to grant a stay of execution in\na similar case in significant part because “the President\n. . . has [not] represented to us that there is any likelihood\nof congressional . . . action.” Medellín v. Texas, 554 U. S.\n759, 759–760 (2008) (per curiam).\n    But these applications for stay do not suffer from this\nlast mentioned legal defect. The Solicitor General has\nfiled an amicus brief in which he states that “after ex\ntensive consultation with the Department of State and\nthe Department of Justice,” Senator Patrick Leahy, the\nchairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, has\nintroduced (and expressed an intention to hold speedy\nhearings on) a bill that would permit Leal and other simi\nlarly situated individuals to obtain the hearing that inter\nnational law requires. U. S. Brief 8; see id., at 8–9, 12–13\n(describing the Consular Notification Compliance Act of\n2011, S. 1194, 112th Cong., 1st Sess.). The amicus brief\nindicates that “congressional . . . action” is a reasonable\npossibility. Medellín, 554 U. S., at 760. And the Solicitor\nGeneral urges this Court to grant a stay, providing Con\ngress with adequate time to carry out the legal responsi\nbility that this Court has held belongs to the Legislative\nBranch, Medellín v. Texas, 552 U. S. 491, 525–526 (2008),\nnamely the enactment of a law that will bring the United\n4                  LEAL GARCIA v. TEXAS\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nStates into compliance with its treaty obligations and\nprovide Leal with the hearing that those obligations le\ngally demand. U. S. Brief 2.\n   At the same time, the Solicitor General sets forth strong\nreasons, related to the conduct of foreign affairs, for grant\ning a stay. Representing the Executive Branch (hence\nthe President), the Solicitor General tells us that “[p]e\ntitioner’s execution would cause irreparable harm” to\n“foreign-policy interests of the highest order.” Id., at 11.\nThe Solicitor General says that failing to halt Leal’s execu\ntion would place “the United States in irremediable breach\nof its international-law obligation,” with\n    “serious repercussions for United States foreign rela\n    tions, law-enforcement and other cooperation with\n    Mexico, and the ability of American citizens traveling\n    abroad to have the benefits of consular assistance in\n    the event of detention.” Id., at 12.\n  These statements are supported by the fact that the\nGovernment of Mexico has also filed a brief in which it\nstates that declining to stay Leal’s imminent execution\n    “would seriously jeopardize the ability of the Govern\n    ment of Mexico to continue working collaboratively\n    with the United States on a number of joint ventures,\n    including extraditions, mutual judicial assistance, and\n    our efforts to strengthen our common border.” Brief\n    for United Mexican States as Amicus Curiae 23 (in\n    ternal quotation marks omitted).\n  This Court has described interests of the kind set forth\nby the Solicitor General as “plainly compelling.” Medellín,\n552 U. S., at 524; id., at 537 (Stevens, J., concurring in\njudgment); see also id., at 566 (BREYER, J., dissenting)\n(observing harms that would flow from noncompliance).\nThe Court has long recognized the President’s special\nconstitutionally based authority in matters of foreign\n                 Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrelations. See, e.g., United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export\nCorp., 299 U. S. 304, 320 (1936). And it has ordinarily\ngiven his views significant weight in such matters. Jama\nv. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 543 U. S. 335,\n348 (2005) (noting the Court’s “customary policy of defer\nence to the President in matters of foreign affairs”). It\nshould do so here.\n  Finally, this Court has adequate legal authority to grant\nthe requested stay. Should Senator Leahy’s bill become\nlaw by the end of September (when we would consider the\npetition in the ordinary course), this Court would almost\ncertainly grant the petition for a writ of certiorari, vacate\nthe judgment below, and remand the case for further\nproceedings consistent with that law. Indeed, were the\nSolicitor General to indicate at that time that the bill was\nabout to become law, I believe it likely that we would hold\nthe petition for at least several weeks until the bill was\nenacted and then do the same. And this Court, under the\nAll Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. §1651, can take appropriate\naction to preserve its “potential jurisdiction.” FTC v. Dean\nFoods Co., 384 U. S. 597, 603 (1966).\n  Thus, on the one hand, international legal obligations,\nrelated foreign policy considerations, the prospect of legis\nlation, and the consequent injustice involved should that\nlegislation, coming too late for Leal, help others in identi\ncal circumstances all favor granting a stay. And issuing a\nbrief stay until the end of September, when the Court\ncould consider this matter in the ordinary course, would\nput Congress on clear notice that it must act quickly. On\nthe other hand, the State has an interest in proceeding\nwith an immediate execution. But it is difficult to see how\nthe State’s interest in the immediate execution of an\nindividual convicted of capital murder 16 years ago\ncan outweigh the considerations that support additional\ndelay, perhaps only until the end of the summer.\n  Consequently I would grant the stay that the petitioner\n6                 LEAL GARCIA v. TEXAS\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrequests. In reaching its contrary conclusion, the Court\nignores the appeal of the President in a matter related\nto foreign affairs, it substitutes its own views about the\nlikelihood of congressional action for the views of Execu\ntive Branch officials who have consulted with Members of\nCongress, and it denies the request by four Members of\nthe Court to delay the execution until the Court can dis\ncuss the matter at Conference in September. In my view,\nthe Court is wrong in each respect.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/220538/", "sha1": "be45e1d4b4dcfa2f92d6a09648e52c026912174a", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2011-07-07T14:50:26"}
