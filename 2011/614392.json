The petition for a writ of\ncertiorari is denied.\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER, dissenting from denial of stay.\n  The State of Florida seeks to execute Manuel Valle for a\ncrime for which he was initially sentenced to death more\nthan 33 years ago. Valle asks us to consider whether that\nexecution following decades of incarceration on death row\nviolates the Constitution’s prohibition of “cruel and unu-\nsual punishments.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 8. I would consid-\ner the claim. See Lackey v. Texas, 514 U. S. 1045 (1995)\n(Stevens, J., respecting denial of certiorari); Knight v.\nFlorida, 528 U. S. 990, 993 (1989) (BREYER, J., dissenting\nfrom denial of certiorari).\n  I have little doubt about the cruelty of so long a period of\nincarceration under sentence of death. In Lackey and in\nKnight Justice Stevens and I referred to the legal sources,\nin addition to studies of attempted suicides, that buttress\nthe commonsense conclusion that 33 years in prison under\nthreat of execution is cruel. See In re Medley, 134 U. S.\n160, 172 (1890) (describing as “horrible” the “feelings” that\naccompany uncertainty about whether, or when, the exe-\ncution will take place); Solesbee v. Balkcom, 339 U. S. 9,\n14 (1950) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting) (“In the history of\nmurder, the onset of insanity while awaiting execution of a\n2                    VALLE v.

L. & C. 860, 872,\nn. 44 (1983) (a study of Florida inmates showed that 35%\nof those confined on death row attempted suicide; 42%\nseriously considered suicide); id., at 869–871, (“Recent\nstudies and law suits document both the barbaric condi-\ntions pervading death rows and the debilitating and life-\nnegating effects of these conditions”).\n   So long a confinement followed by execution would also\nseem unusual. The average period of time that an indi-\nvidual sentenced to death spends on death row is almost\n15 years. Thirty three years is more than twice as long.\nAnd, such delays are uncommon. See Dept. of Justice,\nBureau of Justice Statistics, T. Snell, Statiscal Tables,\nCapital Punishment, 2009, p. 19 (Dec. 2010) (Table 18)\n(approximately 113 prisoners have been under a sentence\nof death for more than 29 years out of 3,173 death row\nprisoners in total; 33 of those 113 are in Florida). Cf.\nKnight, 528 U. S., at 993–994 (BREYER, J., dissenting from\ndenial of certiorari) (noting that 24 prisoners had been on\ndeath row for more than 20 years). See also id., at 995 (“A\ngrowing number of courts outside the United States—\ncourts that accept or assume the lawfulness of the death\npenalty— have held that lengthy delay in administering a\nlawful death penalty renders the ultimate execution in-\nhuman, degrading, or unusually cruel”).\n   The commonly accepted justifications for the death\npenalty are close to nonexistent in a case such as this one.\nIt is difficult to imagine how an execution following so long\na period of incarceration could add significantly to that\npunishment’s deterrent value. It seems yet more unlikely\nthat the execution, coming after what is close to a lifetime\nof imprisonment, matters in respect to incapacitation.\nThus, I would focus upon the “moral sensibility” of a com-\nmunity that finds in the death sentence an appropriate\npublic reaction to a terrible crime.

S. 447, 481 (1984) (Stevens, J., concurring in\npart and dissenting in part). And, I would ask how often\nthat community’s sense of retribution would forcefully\ninsist upon a death that comes only several decades after\nthe crime was committed.\n   It might be argued that Valle, not the State, is responsi-\nble for the long delay. But Valle replies that more than\ntwo decades of delay reflect the State’s failure to provide\nthe kind of trial and penalty procedures that the law\nrequires. Regardless, one cannot realistically expect a\ndefendant condemned to death to refrain from fighting for\nhis life by seeking to use whatever procedures the law\nallows.\n   It might also be argued that it is not so much the State\nas it is the numerous procedures that the law demands\nthat produce decades of delay. But this kind of an argu-\nment does not automatically justify execution in this case.\nRather, the argument may point instead to a more basic\ndifficulty, namely the difficulty of reconciling the imposi-\ntion of the death penalty as currently administered with\nprocedures necessary to assure that the wrong person is\nnot executed.\n   Because this case may well raise these questions and\nbecause I believe the Court should consider them, I vote to\ngrant the application for stay.\n</pre>", "id": 614392, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2011/09/28/Valle_v._Florida.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                   Cite as: 564 U.
