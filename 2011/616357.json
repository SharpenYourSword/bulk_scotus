SHIRLEY \n\n                 REE SMITH \n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n             No. 10–1115. Decided October 31, 2011\n\n\n   PER CURIAM. \n\n   The opinion of the Court in Jackson v. Virginia, 443 \n\nU. S. 307 (1979), makes clear that it is the responsibility of\nthe jury—not the court—to decide what conclusions should\nbe drawn from evidence admitted at trial. A reviewing\ncourt may set aside the jury’s verdict on the ground of\ninsufficient evidence only if no rational trier of fact could\nhave agreed with the jury. What is more, a federal court\nmay not overturn a state court decision rejecting a suf-\nficiency of the evidence challenge simply because the fed-\neral court disagrees with the state court. The federal\ncourt instead may do so only if the state court decision\nwas “objectively unreasonable.” Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Because rational people can sometimes disagree, the\ninevitable consequence of this settled law is that judges\nwill sometimes encounter convictions that they believe to\nbe mistaken, but that they must nonetheless uphold. The\nCourt of Appeals in this case substituted its judgment for\nthat of a California jury on the question whether the\nprosecution’s or the defense’s expert witnesses more per-\nsuasively explained the cause of a death. For this reason,\ncertiorari is granted and the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals is reversed.\n                       *   *     *\n  This case concerns the death of 7-week-old Etzel Glass.\n2                    CAVAZOS v. SMITH\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nOn November 29, 1996, Etzel’s mother, Tomeka, put\nEtzel to sleep on a sofa before going to sleep herself in\nanother room. Respondent Shirley Ree Smith—Tomeka’s\nmother—slept on the floor next to Etzel. Several hours later,\nSmith ran into Tomeka’s room, holding Etzel, who was\nlimp, and told her that “[s]omething [was] wrong with\nEtzel.” Tr. 416. By the time emergency officials arrived,\nEtzel was not breathing and had no heartbeat. Smith\nreported that she thought Etzel had fallen off the sofa.\nThe officials’ efforts to resuscitate Etzel failed.\n  Doctors initially attributed Etzel’s death to sudden\ninfant death syndrome (SIDS), the customary diagnosis\nwhen an infant shows no outward signs of trauma. But\nafter an autopsy, the coroner concluded that the cause of\ndeath was instead shaken baby syndrome (SBS). When a\nsocial worker informed Smith of that finding, Smith told\nher that Etzel had not responded to her touch while sleep-\ning, so she had picked him up and given him “a little\nshake, a jostle” to wake him. Id., at 842. According to the\nsocial worker, Smith then said something to the effect of,\n“Oh, my God. Did I do it? Did I do it? Oh, my God.” Id.,\nat 847 (internal quotation marks omitted). In an inter-\nview with the police a few days later, Smith said that she\nhad shaken Etzel, but then she corrected herself and said\nthat she had twisted him to try to elicit a reaction. Smith\nwas arrested and charged with assault on a child resulting\nin death. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. §273ab (West 2008)\n(“Any person who, having the care or custody of a child\nwho is under eight years of age, assaults the child by\nmeans of force that to a reasonable person would be likely\nto produce great bodily injury, resulting in the child’s\ndeath, shall be punished by imprisonment . . .”).\n  At trial, the jury heard seven days of expert medical\ntestimony on the cause of Etzel’s death. The prosecution\noffered three experts, each of whom attested that Etzel’s\ndeath was the result of SBS—not SIDS, as the defense\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ncontended. The first expert, Dr. Eugene Carpenter, was\nthe medical examiner for the Los Angeles County Coroner\nwho had supervised Etzel’s autopsy. Dr. Carpenter is\nboard certified in forensic, anatomic, and clinical pathol-\nogy. He testified that Etzel’s autopsy revealed recent hem-\norrhages in the brain, and he opined that the bleeding and\nother features of Etzel’s pathology, including a bruise and\nabrasion on the lower back of the baby’s head, were con-\nsistent with violent shaking. Dr. Carpenter identified two\nmeans by which shaking can result in a baby’s death: The\nfirst is that the shaking causes blood vessels in the brain\nto tear, creating a pool of blood that pushes the brain\ndownward into the spinal canal, resulting in death but\nlittle direct damage to the brain. The second is that the\nshaking itself is sufficiently severe that the brain directly\ntears in vital areas, causing death with very little bleed-\ning. Dr. Carpenter testified that Etzel’s injuries were\nconsistent with the latter pathology. He also explained\nthat the injuries could not be attributed to either a fall\nfrom the sofa or the administration of cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation. Nor, according to Dr. Carpenter, was it\npossible that Etzel perished from SIDS, given the signs of\ninternal trauma. Dr. Carpenter did testify, however, that\nwhile SBS victims often suffer retinal hemorrhaging,\nEtzel’s autopsy revealed no such injury.\n   The prosecution’s second expert, Dr. Stephanie Erlich,\nwas the associate deputy medical examiner who actually\nperformed Etzel’s autopsy. She is board certified in ana-\ntomic pathology and neuropathology. She corroborated\nDr. Carpenter’s testimony about the autopsy findings, and\nadded that a followup neuropathological examination of\nEtzel’s brain confirmed the existence of recent hemorrhag-\ning. Noting only a minimal amount of new blood in Etzel’s\nbrain, she testified that the cause of death was direct\ntrauma to the brainstem. On cross-examination, she\nagreed with defense counsel that retinal hemorrhaging\n4                    CAVAZOS v. SMITH\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n(absent in Etzel’s case) is present in 75 to 80 percent of\nSBS cases.\n   The third prosecution expert, Dr. David Chadwick, is\nboard certified in pediatrics and the author of articles on\nchildhood death by abusive trauma. He testified that\nEtzel’s injuries were consistent with SBS and that old\ntrauma could not have been the cause of the child’s death.\n   The defense called two experts to dispute these conclu-\nsions. The first, pathologist Dr. Richard Siegler, testified\nthat Etzel died from brain trauma, but that it was not the\nresult of SBS, given the lack of retinal hemorrhaging. He\nadmitted on cross-examination, however, that an absence\nof retinal hemorrhaging does not exclude a finding of SBS.\nHe also acknowledged that he did not believe the cause\nof Etzel’s death was SIDS. According to Dr. Siegler,\nEtzel died from old trauma, an opinion he reached on the\nbasis of studying photographs of the neuropathological\nexamination.\n   The other defense expert, pediatric neurologist Dr.\nWilliam Goldie, testified that Etzel’s death was due to\nSIDS. He noted that Etzel was born with jaundice, a\nheart murmur, and low birth weight—making him more\nsusceptible to SIDS. Dr. Goldie testified that pathologists\nhad not been able to determine the cause of Etzel’s death\nand that the bleeding could be attributed to the resuscita-\ntion efforts.\n   The jury found Smith guilty. Concluding that the jury\n“carefully weighed” the “tremendous amount of evidence”\nsupporting the verdict, Tr. 1649, the trial judge denied\nSmith’s motion for a new trial and sentenced her to an\nindeterminate term of 15 years to life in prison.\n   On direct review, Smith contended that the evidence\nwas not sufficient to establish that Etzel died from SBS.\nAfter thoroughly reviewing the competing medical testi-\nmony, the California Court of Appeal rejected this claim,\nconcluding:\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n       “The expert opinion evidence we have summarized\n    was conflicting. It was for the jury to resolve the con-\n    flicts. The credited evidence was substantial and suf-\n    ficient to support the jury’s conclusions that Etzel died\n    from shaken baby syndrome. The conviction is sup-\n    ported by substantial evidence.” People v. Smith, No.\n    B118869 (Feb. 10, 2000), App. K to Pet. for Cert. 86.\nThe California Supreme Court denied review. App. J, id.,\nat 74.\n   Smith then filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus\nwith the United States District Court for the Central\nDistrict of California, renewing her claim that the evi-\ndence was insufficient to prove that Etzel died of SBS.\nUnder the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\nof 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, that court had no power\nto afford relief unless Smith could show either that the\nCalifornia Court of Appeal’s decision affirming the convic-\ntion “was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable appli-\ncation of,” clearly established federal law as reflected in\nthe holdings of this Court’s cases, 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1),\nor that it “was based on an unreasonable determination of\nthe facts” in light of the state court record, §2254(d)(2).\nHarrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op.,\nat 10).\n   The Magistrate Judge to whom the case was assigned\nissued a report acknowledging that “[t]his is not the typi-\ncal shaken baby case” and that the evidence against Smith\n“raises many questions.” App. I to Pet. for Cert. 65. But\nthe Magistrate Judge nevertheless concluded that the\nevidence was “clearly sufficient to support a conviction.”\nIbid. The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge’s\nreport and denied the petition. App. G, id., at 52.\n   On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed with instructions\nto grant the writ. Smith v. Mitchell, 437 F. 3d 884 (2006).\nDespite the plentitude of expert testimony in the trial\n6                    CAVAZOS v. SMITH\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nrecord concluding that sudden shearing or tearing of the\nbrainstem was the cause of Etzel’s death, the Ninth Cir-\ncuit determined that there was “no evidence to permit an\nexpert conclusion one way or the other” on that question\nbecause there was “no physical evidence of . . . tearing or\nshearing, and no other evidence supporting death by\nviolent shaking.” Id., at 890. The court said that the\nState’s experts “reached [their] conclusion because there\nwas no evidence in the brain itself of the cause of death.”\nIbid. (emphasis in original). The court concluded that\nbecause “[a]bsence of evidence cannot constitute proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt,” ibid., the California Court of\nAppeal had “unreasonably applied” this Court’s opinion in\nJackson v. Virginia in upholding Smith’s conviction, 437\nF. 3d, at 890.\n   That conclusion was plainly wrong. Jackson says that\nevidence is sufficient to support a conviction so long as\n“after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\nthe prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found\nthe essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.” 443 U. S., at 319. It also unambiguously instructs\nthat a reviewing court “faced with a record of historical\nfacts that supports conflicting inferences must presume—\neven if it does not affirmatively appear in the record—that\nthe trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the\nprosecution, and must defer to that resolution.” Id., at\n326. When the deference to state court decisions required\nby §2254(d) is applied to the state court’s already deferen-\ntial review, see Renico, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11),\nthere can be no doubt of the Ninth Circuit’s error below.\n   The jury was presented with competing views of how\nEtzel died. It was made aware of the various experts’\nqualifications and their familiarity with both the subject\nof SBS and the physical condition of Etzel’s body. It ob-\nserved the attorneys for each party cross-examine the\nexperts and elicit concessions from them. The State’s\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nexperts, whom the jury was entitled to believe, opined that\nthe physical evidence was consistent with, and best ex-\nplained by, death from sudden tearing of the brainstem\ncaused by shaking. The Ninth Circuit’s assertion that\nthese experts “reached [their] conclusion because there\nwas no evidence in the brain itself of the cause of death” is\nsimply false. There was “evidence in the brain itself.” The\nautopsy revealed indications of recent trauma to Etzel’s\nbrain, such as subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhaging,\nhemorrhaging around the optic nerves, and the presence\nof a blood clot between the brain’s hemispheres. The\nautopsy also revealed a bruise and abrasion on the lower\nback of Etzel’s head. These affirmative indications of\ntrauma formed the basis of the experts’ opinion that Etzel\ndied from shaking so severe that his brainstem tore.\n  Defense counsel made certain that the jury understood\nthat the prosecution’s experts were unable to identify the\nprecise point of tearing itself. But as Judge Bea noted in\nhis dissent from the Ninth Circuit’s denial of rehearing en\nbanc, the experts explained why the location of the tear\nwas undetectable: “Etzel’s death happened so quickly that\nthe effects of the trauma did not have time to develop.”\nSmith v. Mitchell, 453 F. 3d 1203, 1207 (2006). According\nto the prosecutions’ experts, there was simply no oppor-\ntunity for swelling to occur around the brainstem before\nEtzel died.\n  In light of the evidence presented at trial, the Ninth\nCircuit plainly erred in concluding that the jury’s ver-\ndict was irrational, let alone that it was unreasonable for\nthe California Court of Appeal to think otherwise. See\n§2254(d). Doubts about whether Smith is in fact guilty are\nunderstandable. But it is not the job of this Court, and\nwas not that of the Ninth Circuit, to decide whether the\nState’s theory was correct. The jury decided that question,\n8                         CAVAZOS v. SMITH\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\nand its decision is supported by the record.*\n   It is said that Smith, who already has served years in\nprison, has been punished enough, and that she poses no\ndanger to society. These or other considerations perhaps\nwould be grounds to seek clemency, a prerogative granted\nto executive authorities to help ensure that justice is\ntempered by mercy. It is not clear to the Court whether\nthis process has been invoked, or, if so, what its course has\nbeen. It is not for the Judicial Branch to determine the\nstandards for this discretion. If the clemency power is\nexercised in either too generous or too stingy a way, that\ncalls for political correctives, not judicial intervention.\n   The decision below cannot be allowed to stand. This\nCourt vacated and remanded this judgment twice before,\ncalling the panel’s attention to this Court’s opinions high-\nlighting the necessity of deference to state courts in\n§2254(d) habeas cases. Each time the panel persisted in\nits course, reinstating its judgment without seriously\nconfronting the significance of the cases called to its atten-\ntion. See Patrick v. Smith, 550 U. S. 915 (vacating and\nremanding in light of Carey v. Musladin, 549 U. S. 70\n(2006)), reinstated on remand, 508 F. 3d 1256 (2007)\n(per curiam); 558 U. S. ___ (2010) (vacating and remand-\ning in light of McDaniel v. Brown, 558 U. S. ___ (2010) (per\ncuriam)), reinstated on remand sub nom. Smith v. Mitch-\nell, 624 F. 3d 1235 (2010) (per curiam). Its refusal to do so\nnecessitates this Court’s action today.\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s\n——————\n  * The dissent’s review of the evidence presented to the jury over seven\ndays is precisely the sort of reweighing of facts that is precluded by\nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 324 (1979), and precisely the sort of\nsecond-guessing of a state court decision applying Jackson that is\nprecluded by AEDPA, §2254(d). The dissent’s views on how “adamant-\nly” experts would testify today as opposed to at the time of trial, post, at\n6 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.), are of course pure speculation, as would be\nany views on how a jury would react to less adamant testimony.\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

I set out below my\nreasons for concluding that discretion, soundly exercised,\nwould have occasioned denial of California’s petition for\nreview.\n  The Magistrate Judge who reviewed respondent Shirley\nRee Smith’s habeas corpus petition in the first instance\nconcluded, as the Court does today, that relief was unwar­\nranted. He observed, however, that the evidence, “though\nclearly sufficient to support a conviction, raises many\nquestions”:\n    “Grandmothers, especially those not serving as the\n    primary caretakers, are not the typical perpetrators\n    [in shaken baby cases]. Further, [Smith] was helping\n    her daughter raise her other children (a [4-year-old]\n    and a 14-month-old) and there was no hint of [Smith]\n    abusing or neglecting these other children, who were\n    in the room with Etzel when he died. Still further,\n    there was no evidence of any precipitating event that\n    might have caused [Smith] to snap and assault her\n    grandson. She was not trapped in a hopeless situa­\n    tion with a child she did not want or love. Nor was\n    she forced to single-handedly care for a baby that had\n    been crying all day and all night. In fact, there is no\n    evidence that Etzel was doing anything other than\n2                    CAVAZOS v. SMITH\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n    sleeping the night he died. In addition, [Smith’s]\n    daughter [Tomeka], Etzel’s mother, was in the room\n    next door when Etzel died. The medical evidence was\n    not typical either, in that some of the telltale signs\n    usually found in shaken baby cases did not exist in\n    this case.” Smith v. Mitchell, Case No. CV 01–4484–\n    ABC (CD Cal., Mar. 22, 2004), p. 10, App. I to Pet. for\n    Cert. 65.\nThe District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge’s rec­\nommendation to deny Smith’s petition, but granted a\ncertificate of appealability, recognizing that “reasonable\njurists would find the [court’s] assessment of [Smith’s]\nclaims debatable.” Order in No. CV 01–4484–ABC (CD\nCal., Apr. 29, 2004), Doc. 36, p. 1.\n  After full briefing and argument, the Ninth Circuit\nreversed the District Court’s judgment. The Court of\nAppeals acknowledged the limitations on its authority.\n“We approach this case,” the court said, “with a firm\nawareness of the very strict limits that the [Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA)] places\non our collateral review of state criminal convictions.”\nSmith v. Mitchell, 437 F. 3d 884, 888–889 (CA9 2006).\nAccurately describing the standards applicable under\nAEDPA and Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979), and\nreviewing the evidence in some detail, the court concluded\nthat “[i]n this most unusual case,. . . the [California] Court\nof Appeal unreasonably applied Jackson.” 437 F. 3d, at\n889.\n  Beyond question, the Court today reviews a case as\ntragic as it is extraordinary and fact intensive. By taking\nup the case, one may ask, what does the Court achieve\nother than to prolong Smith’s suffering and her separation\nfrom her family. Is this Court’s intervention really neces­\nsary? Our routine practice counsels no.\n  Error correction is “outside the mainstream of the\n                    Cite as: 565 U.

Hartnett, Supreme Court Practice\n§5.12(c)(3), p. 351 (9th ed. 2007). As this Court’s Rule 10\ninforms, “[a] petition for a writ of certiorari is rarely\ngranted when the asserted error [is] . . . the misapplication\nof a properly stated rule of law.” The Ninth Circuit cor­\nrectly described the relevant legal rules under AEDPA and\nJackson v. Virginia. This Court, therefore, has no law­\nclarifying role to play. Its summary adjudication seems to\nme all the more untoward for these reasons: What is now\nknown about shaken baby syndrome (SBS) casts grave\ndoubt on the charge leveled against Smith; and uncontra­\ndicted evidence shows that she poses no danger whatever\nto her family or anyone else in society.\n   I turn first to the medical evidence presented at trial.\nDr. Carpenter, the autopsy supervisor, testified that the\nfollowing symptoms are consistent with, but not required\nfor, a diagnosis of SBS: cerebral edema, subdural hemor­\nrhage, retinal hemorrhage, bleeding at the joints of the\nback of the neck, bruises on the arms, fractures of the ribs,\nand internal injuries to the buttocks, abdominal organs,\nand chest organs. Tr. 575. Few of these signs of SBS were\npresent here. Etzel’s subdural hemorrhage and subarach­\nnoid hemorrhage were “minimal,” insufficient to cause\ndeath. Id., at 540–541, 557–558, 675, 693, 700, 729, 1484–\n1485. There was no brain swelling and no retinal hemor­\nrhage in either eye. Id., at 580, 693, 802, 1274.1 Similarly\nabsent were any fractures, sprains, bleeding in the joints,\nor displacement of joints. Id., at 682. A “tiny” abrasion on\nthe skin and a corresponding bruise under the scalp did\nnot produce brain trauma. Id., at 555, 562, 576, 712–713.\n   These findings led Dr. Carpenter, the autopsy supervi­\n——————\n  1 The State’s third expert, Dr. Chadwick, who was not present at\n\nEtzel’s autopsy, testified that there may have been some swelling. But\nhe conceded that any swelling could not have caused death. Tr. 1478.\n4                        CAVAZOS v. SMITH\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nsor, and Dr. Erlich, who performed Etzel’s autopsy, to rule\nout two commonly proffered causes of death in SBS cases:\nmassive bleeding and massive swelling that create pres­\nsure and push the brain downward. Id., at 541, 551–552,\n729–730, 801. Instead, they opined, Etzel’s death was\ncaused by direct injury—shearing or tearing of the brain­\nstem or the brain itself. Id., at 694–696, 729–730, 801,\n1298. The autopsy revealed no physical evidence of such\ninjury, either grossly or microscopically. Id., at 730, 763,\n803–804, 1298–1299. Dr. Carpenter was unable to state\nwhich particular areas of the brain were injured, and the\nneuropathologist found no evidence of specific brain inju­\nry. Id., at 696, 1475. No doctor located any tear. Indeed,\nthe examining physicians did not cut open Etzel’s brain­\nstem, or submit it to neuropathology, because, in their own\nestimation, “[w]e wouldn’t have seen anything anyway.”\nId., at 803, 1299.2\n   Neither doctor testified to ever having performed an\nautopsy on an infant in which a similar conclusion was\nreached. Nor did either physician point to any medical\nliterature supporting their belief that shearing or tearing\nof the brainstem or the brain itself caused Etzel’s death.\nId., at 694–696, 801–802. Dr. Carpenter nevertheless\nmaintained that when there is subdural hemorrhage\nwithout signs of external trauma to the head or skull, the\ninjury is necessarily caused by violent shaking.

Noteworthy in this regard, prosecution\nwitnesses Carpenter and Erlich testified that the belated\ndiagnosis of old (i.e., chronic) blood in Etzel’s brain and\naround his optic nerves did not change their initial cause­\nof-death findings, because rebleeding of old subdural blood\ndoes not occur in infants.

Instead, the evidence\nindicated that Smith was warm hearted, sensitive, and\ngentle. Tr. 1086. As earlier observed, see supra, at 1, the\nMagistrate Judge noted the absence of any motive or\nprecipitating event that might have led Smith to shake\nEtzel violently. Although shaking may quiet a crying\nchild, Tr. 601, no evidence showed that Etzel was crying in\nthe hours before he died, id., at 444. To the contrary: Any\nloud crying likely would have woken Etzel’s siblings,\nYondale, age 14 months, and Yolanda, age 4, asleep only\nfeet away, even Etzel’s mother, Tomeka, asleep in the\nneighboring room. Id., at 335, 358–361. Yet no one’s\nslumber was disturbed. Id., at 358–361.\n   The prosecution relied on the testimony of a social\nworker, who asserted that Smith, after hearing that the\ncause of Etzel’s death had been changed from Sudden\nInfant Death Syndrome (SIDS) to shaken baby syndrome,\nid., at 840, and after stating that she had given Etzel “a\nlittle shake, a jostle to awaken him” when she found him\nunresponsive, asked “something like ‘Oh, my God. Did I\ndo it? Did I do it? Oh, my God.’ ” Id., at 842, 847.3 Etzel’s\nmother, Tomeka, contradicted this account. According to\nTomeka, after the social worker accused Smith of killing\nEtzel, Smith started crying, id., at 429–430, and respond­\ned, “No, I didn’t,” id., at 387. Taking the social worker’s\nversion of events as true, Smith’s distraught and equivocal\nquestion fairly cannot be equated to a confession of guilt.\nGiving a baby “a little shake, a jostle to wake him,” ante,\nat 2 (internal quotation marks omitted), after finding him\nunexpectedly unresponsive, surely is not an admission to\nshaking a child violently, causing his brainstem to tear.\n\n\n——————\n  3 The social worker also testified that Etzel’s mother, Tomeka, told\n\nSmith: “If it wasn’t for you this wouldn’t have happened.” Id., at 847.\nTomeka denied making any statement to that effect.

In a case as trying as this one, compe­\ntent counsel might have persuaded the jury to disbelieve\nthe prosecution’s case. A few examples from the record\nare illustrative. At the suppression hearing, the presiding\njudge was so disturbed about Eriye’s preparation for trial\nthat he remarked to the defendant, “Miss Smith, I’m\nscared.” Tr. A52. Eriye badly misportrayed the burden of\nproof when he declared, both at the suppression hearing\nand in his opening remarks, that he would prove, beyond a\nshadow of a doubt, that Smith was not guilty. Id., at A58–\nA59, 213. The two experts Eriye called presented testi­\nmony that hardly meshed.5\n   In sum, this is a notably fact-bound case in which the\nCourt of Appeals unquestionably stated the correct rule of\nlaw. It is thus “the type of case in which we are most\ninclined to deny certiorari.” Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S.\n419, 460 (1995) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Nevertheless, the\nCourt is bent on rebuking the Ninth Circuit for what it\nconceives to be defiance of our prior remands. See ante, at\n8. I would not ignore Smith’s plight and choose her case\nas a fit opportunity to teach the Ninth Circuit a lesson.\n   But even if granting review qualified as a proper exer­\ncise of our discretionary authority, I would resist summary\nreversal of the Court of Appeals’ decision.

S. 307 (1979), makes clear that it is the responsibility of\nthe jury—not the court—to decide what conclusions should\nbe drawn from evidence admitted at trial. A reviewing\ncourt may set aside the jury’s verdict on the ground of\ninsufficient evidence only if no rational trier of fact could\nhave agreed with the jury. What is more, a federal court\nmay not overturn a state court decision rejecting a suf-\nficiency of the evidence challenge simply because the fed-\neral court disagrees with the state court.

The\nCourt of Appeals in this case substituted its judgment for\nthat of a California jury on the question whether the\nprosecution’s or the defense’s expert witnesses more per-\nsuasively explained the cause of a death. For this reason,\ncertiorari is granted and the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals is reversed.\n                       *   *     *\n  This case concerns the death of 7-week-old Etzel Glass.\n2                    CAVAZOS v. SMITH\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nOn November 29, 1996, Etzel’s mother, Tomeka, put\nEtzel to sleep on a sofa before going to sleep herself in\nanother room. Respondent Shirley Ree Smith—Tomeka’s\nmother—slept on the floor next to Etzel. Several hours later,\nSmith ran into Tomeka’s room, holding Etzel, who was\nlimp, and told her that “[s]omething [was] wrong with\nEtzel.” Tr. 416. By the time emergency officials arrived,\nEtzel was not breathing and had no heartbeat. Smith\nreported that she thought Etzel had fallen off the sofa.\nThe officials’ efforts to resuscitate Etzel failed.\n  Doctors initially attributed Etzel’s death to sudden\ninfant death syndrome (SIDS), the customary diagnosis\nwhen an infant shows no outward signs of trauma. But\nafter an autopsy, the coroner concluded that the cause of\ndeath was instead shaken baby syndrome (SBS). When a\nsocial worker informed Smith of that finding, Smith told\nher that Etzel had not responded to her touch while sleep-\ning, so she had picked him up and given him “a little\nshake, a jostle” to wake him. Id., at 842. According to the\nsocial worker, Smith then said something to the effect of,\n“Oh, my God. Did I do it? Did I do it? Oh, my God.” Id.,\nat 847 (internal quotation marks omitted). In an inter-\nview with the police a few days later, Smith said that she\nhad shaken Etzel, but then she corrected herself and said\nthat she had twisted him to try to elicit a reaction. Smith\nwas arrested and charged with assault on a child resulting\nin death. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. §273ab (West 2008)\n(“Any person who, having the care or custody of a child\nwho is under eight years of age, assaults the child by\nmeans of force that to a reasonable person would be likely\nto produce great bodily injury, resulting in the child’s\ndeath, shall be punished by imprisonment . . .”).\n  At trial, the jury heard seven days of expert medical\ntestimony on the cause of Etzel’s death. The prosecution\noffered three experts, each of whom attested that Etzel’s\ndeath was the result of SBS—not SIDS, as the defense\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ncontended. The first expert, Dr. Eugene Carpenter, was\nthe medical examiner for the Los Angeles County Coroner\nwho had supervised Etzel’s autopsy. Dr. Carpenter is\nboard certified in forensic, anatomic, and clinical pathol-\nogy. He testified that Etzel’s autopsy revealed recent hem-\norrhages in the brain, and he opined that the bleeding and\nother features of Etzel’s pathology, including a bruise and\nabrasion on the lower back of the baby’s head, were con-\nsistent with violent shaking. Dr. Carpenter identified two\nmeans by which shaking can result in a baby’s death: The\nfirst is that the shaking causes blood vessels in the brain\nto tear, creating a pool of blood that pushes the brain\ndownward into the spinal canal, resulting in death but\nlittle direct damage to the brain. The second is that the\nshaking itself is sufficiently severe that the brain directly\ntears in vital areas, causing death with very little bleed-\ning. Dr. Carpenter testified that Etzel’s injuries were\nconsistent with the latter pathology. He also explained\nthat the injuries could not be attributed to either a fall\nfrom the sofa or the administration of cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation. Nor, according to Dr. Carpenter, was it\npossible that Etzel perished from SIDS, given the signs of\ninternal trauma. Dr. Carpenter did testify, however, that\nwhile SBS victims often suffer retinal hemorrhaging,\nEtzel’s autopsy revealed no such injury.\n   The prosecution’s second expert, Dr. Stephanie Erlich,\nwas the associate deputy medical examiner who actually\nperformed Etzel’s autopsy. She is board certified in ana-\ntomic pathology and neuropathology. She corroborated\nDr. Carpenter’s testimony about the autopsy findings, and\nadded that a followup neuropathological examination of\nEtzel’s brain confirmed the existence of recent hemorrhag-\ning. Noting only a minimal amount of new blood in Etzel’s\nbrain, she testified that the cause of death was direct\ntrauma to the brainstem. On cross-examination, she\nagreed with defense counsel that retinal hemorrhaging\n4                    CAVAZOS v. SMITH\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n(absent in Etzel’s case) is present in 75 to 80 percent of\nSBS cases.\n   The third prosecution expert, Dr. David Chadwick, is\nboard certified in pediatrics and the author of articles on\nchildhood death by abusive trauma. He testified that\nEtzel’s injuries were consistent with SBS and that old\ntrauma could not have been the cause of the child’s death.\n   The defense called two experts to dispute these conclu-\nsions. The first, pathologist Dr. Richard Siegler, testified\nthat Etzel died from brain trauma, but that it was not the\nresult of SBS, given the lack of retinal hemorrhaging. He\nadmitted on cross-examination, however, that an absence\nof retinal hemorrhaging does not exclude a finding of SBS.\nHe also acknowledged that he did not believe the cause\nof Etzel’s death was SIDS. According to Dr. Siegler,\nEtzel died from old trauma, an opinion he reached on the\nbasis of studying photographs of the neuropathological\nexamination.\n   The other defense expert, pediatric neurologist Dr.\nWilliam Goldie, testified that Etzel’s death was due to\nSIDS. He noted that Etzel was born with jaundice, a\nheart murmur, and low birth weight—making him more\nsusceptible to SIDS. Dr. Goldie testified that pathologists\nhad not been able to determine the cause of Etzel’s death\nand that the bleeding could be attributed to the resuscita-\ntion efforts.\n   The jury found Smith guilty. Concluding that the jury\n“carefully weighed” the “tremendous amount of evidence”\nsupporting the verdict, Tr. 1649, the trial judge denied\nSmith’s motion for a new trial and sentenced her to an\nindeterminate term of 15 years to life in prison.\n   On direct review, Smith contended that the evidence\nwas not sufficient to establish that Etzel died from SBS.\nAfter thoroughly reviewing the competing medical testi-\nmony, the California Court of Appeal rejected this claim,\nconcluding:\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

Mitchell, 437 F. 3d 884 (2006).\nDespite the plentitude of expert testimony in the trial\n6                    CAVAZOS v. SMITH\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nrecord concluding that sudden shearing or tearing of the\nbrainstem was the cause of Etzel’s death, the Ninth Cir-\ncuit determined that there was “no evidence to permit an\nexpert conclusion one way or the other” on that question\nbecause there was “no physical evidence of . . . tearing or\nshearing, and no other evidence supporting death by\nviolent shaking.” Id., at 890. The court said that the\nState’s experts “reached [their] conclusion because there\nwas no evidence in the brain itself of the cause of death.”\nIbid. (emphasis in original). The court concluded that\nbecause “[a]bsence of evidence cannot constitute proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt,” ibid., the California Court of\nAppeal had “unreasonably applied” this Court’s opinion in\nJackson v. Virginia in upholding Smith’s conviction, 437\nF. 3d, at 890.\n   That conclusion was plainly wrong. Jackson says that\nevidence is sufficient to support a conviction so long as\n“after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\nthe prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found\nthe essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.” 443 U. S., at 319. It also unambiguously instructs\nthat a reviewing court “faced with a record of historical\nfacts that supports conflicting inferences must presume—\neven if it does not affirmatively appear in the record—that\nthe trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the\nprosecution, and must defer to that resolution.” Id., at\n326. When the deference to state court decisions required\nby §2254(d) is applied to the state court’s already deferen-\ntial review, see Renico, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11),\nthere can be no doubt of the Ninth Circuit’s error below.\n   The jury was presented with competing views of how\nEtzel died. It was made aware of the various experts’\nqualifications and their familiarity with both the subject\nof SBS and the physical condition of Etzel’s body. It ob-\nserved the attorneys for each party cross-examine the\nexperts and elicit concessions from them. The State’s\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)            7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nexperts, whom the jury was entitled to believe, opined that\nthe physical evidence was consistent with, and best ex-\nplained by, death from sudden tearing of the brainstem\ncaused by shaking. The Ninth Circuit’s assertion that\nthese experts “reached [their] conclusion because there\nwas no evidence in the brain itself of the cause of death” is\nsimply false. There was “evidence in the brain itself.” The\nautopsy revealed indications of recent trauma to Etzel’s\nbrain, such as subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhaging,\nhemorrhaging around the optic nerves, and the presence\nof a blood clot between the brain’s hemispheres. The\nautopsy also revealed a bruise and abrasion on the lower\nback of Etzel’s head. These affirmative indications of\ntrauma formed the basis of the experts’ opinion that Etzel\ndied from shaking so severe that his brainstem tore.\n  Defense counsel made certain that the jury understood\nthat the prosecution’s experts were unable to identify the\nprecise point of tearing itself. But as Judge Bea noted in\nhis dissent from the Ninth Circuit’s denial of rehearing en\nbanc, the experts explained why the location of the tear\nwas undetectable: “Etzel’s death happened so quickly that\nthe effects of the trauma did not have time to develop.”\nSmith v. Mitchell, 453 F. 3d 1203, 1207 (2006). According\nto the prosecutions’ experts, there was simply no oppor-\ntunity for swelling to occur around the brainstem before\nEtzel died.\n  In light of the evidence presented at trial, the Ninth\nCircuit plainly erred in concluding that the jury’s ver-\ndict was irrational, let alone that it was unreasonable for\nthe California Court of Appeal to think otherwise. See\n§2254(d). Doubts about whether Smith is in fact guilty are\nunderstandable. But it is not the job of this Court, and\nwas not that of the Ninth Circuit, to decide whether the\nState’s theory was correct. The jury decided that question,\n8                         CAVAZOS v. SMITH\n\n                               Per Curiam\n\nand its decision is supported by the record.*\n   It is said that Smith, who already has served years in\nprison, has been punished enough, and that she poses no\ndanger to society. These or other considerations perhaps\nwould be grounds to seek clemency, a prerogative granted\nto executive authorities to help ensure that justice is\ntempered by mercy. It is not clear to the Court whether\nthis process has been invoked, or, if so, what its course has\nbeen. It is not for the Judicial Branch to determine the\nstandards for this discretion. If the clemency power is\nexercised in either too generous or too stingy a way, that\ncalls for political correctives, not judicial intervention.\n   The decision below cannot be allowed to stand. This\nCourt vacated and remanded this judgment twice before,\ncalling the panel’s attention to this Court’s opinions high-\nlighting the necessity of deference to state courts in\n§2254(d) habeas cases. Each time the panel persisted in\nits course, reinstating its judgment without seriously\nconfronting the significance of the cases called to its atten-\ntion. See Patrick v. Smith, 550 U. S. 915 (vacating and\nremanding in light of Carey v. Musladin, 549 U. S. 70\n(2006)), reinstated on remand, 508 F. 3d 1256 (2007)\n(per curiam); 558 U.

Decided October 31, 2011\n\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER and\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join, dissenting.\n  The Court’s summary disposition of this case, in my\njudgment, is a misuse of discretion. I set out below my\nreasons for concluding that discretion, soundly exercised,\nwould have occasioned denial of California’s petition for\nreview.\n  The Magistrate Judge who reviewed respondent Shirley\nRee Smith’s habeas corpus petition in the first instance\nconcluded, as the Court does today, that relief was unwar­\nranted. He observed, however, that the evidence, “though\nclearly sufficient to support a conviction, raises many\nquestions”:\n    “Grandmothers, especially those not serving as the\n    primary caretakers, are not the typical perpetrators\n    [in shaken baby cases]. Further, [Smith] was helping\n    her daughter raise her other children (a [4-year-old]\n    and a 14-month-old) and there was no hint of [Smith]\n    abusing or neglecting these other children, who were\n    in the room with Etzel when he died. Still further,\n    there was no evidence of any precipitating event that\n    might have caused [Smith] to snap and assault her\n    grandson. She was not trapped in a hopeless situa­\n    tion with a child she did not want or love. Nor was\n    she forced to single-handedly care for a baby that had\n    been crying all day and all night. In fact, there is no\n    evidence that Etzel was doing anything other than\n2                    CAVAZOS v. SMITH\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n    sleeping the night he died. In addition, [Smith’s]\n    daughter [Tomeka], Etzel’s mother, was in the room\n    next door when Etzel died. The medical evidence was\n    not typical either, in that some of the telltale signs\n    usually found in shaken baby cases did not exist in\n    this case.” Smith v. Mitchell, Case No. CV 01–4484–\n    ABC (CD Cal., Mar. 22, 2004), p. 10, App. I to Pet. for\n    Cert. 65.\nThe District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge’s rec­\nommendation to deny Smith’s petition, but granted a\ncertificate of appealability, recognizing that “reasonable\njurists would find the [court’s] assessment of [Smith’s]\nclaims debatable.” Order in No. CV 01–4484–ABC (CD\nCal., Apr. 29, 2004), Doc. 36, p. 1.\n  After full briefing and argument, the Ninth Circuit\nreversed the District Court’s judgment. The Court of\nAppeals acknowledged the limitations on its authority.\n“We approach this case,” the court said, “with a firm\nawareness of the very strict limits that the [Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA)] places\non our collateral review of state criminal convictions.”\nSmith v. Mitchell, 437 F. 3d 884, 888–889 (CA9 2006).\nAccurately describing the standards applicable under\nAEDPA and Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979), and\nreviewing the evidence in some detail, the court concluded\nthat “[i]n this most unusual case,. . . the [California] Court\nof Appeal unreasonably applied Jackson.” 437 F. 3d, at\n889.\n  Beyond question, the Court today reviews a case as\ntragic as it is extraordinary and fact intensive. By taking\nup the case, one may ask, what does the Court achieve\nother than to prolong Smith’s suffering and her separation\nfrom her family. Is this Court’s intervention really neces­\nsary? Our routine practice counsels no.\n  Error correction is “outside the mainstream of the\n                    Cite as: 565 U.

Hartnett, Supreme Court Practice\n§5.12(c)(3), p. 351 (9th ed. 2007). As this Court’s Rule 10\ninforms, “[a] petition for a writ of certiorari is rarely\ngranted when the asserted error [is] . . . the misapplication\nof a properly stated rule of law.” The Ninth Circuit cor­\nrectly described the relevant legal rules under AEDPA and\nJackson v. Virginia. This Court, therefore, has no law­\nclarifying role to play. Its summary adjudication seems to\nme all the more untoward for these reasons: What is now\nknown about shaken baby syndrome (SBS) casts grave\ndoubt on the charge leveled against Smith; and uncontra­\ndicted evidence shows that she poses no danger whatever\nto her family or anyone else in society.\n   I turn first to the medical evidence presented at trial.\nDr. Carpenter, the autopsy supervisor, testified that the\nfollowing symptoms are consistent with, but not required\nfor, a diagnosis of SBS: cerebral edema, subdural hemor­\nrhage, retinal hemorrhage, bleeding at the joints of the\nback of the neck, bruises on the arms, fractures of the ribs,\nand internal injuries to the buttocks, abdominal organs,\nand chest organs. Tr. 575. Few of these signs of SBS were\npresent here. Etzel’s subdural hemorrhage and subarach­\nnoid hemorrhage were “minimal,” insufficient to cause\ndeath. Id., at 540–541, 557–558, 675, 693, 700, 729, 1484–\n1485. There was no brain swelling and no retinal hemor­\nrhage in either eye. Id., at 580, 693, 802, 1274.1 Similarly\nabsent were any fractures, sprains, bleeding in the joints,\nor displacement of joints. Id., at 682. A “tiny” abrasion on\nthe skin and a corresponding bruise under the scalp did\nnot produce brain trauma. Id., at 555, 562, 576, 712–713.\n   These findings led Dr. Carpenter, the autopsy supervi­\n——————\n  1 The State’s third expert, Dr. Chadwick, who was not present at\n\nEtzel’s autopsy, testified that there may have been some swelling. But\nhe conceded that any swelling could not have caused death. Tr. 1478.\n4                        CAVAZOS v. SMITH\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nsor, and Dr. Erlich, who performed Etzel’s autopsy, to rule\nout two commonly proffered causes of death in SBS cases:\nmassive bleeding and massive swelling that create pres­\nsure and push the brain downward. Id., at 541, 551–552,\n729–730, 801. Instead, they opined, Etzel’s death was\ncaused by direct injury—shearing or tearing of the brain­\nstem or the brain itself. Id., at 694–696, 729–730, 801,\n1298. The autopsy revealed no physical evidence of such\ninjury, either grossly or microscopically. Id., at 730, 763,\n803–804, 1298–1299. Dr. Carpenter was unable to state\nwhich particular areas of the brain were injured, and the\nneuropathologist found no evidence of specific brain inju­\nry. Id., at 696, 1475. No doctor located any tear. Indeed,\nthe examining physicians did not cut open Etzel’s brain­\nstem, or submit it to neuropathology, because, in their own\nestimation, “[w]e wouldn’t have seen anything anyway.”\nId., at 803, 1299.2\n   Neither doctor testified to ever having performed an\nautopsy on an infant in which a similar conclusion was\nreached. Nor did either physician point to any medical\nliterature supporting their belief that shearing or tearing\nof the brainstem or the brain itself caused Etzel’s death.\nId., at 694–696, 801–802. Dr. Carpenter nevertheless\nmaintained that when there is subdural hemorrhage\nwithout signs of external trauma to the head or skull, the\ninjury is necessarily caused by violent shaking. Id., at\n576–577, 660–661. Smith’s conviction thus turned on, as\nDr. Erlich put it, “direct trauma which we don’t see to the\nbrainstem.” Id., at 801. That this gave the Ninth Circuit\npause is understandable. Dr. Erlich herself conceded that\n“[i]t is a difficult concept to absorb.” Id., at 1298.\n   Reason to suspect the Carpenter-Erlich thesis has\n——————\n  2 Dr. Chadwick mentioned new methods, not then standard in medi­\n\ncal examiners’ offices and not used here, which may reveal this type of\nbrainstem damage.

Noteworthy in this regard, prosecution\nwitnesses Carpenter and Erlich testified that the belated\ndiagnosis of old (i.e., chronic) blood in Etzel’s brain and\naround his optic nerves did not change their initial cause­\nof-death findings, because rebleeding of old subdural blood\ndoes not occur in infants. Tr. 608–609, 672–673, 721–722,\n771, 776, 1269–1270, 1283. Recent scientific opinion\nundermines this testimony. See Miller & Miller, Over­\nrepresentation of Males in Traumatic Brain Injury of\nInfancy and in Infants with Macrocephaly, 31 Am. J.\nForensic Med. & Pathology 165, 170 (2010) (“Small,\nasymptomatic [subdural hematomas] from the normal\ntrauma of the birth process can spontaneously rebleed or\nrebleed with minimal forces, enlarge, and then present\nwith clinical symptoms and [subdural hematoma, retinal\nhemorrhages, and neurologic dysfunction] in the first year\nof life. . . . [This situation] mimic[s] child abuse, and we\nbelieve many such infants in the past have been mistaken­\nly diagnosed as victims of child abuse, when they were\nlikely not.”). What is now known about SBS hypotheses\nseems to me worthy of considerable weight in the discre­\ntionary decision whether to take up this tragic case.\n   I consider next the State’s meager nonmedical evidence.\nThere was no evidence whatever that Smith abused her\ngrandchildren in the past or acted with any malicious\n                    Cite as: 565 U.

Instead, the evidence\nindicated that Smith was warm hearted, sensitive, and\ngentle. Tr. 1086. As earlier observed, see supra, at 1, the\nMagistrate Judge noted the absence of any motive or\nprecipitating event that might have led Smith to shake\nEtzel violently. Although shaking may quiet a crying\nchild, Tr. 601, no evidence showed that Etzel was crying in\nthe hours before he died, id., at 444. To the contrary: Any\nloud crying likely would have woken Etzel’s siblings,\nYondale, age 14 months, and Yolanda, age 4, asleep only\nfeet away, even Etzel’s mother, Tomeka, asleep in the\nneighboring room. Id., at 335, 358–361. Yet no one’s\nslumber was disturbed. Id., at 358–361.\n   The prosecution relied on the testimony of a social\nworker, who asserted that Smith, after hearing that the\ncause of Etzel’s death had been changed from Sudden\nInfant Death Syndrome (SIDS) to shaken baby syndrome,\nid., at 840, and after stating that she had given Etzel “a\nlittle shake, a jostle to awaken him” when she found him\nunresponsive, asked “something like ‘Oh, my God. Did I\ndo it? Did I do it? Oh, my God.’ ” Id., at 842, 847.3 Etzel’s\nmother, Tomeka, contradicted this account. According to\nTomeka, after the social worker accused Smith of killing\nEtzel, Smith started crying, id., at 429–430, and respond­\ned, “No, I didn’t,” id., at 387. Taking the social worker’s\nversion of events as true, Smith’s distraught and equivocal\nquestion fairly cannot be equated to a confession of guilt.\nGiving a baby “a little shake, a jostle to wake him,” ante,\nat 2 (internal quotation marks omitted), after finding him\nunexpectedly unresponsive, surely is not an admission to\nshaking a child violently, causing his brainstem to tear.\n\n\n——————\n  3 The social worker also testified that Etzel’s mother, Tomeka, told\n\nSmith: “If it wasn’t for you this wouldn’t have happened.” Id., at 847.\nTomeka denied making any statement to that effect. Id., at 389.\n8                         CAVAZOS v. SMITH\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   Moreover, Smith’s counsel, Ubiwe Eriye,4 represented\nher poorly at trial. In a case as trying as this one, compe­\ntent counsel might have persuaded the jury to disbelieve\nthe prosecution’s case. A few examples from the record\nare illustrative. At the suppression hearing, the presiding\njudge was so disturbed about Eriye’s preparation for trial\nthat he remarked to the defendant, “Miss Smith, I’m\nscared.” Tr. A52. Eriye badly misportrayed the burden of\nproof when he declared, both at the suppression hearing\nand in his opening remarks, that he would prove, beyond a\nshadow of a doubt, that Smith was not guilty. Id., at A58–\nA59, 213. The two experts Eriye called presented testi­\nmony that hardly meshed.5\n   In sum, this is a notably fact-bound case in which the\nCourt of Appeals unquestionably stated the correct rule of\nlaw. It is thus “the type of case in which we are most\ninclined to deny certiorari.” Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S.\n419, 460 (1995) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Nevertheless, the\nCourt is bent on rebuking the Ninth Circuit for what it\nconceives to be defiance of our prior remands. See ante, at\n8. I would not ignore Smith’s plight and choose her case\nas a fit opportunity to teach the Ninth Circuit a lesson.\n   But even if granting review qualified as a proper exer­\ncise of our discretionary authority, I would resist summary\nreversal of the Court of Appeals’ decision. The fact­\nintensive character of the case calls for attentive review of\nthe record, including a trial transcript that runs over\n1,500 pages. Careful inspection of the record would be\naided by the adversarial presentation that full briefing\n——————\n   4 Eriye has since resigned from the California Bar with discipline\n\ncharges pending.\n   5 Dr. Goldie testified that the old blood in Etzel’s brain did not con­\n\ntribute to his death, and Etzel died of SIDS. Id., at 994–995, 1403. In\ncontrast, Dr. Siegler testified that the old blood provided the basis for\nhis conclusion that Etzel died of an earlier brain trauma, id., at 1152–\n1153, 1166–1167, not SIDS, id., at 1193–1194.\n                  Cite as: 565 U.
