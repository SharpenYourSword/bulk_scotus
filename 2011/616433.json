Decided October 31, 2011\n\n\n   The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting from the denial of certiorari.\n   Today the Court rejects an opportunity to provide clarity\nto an Establishment Clause jurisprudence in shambles. A\nsharply divided Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has\ndeclared unconstitutional a private association’s efforts\nto memorialize slain police officers with white roadside\ncrosses, holding that the crosses convey to a reasonable\nobserver that the State of Utah is endorsing Christianity.\nThe Tenth Circuit’s opinion is one of the latest in a long\nline of “ ‘religious display’ ” decisions that, because of this\nCourt’s nebulous Establishment Clause analyses, turn on\nlittle more than “judicial predilections.” See Van Orden v.\nPerry, 545 U. S. 677, 696, 697 (2005) (THOMAS, J., concur­\nring). Because our jurisprudence has confounded the\nlower courts and rendered the constitutionality of displays\nof religious imagery on government property anyone’s\nguess, I would grant certiorari.\n                            I\n  The Utah Highway Patrol Association (Association) is a\nprivate organization dedicated to supporting Utah High­\n2        UTAH HIGHWAY PATROL ASSN. v. AMERICAN\n                    ATHEISTS, INC.                           \n\n                  THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\nway Patrol officers and their families.1 In 1998, the Asso­\nciation began commemorating officers who died in the line\nof duty by placing memorials, in the form of 12- by 6-foot\nwhite crosses, at or near locations where the officers were\nkilled. The fallen officer’s name, rank, and badge number\nare emblazoned across the full length of the horizontal\nbeam of each memorial. The vertical beam bears the\nsymbol of the Utah Highway Patrol, the year of the of­\nficer’s death, and a plaque displaying the officer’s picture,\nhis biographical information, and details of his death. To\ndate, the Association has erected 13 cross memorials.\n   The Association chose the cross because it believed that\ncrosses are used both generally in cemeteries to commem­\norate the dead and specifically by uniformed services to\nmemorialize those who died in the line of duty. The Asso­\nciation also believed that only the cross effectively and\nsimultaneously conveyed the messages of death, honor,\nremembrance, gratitude, sacrifice, and safety that the Asso­\nciation wished to communicate to the public. Surviving\nfamily members of the fallen officers approved each\nmemorial, and no family ever requested that the Associa­\ntion use a symbol other than the cross.\n   The private Association designed, funded, owns, and\nmaintains the memorials. To ensure that the memorials\nwould be visible to the public, safe to view, and near the\nspot of the officers’ deaths, the Association requested and\nreceived permission from the State of Utah to erect some\nof the memorials on roadside public rights-of-way, at rest\nareas, and on the lawn of the Utah Highway Patrol office.\nIn the permit, the State expressed that it “neither ap­\nproves or disapproves the memorial marker.” Brief in\nOpposition 3, n. 3 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Respondents, American Atheists, Inc., and some of its\n——————\n  1 These cases were decided on a motion for summary judgment.\n\nThese facts are undisputed.\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

The Association, a petitioner along with the state\nofficials in this Court, intervened to defend the memorials.\nThe District Court granted summary judgment in favor of\npetitioners.\n  A panel of the Tenth Circuit reversed. As an initial\nmatter, the panel noted that this Court remains “sharply\ndivided on the standard governing Establishment Clause\ncases.” American Atheists, Inc. v. Duncan, 616 F. 3d 1145,\n1156 (2010). The panel therefore looked to Circuit prece­\ndent to determine the applicable standard and then ap­\nplied the so-called “Lemon/endorsement test,” which asks\nwhether the challenged governmental practice has the\nactual purpose of endorsing religion or whether it has that\neffect from the perspective of a “reasonable observer.” Id.,\nat 1157; see County of Allegheny v. American Civil Lib-\nerties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S.\n573, 592–594 (1989) (modifying the three-pronged test of\nLemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (1971), which considered\nwhether a government action has a secular purpose, has\nthe primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, or\nfosters an excessive entanglement between government\nand religion). The court concluded that, even though the\ncross memorials had a secular purpose, they would none­\ntheless “convey to a reasonable observer that the state of\nUtah is endorsing Christianity.” 616 F. 3d, at 1160. This\nwas so, the court concluded, because a cross is “the\npreeminent symbol of Christianity,” and the crosses stood\nalone, on public land, bearing the Utah Highway Patrol’s\nemblem. Ibid. According to the panel, none of the other\n“contextualizing facts” sufficiently reduced the memorials’\nmessage of religious endorsement. Id., at 1161.\n4       UTAH HIGHWAY PATROL ASSN. v. AMERICAN\n                   ATHEISTS, INC.                           \n\n                 THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\n   The Tenth Circuit denied rehearing en banc, with four\njudges dissenting. The dissenters criticized the panel for\npresuming that the crosses were unconstitutional and\nthen asking whether contextual factors were sufficient to\nrebut that presumption. Instead, the dissenters argued,\nthe panel should have considered whether the crosses\namounted to an endorsement of religion in the first place\nin light of their physical characteristics, location near the\nsite of the officer’s death, commemorative purpose, selec­\ntion by surviving family members, and disavowal by the\nState. 637 F. 3d 1095, 1103–1105 (2010) (opinion of Kelly,\nJ.). The dissenters also criticized the panel’s “unreasona­\nble ‘reasonable observer,’ ” id., at 1104, describing him as\n“biased, replete with foibles, and prone to mistake,” id.,\nat 1108 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.). Noting that the court\n“continue[d] to apply (or misapply) a reasonable observer/\nendorsement test that has come under much recent\nscrutiny,” the dissenters emphasized that the panel’s\ndecision was “worthy of review.” Id., at 1109–1110 (same).\n                             II\n   Unsurprisingly, the Tenth Circuit relied on its own\nprecedent, rather than on any of this Court’s cases, when\nit selected the Lemon/endorsement test as its governing\nanalysis. Our jurisprudence provides no principled ba-\nsis by which a lower court could discern whether\nLemon/endorsement, or some other test, should apply in\nEstablishment Clause cases. Some of our cases have simply\nignored the Lemon or Lemon/endorsement formulations.\nSee, e.g., Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U. S. 639 (2002);\nGood News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98\n(2001); Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783 (1983). Other\ndecisions have indicated that the Lemon/endorsement test\nis useful, but not binding. Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S.\n668, 679 (1984) (despite Lemon’s usefulness, we are “un­\nwillin[g] to be confined to any single test or criterion in\n                      Cite as: 565 U.

S. 734, 741\n(1973) (Lemon provides “no more than helpful signposts”).\nMost recently, in Van Orden, 545 U. S. 677, a majority of\nthe Court declined to apply the Lemon/endorsement test in\nupholding a Ten Commandments monument located on\nthe grounds of a state capitol.2 Yet in another case decid­\ned the same day, McCreary County v. American Civil\nLiberties Union of Ky., 545 U. S. 844, 859–866 (2005), the\nCourt selected the Lemon/endorsement test with nary a\nword of explanation and then declared a display of the Ten\nCommandments in a courthouse to be unconstitutional.\nSee also Van Orden, supra, at 692 (SCALIA, J., concurring)\n(“I join the opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE because I think\nit accurately reflects our current Establishment Clause\njurisprudence—or at least the Establishment Clause\njurisprudence we currently apply some of the time”).\nThus, the Lemon/endorsement test continues to “stal[k]\nour Establishment Clause jurisprudence” like “some ghoul\nin a late-night horror movie that repeatedly sits up in its\ngrave and shuffles abroad, after being repeatedly killed\nand buried.” Lamb’s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union\nFree School Dist., 508 U. S. 384, 398 (1993) (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in judgment).\n   Since Van Orden and McCreary, lower courts have\nunderstandably expressed confusion. See American Civil\nLiberties Union of Ky. v. Mercer Cty., 432 F. 3d 624, 636\n——————\n  2 In  Van Orden, a plurality determined that the nature of a govern­\nment display and our Nation’s historical traditions should control. 545\nU. S., at 686; see also ibid. (“Whatever may be the fate of the Lemon\ntest in the larger scheme of Establishment Clause jurisprudence, we\nthink it not useful in dealing with the sort of passive monument that\nTexas has erected”). In a concurring opinion, JUSTICE BREYER consid­\nered the “basic purposes of the First Amendment’s Religion Clauses\nthemselves” rather than “a literal application of any particular test.”\nId., at 703–704 (opinion concurring in judgment); see also id., at 700\n(“[I]n [difficult borderline] cases, I see no test-related substitute for the\nexercise of legal judgment”).\n6           UTAH HIGHWAY PATROL ASSN. v.

Id., at 12, 16. But respond­\nents’ “Ten Commandments” rule is nothing more than a\nthinly veiled attempt to attribute reason and order where\nnone exists. Respondents offer no principled basis for\napplying one test to the Ten Commandments and another\ntest to other religious displays that may have similar\nrelevance to our legal and historical traditions. Indeed,\nthat respondents defend the purportedly uniform applica­\ntion of one Establishment Clause standard to the “Ten\nCommandments’ realm” and another standard to displays\nof other religious imagery, id., at 16, speaks volumes\nabout the superficiality and irrationality of a jurispru­\ndence meant to assess whether government has made a\n——————\nMercer Cty., 432 F. 3d 624, 636 (CA6 2005) (“Because McCreary County\nand Van Orden do not instruct otherwise, we must continue to” apply\n“Lemon, including the endorsement test”).\n  5 See Card, supra, at 1018 (applying JUSTICE BREYER’s concurring\n\nopinion in Van Orden, which “carv[ed] out an exception” from Lemon\nfor certain displays); ACLU Neb.

But\neven assuming that the lower courts uniformly under­\nstand Van Orden to apply only to those religious displays\n“factually indistinguishable” from the display in Van\nOrden, Brief in Opposition 16, that understanding con­\nflicts with JUSTICE BREYER’s controlling opinion. JUSTICE\nBREYER’s concurrence concluded that there is “no test­\nrelated substitute for the exercise of legal judgment” or\n“exact formula” in “fact-intensive,” “difficult borderline\ncases.” 545 U. S., at 700 (opinion concurring in judgment).\nNothing in his opinion indicated that only Ten Com­\nmandments displays identical to the one in Van Orden call\nfor a departure from the Lemon/endorsement test.\n   Moreover, the lower courts have not neatly confined Van\nOrden to similar Ten Commandments displays. In Myers\nv. Loudoun Cty. Public Schools, 418 F. 3d 395, 402, and\nn. 8 (2005), the Fourth Circuit applied the Van Orden\nplurality opinion and JUSTICE BREYER’s concurring analy­\nsis to resolve an Establishment Clause challenge to a\nstatute mandating recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance.\nIn Staley v.

I do not doubt that a given court could reach the\nsame result under either test. See ACLU Neb. Foundation\nv.

San\nDiego, 629 F. 3d 1099, 1107, 1125 (CA9 2011) (concluding\nthat the display of a cross was unconstitutional under\neither standard). The problem is that both tests are so\nutterly indeterminate that they permit different courts to\nreach inconsistent results. Compare Harris v. Zion, 927\nF. 2d 1401 (CA7 1991) (applying Lemon/endorsement to\nstrike down a city seal bearing a depiction of a cross), with\nMurray v.

As explained below, it is “the\nvery ‘flexibility’ of this Court’s Establishment Clause\nprecedent” that “leaves it incapable of consistent applica­\ntion.” Van Orden, supra, at 697 (THOMAS, J., concurring).\n                             III\n  In Allegheny, a majority of the Court took the view that\nthe endorsement test provides a “sound analytical frame­\nwork for evaluating governmental use of religious sym­\nbols.” 492 U.

Indeed, the Tenth Circuit stated\nbelow that its observer, although not “omniscient,” would\n“know far more than most actual members of a given\ncommunity,” and then unhelpfully concluded that “[h]ow\nmuch information we will impute to a reasonable observer\nis unclear.” 616 F. 3d, at 1159 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). But even assuming that courts could employ\nobservers of similar insight and eyesight, it is “unrealistic\nto expect different judges . . . to reach consistent answers\nas to what any beholder, the average beholder, or the\nultrareasonable beholder (as the case may be) would\nthink.” Pinette, supra, at 769, n. 3.\n                               IV\n  It comes as no surprise, then, that despite other cases\nholding that the combination of a Latin cross and a public\ninsignia on public property does not convey a message of\nreligious endorsement, see Murray, supra; Weinbaum,\nsupra, the Tenth Circuit held otherwise. And, of course,\nthe Tenth Circuit divided over what, exactly, a reasonable\nobserver would think about the Association’s memorial\ncross program.\n  First, the members of the court disagreed as to what a\nreasonable observer would see. According to the panel,\nbecause the observer would be “driving by one of the me­\nmorial crosses at 55-plus miles per hour,” he would not see\nthe fallen officer’s biographical information, but he would\nsee that the “cross conspicuously bears the imprimatur of\na state entity . . . and is found primarily on public land.”\n616 F. 3d, at 1160. According to the dissenters, on the\nother hand, if the traveling observer could see the police\ninsignia on the cross, he should also see the much larger\nname, rank, and badge number of the fallen officer embla­\nzoned above it. 637 F. 3d, at 1108–1109 (opinion of Gor­\nsuch, J.); id., at 1104 (opinion of Kelly, J.). The dissenters\nwould also have employed an observer who was able to\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

Id., at\n1109 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.).\n   Next, the members of the court disagreed about what a\nreasonable observer would feel. The panel worried that\nthe use of a Christian symbol to memorialize fallen officers\nwould cause the observer to think the Utah Highway\nPatrol and Christianity had “some connection,” leading\nhim to “fear that Christians are likely to receive preferen­\ntial treatment from the [patrol]—both in their hiring\npractices and, more generally, in the treatment that peo­\nple may expect to receive on Utah’s highways.” 616 F. 3d,\nat 1160. The dissenters’ reasonable observer, however,\nwould not take such a “paranoid,” “conspiratorial view of\nlife,” “conjur[ing] up fears of religious discrimination” by a\n“ ‘Christian police,’ ” especially in light of the more plausi­\nble explanation that the crosses were simply memorials.\n637 F. 3d, at 1105 (opinion of Kelly, J.). The panel also\nemphasized that the “massive size” of these crosses would\nheighten the reasonable observer’s fear of discrimination\nand proselytization, unlike the “more humble spirit of\nsmall roadside crosses.” 616 F. 3d, at 1161–1162. The\ndissenters, by contrast, insisted that the size of the crosses\nwas necessary to ensure that the reasonable observer\nwould “take notice of the display and absorb its message”\nof remembrance and to ensure that the crosses could\ncontain all of the secular facts necessary to assuage the\nreasonable observer’s fears. 637 F. 3d, at 1105–1106\n(opinion of Kelly, J.).\n   Finally, the members of the court disputed what the\nreasonable observer would know. The panel acknowledged\nthat the reasonable observer would recognize that the\ncrosses commemorated death, but he would see only that\nthe symbol “memorializes the death of a Christian.” 616\nF. 3d, at 1161. That the designers of the cross memorials\n16        UTAH HIGHWAY PATROL ASSN. v.

Id.,\nat 1163–1164. Conversely, the dissenters’ reasonable\nobserver would have known that the crosses were chosen\nby the fallen officer’s family and erected by a private group\nwithout design approval from the State, and that most\nUtahns do not revere the cross.8 637 F. 3d, at 1110 (opin­\nion of Gorsuch, J.); id., at 1105 (opinion of Kelly, J.).\n  To any truly “reasonable observer,” these lines of disa­\ngreement may seem arbitrary at best. But to be fair to the\nTenth Circuit, it is our Establishment Clause jurispru­\ndence that invites this type of erratic, selective analysis of\nthe constitutionality of religious imagery on government\nproperty. These cases thus illustrate why “[t]he outcome\nof constitutional cases ought to rest on firmer grounds\nthan the personal preferences of judges.” Van Orden, 545\nU.

See\nComplaint in American Atheists, Inc. v. Port Auth. of New York, No.\n108670–2011 (N. Y. Sup. Ct.); Notice of Removal in American Atheists,\nInc. v. Port Auth. of New York, No. 1:11–cv–06026 (SDNY).\n   10 That the petition of the Association presents the question whether\n\nthe cross memorials in this suit are government speech is no obstacle to\ncertiorari. The Court need not grant certiorari on that question, and\nthe state petitioners only ask this Court to resolve the viability and\napplication of the endorsement test.\n   11 Respondents argue that this suit would be a poor vehicle to explore\n\nthe contours of a coercion-based Establishment Clause test because the\nState has raised the specter of a preference for one religion over others.\nIn this regard, respondents point out that the State took the position\nbefore the lower courts that it would not be able to approve the Associa­\ntion’s memorials “ ‘in the same manner’ ” if the Association, as it indi­\ncated it would, allowed an officer’s family to request a symbol other\nthan a cross. Brief in Opposition 3–4, 31.\n   Because no such situation has ever arisen, and because the State has\nonly indicated it could not approve a different marker in the same\nmanner as the roadside crosses, respondents distort the record by\nclaiming that the State has put families to the choice of “a Latin cross\nor no roadside memorial at all.” Id., at 4. Moreover, it is undisputed\nthat the State’s position stemmed from its belief that “if [the Associa­\ntion] were to change the shape of the memorial to reflect the religious\nsymbol of the fallen trooper, rather than the shape of the cross, the\nmemorial would no longer be a secular shape recognized as a symbol of\ndeath.” App. to Brief in Opposition 9a–15a (emphasis added). That\nposition is entirely consistent with the Tenth Circuit’s conclusion that\nthe purposes of the State and Association in permitting and implement­\ning the memorial program were secular. In any event, that the State\nand Association, both defending the memorial program’s constitutional­\nity, took conflicting positions about whether it was impermissibly\nreligious to use only crosses, or impermissibly religious to use other\nsymbols reflective of the deceased’s religious preference, only highlights\nthe confusion surrounding the Establishment Clause’s requirements.\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

The fallen officer’s name, rank, and badge number\nare emblazoned across the full length of the horizontal\nbeam of each memorial. The vertical beam bears the\nsymbol of the Utah Highway Patrol, the year of the of­\nficer’s death, and a plaque displaying the officer’s picture,\nhis biographical information, and details of his death. To\ndate, the Association has erected 13 cross memorials.\n   The Association chose the cross because it believed that\ncrosses are used both generally in cemeteries to commem­\norate the dead and specifically by uniformed services to\nmemorialize those who died in the line of duty. The Asso­\nciation also believed that only the cross effectively and\nsimultaneously conveyed the messages of death, honor,\nremembrance, gratitude, sacrifice, and safety that the Asso­\nciation wished to communicate to the public. Surviving\nfamily members of the fallen officers approved each\nmemorial, and no family ever requested that the Associa­\ntion use a symbol other than the cross.\n   The private Association designed, funded, owns, and\nmaintains the memorials. To ensure that the memorials\nwould be visible to the public, safe to view, and near the\nspot of the officers’ deaths, the Association requested and\nreceived permission from the State of Utah to erect some\nof the memorials on roadside public rights-of-way, at rest\nareas, and on the lawn of the Utah Highway Patrol office.\nIn the permit, the State expressed that it “neither ap­\nproves or disapproves the memorial marker.” Brief in\nOpposition 3, n. 3 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Respondents, American Atheists, Inc., and some of its\n——————\n  1 These cases were decided on a motion for summary judgment.\n\nThese facts are undisputed.\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

The Association, a petitioner along with the state\nofficials in this Court, intervened to defend the memorials.\nThe District Court granted summary judgment in favor of\npetitioners.\n  A panel of the Tenth Circuit reversed. As an initial\nmatter, the panel noted that this Court remains “sharply\ndivided on the standard governing Establishment Clause\ncases.” American Atheists, Inc. v. Duncan, 616 F. 3d 1145,\n1156 (2010). The panel therefore looked to Circuit prece­\ndent to determine the applicable standard and then ap­\nplied the so-called “Lemon/endorsement test,” which asks\nwhether the challenged governmental practice has the\nactual purpose of endorsing religion or whether it has that\neffect from the perspective of a “reasonable observer.” Id.,\nat 1157; see County of Allegheny v.

The court concluded that, even though the\ncross memorials had a secular purpose, they would none­\ntheless “convey to a reasonable observer that the state of\nUtah is endorsing Christianity.” 616 F. 3d, at 1160.

Our jurisprudence provides no principled ba-\nsis by which a lower court could discern whether\nLemon/endorsement, or some other test, should apply in\nEstablishment Clause cases. Some of our cases have simply\nignored the Lemon or Lemon/endorsement formulations.\nSee, e.g., Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U. S. 639 (2002);\nGood News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98\n(2001); Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783 (1983). Other\ndecisions have indicated that the Lemon/endorsement test\nis useful, but not binding. Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S.\n668, 679 (1984) (despite Lemon’s usefulness, we are “un­\nwillin[g] to be confined to any single test or criterion in\n                      Cite as: 565 U.

S. 734, 741\n(1973) (Lemon provides “no more than helpful signposts”).\nMost recently, in Van Orden, 545 U. S. 677, a majority of\nthe Court declined to apply the Lemon/endorsement test in\nupholding a Ten Commandments monument located on\nthe grounds of a state capitol.2 Yet in another case decid­\ned the same day, McCreary County v. American Civil\nLiberties Union of Ky., 545 U. S. 844, 859–866 (2005), the\nCourt selected the Lemon/endorsement test with nary a\nword of explanation and then declared a display of the Ten\nCommandments in a courthouse to be unconstitutional.\nSee also Van Orden, supra, at 692 (SCALIA, J., concurring)\n(“I join the opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE because I think\nit accurately reflects our current Establishment Clause\njurisprudence—or at least the Establishment Clause\njurisprudence we currently apply some of the time”).\nThus, the Lemon/endorsement test continues to “stal[k]\nour Establishment Clause jurisprudence” like “some ghoul\nin a late-night horror movie that repeatedly sits up in its\ngrave and shuffles abroad, after being repeatedly killed\nand buried.” Lamb’s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union\nFree School Dist., 508 U. S. 384, 398 (1993) (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in judgment).\n   Since Van Orden and McCreary, lower courts have\nunderstandably expressed confusion.

Mercer Cty., 432 F. 3d 624, 636\n——————\n  2 In  Van Orden, a plurality determined that the nature of a govern­\nment display and our Nation’s historical traditions should control. 545\nU.

In a concurring opinion, JUSTICE BREYER consid­\nered the “basic purposes of the First Amendment’s Religion Clauses\nthemselves” rather than “a literal application of any particular test.”\nId., at 703–704 (opinion concurring in judgment); see also id., at 700\n(“[I]n [difficult borderline] cases, I see no test-related substitute for the\nexercise of legal judgment”).\n6           UTAH HIGHWAY PATROL ASSN. v.

In Myers\nv. Loudoun Cty.

But even assuming that courts could employ\nobservers of similar insight and eyesight, it is “unrealistic\nto expect different judges . . . to reach consistent answers\nas to what any beholder, the average beholder, or the\nultrareasonable beholder (as the case may be) would\nthink.” Pinette, supra, at 769, n. 3.\n                               IV\n  It comes as no surprise, then, that despite other cases\nholding that the combination of a Latin cross and a public\ninsignia on public property does not convey a message of\nreligious endorsement, see Murray, supra; Weinbaum,\nsupra, the Tenth Circuit held otherwise. And, of course,\nthe Tenth Circuit divided over what, exactly, a reasonable\nobserver would think about the Association’s memorial\ncross program.\n  First, the members of the court disagreed as to what a\nreasonable observer would see. According to the panel,\nbecause the observer would be “driving by one of the me­\nmorial crosses at 55-plus miles per hour,” he would not see\nthe fallen officer’s biographical information, but he would\nsee that the “cross conspicuously bears the imprimatur of\na state entity . . . and is found primarily on public land.”\n616 F. 3d, at 1160. According to the dissenters, on the\nother hand, if the traveling observer could see the police\ninsignia on the cross, he should also see the much larger\nname, rank, and badge number of the fallen officer embla­\nzoned above it. 637 F. 3d, at 1108–1109 (opinion of Gor­\nsuch, J.); id., at 1104 (opinion of Kelly, J.).

Id., at\n1109 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.).\n   Next, the members of the court disagreed about what a\nreasonable observer would feel. The panel worried that\nthe use of a Christian symbol to memorialize fallen officers\nwould cause the observer to think the Utah Highway\nPatrol and Christianity had “some connection,” leading\nhim to “fear that Christians are likely to receive preferen­\ntial treatment from the [patrol]—both in their hiring\npractices and, more generally, in the treatment that peo­\nple may expect to receive on Utah’s highways.” 616 F. 3d,\nat 1160. The dissenters’ reasonable observer, however,\nwould not take such a “paranoid,” “conspiratorial view of\nlife,” “conjur[ing] up fears of religious discrimination” by a\n“ ‘Christian police,’ ” especially in light of the more plausi­\nble explanation that the crosses were simply memorials.\n637 F. 3d, at 1105 (opinion of Kelly, J.). The panel also\nemphasized that the “massive size” of these crosses would\nheighten the reasonable observer’s fear of discrimination\nand proselytization, unlike the “more humble spirit of\nsmall roadside crosses.” 616 F. 3d, at 1161–1162. The\ndissenters, by contrast, insisted that the size of the crosses\nwas necessary to ensure that the reasonable observer\nwould “take notice of the display and absorb its message”\nof remembrance and to ensure that the crosses could\ncontain all of the secular facts necessary to assuage the\nreasonable observer’s fears. 637 F. 3d, at 1105–1106\n(opinion of Kelly, J.).\n   Finally, the members of the court disputed what the\nreasonable observer would know. The panel acknowledged\nthat the reasonable observer would recognize that the\ncrosses commemorated death, but he would see only that\nthe symbol “memorializes the death of a Christian.” 616\nF. 3d, at 1161.

Id.,\nat 1163–1164. Conversely, the dissenters’ reasonable\nobserver would have known that the crosses were chosen\nby the fallen officer’s family and erected by a private group\nwithout design approval from the State, and that most\nUtahns do not revere the cross.8 637 F. 3d, at 1110 (opin­\nion of Gorsuch, J.); id., at 1105 (opinion of Kelly, J.).\n  To any truly “reasonable observer,” these lines of disa­\ngreement may seem arbitrary at best. But to be fair to the\nTenth Circuit, it is our Establishment Clause jurispru­\ndence that invites this type of erratic, selective analysis of\nthe constitutionality of religious imagery on government\nproperty. These cases thus illustrate why “[t]he outcome\nof constitutional cases ought to rest on firmer grounds\nthan the personal preferences of judges.” Van Orden, 545\nU.

See\nComplaint in American Atheists, Inc. v. Port Auth. of New York, No.\n108670–2011 (N. Y. Sup. Ct.); Notice of Removal in American Atheists,\nInc. v. Port Auth. of New York, No. 1:11–cv–06026 (SDNY).\n   10 That the petition of the Association presents the question whether\n\nthe cross memorials in this suit are government speech is no obstacle to\ncertiorari. The Court need not grant certiorari on that question, and\nthe state petitioners only ask this Court to resolve the viability and\napplication of the endorsement test.\n   11 Respondents argue that this suit would be a poor vehicle to explore\n\nthe contours of a coercion-based Establishment Clause test because the\nState has raised the specter of a preference for one religion over others.\nIn this regard, respondents point out that the State took the position\nbefore the lower courts that it would not be able to approve the Associa­\ntion’s memorials “ ‘in the same manner’ ” if the Association, as it indi­\ncated it would, allowed an officer’s family to request a symbol other\nthan a cross. Brief in Opposition 3–4, 31.\n   Because no such situation has ever arisen, and because the State has\nonly indicated it could not approve a different marker in the same\nmanner as the roadside crosses, respondents distort the record by\nclaiming that the State has put families to the choice of “a Latin cross\nor no roadside memorial at all.” Id., at 4. Moreover, it is undisputed\nthat the State’s position stemmed from its belief that “if [the Associa­\ntion] were to change the shape of the memorial to reflect the religious\nsymbol of the fallen trooper, rather than the shape of the cross, the\nmemorial would no longer be a secular shape recognized as a symbol of\ndeath.” App. to Brief in Opposition 9a–15a (emphasis added). That\nposition is entirely consistent with the Tenth Circuit’s conclusion that\nthe purposes of the State and Association in permitting and implement­\ning the memorial program were secular. In any event, that the State\nand Association, both defending the memorial program’s constitutional­\nity, took conflicting positions about whether it was impermissibly\nreligious to use only crosses, or impermissibly religious to use other\nsymbols reflective of the deceased’s religious preference, only highlights\nthe confusion surrounding the Establishment Clause’s requirements.\n                 Cite as: 565 U.
