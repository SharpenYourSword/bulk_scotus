The Court of Appeals\nfor the Sixth Circuit purported to identify three such\ngrievous errors in the Ohio Supreme Court’s affirmance of\nrespondent Archie Dixon’s murder conviction. Because it\nis not clear that the Ohio Supreme Court erred at all,\nmuch less erred so transparently that no fairminded jurist\ncould agree with that court’s decision, the Sixth Circuit’s\njudgment must be reversed.\n                         *    *    *\n   Archie Dixon and Tim Hoffner murdered Chris Hammer\nin order to steal his car. Dixon and Hoffner beat Hammer,\ntied him up, and buried him alive, pushing the struggling\nHammer down into his grave while they shoveled dirt on\ntop of him. Dixon then used Hammer’s birth certificate\nand social security card to obtain a state identification\ncard in Hammer’s name. After using that identification\ncard to establish ownership of Hammer’s car, Dixon sold\nthe vehicle for $2,800.\n   Hammer’s mother reported her son missing the day\nafter his murder.

DIXON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\npearance, police had various encounters with Dixon, three\nof which are relevant here. On November 4, 1993, a police\ndetective spoke with Dixon at a local police station. It is\nundisputed that this was a chance encounter—Dixon was\napparently visiting the police station to retrieve his own\ncar, which had been impounded for a traffic violation. The\ndetective issued Miranda warnings to Dixon and then\nasked to talk to him about Hammer’s disappearance. See\nMiranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). Dixon declined\nto answer questions without his lawyer present and left\nthe station.\n   As their investigation continued, police determined that\nDixon had sold Hammer’s car and forged Hammer’s signa­\nture when cashing the check he received in that sale.\nPolice arrested Dixon for forgery on the morning of No­\nvember 9. Beginning at 11:30 a.m. detectives intermit­\ntently interrogated Dixon over several hours, speaking\nwith him for about 45 minutes total. Prior to the interro­\ngation, the detectives had decided not to provide Dixon\nwith Miranda warnings for fear that Dixon would again\nrefuse to speak with them.\n   Dixon readily admitted to obtaining the identification\ncard in Hammer’s name and signing Hammer’s name on\nthe check, but said that Hammer had given him permis­\nsion to sell the car. Dixon claimed not to know where\nHammer was, although he said he thought Hammer might\nhave left for Tennessee. The detectives challenged the\nplausibility of Dixon’s tale and told Dixon that Tim\nHoffner was providing them more useful information. At\none point a detective told Dixon that “now is the time to\nsay” whether he had any involvement in Hammer’s disap­\npearance because “if Tim starts cutting a deal over there,\nthis is kinda like, a bus leaving.

Dixon insisted that he had told police everything\nhe knew and that he had “[n]othing whatsoever” to do\nwith Hammer’s disappearance. Id., at 186a. At approxi­\nmately 3:30 p.m. the interrogation concluded, and the\ndetectives brought Dixon to a correctional facility where\nhe was booked on a forgery charge.\n  The same afternoon, Hoffner led police to Hammer’s\ngrave. Hoffner claimed that Dixon had told him that\nHammer was buried there. After concluding their inter­\nview with Hoffner and releasing him, the police had Dixon\ntransported back to the police station.\n  Dixon arrived at the police station at about 7:30 p.m.\nPrior to any police questioning, Dixon stated that he had\nheard the police had found a body and asked whether\nHoffner was in custody. The police told Dixon that\nHoffner was not, at which point Dixon said, “I talked to\nmy attorney, and I want to tell you what happened.” State\nv. Dixon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1716417\"><a href=\"/opinion/1716417/state-v-dixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 331, 2004–Ohio–1585, 805\nN. E. 2d 1042, 1050. The police read Dixon his Miranda\nrights, obtained a signed waiver of those rights, and spoke\nwith Dixon for about half an hour. At 8 p.m. the police,\nnow using a tape recorder, again advised Dixon of his\nMiranda rights. In a detailed confession, Dixon admitted\nto murdering Hammer but attempted to pin the lion’s\nshare of the blame on Hoffner.\n  At Dixon’s trial, the Ohio trial court excluded both\nDixon’s initial confession to forgery and his later confes­\nsion to murder. The State took an interlocutory appeal.\nThe State did not dispute that Dixon’s forgery confession\nwas properly suppressed, but argued that the murder\nconfession was admissible because Dixon had received\nMiranda warnings prior to that confession. The Ohio\nCourt of Appeals agreed and allowed Dixon’s murder\nconfession to be admitted as evidence. Dixon was convict­\ned of murder, kidnaping, robbery, and forgery, and sen­\ntenced to death.\n4                      BOBBY v. DIXON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n   The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed Dixon’s convictions\nand sentence. To analyze the admissibility of Dixon’s\nmurder confession, the court applied Oregon v. Elstad, 470\nU. S. 298 (1985). The Ohio Supreme Court found that\nDixon’s confession to murder after receiving Miranda\nwarnings was admissible because that confession and his\nprior, unwarned confession to forgery were both voluntary.\nState v. Dixon, supra, at 332–334, 805 N. E. 2d, at 1050–\n1052; see Elstad, supra, at 318 (“We hold today that a\nsuspect who has once responded to unwarned yet uncoer­\ncive questioning is not thereby disabled from waiving his\nrights and confessing after he has been given the requisite\nMiranda warnings”).\n   Dixon then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus\nunder 28 U. S. C. §2254 in the U. S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of Ohio. Dixon claimed, inter alia, that\nthe state court decisions allowing the admission of his\nmurder confession contravened clearly established federal\nlaw. The District Court denied relief, but a divided panel\nof the Sixth Circuit reversed. Dixon v. Houk, 627 F. 3d\n553 (2010).\n   The Sixth Circuit had authority to issue the writ of\nhabeas corpus only if the Ohio Supreme Court’s decision\n“was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application\nof, clearly established Federal law,” as set forth in this\nCourt’s holdings, or was “based on an unreasonable de­\ntermination of the facts” in light of the state court record.\n§2254(d); see Harrington, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\nThe Sixth Circuit believed that the Ohio Supreme Court’s\ndecision contained three such egregious errors.\n   First, according to the Sixth Circuit, the Miranda deci­\nsion itself clearly established that police could not speak to\nDixon on November 9, because on November 4 Dixon had\nrefused to speak to police without his lawyer. That is\nplainly wrong. It is undisputed that Dixon was not in\ncustody during his chance encounter with police on No­\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                   5\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nvember 4. And this Court has “never held that a person\ncan invoke his Miranda rights anticipatorily, in a context\nother than ‘custodial interrogation.’ ” McNeil v. Wisconsin,\n501 U. S. 171, 182, n. 3 (1991); see also Montejo v. Louisi-\nana, 556 U. S. 778, ___ (2009) (slip. op., at 16) (“If the\ndefendant is not in custody then [Miranda and its proge­\nny] do not apply”).\n  Second, the Sixth Circuit held that police violated the\nFifth Amendment by urging Dixon to “cut a deal” before\nhis accomplice Hoffner did so.1 The Sixth Circuit cited no\nprecedent of this Court—or any court—holding that this\ncommon police tactic is unconstitutional. Cf., e.g., Elstad,\nsupra, at 317 (“[T]he Court has refused to find that a\ndefendant who confesses, after being falsely told that his\ncodefendant has turned State’s evidence, does so involun­\ntarily”). Because no holding of this Court suggests, much\nless clearly establishes, that police may not urge a suspect\nto confess before another suspect does so, the Sixth Circuit\nhad no authority to issue the writ on this ground.2\n——————\n   1 In the Sixth Circuit’s view, the Ohio Supreme Court’s contrary con­\n\nclusion that Dixon’s confession was voluntary “was based on an unrea­\nsonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in\nthe State court proceeding.” §2254(d)(2). The Sixth Circuit did not,\nhowever, purport to identify any mistaken factual finding. It differed\nwith the Ohio Supreme Court only on the ultimate characterization of\nDixon’s confession as voluntary, and this Court’s cases make clear that\n“the ultimate issue of ‘voluntariness’ is a legal question.” Miller v.\nFenton, 474 U. S. 104, 110 (1985); see also Arizona v. Fulminante, 499\nU. S. 279, 287 (1991). This Court therefore addresses the question the\nSixth Circuit should have addressed: whether the Ohio Supreme\nCourt’s decision “was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable applica­\ntion of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\nCourt of the United States.” §2254(d)(1).\n   2 The only case the Sixth Circuit cited on this issue was Mincey v.\n\nArizona, 437 U. S. 385 (1978). Mincey involved the “virtually continu­\nous questioning of a seriously and painfully wounded man on the edge\nof consciousness” who was in a hospital’s intensive care unit and who\n6                          BOBBY v. DIXON\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\n   Third, the Sixth Circuit held that the Ohio Supreme\nCourt unreasonably applied this Court’s precedent in\nElstad. In that case, a suspect who had not received\nMiranda warnings confessed to burglary as police took\nhim into custody. Approximately an hour later, after he\nhad received Miranda warnings, the suspect again con­\nfessed to the same burglary. This Court held that the\nlater, warned confession was admissible because “there is\nno warrant for presuming coercive effect where the sus­\npect’s initial inculpatory statement, though technically\nin violation of Miranda, was voluntary. The relevant\ninquiry is whether, in fact, the second [warned] statement\nwas also voluntarily made.” 470 U. S., at 318 (footnote\nomitted).\n   As the Ohio Supreme Court’s opinion explained, the\ncircumstances surrounding Dixon’s interrogations demon­\nstrate that his statements were voluntary. During Dixon’s\nfirst interrogation, he received several breaks, was given\nwater and offered food, and was not abused or threatened.\nHe freely acknowledged that he had forged Hammer’s\nname, even stating that the police were “welcome” to that\ninformation, and he had no difficulty denying that he had\nanything to do with Hammer’s disappearance. State v.\nDixon, 101 Ohio St. 3d, at 331, 805 N. E. 2d, at 1049.\nPrior to his second interrogation, Dixon made an unsolic­\nited declaration that he had spoken with his attorney and\nwanted to tell the police what had happened to Hammer.\nThen, before giving his taped confession, Dixon twice\nreceived Miranda warnings and signed a waiver-of-rights\nform which stated that he was acting of his own free will.\n\n\n——————\n“clearly expressed his wish not to be interrogated” while in a “debilitat­\ned and helpless condition.” Id., at 399–401. There is simply nothing in\nthe facts or reasoning of Mincey suggesting that any of Dixon’s state­\nments were involuntary.\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                     7\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nThe Ohio Supreme Court recognized that Dixon’s first in-\nterrogation involved “an intentional Miranda violation.”\nThe court concluded, however, that “as in Elstad, the\nbreach of the Miranda procedures here involved no actual\ncompulsion” and thus there was no reason to suppress\nDixon’s later, warned confession. 101 Ohio St. 3d, at 334,\n805 N. E. 2d, at 1052 (citing Elstad, supra, at 318).\n  The Sixth Circuit disagreed, believing that Dixon’s\nconfession was inadmissible under Elstad because it was\nthe product of a “deliberate question-first, warn-later\nstrategy.” 627 F. 3d, at 557. In so holding, the Sixth\nCircuit relied heavily on this Court’s decision in Missouri\nv. Seibert, 542 U. S. 600 (2004).3 In Seibert, police em­\nployed a two-step strategy to reduce the effect of Miranda\nwarnings: A detective exhaustively questioned Seibert\nuntil she confessed to murder and then, after a 15- to 20­\nminute break, gave Seibert Miranda warnings and led her\nto repeat her prior confession. 542 U. S., at 604–606, 616\n(plurality opinion). The Court held that Seibert’s second\nconfession was inadmissible as evidence against her even\nthough it was preceded by a Miranda warning. A plurali­\nty of the Court reasoned that “[u]pon hearing warnings\nonly in the aftermath of interrogation and just after mak­\n\n——————\n   3 Seibert was not decided until after the Ohio Supreme Court’s opin­\n\nion in this case, but was issued before this Court denied Dixon’s peti­\ntion for certiorari seeking review of the Ohio Supreme Court’s decision.\nIt is thus an open question whether Seibert was “clearly established\nFederal law” for purposes of §2254(d). See Smith v. Spisak¸ 558 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 3). It is not necessary to decide that ques­\ntion here because Seibert is entirely consistent with the Ohio Supreme\nCourt’s decision. Thus, if Seibert was clearly established law, the Ohio\nSupreme Court’s decision was not “contrary to” or “an unreasonable\napplication of” Seibert. §2254(d). And if Seibert was not clearly estab­\nlished law, Seibert’s explication of Elstad further demonstrates that the\nOhio Supreme Court’s decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable\napplication of Elstad.\n8                      BOBBY v. DIXON\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ning a confession, a suspect would hardly think he had a\ngenuine right to remain silent, let alone persist in so\nbelieving once the police began to lead him over the same\nground again.” 542 U. S., at 613; see also id., at 615 (de­\ntailing a “series of relevant facts that bear on whether\nMiranda warnings delivered midstream could be effective\nenough to accomplish their object”). JUSTICE KENNEDY\nconcurred in the judgment, noting he “would apply a\nnarrower test applicable only in the infrequent case . . . in\nwhich the two-step interrogation technique was used in a\ncalculated way to undermine the Miranda warning.” Id.,\nat 622.\n   In this case, no two-step interrogation technique of the\ntype that concerned the Court in Seibert undermined the\nMiranda warnings Dixon received. In Seibert, the sus­\npect’s first, unwarned interrogation left “little, if anything,\nof incriminating potential left unsaid,” making it “unnatu­\nral” not to “repeat at the second stage what had been said\nbefore.” 542 U. S., at 616–617 (plurality opinion). But in\nthis case Dixon steadfastly maintained during his first,\nunwarned interrogation that he had “[n]othing whatso­\never” to do with Hammer’s disappearance. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 186a. Thus, unlike in Seibert, there is no concern\nhere that police gave Dixon Miranda warnings and then\nled him to repeat an earlier murder confession, because\nthere was no earlier confession to repeat. Indeed, Dixon\ncontradicted his prior unwarned statements when he\nconfessed to Hammer’s murder. Nor is there any evidence\nthat police used Dixon’s earlier admission to forgery to\ninduce him to waive his right to silence later: Dixon de­\nclared his desire to tell police what happened to Hammer\nbefore the second interrogation session even began. As the\nOhio Supreme Court reasonably concluded, there was\nsimply “no nexus” between Dixon’s unwarned admission to\nforgery and his later, warned confession to murder. 101\nOhio St. 3d, at 333, 805 N. E. 2d, at 1051.\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                    9\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\n   Moreover, in Seibert the Court was concerned that the\nMiranda warnings did not “effectively advise the suspect\nthat he had a real choice about giving an admissible\nstatement” because the unwarned and warned interroga­\ntions blended into one “continuum.” 542 U. S., at 612, 617.\nGiven all the circumstances of this case, that is not so\nhere. Four hours passed between Dixon’s unwarned inter­\nrogation and his receipt of Miranda rights, during which\ntime he traveled from the police station to a separate jail\nand back again; claimed to have spoken to his lawyer; and\nlearned that police were talking to his accomplice and\nhad found Hammer’s body. Things had changed. Under\nSeibert, this significant break in time and dramatic\nchange in circumstances created “a new and distinct expe­\nrience,” ensuring that Dixon’s prior, unwarned interroga­\ntion did not undermine the effectiveness of the Miranda\nwarnings he received before confessing to Hammer’s mur­\nder. 542 U. S., at 615; see also id., at 622 (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (“For example, a substantial\nbreak in time and circumstances between the prewarning\nstatement and the Miranda warning may suffice in most\ncircumstances, as it allows the accused to distinguish the\ntwo contexts and appreciate that the interrogation has\ntaken a new turn”).4\n   The admission of Dixon’s murder confession was con­\nsistent with this Court’s precedents: Dixon received Mi-\n\n\n——————\n   4 The Sixth Circuit also concluded that “the Ohio Supreme Court\n\nerroneously placed the burden of proof on Dixon to prove that his\nconfession was coerced.” Dixon v. Houk, 627 F. 3d 553, 558 (2010). But\nthe Ohio Supreme Court clearly said that “the state carries the burden\nof proving voluntariness.” State v. Dixon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1716417\"><a href=\"/opinion/1716417/state-v-dixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 332,\n2004–Ohio–1585, 805 N. E. 2d 1042, 1050. That the court’s opinion\ndiscusses the absence of evidence of coerciveness alongside the affirma­\ntive evidence of voluntariness in no way indicates that the court shifted\nthe burden onto Dixon.\n10                    BOBBY v. DIXON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nranda warnings before confessing to Hammer’s murder;\nthe effectiveness of those warnings was not impaired by\nthe sort of “two-step interrogation technique” condemned\nin Seibert; and there is no evidence that any of Dixon’s\nstatements was the product of actual coercion. That does\nnot excuse the detectives’ decision not to give Dixon Mi-\nranda warnings before his first interrogation. But the\nOhio courts recognized that failure and imposed the ap­\npropriate remedy: exclusion of Dixon’s forgery confession\nand the attendant statements given without the benefit of\nMiranda warnings. Because no precedent of this Court\nrequired Ohio to do more, the Sixth Circuit was without\nauthority to overturn the reasoned judgment of the State’s\nhighest court.\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s\nmotion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The\njudgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n</pre>", "id": 616807, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2011/11/07/Bobby_v._Dixon.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                 Cite as: 565 U.

At approxi­\nmately 3:30 p.m. the interrogation concluded, and the\ndetectives brought Dixon to a correctional facility where\nhe was booked on a forgery charge.\n  The same afternoon, Hoffner led police to Hammer’s\ngrave. Hoffner claimed that Dixon had told him that\nHammer was buried there. After concluding their inter­\nview with Hoffner and releasing him, the police had Dixon\ntransported back to the police station.\n  Dixon arrived at the police station at about 7:30 p.m.\nPrior to any police questioning, Dixon stated that he had\nheard the police had found a body and asked whether\nHoffner was in custody. The police told Dixon that\nHoffner was not, at which point Dixon said, “I talked to\nmy attorney, and I want to tell you what happened.” State\nv. Dixon, 101 Ohio St. 3d 328, 331, 2004–Ohio–1585, 805\nN. E. 2d 1042, 1050. The police read Dixon his Miranda\nrights, obtained a signed waiver of those rights, and spoke\nwith Dixon for about half an hour. At 8 p.m. the police,\nnow using a tape recorder, again advised Dixon of his\nMiranda rights. In a detailed confession, Dixon admitted\nto murdering Hammer but attempted to pin the lion’s\nshare of the blame on Hoffner.\n  At Dixon’s trial, the Ohio trial court excluded both\nDixon’s initial confession to forgery and his later confes­\nsion to murder. The State took an interlocutory appeal.\nThe State did not dispute that Dixon’s forgery confession\nwas properly suppressed, but argued that the murder\nconfession was admissible because Dixon had received\nMiranda warnings prior to that confession. The Ohio\nCourt of Appeals agreed and allowed Dixon’s murder\nconfession to be admitted as evidence. Dixon was convict­\ned of murder, kidnaping, robbery, and forgery, and sen­\ntenced to death.\n4                      BOBBY v. DIXON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n   The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed Dixon’s convictions\nand sentence. To analyze the admissibility of Dixon’s\nmurder confession, the court applied Oregon v. Elstad, 470\nU. S. 298 (1985). The Ohio Supreme Court found that\nDixon’s confession to murder after receiving Miranda\nwarnings was admissible because that confession and his\nprior, unwarned confession to forgery were both voluntary.\nState v. Dixon, supra, at 332–334, 805 N. E. 2d, at 1050–\n1052; see Elstad, supra, at 318 (“We hold today that a\nsuspect who has once responded to unwarned yet uncoer­\ncive questioning is not thereby disabled from waiving his\nrights and confessing after he has been given the requisite\nMiranda warnings”).\n   Dixon then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus\nunder 28 U. S. C. §2254 in the U. S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of Ohio. Dixon claimed, inter alia, that\nthe state court decisions allowing the admission of his\nmurder confession contravened clearly established federal\nlaw. The District Court denied relief, but a divided panel\nof the Sixth Circuit reversed. Dixon v. Houk, 627 F. 3d\n553 (2010).\n   The Sixth Circuit had authority to issue the writ of\nhabeas corpus only if the Ohio Supreme Court’s decision\n“was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application\nof, clearly established Federal law,” as set forth in this\nCourt’s holdings, or was “based on an unreasonable de­\ntermination of the facts” in light of the state court record.\n§2254(d); see Harrington, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\nThe Sixth Circuit believed that the Ohio Supreme Court’s\ndecision contained three such egregious errors.\n   First, according to the Sixth Circuit, the Miranda deci­\nsion itself clearly established that police could not speak to\nDixon on November 9, because on November 4 Dixon had\nrefused to speak to police without his lawyer. That is\nplainly wrong. It is undisputed that Dixon was not in\ncustody during his chance encounter with police on No­\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                   5\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nvember 4. And this Court has “never held that a person\ncan invoke his Miranda rights anticipatorily, in a context\nother than ‘custodial interrogation.’ ” McNeil v. Wisconsin,\n501 U. S. 171, 182, n. 3 (1991); see also Montejo v. Louisi-\nana, 556 U. S. 778, ___ (2009) (slip. op., at 16) (“If the\ndefendant is not in custody then [Miranda and its proge­\nny] do not apply”).\n  Second, the Sixth Circuit held that police violated the\nFifth Amendment by urging Dixon to “cut a deal” before\nhis accomplice Hoffner did so.1 The Sixth Circuit cited no\nprecedent of this Court—or any court—holding that this\ncommon police tactic is unconstitutional. Cf., e.g., Elstad,\nsupra, at 317 (“[T]he Court has refused to find that a\ndefendant who confesses, after being falsely told that his\ncodefendant has turned State’s evidence, does so involun­\ntarily”). Because no holding of this Court suggests, much\nless clearly establishes, that police may not urge a suspect\nto confess before another suspect does so, the Sixth Circuit\nhad no authority to issue the writ on this ground.2\n——————\n   1 In the Sixth Circuit’s view, the Ohio Supreme Court’s contrary con­\n\nclusion that Dixon’s confession was voluntary “was based on an unrea­\nsonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in\nthe State court proceeding.” §2254(d)(2). The Sixth Circuit did not,\nhowever, purport to identify any mistaken factual finding. It differed\nwith the Ohio Supreme Court only on the ultimate characterization of\nDixon’s confession as voluntary, and this Court’s cases make clear that\n“the ultimate issue of ‘voluntariness’ is a legal question.” Miller v.\nFenton, 474 U. S. 104, 110 (1985); see also Arizona v. Fulminante, 499\nU. S. 279, 287 (1991). This Court therefore addresses the question the\nSixth Circuit should have addressed: whether the Ohio Supreme\nCourt’s decision “was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable applica­\ntion of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\nCourt of the United States.” §2254(d)(1).\n   2 The only case the Sixth Circuit cited on this issue was Mincey v.\n\nArizona, 437 U. S. 385 (1978). Mincey involved the “virtually continu­\nous questioning of a seriously and painfully wounded man on the edge\nof consciousness” who was in a hospital’s intensive care unit and who\n6                          BOBBY v. DIXON\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\n   Third, the Sixth Circuit held that the Ohio Supreme\nCourt unreasonably applied this Court’s precedent in\nElstad. In that case, a suspect who had not received\nMiranda warnings confessed to burglary as police took\nhim into custody. Approximately an hour later, after he\nhad received Miranda warnings, the suspect again con­\nfessed to the same burglary. This Court held that the\nlater, warned confession was admissible because “there is\nno warrant for presuming coercive effect where the sus­\npect’s initial inculpatory statement, though technically\nin violation of Miranda, was voluntary. The relevant\ninquiry is whether, in fact, the second [warned] statement\nwas also voluntarily made.” 470 U. S., at 318 (footnote\nomitted).\n   As the Ohio Supreme Court’s opinion explained, the\ncircumstances surrounding Dixon’s interrogations demon­\nstrate that his statements were voluntary. During Dixon’s\nfirst interrogation, he received several breaks, was given\nwater and offered food, and was not abused or threatened.\nHe freely acknowledged that he had forged Hammer’s\nname, even stating that the police were “welcome” to that\ninformation, and he had no difficulty denying that he had\nanything to do with Hammer’s disappearance. State v.\nDixon, 101 Ohio St. 3d, at 331, 805 N. E. 2d, at 1049.\nPrior to his second interrogation, Dixon made an unsolic­\nited declaration that he had spoken with his attorney and\nwanted to tell the police what had happened to Hammer.\nThen, before giving his taped confession, Dixon twice\nreceived Miranda warnings and signed a waiver-of-rights\nform which stated that he was acting of his own free will.\n\n\n——————\n“clearly expressed his wish not to be interrogated” while in a “debilitat­\ned and helpless condition.” Id., at 399–401. There is simply nothing in\nthe facts or reasoning of Mincey suggesting that any of Dixon’s state­\nments were involuntary.\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                     7\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nThe Ohio Supreme Court recognized that Dixon’s first in-\nterrogation involved “an intentional Miranda violation.”\nThe court concluded, however, that “as in Elstad, the\nbreach of the Miranda procedures here involved no actual\ncompulsion” and thus there was no reason to suppress\nDixon’s later, warned confession. 101 Ohio St. 3d, at 334,\n805 N. E. 2d, at 1052 (citing Elstad, supra, at 318).\n  The Sixth Circuit disagreed, believing that Dixon’s\nconfession was inadmissible under Elstad because it was\nthe product of a “deliberate question-first, warn-later\nstrategy.” 627 F. 3d, at 557. In so holding, the Sixth\nCircuit relied heavily on this Court’s decision in Missouri\nv. Seibert, 542 U. S. 600 (2004).3 In Seibert, police em­\nployed a two-step strategy to reduce the effect of Miranda\nwarnings: A detective exhaustively questioned Seibert\nuntil she confessed to murder and then, after a 15- to 20­\nminute break, gave Seibert Miranda warnings and led her\nto repeat her prior confession. 542 U. S., at 604–606, 616\n(plurality opinion). The Court held that Seibert’s second\nconfession was inadmissible as evidence against her even\nthough it was preceded by a Miranda warning. A plurali­\nty of the Court reasoned that “[u]pon hearing warnings\nonly in the aftermath of interrogation and just after mak­\n\n——————\n   3 Seibert was not decided until after the Ohio Supreme Court’s opin­\n\nion in this case, but was issued before this Court denied Dixon’s peti­\ntion for certiorari seeking review of the Ohio Supreme Court’s decision.\nIt is thus an open question whether Seibert was “clearly established\nFederal law” for purposes of §2254(d). See Smith v. Spisak¸ 558 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 3). It is not necessary to decide that ques­\ntion here because Seibert is entirely consistent with the Ohio Supreme\nCourt’s decision. Thus, if Seibert was clearly established law, the Ohio\nSupreme Court’s decision was not “contrary to” or “an unreasonable\napplication of” Seibert. §2254(d). And if Seibert was not clearly estab­\nlished law, Seibert’s explication of Elstad further demonstrates that the\nOhio Supreme Court’s decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable\napplication of Elstad.\n8                      BOBBY v. DIXON\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ning a confession, a suspect would hardly think he had a\ngenuine right to remain silent, let alone persist in so\nbelieving once the police began to lead him over the same\nground again.” 542 U. S., at 613; see also id., at 615 (de­\ntailing a “series of relevant facts that bear on whether\nMiranda warnings delivered midstream could be effective\nenough to accomplish their object”). JUSTICE KENNEDY\nconcurred in the judgment, noting he “would apply a\nnarrower test applicable only in the infrequent case . . . in\nwhich the two-step interrogation technique was used in a\ncalculated way to undermine the Miranda warning.” Id.,\nat 622.\n   In this case, no two-step interrogation technique of the\ntype that concerned the Court in Seibert undermined the\nMiranda warnings Dixon received. In Seibert, the sus­\npect’s first, unwarned interrogation left “little, if anything,\nof incriminating potential left unsaid,” making it “unnatu­\nral” not to “repeat at the second stage what had been said\nbefore.” 542 U. S., at 616–617 (plurality opinion). But in\nthis case Dixon steadfastly maintained during his first,\nunwarned interrogation that he had “[n]othing whatso­\never” to do with Hammer’s disappearance. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 186a. Thus, unlike in Seibert, there is no concern\nhere that police gave Dixon Miranda warnings and then\nled him to repeat an earlier murder confession, because\nthere was no earlier confession to repeat. Indeed, Dixon\ncontradicted his prior unwarned statements when he\nconfessed to Hammer’s murder. Nor is there any evidence\nthat police used Dixon’s earlier admission to forgery to\ninduce him to waive his right to silence later: Dixon de­\nclared his desire to tell police what happened to Hammer\nbefore the second interrogation session even began. As the\nOhio Supreme Court reasonably concluded, there was\nsimply “no nexus” between Dixon’s unwarned admission to\nforgery and his later, warned confession to murder. 101\nOhio St. 3d, at 333, 805 N. E. 2d, at 1051.\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                    9\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\n   Moreover, in Seibert the Court was concerned that the\nMiranda warnings did not “effectively advise the suspect\nthat he had a real choice about giving an admissible\nstatement” because the unwarned and warned interroga­\ntions blended into one “continuum.” 542 U. S., at 612, 617.\nGiven all the circumstances of this case, that is not so\nhere. Four hours passed between Dixon’s unwarned inter­\nrogation and his receipt of Miranda rights, during which\ntime he traveled from the police station to a separate jail\nand back again; claimed to have spoken to his lawyer; and\nlearned that police were talking to his accomplice and\nhad found Hammer’s body. Things had changed. Under\nSeibert, this significant break in time and dramatic\nchange in circumstances created “a new and distinct expe­\nrience,” ensuring that Dixon’s prior, unwarned interroga­\ntion did not undermine the effectiveness of the Miranda\nwarnings he received before confessing to Hammer’s mur­\nder. 542 U. S., at 615; see also id., at 622 (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (“For example, a substantial\nbreak in time and circumstances between the prewarning\nstatement and the Miranda warning may suffice in most\ncircumstances, as it allows the accused to distinguish the\ntwo contexts and appreciate that the interrogation has\ntaken a new turn”).4\n   The admission of Dixon’s murder confession was con­\nsistent with this Court’s precedents: Dixon received Mi-\n\n\n——————\n   4 The Sixth Circuit also concluded that “the Ohio Supreme Court\n\nerroneously placed the burden of proof on Dixon to prove that his\nconfession was coerced.” Dixon v. Houk, 627 F. 3d 553, 558 (2010). But\nthe Ohio Supreme Court clearly said that “the state carries the burden\nof proving voluntariness.” State v. Dixon, 101 Ohio St. 3d 328, 332,\n2004–Ohio–1585, 805 N. E. 2d 1042, 1050. That the court’s opinion\ndiscusses the absence of evidence of coerciveness alongside the affirma­\ntive evidence of voluntariness in no way indicates that the court shifted\nthe burden onto Dixon.\n10                    BOBBY v. DIXON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nranda warnings before confessing to Hammer’s murder;\nthe effectiveness of those warnings was not impaired by\nthe sort of “two-step interrogation technique” condemned\nin Seibert; and there is no evidence that any of Dixon’s\nstatements was the product of actual coercion. That does\nnot excuse the detectives’ decision not to give Dixon Mi-\nranda warnings before his first interrogation. But the\nOhio courts recognized that failure and imposed the ap­\npropriate remedy: exclusion of Dixon’s forgery confession\nand the attendant statements given without the benefit of\nMiranda warnings. Because no precedent of this Court\nrequired Ohio to do more, the Sixth Circuit was without\nauthority to overturn the reasoned judgment of the State’s\nhighest court.\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s\nmotion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The\njudgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/616807/", "sha1": "3a4547bf94579cd6439b47ea3b82333da0325458", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2011-11-07T07:23:10"}
