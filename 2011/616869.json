S. C. §2254(d)(1). We consider whether “clearly estab-\nlished Federal law” includes decisions of this Court that\nare announced after the last adjudication of the merits in\nstate court but before the defendant’s conviction becomes\nfinal.\n                             I\n  In December 1993, petitioner Eric Greene and four\nco-conspirators robbed a grocery store in North Philadel-\nphia, Pennsylvania. During the robbery, one of the men\nshot and killed the store’s owner. The five were appre-\n2                    GREENE v. FISHER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhended, and two of them confessed to taking part in the\nrobbery. Greene did not confess, but he was implicated by\nthe others’ statements.\n  When the Commonwealth sought to try all of the co-\nconspirators jointly, Greene sought severance, arguing,\ninter alia, that the confessions of his nontestifying code-\nfendants should not be introduced at his trial. The trial\ncourt denied the motion to sever, but agreed to require\nredaction of the confessions to eliminate proper names. As\nredacted, the confessions replaced names with words like\n“this guy,” “someone,” and “other guys,” or with the word\n“blank,” or simply omitted the names without substitution.\n  A jury convicted Greene of second-degree murder, rob-\nbery, and conspiracy. He appealed to the Pennsylvania\nSuperior Court, arguing that severance of his trial was\ndemanded by the rule announced in Bruton v. United\nStates, 391 U. S. 123 (1968), that the Confrontation Clause\nforbids the prosecution to introduce a nontestifying co-\ndefendant’s confession implicating the defendant in the\ncrime. The Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed the\nconviction, holding that the redaction had cured any prob-\nlem under Bruton.\n  Greene filed a petition for allowance of appeal to the\nPennsylvania Supreme Court, raising the same Bruton\nclaim. While that petition was pending, we held in Gray v.\nMaryland, 523 U. S. 185, 195 (1998), that “considered as a\nclass, redactions that replace a proper name with an\nobvious blank, the word ‘delete,’ a symbol, or similarly\nnotify the jury that a name has been deleted are similar\nenough to Bruton’s unredacted confessions as to warrant\nthe same legal results.” The Pennsylvania Supreme Court\ngranted the petition for allowance of appeal, limited to the\nquestion whether admission of the redacted confessions\nviolated Greene’s Sixth Amendment rights. After the\nparties filed merits briefs, however, the Pennsylvania\nSupreme Court dismissed the appeal as improvidently\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngranted.\n   Greene then filed a federal habeas corpus petition in the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of\nPennsylvania, alleging, inter alia, that the introduction\nof his nontestifying codefendants’ statements violated the\nConfrontation Clause. Adopting the report and recom-\nmendation of a Magistrate Judge, the District Court de-\nnied the petition. It concluded that since our decision in\nGray was not “clearly established Federal law” when the\nPennsylvania Superior Court adjudicated Greene’s Con-\nfrontation Clause claim, that court’s decision was not\n“contrary to,” or “an unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished Federal law.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1).\n   A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Third Circuit affirmed. Greene v. Palakovich, 606\nF. 3d 85 (2010). The majority held that the “clearly estab-\nlished Federal law” referred to in §2254(d)(1) is the law at\nthe time of the state-court adjudication on the merits. Id.,\nat 99. The dissenting judge contended that it is the law at\nthe time the conviction becomes final. Id., at 108. We\ngranted certiorari. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                          II\n Section 2254(d) of Title 28, U. S. C., as amended by\nAEDPA, provides:\n       “An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf\n    of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a\n    State court shall not be granted with respect to any\n    claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State\n    court proceedings unless the adjudication of the\n    claim—\n       “(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n    involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab-\n    lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n    Court of the United States; or\n       “(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an un-\n4                     GREENE v. FISHER\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n    reasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n    evidence presented in the State court proceeding.”\nThe issue here pertains to the first exception. We have\nsaid that its standard of “contrary to, or involv[ing] an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\nlaw” is “difficult to meet,” because the purpose of AEDPA\nis to ensure that federal habeas relief functions as a\n“ ‘guard against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal\njustice systems,’ ” and not as a means of error correction.\nHarrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n12–13) (quoting Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 332,\nn. 5 (1979) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment)).\n    In light of that objective, and relying upon the text of\nthe provision, we held last Term, in Cullen v. Pinholster,\n563 U. S. ___ (2011), that review under §2254(d)(1) is\nlimited to the record that was before the state court that\nadjudicated the prisoner’s claim on the merits. We said\nthat the provision’s “backward-looking language requires\nan examination of the state-court decision at the time it\nwas made.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9). The reasoning of\nCullen determines the result here. As we explained,\n§2254(d)(1) requires federal courts to “focu[s] on what a\nstate court knew and did,” and to measure state-court\ndecisions “against this Court’s precedents as of ‘the time\nthe state court renders its decision.’ ” Id., at __ (slip op., at\n10) (quoting Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 71–72\n(2003); emphasis added).\n    Greene resists that conclusion by appealing to our deci-\nsion in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989). Teague held\nthat, with two exceptions not pertinent here, a prisoner\nseeking federal habeas relief may rely on new constitu-\ntional rules of criminal procedure announced before the\nprisoner’s conviction became final. Id., at 310 (plurality\nopinion); see also Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 313\n(1989) (affirming and applying Teague rule). Finality\n                    Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\noccurs when direct state appeals have been exhausted and\na petition for writ of certiorari from this Court has become\ntime barred or has been disposed of. Griffith v. Kentucky,\n479 U. S. 314, 321, n. 6 (1987). Greene contends that,\nbecause finality marks the temporal cutoff for Teague\npurposes, it must mark the temporal cutoff for “clearly\nestablished Federal law” under AEDPA.\n   The analogy has been rejected by our cases. We have\nexplained that AEDPA did not codify Teague, and that\n“the AEDPA and Teague inquiries are distinct.” Horn v.\nBanks, 536 U. S. 266, 272 (2002) (per curiam). The retro-\nactivity rules that govern federal habeas review on the\nmerits—which include Teague—are quite separate from\nthe relitigation bar imposed by AEDPA; neither abrogates\nor qualifies the other. If §2254(d)(1) was, indeed, pegged\nto Teague, it would authorize relief when a state-court\nmerits adjudication “resulted in a decision that became\ncontrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished Federal law, before the conviction became\nfinal.” The statute says no such thing, and we see no\nreason why Teague should alter AEDPA’s plain meaning.*\n   Greene alternatively contends that the relevant “deci-\nsion” to which the “clearly established Federal law” crite-\nrion must be applied is the decision of the state supreme\ncourt that disposes of a direct appeal from a defendant’s\nconviction or sentence, even when (as here) that decision\ndoes not adjudicate the relevant claim on the merits. This\nis an implausible reading of §2254(d)(1). The text, we\nrepeat, provides that habeas relief\n\n——————\n  * Whether §2254(d)(1) would bar a federal habeas petitioner from\nrelying on a decision that came after the last state-court adjudication\non the merits, but fell within one of the exceptions recognized in\nTeague, 489 U. S., at 311, is a question we need not address to resolve\nthis case.\n6                   GREENE v. FISHER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    “shall not be granted with respect to any claim that\n    was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceed-\n    ings unless the adjudication of the claim . . . resulted\n    in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an un-\n    reasonable application of, clearly established Federal\n    law . . . .” (Emphasis added.)\nThe words “the adjudication” in the “unless” clause obvi-\nously refer back to the “adjudicat[ion] on the merits,” and\nthe phrase “resulted in a decision” in the “unless” clause\nobviously refers to the decision produced by that same\nadjudication on the merits. A later affirmance of that\ndecision on alternative procedural grounds, for example,\nwould not be a decision resulting from the merits adjudica-\ntion. And much less would be (what is at issue here)\na decision by the state supreme court not to hear the\nappeal—that is, not to decide at all.\n                             III\n   The Third Circuit held, and the parties do not dispute,\nthat the last state-court adjudication on the merits of\nGreene’s Confrontation Clause claim occurred on direct\nappeal to the Pennsylvania Superior Court. 606 F. 3d, at\n92, and n. 1. The Pennsylvania Superior Court’s decision\npredated our decision in Gray by nearly three months.\nThe Third Circuit thus correctly held that Gray was not\n“clearly established Federal law” against which it could\nmeasure the Pennsylvania Superior Court’s decision. 606\nF. 3d, at 99. The panel then concluded (and the parties do\nnot dispute) that the Pennsylvania Superior Court’s deci-\nsion neither was “contrary to,” nor “involved an unreason-\nable application of,” any “clearly established Federal law”\nthat existed at the time. Id., at 106. Consequently,\n§2254(d)(1) bars the federal courts from granting Greene’s\napplication for a writ of habeas corpus.\n   We must observe that Greene’s predicament is an unu-\nsual one of his own creation.

Chater, 516\nU. S. 163, 167 (1996) (per curiam). See, e.g., Stanbridge v.\nNew York, 395 U. S. 709 (1969) (per curiam) (GVR in light\nof Bruton). Nor did Greene assert his Gray claim in a\npetition for state postconviction relief. Having forgone two\nobvious means of asserting his claim, Greene asks us to\nprovide him relief by interpreting AEDPA in a manner\ncontrary to both its text and our precedents. We decline to\ndo so, and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n</pre>", "id": 616869, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2011/11/08/Greene_v._Fisher.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2011                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

We consider whether “clearly estab-\nlished Federal law” includes decisions of this Court that\nare announced after the last adjudication of the merits in\nstate court but before the defendant’s conviction becomes\nfinal.\n                             I\n  In December 1993, petitioner Eric Greene and four\nco-conspirators robbed a grocery store in North Philadel-\nphia, Pennsylvania. During the robbery, one of the men\nshot and killed the store’s owner. The five were appre-\n2                    GREENE v. FISHER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhended, and two of them confessed to taking part in the\nrobbery. Greene did not confess, but he was implicated by\nthe others’ statements.\n  When the Commonwealth sought to try all of the co-\nconspirators jointly, Greene sought severance, arguing,\ninter alia, that the confessions of his nontestifying code-\nfendants should not be introduced at his trial. The trial\ncourt denied the motion to sever, but agreed to require\nredaction of the confessions to eliminate proper names. As\nredacted, the confessions replaced names with words like\n“this guy,” “someone,” and “other guys,” or with the word\n“blank,” or simply omitted the names without substitution.\n  A jury convicted Greene of second-degree murder, rob-\nbery, and conspiracy. He appealed to the Pennsylvania\nSuperior Court, arguing that severance of his trial was\ndemanded by the rule announced in Bruton v. United\nStates, 391 U. S. 123 (1968), that the Confrontation Clause\nforbids the prosecution to introduce a nontestifying co-\ndefendant’s confession implicating the defendant in the\ncrime. The Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed the\nconviction, holding that the redaction had cured any prob-\nlem under Bruton.\n  Greene filed a petition for allowance of appeal to the\nPennsylvania Supreme Court, raising the same Bruton\nclaim. While that petition was pending, we held in Gray v.\nMaryland, 523 U. S. 185, 195 (1998), that “considered as a\nclass, redactions that replace a proper name with an\nobvious blank, the word ‘delete,’ a symbol, or similarly\nnotify the jury that a name has been deleted are similar\nenough to Bruton’s unredacted confessions as to warrant\nthe same legal results.” The Pennsylvania Supreme Court\ngranted the petition for allowance of appeal, limited to the\nquestion whether admission of the redacted confessions\nviolated Greene’s Sixth Amendment rights. After the\nparties filed merits briefs, however, the Pennsylvania\nSupreme Court dismissed the appeal as improvidently\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngranted.\n   Greene then filed a federal habeas corpus petition in the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of\nPennsylvania, alleging, inter alia, that the introduction\nof his nontestifying codefendants’ statements violated the\nConfrontation Clause. Adopting the report and recom-\nmendation of a Magistrate Judge, the District Court de-\nnied the petition. It concluded that since our decision in\nGray was not “clearly established Federal law” when the\nPennsylvania Superior Court adjudicated Greene’s Con-\nfrontation Clause claim, that court’s decision was not\n“contrary to,” or “an unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished Federal law.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1).\n   A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Third Circuit affirmed. Greene v. Palakovich, 606\nF. 3d 85 (2010). The majority held that the “clearly estab-\nlished Federal law” referred to in §2254(d)(1) is the law at\nthe time of the state-court adjudication on the merits. Id.,\nat 99. The dissenting judge contended that it is the law at\nthe time the conviction becomes final. Id., at 108. We\ngranted certiorari. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                          II\n Section 2254(d) of Title 28, U. S. C., as amended by\nAEDPA, provides:\n       “An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf\n    of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a\n    State court shall not be granted with respect to any\n    claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State\n    court proceedings unless the adjudication of the\n    claim—\n       “(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n    involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab-\n    lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n    Court of the United States; or\n       “(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an un-\n4                     GREENE v. FISHER\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n    reasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n    evidence presented in the State court proceeding.”\nThe issue here pertains to the first exception. We have\nsaid that its standard of “contrary to, or involv[ing] an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\nlaw” is “difficult to meet,” because the purpose of AEDPA\nis to ensure that federal habeas relief functions as a\n“ ‘guard against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal\njustice systems,’ ” and not as a means of error correction.\nHarrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n12–13) (quoting Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 332,\nn. 5 (1979) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment)).\n    In light of that objective, and relying upon the text of\nthe provision, we held last Term, in Cullen v. Pinholster,\n563 U. S. ___ (2011), that review under §2254(d)(1) is\nlimited to the record that was before the state court that\nadjudicated the prisoner’s claim on the merits. We said\nthat the provision’s “backward-looking language requires\nan examination of the state-court decision at the time it\nwas made.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9). The reasoning of\nCullen determines the result here. As we explained,\n§2254(d)(1) requires federal courts to “focu[s] on what a\nstate court knew and did,” and to measure state-court\ndecisions “against this Court’s precedents as of ‘the time\nthe state court renders its decision.’ ” Id., at __ (slip op., at\n10) (quoting Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 71–72\n(2003); emphasis added).\n    Greene resists that conclusion by appealing to our deci-\nsion in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989). Teague held\nthat, with two exceptions not pertinent here, a prisoner\nseeking federal habeas relief may rely on new constitu-\ntional rules of criminal procedure announced before the\nprisoner’s conviction became final. Id., at 310 (plurality\nopinion); see also Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 313\n(1989) (affirming and applying Teague rule). Finality\n                    Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\noccurs when direct state appeals have been exhausted and\na petition for writ of certiorari from this Court has become\ntime barred or has been disposed of. Griffith v. Kentucky,\n479 U. S. 314, 321, n. 6 (1987). Greene contends that,\nbecause finality marks the temporal cutoff for Teague\npurposes, it must mark the temporal cutoff for “clearly\nestablished Federal law” under AEDPA.\n   The analogy has been rejected by our cases. We have\nexplained that AEDPA did not codify Teague, and that\n“the AEDPA and Teague inquiries are distinct.” Horn v.\nBanks, 536 U. S. 266, 272 (2002) (per curiam). The retro-\nactivity rules that govern federal habeas review on the\nmerits—which include Teague—are quite separate from\nthe relitigation bar imposed by AEDPA; neither abrogates\nor qualifies the other. If §2254(d)(1) was, indeed, pegged\nto Teague, it would authorize relief when a state-court\nmerits adjudication “resulted in a decision that became\ncontrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished Federal law, before the conviction became\nfinal.” The statute says no such thing, and we see no\nreason why Teague should alter AEDPA’s plain meaning.*\n   Greene alternatively contends that the relevant “deci-\nsion” to which the “clearly established Federal law” crite-\nrion must be applied is the decision of the state supreme\ncourt that disposes of a direct appeal from a defendant’s\nconviction or sentence, even when (as here) that decision\ndoes not adjudicate the relevant claim on the merits. This\nis an implausible reading of §2254(d)(1). The text, we\nrepeat, provides that habeas relief\n\n——————\n  * Whether §2254(d)(1) would bar a federal habeas petitioner from\nrelying on a decision that came after the last state-court adjudication\non the merits, but fell within one of the exceptions recognized in\nTeague, 489 U. S., at 311, is a question we need not address to resolve\nthis case.\n6                   GREENE v. FISHER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    “shall not be granted with respect to any claim that\n    was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceed-\n    ings unless the adjudication of the claim . . . resulted\n    in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an un-\n    reasonable application of, clearly established Federal\n    law . . . .” (Emphasis added.)\nThe words “the adjudication” in the “unless” clause obvi-\nously refer back to the “adjudicat[ion] on the merits,” and\nthe phrase “resulted in a decision” in the “unless” clause\nobviously refers to the decision produced by that same\nadjudication on the merits. A later affirmance of that\ndecision on alternative procedural grounds, for example,\nwould not be a decision resulting from the merits adjudica-\ntion. And much less would be (what is at issue here)\na decision by the state supreme court not to hear the\nappeal—that is, not to decide at all.\n                             III\n   The Third Circuit held, and the parties do not dispute,\nthat the last state-court adjudication on the merits of\nGreene’s Confrontation Clause claim occurred on direct\nappeal to the Pennsylvania Superior Court. 606 F. 3d, at\n92, and n. 1. The Pennsylvania Superior Court’s decision\npredated our decision in Gray by nearly three months.\nThe Third Circuit thus correctly held that Gray was not\n“clearly established Federal law” against which it could\nmeasure the Pennsylvania Superior Court’s decision. 606\nF. 3d, at 99. The panel then concluded (and the parties do\nnot dispute) that the Pennsylvania Superior Court’s deci-\nsion neither was “contrary to,” nor “involved an unreason-\nable application of,” any “clearly established Federal law”\nthat existed at the time. Id., at 106. Consequently,\n§2254(d)(1) bars the federal courts from granting Greene’s\napplication for a writ of habeas corpus.\n   We must observe that Greene’s predicament is an unu-\nsual one of his own creation.

S. ____ (2011)                  7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhabeas, he missed two opportunities to obtain relief under\nGray: After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed\nhis appeal, he did not file a petition for writ of certiorari\nfrom this Court, which would almost certainly have pro-\nduced a remand in light of the intervening Gray decision.\n“Where intervening developments . . . reveal a reasonable\nprobability that the decision below rests upon a premise\nthat the lower court would reject if given the opportunity\nfor further consideration, and where it appears that such a\nredetermination may determine the ultimate outcome of\nthe litigation, [an order granting the petition, vacating the\njudgment below, and remanding the case (GVR)] is, we\nbelieve, potentially appropriate.” Lawrence v. Chater, 516\nU. S. 163, 167 (1996) (per curiam). See, e.g., Stanbridge v.\nNew York, 395 U. S. 709 (1969) (per curiam) (GVR in light\nof Bruton). Nor did Greene assert his Gray claim in a\npetition for state postconviction relief. Having forgone two\nobvious means of asserting his claim, Greene asks us to\nprovide him relief by interpreting AEDPA in a manner\ncontrary to both its text and our precedents. We decline to\ndo so, and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/616869/", "sha1": "b0f0cac51668e68a94cf08c926683c2e59a16eaa", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2011-11-08T07:28:26"}
