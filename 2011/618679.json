Decided December 12, 2011\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. §2254, “imposes a highly def-\nerential standard for evaluating state-court rulings and\ndemands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of\nthe doubt.” Felkner v. Jackson, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(per curiam) (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In this case, the Court of Appeals departed\nfrom this standard, and we therefore grant certiorari and\nreverse.\n   Irving Cross was tried for kidnaping and sexually as-\nsaulting A. S. at knifepoint. Cross claimed that A. S. had\nconsented to sex in exchange for money and drugs. De-\nspite her avowed fear of taking the stand, A. S. testified as\nthe State’s primary witness at Cross’ trial in November\n1999 and was cross-examined by Cross’ attorney. Accord-\ning to the trial judge, A. S.’s testimony was halting. The\njury found Cross not guilty of kidnaping but was unable to\nreach a verdict on the sexual assault charges, and the trial\njudge declared a mistrial. The State decided to retry\nCross on those counts, and the retrial was scheduled for\nMarch 29, 2000.\n   On March 20, 2000, the prosecutor informed the trial\njudge that A. S. could not be located. A week later, on\nMarch 28, the State moved to have A. S. declared unavail-\nable and to introduce her prior testimony at the second\ntrial.\n   The State represented that A. S. had said after the first\ntrial that she was willing to testify at the retrial. The\n2                         HARDY v. CROSS\n\n                              Per Curiam\n\nState said that it had remained in “constant contact” with\nA. S. and her mother and that “[e]very indication” had\nbeen that A. S., “though extremely frightened, would be\nwilling to again come to court and testify.” Record, Exh. J,\np. 111 (hereinafter Exh. J). On March 3, however, A. S.’s\nmother and brother told the State’s investigator that they\ndid not know where she was, and A. S.’s mother reported\nthat A. S. was “very fearful and very concerned” about\ntestifying again. Record, Exh. K, p. E–9 (hereinafter Exh.\nK); id., at E–14. On March 9 or 10, the investigator inter-\nviewed A. S.’s father, who also had “no idea where [A. S.]\nwas.” Id., at E–12. The father’s only suggestion was to\nrefer the investigator back to the mother.\n  On March 10, the State learned from A. S.’s mother that\nA. S. had run away from home the day before and had not\nreturned.* Exh. J, at 111. Thereafter, “efforts began by\nmembers of the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office and\nby law enforcement personnel to locate” A. S. Id., at 112.\nThe State averred that its efforts included the following:\n     “Constant personal visits to the home of [A. S.] and\n     her mother, at all hours of the day and night. This\n     is where the victim has lived since the sexual assault\n     occurred.\n     “Personal visits to the home of [A. S.’s] father. This\n     is where the victim lived when the sexual assault\n     occurred.\n     “Personal conversations, in English and in Spanish,\n     with the victim’s mother, father, and other family\n     members.\n——————\n  * The State’s motion does not mention the investigator’s March 3 visit\nwith A. S.’s mother and brother, and the record in this case does not\nmake entirely clear when A. S. disappeared and when the State’s\nattorney actually became aware of this fact.

See Exh. K, at E–14 to E–17, E–21;\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 18a. The State’s investigator was\nassisted in the search by a police detective and a victim’s\nadvocate. The detective visited A. S.’s father’s home once\nand went to A. S.’s mother’s home—A. S.’s last-known\nresidence—on numerous occasions, approximately once\nevery three days, at different hours of the day and night.\nExh. K, at E27 to E29, E35. On one visit, A. S.’s moth-\ner told the victim’s advocate that A. S. could be staying\nwith an ex-boyfriend in Waukegan, Illinois, 40 miles away.\nId., at E42 to E43. The police detective visited the\nWaukegan address but was informed by the ex-boyfriend’s\nmother that she had not seen A. S. in several months and\nthat A. S. was not staying with her or her son. Id., at\nE33 to E34. The efforts to find A. S. continued until\nMarch 28, the day of the hearing on the State’s motion.\nId., at E30.\n4                     HARDY v. CROSS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n   On a final visit to A. S.’s mother on the morning of\nMarch 28, the mother informed the police detective that\nA. S. had called approximately two weeks earlier and had\nsaid that she did not want to testify and would not return\nto Chicago. See id., at E–30; 632 F. 3d 356, 359 (CA7\n2011). A. S.’s mother told the detective that she still did\nnot know where A. S. was or how to contact her. Exh. K,\nat E30.\n   The trial court granted the State’s motion and admitted\nA. S.’s earlier testimony. The trial court concluded that\nthe State had “expended efforts that go way beyond due\ndiligence,” id., at E–65, and that A. S. “ha[d] made it\nimpossible for anybody to find where she is . . . in spite of\nwhat I think are superhuman efforts to locate [her],” id.,\nat E–67. At Cross’ retrial, a legal intern from the State’s\nattorney’s office read A. S.’s prior, cross-examined testi-\nmony to the jury. According to the opinion below, the\nclerk’s reading of the prior testimony did not include the\nlong pauses that occurred at the first trial, and the clerk\nread the transcript with a slight inflection. See 632 F. 3d,\nat 359. The jury acquitted Cross of aggravated sexual\nassault but found him guilty of two counts of criminal\nsexual assault.\n   On appeal, the Illinois Court of Appeals agreed that\nA. S. was unavailable because “[i]t is clear from her tele-\nphone conversation with her mother that she was not in\nthe city” and “also evident that she was in hiding and did\nnot want to be located.” Id., at 83a. The court found that\nthe State had conducted a good-faith, diligent search to\nlocate A. S., and that the trial court had properly allowed\nthe introduction of A. S.’s cross-examined testimony from\nthe first trial. The court, therefore, affirmed Cross’ convic-\ntions and sentence. The Supreme Court of Illinois denied\nCross’ petition for leave to appeal, and we denied Cross’\npetition for a writ of certiorari.\n   Cross then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)             5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nunder 28 U. S. C. §2254 in the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of Illinois. Cross argued,\namong other things, that the state court had unreason-\nably applied clearly established Supreme Court prece-\ndents holding that the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth\nAmendment precludes the admission of the prior testimo-\nny of an allegedly unavailable witness unless the prosecu-\ntion made a good-faith effort to obtain the declarant’s\npresence at trial. The District Court denied Cross’ peti-\ntion, but the Seventh Circuit reversed. According to the\nSeventh Circuit, the Illinois Court of Appeals was unrea-\nsonable in holding that the State had made a sufficient\neffort to secure A. S.’s presence at the retrial. The Sev-\nenth Circuit stressed the importance of A. S.’s testimony\nand the manner of her testimony at the first trial.\n   In Barber v. Page, 390 U. S. 719 (1968), we held that “a\nwitness is not ‘unavailable’ for purposes of the . . . confron-\ntation requirement unless the prosecutorial authorities\nhave made a good-faith effort to obtain his presence at\ntrial.” Id., at 724–725. In Barber, we held that a witness\nhad not been unavailable for Confrontation Clause pur-\nposes because the State, which could have brought the\nwitness to court by seeking a writ of habeas corpus ad\ntestificandum, had “made absolutely no effort to obtain\n[his] presence . . . at trial” apart from determining that he\nwas serving a sentence in a federal prison. Id., at 723; see\nalso id., at 725.\n   We again addressed the question of witness unavailabil-\nity in Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980). In that case,\nwe held, the State had discharged its “duty of good-faith\neffort.” Id., at 75. We noted that the prosecutor had\nspoken to the witness’ mother, who reported that she had\nno knowledge of her daughter’s whereabouts and “knew of\nno way to reach [her] even in an emergency.” Ibid. We\nalso noted that the State had served five subpoenas in the\nwitness’ name to her parents’ residence over a 4-month\n6                      HARDY v. CROSS\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nperiod prior to the trial. “ ‘The lengths to which the prose-\ncution must go to produce a witness,’ ” the Court made\nclear, “ ‘is a question of reasonableness.’ ” Id., at 74 (quot-\ning California v. Green, 399 U. S. 149, 189, n. 22 (1970)\n(Harlan, J., concurring)). We acknowledged that there\nwere some additional steps that the prosecutor might have\ntaken in an effort to find the witness, but we observed that\n“[o]ne, in hindsight, may always think of other things.”\n448 U. S., at 75. But “the great improbability that such\nefforts would have resulted in locating the witness, and\nwould have led to her production at trial, neutralizes any\nintimation that a concept of reasonableness required their\nexecution.” Id., at 76.\n   In the present case, the holding of the Illinois Court of\nAppeals that the State conducted the requisite good-faith\nsearch for A. S. did not represent an unreasonable appli-\ncation of our Confrontation Clause precedents. Whether\nor not the state court went too far in characterizing the\nprosecution’s efforts as “superhuman,” the state court\nidentified the correct Sixth Amendment standard and\napplied it in a reasonable manner.\n   The Seventh Circuit found that the State’s efforts were\ninadequate for three main reasons. First, the Seventh\nCircuit faulted the State for failing to contact “A. S.’s\ncurrent boyfriend—whom she was with just moments\nbefore the alleged assault—or any of her other friends in\nthe Chicago area.” 632 F. 3d, at 362. But the record does\nnot show that any of A. S.’s family members or any other\npersons interviewed by the State provided any reason to\nbelieve that any of these individuals had information\nabout A. S.’s whereabouts.\n   Second, the Seventh Circuit criticized the State because\nit did not make inquiries at the cosmetology school where\nA. S. had once been enrolled, ibid., but the court’s own\nopinion observed that the information about A. S.’s en-\nrollment at the cosmetology school after the mistrial was\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)              7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nnot “noteworthy” or “particularly helpful.” Ibid. Since\nA. S. had not attended the school for some time, Exh. K, at\nE–42, there is no reason to believe that anyone at the\nschool had better information about A. S.’s location than\ndid the members of her family.\n   Finally, the Seventh Circuit found that the State’s\nefforts were insufficient because it had neglected to serve\nher with a subpoena after she expressed fear about testify-\ning at the retrial. A. S., however, had expressed fear\nabout testifying at the first trial but had nevertheless\nappeared in court and had taken the stand. The State\nrepresented that A. S., although fearful, had agreed to\ntestify at the retrial as well. 632 F. 3d, at 362. We have\nnever held that the prosecution must have issued a sub-\npoena if it wishes to prove that a witness who goes into\nhiding is unavailable for Confrontation Clause purposes,\nand the issuance of a subpoena may do little good if a\nsexual assault witness is so fearful of an assailant that she\nis willing to risk his acquittal by failing to testify at trial.\n   As we observed in Roberts, when a witness disappears\nbefore trial, it is always possible to think of additional\nsteps that the prosecution might have taken to secure the\nwitness’ presence, see 448 U. S., at 75, but the Sixth\nAmendment does not require the prosecution to exhaust\nevery avenue of inquiry, no matter how unpromising.\nAnd, more to the point, the deferential standard of review\nset out in 28 U. S. C. §2254(d) does not permit a federal\ncourt to overturn a state court’s decision on the question of\nunavailability merely because the federal court identifies\nadditional steps that might have been taken. Under\nAEDPA, if the state-court decision was reasonable, it\ncannot be disturbed.\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari and Cross’ motion to\nproceed in forma pauperis are granted, and the judgment\nof the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is\n\n                                                     Reversed.\n</pre>", "id": 618679, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2011/12/12/Hardy_v._Cross.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                 Cite as: 565 U.

We\nalso noted that the State had served five subpoenas in the\nwitness’ name to her parents’ residence over a 4-month\n6                      HARDY v. CROSS\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nperiod prior to the trial. “ ‘The lengths to which the prose-\ncution must go to produce a witness,’ ” the Court made\nclear, “ ‘is a question of reasonableness.’ ” Id., at 74 (quot-\ning California v. Green, 399 U. S. 149, 189, n. 22 (1970)\n(Harlan, J., concurring)). We acknowledged that there\nwere some additional steps that the prosecutor might have\ntaken in an effort to find the witness, but we observed that\n“[o]ne, in hindsight, may always think of other things.”\n448 U. S., at 75. But “the great improbability that such\nefforts would have resulted in locating the witness, and\nwould have led to her production at trial, neutralizes any\nintimation that a concept of reasonableness required their\nexecution.” Id., at 76.\n   In the present case, the holding of the Illinois Court of\nAppeals that the State conducted the requisite good-faith\nsearch for A. S. did not represent an unreasonable appli-\ncation of our Confrontation Clause precedents. Whether\nor not the state court went too far in characterizing the\nprosecution’s efforts as “superhuman,” the state court\nidentified the correct Sixth Amendment standard and\napplied it in a reasonable manner.\n   The Seventh Circuit found that the State’s efforts were\ninadequate for three main reasons. First, the Seventh\nCircuit faulted the State for failing to contact “A. S.’s\ncurrent boyfriend—whom she was with just moments\nbefore the alleged assault—or any of her other friends in\nthe Chicago area.” 632 F. 3d, at 362. But the record does\nnot show that any of A. S.’s family members or any other\npersons interviewed by the State provided any reason to\nbelieve that any of these individuals had information\nabout A. S.’s whereabouts.\n   Second, the Seventh Circuit criticized the State because\nit did not make inquiries at the cosmetology school where\nA. S. had once been enrolled, ibid., but the court’s own\nopinion observed that the information about A. S.’s en-\nrollment at the cosmetology school after the mistrial was\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2011)              7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nnot “noteworthy” or “particularly helpful.” Ibid. Since\nA. S. had not attended the school for some time, Exh. K, at\nE–42, there is no reason to believe that anyone at the\nschool had better information about A. S.’s location than\ndid the members of her family.\n   Finally, the Seventh Circuit found that the State’s\nefforts were insufficient because it had neglected to serve\nher with a subpoena after she expressed fear about testify-\ning at the retrial. A. S., however, had expressed fear\nabout testifying at the first trial but had nevertheless\nappeared in court and had taken the stand. The State\nrepresented that A. S., although fearful, had agreed to\ntestify at the retrial as well. 632 F. 3d, at 362. We have\nnever held that the prosecution must have issued a sub-\npoena if it wishes to prove that a witness who goes into\nhiding is unavailable for Confrontation Clause purposes,\nand the issuance of a subpoena may do little good if a\nsexual assault witness is so fearful of an assailant that she\nis willing to risk his acquittal by failing to testify at trial.\n   As we observed in Roberts, when a witness disappears\nbefore trial, it is always possible to think of additional\nsteps that the prosecution might have taken to secure the\nwitness’ presence, see 448 U. S., at 75, but the Sixth\nAmendment does not require the prosecution to exhaust\nevery avenue of inquiry, no matter how unpromising.\nAnd, more to the point, the deferential standard of review\nset out in 28 U. S. C. §2254(d) does not permit a federal\ncourt to overturn a state court’s decision on the question of\nunavailability merely because the federal court identifies\nadditional steps that might have been taken. Under\nAEDPA, if the state-court decision was reasonable, it\ncannot be disturbed.\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari and Cross’ motion to\nproceed in forma pauperis are granted, and the judgment\nof the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is\n\n                                                     Reversed.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/618679/", "sha1": "f450b4c1fcb9b69e5669915dc01f07e1e4e50819", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2011-12-12T07:42:18"}
