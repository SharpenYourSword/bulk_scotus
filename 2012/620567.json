Argued November 1, 2011—Decided January 10, 2012\nRespondent Pollard sought damages from employees at a privately run\n  federal prison in California, claiming that they had deprived him of\n  adequate medical care in violation of the Eighth Amendment’s prohi-\n  bition against cruel and unusual punishment. The Federal District\n  Court dismissed the complaint, ruling that the Eighth Amendment\n  does not imply an action under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics\n  Agents, 403 U. S. 388, against a privately managed prison’s person-\n  nel. The Ninth Circuit reversed.\nHeld: Because in the circumstance of this case, state tort law authorizes\n adequate alternative damages actions—providing both significant de-\n terrence and compensation—no Bivens remedy can be implied here.\n Pp. 3−12.\n    (a) Wilkie v. Robbins, 551 U. S. 537, fairly summarizes the basic\n considerations the Court applies here. In deciding whether to recog-\n nize a Bivens remedy, a court must first ask “whether any alterna-\n tive, existing process for protecting the [constitutionally recognized]\n interest amounts to a convincing reason for the Judicial Branch to re-\n frain from providing a new and freestanding” damages remedy. Even\n absent an alternative, “a Bivens remedy is a subject of judgment: ‘the\n federal courts must make the kind of remedial determination that is\n appropriate for a common-law tribunal, paying particular heed . . . to\n any special factors counselling hesitation before authorizing a new\n kind of federal litigation.’ ” Id., at 550. In Bivens itself, the Court\n held that the Fourth Amendment implicitly authorized a court to or-\n der federal agents to pay damages to a person injured by the agents’\n violation of the Amendment’s strictures, 403 U. S., at 389, noting that\n the Fourth Amendment prohibited conduct that state law might\n permit, id., at 392–393, and that the interests protected on the one\n2                         MINNECI v. POLLARD\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    hand by state “trespass” and “invasion of privacy” laws and on the\n    other hand by the Fourth Amendment “may be inconsistent or even\n    hostile,” id., at 394. It also stated that “[h]istorically, damages have\n    been regarded as the ordinary remedy for an invasion of personal in-\n    terests in liberty,” id., at 395, and found “no special factors counsel-\n    ling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress.” Id.,\n    at 396. Bivens actions were allowed in Davis v. Passman, 442 U. S.\n    228, for a Fifth Amendment due process claim involving gender-\n    based employment discrimination, and in Carlson v. Green, 446 U. S.\n    14, for an Eighth Amendment claim based on federal government of-\n    ficials’ “deliberat[e] indifferen[ce]” to a federal prisoner’s medical\n    needs, id., at 16, n. 1, 17. Since Carlson, this Court has declined to\n    imply a Bivens action in several different instances. See, e.g., Bush v.\n    Lucas, 462 U. S. 367, Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534\n    U. S. 61.\n       Applying Wilkie’s approach here, Pollard cannot assert a Bivens\n    claim, primarily because his Eighth Amendment claim focuses on a\n    kind of conduct that typically falls within the scope of traditional\n    state tort law. And in the case of a privately employed defendant,\n    state tort law provides an “alternative, existing process” capable of\n    protecting the constitutional interests at stake. Wilkie, 551 U. S., at\n    550. The existence of that alternative remedy constitutes a “convinc-\n    ing reason for the Judicial Branch to refrain from providing a new\n    and freestanding” damages remedy. Ibid. Pp. 3−7.\n       (b) Pollard’s contrary arguments are rejected. First, he claims that\n    Carlson authorizes an Eighth Amendment-based Bivens action here,\n    but Carlson involved government, not privately employed, personnel.\n    The potential existence of an “adequate alternative, existing process”\n    differs dramatically for public and private employees, as prisoners\n    ordinarily can bring state tort actions against private employees, but\n    not against public ones. Second, Pollard’s argument that this Court\n    should consider only whether federal laws provide adequate alterna-\n    tive remedies because of the “vagaries” of state tort law, Carlson, su-\n    pra, at 23, was rejected in Malesko, supra, at 72−73. Third, Pollard\n    claims that state tort law does not provide remedies adequate to pro-\n    tect the constitutional interests at issue here, but California, like\n    every other State (as far as the Court is aware), has tort law that\n    provides for negligence actions for claims such as his. That the state\n    law may prove less generous than would a Bivens action does not\n    render the state law inadequate, and state remedies and a potential\n    Bivens remedy need not be perfectly congruent. Fourth, Pollard ar-\n    gues that there may be similar Eighth Amendment claims that state\n    tort law does not cover, but he offers no supporting cases.

See generally Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcot-\nics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, 389 (1971) (“[V]iolation of [the\nFourth Amendment] by a federal agent . . . gives rise to a\ncause of action for damages” against a Federal Govern-\nment employee). Because we believe that in the circum-\nstances present here state tort law authorizes adequate\nalternative damages actions—actions that provide both\nsignificant deterrence and compensation—we cannot do\nso. See Wilkie v. Robbins, 551 U. S. 537, 550 (2007) (no\nBivens action where “alternative, existing” processes\nprovide adequate protection).\n                              I\n   Richard Lee Pollard was a prisoner at a federal facility\noperated by a private company, the Wackenhut Correc-\ntions Corporation. In 2002 he filed a pro se complaint in\nfederal court against several Wackenhut employees, who\n(now) include a security officer, a food-services supervisor,\n2                   MINNECI v. POLLARD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand several members of the medical staff. As the Federal\nMagistrate Judge interpreted Pollard’s complaint, he\nclaimed that these employees had deprived him of ade-\nquate medical care, had thereby violated the Eighth\nAmendment’s prohibition against “cruel and unusual”\npunishment, and had caused him injury. He sought\ndamages.\n   Pollard said that a year earlier he had slipped on a cart\nleft in the doorway of the prison’s butcher shop. The\nprison medical staff took x rays, thought he might have\nfractured both elbows, brought him to an outside clinic for\nfurther orthopedic evaluation, and subsequently arranged\nfor surgery. In particular, Pollard claimed:\n   (1) Despite his having told a prison guard that he could\nnot extend his arm, the guard forced him to put on a\njumpsuit (to travel to the outside clinic), causing him “the\nmost excruciating pain,” App. 32;\n   (2) During several visits to the outside clinic, prison\nguards made Pollard wear arm restraints that were con-\nnected in a way that caused him continued pain;\n   (3) Prison medical (and other) personnel failed to follow\nthe outside clinic’s instructions to put Pollard’s left elbow\nin a posterior splint, failed to provide necessary physical\ntherapy, and failed to conduct necessary studies, including\nnerve conduction studies;\n   (4) At times when Pollard’s arms were in casts or simi-\nlarly disabled, prison officials failed to make alternative\narrangements for him to receive meals, with the result\nthat (to avoid “being humiliated” in the general food ser-\nvice area, id., at 35) Pollard had to auction off personal\nitems to obtain funds to buy food at the commissary;\n   (5) Prison officials deprived him of basic hygienic care\nto the point where he could not bathe for two weeks;\n   (6) Prison medical staff provided him with insufficient\nmedicine, to the point where he was in pain and could not\nsleep; and\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  (7) Prison officials forced him to return to work before\nhis injuries had healed.\n  After concluding that the Eighth Amendment did not\nprovide for a Bivens action against a privately managed\nprison’s personnel, the Magistrate Judge recommended\nthat the District Court dismiss Pollard’s complaint. The\nDistrict Court did so. But on appeal the Ninth Circuit\nfound that the Eighth Amendment provided Pollard with a\nBivens action, and it reversed the District Court. Pollard\nv. The GEO Group, Inc., 607 F. 3d 583, 603, as amended,\n629 F. 3d 843, 868 (CA9 2010).\n  The defendants sought certiorari. And, in light of a split\namong the Courts of Appeals, we granted the petition. Com-\npare ibid. (finding an Eighth Amendment Bivens action\nwhere prisoner sues employees of a privately operated\nfederal prison), with, e.g., Alba v. Montford, 517 F. 3d\n1249, 1254–1256 (CA11 2008) (no Bivens action available),\nand Holly v. Scott, 434 F. 3d 287, 288 (CA4 2006) (same).\n                           II\n  Recently, in Wilkie v. Robbins, supra, we rejected a\nclaim that the Fifth Amendment impliedly authorized a\nBivens action that would permit landowners to obtain\ndamages from government officials who unconstitutionally\ninterfere with their exercise of property rights. After\nreviewing the Court’s earlier Bivens cases, the Court\nstated:\n    “[T]he decision whether to recognize a Bivens remedy\n    may require two steps. In the first place, there is the\n    question whether any alternative, existing process for\n    protecting the [constitutionally recognized] interest\n    amounts to a convincing reason for the Judicial\n    Branch to refrain from providing a new and freestand-\n    ing remedy in damages. . . . But even in the absence\n    of an alternative, a Bivens remedy is a subject of\n    judgment: ‘the federal courts must make the kind of\n4                   MINNECI v. POLLARD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    remedial determination that is appropriate for a\n    common-law tribunal, paying particular heed, how-\n    ever, to any special factors counselling hesitation be-\n    fore authorizing a new kind of federal litigation.’ ” 551\n    U. S., at 550 (quoting Bush v. Lucas, 462 U. S. 367,\n    378 (1983)).\n   These standards seek to reflect and to reconcile the\nCourt’s reasoning set forth in earlier cases. In Bivens\nitself the Court held that the Fourth Amendment implicit-\nly authorized a court to order federal agents to pay dam-\nages to a person injured by the agents’ violation of the\nAmendment’s constitutional strictures. 403 U. S., at 389.\nThe Court noted that “ ‘where federally protected rights\nhave been invaded,’ ”courts can “ ‘adjust their remedies so\nas to grant the necessary relief.’ ” Id., at 392 (quoting Bell\nv. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 684 (1946)). See also Correctional\nServices Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U. S. 61, 66 (2001) (“author-\nity to imply a new constitutional tort” anchored within\ngeneral “ ‘arising under’ ” jurisdiction). It pointed out that\nthe Fourth Amendment prohibited, among other things,\nconduct that state law might permit (such as the conduct\nat issue in that very case). Bivens, 403 U. S., at 392–393.\nIt added that the interests protected on the one hand by\nstate “trespass” and “invasion of privacy” laws and on the\nother hand by the Fourth Amendment’s guarantees “may\nbe inconsistent or even hostile.” Id., at 394. It stated\nthat “[h]istorically, damages have been regarded as the\nordinary remedy for an invasion of personal interests in\nliberty.” Id., at 395. And it found “no special factors\ncounselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action\nby Congress.” Id., at 396.\n   In Davis v. Passman, 442 U. S. 228 (1979), the Court\nconsidered a former congressional employee’s claim for\ndamages suffered as a result of her employer’s unconstitu-\ntional discrimination based on gender. The Court found a\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndamages action implicit in the Fifth Amendment’s Due\nProcess Clause. Id., at 248–249. In doing so, the Court\nemphasized the unavailability of “other alternative forms\nof judicial relief.” Id., at 245. And the Court noted that\nthere was “no evidence” that Congress (or the Constitu-\ntion) intended to foreclose such a remedy. Id., at 247.\n   In Carlson v. Green, 446 U. S. 14 (1980), the Court\nconsidered a claim for damages brought by the estate of\na federal prisoner who (the estate said) had died as the\nresult of government officials’ “deliberat[e] indifferen[ce]”\nto his medical needs—indifference that violated the\nEighth Amendment. Id., at 16, n. 1, 17 (citing Estelle v.\nGamble, 429 U. S. 97 (1976)). The Court implied an action\nfor damages from the Eighth Amendment. 446 U. S., at\n17–18. It noted that state law offered the particular plain-\ntiff no meaningful damages remedy. Id., at 17, n. 4.\nAlthough the estate might have brought a damages claim\nunder the Federal Tort Claims Act, the defendant in any\nsuch lawsuit was the employer, namely the United States,\nnot the individual officers who had committed the viola-\ntion. Id., at 21. A damages remedy against an individual\nofficer, the Court added, would prove a more effective\ndeterrent. Ibid. And, rather than leave compensation to\nthe “vagaries” of state tort law, a federal Bivens action\nwould provide “uniform rules.” 446 U. S., at 23.\n   Since Carlson, the Court has had to decide in several\ndifferent instances whether to imply a Bivens action. And\nin each instance it has decided against the existence of\nsuch an action. These instances include:\n   (1) A federal employee’s claim that his federal employer\ndismissed him in violation of the First Amendment, Bush,\nsupra, at 386–388 (congressionally created federal civil\nservice procedures provide meaningful redress);\n   (2) A claim by military personnel that military superi-\nors violated various constitutional provisions, Chappell v.\nWallace, 462 U. S. 296, 298–300 (1983) (special factors\n6                  MINNECI v. POLLARD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrelated to the military counsel against implying a Bivens\naction), see also United States v. Stanley, 483 U. S. 669,\n683–684 (1987) (similar);\n   (3) A claim by recipients of Social Security disability\nbenefits that benefits had been denied in violation of the\nFifth Amendment, Schweiker v. Chilicky, 487 U. S. 412,\n414, 425 (1988) (elaborate administrative scheme provides\nmeaningful alternative remedy);\n   (4) A former bank employee’s suit against a federal\nbanking agency, claiming that he lost his job due to agency\naction that violated the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process\nClause, FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U. S. 471, 484–486 (1994) (no\nBivens actions against government agencies rather than\nparticular individuals who act unconstitutionally);\n   (5) A prisoner’s Eighth Amendment-based suit against\na private corporation that managed a federal prison, Ma-\nlesko, 534 U. S., at 70–73 (to permit suit against the\nemployer-corporation would risk skewing relevant incen-\ntives; at the same time, the ability of a prisoner to bring\nstate tort law damages action against private individual\ndefendants means that the prisoner does not “lack effec-\ntive remedies,” id., at 72).\n   Although the Court, in reaching its decisions, has not\nalways similarly emphasized the same aspects of the\ncases, Wilkie fairly summarizes the basic considerations\nthat underlie those decisions. 551 U. S., at 550. We con-\nsequently apply its approach here. And we conclude that\nPollard cannot assert a Bivens claim.\n   That is primarily because Pollard’s Eighth Amendment\nclaim focuses upon a kind of conduct that typically falls\nwithin the scope of traditional state tort law. And in the\ncase of a privately employed defendant, state tort law\nprovides an “alternative, existing process” capable of\nprotecting the constitutional interests at stake. 551 U. S.,\nat 550. The existence of that alternative here constitutes\na “convincing reason for the Judicial Branch to refrain\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom providing a new and freestanding remedy in dam-\nages.” Ibid. Our reasoning is best understood if we set\nforth and explain why we reject Pollard’s arguments to the\ncontrary.\n                            III\n  Pollard (together with supporting amici) asks us to\nimply a Bivens action for four basic reasons—none of\nwhich we find convincing. First, Pollard argues that this\nCourt has already decided in Carlson that a federal pris-\noner may bring an Eighth Amendment-based Bivens\naction against prison personnel; and we need do no more\nthan simply apply Carlson’s holding here. Carlson, how-\never, was a case in which a federal prisoner sought dam-\nages from personnel employed by the government, not\npersonnel employed by a private firm. 446 U. S., at 25.\nAnd for present purposes that fact—of employment\nstatus—makes a critical difference.\n  For one thing, the potential existence of an adequate\n“alternative, existing process” differs dramatically in the\ntwo sets of cases. Prisoners ordinarily cannot bring state-\nlaw tort actions against employees of the Federal Govern-\nment. See 28 U. S. C. §§2671, 2679(b)(1) (Westfall Act)\n(substituting United States as defendant in tort action\nagainst federal employee); Osborn v. Haley, 549 U. S. 225,\n238, 241 (2007) (Westfall Act immunizes federal employee\nthrough removal and substitution of United States as\ndefendant). But prisoners ordinarily can bring state-law\ntort actions against employees of a private firm. Infra, at\n9–10.\n  For another thing, the Court specifically rejected Justice\nStevens’ somewhat similar suggestion in his dissenting\nopinion in Malesko, namely that a prisoner’s suit against a\nprivate prison-management firm should fall within Carl-\nson’s earlier holding because such a firm, like a federal\nemployee, is a “federal agent.” Compare Malesko, 534\n8                   MINNECI v. POLLARD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S., at 70, and n. 4 (majority opinion), with id., at 76–77,\n82 (dissenting opinion). In rejecting the dissent’s sugges-\ntion, the Court explained that the context in Malesko was\n“fundamentally different” from the contexts at issue in\nearlier cases, including Carlson. 534 U. S., at 70. That\ndifference, the Court said, reflected in part the nature of\nthe defendant, i.e., a corporate employer rather than an\nindividual employee, ibid., and in part reflected the exist-\nence of alternative “effective” state tort remedies, id., at\n72–73. This last-mentioned factor makes it difficult to\nsquare Pollard’s argument with Malesko’s reasoning.\n   Second, Pollard argues that, because of the “vagaries” of\nstate tort law, Carlson, 446 U. S., at 23, we should consid-\ner only whether federal law provides adequate alternative\nremedies. See id., at 18–19, 23 (considering adequacy of\nfederal remedies); see also, e.g., Schweiker, supra, at 423\n(similar); Bush, 462 U. S., at 378 (similar). But cf. Carl-\nson, supra, at 24 (“ ‘[R]elevant Indiana statute would not\npermit survival of the [state tort] claim’ ”). This argument\nflounders, however, on the fact that the Court rejected it\nin Malesko. Compare 534 U. S., at 72–73 (majority opin-\nion), with id., at 79–80 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (making\nsimilar suggestion). State tort law, after all, can help to\ndeter constitutional violations as well as to provide com-\npensation to a violation’s victim. And it is consequently\nunsurprising that several cases have considered the ade-\nquacy or inadequacy of state-law remedies when determin-\ning whether to imply a Bivens remedy. See, e.g., Bivens,\n403 U. S., at 394 (state tort law “inconsistent or even\nhostile” to Fourth Amendment); Davis, 442 U. S., at 245,\nn. 23 (noting no state-law remedy available); cf. Malesko,\nsupra, at 70 (noting that the Court has implied Bivens\naction only where any alternative remedy against individ-\nual officers was “nonexistent” or where plaintiff “lacked\nany alternative remedy” at all).\n   Third, Pollard argues that state tort law does not pro-\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvide remedies adequate to protect the constitutional inter-\nests at issue here. Pollard’s claim, however, is a claim for\nphysical or related emotional harm suffered as a result of\naggravated instances of the kind of conduct that state\ntort law typically forbids. That claim arose in California,\nwhere state tort law provides for ordinary negligence\nactions, for actions based upon “want of ordinary care or\nskill,” for actions for “negligent failure to diagnose or\ntreat,” and for actions based upon the failure of one with a\ncustodial duty to care for another to protect that other\nfrom “ ‘unreasonable risk of physical harm.’ ” See Cal.

Supp.) (similar).\n   We note, as Pollard points out, that state tort law may\nsometimes prove less generous than would a Bivens ac-\ntion, say, by capping damages, see Cal. Civ. Code Ann.\n§3333.2(b) (West 1997), or by forbidding recovery for emo-\ntional suffering unconnected with physical harm, see 629\nF. 3d, at 864, or by imposing procedural obstacles, say,\ninitially requiring the use of expert administrative panels\nin medical malpractice cases, see, e.g., Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.,\nTit. 24, §2853, (Supp. 2010); Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 231,\n§60B (West 2010). But we cannot find in this fact suffi-\ncient basis to determine state law inadequate.\n   State-law remedies and a potential Bivens remedy need\nnot be perfectly congruent. See Bush, supra, at 388 (ad-\nministrative remedies adequate even though they “do not\nprovide complete relief ”). Indeed, federal law as well as\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstate law contains limitations. Prisoners bringing federal\nlawsuits, for example, ordinarily may not seek damages\nfor mental or emotional injury unconnected with physical\ninjury. See 42 U. S. C. §1997e(e). And Bivens actions,\neven if more generous to plaintiffs in some respects, may\nbe less generous in others. For example, to show an\nEighth Amendment violation a prisoner must typically\nshow that a defendant acted, not just negligently, but with\n“deliberate indifference.” Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S.\n825, 834 (1994). And a Bivens plaintiff, unlike a state\ntort law plaintiff, normally could not apply principles of\nrespondeat superior and thereby obtain recovery from a\ndefendant’s potentially deep-pocketed employer. See Ash-\ncroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662, 676 (2009).\n  Rather, in principle, the question is whether, in general,\nstate tort law remedies provide roughly similar incentives\nfor potential defendants to comply with the Eighth\nAmendment while also providing roughly similar compen-\nsation to victims of violations. The features of the two\nkinds of actions just mentioned suggest that, in practice,\nthe answer to this question is “yes.” And we have found\nnothing here to convince us to the contrary.\n  Fourth, Pollard argues that there “may” be similar\nkinds of Eighth Amendment claims that state tort law\ndoes not cover. But Pollard does not convincingly show\nthat there are such cases. Compare Brief for Respondent\nPollard 32 (questioning the availability of state tort reme-\ndies for “prisoners [who] suffer attacks by other inmates,\npreventable suicides, or the denial of heat, ventilation or\nmovement”), with Giraldo, supra, at 248–249, 85 Cal Rptr.\n3d, at 384–385 (courts have long held that prison officials\nmust protect, e.g., transgender inmate from foreseeable\nharm by other inmates), and Restatement (Second) of\nTorts §§314A(4), 320.\n  Regardless, we concede that we cannot prove a negative\nor be totally certain that the features of state tort law\n12                  MINNECI v. POLLARD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrelevant here will universally prove to be, or remain, as we\nhave described them. Nonetheless, we are certain enough\nabout the shape of present law as applied to the kind of\ncase before us to leave different cases and different state\nlaws to another day. That is to say, we can decide wheth-\ner to imply a Bivens action in a case where an Eighth\nAmendment claim or state law differs significantly from\nthose at issue here when and if such a case arises. The\npossibility of such a different future case does not provide\nsufficient grounds for reaching a different conclusion here.\n  For these reasons, where, as here, a federal prisoner\nseeks damages from privately employed personnel work-\ning at a privately operated federal prison, where the con-\nduct allegedly amounts to a violation of the Eighth\nAmendment, and where that conduct is of a kind that\ntypically falls within the scope of traditional state tort law\n(such as the conduct involving improper medical care at\nissue here), the prisoner must seek a remedy under state\ntort law. We cannot imply a Bivens remedy in such a case.\n  The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed.\n\n                                                  So ordered.\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

See Carlson v. Green,\n446 U. S. 14 (1980) (Bivens action); Estelle v. Gamble, 429\nU. S. 97 (1976) (42 U. S. C. §1983 action). For the reasons\nstated in the dissenting opinion I joined in Correctional\nServices Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U. S. 61, 75–83 (2001)\n(opinion of Stevens, J.), I would not deny the same charac-\nter of relief to Pollard, a prisoner placed by federal con-\ntract in a privately operated prison. Pollard may have\nsuffered “aggravated instances” of conduct state tort law\nforbids, ante, at 9 (opinion of the Court), but that same\naggravated conduct, when it is engaged in by official ac-\ntors,* also offends the Federal Constitution, see Estelle,\n429 U. S., at 105–106. Rather than remitting Pollard to\nthe “vagaries” of state tort law, Carlson, 446 U. S., at 23,\nI would hold his injuries, sustained while serving a feder-\nal sentence, “compensable according to uniform rules of\nfederal law,” Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics\nAgents, 403 U. S. 388, 409 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring\n——————\n  * The Ninth Circuit ruled that petitioners acted under color of federal\nlaw, Pollard v.

POLLARD\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nin judgment).\n   Indeed, there is stronger cause for providing a federal\nremedy in this case than there was in Malesko. There, the\nquestion presented was whether a Bivens action lies\nagainst a private corporation that manages a facility\nhousing federal prisoners. Malesko, 534 U. S., at 63.\nSuing a corporate employer, the majority observed in\nMalesko, would not serve to deter individual officers from\nconduct transgressing constitutional limitations on their\nauthority. Id., at 70–71. Individual deterrence, the Court\nreminded, was the consideration central to the Bivens\ndecision. Malesko, 534 U. S., at 70. Noting the availabil-\nity of state tort remedies, the majority in Malesko declined\nto “exten[d] Bivens beyond [that decision’s] core premise,”\ni.e., deterring individual officers. Malesko, 534 U. S., at\n71–73. Pollard’s case, in contrast, involves Bivens’ core\nconcern: His suit seeking damages directly from individu-\nal officers would have precisely the deterrent effect the\nCourt found absent in Malesko.\n   For the reasons stated, I would hold that relief poten-\ntially available under state tort law does not block Pol-\nlard’s recourse to a federal remedy for the affront to the\nConstitution he suffered. Accordingly, I would affirm the\nNinth Circuit’s judgment.\n</pre>", "id": 620567, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2012/01/10/Minneci_v._Pollard.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2011                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued November 1, 2011—Decided January 10, 2012\nRespondent Pollard sought damages from employees at a privately run\n  federal prison in California, claiming that they had deprived him of\n  adequate medical care in violation of the Eighth Amendment’s prohi-\n  bition against cruel and unusual punishment. The Federal District\n  Court dismissed the complaint, ruling that the Eighth Amendment\n  does not imply an action under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics\n  Agents, 403 U. S. 388, against a privately managed prison’s person-\n  nel. The Ninth Circuit reversed.\nHeld: Because in the circumstance of this case, state tort law authorizes\n adequate alternative damages actions—providing both significant de-\n terrence and compensation—no Bivens remedy can be implied here.\n Pp. 3−12.\n    (a) Wilkie v. Robbins, 551 U. S. 537, fairly summarizes the basic\n considerations the Court applies here. In deciding whether to recog-\n nize a Bivens remedy, a court must first ask “whether any alterna-\n tive, existing process for protecting the [constitutionally recognized]\n interest amounts to a convincing reason for the Judicial Branch to re-\n frain from providing a new and freestanding” damages remedy. Even\n absent an alternative, “a Bivens remedy is a subject of judgment: ‘the\n federal courts must make the kind of remedial determination that is\n appropriate for a common-law tribunal, paying particular heed . . . to\n any special factors counselling hesitation before authorizing a new\n kind of federal litigation.’ ” Id., at 550. In Bivens itself, the Court\n held that the Fourth Amendment implicitly authorized a court to or-\n der federal agents to pay damages to a person injured by the agents’\n violation of the Amendment’s strictures, 403 U. S., at 389, noting that\n the Fourth Amendment prohibited conduct that state law might\n permit, id., at 392–393, and that the interests protected on the one\n2                         MINNECI v. POLLARD\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    hand by state “trespass” and “invasion of privacy” laws and on the\n    other hand by the Fourth Amendment “may be inconsistent or even\n    hostile,” id., at 394. It also stated that “[h]istorically, damages have\n    been regarded as the ordinary remedy for an invasion of personal in-\n    terests in liberty,” id., at 395, and found “no special factors counsel-\n    ling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress.” Id.,\n    at 396. Bivens actions were allowed in Davis v. Passman, 442 U. S.\n    228, for a Fifth Amendment due process claim involving gender-\n    based employment discrimination, and in Carlson v. Green, 446 U. S.\n    14, for an Eighth Amendment claim based on federal government of-\n    ficials’ “deliberat[e] indifferen[ce]” to a federal prisoner’s medical\n    needs, id., at 16, n. 1, 17. Since Carlson, this Court has declined to\n    imply a Bivens action in several different instances. See, e.g., Bush v.\n    Lucas, 462 U. S. 367, Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534\n    U. S. 61.\n       Applying Wilkie’s approach here, Pollard cannot assert a Bivens\n    claim, primarily because his Eighth Amendment claim focuses on a\n    kind of conduct that typically falls within the scope of traditional\n    state tort law. And in the case of a privately employed defendant,\n    state tort law provides an “alternative, existing process” capable of\n    protecting the constitutional interests at stake. Wilkie, 551 U. S., at\n    550. The existence of that alternative remedy constitutes a “convinc-\n    ing reason for the Judicial Branch to refrain from providing a new\n    and freestanding” damages remedy. Ibid. Pp. 3−7.\n       (b) Pollard’s contrary arguments are rejected. First, he claims that\n    Carlson authorizes an Eighth Amendment-based Bivens action here,\n    but Carlson involved government, not privately employed, personnel.\n    The potential existence of an “adequate alternative, existing process”\n    differs dramatically for public and private employees, as prisoners\n    ordinarily can bring state tort actions against private employees, but\n    not against public ones. Second, Pollard’s argument that this Court\n    should consider only whether federal laws provide adequate alterna-\n    tive remedies because of the “vagaries” of state tort law, Carlson, su-\n    pra, at 23, was rejected in Malesko, supra, at 72−73. Third, Pollard\n    claims that state tort law does not provide remedies adequate to pro-\n    tect the constitutional interests at issue here, but California, like\n    every other State (as far as the Court is aware), has tort law that\n    provides for negligence actions for claims such as his. That the state\n    law may prove less generous than would a Bivens action does not\n    render the state law inadequate, and state remedies and a potential\n    Bivens remedy need not be perfectly congruent. Fourth, Pollard ar-\n    gues that there may be similar Eighth Amendment claims that state\n    tort law does not cover, but he offers no supporting cases.

S. 388, 389 (1971) (“[V]iolation of [the\nFourth Amendment] by a federal agent . . . gives rise to a\ncause of action for damages” against a Federal Govern-\nment employee). Because we believe that in the circum-\nstances present here state tort law authorizes adequate\nalternative damages actions—actions that provide both\nsignificant deterrence and compensation—we cannot do\nso. See Wilkie v. Robbins, 551 U.

POLLARD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand several members of the medical staff. As the Federal\nMagistrate Judge interpreted Pollard’s complaint, he\nclaimed that these employees had deprived him of ade-\nquate medical care, had thereby violated the Eighth\nAmendment’s prohibition against “cruel and unusual”\npunishment, and had caused him injury. He sought\ndamages.\n   Pollard said that a year earlier he had slipped on a cart\nleft in the doorway of the prison’s butcher shop. The\nprison medical staff took x rays, thought he might have\nfractured both elbows, brought him to an outside clinic for\nfurther orthopedic evaluation, and subsequently arranged\nfor surgery. In particular, Pollard claimed:\n   (1) Despite his having told a prison guard that he could\nnot extend his arm, the guard forced him to put on a\njumpsuit (to travel to the outside clinic), causing him “the\nmost excruciating pain,” App. 32;\n   (2) During several visits to the outside clinic, prison\nguards made Pollard wear arm restraints that were con-\nnected in a way that caused him continued pain;\n   (3) Prison medical (and other) personnel failed to follow\nthe outside clinic’s instructions to put Pollard’s left elbow\nin a posterior splint, failed to provide necessary physical\ntherapy, and failed to conduct necessary studies, including\nnerve conduction studies;\n   (4) At times when Pollard’s arms were in casts or simi-\nlarly disabled, prison officials failed to make alternative\narrangements for him to receive meals, with the result\nthat (to avoid “being humiliated” in the general food ser-\nvice area, id., at 35) Pollard had to auction off personal\nitems to obtain funds to buy food at the commissary;\n   (5) Prison officials deprived him of basic hygienic care\nto the point where he could not bathe for two weeks;\n   (6) Prison medical staff provided him with insufficient\nmedicine, to the point where he was in pain and could not\nsleep; and\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  (7) Prison officials forced him to return to work before\nhis injuries had healed.\n  After concluding that the Eighth Amendment did not\nprovide for a Bivens action against a privately managed\nprison’s personnel, the Magistrate Judge recommended\nthat the District Court dismiss Pollard’s complaint. The\nDistrict Court did so. But on appeal the Ninth Circuit\nfound that the Eighth Amendment provided Pollard with a\nBivens action, and it reversed the District Court. Pollard\nv. The GEO Group, Inc., 607 F. 3d 583, 603, as amended,\n629 F. 3d 843, 868 (CA9 2010).\n  The defendants sought certiorari. And, in light of a split\namong the Courts of Appeals, we granted the petition. Com-\npare ibid. (finding an Eighth Amendment Bivens action\nwhere prisoner sues employees of a privately operated\nfederal prison), with, e.g., Alba v. Montford, 517 F. 3d\n1249, 1254–1256 (CA11 2008) (no Bivens action available),\nand Holly v. Scott, 434 F. 3d 287, 288 (CA4 2006) (same).\n                           II\n  Recently, in Wilkie v. Robbins, supra, we rejected a\nclaim that the Fifth Amendment impliedly authorized a\nBivens action that would permit landowners to obtain\ndamages from government officials who unconstitutionally\ninterfere with their exercise of property rights. After\nreviewing the Court’s earlier Bivens cases, the Court\nstated:\n    “[T]he decision whether to recognize a Bivens remedy\n    may require two steps. In the first place, there is the\n    question whether any alternative, existing process for\n    protecting the [constitutionally recognized] interest\n    amounts to a convincing reason for the Judicial\n    Branch to refrain from providing a new and freestand-\n    ing remedy in damages. . . . But even in the absence\n    of an alternative, a Bivens remedy is a subject of\n    judgment: ‘the federal courts must make the kind of\n4                   MINNECI v. POLLARD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    remedial determination that is appropriate for a\n    common-law tribunal, paying particular heed, how-\n    ever, to any special factors counselling hesitation be-\n    fore authorizing a new kind of federal litigation.’ ” 551\n    U. S., at 550 (quoting Bush v. Lucas, 462 U. S. 367,\n    378 (1983)).\n   These standards seek to reflect and to reconcile the\nCourt’s reasoning set forth in earlier cases. In Bivens\nitself the Court held that the Fourth Amendment implicit-\nly authorized a court to order federal agents to pay dam-\nages to a person injured by the agents’ violation of the\nAmendment’s constitutional strictures. 403 U. S., at 389.\nThe Court noted that “ ‘where federally protected rights\nhave been invaded,’ ”courts can “ ‘adjust their remedies so\nas to grant the necessary relief.’ ” Id., at 392 (quoting Bell\nv. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 684 (1946)). See also Correctional\nServices Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U. S. 61, 66 (2001) (“author-\nity to imply a new constitutional tort” anchored within\ngeneral “ ‘arising under’ ” jurisdiction). It pointed out that\nthe Fourth Amendment prohibited, among other things,\nconduct that state law might permit (such as the conduct\nat issue in that very case). Bivens, 403 U. S., at 392–393.\nIt added that the interests protected on the one hand by\nstate “trespass” and “invasion of privacy” laws and on the\nother hand by the Fourth Amendment’s guarantees “may\nbe inconsistent or even hostile.” Id., at 394. It stated\nthat “[h]istorically, damages have been regarded as the\nordinary remedy for an invasion of personal interests in\nliberty.” Id., at 395. And it found “no special factors\ncounselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action\nby Congress.” Id., at 396.\n   In Davis v. Passman, 442 U. S. 228 (1979), the Court\nconsidered a former congressional employee’s claim for\ndamages suffered as a result of her employer’s unconstitu-\ntional discrimination based on gender. The Court found a\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndamages action implicit in the Fifth Amendment’s Due\nProcess Clause. Id., at 248–249. In doing so, the Court\nemphasized the unavailability of “other alternative forms\nof judicial relief.” Id., at 245. And the Court noted that\nthere was “no evidence” that Congress (or the Constitu-\ntion) intended to foreclose such a remedy. Id., at 247.\n   In Carlson v. Green, 446 U. S. 14 (1980), the Court\nconsidered a claim for damages brought by the estate of\na federal prisoner who (the estate said) had died as the\nresult of government officials’ “deliberat[e] indifferen[ce]”\nto his medical needs—indifference that violated the\nEighth Amendment. Id., at 16, n. 1, 17 (citing Estelle v.\nGamble, 429 U. S. 97 (1976)). The Court implied an action\nfor damages from the Eighth Amendment. 446 U. S., at\n17–18. It noted that state law offered the particular plain-\ntiff no meaningful damages remedy. Id., at 17, n. 4.\nAlthough the estate might have brought a damages claim\nunder the Federal Tort Claims Act, the defendant in any\nsuch lawsuit was the employer, namely the United States,\nnot the individual officers who had committed the viola-\ntion. Id., at 21. A damages remedy against an individual\nofficer, the Court added, would prove a more effective\ndeterrent. Ibid. And, rather than leave compensation to\nthe “vagaries” of state tort law, a federal Bivens action\nwould provide “uniform rules.” 446 U. S., at 23.\n   Since Carlson, the Court has had to decide in several\ndifferent instances whether to imply a Bivens action. And\nin each instance it has decided against the existence of\nsuch an action. These instances include:\n   (1) A federal employee’s claim that his federal employer\ndismissed him in violation of the First Amendment, Bush,\nsupra, at 386–388 (congressionally created federal civil\nservice procedures provide meaningful redress);\n   (2) A claim by military personnel that military superi-\nors violated various constitutional provisions, Chappell v.\nWallace, 462 U. S. 296, 298–300 (1983) (special factors\n6                  MINNECI v. POLLARD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrelated to the military counsel against implying a Bivens\naction), see also United States v. Stanley, 483 U. S. 669,\n683–684 (1987) (similar);\n   (3) A claim by recipients of Social Security disability\nbenefits that benefits had been denied in violation of the\nFifth Amendment, Schweiker v. Chilicky, 487 U. S. 412,\n414, 425 (1988) (elaborate administrative scheme provides\nmeaningful alternative remedy);\n   (4) A former bank employee’s suit against a federal\nbanking agency, claiming that he lost his job due to agency\naction that violated the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process\nClause, FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U. S. 471, 484–486 (1994) (no\nBivens actions against government agencies rather than\nparticular individuals who act unconstitutionally);\n   (5) A prisoner’s Eighth Amendment-based suit against\na private corporation that managed a federal prison, Ma-\nlesko, 534 U. S., at 70–73 (to permit suit against the\nemployer-corporation would risk skewing relevant incen-\ntives; at the same time, the ability of a prisoner to bring\nstate tort law damages action against private individual\ndefendants means that the prisoner does not “lack effec-\ntive remedies,” id., at 72).\n   Although the Court, in reaching its decisions, has not\nalways similarly emphasized the same aspects of the\ncases, Wilkie fairly summarizes the basic considerations\nthat underlie those decisions. 551 U. S., at 550. We con-\nsequently apply its approach here. And we conclude that\nPollard cannot assert a Bivens claim.\n   That is primarily because Pollard’s Eighth Amendment\nclaim focuses upon a kind of conduct that typically falls\nwithin the scope of traditional state tort law. And in the\ncase of a privately employed defendant, state tort law\nprovides an “alternative, existing process” capable of\nprotecting the constitutional interests at stake. 551 U. S.,\nat 550. The existence of that alternative here constitutes\na “convincing reason for the Judicial Branch to refrain\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom providing a new and freestanding remedy in dam-\nages.” Ibid. Our reasoning is best understood if we set\nforth and explain why we reject Pollard’s arguments to the\ncontrary.\n                            III\n  Pollard (together with supporting amici) asks us to\nimply a Bivens action for four basic reasons—none of\nwhich we find convincing. First, Pollard argues that this\nCourt has already decided in Carlson that a federal pris-\noner may bring an Eighth Amendment-based Bivens\naction against prison personnel; and we need do no more\nthan simply apply Carlson’s holding here. Carlson, how-\never, was a case in which a federal prisoner sought dam-\nages from personnel employed by the government, not\npersonnel employed by a private firm. 446 U. S., at 25.\nAnd for present purposes that fact—of employment\nstatus—makes a critical difference.\n  For one thing, the potential existence of an adequate\n“alternative, existing process” differs dramatically in the\ntwo sets of cases. Prisoners ordinarily cannot bring state-\nlaw tort actions against employees of the Federal Govern-\nment. See 28 U. S. C. §§2671, 2679(b)(1) (Westfall Act)\n(substituting United States as defendant in tort action\nagainst federal employee); Osborn v. Haley, 549 U. S. 225,\n238, 241 (2007) (Westfall Act immunizes federal employee\nthrough removal and substitution of United States as\ndefendant). But prisoners ordinarily can bring state-law\ntort actions against employees of a private firm. Infra, at\n9–10.\n  For another thing, the Court specifically rejected Justice\nStevens’ somewhat similar suggestion in his dissenting\nopinion in Malesko, namely that a prisoner’s suit against a\nprivate prison-management firm should fall within Carl-\nson’s earlier holding because such a firm, like a federal\nemployee, is a “federal agent.” Compare Malesko, 534\n8                   MINNECI v. POLLARD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S., at 70, and n. 4 (majority opinion), with id., at 76–77,\n82 (dissenting opinion). In rejecting the dissent’s sugges-\ntion, the Court explained that the context in Malesko was\n“fundamentally different” from the contexts at issue in\nearlier cases, including Carlson. 534 U. S., at 70. That\ndifference, the Court said, reflected in part the nature of\nthe defendant, i.e., a corporate employer rather than an\nindividual employee, ibid., and in part reflected the exist-\nence of alternative “effective” state tort remedies, id., at\n72–73. This last-mentioned factor makes it difficult to\nsquare Pollard’s argument with Malesko’s reasoning.\n   Second, Pollard argues that, because of the “vagaries” of\nstate tort law, Carlson, 446 U. S., at 23, we should consid-\ner only whether federal law provides adequate alternative\nremedies. See id., at 18–19, 23 (considering adequacy of\nfederal remedies); see also, e.g., Schweiker, supra, at 423\n(similar); Bush, 462 U. S., at 378 (similar). But cf. Carl-\nson, supra, at 24 (“ ‘[R]elevant Indiana statute would not\npermit survival of the [state tort] claim’ ”). This argument\nflounders, however, on the fact that the Court rejected it\nin Malesko. Compare 534 U. S., at 72–73 (majority opin-\nion), with id., at 79–80 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (making\nsimilar suggestion). State tort law, after all, can help to\ndeter constitutional violations as well as to provide com-\npensation to a violation’s victim. And it is consequently\nunsurprising that several cases have considered the ade-\nquacy or inadequacy of state-law remedies when determin-\ning whether to imply a Bivens remedy. See, e.g., Bivens,\n403 U. S., at 394 (state tort law “inconsistent or even\nhostile” to Fourth Amendment); Davis, 442 U. S., at 245,\nn. 23 (noting no state-law remedy available); cf. Malesko,\nsupra, at 70 (noting that the Court has implied Bivens\naction only where any alternative remedy against individ-\nual officers was “nonexistent” or where plaintiff “lacked\nany alternative remedy” at all).\n   Third, Pollard argues that state tort law does not pro-\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvide remedies adequate to protect the constitutional inter-\nests at issue here. Pollard’s claim, however, is a claim for\nphysical or related emotional harm suffered as a result of\naggravated instances of the kind of conduct that state\ntort law typically forbids. That claim arose in California,\nwhere state tort law provides for ordinary negligence\nactions, for actions based upon “want of ordinary care or\nskill,” for actions for “negligent failure to diagnose or\ntreat,” and for actions based upon the failure of one with a\ncustodial duty to care for another to protect that other\nfrom “ ‘unreasonable risk of physical harm.’ ” See Cal. Civ.\nCode Ann. §§1714(a), 1714.8(a) (West 2009 and Supp.\n2012); Giraldo v. California Dept. of Corrections and Re-\nhabilitation, 168 Cal. App. 4th 231, 248, 85 Cal. Rptr. 3d\n371, 384 (2008) (quoting Haworth v. State, 60 Haw. 557,\n562, 592 P. 2d 820, 824 (1979)). California courts have\nspecifically applied this law to jailers, including private\noperators of prisons. Giraldo, supra, at 252, 85 Cal. Rptr.\n3d, at 387 (“[J]ailers owe prisoners a duty of care to pro-\ntect them from foreseeable harm”); see also Lawson v.\nSuperior Ct., 180 Cal. App. 4th 1372, 1389–1390, 1397,\n103 Cal. Rptr. 3d 834, 849–850, 855 (2010) (same).\n  Moreover, California’s tort law basically reflects general\nprinciples of tort law present, as far as we can tell, in the\nlaw of every State. See Restatement (Second) of Torts\n§§314A(4), 320 (1963–1964). We have found specific au-\nthority indicating that state law imposes general tort\nduties of reasonable care (including medical care) on pris-\non employees in every one of the eight States where pri-\nvately managed secure federal facilities are currently lo-\ncated.

R. 2d 353, §2[a]\n(Later Case Service and Supp. 2011) (same). But cf. Miss.\nCode. Ann. §11–46–9(1)(m) (Supp. 2011) (statute forbid-\nding such actions against State—though not private—\nemployees); N. Y. Correc. Law Ann. §§24 (West 2003), 121\n(2011 Cum. Supp.) (similar).\n   We note, as Pollard points out, that state tort law may\nsometimes prove less generous than would a Bivens ac-\ntion, say, by capping damages, see Cal. Civ. Code Ann.\n§3333.2(b) (West 1997), or by forbidding recovery for emo-\ntional suffering unconnected with physical harm, see 629\nF. 3d, at 864, or by imposing procedural obstacles, say,\ninitially requiring the use of expert administrative panels\nin medical malpractice cases, see, e.g., Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.,\nTit. 24, §2853, (Supp. 2010); Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 231,\n§60B (West 2010). But we cannot find in this fact suffi-\ncient basis to determine state law inadequate.\n   State-law remedies and a potential Bivens remedy need\nnot be perfectly congruent. See Bush, supra, at 388 (ad-\nministrative remedies adequate even though they “do not\nprovide complete relief ”). Indeed, federal law as well as\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstate law contains limitations. Prisoners bringing federal\nlawsuits, for example, ordinarily may not seek damages\nfor mental or emotional injury unconnected with physical\ninjury. See 42 U. S. C. §1997e(e). And Bivens actions,\neven if more generous to plaintiffs in some respects, may\nbe less generous in others. For example, to show an\nEighth Amendment violation a prisoner must typically\nshow that a defendant acted, not just negligently, but with\n“deliberate indifference.” Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S.\n825, 834 (1994). And a Bivens plaintiff, unlike a state\ntort law plaintiff, normally could not apply principles of\nrespondeat superior and thereby obtain recovery from a\ndefendant’s potentially deep-pocketed employer. See Ash-\ncroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662, 676 (2009).\n  Rather, in principle, the question is whether, in general,\nstate tort law remedies provide roughly similar incentives\nfor potential defendants to comply with the Eighth\nAmendment while also providing roughly similar compen-\nsation to victims of violations. The features of the two\nkinds of actions just mentioned suggest that, in practice,\nthe answer to this question is “yes.” And we have found\nnothing here to convince us to the contrary.\n  Fourth, Pollard argues that there “may” be similar\nkinds of Eighth Amendment claims that state tort law\ndoes not cover. But Pollard does not convincingly show\nthat there are such cases. Compare Brief for Respondent\nPollard 32 (questioning the availability of state tort reme-\ndies for “prisoners [who] suffer attacks by other inmates,\npreventable suicides, or the denial of heat, ventilation or\nmovement”), with Giraldo, supra, at 248–249, 85 Cal Rptr.\n3d, at 384–385 (courts have long held that prison officials\nmust protect, e.g., transgender inmate from foreseeable\nharm by other inmates), and Restatement (Second) of\nTorts §§314A(4), 320.\n  Regardless, we concede that we cannot prove a negative\nor be totally certain that the features of state tort law\n12                  MINNECI v. POLLARD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrelevant here will universally prove to be, or remain, as we\nhave described them. Nonetheless, we are certain enough\nabout the shape of present law as applied to the kind of\ncase before us to leave different cases and different state\nlaws to another day. That is to say, we can decide wheth-\ner to imply a Bivens action in a case where an Eighth\nAmendment claim or state law differs significantly from\nthose at issue here when and if such a case arises. The\npossibility of such a different future case does not provide\nsufficient grounds for reaching a different conclusion here.\n  For these reasons, where, as here, a federal prisoner\nseeks damages from privately employed personnel work-\ning at a privately operated federal prison, where the con-\nduct allegedly amounts to a violation of the Eighth\nAmendment, and where that conduct is of a kind that\ntypically falls within the scope of traditional state tort law\n(such as the conduct involving improper medical care at\nissue here), the prisoner must seek a remedy under state\ntort law. We cannot imply a Bivens remedy in such a case.\n  The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed.\n\n                                                  So ordered.\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

See Carlson v. Green,\n446 U. S. 14 (1980) (Bivens action); Estelle v. Gamble, 429\nU. S. 97 (1976) (42 U. S. C. §1983 action). For the reasons\nstated in the dissenting opinion I joined in Correctional\nServices Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U. S. 61, 75–83 (2001)\n(opinion of Stevens, J.), I would not deny the same charac-\nter of relief to Pollard, a prisoner placed by federal con-\ntract in a privately operated prison. Pollard may have\nsuffered “aggravated instances” of conduct state tort law\nforbids, ante, at 9 (opinion of the Court), but that same\naggravated conduct, when it is engaged in by official ac-\ntors,* also offends the Federal Constitution, see Estelle,\n429 U. S., at 105–106. Rather than remitting Pollard to\nthe “vagaries” of state tort law, Carlson, 446 U. S., at 23,\nI would hold his injuries, sustained while serving a feder-\nal sentence, “compensable according to uniform rules of\nfederal law,” Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics\nAgents, 403 U. S. 388, 409 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring\n——————\n  * The Ninth Circuit ruled that petitioners acted under color of federal\nlaw, Pollard v. The GEO Group, Inc., 629 F. 3d 843, 854 (2010), and\npetitioners did not seek this Court’s review of that determination, see\nBrief for Petitioners 37, n. 8.\n2                  MINNECI v. POLLARD\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nin judgment).\n   Indeed, there is stronger cause for providing a federal\nremedy in this case than there was in Malesko. There, the\nquestion presented was whether a Bivens action lies\nagainst a private corporation that manages a facility\nhousing federal prisoners. Malesko, 534 U. S., at 63.\nSuing a corporate employer, the majority observed in\nMalesko, would not serve to deter individual officers from\nconduct transgressing constitutional limitations on their\nauthority. Id., at 70–71. Individual deterrence, the Court\nreminded, was the consideration central to the Bivens\ndecision. Malesko, 534 U. S., at 70. Noting the availabil-\nity of state tort remedies, the majority in Malesko declined\nto “exten[d] Bivens beyond [that decision’s] core premise,”\ni.e., deterring individual officers. Malesko, 534 U. S., at\n71–73. Pollard’s case, in contrast, involves Bivens’ core\nconcern: His suit seeking damages directly from individu-\nal officers would have precisely the deterrent effect the\nCourt found absent in Malesko.\n   For the reasons stated, I would hold that relief poten-\ntially available under state tort law does not block Pol-\nlard’s recourse to a federal remedy for the affront to the\nConstitution he suffered. Accordingly, I would affirm the\nNinth Circuit’s judgment.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/620567/", "sha1": "cc20bd7812dafd51a21b16be45497d37d6f5752c", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2012-01-10T07:22:45"}
