Argued October 11, 2011—Decided January 10, 2012\nAlthough respondents’ credit card agreement required their claims to\n  be resolved by binding arbitration, they filed a lawsuit against peti-\n  tioner CompuCredit Corporation and a division of petitioner bank, al-\n  leging, inter alia, violations of the Credit Repair Organizations Act\n  (CROA). The Federal District Court denied the defendants’ motion to\n  compel arbitration, concluding that Congress intended CROA claims\n  to be nonarbitrable. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Because the CROA is silent on whether claims under the Act can\n proceed in an arbitrable forum, the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) re-\n quires the arbitration agreement to be enforced according to its\n terms. Pp. 2–10.\n    (a) Section 2 of the FAA establishes “a liberal federal policy favor-\n ing arbitration.” Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Con-\n str. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24. It requires that courts enforce arbitration\n agreements according to their terms. See Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.\n v. Byrd, 470 U. S. 213, 221. That is the case even when federal statu-\n tory claims are at issue, unless the FAA’s mandate has been “over-\n ridden by a contrary congressional command.” Shearson/American\n Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 226. Pp. 2–3.\n    (b) The CROA provides no such command. Respondents contend\n that the CROA’s disclosure provision—which requires credit repair\n organizations to provide consumers with a statement that includes\n the sentence “ ‘You have a right to sue a credit repair organization\n that violates the [Act],’ ” 15 U. S. C. §1679c(a)—gives consumers the\n right to bring an action in a court of law; and that, because the CROA\n prohibits the waiver of “any right of the consumer under this sub-\n chapter,” §1679f(a), the arbitration agreement’s waiver of the “right”\n to bring a court action cannot be enforced. Respondents’ premise is\n2               COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    flawed. The disclosure provision creates only a right for consumers to\n    receive a specific statement describing the consumer protections that\n    the law elsewhere provides, one of which is the right to enforce a\n    credit repair organization’s “liab[ility]” for “fail[ure] to comply with\n    [the Act].” §1679g(a). That provision does not override the FAA’s\n    mandate. Its mere contemplation of judicial enforcement does not\n    demonstrate that the Act provides consumers with a “right” to initial\n    judicial enforcement. Pp. 3–8.\n       (c) At the time of the CROA’s enactment in 1996, arbitration claus-\n    es such as the one at issue were no rarity in consumer contracts gen-\n    erally, or in financial services contracts in particular. Had Congress\n    meant to prohibit these very common provisions in the CROA, it\n    would have done so in a manner less obtuse than what respondents\n    suggest.

S. C. §1679 et seq., precludes enforce-\nment of an arbitration agreement in a lawsuit alleging\nviolations of that Act.\n                             I\n  Respondents are individuals who applied for and re-\nceived an Aspire Visa credit card marketed by petitioner\nCompuCredit Corporation and issued by Columbus Bank\nand Trust, now a division of petitioner Synovus Bank. In\ntheir applications they agreed to be bound by a provision\nwhich read: “Any claim, dispute or controversy (whether in\ncontract, tort, or otherwise) at any time arising from or\nrelating to your Account, any transferred balances or this\nAgreement (collectively, ‘Claims’), upon the election of you\nor us, will be resolved by binding arbitration . . . .” App.\n62.\n  In 2008, respondents filed a class-action complaint\nagainst CompuCredit and Columbus in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California,\nalleging, as relevant here, violations of the CROA. The\n2           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nclaims largely involved the defendants’ allegedly mislead-\ning representation that the credit card could be used to\nrebuild poor credit and their assessment of multiple fees\nupon opening of the accounts, which greatly reduced the\nadvertised credit limit.\n  The District Court denied the defendants’ motion to\ncompel arbitration of the claims, concluding that “Con-\ngress intended claims under the CROA to be non-\narbitrable.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2338893\"><a href=\"/opinion/2338893/greenwood-v-compucredit-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">617</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

S. ___ (2011).\n                               II\n  The background law governing the issue before us is the\nFederal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. §1 et seq., enact-\ned in 1925 as a response to judicial hostility to arbitration.\nAT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 4).

See\nalso, e.g., Concepcion, supra, at __ (slip op., at 4); Gilmer v.\nInterstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 25 (1991).

S. ____ (2012)                 3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nFAA’s mandate has been “overridden by a contrary con-\ngressional command.” Shearson/American Express Inc. v.\nMcMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 226 (1987). See also Mitsubishi\nMotors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S.\n614, 628 (1985). Respondents contend that the CROA\ncontains such a command.\n  That statute regulates the practices of credit repair\norganizations, defined as certain entities that offer ser-\nvices for the purpose of “(i) improving any consumer’s\ncredit record, credit history, or credit rating; or (ii) provid-\ning advice or assistance to any consumer with regard to\nany activity or service described in clause (i).”1 15 U. S. C.\n§1679a(3). In its principal substantive provisions, the\nCROA prohibits certain practices, §1679b, establishes\ncertain requirements for contracts with consumers,\n§1679d, and gives consumers a right to cancel, §1679e.\nEnforcement is achieved through the Act’s provision of a\nprivate cause of action for violation, §1679g, as well as\nthrough federal and state administrative enforcement,\n§1679h.\n                            III\n  Like the District Court and the Ninth Circuit, respond-\nents focus on the CROA’s disclosure and nonwaiver provi-\nsions. The former, which is reproduced in full in the\nAppendix, infra, sets forth a statement that the credit re-\npair organization must provide to the consumer before any\ncontract is executed. §1679c(a). One sentence of that\nrequired statement reads, “ ‘You have a right to sue a\ncredit repair organization that violates the Credit Repair\nOrganization Act.’ ” The Act’s nonwaiver provision states,\n\n——————\n  1 The District Court said that petitioners do not dispute that they\ncome within this definition.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 984, n. 2 (ND Cal.\n2009). The Ninth Circuit did not address that issue, see 615 F. 3d\n1204, 1207, n. 3 (2010), nor do we.\n4           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“Any waiver by any consumer of any protection provided\nby or any right of the consumer under this subchapter—\n(1) shall be treated as void; and (2) may not be enforced\nby any Federal or State court or any other person.”\n§1679f(a).\n    The Ninth Circuit adopted the following line of reason-\ning, urged upon us by respondents here: The disclosure\nprovision gives consumers the “right to sue,” which “clear-\nly involves the right to bring an action in a court of law.”\n615 F. 3d, at 1208. Because the nonwaiver provision\nprohibits the waiver of “any right of the consumer under\nthis subchapter,” the arbitration agreement—which\nwaived the right to bring an action in a court of law—\ncannot be enforced. Id., at 1214.\n    The flaw in this argument is its premise: that the disclo-\nsure provision provides consumers with a right to bring an\naction in a court of law. It does not. Rather, it imposes an\nobligation on credit repair organizations to supply con-\nsumers with a specific statement set forth (in quotation\nmarks) in the statute. The only consumer right it creates\nis the right to receive the statement, which is meant to\ndescribe the consumer protections that the law elsewhere\nprovides. The statement informs consumers, for instance,\nthat they can dispute the accuracy of information in their\ncredit file and that “ ‘[t]he credit bureau must then rein-\nvestigate and modify or remove inaccurate or incomplete\ninformation.’ ” 15 U. S. C. §1679c(a). That description is\nderived from §1681i(a), which sets out in great detail the\nprocedures to be followed by a credit bureau in the event\nof challenges to the accuracy of its information. Similarly,\nthe required statement informs consumers that they may\n“ ‘cancel your contract with any credit repair organization\nfor any reason within 3 business days from the date you\nsigned it’ ”—the right created and set forth in more detail\nin §1679e. And the “right to sue” language describes the\nconsumer’s right to enforce the credit repair organization’s\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n“liab[ility]” for “fail[ure] to comply with any provision of\nthis subchapter” provided for in §1679g(a).2 Thus, con-\ntrary to the dissent’s assertion, our interpretation does not\n“[r]educ[e] the required disclosure to insignificance,” post,\nat 6. The disclosure provision informs consumers of their\nright to enforce liability for any failure to conform to the\nstatute—information they might otherwise not possess. It\nis the dissent’s interpretation that effectively reduces a\nportion of the CROA to a nullity. Interpreting the “right\nto sue” language in §1679c(a) to “create” a right to sue in\ncourt not only renders it strikingly out of place in a section\nthat is otherwise devoted to giving the consumer notice of\nrights created elsewhere; it also renders the creation of the\n“right to sue” elsewhere superfluous.\n   Respondents suggest that the CROA’s civil-liability pro-\nvision, §1679g (set forth in full in the Appendix, infra),\ndemonstrates that the Act provides consumers with a\n“right” to bring an action in court. They cite the provi-\nsion’s repeated use of the terms “action,” “class action,”\nand “court”—terms that they say call to mind a judicial\nproceeding. These references cannot do the heavy lifting\nthat respondents assign them. It is utterly commonplace\nfor statutes that create civil causes of action to describe\nthe details of those causes of action, including the relief\navailable, in the context of a court suit. If the mere formu-\nlation of the cause of action in this standard fashion were\nsufficient to establish the “contrary congressional com-\n\n\n——————\n  2 Accordingly, when a consumer sues to enforce liability under the\nCROA, he does so under §1679g(a), not “in light of §1679c,” post, at 4\n(GINSBURG, J., dissenting). An action under the CROA need not refer\nto §1679c at all, unless it is based on the company’s failure to provide\nthe statement required under that section. Section 1679g(a) creates the\n“right” at issue and describes it in detail not contained in §1679c’s\nsummary. When determining the scope of that right, it is therefore\n§1679g(a)—and not §1679c—that must govern.\n6           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmand” overriding the FAA, McMahon, supra, at 226, valid\narbitration agreements covering federal causes of action\nwould be rare indeed. But that is not the law. In Gilmer\nwe enforced an arbitration agreement with respect to a\ncause of action created by the Age Discrimination in Em-\nployment Act of 1967 (ADEA) which read, in part: “Any\nperson aggrieved may bring a civil action in any court of\ncompetent jurisdiction for such legal or equitable relief as\nwill effectuate the purposes of this chapter.” 29 U. S. C.\n§626(c)(1).     In McMahon we enforced an arbitration\nagreement with respect to a cause of action created by a\nprovision of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organ-\nizations Act (RICO) which read, in part: “Any person\ninjured in his business or property by reason of a violation\nof section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any\nappropriate United States district court and shall recover\nthreefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit\n. . . .” 18 U. S. C. §1964(c). And in Mitsubishi Motors we\nenforced an arbitration agreement with respect to a cause\nof action created by a provision of the Clayton Act which\nread, in part: “[A]ny person who shall be injured in his\nbusiness or property by reason of anything forbidden in\nthe antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of\nthe United States . . . and shall recover threefold the\ndamages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including\na reasonable attorney’s fee.” 15 U. S. C. §15(a). Thus, we\nhave repeatedly recognized that contractually required\narbitration of claims satisfies the statutory prescription\nof civil liability in court. See Gilmer, 500 U. S., at 28;\nMcMahon, 482 U. S., at 240; Mitsubishi Motors, 473 U. S.,\nat 637. To be sure, none of the statutes described above\ncontained a nonwaiver provision, as the statute before us\ndoes. But if a cause-of-action provision mentioning judi-\ncial enforcement does not create a right to initial judicial\nenforcement, the waiver of initial judicial enforcement is\nnot the waiver of a “right of the consumer,” §1679f(a). It\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntakes a considerable stretch to regard the nonwaiver\nprovision as a “congressional command” that the FAA\nshall not apply.3\n   Moreover, if one believes that §1679g’s contemplation of\ncourt suit (combined with §1679f(a)) establishes a nonwaiv-\nable right to initial judicial enforcement, one must also\nbelieve that it establishes a nonwaivable right to initial\njudicial enforcement in any competent judicial tribunal,\nsince it contains no limitation. We think it clear, however,\nthat this mere “contemplation” of suit in any competent\ncourt does not guarantee suit in all competent courts,\ndisabling the parties from adopting a reasonable forum-\nselection clause. And just as the contemplated availability\nof all judicial forums may be reduced to a single forum by\ncontractual specification, so also can the contemplated\navailability of judicial action be limited to judicial action\ncompelling or reviewing initial arbitral adjudication. The\nparties remain free to specify such matters, so long as the\nguarantee of §1679g—the guarantee of the legal power to\nimpose liability—is preserved.\n   Respondents and the dissent maintain that if the CROA\ndoes not create a right to a judicial forum, then the disclo-\nsure provision effectively requires that credit repair organ-\nizations mislead consumers. We think not. The disclosure\nprovision is meant to describe the law to consumers in a\nmanner that is concise and comprehensible to the lay-\nman—which necessarily means that it will be imprecise.\nThe required statement says, for example, that the CROA\n“ ‘prohibits deceptive practices by credit repair organiza-\n\n——————\n  3 Gilmer noted that the ADEA had been amended after conclusion of\n\nthe arbitration agreement in that case to preclude waiver of “rights\nor claims that may arise after the date the waiver is executed.” 29\nU. S. C. §626(f)(1)(C). The Court said in dictum that this provision “did\nnot explicitly preclude arbitration or other nonjudicial resolution of\nclaims,” 500 U. S., at 29.\n8           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntions,’ ” 15 U. S. C. §1679c(a). This is in some respects an\noverstatement, and in some respects an understatement,\nof the “Prohibited practices” set forth in §1679b. It would\ninclude, for example, deception apart from “the offer or\nsale of the services of the credit repair organization,”\n§1679b(a)(4). Yet we would not hold, in order to prevent\nthe required statement from being “misleading,” that a\nconsumer has a right to be protected from deceptive prac-\ntices beyond those actually covered by §1679b. So also\nwith respect to the statement’s description of a “right to\nsue.” This is a colloquial method of communicating to\nconsumers that they have the legal right, enforceable in\ncourt, to recover damages from credit repair organizations\nthat violate the CROA. We think most consumers would\nunderstand it this way, without regard to whether the suit\nin court has to be preceded by an arbitration proceeding.\nLeaving that possibility out may be imprecise, but it is not\nmisleading—and certainly not so misleading as to de-\nmand, in order to avoid that result, reading the statute to\ncontain a guaranteed right it does not in fact contain.\n                              IV\n   At the time of the CROA’s enactment in 1996, arbitra-\ntion clauses in contracts of the type at issue here were no\nrarity. Quite the contrary, the early 1990’s saw the in-\ncreased use of arbitration clauses in consumer contracts\ngenerally, and in financial services contracts in particular.\nSee Ware, Arbitration and Unconscionability After Doc-\ntor’s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 31 Wake Forest L. Rev.\n1001, 1001, and n. 3 (1996); J. Shimabukuro, Congres-\nsional Research Service Report for Congress, The Federal\nArbitration Act: Background and Recent Developments 1\n(2002).\n   Had Congress meant to prohibit these very common\nprovisions in the CROA, it would have done so in a man-\nner less obtuse than what respondents suggest.

See, e.g., 7 U. S. C. §26(n)(2)\n(2006 ed., Supp. IV) (“No predispute arbitration agree-\nment shall be valid or enforceable, if the agreement re-\nquires arbitration of a dispute arising under this section”);\n15 U.

(“Notwithstanding any\nother provision of law, whenever a motor vehicle franchise\ncontract provides for the use of arbitration to resolve a\ncontroversy arising out of or relating to such contract,\narbitration may be used to settle such controversy only if\nafter such controversy arises all parties to such controver-\nsy consent in writing to use arbitration to settle such\ncontroversy”); cf. 12 U. S. C. §5518(b) (2006 ed., Supp. IV)\n(granting authority to the newly created Consumer Finan-\ncial Protection Bureau to regulate predispute arbitration\nagreements in contracts for consumer financial products\nor services).4 That Congress would have sought to achieve\nthe same result in the CROA through combination of the\nnonwaiver provision with the “right to sue” phrase in the\ndisclosure provision, and the references to “action” and\n\n——————\n   4 The dissent questions the relevance of these statutes, since they\n\npostdated the CROA and since this Court’s intervening decisions\ncompelling arbitration “increasingly alerted Congress to the utility of\ndrafting antiwaiver prescriptions with meticulous care.” Post, at 8.\nBut as the dissent implicitly recognizes, Congress had been “alerted”\nmuch before these post-CROA statutes were passed. The CROA itself\nfollowed a series of this Court’s seminal decisions compelling arbitra-\ntion, decisions which held that the FAA had established a “federal\npolicy favoring arbitration,” Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.,\n500 U. S. 20, 26 (1991), and that “[t]he burden is on the party opposing\narbitration . . . to show that Congress intended to preclude a waiver of\njudicial remedies,” Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482\nU. S. 220, 227 (1987). To the extent Congress is ever “stimulated” by\nthis Court’s decisions, post, at 8, there is no reason to think the Con-\ngress that enacted the CROA was any less stimulated than subsequent\nCongresses.\n10         COMPUCREDIT CORP. v.

S. C. §1679\net seq., are generally subject to valid arbitration agree-\nments unless Congress evinces a contrary intent in the\ntext, history, or purpose of the statute. See Gilmer v.\nInterstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 26 (1991). I\nagree with the Court that Congress has not shown that\nintent here. But for the reasons stated by the dissent, I\nfind this to be a much closer case than the majority opin-\nion suggests.\n   The Act creates a cause of action in its liability provi-\nsion, see §1679g(a), denominates the cause of action a\n“right to sue” in the mandatory disclosure statement,\n§1679c(a), and then provides that “right[s]” may not be\nwaived, §1679f(a). Those for whom Congress wrote the\nAct—lay readers “of limited economic means and . . .\ninexperienced in credit matters,” §1679(a)(2)—reasonably\nmay interpret the phrase “right to sue” as promising a\nright to sue in court. And it is plausible to think that\nCongress, aware of the impact of its words, intended such\na construction of the liability provision.\n   But while this interpretation of the Act is plausible, it is\nin my view no more compelling than the contrary con-\n2           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n             SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nstruction that petitioners urge. As the majority opinion\nnotes, the disclosure provision does not itself confer a\ncause of action, and the liability provision that does is\nmaterially indistinguishable from other statutes that we\nhave held not to preclude arbitration. In my mind this\nleaves the parties’ arguments in equipoise, and our prece-\ndents require that petitioners prevail in this circumstance.\nThis is because respondents, as the opponents of arbitra-\ntion, bear the burden of showing that Congress disallowed\narbitration of their claims, and because we resolve doubts\nin favor of arbitration. See id., at 26. Of course, if we\nhave misread Congress’ intent, then Congress can correct\nour error by amending the statute.\n   I add one more point. The majority opinion contrasts\nthe liability provision of the Act with other, more recently\nenacted statutes that expressly disallow arbitration. I do\nnot understand the majority opinion to hold that Congress\nmust speak so explicitly in order to convey its intent to\npreclude arbitration of statutory claims. We have never\nsaid as much, and on numerous occasions have held that\nproof of Congress’ intent may also be discovered in the\nhistory or purpose of the statute in question. See ibid. (“If\nsuch an intention exists, it will be discoverable in the text\nof the [statute], its legislative history, or an ‘inherent\nconflict’ between arbitration and the [statute’s] underlying\npurposes”); Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon,\n482 U. S. 220, 227 (1987) (“If Congress did intend to limit\nor prohibit waiver of a judicial forum for a particular\nclaim, such an intent ‘will be deducible from [the statute’s]\ntext or legislative history,’ or from an inherent conflict\nbetween arbitration and the statute’s underlying pur-\nposes” (quoting Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-\nPlymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 628 (1985); citation omit-\nted)).

S. C. §1679(a). Central\nto the legislation, Congress sought to arm consumers with\ninformation needed to make intelligent decisions about\npurchasing a repair organization’s services. To that end,\nCongress directed that, “before [execution of] any contract\n. . . between [a] consumer and [a] credit repair organiza­\ntion,” the organization must make certain disclosures.\nOne of the required disclosures reads:\n    “You have a right to sue a credit repair organization\n    that violates the [CROA]. This law prohibits decep­\n    tive practices by [such] organizations.” §1679c(a).\nThe Act’s civil-liability provision describes suits consumers\nmay bring in court: individual and class actions for dam­\nages (actual and punitive) and attorneys’ fees. A further\nprovision renders void any purported waiver of any protec­\ntion or right the Act grants to consumers.\n   The Court today holds that credit repair organizations\ncan escape suit by providing in their take-it-or-leave-it\ncontracts that arbitration will serve as the parties’ sole\n2           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ndispute-resolution mechanism. The “right to sue,” the\nCourt explains, merely connotes the vindication of legal\nrights, whether in court or before an arbitrator. That\nreading may be comprehensible to one trained to “think\nlike a lawyer.” But Congress enacted the CROA with\nvulnerable consumers in mind—consumers likely to read\nthe words “right to sue” to mean the right to litigate in\ncourt, not the obligation to submit disputes to binding\narbitration.\n   In accord with the Ninth Circuit, I would hold that\nCongress, in an Act meant to curb deceptive practices, did\nnot authorize credit repair organizations to make a false\nor misleading disclosure—telling consumers of a right they\ndo not, in fact, possess. If the Act affords consumers a\nnonwaivable right to sue in court, as I believe it does, a\ncredit repair organization cannot retract that right by\nmaking arbitration the consumer’s sole recourse.\n                              I\n   CompuCredit marketed a credit card to consumers with\nweak credit ratings. It did so through massive direct-mail\nand Internet solicitations, urging recipients to acquire a\ncard under the brand name Aspire Visa, and thereby\n“rebuild poor credit” and “improve [their] credit rating.”\nApp. 40, Complaint ¶11 (internal quotation marks omit­\nted). Plaintiffs, individuals who applied for and received\nCompuCredit’s card, sought redress for multiple violations\nof the CROA.\n   Their complaint alleged that CompuCredit’s promotion­\nal materials told potential customers that no deposit\nwould be required, and that cardholders would receive,\nupfront, a credit line of $300. In fact, plaintiffs asserted,\nthey were charged an initial finance fee of $29, a monthly\nfee of $6.50, and an annual fee of $150, assessed immedi­\nately against the $300 limit. In the aggregate, plaintiffs\ncalculated, fees charged the first year amounted to $257.\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nCompuCredit’s fee exactions did appear in the promotional\nmaterials: in small print, buried amidst other information,\nand removed from the clearer representation that no de-\nposit would be required. Id., at 40–41, Complaint ¶¶12–\n13. Far from improving their credit rating, plaintiffs\ncomplained, CompuCredit knew that its card, saddled\nwith these fees, “would not provide any meaningful assis­\ntance whatsoever with regard to rebuilding credit and\nimproving a credit rating.” Id., at 48, Complaint ¶41(b).\nFurthermore, plaintiffs stated, CompuCredit did not\nprovide them with the written disclosures of their rights\nrequired by the CROA. Id., at 42, Complaint ¶23.\n  Seeking damages for the alleged violations, along with\nattorneys’ fees, plaintiffs requested class certification. In\nthe District Court and Court of Appeals, they successfully\nresisted CompuCredit’s motion to compel arbitration\npursuant to a form contract that barred class proceedings.1\nThis Court, however, interprets the CROA to permit Com-\npuCredit’s demand that plaintiffs proceed, if at all, before\nan arbitrator.2 I read the governing statute differently.\n                            II\n  Three sections of the CROA, considered together, indi­\ncate Congress’ intention to preclude mandatory, creditor­\nimposed, arbitration of CROA claims.

Before entering into any\n——————\n  1 The contract signed by cardholders did not itself require arbitration.\nRather, it incorporated by reference an “enclosed insert” providing that\nall disputes would be resolved by arbitration at the discretion of Com­\npuCredit or the cardholder. App. 61–63.\n  2 CompuCredit’s form contract specified that arbitration was to occur\n\nunder the auspices of the National Arbitration Forum (NAF). In 2009,\nafter the Attorney General of Minnesota filed an action alleging that\nNAF had engaged in numerous violations of consumer-protection laws,\nNAF entered into a consent decree barring it from handling consumer\narbitrations. See Press Release by Lori Swanson, Attorney General of\nMinnesota (July 19, 2009).\n4             COMPUCREDIT CORP. v.

Congress dictated every word of the\nrequired notification. Credit repair organizations must\ntell consumers, in plain terms, how they may enforce their\nrights: “You have a right to sue a credit repair organiza­\ntion that violates the Credit Repair Organization Act.”\nIbid.\n   The “right to sue” refers to the claim for relief Congress\nafforded consumers in §1679g. “Any person” who violates\nanother’s rights under the CROA “shall be liable” for\nactual damages and attorneys’ fees, and may be liable for\npunitive damages as well. §1679g(a)(1)–(3). The Act sets\nout the factors “the court shall consider” in determining\nthe amount of punitive damages “the court may allow”\naggrieved consumers to recover, either individually or as a\nclass. §1679g(a)(2) and (b). The liability created here, in\n§1679g, is precisely what the consumer, in light of §1679c,\nmay sue to enforce.\n   The Act renders void and unenforceable “[a]ny waiver by\nany consumer of any protection provided by or any right of\nthe consumer under this subchapter.” §1679f (emphasis\nadded).3 The rights listed in §1679c(a) rendered nonwaiv-\nable by §1679f are the “right to sue” and the “right to\ncancel [a] contract . . . for any reason within 3 business\ndays from the date [the consumer] signed it.”4\n——————\n   3 Section 1679f(a), omitted from the Court’s statutory appendix, ante,\n\nat 11–14, provides in full:\n   “Any waiver by any consumer of any protection provided by or any\nright of the consumer under this subchapter—\n      “(1) shall be treated as void; and\n      “(2) may not be enforced by any Federal or State court or any other\n   person.”\n   4 Two provisions, although described by §1679c(a) as consumer\n\n“right[s],” are not rendered nonwaivable by §1679f because they are not\n“right[s] . . . under this subchapter.” Rather, the “right to dispute\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                    5\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   The question on which this case turns is what Congress\nmeant when it created a nonwaivable “right to sue.”\nRecall that Congress’ target audience in the CROA is not\ncomposed of lawyers and judges accustomed to nuanced\nreading of statutory texts, but laypersons who receive a\ndisclosure statement in the mail. Recall, as well, Con­\ngress’ findings that these individuals are often “of limited\neconomic means and . . . inexperienced in credit matters.”\n§1679(a)(2). Attributing little importance to this context,\nthe Court construes the right to sue as “the legal right,\nenforceable in court, to recover damages . . . without re­\ngard to whether the suit in court has to be preceded by an\narbitration proceeding.” Ante, at 8. I read Congress’\nwords without that sophisticated gloss: The right to sue,\nI would hold, means the right to litigate in court.\n   The Court is quite right in recognizing that consumers\n“have the legal right, enforceable in court, to recover dam­\nages from credit repair organizations that violate the\nCROA.” Ibid. But the Court is quite wrong, as I see it, to\ncharacterize as merely “imprecise,” ibid., Congress’ failure\nto include the caveat that access to court may be condi­\ntioned upon an anterior arbitration. The “right to sue”\nmay well be “a colloquial method of communicating to\nconsumers.” See ibid. But it surely is not colloquially\nunderstood by recipients of the required disclosures as the\nright, not to adjudicate in court, but only to seek, or defend\nagainst, court enforcement of an award rendered by the\narbitrator chosen by the credit repair organization. Few,\nif any, credit repair customers would equate the “right to\n——————\ninaccurate information in your credit report” and the “right to obtain a\ncopy of your credit report” referred to in §1679c(a) are rights conferred\nelsewhere in the U. S. Code. See §1681i(a), §1681j. Section 1679f also\nmakes nonwaivable the “protection[s] provided . . . under this subchap­\nter” (emphasis added); these protections include the prohibition of cer­\ntain business practices, see §1679b, and the provision, in writing, of\ncertain contractual terms and conditions, see §1679d.\n6           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nsue,” §1679c(a), with the extremely limited judicial review\ngiven to an arbitrator’s award, see, e.g., Hall Street Asso-\nciates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. 576, 586–589\n(2008).\n  The Court discounts the references to “action,” “class\naction,” and “court” in §1679g, the provision that “cre­\nate[s]” the consumers’ claim for relief. See ante, at 5.\nDespite similar statutory language, the Court observes, we\nhave enforced arbitration agreements to settle disputes\narising under other Acts of Congress. The CROA, how-\never, is distinguished by its disclosure requirements,\nprime among them, the obligation imposed on the credit\nrepair organization to inform potential customers they\n“have a right to sue” an organization that violates the Act.\n§1679c(a). Yet the Court refuses to read this language in\nconcert with §1679g, notwithstanding our frequent ac­\nknowledgment that “a statute is to be read as a whole,\nsince the meaning of statutory language . . . depends on\ncontext.” King v. St. Vincent’s Hospital, 502 U. S. 215, 221\n(1991) (citation omitted). As just explained, I believe\nCongress meant what an ordinary reader of the disclosure\nrequirement would likely comprehend: A credit repair\norganization that engages in deceptive practices may be\nsued in court.\n  Reducing the required disclosure to insignificance, see\nante, at 4–5, the Court’s construction of the CROA scarcely\nadvances the Act’s goals. Congress aimed to ensure pro­\nspective customers “are provided with the information\nnecessary to make an informed decision,” and also to\n“protect the public from unfair or deceptive advertising\nand business practices.” 15 U. S. C. §1679(b). The Court’s\ninterpretation, however, enables the very deception Con­\ngress sought to suppress. Today’s decision permits credit\nrepair organizations to deny consumers, through fine print\nin a contract, an important right whose disclosure is de­\ncreed in the U. S. Code.\n                      Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     7\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   This unfortunate result is not compelled by our prece­\ndents. The Court cites three decisions for the proposition,\nby now uncontroversial, that the mere existence of a stat-\nutory right of action does not preclude agreements to\narbitrate disputes. See ante, at 5–6 (citing Gilmer v.\nInterstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 28 (1991);\nShearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S.\n220, 240 (1987); and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler\nChrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 637 (1985)). As\nthe Court acknowledges, ante, at 6, none of the statutes at\nissue in those cases contained a nonwaiver clause analo­\ngous to §1679f. Yet the presence of such a clause would\nnot have affected the outcome, the Court maintains; a\nnonwaiver provision would not have precluded arbitration\nbecause the statutes conferred no underlying right to\nproceed in court.\n   Precisely the point: The CROA differs from the statutes\nwe have construed in the past in just that respect. The\nAct does not merely create a claim for relief. It designates\nthat claim as an action entailing a “right to sue”; man­\ndates that consumers be informed, prior to entering any\ncontract, of that right; and precludes the waiver of any\n“right” conferred by the Act. Neither Gilmer, McMahon,\nnor Mitsubishi construed a statute of a similar order.5\n                            III\n  The Court’s final point is that, elsewhere, Congress has\nspoken with particular clarity in guaranteeing a judicial\n——————\n   5 “[I]f one believes [the CROA] . . . establishes a nonwaivable right to\n\ninitial judicial enforcement,” the Court states, “one must also believe\nthat it establishes a nonwaivable right to initial judicial enforcement in\nany competent judicial tribunal.” Ante, at 7. In Sportin’ Life’s words,\n“it ain’t necessarily so.” While there is good reason to believe Congress\ncared about the institutional location of consumers’ suits under the\nCROA, there is no reason to think Congress sought to disturb the\npersonal jurisdiction and venue rules that determine in which court a\ncivil action may be brought.\n8             COMPUCREDIT CORP. v.

Notably,\nthese recent statutes were framed following a string of\nthis Court’s decisions compelling arbitration pursuant to\ncontractual stipulations.6 Our decisions have increasingly\nalerted Congress to the utility of drafting antiwaiver\nprescriptions with meticulous care. But the Congress that\ndrafted the CROA was not similarly stimulated, and we\ncannot fairly assess that enactment in the light of subse­\nquent legislative responses to developments unknown to\nthe CROA’s drafters.

S.\n304, 313 (1960) (“[T]he views of a subsequent Congress\nform a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an\nearlier one.”).\n   Beyond question, the Federal Arbitration Act, “standing\nalone,” favors the enforcement of arbitration agreements.\nMcMahon, 482 U. S., at 226. To depart from that rule,\nhowever, Congress need not employ “magic words.” See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 6. In determining whether the Arbitration\nAct’s general rule has been displaced by another statutory\nprescription, it remains our responsibility to examine\ncarefully “the text of the [statute], its legislative history,”\nand Congress’ “underlying purposes.” Gilmer, 500 U.

Argued October 11, 2011—Decided January 10, 2012\nAlthough respondents’ credit card agreement required their claims to\n  be resolved by binding arbitration, they filed a lawsuit against peti-\n  tioner CompuCredit Corporation and a division of petitioner bank, al-\n  leging, inter alia, violations of the Credit Repair Organizations Act\n  (CROA). The Federal District Court denied the defendants’ motion to\n  compel arbitration, concluding that Congress intended CROA claims\n  to be nonarbitrable. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Because the CROA is silent on whether claims under the Act can\n proceed in an arbitrable forum, the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) re-\n quires the arbitration agreement to be enforced according to its\n terms. Pp. 2–10.\n    (a) Section 2 of the FAA establishes “a liberal federal policy favor-\n ing arbitration.” Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Con-\n str. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24. It requires that courts enforce arbitration\n agreements according to their terms. See Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.\n v. Byrd, 470 U. S. 213, 221. That is the case even when federal statu-\n tory claims are at issue, unless the FAA’s mandate has been “over-\n ridden by a contrary congressional command.” Shearson/American\n Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 226. Pp. 2–3.\n    (b) The CROA provides no such command. Respondents contend\n that the CROA’s disclosure provision—which requires credit repair\n organizations to provide consumers with a statement that includes\n the sentence “ ‘You have a right to sue a credit repair organization\n that violates the [Act],’ ” 15 U. S. C. §1679c(a)—gives consumers the\n right to bring an action in a court of law; and that, because the CROA\n prohibits the waiver of “any right of the consumer under this sub-\n chapter,” §1679f(a), the arbitration agreement’s waiver of the “right”\n to bring a court action cannot be enforced. Respondents’ premise is\n2               COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    flawed. The disclosure provision creates only a right for consumers to\n    receive a specific statement describing the consumer protections that\n    the law elsewhere provides, one of which is the right to enforce a\n    credit repair organization’s “liab[ility]” for “fail[ure] to comply with\n    [the Act].” §1679g(a). That provision does not override the FAA’s\n    mandate. Its mere contemplation of judicial enforcement does not\n    demonstrate that the Act provides consumers with a “right” to initial\n    judicial enforcement. Pp. 3–8.\n       (c) At the time of the CROA’s enactment in 1996, arbitration claus-\n    es such as the one at issue were no rarity in consumer contracts gen-\n    erally, or in financial services contracts in particular. Had Congress\n    meant to prohibit these very common provisions in the CROA, it\n    would have done so in a manner less obtuse than what respondents\n    suggest.

S. C. §1679 et seq., precludes enforce-\nment of an arbitration agreement in a lawsuit alleging\nviolations of that Act.\n                             I\n  Respondents are individuals who applied for and re-\nceived an Aspire Visa credit card marketed by petitioner\nCompuCredit Corporation and issued by Columbus Bank\nand Trust, now a division of petitioner Synovus Bank. In\ntheir applications they agreed to be bound by a provision\nwhich read: “Any claim, dispute or controversy (whether in\ncontract, tort, or otherwise) at any time arising from or\nrelating to your Account, any transferred balances or this\nAgreement (collectively, ‘Claims’), upon the election of you\nor us, will be resolved by binding arbitration . . . .” App.\n62.\n  In 2008, respondents filed a class-action complaint\nagainst CompuCredit and Columbus in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California,\nalleging, as relevant here, violations of the CROA. The\n2           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nclaims largely involved the defendants’ allegedly mislead-\ning representation that the credit card could be used to\nrebuild poor credit and their assessment of multiple fees\nupon opening of the accounts, which greatly reduced the\nadvertised credit limit.\n  The District Court denied the defendants’ motion to\ncompel arbitration of the claims, concluding that “Con-\ngress intended claims under the CROA to be non-\narbitrable.” 617 F. Supp. 2d 980, 988 (2009). A panel of\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\naffirmed, Judge Tashima dissenting. 615 F. 3d 1204\n(2010). We granted certiorari, 563 U.

As relevant here, the FAA provides:\n       “A written provision in any maritime transaction or\n    a contract evidencing a transaction involving com-\n    merce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter\n    arising out of such contract or transaction . . . shall be\n    valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such\n    grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation\n    of any contract.” 9 U.

See\nalso, e.g., Concepcion, supra, at __ (slip op., at 4); Gilmer v.\nInterstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 25 (1991). It\nrequires courts to enforce agreements to arbitrate accord-\ning to their terms. See Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd,\n470 U. S. 213, 221 (1985).

Respondents contend that the CROA\ncontains such a command.\n  That statute regulates the practices of credit repair\norganizations, defined as certain entities that offer ser-\nvices for the purpose of “(i) improving any consumer’s\ncredit record, credit history, or credit rating; or (ii) provid-\ning advice or assistance to any consumer with regard to\nany activity or service described in clause (i).”1 15 U. S. C.\n§1679a(3). In its principal substantive provisions, the\nCROA prohibits certain practices, §1679b, establishes\ncertain requirements for contracts with consumers,\n§1679d, and gives consumers a right to cancel, §1679e.\nEnforcement is achieved through the Act’s provision of a\nprivate cause of action for violation, §1679g, as well as\nthrough federal and state administrative enforcement,\n§1679h.\n                            III\n  Like the District Court and the Ninth Circuit, respond-\nents focus on the CROA’s disclosure and nonwaiver provi-\nsions. The former, which is reproduced in full in the\nAppendix, infra, sets forth a statement that the credit re-\npair organization must provide to the consumer before any\ncontract is executed. §1679c(a). One sentence of that\nrequired statement reads, “ ‘You have a right to sue a\ncredit repair organization that violates the Credit Repair\nOrganization Act.’ ” The Act’s nonwaiver provision states,\n\n——————\n  1 The District Court said that petitioners do not dispute that they\ncome within this definition. See 617 F. Supp. 980, 984, n. 2 (ND Cal.\n2009). The Ninth Circuit did not address that issue, see 615 F. 3d\n1204, 1207, n. 3 (2010), nor do we.\n4           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“Any waiver by any consumer of any protection provided\nby or any right of the consumer under this subchapter—\n(1) shall be treated as void; and (2) may not be enforced\nby any Federal or State court or any other person.”\n§1679f(a).\n    The Ninth Circuit adopted the following line of reason-\ning, urged upon us by respondents here: The disclosure\nprovision gives consumers the “right to sue,” which “clear-\nly involves the right to bring an action in a court of law.”\n615 F. 3d, at 1208. Because the nonwaiver provision\nprohibits the waiver of “any right of the consumer under\nthis subchapter,” the arbitration agreement—which\nwaived the right to bring an action in a court of law—\ncannot be enforced. Id., at 1214.\n    The flaw in this argument is its premise: that the disclo-\nsure provision provides consumers with a right to bring an\naction in a court of law. It does not. Rather, it imposes an\nobligation on credit repair organizations to supply con-\nsumers with a specific statement set forth (in quotation\nmarks) in the statute. The only consumer right it creates\nis the right to receive the statement, which is meant to\ndescribe the consumer protections that the law elsewhere\nprovides. The statement informs consumers, for instance,\nthat they can dispute the accuracy of information in their\ncredit file and that “ ‘[t]he credit bureau must then rein-\nvestigate and modify or remove inaccurate or incomplete\ninformation.’ ” 15 U. S. C. §1679c(a). That description is\nderived from §1681i(a), which sets out in great detail the\nprocedures to be followed by a credit bureau in the event\nof challenges to the accuracy of its information. Similarly,\nthe required statement informs consumers that they may\n“ ‘cancel your contract with any credit repair organization\nfor any reason within 3 business days from the date you\nsigned it’ ”—the right created and set forth in more detail\nin §1679e. And the “right to sue” language describes the\nconsumer’s right to enforce the credit repair organization’s\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

The disclosure provision informs consumers of their\nright to enforce liability for any failure to conform to the\nstatute—information they might otherwise not possess. It\nis the dissent’s interpretation that effectively reduces a\nportion of the CROA to a nullity. Interpreting the “right\nto sue” language in §1679c(a) to “create” a right to sue in\ncourt not only renders it strikingly out of place in a section\nthat is otherwise devoted to giving the consumer notice of\nrights created elsewhere; it also renders the creation of the\n“right to sue” elsewhere superfluous.\n   Respondents suggest that the CROA’s civil-liability pro-\nvision, §1679g (set forth in full in the Appendix, infra),\ndemonstrates that the Act provides consumers with a\n“right” to bring an action in court. They cite the provi-\nsion’s repeated use of the terms “action,” “class action,”\nand “court”—terms that they say call to mind a judicial\nproceeding. These references cannot do the heavy lifting\nthat respondents assign them. It is utterly commonplace\nfor statutes that create civil causes of action to describe\nthe details of those causes of action, including the relief\navailable, in the context of a court suit. If the mere formu-\nlation of the cause of action in this standard fashion were\nsufficient to establish the “contrary congressional com-\n\n\n——————\n  2 Accordingly, when a consumer sues to enforce liability under the\nCROA, he does so under §1679g(a), not “in light of §1679c,” post, at 4\n(GINSBURG, J., dissenting). An action under the CROA need not refer\nto §1679c at all, unless it is based on the company’s failure to provide\nthe statement required under that section. Section 1679g(a) creates the\n“right” at issue and describes it in detail not contained in §1679c’s\nsummary. When determining the scope of that right, it is therefore\n§1679g(a)—and not §1679c—that must govern.\n6           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmand” overriding the FAA, McMahon, supra, at 226, valid\narbitration agreements covering federal causes of action\nwould be rare indeed. But that is not the law. In Gilmer\nwe enforced an arbitration agreement with respect to a\ncause of action created by the Age Discrimination in Em-\nployment Act of 1967 (ADEA) which read, in part: “Any\nperson aggrieved may bring a civil action in any court of\ncompetent jurisdiction for such legal or equitable relief as\nwill effectuate the purposes of this chapter.” 29 U. S. C.\n§626(c)(1).     In McMahon we enforced an arbitration\nagreement with respect to a cause of action created by a\nprovision of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organ-\nizations Act (RICO) which read, in part: “Any person\ninjured in his business or property by reason of a violation\nof section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any\nappropriate United States district court and shall recover\nthreefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit\n. . . .” 18 U. S. C. §1964(c). And in Mitsubishi Motors we\nenforced an arbitration agreement with respect to a cause\nof action created by a provision of the Clayton Act which\nread, in part: “[A]ny person who shall be injured in his\nbusiness or property by reason of anything forbidden in\nthe antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of\nthe United States . . . and shall recover threefold the\ndamages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including\na reasonable attorney’s fee.” 15 U. S. C. §15(a). Thus, we\nhave repeatedly recognized that contractually required\narbitration of claims satisfies the statutory prescription\nof civil liability in court. See Gilmer, 500 U. S., at 28;\nMcMahon, 482 U. S., at 240; Mitsubishi Motors, 473 U. S.,\nat 637. To be sure, none of the statutes described above\ncontained a nonwaiver provision, as the statute before us\ndoes. But if a cause-of-action provision mentioning judi-\ncial enforcement does not create a right to initial judicial\nenforcement, the waiver of initial judicial enforcement is\nnot the waiver of a “right of the consumer,” §1679f(a). It\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntakes a considerable stretch to regard the nonwaiver\nprovision as a “congressional command” that the FAA\nshall not apply.3\n   Moreover, if one believes that §1679g’s contemplation of\ncourt suit (combined with §1679f(a)) establishes a nonwaiv-\nable right to initial judicial enforcement, one must also\nbelieve that it establishes a nonwaivable right to initial\njudicial enforcement in any competent judicial tribunal,\nsince it contains no limitation. We think it clear, however,\nthat this mere “contemplation” of suit in any competent\ncourt does not guarantee suit in all competent courts,\ndisabling the parties from adopting a reasonable forum-\nselection clause. And just as the contemplated availability\nof all judicial forums may be reduced to a single forum by\ncontractual specification, so also can the contemplated\navailability of judicial action be limited to judicial action\ncompelling or reviewing initial arbitral adjudication. The\nparties remain free to specify such matters, so long as the\nguarantee of §1679g—the guarantee of the legal power to\nimpose liability—is preserved.\n   Respondents and the dissent maintain that if the CROA\ndoes not create a right to a judicial forum, then the disclo-\nsure provision effectively requires that credit repair organ-\nizations mislead consumers. We think not. The disclosure\nprovision is meant to describe the law to consumers in a\nmanner that is concise and comprehensible to the lay-\nman—which necessarily means that it will be imprecise.\nThe required statement says, for example, that the CROA\n“ ‘prohibits deceptive practices by credit repair organiza-\n\n——————\n  3 Gilmer noted that the ADEA had been amended after conclusion of\n\nthe arbitration agreement in that case to preclude waiver of “rights\nor claims that may arise after the date the waiver is executed.” 29\nU. S. C. §626(f)(1)(C). The Court said in dictum that this provision “did\nnot explicitly preclude arbitration or other nonjudicial resolution of\nclaims,” 500 U. S., at 29.\n8           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntions,’ ” 15 U. S. C. §1679c(a). This is in some respects an\noverstatement, and in some respects an understatement,\nof the “Prohibited practices” set forth in §1679b. It would\ninclude, for example, deception apart from “the offer or\nsale of the services of the credit repair organization,”\n§1679b(a)(4). Yet we would not hold, in order to prevent\nthe required statement from being “misleading,” that a\nconsumer has a right to be protected from deceptive prac-\ntices beyond those actually covered by §1679b. So also\nwith respect to the statement’s description of a “right to\nsue.” This is a colloquial method of communicating to\nconsumers that they have the legal right, enforceable in\ncourt, to recover damages from credit repair organizations\nthat violate the CROA. We think most consumers would\nunderstand it this way, without regard to whether the suit\nin court has to be preceded by an arbitration proceeding.\nLeaving that possibility out may be imprecise, but it is not\nmisleading—and certainly not so misleading as to de-\nmand, in order to avoid that result, reading the statute to\ncontain a guaranteed right it does not in fact contain.\n                              IV\n   At the time of the CROA’s enactment in 1996, arbitra-\ntion clauses in contracts of the type at issue here were no\nrarity. Quite the contrary, the early 1990’s saw the in-\ncreased use of arbitration clauses in consumer contracts\ngenerally, and in financial services contracts in particular.\nSee Ware, Arbitration and Unconscionability After Doc-\ntor’s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 31 Wake Forest L. Rev.\n1001, 1001, and n. 3 (1996); J. Shimabukuro, Congres-\nsional Research Service Report for Congress, The Federal\nArbitration Act: Background and Recent Developments 1\n(2002).\n   Had Congress meant to prohibit these very common\nprovisions in the CROA, it would have done so in a man-\nner less obtuse than what respondents suggest.

S. C. §1679\net seq., are generally subject to valid arbitration agree-\nments unless Congress evinces a contrary intent in the\ntext, history, or purpose of the statute. See Gilmer v.\nInterstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 26 (1991). I\nagree with the Court that Congress has not shown that\nintent here. But for the reasons stated by the dissent, I\nfind this to be a much closer case than the majority opin-\nion suggests.\n   The Act creates a cause of action in its liability provi-\nsion, see §1679g(a), denominates the cause of action a\n“right to sue” in the mandatory disclosure statement,\n§1679c(a), and then provides that “right[s]” may not be\nwaived, §1679f(a). Those for whom Congress wrote the\nAct—lay readers “of limited economic means and . . .\ninexperienced in credit matters,” §1679(a)(2)—reasonably\nmay interpret the phrase “right to sue” as promising a\nright to sue in court. And it is plausible to think that\nCongress, aware of the impact of its words, intended such\na construction of the liability provision.\n   But while this interpretation of the Act is plausible, it is\nin my view no more compelling than the contrary con-\n2           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n             SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nstruction that petitioners urge. As the majority opinion\nnotes, the disclosure provision does not itself confer a\ncause of action, and the liability provision that does is\nmaterially indistinguishable from other statutes that we\nhave held not to preclude arbitration. In my mind this\nleaves the parties’ arguments in equipoise, and our prece-\ndents require that petitioners prevail in this circumstance.\nThis is because respondents, as the opponents of arbitra-\ntion, bear the burden of showing that Congress disallowed\narbitration of their claims, and because we resolve doubts\nin favor of arbitration. See id., at 26. Of course, if we\nhave misread Congress’ intent, then Congress can correct\nour error by amending the statute.\n   I add one more point. The majority opinion contrasts\nthe liability provision of the Act with other, more recently\nenacted statutes that expressly disallow arbitration. I do\nnot understand the majority opinion to hold that Congress\nmust speak so explicitly in order to convey its intent to\npreclude arbitration of statutory claims. We have never\nsaid as much, and on numerous occasions have held that\nproof of Congress’ intent may also be discovered in the\nhistory or purpose of the statute in question. See ibid. (“If\nsuch an intention exists, it will be discoverable in the text\nof the [statute], its legislative history, or an ‘inherent\nconflict’ between arbitration and the [statute’s] underlying\npurposes”); Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon,\n482 U. S. 220, 227 (1987) (“If Congress did intend to limit\nor prohibit waiver of a judicial forum for a particular\nclaim, such an intent ‘will be deducible from [the statute’s]\ntext or legislative history,’ or from an inherent conflict\nbetween arbitration and the statute’s underlying pur-\nposes” (quoting Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-\nPlymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 628 (1985); citation omit-\nted)).

S. C. §1679(a). Central\nto the legislation, Congress sought to arm consumers with\ninformation needed to make intelligent decisions about\npurchasing a repair organization’s services. To that end,\nCongress directed that, “before [execution of] any contract\n. . . between [a] consumer and [a] credit repair organiza­\ntion,” the organization must make certain disclosures.\nOne of the required disclosures reads:\n    “You have a right to sue a credit repair organization\n    that violates the [CROA]. This law prohibits decep­\n    tive practices by [such] organizations.” §1679c(a).\nThe Act’s civil-liability provision describes suits consumers\nmay bring in court: individual and class actions for dam­\nages (actual and punitive) and attorneys’ fees. A further\nprovision renders void any purported waiver of any protec­\ntion or right the Act grants to consumers.\n   The Court today holds that credit repair organizations\ncan escape suit by providing in their take-it-or-leave-it\ncontracts that arbitration will serve as the parties’ sole\n2           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ndispute-resolution mechanism. The “right to sue,” the\nCourt explains, merely connotes the vindication of legal\nrights, whether in court or before an arbitrator. That\nreading may be comprehensible to one trained to “think\nlike a lawyer.” But Congress enacted the CROA with\nvulnerable consumers in mind—consumers likely to read\nthe words “right to sue” to mean the right to litigate in\ncourt, not the obligation to submit disputes to binding\narbitration.\n   In accord with the Ninth Circuit, I would hold that\nCongress, in an Act meant to curb deceptive practices, did\nnot authorize credit repair organizations to make a false\nor misleading disclosure—telling consumers of a right they\ndo not, in fact, possess. If the Act affords consumers a\nnonwaivable right to sue in court, as I believe it does, a\ncredit repair organization cannot retract that right by\nmaking arbitration the consumer’s sole recourse.\n                              I\n   CompuCredit marketed a credit card to consumers with\nweak credit ratings. It did so through massive direct-mail\nand Internet solicitations, urging recipients to acquire a\ncard under the brand name Aspire Visa, and thereby\n“rebuild poor credit” and “improve [their] credit rating.”\nApp. 40, Complaint ¶11 (internal quotation marks omit­\nted). Plaintiffs, individuals who applied for and received\nCompuCredit’s card, sought redress for multiple violations\nof the CROA.\n   Their complaint alleged that CompuCredit’s promotion­\nal materials told potential customers that no deposit\nwould be required, and that cardholders would receive,\nupfront, a credit line of $300. In fact, plaintiffs asserted,\nthey were charged an initial finance fee of $29, a monthly\nfee of $6.50, and an annual fee of $150, assessed immedi­\nately against the $300 limit. In the aggregate, plaintiffs\ncalculated, fees charged the first year amounted to $257.\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nCompuCredit’s fee exactions did appear in the promotional\nmaterials: in small print, buried amidst other information,\nand removed from the clearer representation that no de-\nposit would be required. Id., at 40–41, Complaint ¶¶12–\n13. Far from improving their credit rating, plaintiffs\ncomplained, CompuCredit knew that its card, saddled\nwith these fees, “would not provide any meaningful assis­\ntance whatsoever with regard to rebuilding credit and\nimproving a credit rating.” Id., at 48, Complaint ¶41(b).\nFurthermore, plaintiffs stated, CompuCredit did not\nprovide them with the written disclosures of their rights\nrequired by the CROA. Id., at 42, Complaint ¶23.\n  Seeking damages for the alleged violations, along with\nattorneys’ fees, plaintiffs requested class certification. In\nthe District Court and Court of Appeals, they successfully\nresisted CompuCredit’s motion to compel arbitration\npursuant to a form contract that barred class proceedings.1\nThis Court, however, interprets the CROA to permit Com-\npuCredit’s demand that plaintiffs proceed, if at all, before\nan arbitrator.2 I read the governing statute differently.\n                            II\n  Three sections of the CROA, considered together, indi­\ncate Congress’ intention to preclude mandatory, creditor­\nimposed, arbitration of CROA claims. See 15 U. S. C.\n§§1679c(a), 1679g, and 1679f. Before entering into any\n——————\n  1 The contract signed by cardholders did not itself require arbitration.\nRather, it incorporated by reference an “enclosed insert” providing that\nall disputes would be resolved by arbitration at the discretion of Com­\npuCredit or the cardholder. App. 61–63.\n  2 CompuCredit’s form contract specified that arbitration was to occur\n\nunder the auspices of the National Arbitration Forum (NAF). In 2009,\nafter the Attorney General of Minnesota filed an action alleging that\nNAF had engaged in numerous violations of consumer-protection laws,\nNAF entered into a consent decree barring it from handling consumer\narbitrations. See Press Release by Lori Swanson, Attorney General of\nMinnesota (July 19, 2009).\n4             COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nconsumer contract, credit repair organizations must give\npotential customers a written statement of rights they\npossess under that Act and related consumer-protection\nlaws. §1679c(a). Congress dictated every word of the\nrequired notification. Credit repair organizations must\ntell consumers, in plain terms, how they may enforce their\nrights: “You have a right to sue a credit repair organiza­\ntion that violates the Credit Repair Organization Act.”\nIbid.\n   The “right to sue” refers to the claim for relief Congress\nafforded consumers in §1679g. “Any person” who violates\nanother’s rights under the CROA “shall be liable” for\nactual damages and attorneys’ fees, and may be liable for\npunitive damages as well. §1679g(a)(1)–(3). The Act sets\nout the factors “the court shall consider” in determining\nthe amount of punitive damages “the court may allow”\naggrieved consumers to recover, either individually or as a\nclass. §1679g(a)(2) and (b). The liability created here, in\n§1679g, is precisely what the consumer, in light of §1679c,\nmay sue to enforce.\n   The Act renders void and unenforceable “[a]ny waiver by\nany consumer of any protection provided by or any right of\nthe consumer under this subchapter.” §1679f (emphasis\nadded).3 The rights listed in §1679c(a) rendered nonwaiv-\nable by §1679f are the “right to sue” and the “right to\ncancel [a] contract . . . for any reason within 3 business\ndays from the date [the consumer] signed it.”4\n——————\n   3 Section 1679f(a), omitted from the Court’s statutory appendix, ante,\n\nat 11–14, provides in full:\n   “Any waiver by any consumer of any protection provided by or any\nright of the consumer under this subchapter—\n      “(1) shall be treated as void; and\n      “(2) may not be enforced by any Federal or State court or any other\n   person.”\n   4 Two provisions, although described by §1679c(a) as consumer\n\n“right[s],” are not rendered nonwaivable by §1679f because they are not\n“right[s] . . . under this subchapter.” Rather, the “right to dispute\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                    5\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   The question on which this case turns is what Congress\nmeant when it created a nonwaivable “right to sue.”\nRecall that Congress’ target audience in the CROA is not\ncomposed of lawyers and judges accustomed to nuanced\nreading of statutory texts, but laypersons who receive a\ndisclosure statement in the mail. Recall, as well, Con­\ngress’ findings that these individuals are often “of limited\neconomic means and . . . inexperienced in credit matters.”\n§1679(a)(2). Attributing little importance to this context,\nthe Court construes the right to sue as “the legal right,\nenforceable in court, to recover damages . . . without re­\ngard to whether the suit in court has to be preceded by an\narbitration proceeding.” Ante, at 8. I read Congress’\nwords without that sophisticated gloss: The right to sue,\nI would hold, means the right to litigate in court.\n   The Court is quite right in recognizing that consumers\n“have the legal right, enforceable in court, to recover dam­\nages from credit repair organizations that violate the\nCROA.” Ibid. But the Court is quite wrong, as I see it, to\ncharacterize as merely “imprecise,” ibid., Congress’ failure\nto include the caveat that access to court may be condi­\ntioned upon an anterior arbitration. The “right to sue”\nmay well be “a colloquial method of communicating to\nconsumers.” See ibid. But it surely is not colloquially\nunderstood by recipients of the required disclosures as the\nright, not to adjudicate in court, but only to seek, or defend\nagainst, court enforcement of an award rendered by the\narbitrator chosen by the credit repair organization. Few,\nif any, credit repair customers would equate the “right to\n——————\ninaccurate information in your credit report” and the “right to obtain a\ncopy of your credit report” referred to in §1679c(a) are rights conferred\nelsewhere in the U. S. Code. See §1681i(a), §1681j. Section 1679f also\nmakes nonwaivable the “protection[s] provided . . . under this subchap­\nter” (emphasis added); these protections include the prohibition of cer­\ntain business practices, see §1679b, and the provision, in writing, of\ncertain contractual terms and conditions, see §1679d.\n6           COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nsue,” §1679c(a), with the extremely limited judicial review\ngiven to an arbitrator’s award, see, e.g., Hall Street Asso-\nciates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. 576, 586–589\n(2008).\n  The Court discounts the references to “action,” “class\naction,” and “court” in §1679g, the provision that “cre­\nate[s]” the consumers’ claim for relief. See ante, at 5.\nDespite similar statutory language, the Court observes, we\nhave enforced arbitration agreements to settle disputes\narising under other Acts of Congress. The CROA, how-\never, is distinguished by its disclosure requirements,\nprime among them, the obligation imposed on the credit\nrepair organization to inform potential customers they\n“have a right to sue” an organization that violates the Act.\n§1679c(a). Yet the Court refuses to read this language in\nconcert with §1679g, notwithstanding our frequent ac­\nknowledgment that “a statute is to be read as a whole,\nsince the meaning of statutory language . . . depends on\ncontext.” King v. St. Vincent’s Hospital, 502 U. S. 215, 221\n(1991) (citation omitted). As just explained, I believe\nCongress meant what an ordinary reader of the disclosure\nrequirement would likely comprehend: A credit repair\norganization that engages in deceptive practices may be\nsued in court.\n  Reducing the required disclosure to insignificance, see\nante, at 4–5, the Court’s construction of the CROA scarcely\nadvances the Act’s goals. Congress aimed to ensure pro­\nspective customers “are provided with the information\nnecessary to make an informed decision,” and also to\n“protect the public from unfair or deceptive advertising\nand business practices.” 15 U. S. C. §1679(b). The Court’s\ninterpretation, however, enables the very deception Con­\ngress sought to suppress. Today’s decision permits credit\nrepair organizations to deny consumers, through fine print\nin a contract, an important right whose disclosure is de­\ncreed in the U. S. Code.\n                      Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     7\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   This unfortunate result is not compelled by our prece­\ndents. The Court cites three decisions for the proposition,\nby now uncontroversial, that the mere existence of a stat-\nutory right of action does not preclude agreements to\narbitrate disputes. See ante, at 5–6 (citing Gilmer v.\nInterstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 28 (1991);\nShearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S.\n220, 240 (1987); and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler\nChrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 637 (1985)). As\nthe Court acknowledges, ante, at 6, none of the statutes at\nissue in those cases contained a nonwaiver clause analo­\ngous to §1679f. Yet the presence of such a clause would\nnot have affected the outcome, the Court maintains; a\nnonwaiver provision would not have precluded arbitration\nbecause the statutes conferred no underlying right to\nproceed in court.\n   Precisely the point: The CROA differs from the statutes\nwe have construed in the past in just that respect. The\nAct does not merely create a claim for relief. It designates\nthat claim as an action entailing a “right to sue”; man­\ndates that consumers be informed, prior to entering any\ncontract, of that right; and precludes the waiver of any\n“right” conferred by the Act. Neither Gilmer, McMahon,\nnor Mitsubishi construed a statute of a similar order.5\n                            III\n  The Court’s final point is that, elsewhere, Congress has\nspoken with particular clarity in guaranteeing a judicial\n——————\n   5 “[I]f one believes [the CROA] . . . establishes a nonwaivable right to\n\ninitial judicial enforcement,” the Court states, “one must also believe\nthat it establishes a nonwaivable right to initial judicial enforcement in\nany competent judicial tribunal.” Ante, at 7. In Sportin’ Life’s words,\n“it ain’t necessarily so.” While there is good reason to believe Congress\ncared about the institutional location of consumers’ suits under the\nCROA, there is no reason to think Congress sought to disturb the\npersonal jurisdiction and venue rules that determine in which court a\ncivil action may be brought.\n8             COMPUCREDIT CORP. v.

The two statutes the Court cites as exemplary post­\ndate the CROA’s enactment by 14 and 6 years, respective­\nly. (A third merely delegates regulatory authority over\ncertain arbitration agreements.) See ante, at 9. Notably,\nthese recent statutes were framed following a string of\nthis Court’s decisions compelling arbitration pursuant to\ncontractual stipulations.6 Our decisions have increasingly\nalerted Congress to the utility of drafting antiwaiver\nprescriptions with meticulous care. But the Congress that\ndrafted the CROA was not similarly stimulated, and we\ncannot fairly assess that enactment in the light of subse­\nquent legislative responses to developments unknown to\nthe CROA’s drafters. Cf. United States v. Price, 361 U. S.\n304, 313 (1960) (“[T]he views of a subsequent Congress\nform a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an\nearlier one.”).\n   Beyond question, the Federal Arbitration Act, “standing\nalone,” favors the enforcement of arbitration agreements.\nMcMahon, 482 U. S., at 226. To depart from that rule,\nhowever, Congress need not employ “magic words.” See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 6. In determining whether the Arbitration\nAct’s general rule has been displaced by another statutory\nprescription, it remains our responsibility to examine\ncarefully “the text of the [statute], its legislative history,”\nand Congress’ “underlying purposes.” Gilmer, 500 U. S.,\nat 26 (citing McMahon, 482 U. S., at 227). See also 14\nPenn Plaza LLC v. Pyett, 556 U.
