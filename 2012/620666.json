Argued November 8, 2011—Decided January 10, 2012\r\nPetitioner Juan Smith was convicted of first-degree murder based on\r\n  the testimony of a single eyewitness. During state postconviction re-\r\n  lief proceedings, Smith obtained police files containing statements by\r\n  the eyewitness contradicting his testimony. Smith argued that the\r\n  prosecution’s failure to disclose those statements violated Brady v.\r\n  Maryland, 373 U. S. 83. Brady held that due process bars a State\r\n  from withholding evidence that is favorable to the defense and mate-\r\n  rial to the defendant’s guilt or punishment. See id., at 87. The state\r\n  trial court rejected Smith’s Brady claim, and the Louisiana Court of\r\n  Appeal and Louisiana Supreme Court denied review.\r\nHeld: Brady requires that Smith’s conviction be reversed. The State\r\n does not dispute that the eyewitness’s statements were favorable to\r\n Smith and that those statements were not disclosed to Smith. Under\r\n Brady, evidence is material if there is a “reasonable probability that,\r\n had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would\r\n have been different.” Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. 449, 469–470. A “rea-\r\n sonable probability” means that the likelihood of a different result is\r\n great enough to “undermine[ ] confidence in the outcome of the trial.”\r\n Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 434. Evidence impeaching an eye-\r\n witness’s testimony may not be material if the State’s other evidence\r\n is strong enough to sustain confidence in the verdict. United States v.\r\n Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 112–113, and n. 21. Here, however, the eyewit-\r\n ness’s testimony was the only evidence linking Smith to the crime,\r\n and the eyewitness’s undisclosed statements contradicted his testi-\r\n mony. The eyewitness’s statements were plainly material, and the\r\n State’s failure to disclose those statements to the defense thus violat-\r\n ed Brady. Pp. 2–4.\r\n2                          SMITH v.

BURL CAIN, WARDEN\r\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE ORLEANS PARISH CRIMINAL\r\n             DISTRICT COURT OF LOUISIANA\r\n                               [January 10, 2012]\r\n\r\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\r\nCourt.\r\n   The State of Louisiana charged petitioner Juan Smith\r\nwith killing five people during an armed robbery. At\r\nSmith’s trial a single witness, Larry Boatner, linked Smith\r\nto the crime. Boatner testified that he was socializing at a\r\nfriend’s house when Smith and two other gunmen entered\r\nthe home, demanded money and drugs, and shortly there-\r\nafter began shooting, resulting in the death of five of\r\nBoatner’s friends. In court Boatner identified Smith as\r\nthe first gunman to come through the door. He claimed\r\nthat he had been face to face with Smith during the initial\r\nmoments of the robbery. No other witnesses and no physi-\r\ncal evidence implicated Smith in the crime.\r\n   The jury convicted Smith of five counts of first-degree\r\nmurder. The Louisiana Court of Appeal affirmed Smith’s\r\nconviction. State v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1740013\"><a href=\"/opinion/1740013/smith-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001). The\r\nLouisiana Supreme Court denied review, as did this\r\nCourt. 2001–2416 (La. 9/13/02), 824 So. 2d 1189; 537 U. S.\r\n1201 (2003).\r\n   Smith then sought postconviction relief in the state\r\ncourts. As part of his effort, Smith obtained files from the\r\n2                      SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\npolice investigation of his case, including those of the lead\r\ninvestigator, Detective John Ronquillo. Ronquillo’s notes\r\ncontain statements by Boatner that conflict with his tes-\r\ntimony identifying Smith as a perpetrator. The notes from\r\nthe night of the murder state that Boatner “could not . . .\r\nsupply a description of the perpetrators other then [sic]\r\nthey were black males.” App. 252–253. Ronquillo also\r\nmade a handwritten account of a conversation he had with\r\nBoatner five days after the crime, in which Boatner said\r\nhe “could not ID anyone because [he] couldn’t see faces”\r\nand “would not know them if [he] saw them.” Id., at 308.\r\nAnd Ronquillo’s typewritten report of that conversation\r\nstates that Boatner told Ronquillo he “could not identify\r\nany of the perpetrators of the murder.” Id., at 259–260.\r\n  Smith requested that his conviction be vacated, arguing,\r\ninter alia, that the prosecution’s failure to disclose Ron-\r\nquillo’s notes violated this Court’s decision in Brady v.\r\nMaryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). The state trial court re-\r\njected Smith’s Brady claim, and the Louisiana Court of\r\nAppeal and Louisiana Supreme Court denied review. We\r\ngranted certiorari, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), and now reverse.\r\n  Under Brady, the State violates a defendant’s right to\r\ndue process if it withholds evidence that is favorable to the\r\ndefense and material to the defendant’s guilt or punish-\r\nment. See 373 U. S., at 87. The State does not dispute\r\nthat Boatner’s statements in Ronquillo’s notes were fa-\r\nvorable to Smith and that those statements were not dis-\r\nclosed to him. The sole question before us is thus whether\r\nBoatner’s statements were material to the determination\r\nof Smith’s guilt. We have explained that “evidence is\r\n‘material’ within the meaning of Brady when there is a\r\nreasonable probability that, had the evidence been dis-\r\nclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been dif-\r\nferent.” Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. 449, 469–470 (2009). A\r\nreasonable probability does not mean that the defendant\r\n“would more likely than not have received a different\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nverdict with the evidence,” only that the likelihood of a\r\ndifferent result is great enough to “undermine[] confidence\r\nin the outcome of the trial.” Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S.\r\n419, 434 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n   We have observed that evidence impeaching an eyewit-\r\nness may not be material if the State’s other evidence is\r\nstrong enough to sustain confidence in the verdict. See\r\nUnited States v. Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 112–113, and n. 21\r\n(1976). That is not the case here. Boatner’s testimony\r\nwas the only evidence linking Smith to the crime. And\r\nBoatner’s undisclosed statements directly contradict his\r\ntestimony: Boatner told the jury that he had “[n]o doubt”\r\nthat Smith was the gunman he stood “face to face” with on\r\nthe night of the crime, but Ronquillo’s notes show Boatner\r\nsaying that he “could not ID anyone because [he] couldn’t\r\nsee faces” and “would not know them if [he] saw them.”\r\nApp. 196, 200, 308. Boatner’s undisclosed statements\r\nwere plainly material.\r\n   The State and the dissent advance various reasons why\r\nthe jury might have discounted Boatner’s undisclosed\r\nstatements. They stress, for example, that Boatner made\r\nother remarks on the night of the murder indicating that\r\nhe could identify the first gunman to enter the house, but\r\nnot the others. That merely leaves us to speculate about\r\nwhich of Boatner’s contradictory declarations the jury\r\nwould have believed. The State also contends that Boat-\r\nner’s statements made five days after the crime can be\r\nexplained by fear of retaliation. Smith responds that the\r\nrecord contains no evidence of any such fear. Again, the\r\nState’s argument offers a reason that the jury could have\r\ndisbelieved Boatner’s undisclosed statements, but gives us\r\nno confidence that it would have done so.\r\n   The police files that Smith obtained in state postconvic-\r\ntion proceedings contain other evidence that Smith con-\r\ntends is both favorable to him and material to the verdict.\r\nBecause we hold that Boatner’s undisclosed statements\r\n4                      SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nalone suffice to undermine confidence in Smith’s convic-\r\ntion, we have no need to consider his arguments that the\r\nother undisclosed evidence also requires reversal under\r\nBrady.\r\n   The judgment of the Orleans Parish Criminal District\r\nCourt of Louisiana is reversed, and the case is remanded\r\nfor further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\n                                            It is so ordered.\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

BURL CAIN, WARDEN\r\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE ORLEANS PARISH CRIMINAL\r\n             DISTRICT COURT OF LOUISIANA\r\n                      [January 10, 2012]\r\n\r\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.\r\n   The Court holds that Juan Smith is entitled to a new\r\nmurder trial because the State, in violation of Brady v.\r\nMaryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), did not disclose that the\r\neyewitness who identified Smith at trial stated shortly\r\nafter the murders that he could not identify any of the\r\nperpetrators. I respectfully dissent. In my view, Smith\r\nhas not shown a “reasonable probability” that the jury\r\nwould have been persuaded by the undisclosed evidence.\r\nUnited States v. Bagley, 473 U. S. 667, 682 (1985) (opinion\r\nof Blackmun, J.). That materiality determination must be\r\nmade “in the context of the entire record,” United States v.\r\nAgurs, 427 U. S. 97, 112 (1976), and “turns on the cumu-\r\nlative effect of all such evidence suppressed by the gov-\r\nernment,” Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 421 (1995).\r\nApplying these principles, I would affirm the judgment\r\nof the Louisiana trial court.\r\n                             I\r\n   The evidence presented at trial showed the following\r\nfacts. On March 1, 1995, Larry Boatner and several\r\nfriends gathered at Rebe Espadron’s home in New Or-\r\nleans. Boatner and others were drinking and talking in\r\nthe kitchen when Boatner heard the loud sound of a car\r\nwithout a muffler outside. As Boatner opened the kitchen’s\r\noutside door to investigate the noise, armed men pushed\r\n2                         SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                       THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ntheir way through the door, demanding drugs and money.\r\nTr. 153–154 (Dec. 5, 1995). The first man though the door\r\nput a gun in Boatner’s face and pushed him backwards.\r\nId., at 154–155. The men initially ordered Boatner and\r\nhis friends to the floor, but then ordered Boatner to stand\r\nup. At that time, the man who had been the first one\r\nthrough the door placed his gun under Boatner’s chin. Id.,\r\nat 156–157. When Boatner asked what the men wanted\r\nhim to do, the first man struck Boatner on the back of the\r\nhead with his gun, knocking Boatner back to the ground.\r\nId., at 157–158.\r\n   After hearing the commotion, Espadron emerged from a\r\nback bedroom, where she had been when the men entered\r\nthe house. As Espadron opened an inside door leading to\r\nthe kitchen, a man with a “covering” over his mouth point-\r\ned his gun at her face and ordered her to the floor. Id., at\r\n70–71. Disregarding his command, Espadron ran back\r\ntoward the bedroom, at which point the intruders opened\r\nfire. Id., at 71–72, 159.\r\n   When the shooting was over, four people lay dead. A\r\nfifth person, 17-year-old Shelita Russell, was mortally\r\nwounded and died later at the hospital. Of those original-\r\nly gathered in the house, the only survivors were Boatner,\r\nwho suffered a severe laceration to his head from the first\r\nman’s blow but was otherwise uninjured; Espadron, who\r\nescaped unharmed; and Reginald Harbor, who had re-\r\nmained in a back bedroom during the shooting. The police\r\nalso found a man named Phillip Young at the scene.\r\nYoung was alive but had suffered a gunshot wound to the\r\nhead. Because Boatner, Espadron, and Harbor had never\r\nseen Young before, the police surmised that Young had\r\nbeen one of the perpetrators.1\r\n——————\r\n  1 Young was indicted along with Smith for the murders, but he was\r\n\r\ndeemed incompetent to stand trial due to the brain damage he suffered\r\n                    Cite as: 565 U.

He testified at trial\r\nthat he encountered Boatner in the bathroom of Espa-\r\ndron’s home, where Boatner was attempting to care for the\r\nlaceration to his head. According to Narcisse, “Mr. Boat-\r\nner . . . had let inside the perpetrators and did see them.”\r\nId., at 21 (Dec. 4, 1995). Narcisse further explained that\r\nBoatner “had a description” of the person that he saw, the\r\ndetails of which Narcisse could not recall. Id., at 32.\r\n   Detective John Ronquillo, the lead investigator of the\r\nshootings, testified that Boatner had described the first\r\nman through the kitchen door as having a “short-type\r\nhaircut,” “a lot of golds in his teeth,” and “brown-ski[n].”2\r\nId., at 115 (Dec. 5, 1995). Ronquillo further testified that\r\nBoatner could describe no other perpetrator, but that\r\nBoatner had viewed the first man twice: once when the\r\nman initially came through the door and again when\r\nBoatner was ordered to stand up and the man held a gun\r\nto his chin. Id., at 117–118.\r\n   Ronquillo also testified that, during the four months\r\nfollowing the shootings, Boatner viewed 14 six-person\r\nphotograph arrays of potential suspects—only one of\r\nwhich contained a picture of Smith. Id., at 89–100. Three\r\nweeks after the crime, Ronquillo presented Boatner with\r\none of the arrays that did not include a picture of Smith.\r\nRonquillo recalled that Boatner noted that one man in the\r\narray had a “similar haircut” and “a similar expression on\r\nhis face” as the “gentleman that came into the house\r\ninitially with the gun that [Boatner] confronted,” but that\r\n\r\n——————\r\nas a result of being shot. 1 Record 49.\r\n  2 “Golds” are permanent or removable mouth jewelry, also referred to\r\n\r\nas “grills.” See Mouth Jewelry Wearers Love Gleam of the Grill, South\r\nFlorida Sun-Sentinel, Feb. 4, 2007, p. 5, 2007 WLNR 2187080. See also\r\nA. Westbrook, Hip Hoptionary 59 (2002) (defining a “grill” as a “teeth\r\ncover, usually made of gold and diamonds”).\r\n4                       SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nBoatner “was positive this wasn’t the individual.” Id., at\r\n97; see also 5 Record 828. A few months later, Ronquillo\r\npresented Boatner with the array that included a photo-\r\ngraph of Smith. Tr. 99–101 (Dec. 5, 1995). Ronquillo\r\ntestified that Boatner identified Smith “immediately,”\r\nstating, “ ‘This is it. I’ll never forget that face.’ ” Id., at\r\n100. Of the 84 photographs that Boatner viewed, Smith’s\r\nphotograph was the only one that Boatner identified.\r\n   Boatner identified Smith again when he was called to\r\nthe stand during Smith’s trial. Boatner testified that\r\nSmith’s face was the “[s]ame face,” id., at 174, and that\r\nSmith’s mouth was the “[s]ame mouth” “full of gold,” ibid.,\r\nas that of the first man who came through the kitchen\r\ndoor on the night of the attack. Boatner also testified that\r\nSmith’s hair at trial was “shaved on the sides” as it was\r\nduring the crime, but that “the top was a little bit lower”\r\nat the time of the murders. Id., at 165. Boatner explain-\r\ned that, during the attack, he had focused on the first\r\nman through the door—who was unmasked—but that he\r\n“didn’t notice” the faces of any of the other assailants or\r\nwhether they were masked. Id., at 154. On cross-\r\nexamination, Boatner testified that he had described the\r\nfirst man’s build, haircut, and gold teeth jewelry to the\r\npolice. Id., at 178.\r\n   Based on this evidence, the jury convicted Smith of first-\r\ndegree murder. Following the conclusion of direct review,\r\nSmith petitioned the trial court for postconviction relief.\r\nSmith argued that the State had failed to disclose various\r\npolice notes revealing favorable evidence material to\r\nSmith’s guilt. As relevant here, those items include pre-\r\ntrial statements by Boatner; statements by victim Shelita\r\nRussell and Espadron’s neighbor, Dale Mims; a pretrial\r\nstatement by firearms examiner Kenneth Leary; state-\r\nments by cosuspect Robert Trackling and Trackling’s\r\nfellow inmate, Eric Rogers; and a statement by cosuspect\r\nPhillip Young.

In my\r\nview, Smith has not established a reasonable probability\r\nthat the cumulative effect of this evidence would have\r\ncaused the jury to change its verdict.\r\n                             II\r\n\r\n                             A\r\n\r\n  Smith first identifies two undisclosed statements by\r\nBoatner, which the Court concludes are “plainly material.”\r\nAnte, at 3. First, a note by Ronquillo, documenting a\r\nconversation he had with Boatner at the scene, states that\r\nBoatner “could not . . . supply a description of the perpe-\r\ntrators other th[a]n they were black males.” 5 Record 809.\r\nSecond, a handwritten note by Ronquillo, documenting a\r\nphone conversation he had with Boatner on March 6, five\r\ndays after the murders, states that “Boatner . . . could not\r\nID anyone because couldn’t see faces . . . glanced at 1st\r\none—saw man—through door—can’t tell if had—faces\r\ncovered didn’t see anyone . . . Could not ID—would not\r\nknow them if—I saw them.” 13 id., at 2515. Ronquillo’s\r\ntyped summary of this note states that Boatner advised\r\nhim that he “could not identify any perpetrators of the\r\nmurder.” 5 id., at 817.\r\n  Smith is correct that these undisclosed statements could\r\nhave been used to impeach Boatner and Ronquillo during\r\ncross-examination. But the statements are not material\r\nfor purposes of Brady because they cannot “reasonably be\r\ntaken to put the whole case in such a different light as to\r\nundermine confidence in the verdict.” Kyles, 514 U. S., at\r\n435. When weighed against the substantial evidence that\r\nBoatner had opportunities to view the first perpetrator,\r\noffered consistent descriptions of him on multiple occa-\r\nsions, and even identified him as Smith, the undisclosed\r\n6                            SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nstatements do not warrant a new trial.\r\n  The evidence showed that, notwithstanding Ronquillo’s\r\non-scene note, Boatner offered a description of the perpe-\r\ntrator at the scene. Officer Narcisse testified that Boatner\r\nprovided him with a description of the perpetrator that\r\nBoatner saw. Narcisse’s testimony thus corroborated\r\nBoatner’s trial testimony that he saw the first man and\r\ndescribed him to police.3 Narcisse’s testimony also miti-\r\ngated the impeachment value of Ronquillo’s on-scene note\r\nby indicating that, although Boatner may have provided\r\nno detailed description to Ronquillo at the scene, Boatner\r\nhad described the first man to another officer.4\r\n  In any event, Ronquillo’s notes reflect that Boatner\r\nprovided a description of the first perpetrator at the police\r\nstation only a few hours after the shootings occurred. Tr.\r\n403 (Jan. 22, 2009). Boatner was asked if he could “de-\r\nscribe the subjects wh[o] shot the people in the house.” 5\r\nRecord 866. He responded: “I can tell you about one, the\r\none who put the pistol in my face, he was a black male\r\nwith a low cut, gold[s] in his mouth . . . about my complex-\r\nion, brown skinned.” Ibid. When asked, “[Y]ou say you\r\n\r\n\r\n——————\r\n    3 Ina pretrial hearing, Boatner testified that he “gave a description\r\nto the officer that came to the scene.” Tr. 24 (Oct. 27, 1995). Boatner\r\nresponded negatively when asked whether this officer was Detective\r\nRonquillo. Ibid. Boatner further testified that he told the officer that\r\nthe first man through the door was “heavy built with his hair with a\r\nfade, with a little small top with a lot of gold teeth in his mouth.” Ibid.\r\nThat testimony was consistent with the testimony that Boatner and\r\nOfficer Narcisse gave at trial.\r\n  4 Moreover, Boatner’s reticence toward Ronquillo at the scene of the\r\n\r\ncrime was entirely understandable. As Ronquillo noted at the postcon-\r\nviction hearing, “there were dead bodies everywhere,” and Boatner was\r\n“a little shook up.” Id., at 402–403 (Jan. 22, 2009). Similarly, Narcisse\r\ntestified at trial that Boatner, while “not as frantic” as Espadron, was a\r\n“bit emotional” when Narcisse encountered him at the scene. Id., at 34\r\n(Dec. 4, 1995).\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

In his brief, Smith\r\ncites this station house statement as an example of favor-\r\nable, undisclosed evidence. But this statement actually\r\ncorroborates Boatner’s trial testimony that he saw and\r\ndescribed the first perpetrator to police and that he did not\r\nget a good look at the other assailants. Moreover, the\r\ndescription Boatner provided was consistent with Smith’s\r\nappearance. The Court completely ignores Boatner’s\r\nstation house statement, but our cases instruct us to\r\nevaluate “the net effect of the evidence withheld by the\r\nState” in assessing materiality. See Kyles, supra, at 421–\r\n422.\r\n   The evidence not only shows that Boatner described the\r\nfirst perpetrator twice in the immediate aftermath of the\r\ncrime, but also that Boatner described him again three\r\nweeks later when he viewed a photograph array and elim-\r\ninated a similar-looking individual. The evidence before\r\nthe jury further indicated that, several months after the\r\ncrime, Boatner confidently identified Smith in an array,\r\nafter evincing a discriminating, careful eye over a 4-month\r\ninvestigative period. What is more, the reliability of\r\nBoatner’s out-of-court identification was extensively tested\r\nduring cross-examination at Smith’s trial. In particular,\r\nBoatner was asked whether the fact that he saw Smith’s\r\npicture in a newspaper article naming Smith as a suspect\r\nhad tainted his identification. Boatner did not waiver,\r\nresponding, “I picked out the person I seen come in that\r\nhouse that held a gun to my head and under my chin and\r\nthe person that was there when all my friends died.” Tr.\r\n190 (Dec. 5, 1995). That Boatner credibly rejected defense\r\ncounsel’s “suggestion” theory is supported by the fact that\r\nBoatner did not identify cosuspect Robert Trackling—\r\nwhose photograph was included in a separate array shown\r\nto Boatner on the same day that Boatner identified\r\n8                      SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nSmith—even though Trackling’s picture was next to\r\nSmith’s in the same newspaper article. 5 Record 833, 835.\r\n   When weighed against Boatner’s repeated and con-\r\nsistent descriptions and confident out-of-court and in-court\r\nidentifications, Boatner’s March 6 statement is also imma-\r\nterial. As an initial matter, Ronquillo’s note of his March\r\n6 conversation with Boatner contains an internal contra-\r\ndiction that undercuts its impeachment value. Although\r\nthe note states that Boatner “didn’t see anyone,” it also\r\nstates that Boatner “glanced at 1st one—saw man—\r\nthrough door.” 13 id., at 2515. The latter part is con-\r\nsistent with Boatner’s repeated statements that he only\r\nsaw the first man through the door. Moreover, the jury\r\nwould have evaluated any equivocation in Boatner’s\r\nstatement in light of the fact that he made it a mere five\r\ndays after a traumatic shooting, when the perpetrators\r\nwere still at large. The jury would have considered Boat-\r\nner’s trial testimony that, following the murders of his\r\nfriends, he began having nightmares, had difficulty sleep-\r\ning, quit his job, and began drinking heavily—so much so\r\nthat he checked into a hospital for substance abuse treat-\r\nment and grief counseling. Tr. 162–163, 170–171, 182\r\n(Dec. 5, 1995). Any impeachment value in the March 6\r\nnote would have been further mitigated by the fact that,\r\nas Ronquillo explained, “on the night of the incident\r\n[Boatner] said that he could [identify someone] and he\r\ngave a description that was very close to Mr. Smith’s\r\ndescription.” Id., at 401 (Jan. 22, 2009). And, following\r\nhis March 6 conversation with Ronquillo, Boatner viewed\r\nnumerous photograph arrays, described the first perpetra-\r\ntor, and ultimately identified him as Smith.\r\n   Of course, had the jury been presented with Ronquillo’s\r\nnotes of Boatner’s on-scene and March 6 statements, it\r\nmight have believed that Boatner could not identify any of\r\nthe perpetrators, but a possibility of a different verdict is\r\ninsufficient to establish a Brady violation.

S. 263, 291 (1999); see also Agurs, 427\r\nU. S., at 109–110 (“The mere possibility that an item of\r\nundisclosed information might have helped the defense, or\r\nmight have affected the outcome of the trial, does not es-\r\ntablish ‘materiality’ in the constitutional sense.” Rather,\r\na “petitioner’s burden is to establish a reasonable prob-\r\nability of a different result.” Strickler, supra, at 291.\r\n  Instead of requiring Smith to show a reasonable proba-\r\nbility that Boatner’s undisclosed statements would have\r\ncaused the jury to acquit, the Court improperly requires\r\nthe State to show that the jury would have given Boatner’s\r\nundisclosed statements no weight. See ante, at 3 (“[T]he\r\nState’s argument offers a reason that the jury could have\r\ndisbelieved Boatner’s undisclosed statements, but gives us\r\nno confidence that it would have done so”). But Smith\r\nis not entitled to a new trial simply because the jury\r\ncould have accorded some weight to Boatner’s undisclosed\r\nstatements. Smith’s burden is to show a reasonable prob-\r\nability that the jury would have accorded those statements\r\nsufficient weight to alter its verdict. In light of the record\r\nas a whole—which the Court declines to consider—Smith\r\nhas not carried that burden.\r\n                             B\r\n   Smith also argues that statements by Shelita Russell\r\nand Dale Mims documented in Ronquillo’s handwritten\r\nnotes could have been used to impeach Boatner’s identifi-\r\ncation of Smith because the statements indicate that\r\nthe perpetrators were masked. One undated note, which\r\ncontains several entries about various aspects of the inves-\r\ntigation, states, “female—face down against cabinets—\r\nconscious.” On the next line, the note continues, “said—in\r\nkitchen saw people barge in—one—black cloth across\r\nface—first one through door—[no further statement].” 13\r\nRecord 2556. When cross-examined during the postconvic-\r\ntion hearing about whether this note documented the\r\n10                          SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nstatement of Russell, Ronquillo confirmed that the note\r\nwas in his handwriting, but he testified that he never\r\ntalked to Russell, that he did not know when the note was\r\nmade, and that someone else could have relayed the in-\r\nformation to him. Tr. 415–418 (Jan. 22, 2009).5 I will\r\nassume arguendo that, had this note been disclosed, it\r\nwould have been admissible at Smith’s trial as a dying\r\ndeclaration of Russell.6 But the note would have had\r\nminimal impeachment value because, contrary to Smith’s\r\nassertions, it is ambiguous in light of the context in which\r\nthe statement was made. Officer Narcisse testified that\r\nRussell was conscious and able to talk, but that she was in\r\n“bad condition.” Id., at 20 (Dec. 4, 1995). Similarly, Reg-\r\ninald Harbor testified that, as Russell lay wounded, she\r\nwas “whining” and he “didn’t catch nothing [t]hat she\r\nsaid.” Id., at 205 (Dec. 5, 1995). And, although Smith\r\ncontends that the note says “exactly” that the “first person\r\nthrough the door had a black cloth across his face,” that\r\nis not how the note reads. Reply Brief for Petitioner 11\r\n(emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted)\r\n(hereinafter Reply Brief). The note first states that the\r\ndeclarant “saw people barge in,” then states “one—black\r\n\r\n\r\n——————\r\n   5 Russell did not make this statement to Officer Narcisse. He testi-\r\n\r\nfied that Russell “was not able to give us any information or any details\r\nof what had happened.” Id., at 20.\r\n   6 Louisiana law provides that “[a] statement made by a declarant\r\n\r\nwhile believing that his death was imminent, concerning the cause or\r\ncircumstances of what he believed to be his impending death[,]” is “not\r\nexcluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a wit-\r\nness.” La. Code Evid. Ann., Art. 804(B)(2) (West Supp. 2012). Assum-\r\ning this statement was actually Russell’s, it likely qualifies as a dying\r\ndeclaration. At trial, Boatner testified that, in the aftermath of the\r\nshooting, Russell told him, “Feel like I’m about to die.” Tr. 161 (Dec. 5,\r\n1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). Espadron also testified that\r\nRussell told her, “I’m gonna die,” and, “Don’t let me die.” Id., at 73–74\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

It is at\r\nleast as logical to read this statement as indicating only\r\nthat “one” of the “people” had a “black cloth across [his]\r\nface.” Russell, suffering from fatal wounds, said nothing\r\nfurther after “first one through door,” and it is impossible\r\nto know whether the “first one” was also the “one” with a\r\n“black cloth across [his] face.”\r\n  The second statement Smith identifies is that of Dale\r\nMims, who lived down the street from Espadron’s home\r\nand who heard the shooting. A note by Ronquillo states\r\nthat Mims saw four males fleeing Espadron’s home, “all\r\nwearing mask[s].” Id., at 2518. Like Russell’s purported\r\nstatement, this statement has minimal impeachment\r\nvalue in light of the record. Mims’ undisclosed statement\r\ndoes not address whether some or all of the perpetrators\r\nwere masked inside Espadron’s home.7 Moreover, had\r\nMims been called as a witness at trial, he presumably\r\nwould have testified, as he did at the postconviction hear-\r\ning, that he was “positive” that he only saw three perpe-\r\ntrators fleeing, and that, of those three, only two were\r\nmasked. Tr. 269, 271–273, 275 (Jan. 13, 2009).\r\n  Both Russell’s purported statement and Mims’ testimo-\r\nny are consistent with Boatner’s testimony that he did not\r\nknow whether any of the other perpetrators were masked,\r\nid., at 154 (Dec. 5, 1995), and with Officer Narcisse’s and\r\nEspadron’s testimony that the single perpetrator whom\r\nEspadron observed was wearing some sort of face cover-\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  7 Smith ridicules the “exceedingly peculiar” notion that the perpetra-\r\n\r\ntors would have remained unmasked inside Espadron’s home, only to\r\nmask themselves before leaving the scene. Reply Brief 12–13. But that\r\nnotion is eminently reasonable if the perpetrators intended to massacre\r\nthe witnesses who were inside the home—as they did—and were\r\nconcerned only with disguising themselves from neighbors outside who\r\nmight see or hear the burglary.\r\n12                     SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ning, id., at 30–31 (Dec. 4, 1995); id., at 71 (Dec. 5, 1995).\r\nThus, the totality of the evidence indicates that some, but\r\nnot all, of the perpetrators were masked, a conclusion that\r\nin no way undermines Boatner’s consistent assertions that\r\nthe only perpetrator he saw was unmasked.\r\n                             C\r\n   Smith also contends that Ronquillo’s undisclosed note\r\ndocumenting a pretrial statement by firearms examiner\r\nKenneth Leary is material for purposes of Brady. The\r\nnote states that “Leary advised Ronquillo that the 9MM\r\nammunition confiscated from [the scene of the murders]\r\nwas typed to have been fired from a[n] [Intratec], ‘Mac[-]\r\n11’ model type, semi automatic weapon.” 5 Record 831.\r\nAccording to Smith, this statement conflicts with Leary’s\r\ntrial testimony that the 9-millimeter ammunition found\r\nat the scene “was fired by one particular weapon, one 9-\r\nmillimeter handgun,” Tr. 132 (Dec. 5, 1995), because an\r\nIntratec or Mac-11 pistol is not a “handgun.” Smith fur-\r\nther argues that Leary’s pretrial statement could have\r\nbeen used to exculpate Smith, whose guilt the prosecution\r\nattempted to show by calling a pathologist to testify that\r\nShelita Russell’s wounds could have been inflicted by a\r\n9-millimeter “handgun,” id., at 39 (Dec. 4, 1995), and by\r\ncalling Boatner to testify that the gun Smith held under\r\nhis chin was a 9-millimeter silver “hand gun,” id., at 157\r\n(Dec. 5, 1995).\r\n   Contrary to Smith’s contentions, Leary’s pretrial state-\r\nment does not undermine the evidence presented at trial.\r\nLeary’s pretrial statement is consistent with his and\r\nBoatner’s trial testimony because an Intratec or Mac-11\r\npistol is a 9-millimeter handgun. Smith concedes that\r\nsuch a weapon uses 9-millimeter cartridges. Brief for\r\nPetitioner 48. Moreover, a “handgun” is simply “[a] fire-\r\narm that can be used with one hand,” American Heritage\r\nDictionary 819 (3d ed. 1992), and no one disputes that an\r\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                   13\r\n\r\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nIntratec or Mac-11 pistol can be used with one hand.\r\nSmith nonetheless insists that, “as a colloquial matter,\r\nmachine pistols of the Intratec or MAC-11 type would be\r\nconsidered automatic or semiautomatic weapons, rather\r\nthan handguns.” Reply Brief 18. But even assuming that\r\nSmith is correct, he fails to explain why Leary, a firearms\r\nexpert, would have been expected to use colloquial rather\r\nthan technical terminology.8\r\n  The record also makes clear that, when Boatner used\r\nthe term “handgun,” he did not understand it to exclude\r\nautomatic or semiautomatic machine pistols. In the im-\r\nmediate aftermath of the murders, as well as at trial,\r\nBoatner stated that a second perpetrator carried a “Ma[c]\r\n10” or “Tech Nine” “Uzi” type weapon, Tr. 159, 179 (Dec. 5,\r\n1995); 5 Record 809, 813, 866, and Boatner described that\r\nweapon as a “handgun,” id., at 809. Moreover, Boatner’s\r\npretrial description of the silver or chrome “handgun” that\r\nthe first man held was consistent with Leary’s undisclosed\r\nstatement that the gun that fired the 9-millimeter ammu-\r\nnition found at the scene was a semiautomatic weapon. In\r\nhis station house statement, Boatner described the first\r\nman’s weapon as a “big,” “automatic pistol.” Id., at 813,\r\n866. Because Leary’s pretrial statement is neither im-\r\npeaching nor exculpatory, Leary’s undisclosed statement\r\ncannot form the basis of a Brady violation. See Strickler,\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  8 Smith argues that Leary himself considered an “[Intratec] or ‘Mac[-]\r\n11’ ” model type to be different from a 9-millimeter handgun. Smith\r\nrelies on the fact that Leary’s pretrial statement indicated that the\r\nammunition recovered from the scene did not come from the handgun\r\nrecovered from Donielle Bannister, another suspect in the murders.\r\nId., at 18. Leary’s pretrial statement did not describe the handgun\r\nrecovered from Bannister as a 9-millimeter, contrary to Smith’s repre-\r\nsentation. More importantly, Leary’s statement suggests only that\r\nBannister’s handgun did not fire the 9-millimeter ammunition found at\r\nthe scene, not that Leary did not consider an “[Intratec] or ‘Mac[-]11’ ”\r\nmodel type to be a handgun.\r\n14                     SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n527 U. S., at 281–282 (To make out a Brady viola-\r\ntion, “[t]he evidence at issue must be favorable to the\r\naccused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is\r\nimpeaching”).\r\n                              D\r\n   Smith next points to purportedly exculpatory and ma-\r\nterial undisclosed pretrial statements made by Robert\r\nTrackling, a member of the “Cut Throat Posse” street gang\r\nwith which Smith was allegedly associated, and by Eric\r\nRogers, an inmate who was incarcerated with Trackling.\r\n5 Record 845. Police notes reflect that Eric Rogers gave an\r\ninterview to investigators on May 19, 1995, during which\r\nhe described a conversation that he had with Trackling\r\nwhile in prison. During that conversation, Trackling\r\ndescribed the murders at Espadron’s home and stated that\r\nhe had committed the crime along with “Fat, Buckle, and\r\na guy they call uh, Short Dog.” Id., at 841. According to\r\nRogers, Fat’s real name was “Darnell [Donielle] Banister,”\r\nBuckle’s real name was “Contez [Kintad] Phillips,” and\r\nShort Dog’s real name was “Juan.” Id., at 843–844.\r\n   Smith contends that Rogers’ interview was exculpatory\r\nin two respects. First, he points to the following comment\r\nby Rogers later during the interview: “They call Contez\r\nPhilip Buckle, they call Darnell Banister Fat, Short Dog\r\nthat’s what they call him, they call Robert Home.” Id., at\r\n845. Smith suggests that Rogers’ prior identification of\r\n“Short Dog” as “Juan [Smith]” was equivocal in light of his\r\nlater statement that “Short Dog” was a man named “Rob-\r\nert Home.” Reply Brief 21. Second, Smith asserts that\r\ndisclosure of Rogers’ interview would have led the defense\r\nand the jury to learn of Rogers’ allegation—made for the\r\nfirst time 10 years after Smith’s trial—that the police had\r\nasked him to implicate Juan Smith as “Short Dog,” Tr.\r\n284–285 (Jan. 13, 2009).\r\n   Neither argument is persuasive. If the jury had learned\r\n                    Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                  15\r\n\r\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nof Rogers’ statement, it would have heard information\r\ndirectly inculpating Smith as “Short Dog,” a perpetrator of\r\nthe shootings. Rogers’ physical description of “Short\r\nDog”—“he[’s] short[,] he[’s] got golds going across his\r\nmouth[,] and . . . he’s like built,” 5 Record 844–also corrob-\r\norated Boatner’s description of the first man through the\r\ndoor as having a “mouth full of gold” and a “heavy” build.\r\nFurthermore, Smith ignores other inculpatory information\r\ndocumented in Ronquillo’s notes of Rogers’ statement.\r\nThose notes reflect Trackling’s own interview with police\r\non June 1, 1995, in which Trackling identified Phillips,\r\nBannister, and “Juan Smith” as the perpetrators of the\r\nmurders at Espadron’s home. Id., at 832; see also id., at\r\n854–855. Trackling’s statement only strengthens the\r\ninculpatory nature of Rogers’ interview.\r\n  Further, the jury assuredly would not have believed\r\nSmith’s suggestion that Rogers identified “Short Dog” as a\r\nman named “Robert Home.” When this statement is taken\r\nin context, it appears that Rogers was describing the\r\nnickname—“Home”9—of Robert Trackling, the “Robert”\r\nwhom Rogers had repeatedly referenced throughout his\r\ninterview. See id., at 839–850. Indeed, Rogers’ phrase-\r\nology, “they call Robert Home,” was consistent with his pre-\r\nvious comments that “[t]hey call Contez Philip Buckle,”\r\nand “they call Darnell Banister Fat.” Id., at 845 (emphasis\r\nadded).

The prosecution also would have\r\ncalled Smith’s sister, Trinieze Smith, to testify that she\r\nbelieved her brother was known as “Short Dog,” as she did\r\nat the postconviction hearing. Tr. 371 (Jan. 14, 2009). On\r\nthis record, the undisclosed statements by Rogers and\r\nTrackling actually strengthen rather than weaken confi-\r\ndence in the jury’s guilty verdict.10\r\n                            E\r\n  Finally, Smith argues that an undisclosed handwritten\r\nnote by Ronquillo documenting a statement by Phillip\r\nYoung—the man found injured at the scene and suspected\r\nof having participated in the crime—is also material evi-\r\ndence warranting a new trial.

Smith argues that “there is no reason to believe that . . . Adams\r\nwould have contradicted Rogers—much less that the jury would have\r\nbelieved [him] if [he] did.” Reply Brief 21. But Smith offers no support\r\nfor his dubious assertion that Detective Adams would have admitted to\r\nframing Smith, or that, had the detective denied the allegation, the jury\r\nwould have believed Rogers—a convicted murderer who never ex-\r\nplained any motive Adams would have had to frame Smith—over the\r\ndetective.\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

He really couldn’t talk,\r\n[h]e mumbled. He could use his left hand, that was all.\r\nHe couldn’t walk or anything. He was fed through a tube\r\nby the people there. He was in really bad shape.” Id., at\r\n102–103. When asked whether Young was able to com-\r\nmunicate with him “at all,” Ronquillo responded, “No. I\r\ncouldn’t understand anything that he was saying.” Id., at\r\n103.\r\n  The undisclosed note from Ronquillo’s meeting with\r\nYoung reads as follows: “Short Dog/Bucko/Fats—No—\r\nDidn’t shoot me—No—Not with me when went to house—\r\nYes—one of people in house shot me—No—Not responsi-\r\nble—‘Posse’—Didn’t drive to house—‘Posse’—Yes—Knows\r\nnames of perps—Yes—Drove in car—Yes—girlfriend’s\r\ncar.” 13 Record 2568. Smith contends that this note is\r\nexculpatory in that it suggests that he was “not involved”\r\nin the shootings. Brief for Petitioner 43.\r\n  Young’s statement is only exculpatory if Smith concedes\r\n(as the statement asserts) that he is, in fact, “Short Dog”\r\nand a member of the “Cut Throat Posse.” Such a conces-\r\nsion would only have strengthened the inculpatory value\r\nof the statements by Rogers and Trackling indicating that\r\nSmith was the “Short Dog” who committed the murders at\r\nEspadron’s home. In any event, the exculpatory value of\r\nthe note is minimal for several other reasons. First, it is\r\nunclear whether Ronquillo’s note reflects a statement by\r\nYoung that the “Posse” was not responsible for shooting\r\nthe victims or a statement that the “Posse” was not re-\r\nsponsible for shooting Young. Further, the statement that\r\n“Short Dog” and others were not with Young when he went\r\nto the house is certainly not a clear statement that “Short\r\nDog” did not commit the murders, especially in light of\r\nevidence in the record that the assailants used two cars on\r\n18                         SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nthe night of the murders.11 Second, had the jury learned\r\nof Ronquillo’s note, it would have presumably heard Ron-\r\nquillo testify, as he did at the postconviction hearing, that\r\nhe was not even sure whether his note actually reflected\r\nstatements by Young, given that Young “couldn’t talk,”\r\nwas “jumbled,” could only “kind of move his head,” and\r\nsometimes would just sit and stare when Ronquillo asked\r\na question.12 Tr. 423–424 (Jan. 22, 2009). Accordingly,\r\nRonquillo explained, “I never had hide nor hair actually of\r\nwhat [Young] said.” Id., at 423.\r\n   The jury thus would have evaluated Ronquillo’s note, of\r\nunclear exculpatory value on its face, against a backdrop\r\nof doubt as to what, if anything, Young actually communi-\r\ncated. The jury also would have weighed this evidence\r\nagainst the strongly inculpatory nature of Boatner’s de-\r\nscriptions and identifications and Rogers’ and Trackling’s\r\nstatements, which corroborated Boatner’s identification.\r\nWhen all of the evidence is considered cumulatively, as it\r\nmust be, Smith has not shown a reasonable probability\r\nthat the jury would have reached a different verdict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  11 In his station house statement, Boatner explained that the loud car\r\nthat arrived at Espadron’s home was white. 5 Record 866. In Rogers’\r\ninterview with the police, Rogers said that Trackling escaped from\r\nEspadron’s home in a burgundy car. Id., at 842.\r\n   12 Smith also contends that the defense could have used the undis-\r\n\r\nclosed note to impeach Ronquillo’s trial testimony that Young was not\r\nable to communicate with him “at all.” That argument lacks merit.\r\nRonquillo’s trial testimony, when read in context, does not suggest that\r\nno communication occurred. Rather, Ronquillo made clear that he\r\nsimply “couldn’t understand anything that [Young] was saying.” See Tr.\r\n103 (Dec. 5, 1995) (emphasis added). That testimony is consistent with\r\nthe garbled nature of the note, and the note thus would have had little,\r\nif any, impeachment value.\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          19\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n                        *      *    *\r\n   The question presented here is not whether a prudent\r\nprosecutor should have disclosed the information that\r\nSmith identifies. Rather, the question is whether the cu-\r\nmulative effect of the disclosed and undisclosed evidence\r\nin Smith’s case “put[s] the whole case in such a different\r\nlight as to undermine confidence in the verdict.” Kyles,\r\n514 U. S., at 435. When, as in this case, the Court departs\r\nfrom its usual practice of declining to review alleged mis-\r\napplications of settled law to particular facts, id., at 456\r\n(SCALIA, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and KENNEDY and\r\nTHOMAS, JJ., dissenting), the Court should at least consid-\r\ner all of the facts. And, the Court certainly should not\r\ndecline to review all of the facts on the assumption that\r\nthe remainder of the record would only further support\r\nSmith’s claims, as the Court appears to have done here.\r\nAnte, at 3–4.\r\n   Such an assumption is incorrect. Here, much of the\r\nrecord evidence confirms that, from the night of the mur-\r\nders through trial, Boatner consistently described—with\r\none understandable exception—the first perpetrator\r\nthrough the door, that Boatner’s description matched\r\nSmith, and that Boatner made strong out-of-court and in-\r\ncourt identifications implicating Smith. Some of the un-\r\ndisclosed evidence cited by Smith is not favorable to him\r\nat all, either because it is of no impeachment or exculpa-\r\ntory value or because it actually inculpates him. Because\r\nwhat remains is evidence of such minimal impeachment\r\nand exculpatory value as to be immaterial in light of the\r\nwhole record, I must dissent from the Court’s holding that\r\nthe State violated Brady.\r\n</pre>", "id": 620666, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2012/01/10/Smith_v._Cain_1.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2011                                       1\r\n\r\n                                       Syllabus\r\n\r\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\r\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\r\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\r\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\r\n       See United States v.

Argued November 8, 2011—Decided January 10, 2012\r\nPetitioner Juan Smith was convicted of first-degree murder based on\r\n  the testimony of a single eyewitness. During state postconviction re-\r\n  lief proceedings, Smith obtained police files containing statements by\r\n  the eyewitness contradicting his testimony. Smith argued that the\r\n  prosecution’s failure to disclose those statements violated Brady v.\r\n  Maryland, 373 U. S. 83. Brady held that due process bars a State\r\n  from withholding evidence that is favorable to the defense and mate-\r\n  rial to the defendant’s guilt or punishment. See id., at 87. The state\r\n  trial court rejected Smith’s Brady claim, and the Louisiana Court of\r\n  Appeal and Louisiana Supreme Court denied review.\r\nHeld: Brady requires that Smith’s conviction be reversed. The State\r\n does not dispute that the eyewitness’s statements were favorable to\r\n Smith and that those statements were not disclosed to Smith. Under\r\n Brady, evidence is material if there is a “reasonable probability that,\r\n had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would\r\n have been different.” Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. 449, 469–470. A “rea-\r\n sonable probability” means that the likelihood of a different result is\r\n great enough to “undermine[ ] confidence in the outcome of the trial.”\r\n Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.

BURL CAIN, WARDEN\r\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE ORLEANS PARISH CRIMINAL\r\n             DISTRICT COURT OF LOUISIANA\r\n                               [January 10, 2012]\r\n\r\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\r\nCourt.\r\n   The State of Louisiana charged petitioner Juan Smith\r\nwith killing five people during an armed robbery. At\r\nSmith’s trial a single witness, Larry Boatner, linked Smith\r\nto the crime. Boatner testified that he was socializing at a\r\nfriend’s house when Smith and two other gunmen entered\r\nthe home, demanded money and drugs, and shortly there-\r\nafter began shooting, resulting in the death of five of\r\nBoatner’s friends. In court Boatner identified Smith as\r\nthe first gunman to come through the door. He claimed\r\nthat he had been face to face with Smith during the initial\r\nmoments of the robbery. No other witnesses and no physi-\r\ncal evidence implicated Smith in the crime.\r\n   The jury convicted Smith of five counts of first-degree\r\nmurder. The Louisiana Court of Appeal affirmed Smith’s\r\nconviction. State v. Smith, 797 So. 2d 193 (2001). The\r\nLouisiana Supreme Court denied review, as did this\r\nCourt. 2001–2416 (La. 9/13/02), 824 So. 2d 1189; 537 U. S.\r\n1201 (2003).\r\n   Smith then sought postconviction relief in the state\r\ncourts. As part of his effort, Smith obtained files from the\r\n2                      SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\npolice investigation of his case, including those of the lead\r\ninvestigator, Detective John Ronquillo. Ronquillo’s notes\r\ncontain statements by Boatner that conflict with his tes-\r\ntimony identifying Smith as a perpetrator. The notes from\r\nthe night of the murder state that Boatner “could not . . .\r\nsupply a description of the perpetrators other then [sic]\r\nthey were black males.” App. 252–253. Ronquillo also\r\nmade a handwritten account of a conversation he had with\r\nBoatner five days after the crime, in which Boatner said\r\nhe “could not ID anyone because [he] couldn’t see faces”\r\nand “would not know them if [he] saw them.” Id., at 308.\r\nAnd Ronquillo’s typewritten report of that conversation\r\nstates that Boatner told Ronquillo he “could not identify\r\nany of the perpetrators of the murder.” Id., at 259–260.\r\n  Smith requested that his conviction be vacated, arguing,\r\ninter alia, that the prosecution’s failure to disclose Ron-\r\nquillo’s notes violated this Court’s decision in Brady v.\r\nMaryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). The state trial court re-\r\njected Smith’s Brady claim, and the Louisiana Court of\r\nAppeal and Louisiana Supreme Court denied review. We\r\ngranted certiorari, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), and now reverse.\r\n  Under Brady, the State violates a defendant’s right to\r\ndue process if it withholds evidence that is favorable to the\r\ndefense and material to the defendant’s guilt or punish-\r\nment. See 373 U. S., at 87. The State does not dispute\r\nthat Boatner’s statements in Ronquillo’s notes were fa-\r\nvorable to Smith and that those statements were not dis-\r\nclosed to him. The sole question before us is thus whether\r\nBoatner’s statements were material to the determination\r\nof Smith’s guilt. We have explained that “evidence is\r\n‘material’ within the meaning of Brady when there is a\r\nreasonable probability that, had the evidence been dis-\r\nclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been dif-\r\nferent.” Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. 449, 469–470 (2009). A\r\nreasonable probability does not mean that the defendant\r\n“would more likely than not have received a different\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

Whitley, 514 U. S.\r\n419, 434 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n   We have observed that evidence impeaching an eyewit-\r\nness may not be material if the State’s other evidence is\r\nstrong enough to sustain confidence in the verdict. See\r\nUnited States v. Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 112–113, and n. 21\r\n(1976). That is not the case here. Boatner’s testimony\r\nwas the only evidence linking Smith to the crime. And\r\nBoatner’s undisclosed statements directly contradict his\r\ntestimony: Boatner told the jury that he had “[n]o doubt”\r\nthat Smith was the gunman he stood “face to face” with on\r\nthe night of the crime, but Ronquillo’s notes show Boatner\r\nsaying that he “could not ID anyone because [he] couldn’t\r\nsee faces” and “would not know them if [he] saw them.”\r\nApp. 196, 200, 308. Boatner’s undisclosed statements\r\nwere plainly material.\r\n   The State and the dissent advance various reasons why\r\nthe jury might have discounted Boatner’s undisclosed\r\nstatements. They stress, for example, that Boatner made\r\nother remarks on the night of the murder indicating that\r\nhe could identify the first gunman to enter the house, but\r\nnot the others. That merely leaves us to speculate about\r\nwhich of Boatner’s contradictory declarations the jury\r\nwould have believed. The State also contends that Boat-\r\nner’s statements made five days after the crime can be\r\nexplained by fear of retaliation. Smith responds that the\r\nrecord contains no evidence of any such fear. Again, the\r\nState’s argument offers a reason that the jury could have\r\ndisbelieved Boatner’s undisclosed statements, but gives us\r\nno confidence that it would have done so.\r\n   The police files that Smith obtained in state postconvic-\r\ntion proceedings contain other evidence that Smith con-\r\ntends is both favorable to him and material to the verdict.\r\nBecause we hold that Boatner’s undisclosed statements\r\n4                      SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nalone suffice to undermine confidence in Smith’s convic-\r\ntion, we have no need to consider his arguments that the\r\nother undisclosed evidence also requires reversal under\r\nBrady.\r\n   The judgment of the Orleans Parish Criminal District\r\nCourt of Louisiana is reversed, and the case is remanded\r\nfor further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\n                                            It is so ordered.\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

In my view, Smith\r\nhas not shown a “reasonable probability” that the jury\r\nwould have been persuaded by the undisclosed evidence.\r\nUnited States v. Bagley, 473 U. S. 667, 682 (1985) (opinion\r\nof Blackmun, J.). That materiality determination must be\r\nmade “in the context of the entire record,” United States v.\r\nAgurs, 427 U. S. 97, 112 (1976), and “turns on the cumu-\r\nlative effect of all such evidence suppressed by the gov-\r\nernment,” Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 421 (1995).\r\nApplying these principles, I would affirm the judgment\r\nof the Louisiana trial court.\r\n                             I\r\n   The evidence presented at trial showed the following\r\nfacts. On March 1, 1995, Larry Boatner and several\r\nfriends gathered at Rebe Espadron’s home in New Or-\r\nleans. Boatner and others were drinking and talking in\r\nthe kitchen when Boatner heard the loud sound of a car\r\nwithout a muffler outside. As Boatner opened the kitchen’s\r\noutside door to investigate the noise, armed men pushed\r\n2                         SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                       THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ntheir way through the door, demanding drugs and money.\r\nTr. 153–154 (Dec. 5, 1995). The first man though the door\r\nput a gun in Boatner’s face and pushed him backwards.\r\nId., at 154–155. The men initially ordered Boatner and\r\nhis friends to the floor, but then ordered Boatner to stand\r\nup. At that time, the man who had been the first one\r\nthrough the door placed his gun under Boatner’s chin. Id.,\r\nat 156–157. When Boatner asked what the men wanted\r\nhim to do, the first man struck Boatner on the back of the\r\nhead with his gun, knocking Boatner back to the ground.\r\nId., at 157–158.\r\n   After hearing the commotion, Espadron emerged from a\r\nback bedroom, where she had been when the men entered\r\nthe house. As Espadron opened an inside door leading to\r\nthe kitchen, a man with a “covering” over his mouth point-\r\ned his gun at her face and ordered her to the floor. Id., at\r\n70–71. Disregarding his command, Espadron ran back\r\ntoward the bedroom, at which point the intruders opened\r\nfire. Id., at 71–72, 159.\r\n   When the shooting was over, four people lay dead. A\r\nfifth person, 17-year-old Shelita Russell, was mortally\r\nwounded and died later at the hospital. Of those original-\r\nly gathered in the house, the only survivors were Boatner,\r\nwho suffered a severe laceration to his head from the first\r\nman’s blow but was otherwise uninjured; Espadron, who\r\nescaped unharmed; and Reginald Harbor, who had re-\r\nmained in a back bedroom during the shooting. The police\r\nalso found a man named Phillip Young at the scene.\r\nYoung was alive but had suffered a gunshot wound to the\r\nhead. Because Boatner, Espadron, and Harbor had never\r\nseen Young before, the police surmised that Young had\r\nbeen one of the perpetrators.1\r\n——————\r\n  1 Young was indicted along with Smith for the murders, but he was\r\n\r\ndeemed incompetent to stand trial due to the brain damage he suffered\r\n                    Cite as: 565 U.

He testified at trial\r\nthat he encountered Boatner in the bathroom of Espa-\r\ndron’s home, where Boatner was attempting to care for the\r\nlaceration to his head. According to Narcisse, “Mr. Boat-\r\nner . . . had let inside the perpetrators and did see them.”\r\nId., at 21 (Dec. 4, 1995). Narcisse further explained that\r\nBoatner “had a description” of the person that he saw, the\r\ndetails of which Narcisse could not recall. Id., at 32.\r\n   Detective John Ronquillo, the lead investigator of the\r\nshootings, testified that Boatner had described the first\r\nman through the kitchen door as having a “short-type\r\nhaircut,” “a lot of golds in his teeth,” and “brown-ski[n].”2\r\nId., at 115 (Dec. 5, 1995). Ronquillo further testified that\r\nBoatner could describe no other perpetrator, but that\r\nBoatner had viewed the first man twice: once when the\r\nman initially came through the door and again when\r\nBoatner was ordered to stand up and the man held a gun\r\nto his chin. Id., at 117–118.\r\n   Ronquillo also testified that, during the four months\r\nfollowing the shootings, Boatner viewed 14 six-person\r\nphotograph arrays of potential suspects—only one of\r\nwhich contained a picture of Smith. Id., at 89–100. Three\r\nweeks after the crime, Ronquillo presented Boatner with\r\none of the arrays that did not include a picture of Smith.\r\nRonquillo recalled that Boatner noted that one man in the\r\narray had a “similar haircut” and “a similar expression on\r\nhis face” as the “gentleman that came into the house\r\ninitially with the gun that [Boatner] confronted,” but that\r\n\r\n——————\r\nas a result of being shot. 1 Record 49.\r\n  2 “Golds” are permanent or removable mouth jewelry, also referred to\r\n\r\nas “grills.” See Mouth Jewelry Wearers Love Gleam of the Grill, South\r\nFlorida Sun-Sentinel, Feb. 4, 2007, p. 5, 2007 WLNR 2187080.

CAIN\r\n\r\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nBoatner “was positive this wasn’t the individual.” Id., at\r\n97; see also 5 Record 828. A few months later, Ronquillo\r\npresented Boatner with the array that included a photo-\r\ngraph of Smith. Tr. 99–101 (Dec. 5, 1995). Ronquillo\r\ntestified that Boatner identified Smith “immediately,”\r\nstating, “ ‘This is it. I’ll never forget that face.’ ” Id., at\r\n100. Of the 84 photographs that Boatner viewed, Smith’s\r\nphotograph was the only one that Boatner identified.\r\n   Boatner identified Smith again when he was called to\r\nthe stand during Smith’s trial. Boatner testified that\r\nSmith’s face was the “[s]ame face,” id., at 174, and that\r\nSmith’s mouth was the “[s]ame mouth” “full of gold,” ibid.,\r\nas that of the first man who came through the kitchen\r\ndoor on the night of the attack. Boatner also testified that\r\nSmith’s hair at trial was “shaved on the sides” as it was\r\nduring the crime, but that “the top was a little bit lower”\r\nat the time of the murders. Id., at 165. Boatner explain-\r\ned that, during the attack, he had focused on the first\r\nman through the door—who was unmasked—but that he\r\n“didn’t notice” the faces of any of the other assailants or\r\nwhether they were masked. Id., at 154. On cross-\r\nexamination, Boatner testified that he had described the\r\nfirst man’s build, haircut, and gold teeth jewelry to the\r\npolice. Id., at 178.\r\n   Based on this evidence, the jury convicted Smith of first-\r\ndegree murder. Following the conclusion of direct review,\r\nSmith petitioned the trial court for postconviction relief.\r\nSmith argued that the State had failed to disclose various\r\npolice notes revealing favorable evidence material to\r\nSmith’s guilt. As relevant here, those items include pre-\r\ntrial statements by Boatner; statements by victim Shelita\r\nRussell and Espadron’s neighbor, Dale Mims; a pretrial\r\nstatement by firearms examiner Kenneth Leary; state-\r\nments by cosuspect Robert Trackling and Trackling’s\r\nfellow inmate, Eric Rogers; and a statement by cosuspect\r\nPhillip Young.

In my\r\nview, Smith has not established a reasonable probability\r\nthat the cumulative effect of this evidence would have\r\ncaused the jury to change its verdict.\r\n                             II\r\n\r\n                             A\r\n\r\n  Smith first identifies two undisclosed statements by\r\nBoatner, which the Court concludes are “plainly material.”\r\nAnte, at 3. First, a note by Ronquillo, documenting a\r\nconversation he had with Boatner at the scene, states that\r\nBoatner “could not . . . supply a description of the perpe-\r\ntrators other th[a]n they were black males.” 5 Record 809.\r\nSecond, a handwritten note by Ronquillo, documenting a\r\nphone conversation he had with Boatner on March 6, five\r\ndays after the murders, states that “Boatner . . . could not\r\nID anyone because couldn’t see faces . . . glanced at 1st\r\none—saw man—through door—can’t tell if had—faces\r\ncovered didn’t see anyone . . . Could not ID—would not\r\nknow them if—I saw them.” 13 id., at 2515. Ronquillo’s\r\ntyped summary of this note states that Boatner advised\r\nhim that he “could not identify any perpetrators of the\r\nmurder.” 5 id., at 817.\r\n  Smith is correct that these undisclosed statements could\r\nhave been used to impeach Boatner and Ronquillo during\r\ncross-examination. But the statements are not material\r\nfor purposes of Brady because they cannot “reasonably be\r\ntaken to put the whole case in such a different light as to\r\nundermine confidence in the verdict.” Kyles, 514 U. S., at\r\n435. When weighed against the substantial evidence that\r\nBoatner had opportunities to view the first perpetrator,\r\noffered consistent descriptions of him on multiple occa-\r\nsions, and even identified him as Smith, the undisclosed\r\n6                            SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nstatements do not warrant a new trial.\r\n  The evidence showed that, notwithstanding Ronquillo’s\r\non-scene note, Boatner offered a description of the perpe-\r\ntrator at the scene. Officer Narcisse testified that Boatner\r\nprovided him with a description of the perpetrator that\r\nBoatner saw. Narcisse’s testimony thus corroborated\r\nBoatner’s trial testimony that he saw the first man and\r\ndescribed him to police.3 Narcisse’s testimony also miti-\r\ngated the impeachment value of Ronquillo’s on-scene note\r\nby indicating that, although Boatner may have provided\r\nno detailed description to Ronquillo at the scene, Boatner\r\nhad described the first man to another officer.4\r\n  In any event, Ronquillo’s notes reflect that Boatner\r\nprovided a description of the first perpetrator at the police\r\nstation only a few hours after the shootings occurred. Tr.\r\n403 (Jan. 22, 2009). Boatner was asked if he could “de-\r\nscribe the subjects wh[o] shot the people in the house.” 5\r\nRecord 866. He responded: “I can tell you about one, the\r\none who put the pistol in my face, he was a black male\r\nwith a low cut, gold[s] in his mouth . . . about my complex-\r\nion, brown skinned.” Ibid. When asked, “[Y]ou say you\r\n\r\n\r\n——————\r\n    3 Ina pretrial hearing, Boatner testified that he “gave a description\r\nto the officer that came to the scene.” Tr. 24 (Oct. 27, 1995). Boatner\r\nresponded negatively when asked whether this officer was Detective\r\nRonquillo. Ibid. Boatner further testified that he told the officer that\r\nthe first man through the door was “heavy built with his hair with a\r\nfade, with a little small top with a lot of gold teeth in his mouth.” Ibid.\r\nThat testimony was consistent with the testimony that Boatner and\r\nOfficer Narcisse gave at trial.\r\n  4 Moreover, Boatner’s reticence toward Ronquillo at the scene of the\r\n\r\ncrime was entirely understandable. As Ronquillo noted at the postcon-\r\nviction hearing, “there were dead bodies everywhere,” and Boatner was\r\n“a little shook up.” Id., at 402–403 (Jan. 22, 2009). Similarly, Narcisse\r\ntestified at trial that Boatner, while “not as frantic” as Espadron, was a\r\n“bit emotional” when Narcisse encountered him at the scene. Id., at 34\r\n(Dec. 4, 1995).\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ncan’t describe any of the other shooters besides the one\r\nwho put the gun in your face after you opened the door,”\r\nBoatner replied, “No, I can’t.” Ibid. In his brief, Smith\r\ncites this station house statement as an example of favor-\r\nable, undisclosed evidence. But this statement actually\r\ncorroborates Boatner’s trial testimony that he saw and\r\ndescribed the first perpetrator to police and that he did not\r\nget a good look at the other assailants. Moreover, the\r\ndescription Boatner provided was consistent with Smith’s\r\nappearance. The Court completely ignores Boatner’s\r\nstation house statement, but our cases instruct us to\r\nevaluate “the net effect of the evidence withheld by the\r\nState” in assessing materiality. See Kyles, supra, at 421–\r\n422.\r\n   The evidence not only shows that Boatner described the\r\nfirst perpetrator twice in the immediate aftermath of the\r\ncrime, but also that Boatner described him again three\r\nweeks later when he viewed a photograph array and elim-\r\ninated a similar-looking individual. The evidence before\r\nthe jury further indicated that, several months after the\r\ncrime, Boatner confidently identified Smith in an array,\r\nafter evincing a discriminating, careful eye over a 4-month\r\ninvestigative period. What is more, the reliability of\r\nBoatner’s out-of-court identification was extensively tested\r\nduring cross-examination at Smith’s trial. In particular,\r\nBoatner was asked whether the fact that he saw Smith’s\r\npicture in a newspaper article naming Smith as a suspect\r\nhad tainted his identification. Boatner did not waiver,\r\nresponding, “I picked out the person I seen come in that\r\nhouse that held a gun to my head and under my chin and\r\nthe person that was there when all my friends died.” Tr.\r\n190 (Dec. 5, 1995). That Boatner credibly rejected defense\r\ncounsel’s “suggestion” theory is supported by the fact that\r\nBoatner did not identify cosuspect Robert Trackling—\r\nwhose photograph was included in a separate array shown\r\nto Boatner on the same day that Boatner identified\r\n8                      SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nSmith—even though Trackling’s picture was next to\r\nSmith’s in the same newspaper article. 5 Record 833, 835.\r\n   When weighed against Boatner’s repeated and con-\r\nsistent descriptions and confident out-of-court and in-court\r\nidentifications, Boatner’s March 6 statement is also imma-\r\nterial. As an initial matter, Ronquillo’s note of his March\r\n6 conversation with Boatner contains an internal contra-\r\ndiction that undercuts its impeachment value. Although\r\nthe note states that Boatner “didn’t see anyone,” it also\r\nstates that Boatner “glanced at 1st one—saw man—\r\nthrough door.” 13 id., at 2515. The latter part is con-\r\nsistent with Boatner’s repeated statements that he only\r\nsaw the first man through the door. Moreover, the jury\r\nwould have evaluated any equivocation in Boatner’s\r\nstatement in light of the fact that he made it a mere five\r\ndays after a traumatic shooting, when the perpetrators\r\nwere still at large. The jury would have considered Boat-\r\nner’s trial testimony that, following the murders of his\r\nfriends, he began having nightmares, had difficulty sleep-\r\ning, quit his job, and began drinking heavily—so much so\r\nthat he checked into a hospital for substance abuse treat-\r\nment and grief counseling. Tr. 162–163, 170–171, 182\r\n(Dec. 5, 1995). Any impeachment value in the March 6\r\nnote would have been further mitigated by the fact that,\r\nas Ronquillo explained, “on the night of the incident\r\n[Boatner] said that he could [identify someone] and he\r\ngave a description that was very close to Mr. Smith’s\r\ndescription.” Id., at 401 (Jan. 22, 2009). And, following\r\nhis March 6 conversation with Ronquillo, Boatner viewed\r\nnumerous photograph arrays, described the first perpetra-\r\ntor, and ultimately identified him as Smith.\r\n   Of course, had the jury been presented with Ronquillo’s\r\nnotes of Boatner’s on-scene and March 6 statements, it\r\nmight have believed that Boatner could not identify any of\r\nthe perpetrators, but a possibility of a different verdict is\r\ninsufficient to establish a Brady violation. See Strickler v.\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\r\n\r\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nGreene, 527 U. S. 263, 291 (1999); see also Agurs, 427\r\nU. S., at 109–110 (“The mere possibility that an item of\r\nundisclosed information might have helped the defense, or\r\nmight have affected the outcome of the trial, does not es-\r\ntablish ‘materiality’ in the constitutional sense.” Rather,\r\na “petitioner’s burden is to establish a reasonable prob-\r\nability of a different result.” Strickler, supra, at 291.\r\n  Instead of requiring Smith to show a reasonable proba-\r\nbility that Boatner’s undisclosed statements would have\r\ncaused the jury to acquit, the Court improperly requires\r\nthe State to show that the jury would have given Boatner’s\r\nundisclosed statements no weight. See ante, at 3 (“[T]he\r\nState’s argument offers a reason that the jury could have\r\ndisbelieved Boatner’s undisclosed statements, but gives us\r\nno confidence that it would have done so”). But Smith\r\nis not entitled to a new trial simply because the jury\r\ncould have accorded some weight to Boatner’s undisclosed\r\nstatements. Smith’s burden is to show a reasonable prob-\r\nability that the jury would have accorded those statements\r\nsufficient weight to alter its verdict. In light of the record\r\nas a whole—which the Court declines to consider—Smith\r\nhas not carried that burden.\r\n                             B\r\n   Smith also argues that statements by Shelita Russell\r\nand Dale Mims documented in Ronquillo’s handwritten\r\nnotes could have been used to impeach Boatner’s identifi-\r\ncation of Smith because the statements indicate that\r\nthe perpetrators were masked. One undated note, which\r\ncontains several entries about various aspects of the inves-\r\ntigation, states, “female—face down against cabinets—\r\nconscious.” On the next line, the note continues, “said—in\r\nkitchen saw people barge in—one—black cloth across\r\nface—first one through door—[no further statement].” 13\r\nRecord 2556. When cross-examined during the postconvic-\r\ntion hearing about whether this note documented the\r\n10                          SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nstatement of Russell, Ronquillo confirmed that the note\r\nwas in his handwriting, but he testified that he never\r\ntalked to Russell, that he did not know when the note was\r\nmade, and that someone else could have relayed the in-\r\nformation to him. Tr. 415–418 (Jan. 22, 2009).5 I will\r\nassume arguendo that, had this note been disclosed, it\r\nwould have been admissible at Smith’s trial as a dying\r\ndeclaration of Russell.6 But the note would have had\r\nminimal impeachment value because, contrary to Smith’s\r\nassertions, it is ambiguous in light of the context in which\r\nthe statement was made. Officer Narcisse testified that\r\nRussell was conscious and able to talk, but that she was in\r\n“bad condition.” Id., at 20 (Dec. 4, 1995). Similarly, Reg-\r\ninald Harbor testified that, as Russell lay wounded, she\r\nwas “whining” and he “didn’t catch nothing [t]hat she\r\nsaid.” Id., at 205 (Dec. 5, 1995). And, although Smith\r\ncontends that the note says “exactly” that the “first person\r\nthrough the door had a black cloth across his face,” that\r\nis not how the note reads. Reply Brief for Petitioner 11\r\n(emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted)\r\n(hereinafter Reply Brief). The note first states that the\r\ndeclarant “saw people barge in,” then states “one—black\r\n\r\n\r\n——————\r\n   5 Russell did not make this statement to Officer Narcisse. He testi-\r\n\r\nfied that Russell “was not able to give us any information or any details\r\nof what had happened.” Id., at 20.\r\n   6 Louisiana law provides that “[a] statement made by a declarant\r\n\r\nwhile believing that his death was imminent, concerning the cause or\r\ncircumstances of what he believed to be his impending death[,]” is “not\r\nexcluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a wit-\r\nness.” La. Code Evid. Ann., Art. 804(B)(2) (West Supp. 2012). Assum-\r\ning this statement was actually Russell’s, it likely qualifies as a dying\r\ndeclaration. At trial, Boatner testified that, in the aftermath of the\r\nshooting, Russell told him, “Feel like I’m about to die.” Tr. 161 (Dec. 5,\r\n1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). Espadron also testified that\r\nRussell told her, “I’m gonna die,” and, “Don’t let me die.” Id., at 73–74\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                  11\r\n\r\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ncloth across face—first one through door—[no further\r\nstatement].” 13 Record 2556 (emphasis added). It is at\r\nleast as logical to read this statement as indicating only\r\nthat “one” of the “people” had a “black cloth across [his]\r\nface.” Russell, suffering from fatal wounds, said nothing\r\nfurther after “first one through door,” and it is impossible\r\nto know whether the “first one” was also the “one” with a\r\n“black cloth across [his] face.”\r\n  The second statement Smith identifies is that of Dale\r\nMims, who lived down the street from Espadron’s home\r\nand who heard the shooting. A note by Ronquillo states\r\nthat Mims saw four males fleeing Espadron’s home, “all\r\nwearing mask[s].” Id., at 2518. Like Russell’s purported\r\nstatement, this statement has minimal impeachment\r\nvalue in light of the record. Mims’ undisclosed statement\r\ndoes not address whether some or all of the perpetrators\r\nwere masked inside Espadron’s home.7 Moreover, had\r\nMims been called as a witness at trial, he presumably\r\nwould have testified, as he did at the postconviction hear-\r\ning, that he was “positive” that he only saw three perpe-\r\ntrators fleeing, and that, of those three, only two were\r\nmasked. Tr. 269, 271–273, 275 (Jan. 13, 2009).\r\n  Both Russell’s purported statement and Mims’ testimo-\r\nny are consistent with Boatner’s testimony that he did not\r\nknow whether any of the other perpetrators were masked,\r\nid., at 154 (Dec. 5, 1995), and with Officer Narcisse’s and\r\nEspadron’s testimony that the single perpetrator whom\r\nEspadron observed was wearing some sort of face cover-\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  7 Smith ridicules the “exceedingly peculiar” notion that the perpetra-\r\n\r\ntors would have remained unmasked inside Espadron’s home, only to\r\nmask themselves before leaving the scene. Reply Brief 12–13. But that\r\nnotion is eminently reasonable if the perpetrators intended to massacre\r\nthe witnesses who were inside the home—as they did—and were\r\nconcerned only with disguising themselves from neighbors outside who\r\nmight see or hear the burglary.\r\n12                     SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ning, id., at 30–31 (Dec. 4, 1995); id., at 71 (Dec. 5, 1995).\r\nThus, the totality of the evidence indicates that some, but\r\nnot all, of the perpetrators were masked, a conclusion that\r\nin no way undermines Boatner’s consistent assertions that\r\nthe only perpetrator he saw was unmasked.\r\n                             C\r\n   Smith also contends that Ronquillo’s undisclosed note\r\ndocumenting a pretrial statement by firearms examiner\r\nKenneth Leary is material for purposes of Brady. The\r\nnote states that “Leary advised Ronquillo that the 9MM\r\nammunition confiscated from [the scene of the murders]\r\nwas typed to have been fired from a[n] [Intratec], ‘Mac[-]\r\n11’ model type, semi automatic weapon.” 5 Record 831.\r\nAccording to Smith, this statement conflicts with Leary’s\r\ntrial testimony that the 9-millimeter ammunition found\r\nat the scene “was fired by one particular weapon, one 9-\r\nmillimeter handgun,” Tr. 132 (Dec. 5, 1995), because an\r\nIntratec or Mac-11 pistol is not a “handgun.” Smith fur-\r\nther argues that Leary’s pretrial statement could have\r\nbeen used to exculpate Smith, whose guilt the prosecution\r\nattempted to show by calling a pathologist to testify that\r\nShelita Russell’s wounds could have been inflicted by a\r\n9-millimeter “handgun,” id., at 39 (Dec. 4, 1995), and by\r\ncalling Boatner to testify that the gun Smith held under\r\nhis chin was a 9-millimeter silver “hand gun,” id., at 157\r\n(Dec. 5, 1995).\r\n   Contrary to Smith’s contentions, Leary’s pretrial state-\r\nment does not undermine the evidence presented at trial.\r\nLeary’s pretrial statement is consistent with his and\r\nBoatner’s trial testimony because an Intratec or Mac-11\r\npistol is a 9-millimeter handgun. Smith concedes that\r\nsuch a weapon uses 9-millimeter cartridges. Brief for\r\nPetitioner 48. Moreover, a “handgun” is simply “[a] fire-\r\narm that can be used with one hand,” American Heritage\r\nDictionary 819 (3d ed. 1992), and no one disputes that an\r\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

But even assuming that\r\nSmith is correct, he fails to explain why Leary, a firearms\r\nexpert, would have been expected to use colloquial rather\r\nthan technical terminology.8\r\n  The record also makes clear that, when Boatner used\r\nthe term “handgun,” he did not understand it to exclude\r\nautomatic or semiautomatic machine pistols. In the im-\r\nmediate aftermath of the murders, as well as at trial,\r\nBoatner stated that a second perpetrator carried a “Ma[c]\r\n10” or “Tech Nine” “Uzi” type weapon, Tr. 159, 179 (Dec. 5,\r\n1995); 5 Record 809, 813, 866, and Boatner described that\r\nweapon as a “handgun,” id., at 809. Moreover, Boatner’s\r\npretrial description of the silver or chrome “handgun” that\r\nthe first man held was consistent with Leary’s undisclosed\r\nstatement that the gun that fired the 9-millimeter ammu-\r\nnition found at the scene was a semiautomatic weapon. In\r\nhis station house statement, Boatner described the first\r\nman’s weapon as a “big,” “automatic pistol.” Id., at 813,\r\n866. Because Leary’s pretrial statement is neither im-\r\npeaching nor exculpatory, Leary’s undisclosed statement\r\ncannot form the basis of a Brady violation. See Strickler,\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  8 Smith argues that Leary himself considered an “[Intratec] or ‘Mac[-]\r\n11’ ” model type to be different from a 9-millimeter handgun. Smith\r\nrelies on the fact that Leary’s pretrial statement indicated that the\r\nammunition recovered from the scene did not come from the handgun\r\nrecovered from Donielle Bannister, another suspect in the murders.\r\nId., at 18. Leary’s pretrial statement did not describe the handgun\r\nrecovered from Bannister as a 9-millimeter, contrary to Smith’s repre-\r\nsentation. More importantly, Leary’s statement suggests only that\r\nBannister’s handgun did not fire the 9-millimeter ammunition found at\r\nthe scene, not that Leary did not consider an “[Intratec] or ‘Mac[-]11’ ”\r\nmodel type to be a handgun.\r\n14                     SMITH v.

S., at 281–282 (To make out a Brady viola-\r\ntion, “[t]he evidence at issue must be favorable to the\r\naccused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is\r\nimpeaching”).\r\n                              D\r\n   Smith next points to purportedly exculpatory and ma-\r\nterial undisclosed pretrial statements made by Robert\r\nTrackling, a member of the “Cut Throat Posse” street gang\r\nwith which Smith was allegedly associated, and by Eric\r\nRogers, an inmate who was incarcerated with Trackling.\r\n5 Record 845. Police notes reflect that Eric Rogers gave an\r\ninterview to investigators on May 19, 1995, during which\r\nhe described a conversation that he had with Trackling\r\nwhile in prison. During that conversation, Trackling\r\ndescribed the murders at Espadron’s home and stated that\r\nhe had committed the crime along with “Fat, Buckle, and\r\na guy they call uh, Short Dog.” Id., at 841. According to\r\nRogers, Fat’s real name was “Darnell [Donielle] Banister,”\r\nBuckle’s real name was “Contez [Kintad] Phillips,” and\r\nShort Dog’s real name was “Juan.” Id., at 843–844.\r\n   Smith contends that Rogers’ interview was exculpatory\r\nin two respects. First, he points to the following comment\r\nby Rogers later during the interview: “They call Contez\r\nPhilip Buckle, they call Darnell Banister Fat, Short Dog\r\nthat’s what they call him, they call Robert Home.” Id., at\r\n845. Smith suggests that Rogers’ prior identification of\r\n“Short Dog” as “Juan [Smith]” was equivocal in light of his\r\nlater statement that “Short Dog” was a man named “Rob-\r\nert Home.” Reply Brief 21. Second, Smith asserts that\r\ndisclosure of Rogers’ interview would have led the defense\r\nand the jury to learn of Rogers’ allegation—made for the\r\nfirst time 10 years after Smith’s trial—that the police had\r\nasked him to implicate Juan Smith as “Short Dog,” Tr.\r\n284–285 (Jan. 13, 2009).\r\n   Neither argument is persuasive. If the jury had learned\r\n                    Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                  15\r\n\r\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nof Rogers’ statement, it would have heard information\r\ndirectly inculpating Smith as “Short Dog,” a perpetrator of\r\nthe shootings. Rogers’ physical description of “Short\r\nDog”—“he[’s] short[,] he[’s] got golds going across his\r\nmouth[,] and . . . he’s like built,” 5 Record 844–also corrob-\r\norated Boatner’s description of the first man through the\r\ndoor as having a “mouth full of gold” and a “heavy” build.\r\nFurthermore, Smith ignores other inculpatory information\r\ndocumented in Ronquillo’s notes of Rogers’ statement.\r\nThose notes reflect Trackling’s own interview with police\r\non June 1, 1995, in which Trackling identified Phillips,\r\nBannister, and “Juan Smith” as the perpetrators of the\r\nmurders at Espadron’s home. Id., at 832; see also id., at\r\n854–855. Trackling’s statement only strengthens the\r\ninculpatory nature of Rogers’ interview.\r\n  Further, the jury assuredly would not have believed\r\nSmith’s suggestion that Rogers identified “Short Dog” as a\r\nman named “Robert Home.” When this statement is taken\r\nin context, it appears that Rogers was describing the\r\nnickname—“Home”9—of Robert Trackling, the “Robert”\r\nwhom Rogers had repeatedly referenced throughout his\r\ninterview. See id., at 839–850. Indeed, Rogers’ phrase-\r\nology, “they call Robert Home,” was consistent with his pre-\r\nvious comments that “[t]hey call Contez Philip Buckle,”\r\nand “they call Darnell Banister Fat.” Id., at 845 (emphasis\r\nadded).

Dalzell & T. Victor\r\neds. 2008) (defining “home” as “a very close male friend,” an abbrevia-\r\ntion of “Homeboy”).\r\n16                          SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nrecord material, I have not found, nor have the parties\r\ncited, a single reference to anyone named “Robert Home.”\r\n   If the jury had heard Rogers’ postconviction testimony\r\nthat police asked him to implicate Smith and that Track-\r\nling’s description of the murders did not include Smith, Tr.\r\n284–285 (Jan. 13, 2009), it would have weighed Rogers’\r\nallegation against Trackling’s own statement to the police\r\nthat Smith had participated in the murders at Espadron’s\r\nhome, 5 Record 832. The prosecution also would have\r\ncalled Smith’s sister, Trinieze Smith, to testify that she\r\nbelieved her brother was known as “Short Dog,” as she did\r\nat the postconviction hearing. Tr. 371 (Jan. 14, 2009). On\r\nthis record, the undisclosed statements by Rogers and\r\nTrackling actually strengthen rather than weaken confi-\r\ndence in the jury’s guilty verdict.10\r\n                            E\r\n  Finally, Smith argues that an undisclosed handwritten\r\nnote by Ronquillo documenting a statement by Phillip\r\nYoung—the man found injured at the scene and suspected\r\nof having participated in the crime—is also material evi-\r\ndence warranting a new trial. At trial, Ronquillo testified\r\nthat he met with Young while Young was hospitalized as a\r\nresult of permanent brain damage suffered in the shoot-\r\n\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  10 Detective Byron Adams, who took Rogers’ statement, did not testify\r\n\r\nat the postconviction hearing because he had died in the meantime. He\r\nthus had no opportunity to address Rogers’ recantation or his newly\r\nminted allegation that Detective Adams asked Rogers to implicate\r\nSmith. Smith argues that “there is no reason to believe that . . . Adams\r\nwould have contradicted Rogers—much less that the jury would have\r\nbelieved [him] if [he] did.” Reply Brief 21. But Smith offers no support\r\nfor his dubious assertion that Detective Adams would have admitted to\r\nframing Smith, or that, had the detective denied the allegation, the jury\r\nwould have believed Rogers—a convicted murderer who never ex-\r\nplained any motive Adams would have had to frame Smith—over the\r\ndetective.\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          17\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nings. Id., at 102 (Dec. 5, 1995). According to Ronquillo,\r\nYoung “was strapped to a chair. He really couldn’t talk,\r\n[h]e mumbled. He could use his left hand, that was all.\r\nHe couldn’t walk or anything. He was fed through a tube\r\nby the people there. He was in really bad shape.” Id., at\r\n102–103. When asked whether Young was able to com-\r\nmunicate with him “at all,” Ronquillo responded, “No. I\r\ncouldn’t understand anything that he was saying.” Id., at\r\n103.\r\n  The undisclosed note from Ronquillo’s meeting with\r\nYoung reads as follows: “Short Dog/Bucko/Fats—No—\r\nDidn’t shoot me—No—Not with me when went to house—\r\nYes—one of people in house shot me—No—Not responsi-\r\nble—‘Posse’—Didn’t drive to house—‘Posse’—Yes—Knows\r\nnames of perps—Yes—Drove in car—Yes—girlfriend’s\r\ncar.” 13 Record 2568. Smith contends that this note is\r\nexculpatory in that it suggests that he was “not involved”\r\nin the shootings. Brief for Petitioner 43.\r\n  Young’s statement is only exculpatory if Smith concedes\r\n(as the statement asserts) that he is, in fact, “Short Dog”\r\nand a member of the “Cut Throat Posse.” Such a conces-\r\nsion would only have strengthened the inculpatory value\r\nof the statements by Rogers and Trackling indicating that\r\nSmith was the “Short Dog” who committed the murders at\r\nEspadron’s home. In any event, the exculpatory value of\r\nthe note is minimal for several other reasons. First, it is\r\nunclear whether Ronquillo’s note reflects a statement by\r\nYoung that the “Posse” was not responsible for shooting\r\nthe victims or a statement that the “Posse” was not re-\r\nsponsible for shooting Young. Further, the statement that\r\n“Short Dog” and others were not with Young when he went\r\nto the house is certainly not a clear statement that “Short\r\nDog” did not commit the murders, especially in light of\r\nevidence in the record that the assailants used two cars on\r\n18                         SMITH v. CAIN\r\n\r\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nthe night of the murders.11 Second, had the jury learned\r\nof Ronquillo’s note, it would have presumably heard Ron-\r\nquillo testify, as he did at the postconviction hearing, that\r\nhe was not even sure whether his note actually reflected\r\nstatements by Young, given that Young “couldn’t talk,”\r\nwas “jumbled,” could only “kind of move his head,” and\r\nsometimes would just sit and stare when Ronquillo asked\r\na question.12 Tr. 423–424 (Jan. 22, 2009). Accordingly,\r\nRonquillo explained, “I never had hide nor hair actually of\r\nwhat [Young] said.” Id., at 423.\r\n   The jury thus would have evaluated Ronquillo’s note, of\r\nunclear exculpatory value on its face, against a backdrop\r\nof doubt as to what, if anything, Young actually communi-\r\ncated. The jury also would have weighed this evidence\r\nagainst the strongly inculpatory nature of Boatner’s de-\r\nscriptions and identifications and Rogers’ and Trackling’s\r\nstatements, which corroborated Boatner’s identification.\r\nWhen all of the evidence is considered cumulatively, as it\r\nmust be, Smith has not shown a reasonable probability\r\nthat the jury would have reached a different verdict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  11 In his station house statement, Boatner explained that the loud car\r\nthat arrived at Espadron’s home was white. 5 Record 866. In Rogers’\r\ninterview with the police, Rogers said that Trackling escaped from\r\nEspadron’s home in a burgundy car. Id., at 842.\r\n   12 Smith also contends that the defense could have used the undis-\r\n\r\nclosed note to impeach Ronquillo’s trial testimony that Young was not\r\nable to communicate with him “at all.” That argument lacks merit.\r\nRonquillo’s trial testimony, when read in context, does not suggest that\r\nno communication occurred. Rather, Ronquillo made clear that he\r\nsimply “couldn’t understand anything that [Young] was saying.” See Tr.\r\n103 (Dec. 5, 1995) (emphasis added). That testimony is consistent with\r\nthe garbled nature of the note, and the note thus would have had little,\r\nif any, impeachment value.\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          19\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n                        *      *    *\r\n   The question presented here is not whether a prudent\r\nprosecutor should have disclosed the information that\r\nSmith identifies. Rather, the question is whether the cu-\r\nmulative effect of the disclosed and undisclosed evidence\r\nin Smith’s case “put[s] the whole case in such a different\r\nlight as to undermine confidence in the verdict.” Kyles,\r\n514 U. S., at 435. When, as in this case, the Court departs\r\nfrom its usual practice of declining to review alleged mis-\r\napplications of settled law to particular facts, id., at 456\r\n(SCALIA, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and KENNEDY and\r\nTHOMAS, JJ., dissenting), the Court should at least consid-\r\ner all of the facts. And, the Court certainly should not\r\ndecline to review all of the facts on the assumption that\r\nthe remainder of the record would only further support\r\nSmith’s claims, as the Court appears to have done here.\r\nAnte, at 3–4.\r\n   Such an assumption is incorrect. Here, much of the\r\nrecord evidence confirms that, from the night of the mur-\r\nders through trial, Boatner consistently described—with\r\none understandable exception—the first perpetrator\r\nthrough the door, that Boatner’s description matched\r\nSmith, and that Boatner made strong out-of-court and in-\r\ncourt identifications implicating Smith. Some of the un-\r\ndisclosed evidence cited by Smith is not favorable to him\r\nat all, either because it is of no impeachment or exculpa-\r\ntory value or because it actually inculpates him. Because\r\nwhat remains is evidence of such minimal impeachment\r\nand exculpatory value as to be immaterial in light of the\r\nwhole record, I must dissent from the Court’s holding that\r\nthe State violated Brady.\r\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/620666/", "sha1": "e7b13b23edc35b241f36c173062996fd3a08cc46", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2012-01-10T17:02:03"}
