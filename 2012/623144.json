FIELDS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 10–680.      Argued October 4, 2011—Decided February 21, 2012\nRespondent Fields, a Michigan state prisoner, was escorted from his\n  prison cell by a corrections officer to a conference room where he was\n  questioned by two sheriff’s deputies about criminal activity he had al-\n  legedly engaged in before coming to prison. At no time was Fields\n  given Miranda warnings or advised that he did not have to speak\n  with the deputies. As relevant here: Fields was questioned for be-\n  tween five and seven hours; Fields was told more than once that he\n  was free to leave and return to his cell; the deputies were armed, but\n  Fields remained free of restraints; the conference room door was\n  sometimes open and sometimes shut; several times during the inter-\n  view Fields stated that he no longer wanted to talk to the deputies,\n  but he did not ask to go back to his cell; after Fields confessed and\n  the interview concluded, he had to wait an additional 20 minutes for\n  an escort and returned to his cell well after the hour when he gener-\n  ally retired.\n    The trial court denied Fields’ motion to suppress his confession\n  under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, and he was convicted. The\n  Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting Fields’ contention that\n  his statements should have been suppressed because he was subject-\n  ed to custodial interrogation without a Miranda warning. The Unit-\n  ed States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan subse-\n  quently granted Fields habeas relief under 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1).\n  Affirming, the Sixth Circuit held that the interview was a custodial\n  interrogation within the meaning of Miranda, reasoning that Mathis\n  v. United States, 391 U. S. 1, “clearly established,” §2254(d)(1), that\n  isolation from the general prison population, combined with question-\n  ing about conduct occurring outside the prison, makes any such in-\n  terrogation custodial per se.\n2                         HOWES v. FIELDS\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld:\n    1. This Court’s precedents do not clearly establish the categorical\n rule on which the Sixth Circuit relied. The Court has repeatedly de-\n clined to adopt any such rule. See, e.g., Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U. S.\n 292. The Sixth Circuit misread Mathis, which simply held, as rele-\n vant here, that a prisoner who otherwise meets the requirements for\n Miranda custody is not taken outside the scope of Miranda because\n he was incarcerated for an unconnected offense. It did not hold that\n imprisonment alone constitutes Miranda custody. Nor does the\n statement in Maryland v. Shatzer, 559 U. S. ___, ___, that “[n]o one\n questions that [inmate] Shatzer was in custody for Miranda purpos-\n es” support a per se rule. It means only that the issue of custody was\n not contested in that case. Finally, contrary to respondent’s sugges-\n tion, Miranda itself did not hold that the inherently compelling pres-\n sures of custodial interrogation are always present when a prisoner is\n taken aside and questioned about events outside the prison walls.\n Pp. 4–7.\n    2. The Sixth Circuit’s categorical rule—that imprisonment, ques-\n tioning in private, and questioning about events in the outside world\n create a custodial situation for Miranda purposes—is simply wrong.\n Pp. 8–13.\n       (a) The initial step in determining whether a person is in Miran-\n da custody is to ascertain, given “all of the circumstances surround-\n ing the interrogation,” how a suspect would have gauged his freedom\n of movement. Stansbury v. California, 511 U. S. 318, 322, 325. How-\n ever, not all restraints on freedom of movement amount to Miranda\n custody. See, e.g., Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 423. Shatzer,\n distinguishing between restraints on freedom of movement and Mi-\n randa custody, held that a break in Miranda custody between a sus-\n pect’s invocation of the right to counsel and the initiation of subse-\n quent questioning may occur while a suspect is serving an\n uninterrupted term of imprisonment. If a break in custody can occur,\n it must follow that imprisonment alone is not enough to create a cus-\n todial situation within the meaning of Miranda. At least three strong\n grounds support this conclusion: Questioning a person who is already\n in prison does not generally involve the shock that very often accom-\n panies arrest; a prisoner is unlikely to be lured into speaking by a\n longing for prompt release; and a prisoner knows that his questioners\n probably lack authority to affect the duration of his sentence. Thus,\n service of a prison term, without more, is not enough to constitute\n Miranda custody. Pp. 8–12.\n       (b) The other two elements in the Sixth Circuit’s rule are like-\n wise insufficient. Taking a prisoner aside for questioning may neces-\n sitate some additional limitations on the prisoner’s freedom of move-\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  ment, but it does not necessarily convert a noncustodial situation into\n  Miranda custody. Isolation may contribute to a coercive atmosphere\n  when a nonprisoner is questioned, but questioning a prisoner in pri-\n  vate does not generally remove him from a supportive atmosphere\n  and may be in his best interest. Neither does questioning a prisoner\n  about criminal activity outside the prison have a significantly greater\n  potential for coercion than questioning under otherwise identical cir-\n  cumstances about criminal activity within the prison walls. The co-\n  ercive pressure that Miranda guards against is neither mitigated nor\n  magnified by the location of the conduct about which questions are\n  asked. Pp. 12–13.\n     3. When a prisoner is questioned, the determination of custody\n  should focus on all of the features of the interrogation. The record in\n  this case reveals that respondent was not taken into custody for Mi-\n  randa purposes. While some of the facts lend support to his argu-\n  ment that Miranda’s custody requirement was met, they are offset by\n  others. Most important, he was told at the outset of the interroga-\n  tion, and reminded thereafter, that he was free to leave and could go\n  back to his cell whenever he wanted. Moreover, he was not physical-\n  ly restrained or threatened, was interviewed in a well-lit, average-\n  sized conference room where the door was sometimes left open, and\n  was offered food and water. These facts are consistent with an envi-\n  ronment in which a reasonable person would have felt free to termi-\n  nate the interview and leave, subject to the ordinary restraints of life\n  behind bars.

RANDALL\n               LEE FIELDS\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                              [February 21, 2012]\n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit\nheld that our precedents clearly establish that a prisoner\nis in custody within the meaning of Miranda v. Arizona,\n384 U. S. 436 (1966), if the prisoner is taken aside and\nquestioned about events that occurred outside the prison\nwalls. Our decisions, however, do not clearly establish\nsuch a rule, and therefore the Court of Appeals erred in\nholding that this rule provides a permissible basis for\nfederal habeas relief under the relevant provision of the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). Indeed, the rule ap-\nplied by the court below does not represent a correct inter-\npretation of our Miranda case law. We therefore reverse.\n                                          I\n  While serving a sentence in a Michigan jail, Randall\nFields was escorted by a corrections officer to a conference\nroom where two sheriff’s deputies questioned him about\nallegations that, before he came to prison, he had engaged\nin sexual conduct with a 12-year-old boy. In order to get to\nthe conference room, Fields had to go down one floor and\n2                         HOWES v. FIELDS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npass through a locked door that separated two sections\nof the facility. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a, 69a. Fields\narrived at the conference room between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m.1\nand was questioned for between five and seven hours.2\n  At the beginning of the interview, Fields was told that\nhe was free to leave and return to his cell. See id., at 70a.\nLater, he was again told that he could leave whenever he\nwanted. See id., at 90a. The two interviewing deputies\nwere armed during the interview, but Fields remained free\nof handcuffs and other restraints. The door to the confer-\nence room was sometimes open and sometimes shut. See\nid., at 70a–75a.\n  About halfway through the interview, after Fields had\nbeen confronted with the allegations of abuse, he became\nagitated and began to yell. See id., at 80a, 125a. Fields\ntestified that one of the deputies, using an expletive, told\nhim to sit down and said that “if [he] didn’t want to coop-\nerate, [he] could leave.” Id., at 89a; see also id., at 70a–\n71a. Fields eventually confessed to engaging in sex acts\nwith the boy. According to Fields’ testimony at a suppres-\nsion hearing, he said several times during the interview\nthat he no longer wanted to talk to the deputies, but he\ndid not ask to go back to his cell prior to the end of the\ninterview. See id., at 92a–93a.\n  When he was eventually ready to leave, he had to wait\n——————\n  1 Fields testified that he left his cell around 8 p.m. and that the in-\n\nterview began around 8:30 p.m. App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a. Both the\nMichigan Court of Appeals and the Sixth Circuit stated that the inter-\nview began between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. See id., at 4a, 54a.\n  2 The Court of Appeals stated that the interview lasted for approxi-\n\nmately seven hours, see id., at 4a, a figure that appears to be based\non the testimony of one of the interviewing deputies, see id., at 123a.\nFields put the number of hours between five and five and a half, saying\nthe interview began around 8:30 p.m. and continued until 1:30 a.m. or 2\na.m. See id., at 77a. The Michigan Court of Appeals stated that the\ninterview ended around midnight, which would put the length of the\ninterview at between three and five hours.\n                    Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                  3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nan additional 20 minutes or so because a corrections of-\nficer had to be summoned to escort him back to his cell,\nand he did not return to his cell until well after the hour\nwhen he generally retired.3 At no time was Fields given\nMiranda warnings or advised that he did not have to\nspeak with the deputies.\n   The State of Michigan charged Fields with criminal\nsexual conduct. Relying on Miranda, Fields moved to\nsuppress his confession, but the trial court denied his\nmotion. Over the renewed objection of defense counsel,\none of the interviewing deputies testified at trial about\nFields’ admissions. The jury convicted Fields of two\ncounts of third-degree criminal sexual conduct, and the\njudge sentenced him to a term of 10 to 15 years of impris-\nonment. On direct appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals\naffirmed, rejecting Fields’ contention that his statements\nshould have been suppressed because he was subjected to\ncustodial interrogation without a Miranda warning. The\ncourt ruled that Fields had not been in custody for pur-\nposes of Miranda during the interview, so no Miranda\nwarnings were required. The court emphasized that\nFields was told that he was free to leave and return to his\ncell but that he never asked to do so. The Michigan Su-\npreme Court denied discretionary review.\n   Fields then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in\nFederal District Court, and the court granted relief. The\nSixth Circuit affirmed, holding that the interview in the\nconference room was a “custodial interrogation” within\nthe meaning of Miranda because isolation from the general\nprison population combined with questioning about con-\nduct occurring outside the prison makes any such interro-\ngation custodial per se. The Court of Appeals reasoned\nthat this Court clearly established in Mathis v. United\n——————\n  3 Fields testified that his normal bedtime was 10:30 p.m. or 11 p.m.\n\nSee id., at 78a.\n4                     HOWES v. FIELDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStates, 391 U. S. 1 (1968), that “Miranda warnings must\nbe administered when law enforcement officers remove an\ninmate from the general prison population and interrogate\nhim regarding criminal conduct that took place outside the\njail or prison.” 617 F. 3d 813, 820 (CA6 2010); see also id.,\nat 818 (“The central holding of Mathis is that a Miranda\nwarning is required whenever an incarcerated individual\nis isolated from the general prison population and interro-\ngated, i.e.[,] questioned in a manner likely to lead to self-\nincrimination, about conduct occurring outside of the\nprison”). Because Fields was isolated from the general\nprison population and interrogated about conduct occur-\nring in the outside world, the Court of Appeals found that\nthe state court’s decision was contrary to clearly estab-\nlished federal law as determined by this Court in Mathis.\n617 F. 3d, at 823.\n   We granted certiorari. 562 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                              II\n  Under AEDPA, a federal court may grant a state pris-\noner’s application for a writ of habeas corpus if the state-\ncourt adjudication pursuant to which the prisoner is held\n“resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\nlaw, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). In this context, “clearly\nestablished law” signifies “the holdings, as opposed to the\ndicta, of this Court’s decisions.” Williams v. Taylor, 529\nU. S. 362, 412 (2000).\n  In this case, it is abundantly clear that our precedents\ndo not clearly establish the categorical rule on which the\nCourt of Appeals relied, i.e., that the questioning of a\nprisoner is always custodial when the prisoner is removed\nfrom the general prison population and questioned about\nevents that occurred outside the prison. On the contrary,\nwe have repeatedly declined to adopt any categorical rule\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwith respect to whether the questioning of a prison inmate\nis custodial.\n   In Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U. S. 292 (1990), where we\nupheld the admission of un-Mirandized statements elicit-\ned from an inmate by an undercover officer masquerading\nas another inmate, we noted that “[t]he bare fact of cus-\ntody may not in every instance require a warning even when\nthe suspect is aware that he is speaking to an official, but\nwe do not have occasion to explore that issue here.” Id., at\n299 (emphasis added). Instead, we simply “reject[ed] the\nargument that Miranda warnings are required whenever\na suspect is in custody in a technical sense and converses\nwith someone who happens to be a government agent.”\nId., at 297.\n   Most recently, in Maryland v. Shatzer, 559 U. S. ___\n(2010), we expressly declined to adopt a bright-line rule\nfor determining the applicability of Miranda in prisons.\nShatzer considered whether a break in custody ends the\npresumption of involuntariness established in Edwards v.\nArizona, 451 U. S. 477 (1981), and, if so, whether a prison-\ner’s return to the general prison population after a custo-\ndial interrogation constitutes a break in Miranda custody.\nSee 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3–4). In considering the\nlatter question, we noted first that “[w]e have never decid-\ned whether incarceration constitutes custody for Miranda\npurposes, and have indeed explicitly declined to address\nthe issue.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (citing Perkins,\nsupra, at 299; emphasis added). The answer to this ques-\ntion, we noted, would “depen[d] upon whether [incar-\nceration] exerts the coercive pressure that Miranda was\ndesigned to guard against—the ‘danger of coercion [that]\nresults from the interaction of custody and official inter-\nrogation.’ ” 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (quoting\nPerkins, supra, at 297).\n   In concluding that our precedents establish a categorical\nrule, the Court of Appeals placed great weight on the\n6                         HOWES v. FIELDS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndecision in Mathis, but the Court of Appeals misread the\nholding in that case. In Mathis, an inmate in a state\nprison was questioned by an Internal Revenue agent and\nwas subsequently convicted for federal offenses. The\nCourt of Appeals held that Miranda did not apply to this\ninterview for two reasons: A criminal investigation had\nnot been commenced at the time of the interview, and\nthe prisoner was incarcerated for an “unconnected offense.”\nMathis v. United States, 376 F. 2d 595, 597 (CA5 1967).\nThis Court rejected both of those grounds for distinguish-\ning Miranda, 391 U. S., at 4, and thus the holding in\nMathis is simply that a prisoner who otherwise meets the\nrequirements for Miranda custody is not taken outside the\nscope of Miranda by either of the two factors on which\nthe Court of Appeals had relied. Mathis did not hold\nthat imprisonment, in and of itself, is enough to constitute\nMiranda custody.4 Nor, contrary to respondent’s submis-\nsion, see Brief for Respondent 14, did Oregon v. Mathia-\nson, 429 U. S. 492, 494 (1977) (per curiam), which simply\nrestated in dictum the holding in Mathis.\n   The Court of Appeals purported to find support for its\nper se rule in Shatzer, relying on our statement that “[n]o\none questions that Shatzer was in custody for Miranda\npurposes” when he was interviewed. 559 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 13). But this statement means only that the issue\nof custody was not contested before us. It strains credulity\nto read the statement as constituting an “unambiguous\nconclusion” or “finding” by this Court that Shatzer was in\ncustody. 617 F. 3d, at 822.\n   Finally, contrary to respondent’s suggestion, see Brief\nfor Respondent 12–15, Miranda itself did not clearly es-\n\n——————\n    4 Indeed,\n            it is impossible to tell from either the opinion of this Court\nor that of the court below whether the prisoner’s interview was routine\nor whether there were special features that may have created an\nespecially coercive atmosphere.\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntablish the rule applied by the Court of Appeals. Miranda\nadopted a “set of prophylactic measures” designed to ward\noff the “ ‘inherently compelling pressures’ of custodial\ninterrogation,” Shatzer, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 4) (quot-\ning Miranda, 384 U. S., at 467), but Miranda did not hold\nthat such pressures are always present when a prisoner\nis taken aside and questioned about events outside the\nprison walls. Indeed, Miranda did not even establish that\npolice questioning of a suspect at the station house is\nalways custodial. See Mathiason, supra, at 495 (declining\nto find that Miranda warnings are required “simply be-\ncause the questioning takes place in the station house, or\nbecause the questioned person is one whom the police\nsuspect”).\n  In sum, our decisions do not clearly establish that a\nprisoner is always in custody for purposes of Miranda\nwhenever a prisoner is isolated from the general prison\npopulation and questioned about conduct outside the\nprison.5\n——————\n   5 The state-court decision applied the traditional context-specific\n\nanalysis to determine whether the circumstances of respondent’s\ninterrogation gave rise to “the coercive pressure that Miranda was\ndesigned to guard against.” Shatzer, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).\nThe court first observed: “That a defendant is in prison for an unrelated\noffense when being questioned does not, without more, mean that he\nwas in custody for the purpose of determining whether Miranda warn-\nings were required.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 56a (internal quotation\nmarks omitted and emphasis added). In this case, the court noted, the\n“defendant was unquestionably in custody, but on a matter unrelated to\nthe interrogation.” Ibid. The Sixth Circuit concluded that the state\ncourt thereby limited Miranda in a way rejected by Mathis v. United\nStates, 391 U. S. 1 (1968), and “curtail[ed] the warnings to be given\npersons under interrogation by officers based on the reason why the\nperson is in custody.” Id., at 4–5. We think the better reading is that\nthe state court merely meant to draw a distinction between incarcera-\ntion and Miranda custody. This reading is supported by the state\ncourt’s subsequent consideration of whether the facts of the case were\nlikely to create an atmosphere of coercion. App. to Pet. for Cert. 56a.\n8                     HOWES v. FIELDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                            III\n\n  Not only does the categorical rule applied below go well\nbeyond anything that is clearly established in our prior\ndecisions, it is simply wrong. The three elements of that\nrule—(1) imprisonment, (2) questioning in private, and (3)\nquestioning about events in the outside world—are not\nnecessarily enough to create a custodial situation for\nMiranda purposes.\n                             A\n   As used in our Miranda case law, “custody” is a term of\nart that specifies circumstances that are thought generally\nto present a serious danger of coercion. In determining\nwhether a person is in custody in this sense, the initial\nstep is to ascertain whether, in light of “the objective cir-\ncumstances of the interrogation,” Stansbury v. Califor-\nnia, 511 U. S. 318, 322–323, 325 (1994) (per curiam), a\n“reasonable person [would] have felt he or she was not at\nliberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.” Thomp-\nson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99, 112 (1995). And in order to\ndetermine how a suspect would have “gauge[d]” his “free-\ndom of movement,” courts must examine “all of the cir-\ncumstances surrounding the interrogation.” Stansbury,\nsupra, at 322, 325 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nRelevant factors include the location of the questioning,\nsee Shatzer, supra, at ___–___ (slip op., at 13–16), its\nduration, see Berkemer v.

S. ____ (2012)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nment was curtailed, however, is simply the first step in the\nanalysis, not the last. Not all restraints on freedom of\nmovement amount to custody for purposes of Miranda.\nWe have “decline[d] to accord talismanic power” to the\nfreedom-of-movement inquiry, Berkemer, supra, at 437,\nand have instead asked the additional question whether\nthe relevant environment presents the same inherently\ncoercive pressures as the type of station house questioning\nat issue in Miranda. “Our cases make clear . . . that the\nfreedom-of-movement test identifies only a necessary and\nnot a sufficient condition for Miranda custody.” Shatzer,\n559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).\n   This important point is illustrated by our decision in\nBerkemer v. McCarty, supra. In that case, we held that\nthe roadside questioning of a motorist who was pulled over\nin a routine traffic stop did not constitute custodial inter-\nrogation. Id., at 423, 441–442. We acknowledged that “a\ntraffic stop significantly curtails the ‘freedom of action’ of\nthe driver and the passengers,” and that it is generally “a\ncrime either to ignore a policeman’s signal to stop one’s car\nor, once having stopped, to drive away without permis-\nsion.” Id., at 436. “[F]ew motorists,” we noted, “would feel\nfree either to disobey a directive to pull over or to leave the\nscene of a traffic stop without being told they might do so.”\nIbid. Nevertheless, we held that a person detained as a\nresult of a traffic stop is not in Miranda custody because\nsuch detention does not “sufficiently impair [the detained\nperson’s] free exercise of his privilege against self-\nincrimination to require that he be warned of his consti-\ntutional rights.” 468 U. S., at 437. As we later put it,\nthe “temporary and relatively nonthreatening detention in-\nvolved in a traffic stop or Terry stop does not constitute\nMiranda custody,” Shatzer, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 14)\n(citation omitted). See Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968).\n   It may be thought that the situation in Berkemer—the\nquestioning of a motorist subjected to a brief traffic stop—\n10                    HOWES v. FIELDS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nis worlds away from those present when an inmate is\nquestioned in a prison, but the same cannot be said of\nShatzer, where we again distinguished between restraints\non freedom of movement and Miranda custody. Shatzer,\nas noted, concerned the Edwards prophylactic rule, which\nlimits the ability of the police to initiate further question-\ning of a suspect in Miranda custody once the suspect\ninvokes the right to counsel. We held in Shatzer that this\nrule does not apply when there is a sufficient break in\ncustody between the suspect’s invocation of the right to\ncounsel and the initiation of subsequent questioning. See\n559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13-16). And, what is signifi-\ncant for present purposes, we further held that a break\nin custody may occur while a suspect is serving a term in\nprison. If a break in custody can occur while a prisoner is\nserving an uninterrupted term of imprisonment, it must\nfollow that imprisonment alone is not enough to create a\ncustodial situation within the meaning of Miranda.\n   There are at least three strong grounds for this conclu-\nsion. First, questioning a person who is already serving a\nprison term does not generally involve the shock that very\noften accompanies arrest. In the paradigmatic Miranda\nsituation—a person is arrested in his home or on the\nstreet and whisked to a police station for questioning—\ndetention represents a sharp and ominous change, and the\nshock may give rise to coercive pressures. A person who is\n“cut off from his normal life and companions,” Shatzer,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 7), and abruptly transported from\nthe street into a “police-dominated atmosphere,” Miranda,\n384 U. S., at 456, may feel coerced into answering\nquestions.\n   By contrast, when a person who is already serving a\nterm of imprisonment is questioned, there is usually no\nsuch change. “Interrogated suspects who have previously\nbeen convicted of crime live in prison.” Shatzer, 559 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 14). For a person serving a term of\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nincarceration, we reasoned in Shatzer, the ordinary re-\nstrictions of prison life, while no doubt unpleasant, are\nexpected and familiar and thus do not involve the same\n“inherently compelling pressures” that are often present\nwhen a suspect is yanked from familiar surroundings in\nthe outside world and subjected to interrogation in a police\nstation. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4).\n  Second, a prisoner, unlike a person who has not been\nsentenced to a term of incarceration, is unlikely to be\nlured into speaking by a longing for prompt release. When\na person is arrested and taken to a station house for inter-\nrogation, the person who is questioned may be pressured\nto speak by the hope that, after doing so, he will be al-\nlowed to leave and go home. On the other hand, when a\nprisoner is questioned, he knows that when the question-\ning ceases, he will remain under confinement. Id., at ___–\n___, n. 8 (slip op., at 14–15, n. 8).\n  Third, a prisoner, unlike a person who has not been\nconvicted and sentenced, knows that the law enforcement\nofficers who question him probably lack the authority to\naffect the duration of his sentence. Id., at ___–___ (slip\nop., at 14–15). And “where the possibility of parole exists,”\nthe interrogating officers probably also lack the power to\nbring about an early release. Ibid. “When the suspect has\nno reason to think that the listeners have official power\nover him, it should not be assumed that his words are\nmotivated by the reaction he expects from his listeners.”\nPerkins, 496 U. S., at 297. Under such circumstances,\nthere is little “basis for the assumption that a suspect . . .\nwill feel compelled to speak by the fear of reprisal for\nremaining silent or in the hope of [a] more lenient treat-\nment should he confess.” Id., at 296–297.\n  In short, standard conditions of confinement and associ-\nated restrictions on freedom will not necessarily implicate\nthe same interests that the Court sought to protect when\nit afforded special safeguards to persons subjected to\n12                    HOWES v. FIELDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncustodial interrogation. Thus, service of a term of impris-\nonment, without more, is not enough to constitute Miran-\nda custody.\n                               B\n   The two other elements included in the Court of Ap-\npeals’ rule—questioning in private and questioning about\nevents that took place outside the prison—are likewise\ninsufficient.\n   Taking a prisoner aside for questioning—as opposed\nto questioning the prisoner in the presence of fellow in-\nmates—does not necessarily convert a “noncustodial situa-\ntion . . . to one in which Miranda applies.” Mathiason, 429\nU. S., at 495. When a person who is not serving a prison\nterm is questioned, isolation may contribute to a coercive\natmosphere by preventing family members, friends, and\nothers who may be sympathetic from providing either\nadvice or emotional support. And without any such assis-\ntance, the person who is questioned may feel overwhelm-\ning pressure to speak and to refrain from asking that the\ninterview be terminated.\n   By contrast, questioning a prisoner in private does not\ngenerally remove the prisoner from a supportive atmos-\nphere. Fellow inmates are by no means necessarily\nfriends. On the contrary, they may be hostile and, for a\nvariety of reasons, may react negatively to what the ques-\ntioning reveals. In the present case, for example, would\nrespondent have felt more at ease if he had been ques-\ntioned in the presence of other inmates about the sexual\nabuse of an adolescent boy? Isolation from the general\nprison population is often in the best interest of the inter-\nviewee and, in any event, does not suggest on its own\nthe atmosphere of coercion that concerned the Court in\nMiranda.\n   It is true that taking a prisoner aside for questioning\nmay necessitate some additional limitations on his free-\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndom of movement. A prisoner may, for example, be re-\nmoved from an exercise yard and taken, under close\nguard, to the room where the interview is to be held. But\nsuch procedures are an ordinary and familiar attribute of\nlife behind bars. Escorts and special security precautions\nmay be standard procedures regardless of the purpose for\nwhich an inmate is removed from his regular routine and\ntaken to a special location. For example, ordinary prison\nprocedure may require such measures when a prisoner is\nled to a meeting with an attorney.\n   Finally, we fail to see why questioning about criminal\nactivity outside the prison should be regarded as having a\nsignificantly greater potential for coercion than question-\ning under otherwise identical circumstances about crimi-\nnal activity within the prison walls. In both instances,\nthere is the potential for additional criminal liability and\npunishment. If anything, the distinction would seem to\ncut the other way, as an inmate who confesses to miscon-\nduct that occurred within the prison may also incur ad-\nministrative penalties, but even this is not enough to tip\nthe scale in the direction of custody. “The threat to a\ncitizen’s Fifth Amendment rights that Miranda was de-\nsigned to neutralize” is neither mitigated nor magnified by\nthe location of the conduct about which questions are\nasked. Berkemer, 468 U. S., at 435, n. 22.\n   For these reasons, the Court of Appeals’ categorical rule\nis unsound.\n                             IV \n\n                              A\n\n   When a prisoner is questioned, the determination of\ncustody should focus on all of the features of the interroga-\ntion. These include the language that is used in summon-\ning the prisoner to the interview and the manner in which\nthe interrogation is conducted. See Yarborough, 541 U. S.,\nat 665. An inmate who is removed from the general prison\n14                    HOWES v.

S., at 440.\n   “Fidelity to the doctrine announced in Miranda requires\nthat it be enforced strictly, but only in those types of situa-\ntions in which the concerns that powered the decision are\nimplicated.” Id., at 437; see Shatzer, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 9); Mathiason, supra, at 495. Confessions voluntar-\nily made by prisoners in other situations should not be\nsuppressed. “Voluntary confessions are not merely a\nproper element in law enforcement, they are an unmiti-\ngated good, essential to society’s compelling interest in\nfinding, convicting, and punishing those who violate the\nlaw.” Shatzer, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 9) (internal quota-\ntion marks and citations omitted).\n                              B\n   The record in this case reveals that respondent was not\ntaken into custody for purposes of Miranda. To be sure,\nrespondent did not invite the interview or consent to it in\nadvance, and he was not advised that he was free to de-\ncline to speak with the deputies. The following facts also\nlend some support to respondent’s argument that Miran-\nda’s custody requirement was met: The interview lasted\nfor between five and seven hours in the evening and con-\ntinued well past the hour when respondent generally went\nto bed; the deputies who questioned respondent were\narmed; and one of the deputies, according to respondent,\n“[u]sed a very sharp tone,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 76a, and,\non one occasion, profanity, see id., at 77a.\n   These circumstances, however, were offset by others.\nMost important, respondent was told at the outset of the\ninterrogation, and was reminded again thereafter, that he\ncould leave and go back to his cell whenever he wanted.\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

Moreover, respond-\nent was not physically restrained or threatened and was\ninterviewed in a well-lit, average-sized conference room,\nwhere he was “not uncomfortable.” Id., at 90a; see id., at\n71a, 88a–89a. He was offered food and water, and the\ndoor to the conference room was sometimes left open. See\nid., at 70a, 74a. “All of these objective facts are consistent\nwith an interrogation environment in which a reasonable\nperson would have felt free to terminate the interview and\nleave.” Yarborough, supra, at 664–665.\n   Because he was in prison, respondent was not free to\nleave the conference room by himself and to make his own\nway through the facility to his cell. Instead, he was es-\ncorted to the conference room and, when he ultimately\ndecided to end the interview, he had to wait about 20\nminutes for a corrections officer to arrive and escort him to\nhis cell. But he would have been subject to this same\nrestraint even if he had been taken to the conference room\nfor some reason other than police questioning; under no\ncircumstances could he have reasonably expected to be\nable to roam free.6 And while respondent testified that he\n——————\n    6 Respondent did not testify to the contrary.

See,\ne.g., Maryland v. Shatzer, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip\nop., at 13–16); Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99, 112\n(1995). But I disagree with the Court’s further determina-\ntion that Fields was not in custody under Miranda. Were\nthe case here on direct review, I would vote to hold that\nMiranda precludes the State’s introduction of Fields’s\nconfession as evidence against him.\n   Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), reacted to\npolice interrogation tactics that eroded the Fifth Amend-\nment’s ban on compulsory self-incrimination. The opinion\ndid so by requiring interrogators to convey to suspects\nthe now-familiar warnings: The suspect is to be informed,\nprior to interrogation, that he “has a right to remain si-\nlent, that any statement he does make may be used as\nevidence against him, and that he has a right to the pres-\nence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.” Id., at\n444.\n   Under what circumstances are Miranda warnings re-\nquired? Miranda tells us “in all settings in which [a per-\n2                     HOWES v. FIELDS\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nson’s] freedom of action is curtailed in any significant\nway.” Id., at 467. Given the reality that police interroga-\ntors “trad[e] on the weakness of individuals,” i.e., their\n“insecurity about [themselves] or [their] surroundings,”\nid., at 455, the Court found the preinterrogation warnings\nset out in the opinion “indispensable,” id., at 469. Those\nwarnings, the Court elaborated, are “an absolute prerequi-\nsite in overcoming the inherent pressures of the interroga-\ntion atmosphere,” id., at 468; they “insure” that the sus-\npect is timely told of his Fifth Amendment privilege, and\nhis freedom to exercise it, id., at 469.\n   Fields, serving time for disorderly conduct, was, of\ncourse, “i[n] custody,” but not “for purposes of Miranda,”\nthe Court concludes. Ante, at 14. I would not train, as the\nCourt does, on the question whether there can be custody\nwithin custody. Instead, I would ask, as Miranda put it,\nwhether Fields was subjected to “incommunicado interro-\ngation . . . in a police-dominated atmosphere,” 384 U. S., at\n445, whether he was placed, against his will, in an inher-\nently stressful situation, see id., at 468, and whether his\n“freedom of action [was] curtailed in any significant way,”\nid., at 467. Those should be the key questions, and to each\nI would answer “Yes.”\n   As the Court acknowledges, Fields did not invite or\nconsent to the interview. Ante, at 14. He was removed\nfrom his cell in the evening, taken to a conference room in\nthe sheriff ’s quarters, and questioned by two armed depu-\nties long into the night and early morning. Ibid. He was\nnot told at the outset that he had the right to decline to\nspeak with the deputies. Ibid. Shut in with the armed\nofficers, Fields felt “trapped.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 71a.\nAlthough told he could return to his cell if he did not want\nto cooperate, id., at 71a–72a, Fields believed the deputies\n“would not have allowed [him] to leave the room,” id., at\n72a. And with good reason. More than once, “he told the\nofficers . . . he did not want to speak with them anymore.”\n                   Cite as: 565 U.

He was given water, App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 74a, but not his evening medications,\nid., at 79a.* Yet the Court concludes that Fields was in\n“an interrogation environment in which a reasonable person\nwould have felt free to terminate the interview and leave.”\nAnte, at 15 (quoting Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S.\n652, 665 (2004)).\n  Critical to the Court’s judgment is “the undisputed fact\nthat [Fields] was told that he was free to end the question-\ning and to return to his cell.” Ante, at 17. Never mind\nthe facts suggesting that Fields’s submission to the over-\nnight interview was anything but voluntary. Was Fields\n“held for interrogation”? See Miranda, 384 U. S., at 471.\nBrought to, and left alone with, the gun-bearing deputies,\nhe surely was in my judgment.\n  Miranda instructed that such a person “must be clearly\ninformed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer\nand to have the lawyer with him during interrogation.”\nIbid. Those warnings, along with “warnings of the right\nto remain silent and that anything stated can be used in\nevidence against [the speaker],” Miranda explained, are\nnecessary “prerequisite[s] to [an] interrogation” compati-\nble with the Fifth Amendment. Ibid. Today, for people\nalready in prison, the Court finds it adequate for the police\nto say: “You are free to terminate this interrogation and\nreturn to your cell.” Such a statement is no substitute for\none ensuring that an individual is aware of his rights.\n  For the reasons stated, I would hold that the “incommu-\nnicado interrogation [of Fields] in a police-dominated\natmosphere,” id., at 445, without informing him of his\nrights, dishonored the Fifth Amendment privilege Miran-\nda was designed to safeguard.\n——————\n  * Each night, Fields took an antidepressant and, due to his kidney\ntransplant surgery, two antirejection medications.

Argued October 4, 2011—Decided February 21, 2012\nRespondent Fields, a Michigan state prisoner, was escorted from his\n  prison cell by a corrections officer to a conference room where he was\n  questioned by two sheriff’s deputies about criminal activity he had al-\n  legedly engaged in before coming to prison. At no time was Fields\n  given Miranda warnings or advised that he did not have to speak\n  with the deputies. As relevant here: Fields was questioned for be-\n  tween five and seven hours; Fields was told more than once that he\n  was free to leave and return to his cell; the deputies were armed, but\n  Fields remained free of restraints; the conference room door was\n  sometimes open and sometimes shut; several times during the inter-\n  view Fields stated that he no longer wanted to talk to the deputies,\n  but he did not ask to go back to his cell; after Fields confessed and\n  the interview concluded, he had to wait an additional 20 minutes for\n  an escort and returned to his cell well after the hour when he gener-\n  ally retired.\n    The trial court denied Fields’ motion to suppress his confession\n  under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, and he was convicted. The\n  Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting Fields’ contention that\n  his statements should have been suppressed because he was subject-\n  ed to custodial interrogation without a Miranda warning. The Unit-\n  ed States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan subse-\n  quently granted Fields habeas relief under 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1).\n  Affirming, the Sixth Circuit held that the interview was a custodial\n  interrogation within the meaning of Miranda, reasoning that Mathis\n  v. United States, 391 U. S. 1, “clearly established,” §2254(d)(1), that\n  isolation from the general prison population, combined with question-\n  ing about conduct occurring outside the prison, makes any such in-\n  terrogation custodial per se.\n2                         HOWES v. FIELDS\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld:\n    1. This Court’s precedents do not clearly establish the categorical\n rule on which the Sixth Circuit relied. The Court has repeatedly de-\n clined to adopt any such rule. See, e.g., Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U. S.\n 292. The Sixth Circuit misread Mathis, which simply held, as rele-\n vant here, that a prisoner who otherwise meets the requirements for\n Miranda custody is not taken outside the scope of Miranda because\n he was incarcerated for an unconnected offense. It did not hold that\n imprisonment alone constitutes Miranda custody. Nor does the\n statement in Maryland v. Shatzer, 559 U. S. ___, ___, that “[n]o one\n questions that [inmate] Shatzer was in custody for Miranda purpos-\n es” support a per se rule. It means only that the issue of custody was\n not contested in that case. Finally, contrary to respondent’s sugges-\n tion, Miranda itself did not hold that the inherently compelling pres-\n sures of custodial interrogation are always present when a prisoner is\n taken aside and questioned about events outside the prison walls.\n Pp. 4–7.\n    2. The Sixth Circuit’s categorical rule—that imprisonment, ques-\n tioning in private, and questioning about events in the outside world\n create a custodial situation for Miranda purposes—is simply wrong.\n Pp. 8–13.\n       (a) The initial step in determining whether a person is in Miran-\n da custody is to ascertain, given “all of the circumstances surround-\n ing the interrogation,” how a suspect would have gauged his freedom\n of movement. Stansbury v. California, 511 U. S. 318, 322, 325. How-\n ever, not all restraints on freedom of movement amount to Miranda\n custody. See, e.g., Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 423. Shatzer,\n distinguishing between restraints on freedom of movement and Mi-\n randa custody, held that a break in Miranda custody between a sus-\n pect’s invocation of the right to counsel and the initiation of subse-\n quent questioning may occur while a suspect is serving an\n uninterrupted term of imprisonment. If a break in custody can occur,\n it must follow that imprisonment alone is not enough to create a cus-\n todial situation within the meaning of Miranda. At least three strong\n grounds support this conclusion: Questioning a person who is already\n in prison does not generally involve the shock that very often accom-\n panies arrest; a prisoner is unlikely to be lured into speaking by a\n longing for prompt release; and a prisoner knows that his questioners\n probably lack authority to affect the duration of his sentence. Thus,\n service of a prison term, without more, is not enough to constitute\n Miranda custody. Pp. 8–12.\n       (b) The other two elements in the Sixth Circuit’s rule are like-\n wise insufficient. Taking a prisoner aside for questioning may neces-\n sitate some additional limitations on the prisoner’s freedom of move-\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

Isolation may contribute to a coercive atmosphere\n  when a nonprisoner is questioned, but questioning a prisoner in pri-\n  vate does not generally remove him from a supportive atmosphere\n  and may be in his best interest. Neither does questioning a prisoner\n  about criminal activity outside the prison have a significantly greater\n  potential for coercion than questioning under otherwise identical cir-\n  cumstances about criminal activity within the prison walls. The co-\n  ercive pressure that Miranda guards against is neither mitigated nor\n  magnified by the location of the conduct about which questions are\n  asked. Pp. 12–13.\n     3. When a prisoner is questioned, the determination of custody\n  should focus on all of the features of the interrogation. The record in\n  this case reveals that respondent was not taken into custody for Mi-\n  randa purposes. While some of the facts lend support to his argu-\n  ment that Miranda’s custody requirement was met, they are offset by\n  others. Most important, he was told at the outset of the interroga-\n  tion, and reminded thereafter, that he was free to leave and could go\n  back to his cell whenever he wanted. Moreover, he was not physical-\n  ly restrained or threatened, was interviewed in a well-lit, average-\n  sized conference room where the door was sometimes left open, and\n  was offered food and water. These facts are consistent with an envi-\n  ronment in which a reasonable person would have felt free to termi-\n  nate the interview and leave, subject to the ordinary restraints of life\n  behind bars.

Arizona,\n384 U. S. 436 (1966), if the prisoner is taken aside and\nquestioned about events that occurred outside the prison\nwalls. Our decisions, however, do not clearly establish\nsuch a rule, and therefore the Court of Appeals erred in\nholding that this rule provides a permissible basis for\nfederal habeas relief under the relevant provision of the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). Indeed, the rule ap-\nplied by the court below does not represent a correct inter-\npretation of our Miranda case law. We therefore reverse.\n                                          I\n  While serving a sentence in a Michigan jail, Randall\nFields was escorted by a corrections officer to a conference\nroom where two sheriff’s deputies questioned him about\nallegations that, before he came to prison, he had engaged\nin sexual conduct with a 12-year-old boy. In order to get to\nthe conference room, Fields had to go down one floor and\n2                         HOWES v. FIELDS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npass through a locked door that separated two sections\nof the facility. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a, 69a. Fields\narrived at the conference room between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m.1\nand was questioned for between five and seven hours.2\n  At the beginning of the interview, Fields was told that\nhe was free to leave and return to his cell. See id., at 70a.\nLater, he was again told that he could leave whenever he\nwanted. See id., at 90a. The two interviewing deputies\nwere armed during the interview, but Fields remained free\nof handcuffs and other restraints. The door to the confer-\nence room was sometimes open and sometimes shut. See\nid., at 70a–75a.\n  About halfway through the interview, after Fields had\nbeen confronted with the allegations of abuse, he became\nagitated and began to yell. See id., at 80a, 125a. Fields\ntestified that one of the deputies, using an expletive, told\nhim to sit down and said that “if [he] didn’t want to coop-\nerate, [he] could leave.” Id., at 89a; see also id., at 70a–\n71a. Fields eventually confessed to engaging in sex acts\nwith the boy. According to Fields’ testimony at a suppres-\nsion hearing, he said several times during the interview\nthat he no longer wanted to talk to the deputies, but he\ndid not ask to go back to his cell prior to the end of the\ninterview. See id., at 92a–93a.\n  When he was eventually ready to leave, he had to wait\n——————\n  1 Fields testified that he left his cell around 8 p.m. and that the in-\n\nterview began around 8:30 p.m. App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a. Both the\nMichigan Court of Appeals and the Sixth Circuit stated that the inter-\nview began between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. See id., at 4a, 54a.\n  2 The Court of Appeals stated that the interview lasted for approxi-\n\nmately seven hours, see id., at 4a, a figure that appears to be based\non the testimony of one of the interviewing deputies, see id., at 123a.\nFields put the number of hours between five and five and a half, saying\nthe interview began around 8:30 p.m. and continued until 1:30 a.m. or 2\na.m. See id., at 77a. The Michigan Court of Appeals stated that the\ninterview ended around midnight, which would put the length of the\ninterview at between three and five hours.\n                    Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                  3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nan additional 20 minutes or so because a corrections of-\nficer had to be summoned to escort him back to his cell,\nand he did not return to his cell until well after the hour\nwhen he generally retired.3 At no time was Fields given\nMiranda warnings or advised that he did not have to\nspeak with the deputies.\n   The State of Michigan charged Fields with criminal\nsexual conduct. Relying on Miranda, Fields moved to\nsuppress his confession, but the trial court denied his\nmotion. Over the renewed objection of defense counsel,\none of the interviewing deputies testified at trial about\nFields’ admissions. The jury convicted Fields of two\ncounts of third-degree criminal sexual conduct, and the\njudge sentenced him to a term of 10 to 15 years of impris-\nonment. On direct appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals\naffirmed, rejecting Fields’ contention that his statements\nshould have been suppressed because he was subjected to\ncustodial interrogation without a Miranda warning. The\ncourt ruled that Fields had not been in custody for pur-\nposes of Miranda during the interview, so no Miranda\nwarnings were required. The court emphasized that\nFields was told that he was free to leave and return to his\ncell but that he never asked to do so. The Michigan Su-\npreme Court denied discretionary review.\n   Fields then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in\nFederal District Court, and the court granted relief. The\nSixth Circuit affirmed, holding that the interview in the\nconference room was a “custodial interrogation” within\nthe meaning of Miranda because isolation from the general\nprison population combined with questioning about con-\nduct occurring outside the prison makes any such interro-\ngation custodial per se. The Court of Appeals reasoned\nthat this Court clearly established in Mathis v. United\n——————\n  3 Fields testified that his normal bedtime was 10:30 p.m. or 11 p.m.\n\nSee id., at 78a.\n4                     HOWES v. FIELDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStates, 391 U. S. 1 (1968), that “Miranda warnings must\nbe administered when law enforcement officers remove an\ninmate from the general prison population and interrogate\nhim regarding criminal conduct that took place outside the\njail or prison.” 617 F. 3d 813, 820 (CA6 2010); see also id.,\nat 818 (“The central holding of Mathis is that a Miranda\nwarning is required whenever an incarcerated individual\nis isolated from the general prison population and interro-\ngated, i.e.[,] questioned in a manner likely to lead to self-\nincrimination, about conduct occurring outside of the\nprison”). Because Fields was isolated from the general\nprison population and interrogated about conduct occur-\nring in the outside world, the Court of Appeals found that\nthe state court’s decision was contrary to clearly estab-\nlished federal law as determined by this Court in Mathis.\n617 F. 3d, at 823.\n   We granted certiorari. 562 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                              II\n  Under AEDPA, a federal court may grant a state pris-\noner’s application for a writ of habeas corpus if the state-\ncourt adjudication pursuant to which the prisoner is held\n“resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\nlaw, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). In this context, “clearly\nestablished law” signifies “the holdings, as opposed to the\ndicta, of this Court’s decisions.” Williams v. Taylor, 529\nU. S. 362, 412 (2000).\n  In this case, it is abundantly clear that our precedents\ndo not clearly establish the categorical rule on which the\nCourt of Appeals relied, i.e., that the questioning of a\nprisoner is always custodial when the prisoner is removed\nfrom the general prison population and questioned about\nevents that occurred outside the prison. On the contrary,\nwe have repeatedly declined to adopt any categorical rule\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwith respect to whether the questioning of a prison inmate\nis custodial.\n   In Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U. S. 292 (1990), where we\nupheld the admission of un-Mirandized statements elicit-\ned from an inmate by an undercover officer masquerading\nas another inmate, we noted that “[t]he bare fact of cus-\ntody may not in every instance require a warning even when\nthe suspect is aware that he is speaking to an official, but\nwe do not have occasion to explore that issue here.” Id., at\n299 (emphasis added). Instead, we simply “reject[ed] the\nargument that Miranda warnings are required whenever\na suspect is in custody in a technical sense and converses\nwith someone who happens to be a government agent.”\nId., at 297.\n   Most recently, in Maryland v. Shatzer, 559 U. S. ___\n(2010), we expressly declined to adopt a bright-line rule\nfor determining the applicability of Miranda in prisons.\nShatzer considered whether a break in custody ends the\npresumption of involuntariness established in Edwards v.\nArizona, 451 U. S. 477 (1981), and, if so, whether a prison-\ner’s return to the general prison population after a custo-\ndial interrogation constitutes a break in Miranda custody.\nSee 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3–4). In considering the\nlatter question, we noted first that “[w]e have never decid-\ned whether incarceration constitutes custody for Miranda\npurposes, and have indeed explicitly declined to address\nthe issue.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (citing Perkins,\nsupra, at 299; emphasis added). The answer to this ques-\ntion, we noted, would “depen[d] upon whether [incar-\nceration] exerts the coercive pressure that Miranda was\ndesigned to guard against—the ‘danger of coercion [that]\nresults from the interaction of custody and official inter-\nrogation.’ ” 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (quoting\nPerkins, supra, at 297).\n   In concluding that our precedents establish a categorical\nrule, the Court of Appeals placed great weight on the\n6                         HOWES v. FIELDS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndecision in Mathis, but the Court of Appeals misread the\nholding in that case. In Mathis, an inmate in a state\nprison was questioned by an Internal Revenue agent and\nwas subsequently convicted for federal offenses. The\nCourt of Appeals held that Miranda did not apply to this\ninterview for two reasons: A criminal investigation had\nnot been commenced at the time of the interview, and\nthe prisoner was incarcerated for an “unconnected offense.”\nMathis v. United States, 376 F. 2d 595, 597 (CA5 1967).\nThis Court rejected both of those grounds for distinguish-\ning Miranda, 391 U. S., at 4, and thus the holding in\nMathis is simply that a prisoner who otherwise meets the\nrequirements for Miranda custody is not taken outside the\nscope of Miranda by either of the two factors on which\nthe Court of Appeals had relied. Mathis did not hold\nthat imprisonment, in and of itself, is enough to constitute\nMiranda custody.4 Nor, contrary to respondent’s submis-\nsion, see Brief for Respondent 14, did Oregon v. Mathia-\nson, 429 U. S. 492, 494 (1977) (per curiam), which simply\nrestated in dictum the holding in Mathis.\n   The Court of Appeals purported to find support for its\nper se rule in Shatzer, relying on our statement that “[n]o\none questions that Shatzer was in custody for Miranda\npurposes” when he was interviewed. 559 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 13). But this statement means only that the issue\nof custody was not contested before us. It strains credulity\nto read the statement as constituting an “unambiguous\nconclusion” or “finding” by this Court that Shatzer was in\ncustody. 617 F. 3d, at 822.\n   Finally, contrary to respondent’s suggestion, see Brief\nfor Respondent 12–15, Miranda itself did not clearly es-\n\n——————\n    4 Indeed,\n            it is impossible to tell from either the opinion of this Court\nor that of the court below whether the prisoner’s interview was routine\nor whether there were special features that may have created an\nespecially coercive atmosphere.\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntablish the rule applied by the Court of Appeals. Miranda\nadopted a “set of prophylactic measures” designed to ward\noff the “ ‘inherently compelling pressures’ of custodial\ninterrogation,” Shatzer, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 4) (quot-\ning Miranda, 384 U. S., at 467), but Miranda did not hold\nthat such pressures are always present when a prisoner\nis taken aside and questioned about events outside the\nprison walls. Indeed, Miranda did not even establish that\npolice questioning of a suspect at the station house is\nalways custodial. See Mathiason, supra, at 495 (declining\nto find that Miranda warnings are required “simply be-\ncause the questioning takes place in the station house, or\nbecause the questioned person is one whom the police\nsuspect”).\n  In sum, our decisions do not clearly establish that a\nprisoner is always in custody for purposes of Miranda\nwhenever a prisoner is isolated from the general prison\npopulation and questioned about conduct outside the\nprison.5\n——————\n   5 The state-court decision applied the traditional context-specific\n\nanalysis to determine whether the circumstances of respondent’s\ninterrogation gave rise to “the coercive pressure that Miranda was\ndesigned to guard against.” Shatzer, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).\nThe court first observed: “That a defendant is in prison for an unrelated\noffense when being questioned does not, without more, mean that he\nwas in custody for the purpose of determining whether Miranda warn-\nings were required.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 56a (internal quotation\nmarks omitted and emphasis added). In this case, the court noted, the\n“defendant was unquestionably in custody, but on a matter unrelated to\nthe interrogation.” Ibid. The Sixth Circuit concluded that the state\ncourt thereby limited Miranda in a way rejected by Mathis v. United\nStates, 391 U. S. 1 (1968), and “curtail[ed] the warnings to be given\npersons under interrogation by officers based on the reason why the\nperson is in custody.” Id., at 4–5. We think the better reading is that\nthe state court merely meant to draw a distinction between incarcera-\ntion and Miranda custody. This reading is supported by the state\ncourt’s subsequent consideration of whether the facts of the case were\nlikely to create an atmosphere of coercion. App. to Pet. for Cert. 56a.\n8                     HOWES v. FIELDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                            III\n\n  Not only does the categorical rule applied below go well\nbeyond anything that is clearly established in our prior\ndecisions, it is simply wrong. The three elements of that\nrule—(1) imprisonment, (2) questioning in private, and (3)\nquestioning about events in the outside world—are not\nnecessarily enough to create a custodial situation for\nMiranda purposes.\n                             A\n   As used in our Miranda case law, “custody” is a term of\nart that specifies circumstances that are thought generally\nto present a serious danger of coercion. In determining\nwhether a person is in custody in this sense, the initial\nstep is to ascertain whether, in light of “the objective cir-\ncumstances of the interrogation,” Stansbury v. Califor-\nnia, 511 U. S. 318, 322–323, 325 (1994) (per curiam), a\n“reasonable person [would] have felt he or she was not at\nliberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.” Thomp-\nson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99, 112 (1995). And in order to\ndetermine how a suspect would have “gauge[d]” his “free-\ndom of movement,” courts must examine “all of the cir-\ncumstances surrounding the interrogation.” Stansbury,\nsupra, at 322, 325 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nRelevant factors include the location of the questioning,\nsee Shatzer, supra, at ___–___ (slip op., at 13–16), its\nduration, see Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 437–438\n(1984), statements made during the interview, see Mathi-\nason, supra, at 495; Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S.\n652, 665 (2004); Stansbury, supra, at 325, the presence or\nabsence of physical restraints during the questioning, see\nNew York v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649, 655 (1984), and the\nrelease of the interviewee at the end of the questioning,\nsee California v. Beheler, 463 U. S. 1121, 1122–1123\n(1983) (per curiam).\n   Determining whether an individual’s freedom of move-\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nment was curtailed, however, is simply the first step in the\nanalysis, not the last. Not all restraints on freedom of\nmovement amount to custody for purposes of Miranda.\nWe have “decline[d] to accord talismanic power” to the\nfreedom-of-movement inquiry, Berkemer, supra, at 437,\nand have instead asked the additional question whether\nthe relevant environment presents the same inherently\ncoercive pressures as the type of station house questioning\nat issue in Miranda. “Our cases make clear . . . that the\nfreedom-of-movement test identifies only a necessary and\nnot a sufficient condition for Miranda custody.” Shatzer,\n559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).\n   This important point is illustrated by our decision in\nBerkemer v. McCarty, supra. In that case, we held that\nthe roadside questioning of a motorist who was pulled over\nin a routine traffic stop did not constitute custodial inter-\nrogation. Id., at 423, 441–442. We acknowledged that “a\ntraffic stop significantly curtails the ‘freedom of action’ of\nthe driver and the passengers,” and that it is generally “a\ncrime either to ignore a policeman’s signal to stop one’s car\nor, once having stopped, to drive away without permis-\nsion.” Id., at 436. “[F]ew motorists,” we noted, “would feel\nfree either to disobey a directive to pull over or to leave the\nscene of a traffic stop without being told they might do so.”\nIbid. Nevertheless, we held that a person detained as a\nresult of a traffic stop is not in Miranda custody because\nsuch detention does not “sufficiently impair [the detained\nperson’s] free exercise of his privilege against self-\nincrimination to require that he be warned of his consti-\ntutional rights.” 468 U. S., at 437. As we later put it,\nthe “temporary and relatively nonthreatening detention in-\nvolved in a traffic stop or Terry stop does not constitute\nMiranda custody,” Shatzer, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 14)\n(citation omitted). See Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968).\n   It may be thought that the situation in Berkemer—the\nquestioning of a motorist subjected to a brief traffic stop—\n10                    HOWES v. FIELDS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nis worlds away from those present when an inmate is\nquestioned in a prison, but the same cannot be said of\nShatzer, where we again distinguished between restraints\non freedom of movement and Miranda custody. Shatzer,\nas noted, concerned the Edwards prophylactic rule, which\nlimits the ability of the police to initiate further question-\ning of a suspect in Miranda custody once the suspect\ninvokes the right to counsel. We held in Shatzer that this\nrule does not apply when there is a sufficient break in\ncustody between the suspect’s invocation of the right to\ncounsel and the initiation of subsequent questioning. See\n559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13-16). And, what is signifi-\ncant for present purposes, we further held that a break\nin custody may occur while a suspect is serving a term in\nprison. If a break in custody can occur while a prisoner is\nserving an uninterrupted term of imprisonment, it must\nfollow that imprisonment alone is not enough to create a\ncustodial situation within the meaning of Miranda.\n   There are at least three strong grounds for this conclu-\nsion. First, questioning a person who is already serving a\nprison term does not generally involve the shock that very\noften accompanies arrest. In the paradigmatic Miranda\nsituation—a person is arrested in his home or on the\nstreet and whisked to a police station for questioning—\ndetention represents a sharp and ominous change, and the\nshock may give rise to coercive pressures. A person who is\n“cut off from his normal life and companions,” Shatzer,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 7), and abruptly transported from\nthe street into a “police-dominated atmosphere,” Miranda,\n384 U. S., at 456, may feel coerced into answering\nquestions.\n   By contrast, when a person who is already serving a\nterm of imprisonment is questioned, there is usually no\nsuch change. “Interrogated suspects who have previously\nbeen convicted of crime live in prison.” Shatzer, 559 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 14). For a person serving a term of\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nincarceration, we reasoned in Shatzer, the ordinary re-\nstrictions of prison life, while no doubt unpleasant, are\nexpected and familiar and thus do not involve the same\n“inherently compelling pressures” that are often present\nwhen a suspect is yanked from familiar surroundings in\nthe outside world and subjected to interrogation in a police\nstation. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4).\n  Second, a prisoner, unlike a person who has not been\nsentenced to a term of incarceration, is unlikely to be\nlured into speaking by a longing for prompt release. When\na person is arrested and taken to a station house for inter-\nrogation, the person who is questioned may be pressured\nto speak by the hope that, after doing so, he will be al-\nlowed to leave and go home. On the other hand, when a\nprisoner is questioned, he knows that when the question-\ning ceases, he will remain under confinement. Id., at ___–\n___, n. 8 (slip op., at 14–15, n. 8).\n  Third, a prisoner, unlike a person who has not been\nconvicted and sentenced, knows that the law enforcement\nofficers who question him probably lack the authority to\naffect the duration of his sentence. Id., at ___–___ (slip\nop., at 14–15). And “where the possibility of parole exists,”\nthe interrogating officers probably also lack the power to\nbring about an early release. Ibid. “When the suspect has\nno reason to think that the listeners have official power\nover him, it should not be assumed that his words are\nmotivated by the reaction he expects from his listeners.”\nPerkins, 496 U. S., at 297. Under such circumstances,\nthere is little “basis for the assumption that a suspect . . .\nwill feel compelled to speak by the fear of reprisal for\nremaining silent or in the hope of [a] more lenient treat-\nment should he confess.” Id., at 296–297.\n  In short, standard conditions of confinement and associ-\nated restrictions on freedom will not necessarily implicate\nthe same interests that the Court sought to protect when\nit afforded special safeguards to persons subjected to\n12                    HOWES v. FIELDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncustodial interrogation. Thus, service of a term of impris-\nonment, without more, is not enough to constitute Miran-\nda custody.\n                               B\n   The two other elements included in the Court of Ap-\npeals’ rule—questioning in private and questioning about\nevents that took place outside the prison—are likewise\ninsufficient.\n   Taking a prisoner aside for questioning—as opposed\nto questioning the prisoner in the presence of fellow in-\nmates—does not necessarily convert a “noncustodial situa-\ntion . . . to one in which Miranda applies.” Mathiason, 429\nU. S., at 495. When a person who is not serving a prison\nterm is questioned, isolation may contribute to a coercive\natmosphere by preventing family members, friends, and\nothers who may be sympathetic from providing either\nadvice or emotional support. And without any such assis-\ntance, the person who is questioned may feel overwhelm-\ning pressure to speak and to refrain from asking that the\ninterview be terminated.\n   By contrast, questioning a prisoner in private does not\ngenerally remove the prisoner from a supportive atmos-\nphere. Fellow inmates are by no means necessarily\nfriends. On the contrary, they may be hostile and, for a\nvariety of reasons, may react negatively to what the ques-\ntioning reveals. In the present case, for example, would\nrespondent have felt more at ease if he had been ques-\ntioned in the presence of other inmates about the sexual\nabuse of an adolescent boy? Isolation from the general\nprison population is often in the best interest of the inter-\nviewee and, in any event, does not suggest on its own\nthe atmosphere of coercion that concerned the Court in\nMiranda.\n   It is true that taking a prisoner aside for questioning\nmay necessitate some additional limitations on his free-\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndom of movement. A prisoner may, for example, be re-\nmoved from an exercise yard and taken, under close\nguard, to the room where the interview is to be held. But\nsuch procedures are an ordinary and familiar attribute of\nlife behind bars. Escorts and special security precautions\nmay be standard procedures regardless of the purpose for\nwhich an inmate is removed from his regular routine and\ntaken to a special location. For example, ordinary prison\nprocedure may require such measures when a prisoner is\nled to a meeting with an attorney.\n   Finally, we fail to see why questioning about criminal\nactivity outside the prison should be regarded as having a\nsignificantly greater potential for coercion than question-\ning under otherwise identical circumstances about crimi-\nnal activity within the prison walls. In both instances,\nthere is the potential for additional criminal liability and\npunishment. If anything, the distinction would seem to\ncut the other way, as an inmate who confesses to miscon-\nduct that occurred within the prison may also incur ad-\nministrative penalties, but even this is not enough to tip\nthe scale in the direction of custody. “The threat to a\ncitizen’s Fifth Amendment rights that Miranda was de-\nsigned to neutralize” is neither mitigated nor magnified by\nthe location of the conduct about which questions are\nasked. Berkemer, 468 U. S., at 435, n. 22.\n   For these reasons, the Court of Appeals’ categorical rule\nis unsound.\n                             IV \n\n                              A\n\n   When a prisoner is questioned, the determination of\ncustody should focus on all of the features of the interroga-\ntion. These include the language that is used in summon-\ning the prisoner to the interview and the manner in which\nthe interrogation is conducted. See Yarborough, 541 U. S.,\nat 665. An inmate who is removed from the general prison\n14                    HOWES v.

S., at 440.\n   “Fidelity to the doctrine announced in Miranda requires\nthat it be enforced strictly, but only in those types of situa-\ntions in which the concerns that powered the decision are\nimplicated.” Id., at 437; see Shatzer, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 9); Mathiason, supra, at 495. Confessions voluntar-\nily made by prisoners in other situations should not be\nsuppressed. “Voluntary confessions are not merely a\nproper element in law enforcement, they are an unmiti-\ngated good, essential to society’s compelling interest in\nfinding, convicting, and punishing those who violate the\nlaw.” Shatzer, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 9) (internal quota-\ntion marks and citations omitted).\n                              B\n   The record in this case reveals that respondent was not\ntaken into custody for purposes of Miranda. To be sure,\nrespondent did not invite the interview or consent to it in\nadvance, and he was not advised that he was free to de-\ncline to speak with the deputies. The following facts also\nlend some support to respondent’s argument that Miran-\nda’s custody requirement was met: The interview lasted\nfor between five and seven hours in the evening and con-\ntinued well past the hour when respondent generally went\nto bed; the deputies who questioned respondent were\narmed; and one of the deputies, according to respondent,\n“[u]sed a very sharp tone,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 76a, and,\non one occasion, profanity, see id., at 77a.\n   These circumstances, however, were offset by others.\nMost important, respondent was told at the outset of the\ninterrogation, and was reminded again thereafter, that he\ncould leave and go back to his cell whenever he wanted.\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                  15\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nSee id., at 89a–90a (“I was told I could get up and leave\nwhenever I wanted”); id., at 70a–71a. Moreover, respond-\nent was not physically restrained or threatened and was\ninterviewed in a well-lit, average-sized conference room,\nwhere he was “not uncomfortable.” Id., at 90a; see id., at\n71a, 88a–89a. He was offered food and water, and the\ndoor to the conference room was sometimes left open. See\nid., at 70a, 74a. “All of these objective facts are consistent\nwith an interrogation environment in which a reasonable\nperson would have felt free to terminate the interview and\nleave.” Yarborough, supra, at 664–665.\n   Because he was in prison, respondent was not free to\nleave the conference room by himself and to make his own\nway through the facility to his cell. Instead, he was es-\ncorted to the conference room and, when he ultimately\ndecided to end the interview, he had to wait about 20\nminutes for a corrections officer to arrive and escort him to\nhis cell. But he would have been subject to this same\nrestraint even if he had been taken to the conference room\nfor some reason other than police questioning; under no\ncircumstances could he have reasonably expected to be\nable to roam free.6 And while respondent testified that he\n——————\n    6 Respondent did not testify to the contrary.

App. to Pet. for Cert. 71a;\nsee id., at 89a (“I was told, if I didn’t want to cooperate,\nI could leave”). Returning to his cell would merely have\nreturned him to his usual environment. See Shatzer,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 14) (“Interrogated suspects who\nhave previously been convicted of crime live in prison.\nWhen they are released back into the general prison popu-\nlation, they return to their accustomed surroundings and\ndaily routine—they regain the degree of control they had\nover their lives prior to the interrogation”).\n  Taking into account all of the circumstances of the\nquestioning—including especially the undisputed fact that\nrespondent was told that he was free to end the question-\ning and to return to his cell—we hold that respondent was\nnot in custody within the meaning of Miranda.\n                         *    *     * \n\n     The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n                                                             Reversed.\n\n—————— \n\n“Q.

RANDALL\n               LEE FIELDS\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                     [February 21, 2012]\n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER and\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join, concurring in part and dissent-\ning in part.\n   Given this Court’s controlling decisions on what counts\nas “custody” for Miranda purposes, I agree that the law is\nnot “clearly established” in respondent Fields’s favor. See,\ne.g., Maryland v. Shatzer, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip\nop., at 13–16); Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99, 112\n(1995). But I disagree with the Court’s further determina-\ntion that Fields was not in custody under Miranda. Were\nthe case here on direct review, I would vote to hold that\nMiranda precludes the State’s introduction of Fields’s\nconfession as evidence against him.\n   Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), reacted to\npolice interrogation tactics that eroded the Fifth Amend-\nment’s ban on compulsory self-incrimination. The opinion\ndid so by requiring interrogators to convey to suspects\nthe now-familiar warnings: The suspect is to be informed,\nprior to interrogation, that he “has a right to remain si-\nlent, that any statement he does make may be used as\nevidence against him, and that he has a right to the pres-\nence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.” Id., at\n444.\n   Under what circumstances are Miranda warnings re-\nquired? Miranda tells us “in all settings in which [a per-\n2                     HOWES v. FIELDS\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nson’s] freedom of action is curtailed in any significant\nway.” Id., at 467. Given the reality that police interroga-\ntors “trad[e] on the weakness of individuals,” i.e., their\n“insecurity about [themselves] or [their] surroundings,”\nid., at 455, the Court found the preinterrogation warnings\nset out in the opinion “indispensable,” id., at 469. Those\nwarnings, the Court elaborated, are “an absolute prerequi-\nsite in overcoming the inherent pressures of the interroga-\ntion atmosphere,” id., at 468; they “insure” that the sus-\npect is timely told of his Fifth Amendment privilege, and\nhis freedom to exercise it, id., at 469.\n   Fields, serving time for disorderly conduct, was, of\ncourse, “i[n] custody,” but not “for purposes of Miranda,”\nthe Court concludes. Ante, at 14. I would not train, as the\nCourt does, on the question whether there can be custody\nwithin custody. Instead, I would ask, as Miranda put it,\nwhether Fields was subjected to “incommunicado interro-\ngation . . . in a police-dominated atmosphere,” 384 U. S., at\n445, whether he was placed, against his will, in an inher-\nently stressful situation, see id., at 468, and whether his\n“freedom of action [was] curtailed in any significant way,”\nid., at 467. Those should be the key questions, and to each\nI would answer “Yes.”\n   As the Court acknowledges, Fields did not invite or\nconsent to the interview. Ante, at 14. He was removed\nfrom his cell in the evening, taken to a conference room in\nthe sheriff ’s quarters, and questioned by two armed depu-\nties long into the night and early morning. Ibid. He was\nnot told at the outset that he had the right to decline to\nspeak with the deputies. Ibid. Shut in with the armed\nofficers, Fields felt “trapped.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 71a.\nAlthough told he could return to his cell if he did not want\nto cooperate, id., at 71a–72a, Fields believed the deputies\n“would not have allowed [him] to leave the room,” id., at\n72a. And with good reason. More than once, “he told the\nofficers . . . he did not want to speak with them anymore.”\n                   Cite as: 565 U.

He was given water, App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 74a, but not his evening medications,\nid., at 79a.* Yet the Court concludes that Fields was in\n“an interrogation environment in which a reasonable person\nwould have felt free to terminate the interview and leave.”\nAnte, at 15 (quoting Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S.\n652, 665 (2004)).\n  Critical to the Court’s judgment is “the undisputed fact\nthat [Fields] was told that he was free to end the question-\ning and to return to his cell.” Ante, at 17. Never mind\nthe facts suggesting that Fields’s submission to the over-\nnight interview was anything but voluntary. Was Fields\n“held for interrogation”? See Miranda, 384 U. S., at 471.\nBrought to, and left alone with, the gun-bearing deputies,\nhe surely was in my judgment.\n  Miranda instructed that such a person “must be clearly\ninformed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer\nand to have the lawyer with him during interrogation.”\nIbid. Those warnings, along with “warnings of the right\nto remain silent and that anything stated can be used in\nevidence against [the speaker],” Miranda explained, are\nnecessary “prerequisite[s] to [an] interrogation” compati-\nble with the Fifth Amendment. Ibid. Today, for people\nalready in prison, the Court finds it adequate for the police\nto say: “You are free to terminate this interrogation and\nreturn to your cell.” Such a statement is no substitute for\none ensuring that an individual is aware of his rights.\n  For the reasons stated, I would hold that the “incommu-\nnicado interrogation [of Fields] in a police-dominated\natmosphere,” id., at 445, without informing him of his\nrights, dishonored the Fifth Amendment privilege Miran-\nda was designed to safeguard.\n——————\n  * Each night, Fields took an antidepressant and, due to his kidney\ntransplant surgery, two antirejection medications.
