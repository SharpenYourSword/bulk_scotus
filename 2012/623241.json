MONTANA\r\n\r\n       CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MONTANA\r\n\r\n  No. 10–218.     Argued December 7, 2011—Decided February 22, 2012\r\nPetitioner PPL Montana, LLC (PPL), owns and operates hydroelectric\r\n  facilities in Montana. Ten of its facilities are located on riverbeds\r\n  underlying segments of the Missouri, Madison, and Clark Fork Riv-\r\n  ers. Five hydroelectric dams on the Upper Missouri River are along\r\n  the Great Falls reach, including on the three tallest waterfalls; and\r\n  PPL’s two other dams on that river are in canyons on the Stubbs Fer-\r\n  ry stretch. These, together with two dams located in steep canyons\r\n  on the Madison River, are called the Missouri-Madison project. The\r\n  Thompson Falls project is a facility on the Clark Fork River. Both\r\n  projects are licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\r\n  PPL’s facilities have existed for many decades, some for over a centu-\r\n  ry. Until recently, Montana, though aware of the projects’ existence,\r\n  sought no rent for use of the riverbeds. Instead, the understanding of\r\n  PPL and the United States is that PPL has paid rents to the United\r\n  States. In 2003, parents of Montana schoolchildren filed a federal\r\n  suit, claiming that PPL’s facilities were on riverbeds that were state\r\n  owned and part of Montana’s school trust lands. The State joined the\r\n  suit and, for the first time, sought rents from PPL for its use of the\r\n  riverbeds. That case was dismissed, and PPL and other power com-\r\n  panies filed a state-court suit, claiming that Montana was barred\r\n  from seeking compensation for PPL’s riverbed use. Montana coun-\r\n  terclaimed, contending that under the equal-footing doctrine it owns\r\n  the riverbeds and can charge rent for their use. The trial court\r\n  granted Montana summary judgment as to navigability for purposes\r\n  of determining riverbed title and ordered PPL to pay Montana $41\r\n  million in rent for riverbed use between 2000 and 2007. The Mon-\r\n  tana Supreme Court affirmed. Adopting a liberal construction of the\r\n  navigability test, it discounted this Court’s approach of considering\r\n  the navigability of particular river segments for purposes of deter-\r\n2                  PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                                  Syllabus\r\n\r\n    mining whether a State acquired title to the riverbeds underlying\r\n    those segments at the time of statehood. Instead, the Montana court\r\n    declared the river stretches in question to be short interruptions of\r\n    navigability that were insufficient as a matter of law to find nonnavi-\r\n    gability, since traffic had circumvented those stretches by portage.\r\n    Based on evidence of present-day, recreational use of the Madison\r\n    River, the court found that river navigable as a matter of law at the\r\n    time of statehood.\r\nHeld: The Montana Supreme Court’s ruling that Montana owns and\r\n may charge for use of the riverbeds at issue was based on an infirm\r\n legal understanding of this Court’s rules of navigability for title un-\r\n der the equal-footing doctrine. Pp. 10–26.\r\n    (a) The rule that the States, in their capacity as sovereigns, hold\r\n “title in the soil of rivers really navigable,” Shively v. Bowlby, 152\r\n U. S. 1, 31, has federal constitutional significance under the equal-\r\n footing doctrine. Pursuant to that doctrine, upon its date of state-\r\n hood, a State gains title within its borders to the beds of waters then\r\n navigable. It may allocate and govern those lands according to state\r\n law subject only to the United States’ power “to control such waters\r\n for purposes of navigation in interstate and foreign commerce.” Unit-\r\n ed States v. Oregon, 295 U. S. 1, 14. The United States retains title\r\n vested in it before statehood to land beneath waters not then naviga-\r\n ble. To be navigable for purposes of title under the equal-footing doc-\r\n trine, rivers must be “navigable in fact,” meaning “they are used, or\r\n are susceptible of being used, . . . as highways for commerce, over\r\n which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary\r\n modes of trade and travel on water.” The Daniel Ball, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n 563. This formulation has been used to determine questions of wa-\r\n terbed title under the equal-footing doctrine. See United States v.\r\n Utah, 283 U. S. 64, 76. Pp. 10–14.\r\n    (b) The Montana Supreme Court erred in its treatment of the ques-\r\n tion of river segments and portage. To determine riverbed title under\r\n the equal-footing doctrine, this Court considers the river on a seg-\r\n ment-by-segment basis to assess whether the segment of the river,\r\n under which the riverbed in dispute lies, is navigable or not. See,\r\n e.g., Utah, supra, at 77. The State Supreme Court erred in discount-\r\n ing this well-settled approach. A key justification for sovereign own-\r\n ership of navigable riverbeds is that a contrary rule would allow pri-\r\n vate riverbed owners to erect improvements on the riverbeds that\r\n could interfere with the public’s right to use the waters as a highway\r\n for commerce. Because commerce could not have occurred on seg-\r\n ments nonnavigable at the time of statehood, there is no reason to\r\n deem those segments owned by the State under the equal-footing\r\n doctrine. Practical considerations also support segmentation. Physi-\r\n                   Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\r\n\r\n                              Syllabus\r\n\r\ncal conditions affecting navigability vary over the length of a river\r\nand provide a means to determine appropriate start points and end\r\npoints for disputed segments. A segment approach is also consistent\r\nwith the manner in which private parties seek to establish riverbed\r\ntitle. Montana cannot suggest that segmentation is inadministrable\r\nwhen the state courts managed to apportion the underlying riverbeds\r\nfor purposes of determining their value and PPL’s corresponding\r\nrents. The State Supreme Court’s view that the segment-by-segment\r\napproach does not apply to short interruptions of navigability is not\r\nsupported by this Court’s Utah decision. Even if the law might find\r\nsome nonnavigable segments so minimal that they merit treatment\r\nas part of a longer, navigable reach, it is doubtful that the segments\r\nin this case would meet that standard. Applying its “short interrup-\r\ntions” approach, the State Supreme Court found the Great Falls\r\nreach navigable because it could be managed by way of land route\r\nportage, as done by Lewis and Clark. But a portage of even one day\r\nwould demonstrate the need to bypass a nonnavigable river segment.\r\nThus, the State Supreme Court was wrong to conclude, with respect\r\nto the Great Falls reach and other disputed stretches, that portages\r\nwere insufficient to defeat a navigability finding. In most cases, they\r\nare, because they require transportation over land rather than over\r\nthe water. This is the case at least as to the Great Falls reach. In\r\nreaching a contrary conclusion, the State Supreme Court misapplied\r\nThe Montello, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. There, portage was considered in deter-\r\nmining whether a river was part of a channel of interstate commerce\r\nfor federal regulatory purposes. The Montello does not control the\r\noutcome where the quite different concerns of the riverbed title con-\r\ntext apply. Portages may defeat navigability for title purposes, and\r\ndo so with respect to the Great Falls reach. Montana does not dis-\r\npute that overland portage was necessary to traverse that reach, and\r\nthe trial court noted the waterfalls had never been navigated. The\r\nGreat Falls reach, at least from the head of the first waterfall to the\r\nfoot of the last, is not navigable for purposes of riverbed title under\r\nthe equal-footing doctrine. There is also a significant likelihood that\r\nsome of the other river stretches in dispute fail this federal navigabil-\r\nity test. The ultimate decision as to these other disputed river\r\nstretches is to be determined, in the first instance, by the Montana\r\ncourts on remand, which should assess the relevant evidence in light\r\nof the principles discussed here. Pp. 14–21.\r\n   (c) The Montana Supreme Court further erred as a matter of law in\r\nrelying on evidence of present-day, primarily recreational use of the\r\nMadison River. Navigability must be assessed as of the time of\r\nstatehood, and it concerns a river’s usefulness for “ ‘trade and trav-\r\nel.’ ” Utah, 283 U. S., at 75–76. River segments are navigable if they\r\n4                   PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                                   Syllabus\r\n\r\n    “ ‘[were]’ ” used and if they “ ‘[were] susceptible of being used’ ” as\r\n    highways of commerce at the time of statehood. Id., at 76. Evidence\r\n    of recreational use and poststatehood evidence may bear on suscepti-\r\n    bility of commercial use at the time of statehood. See id., at 82–83.\r\n    In order for present-day use to have a bearing on navigability at\r\n    statehood, (1) the watercraft must be meaningfully similar to those in\r\n    customary use for trade and travel at the time of statehood, and\r\n    (2) the river’s poststatehood condition may not be materially different\r\n    from its physical condition at statehood. The State Supreme Court\r\n    offered no indication that it made these necessary findings. Pp. 21–\r\n    24.\r\n        (d) Because this analysis is sufficient to require reversal here, the\r\n    Court declines to decide whether the State Supreme Court also erred\r\n    as to the burden of proof regarding navigability. P. 24.\r\n        (e) Montana’s suggestion that denying the State title to the disput-\r\n    ed riverbeds will undermine the public trust doctrine—which con-\r\n    cerns public access to the waters above those beds for navigation,\r\n    fishing, and other recreational uses—underscores its misapprehen-\r\n    sion of the equal-footing and public trust doctrines. Unlike the equal-\r\n    footing doctrine, which is the constitutional foundation for the navi-\r\n    gability rule of riverbed title, the scope of the public trust over waters\r\n    within the State’s borders is a matter of state law, subject to federal\r\n    regulatory power. Pp. 24–25.\r\n        (f) This Court does not reach the question whether, by virtue of\r\n    Montana’s sovereignty, neither laches nor estoppel could apply to bar\r\n    the State’s claim. Still, the reliance by PPL and its predecessors in ti-\r\n    tle on the State’s long failure to assert title to the riverbeds is some\r\n    evidence supporting the conclusion that the river segments over\r\n    those beds were nonnavigable for purposes of the equal-footing doc-\r\n    trine.

MONTANA\r\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\r\n\r\n                      MONTANA\r\n\r\n                              [February 22, 2012]\r\n\r\n\r\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\r\n   This case concerns three rivers which flow through\r\nMontana and then beyond its borders. The question is\r\nwhether discrete, identifiable segments of these rivers in\r\nMontana were nonnavigable, as federal law defines that\r\nconcept for purposes of determining whether the State\r\nacquired title to the riverbeds underlying those segments,\r\nwhen the State entered the Union in 1889. Montana\r\ncontends that the rivers must be found navigable at the\r\ndisputed locations. From this premise, the State asserts\r\nthat in 1889 it gained title to the disputed riverbeds under\r\nthe constitutional equal-footing doctrine. Based on its\r\ntitle claims, Montana sought compensation from PPL\r\nMontana, LLC, a power company, for its use of the riv­\r\nerbeds for hydroelectric projects. The Montana courts\r\ngranted summary judgment on title to Montana, awarding\r\nit $41 million in rent for the riverbeds for the period from\r\n2000 to 2007 alone. That judgment must be reversed.\r\n                             I\r\n  The three rivers in question are the Missouri River, the\r\nMadison River, and the Clark Fork River. The Missouri\r\nand the Madison are on the eastern side of the Continen­\r\n2             PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ntal Divide. The Madison flows into the Missouri, which\r\nthen continues at length to its junction with the Missis­\r\nsippi River. The Clark Fork River is on the western side\r\nof the Continental Divide. Its waters join the Columbia\r\nRiver system that flows into the Pacific Ocean. Each river\r\nshall be described in somewhat more detail.\r\n                             A\r\n   The Missouri River originates in Montana and traverses\r\nseven States before a point just north of St. Louis where\r\nit joins the Mississippi. 19 Encyclopedia Americana 270\r\n(int’l ed. 2006). If considered with the continuous path\r\nformed by certain streams that provide the Missouri Riv­\r\ner’s headwaters, the Missouri is over 2,500 miles long, the\r\nlongest river in the United States.

While one usually\r\nthinks of the Missouri River as flowing generally south, as\r\nindeed it does beginning in North Dakota, the Upper\r\nMissouri in Montana flows north from its principal head­\r\nwaters at Three Forks, which is located about 4,000 feet\r\nabove sea level in the Rocky Mountain area of southwest­\r\nern Montana.

In 1891, just after Mon­\r\ntana became a State, the Upper Missouri River above Fort\r\nBenton was “seriously obstructed by numerous rapids and\r\nrocks,” and the 168-mile portion flowing eastward “[f]rom\r\nFort Benton to Carroll, Mont., [was] called the rocky riv­\r\ner.” Annual Report of the Chief of Engineers, U.

They consist of five cascade-like\r\nwaterfalls located over a stretch of the Upper Missouri\r\nleading downstream from the city of Great Falls in mid­\r\nwestern Montana. The waterfall farthest downstream,\r\nand the one first encountered by Meriwether Lewis and\r\nWilliam Clark when they led their remarkable expedition\r\nthrough the American West in 1805, is the eponymous\r\n“Great Falls,” the tallest of the five falls at 87 feet.

Despite the falls’ beauty, Lewis could see that\r\ntheir steep cliffs and swift waters would impede progress\r\non the river, which had been the expedition’s upstream\r\ncourse for so many months. The party proceeded over a\r\nmore circuitous land route by means of portage, circum­\r\nventing the Great Falls and their surrounding reach of\r\nriver before returning to travel upon the river about a\r\nmonth later.

Named by\r\nLewis and Clark for then-Secretary of State James Madi­\r\nson, the Madison River courses west out of the Northern\r\nRocky Mountains of Wyoming and Montana in what is\r\nnow Yellowstone National Park, then runs north and\r\nmerges with the Jefferson and Gallatin Rivers at Three\r\nForks, Montana, to form the Upper Missouri.

S. Geological Survey, J. Stevens\r\n& F. Henshaw, Surface Water Supply of the United\r\nStates, 1907–8, Water-Supply Paper 252, pp. 81–82\r\n(1910). The river flows northward for about 40 miles;\r\nturns northwest for a stretch; then turns abruptly north­\r\neast for a short stint, by which time it has descended\r\nnearly 2,500 feet in altitude. It then resumes a north­\r\nwestward course until it empties into Lake Pend Oreille in\r\nnorthern Idaho, out of which flows a tributary to the Co­\r\nlumbia River of the Pacific Northwest. Ibid.; 1 Columbia\r\nGazetteer 816. The Clark Fork is “one of the wildest and\r\nmost picturesque streams in the West,” marked by “many\r\nwaterfalls and boxed gorges.” Federal Writers’ Projects of\r\nthe Works Progress Administration, Idaho: A Guide in\r\nWord and Picture 230 (2d ed. 1950).\r\n  Lewis and Clark knew of the Clark Fork River but did\r\nnot try to navigate it, in part because the absence of salm­\r\non in one of its tributaries made Lewis believe “ ‘there\r\nmust be a considerable fall in [the river] below.’ ” H. Fritz,\r\nThe Lewis and Clark Expedition 38–39 (2004). This was\r\ncorrect, for shortly before the Clark Fork exits to Idaho\r\nfrom the northwest corner of Montana, “the waters of the\r\nriver dash madly along their rocky bed,” dropping over 30\r\nfeet in a half-mile as they rush over falls and rapids in­\r\ncluding a “foaming waterfall” now known as Thompson\r\nFalls.

Ten of its facilities are built upon riverbeds\r\nunderlying segments of the Upper Missouri, Madison, and\r\nClark Fork Rivers. It is these beds to which title is\r\ndisputed.\r\n   On the Upper Missouri River, PPL has seven hydroelec­\r\ntric dams. Five of them are along the Great Falls reach,\r\nincluding on the three tallest falls; and the other two are\r\nin canyons upstream on the Stubbs Ferry stretch. See K.\r\nRobison, Cascade County and Great Falls 56 (2011); Aar­\r\nstad et al., supra, at 125, 119, 145–146. On the Madison\r\nRiver, two hydroelectric dams are located in steep can­\r\nyons. On the Clark Fork River, a hydroelectric facility is\r\nconstructed on the Thompson Falls.\r\n   The dams on the Upper Missouri and Madison are\r\ncalled the Missouri-Madison project. The Thompson Falls\r\nfacility is called the Thompson Falls project. Both projects\r\nare licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commis­\r\nsion. PPL acquired them in 1999 from its predecessor, the\r\nMontana Power Company. 355 Mont., at 405–406, 229\r\nP. 3d, at 426.\r\n   PPL’s power facilities have existed at their locations for\r\nmany decades, some for over a century. See Robison,\r\nsupra, at 40 (Black Eagle Falls dam constructed by 1891).\r\nUntil recently, these facilities were operated without title­\r\nbased objection by the State of Montana. The State was\r\nwell aware of the facilities’ existence on the riverbeds—\r\nindeed, various Montana state agencies had participated\r\nin federal licensing proceedings for these hydroelectric\r\nprojects. See, e.g., Montana Power Co., 8 F. P. C. 751, 752\r\n(1949) (Thompson Falls project); Montana Power Co., 27\r\nFERC ¶62,097, pp. 63,188–63,189 (1984) (Ryan Dam of\r\n8              PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nMissouri-Madison project). Yet the State did not seek, and\r\naccordingly PPL and its predecessor did not pay, compen­\r\nsation for use of the riverbeds. 355 Mont., at 406, 229\r\nP. 3d, at 427. Instead, the understanding of PPL and the\r\nUnited States is that PPL has been paying rents to the\r\nUnited States for use of those riverbeds, as well as for use\r\nof river uplands flooded by PPL’s projects. Reply Brief for\r\nPetitioner 4; App. to Supp. Brief for Petitioner 4–5; Brief\r\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 3, n. 3.\r\n   In 2003, parents of Montana schoolchildren sued PPL in\r\nthe United States District Court for the District of Mon­\r\ntana, arguing that PPL had built its facilities on riverbeds\r\nthat were state owned and part of Montana’s school trust\r\nlands. 355 Mont., at 406, 229 P. 3d, at 426. Prompted\r\nby the litigation, the State joined the lawsuit, for the first\r\ntime seeking rents for PPL’s riverbed use. The case was\r\ndismissed in September 2005 for lack of diversity juris-\r\ndiction. Dolan v. PPL Montana, LLC, No. 9:03–cv–167\r\n(D Mont., Sept. 27, 2005).\r\n   PPL and two other power companies sued the State of\r\nMontana in the First Judicial District Court of Montana,\r\narguing that the State was barred from seeking compensa­\r\ntion for use of the riverbeds. 355 Mont., at 407–408, 229\r\nP. 3d, at 427–428. By counterclaim, the State sought a\r\ndeclaration that under the equal-footing doctrine it owns\r\nthe riverbeds used by PPL and can charge rent for their\r\nuse. Id., at 408, 229 P. 3d, at 428. The Montana trial\r\ncourt granted summary judgment to Montana as to navi­\r\ngability for purposes of determining riverbed title. Id., at\r\n408–409, 413–414, 229 P. 3d, at 428, 431–432; App. to Pet.\r\nfor Cert. 143. The court decided that the State owned the\r\nriverbeds. 355 Mont., at 428–429, 229 P. 3d, at 440. The\r\ncourt ordered PPL to pay $40,956,180 in rent for use of\r\nthe riverbeds between 2000 and 2007. Id., at 431–432,\r\n229 P. 3d, at 442–443.

App. to Pet. for Cert. 128–129.\r\n   In a decision by a divided court, the Montana Supreme\r\nCourt affirmed. 355 Mont., at 461–462, 229 P. 3d, at 460–\r\n461; id., at 462, 229 P. 3d, at 461 (dissenting opinion).\r\nThe court reasoned from the background principle that\r\n“navigability for title purposes is very liberally construed.”\r\nId., at 438, 229 P. 3d, at 446. It dismissed as having\r\n“limited applicability” this Court’s approach of assessing\r\nthe navigability of the disputed segment of the river ra­\r\nther than the river as a whole. Id., at 441–442, 229 P. 3d,\r\nat 448–449. The Montana court accepted that certain\r\nrelevant stretches of the rivers were not navigable but\r\ndeclared them “merely short interruptions” insufficient as\r\na matter of law to find nonnavigability, since traffic had\r\ncircumvented those stretches by overland portage. Id.,\r\nat 438, 442, 229 P. 3d, at 446, 449. Placing extensive\r\nreliance upon evidence of present-day use of the Madison\r\nRiver, the court found that river navigable as a matter of\r\nlaw at the time of statehood. Id., at 439, 229 P. 3d, at 447.\r\n   Justice Rice dissented. Id., at 462, 229 P. 3d, at 461.\r\nHe stated that “courts are not to assume an entire river is\r\nnavigable merely because certain reaches of the river are\r\nnavigable.” Id., at 464, 229 P. 3d, at 462. The majority\r\nerred, he wrote, in rejecting the “section-by-section ap­\r\nproach” and “declaring, as a matter of law, that the\r\nreaches claimed by PPL to be non-navigable are simply too\r\n‘short’ to matter,” when in fact PPL’s evidence showed the\r\n“disputed reaches of the rivers were, at the time of state­\r\nhood, non-navigable.” Id., at 463–466, 476–477, 229 P. 3d,\r\nat 462–464, 470.\r\n   This Court granted certiorari, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), and\r\nnow reverses the judgment.\r\n10            PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n                               III\r\n\r\n                                A\r\n\r\n   PPL contends the opinion of the Montana Supreme\r\nCourt is flawed in three respects: first, the court’s failure\r\nto consider with care the navigability of the particular\r\nriver segments to which title is disputed, and its disregard\r\nof the necessary overland portage around some of those\r\nsegments; second, its misplaced reliance upon evidence of\r\npresent-day, recreational use; and third, what the state\r\ncourt itself called its liberal construction of the navigabil­\r\nity test, which did not place the burden of proof upon\r\nthe State to show navigability. Brief for Petitioner 26. The\r\nUnited States as amicus is in substantial agreement with\r\nPPL’s arguments, although it offers a more extended dis­\r\ncussion with respect to evidence of present-day, recrea­\r\ntional use. Brief for United States 27–33.\r\n   It is appropriate to begin the analysis by discussing the\r\nlegal principles that control the case.\r\n                             B\r\n  The rule that the States, in their capacity as sovereigns,\r\nhold title to the beds under navigable waters has origins\r\nin English common law. See Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U. S.\r\n1, 13 (1894). A distinction was made in England between\r\nwaters subject to the ebb and flow of the tide (royal rivers)\r\nand nontidal waters (public highways). With respect to\r\nroyal rivers, the Crown was presumed to hold title to the\r\nriverbed and soil, but the public retained the right of\r\npassage and the right to fish in the stream. With respect\r\nto public highways, as the name suggests, the public also\r\nretained the right of water passage; but title to the riv­\r\nerbed and soil, as a general matter, was held in private\r\nownership. Riparian landowners shared title, with each\r\nowning from his side to the center thread of the stream, as\r\nwell as the exclusive right to fish there.

Kent,\r\nCommentaries on American Law 528–529 (9th ed. 1858).\r\n   While the tide-based distinction for bed title was the\r\ninitial rule in the 13 Colonies, after the Revolution Ameri­\r\ncan law moved to a different standard. Some state courts\r\ncame early to the conclusion that a State holds presump­\r\ntive title to navigable waters whether or not the waters\r\nare subject to the ebb and flow of the tide.

The tidal rule of\r\n“navigability” for sovereign ownership of riverbeds, while\r\nperhaps appropriate for England’s dominant coastal geog­\r\nraphy, was ill suited to the United States with its vast\r\nnumber of major inland rivers upon which navigation\r\ncould be sustained. See L. Houck, Law of Navigable Riv­\r\ners 26–27, 31–35 (1868); Packer v. Bird, 137 U. S. 661,\r\n667–669 (1891). By the late 19th century, the Court had\r\nrecognized “the now prevailing doctrine” of state sovereign\r\n“title in the soil of rivers really navigable.” Shively, supra,\r\nat 31; see Barney v. Keokuk, 94 U. S. 324, 336 (1877) (“In\r\nthis country, as a general thing, all waters are deemed\r\nnavigable which are really so”). This title rule became\r\nknown as “navigability in fact.”\r\n   The rule for state riverbed title assumed federal consti­\r\ntutional significance under the equal-footing doctrine. In\r\n1842, the Court declared that for the 13 original States,\r\nthe people of each State, based on principles of sovereign­\r\nty, “hold the absolute right to all their navigable waters\r\nand the soils under them,” subject only to rights surren­\r\ndered and powers granted by the Constitution to the\r\nFederal Government.

In a series of 19th-century cases, the\r\nCourt determined that the same principle applied to\r\n12            PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nStates later admitted to the Union, because the States in\r\nthe Union are coequal sovereigns under the Constitution.\r\nSee, e.g., Lessee of Pollard v.

These precedents are the\r\nbasis for the equal-footing doctrine, under which a State’s\r\ntitle to these lands was “conferred not by Congress but by\r\nthe Constitution itself.” Oregon ex rel. State Land Bd. v.\r\nCorvallis Sand & Gravel Co., 429 U. S. 363, 374 (1977). It\r\nfollows that any ensuing questions of navigability for de-\r\ntermining state riverbed title are governed by federal\r\nlaw. See, e.g., United States v. Utah, 283 U. S. 64, 75\r\n(1931); United States v. Oregon, 295 U. S. 1, 14 (1935).\r\n   The title consequences of the equal-footing doctrine can\r\nbe stated in summary form: Upon statehood, the State\r\ngains title within its borders to the beds of waters then\r\nnavigable (or tidally influenced, see Phillips Petroleum Co.\r\nv. Mississippi, 484 U. S. 469 (1988), although that is not\r\nrelevant in this case). It may allocate and govern those\r\nlands according to state law subject only to “the para­\r\nmount power of the United States to control such waters\r\nfor purposes of navigation in interstate and foreign com­\r\nmerce.” Oregon, supra, at 14; see Montana v. United\r\nStates, 450 U. S. 544, 551 (1981); United States v. Holt\r\nState Bank, 270 U. S. 49, 54 (1926). The United States\r\nretains any title vested in it before statehood to any land\r\nbeneath waters not then navigable (and not tidally influ­\r\nenced), to be transferred or licensed if and as it chooses.\r\nSee Utah, supra, at 75; Oregon, supra, at 14.\r\n   Returning to the “navigability in fact” rule, the Court\r\nhas explained the elements of this test.

S. ____ (2012)           13\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n    “Those rivers must be regarded as public navigable\r\n    rivers in law which are navigable in fact. And they\r\n    are navigable in fact when they are used, or are sus­\r\n    ceptible of being used, in their ordinary condition, as\r\n    highways for commerce, over which trade and travel\r\n    are or may be conducted in the customary modes of\r\n    trade and travel on water.” Id., at 563.\r\n   The Daniel Ball formulation has been invoked in con­\r\nsidering the navigability of waters for purposes of as­\r\nsessing federal regulatory authority under the Constitu­\r\ntion, and the application of specific federal statutes, as to\r\nthe waters and their beds. See, e.g., ibid.; The Montello,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 439 (1874); United States v.

S. 715,\r\n730–731 (2006) (plurality opinion) (Clean Water Act); id.,\r\nat 761 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment) (same). It\r\nhas been used as well to determine questions of title to\r\nwater beds under the equal-footing doctrine. See Utah,\r\nsupra, at 76; Oklahoma v. Texas, 258 U. S. 574, 586\r\n(1922); Holt State Bank, supra, at 56. It should be noted,\r\nhowever, that the test for navigability is not applied in the\r\nsame way in these distinct types of cases.\r\n   Among the differences in application are the following.\r\nFor state title under the equal-footing doctrine, naviga­\r\nbility is determined at the time of statehood, see Utah,\r\nsupra, at 75, and based on the “natural and ordinary con-\r\ndition” of the water, see Oklahoma, supra, at 591. In\r\ncontrast, admiralty jurisdiction extends to water routes\r\nmade navigable even if not formerly so, see, e.g., Ex parte\r\nBoyer, 109 U. S. 629, 631–632 (1884) (artificial canal); and\r\nfederal regulatory authority encompasses waters that only\r\nrecently have become navigable, see, e.g., Philadelphia Co.\r\nv. Stimson, 223 U. S. 605, 634–635 (1912), were once\r\nnavigable but are no longer, see Economy Light & Power\r\n14             PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nCo. v. United States, 256 U. S. 113, 123–124 (1921), or are\r\nnot navigable and never have been but may become so by\r\nreasonable improvements, see Appalachian Elec. Power\r\nCo., supra, at 407–408. With respect to the federal com­\r\nmerce power, the inquiry regarding navigation historically\r\nfocused on interstate commerce. See The Daniel Ball,\r\nsupra, at 564. And, of course, the commerce power ex­\r\ntends beyond navigation. See Kaiser Aetna v. United\r\nStates, 444 U. S. 164, 173–174 (1979). In contrast, for title\r\npurposes, the inquiry depends only on navigation and not\r\non interstate travel. See Utah, supra, at 76. This list of\r\ndifferences is not exhaustive. Indeed, “[e]ach application\r\nof [the Daniel Ball] test . . . is apt to uncover variations\r\nand refinements which require further elaboration.” Ap-\r\npalachian Elec.

In United States v. Utah, for example, the Court\r\nnoted,\r\n     “the controversy relates only to the sections of the riv­\r\n     ers which are described in the complaint, and the\r\n     Master has limited his findings and conclusions as to\r\n     navigability accordingly. The propriety of this course,\r\n     in view of the physical characteristics of the streams,\r\n     is apparent. Even where the navigability of a river,\r\n     speaking generally, is a matter of common knowledge,\r\n     and hence one of which judicial notice may be taken,\r\n     it may yet be a question, to be determined upon evi­\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

S., at 77.\r\nThe Court went on to conclude, after reciting and as­\r\nsessing the evidence, that the Colorado River was naviga­\r\nble for its first roughly 4-mile stretch, nonnavigable for the\r\nnext roughly 36-mile stretch, and navigable for its remain­\r\ning 149 miles. Id., at 73–74, 79–81, 89. The Court noted\r\nthe importance of determining “the exact point at which\r\nnavigability may be deemed to end.” Id., at 90.\r\n  Similarly, in Brewer-Elliott Oil & Gas Co. v. United\r\nStates, 260 U. S. 77, 85 (1922), the Court examined the\r\nsegment of the Arkansas River that ran along the Osage\r\nIndian Reservation, assessing whether the Arkansas River\r\nwas “navigable in fact at the locus in quo.” The Court\r\nconcluded that the United States originally, and the Osag­\r\nes as its grantees, unequivocally held title to the riverbeds\r\nbecause the Arkansas River “is and was not navigable at\r\nthe place where the river bed lots, here in controversy,\r\nare.” Id., at 86. The Court found the segment of river\r\nalong the reservation to be nonnavigable even though a\r\nsegment of the river that began further downstream was\r\nnavigable. Ibid. See also Oklahoma, supra, at 583, 584,\r\n587–588, 589–591 (noting that “how far up the streams\r\nnavigability extended was not known”; assessing separate­\r\nly the segments of the Red River above and below its\r\nconfluence with the Washita River within Oklahoma’s\r\nborders; and concluding that neither segment, and hence\r\n“no part of the river within Oklahoma,” was navigable).\r\n  The Montana Supreme Court discounted the segment­\r\nby-segment approach of this Court’s cases, calling it\r\n“a piecemeal classification of navigability—with some\r\nstretches declared navigable, and others declared non­\r\nnavigable.” 355 Mont., at 440–442, 229 P. 3d, at 448–449.\r\nThis was error. The segment-by-segment approach to\r\nnavigability for title is well settled, and it should not be\r\ndisregarded. A key justification for sovereign ownership of\r\n16            PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nnavigable riverbeds is that a contrary rule would allow\r\nprivate riverbed owners to erect improvements on the\r\nriverbeds that could interfere with the public’s right to use\r\nthe waters as a highway for commerce. While the Federal\r\nGovernment and States retain regulatory power to protect\r\npublic navigation, allocation to the State of the beds un­\r\nderlying navigable rivers reduces the possibility of conflict\r\nbetween private and public interests. See Utah, supra, at\r\n82–83; Packer, 137 U. S., at 667. By contrast, segments\r\nthat are nonnavigable at the time of statehood are those\r\nover which commerce could not then occur. Thus, there is\r\nno reason that these segments also should be deemed\r\nowned by the State under the equal-footing doctrine.\r\n   Practical considerations also support segmentation.\r\nPhysical conditions that affect navigability often vary\r\nsignificantly over the length of a river. This is particularly\r\ntrue with longer rivers, which can traverse vastly different\r\nterrain and the flow of which can be affected by varying\r\nlocal climates. The Missouri River provides an excellent\r\nexample: Between its headwaters and mouth, it runs for\r\nover 2,000 miles out of steep mountains, through canyons\r\nand upon rocky beds, over waterfalls and rapids, and\r\nacross sandy plains, capturing runoff from snow melt and\r\nfarmland rains alike. These shifts in physical conditions\r\nprovide a means to determine appropriate start points and\r\nend points for the segment in question. Topographical and\r\ngeographical indicators may assist. See, e.g., Utah, supra,\r\nat 77–80 (gradient changes); Oklahoma, 258 U. S., at 589\r\n(location of tributary providing additional flow).\r\n   A segment approach to riverbed title allocation under\r\nthe equal-footing doctrine is consistent with the manner in\r\nwhich private parties seek to establish riverbed title. For\r\ncenturies, where title to the riverbed was not in the sover­\r\neign, the common-law rule for allocating riverbed title\r\namong riparian landowners involved apportionment de­\r\nfined both by segment (each landowner owns bed and soil\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          17\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nalong the length of his land adjacent) and thread (each\r\nlandowner owns bed and soil to the center of the stream).\r\nSee J. Angell, A Treatise on the Law of Watercourses\r\n18 (6th ed. 1869); Tyler v. Wilkinson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Cas.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 474\r\n(No. 14,312) (CC RI 1827) (Story, J.). Montana, moreover,\r\ncannot suggest that segmentation is inadministrable when\r\nthe state courts managed to divide up and apportion the\r\nunderlying riverbeds for purposes of determining their\r\nvalue and the corresponding rents owed by PPL.\r\n  The Montana Supreme Court, relying upon Utah, de-\r\ncided that the segment-by-segment approach is inapplicable\r\nhere because it “does not apply to ‘short interruption[s] of\r\nnavigability in a stream otherwise navigable.’ ” 355 Mont.,\r\nat 442, 229 P. 3d, at 449 (quoting Utah, 283 U. S., at 77).\r\nThis was mistaken. In Utah, this Court noted in pass­\r\ning that the facts of the case concerned “long reaches\r\nwith particular characteristics of navigability or non­\r\nnavigability” rather than “short interruption[s].” Id., at\r\n77. The Court in Utah did not say the case would have a\r\ndifferent outcome if a “short interruption” were concerned.\r\nIbid.\r\n  Even if the law might find some nonnavigable segments\r\nso minimal that they merit treatment as part of a longer,\r\nnavigable reach for purposes of title under the equal­\r\nfooting doctrine, it is doubtful that any of the segments in\r\nthis case would meet that standard, and one—the Great\r\nFalls reach—certainly would not. As an initial matter, the\r\nkinds of considerations that would define a de minimis\r\nexception to the segment-by-segment approach would be\r\nthose related to principles of ownership and title, such as\r\ninadministrability of parcels of exceedingly small size,\r\nor worthlessness of the parcels due to overdivision. See\r\nHeller, The Tragedy of the Anticommons, 111 Harv. L.\r\nRev. 621, 682–684 (1998) (explaining that dividing prop-\r\nerty into square-inch parcels, could, absent countervail-\r\ning legal mechanisms, “paralyze the alienability of scarce\r\n18            PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nresources . . . or diminish their value too drastically”). An\r\nanalysis of segmentation must be sensibly applied. A\r\ncomparison of the nonnavigable segment’s length to the\r\noverall length of the stream, for instance, would be simply\r\nirrelevant to the issue at hand.\r\n   A number of the segments at issue here are both dis­\r\ncrete, as defined by physical features characteristic of\r\nnavigability or nonnavigability, and substantial, as a\r\nmatter of administrability for title purposes. This is best\r\nillustrated by the Great Falls reach, which is 17 miles long\r\nand has distinct drops including five waterfalls and con­\r\ntinuous rapids in between. There is plenty of reason to\r\ndoubt that reach’s navigability based on the presence of\r\nthe series of falls. There is also reason to think that title\r\nto that segment of bed would not be worthless or inadmin­\r\nistrable. Indeed, the State sought and was awarded rent\r\nin the amount of $41 million for PPL’s various hydroelec­\r\ntric facilities attached to the riverbeds, half of which are\r\nalong the Great Falls reach.\r\n   Applying its “short interruptions” approach, the Mon­\r\ntana Supreme Court decided that the Great Falls reach\r\nwas navigable because it could be managed by way of land\r\nroute portage. 355 Mont., at 440, 442, 229 P. 3d, at 447,\r\n449. The court noted in particular the portage of Lewis\r\nand Clark’s expedition. Ibid. Yet that very portage re­\r\nveals the problem with the Montana Supreme Court’s\r\nanalysis. Leaving behind their larger boats, Lewis and\r\nClark transported their supplies and some small canoes\r\nabout 18 miles over land, which took at least 11 days and\r\nprobably more. See Lewis and Clark Journals 126–152;\r\n9 Journals of the Lewis & Clark Expedition 173; Dear\r\nBrother 109. Even if portage were to take travelers only\r\none day, its significance is the same: it demonstrates the\r\nneed to bypass the river segment, all because that part of\r\nthe river is nonnavigable. Thus, the Montana Supreme\r\nCourt was wrong to state, with respect to the Great Falls\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           19\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nreach and other stretches of the rivers in question, that\r\nportages “are not sufficient to defeat a finding of navigabil­\r\nity.” 355 Mont., at 438, 229 P. 3d, at 446. In most cases,\r\nthey are, because they require transportation over land\r\nrather than over the water. This is such a case, at least as\r\nto the Great Falls reach.\r\n   In reaching its conclusion that the necessity of portage\r\ndoes not undermine navigability, the Montana Supreme\r\nCourt misapplied this Court’s decision in The Montello, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. See 355 Mont., at 438, 229 P. 3d, at 446. The\r\nconsideration of portage in The Montello was for a differ­\r\nent purpose. The Court did not seek to determine whether\r\nthe river in question was navigable for title purposes but\r\ninstead whether it was navigable for purposes of deter­\r\nmining whether boats upon it could be regulated by the\r\nFederal Government. 20 Wall., at 439, 445. The primary\r\nfocus in The Montello was not upon navigability in fact\r\nbut upon whether the river was a “navigable water of the\r\nUnited States.” Id., at 439, 443. The latter inquiry is\r\ndoctrinally distinct. It turns upon whether the river\r\n“forms by itself, or by its connection with other waters, a\r\ncontinued highway over which commerce is, or may be,\r\ncarried with other States or foreign countries in the cus­\r\ntomary modes in which such commerce is conducted by\r\nwater.” Id., at 439 (citing The Daniel Ball, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">).\r\nIt is language similar to “continued highway” that Mon­\r\ntana urges the Court to import into the title context in lieu\r\nof the Court’s established segmentation approach. Brief\r\nfor Respondent 42–43, n. 16.\r\n   The Montello reasonably concluded that the portages\r\nrequired in that case did not prevent the river from being\r\npart of a channel of interstate commerce. Portages con­\r\ntinued that channel because goods could be successfully\r\ntransported interstate, in part upon the waters in ques­\r\ntion. This provided sufficient basis to regulate steamboats\r\nat places where those boats could and did, in fact, navigate\r\n20             PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nportions of the river. 20 Wall., at 445. Here, by contrast,\r\nthe question regards ownership of the bed under river\r\nsegments that the Montana Supreme Court, by calling\r\nthem “interruptions in the navigation,” 355 Mont., at 442,\r\n229 P. 3d, at 449, acknowledges were nonnavigable. The\r\nreasoning and the inquiry of The Montello does not control\r\nthe outcome where the quite different concerns of the\r\nriverbed title context apply.\r\n   Having clarified that portages may defeat navigability\r\nfor title purposes, and do so with respect to the Great Falls\r\nreach, the Court sees no evidence in the record that could\r\ndemonstrate that the Great Falls reach was navigable.\r\nMontana does not dispute that overland portage was\r\nnecessary to traverse that reach. Indeed, the State admits\r\n“the falls themselves were not passable by boat at state­\r\nhood.” Brief for Respondent 10. And the trial court noted\r\nthe falls had never been navigated. App. to Pet. for\r\nCert. 137. Based on these statements, this Court now con­\r\ncludes, contrary to the Montana Supreme Court’s decision,\r\nthat the 17-mile Great Falls reach, at least from the head\r\nof the first waterfall to the foot of the last, is not navigable\r\nfor purposes of riverbed title under the equal-footing\r\ndoctrine.\r\n   This Court also determines, based on evidence in the\r\nrecord, that there is a significant likelihood that some of\r\nthe other river stretches in dispute also fail the federal\r\ntest of navigability for the purpose of determining title.\r\nFor example, as to the disputed segment of the Clark Fork\r\nRiver, the Montana Supreme Court incorrectly stated the\r\nsole evidence for nonnavigability “consists of conclusory\r\nstatements . . . without any specific factual support.” 355\r\nMont., at 440, 229 P. 3d, at 448. In fact, PPL introduced a\r\nreport of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers from 1891,\r\ntwo years after Montana’s date of statehood, documenting\r\nthat the portion of the Clark Fork river between Missoula\r\nand Lake Pend Oreille (which includes the location of\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            21\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nPPL’s Thompson Falls facility) had a fall of about 1,100\r\nfeet in 250 miles and “is a mountain torrential stream, full\r\nof rocks, rapids, and falls, . . . utterly unnavigable, and in-\r\ncapable of being made navigable except at an enormous\r\ncost.” 2 H. R. Exec. Doc., pt. 5, at 3250; see App. 379–380\r\n(Docket No. 169). The report based its conclusions on\r\nvarious failed attempts to navigate the river. It found the\r\nThompson Falls “a complete obstruction to navigation”\r\nand the river around that area “exceedingly rapid, rough,\r\nand full of rocks.” 2 H. R. Exec. Doc., pt. 5, at 3251. This\r\nwas consistent with a 1910 Federal District Court decree.\r\nThe decree adjudicated a title dispute between two private\r\nparties over the riverbed near and under Thompson Falls\r\nand declared the river at that place “was and is a non­\r\nnavigable stream incapable of carrying the products of\r\nthe country in the usual manner of water transportation.”\r\nSteele v. Donlan, Equity No. 950 (CC D Mont., July 19,\r\n1910), p. 1; see App. 380–381 (Docket No. 169). While the\r\nultimate decision as to this and the other disputed river\r\nstretches is to be determined, in the first instance, by the\r\nMontana courts upon remand, the relevant evidence\r\nshould be assessed in light of the principles discussed in\r\nthis opinion.\r\n                             B\r\n  The Montana Supreme Court further erred as a matter\r\nof law in its reliance upon the evidence of present-day,\r\nprimarily recreational use of the Madison River. Error is\r\nnot inherent in a court’s consideration of such evidence,\r\nbut the evidence must be confined to that which shows the\r\nriver could sustain the kinds of commercial use that, as a\r\nrealistic matter, might have occurred at the time of state­\r\nhood. Navigability must be assessed as of the time of\r\nstatehood, and it concerns the river’s usefulness for “ ‘trade\r\nand travel,’ ” rather than for other purposes. See Utah,\r\n283 U. S., at 75–76. Mere use by initial explorers or trap­\r\n22            PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\npers, who may have dragged their boats in or alongside\r\nthe river despite its nonnavigability in order to avoid\r\ngetting lost, or to provide water for their horses and them­\r\nselves, is not itself enough. See Oregon, 295 U. S., at\r\n20–21 (evidence that “trappers appear to have waded or\r\nwalked” through the river, dragging their boats rather\r\nthan floating them, had “no bearing on navigability”).\r\n   True, river segments are navigable not only if they\r\n“[were] used,” but also if they “[were] susceptible of being\r\nused,” as highways of commerce at the time of statehood.\r\nUtah, supra, at 76 (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nEvidence of recreational use, depending on its nature, may\r\nbear upon susceptibility of commercial use at the time of\r\nstatehood. See Appalachian Elec. Power Co., 311 U. S., at\r\n416 (“[P]ersonal or private use by boats demonstrates the\r\navailability of the stream for the simpler types of commer­\r\ncial navigation”); Utah, 283 U. S., at 82 (fact that actual\r\nuse has “been more of a private nature than of a public,\r\ncommercial sort . . . cannot be regarded as controlling”).\r\nSimilarly, poststatehood evidence, depending on its na­\r\nture, may show susceptibility of use at the time of state­\r\nhood. See id., at 82–83 (“[E]xtensive and continued\r\n[historical] use for commercial purposes” may be the “most\r\npersuasive” form of evidence, but the “crucial question” is\r\nthe potential for such use at the time of statehood, rather\r\nthan “the mere manner or extent of actual use”).\r\n   Evidence of present-day use may be considered to the\r\nextent it informs the historical determination whether the\r\nriver segment was susceptible of use for commercial navi­\r\ngation at the time of statehood. For the susceptibility\r\nanalysis, it must be determined whether trade and travel\r\ncould have been conducted “in the customary modes of\r\ntrade and travel on water,” over the relevant river seg­\r\nment “in [its] natural and ordinary condition.” Id., at 76\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted). At a minimum, there­\r\nfore, the party seeking to use present-day evidence for title\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          23\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\npurposes must show: (1) the watercraft are meaningfully\r\nsimilar to those in customary use for trade and travel\r\nat the time of statehood; and (2) the river’s poststatehood\r\ncondition is not materially different from its physical con-\r\ndition at statehood. See also Oregon, supra, at 18 (find-\r\ning that scientific and historical evidence showed that\r\nthe physical condition of particular water bodies had not\r\nvaried substantially since statehood in a way that might\r\naffect navigation). If modern watercraft permit navigabil­\r\nity where the historical watercraft would not, or if the\r\nriver has changed in ways that substantially improve its\r\nnavigability, then the evidence of present-day use has\r\nlittle or no bearing on navigability at statehood.\r\n   The Montana Supreme Court opinion offered no indica­\r\ntion that it made these necessary findings. The court\r\nconcluded the evidence of present-day use of the Madison\r\nwas probative of its susceptibility of use at statehood, but\r\nthere is no apparent basis for its conclusion. 355 Mont., at\r\n442–443, 438–439, 229 P. 3d, at 449, 446–447. The court\r\ndid not find the watercraft similar to those used at the\r\ntime of statehood, and the State’s evidence of present-day\r\nuse for recreational fishing did not indicate what types of\r\nboats are now used. App. 46–48. Modern recreational\r\nfishing boats, including inflatable rafts and lightweight\r\ncanoes or kayaks, may be able to navigate waters much\r\nmore shallow or with rockier beds than the boats custom­\r\narily used for trade and travel at statehood.\r\n   As to the river’s physical condition, the Montana Su­\r\npreme Court did not assess with care PPL’s evidence\r\nabout changes to the river’s flow and the location and\r\npattern of its channel since statehood. The affidavit of\r\nPPL’s expert in fluvial geomorphology—the study of river­\r\nrelated landforms—at least suggests that as a result of\r\nPPL’s dams, the river has become “less torrential” in high\r\nflow periods and less shallow in low flow periods. App.\r\n575–577 (Docket No. 170). Thus, the river may well be\r\n24            PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\neasier to navigate now than at statehood.\r\n   The Montana Supreme Court altogether ignored the\r\nexpert’s reasoning about the past condition of the river’s\r\nchannels and the significance of that information for\r\nnavigability. Further, contrary to the Montana Supreme\r\nCourt’s suggestion, the expert’s affidavit was not mere\r\nevidence of change in “seasonal variations” of water depth.\r\n355 Mont., at 440, 229 P. 3d, at 448. It provided meaning­\r\nful evidence that the river’s conditions had changed since\r\nstatehood in ways that made present-day navigation of the\r\nriver easier in all seasons than it was at the relevant time.\r\nWhile the Montana court was correct that a river need not\r\nbe susceptible of navigation at every point during the year,\r\nneither can that susceptibility be so brief that it is not a\r\ncommercial reality. Against this background, the present­\r\nday recreational use of the river did not bear on navigabil­\r\nity for purposes of title under the equal-footing doctrine.\r\nThe Montana Supreme Court’s reliance upon the State’s\r\nevidence of present-day, recreational use, at least without\r\nfurther inquiry, was wrong as a matter of law.\r\n                           C\r\n  The above analysis is sufficient to require reversal of\r\nthe grant of summary judgment to Montana. Therefore, the\r\nCourt declines to decide whether the Montana Supreme\r\nCourt further erred as to the burden of proof regarding\r\nnavigability.\r\n                            D\r\n  As a final contention, the State of Montana suggests\r\nthat denying the State title to the riverbeds here in dis­\r\npute will undermine the public trust doctrine, which con­\r\ncerns public access to the waters above those beds for\r\npurposes of navigation, fishing, and other recreational\r\nuses.

Mundy, 6 N. J. L. 1, 9–10\r\n(1821). Unlike the equal-footing doctrine, however, which\r\nis the constitutional foundation for the navigability rule of\r\nriverbed title, the public trust doctrine remains a matter\r\nof state law, see Coeur d’Alene, supra, at 285 (Illinois\r\nCentral, a Supreme Court public trust case, was “ ‘neces­\r\nsarily a statement of Illinois law’ ”); Appleby v. City of New\r\nYork, 271 U. S. 364, 395 (1926) (same), subject as well to\r\nthe federal power to regulate vessels and navigation under\r\nthe Commerce Clause and admiralty power. While equal­\r\nfooting cases have noted that the State takes title to the\r\nnavigable waters and their beds in trust for the public, see\r\nShively, 152 U. S., at 49, 15–17, 24, 46, the contours of\r\nthat public trust do not depend upon the Constitution.\r\nUnder accepted principles of federalism, the States retain\r\nresidual power to determine the scope of the public trust\r\nover waters within their borders, while federal law deter­\r\nmines riverbed title under the equal-footing doctrine.\r\n                             V\r\n   As the litigation history of this case shows, Montana\r\nfiled its claim for riverbed rent over a century after the\r\nfirst of the dams was built upon the riverbeds. Montana\r\nhad not sought compensation before then, despite its full\r\nawareness of PPL’s hydroelectric projects and despite the\r\nState’s own participation in the projects’ federal licensing\r\n26            PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nprocess. While this Court does not reach the question, it\r\nmay be that by virtue of the State’s sovereignty, neither\r\nlaches nor estoppel could apply in a strict sense to bar the\r\nState’s much belated claim. Still, the reliance by PPL and\r\nits predecessors in title upon the State’s long failure to\r\nassert title is some evidence to support the conclusion that\r\nthe river segments were nonnavigable for purposes of the\r\nequal-footing doctrine.\r\n   The Montana Supreme Court’s ruling that Montana\r\nowns and may charge for use of riverbeds across the\r\nState was based upon an infirm legal understanding of\r\nthis Court’s rules of navigability for title under the equal­\r\nfooting doctrine. As the Court said in Brewer-Elliott, “It is\r\nnot for a State by courts or legislature, in dealing with the\r\ngeneral subject of beds or streams, to adopt a retroactive\r\nrule for determining navigability which . . . would enlarge\r\nwhat actually passed to the State, at the time of her ad­\r\nmission, under the constitutional rule of equality here\r\ninvoked.” 260 U.

MONTANA\r\n\r\n       CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MONTANA\r\n\r\n  No. 10–218.     Argued December 7, 2011—Decided February 22, 2012\r\nPetitioner PPL Montana, LLC (PPL), owns and operates hydroelectric\r\n  facilities in Montana. Ten of its facilities are located on riverbeds\r\n  underlying segments of the Missouri, Madison, and Clark Fork Riv-\r\n  ers. Five hydroelectric dams on the Upper Missouri River are along\r\n  the Great Falls reach, including on the three tallest waterfalls; and\r\n  PPL’s two other dams on that river are in canyons on the Stubbs Fer-\r\n  ry stretch. These, together with two dams located in steep canyons\r\n  on the Madison River, are called the Missouri-Madison project. The\r\n  Thompson Falls project is a facility on the Clark Fork River. Both\r\n  projects are licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\r\n  PPL’s facilities have existed for many decades, some for over a centu-\r\n  ry. Until recently, Montana, though aware of the projects’ existence,\r\n  sought no rent for use of the riverbeds. Instead, the understanding of\r\n  PPL and the United States is that PPL has paid rents to the United\r\n  States. In 2003, parents of Montana schoolchildren filed a federal\r\n  suit, claiming that PPL’s facilities were on riverbeds that were state\r\n  owned and part of Montana’s school trust lands. The State joined the\r\n  suit and, for the first time, sought rents from PPL for its use of the\r\n  riverbeds. That case was dismissed, and PPL and other power com-\r\n  panies filed a state-court suit, claiming that Montana was barred\r\n  from seeking compensation for PPL’s riverbed use. Montana coun-\r\n  terclaimed, contending that under the equal-footing doctrine it owns\r\n  the riverbeds and can charge rent for their use. The trial court\r\n  granted Montana summary judgment as to navigability for purposes\r\n  of determining riverbed title and ordered PPL to pay Montana $41\r\n  million in rent for riverbed use between 2000 and 2007. The Mon-\r\n  tana Supreme Court affirmed. Adopting a liberal construction of the\r\n  navigability test, it discounted this Court’s approach of considering\r\n  the navigability of particular river segments for purposes of deter-\r\n2                  PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                                  Syllabus\r\n\r\n    mining whether a State acquired title to the riverbeds underlying\r\n    those segments at the time of statehood. Instead, the Montana court\r\n    declared the river stretches in question to be short interruptions of\r\n    navigability that were insufficient as a matter of law to find nonnavi-\r\n    gability, since traffic had circumvented those stretches by portage.\r\n    Based on evidence of present-day, recreational use of the Madison\r\n    River, the court found that river navigable as a matter of law at the\r\n    time of statehood.\r\nHeld: The Montana Supreme Court’s ruling that Montana owns and\r\n may charge for use of the riverbeds at issue was based on an infirm\r\n legal understanding of this Court’s rules of navigability for title un-\r\n der the equal-footing doctrine. Pp. 10–26.\r\n    (a) The rule that the States, in their capacity as sovereigns, hold\r\n “title in the soil of rivers really navigable,” Shively v. Bowlby, 152\r\n U. S. 1, 31, has federal constitutional significance under the equal-\r\n footing doctrine. Pursuant to that doctrine, upon its date of state-\r\n hood, a State gains title within its borders to the beds of waters then\r\n navigable. It may allocate and govern those lands according to state\r\n law subject only to the United States’ power “to control such waters\r\n for purposes of navigation in interstate and foreign commerce.” Unit-\r\n ed States v. Oregon, 295 U. S. 1, 14. The United States retains title\r\n vested in it before statehood to land beneath waters not then naviga-\r\n ble. To be navigable for purposes of title under the equal-footing doc-\r\n trine, rivers must be “navigable in fact,” meaning “they are used, or\r\n are susceptible of being used, . . . as highways for commerce, over\r\n which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary\r\n modes of trade and travel on water.” The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557,\r\n 563. This formulation has been used to determine questions of wa-\r\n terbed title under the equal-footing doctrine. See United States v.\r\n Utah, 283 U. S. 64, 76. Pp. 10–14.\r\n    (b) The Montana Supreme Court erred in its treatment of the ques-\r\n tion of river segments and portage. To determine riverbed title under\r\n the equal-footing doctrine, this Court considers the river on a seg-\r\n ment-by-segment basis to assess whether the segment of the river,\r\n under which the riverbed in dispute lies, is navigable or not. See,\r\n e.g., Utah, supra, at 77. The State Supreme Court erred in discount-\r\n ing this well-settled approach. A key justification for sovereign own-\r\n ership of navigable riverbeds is that a contrary rule would allow pri-\r\n vate riverbed owners to erect improvements on the riverbeds that\r\n could interfere with the public’s right to use the waters as a highway\r\n for commerce. Because commerce could not have occurred on seg-\r\n ments nonnavigable at the time of statehood, there is no reason to\r\n deem those segments owned by the State under the equal-footing\r\n doctrine. Practical considerations also support segmentation. Physi-\r\n                   Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\r\n\r\n                              Syllabus\r\n\r\ncal conditions affecting navigability vary over the length of a river\r\nand provide a means to determine appropriate start points and end\r\npoints for disputed segments. A segment approach is also consistent\r\nwith the manner in which private parties seek to establish riverbed\r\ntitle. Montana cannot suggest that segmentation is inadministrable\r\nwhen the state courts managed to apportion the underlying riverbeds\r\nfor purposes of determining their value and PPL’s corresponding\r\nrents. The State Supreme Court’s view that the segment-by-segment\r\napproach does not apply to short interruptions of navigability is not\r\nsupported by this Court’s Utah decision. Even if the law might find\r\nsome nonnavigable segments so minimal that they merit treatment\r\nas part of a longer, navigable reach, it is doubtful that the segments\r\nin this case would meet that standard. Applying its “short interrup-\r\ntions” approach, the State Supreme Court found the Great Falls\r\nreach navigable because it could be managed by way of land route\r\nportage, as done by Lewis and Clark. But a portage of even one day\r\nwould demonstrate the need to bypass a nonnavigable river segment.\r\nThus, the State Supreme Court was wrong to conclude, with respect\r\nto the Great Falls reach and other disputed stretches, that portages\r\nwere insufficient to defeat a navigability finding. In most cases, they\r\nare, because they require transportation over land rather than over\r\nthe water. This is the case at least as to the Great Falls reach. In\r\nreaching a contrary conclusion, the State Supreme Court misapplied\r\nThe Montello, 20 Wall. 430. There, portage was considered in deter-\r\nmining whether a river was part of a channel of interstate commerce\r\nfor federal regulatory purposes. The Montello does not control the\r\noutcome where the quite different concerns of the riverbed title con-\r\ntext apply. Portages may defeat navigability for title purposes, and\r\ndo so with respect to the Great Falls reach. Montana does not dis-\r\npute that overland portage was necessary to traverse that reach, and\r\nthe trial court noted the waterfalls had never been navigated. The\r\nGreat Falls reach, at least from the head of the first waterfall to the\r\nfoot of the last, is not navigable for purposes of riverbed title under\r\nthe equal-footing doctrine. There is also a significant likelihood that\r\nsome of the other river stretches in dispute fail this federal navigabil-\r\nity test. The ultimate decision as to these other disputed river\r\nstretches is to be determined, in the first instance, by the Montana\r\ncourts on remand, which should assess the relevant evidence in light\r\nof the principles discussed here. Pp. 14–21.\r\n   (c) The Montana Supreme Court further erred as a matter of law in\r\nrelying on evidence of present-day, primarily recreational use of the\r\nMadison River. Navigability must be assessed as of the time of\r\nstatehood, and it concerns a river’s usefulness for “ ‘trade and trav-\r\nel.’ ” Utah, 283 U. S., at 75–76. River segments are navigable if they\r\n4                   PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                                   Syllabus\r\n\r\n    “ ‘[were]’ ” used and if they “ ‘[were] susceptible of being used’ ” as\r\n    highways of commerce at the time of statehood. Id., at 76. Evidence\r\n    of recreational use and poststatehood evidence may bear on suscepti-\r\n    bility of commercial use at the time of statehood. See id., at 82–83.\r\n    In order for present-day use to have a bearing on navigability at\r\n    statehood, (1) the watercraft must be meaningfully similar to those in\r\n    customary use for trade and travel at the time of statehood, and\r\n    (2) the river’s poststatehood condition may not be materially different\r\n    from its physical condition at statehood. The State Supreme Court\r\n    offered no indication that it made these necessary findings. Pp. 21–\r\n    24.\r\n        (d) Because this analysis is sufficient to require reversal here, the\r\n    Court declines to decide whether the State Supreme Court also erred\r\n    as to the burden of proof regarding navigability. P. 24.\r\n        (e) Montana’s suggestion that denying the State title to the disput-\r\n    ed riverbeds will undermine the public trust doctrine—which con-\r\n    cerns public access to the waters above those beds for navigation,\r\n    fishing, and other recreational uses—underscores its misapprehen-\r\n    sion of the equal-footing and public trust doctrines. Unlike the equal-\r\n    footing doctrine, which is the constitutional foundation for the navi-\r\n    gability rule of riverbed title, the scope of the public trust over waters\r\n    within the State’s borders is a matter of state law, subject to federal\r\n    regulatory power. Pp. 24–25.\r\n        (f) This Court does not reach the question whether, by virtue of\r\n    Montana’s sovereignty, neither laches nor estoppel could apply to bar\r\n    the State’s claim. Still, the reliance by PPL and its predecessors in ti-\r\n    tle on the State’s long failure to assert title to the riverbeds is some\r\n    evidence supporting the conclusion that the river segments over\r\n    those beds were nonnavigable for purposes of the equal-footing doc-\r\n    trine.

The question is\r\nwhether discrete, identifiable segments of these rivers in\r\nMontana were nonnavigable, as federal law defines that\r\nconcept for purposes of determining whether the State\r\nacquired title to the riverbeds underlying those segments,\r\nwhen the State entered the Union in 1889. Montana\r\ncontends that the rivers must be found navigable at the\r\ndisputed locations. From this premise, the State asserts\r\nthat in 1889 it gained title to the disputed riverbeds under\r\nthe constitutional equal-footing doctrine. Based on its\r\ntitle claims, Montana sought compensation from PPL\r\nMontana, LLC, a power company, for its use of the riv­\r\nerbeds for hydroelectric projects. The Montana courts\r\ngranted summary judgment on title to Montana, awarding\r\nit $41 million in rent for the riverbeds for the period from\r\n2000 to 2007 alone. That judgment must be reversed.\r\n                             I\r\n  The three rivers in question are the Missouri River, the\r\nMadison River, and the Clark Fork River. The Missouri\r\nand the Madison are on the eastern side of the Continen­\r\n2             PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\ntal Divide. The Madison flows into the Missouri, which\r\nthen continues at length to its junction with the Missis­\r\nsippi River. The Clark Fork River is on the western side\r\nof the Continental Divide. Its waters join the Columbia\r\nRiver system that flows into the Pacific Ocean. Each river\r\nshall be described in somewhat more detail.\r\n                             A\r\n   The Missouri River originates in Montana and traverses\r\nseven States before a point just north of St. Louis where\r\nit joins the Mississippi. 19 Encyclopedia Americana 270\r\n(int’l ed. 2006). If considered with the continuous path\r\nformed by certain streams that provide the Missouri Riv­\r\ner’s headwaters, the Missouri is over 2,500 miles long, the\r\nlongest river in the United States.

Despite the falls’ beauty, Lewis could see that\r\ntheir steep cliffs and swift waters would impede progress\r\non the river, which had been the expedition’s upstream\r\ncourse for so many months. The party proceeded over a\r\nmore circuitous land route by means of portage, circum­\r\nventing the Great Falls and their surrounding reach of\r\nriver before returning to travel upon the river about a\r\nmonth later.

S. Geological Survey, J. Stevens\r\n& F. Henshaw, Surface Water Supply of the United\r\nStates, 1907–8, Water-Supply Paper 252, pp. 81–82\r\n(1910). The river flows northward for about 40 miles;\r\nturns northwest for a stretch; then turns abruptly north­\r\neast for a short stint, by which time it has descended\r\nnearly 2,500 feet in altitude. It then resumes a north­\r\nwestward course until it empties into Lake Pend Oreille in\r\nnorthern Idaho, out of which flows a tributary to the Co­\r\nlumbia River of the Pacific Northwest. Ibid.; 1 Columbia\r\nGazetteer 816. The Clark Fork is “one of the wildest and\r\nmost picturesque streams in the West,” marked by “many\r\nwaterfalls and boxed gorges.” Federal Writers’ Projects of\r\nthe Works Progress Administration, Idaho: A Guide in\r\nWord and Picture 230 (2d ed. 1950).\r\n  Lewis and Clark knew of the Clark Fork River but did\r\nnot try to navigate it, in part because the absence of salm­\r\non in one of its tributaries made Lewis believe “ ‘there\r\nmust be a considerable fall in [the river] below.’ ” H. Fritz,\r\nThe Lewis and Clark Expedition 38–39 (2004). This was\r\ncorrect, for shortly before the Clark Fork exits to Idaho\r\nfrom the northwest corner of Montana, “the waters of the\r\nriver dash madly along their rocky bed,” dropping over 30\r\nfeet in a half-mile as they rush over falls and rapids in­\r\ncluding a “foaming waterfall” now known as Thompson\r\nFalls.

Ten of its facilities are built upon riverbeds\r\nunderlying segments of the Upper Missouri, Madison, and\r\nClark Fork Rivers. It is these beds to which title is\r\ndisputed.\r\n   On the Upper Missouri River, PPL has seven hydroelec­\r\ntric dams. Five of them are along the Great Falls reach,\r\nincluding on the three tallest falls; and the other two are\r\nin canyons upstream on the Stubbs Ferry stretch. See K.\r\nRobison, Cascade County and Great Falls 56 (2011); Aar­\r\nstad et al., supra, at 125, 119, 145–146. On the Madison\r\nRiver, two hydroelectric dams are located in steep can­\r\nyons. On the Clark Fork River, a hydroelectric facility is\r\nconstructed on the Thompson Falls.\r\n   The dams on the Upper Missouri and Madison are\r\ncalled the Missouri-Madison project. The Thompson Falls\r\nfacility is called the Thompson Falls project. Both projects\r\nare licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commis­\r\nsion. PPL acquired them in 1999 from its predecessor, the\r\nMontana Power Company. 355 Mont., at 405–406, 229\r\nP. 3d, at 426.\r\n   PPL’s power facilities have existed at their locations for\r\nmany decades, some for over a century. See Robison,\r\nsupra, at 40 (Black Eagle Falls dam constructed by 1891).\r\nUntil recently, these facilities were operated without title­\r\nbased objection by the State of Montana. The State was\r\nwell aware of the facilities’ existence on the riverbeds—\r\nindeed, various Montana state agencies had participated\r\nin federal licensing proceedings for these hydroelectric\r\nprojects. See, e.g., Montana Power Co., 8 F. P. C. 751, 752\r\n(1949) (Thompson Falls project); Montana Power Co., 27\r\nFERC ¶62,097, pp. 63,188–63,189 (1984) (Ryan Dam of\r\n8              PPL MONTANA, LLC v.

Yet the State did not seek, and\r\naccordingly PPL and its predecessor did not pay, compen­\r\nsation for use of the riverbeds. 355 Mont., at 406, 229\r\nP. 3d, at 427. Instead, the understanding of PPL and the\r\nUnited States is that PPL has been paying rents to the\r\nUnited States for use of those riverbeds, as well as for use\r\nof river uplands flooded by PPL’s projects.

Prompted\r\nby the litigation, the State joined the lawsuit, for the first\r\ntime seeking rents for PPL’s riverbed use.

By counterclaim, the State sought a\r\ndeclaration that under the equal-footing doctrine it owns\r\nthe riverbeds used by PPL and can charge rent for their\r\nuse. Id., at 408, 229 P. 3d, at 428.

It dismissed as having\r\n“limited applicability” this Court’s approach of assessing\r\nthe navigability of the disputed segment of the river ra­\r\nther than the river as a whole. Id., at 441–442, 229 P. 3d,\r\nat 448–449. The Montana court accepted that certain\r\nrelevant stretches of the rivers were not navigable but\r\ndeclared them “merely short interruptions” insufficient as\r\na matter of law to find nonnavigability, since traffic had\r\ncircumvented those stretches by overland portage. Id.,\r\nat 438, 442, 229 P. 3d, at 446, 449. Placing extensive\r\nreliance upon evidence of present-day use of the Madison\r\nRiver, the court found that river navigable as a matter of\r\nlaw at the time of statehood.

The majority\r\nerred, he wrote, in rejecting the “section-by-section ap­\r\nproach” and “declaring, as a matter of law, that the\r\nreaches claimed by PPL to be non-navigable are simply too\r\n‘short’ to matter,” when in fact PPL’s evidence showed the\r\n“disputed reaches of the rivers were, at the time of state­\r\nhood, non-navigable.” Id., at 463–466, 476–477, 229 P. 3d,\r\nat 462–464, 470.\r\n   This Court granted certiorari, 564 U.

Brief for Petitioner 26. The\r\nUnited States as amicus is in substantial agreement with\r\nPPL’s arguments, although it offers a more extended dis­\r\ncussion with respect to evidence of present-day, recrea­\r\ntional use. Brief for United States 27–33.\r\n   It is appropriate to begin the analysis by discussing the\r\nlegal principles that control the case.\r\n                             B\r\n  The rule that the States, in their capacity as sovereigns,\r\nhold title to the beds under navigable waters has origins\r\nin English common law. See Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U. S.\r\n1, 13 (1894). A distinction was made in England between\r\nwaters subject to the ebb and flow of the tide (royal rivers)\r\nand nontidal waters (public highways). With respect to\r\nroyal rivers, the Crown was presumed to hold title to the\r\nriverbed and soil, but the public retained the right of\r\npassage and the right to fish in the stream. With respect\r\nto public highways, as the name suggests, the public also\r\nretained the right of water passage; but title to the riv­\r\nerbed and soil, as a general matter, was held in private\r\nownership. Riparian landowners shared title, with each\r\nowning from his side to the center thread of the stream, as\r\nwell as the exclusive right to fish there. See Idaho v.\r\nCoeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 285 (1997)\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            11\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n(summarizing J. Angell, A Treatise on the Common Law\r\nin Relation to Water-Courses 14–18 (1824)); 3 J. Kent,\r\nCommentaries on American Law 528–529 (9th ed. 1858).\r\n   While the tide-based distinction for bed title was the\r\ninitial rule in the 13 Colonies, after the Revolution Ameri­\r\ncan law moved to a different standard. Some state courts\r\ncame early to the conclusion that a State holds presump­\r\ntive title to navigable waters whether or not the waters\r\nare subject to the ebb and flow of the tide. See, e.g., Car-\r\nson v. Blazer, 2 Binn. 475 (Pa. 1810); Executors of Cates v.\r\nWadlington, 12 S. C. L. 580 (1822); Wilson v. Forbes, 13\r\nN. C. 30 (1828); Bullock v. Wilson, 2 Port. 436 (Ala. 1835);\r\nElder v. Burrus, 25 Tenn. 358 (1845). The tidal rule of\r\n“navigability” for sovereign ownership of riverbeds, while\r\nperhaps appropriate for England’s dominant coastal geog­\r\nraphy, was ill suited to the United States with its vast\r\nnumber of major inland rivers upon which navigation\r\ncould be sustained. See L. Houck, Law of Navigable Riv­\r\ners 26–27, 31–35 (1868); Packer v. Bird, 137 U. S. 661,\r\n667–669 (1891). By the late 19th century, the Court had\r\nrecognized “the now prevailing doctrine” of state sovereign\r\n“title in the soil of rivers really navigable.” Shively, supra,\r\nat 31; see Barney v. Keokuk, 94 U. S. 324, 336 (1877) (“In\r\nthis country, as a general thing, all waters are deemed\r\nnavigable which are really so”). This title rule became\r\nknown as “navigability in fact.”\r\n   The rule for state riverbed title assumed federal consti­\r\ntutional significance under the equal-footing doctrine. In\r\n1842, the Court declared that for the 13 original States,\r\nthe people of each State, based on principles of sovereign­\r\nty, “hold the absolute right to all their navigable waters\r\nand the soils under them,” subject only to rights surren­\r\ndered and powers granted by the Constitution to the\r\nFederal Government. Martin v. Lessee of Waddell, 16 Pet.\r\n367, 410 (1842). In a series of 19th-century cases, the\r\nCourt determined that the same principle applied to\r\n12            PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nStates later admitted to the Union, because the States in\r\nthe Union are coequal sovereigns under the Constitution.\r\nSee, e.g., Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How. 212, 228–229\r\n(1845); Knight v. United States Land Assn., 142 U. S. 161,\r\n183 (1891); Shively, supra, at 26–31; see United States v.\r\nTexas, 339 U. S. 707, 716 (1950). These precedents are the\r\nbasis for the equal-footing doctrine, under which a State’s\r\ntitle to these lands was “conferred not by Congress but by\r\nthe Constitution itself.” Oregon ex rel. State Land Bd. v.\r\nCorvallis Sand & Gravel Co., 429 U. S. 363, 374 (1977). It\r\nfollows that any ensuing questions of navigability for de-\r\ntermining state riverbed title are governed by federal\r\nlaw. See, e.g., United States v. Utah, 283 U. S. 64, 75\r\n(1931); United States v. Oregon, 295 U. S. 1, 14 (1935).\r\n   The title consequences of the equal-footing doctrine can\r\nbe stated in summary form: Upon statehood, the State\r\ngains title within its borders to the beds of waters then\r\nnavigable (or tidally influenced, see Phillips Petroleum Co.\r\nv. Mississippi, 484 U. S. 469 (1988), although that is not\r\nrelevant in this case). It may allocate and govern those\r\nlands according to state law subject only to “the para­\r\nmount power of the United States to control such waters\r\nfor purposes of navigation in interstate and foreign com­\r\nmerce.” Oregon, supra, at 14; see Montana v. United\r\nStates, 450 U. S. 544, 551 (1981); United States v. Holt\r\nState Bank, 270 U. S. 49, 54 (1926). The United States\r\nretains any title vested in it before statehood to any land\r\nbeneath waters not then navigable (and not tidally influ­\r\nenced), to be transferred or licensed if and as it chooses.\r\nSee Utah, supra, at 75; Oregon, supra, at 14.\r\n   Returning to the “navigability in fact” rule, the Court\r\nhas explained the elements of this test. A basic formula­\r\ntion of the rule was set forth in The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall.\r\n557 (1871), a case concerning federal power to regulate\r\nnavigation:\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n    “Those rivers must be regarded as public navigable\r\n    rivers in law which are navigable in fact. And they\r\n    are navigable in fact when they are used, or are sus­\r\n    ceptible of being used, in their ordinary condition, as\r\n    highways for commerce, over which trade and travel\r\n    are or may be conducted in the customary modes of\r\n    trade and travel on water.” Id., at 563.\r\n   The Daniel Ball formulation has been invoked in con­\r\nsidering the navigability of waters for purposes of as­\r\nsessing federal regulatory authority under the Constitu­\r\ntion, and the application of specific federal statutes, as to\r\nthe waters and their beds. See, e.g., ibid.; The Montello,\r\n20 Wall. 430, 439 (1874); United States v. Appalachian\r\nElec. Power Co., 311 U. S. 377, 406, and n. 21 (1940) (Fed­\r\neral Power Act); Rapanos v. United States, 547 U. S. 715,\r\n730–731 (2006) (plurality opinion) (Clean Water Act); id.,\r\nat 761 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment) (same). It\r\nhas been used as well to determine questions of title to\r\nwater beds under the equal-footing doctrine. See Utah,\r\nsupra, at 76; Oklahoma v. Texas, 258 U. S. 574, 586\r\n(1922); Holt State Bank, supra, at 56. It should be noted,\r\nhowever, that the test for navigability is not applied in the\r\nsame way in these distinct types of cases.\r\n   Among the differences in application are the following.\r\nFor state title under the equal-footing doctrine, naviga­\r\nbility is determined at the time of statehood, see Utah,\r\nsupra, at 75, and based on the “natural and ordinary con-\r\ndition” of the water, see Oklahoma, supra, at 591. In\r\ncontrast, admiralty jurisdiction extends to water routes\r\nmade navigable even if not formerly so, see, e.g., Ex parte\r\nBoyer, 109 U. S. 629, 631–632 (1884) (artificial canal); and\r\nfederal regulatory authority encompasses waters that only\r\nrecently have become navigable, see, e.g., Philadelphia Co.\r\nv. Stimson, 223 U. S. 605, 634–635 (1912), were once\r\nnavigable but are no longer, see Economy Light & Power\r\n14             PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nCo. v. United States, 256 U. S. 113, 123–124 (1921), or are\r\nnot navigable and never have been but may become so by\r\nreasonable improvements, see Appalachian Elec. Power\r\nCo., supra, at 407–408. With respect to the federal com­\r\nmerce power, the inquiry regarding navigation historically\r\nfocused on interstate commerce. See The Daniel Ball,\r\nsupra, at 564. And, of course, the commerce power ex­\r\ntends beyond navigation. See Kaiser Aetna v. United\r\nStates, 444 U. S. 164, 173–174 (1979). In contrast, for title\r\npurposes, the inquiry depends only on navigation and not\r\non interstate travel. See Utah, supra, at 76. This list of\r\ndifferences is not exhaustive. Indeed, “[e]ach application\r\nof [the Daniel Ball] test . . . is apt to uncover variations\r\nand refinements which require further elaboration.” Ap-\r\npalachian Elec. Power Co., supra, at 406.\r\n                             IV \r\n\r\n                              A\r\n\r\n  The primary flaw in the reasoning of the Montana Su­\r\npreme Court lies in its treatment of the question of river\r\nsegments and overland portage.\r\n  To determine title to a riverbed under the equal-footing\r\ndoctrine, this Court considers the river on a segment­\r\nby-segment basis to assess whether the segment of the\r\nriver, under which the riverbed in dispute lies, is navigable\r\nor not. In United States v. Utah, for example, the Court\r\nnoted,\r\n     “the controversy relates only to the sections of the riv­\r\n     ers which are described in the complaint, and the\r\n     Master has limited his findings and conclusions as to\r\n     navigability accordingly. The propriety of this course,\r\n     in view of the physical characteristics of the streams,\r\n     is apparent. Even where the navigability of a river,\r\n     speaking generally, is a matter of common knowledge,\r\n     and hence one of which judicial notice may be taken,\r\n     it may yet be a question, to be determined upon evi­\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           15\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n    dence, how far navigability extends.” 283 U. S., at 77.\r\nThe Court went on to conclude, after reciting and as­\r\nsessing the evidence, that the Colorado River was naviga­\r\nble for its first roughly 4-mile stretch, nonnavigable for the\r\nnext roughly 36-mile stretch, and navigable for its remain­\r\ning 149 miles. Id., at 73–74, 79–81, 89. The Court noted\r\nthe importance of determining “the exact point at which\r\nnavigability may be deemed to end.” Id., at 90.\r\n  Similarly, in Brewer-Elliott Oil & Gas Co. v. United\r\nStates, 260 U. S. 77, 85 (1922), the Court examined the\r\nsegment of the Arkansas River that ran along the Osage\r\nIndian Reservation, assessing whether the Arkansas River\r\nwas “navigable in fact at the locus in quo.” The Court\r\nconcluded that the United States originally, and the Osag­\r\nes as its grantees, unequivocally held title to the riverbeds\r\nbecause the Arkansas River “is and was not navigable at\r\nthe place where the river bed lots, here in controversy,\r\nare.” Id., at 86. The Court found the segment of river\r\nalong the reservation to be nonnavigable even though a\r\nsegment of the river that began further downstream was\r\nnavigable. Ibid. See also Oklahoma, supra, at 583, 584,\r\n587–588, 589–591 (noting that “how far up the streams\r\nnavigability extended was not known”; assessing separate­\r\nly the segments of the Red River above and below its\r\nconfluence with the Washita River within Oklahoma’s\r\nborders; and concluding that neither segment, and hence\r\n“no part of the river within Oklahoma,” was navigable).\r\n  The Montana Supreme Court discounted the segment­\r\nby-segment approach of this Court’s cases, calling it\r\n“a piecemeal classification of navigability—with some\r\nstretches declared navigable, and others declared non­\r\nnavigable.” 355 Mont., at 440–442, 229 P. 3d, at 448–449.\r\nThis was error. The segment-by-segment approach to\r\nnavigability for title is well settled, and it should not be\r\ndisregarded. A key justification for sovereign ownership of\r\n16            PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nnavigable riverbeds is that a contrary rule would allow\r\nprivate riverbed owners to erect improvements on the\r\nriverbeds that could interfere with the public’s right to use\r\nthe waters as a highway for commerce. While the Federal\r\nGovernment and States retain regulatory power to protect\r\npublic navigation, allocation to the State of the beds un­\r\nderlying navigable rivers reduces the possibility of conflict\r\nbetween private and public interests. See Utah, supra, at\r\n82–83; Packer, 137 U. S., at 667. By contrast, segments\r\nthat are nonnavigable at the time of statehood are those\r\nover which commerce could not then occur. Thus, there is\r\nno reason that these segments also should be deemed\r\nowned by the State under the equal-footing doctrine.\r\n   Practical considerations also support segmentation.\r\nPhysical conditions that affect navigability often vary\r\nsignificantly over the length of a river. This is particularly\r\ntrue with longer rivers, which can traverse vastly different\r\nterrain and the flow of which can be affected by varying\r\nlocal climates. The Missouri River provides an excellent\r\nexample: Between its headwaters and mouth, it runs for\r\nover 2,000 miles out of steep mountains, through canyons\r\nand upon rocky beds, over waterfalls and rapids, and\r\nacross sandy plains, capturing runoff from snow melt and\r\nfarmland rains alike. These shifts in physical conditions\r\nprovide a means to determine appropriate start points and\r\nend points for the segment in question. Topographical and\r\ngeographical indicators may assist. See, e.g., Utah, supra,\r\nat 77–80 (gradient changes); Oklahoma, 258 U. S., at 589\r\n(location of tributary providing additional flow).\r\n   A segment approach to riverbed title allocation under\r\nthe equal-footing doctrine is consistent with the manner in\r\nwhich private parties seek to establish riverbed title. For\r\ncenturies, where title to the riverbed was not in the sover­\r\neign, the common-law rule for allocating riverbed title\r\namong riparian landowners involved apportionment de­\r\nfined both by segment (each landowner owns bed and soil\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          17\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nalong the length of his land adjacent) and thread (each\r\nlandowner owns bed and soil to the center of the stream).\r\nSee J. Angell, A Treatise on the Law of Watercourses\r\n18 (6th ed. 1869); Tyler v. Wilkinson, 24 F. Cas. 472, 474\r\n(No. 14,312) (CC RI 1827) (Story, J.). Montana, moreover,\r\ncannot suggest that segmentation is inadministrable when\r\nthe state courts managed to divide up and apportion the\r\nunderlying riverbeds for purposes of determining their\r\nvalue and the corresponding rents owed by PPL.\r\n  The Montana Supreme Court, relying upon Utah, de-\r\ncided that the segment-by-segment approach is inapplicable\r\nhere because it “does not apply to ‘short interruption[s] of\r\nnavigability in a stream otherwise navigable.’ ” 355 Mont.,\r\nat 442, 229 P. 3d, at 449 (quoting Utah, 283 U. S., at 77).\r\nThis was mistaken. In Utah, this Court noted in pass­\r\ning that the facts of the case concerned “long reaches\r\nwith particular characteristics of navigability or non­\r\nnavigability” rather than “short interruption[s].” Id., at\r\n77. The Court in Utah did not say the case would have a\r\ndifferent outcome if a “short interruption” were concerned.\r\nIbid.\r\n  Even if the law might find some nonnavigable segments\r\nso minimal that they merit treatment as part of a longer,\r\nnavigable reach for purposes of title under the equal­\r\nfooting doctrine, it is doubtful that any of the segments in\r\nthis case would meet that standard, and one—the Great\r\nFalls reach—certainly would not. As an initial matter, the\r\nkinds of considerations that would define a de minimis\r\nexception to the segment-by-segment approach would be\r\nthose related to principles of ownership and title, such as\r\ninadministrability of parcels of exceedingly small size,\r\nor worthlessness of the parcels due to overdivision. See\r\nHeller, The Tragedy of the Anticommons, 111 Harv. L.\r\nRev. 621, 682–684 (1998) (explaining that dividing prop-\r\nerty into square-inch parcels, could, absent countervail-\r\ning legal mechanisms, “paralyze the alienability of scarce\r\n18            PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nresources . . . or diminish their value too drastically”). An\r\nanalysis of segmentation must be sensibly applied. A\r\ncomparison of the nonnavigable segment’s length to the\r\noverall length of the stream, for instance, would be simply\r\nirrelevant to the issue at hand.\r\n   A number of the segments at issue here are both dis­\r\ncrete, as defined by physical features characteristic of\r\nnavigability or nonnavigability, and substantial, as a\r\nmatter of administrability for title purposes. This is best\r\nillustrated by the Great Falls reach, which is 17 miles long\r\nand has distinct drops including five waterfalls and con­\r\ntinuous rapids in between. There is plenty of reason to\r\ndoubt that reach’s navigability based on the presence of\r\nthe series of falls. There is also reason to think that title\r\nto that segment of bed would not be worthless or inadmin­\r\nistrable. Indeed, the State sought and was awarded rent\r\nin the amount of $41 million for PPL’s various hydroelec­\r\ntric facilities attached to the riverbeds, half of which are\r\nalong the Great Falls reach.\r\n   Applying its “short interruptions” approach, the Mon­\r\ntana Supreme Court decided that the Great Falls reach\r\nwas navigable because it could be managed by way of land\r\nroute portage. 355 Mont., at 440, 442, 229 P. 3d, at 447,\r\n449. The court noted in particular the portage of Lewis\r\nand Clark’s expedition. Ibid. Yet that very portage re­\r\nveals the problem with the Montana Supreme Court’s\r\nanalysis. Leaving behind their larger boats, Lewis and\r\nClark transported their supplies and some small canoes\r\nabout 18 miles over land, which took at least 11 days and\r\nprobably more. See Lewis and Clark Journals 126–152;\r\n9 Journals of the Lewis & Clark Expedition 173; Dear\r\nBrother 109. Even if portage were to take travelers only\r\none day, its significance is the same: it demonstrates the\r\nneed to bypass the river segment, all because that part of\r\nthe river is nonnavigable. Thus, the Montana Supreme\r\nCourt was wrong to state, with respect to the Great Falls\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)           19\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nreach and other stretches of the rivers in question, that\r\nportages “are not sufficient to defeat a finding of navigabil­\r\nity.” 355 Mont., at 438, 229 P. 3d, at 446. In most cases,\r\nthey are, because they require transportation over land\r\nrather than over the water. This is such a case, at least as\r\nto the Great Falls reach.\r\n   In reaching its conclusion that the necessity of portage\r\ndoes not undermine navigability, the Montana Supreme\r\nCourt misapplied this Court’s decision in The Montello, 20\r\nWall. 430. See 355 Mont., at 438, 229 P. 3d, at 446. The\r\nconsideration of portage in The Montello was for a differ­\r\nent purpose. The Court did not seek to determine whether\r\nthe river in question was navigable for title purposes but\r\ninstead whether it was navigable for purposes of deter­\r\nmining whether boats upon it could be regulated by the\r\nFederal Government. 20 Wall., at 439, 445. The primary\r\nfocus in The Montello was not upon navigability in fact\r\nbut upon whether the river was a “navigable water of the\r\nUnited States.” Id., at 439, 443. The latter inquiry is\r\ndoctrinally distinct. It turns upon whether the river\r\n“forms by itself, or by its connection with other waters, a\r\ncontinued highway over which commerce is, or may be,\r\ncarried with other States or foreign countries in the cus­\r\ntomary modes in which such commerce is conducted by\r\nwater.” Id., at 439 (citing The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557).\r\nIt is language similar to “continued highway” that Mon­\r\ntana urges the Court to import into the title context in lieu\r\nof the Court’s established segmentation approach. Brief\r\nfor Respondent 42–43, n. 16.\r\n   The Montello reasonably concluded that the portages\r\nrequired in that case did not prevent the river from being\r\npart of a channel of interstate commerce. Portages con­\r\ntinued that channel because goods could be successfully\r\ntransported interstate, in part upon the waters in ques­\r\ntion. This provided sufficient basis to regulate steamboats\r\nat places where those boats could and did, in fact, navigate\r\n20             PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nportions of the river. 20 Wall., at 445. Here, by contrast,\r\nthe question regards ownership of the bed under river\r\nsegments that the Montana Supreme Court, by calling\r\nthem “interruptions in the navigation,” 355 Mont., at 442,\r\n229 P. 3d, at 449, acknowledges were nonnavigable. The\r\nreasoning and the inquiry of The Montello does not control\r\nthe outcome where the quite different concerns of the\r\nriverbed title context apply.\r\n   Having clarified that portages may defeat navigability\r\nfor title purposes, and do so with respect to the Great Falls\r\nreach, the Court sees no evidence in the record that could\r\ndemonstrate that the Great Falls reach was navigable.\r\nMontana does not dispute that overland portage was\r\nnecessary to traverse that reach. Indeed, the State admits\r\n“the falls themselves were not passable by boat at state­\r\nhood.” Brief for Respondent 10. And the trial court noted\r\nthe falls had never been navigated. App. to Pet. for\r\nCert. 137. Based on these statements, this Court now con­\r\ncludes, contrary to the Montana Supreme Court’s decision,\r\nthat the 17-mile Great Falls reach, at least from the head\r\nof the first waterfall to the foot of the last, is not navigable\r\nfor purposes of riverbed title under the equal-footing\r\ndoctrine.\r\n   This Court also determines, based on evidence in the\r\nrecord, that there is a significant likelihood that some of\r\nthe other river stretches in dispute also fail the federal\r\ntest of navigability for the purpose of determining title.\r\nFor example, as to the disputed segment of the Clark Fork\r\nRiver, the Montana Supreme Court incorrectly stated the\r\nsole evidence for nonnavigability “consists of conclusory\r\nstatements . . . without any specific factual support.” 355\r\nMont., at 440, 229 P. 3d, at 448. In fact, PPL introduced a\r\nreport of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers from 1891,\r\ntwo years after Montana’s date of statehood, documenting\r\nthat the portion of the Clark Fork river between Missoula\r\nand Lake Pend Oreille (which includes the location of\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            21\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nPPL’s Thompson Falls facility) had a fall of about 1,100\r\nfeet in 250 miles and “is a mountain torrential stream, full\r\nof rocks, rapids, and falls, . . . utterly unnavigable, and in-\r\ncapable of being made navigable except at an enormous\r\ncost.” 2 H. R. Exec. Doc., pt. 5, at 3250; see App. 379–380\r\n(Docket No. 169). The report based its conclusions on\r\nvarious failed attempts to navigate the river. It found the\r\nThompson Falls “a complete obstruction to navigation”\r\nand the river around that area “exceedingly rapid, rough,\r\nand full of rocks.” 2 H. R. Exec. Doc., pt. 5, at 3251. This\r\nwas consistent with a 1910 Federal District Court decree.\r\nThe decree adjudicated a title dispute between two private\r\nparties over the riverbed near and under Thompson Falls\r\nand declared the river at that place “was and is a non­\r\nnavigable stream incapable of carrying the products of\r\nthe country in the usual manner of water transportation.”\r\nSteele v. Donlan, Equity No. 950 (CC D Mont., July 19,\r\n1910), p. 1; see App. 380–381 (Docket No. 169). While the\r\nultimate decision as to this and the other disputed river\r\nstretches is to be determined, in the first instance, by the\r\nMontana courts upon remand, the relevant evidence\r\nshould be assessed in light of the principles discussed in\r\nthis opinion.\r\n                             B\r\n  The Montana Supreme Court further erred as a matter\r\nof law in its reliance upon the evidence of present-day,\r\nprimarily recreational use of the Madison River. Error is\r\nnot inherent in a court’s consideration of such evidence,\r\nbut the evidence must be confined to that which shows the\r\nriver could sustain the kinds of commercial use that, as a\r\nrealistic matter, might have occurred at the time of state­\r\nhood. Navigability must be assessed as of the time of\r\nstatehood, and it concerns the river’s usefulness for “ ‘trade\r\nand travel,’ ” rather than for other purposes. See Utah,\r\n283 U. S., at 75–76. Mere use by initial explorers or trap­\r\n22            PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\npers, who may have dragged their boats in or alongside\r\nthe river despite its nonnavigability in order to avoid\r\ngetting lost, or to provide water for their horses and them­\r\nselves, is not itself enough. See Oregon, 295 U. S., at\r\n20–21 (evidence that “trappers appear to have waded or\r\nwalked” through the river, dragging their boats rather\r\nthan floating them, had “no bearing on navigability”).\r\n   True, river segments are navigable not only if they\r\n“[were] used,” but also if they “[were] susceptible of being\r\nused,” as highways of commerce at the time of statehood.\r\nUtah, supra, at 76 (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nEvidence of recreational use, depending on its nature, may\r\nbear upon susceptibility of commercial use at the time of\r\nstatehood. See Appalachian Elec. Power Co., 311 U. S., at\r\n416 (“[P]ersonal or private use by boats demonstrates the\r\navailability of the stream for the simpler types of commer­\r\ncial navigation”); Utah, 283 U. S., at 82 (fact that actual\r\nuse has “been more of a private nature than of a public,\r\ncommercial sort . . . cannot be regarded as controlling”).\r\nSimilarly, poststatehood evidence, depending on its na­\r\nture, may show susceptibility of use at the time of state­\r\nhood. See id., at 82–83 (“[E]xtensive and continued\r\n[historical] use for commercial purposes” may be the “most\r\npersuasive” form of evidence, but the “crucial question” is\r\nthe potential for such use at the time of statehood, rather\r\nthan “the mere manner or extent of actual use”).\r\n   Evidence of present-day use may be considered to the\r\nextent it informs the historical determination whether the\r\nriver segment was susceptible of use for commercial navi­\r\ngation at the time of statehood. For the susceptibility\r\nanalysis, it must be determined whether trade and travel\r\ncould have been conducted “in the customary modes of\r\ntrade and travel on water,” over the relevant river seg­\r\nment “in [its] natural and ordinary condition.” Id., at 76\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted). At a minimum, there­\r\nfore, the party seeking to use present-day evidence for title\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          23\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\npurposes must show: (1) the watercraft are meaningfully\r\nsimilar to those in customary use for trade and travel\r\nat the time of statehood; and (2) the river’s poststatehood\r\ncondition is not materially different from its physical con-\r\ndition at statehood. See also Oregon, supra, at 18 (find-\r\ning that scientific and historical evidence showed that\r\nthe physical condition of particular water bodies had not\r\nvaried substantially since statehood in a way that might\r\naffect navigation). If modern watercraft permit navigabil­\r\nity where the historical watercraft would not, or if the\r\nriver has changed in ways that substantially improve its\r\nnavigability, then the evidence of present-day use has\r\nlittle or no bearing on navigability at statehood.\r\n   The Montana Supreme Court opinion offered no indica­\r\ntion that it made these necessary findings. The court\r\nconcluded the evidence of present-day use of the Madison\r\nwas probative of its susceptibility of use at statehood, but\r\nthere is no apparent basis for its conclusion. 355 Mont., at\r\n442–443, 438–439, 229 P. 3d, at 449, 446–447. The court\r\ndid not find the watercraft similar to those used at the\r\ntime of statehood, and the State’s evidence of present-day\r\nuse for recreational fishing did not indicate what types of\r\nboats are now used. App. 46–48. Modern recreational\r\nfishing boats, including inflatable rafts and lightweight\r\ncanoes or kayaks, may be able to navigate waters much\r\nmore shallow or with rockier beds than the boats custom­\r\narily used for trade and travel at statehood.\r\n   As to the river’s physical condition, the Montana Su­\r\npreme Court did not assess with care PPL’s evidence\r\nabout changes to the river’s flow and the location and\r\npattern of its channel since statehood. The affidavit of\r\nPPL’s expert in fluvial geomorphology—the study of river­\r\nrelated landforms—at least suggests that as a result of\r\nPPL’s dams, the river has become “less torrential” in high\r\nflow periods and less shallow in low flow periods. App.\r\n575–577 (Docket No. 170). Thus, the river may well be\r\n24            PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\neasier to navigate now than at statehood.\r\n   The Montana Supreme Court altogether ignored the\r\nexpert’s reasoning about the past condition of the river’s\r\nchannels and the significance of that information for\r\nnavigability. Further, contrary to the Montana Supreme\r\nCourt’s suggestion, the expert’s affidavit was not mere\r\nevidence of change in “seasonal variations” of water depth.\r\n355 Mont., at 440, 229 P. 3d, at 448. It provided meaning­\r\nful evidence that the river’s conditions had changed since\r\nstatehood in ways that made present-day navigation of the\r\nriver easier in all seasons than it was at the relevant time.\r\nWhile the Montana court was correct that a river need not\r\nbe susceptible of navigation at every point during the year,\r\nneither can that susceptibility be so brief that it is not a\r\ncommercial reality. Against this background, the present­\r\nday recreational use of the river did not bear on navigabil­\r\nity for purposes of title under the equal-footing doctrine.\r\nThe Montana Supreme Court’s reliance upon the State’s\r\nevidence of present-day, recreational use, at least without\r\nfurther inquiry, was wrong as a matter of law.\r\n                           C\r\n  The above analysis is sufficient to require reversal of\r\nthe grant of summary judgment to Montana. Therefore, the\r\nCourt declines to decide whether the Montana Supreme\r\nCourt further erred as to the burden of proof regarding\r\nnavigability.\r\n                            D\r\n  As a final contention, the State of Montana suggests\r\nthat denying the State title to the riverbeds here in dis­\r\npute will undermine the public trust doctrine, which con­\r\ncerns public access to the waters above those beds for\r\npurposes of navigation, fishing, and other recreational\r\nuses. Brief for Respondent 20, 24–26. This suggestion\r\nunderscores the State’s misapprehension of the equal\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

Its roots\r\ntrace to Roman civil law and its principles can be found in\r\nthe English common law on public navigation and fishing\r\nrights over tidal lands and in the state laws of this coun­\r\ntry. See Coeur d’Alene, 521 U. S., at 284–286; Illinois\r\nCentral R. Co. v. Illinois, 146 U. S. 387, 458 (1892);\r\nD. Slade, Putting the Public Trust Doctrine to Work 3–8,\r\n15–24 (1990); see, e.g., National Audubon Soc. v. Superior\r\nCourt of Alpine Cty., 33 Cal. 3d 419, 433–441, 658 P. 2d\r\n709, 718–724 (1983); Arnold v. Mundy, 6 N. J. L. 1, 9–10\r\n(1821). Unlike the equal-footing doctrine, however, which\r\nis the constitutional foundation for the navigability rule of\r\nriverbed title, the public trust doctrine remains a matter\r\nof state law, see Coeur d’Alene, supra, at 285 (Illinois\r\nCentral, a Supreme Court public trust case, was “ ‘neces­\r\nsarily a statement of Illinois law’ ”); Appleby v. City of New\r\nYork, 271 U. S. 364, 395 (1926) (same), subject as well to\r\nthe federal power to regulate vessels and navigation under\r\nthe Commerce Clause and admiralty power. While equal­\r\nfooting cases have noted that the State takes title to the\r\nnavigable waters and their beds in trust for the public, see\r\nShively, 152 U. S., at 49, 15–17, 24, 46, the contours of\r\nthat public trust do not depend upon the Constitution.\r\nUnder accepted principles of federalism, the States retain\r\nresidual power to determine the scope of the public trust\r\nover waters within their borders, while federal law deter­\r\nmines riverbed title under the equal-footing doctrine.\r\n                             V\r\n   As the litigation history of this case shows, Montana\r\nfiled its claim for riverbed rent over a century after the\r\nfirst of the dams was built upon the riverbeds. Montana\r\nhad not sought compensation before then, despite its full\r\nawareness of PPL’s hydroelectric projects and despite the\r\nState’s own participation in the projects’ federal licensing\r\n26            PPL MONTANA, LLC v. MONTANA\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nprocess. While this Court does not reach the question, it\r\nmay be that by virtue of the State’s sovereignty, neither\r\nlaches nor estoppel could apply in a strict sense to bar the\r\nState’s much belated claim. Still, the reliance by PPL and\r\nits predecessors in title upon the State’s long failure to\r\nassert title is some evidence to support the conclusion that\r\nthe river segments were nonnavigable for purposes of the\r\nequal-footing doctrine.\r\n   The Montana Supreme Court’s ruling that Montana\r\nowns and may charge for use of riverbeds across the\r\nState was based upon an infirm legal understanding of\r\nthis Court’s rules of navigability for title under the equal­\r\nfooting doctrine. As the Court said in Brewer-Elliott, “It is\r\nnot for a State by courts or legislature, in dealing with the\r\ngeneral subject of beds or streams, to adopt a retroactive\r\nrule for determining navigability which . . . would enlarge\r\nwhat actually passed to the State, at the time of her ad­\r\nmission, under the constitutional rule of equality here\r\ninvoked.” 260 U.
