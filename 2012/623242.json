MILLENDER, EXECUTOR OF\r\n   ESTATE OF MILLENDER, DECEASED, ET AL.\r\n\r\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\r\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\r\n\r\n  No. 10–704.     Argued December 5, 2011—Decided February 22, 2012\r\nShelly Kelly was afraid that she would be attacked by her boyfriend,\r\n  Jerry Ray Bowen, while she moved out of her apartment. She there-\r\n  fore requested police protection. Two officers arrived, but they were\r\n  called away to an emergency. As soon as the officers left, Bowen\r\n  showed up at the apartment, yelled “I told you never to call the cops\r\n  on me bitch!” and attacked Kelly, attempting to throw her over a se-\r\n  cond-story landing. After Kelly escaped to her car, Bowen pointed a\r\n  sawed-off shotgun at her and threatened to kill her if she tried to\r\n  leave. Kelly nonetheless sped away as Bowen fired five shots at the\r\n  car, blowing out one of its tires.\r\n     Kelly later met with Detective Curt Messerschmidt to discuss the\r\n  incident. She described the attack in detail, mentioned that Bowen\r\n  had previously assaulted her, that he had ties to the Mona Park\r\n  Crips gang, and that he might be staying at the home of his former\r\n  foster mother, Augusta Millender. Following this conversation, Mes-\r\n  serschmidt conducted a detailed investigation, during which he con-\r\n  firmed Bowen’s connection to the Millenders’ home, verified his\r\n  membership in two gangs, and learned that Bowen had been arrested\r\n  and convicted for numerous violent and firearm-related offenses.\r\n  Based on this investigation, Messerschmidt drafted an application\r\n  for a warrant authorizing a search of the Millenders’ home for all\r\n  firearms and ammunition, as well as evidence indicating gang\r\n  membership.\r\n     Messerschmidt included two affidavits in the warrant application.\r\n  The first detailed his extensive law enforcement experience and his\r\n  specialized training in gang-related crimes. The second, expressly in-\r\n  corporated into the search warrant, described the incident and ex-\r\n2                  MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                                 Syllabus\r\n\r\n    plained why Messerschmidt believed there was probable cause for the\r\n    search. It also requested that the warrant be endorsed for night ser-\r\n    vice because of Bowen’s gang ties. Before submitting the application\r\n    to a magistrate for approval, Messerschmidt had it reviewed by his\r\n    supervisor, Sergeant Robert Lawrence, as well as a police lieutenant\r\n    and a deputy district attorney. Messerschmidt then submitted the\r\n    application to a magistrate, who issued the warrant. The ensuing\r\n    search uncovered only Millender’s shotgun, a California Social Ser-\r\n    vices letter addressed to Bowen, and a box of .45-caliber ammunition.\r\n       The Millenders filed an action under 42 U. S. C. §1983 against pe-\r\n    titioners Messerschmidt and Lawrence, alleging that the officers had\r\n    subjected them to an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth\r\n    Amendment. The District Court granted summary judgment to the\r\n    Millenders, concluding that the firearm and gang-material aspects of\r\n    the search warrant were overbroad and that the officers were not en-\r\n    titled to qualified immunity from damages. The Ninth Circuit, sit-\r\n    ting en banc, affirmed the denial of qualified immunity. The court\r\n    held that the warrant’s authorization was unconstitutionally over-\r\n    broad because the affidavits and warrant failed to establish probable\r\n    cause that the broad categories of firearms, firearm-related material,\r\n    and gang-related material were contraband or evidence of a crime,\r\n    and that a reasonable officer would have been aware of the warrant’s\r\n    deficiency.\r\nHeld: The officers are entitled to qualified immunity. Pp. 8−19.\r\n    (a) Qualified immunity “protects government officials ‘from liability\r\n for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly es-\r\n tablished statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable\r\n person would have known.’ ” Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 231.\r\n Where the alleged Fourth Amendment violation involves a search or\r\n seizure pursuant to a warrant, the fact that a neutral magistrate has\r\n issued a warrant is the clearest indication that the officers acted in\r\n an objectively reasonable manner, or in “objective good faith.” United\r\n States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 922–923. Nonetheless, that fact does\r\n not end the inquiry into objective reasonableness. The Court has rec-\r\n ognized an exception allowing suit when “it is obvious that no rea-\r\n sonably competent officer would have concluded that a warrant\r\n should issue.” Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 341. The “shield of\r\n immunity” otherwise conferred by the warrant, id., at 345, will be\r\n lost, for example, where the warrant was “based on an affidavit so\r\n lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its\r\n existence entirely unreasonable.” Leon, 468 U. S., at 923. The\r\n threshold for establishing this exception is high. “[I]n the ordinary\r\n case, an officer cannot be expected to question the magistrate’s prob-\r\n able-cause determination” because “[i]t is the magistrate’s responsi-\r\n                   Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                    3\r\n\r\n                              Syllabus\r\n\r\nbility to determine whether the officer’s allegations establish proba-\r\nble cause and, if so, to issue a warrant comporting in form with the\r\nrequirements of the Fourth Amendment.” Leon, supra, at 921. Pp.\r\n8−10.\r\n   (b) This case does not fall within that narrow exception. It would\r\nnot be entirely unreasonable for an officer to believe that there was\r\nprobable cause to search for all firearms and firearm-related materi-\r\nals. Under the circumstances set forth in the warrant, an officer\r\ncould reasonably conclude that there was a “fair probability” that the\r\nsawed-off shotgun was not the only firearm Bowen owned, Illinois v.\r\nGates, 462 U. S. 213, 238, and that Bowen’s sawed-off shotgun was il-\r\nlegal. Cf. 26 U. S. C. §§ 5845(a), 5861(d). Given Bowen’s possession\r\nof one illegal gun, his gang membership, willingness to use the gun to\r\nkill someone, and concern about the police, it would not be unreason-\r\nable for an officer to conclude that Bowen owned other illegal guns.\r\nAn officer also could reasonably believe that seizure of firearms was\r\nnecessary to prevent further assaults on Kelly. California law allows\r\na magistrate to issue a search warrant for items “in the possession of\r\nany person with the intent to use them as a means of committing a\r\npublic offense,” Cal. Penal Code Ann. §1524(a)(3), and the warrant\r\napplication submitted by the officers specifically referenced this pro-\r\nvision as a basis for the search. Pp. 10–12.\r\n   (c) Regarding the warrant’s authorization to search for gang-\r\nrelated materials, a reasonable officer could view Bowen’s attack as\r\nmotivated not by the souring of his romantic relationship with Kelly\r\nbut by a desire to prevent her from disclosing details of his gang ac-\r\ntivity to the police. It would therefore not be unreasonable—based on\r\nthe facts set out in the affidavit—for an officer to believe that evi-\r\ndence of Bowen’s gang affiliation would prove helpful in prosecuting\r\nhim for the attack on Kelly, in supporting additional, related charges\r\nagainst Bowen for the assault, or in impeaching Bowen or rebutting\r\nhis defenses. Moreover, even if this were merely a domestic dispute,\r\na reasonable officer could still conclude that gang paraphernalia\r\nfound at the Millenders’ residence could demonstrate Bowen’s control\r\nover the premises or his connection to other evidence found there.\r\nPp. 12−16.\r\n   (d) The fact that the officers sought and obtained approval of the\r\nwarrant application from a superior and a deputy district attorney\r\nbefore submitting it to the magistrate provides further support for\r\nthe conclusion that an officer could reasonably have believed that the\r\nscope of the warrant was supported by probable cause. A contrary\r\nconclusion would mean not only that Messerschmidt and Lawrence\r\nwere “plainly incompetent” in concluding that the warrant was sup-\r\nported by probable cause, Malley, supra, at 341, but that their super-\r\n4                  MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                                  Syllabus\r\n\r\n    visor, the deputy district attorney, and the magistrate were as well.\r\n    Pp. 16−18.\r\n       (e) In holding that the warrant in this case was so obviously defec-\r\n    tive that no reasonable officer could have believed it to be valid, the\r\n    court below erred in relying on Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U. S. 551.\r\n    There, officers who carried out a warrant-approved search were not\r\n    entitled to qualified immunity because the warrant failed to describe\r\n    any of the items to be seized and “even a cursory reading of the war-\r\n    rant” would have revealed this defect. Id., at 557. Here, in contrast,\r\n    any arguable defect would have become apparent only upon a close\r\n    parsing of the warrant application, and a comparison of the support-\r\n    ing affidavit to the terms of the warrant to determine whether the af-\r\n    fidavit established probable cause to search for all the items listed in\r\n    the warrant. Unlike in Groh, any error here would not be one that\r\n    “just a simple glance” would have revealed. Id. at 564. Pp. 18−19.\r\n620 F. 3d 1016, reversed.\r\n\r\n  ROBERTS, C.

The warrant authorized a search for all guns\r\nand gang-related material, in connection with the investi-\r\ngation of a known gang member for shooting at his ex-\r\ngirlfriend with a pistol-gripped sawed-off shotgun, because\r\nshe had “call[ed] the cops” on him. App. 56. Respondents\r\nbrought an action seeking to hold the officers personally\r\nliable under 42 U. S. C. §1983, alleging that the search\r\nviolated their Fourth Amendment rights because there\r\nwas not sufficient probable cause to believe the items\r\nsought were evidence of a crime. In particular, respond-\r\nents argued that there was no basis to search for all\r\nguns simply because the suspect owned and had used a\r\nsawed-off shotgun, and no reason to search for gang mate-\r\nrial because the shooting at the ex-girlfriend for “call[ing]\r\nthe cops” was solely a domestic dispute. The Court of\r\n2             MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the warrant was\r\ninvalid, and that the officers were not entitled to immu-\r\nnity from personal liability because this invalidity was so\r\nobvious that any reasonable officer would have recognized\r\nit, despite the magistrate’s approval. We disagree and\r\nreverse.\r\n                               I\r\n\r\n                               A\r\n\r\n  Shelly Kelly decided to break off her romantic relation-\r\nship with Jerry Ray Bowen and move out of her apart-\r\nment, to which Bowen had a key. Kelly feared an attack\r\nfrom Bowen, who had previously assaulted her and had\r\nbeen convicted of multiple violent felonies. She therefore\r\nasked officers from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s De-\r\npartment to accompany her while she gathered her things.\r\nDeputies from the Sheriff ’s Department came to assist\r\nKelly but were called away to respond to an emergency\r\nbefore the move was complete.\r\n  As soon as the officers left, an enraged Bowen appeared\r\nat the bottom of the stairs to the apartment, yelling “I told\r\nyou never to call the cops on me bitch!” App. 39, 56.\r\nBowen then ran up the stairs to Kelly, grabbed her by her\r\nshirt, and tried to throw her over the railing of the second-\r\nstory landing. When Kelly successfully resisted, Bowen\r\nbit her on the shoulder and attempted to drag her inside\r\nthe apartment by her hair. Kelly again managed to escape\r\nBowen’s grasp, and ran to her car. By that time, Bowen\r\nhad retrieved a black sawed-off shotgun with a pistol grip.\r\nHe ran in front of Kelly’s car, pointed the shotgun at her,\r\nand told Kelly that if she tried to leave he would kill her.\r\nKelly leaned over, fully depressed the gas pedal, and sped\r\naway. Bowen fired at the car a total of five times, blowing\r\nout the car’s left front tire in the process, but Kelly man-\r\naged to escape.\r\n  Kelly quickly located police officers and reported the\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          3\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nassault. She told the police what had happened—that\r\nBowen had attacked her after becoming “angry because\r\nshe had called the Sheriff’s Department”—and she men-\r\ntioned that Bowen was “an active member of the ‘Mona\r\nPark Crips,’ ” a local street gang. Id., at 39. Kelly also\r\nprovided the officers with photographs of Bowen.\r\n   Detective Curt Messerschmidt was assigned to investi-\r\ngate the incident. Messerschmidt met with Kelly to obtain\r\ndetails of the assault and information about Bowen. Kelly\r\ndescribed the attack and informed Messerschmidt that she\r\nthought Bowen was staying at his foster mother’s home\r\nat 2234 East 120th Street. Kelly also informed Messer-\r\nschmidt of Bowen’s previous assaults on her and of his\r\ngang ties.\r\n   Messerschmidt then conducted a background check on\r\nBowen by consulting police records, California Depart-\r\nment of Motor Vehicles records, and the “cal-gang” data-\r\nbase. Based on this research, Messerschmidt confirmed\r\nBowen’s connection to the 2234 East 120th Street address.\r\nHe also confirmed that Bowen was an “active” member of\r\nthe Mona Park Crips and a “secondary” member of the\r\nDodge City Crips. Id., at 64. Finally, Messerschmidt\r\nlearned that Bowen had been arrested and convicted for\r\nnumerous violent and firearm-related offenses. Indeed, at\r\nthe time of the investigation, Bowen’s “rapsheet” spanned\r\nover 17 printed pages, and indicated that he had been\r\narrested at least 31 times. Nine of these arrests were for\r\nfirearms offenses and six were for violent crimes, includ-\r\ning three arrests for assault with a deadly weapon (fire-\r\narm). Id., at 72–81.\r\n   Messerschmidt prepared two warrants: one to authorize\r\nBowen’s arrest and one to authorize the search of 2234\r\nEast 120th Street. An attachment to the search warrant\r\ndescribed the property that would be the object of the\r\nsearch:\r\n4             MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n    “All handguns, rifles, or shotguns of any caliber, or\r\n    any firearms capable of firing ammunition, or fire-\r\n    arms or devices modified or designed to allow it [sic]\r\n    to fire ammunition. All caliber of ammunition, miscel-\r\n    laneous gun parts, gun cleaning kits, holsters which\r\n    could hold or have held any caliber handgun being\r\n    sought.

Additionally to include\r\n    any gang indicia that would establish the persons be-\r\n    ing sought in this warrant, affiliation or membership\r\n    with the ‘Mona Park Crips’ street gang.” Id., at 52.\r\n\r\n  Two affidavits accompanied Messerschmidt’s warrant ap-\r\nplications. The first affidavit described Messerschmidt’s\r\nextensive law enforcement experience, including that he\r\nhad served as a peace officer for 14 years, that he was\r\nthen assigned to a “specialized unit” “investigating gang\r\nrelated crimes and arresting gang members for various\r\nviolations of the law,” that he had been involved in “hun-\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

That affidavit described the facts of the incident\r\ninvolving Kelly and Bowen in great detail, including the\r\nweapon used in the assault. The affidavit recounted that\r\nKelly had identified Bowen as the assailant and that she\r\nthought Bowen might be found at 2234 East 120th Street.\r\nIt also reported that Messerschmidt had “conducted an\r\nextensive background search on the suspect by utilizing\r\ndepartmental records, state computer records, and other\r\npolice agency records,” and that from that information he\r\nhad concluded that Bowen resided at 2234 East 120th\r\nStreet. Id., at 58.\r\n   The affidavit requested that the search warrant be\r\nendorsed for night service because “information provided\r\nby the victim and the cal-gang data base” indicated that\r\nBowen had “gang ties to the Mona Park Crip gang” and\r\nthat “night service would provide an added element of\r\nsafety to the community as well as for the deputy person-\r\nnel serving the warrant.” Id., at 59. The affidavit con-\r\ncluded by noting that Messerschmidt “believe[d] that the\r\nitems sought” would be in Bowen’s possession and that\r\n“recovery of the weapon could be invaluable in the success-\r\nful prosecution of the suspect involved in this case, and\r\nthe curtailment of further crimes being committed.” Ibid.\r\n   Messerschmidt submitted the warrants to his super-\r\nvisors—Sergeant Lawrence and Lieutenant Ornales—for\r\nreview. Deputy District Attorney Janet Wilson also re-\r\nviewed the materials and initialed the search warrant,\r\nindicating that she agreed with Messerschmidt’s assess-\r\nment of probable cause. Id., at 27, 47. Finally, Messer-\r\n6             MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                    Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nschmidt submitted the warrants to a magistrate. The\r\nmagistrate approved the warrants and authorized night\r\nservice.\r\n  The search warrant was served two days later by a team\r\nof officers that included Messerschmidt and Lawrence.\r\nSheriff’s deputies forced open the front door of 2234 East\r\n120th Street and encountered Augusta Millender—a\r\nwoman in her seventies—and Millender’s daughter and\r\ngrandson. As instructed by the police, the Millenders\r\nwent outside while the residence was secured but re-\r\nmained in the living room while the search was conducted.\r\nBowen was not found in the residence. The search did,\r\nhowever, result in the seizure of Augusta Millender’s\r\nshotgun, a California Social Services letter addressed to\r\nBowen, and a box of .45-caliber ammunition.\r\n  Bowen was arrested two weeks later after Messer-\r\nschmidt found him hiding under a bed in a motel room.\r\n                             B\r\n   The Millenders filed suit in Federal District Court\r\nagainst the County of Los Angeles, the sheriff ’s depart-\r\nment, the sheriff, and a number of individual officers,\r\nincluding Messerschmidt and Lawrence. The complaint\r\nalleged, as relevant here, that the search warrant was\r\ninvalid under the Fourth Amendment. It sought damages\r\nfrom Messerschmidt and Lawrence, among others.\r\n   The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment\r\non the validity of the search warrant. The District Court\r\nfound the warrant defective in two respects. The District\r\nCourt concluded that the warrant’s authorization to\r\nsearch for firearms was unconstitutionally overbroad\r\nbecause the “crime specified here was a physical assault\r\nwith a very specific weapon”—a black sawed-off shotgun\r\nwith a pistol grip—negating any need to “search for all\r\nfirearms.” Millender v.

As a result, the District Court granted summary\r\njudgment to the Millenders on their constitutional chal-\r\nlenges to the firearm and gang material aspects of the\r\nsearch warrant. Id., at 160. The District Court also re-\r\njected the officers’ claim that they were entitled to quali-\r\nfied immunity from damages. Id., at 171.\r\n   Messerschmidt and Lawrence appealed, and a divided\r\npanel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit re-\r\nversed the District Court’s denial of qualified immunity.\r\n564 F. 3d 1143 (2009). The court held that the officers\r\nwere entitled to qualified immunity because “they reason-\r\nably relied on the approval of the warrant by a deputy\r\ndistrict attorney and a judge.” Id., at 1145.\r\n   The Court of Appeals granted rehearing en banc and\r\naffirmed the District Court’s denial of qualified immunity.\r\n620 F. 3d 1016 (CA9 2010). The en banc court concluded\r\nthat the warrant’s authorization was unconstitutionally\r\noverbroad because the affidavit and the warrant failed to\r\n“establish[ ] probable cause that the broad categories of\r\nfirearms, firearm-related material, and gang-related\r\nmaterial described in the warrant were contraband or\r\nevidence of a crime.” Id., at 1033. In the en banc court’s\r\nview, “the deputies had probable cause to search for a\r\nsingle, identified weapon . . . . They had no probable cause\r\nto search for the broad class of firearms and firearm-\r\nrelated materials described in the warrant.” Id., at 1027.\r\nIn addition, “[b]ecause the deputies failed to establish any\r\nlink between gang-related materials and a crime, the\r\nwarrant authorizing the search and seizure of all gang-\r\nrelated evidence [was] likewise invalid.” Id., at 1031.\r\nConcluding that “a reasonable officer in the deputies’\r\nposition would have been well aware of this deficiency,”\r\n8              MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nthe en banc court held that the officers were not entitled to\r\nqualified immunity. Id., at 1033–1035.\r\n  There were two separate dissenting opinions. Judge\r\nCallahan determined that “the officers had probable cause\r\nto search for and seize any firearms in the home in which\r\nBowen, a gang member and felon, was thought to reside.”\r\nId., at 1036. She also concluded that “the officers reason-\r\nably relied on their superiors, the district attorney, and\r\nthe magistrate to correct” any overbreadth in the warrant,\r\nand that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity\r\nbecause their actions were not objectively unreasonable.\r\nId., at 1044, 1049. Judge Silverman also dissented, con-\r\ncluding that the “deputies’ belief in the validity of . . . the\r\nwarrant was entirely reasonable” and that the “record\r\n[wa]s totally devoid of any evidence that the deputies\r\nacted other than in good faith.” Id., at 1050. Judge Tall-\r\nman joined both dissents.\r\n  We granted certiorari. 564 U. S. ___ (2011).\r\n                              II\r\n  The Millenders allege that they were subjected to an\r\nunreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amend-\r\nment because the warrant authorizing the search of their\r\nhome was not supported by probable cause. They seek\r\ndamages from Messerschmidt and Lawrence for their roles\r\nin obtaining and executing this warrant. The validity of\r\nthe warrant is not before us. The question instead is\r\nwhether Messerschmidt and Lawrence are entitled to im-\r\nmunity from damages, even assuming that the warrant\r\nshould not have been issued.\r\n  “The doctrine of qualified immunity protects govern-\r\nment officials ‘from liability for civil damages insofar as\r\ntheir conduct does not violate clearly established statutory\r\nor constitutional rights of which a reasonable person\r\nwould have known.’ ” Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223,\r\n231 (2009) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800,\r\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                   9\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n818 (1982)). Qualified immunity “gives government offi-\r\ncials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken\r\njudgments,” and “protects ‘all but the plainly incompetent\r\nor those who knowingly violate the law.’ ” Ashcroft v. al-\r\nKidd, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12) (quoting\r\nMalley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 341 (1986)). “[W]hether\r\nan official protected by qualified immunity may be held\r\npersonally liable for an allegedly unlawful official action\r\ngenerally turns on the ‘objective legal reasonableness’ of\r\nthe action, assessed in light of the legal rules that were\r\n‘clearly established’ at the time it was taken.” Anderson v.\r\nCreighton, 483 U. S. 635, 639 (1987) (citation omitted).\r\n   Where the alleged Fourth Amendment violation involves\r\na search or seizure pursuant to a warrant, the fact that a\r\nneutral magistrate has issued a warrant is the clearest\r\nindication that the officers acted in an objectively reason-\r\nable manner or, as we have sometimes put it, in “objective\r\ngood faith.” United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 922–923\r\n(1984).1 Nonetheless, under our precedents, the fact that\r\na neutral magistrate has issued a warrant authorizing the\r\nallegedly unconstitutional search or seizure does not end\r\nthe inquiry into objective reasonableness. Rather, we\r\nhave recognized an exception allowing suit when “it is\r\nobvious that no reasonably competent officer would have\r\nconcluded that a warrant should issue.” Malley, 475 U. S.,\r\nat 341. The “shield of immunity” otherwise conferred by\r\nthe warrant, id., at 345, will be lost, for example, where\r\nthe warrant was “based on an affidavit so lacking in indi-\r\ncia of probable cause as to render official belief in its exist-\r\n——————\r\n   1 Although Leon involved the proper application of the exclusionary\r\n\r\nrule to remedy a Fourth Amendment violation, we have held that “the\r\nsame standard of objective reasonableness that we applied in the con-\r\ntext of a suppression hearing in Leon defines the qualified immun-\r\nity accorded an officer” who obtained or relied on an allegedly invalid\r\nwarrant. Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 344 (1986) (citation omitted);\r\nGroh v. Ramirez, 540 U. S. 551, 565, n. 8 (2004).\r\n10               MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nence entirely unreasonable.” Leon, 468 U. S., at 923 (in-\r\nternal quotation marks omitted).2\r\n   Our precedents make clear, however, that the threshold\r\nfor establishing this exception is a high one, and it should\r\nbe. As we explained in Leon, “[i]n the ordinary case, an\r\nofficer cannot be expected to question the magistrate’s\r\nprobable-cause determination” because “[i]t is the magis-\r\ntrate’s responsibility to determine whether the officer’s\r\nallegations establish probable cause and, if so, to issue a\r\nwarrant comporting in form with the requirements of the\r\nFourth Amendment.” Id., at 921; see also Malley, supra,\r\nat 346, n. 9 (“It is a sound presumption that the magis-\r\ntrate is more qualified than the police officer to make a\r\nprobable cause determination, and it goes without saying\r\nthat where a magistrate acts mistakenly in issuing a\r\nwarrant but within the range of professional competence\r\nof a magistrate, the officer who requested the warrant\r\ncannot be held liable” (internal quotation marks and\r\ncitation omitted)).\r\n                              III\r\n  The Millenders contend, and the Court of Appeals held,\r\nthat their case falls into this narrow exception. According\r\nto the Millenders, the officers “failed to provide any facts\r\nor circumstances from which a magistrate could properly\r\nconclude that there was probable cause to seize the broad\r\nclasses of items being sought,” and “[n]o reasonable officer\r\n——————\r\n  2 The dissent relies almost entirely on facts outside the affidavit,\r\n\r\nincluding Messerschmidt’s deposition testimony, post, at 4, 11 (opinion\r\nof SOTOMAYOR, J.), crime analysis forms, post, at 5, Kelly’s interview,\r\npost, at 5–6, and n. 5, Messerschmidt’s notes regarding Kelly’s inter-\r\nview, post, at 5–6, n. 5, and even several briefs filed in the District\r\nCourt and the Court of Appeals, post, at 8–9, 12. In contrast, the\r\ndissent cites the probable cause affidavit itself only twice. See post, at\r\n12. There is no contention before us that the affidavit was misleading\r\nin omitting any of the facts on which the dissent relies. Cf. Leon, 468\r\nU. S., at 923.\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

We disagree.\r\n                              A\r\n   With respect to the warrant’s authorization to search for\r\nand seize all firearms, the Millenders argue that “a rea-\r\nsonably well-trained officer would have readily perceived\r\nthat there was no probable cause to search the house for\r\nall firearms and firearm-related items.” Id., at 32. Noting\r\nthat “the affidavit indicated exactly what item was evi-\r\ndence of a crime—the ‘black sawed off shotgun with a\r\npistol grip,’ ” they argue that “[n]o facts established that\r\nBowen possessed any other firearms, let alone that such\r\nfirearms (if they existed) were ‘contraband or evidence of a\r\ncrime.’ ” Ibid. (quoting App. 56).\r\n   Even if the scope of the warrant were overbroad in\r\nauthorizing a search for all guns when there was infor-\r\nmation only about a specific one, that specific one was a\r\nsawed-off shotgun with a pistol grip, owned by a known\r\ngang member, who had just fired the weapon five times in\r\npublic in an attempt to murder another person, on the\r\nasserted ground that she had “call[ed] the cops” on him.\r\nId., at 56. Under these circumstances—set forth in the\r\nwarrant—it would not have been unreasonable for an\r\nofficer to conclude that there was a “fair probability” that\r\nthe sawed-off shotgun was not the only firearm Bowen\r\nowned. Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 238 (1983). And\r\nit certainly would have been reasonable for an officer to\r\nassume that Bowen’s sawed-off shotgun was illegal. Cf. 26\r\nU. S. C. §§5845(a), 5861(d). Evidence of one crime is not\r\nalways evidence of several, but given Bowen’s possession\r\nof one illegal gun, his gang membership, his willingness\r\nto use the gun to kill someone, and his concern about\r\nthe police, a reasonable officer could conclude that there\r\nwould be additional illegal guns among others that Bowen\r\n12               MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nowned.3\r\n   A reasonable officer also could believe that seizure of the\r\nfirearms was necessary to prevent further assaults on\r\nKelly. California law allows a magistrate to issue a search\r\nwarrant for items “in the possession of any person with\r\nthe intent to use them as a means of committing a public\r\noffense,” Cal. Penal Code Ann. §1524(a)(3) (West 2011),\r\nand the warrant application submitted by the officers\r\nspecifically referenced this provision as a basis for the\r\nsearch. App. 48. Bowen had already attempted to murder\r\nKelly once with a firearm, and had yelled “I’ll kill you” as\r\nshe tried to escape from him. Id., at 56–57. A reasonable\r\nofficer could conclude that Bowen would make another\r\nattempt on Kelly’s life and that he possessed other fire-\r\narms “with the intent to use them” to that end. Cal. Penal\r\nCode Ann. §1524(a)(3).\r\n   Given the foregoing, it would not have been “entirely\r\nunreasonable” for an officer to believe, in the particular\r\ncircumstances of this case, that there was probable cause\r\nto search for all firearms and firearm-related materials.\r\nLeon, supra, at 923 (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n   With respect to the warrant’s authorization to search for\r\nevidence of gang membership, the Millenders contend that\r\n“no reasonable officer could have believed that the affida-\r\nvit presented to the magistrate contained a sufficient basis\r\nto conclude that the gang paraphernalia sought was con-\r\ntraband or evidence of a crime.” Brief for Respondents 28.\r\nThey argue that “the magistrate [could not] have reasona-\r\nbly concluded, based on the affidavit, that Bowen’s gang\r\nmembership had anything to do with the crime under\r\ninvestigation” because “[t]he affidavit described a ‘spousal\r\n——————\r\n   3 The dissent caricatures our analysis as being that “because Bowen\r\n\r\nfired one firearm, it was reasonable for the police to conclude . . . that\r\n[he] must have possessed others,” post, at 10 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR,\r\nJ.). This simply avoids coming to grips with the facts of the crime at\r\nissue.\r\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                   13\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nassault’ that ensued after Kelly decided to end her ‘on\r\ngoing dating relationship’ with Bowen” and “[n]othing in\r\nthat description suggests that the crime was gang-\r\nrelated.” Ibid. (quoting App. 55).\r\n   This effort to characterize the case solely as a domes-\r\ntic dispute, however, is misleading.        Cf. post, at 5\r\n(SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting); post, at 2 (KAGAN, J., concur-\r\nring in part and dissenting in part). Messerschmidt began\r\nhis affidavit in support of the warrant by explaining that\r\nhe “has been investigating an assault with a deadly weap-\r\non incident” and elaborated that the crime was a “spousal\r\nassault and an assault with a deadly weapon.” App. 55\r\n(emphasis added). The affidavit also stated that Bowen\r\nwas “a known Mona Park Crip gang member” “based on\r\ninformation provided by the victim and the cal-gang data-\r\nbase,”4 and that he had attempted to murder Kelly after\r\nbecoming enraged that she had “call[ed] the cops on\r\n[him].” Id., at 56, 58–59. A reasonable officer could cer-\r\ntainly view Bowen’s attack as motivated not by the sour-\r\ning of his romantic relationship with Kelly but instead by\r\na desire to prevent her from disclosing details of his gang\r\nactivity to the police. She was, after all, no longer linked\r\nwith him as a girlfriend; he had assaulted her in the past;\r\nand she had indeed called the cops on him. And, as the\r\naffidavit supporting the warrant made clear, Kelly had in\r\nfact given the police information about Bowen’s gang ties.\r\nId., at 59.5\r\n——————\r\n  4 Although the cal-gang database states that information contained\r\n\r\ntherein cannot be used to establish probable cause, see App. 64, the\r\naffidavit makes clear that Kelly also provided this information to\r\nMesserschmidt, id., at 59, as she did to the deputies who initially\r\nresponded to the attack, id., at 39 (describing Kelly’s statement that\r\nBowen was “an active member of the ‘Mona Park Crips’ ”). We there-\r\nfore need not decide whether the cal-gang database’s disclaimer is\r\nrelevant to Fourth Amendment analysis.\r\n  5 Contrary to the dissent’s suggestion, see post, at 5–6, n. 5 (opinion\r\n\r\nof SOTOMAYOR, J.), the affidavit’s account of Bowen’s statements is\r\n14               MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   It would therefore not have been unreasonable—based\r\non the facts set out in the affidavit—for an officer to be-\r\nlieve that evidence regarding Bowen’s gang affiliation\r\nwould prove helpful in prosecuting him for the attack on\r\nKelly. See Warden, Md. Penitentiary v. Hayden, 387 U. S.\r\n294, 307 (1967) (holding that the Fourth Amendment\r\nallows a search for evidence when there is “probable cause\r\n. . . to believe that the evidence sought will aid in a partic-\r\nular apprehension or conviction”). Not only would such\r\nevidence help to establish motive, either apart from or in\r\naddition to any domestic dispute, it would also support the\r\nbringing of additional, related charges against Bowen for\r\nthe assault. See, e.g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. §136.1(b)(1)\r\n(West 1999) (It is a crime to “attempt[ ] to prevent or\r\ndissuade another person who has been the victim of a\r\ncrime or who is witness to a crime from . . . [m]aking any\r\nreport of that victimization to any . . . law enforcement\r\nofficer”).6\r\n——————\r\nconsistent with other accounts of the confrontation, in particular the\r\nreport prepared by the officers who spoke with Kelly immediately after\r\nthe attack. See App. 39 (stating that when Bowen “appeared at the\r\nbase of the stairs and began yelling at [Kelly,] [h]e was angry because\r\nshe had called the Sheriff ’s Department”). And at no point during this\r\nlitigation has the accuracy of the affidavit’s account of the attack been\r\ncalled into question.\r\n   6 The dissent relies heavily on Messerschmidt’s deposition, in which\r\n\r\nhe stated that Bowen’s crime was not a “gang crime.” See post, at 4–7.\r\nMesserschmidt’s belief about the nature of the crime, however, is not\r\ninformation he possessed but a conclusion he reached based on infor-\r\nmation known to him. See Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 641\r\n(1987). We have “eschew[ed] inquiries into the subjective beliefs of law\r\nenforcement officers who seize evidence pursuant to a subsequently\r\ninvalidated warrant.” United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 922, n. 23\r\n(1984); see also Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 815–819 (1982). In\r\nany event, as the dissent recognizes, the inquiry under our precedents\r\nis whether “a reasonably well-trained officer in petitioner’s position\r\nwould have known that his affidavit failed to establish probable cause.”\r\nMalley, 475 U. S., at 345 (emphasis added). Messerschmidt’s own\r\nevaluation does not answer the question whether it would have been\r\n                      Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                    15\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   In addition, a reasonable officer could believe that evi-\r\ndence demonstrating Bowen’s membership in a gang\r\nmight prove helpful in impeaching Bowen or rebutting\r\nvarious defenses he could raise at trial. For example,\r\nevidence that Bowen had ties to a gang that uses guns\r\nsuch as the one he used to assault Kelly would certainly be\r\nrelevant to establish that he had familiarity with or access\r\nto this type of weapon.\r\n   Moreover, even if this were merely a domestic dispute, a\r\nreasonable officer could still conclude that gang parapher-\r\nnalia found at the Millenders’ residence would aid in\r\nthe prosecution of Bowen by, for example, demonstrating\r\nBowen’s connection to other evidence found there. The\r\nwarrant authorized a search for “any gang indicia that\r\nwould establish the persons being sought in this warrant,”\r\nand “[a]rticles of personal property tending to establish\r\nthe identity of [the] person in control of the premise or\r\npremises.” App. 52. Before the District Court, the Millen-\r\nders “acknowledge[d] that evidence of who controlled the\r\npremises would be relevant if incriminating evidence were\r\nfound and it became necessary to tie that evidence to a\r\nperson, ” and the District Court approved that aspect of\r\nthe warrant on this basis. App. to Pet. for Cert. 158–159\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Given Bowen’s known\r\ngang affiliation, a reasonable officer could conclude that\r\ngang paraphernalia found at the residence would be an\r\neffective means of demonstrating Bowen’s control over the\r\npremises or his connection to evidence found there.7\r\n——————\r\nunreasonable for an officer to have reached a different conclusion from\r\nthe facts in the affidavit. See n. 2, supra.\r\n  7 The Fourth Amendment does not require probable cause to believe\r\n\r\nevidence will conclusively establish a fact before permitting a search,\r\nbut only “probable cause . . . to believe the evidence sought will aid in a\r\nparticular apprehension or conviction.” Warden, Md. Penitentiary v.\r\nHayden, 387 U. S. 294, 307 (1967) (emphasis added). Even if gang\r\nevidence might have turned out not to be conclusive because other\r\n16               MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   Whatever the use to which evidence of Bowen’s gang\r\ninvolvement might ultimately have been put, it would not\r\nhave been “entirely unreasonable” for an officer to believe\r\nthat the facts set out in the affidavit established a fair\r\nprobability that such evidence would aid the prosecution\r\nof Bowen for the criminal acts at issue. Leon, 468 U. S., at\r\n923 (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n                              B\r\n   Whether any of these facts, standing alone or taken\r\ntogether, actually establish probable cause is a question\r\nwe need not decide. Qualified immunity “gives govern-\r\nment officials breathing room to make reasonable but\r\nmistaken judgments.” al-Kidd, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\r\nat 12). The officers’ judgment that the scope of the war-\r\nrant was supported by probable cause may have been\r\nmistaken, but it was not “plainly incompetent.” Malley,\r\n475 U. S., at 341.\r\n   On top of all this, the fact that the officers sought and\r\nobtained approval of the warrant application from a supe-\r\nrior and a deputy district attorney before submitting it to\r\nthe magistrate provides further support for the conclusion\r\nthat an officer could reasonably have believed that the\r\nscope of the warrant was supported by probable cause.\r\nIbid. Before seeking to have the warrant issued by a\r\nmagistrate, Messerschmidt conducted an extensive inves-\r\ntigation into Bowen’s background and the facts of the\r\ncrime. Based on this investigation, Messerschmidt pre-\r\npared a detailed warrant application that truthfully laid\r\n——————\r\nmembers of the Millender household also had gang ties, see post, at 8\r\n(opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.); post, at 2–3 (opinion of KAGAN, J.), a rea-\r\nsonable officer could still conclude that evidence of gang membership\r\nwould help show Bowen’s connection to the residence. Such evidence\r\ncould, for example, have displayed Bowen’s gang moniker (“C Jay”)\r\nor could have been identified by Kelly as belonging to Bowen. See\r\nApp. 64.\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

The only facts omitted—the offi-\r\ncers’ knowledge of Bowen’s arrest and conviction records,\r\nsee supra, at 3—would only have strengthened the war-\r\nrant. Messerschmidt then submitted the warrant applica-\r\ntion for review by Lawrence, another superior officer, and\r\na deputy district attorney, all of whom approved the appli-\r\ncation without any apparent misgivings. Only after this\r\ndid Messerschmidt seek the approval of a neutral magis-\r\ntrate, who issued the requested warrant. The officers thus\r\n“took every step that could reasonably be expected of\r\nthem.” Massachusetts v. Sheppard, 468 U. S. 981, 989\r\n(1984). In light of the foregoing, it cannot be said that “no\r\nofficer of reasonable competence would have requested the\r\nwarrant.” Malley, 475 U. S., at 346, n. 9. Indeed, a con-\r\ntrary conclusion would mean not only that Messerschmidt\r\nand Lawrence were “plainly incompetent,” id., at 341, but\r\nthat their supervisor, the deputy district attorney, and the\r\nmagistrate were as well.\r\n   The Court of Appeals, however, gave no weight to the\r\nfact that the warrant had been reviewed and approved\r\nby the officers’ superiors, a deputy district attorney, and a\r\nneutral magistrate. Relying on Malley, the court held that\r\nthe officers had an “independent responsibility to ensure\r\nthere [was] at least a colorable argument for probable\r\ncause.” 620 F. 3d, at 1034. It explained that “[t]he depu-\r\nties here had a responsibility to exercise their reasonable\r\nprofessional judgment,” and that “in circumstances such\r\nas these a neutral magistrate’s approval (and, a fortiori,\r\na non-neutral prosecutor’s) cannot absolve an officer of\r\nliability.” Ibid. (citation omitted).\r\n   We rejected in Malley the contention that an officer is\r\nautomatically entitled to qualified immunity for seeking a\r\nwarrant unsupported by probable cause, simply because\r\na magistrate had approved the application. 475 U. S., at\r\n345. And because the officers’ superior and the deputy\r\ndistrict attorney are part of the prosecution team, their\r\n18            MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nreview also cannot be regarded as dispositive. But by\r\nholding in Malley that a magistrate’s approval does not\r\nautomatically render an officer’s conduct reasonable, we\r\ndid not suggest that approval by a magistrate or review\r\nby others is irrelevant to the objective reasonableness of\r\nthe officers’ determination that the warrant was valid.\r\nIndeed, we expressly noted that we were not deciding\r\n“whether [the officer’s] conduct in [that] case was in fact\r\nobjectively reasonable.” Id., at 345, n. 8. The fact that the\r\nofficers secured these approvals is certainly pertinent in\r\nassessing whether they could have held a reasonable belief\r\nthat the warrant was supported by probable cause.\r\n                             C\r\n    In holding that the warrant in this case was so obvious-\r\nly defective that no reasonable officer could have believed\r\nit was valid, the court below relied heavily on our decision\r\nin Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U. S. 551 (2004), but that prece-\r\ndent is far afield. There, we held that officers who carried\r\nout a warrant-approved search were not entitled to quali-\r\nfied immunity because the warrant in question failed to\r\ndescribe the items to be seized at all. Id., at 557. We\r\nexplained that “[i]n the portion of the form that called for\r\na description of the ‘person or property’ to be seized, [the\r\napplicant] typed a description of [the target’s] two-story\r\nblue house rather than the alleged stockpile of firearms.”\r\nId., at 554. Thus, the warrant stated nonsensically that\r\n“ ‘there is now concealed [on the specified premises] a\r\ncertain person or property, namely [a] single dwelling\r\nresidence two story in height which is blue in color and\r\nhas two additions attached to the east.’ ” Id., at 554–555,\r\nn. 2 (bracketed material in original). Because “even a\r\ncursory reading of the warrant in [that] case—perhaps\r\njust a simple glance—would have revealed a glaring de-\r\nficiency that any reasonable police officer would have\r\nknown was constitutionally fatal,” id., at 564, we held that\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          19\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nthe officer was not entitled to qualified immunity.\r\n   The instant case is not remotely similar. In contrast to\r\nGroh, any defect here would not have been obvious from\r\nthe face of the warrant. Rather, any arguable defect\r\nwould have become apparent only upon a close parsing of\r\nthe warrant application, and a comparison of the affidavit\r\nto the terms of the warrant to determine whether the\r\naffidavit established probable cause to search for all the\r\nitems listed in the warrant. This is not an error that\r\n“just a simple glance” would have revealed. Ibid. Indeed,\r\nunlike in Groh, the officers here did not merely submit\r\ntheir application to a magistrate. They also presented it\r\nfor review by a superior officer, and a deputy district\r\nattorney, before submitting it to the magistrate. The fact\r\nthat none of the officials who reviewed the application\r\nexpressed concern about its validity demonstrates that\r\nany error was not obvious. Groh plainly does not control\r\nthe result here.\r\n                        *    *     *\r\n  The question in this case is not whether the magistrate\r\nerred in believing there was sufficient probable cause to\r\nsupport the scope of the warrant he issued. It is instead\r\nwhether the magistrate so obviously erred that any rea-\r\nsonable officer would have recognized the error. The\r\noccasions on which this standard will be met may be rare,\r\nbut so too are the circumstances in which it will be appro-\r\npriate to impose personal liability on a lay officer in the\r\nface of judicial approval of his actions. Even if the war-\r\nrant in this case were invalid, it was not so obviously\r\nlacking in probable cause that the officers can be con-\r\nsidered “plainly incompetent” for concluding otherwise.\r\nMalley, supra, at 341. The judgment of the Court of Ap-\r\npeals denying the officers qualified immunity must there-\r\nfore be reversed.\r\n                                           It is so ordered.\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

In\r\nsupport of this conclusion, it cites two sets of circum-\r\nstances. First, the majority points to “Bowen’s possession\r\nof one illegal gun, his gang membership, his willingness to\r\nuse the gun to kill someone, and his concern about the\r\npolice . . . .” Ante, at 11. Second, the majority notes that\r\n“[a] reasonable officer also could believe that seizure of the\r\nfirearms was necessary to prevent further assaults on\r\nKelly,” because “Bowen had already attempted to murder\r\nKelly once with a firearm, and had yelled ‘I’ll kill you’ as\r\nshe tried to escape from him.” Ante, at 12. In my view,\r\ngiven all these circumstances together, the officers could\r\nreasonably have believed that the scope of their search\r\nwas supported by probable cause.

I think the right\r\nanswer lies in between, although the Court makes the\r\nmore far-reaching error.\r\n   I agree with the Court that a reasonably competent\r\npolice officer could have thought this warrant valid in\r\nauthorizing a search for all firearms and related items.\r\nSee ante, at 11–12. The warrant application recounted\r\nthat a known gang member had used a sawed-off shot-\r\ngun—an illegal weapon under California law, see Cal.\r\nPenal Code Ann. §33215 (West 2012 Cum. Supp.)—to try\r\nto kill another person. See App. 56–57, 59. Perhaps gang\r\nties plus possession of an unlawful gun plus use of that\r\ngun to commit a violent assault do not add up to what was\r\nneeded for this search: probable cause to believe that\r\nBowen had additional illegal firearms (or legal firearms\r\nthat he intended to use to violate the law) at the place he\r\nwas staying. But because our and the Ninth Circuit’s\r\ndecisions leave that conclusion debatable, a reasonable\r\n2             MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of KAGAN, J.\r\n\r\npolice officer could have found the warrant adequately\r\nsupported by “indicia of probable cause.” Malley v. Briggs,\r\n475 U. S. 335, 345 (1986). So Messerschmidt and his\r\nfellow officers should receive qualified immunity for their\r\nsearch for firearms.\r\n   The Court, however, goes astray when it holds that a\r\nreasonable officer could have thought the warrant valid in\r\napproving a search for evidence of “street gang member-\r\nship,” App. 52. Membership in even the worst gang does\r\nnot violate California law, so the officers could not search\r\nfor gang paraphernalia just to establish Bowen’s ties to\r\nthe Crips. Instead, the police needed probable cause to\r\nbelieve that such items would provide evidence of an\r\nactual crime—and as the Court acknowledges, see ante, at\r\n12–14, the only crime mentioned in the warrant applica-\r\ntion was the assault on Kelly. The problem for the Court\r\nis that nothing in the application supports a link between\r\nBowen’s gang membership and that shooting. Contra the\r\nCourt’s elaborate theory-spinning, see ante, at 12–16,\r\nMesserschmidt’s affidavit in fact characterized the violent\r\nassault only as a domestic dispute, not as a gang-related\r\none, see App. 55 (describing the crime as a “spousal as-\r\nsault and an assault with a deadly weapon”). And that\r\ndescription is consistent with the most natural under-\r\nstanding of the events. The warrant application thus had\r\na hole at its very center: It lacked any explanation of how\r\ngang items would (or even might) provide evidence of the\r\ndomestic assault the police were investigating.\r\n   To fill this vacuum, the Court proposes an alternative,\r\nbut similarly inadequate justification—that gang para-\r\nphernalia could have demonstrated Bowen’s connection to\r\nthe Millender residence and to any evidence of the assault\r\nfound there. The dissent rightly notes one difficulty with\r\nthis argument: The discovery of gang items would not\r\nhave established that Bowen was staying at the house,\r\ngiven that several other gang members regularly did so.\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)             3\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of KAGAN, J.\r\n\r\nSee post, at 8–9 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). And even\r\nsetting that issue aside, the Court’s reasoning proves far\r\ntoo much: It would sanction equally well a search for any\r\nof Bowen’s possessions on the premises—a result impos-\r\nsible to square with the Fourth Amendment. See, e.g.,\r\nAndresen v. Maryland, 427 U. S. 463, 480 (1976) (disap-\r\nproving “ ‘a general, exploratory rummaging in a person’s\r\nbelongings’ ” (quoting Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403\r\nU. S. 443, 467 (1971))). In authorizing a search for all\r\ngang-related items, the warrant far outstripped the offic-\r\ners’ probable cause. Because a reasonable officer would\r\nhave recognized that defect, I would not award qualified\r\nimmunity to Messerschmidt and his colleagues for this\r\naspect of their search.\r\n  Still more fundamentally, the Court errs in scolding the\r\nCourt of Appeals for failing to give “weight to the fact that\r\nthe warrant had been reviewed and approved by the offic-\r\ners’ superiors, a deputy district attorney, and a neutral\r\nmagistrate.” Ante, at 17. As the dissent points out,\r\nsee post, at 13–15, this Court’s holding in Malley is to\r\nthe opposite effect: An officer is not “entitled to rely on the\r\njudgment of a judicial officer in finding that probable\r\ncause exists and hence issuing the warrant.” 475 U. S., at\r\n345. Malley made clear that qualified immunity turned\r\non the officer’s own “professional judgment,” considered\r\nseparately from the mistake of the magistrate. Id., at 346;\r\nsee ibid., n. 9 (“The officer . . . cannot excuse his own\r\ndefault by pointing to the greater incompetence of the\r\nmagistrate”); id., at 350 (Powell, J., concurring in part and\r\ndissenting in part) (objecting to the Court’s decision to\r\n“give little evidentiary weight to the finding of probable\r\ncause by a magistrate”). And what we said in Malley\r\nabout a magistrate’s authorization applies still more\r\nstrongly to the approval of other police officers or state\r\nattorneys. All those individuals, as the Court puts it, are\r\n“part of the prosecution team.” Ante, at 18. To make their\r\n4             MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                    Opinion of KAGAN, J.\r\n\r\nviews relevant is to enable those teammates (whether\r\nacting in good or bad faith) to confer immunity on each\r\nother for unreasonable conduct—like applying for a war-\r\nrant without anything resembling probable cause.\r\n  For these reasons, I would reverse in part and affirm in\r\npart the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and I would\r\nremand this case for further proceedings.\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

United States, 282 U. S. 344, 357\r\n(1931). The Fourth Amendment was adopted specifically\r\nin response to the Crown’s practice of using general war-\r\nrants and writs of assistance to search “suspected places”\r\nfor evidence of smuggling, libel, or other crimes. Boyd v.\r\nUnited States, 116 U. S. 616, 625–626 (1886). Early patri-\r\nots railed against these practices as “the worst instrument\r\nof arbitrary power” and John Adams later claimed that\r\n“the child Independence was born” from colonists’ opposi-\r\ntion to their use.

S., at 357, the Framers established the inviolable\r\nprinciple that should resolve this case: “no Warrants shall\r\nissue, but upon probable cause . . . and particularly de-\r\nscribing the . . . things to be seized.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 4.\r\nThat is, the police must articulate an adequate reason to\r\nsearch for specific items related to specific crimes.\r\n2              MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n    In this case, police officers investigating a specific, non-\r\ngang-related assault committed with a specific firearm (a\r\nsawed-off shotgun) obtained a warrant to search for all\r\nevidence related to “any Street Gang,” “[a]ny photographs\r\n. . . which may depict evidence of criminal activity,” and\r\n“any firearms.” App. 52. They did so for the asserted\r\nreason that the search might lead to evidence related to\r\nother gang members and other criminal activity, and that\r\nother “[v]alid warrants commonly allow police to search\r\nfor ‘firearms and ammunition.’ ” See infra, at 8–9. That\r\nkind of general warrant is antithetical to the Fourth\r\nAmendment.\r\n    The Court nonetheless concludes that the officers are\r\nentitled to qualified immunity because their conduct was\r\n“objectively reasonable.” I could not disagree more. All\r\n13 federal judges who previously considered this case\r\nhad little difficulty concluding that the police officers’\r\nsearch for any gang-related material violated the Fourth\r\nAmendment. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 28–29, 45, n. 7,\r\n73, 94, 157–158. And a substantial majority agreed that\r\nthe police’s search for both gang-related material and all\r\nfirearms not only violated the Fourth Amendment, but\r\nwas objectively unreasonable. Like them, I believe that\r\nany “reasonably well-trained officer in petitioner’s position\r\nwould have known that his affidavit failed to establish\r\nprobable cause.” Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 345\r\n(1986).\r\n    The Court also hints that a police officer’s otherwise\r\nunreasonable conduct may be excused by the approval of\r\na magistrate, or more disturbingly, another police officer.\r\nAnte, at 16–18. That is inconsistent with our focus on the\r\nobjective reasonableness of an officer’s decision to submit\r\na warrant application to a magistrate, and we long ago\r\nrejected it. See Malley, 475 U.

For all these reasons,\r\nI respectfully dissent.\r\n                             I\r\n   The Court holds that a well-trained officer could have\r\nreasonably concluded that there was probable cause to\r\nsearch the Millenders’ residence for any evidence of affilia-\r\ntion with “any Street Gang,” and “all handguns, rifles, or\r\nshotguns of any caliber, or any firearms capable of firing\r\nammunition.” App. 52.1 I cannot agree.\r\n                              A\r\n   Most troubling is the Court’s determination that peti-\r\ntioners reasonably could have concluded that they had\r\nprobable cause to search for all evidence of any gang affili-\r\nation in the Millenders’ home. The Court reaches this\r\nresult only by way of an unprecedented, post hoc recon-\r\nstruction of the crime that wholly ignores the police’s own\r\nconclusions, as well as the undisputed facts presented to\r\nthe District Court.\r\n   The Court primarily theorizes that “[a] reasonable of-\r\nficer could certainly view Bowen’s attack as motivated\r\nnot by the souring of his romantic relationship with Kelly\r\nbut instead by a desire to prevent her from disclosing\r\ndetails of his gang activity to the police.” Ante, at 13. The\r\nmajority therefore dismisses as “misleading” the Millen-\r\nders’ characterization of the case as a “domestic dispute,”\r\ninsisting that Detective Messerschmidt could have rea-\r\nsonably thought that the crime was gang related. See\r\nante, at 13–14.2\r\n——————\r\n  1 Not even the Court defends the warrant’s authorization to search for\r\n\r\n“[a]ny photographs . . . which may depict evidence of criminal activity.”\r\n  2 The Court implies Detective Messerschmidt did not consider the\r\n\r\ncrime “solely . . . a domestic dispute” because he labeled it a “spousal\r\nassault and an assault with a deadly weapon.” Ante, at 13 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). Solely domestic disputes often involve gun\r\nviolence, however. See Sorenson & Weibe, Weapons in the Lives of\r\n4                MESSERSCHMIDT v.

Detective Messerschmidt’s\r\ndeposition is illustrative.\r\n     “Q: So as far as you knew, it was just sort of a spousal-\r\n     abuse-type case where the perpetrator happened to be\r\n     in a gang, right?\r\n     “A: Correct.\r\n     “Q: So you didn’t have any reason to believe that the\r\n     assault on Kelly was any sort of gang crime, did you?\r\n     “A: No.” Record in No. CV 05–2298 DDP (RZx) (CD\r\n     Cal.)

In any event, the Court’s reading of Detective\r\nMesserschmidt’s affidavit is incompatible with his testimony that the\r\ncrime was “just sort of a spousal-abuse-type case,” not a “gang crime.”\r\nSee supra this page.\r\n  3 By suggesting that courts assessing qualified immunity should ig-\r\n\r\nnore police officers’ testimony about the information they possessed at\r\nthe time of the search, ante, at 14–15, n. 6, the Court misreads Harlow\r\nv. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 815–819 (1982), and Anderson v.\r\nCreighton, 483 U. S. 635, 645 (1987). In Harlow, we adopted a qualified\r\nimmunity test focusing on an officer’s objective good faith, rather than\r\nwhether the officer searched “with the malicious intention to cause a\r\ndeprivation of constitutional rights or other injury.” 457 U. S., at 815.\r\nAs we have explained, “examination of the information possessed by the\r\nsearching officials . . . does not reintroduce into qualified immunity\r\nanalysis the inquiry into officials’ subjective intent that Harlow sought\r\nto minimize.” Anderson, 483 U. S., at 641. It is therefore highly\r\nrelevant that Detective Messerschmidt testified that he lacked “any\r\nreason” to consider the crime gang related, supra this page, and pos-\r\nsessed no “information” that there were handguns in the Millenders’\r\nhome, infra, at 11.

See App. 41, 44 (Crime Analysis Supplemental\r\nForm–M. O. Factors). And the District Court noted it was\r\nundisputed that Detective Messerschmidt “had no reason\r\nto believe Bowen’s crime was a ‘gang’ crime.” App. to Pet.\r\nfor Cert. 115.4\r\n   The police’s conclusions matched the victim’s own ac-\r\ncount of the attack. Kelly asked police officers to help her\r\nmove out because Bowen “ha[d] a domestic violence on his\r\nrecord,” had “hit [her] once or twice” already, had repeat-\r\nedly threatened her “You’ll never leave me. I’ll kill you\r\nif you leave me,” and she was “planning on breaking up”\r\nwith him. Record, Doc. 51 (Exh. C), pp. 5–6 (hereinafter\r\nKelly Interview). As Kelly described the confrontation, it\r\nwas only after she fled to her car in order to leave that\r\nBowen reemerged from their shared apartment with the\r\nshotgun and told her “I’m gonna kill your ass right here if\r\nyou take off,” consistent with his prior threats. Id., at 7–8.\r\nEvery piece of information, therefore, accorded with Detec-\r\ntive Messerschmidt’s conclusion: The crime was domestic\r\nviolence that was not gang related.5\r\n——————\r\n   4 The Court is wrong to imply that courts should not consider “facts\r\n\r\noutside the affidavit,” but within the officers’ possession, when as-\r\nsessing qualified immunity.

If an officer\r\npossesses information indicating that he lacks probable cause to search,\r\nand that information was not presented to the neutral magistrate when\r\nhe approved the search, it is particularly likely that “a reasonably well\r\ntrained officer would have known that the search was illegal despite\r\nthe magistrate’s authorization.” United States v.

The Court provides no justification\r\nfor sweeping aside the conclusions he reached on the basis\r\nof his far greater expertise, let alone the facts found by the\r\nDistrict Court. We have repeatedly and recently warned\r\nappellate courts, “far removed from the scene,” against\r\nsecond-guessing the judgments made by the police or\r\nreweighing the facts as they stood before the district court.\r\nRyburn v. Huff, 565 U. S. —, — (2012) (per curiam) (slip\r\nop., at 6–8). The majority’s decision today is totally incon-\r\nsistent with those principles.\r\n   Qualified immunity analysis does not direct courts to\r\nplay the role of crime scene investigators, second-guessing\r\npolice officers’ determinations as to whether a crime was\r\ncommitted with a handgun or a shotgun, or whether vio-\r\n——————\r\nto murder” Kelly “on the asserted ground that she had ‘call[ed] the cops’\r\non him”); see also ante, at 1, 13. Bowen, however, never made that\r\nstatement. Though it appears in the warrant application, the words\r\nare Messerschmidt’s—taken from his own inaccurate notes of Kelly’s\r\naccount of the crime. What Kelly actually said during her interview\r\nwas that as soon as the police deputies left, Bowen “came out of no-\r\nwhere talking about, ‘Did you call the police on me? You called the\r\npolice on me,’ ” to which Kelly responded “no one called the police on\r\nyou . . . . [I]nstead of arguing and fighting with you I just want to get\r\nmy shit done.” Kelly Interview 7; compare ibid. with Record, Doc. 51\r\n(Exh. B), p. 3 (Messerschmidt’s narrative of interview with Kelly). Only\r\nafter Kelly started to leave did Bowen exclaim “oh it’s like that. It’s\r\nlike that,” retrieve a gun, and threaten to shoot her if she left. Kelly\r\nInterview 7–8. That Bowen was “ ‘angry,’ ” ante, at 14, n. 5, because she\r\nhad called the sheriff's department for assistance reflected exactly what\r\nKelly and the police expected at the outset—that Bowen “would give\r\nher a hard time about moving out.” App. 38 (sheriff’s department\r\nincident report).\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

Indeed,\r\nwe have warned courts against asking “whether another\r\nreasonable, or more reasonable, interpretation of the\r\nevents can be constructed five years after the fact.”\r\nHunter v. Bryant, 502 U. S. 224, 228 (1991) (per curiam).\r\nThe inquiry our precedents demand is not whether differ-\r\nent conclusions might conceivably be drawn from the\r\ncrime scene. Rather, it is whether “a reasonably well-\r\ntrained officer in petitioner’s position would have known\r\nthat his affidavit failed to establish probable cause.”\r\nMalley, 475 U. S., at 345. The operative question in this\r\ncase, therefore, is whether—given that, as petitioners\r\ncomprehended, the crime itself was not gang related—a\r\nreasonable officer nonetheless could have believed he had\r\nprobable cause to seek a warrant to search the suspect’s\r\nresidence for all evidence of affiliation not only with the\r\nsuspect’s street gang, but “any Street Gang.” He could\r\nnot.\r\n  The Court offers two secondary explanations for why a\r\nsearch for gang-related items might have been justified,\r\nbut they are equally unpersuasive. First, the majority\r\nsuggests that such evidence hypothetically “might prove\r\nhelpful in impeaching Bowen or rebutting various de-\r\nfenses he could raise at trial.” Ante, at 15. That is a non-\r\nstarter. The Fourth Amendment does not permit the police\r\nto search for evidence solely because it could be admissible\r\nfor impeachment or rebuttal purposes. If it did, the police\r\nwould be equally entitled to obtain warrants to rifle\r\nthrough the papers of anyone reasonably suspected of a\r\ncrime for all evidence of his bad character, Fed. Rule Evid.\r\n404(a)(2)(B)(i), or any evidence of any “crime, wrong, or\r\nother act” that might prove the defendant’s “motive, op-\r\nportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity,\r\nabsence of mistake, or lack of accident,” Fed. Rule Evid.\r\n404(b)(2). Indeed, the majority’s rationale presumably\r\nwould authorize the police to search the residence of every\r\n8               MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nmember of Bowen’s street gang for similar weapons—\r\nwhich likewise “might [have] prove[d] helpful in impeach-\r\ning Bowen or rebutting various defenses he could raise at\r\ntrial.” Ante, at 15. It has long been the case, however,\r\nthat such general searches, detached from probable cause,\r\nare impermissible. See, e.g., Go-Bart Importing Co., 282\r\nU. S., at 357. By their own admission, however, the offic-\r\ners were not searching for gang-related indicia to bolster\r\nsome hypothetical impeachment theory, but for other\r\nreasons: because “photos sought re gang membership\r\ncould be linked with other gang members, evidencing\r\ncriminal activity as gang affiliation is an enhancement to\r\ncriminal charges.” App. 181; see also id., at 145. That\r\nkind of fishing expedition for evidence of unidentified\r\ncriminal activity committed by unspecified persons was\r\nthe very evil the Fourth Amendment was intended to\r\nprevent.\r\n   Finally, the Court concludes that “even if this were\r\nmerely a domestic dispute, a reasonable officer could still\r\nconclude that gang paraphernalia found at the Millenders’\r\nresidence would aid in the prosecution of Bowen by, for\r\nexample, demonstrating Bowen’s connection to other\r\n[unspecified] evidence found there.” Ante, at 15. That is\r\ndifficult to understand. The police were well aware before\r\nobtaining a warrant that “other persons associated with\r\nthe home, the Millender family members, were active\r\nMona Park Crip gang members.” App. 28. Simply finding\r\ngang-related paraphernalia, therefore, would have done\r\nlittle to establish probable cause that particular evidence\r\nfound in the home was connected to Bowen, rather than\r\nany of the several other active gang members who resided\r\nfull time at the Millender home.6 Moreover, it would have\r\n——————\r\n  6 The Court suggests that even if gang-related evidence would be\r\n\r\ninconclusive generally, evidence bearing Bowen’s particular gang mon-\r\niker could have demonstrated Bowen’s connection to the residence.\r\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

Notably absent from the Court’s\r\ndiscussion is any acknowledgment of the actual basis for\r\npetitioners’ search. The police officers searched for all\r\nfirearms not for the reasons hypothesized by the majority,\r\nbut because they determined that “[v]alid warrants com-\r\nmonly allow police to search for ‘firearms and ammuni-\r\ntion,’ ” and that “[h]ere, any caliber of shotgun or receipts\r\nwould show possession of and/or purchase of guns.” Id., at\r\n144, 180–181; see also Brief for Appellant in No. 07–55518\r\n(CA9), p. 41 (hereinafter CA9 Brief). It is small wonder\r\nthat the District Court found these arguments “nonsensi-\r\ncal and unpersuasive.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 157. It bears\r\nrepeating that the Founders adopted the Fourth Amend-\r\nment to protect against searches for evidence of unspeci-\r\nfied crimes. And merely possessing other firearms is not a\r\ncrime at all. See generally District of Columbia v. Heller,\r\n554 U. S. 570 (2008).8\r\n——————\r\nBut the warrant did not authorize a search for items bearing Bowen’s\r\nmoniker, but rather for items related to “any Street Gang,” including\r\ncountless street gangs of which Bowen was not a member. App. 52.\r\nEven under the Court’s interpretation, therefore, the warrant was\r\nhopelessly overbroad and invalid.\r\n  7 The police also could not search for gang-related evidence for its own\r\n\r\nsake. Mere membership in a gang is not a crime under California law.\r\nSee People v.

The police cannot rationalize a search post\r\nhoc on the basis of information they failed to set forth in their warrant\r\napplication to a neutral magistrate. Rather, “[i]t is elementary that in\r\npassing on the validity of a warrant, the reviewing court may consider\r\nonly information brought to the magistrate’s attention.” Aguilar v.\r\n10               MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n   By justifying the officers’ actions on reasons of its own\r\ninvention, the Court ignores the reasons the officers actu-\r\nally gave, as well as the facts upon which this case was\r\ndecided below. The majority’s analysis—akin to a rational-\r\nbasis test—is thus far removed from what qualified\r\nimmunity analysis demands. Even if the police had\r\nsearched for the reasons the Court proposes, however, I\r\nstill would find it inappropriate to afford them qualified\r\nimmunity.\r\n   The Court correctly recognizes that to satisfy the Fourth\r\nAmendment the police were required to demonstrate\r\nprobable cause that (1) other firearms could be found at\r\nthe Millenders’ residence; and (2) such weapons were\r\nillegal or were “ ‘possess[ed] . . . with the intent to use\r\nthem as a means of committing a public offense.’ ” Ante, at\r\n12 (quoting Cal. Penal Code Ann. §1524(a)(3) (West\r\n2011)). The warrant failed to establish either.\r\n   The majority has little difficulty concluding that because\r\nBowen fired one firearm, it was reasonable for the police\r\nto conclude not only that Bowen must have possessed\r\nothers, but that he must be storing these other weapons\r\nat his 73-year-old former foster mother’s home.9 Again,\r\nhowever, this is not what the police actually concluded, as\r\nDetective Messerschmidt’s deposition makes clear.\r\n     “Q: Did you have any reason to believe there would be\r\n\r\n——————\r\nTexas, 378 U.

Likewise, a police officer cannot obtain\r\nqualified immunity for searching pursuant to a warrant by relying\r\nupon facts outside that warrant, as evinced by Malley’s focus on\r\n“whether a reasonably well-trained officer in petitioner’s position would\r\nhave known that his affidavit failed to establish probable cause.”\r\nMalley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 345 (1986) (emphasis added).\r\n  9 The majority ignores that Bowen retrieved the shotgun that he fired\r\n\r\nfrom the apartment he shared with Kelly, not the Millenders’ home.\r\nKelly provided no indication that Bowen possessed other guns or that\r\nhe stored them at his former foster mother’s home.\r\n                    Cite as: 565 U.

[a]ll\r\ncaliber of ammunition, miscellaneous gun parts, gun\r\ncleaning kits, holsters which could hold or have held any\r\ncaliber handgun being sought,” and “[a]ny receipts or\r\npaperwork, showing the purchase, ownership, or posses-\r\nsion of the handguns being sought.” App. 52. That is\r\npuzzling. If any aspect of the Fourth Amendment is clear-\r\nly established, it is that the police cannot reasonably\r\nsearch—even pursuant to a warrant—for items that they\r\ndo not have “any reason to believe” will be present. The\r\nCourt’s conclusion to the contrary simply reads the “prob-\r\nable cause” requirement out of the Fourth Amendment.\r\n   Even assuming that the police reasonably could have\r\nconcluded that Bowen possessed other guns and was\r\nstoring them at the Millenders’ home, I cannot agree that\r\nthe warrant provided probable cause to believe any weap-\r\non possessed in a home in which 10 persons regularly\r\nlived—none of them the suspect in this case—was either\r\n“contraband or evidence of a crime.” Ornelas v. United\r\nStates, 517 U. S. 690, 696 (1996). The warrant set forth no\r\nspecific facts or particularized explanation establishing\r\nprobable cause to believe that other guns found in the\r\nhome were connected to the crime specified in the warrant\r\nor were otherwise illegal.10 While the Court hypothesizes\r\n——————\r\n  10 Augusta Millender was a 73-year-old grandmother living in a dan-\r\n\r\ngerous part of Los Angeles.

And the police officers confirmed that their\r\nsearch was targeted to find the gun related to “the crime\r\nat issue.” CA9 Brief 42; see also App. 52 (obtaining au-\r\nthorization to search for “the item being sought and or\r\nbelieved to be evidence in the case being investigated on\r\nthis warrant” (emphasis added)).\r\n   The police told the Ninth Circuit that they searched for\r\nall firearms not because, as the majority hypothesizes,\r\n“there would be additional illegal guns among others that\r\nBowen owned,” ante, at 11–12, but on the dubious theory\r\nthat “Kelly could have been mistaken in her description of\r\nthe gun.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 20–21. The Ninth Circuit\r\nproperly dismissed that argument as carrying “little\r\nforce.” Id., at 21. Its finding is unimpeachable, given that\r\nKelly presented the police with a photograph of Bowen\r\nholding the specific gun used in the crime, and the police,\r\nthe victim, and a witness to the crime all identified the\r\ngun as a sawed-off shotgun. See id., at 20, 21, 24, 28.\r\n   Finally, the majority suggests that the officers could\r\nhave reasonably believed that seizure of all firearms at the\r\nMillenders’ residence was justified because those weapons\r\nmight be possessed by Bowen “ ‘with the intent to use\r\nthem as a means of committing a public offense.’ ” Ante, at\r\n12. But the warrant specified that the police sought only\r\nthe shotgun used in this crime for that purpose. See App.\r\n59 (statement of probable cause) (“Your Affiant also be-\r\nlieves that the items sought will be in the possession of\r\nJerry Ray Bowen and the recovery of the weapon could be\r\ninvaluable in the successful prosecution of the suspect\r\ninvolved in this case, and the curtailment of further\r\n——————\r\nout to be the case.\r\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

Fitz-\r\ngerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982).\r\n  The majority asserts, without citation, that the magis-\r\ntrate’s approval is relevant to objective reasonableness.\r\nThat view, however, is expressly contradicted by our hold-\r\ning in Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335. There, we found\r\nthat a police officer is not “entitled to rely on the judgment\r\nof a judicial officer in finding that probable cause exists\r\nand hence issuing the warrant,” and explained that “[that]\r\nview of objective reasonableness is at odds with our devel-\r\nopment of that concept in Harlow and [United States v.\r\nLeon, 468 U.

It is hardly surprising, for instance,\r\nthat Detective Messerschmidt did not include in his affidavit further\r\nfacts affirming that the crime was not gang related, given that he did\r\nnot believe the crime was gang related and did not search for gang-\r\nrelated material for that reason. See supra, at 7–8. The affidavit and\r\nwarrant were perfectly consistent with the officers’ stated reasons for\r\ntheir search—just not with the Court’s own theories.\r\n14               MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nofficer reasonably relied on a magistrate’s probable cause\r\ndetermination, but rather “whether a reasonably well-\r\ntrained officer in petitioner’s position would have known\r\nthat his affidavit failed to establish probable cause and\r\nthat he should not have applied for the warrant.” Ibid.\r\n(emphasis added).13 In such a case, “the officer’s applica-\r\ntion for a warrant [would] not [be] objectively reasonable,\r\nbecause it create[s] the unnecessary danger of an unlawful\r\narrest.” Ibid. When “no officer of reasonable competence\r\nwould have requested the warrant,” a “magistrate [who]\r\nissues the warrant [makes] not just a reasonable mistake,\r\nbut an unacceptable error indicating gross incompetence\r\nor neglect of duty.” Id., at 346, n. 9. In such cases, “[t]he\r\nofficer . . . cannot excuse his own default by pointing to the\r\ngreater incompetence of the magistrate.” Ibid.\r\n   In cases in which it would be not only wrong but un-\r\nreasonable for any well-trained officer to seek a warrant,\r\nallowing a magistrate’s approval to immunize the police\r\nofficer’s unreasonable action retrospectively makes little\r\nsense. By motivating an officer “to reflect, before submit-\r\nting a request for a warrant, upon whether he has a rea-\r\nsonable basis for believing that his affidavit establishes\r\nprobable cause,” we recognized that our qualified immu-\r\nnity precedents had the “desirable” effect of “reduc[ing] the\r\nlikelihood that the officer’s request for a warrant will be\r\npremature,” leading to “a waste of judicial resources” or\r\n“premature arrests.” Id., at 343. To the extent it proposes\r\nto cut back upon Malley, the majority will promote the\r\nopposite result—encouraging sloppy police work and ex-\r\nacerbating the risk that searches will not comport with\r\nthe requirements of the Fourth Amendment.\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  13 Two  Justices wrote separately, disagreeing with the majority be-\r\ncause they believed that “substantial weight should be accorded the\r\njudge’s finding of probable cause.” Malley, 475 U.

Giving weight to that fact would turn the Fourth\r\nAmendment on its head. This Court made clear in Malley\r\nthat a police officer acting unreasonably cannot obtain\r\nqualified immunity on the basis of a neutral magistrate’s\r\napproval. It would be passing strange, therefore, to im-\r\nmunize an officer’s conduct instead based upon the ap-\r\nproval of other police officers and prosecutors.14 See John-\r\nson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10, 14 (1948) (opinion of\r\nJackson, J.) (“When the right of privacy must reasonably\r\nyield to the right of search is, as a rule, to be decided by a\r\njudicial officer, not by a policeman or government en-\r\nforcement agent”). The effect of the Court’s rule, however,\r\nis to hold blameless the “plainly incompetent” action of the\r\npolice officer seeking a warrant because of the “plainly\r\nincompetent” approval of his superiors and the district\r\nattorney. See ante, at 16–18; see also ante, at 3–4 (opinion\r\nof KAGAN, J.). Under the majority’s test, four wrongs\r\napparently make a right. I cannot agree, however, that\r\nthe “objective legal reasonableness of an official’s acts,”\r\nHarlow, 457 U.

The Court\r\nreaches a contrary result not because it thinks that these\r\npolice officers’ stated reasons for searching were objective-\r\nly reasonable, but because it thinks different conclusions\r\nmight be drawn from the crime scene that reasonably\r\nmight have led different officers to search for different\r\nreasons. That analysis, however, is far removed from\r\nqualified immunity’s proper focus on whether petitioners\r\nacted in an objectively reasonable manner.\r\n   Because petitioners did not, I would affirm the judgment\r\nof the Court of Appeals.\r\n</pre>", "id": 623242, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2012/02/22/Messerschmidt_v._Millender.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2011                                       1\r\n\r\n                                       Syllabus\r\n\r\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\r\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\r\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\r\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\r\n       See United States v.

MILLENDER, EXECUTOR OF\r\n   ESTATE OF MILLENDER, DECEASED, ET AL.\r\n\r\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\r\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\r\n\r\n  No. 10–704.     Argued December 5, 2011—Decided February 22, 2012\r\nShelly Kelly was afraid that she would be attacked by her boyfriend,\r\n  Jerry Ray Bowen, while she moved out of her apartment. She there-\r\n  fore requested police protection. Two officers arrived, but they were\r\n  called away to an emergency. As soon as the officers left, Bowen\r\n  showed up at the apartment, yelled “I told you never to call the cops\r\n  on me bitch!” and attacked Kelly, attempting to throw her over a se-\r\n  cond-story landing. After Kelly escaped to her car, Bowen pointed a\r\n  sawed-off shotgun at her and threatened to kill her if she tried to\r\n  leave. Kelly nonetheless sped away as Bowen fired five shots at the\r\n  car, blowing out one of its tires.\r\n     Kelly later met with Detective Curt Messerschmidt to discuss the\r\n  incident. She described the attack in detail, mentioned that Bowen\r\n  had previously assaulted her, that he had ties to the Mona Park\r\n  Crips gang, and that he might be staying at the home of his former\r\n  foster mother, Augusta Millender. Following this conversation, Mes-\r\n  serschmidt conducted a detailed investigation, during which he con-\r\n  firmed Bowen’s connection to the Millenders’ home, verified his\r\n  membership in two gangs, and learned that Bowen had been arrested\r\n  and convicted for numerous violent and firearm-related offenses.\r\n  Based on this investigation, Messerschmidt drafted an application\r\n  for a warrant authorizing a search of the Millenders’ home for all\r\n  firearms and ammunition, as well as evidence indicating gang\r\n  membership.\r\n     Messerschmidt included two affidavits in the warrant application.\r\n  The first detailed his extensive law enforcement experience and his\r\n  specialized training in gang-related crimes. The second, expressly in-\r\n  corporated into the search warrant, described the incident and ex-\r\n2                  MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                                 Syllabus\r\n\r\n    plained why Messerschmidt believed there was probable cause for the\r\n    search. It also requested that the warrant be endorsed for night ser-\r\n    vice because of Bowen’s gang ties. Before submitting the application\r\n    to a magistrate for approval, Messerschmidt had it reviewed by his\r\n    supervisor, Sergeant Robert Lawrence, as well as a police lieutenant\r\n    and a deputy district attorney. Messerschmidt then submitted the\r\n    application to a magistrate, who issued the warrant. The ensuing\r\n    search uncovered only Millender’s shotgun, a California Social Ser-\r\n    vices letter addressed to Bowen, and a box of .45-caliber ammunition.\r\n       The Millenders filed an action under 42 U. S. C. §1983 against pe-\r\n    titioners Messerschmidt and Lawrence, alleging that the officers had\r\n    subjected them to an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth\r\n    Amendment. The District Court granted summary judgment to the\r\n    Millenders, concluding that the firearm and gang-material aspects of\r\n    the search warrant were overbroad and that the officers were not en-\r\n    titled to qualified immunity from damages. The Ninth Circuit, sit-\r\n    ting en banc, affirmed the denial of qualified immunity. The court\r\n    held that the warrant’s authorization was unconstitutionally over-\r\n    broad because the affidavits and warrant failed to establish probable\r\n    cause that the broad categories of firearms, firearm-related material,\r\n    and gang-related material were contraband or evidence of a crime,\r\n    and that a reasonable officer would have been aware of the warrant’s\r\n    deficiency.\r\nHeld: The officers are entitled to qualified immunity. Pp. 8−19.\r\n    (a) Qualified immunity “protects government officials ‘from liability\r\n for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly es-\r\n tablished statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable\r\n person would have known.’ ” Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 231.\r\n Where the alleged Fourth Amendment violation involves a search or\r\n seizure pursuant to a warrant, the fact that a neutral magistrate has\r\n issued a warrant is the clearest indication that the officers acted in\r\n an objectively reasonable manner, or in “objective good faith.” United\r\n States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 922–923. Nonetheless, that fact does\r\n not end the inquiry into objective reasonableness. The Court has rec-\r\n ognized an exception allowing suit when “it is obvious that no rea-\r\n sonably competent officer would have concluded that a warrant\r\n should issue.” Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 341. The “shield of\r\n immunity” otherwise conferred by the warrant, id., at 345, will be\r\n lost, for example, where the warrant was “based on an affidavit so\r\n lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its\r\n existence entirely unreasonable.” Leon, 468 U. S., at 923. The\r\n threshold for establishing this exception is high. “[I]n the ordinary\r\n case, an officer cannot be expected to question the magistrate’s prob-\r\n able-cause determination” because “[i]t is the magistrate’s responsi-\r\n                   Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                    3\r\n\r\n                              Syllabus\r\n\r\nbility to determine whether the officer’s allegations establish proba-\r\nble cause and, if so, to issue a warrant comporting in form with the\r\nrequirements of the Fourth Amendment.” Leon, supra, at 921. Pp.\r\n8−10.\r\n   (b) This case does not fall within that narrow exception. It would\r\nnot be entirely unreasonable for an officer to believe that there was\r\nprobable cause to search for all firearms and firearm-related materi-\r\nals. Under the circumstances set forth in the warrant, an officer\r\ncould reasonably conclude that there was a “fair probability” that the\r\nsawed-off shotgun was not the only firearm Bowen owned, Illinois v.\r\nGates, 462 U. S. 213, 238, and that Bowen’s sawed-off shotgun was il-\r\nlegal. Cf. 26 U. S. C. §§ 5845(a), 5861(d). Given Bowen’s possession\r\nof one illegal gun, his gang membership, willingness to use the gun to\r\nkill someone, and concern about the police, it would not be unreason-\r\nable for an officer to conclude that Bowen owned other illegal guns.\r\nAn officer also could reasonably believe that seizure of firearms was\r\nnecessary to prevent further assaults on Kelly. California law allows\r\na magistrate to issue a search warrant for items “in the possession of\r\nany person with the intent to use them as a means of committing a\r\npublic offense,” Cal. Penal Code Ann. §1524(a)(3), and the warrant\r\napplication submitted by the officers specifically referenced this pro-\r\nvision as a basis for the search. Pp. 10–12.\r\n   (c) Regarding the warrant’s authorization to search for gang-\r\nrelated materials, a reasonable officer could view Bowen’s attack as\r\nmotivated not by the souring of his romantic relationship with Kelly\r\nbut by a desire to prevent her from disclosing details of his gang ac-\r\ntivity to the police. It would therefore not be unreasonable—based on\r\nthe facts set out in the affidavit—for an officer to believe that evi-\r\ndence of Bowen’s gang affiliation would prove helpful in prosecuting\r\nhim for the attack on Kelly, in supporting additional, related charges\r\nagainst Bowen for the assault, or in impeaching Bowen or rebutting\r\nhis defenses. Moreover, even if this were merely a domestic dispute,\r\na reasonable officer could still conclude that gang paraphernalia\r\nfound at the Millenders’ residence could demonstrate Bowen’s control\r\nover the premises or his connection to other evidence found there.\r\nPp. 12−16.\r\n   (d) The fact that the officers sought and obtained approval of the\r\nwarrant application from a superior and a deputy district attorney\r\nbefore submitting it to the magistrate provides further support for\r\nthe conclusion that an officer could reasonably have believed that the\r\nscope of the warrant was supported by probable cause. A contrary\r\nconclusion would mean not only that Messerschmidt and Lawrence\r\nwere “plainly incompetent” in concluding that the warrant was sup-\r\nported by probable cause, Malley, supra, at 341, but that their super-\r\n4                  MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                                  Syllabus\r\n\r\n    visor, the deputy district attorney, and the magistrate were as well.\r\n    Pp. 16−18.\r\n       (e) In holding that the warrant in this case was so obviously defec-\r\n    tive that no reasonable officer could have believed it to be valid, the\r\n    court below erred in relying on Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U. S. 551.\r\n    There, officers who carried out a warrant-approved search were not\r\n    entitled to qualified immunity because the warrant failed to describe\r\n    any of the items to be seized and “even a cursory reading of the war-\r\n    rant” would have revealed this defect. Id., at 557. Here, in contrast,\r\n    any arguable defect would have become apparent only upon a close\r\n    parsing of the warrant application, and a comparison of the support-\r\n    ing affidavit to the terms of the warrant to determine whether the af-\r\n    fidavit established probable cause to search for all the items listed in\r\n    the warrant. Unlike in Groh, any error here would not be one that\r\n    “just a simple glance” would have revealed. Id. at 564. Pp. 18−19.\r\n620 F. 3d 1016, reversed.\r\n\r\n  ROBERTS, C.

The warrant authorized a search for all guns\r\nand gang-related material, in connection with the investi-\r\ngation of a known gang member for shooting at his ex-\r\ngirlfriend with a pistol-gripped sawed-off shotgun, because\r\nshe had “call[ed] the cops” on him. App. 56. Respondents\r\nbrought an action seeking to hold the officers personally\r\nliable under 42 U. S. C. §1983, alleging that the search\r\nviolated their Fourth Amendment rights because there\r\nwas not sufficient probable cause to believe the items\r\nsought were evidence of a crime. In particular, respond-\r\nents argued that there was no basis to search for all\r\nguns simply because the suspect owned and had used a\r\nsawed-off shotgun, and no reason to search for gang mate-\r\nrial because the shooting at the ex-girlfriend for “call[ing]\r\nthe cops” was solely a domestic dispute. The Court of\r\n2             MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the warrant was\r\ninvalid, and that the officers were not entitled to immu-\r\nnity from personal liability because this invalidity was so\r\nobvious that any reasonable officer would have recognized\r\nit, despite the magistrate’s approval. We disagree and\r\nreverse.\r\n                               I\r\n\r\n                               A\r\n\r\n  Shelly Kelly decided to break off her romantic relation-\r\nship with Jerry Ray Bowen and move out of her apart-\r\nment, to which Bowen had a key. Kelly feared an attack\r\nfrom Bowen, who had previously assaulted her and had\r\nbeen convicted of multiple violent felonies. She therefore\r\nasked officers from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s De-\r\npartment to accompany her while she gathered her things.\r\nDeputies from the Sheriff ’s Department came to assist\r\nKelly but were called away to respond to an emergency\r\nbefore the move was complete.\r\n  As soon as the officers left, an enraged Bowen appeared\r\nat the bottom of the stairs to the apartment, yelling “I told\r\nyou never to call the cops on me bitch!” App. 39, 56.\r\nBowen then ran up the stairs to Kelly, grabbed her by her\r\nshirt, and tried to throw her over the railing of the second-\r\nstory landing. When Kelly successfully resisted, Bowen\r\nbit her on the shoulder and attempted to drag her inside\r\nthe apartment by her hair. Kelly again managed to escape\r\nBowen’s grasp, and ran to her car. By that time, Bowen\r\nhad retrieved a black sawed-off shotgun with a pistol grip.\r\nHe ran in front of Kelly’s car, pointed the shotgun at her,\r\nand told Kelly that if she tried to leave he would kill her.\r\nKelly leaned over, fully depressed the gas pedal, and sped\r\naway. Bowen fired at the car a total of five times, blowing\r\nout the car’s left front tire in the process, but Kelly man-\r\naged to escape.\r\n  Kelly quickly located police officers and reported the\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          3\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nassault. She told the police what had happened—that\r\nBowen had attacked her after becoming “angry because\r\nshe had called the Sheriff’s Department”—and she men-\r\ntioned that Bowen was “an active member of the ‘Mona\r\nPark Crips,’ ” a local street gang. Id., at 39. Kelly also\r\nprovided the officers with photographs of Bowen.\r\n   Detective Curt Messerschmidt was assigned to investi-\r\ngate the incident. Messerschmidt met with Kelly to obtain\r\ndetails of the assault and information about Bowen. Kelly\r\ndescribed the attack and informed Messerschmidt that she\r\nthought Bowen was staying at his foster mother’s home\r\nat 2234 East 120th Street. Kelly also informed Messer-\r\nschmidt of Bowen’s previous assaults on her and of his\r\ngang ties.\r\n   Messerschmidt then conducted a background check on\r\nBowen by consulting police records, California Depart-\r\nment of Motor Vehicles records, and the “cal-gang” data-\r\nbase. Based on this research, Messerschmidt confirmed\r\nBowen’s connection to the 2234 East 120th Street address.\r\nHe also confirmed that Bowen was an “active” member of\r\nthe Mona Park Crips and a “secondary” member of the\r\nDodge City Crips. Id., at 64. Finally, Messerschmidt\r\nlearned that Bowen had been arrested and convicted for\r\nnumerous violent and firearm-related offenses. Indeed, at\r\nthe time of the investigation, Bowen’s “rapsheet” spanned\r\nover 17 printed pages, and indicated that he had been\r\narrested at least 31 times. Nine of these arrests were for\r\nfirearms offenses and six were for violent crimes, includ-\r\ning three arrests for assault with a deadly weapon (fire-\r\narm). Id., at 72–81.\r\n   Messerschmidt prepared two warrants: one to authorize\r\nBowen’s arrest and one to authorize the search of 2234\r\nEast 120th Street. An attachment to the search warrant\r\ndescribed the property that would be the object of the\r\nsearch:\r\n4             MESSERSCHMIDT v.

The first affidavit described Messerschmidt’s\r\nextensive law enforcement experience, including that he\r\nhad served as a peace officer for 14 years, that he was\r\nthen assigned to a “specialized unit” “investigating gang\r\nrelated crimes and arresting gang members for various\r\nviolations of the law,” that he had been involved in “hun-\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

That affidavit described the facts of the incident\r\ninvolving Kelly and Bowen in great detail, including the\r\nweapon used in the assault. The affidavit recounted that\r\nKelly had identified Bowen as the assailant and that she\r\nthought Bowen might be found at 2234 East 120th Street.\r\nIt also reported that Messerschmidt had “conducted an\r\nextensive background search on the suspect by utilizing\r\ndepartmental records, state computer records, and other\r\npolice agency records,” and that from that information he\r\nhad concluded that Bowen resided at 2234 East 120th\r\nStreet. Id., at 58.\r\n   The affidavit requested that the search warrant be\r\nendorsed for night service because “information provided\r\nby the victim and the cal-gang data base” indicated that\r\nBowen had “gang ties to the Mona Park Crip gang” and\r\nthat “night service would provide an added element of\r\nsafety to the community as well as for the deputy person-\r\nnel serving the warrant.” Id., at 59. The affidavit con-\r\ncluded by noting that Messerschmidt “believe[d] that the\r\nitems sought” would be in Bowen’s possession and that\r\n“recovery of the weapon could be invaluable in the success-\r\nful prosecution of the suspect involved in this case, and\r\nthe curtailment of further crimes being committed.” Ibid.\r\n   Messerschmidt submitted the warrants to his super-\r\nvisors—Sergeant Lawrence and Lieutenant Ornales—for\r\nreview. Deputy District Attorney Janet Wilson also re-\r\nviewed the materials and initialed the search warrant,\r\nindicating that she agreed with Messerschmidt’s assess-\r\nment of probable cause. Id., at 27, 47. Finally, Messer-\r\n6             MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                    Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nschmidt submitted the warrants to a magistrate. The\r\nmagistrate approved the warrants and authorized night\r\nservice.\r\n  The search warrant was served two days later by a team\r\nof officers that included Messerschmidt and Lawrence.\r\nSheriff’s deputies forced open the front door of 2234 East\r\n120th Street and encountered Augusta Millender—a\r\nwoman in her seventies—and Millender’s daughter and\r\ngrandson. As instructed by the police, the Millenders\r\nwent outside while the residence was secured but re-\r\nmained in the living room while the search was conducted.\r\nBowen was not found in the residence. The search did,\r\nhowever, result in the seizure of Augusta Millender’s\r\nshotgun, a California Social Services letter addressed to\r\nBowen, and a box of .45-caliber ammunition.\r\n  Bowen was arrested two weeks later after Messer-\r\nschmidt found him hiding under a bed in a motel room.\r\n                             B\r\n   The Millenders filed suit in Federal District Court\r\nagainst the County of Los Angeles, the sheriff ’s depart-\r\nment, the sheriff, and a number of individual officers,\r\nincluding Messerschmidt and Lawrence. The complaint\r\nalleged, as relevant here, that the search warrant was\r\ninvalid under the Fourth Amendment. It sought damages\r\nfrom Messerschmidt and Lawrence, among others.\r\n   The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment\r\non the validity of the search warrant. The District Court\r\nfound the warrant defective in two respects. The District\r\nCourt concluded that the warrant’s authorization to\r\nsearch for firearms was unconstitutionally overbroad\r\nbecause the “crime specified here was a physical assault\r\nwith a very specific weapon”—a black sawed-off shotgun\r\nwith a pistol grip—negating any need to “search for all\r\nfirearms.” Millender v.

The court also found\r\nthe warrant overbroad with respect to the search for gang-\r\nrelated materials, because there “was no evidence that the\r\ncrime at issue was gang-related.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\r\n157. As a result, the District Court granted summary\r\njudgment to the Millenders on their constitutional chal-\r\nlenges to the firearm and gang material aspects of the\r\nsearch warrant. Id., at 160. The District Court also re-\r\njected the officers’ claim that they were entitled to quali-\r\nfied immunity from damages. Id., at 171.\r\n   Messerschmidt and Lawrence appealed, and a divided\r\npanel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit re-\r\nversed the District Court’s denial of qualified immunity.\r\n564 F. 3d 1143 (2009). The court held that the officers\r\nwere entitled to qualified immunity because “they reason-\r\nably relied on the approval of the warrant by a deputy\r\ndistrict attorney and a judge.” Id., at 1145.\r\n   The Court of Appeals granted rehearing en banc and\r\naffirmed the District Court’s denial of qualified immunity.\r\n620 F. 3d 1016 (CA9 2010). The en banc court concluded\r\nthat the warrant’s authorization was unconstitutionally\r\noverbroad because the affidavit and the warrant failed to\r\n“establish[ ] probable cause that the broad categories of\r\nfirearms, firearm-related material, and gang-related\r\nmaterial described in the warrant were contraband or\r\nevidence of a crime.” Id., at 1033. In the en banc court’s\r\nview, “the deputies had probable cause to search for a\r\nsingle, identified weapon . . . . They had no probable cause\r\nto search for the broad class of firearms and firearm-\r\nrelated materials described in the warrant.” Id., at 1027.\r\nIn addition, “[b]ecause the deputies failed to establish any\r\nlink between gang-related materials and a crime, the\r\nwarrant authorizing the search and seizure of all gang-\r\nrelated evidence [was] likewise invalid.” Id., at 1031.\r\nConcluding that “a reasonable officer in the deputies’\r\nposition would have been well aware of this deficiency,”\r\n8              MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nthe en banc court held that the officers were not entitled to\r\nqualified immunity. Id., at 1033–1035.\r\n  There were two separate dissenting opinions. Judge\r\nCallahan determined that “the officers had probable cause\r\nto search for and seize any firearms in the home in which\r\nBowen, a gang member and felon, was thought to reside.”\r\nId., at 1036. She also concluded that “the officers reason-\r\nably relied on their superiors, the district attorney, and\r\nthe magistrate to correct” any overbreadth in the warrant,\r\nand that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity\r\nbecause their actions were not objectively unreasonable.\r\nId., at 1044, 1049. Judge Silverman also dissented, con-\r\ncluding that the “deputies’ belief in the validity of . . . the\r\nwarrant was entirely reasonable” and that the “record\r\n[wa]s totally devoid of any evidence that the deputies\r\nacted other than in good faith.” Id., at 1050. Judge Tall-\r\nman joined both dissents.\r\n  We granted certiorari. 564 U. S. ___ (2011).\r\n                              II\r\n  The Millenders allege that they were subjected to an\r\nunreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amend-\r\nment because the warrant authorizing the search of their\r\nhome was not supported by probable cause. They seek\r\ndamages from Messerschmidt and Lawrence for their roles\r\nin obtaining and executing this warrant. The validity of\r\nthe warrant is not before us. The question instead is\r\nwhether Messerschmidt and Lawrence are entitled to im-\r\nmunity from damages, even assuming that the warrant\r\nshould not have been issued.\r\n  “The doctrine of qualified immunity protects govern-\r\nment officials ‘from liability for civil damages insofar as\r\ntheir conduct does not violate clearly established statutory\r\nor constitutional rights of which a reasonable person\r\nwould have known.’ ” Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223,\r\n231 (2009) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800,\r\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

Qualified immunity “gives government offi-\r\ncials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken\r\njudgments,” and “protects ‘all but the plainly incompetent\r\nor those who knowingly violate the law.’ ” Ashcroft v. al-\r\nKidd, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12) (quoting\r\nMalley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 341 (1986)). “[W]hether\r\nan official protected by qualified immunity may be held\r\npersonally liable for an allegedly unlawful official action\r\ngenerally turns on the ‘objective legal reasonableness’ of\r\nthe action, assessed in light of the legal rules that were\r\n‘clearly established’ at the time it was taken.” Anderson v.\r\nCreighton, 483 U. S. 635, 639 (1987) (citation omitted).\r\n   Where the alleged Fourth Amendment violation involves\r\na search or seizure pursuant to a warrant, the fact that a\r\nneutral magistrate has issued a warrant is the clearest\r\nindication that the officers acted in an objectively reason-\r\nable manner or, as we have sometimes put it, in “objective\r\ngood faith.” United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 922–923\r\n(1984).1 Nonetheless, under our precedents, the fact that\r\na neutral magistrate has issued a warrant authorizing the\r\nallegedly unconstitutional search or seizure does not end\r\nthe inquiry into objective reasonableness. Rather, we\r\nhave recognized an exception allowing suit when “it is\r\nobvious that no reasonably competent officer would have\r\nconcluded that a warrant should issue.” Malley, 475 U. S.,\r\nat 341. The “shield of immunity” otherwise conferred by\r\nthe warrant, id., at 345, will be lost, for example, where\r\nthe warrant was “based on an affidavit so lacking in indi-\r\ncia of probable cause as to render official belief in its exist-\r\n——————\r\n   1 Although Leon involved the proper application of the exclusionary\r\n\r\nrule to remedy a Fourth Amendment violation, we have held that “the\r\nsame standard of objective reasonableness that we applied in the con-\r\ntext of a suppression hearing in Leon defines the qualified immun-\r\nity accorded an officer” who obtained or relied on an allegedly invalid\r\nwarrant. Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 344 (1986) (citation omitted);\r\nGroh v. Ramirez, 540 U. S. 551, 565, n. 8 (2004).\r\n10               MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nence entirely unreasonable.” Leon, 468 U. S., at 923 (in-\r\nternal quotation marks omitted).2\r\n   Our precedents make clear, however, that the threshold\r\nfor establishing this exception is a high one, and it should\r\nbe. As we explained in Leon, “[i]n the ordinary case, an\r\nofficer cannot be expected to question the magistrate’s\r\nprobable-cause determination” because “[i]t is the magis-\r\ntrate’s responsibility to determine whether the officer’s\r\nallegations establish probable cause and, if so, to issue a\r\nwarrant comporting in form with the requirements of the\r\nFourth Amendment.” Id., at 921; see also Malley, supra,\r\nat 346, n. 9 (“It is a sound presumption that the magis-\r\ntrate is more qualified than the police officer to make a\r\nprobable cause determination, and it goes without saying\r\nthat where a magistrate acts mistakenly in issuing a\r\nwarrant but within the range of professional competence\r\nof a magistrate, the officer who requested the warrant\r\ncannot be held liable” (internal quotation marks and\r\ncitation omitted)).\r\n                              III\r\n  The Millenders contend, and the Court of Appeals held,\r\nthat their case falls into this narrow exception. According\r\nto the Millenders, the officers “failed to provide any facts\r\nor circumstances from which a magistrate could properly\r\nconclude that there was probable cause to seize the broad\r\nclasses of items being sought,” and “[n]o reasonable officer\r\n——————\r\n  2 The dissent relies almost entirely on facts outside the affidavit,\r\n\r\nincluding Messerschmidt’s deposition testimony, post, at 4, 11 (opinion\r\nof SOTOMAYOR, J.), crime analysis forms, post, at 5, Kelly’s interview,\r\npost, at 5–6, and n. 5, Messerschmidt’s notes regarding Kelly’s inter-\r\nview, post, at 5–6, n. 5, and even several briefs filed in the District\r\nCourt and the Court of Appeals, post, at 8–9, 12. In contrast, the\r\ndissent cites the probable cause affidavit itself only twice. See post, at\r\n12. There is no contention before us that the affidavit was misleading\r\nin omitting any of the facts on which the dissent relies. Cf. Leon, 468\r\nU. S., at 923.\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

We disagree.\r\n                              A\r\n   With respect to the warrant’s authorization to search for\r\nand seize all firearms, the Millenders argue that “a rea-\r\nsonably well-trained officer would have readily perceived\r\nthat there was no probable cause to search the house for\r\nall firearms and firearm-related items.” Id., at 32. Noting\r\nthat “the affidavit indicated exactly what item was evi-\r\ndence of a crime—the ‘black sawed off shotgun with a\r\npistol grip,’ ” they argue that “[n]o facts established that\r\nBowen possessed any other firearms, let alone that such\r\nfirearms (if they existed) were ‘contraband or evidence of a\r\ncrime.’ ” Ibid. (quoting App. 56).\r\n   Even if the scope of the warrant were overbroad in\r\nauthorizing a search for all guns when there was infor-\r\nmation only about a specific one, that specific one was a\r\nsawed-off shotgun with a pistol grip, owned by a known\r\ngang member, who had just fired the weapon five times in\r\npublic in an attempt to murder another person, on the\r\nasserted ground that she had “call[ed] the cops” on him.\r\nId., at 56. Under these circumstances—set forth in the\r\nwarrant—it would not have been unreasonable for an\r\nofficer to conclude that there was a “fair probability” that\r\nthe sawed-off shotgun was not the only firearm Bowen\r\nowned. Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 238 (1983). And\r\nit certainly would have been reasonable for an officer to\r\nassume that Bowen’s sawed-off shotgun was illegal. Cf. 26\r\nU. S. C. §§5845(a), 5861(d). Evidence of one crime is not\r\nalways evidence of several, but given Bowen’s possession\r\nof one illegal gun, his gang membership, his willingness\r\nto use the gun to kill someone, and his concern about\r\nthe police, a reasonable officer could conclude that there\r\nwould be additional illegal guns among others that Bowen\r\n12               MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nowned.3\r\n   A reasonable officer also could believe that seizure of the\r\nfirearms was necessary to prevent further assaults on\r\nKelly. California law allows a magistrate to issue a search\r\nwarrant for items “in the possession of any person with\r\nthe intent to use them as a means of committing a public\r\noffense,” Cal. Penal Code Ann. §1524(a)(3) (West 2011),\r\nand the warrant application submitted by the officers\r\nspecifically referenced this provision as a basis for the\r\nsearch. App. 48. Bowen had already attempted to murder\r\nKelly once with a firearm, and had yelled “I’ll kill you” as\r\nshe tried to escape from him. Id., at 56–57. A reasonable\r\nofficer could conclude that Bowen would make another\r\nattempt on Kelly’s life and that he possessed other fire-\r\narms “with the intent to use them” to that end. Cal. Penal\r\nCode Ann. §1524(a)(3).\r\n   Given the foregoing, it would not have been “entirely\r\nunreasonable” for an officer to believe, in the particular\r\ncircumstances of this case, that there was probable cause\r\nto search for all firearms and firearm-related materials.\r\nLeon, supra, at 923 (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n   With respect to the warrant’s authorization to search for\r\nevidence of gang membership, the Millenders contend that\r\n“no reasonable officer could have believed that the affida-\r\nvit presented to the magistrate contained a sufficient basis\r\nto conclude that the gang paraphernalia sought was con-\r\ntraband or evidence of a crime.” Brief for Respondents 28.\r\nThey argue that “the magistrate [could not] have reasona-\r\nbly concluded, based on the affidavit, that Bowen’s gang\r\nmembership had anything to do with the crime under\r\ninvestigation” because “[t]he affidavit described a ‘spousal\r\n——————\r\n   3 The dissent caricatures our analysis as being that “because Bowen\r\n\r\nfired one firearm, it was reasonable for the police to conclude . . . that\r\n[he] must have possessed others,” post, at 10 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR,\r\nJ.). This simply avoids coming to grips with the facts of the crime at\r\nissue.\r\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

(quoting App. 55).\r\n   This effort to characterize the case solely as a domes-\r\ntic dispute, however, is misleading.        Cf. post, at 5\r\n(SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting); post, at 2 (KAGAN, J., concur-\r\nring in part and dissenting in part). Messerschmidt began\r\nhis affidavit in support of the warrant by explaining that\r\nhe “has been investigating an assault with a deadly weap-\r\non incident” and elaborated that the crime was a “spousal\r\nassault and an assault with a deadly weapon.” App. 55\r\n(emphasis added). The affidavit also stated that Bowen\r\nwas “a known Mona Park Crip gang member” “based on\r\ninformation provided by the victim and the cal-gang data-\r\nbase,”4 and that he had attempted to murder Kelly after\r\nbecoming enraged that she had “call[ed] the cops on\r\n[him].” Id., at 56, 58–59. A reasonable officer could cer-\r\ntainly view Bowen’s attack as motivated not by the sour-\r\ning of his romantic relationship with Kelly but instead by\r\na desire to prevent her from disclosing details of his gang\r\nactivity to the police. She was, after all, no longer linked\r\nwith him as a girlfriend; he had assaulted her in the past;\r\nand she had indeed called the cops on him. And, as the\r\naffidavit supporting the warrant made clear, Kelly had in\r\nfact given the police information about Bowen’s gang ties.\r\nId., at 59.5\r\n——————\r\n  4 Although the cal-gang database states that information contained\r\n\r\ntherein cannot be used to establish probable cause, see App. 64, the\r\naffidavit makes clear that Kelly also provided this information to\r\nMesserschmidt, id., at 59, as she did to the deputies who initially\r\nresponded to the attack, id., at 39 (describing Kelly’s statement that\r\nBowen was “an active member of the ‘Mona Park Crips’ ”). We there-\r\nfore need not decide whether the cal-gang database’s disclaimer is\r\nrelevant to Fourth Amendment analysis.\r\n  5 Contrary to the dissent’s suggestion, see post, at 5–6, n. 5 (opinion\r\n\r\nof SOTOMAYOR, J.), the affidavit’s account of Bowen’s statements is\r\n14               MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   It would therefore not have been unreasonable—based\r\non the facts set out in the affidavit—for an officer to be-\r\nlieve that evidence regarding Bowen’s gang affiliation\r\nwould prove helpful in prosecuting him for the attack on\r\nKelly. See Warden, Md. Penitentiary v. Hayden, 387 U. S.\r\n294, 307 (1967) (holding that the Fourth Amendment\r\nallows a search for evidence when there is “probable cause\r\n. . . to believe that the evidence sought will aid in a partic-\r\nular apprehension or conviction”). Not only would such\r\nevidence help to establish motive, either apart from or in\r\naddition to any domestic dispute, it would also support the\r\nbringing of additional, related charges against Bowen for\r\nthe assault. See, e.g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. §136.1(b)(1)\r\n(West 1999) (It is a crime to “attempt[ ] to prevent or\r\ndissuade another person who has been the victim of a\r\ncrime or who is witness to a crime from . . . [m]aking any\r\nreport of that victimization to any . . . law enforcement\r\nofficer”).6\r\n——————\r\nconsistent with other accounts of the confrontation, in particular the\r\nreport prepared by the officers who spoke with Kelly immediately after\r\nthe attack. See App. 39 (stating that when Bowen “appeared at the\r\nbase of the stairs and began yelling at [Kelly,] [h]e was angry because\r\nshe had called the Sheriff ’s Department”). And at no point during this\r\nlitigation has the accuracy of the affidavit’s account of the attack been\r\ncalled into question.\r\n   6 The dissent relies heavily on Messerschmidt’s deposition, in which\r\n\r\nhe stated that Bowen’s crime was not a “gang crime.” See post, at 4–7.\r\nMesserschmidt’s belief about the nature of the crime, however, is not\r\ninformation he possessed but a conclusion he reached based on infor-\r\nmation known to him. See Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 641\r\n(1987). We have “eschew[ed] inquiries into the subjective beliefs of law\r\nenforcement officers who seize evidence pursuant to a subsequently\r\ninvalidated warrant.” United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 922, n. 23\r\n(1984); see also Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 815–819 (1982). In\r\nany event, as the dissent recognizes, the inquiry under our precedents\r\nis whether “a reasonably well-trained officer in petitioner’s position\r\nwould have known that his affidavit failed to establish probable cause.”\r\nMalley, 475 U. S., at 345 (emphasis added). Messerschmidt’s own\r\nevaluation does not answer the question whether it would have been\r\n                      Cite as: 565 U.

For example,\r\nevidence that Bowen had ties to a gang that uses guns\r\nsuch as the one he used to assault Kelly would certainly be\r\nrelevant to establish that he had familiarity with or access\r\nto this type of weapon.\r\n   Moreover, even if this were merely a domestic dispute, a\r\nreasonable officer could still conclude that gang parapher-\r\nnalia found at the Millenders’ residence would aid in\r\nthe prosecution of Bowen by, for example, demonstrating\r\nBowen’s connection to other evidence found there. The\r\nwarrant authorized a search for “any gang indicia that\r\nwould establish the persons being sought in this warrant,”\r\nand “[a]rticles of personal property tending to establish\r\nthe identity of [the] person in control of the premise or\r\npremises.” App. 52. Before the District Court, the Millen-\r\nders “acknowledge[d] that evidence of who controlled the\r\npremises would be relevant if incriminating evidence were\r\nfound and it became necessary to tie that evidence to a\r\nperson, ” and the District Court approved that aspect of\r\nthe warrant on this basis. App. to Pet. for Cert. 158–159\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Given Bowen’s known\r\ngang affiliation, a reasonable officer could conclude that\r\ngang paraphernalia found at the residence would be an\r\neffective means of demonstrating Bowen’s control over the\r\npremises or his connection to evidence found there.7\r\n——————\r\nunreasonable for an officer to have reached a different conclusion from\r\nthe facts in the affidavit. See n. 2, supra.\r\n  7 The Fourth Amendment does not require probable cause to believe\r\n\r\nevidence will conclusively establish a fact before permitting a search,\r\nbut only “probable cause . . . to believe the evidence sought will aid in a\r\nparticular apprehension or conviction.” Warden, Md. Penitentiary v.\r\nHayden, 387 U. S. 294, 307 (1967) (emphasis added). Even if gang\r\nevidence might have turned out not to be conclusive because other\r\n16               MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                         Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n   Whatever the use to which evidence of Bowen’s gang\r\ninvolvement might ultimately have been put, it would not\r\nhave been “entirely unreasonable” for an officer to believe\r\nthat the facts set out in the affidavit established a fair\r\nprobability that such evidence would aid the prosecution\r\nof Bowen for the criminal acts at issue. Leon, 468 U. S., at\r\n923 (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n                              B\r\n   Whether any of these facts, standing alone or taken\r\ntogether, actually establish probable cause is a question\r\nwe need not decide. Qualified immunity “gives govern-\r\nment officials breathing room to make reasonable but\r\nmistaken judgments.” al-Kidd, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\r\nat 12). The officers’ judgment that the scope of the war-\r\nrant was supported by probable cause may have been\r\nmistaken, but it was not “plainly incompetent.” Malley,\r\n475 U. S., at 341.\r\n   On top of all this, the fact that the officers sought and\r\nobtained approval of the warrant application from a supe-\r\nrior and a deputy district attorney before submitting it to\r\nthe magistrate provides further support for the conclusion\r\nthat an officer could reasonably have believed that the\r\nscope of the warrant was supported by probable cause.\r\nIbid. Before seeking to have the warrant issued by a\r\nmagistrate, Messerschmidt conducted an extensive inves-\r\ntigation into Bowen’s background and the facts of the\r\ncrime. Based on this investigation, Messerschmidt pre-\r\npared a detailed warrant application that truthfully laid\r\n——————\r\nmembers of the Millender household also had gang ties, see post, at 8\r\n(opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.); post, at 2–3 (opinion of KAGAN, J.), a rea-\r\nsonable officer could still conclude that evidence of gang membership\r\nwould help show Bowen’s connection to the residence. Such evidence\r\ncould, for example, have displayed Bowen’s gang moniker (“C Jay”)\r\nor could have been identified by Kelly as belonging to Bowen. See\r\nApp. 64.\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

The only facts omitted—the offi-\r\ncers’ knowledge of Bowen’s arrest and conviction records,\r\nsee supra, at 3—would only have strengthened the war-\r\nrant. Messerschmidt then submitted the warrant applica-\r\ntion for review by Lawrence, another superior officer, and\r\na deputy district attorney, all of whom approved the appli-\r\ncation without any apparent misgivings. Only after this\r\ndid Messerschmidt seek the approval of a neutral magis-\r\ntrate, who issued the requested warrant. The officers thus\r\n“took every step that could reasonably be expected of\r\nthem.” Massachusetts v. Sheppard, 468 U. S. 981, 989\r\n(1984). In light of the foregoing, it cannot be said that “no\r\nofficer of reasonable competence would have requested the\r\nwarrant.” Malley, 475 U. S., at 346, n. 9. Indeed, a con-\r\ntrary conclusion would mean not only that Messerschmidt\r\nand Lawrence were “plainly incompetent,” id., at 341, but\r\nthat their supervisor, the deputy district attorney, and the\r\nmagistrate were as well.\r\n   The Court of Appeals, however, gave no weight to the\r\nfact that the warrant had been reviewed and approved\r\nby the officers’ superiors, a deputy district attorney, and a\r\nneutral magistrate. Relying on Malley, the court held that\r\nthe officers had an “independent responsibility to ensure\r\nthere [was] at least a colorable argument for probable\r\ncause.” 620 F. 3d, at 1034. It explained that “[t]he depu-\r\nties here had a responsibility to exercise their reasonable\r\nprofessional judgment,” and that “in circumstances such\r\nas these a neutral magistrate’s approval (and, a fortiori,\r\na non-neutral prosecutor’s) cannot absolve an officer of\r\nliability.” Ibid. (citation omitted).\r\n   We rejected in Malley the contention that an officer is\r\nautomatically entitled to qualified immunity for seeking a\r\nwarrant unsupported by probable cause, simply because\r\na magistrate had approved the application. 475 U. S., at\r\n345. And because the officers’ superior and the deputy\r\ndistrict attorney are part of the prosecution team, their\r\n18            MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nreview also cannot be regarded as dispositive. But by\r\nholding in Malley that a magistrate’s approval does not\r\nautomatically render an officer’s conduct reasonable, we\r\ndid not suggest that approval by a magistrate or review\r\nby others is irrelevant to the objective reasonableness of\r\nthe officers’ determination that the warrant was valid.\r\nIndeed, we expressly noted that we were not deciding\r\n“whether [the officer’s] conduct in [that] case was in fact\r\nobjectively reasonable.” Id., at 345, n. 8. The fact that the\r\nofficers secured these approvals is certainly pertinent in\r\nassessing whether they could have held a reasonable belief\r\nthat the warrant was supported by probable cause.\r\n                             C\r\n    In holding that the warrant in this case was so obvious-\r\nly defective that no reasonable officer could have believed\r\nit was valid, the court below relied heavily on our decision\r\nin Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U. S. 551 (2004), but that prece-\r\ndent is far afield. There, we held that officers who carried\r\nout a warrant-approved search were not entitled to quali-\r\nfied immunity because the warrant in question failed to\r\ndescribe the items to be seized at all. Id., at 557. We\r\nexplained that “[i]n the portion of the form that called for\r\na description of the ‘person or property’ to be seized, [the\r\napplicant] typed a description of [the target’s] two-story\r\nblue house rather than the alleged stockpile of firearms.”\r\nId., at 554. Thus, the warrant stated nonsensically that\r\n“ ‘there is now concealed [on the specified premises] a\r\ncertain person or property, namely [a] single dwelling\r\nresidence two story in height which is blue in color and\r\nhas two additions attached to the east.’ ” Id., at 554–555,\r\nn. 2 (bracketed material in original). Because “even a\r\ncursory reading of the warrant in [that] case—perhaps\r\njust a simple glance—would have revealed a glaring de-\r\nficiency that any reasonable police officer would have\r\nknown was constitutionally fatal,” id., at 564, we held that\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          19\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\nthe officer was not entitled to qualified immunity.\r\n   The instant case is not remotely similar. In contrast to\r\nGroh, any defect here would not have been obvious from\r\nthe face of the warrant. Rather, any arguable defect\r\nwould have become apparent only upon a close parsing of\r\nthe warrant application, and a comparison of the affidavit\r\nto the terms of the warrant to determine whether the\r\naffidavit established probable cause to search for all the\r\nitems listed in the warrant. This is not an error that\r\n“just a simple glance” would have revealed. Ibid. Indeed,\r\nunlike in Groh, the officers here did not merely submit\r\ntheir application to a magistrate. They also presented it\r\nfor review by a superior officer, and a deputy district\r\nattorney, before submitting it to the magistrate. The fact\r\nthat none of the officials who reviewed the application\r\nexpressed concern about its validity demonstrates that\r\nany error was not obvious. Groh plainly does not control\r\nthe result here.\r\n                        *    *     *\r\n  The question in this case is not whether the magistrate\r\nerred in believing there was sufficient probable cause to\r\nsupport the scope of the warrant he issued. It is instead\r\nwhether the magistrate so obviously erred that any rea-\r\nsonable officer would have recognized the error. The\r\noccasions on which this standard will be met may be rare,\r\nbut so too are the circumstances in which it will be appro-\r\npriate to impose personal liability on a lay officer in the\r\nface of judicial approval of his actions. Even if the war-\r\nrant in this case were invalid, it was not so obviously\r\nlacking in probable cause that the officers can be con-\r\nsidered “plainly incompetent” for concluding otherwise.\r\nMalley, supra, at 341. The judgment of the Court of Ap-\r\npeals denying the officers qualified immunity must there-\r\nfore be reversed.\r\n                                           It is so ordered.\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

In\r\nsupport of this conclusion, it cites two sets of circum-\r\nstances. First, the majority points to “Bowen’s possession\r\nof one illegal gun, his gang membership, his willingness to\r\nuse the gun to kill someone, and his concern about the\r\npolice . . . .” Ante, at 11. Second, the majority notes that\r\n“[a] reasonable officer also could believe that seizure of the\r\nfirearms was necessary to prevent further assaults on\r\nKelly,” because “Bowen had already attempted to murder\r\nKelly once with a firearm, and had yelled ‘I’ll kill you’ as\r\nshe tried to escape from him.” Ante, at 12. In my view,\r\ngiven all these circumstances together, the officers could\r\nreasonably have believed that the scope of their search\r\nwas supported by probable cause. On that basis, I concur.\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

I think the right\r\nanswer lies in between, although the Court makes the\r\nmore far-reaching error.\r\n   I agree with the Court that a reasonably competent\r\npolice officer could have thought this warrant valid in\r\nauthorizing a search for all firearms and related items.\r\nSee ante, at 11–12. The warrant application recounted\r\nthat a known gang member had used a sawed-off shot-\r\ngun—an illegal weapon under California law, see Cal.\r\nPenal Code Ann. §33215 (West 2012 Cum. Supp.)—to try\r\nto kill another person. See App. 56–57, 59. Perhaps gang\r\nties plus possession of an unlawful gun plus use of that\r\ngun to commit a violent assault do not add up to what was\r\nneeded for this search: probable cause to believe that\r\nBowen had additional illegal firearms (or legal firearms\r\nthat he intended to use to violate the law) at the place he\r\nwas staying. But because our and the Ninth Circuit’s\r\ndecisions leave that conclusion debatable, a reasonable\r\n2             MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of KAGAN, J.\r\n\r\npolice officer could have found the warrant adequately\r\nsupported by “indicia of probable cause.” Malley v. Briggs,\r\n475 U. S. 335, 345 (1986). So Messerschmidt and his\r\nfellow officers should receive qualified immunity for their\r\nsearch for firearms.\r\n   The Court, however, goes astray when it holds that a\r\nreasonable officer could have thought the warrant valid in\r\napproving a search for evidence of “street gang member-\r\nship,” App. 52. Membership in even the worst gang does\r\nnot violate California law, so the officers could not search\r\nfor gang paraphernalia just to establish Bowen’s ties to\r\nthe Crips. Instead, the police needed probable cause to\r\nbelieve that such items would provide evidence of an\r\nactual crime—and as the Court acknowledges, see ante, at\r\n12–14, the only crime mentioned in the warrant applica-\r\ntion was the assault on Kelly. The problem for the Court\r\nis that nothing in the application supports a link between\r\nBowen’s gang membership and that shooting. Contra the\r\nCourt’s elaborate theory-spinning, see ante, at 12–16,\r\nMesserschmidt’s affidavit in fact characterized the violent\r\nassault only as a domestic dispute, not as a gang-related\r\none, see App. 55 (describing the crime as a “spousal as-\r\nsault and an assault with a deadly weapon”). And that\r\ndescription is consistent with the most natural under-\r\nstanding of the events. The warrant application thus had\r\na hole at its very center: It lacked any explanation of how\r\ngang items would (or even might) provide evidence of the\r\ndomestic assault the police were investigating.\r\n   To fill this vacuum, the Court proposes an alternative,\r\nbut similarly inadequate justification—that gang para-\r\nphernalia could have demonstrated Bowen’s connection to\r\nthe Millender residence and to any evidence of the assault\r\nfound there. The dissent rightly notes one difficulty with\r\nthis argument: The discovery of gang items would not\r\nhave established that Bowen was staying at the house,\r\ngiven that several other gang members regularly did so.\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)             3\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of KAGAN, J.\r\n\r\nSee post, at 8–9 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). And even\r\nsetting that issue aside, the Court’s reasoning proves far\r\ntoo much: It would sanction equally well a search for any\r\nof Bowen’s possessions on the premises—a result impos-\r\nsible to square with the Fourth Amendment. See, e.g.,\r\nAndresen v. Maryland, 427 U. S. 463, 480 (1976) (disap-\r\nproving “ ‘a general, exploratory rummaging in a person’s\r\nbelongings’ ” (quoting Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403\r\nU. S. 443, 467 (1971))). In authorizing a search for all\r\ngang-related items, the warrant far outstripped the offic-\r\ners’ probable cause. Because a reasonable officer would\r\nhave recognized that defect, I would not award qualified\r\nimmunity to Messerschmidt and his colleagues for this\r\naspect of their search.\r\n  Still more fundamentally, the Court errs in scolding the\r\nCourt of Appeals for failing to give “weight to the fact that\r\nthe warrant had been reviewed and approved by the offic-\r\ners’ superiors, a deputy district attorney, and a neutral\r\nmagistrate.” Ante, at 17. As the dissent points out,\r\nsee post, at 13–15, this Court’s holding in Malley is to\r\nthe opposite effect: An officer is not “entitled to rely on the\r\njudgment of a judicial officer in finding that probable\r\ncause exists and hence issuing the warrant.” 475 U. S., at\r\n345. Malley made clear that qualified immunity turned\r\non the officer’s own “professional judgment,” considered\r\nseparately from the mistake of the magistrate. Id., at 346;\r\nsee ibid., n. 9 (“The officer . . . cannot excuse his own\r\ndefault by pointing to the greater incompetence of the\r\nmagistrate”); id., at 350 (Powell, J., concurring in part and\r\ndissenting in part) (objecting to the Court’s decision to\r\n“give little evidentiary weight to the finding of probable\r\ncause by a magistrate”). And what we said in Malley\r\nabout a magistrate’s authorization applies still more\r\nstrongly to the approval of other police officers or state\r\nattorneys. All those individuals, as the Court puts it, are\r\n“part of the prosecution team.” Ante, at 18. To make their\r\n4             MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                    Opinion of KAGAN, J.\r\n\r\nviews relevant is to enable those teammates (whether\r\nacting in good or bad faith) to confer immunity on each\r\nother for unreasonable conduct—like applying for a war-\r\nrant without anything resembling probable cause.\r\n  For these reasons, I would reverse in part and affirm in\r\npart the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and I would\r\nremand this case for further proceedings.\r\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

United States, 282 U. S. 344, 357\r\n(1931). The Fourth Amendment was adopted specifically\r\nin response to the Crown’s practice of using general war-\r\nrants and writs of assistance to search “suspected places”\r\nfor evidence of smuggling, libel, or other crimes. Boyd v.\r\nUnited States, 116 U. S. 616, 625–626 (1886). Early patri-\r\nots railed against these practices as “the worst instrument\r\nof arbitrary power” and John Adams later claimed that\r\n“the child Independence was born” from colonists’ opposi-\r\ntion to their use. Id., at 625 (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted).\r\n   To prevent the issue of general warrants on “loose,\r\nvague or doubtful bases of fact,” Go-Bart Importing Co.,\r\n282 U. S., at 357, the Framers established the inviolable\r\nprinciple that should resolve this case: “no Warrants shall\r\nissue, but upon probable cause . . . and particularly de-\r\nscribing the . . . things to be seized.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 4.\r\nThat is, the police must articulate an adequate reason to\r\nsearch for specific items related to specific crimes.\r\n2              MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n    In this case, police officers investigating a specific, non-\r\ngang-related assault committed with a specific firearm (a\r\nsawed-off shotgun) obtained a warrant to search for all\r\nevidence related to “any Street Gang,” “[a]ny photographs\r\n. . . which may depict evidence of criminal activity,” and\r\n“any firearms.” App. 52. They did so for the asserted\r\nreason that the search might lead to evidence related to\r\nother gang members and other criminal activity, and that\r\nother “[v]alid warrants commonly allow police to search\r\nfor ‘firearms and ammunition.’ ” See infra, at 8–9. That\r\nkind of general warrant is antithetical to the Fourth\r\nAmendment.\r\n    The Court nonetheless concludes that the officers are\r\nentitled to qualified immunity because their conduct was\r\n“objectively reasonable.” I could not disagree more. All\r\n13 federal judges who previously considered this case\r\nhad little difficulty concluding that the police officers’\r\nsearch for any gang-related material violated the Fourth\r\nAmendment. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 28–29, 45, n. 7,\r\n73, 94, 157–158. And a substantial majority agreed that\r\nthe police’s search for both gang-related material and all\r\nfirearms not only violated the Fourth Amendment, but\r\nwas objectively unreasonable. Like them, I believe that\r\nany “reasonably well-trained officer in petitioner’s position\r\nwould have known that his affidavit failed to establish\r\nprobable cause.” Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 345\r\n(1986).\r\n    The Court also hints that a police officer’s otherwise\r\nunreasonable conduct may be excused by the approval of\r\na magistrate, or more disturbingly, another police officer.\r\nAnte, at 16–18. That is inconsistent with our focus on the\r\nobjective reasonableness of an officer’s decision to submit\r\na warrant application to a magistrate, and we long ago\r\nrejected it. See Malley, 475 U.

For all these reasons,\r\nI respectfully dissent.\r\n                             I\r\n   The Court holds that a well-trained officer could have\r\nreasonably concluded that there was probable cause to\r\nsearch the Millenders’ residence for any evidence of affilia-\r\ntion with “any Street Gang,” and “all handguns, rifles, or\r\nshotguns of any caliber, or any firearms capable of firing\r\nammunition.” App. 52.1 I cannot agree.\r\n                              A\r\n   Most troubling is the Court’s determination that peti-\r\ntioners reasonably could have concluded that they had\r\nprobable cause to search for all evidence of any gang affili-\r\nation in the Millenders’ home. The Court reaches this\r\nresult only by way of an unprecedented, post hoc recon-\r\nstruction of the crime that wholly ignores the police’s own\r\nconclusions, as well as the undisputed facts presented to\r\nthe District Court.\r\n   The Court primarily theorizes that “[a] reasonable of-\r\nficer could certainly view Bowen’s attack as motivated\r\nnot by the souring of his romantic relationship with Kelly\r\nbut instead by a desire to prevent her from disclosing\r\ndetails of his gang activity to the police.” Ante, at 13. The\r\nmajority therefore dismisses as “misleading” the Millen-\r\nders’ characterization of the case as a “domestic dispute,”\r\ninsisting that Detective Messerschmidt could have rea-\r\nsonably thought that the crime was gang related. See\r\nante, at 13–14.2\r\n——————\r\n  1 Not even the Court defends the warrant’s authorization to search for\r\n\r\n“[a]ny photographs . . . which may depict evidence of criminal activity.”\r\n  2 The Court implies Detective Messerschmidt did not consider the\r\n\r\ncrime “solely . . . a domestic dispute” because he labeled it a “spousal\r\nassault and an assault with a deadly weapon.” Ante, at 13 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). Solely domestic disputes often involve gun\r\nviolence, however. See Sorenson & Weibe, Weapons in the Lives of\r\n4                MESSERSCHMIDT v.

Detective Messerschmidt’s\r\ndeposition is illustrative.\r\n     “Q: So as far as you knew, it was just sort of a spousal-\r\n     abuse-type case where the perpetrator happened to be\r\n     in a gang, right?\r\n     “A: Correct.\r\n     “Q: So you didn’t have any reason to believe that the\r\n     assault on Kelly was any sort of gang crime, did you?\r\n     “A: No.” Record in No. CV 05–2298 DDP (RZx) (CD\r\n     Cal.)

Health 1412, 1413 (2004) (noting\r\nmore than one-third of female domestic violence shelter residents in\r\nCalifornia reported having been threatened or harmed with a firearm).\r\nThat was the case here. In any event, the Court’s reading of Detective\r\nMesserschmidt’s affidavit is incompatible with his testimony that the\r\ncrime was “just sort of a spousal-abuse-type case,” not a “gang crime.”\r\nSee supra this page.\r\n  3 By suggesting that courts assessing qualified immunity should ig-\r\n\r\nnore police officers’ testimony about the information they possessed at\r\nthe time of the search, ante, at 14–15, n. 6, the Court misreads Harlow\r\nv. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 815–819 (1982), and Anderson v.\r\nCreighton, 483 U. S. 635, 645 (1987). In Harlow, we adopted a qualified\r\nimmunity test focusing on an officer’s objective good faith, rather than\r\nwhether the officer searched “with the malicious intention to cause a\r\ndeprivation of constitutional rights or other injury.” 457 U. S., at 815.\r\nAs we have explained, “examination of the information possessed by the\r\nsearching officials . . . does not reintroduce into qualified immunity\r\nanalysis the inquiry into officials’ subjective intent that Harlow sought\r\nto minimize.” Anderson, 483 U. S., at 641. It is therefore highly\r\nrelevant that Detective Messerschmidt testified that he lacked “any\r\nreason” to consider the crime gang related, supra this page, and pos-\r\nsessed no “information” that there were handguns in the Millenders’\r\nhome, infra, at 11. Courts cannot ignore information in crime analysis\r\nforms, ballistic reports, or victim interviews by labeling such infor-\r\nmation “conclusions.”\r\n                      Cite as: 565 U.

See App. 41, 44 (Crime Analysis Supplemental\r\nForm–M. O. Factors). And the District Court noted it was\r\nundisputed that Detective Messerschmidt “had no reason\r\nto believe Bowen’s crime was a ‘gang’ crime.” App. to Pet.\r\nfor Cert. 115.4\r\n   The police’s conclusions matched the victim’s own ac-\r\ncount of the attack. Kelly asked police officers to help her\r\nmove out because Bowen “ha[d] a domestic violence on his\r\nrecord,” had “hit [her] once or twice” already, had repeat-\r\nedly threatened her “You’ll never leave me. I’ll kill you\r\nif you leave me,” and she was “planning on breaking up”\r\nwith him. Record, Doc. 51 (Exh. C), pp. 5–6 (hereinafter\r\nKelly Interview). As Kelly described the confrontation, it\r\nwas only after she fled to her car in order to leave that\r\nBowen reemerged from their shared apartment with the\r\nshotgun and told her “I’m gonna kill your ass right here if\r\nyou take off,” consistent with his prior threats. Id., at 7–8.\r\nEvery piece of information, therefore, accorded with Detec-\r\ntive Messerschmidt’s conclusion: The crime was domestic\r\nviolence that was not gang related.5\r\n——————\r\n   4 The Court is wrong to imply that courts should not consider “facts\r\n\r\noutside the affidavit,” but within the officers’ possession, when as-\r\nsessing qualified immunity. Ante, at 10, n. 2. Our precedents make\r\nclear that the objective reasonableness of an officer’s conduct is judged\r\n“in light of clearly established law and the information the officers\r\npossessed.” Wilson v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 615 (1999). If an officer\r\npossesses information indicating that he lacks probable cause to search,\r\nand that information was not presented to the neutral magistrate when\r\nhe approved the search, it is particularly likely that “a reasonably well\r\ntrained officer would have known that the search was illegal despite\r\nthe magistrate’s authorization.” United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897,\r\n922, n. 23 (1984).\r\n   5 To support its theory that Bowen attacked Kelly to keep her silent\r\n\r\nabout his gang activity, the majority relies principally on its claim that\r\nBowen yelled, “ ‘I told you never to call the cops on me bitch!’ ” ante, at\r\n2, citing it no less than five times.

The Court provides no justification\r\nfor sweeping aside the conclusions he reached on the basis\r\nof his far greater expertise, let alone the facts found by the\r\nDistrict Court. We have repeatedly and recently warned\r\nappellate courts, “far removed from the scene,” against\r\nsecond-guessing the judgments made by the police or\r\nreweighing the facts as they stood before the district court.\r\nRyburn v. Huff, 565 U. S. —, — (2012) (per curiam) (slip\r\nop., at 6–8). The majority’s decision today is totally incon-\r\nsistent with those principles.\r\n   Qualified immunity analysis does not direct courts to\r\nplay the role of crime scene investigators, second-guessing\r\npolice officers’ determinations as to whether a crime was\r\ncommitted with a handgun or a shotgun, or whether vio-\r\n——————\r\nto murder” Kelly “on the asserted ground that she had ‘call[ed] the cops’\r\non him”); see also ante, at 1, 13. Bowen, however, never made that\r\nstatement. Though it appears in the warrant application, the words\r\nare Messerschmidt’s—taken from his own inaccurate notes of Kelly’s\r\naccount of the crime. What Kelly actually said during her interview\r\nwas that as soon as the police deputies left, Bowen “came out of no-\r\nwhere talking about, ‘Did you call the police on me? You called the\r\npolice on me,’ ” to which Kelly responded “no one called the police on\r\nyou . . . . [I]nstead of arguing and fighting with you I just want to get\r\nmy shit done.” Kelly Interview 7; compare ibid. with Record, Doc. 51\r\n(Exh. B), p. 3 (Messerschmidt’s narrative of interview with Kelly). Only\r\nafter Kelly started to leave did Bowen exclaim “oh it’s like that. It’s\r\nlike that,” retrieve a gun, and threaten to shoot her if she left. Kelly\r\nInterview 7–8. That Bowen was “ ‘angry,’ ” ante, at 14, n. 5, because she\r\nhad called the sheriff's department for assistance reflected exactly what\r\nKelly and the police expected at the outset—that Bowen “would give\r\nher a hard time about moving out.” App. 38 (sheriff’s department\r\nincident report).\r\n                 Cite as: 565 U.

Indeed,\r\nwe have warned courts against asking “whether another\r\nreasonable, or more reasonable, interpretation of the\r\nevents can be constructed five years after the fact.”\r\nHunter v. Bryant, 502 U. S. 224, 228 (1991) (per curiam).\r\nThe inquiry our precedents demand is not whether differ-\r\nent conclusions might conceivably be drawn from the\r\ncrime scene. Rather, it is whether “a reasonably well-\r\ntrained officer in petitioner’s position would have known\r\nthat his affidavit failed to establish probable cause.”\r\nMalley, 475 U. S., at 345. The operative question in this\r\ncase, therefore, is whether—given that, as petitioners\r\ncomprehended, the crime itself was not gang related—a\r\nreasonable officer nonetheless could have believed he had\r\nprobable cause to seek a warrant to search the suspect’s\r\nresidence for all evidence of affiliation not only with the\r\nsuspect’s street gang, but “any Street Gang.” He could\r\nnot.\r\n  The Court offers two secondary explanations for why a\r\nsearch for gang-related items might have been justified,\r\nbut they are equally unpersuasive. First, the majority\r\nsuggests that such evidence hypothetically “might prove\r\nhelpful in impeaching Bowen or rebutting various de-\r\nfenses he could raise at trial.” Ante, at 15. That is a non-\r\nstarter. The Fourth Amendment does not permit the police\r\nto search for evidence solely because it could be admissible\r\nfor impeachment or rebuttal purposes. If it did, the police\r\nwould be equally entitled to obtain warrants to rifle\r\nthrough the papers of anyone reasonably suspected of a\r\ncrime for all evidence of his bad character, Fed. Rule Evid.\r\n404(a)(2)(B)(i), or any evidence of any “crime, wrong, or\r\nother act” that might prove the defendant’s “motive, op-\r\nportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity,\r\nabsence of mistake, or lack of accident,” Fed. Rule Evid.\r\n404(b)(2). Indeed, the majority’s rationale presumably\r\nwould authorize the police to search the residence of every\r\n8               MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nmember of Bowen’s street gang for similar weapons—\r\nwhich likewise “might [have] prove[d] helpful in impeach-\r\ning Bowen or rebutting various defenses he could raise at\r\ntrial.” Ante, at 15. It has long been the case, however,\r\nthat such general searches, detached from probable cause,\r\nare impermissible. See, e.g., Go-Bart Importing Co., 282\r\nU. S., at 357. By their own admission, however, the offic-\r\ners were not searching for gang-related indicia to bolster\r\nsome hypothetical impeachment theory, but for other\r\nreasons: because “photos sought re gang membership\r\ncould be linked with other gang members, evidencing\r\ncriminal activity as gang affiliation is an enhancement to\r\ncriminal charges.” App. 181; see also id., at 145. That\r\nkind of fishing expedition for evidence of unidentified\r\ncriminal activity committed by unspecified persons was\r\nthe very evil the Fourth Amendment was intended to\r\nprevent.\r\n   Finally, the Court concludes that “even if this were\r\nmerely a domestic dispute, a reasonable officer could still\r\nconclude that gang paraphernalia found at the Millenders’\r\nresidence would aid in the prosecution of Bowen by, for\r\nexample, demonstrating Bowen’s connection to other\r\n[unspecified] evidence found there.” Ante, at 15. That is\r\ndifficult to understand. The police were well aware before\r\nobtaining a warrant that “other persons associated with\r\nthe home, the Millender family members, were active\r\nMona Park Crip gang members.” App. 28. Simply finding\r\ngang-related paraphernalia, therefore, would have done\r\nlittle to establish probable cause that particular evidence\r\nfound in the home was connected to Bowen, rather than\r\nany of the several other active gang members who resided\r\nfull time at the Millender home.6 Moreover, it would have\r\n——————\r\n  6 The Court suggests that even if gang-related evidence would be\r\n\r\ninconclusive generally, evidence bearing Bowen’s particular gang mon-\r\niker could have demonstrated Bowen’s connection to the residence.\r\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

Notably absent from the Court’s\r\ndiscussion is any acknowledgment of the actual basis for\r\npetitioners’ search. The police officers searched for all\r\nfirearms not for the reasons hypothesized by the majority,\r\nbut because they determined that “[v]alid warrants com-\r\nmonly allow police to search for ‘firearms and ammuni-\r\ntion,’ ” and that “[h]ere, any caliber of shotgun or receipts\r\nwould show possession of and/or purchase of guns.” Id., at\r\n144, 180–181; see also Brief for Appellant in No. 07–55518\r\n(CA9), p. 41 (hereinafter CA9 Brief). It is small wonder\r\nthat the District Court found these arguments “nonsensi-\r\ncal and unpersuasive.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 157. It bears\r\nrepeating that the Founders adopted the Fourth Amend-\r\nment to protect against searches for evidence of unspeci-\r\nfied crimes. And merely possessing other firearms is not a\r\ncrime at all. See generally District of Columbia v. Heller,\r\n554 U. S. 570 (2008).8\r\n——————\r\nBut the warrant did not authorize a search for items bearing Bowen’s\r\nmoniker, but rather for items related to “any Street Gang,” including\r\ncountless street gangs of which Bowen was not a member. App. 52.\r\nEven under the Court’s interpretation, therefore, the warrant was\r\nhopelessly overbroad and invalid.\r\n  7 The police also could not search for gang-related evidence for its own\r\n\r\nsake. Mere membership in a gang is not a crime under California law.\r\nSee People v. Gardeley, 14 Cal. 4th 605, 623, 927 P. 2d 713, 725 (1996).\r\n  8 Although the Court recites additional facts about Bowen’s back-\r\n\r\nground and arrest record, ante, at 2–3, none of these facts were dis-\r\nclosed to the magistrate. The police cannot rationalize a search post\r\nhoc on the basis of information they failed to set forth in their warrant\r\napplication to a neutral magistrate. Rather, “[i]t is elementary that in\r\npassing on the validity of a warrant, the reviewing court may consider\r\nonly information brought to the magistrate’s attention.” Aguilar v.\r\n10               MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n   By justifying the officers’ actions on reasons of its own\r\ninvention, the Court ignores the reasons the officers actu-\r\nally gave, as well as the facts upon which this case was\r\ndecided below. The majority’s analysis—akin to a rational-\r\nbasis test—is thus far removed from what qualified\r\nimmunity analysis demands. Even if the police had\r\nsearched for the reasons the Court proposes, however, I\r\nstill would find it inappropriate to afford them qualified\r\nimmunity.\r\n   The Court correctly recognizes that to satisfy the Fourth\r\nAmendment the police were required to demonstrate\r\nprobable cause that (1) other firearms could be found at\r\nthe Millenders’ residence; and (2) such weapons were\r\nillegal or were “ ‘possess[ed] . . . with the intent to use\r\nthem as a means of committing a public offense.’ ” Ante, at\r\n12 (quoting Cal. Penal Code Ann. §1524(a)(3) (West\r\n2011)). The warrant failed to establish either.\r\n   The majority has little difficulty concluding that because\r\nBowen fired one firearm, it was reasonable for the police\r\nto conclude not only that Bowen must have possessed\r\nothers, but that he must be storing these other weapons\r\nat his 73-year-old former foster mother’s home.9 Again,\r\nhowever, this is not what the police actually concluded, as\r\nDetective Messerschmidt’s deposition makes clear.\r\n     “Q: Did you have any reason to believe there would be\r\n\r\n——————\r\nTexas, 378 U. S. 108, 109, n. 1 (1964); see also United States v. Jacob-\r\nsen, 466 U. S. 109, 112 (1984). Likewise, a police officer cannot obtain\r\nqualified immunity for searching pursuant to a warrant by relying\r\nupon facts outside that warrant, as evinced by Malley’s focus on\r\n“whether a reasonably well-trained officer in petitioner’s position would\r\nhave known that his affidavit failed to establish probable cause.”\r\nMalley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 345 (1986) (emphasis added).\r\n  9 The majority ignores that Bowen retrieved the shotgun that he fired\r\n\r\nfrom the apartment he shared with Kelly, not the Millenders’ home.\r\nKelly provided no indication that Bowen possessed other guns or that\r\nhe stored them at his former foster mother’s home.\r\n                    Cite as: 565 U.

[a]ll\r\ncaliber of ammunition, miscellaneous gun parts, gun\r\ncleaning kits, holsters which could hold or have held any\r\ncaliber handgun being sought,” and “[a]ny receipts or\r\npaperwork, showing the purchase, ownership, or posses-\r\nsion of the handguns being sought.” App. 52. That is\r\npuzzling. If any aspect of the Fourth Amendment is clear-\r\nly established, it is that the police cannot reasonably\r\nsearch—even pursuant to a warrant—for items that they\r\ndo not have “any reason to believe” will be present. The\r\nCourt’s conclusion to the contrary simply reads the “prob-\r\nable cause” requirement out of the Fourth Amendment.\r\n   Even assuming that the police reasonably could have\r\nconcluded that Bowen possessed other guns and was\r\nstoring them at the Millenders’ home, I cannot agree that\r\nthe warrant provided probable cause to believe any weap-\r\non possessed in a home in which 10 persons regularly\r\nlived—none of them the suspect in this case—was either\r\n“contraband or evidence of a crime.” Ornelas v. United\r\nStates, 517 U. S. 690, 696 (1996). The warrant set forth no\r\nspecific facts or particularized explanation establishing\r\nprobable cause to believe that other guns found in the\r\nhome were connected to the crime specified in the warrant\r\nor were otherwise illegal.10 While the Court hypothesizes\r\n——————\r\n  10 Augusta Millender was a 73-year-old grandmother living in a dan-\r\n\r\ngerous part of Los Angeles.

And the police officers confirmed that their\r\nsearch was targeted to find the gun related to “the crime\r\nat issue.” CA9 Brief 42; see also App. 52 (obtaining au-\r\nthorization to search for “the item being sought and or\r\nbelieved to be evidence in the case being investigated on\r\nthis warrant” (emphasis added)).\r\n   The police told the Ninth Circuit that they searched for\r\nall firearms not because, as the majority hypothesizes,\r\n“there would be additional illegal guns among others that\r\nBowen owned,” ante, at 11–12, but on the dubious theory\r\nthat “Kelly could have been mistaken in her description of\r\nthe gun.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 20–21. The Ninth Circuit\r\nproperly dismissed that argument as carrying “little\r\nforce.” Id., at 21. Its finding is unimpeachable, given that\r\nKelly presented the police with a photograph of Bowen\r\nholding the specific gun used in the crime, and the police,\r\nthe victim, and a witness to the crime all identified the\r\ngun as a sawed-off shotgun. See id., at 20, 21, 24, 28.\r\n   Finally, the majority suggests that the officers could\r\nhave reasonably believed that seizure of all firearms at the\r\nMillenders’ residence was justified because those weapons\r\nmight be possessed by Bowen “ ‘with the intent to use\r\nthem as a means of committing a public offense.’ ” Ante, at\r\n12. But the warrant specified that the police sought only\r\nthe shotgun used in this crime for that purpose. See App.\r\n59 (statement of probable cause) (“Your Affiant also be-\r\nlieves that the items sought will be in the possession of\r\nJerry Ray Bowen and the recovery of the weapon could be\r\ninvaluable in the successful prosecution of the suspect\r\ninvolved in this case, and the curtailment of further\r\n——————\r\nout to be the case.\r\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

Fitz-\r\ngerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982).\r\n  The majority asserts, without citation, that the magis-\r\ntrate’s approval is relevant to objective reasonableness.\r\nThat view, however, is expressly contradicted by our hold-\r\ning in Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335. There, we found\r\nthat a police officer is not “entitled to rely on the judgment\r\nof a judicial officer in finding that probable cause exists\r\nand hence issuing the warrant,” and explained that “[that]\r\nview of objective reasonableness is at odds with our devel-\r\nopment of that concept in Harlow and [United States v.\r\nLeon, 468 U.

It is hardly surprising, for instance,\r\nthat Detective Messerschmidt did not include in his affidavit further\r\nfacts affirming that the crime was not gang related, given that he did\r\nnot believe the crime was gang related and did not search for gang-\r\nrelated material for that reason. See supra, at 7–8. The affidavit and\r\nwarrant were perfectly consistent with the officers’ stated reasons for\r\ntheir search—just not with the Court’s own theories.\r\n14               MESSERSCHMIDT v. MILLENDER\r\n\r\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nofficer reasonably relied on a magistrate’s probable cause\r\ndetermination, but rather “whether a reasonably well-\r\ntrained officer in petitioner’s position would have known\r\nthat his affidavit failed to establish probable cause and\r\nthat he should not have applied for the warrant.” Ibid.\r\n(emphasis added).13 In such a case, “the officer’s applica-\r\ntion for a warrant [would] not [be] objectively reasonable,\r\nbecause it create[s] the unnecessary danger of an unlawful\r\narrest.” Ibid. When “no officer of reasonable competence\r\nwould have requested the warrant,” a “magistrate [who]\r\nissues the warrant [makes] not just a reasonable mistake,\r\nbut an unacceptable error indicating gross incompetence\r\nor neglect of duty.” Id., at 346, n. 9. In such cases, “[t]he\r\nofficer . . . cannot excuse his own default by pointing to the\r\ngreater incompetence of the magistrate.” Ibid.\r\n   In cases in which it would be not only wrong but un-\r\nreasonable for any well-trained officer to seek a warrant,\r\nallowing a magistrate’s approval to immunize the police\r\nofficer’s unreasonable action retrospectively makes little\r\nsense. By motivating an officer “to reflect, before submit-\r\nting a request for a warrant, upon whether he has a rea-\r\nsonable basis for believing that his affidavit establishes\r\nprobable cause,” we recognized that our qualified immu-\r\nnity precedents had the “desirable” effect of “reduc[ing] the\r\nlikelihood that the officer’s request for a warrant will be\r\npremature,” leading to “a waste of judicial resources” or\r\n“premature arrests.” Id., at 343. To the extent it proposes\r\nto cut back upon Malley, the majority will promote the\r\nopposite result—encouraging sloppy police work and ex-\r\nacerbating the risk that searches will not comport with\r\nthe requirements of the Fourth Amendment.\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  13 Two  Justices wrote separately, disagreeing with the majority be-\r\ncause they believed that “substantial weight should be accorded the\r\njudge’s finding of probable cause.” Malley, 475 U.

Giving weight to that fact would turn the Fourth\r\nAmendment on its head. This Court made clear in Malley\r\nthat a police officer acting unreasonably cannot obtain\r\nqualified immunity on the basis of a neutral magistrate’s\r\napproval. It would be passing strange, therefore, to im-\r\nmunize an officer’s conduct instead based upon the ap-\r\nproval of other police officers and prosecutors.14 See John-\r\nson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10, 14 (1948) (opinion of\r\nJackson, J.) (“When the right of privacy must reasonably\r\nyield to the right of search is, as a rule, to be decided by a\r\njudicial officer, not by a policeman or government en-\r\nforcement agent”). The effect of the Court’s rule, however,\r\nis to hold blameless the “plainly incompetent” action of the\r\npolice officer seeking a warrant because of the “plainly\r\nincompetent” approval of his superiors and the district\r\nattorney. See ante, at 16–18; see also ante, at 3–4 (opinion\r\nof KAGAN, J.). Under the majority’s test, four wrongs\r\napparently make a right. I cannot agree, however, that\r\nthe “objective legal reasonableness of an official’s acts,”\r\nHarlow, 457 U.

The Court\r\nreaches a contrary result not because it thinks that these\r\npolice officers’ stated reasons for searching were objective-\r\nly reasonable, but because it thinks different conclusions\r\nmight be drawn from the crime scene that reasonably\r\nmight have led different officers to search for different\r\nreasons.
