RYAN, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPART-\n            MENT OF CORRECTIONS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 10–1001. Argued October 4, 2011—Decided March 20, 2012\nArizona prisoners may raise claims of ineffective assistance of trial\n  counsel only in state collateral proceedings, not on direct review. In\n  petitioner Martinez’s first state collateral proceeding, his counsel did\n  not raise such a claim. On federal habeas review with new counsel,\n  Martinez argued that he received ineffective assistance both at trial\n  and in his first state collateral proceeding. He also claimed that he\n  had a constitutional right to an effective attorney in the collateral\n  proceeding because it was the first place to raise his claim of ineffec-\n  tive assistance at trial. The District Court denied the petition, find-\n  ing that Arizona’s preclusion rule was an adequate and independent\n  state-law ground barring federal review, and that under Coleman v.\n  Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, the attorney’s errors in the postconviction\n  proceeding did not qualify as cause to excuse the procedural default.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. Where, under state law, ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel\n claims must be raised in an initial-review collateral proceeding, a\n procedural default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing\n those claims if, in the initial-review collateral proceeding, there was\n no counsel or counsel in that proceeding was ineffective. Pp. 5–14.\n       (a) Given that the precise question here is whether ineffective\n assistance in an initial-review collateral proceeding on an ineffective-\n assistance-at-trial claim may provide cause for a procedural default\n in a federal habeas proceeding, this is not the case to resolve the\n question left open in Coleman: whether a prisoner has a constitution-\n al right to effective counsel in initial-review collateral proceedings.\n However, to protect prisoners with potentially legitimate ineffective-\n2                           MARTINEZ v. RYAN\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    assistance claims, it is necessary to recognize a narrow exception to\n    Coleman’s unqualified statement that an attorney’s ignorance or in-\n    advertence in a postconviction proceeding does not qualify as cause to\n    excuse a procedural default, namely, that inadequate assistance of\n    counsel at initial-review collateral proceedings may establish cause.\n    Pp. 5–6.\n         (b) A federal court can hear Martinez’s ineffective-assistance\n    claim only if he can establish cause to excuse the procedural default\n    and prejudice from a violation of federal law. Coleman held that a\n    postconviction attorney’s negligence “does not qualify as ‘cause,’ ” be-\n    cause “the attorney is the prisoner’s agent,” and “the principal bears\n    the risk of ” his agent’s negligent conduct, Maples v. Thomas, ante, at\n    12. However, in Coleman, counsel’s alleged error was on appeal from\n    an initial-review collateral proceeding. Thus, his claims had been\n    addressed by the state habeas trial court. This marks a key differ-\n    ence between initial-review collateral proceedings and other collat-\n    eral proceedings. Here, where the initial-review collateral proceeding\n    is the first designated proceeding for a prisoner to raise the ineffec-\n    tive-assistance claim, the collateral proceeding is the equivalent of a\n    prisoner’s direct appeal as to that claim because the state habeas\n    court decides the claim’s merits, no other court has addressed the\n    claim, and defendants “are generally ill equipped to represent them-\n    selves” where they have no brief from counsel and no court opinion\n    addressing their claim. Halbert v. Michigan, 545 U. S. 605, 617. An\n    attorney’s errors during an appeal on direct review may provide\n    cause to excuse a procedural default; for if the attorney appointed by\n    the State is ineffective, the prisoner has been denied fair process and\n    the opportunity to comply with the State’s procedures and obtain an\n    adjudication on the merits of his claim. Without adequate represen-\n    tation in an initial-review collateral proceeding, a prisoner will have\n    similar difficulties vindicating a substantial ineffective-assistance-at-\n    trial claim. The same would be true if the State did not appoint an\n    attorney for the initial-review collateral proceeding. A prisoner’s in-\n    ability to present an ineffective-assistance claim is of particular con-\n    cern because the right to effective trial counsel is a bedrock principle\n    in this Nation’s justice system.\n       Allowing a federal habeas court to hear a claim of ineffective assis-\n    tance at trial when an attorney’s errors (or an attorney’s absence)\n    caused a procedural default in an initial-review collateral proceeding\n    acknowledges, as an equitable matter, that a collateral proceeding, if\n    undertaken with no counsel or ineffective counsel, may not have been\n    sufficient to ensure that proper consideration was given to a substan-\n    tial claim. It thus follows that, when a State requires a prisoner to\n    raise a i claim of ineffective assistance at trial in a collateral proceed-\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  ing, a prisoner may establish cause for a procedural default of such\n  claim in two circumstances: where the state courts did not appoint\n  counsel in the initial-review collateral proceeding for an ineffective-\n  assistance-at-trial claim; and where appointed counsel in the initial-\n  review collateral proceeding, where that claim should have been\n  raised, was ineffective under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S.\n  668. To overcome the default, a prisoner must also demonstrate that\n  the underlying ineffective-assistance-at-trial claim is substantial.\n  Most jurisdictions have procedures to ensure counsel is appointed for\n  substantial ineffective-assistance claims. It is likely that such attor-\n  neys are qualified to perform, and do perform, according to prevailing\n  professional norms. And where that is so, States may enforce a pro-\n  cedural default in federal habeas proceedings. Pp. 6–12.\n        (c) This limited qualification to Coleman does not implicate stare\n  decisis concerns. Coleman’s holding remains true except as to initial-\n  review collateral proceedings for claims of ineffective assistance at\n  trial. The holding in this case should not put a significant strain on\n  state resources. A State facing the question of cause for an apparent\n  default may answer that the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel\n  claim is insubstantial. The limited circumstances recognized here al-\n  so reflect the importance of the right to effective assistance at trial.\n  Other claims may not implicate the same fundamentals of the adver-\n  sary system. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n  1996 does not speak to the question presented here, and thus does\n  not bar Martinez from asserting attorney error as cause for a proce-\n  dural default. Pp. 12–14.\n     2. Whether Martinez’s attorney in his first collateral proceeding\n  was ineffective and whether his ineffective-assistance-at-trial claim\n  is substantial, as well as the question of prejudice, are questions that\n  remain open for a decision on remand.

Instead, the prisoner must bring\nthe claim in state collateral proceedings. In the instant\ncase, however, petitioner’s postconviction counsel did not\nraise the ineffective-assistance claim in the first collateral\nproceeding, and, indeed, filed a statement that, after\nreviewing the case, she found no meritorious claims help­\nful to petitioner. On federal habeas review, and with new\ncounsel, petitioner sought to argue he had received ineffec­\ntive assistance of counsel at trial and in the first phase of\nhis state collateral proceeding. Because the state collat­\neral proceeding was the first place to challenge his con-\nviction on grounds of ineffective assistance, petitioner\nmaintained he had a constitutional right to an effective\nattorney in the collateral proceeding. While petitioner\nframes the question in this case as a constitutional one, a\nmore narrow, but still dispositive, formulation is whether\na federal habeas court may excuse a procedural default of\n2                    MARTINEZ v.

The prosecution introduced a videotaped forensic\ninterview with the victim, Martinez’s 11-year-old step­\ndaughter. It also put in evidence the victim’s nightgown,\nwith traces of Martinez’s DNA. As part of his defense,\nMartinez introduced evidence of the victim’s recantations,\nincluding testimony from the victim’s grandmother and\nmother and a second videotaped interview in which the\nvictim denied any abuse. The victim also denied any\nabuse when she testified at trial. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n38a–39a. To explain the inconsistencies, a prosecution\nexpert testified that recantations of child-abuse accusa­\ntions are caused often by reluctance on the part of the\nvictim’s mother to lend support to the child’s claims.

Martinez did not respond.\nHe later alleged that he was unaware of the ongoing col­\nlateral proceedings and that counsel failed to advise him\nof the need to file a pro se petition to preserve his rights.\nThe state trial court dismissed the action for postconvic­\ntion relief, in effect affirming counsel’s determination that\nMartinez had no meritorious claims. 623 F. 3d, at 734.\nThe Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed Martinez’s convic­\ntion, and the Arizona Supreme Court denied review. Id.,\nat 733.\n   About a year and a half later, Martinez, now represent­\ned by new counsel, filed a second notice of postconviction\nrelief in the Arizona trial court. Id., at 734. Martinez\nclaimed his trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to\nchallenge the prosecution’s evidence. He argued, for ex­\nample, that his trial counsel should have objected to the\nexpert testimony explaining the victim’s recantations or\nshould have called an expert witness in rebuttal. Mar­\ntinez also faulted trial counsel for not pursuing an excul­\npatory explanation for the DNA on the nightgown. App. to\nBrief in Opposition B–6 to B–12. Martinez’s petition was\ndismissed, in part in reliance on an Arizona Rule barring\nrelief on a claim that could have been raised in a previous\ncollateral proceeding. Id., at B–27; see Ariz. Rule Crim.\n4                    MARTINEZ v. RYAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nProc. 32.2(a)(3). Martinez, the theory went, should have\nasserted the claims of ineffective assistance of trial coun­\nsel in his first notice for postconviction relief. The Arizona\nCourt of Appeals agreed. It denied Martinez relief be­\ncause he failed to raise his claims in the first collateral\nproceeding. 623 F. 3d, at 734. The Arizona Supreme\nCourt declined to review Martinez’s appeal.\n   Martinez then sought relief in United States District\nCourt for the District of Arizona, where he filed a petition\nfor a writ of habeas corpus, again raising the ineffective­\nassistance-of-trial-counsel claims. Martinez acknowledged\nthe state courts denied his claims by relying on a well­\nestablished state procedural rule, which, under the doc­\ntrine of procedural default, would prohibit a federal court\nfrom reaching the merits of the claims. See, e.g., Wain-\nwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 84–85, 90–91 (1977). He\ncould overcome this hurdle to federal review, Martinez\nargued, because he had cause for the default: His first\npostconviction counsel was ineffective in failing to raise\nany claims in the first notice of postconviction relief and in\nfailing to notify Martinez of her actions. See id., at 84–85.\n   On the Magistrate Judge’s recommendation, the District\nCourt denied the petition, ruling that Arizona’s preclusion\nrule was an adequate and independent state-law ground\nto bar federal review. App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a. Martinez\nhad not shown cause to excuse the procedural default,\nthe District Court reasoned, because under Coleman v.\nThompson, 501 U. S. 722, 753–754 (1991), an attorney’s\nerrors in a postconviction proceeding do not qualify as\ncause for a default. See id., at 754–755.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nThe Court of Appeals relied on general statements in\nColeman that, absent a right to counsel in a collateral\nproceeding, an attorney’s errors in the proceeding do not\nestablish cause for a procedural default. Expanding on\nthe District Court’s opinion, the Court of Appeals, citing\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nColeman, noted the general rule that there is no constitu­\ntional right to counsel in collateral proceedings. 623 F. 3d,\nat 736. The Court of Appeals recognized that Coleman\nreserved ruling on whether there is “an exception” to this\nrule in those cases “where ‘state collateral review is the\nfirst place a prisoner can present a challenge to his convic­\ntion.’ ” 623 F. 3d, at 736 (quoting Coleman, supra, at 755).\nIt concluded, nevertheless, that the controlling cases\nestablished no basis for the exception. Certiorari was\ngranted. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                               II\n   Coleman v. Thompson, supra, left open, and the Court of\nAppeals in this case addressed, a question of constitution­\nal law: whether a prisoner has a right to effective counsel\nin collateral proceedings which provide the first occasion\nto raise a claim of ineffective assistance at trial. These\nproceedings can be called, for purposes of this opinion,\n“initial-review collateral proceedings.” Coleman had sug-\ngested, though without holding, that the Constitution\nmay require States to provide counsel in initial-review\ncollateral proceedings because “in [these] cases . . . state\ncollateral review is the first place a prisoner can present a\nchallenge to his conviction.” Id., at 755. As Coleman\nnoted, this makes the initial-review collateral proceeding a\nprisoner’s “one and only appeal” as to an ineffective­\nassistance claim, id., at 756 (emphasis deleted; internal\nquotation marks omitted), and this may justify an excep­\ntion to the constitutional rule that there is no right to\ncounsel in collateral proceedings. See id., at 755; Douglas\nv. California, 372 U. S. 353, 357 (1963) (holding States\nmust appoint counsel on a prisoner’s first appeal).\n   This is not the case, however, to resolve whether that\nexception exists as a constitutional matter. The pre-\ncise question here is whether ineffective assistance in an\ninitial-review collateral proceeding on a claim of ineffective\n6                    MARTINEZ v. RYAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nassistance at trial may provide cause for a procedural\ndefault in a federal habeas proceeding. To protect prison­\ners with a potentially legitimate claim of ineffective assis­\ntance of trial counsel, it is necessary to modify the unqual­\nified statement in Coleman that an attorney’s ignorance\nor inadvertence in a postconviction proceeding does not\nqualify as cause to excuse a procedural default. This\nopinion qualifies Coleman by recognizing a narrow excep­\ntion: Inadequate assistance of counsel at initial-review\ncollateral proceedings may establish cause for a prisoner’s\nprocedural default of a claim of ineffective assistance at\ntrial.\n                              A\n   Federal habeas courts reviewing the constitutionality of\na state prisoner’s conviction and sentence are guided by\nrules designed to ensure that state-court judgments are\naccorded the finality and respect necessary to preserve the\nintegrity of legal proceedings within our system of federal­\nism. These rules include the doctrine of procedural de­\nfault, under which a federal court will not review the\nmerits of claims, including constitutional claims, that a\nstate court declined to hear because the prisoner failed to\nabide by a state procedural rule. See, e.g., Coleman, su-\npra, at 747–748; Sykes, supra, at 84–85. A state court’s\ninvocation of a procedural rule to deny a prisoner’s claims\nprecludes federal review of the claims if, among other\nrequisites, the state procedural rule is a nonfederal\nground adequate to support the judgment and the rule is\nfirmly established and consistently followed. See, e.g.,\nWalker v. Martin, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 7–\n8); Beard v. Kindler, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at\n7). The doctrine barring procedurally defaulted claims\nfrom being heard is not without exceptions. A prisoner\nmay obtain federal review of a defaulted claim by showing\ncause for the default and prejudice from a violation of\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal law. See Coleman, 501 U. S., at 750. There is no\ndispute that Arizona’s procedural bar on successive peti­\ntions is an independent and adequate state ground. Thus,\na federal court can hear Martinez’s ineffective-assistance\nclaim only if he can establish cause to excuse the proce­\ndural default.\n   Coleman held that “[n]egligence on the part of a prison­\ner’s postconviction attorney does not qualify as ‘cause.’ ”\nMaples v. Thomas, 565 U. S ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n12). Coleman reasoned that “because the attorney is the\nprisoner’s agent . . . under ‘well-settled principles of agen­\ncy law,’ the principal bears the risk of negligent conduct on\nthe part of his agent.” Maples, supra, at ___ (slip op., at\n12).\n   Coleman, however, did not present the occasion to apply\nthis principle to determine whether attorney errors in\ninitial-review collateral proceedings may qualify as cause\nfor a procedural default. The alleged failure of counsel in\nColeman was on appeal from an initial-review collateral\nproceeding, and in that proceeding the prisoner’s claims\nhad been addressed by the state habeas trial court. See\n501 U. S., at 755.\n   As Coleman recognized, this marks a key difference\nbetween initial-review collateral proceedings and other\nkinds of collateral proceedings. When an attorney errs in\ninitial-review collateral proceedings, it is likely that no\nstate court at any level will hear the prisoner’s claim.\nThis Court on direct review of the state proceeding could\nnot consider or adjudicate the claim. See, e.g., Fox Film\nCorp. v. Muller, 296 U. S. 207 (1935); Murdock v. Mem-\nphis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1875); cf. Coleman, supra, at 730–731.\nAnd if counsel’s errors in an initial-review collateral pro­\nceeding do not establish cause to excuse the procedural\ndefault in a federal habeas proceeding, no court will re­\nview the prisoner’s claims.\n   The same is not true when counsel errs in other kinds of\n8                    MARTINEZ v. RYAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npostconviction proceedings. While counsel’s errors in\nthese proceedings preclude any further review of the\nprisoner’s claim, the claim will have been addressed by\none court, whether it be the trial court, the appellate court\non direct review, or the trial court in an initial-review\ncollateral proceeding. See, e.g., Coleman, supra, at 756.\n   Where, as here, the initial-review collateral proceeding\nis the first designated proceeding for a prisoner to raise a\nclaim of ineffective assistance at trial, the collateral pro­\nceeding is in many ways the equivalent of a prisoner’s\ndirect appeal as to the ineffective-assistance claim. This\nis because the state habeas court “looks to the merits of\nthe clai[m]” of ineffective assistance, no other court has\naddressed the claim, and “defendants pursuing first-tier\nreview . . . are generally ill equipped to represent them­\nselves” because they do not have a brief from counsel or an\nopinion of the court addressing their claim of error. Hal-\nbert v. Michigan, 545 U. S. 605, 617 (2005); see Douglas,\n372 U. S., at 357–358.\n   As Coleman recognized, an attorney’s errors during an\nappeal on direct review may provide cause to excuse a\nprocedural default; for if the attorney appointed by the\nState to pursue the direct appeal is ineffective, the prison­\ner has been denied fair process and the opportunity to\ncomply with the State’s procedures and obtain an adjudi­\ncation on the merits of his claims. See 501 U. S., at 754;\nEvitts v. Lucey, 469 U. S. 387, 396 (1985); Douglas, supra,\nat 357–358. Without the help of an adequate attorney,\na prisoner will have similar difficulties vindicating a\nsubstantial ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim.\nClaims of ineffective assistance at trial often require\ninvestigative work and an understanding of trial strategy.\nWhen the issue cannot be raised on direct review, more-\nover, a prisoner asserting an ineffective-assistance-of-trial­\ncounsel claim in an initial-review collateral proceeding\ncannot rely on a court opinion or the prior work of an\n                  Cite as: 566 U.

S., at 619.\nTo present a claim of ineffective assistance at trial in\naccordance with the State’s procedures, then, a prisoner\nlikely needs an effective attorney.\n   The same would be true if the State did not appoint an\nattorney to assist the prisoner in the initial-review collat­\neral proceeding. The prisoner, unlearned in the law, may\nnot comply with the State’s procedural rules or may mis­\napprehend the substantive details of federal constitutional\nlaw. Cf., e.g., id., at 620–621 (describing the educational\nbackground of the prison population). While confined to\nprison, the prisoner is in no position to develop the eviden­\ntiary basis for a claim of ineffective assistance, which often\nturns on evidence outside the trial record.\n   A prisoner’s inability to present a claim of trial error is\nof particular concern when the claim is one of ineffective\nassistance of counsel. The right to the effective assistance\nof counsel at trial is a bedrock principle in our justice\nsystem. It is deemed as an “obvious truth” the idea that\n“any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a\nlawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is\nprovided for him.” Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335,\n344 (1963). Indeed, the right to counsel is the foundation\nfor our adversary system. Defense counsel tests the pros­\necution’s case to ensure that the proceedings serve the\nfunction of adjudicating guilt or innocence, while protect­\ning the rights of the person charged. See, e.g., Powell v.\nAlabama, 287 U. S. 45, 68–69 (1932) (“[The defendant]\nrequires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the\nproceedings against him. Without it, though he be not\nguilty, he faces the danger of conviction because he does\nnot know how to establish his innocence”). Effective trial\ncounsel preserves claims to be considered on appeal, see,\ne.g., Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b), and in federal habeas\nproceedings, Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U. S. 446 (2000).\n   This is not to imply the State acted with any impropri­\n10                   MARTINEZ v. RYAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nety by reserving the claim of ineffective assistance for a\ncollateral proceeding. See Massaro v. United States, 538\nU. S. 500, 505 (2003). Ineffective-assistance claims often\ndepend on evidence outside the trial record. Direct ap­\npeals, without evidentiary hearings, may not be as effec­\ntive as other proceedings for developing the factual basis\nfor the claim. Ibid. Abbreviated deadlines to expand the\nrecord on direct appeal may not allow adequate time for\nan attorney to investigate the ineffective-assistance claim.\nSee Primus, Structural Reform in Criminal Defense, 92\nCornell L. Rev. 679, 689, and n. 57 (2004) (most rules give\nbetween 5 and 30 days from the time of conviction to file a\nrequest to expand the record on appeal). Thus, there are\nsound reasons for deferring consideration of ineffective­\nassistance-of-trial-counsel claims until the collateral­\nreview stage, but this decision is not without consequences\nfor the State’s ability to assert a procedural default in\nlater proceedings. By deliberately choosing to move trial­\nineffectiveness claims outside of the direct-appeal process,\nwhere counsel is constitutionally guaranteed, the State\nsignificantly diminishes prisoners’ ability to file such\nclaims. It is within the context of this state procedural\nframework that counsel’s ineffectiveness in an initial­\nreview collateral proceeding qualifies as cause for a proce­\ndural default.\n   The rules for when a prisoner may establish cause to\nexcuse a procedural default are elaborated in the exercise\nof the Court’s discretion. McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S.\n467, 490 (1991); see also Coleman, supra, at 730–731;\nSykes, 433 U. S., at 83; Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1, 9 (1984);\nFay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 430 (1963), overruled in part\nby Sykes, supra. These rules reflect an equitable judg­\nment that only where a prisoner is impeded or obstructed\nin complying with the State’s established procedures will a\nfederal habeas court excuse the prisoner from the usual\nsanction of default. See, e.g., Strickler v. Greene, 527 U. S.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n263, 289 (1999); Reed, supra, at 16. Allowing a federal\nhabeas court to hear a claim of ineffective assistance of\ntrial counsel when an attorney’s errors (or the absence of\nan attorney) caused a procedural default in an initial­\nreview collateral proceeding acknowledges, as an equitable\nmatter, that the initial-review collateral proceeding, if\nundertaken without counsel or with ineffective counsel,\nmay not have been sufficient to ensure that proper consid­\neration was given to a substantial claim. From this it\nfollows that, when a State requires a prisoner to raise an\nineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim in a collateral\nproceeding, a prisoner may establish cause for a default of\nan ineffective-assistance claim in two circumstances. The\nfirst is where the state courts did not appoint counsel in\nthe initial-review collateral proceeding for a claim of inef­\nfective assistance at trial. The second is where appointed\ncounsel in the initial-review collateral proceeding, where\nthe claim should have been raised, was ineffective under\nthe standards of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668\n(1984). To overcome the default, a prisoner must also\ndemonstrate that the underlying ineffective-assistance-of­\ntrial-counsel claim is a substantial one, which is to say\nthat the prisoner must demonstrate that the claim has\nsome merit. Cf. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322 (2003)\n(describing standards for certificates of appealability to\nissue).\n   Most jurisdictions have in place procedures to ensure\ncounsel is appointed for substantial ineffective-assistance\nclaims. Some States, including Arizona, appoint counsel\nin every first collateral proceeding. See, e.g., Alaska Stat.\n18.85.100(c) (2010); Ariz. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.4(c)(2)\n(2011); Conn. Gen. Stat. §51–296(a) (2011); Me. Rules\nCrim. Proc. 69, 70(c) (2010); N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §7A–\n451(a)(2) (2009); N. J. Ct. Rule 3:22–6(b) (2012); R. I. Gen.\nLaws §10–9.1–5 (Lexis 1997); Tenn. Code Ann. §8–14–205\n(2011). Some States appoint counsel if the claims require\n12                   MARTINEZ v.

It is likely that most of the\nattorneys appointed by the courts are qualified to per-\nform, and do perform, according to prevailing professional\nnorms; and, where that is so, the States may enforce a\nprocedural default in federal habeas proceedings.\n                               B\n  This limited qualification to Coleman does not implicate\nthe usual concerns with upsetting reliance interests pro­\ntected by stare decisis principles. Cf., e.g., Montejo v.\nLouisiana, 556 U. S. 778, 792–793 (2009). Coleman held\nthat an attorney’s negligence in a postconviction proceed­\ning does not establish cause, and this remains true except\nas to initial-review collateral proceedings for claims of\nineffective assistance of counsel at trial. Coleman itself\ndid not involve an occasion when an attorney erred in an\ninitial-review collateral proceeding with respect to a claim\nof ineffective trial counsel; and in the 20 years since Cole-\nman was decided, we have not held Coleman applies in\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncircumstances like this one.\n   The holding here ought not to put a significant strain on\nstate resources. When faced with the question whether\nthere is cause for an apparent default, a State may answer\nthat the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim is in­\nsubstantial, i.e., it does not have any merit or that it is\nwholly without factual support, or that the attorney in the\ninitial-review collateral proceeding did not perform below\nconstitutional standards.\n   This is but one of the differences between a constitu­\ntional ruling and the equitable ruling of this case. A\nconstitutional ruling would provide defendants a free­\nstanding constitutional claim to raise; it would require the\nappointment of counsel in initial-review collateral proceed­\nings; it would impose the same system of appointing coun­\nsel in every State; and it would require a reversal in all\nstate collateral cases on direct review from state courts if\nthe States’ system of appointing counsel did not conform to\nthe constitutional rule. An equitable ruling, by contrast,\npermits States a variety of systems for appointing counsel\nin initial-review collateral proceedings. And it permits a\nState to elect between appointing counsel in initial-review\ncollateral proceedings or not asserting a procedural de­\nfault and raising a defense on the merits in federal habeas\nproceedings. In addition, state collateral cases on direct\nreview from state courts are unaffected by the ruling in\nthis case.\n   The rule of Coleman governs in all but the limited cir­\ncumstances recognized here. The holding in this case does\nnot concern attorney errors in other kinds of proceedings,\nincluding appeals from initial-review collateral proceed­\nings, second or successive collateral proceedings, and\npetitions for discretionary review in a State’s appellate\ncourts. See 501 U. S., at 754; Carrier, 477 U. S., at 488. It\ndoes not extend to attorney errors in any proceeding be­\nyond the first occasion the State allows a prisoner to raise\n14                    MARTINEZ v. RYAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na claim of ineffective assistance at trial, even though that\ninitial-review collateral proceeding may be deficient for\nother reasons.\n   In addition, the limited nature of the qualification to\nColeman adopted here reflects the importance of the right\nto the effective assistance of trial counsel and Arizona’s\ndecision to bar defendants from raising ineffective­\nassistance claims on direct appeal. Our holding here\naddresses only the constitutional claims presented in this\ncase, where the State barred the defendant from raising\nthe claims on direct appeal.\n   Arizona contends that the Antiterrorism and Effective\nDeath Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. §2254,\nbars Martinez from asserting attorney error as cause for\na procedural default. AEDPA refers to attorney error in\ncollateral proceedings, but it does not speak to the ques­\ntion presented in this case. Section 2254(i) provides that\n“the ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during\nFederal or State collateral post-conviction proceedings\nshall not be a ground for relief.” “Cause,” however, is not\nsynonymous with “a ground for relief.” A finding of cause\nand prejudice does not entitle the prisoner to habeas relief.\nIt merely allows a federal court to consider the merits of\na claim that otherwise would have been procedurally de­\nfaulted. In this case, for example, Martinez’s “ground for\nrelief ” is his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim, a\nclaim that AEDPA does not bar. Martinez relies on the\nineffectiveness of his postconviction attorney to excuse his\nfailure to comply with Arizona’s procedural rules, not as\nan independent basis for overturning his conviction. In\nshort, while §2254(i) precludes Martinez from relying on\nthe ineffectiveness of his postconviction attorney as a\n“ground for relief,” it does not stop Martinez from using it\nto establish “cause.” Holland v.

California, 386 U. S. 738 (1967). Martinez\nargued before the federal habeas court that filing the\nAnders brief constituted ineffective assistance. The Court\nof Appeals did not decide whether that was so. Rather, it\nheld that because Martinez did not have a right to an\nattorney in the initial-review collateral proceeding, the\nattorney’s errors in the initial-review collateral proceeding\ncould not establish cause for the failure to comply with the\nState’s rules. Thus, the Court of Appeals did not deter­\nmine whether Martinez’s attorney in his first collateral\nproceeding was ineffective or whether his claim of ineffec­\ntive assistance of trial counsel is substantial.

After all, that\nwould have meant, in a case such as the one before us,\nthat failing to provide assistance of counsel, or providing\nassistance of counsel that falls below the Strickland\nstandard, would constitute cause for excusing procedural\ndefault. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668\n(1984). Instead of taking that radical step, the Court\nholds that, for equitable reasons, in a case such as the one\nbefore us, failing to provide assistance of counsel, or\nproviding assistance of counsel that falls below the Strick-\nland standard, constitutes cause for excusing procedural\ndefault. The result, of course, is precisely the same.\n2                        MARTINEZ v. RYAN\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n  Ah, but perhaps the explanation of why the Court’s\naction today amounts to praiseworthy self-restraint is this:\nIt pronounces this excuse from the usual rule of proce-\ndural default only in initial-review state habeas raising an\nineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim. But it could\nhave limited its invention of a new constitutional right to\ncollateral-review counsel in precisely the same fashion—\nand with precisely the same consequences. Moreover, no\none really believes that the newly announced “equitable”\nrule will remain limited to ineffective-assistance-of-trial-\ncounsel cases. There is not a dime’s worth of difference\nin principle between those cases and many other cases in\nwhich initial state habeas will be the first opportunity for\na particular claim to be raised: claims of “newly discov-\nered” prosecutorial misconduct, for example, see Brady v.\nMaryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), claims based on “newly\ndiscovered” exculpatory evidence or “newly discovered”\nimpeachment of prosecutorial witnesses, and claims as-\nserting ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The\nCourt’s soothing assertion, ante, at 14, that its holding\n“addresses only the constitutional claims presented in this\ncase,” insults the reader’s intelligence.1\n——————\n  1 The Court also seeks to restrict its holding to cases in which the\n\nState has “deliberately cho[sen]” to move the asserted claim “outside of\nthe direct-appeal process,” ante, at 10. That line lacks any principled\nbasis, and will not last. Is there any relevant difference between cases\nin which the State says that certain claims can only be brought on\ncollateral review and cases in which those claims by their nature can\nonly be brought on collateral review, since they do not manifest them-\nselves until the appellate process is complete? Our cases establish that\nto constitute cause for failure to raise an issue on direct review, the\nexcuse must be “an objective factor external to the defense.” See infra,\nat 7. That the factual basis for a claim was not available until the\ncollateral-review stage is no less such a factor than a State’s requiring\nthat a claim be brought on collateral review. See Murray v. Carrier,\n477 U. S. 478, 488 (1986). The Court’s asserted limitation makes sense\nonly if the opinion means that a State has “deliberately chos[en]” to\nmove newly-arisen claims “outside of the direct-appeal process” if it\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

Despite the Court’s suggestion\nto the contrary, see ante, at 13, the rule it adopts calls into\nquestion the common state practice of not appointing\ncounsel in all first collateral proceedings, see ante, at 11–\n12. It does not, to be sure, call into question the lawful-\nness of that practice; only its sanity. For if the prisoner\ngoes through state collateral proceedings without counsel,\nand fails to raise an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel\nclaim which is, because of that failure, defaulted, the\ndefault will not preclude federal habeas review of the\nmerits of that claim. And since ineffective assistance of\ntrial counsel is a monotonously standard claim on federal\nhabeas (has a duly convicted defendant ever been effective-\nly represented?), whoever advises the State would himself\nbe guilty of ineffective assistance if he did not counsel\nthe appointment of state-collateral-review counsel in all\ncases—lest the failure to raise that claim in the state pro-\nceedings be excused and the State be propelled into federal\nhabeas review of the adequacy of trial-court representa-\ntion that occurred many years ago.2 Which is to say that\n——————\nfails to reopen the direct-appeal process in order to entertain such\nclaims. Such a radical change in what we require of the States surely\nought to be prescribed by language clearer than what today’s opinion\ncontains.\n  2 The Court says that to establish cause a prisoner must demonstrate\n\nthat the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim is “substantial,”\nwhich apparently means the claim has at least some merit. See ante, at\n11. The Court does not explain where this substantiality standard\ncomes from, and how it differs from the normal rule that a prisoner\nmust demonstrate actual prejudice to avoid the enforcement of a\nprocedural default, see Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 750\n(1991). But whatever the standard, examination of the adequacy of\n4                          MARTINEZ v. RYAN\n\n                           SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe Court’s pretended avoidance of requiring States to ap-\npoint collateral-review counsel is a sham.3\n  Of course even the appointment of state-collateral-\nreview counsel will not guarantee that the State’s criminal\nproceeding can be concluded without years-long federal\nretrial. Appointment of counsel may, as I have said, avoid\nfederal review of the adequacy of representation that\noccurred years ago, at the original trial. But since, under\ntoday’s opinion, the condition for exclusion of federal\nhabeas is the very same condition that would apply if\nappointment of state-collateral-review counsel were con-\nstitutionally required, it will remain to be determined in\nfederal habeas review whether the state-appointed counsel\nwas effective. Thus, as a consequence of today’s decision\nthe States will always be forced to litigate in federal habe-\nas, for all defaulted ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel\nclaims (and who knows what other claims), either (1) the\nvalidity of the defaulted claim (where collateral-review\ncounsel was not appointed), or (2) the effectiveness of\ncollateral-review counsel (where collateral-review counsel\nwas appointed). The Court notes that many States al-\nready provide for the appointment of counsel in first col-\n——————\nyears-ago representation has been substituted for summary dismissal\nby reason of procedural default.\n  3 The Court also claims, ante, at 13, that its “equitable” ruling, unlike\n\na constitutional ruling, will not require “a reversal in all state collateral\ncases on direct review from state courts” where counsel has not been\nappointed. Surely the Court does not mean to suggest that an un-\nconstitutional failure to appoint counsel on collateral review, like an\nunconstitutional failure to appoint counsel at trial, would require the\nentire conviction to be set aside. That is inconceivable. So either one of\ntwo things would happen: Either the reviewing state court would be\nable to inquire into prejudice (which is an improvement over having the\nfederal habeas court make that inquiry, as the Court’s “equitable”\nsolution requires); or else the appellate state court will remand for a\ncollateral proceeding with counsel (which is, as we have said, just what\nthe Court’s “equitable” ruling effectively requires anyway). So the\nCourt’s “equitable” ruling is no boon to the States.\n                      Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      5\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nlateral challenges—as though this proves that what the\nCourt forces the States to do today is eminently reasona-\nble. But what the Court fails to point out is that current-\nly, when state-appointed counsel does not raise an ineffec-\ntive-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim, that is the end of the\nmatter: The issue has been procedurally defaulted. By\nvirtue of today’s opinion, however, all those cases can (and\nwhere capital punishment is at issue assuredly will) pro-\nceed to federal habeas on the issue of whether state-\nappointed counsel was ineffective in failing to raise the\nineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel issue. That is the\nmeaning of the Court’s (supposedly comforting) statement:\n     “It is likely that most of the attorneys appointed by\n     the courts are qualified to perform, and do perform,\n     according to prevailing professional norms; and, where\n     that is so, the States may enforce a procedural default\n     in federal habeas proceedings.” Ante, at 12 (emphasis\n     added).\nTo be more precise, the Court should have said “where\nthat is so, and where federal habeas courts have finally\nrejected claims that it is not so, the States may enforce a\nprocedural default in federal habeas proceedings.”\n  I cannot possibly imagine the basis for the Court’s confi-\ndence, ante, at 12–13, that all this will not put a signifi-\ncant strain on state resources. The principal escape route\nfrom federal habeas—existence of an “adequate and in-\ndependent state ground”—has been closed.4 Whether\n——————\n  4 See N. King, F. Cheesman, & B. Ostrom, Final Technical Report:\n\nHabeas Litigation in U. S. District Courts 45–49 (2007) (documenting\nthe percentage of habeas petitions that included claims dismissed for\nvarious procedural reasons); Administrative Office of the United States\nCourts, Habeas Corpus Petitions Disposed of Procedurally During the\n12-Month Period Ending September 30, 2011 (reporting that for ap-\npeals in noncapital state-prisoner habeas cases, procedural default\naccounted for the largest percentage of procedural dispositions, with\nthe exception of the denial of a certificate of appealability) (available in\n6                           MARTINEZ v. RYAN\n\n                            SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncounsel appointed for state collateral review raises the\nineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim or not, federal\nhabeas review will proceed. In practical effect, that may\nnot make much difference in noncapital cases (except for\nthe squandering of state taxpayers’ money): The defendant\nwill stay in prison, continuing to serve his sentence, while\nfederal habeas review grinds on. But in capital cases, it will\neffectively reduce the sentence, giving the defendant as\nmany more years to live, beyond the lives of the innocent\nvictims whose life he snuffed out, as the process of federal\nhabeas may consume. I guarantee that an assertion of\nineffective assistance of trial counsel will be made in all\ncapital cases from this date on, causing (because of today’s\nholding) execution of the sentence to be deferred until\neither that claim, or the claim that appointed counsel was\nineffective in failing to make that claim, has worked its\nway through the federal system.\n                              B\n   The Court would have us believe that today’s holding\nis no more than a “limited qualification” to Coleman v.\nThompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991). Ante, at 12. It is much\nmore than that: a repudiation of the longstanding princi-\nple governing procedural default, which Coleman and\nother cases consistently applied. Coleman itself involved a\nhabeas petitioner’s contention that his attorney’s failure to\nfile a timely notice of appeal in his state habeas proceed-\ning, which resulted in procedural default of the claims\nraised in that proceeding, was cause to excuse that default\nin federal habeas. 501 U. S., at 752. The petitioner in\nthat case contended that whether a violation of his consti-\ntutional right to effective counsel had occurred was of no\nconsequence, so long as the attorney’s conduct fell short of\nthe effectiveness standard set forth in Strickland. See 501\n—————— \n\nClerk of Court’s case file). \n\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nU. S., at 753. Whereas Coleman flatly repudiated that\nclaim as being inconsistent with our precedent, see ibid.,\ntoday’s majority wholeheartedly embraces it, ante, at 11.\n   Rejection of the argument in Coleman was compelled by\nour jurisprudence pertaining to cause for excusing proce-\ndural default, and in particular Murray v. Carrier, 477\nU. S. 478 (1986). See Coleman, supra, at 752–753. Car-\nrier involved the failure of a defendant’s attorney to raise a\nclaim on direct appeal. 477 U. S., at 482. This failure did\nnot constitute cause, we explained, because it was not an\n“objective factor external to the defense.” Id., at 488 (em-\nphasis added). This external-factor requirement reflects\nthe judgment that States should not be forced to undergo\nfederal habeas review of a defaulted claim unless a factor\nnot attributable to the prisoner obstructed his compliance\nwith state procedures. See id., at 487–488.\n   Although this externality requirement has been the\nNorth Star of our excuse-for-cause jurisprudence, today’s\nopinion does not whisper its name—no doubt because it is\nimpossible to say that Martinez’s procedural default was\ncaused by a factor external to his defense. Coleman and\nCarrier set forth in clear terms when it is that attorney\nerror constitutes an external factor: Attorney error by it-\nself does not, because when an attorney acts (or fails to\nact) in furtherance of the litigation, he is acting as the\npetitioner’s agent. Coleman, supra, at 753; Carrier, supra,\nat 492. Any other rule would be inconsistent with our\nsystem of representative litigation, under which “each\nparty is deemed bound by the acts of his lawyer-agent.”\nIrwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 92\n(1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). But when\nattorney error amounts to constitutionally ineffective\nassistance of counsel, that error is imputed to the State\n(for the State has failed to comply with the constitutional\nrequirement to provide effective counsel), rendering the\nerror external to the petitioner. Coleman, supra, at 754;\n8                    MARTINEZ v. RYAN\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nCarrier, supra, at 488. Accordingly, as Martinez himself\nappears to recognize, see Brief for Petitioner 22, our cases\nrequire that absent a determination that Arizona violated\nthe Constitution by failing to provide effective counsel,\nattorney error cannot provide cause to excuse his proce-\ndural default. Rather than apply that rule here, the Court\nadopts the very approach Coleman explicitly addressed\nand rejected.\n   The Court essentially disclaims any need to give full\nconsideration to the principle of stare decisis because\nColeman did not involve an initial-review collateral pro-\nceeding for a claim of ineffective assistance of trial coun-\nsel. See ante, at 12. That is rather like saying that Mar-\nbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), does not establish\nour authority to review the constitutionality of a new\nfederal statute because it involved a different enactment.\nJust as the reasoning of Marbury was categorical, so was\nthe reasoning of Coleman and Carrier: Attorney error is\nnot an external factor constituting cause for excusing\ndefault unless the State has a constitutional obligation to\nprovide effective counsel. Had the majority seriously\nconsidered the relevant stare decisis factors, see, e.g.,\nMontejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. 778, 792–793 (2009), it\nwould have had difficulty justifying today’s decision. Nor\ncan it escape the demands of stare decisis by saying that\nour rules regarding the excuse of procedural default reflect\nan “equitable judgment” that is “elaborated in the exercise\nof the Court’s discretion.” Ante, at 10. Equity is not law-\nlessness, and discretion is not license to cast aside estab-\nlished jurisprudence reaffirmed this very Term. See Ma-\nples v. Thomas, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 12)\n(“Negligence on the part of a prisoner’s postconviction\nattorney does not qualify as ‘cause’ ” (quoting Coleman,\nsupra, at 753)). “ ‘[C]ourts of equity must be governed by\nrules and precedents no less than courts of law.’ ” Lonchar\nv. Thomas, 517 U. S. 314, 323 (1996) (quoting Missouri\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                    9\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nv. Jenkins, 515 U. S. 70, 127 (1995) (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring)).\n   Noticeably absent from the Court’s equitable analysis,\nmoreover, is any consideration of the very reason for a\nprocedural-default rule: the comity and respect that fed-\neral courts must accord state-court judgments.             See\nEdwards v. Carpenter, 529 U. S. 446, 451 (2000). The\nprocedural-default doctrine reflects the understanding that\nfederal review of defaulted claims may “circumvent the\njurisdictional limits of direct review and ‘undermine the\nState’s interest in enforcing its laws.’ ” Lee v. Kemna, 534\nU. S. 362, 388 (2002) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (quoting\nColeman, supra, at 731). Unlike today’s decision, Carrier\nand Coleman took account of the significant costs federal\nhabeas review imposes on States, including the “reduction\nin the finality of litigation and the frustration of ‘both the\nStates’ sovereign power to punish offenders and their\ngood-faith attempts to honor constitutional rights.’ ” Car-\nrier, supra, at 487 (quoting Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107,\n128 (1982)). Criminal conviction ought to be final before\nsociety has forgotten the crime that justifies it. When a\ncase arrives at federal habeas, the state conviction and\nsentence at issue (never mind the underlying crime) are\nalready a dim memory, on average more than 6 years old\n(7 years for capital cases).5 I would adhere to the prece-\ndents that prevent a bad situation from becoming worse.\n                             II\n  We granted certiorari on, and the parties addressed\ntheir arguments to, the following question:\n     “Whether a defendant in a state criminal case who is\n\n——————\n  5 See King, Cheesman, & Ostrom, Final Technical Report, at 21–22\n(reporting the average interval between state judgment and federal\nhabeas filing for a sample of federal habeas cases filed in the early-to-\nmid 2000’s).\n10                    MARTINEZ v. RYAN\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n     prohibited by state law from raising on direct appeal\n     any claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, but\n     who has a state-law right to raise such a claim in a\n     first post-conviction proceeding, has a federal consti-\n     tutional right to effective assistance of first post-\n     conviction counsel specifically with respect to his\n     ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim.” Pet. for\n     Cert. i.\nWhile the Court’s decision not to answer the question did\nnot avoid the costs a constitutional holding would have\nimposed on States, it did avoid the Court’s need to con-\nfront the established rule that there is no right to counsel\nin collateral proceedings. To avoid his procedural default,\nMartinez advocates in favor of an exception to this rule\nwhere the prisoner seeks the right to counsel in an initial-\nreview collateral proceeding—an argument we have previ-\nously declined to address. See Coleman, 501 U. S., at 755.\n  The argument is quite clearly foreclosed by our prece-\ndent. In Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551 (1987), and\nMurray v. Giarratano, 492 U. S. 1 (1989), we stated un-\nequivocally that prisoners do not “have a constitutional\nright to counsel when mounting collateral attacks upon\ntheir convictions.” Finley, supra, at 555. See also Giar-\nratano, 492 U. S., at 10 (plurality opinion) (“[T]he rule\nof Pennsylvania v. Finley should apply no differently\nin capital cases than in noncapital cases”); id., at 14\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment) (indicating that\nthe Constitution does not categorically require States to\nprovide counsel to death-row inmates seeking state habeas\nreview). Though Finley may have involved only claims\nthat could have been raised on direct review, see 481 U. S.,\nat 553; Giarratano, supra, at 24 (Stevens, J., dissenting),\nthe Court was no doubt aware that States often limit “the\ncollateral review process [to] issues that have not previ-\nously been litigated or argued on the direct appeal.” Brief\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

And Giarratano, which involved a class action filed\nunder 42 U. S. C. §1983, addressed the general assertion\nthat the Constitution requires the appointment of counsel\nfor collateral attacks on capital convictions. See 492 U. S.,\nat 3–4 (plurality opinion). The Court rejected that asser-\ntion without qualification. The dissenting opinion, more-\nover, made the precise argument Martinez now asserts:\nunder state law “some claims [including ineffective assis-\ntance of trial counsel] ordinarily heard on direct review\nwill be relegated to postconviction proceedings.” Id., at 24\n(Stevens, J., dissenting). See also Brief for Respondents in\nGiarratano, O. T. 1988, No. 88–411, p. 29, n. 8 (“In [Vir-\nginia capital habeas] proceedings, Death Row inmates\nseek to assert claims that have not been, and could not\nhave been addressed on direct appeal . . . ”). Thus, in\nannouncing a categorical rule in Finley, see Giarratano,\nsupra, at 12 (plurality opinion), and then reaffirming it in\nGiarratano, the Court knew full well that a collateral\nproceeding may present the first opportunity for a prison-\ner to raise a constitutional claim. I would follow that rule\nin this case and reject Martinez’s argument that there is a\nconstitutional right to counsel in initial-review collateral\nproceedings.\n                        *     *     *\n  Far from avoiding the consequences a constitutional\nholding would have imposed on the States, today’s holding\nas a practical matter requires States to appoint counsel in\ninitial-review collateral proceedings—and, to boot, elimi-\nnates the pre-existing assurance of escaping federal-\nhabeas review for claims that appointed counsel fails to\npresent. Despite the Court’s protestations to the contrary,\nthe decision is a radical alteration of our habeas jurispru-\ndence that will impose considerable economic costs on the\nStates and further impair their ability to provide justice in\n12                   MARTINEZ v. RYAN\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\na timely fashion. The balance it strikes between the final-\nity of criminal judgments and the need to provide for\nreview of defaulted claims of ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel grossly underestimates both the frequency of such\nclaims in federal habeas, and the incentives to argue\n(since it is a free pass to federal habeas) that appointed\ncounsel was ineffective in failing to raise such claims. The\nbalance might have been close (though it would disregard\nour established jurisprudence) if the Court merely held\nthat uncounseled failure to raise ineffective assistance of\ntrial counsel would not constitute default. But in adding\nto that the rule that counseled failure to raise it may also\nprovide an excuse, the Court creates a monstrosity. For\nthese reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 625711, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2012/03/20/Martinez_v._Ryan.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2011                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued October 4, 2011—Decided March 20, 2012\nArizona prisoners may raise claims of ineffective assistance of trial\n  counsel only in state collateral proceedings, not on direct review. In\n  petitioner Martinez’s first state collateral proceeding, his counsel did\n  not raise such a claim. On federal habeas review with new counsel,\n  Martinez argued that he received ineffective assistance both at trial\n  and in his first state collateral proceeding. He also claimed that he\n  had a constitutional right to an effective attorney in the collateral\n  proceeding because it was the first place to raise his claim of ineffec-\n  tive assistance at trial. The District Court denied the petition, find-\n  ing that Arizona’s preclusion rule was an adequate and independent\n  state-law ground barring federal review, and that under Coleman v.\n  Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, the attorney’s errors in the postconviction\n  proceeding did not qualify as cause to excuse the procedural default.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. Where, under state law, ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel\n claims must be raised in an initial-review collateral proceeding, a\n procedural default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing\n those claims if, in the initial-review collateral proceeding, there was\n no counsel or counsel in that proceeding was ineffective. Pp. 5–14.\n       (a) Given that the precise question here is whether ineffective\n assistance in an initial-review collateral proceeding on an ineffective-\n assistance-at-trial claim may provide cause for a procedural default\n in a federal habeas proceeding, this is not the case to resolve the\n question left open in Coleman: whether a prisoner has a constitution-\n al right to effective counsel in initial-review collateral proceedings.\n However, to protect prisoners with potentially legitimate ineffective-\n2                           MARTINEZ v. RYAN\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    assistance claims, it is necessary to recognize a narrow exception to\n    Coleman’s unqualified statement that an attorney’s ignorance or in-\n    advertence in a postconviction proceeding does not qualify as cause to\n    excuse a procedural default, namely, that inadequate assistance of\n    counsel at initial-review collateral proceedings may establish cause.\n    Pp. 5–6.\n         (b) A federal court can hear Martinez’s ineffective-assistance\n    claim only if he can establish cause to excuse the procedural default\n    and prejudice from a violation of federal law. Coleman held that a\n    postconviction attorney’s negligence “does not qualify as ‘cause,’ ” be-\n    cause “the attorney is the prisoner’s agent,” and “the principal bears\n    the risk of ” his agent’s negligent conduct, Maples v. Thomas, ante, at\n    12. However, in Coleman, counsel’s alleged error was on appeal from\n    an initial-review collateral proceeding. Thus, his claims had been\n    addressed by the state habeas trial court. This marks a key differ-\n    ence between initial-review collateral proceedings and other collat-\n    eral proceedings. Here, where the initial-review collateral proceeding\n    is the first designated proceeding for a prisoner to raise the ineffec-\n    tive-assistance claim, the collateral proceeding is the equivalent of a\n    prisoner’s direct appeal as to that claim because the state habeas\n    court decides the claim’s merits, no other court has addressed the\n    claim, and defendants “are generally ill equipped to represent them-\n    selves” where they have no brief from counsel and no court opinion\n    addressing their claim. Halbert v. Michigan, 545 U. S. 605, 617. An\n    attorney’s errors during an appeal on direct review may provide\n    cause to excuse a procedural default; for if the attorney appointed by\n    the State is ineffective, the prisoner has been denied fair process and\n    the opportunity to comply with the State’s procedures and obtain an\n    adjudication on the merits of his claim. Without adequate represen-\n    tation in an initial-review collateral proceeding, a prisoner will have\n    similar difficulties vindicating a substantial ineffective-assistance-at-\n    trial claim. The same would be true if the State did not appoint an\n    attorney for the initial-review collateral proceeding. A prisoner’s in-\n    ability to present an ineffective-assistance claim is of particular con-\n    cern because the right to effective trial counsel is a bedrock principle\n    in this Nation’s justice system.\n       Allowing a federal habeas court to hear a claim of ineffective assis-\n    tance at trial when an attorney’s errors (or an attorney’s absence)\n    caused a procedural default in an initial-review collateral proceeding\n    acknowledges, as an equitable matter, that a collateral proceeding, if\n    undertaken with no counsel or ineffective counsel, may not have been\n    sufficient to ensure that proper consideration was given to a substan-\n    tial claim. It thus follows that, when a State requires a prisoner to\n    raise a i claim of ineffective assistance at trial in a collateral proceed-\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  ing, a prisoner may establish cause for a procedural default of such\n  claim in two circumstances: where the state courts did not appoint\n  counsel in the initial-review collateral proceeding for an ineffective-\n  assistance-at-trial claim; and where appointed counsel in the initial-\n  review collateral proceeding, where that claim should have been\n  raised, was ineffective under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S.\n  668. To overcome the default, a prisoner must also demonstrate that\n  the underlying ineffective-assistance-at-trial claim is substantial.\n  Most jurisdictions have procedures to ensure counsel is appointed for\n  substantial ineffective-assistance claims. It is likely that such attor-\n  neys are qualified to perform, and do perform, according to prevailing\n  professional norms. And where that is so, States may enforce a pro-\n  cedural default in federal habeas proceedings. Pp. 6–12.\n        (c) This limited qualification to Coleman does not implicate stare\n  decisis concerns. Coleman’s holding remains true except as to initial-\n  review collateral proceedings for claims of ineffective assistance at\n  trial. The holding in this case should not put a significant strain on\n  state resources. A State facing the question of cause for an apparent\n  default may answer that the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel\n  claim is insubstantial. The limited circumstances recognized here al-\n  so reflect the importance of the right to effective assistance at trial.\n  Other claims may not implicate the same fundamentals of the adver-\n  sary system. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n  1996 does not speak to the question presented here, and thus does\n  not bar Martinez from asserting attorney error as cause for a proce-\n  dural default. Pp. 12–14.\n     2. Whether Martinez’s attorney in his first collateral proceeding\n  was ineffective and whether his ineffective-assistance-at-trial claim\n  is substantial, as well as the question of prejudice, are questions that\n  remain open for a decision on remand.

Instead, the prisoner must bring\nthe claim in state collateral proceedings. In the instant\ncase, however, petitioner’s postconviction counsel did not\nraise the ineffective-assistance claim in the first collateral\nproceeding, and, indeed, filed a statement that, after\nreviewing the case, she found no meritorious claims help­\nful to petitioner. On federal habeas review, and with new\ncounsel, petitioner sought to argue he had received ineffec­\ntive assistance of counsel at trial and in the first phase of\nhis state collateral proceeding. Because the state collat­\neral proceeding was the first place to challenge his con-\nviction on grounds of ineffective assistance, petitioner\nmaintained he had a constitutional right to an effective\nattorney in the collateral proceeding. While petitioner\nframes the question in this case as a constitutional one, a\nmore narrow, but still dispositive, formulation is whether\na federal habeas court may excuse a procedural default of\n2                    MARTINEZ v.

To explain the inconsistencies, a prosecution\nexpert testified that recantations of child-abuse accusa­\ntions are caused often by reluctance on the part of the\nvictim’s mother to lend support to the child’s claims.

Schriro, 623 F. 3d\n731, 733–734 (CA9 2010); Ariz. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.4(a)\n(2011). Despite initiating this proceeding, counsel made\nno claim trial counsel was ineffective and later filed a\nstatement asserting she could find no colorable claims at\nall. 623 F. 3d, at 734. Cf. State v. Smith, 184 Ariz. 456,\n459, 910 P. 2d 1, 4 (1996).\n   The state trial court hearing the collateral proceeding\ngave Martinez 45 days to file a pro se petition in support of\npostconviction relief and to raise any claims he believed\nhis counsel overlooked. 623 F. 3d, at 734; see Smith,\nsupra, at 459, 910 P. 2d, at 4. Martinez did not respond.\nHe later alleged that he was unaware of the ongoing col­\nlateral proceedings and that counsel failed to advise him\nof the need to file a pro se petition to preserve his rights.\nThe state trial court dismissed the action for postconvic­\ntion relief, in effect affirming counsel’s determination that\nMartinez had no meritorious claims. 623 F. 3d, at 734.\nThe Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed Martinez’s convic­\ntion, and the Arizona Supreme Court denied review. Id.,\nat 733.\n   About a year and a half later, Martinez, now represent­\ned by new counsel, filed a second notice of postconviction\nrelief in the Arizona trial court. Id., at 734. Martinez\nclaimed his trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to\nchallenge the prosecution’s evidence. He argued, for ex­\nample, that his trial counsel should have objected to the\nexpert testimony explaining the victim’s recantations or\nshould have called an expert witness in rebuttal. Mar­\ntinez also faulted trial counsel for not pursuing an excul­\npatory explanation for the DNA on the nightgown. App. to\nBrief in Opposition B–6 to B–12. Martinez’s petition was\ndismissed, in part in reliance on an Arizona Rule barring\nrelief on a claim that could have been raised in a previous\ncollateral proceeding. Id., at B–27; see Ariz. Rule Crim.\n4                    MARTINEZ v. RYAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nProc. 32.2(a)(3). Martinez, the theory went, should have\nasserted the claims of ineffective assistance of trial coun­\nsel in his first notice for postconviction relief. The Arizona\nCourt of Appeals agreed. It denied Martinez relief be­\ncause he failed to raise his claims in the first collateral\nproceeding. 623 F. 3d, at 734. The Arizona Supreme\nCourt declined to review Martinez’s appeal.\n   Martinez then sought relief in United States District\nCourt for the District of Arizona, where he filed a petition\nfor a writ of habeas corpus, again raising the ineffective­\nassistance-of-trial-counsel claims. Martinez acknowledged\nthe state courts denied his claims by relying on a well­\nestablished state procedural rule, which, under the doc­\ntrine of procedural default, would prohibit a federal court\nfrom reaching the merits of the claims. See, e.g., Wain-\nwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 84–85, 90–91 (1977). He\ncould overcome this hurdle to federal review, Martinez\nargued, because he had cause for the default: His first\npostconviction counsel was ineffective in failing to raise\nany claims in the first notice of postconviction relief and in\nfailing to notify Martinez of her actions. See id., at 84–85.\n   On the Magistrate Judge’s recommendation, the District\nCourt denied the petition, ruling that Arizona’s preclusion\nrule was an adequate and independent state-law ground\nto bar federal review. App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a. Martinez\nhad not shown cause to excuse the procedural default,\nthe District Court reasoned, because under Coleman v.\nThompson, 501 U. S. 722, 753–754 (1991), an attorney’s\nerrors in a postconviction proceeding do not qualify as\ncause for a default. See id., at 754–755.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nThe Court of Appeals relied on general statements in\nColeman that, absent a right to counsel in a collateral\nproceeding, an attorney’s errors in the proceeding do not\nestablish cause for a procedural default. Expanding on\nthe District Court’s opinion, the Court of Appeals, citing\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nColeman, noted the general rule that there is no constitu­\ntional right to counsel in collateral proceedings. 623 F. 3d,\nat 736. The Court of Appeals recognized that Coleman\nreserved ruling on whether there is “an exception” to this\nrule in those cases “where ‘state collateral review is the\nfirst place a prisoner can present a challenge to his convic­\ntion.’ ” 623 F. 3d, at 736 (quoting Coleman, supra, at 755).\nIt concluded, nevertheless, that the controlling cases\nestablished no basis for the exception. Certiorari was\ngranted. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                               II\n   Coleman v. Thompson, supra, left open, and the Court of\nAppeals in this case addressed, a question of constitution­\nal law: whether a prisoner has a right to effective counsel\nin collateral proceedings which provide the first occasion\nto raise a claim of ineffective assistance at trial. These\nproceedings can be called, for purposes of this opinion,\n“initial-review collateral proceedings.” Coleman had sug-\ngested, though without holding, that the Constitution\nmay require States to provide counsel in initial-review\ncollateral proceedings because “in [these] cases . . . state\ncollateral review is the first place a prisoner can present a\nchallenge to his conviction.” Id., at 755. As Coleman\nnoted, this makes the initial-review collateral proceeding a\nprisoner’s “one and only appeal” as to an ineffective­\nassistance claim, id., at 756 (emphasis deleted; internal\nquotation marks omitted), and this may justify an excep­\ntion to the constitutional rule that there is no right to\ncounsel in collateral proceedings. See id., at 755; Douglas\nv. California, 372 U. S. 353, 357 (1963) (holding States\nmust appoint counsel on a prisoner’s first appeal).\n   This is not the case, however, to resolve whether that\nexception exists as a constitutional matter. The pre-\ncise question here is whether ineffective assistance in an\ninitial-review collateral proceeding on a claim of ineffective\n6                    MARTINEZ v. RYAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nassistance at trial may provide cause for a procedural\ndefault in a federal habeas proceeding. To protect prison­\ners with a potentially legitimate claim of ineffective assis­\ntance of trial counsel, it is necessary to modify the unqual­\nified statement in Coleman that an attorney’s ignorance\nor inadvertence in a postconviction proceeding does not\nqualify as cause to excuse a procedural default. This\nopinion qualifies Coleman by recognizing a narrow excep­\ntion: Inadequate assistance of counsel at initial-review\ncollateral proceedings may establish cause for a prisoner’s\nprocedural default of a claim of ineffective assistance at\ntrial.\n                              A\n   Federal habeas courts reviewing the constitutionality of\na state prisoner’s conviction and sentence are guided by\nrules designed to ensure that state-court judgments are\naccorded the finality and respect necessary to preserve the\nintegrity of legal proceedings within our system of federal­\nism. These rules include the doctrine of procedural de­\nfault, under which a federal court will not review the\nmerits of claims, including constitutional claims, that a\nstate court declined to hear because the prisoner failed to\nabide by a state procedural rule. See, e.g., Coleman, su-\npra, at 747–748; Sykes, supra, at 84–85. A state court’s\ninvocation of a procedural rule to deny a prisoner’s claims\nprecludes federal review of the claims if, among other\nrequisites, the state procedural rule is a nonfederal\nground adequate to support the judgment and the rule is\nfirmly established and consistently followed. See, e.g.,\nWalker v. Martin, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 7–\n8); Beard v. Kindler, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at\n7). The doctrine barring procedurally defaulted claims\nfrom being heard is not without exceptions. A prisoner\nmay obtain federal review of a defaulted claim by showing\ncause for the default and prejudice from a violation of\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal law. See Coleman, 501 U. S., at 750. There is no\ndispute that Arizona’s procedural bar on successive peti­\ntions is an independent and adequate state ground. Thus,\na federal court can hear Martinez’s ineffective-assistance\nclaim only if he can establish cause to excuse the proce­\ndural default.\n   Coleman held that “[n]egligence on the part of a prison­\ner’s postconviction attorney does not qualify as ‘cause.’ ”\nMaples v. Thomas, 565 U. S ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n12). Coleman reasoned that “because the attorney is the\nprisoner’s agent . . . under ‘well-settled principles of agen­\ncy law,’ the principal bears the risk of negligent conduct on\nthe part of his agent.” Maples, supra, at ___ (slip op., at\n12).\n   Coleman, however, did not present the occasion to apply\nthis principle to determine whether attorney errors in\ninitial-review collateral proceedings may qualify as cause\nfor a procedural default. The alleged failure of counsel in\nColeman was on appeal from an initial-review collateral\nproceeding, and in that proceeding the prisoner’s claims\nhad been addressed by the state habeas trial court. See\n501 U. S., at 755.\n   As Coleman recognized, this marks a key difference\nbetween initial-review collateral proceedings and other\nkinds of collateral proceedings. When an attorney errs in\ninitial-review collateral proceedings, it is likely that no\nstate court at any level will hear the prisoner’s claim.\nThis Court on direct review of the state proceeding could\nnot consider or adjudicate the claim. See, e.g., Fox Film\nCorp. v. Muller, 296 U. S. 207 (1935); Murdock v. Mem-\nphis, 20 Wall. 590 (1875); cf. Coleman, supra, at 730–731.\nAnd if counsel’s errors in an initial-review collateral pro­\nceeding do not establish cause to excuse the procedural\ndefault in a federal habeas proceeding, no court will re­\nview the prisoner’s claims.\n   The same is not true when counsel errs in other kinds of\n8                    MARTINEZ v. RYAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npostconviction proceedings. While counsel’s errors in\nthese proceedings preclude any further review of the\nprisoner’s claim, the claim will have been addressed by\none court, whether it be the trial court, the appellate court\non direct review, or the trial court in an initial-review\ncollateral proceeding. See, e.g., Coleman, supra, at 756.\n   Where, as here, the initial-review collateral proceeding\nis the first designated proceeding for a prisoner to raise a\nclaim of ineffective assistance at trial, the collateral pro­\nceeding is in many ways the equivalent of a prisoner’s\ndirect appeal as to the ineffective-assistance claim. This\nis because the state habeas court “looks to the merits of\nthe clai[m]” of ineffective assistance, no other court has\naddressed the claim, and “defendants pursuing first-tier\nreview . . . are generally ill equipped to represent them­\nselves” because they do not have a brief from counsel or an\nopinion of the court addressing their claim of error. Hal-\nbert v. Michigan, 545 U. S. 605, 617 (2005); see Douglas,\n372 U. S., at 357–358.\n   As Coleman recognized, an attorney’s errors during an\nappeal on direct review may provide cause to excuse a\nprocedural default; for if the attorney appointed by the\nState to pursue the direct appeal is ineffective, the prison­\ner has been denied fair process and the opportunity to\ncomply with the State’s procedures and obtain an adjudi­\ncation on the merits of his claims. See 501 U. S., at 754;\nEvitts v. Lucey, 469 U. S. 387, 396 (1985); Douglas, supra,\nat 357–358. Without the help of an adequate attorney,\na prisoner will have similar difficulties vindicating a\nsubstantial ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim.\nClaims of ineffective assistance at trial often require\ninvestigative work and an understanding of trial strategy.\nWhen the issue cannot be raised on direct review, more-\nover, a prisoner asserting an ineffective-assistance-of-trial­\ncounsel claim in an initial-review collateral proceeding\ncannot rely on a court opinion or the prior work of an\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nattorney addressing that claim. Halbert, 545 U. S., at 619.\nTo present a claim of ineffective assistance at trial in\naccordance with the State’s procedures, then, a prisoner\nlikely needs an effective attorney.\n   The same would be true if the State did not appoint an\nattorney to assist the prisoner in the initial-review collat­\neral proceeding. The prisoner, unlearned in the law, may\nnot comply with the State’s procedural rules or may mis­\napprehend the substantive details of federal constitutional\nlaw. Cf., e.g., id., at 620–621 (describing the educational\nbackground of the prison population). While confined to\nprison, the prisoner is in no position to develop the eviden­\ntiary basis for a claim of ineffective assistance, which often\nturns on evidence outside the trial record.\n   A prisoner’s inability to present a claim of trial error is\nof particular concern when the claim is one of ineffective\nassistance of counsel. The right to the effective assistance\nof counsel at trial is a bedrock principle in our justice\nsystem. It is deemed as an “obvious truth” the idea that\n“any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a\nlawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is\nprovided for him.” Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335,\n344 (1963). Indeed, the right to counsel is the foundation\nfor our adversary system. Defense counsel tests the pros­\necution’s case to ensure that the proceedings serve the\nfunction of adjudicating guilt or innocence, while protect­\ning the rights of the person charged. See, e.g., Powell v.\nAlabama, 287 U. S. 45, 68–69 (1932) (“[The defendant]\nrequires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the\nproceedings against him. Without it, though he be not\nguilty, he faces the danger of conviction because he does\nnot know how to establish his innocence”). Effective trial\ncounsel preserves claims to be considered on appeal, see,\ne.g., Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b), and in federal habeas\nproceedings, Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U. S. 446 (2000).\n   This is not to imply the State acted with any impropri­\n10                   MARTINEZ v. RYAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nety by reserving the claim of ineffective assistance for a\ncollateral proceeding. See Massaro v. United States, 538\nU. S. 500, 505 (2003). Ineffective-assistance claims often\ndepend on evidence outside the trial record. Direct ap­\npeals, without evidentiary hearings, may not be as effec­\ntive as other proceedings for developing the factual basis\nfor the claim. Ibid. Abbreviated deadlines to expand the\nrecord on direct appeal may not allow adequate time for\nan attorney to investigate the ineffective-assistance claim.\nSee Primus, Structural Reform in Criminal Defense, 92\nCornell L. Rev. 679, 689, and n. 57 (2004) (most rules give\nbetween 5 and 30 days from the time of conviction to file a\nrequest to expand the record on appeal). Thus, there are\nsound reasons for deferring consideration of ineffective­\nassistance-of-trial-counsel claims until the collateral­\nreview stage, but this decision is not without consequences\nfor the State’s ability to assert a procedural default in\nlater proceedings. By deliberately choosing to move trial­\nineffectiveness claims outside of the direct-appeal process,\nwhere counsel is constitutionally guaranteed, the State\nsignificantly diminishes prisoners’ ability to file such\nclaims. It is within the context of this state procedural\nframework that counsel’s ineffectiveness in an initial­\nreview collateral proceeding qualifies as cause for a proce­\ndural default.\n   The rules for when a prisoner may establish cause to\nexcuse a procedural default are elaborated in the exercise\nof the Court’s discretion. McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S.\n467, 490 (1991); see also Coleman, supra, at 730–731;\nSykes, 433 U. S., at 83; Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1, 9 (1984);\nFay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 430 (1963), overruled in part\nby Sykes, supra. These rules reflect an equitable judg­\nment that only where a prisoner is impeded or obstructed\nin complying with the State’s established procedures will a\nfederal habeas court excuse the prisoner from the usual\nsanction of default. See, e.g., Strickler v. Greene, 527 U. S.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n263, 289 (1999); Reed, supra, at 16. Allowing a federal\nhabeas court to hear a claim of ineffective assistance of\ntrial counsel when an attorney’s errors (or the absence of\nan attorney) caused a procedural default in an initial­\nreview collateral proceeding acknowledges, as an equitable\nmatter, that the initial-review collateral proceeding, if\nundertaken without counsel or with ineffective counsel,\nmay not have been sufficient to ensure that proper consid­\neration was given to a substantial claim. From this it\nfollows that, when a State requires a prisoner to raise an\nineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim in a collateral\nproceeding, a prisoner may establish cause for a default of\nan ineffective-assistance claim in two circumstances. The\nfirst is where the state courts did not appoint counsel in\nthe initial-review collateral proceeding for a claim of inef­\nfective assistance at trial. The second is where appointed\ncounsel in the initial-review collateral proceeding, where\nthe claim should have been raised, was ineffective under\nthe standards of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668\n(1984). To overcome the default, a prisoner must also\ndemonstrate that the underlying ineffective-assistance-of­\ntrial-counsel claim is a substantial one, which is to say\nthat the prisoner must demonstrate that the claim has\nsome merit. Cf. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322 (2003)\n(describing standards for certificates of appealability to\nissue).\n   Most jurisdictions have in place procedures to ensure\ncounsel is appointed for substantial ineffective-assistance\nclaims. Some States, including Arizona, appoint counsel\nin every first collateral proceeding. See, e.g., Alaska Stat.\n18.85.100(c) (2010); Ariz. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.4(c)(2)\n(2011); Conn. Gen. Stat. §51–296(a) (2011); Me. Rules\nCrim. Proc. 69, 70(c) (2010); N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §7A–\n451(a)(2) (2009); N. J. Ct. Rule 3:22–6(b) (2012); R. I. Gen.\nLaws §10–9.1–5 (Lexis 1997); Tenn. Code Ann. §8–14–205\n(2011). Some States appoint counsel if the claims require\n12                   MARTINEZ v. RYAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nan evidentiary hearing, as claims of ineffective assistance\noften do. See, e.g., Ky. Rule Crim. Proc. 11.42(5) (2011);\nLa. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 930.7(C) (West 2008);\nMich. Rule Crim. Proc. 6.505(A) (2011); S. C. Rule Civ.\nProc. 71.1(d) (2011). Other States appoint counsel if the\nclaims have some merit to them or the state habeas trial\ncourt deems the record worthy of further development.\nSee, e.g., Ark. Rule Crim. Proc. 37.3(b) (2011); Colo. Rule\nCrim. Proc. 35(b) (2011); Del. Super. Ct. Rule Crim. Proc.\n61(e)(1) (2011); Indiana Rule Post-Conviction Remedies\nProc. 1, §9(a) (rev. 2011); Kan. Stat. Ann. §22–4506 (2007);\nN. M. Dist. Ct. Rule Crim. Proc. 5–802 (2011); Hust v.\nState, 147 Idaho 682, 683–684, 214 P. 3d 668, 669–670\n(2009); Hardin v. Arkansas, 350 Ark. 299, 301, 86 S. W. 3d\n384, 385 (2007) (per curiam); Jensen v. State, 2004 ND\n200, ¶13, 688 N. W. 2d 374, 378; Wu v. United States, 798\nA. 2d 1083, 1089 (D. C. 2002); Kostal v. People, 167 Colo.\n317, 447 P. 2d 536 (1968). It is likely that most of the\nattorneys appointed by the courts are qualified to per-\nform, and do perform, according to prevailing professional\nnorms; and, where that is so, the States may enforce a\nprocedural default in federal habeas proceedings.\n                               B\n  This limited qualification to Coleman does not implicate\nthe usual concerns with upsetting reliance interests pro­\ntected by stare decisis principles. Cf., e.g., Montejo v.\nLouisiana, 556 U. S. 778, 792–793 (2009). Coleman held\nthat an attorney’s negligence in a postconviction proceed­\ning does not establish cause, and this remains true except\nas to initial-review collateral proceedings for claims of\nineffective assistance of counsel at trial. Coleman itself\ndid not involve an occasion when an attorney erred in an\ninitial-review collateral proceeding with respect to a claim\nof ineffective trial counsel; and in the 20 years since Cole-\nman was decided, we have not held Coleman applies in\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncircumstances like this one.\n   The holding here ought not to put a significant strain on\nstate resources. When faced with the question whether\nthere is cause for an apparent default, a State may answer\nthat the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim is in­\nsubstantial, i.e., it does not have any merit or that it is\nwholly without factual support, or that the attorney in the\ninitial-review collateral proceeding did not perform below\nconstitutional standards.\n   This is but one of the differences between a constitu­\ntional ruling and the equitable ruling of this case. A\nconstitutional ruling would provide defendants a free­\nstanding constitutional claim to raise; it would require the\nappointment of counsel in initial-review collateral proceed­\nings; it would impose the same system of appointing coun­\nsel in every State; and it would require a reversal in all\nstate collateral cases on direct review from state courts if\nthe States’ system of appointing counsel did not conform to\nthe constitutional rule. An equitable ruling, by contrast,\npermits States a variety of systems for appointing counsel\nin initial-review collateral proceedings. And it permits a\nState to elect between appointing counsel in initial-review\ncollateral proceedings or not asserting a procedural de­\nfault and raising a defense on the merits in federal habeas\nproceedings. In addition, state collateral cases on direct\nreview from state courts are unaffected by the ruling in\nthis case.\n   The rule of Coleman governs in all but the limited cir­\ncumstances recognized here. The holding in this case does\nnot concern attorney errors in other kinds of proceedings,\nincluding appeals from initial-review collateral proceed­\nings, second or successive collateral proceedings, and\npetitions for discretionary review in a State’s appellate\ncourts. See 501 U. S., at 754; Carrier, 477 U. S., at 488. It\ndoes not extend to attorney errors in any proceeding be­\nyond the first occasion the State allows a prisoner to raise\n14                    MARTINEZ v. RYAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na claim of ineffective assistance at trial, even though that\ninitial-review collateral proceeding may be deficient for\nother reasons.\n   In addition, the limited nature of the qualification to\nColeman adopted here reflects the importance of the right\nto the effective assistance of trial counsel and Arizona’s\ndecision to bar defendants from raising ineffective­\nassistance claims on direct appeal. Our holding here\naddresses only the constitutional claims presented in this\ncase, where the State barred the defendant from raising\nthe claims on direct appeal.\n   Arizona contends that the Antiterrorism and Effective\nDeath Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. §2254,\nbars Martinez from asserting attorney error as cause for\na procedural default. AEDPA refers to attorney error in\ncollateral proceedings, but it does not speak to the ques­\ntion presented in this case. Section 2254(i) provides that\n“the ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during\nFederal or State collateral post-conviction proceedings\nshall not be a ground for relief.” “Cause,” however, is not\nsynonymous with “a ground for relief.” A finding of cause\nand prejudice does not entitle the prisoner to habeas relief.\nIt merely allows a federal court to consider the merits of\na claim that otherwise would have been procedurally de­\nfaulted. In this case, for example, Martinez’s “ground for\nrelief ” is his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim, a\nclaim that AEDPA does not bar. Martinez relies on the\nineffectiveness of his postconviction attorney to excuse his\nfailure to comply with Arizona’s procedural rules, not as\nan independent basis for overturning his conviction. In\nshort, while §2254(i) precludes Martinez from relying on\nthe ineffectiveness of his postconviction attorney as a\n“ground for relief,” it does not stop Martinez from using it\nto establish “cause.” Holland v.

California, 386 U. S. 738 (1967). Martinez\nargued before the federal habeas court that filing the\nAnders brief constituted ineffective assistance. The Court\nof Appeals did not decide whether that was so. Rather, it\nheld that because Martinez did not have a right to an\nattorney in the initial-review collateral proceeding, the\nattorney’s errors in the initial-review collateral proceeding\ncould not establish cause for the failure to comply with the\nState’s rules. Thus, the Court of Appeals did not deter­\nmine whether Martinez’s attorney in his first collateral\nproceeding was ineffective or whether his claim of ineffec­\ntive assistance of trial counsel is substantial.

After all, that\nwould have meant, in a case such as the one before us,\nthat failing to provide assistance of counsel, or providing\nassistance of counsel that falls below the Strickland\nstandard, would constitute cause for excusing procedural\ndefault. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668\n(1984). Instead of taking that radical step, the Court\nholds that, for equitable reasons, in a case such as the one\nbefore us, failing to provide assistance of counsel, or\nproviding assistance of counsel that falls below the Strick-\nland standard, constitutes cause for excusing procedural\ndefault. The result, of course, is precisely the same.\n2                        MARTINEZ v. RYAN\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n  Ah, but perhaps the explanation of why the Court’s\naction today amounts to praiseworthy self-restraint is this:\nIt pronounces this excuse from the usual rule of proce-\ndural default only in initial-review state habeas raising an\nineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim. But it could\nhave limited its invention of a new constitutional right to\ncollateral-review counsel in precisely the same fashion—\nand with precisely the same consequences. Moreover, no\none really believes that the newly announced “equitable”\nrule will remain limited to ineffective-assistance-of-trial-\ncounsel cases. There is not a dime’s worth of difference\nin principle between those cases and many other cases in\nwhich initial state habeas will be the first opportunity for\na particular claim to be raised: claims of “newly discov-\nered” prosecutorial misconduct, for example, see Brady v.\nMaryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), claims based on “newly\ndiscovered” exculpatory evidence or “newly discovered”\nimpeachment of prosecutorial witnesses, and claims as-\nserting ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The\nCourt’s soothing assertion, ante, at 14, that its holding\n“addresses only the constitutional claims presented in this\ncase,” insults the reader’s intelligence.1\n——————\n  1 The Court also seeks to restrict its holding to cases in which the\n\nState has “deliberately cho[sen]” to move the asserted claim “outside of\nthe direct-appeal process,” ante, at 10. That line lacks any principled\nbasis, and will not last. Is there any relevant difference between cases\nin which the State says that certain claims can only be brought on\ncollateral review and cases in which those claims by their nature can\nonly be brought on collateral review, since they do not manifest them-\nselves until the appellate process is complete? Our cases establish that\nto constitute cause for failure to raise an issue on direct review, the\nexcuse must be “an objective factor external to the defense.” See infra,\nat 7. That the factual basis for a claim was not available until the\ncollateral-review stage is no less such a factor than a State’s requiring\nthat a claim be brought on collateral review. See Murray v. Carrier,\n477 U. S. 478, 488 (1986). The Court’s asserted limitation makes sense\nonly if the opinion means that a State has “deliberately chos[en]” to\nmove newly-arisen claims “outside of the direct-appeal process” if it\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

Despite the Court’s suggestion\nto the contrary, see ante, at 13, the rule it adopts calls into\nquestion the common state practice of not appointing\ncounsel in all first collateral proceedings, see ante, at 11–\n12. It does not, to be sure, call into question the lawful-\nness of that practice; only its sanity. For if the prisoner\ngoes through state collateral proceedings without counsel,\nand fails to raise an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel\nclaim which is, because of that failure, defaulted, the\ndefault will not preclude federal habeas review of the\nmerits of that claim. And since ineffective assistance of\ntrial counsel is a monotonously standard claim on federal\nhabeas (has a duly convicted defendant ever been effective-\nly represented?), whoever advises the State would himself\nbe guilty of ineffective assistance if he did not counsel\nthe appointment of state-collateral-review counsel in all\ncases—lest the failure to raise that claim in the state pro-\nceedings be excused and the State be propelled into federal\nhabeas review of the adequacy of trial-court representa-\ntion that occurred many years ago.2 Which is to say that\n——————\nfails to reopen the direct-appeal process in order to entertain such\nclaims. Such a radical change in what we require of the States surely\nought to be prescribed by language clearer than what today’s opinion\ncontains.\n  2 The Court says that to establish cause a prisoner must demonstrate\n\nthat the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim is “substantial,”\nwhich apparently means the claim has at least some merit. See ante, at\n11. The Court does not explain where this substantiality standard\ncomes from, and how it differs from the normal rule that a prisoner\nmust demonstrate actual prejudice to avoid the enforcement of a\nprocedural default, see Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 750\n(1991). But whatever the standard, examination of the adequacy of\n4                          MARTINEZ v. RYAN\n\n                           SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe Court’s pretended avoidance of requiring States to ap-\npoint collateral-review counsel is a sham.3\n  Of course even the appointment of state-collateral-\nreview counsel will not guarantee that the State’s criminal\nproceeding can be concluded without years-long federal\nretrial. Appointment of counsel may, as I have said, avoid\nfederal review of the adequacy of representation that\noccurred years ago, at the original trial. But since, under\ntoday’s opinion, the condition for exclusion of federal\nhabeas is the very same condition that would apply if\nappointment of state-collateral-review counsel were con-\nstitutionally required, it will remain to be determined in\nfederal habeas review whether the state-appointed counsel\nwas effective. Thus, as a consequence of today’s decision\nthe States will always be forced to litigate in federal habe-\nas, for all defaulted ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel\nclaims (and who knows what other claims), either (1) the\nvalidity of the defaulted claim (where collateral-review\ncounsel was not appointed), or (2) the effectiveness of\ncollateral-review counsel (where collateral-review counsel\nwas appointed). The Court notes that many States al-\nready provide for the appointment of counsel in first col-\n——————\nyears-ago representation has been substituted for summary dismissal\nby reason of procedural default.\n  3 The Court also claims, ante, at 13, that its “equitable” ruling, unlike\n\na constitutional ruling, will not require “a reversal in all state collateral\ncases on direct review from state courts” where counsel has not been\nappointed. Surely the Court does not mean to suggest that an un-\nconstitutional failure to appoint counsel on collateral review, like an\nunconstitutional failure to appoint counsel at trial, would require the\nentire conviction to be set aside. That is inconceivable. So either one of\ntwo things would happen: Either the reviewing state court would be\nable to inquire into prejudice (which is an improvement over having the\nfederal habeas court make that inquiry, as the Court’s “equitable”\nsolution requires); or else the appellate state court will remand for a\ncollateral proceeding with counsel (which is, as we have said, just what\nthe Court’s “equitable” ruling effectively requires anyway). So the\nCourt’s “equitable” ruling is no boon to the States.\n                      Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      5\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nlateral challenges—as though this proves that what the\nCourt forces the States to do today is eminently reasona-\nble. But what the Court fails to point out is that current-\nly, when state-appointed counsel does not raise an ineffec-\ntive-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim, that is the end of the\nmatter: The issue has been procedurally defaulted. By\nvirtue of today’s opinion, however, all those cases can (and\nwhere capital punishment is at issue assuredly will) pro-\nceed to federal habeas on the issue of whether state-\nappointed counsel was ineffective in failing to raise the\nineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel issue. That is the\nmeaning of the Court’s (supposedly comforting) statement:\n     “It is likely that most of the attorneys appointed by\n     the courts are qualified to perform, and do perform,\n     according to prevailing professional norms; and, where\n     that is so, the States may enforce a procedural default\n     in federal habeas proceedings.” Ante, at 12 (emphasis\n     added).\nTo be more precise, the Court should have said “where\nthat is so, and where federal habeas courts have finally\nrejected claims that it is not so, the States may enforce a\nprocedural default in federal habeas proceedings.”\n  I cannot possibly imagine the basis for the Court’s confi-\ndence, ante, at 12–13, that all this will not put a signifi-\ncant strain on state resources. The principal escape route\nfrom federal habeas—existence of an “adequate and in-\ndependent state ground”—has been closed.4 Whether\n——————\n  4 See N. King, F. Cheesman, & B. Ostrom, Final Technical Report:\n\nHabeas Litigation in U. S. District Courts 45–49 (2007) (documenting\nthe percentage of habeas petitions that included claims dismissed for\nvarious procedural reasons); Administrative Office of the United States\nCourts, Habeas Corpus Petitions Disposed of Procedurally During the\n12-Month Period Ending September 30, 2011 (reporting that for ap-\npeals in noncapital state-prisoner habeas cases, procedural default\naccounted for the largest percentage of procedural dispositions, with\nthe exception of the denial of a certificate of appealability) (available in\n6                           MARTINEZ v. RYAN\n\n                            SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncounsel appointed for state collateral review raises the\nineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim or not, federal\nhabeas review will proceed. In practical effect, that may\nnot make much difference in noncapital cases (except for\nthe squandering of state taxpayers’ money): The defendant\nwill stay in prison, continuing to serve his sentence, while\nfederal habeas review grinds on. But in capital cases, it will\neffectively reduce the sentence, giving the defendant as\nmany more years to live, beyond the lives of the innocent\nvictims whose life he snuffed out, as the process of federal\nhabeas may consume. I guarantee that an assertion of\nineffective assistance of trial counsel will be made in all\ncapital cases from this date on, causing (because of today’s\nholding) execution of the sentence to be deferred until\neither that claim, or the claim that appointed counsel was\nineffective in failing to make that claim, has worked its\nway through the federal system.\n                              B\n   The Court would have us believe that today’s holding\nis no more than a “limited qualification” to Coleman v.\nThompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991). Ante, at 12. It is much\nmore than that: a repudiation of the longstanding princi-\nple governing procedural default, which Coleman and\nother cases consistently applied. Coleman itself involved a\nhabeas petitioner’s contention that his attorney’s failure to\nfile a timely notice of appeal in his state habeas proceed-\ning, which resulted in procedural default of the claims\nraised in that proceeding, was cause to excuse that default\nin federal habeas. 501 U. S., at 752. The petitioner in\nthat case contended that whether a violation of his consti-\ntutional right to effective counsel had occurred was of no\nconsequence, so long as the attorney’s conduct fell short of\nthe effectiveness standard set forth in Strickland. See 501\n—————— \n\nClerk of Court’s case file). \n\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nU. S., at 753. Whereas Coleman flatly repudiated that\nclaim as being inconsistent with our precedent, see ibid.,\ntoday’s majority wholeheartedly embraces it, ante, at 11.\n   Rejection of the argument in Coleman was compelled by\nour jurisprudence pertaining to cause for excusing proce-\ndural default, and in particular Murray v. Carrier, 477\nU. S. 478 (1986). See Coleman, supra, at 752–753. Car-\nrier involved the failure of a defendant’s attorney to raise a\nclaim on direct appeal. 477 U. S., at 482. This failure did\nnot constitute cause, we explained, because it was not an\n“objective factor external to the defense.” Id., at 488 (em-\nphasis added). This external-factor requirement reflects\nthe judgment that States should not be forced to undergo\nfederal habeas review of a defaulted claim unless a factor\nnot attributable to the prisoner obstructed his compliance\nwith state procedures. See id., at 487–488.\n   Although this externality requirement has been the\nNorth Star of our excuse-for-cause jurisprudence, today’s\nopinion does not whisper its name—no doubt because it is\nimpossible to say that Martinez’s procedural default was\ncaused by a factor external to his defense. Coleman and\nCarrier set forth in clear terms when it is that attorney\nerror constitutes an external factor: Attorney error by it-\nself does not, because when an attorney acts (or fails to\nact) in furtherance of the litigation, he is acting as the\npetitioner’s agent. Coleman, supra, at 753; Carrier, supra,\nat 492. Any other rule would be inconsistent with our\nsystem of representative litigation, under which “each\nparty is deemed bound by the acts of his lawyer-agent.”\nIrwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 92\n(1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). But when\nattorney error amounts to constitutionally ineffective\nassistance of counsel, that error is imputed to the State\n(for the State has failed to comply with the constitutional\nrequirement to provide effective counsel), rendering the\nerror external to the petitioner. Coleman, supra, at 754;\n8                    MARTINEZ v. RYAN\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nCarrier, supra, at 488. Accordingly, as Martinez himself\nappears to recognize, see Brief for Petitioner 22, our cases\nrequire that absent a determination that Arizona violated\nthe Constitution by failing to provide effective counsel,\nattorney error cannot provide cause to excuse his proce-\ndural default. Rather than apply that rule here, the Court\nadopts the very approach Coleman explicitly addressed\nand rejected.\n   The Court essentially disclaims any need to give full\nconsideration to the principle of stare decisis because\nColeman did not involve an initial-review collateral pro-\nceeding for a claim of ineffective assistance of trial coun-\nsel. See ante, at 12. That is rather like saying that Mar-\nbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), does not establish\nour authority to review the constitutionality of a new\nfederal statute because it involved a different enactment.\nJust as the reasoning of Marbury was categorical, so was\nthe reasoning of Coleman and Carrier: Attorney error is\nnot an external factor constituting cause for excusing\ndefault unless the State has a constitutional obligation to\nprovide effective counsel. Had the majority seriously\nconsidered the relevant stare decisis factors, see, e.g.,\nMontejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. 778, 792–793 (2009), it\nwould have had difficulty justifying today’s decision. Nor\ncan it escape the demands of stare decisis by saying that\nour rules regarding the excuse of procedural default reflect\nan “equitable judgment” that is “elaborated in the exercise\nof the Court’s discretion.” Ante, at 10. Equity is not law-\nlessness, and discretion is not license to cast aside estab-\nlished jurisprudence reaffirmed this very Term. See Ma-\nples v. Thomas, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 12)\n(“Negligence on the part of a prisoner’s postconviction\nattorney does not qualify as ‘cause’ ” (quoting Coleman,\nsupra, at 753)). “ ‘[C]ourts of equity must be governed by\nrules and precedents no less than courts of law.’ ” Lonchar\nv.

S. 70, 127 (1995) (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring)).\n   Noticeably absent from the Court’s equitable analysis,\nmoreover, is any consideration of the very reason for a\nprocedural-default rule: the comity and respect that fed-\neral courts must accord state-court judgments.             See\nEdwards v. Carpenter, 529 U. S. 446, 451 (2000). The\nprocedural-default doctrine reflects the understanding that\nfederal review of defaulted claims may “circumvent the\njurisdictional limits of direct review and ‘undermine the\nState’s interest in enforcing its laws.’ ” Lee v. Kemna, 534\nU. S. 362, 388 (2002) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (quoting\nColeman, supra, at 731). Unlike today’s decision, Carrier\nand Coleman took account of the significant costs federal\nhabeas review imposes on States, including the “reduction\nin the finality of litigation and the frustration of ‘both the\nStates’ sovereign power to punish offenders and their\ngood-faith attempts to honor constitutional rights.’ ” Car-\nrier, supra, at 487 (quoting Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107,\n128 (1982)). Criminal conviction ought to be final before\nsociety has forgotten the crime that justifies it. When a\ncase arrives at federal habeas, the state conviction and\nsentence at issue (never mind the underlying crime) are\nalready a dim memory, on average more than 6 years old\n(7 years for capital cases).5 I would adhere to the prece-\ndents that prevent a bad situation from becoming worse.\n                             II\n  We granted certiorari on, and the parties addressed\ntheir arguments to, the following question:\n     “Whether a defendant in a state criminal case who is\n\n——————\n  5 See King, Cheesman, & Ostrom, Final Technical Report, at 21–22\n(reporting the average interval between state judgment and federal\nhabeas filing for a sample of federal habeas cases filed in the early-to-\nmid 2000’s).\n10                    MARTINEZ v.

To avoid his procedural default,\nMartinez advocates in favor of an exception to this rule\nwhere the prisoner seeks the right to counsel in an initial-\nreview collateral proceeding—an argument we have previ-\nously declined to address. See Coleman, 501 U. S., at 755.\n  The argument is quite clearly foreclosed by our prece-\ndent. In Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551 (1987), and\nMurray v. Giarratano, 492 U. S. 1 (1989), we stated un-\nequivocally that prisoners do not “have a constitutional\nright to counsel when mounting collateral attacks upon\ntheir convictions.” Finley, supra, at 555. See also Giar-\nratano, 492 U. S., at 10 (plurality opinion) (“[T]he rule\nof Pennsylvania v. Finley should apply no differently\nin capital cases than in noncapital cases”); id., at 14\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment) (indicating that\nthe Constitution does not categorically require States to\nprovide counsel to death-row inmates seeking state habeas\nreview). Though Finley may have involved only claims\nthat could have been raised on direct review, see 481 U. S.,\nat 553; Giarratano, supra, at 24 (Stevens, J., dissenting),\nthe Court was no doubt aware that States often limit “the\ncollateral review process [to] issues that have not previ-\nously been litigated or argued on the direct appeal.” Brief\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

And Giarratano, which involved a class action filed\nunder 42 U. S. C. §1983, addressed the general assertion\nthat the Constitution requires the appointment of counsel\nfor collateral attacks on capital convictions. See 492 U. S.,\nat 3–4 (plurality opinion). The Court rejected that asser-\ntion without qualification. The dissenting opinion, more-\nover, made the precise argument Martinez now asserts:\nunder state law “some claims [including ineffective assis-\ntance of trial counsel] ordinarily heard on direct review\nwill be relegated to postconviction proceedings.” Id., at 24\n(Stevens, J., dissenting). See also Brief for Respondents in\nGiarratano, O. T. 1988, No. 88–411, p. 29, n. 8 (“In [Vir-\nginia capital habeas] proceedings, Death Row inmates\nseek to assert claims that have not been, and could not\nhave been addressed on direct appeal . . . ”). Thus, in\nannouncing a categorical rule in Finley, see Giarratano,\nsupra, at 12 (plurality opinion), and then reaffirming it in\nGiarratano, the Court knew full well that a collateral\nproceeding may present the first opportunity for a prison-\ner to raise a constitutional claim. I would follow that rule\nin this case and reject Martinez’s argument that there is a\nconstitutional right to counsel in initial-review collateral\nproceedings.\n                        *     *     *\n  Far from avoiding the consequences a constitutional\nholding would have imposed on the States, today’s holding\nas a practical matter requires States to appoint counsel in\ninitial-review collateral proceedings—and, to boot, elimi-\nnates the pre-existing assurance of escaping federal-\nhabeas review for claims that appointed counsel fails to\npresent. Despite the Court’s protestations to the contrary,\nthe decision is a radical alteration of our habeas jurispru-\ndence that will impose considerable economic costs on the\nStates and further impair their ability to provide justice in\n12                   MARTINEZ v. RYAN\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\na timely fashion. The balance it strikes between the final-\nity of criminal judgments and the need to provide for\nreview of defaulted claims of ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel grossly underestimates both the frequency of such\nclaims in federal habeas, and the incentives to argue\n(since it is a free pass to federal habeas) that appointed\ncounsel was ineffective in failing to raise such claims. The\nbalance might have been close (though it would disregard\nour established jurisprudence) if the Court merely held\nthat uncounseled failure to raise ineffective assistance of\ntrial counsel would not constitute default. But in adding\nto that the rule that counseled failure to raise it may also\nprovide an excuse, the Court creates a monstrosity.
