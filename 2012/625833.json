COOPER\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 10–209.      Argued October 31, 2011—Decided March 21, 2012\nRespondent was charged under Michigan law with assault with intent\n  to murder and three other offenses. The prosecution offered to dis­\n  miss two of the charges and to recommend a 51-to-85-month sentence\n  on the other two, in exchange for a guilty plea. In a communication\n  with the court, respondent admitted his guilt and expressed a will­\n  ingness to accept the offer. But he rejected the offer, allegedly after\n  his attorney convinced him that the prosecution would be unable to\n  establish intent to murder because the victim had been shot below\n  the waist. At trial, respondent was convicted on all counts and re­\n  ceived a mandatory minimum 185-to-360-month sentence. In a sub­\n  sequent hearing, the state trial court rejected respondent’s claim that\n  his attorney’s advice to reject the plea constituted ineffective assis­\n  tance. The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting the ineffec­\n  tive-assistance claim on the ground that respondent knowingly and\n  intelligently turned down the plea offer and chose to go to trial. Re­\n  spondent renewed his claim in federal habeas. Finding that the state\n  appellate court had unreasonably applied the constitutional effective­\n  assistance standards laid out in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S.\n  668, and Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, the District Court granted a\n  conditional writ and ordered specific performance of the original plea\n  offer. The Sixth Circuit affirmed. Applying Strickland, it found that\n  counsel had provided deficient performance by advising respondent of\n  an incorrect legal rule, and that respondent suffered prejudice be­\n  cause he lost the opportunity to take the more favorable sentence of­\n  fered in the plea.\nHeld:\n    1. Where counsel’s ineffective advice led to an offer’s rejection, and\n where the prejudice alleged is having to stand trial, a defendant must\n2                           LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    show that but for the ineffective advice, there is a reasonable proba­\n    bility that the plea offer would have been presented to the court, that\n    the court would have accepted its terms, and that the conviction or\n    sentence, or both, under the offer’s terms would have been less severe\n    than under the actual judgment and sentence imposed. Pp. 3–11.\n         (a) Because the parties agree that counsel’s performance was de­\n    ficient, the only question is how to apply Strickland’s prejudice test\n    where ineffective assistance results in a rejection of the plea offer and\n    the defendant is convicted at the ensuing trial. Pp. 3–4.\n         (b) In that context, the Strickland prejudice test requires a de­\n    fendant to show a reasonable possibility that the outcome of the plea\n    process would have been different with competent advice. The Sixth\n    Circuit and other federal appellate courts have agreed with the\n    Strickland prejudice test for rejected pleas adopted here by this\n    Court. Petitioner and the Solicitor General propose a narrow view—\n    that Strickland prejudice cannot arise from plea bargaining if the de­\n    fendant is later convicted at a fair trial—but their reasoning is un­\n    persuasive. First, they claim that the Sixth Amendment’s sole pur­\n    pose is to protect the right to a fair trial, but the Amendment actually\n    requires effective assistance at critical stages of a criminal proceed­\n    ing, including pretrial stages. This is consistent with the right to ef­\n    fective assistance on appeal, see, e.g., Halbert v. Michigan, 545 U. S.\n    605, and the right to counsel during sentencing, see, e.g., Glover v.\n    United States, 531 U. S. 198, 203–204. This Court has not followed a\n    rigid rule that an otherwise fair trial remedies errors not occurring at\n    trial, but has instead inquired whether the trial cured the particular\n    error at issue. See, e.g., Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 263. Se­\n    cond, this Court has previously rejected petitioner’s argument that\n    Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U. S. 364, modified Strickland and does so\n    again here. Fretwell and Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U. S. 157, demon­\n    strate that “it would be unjust to characterize the likelihood of a dif­\n    ferent outcome as legitimate ‘prejudice,’ ” Williams v. Taylor, 529\n    U. S. 362, 391–392, where defendants would receive a windfall as a\n    result of the application of an incorrect legal principle or a defense\n    strategy outside the law. Here, however, respondent seeks relief\n    from counsel’s failure to meet a valid legal standard. Third, petition­\n    er seeks to preserve the conviction by arguing that the Sixth\n    Amendment’s purpose is to ensure a conviction’s reliability, but this\n    argument fails to comprehend the full scope of the Sixth Amendment\n    and is refuted by precedent. Here, the question is the fairness or re­\n    liability not of the trial but of the processes that preceded it, which\n    caused respondent to lose benefits he would have received but for\n    counsel’s ineffective assistance. Furthermore, a reliable trial may not\n    foreclose relief when counsel has failed to assert rights that may have\n                   Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\naltered the outcome. See Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U. S. 365,\n379. Petitioner’s position that a fair trial wipes clean ineffective as­\nsistance during plea bargaining also ignores the reality that criminal\njustice today is for the most part a system of pleas, not a system of\ntrials. See Missouri v. Frye, ante, at ___. Pp. 4–11.\n   2. Where a defendant shows ineffective assistance has caused the\nrejection of a plea leading to a more severe sentence at trial, the rem­\nedy must “neutralize the taint” of a constitutional violation, United\nStates v. Morrison, 449 U. S. 361, 365, but must not grant a windfall\nto the defendant or needlessly squander the resources the State\nproperly invested in the criminal prosecution, see United States v.\nMechanik, 475 U. S. 66, 72. If the sole advantage is that the defend­\nant would have received a lesser sentence under the plea, the court\nshould have an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the de­\nfendant would have accepted the plea. If so, the court may exercise\ndiscretion in determining whether the defendant should receive the\nterm offered in the plea, the sentence received at trial, or something\nin between. However, resentencing based on the conviction at trial\nmay not suffice, e.g., where the offered guilty plea was for less serious\ncounts than the ones for which a defendant was convicted after trial,\nor where a mandatory sentence confines a judge’s sentencing discre­\ntion. In these circumstances, the proper remedy may be to require\nthe prosecution to reoffer the plea. The judge can then exercise dis­\ncretion in deciding whether to vacate the conviction from trial and\naccept the plea, or leave the conviction undisturbed. In either situa­\ntion, a court must weigh various factors. Here, it suffices to give two\nrelevant considerations. First, a court may take account of a defend­\nant’s earlier expressed willingness, or unwillingness, to accept re­\nsponsibility for his or her actions. Second, it is not necessary here to\ndecide as a constitutional rule that a judge is required to disregard\nany information concerning the crime discovered after the plea offer\nwas made. Petitioner argues that implementing a remedy will open\nthe floodgates to litigation by defendants seeking to unsettle their\nconvictions, but in the 30 years that courts have recognized such\nclaims, there has been no indication that the system is overwhelmed\nor that defendants are receiving windfalls as a result of strategically\ntimed Strickland claims. In addition, the prosecution and trial courts\nmay adopt measures to help ensure against meritless claims. See\nFrye, ante, at ___. Pp. 11–14.\n   3. This case arises under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), but because the Michigan Court of Ap­\npeals’ analysis of respondent’s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim\nwas contrary to clearly established federal law, AEDPA presents no\nbar to relief. Respondent has satisfied Strickland’s two-part test.\n4                           LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    The parties concede the fact of deficient performance. And respond­\n    ent has shown that but for that performance there is a reasonable\n    probability he and the trial court would have accepted the guilty plea.\n    In addition, as a result of not accepting the plea and being convicted\n    at trial, he received a minimum sentence 3½ times greater than he\n    would have received under the plea. As a remedy, the District Court\n    ordered specific performance of the plea agreement, but the correct\n    remedy is to order the State to reoffer the plea. If respondent accepts\n    the offer, the state trial court can exercise its discretion in determin­\n    ing whether to vacate respondent’s convictions and resentence pur­\n    suant to the plea agreement, to vacate only some of the convictions\n    and resentence accordingly, or to leave the conviction and sentence\n    resulting from the trial undisturbed.

ANTHONY COOPER\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 21, 2012]\n\n\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  In this case, as in Missouri v. Frye, ante, p. ___, also\ndecided today, a criminal defendant seeks a remedy when\ninadequate assistance of counsel caused nonacceptance of\na plea offer and further proceedings led to a less favorable\noutcome. In Frye, defense counsel did not inform the\ndefendant of the plea offer; and after the offer lapsed the\ndefendant still pleaded guilty, but on more severe terms.\nHere, the favorable plea offer was reported to the client\nbut, on advice of counsel, was rejected. In Frye there was\na later guilty plea. Here, after the plea offer had been\nrejected, there was a full and fair trial before a jury. After\na guilty verdict, the defendant received a sentence harsher\nthan that offered in the rejected plea bargain. The instant\ncase comes to the Court with the concession that counsel’s\nadvice with respect to the plea offer fell below the stand­\nard of adequate assistance of counsel guaranteed by the\nSixth Amendment, applicable to the States through the\nFourteenth Amendment.\n                           I\n  On the evening of March 25, 2003, respondent pointed a\ngun toward Kali Mundy’s head and fired. From the rec­\n2                    LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nord, it is unclear why respondent did this, and at trial it\nwas suggested that he might have acted either in self­\ndefense or in defense of another person. In any event the\nshot missed and Mundy fled. Respondent followed in pur-\nsuit, firing repeatedly. Mundy was shot in her buttock,\nhip, and abdomen but survived the assault.\n   Respondent was charged under Michigan law with as-\nsault with intent to murder, possession of a firearm by a\nfelon, possession of a firearm in the commission of a fel-\nony, misdemeanor possession of marijuana, and for being a\nhabitual offender. On two occasions, the prosecution\noffered to dismiss two of the charges and to recommend a\nsentence of 51 to 85 months for the other two, in exchange\nfor a guilty plea. In a communication with the court re­\nspondent admitted guilt and expressed a willingness to\naccept the offer. Respondent, however, later rejected the\noffer on both occasions, allegedly after his attorney con­\nvinced him that the prosecution would be unable to estab­\nlish his intent to murder Mundy because she had been\nshot below the waist. On the first day of trial the prosecu­\ntion offered a significantly less favorable plea deal, which\nrespondent again rejected. After trial, respondent was\nconvicted on all counts and received a mandatory mini­\nmum sentence of 185 to 360 months’ imprisonment.\n   In a so-called Ginther hearing before the state trial\ncourt, see People v.

Washington,\n466 U. S. 668 (1984), and Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52\n(1985), the District Court granted a conditional writ.\nCooper v.

Appx. 563 (2010), finding “[e]ven full\ndeference under AEDPA cannot salvage the state court’s\ndecision,” id., at 569. Applying Strickland, the Court of\nAppeals found that respondent’s attorney had provided\ndeficient performance by informing respondent of “an\nincorrect legal rule,” 376 Fed. Appx., at 570–571, and that\nrespondent suffered prejudice because he “lost out on an\nopportunity to plead guilty and receive the lower sentence\nthat was offered to him.” Id., at 573. This Court granted\ncertiorari. 562 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n  Defendants have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel,\na right that extends to the plea-bargaining process. Frye,\nante, at 8; see also Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___\n(2010) (slip op., at 16); Hill, supra, at 57. During plea\nnegotiations defendants are “entitled to the effective assis­\n4                     LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\ntance of competent counsel.” McMann v. Richardson, 397\nU. S. 759, 771 (1970). In Hill, the Court held “the two­\npart Strickland v. Washington test applies to challenges to\nguilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel.”\n474 U. S., at 58. The performance prong of Strickland\nrequires a defendant to show “ ‘that counsel’s representa­\ntion fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.’ ”\n474 U. S., at 57 (quoting Strickland, 466 U. S., at 688). In\nthis case all parties agree the performance of respondent’s\ncounsel was deficient when he advised respondent to reject\nthe plea offer on the grounds he could not be convicted at\ntrial. In light of this concession, it is unnecessary for this\nCourt to explore the issue.\n   The question for this Court is how to apply Strickland’s\nprejudice test where ineffective assistance results in a re-\njection of the plea offer and the defendant is convicted at\nthe ensuing trial.\n                               B\n   To establish Strickland prejudice a defendant must\n“show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for\ncounsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceed­\ning would have been different.” Id., at 694. In the context\nof pleas a defendant must show the outcome of the plea\nprocess would have been different with competent advice.\nSee Frye, ante, at 12 (noting that Strickland’s inquiry, as\napplied to advice with respect to plea bargains, turns on\n“whether ‘the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent’ ” (quoting Strickland, supra, at 694)); see also\nHill, 474 U. S., at 59 (“The . . . ‘prejudice,’ requirement . . .\nfocuses on whether counsel’s constitutionally ineffective\nperformance affected the outcome of the plea process”). In\nHill, when evaluating the petitioner’s claim that ineffec­\ntive assistance led to the improvident acceptance of a\nguilty plea, the Court required the petitioner to show “that\nthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nerrors, [the defendant] would not have pleaded guilty and\nwould have insisted on going to trial.” Ibid.\n   In contrast to Hill, here the ineffective advice led not to\nan offer’s acceptance but to its rejection. Having to stand\ntrial, not choosing to waive it, is the prejudice alleged. In\nthese circumstances a defendant must show that but for\nthe ineffective advice of counsel there is a reasonable prob-\nability that the plea offer would have been presented\nto the court (i.e., that the defendant would have accepted\nthe plea and the prosecution would not have withdrawn it\nin light of intervening circumstances), that the court\nwould have accepted its terms, and that the conviction or\nsentence, or both, under the offer’s terms would have been\nless severe than under the judgment and sentence that in\nfact were imposed. Here, the Court of Appeals for the\nSixth Circuit agreed with that test for Strickland preju­\ndice in the context of a rejected plea bargain. This is\nconsistent with the test adopted and applied by other\nappellate courts without demonstrated difficulties or\nsystemic disruptions. See 376 Fed. Appx., at 571–573; see\nalso, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez Rodriguez, 929 F. 2d\n747, 753, n. 1 (CA1 1991) (per curiam); United States v.\nGordon, 156 F. 3d 376, 380–381 (CA2 1998) (per curiam);\nUnited States v.

They\ncontend there can be no finding of Strickland prejudice\narising from plea bargaining if the defendant is later\nconvicted at a fair trial. The three reasons petitioner and\n6                     LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Solicitor General offer for their approach are unper­\nsuasive.\n   First, petitioner and the Solicitor General claim that\nthe sole purpose of the Sixth Amendment is to protect the\nright to a fair trial. Errors before trial, they argue, are not\ncognizable under the Sixth Amendment unless they affect\nthe fairness of the trial itself. See Brief for Petitioner 12–\n21; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 10–12. The\nSixth Amendment, however, is not so narrow in its reach.\nCf. Frye, ante, at 11 (holding that a defendant can show\nprejudice under Strickland even absent a showing that the\ndeficient performance precluded him from going to trial).\nThe Sixth Amendment requires effective assistance of\ncounsel at critical stages of a criminal proceeding. Its\nprotections are not designed simply to protect the trial,\neven though “counsel’s absence [in these stages] may\nderogate from the accused’s right to a fair trial.” United\nStates v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 226 (1967). The constitu­\ntional guarantee applies to pretrial critical stages that are\npart of the whole course of a criminal proceeding, a pro­\nceeding in which defendants cannot be presumed to make\ncritical decisions without counsel’s advice. This is con­\nsistent, too, with the rule that defendants have a right to\neffective assistance of counsel on appeal, even though that\ncannot in any way be characterized as part of the trial.\nSee, e.g., Halbert v. Michigan, 545 U. S. 605 (2005); Evitts\nv. Lucey, 469 U. S. 387 (1985). The precedents also estab­\nlish that there exists a right to counsel during sentencing\nin both noncapital, see Glover v. United States, 531 U. S.\n198, 203–204 (2001); Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U. S. 128\n(1967), and capital cases, see Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S.\n510, 538 (2003). Even though sentencing does not concern\nthe defendant’s guilt or innocence, ineffective assistance of\ncounsel during a sentencing hearing can result in Strick-\nland prejudice because “any amount of [additional] jail\ntime has Sixth Amendment significance.” Glover, supra,\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat 203.\n   The Court, moreover, has not followed a rigid rule that\nan otherwise fair trial remedies errors not occurring at the\ntrial itself. It has inquired instead whether the trial cured\nthe particular error at issue. Thus, in Vasquez v. Hillery,\n474 U. S. 254 (1986), the deliberate exclusion of all\nAfrican-Americans from a grand jury was prejudicial be-\ncause a defendant may have been tried on charges that\nwould not have been brought at all by a properly constituted\ngrand jury. Id., at 263; see Ballard v. United States, 329\nU. S. 187, 195 (1946) (dismissing an indictment returned\nby a grand jury from which women were excluded); see\nalso Stirone v. United States, 361 U. S. 212, 218–219\n(1960) (reversing a defendant’s conviction because the jury\nmay have based its verdict on acts not charged in the\nindictment). By contrast, in United States v. Mechanik,\n475 U. S. 66 (1986), the complained-of error was a viola­\ntion of a grand jury rule meant to ensure probable cause\nexisted to believe a defendant was guilty. A subsequent\ntrial, resulting in a verdict of guilt, cured this error. See\nid., at 72–73.\n   In the instant case respondent went to trial rather than\naccept a plea deal, and it is conceded this was the result of\nineffective assistance during the plea negotiation process.\nRespondent received a more severe sentence at trial, one\n3½ times more severe than he likely would have received\nby pleading guilty. Far from curing the error, the trial\ncaused the injury from the error. Even if the trial itself is\nfree from constitutional flaw, the defendant who goes to\ntrial instead of taking a more favorable plea may be preju­\ndiced from either a conviction on more serious counts or\nthe imposition of a more severe sentence.\n   Second, petitioner claims this Court refined Strickland’s\nprejudice analysis in Fretwell to add an additional re­\nquirement that the defendant show that ineffective assis­\ntance of counsel led to his being denied a substantive or\n8                    LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprocedural right. Brief for Petitioner 12–13. The Court\nhas rejected the argument that Fretwell modified Strick-\nland before and does so again now. See Williams v. Tay-\nlor, 529 U. S. 362, 391 (2000) (“The Virginia Supreme\nCourt erred in holding that our decision in Lockhart v.\nFretwell, 506 U. S. 364 (1993), modified or in some way\nsupplanted the rule set down in Strickland”); see also\nGlover, supra, at 203 (“The Court explained last Term [in\nWilliams] that our holding in Lockhart does not supplant\nthe Strickland analysis”).\n   Fretwell could not show Strickland prejudice resulting\nfrom his attorney’s failure to object to the use of a sentenc­\ning factor the Eighth Circuit had erroneously (and tempo­\nrarily) found to be impermissible. Fretwell, 506 U. S., at\n373. Because the objection upon which his ineffective­\nassistance-of-counsel claim was premised was meritless,\nFretwell could not demonstrate an error entitling him to\nrelief. The case presented the “unusual circumstance\nwhere the defendant attempts to demonstrate prejudice\nbased on considerations that, as a matter of law, ought not\ninform the inquiry.” Ibid. (O’Connor, J., concurring). See\nalso ibid. (recognizing “[t]he determinative question—\nwhether there is a reasonable probability that, but for\ncounsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceed­\ning would have been different—remains unchanged” (in­\nternal quotation marks and citation omitted)). It is for\nthis same reason a defendant cannot show prejudice based\non counsel’s refusal to present perjured testimony, even if\nsuch testimony might have affected the outcome of the\ncase. See Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U. S. 157, 175 (1986)\n(holding first that counsel’s refusal to present perjured\ntestimony breached no professional duty and second that\nit cannot establish prejudice under Strickland).\n   Both Fretwell and Nix are instructive in that they\ndemonstrate “there are also situations in which it would\nbe unjust to characterize the likelihood of a different\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\noutcome as legitimate ‘prejudice,’ ” Williams, supra, at\n391–392, because defendants would receive a windfall as a\nresult of the application of an incorrect legal principle or\na defense strategy outside the law. Here, however, the\ninjured client seeks relief from counsel’s failure to meet a\nvalid legal standard, not from counsel’s refusal to violate\nit. He maintains that, absent ineffective counsel, he would\nhave accepted a plea offer for a sentence the prosecution\nevidently deemed consistent with the sound administra­\ntion of criminal justice. The favorable sentence that elud­\ned the defendant in the criminal proceeding appears to be\nthe sentence he or others in his position would have re­\nceived in the ordinary course, absent the failings of coun­\nsel. See Bibas, Regulating the Plea-Bargaining Market:\nFrom Caveat Emptor to Consumer Protection, 99 Cal. L.\nRev. 1117, 1138 (2011) (“The expected post-trial sentence\nis imposed in only a few percent of cases. It is like the\nsticker price for cars: only an ignorant, ill-advised con­\nsumer would view full price as the norm and anything less\na bargain”); see also Frye, ante, at 7–8. If a plea bargain\nhas been offered, a defendant has the right to effective\nassistance of counsel in considering whether to accept it.\nIf that right is denied, prejudice can be shown if loss of the\nplea opportunity led to a trial resulting in a conviction on\nmore serious charges or the imposition of a more severe\nsentence.\n   It is, of course, true that defendants have “no right to be\noffered a plea . . . nor a federal right that the judge accept\nit.” Frye, ante, at 12. In the circumstances here, that is\nbeside the point. If no plea offer is made, or a plea deal\nis accepted by the defendant but rejected by the judge, the\nissue raised here simply does not arise. Much the same\nreasoning guides cases that find criminal defendants have\na right to effective assistance of counsel in direct appeals\neven though the Constitution does not require States to\nprovide a system of appellate review at all. See Evitts, 469\n10                   LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. 387; see also Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353\n(1963). As in those cases, “[w]hen a State opts to act in a\nfield where its action has significant discretionary ele­\nments, it must nonetheless act in accord with the dictates\nof the Constitution.” Evitts, supra, at 401.\n   Third, petitioner seeks to preserve the conviction ob­\ntained by the State by arguing that the purpose of the\nSixth Amendment is to ensure “the reliability of [a] convic­\ntion following trial.” Brief for Petitioner 13. This argu­\nment, too, fails to comprehend the full scope of the Sixth\nAmendment’s protections; and it is refuted by precedent.\nStrickland recognized “[t]he benchmark for judging any\nclaim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel’s conduct\nso undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial\nprocess that the trial cannot be relied on as having pro­\nduced a just result.” 466 U. S., at 686. The goal of a just\nresult is not divorced from the reliability of a conviction,\nsee United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 658 (1984); but\nhere the question is not the fairness or reliability of the\ntrial but the fairness and regularity of the processes that\npreceded it, which caused the defendant to lose benefits he\nwould have received in the ordinary course but for coun­\nsel’s ineffective assistance.\n   There are instances, furthermore, where a reliable trial\ndoes not foreclose relief when counsel has failed to assert\nrights that may have altered the outcome. In Kimmelman\nv. Morrison, 477 U. S. 365 (1986), the Court held that an\nattorney’s failure to timely move to suppress evidence\nduring trial could be grounds for federal habeas relief.\nThe Court rejected the suggestion that the “failure to\nmake a timely request for the exclusion of illegally seized\nevidence” could not be the basis for a Sixth Amendment\nviolation because the evidence “is ‘typically reliable and\noften the most probative information bearing on the guilt\nor innocence of the defendant.’ ” Id., at 379 (quoting Stone\nv. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 490 (1976)). “The constitutional\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrights of criminal defendants,” the Court observed, “are\ngranted to the innocent and the guilty alike. Consequent­\nly, we decline to hold either that the guarantee of effective\nassistance of counsel belongs solely to the innocent or that\nit attaches only to matters affecting the determination of\nactual guilt.” 477 U. S., at 380. The same logic applies\nhere. The fact that respondent is guilty does not mean\nhe was not entitled by the Sixth Amendment to effective\nassistance or that he suffered no prejudice from his attor­\nney’s deficient performance during plea bargaining.\n   In the end, petitioner’s three arguments amount to one\ngeneral contention: A fair trial wipes clean any deficient\nperformance by defense counsel during plea bargaining.\nThat position ignores the reality that criminal justice\ntoday is for the most part a system of pleas, not a system\nof trials. Ninety-seven percent of federal convictions and\nninety-four percent of state convictions are the result of\nguilty pleas. See Frye, ante, at 7. As explained in Frye,\nthe right to adequate assistance of counsel cannot be\ndefined or enforced without taking account of the central\nrole plea bargaining plays in securing convictions and\ndetermining sentences. Ibid. (“[I]t is insufficient simply\nto point to the guarantee of a fair trial as a backstop that\ninoculates any errors in the pretrial process”).\n                            C\n  Even if a defendant shows ineffective assistance of\ncounsel has caused the rejection of a plea leading to a trial\nand a more severe sentence, there is the question of what\nconstitutes an appropriate remedy. That question must\nnow be addressed.\n  Sixth Amendment remedies should be “tailored to the\ninjury suffered from the constitutional violation and\nshould not unnecessarily infringe on competing interests.”\nUnited States v. Morrison, 449 U. S. 361, 364 (1981).\nThus, a remedy must “neutralize the taint” of a constitu­\n12                    LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntional violation, id., at 365, while at the same time not\ngrant a windfall to the defendant or needlessly squander\nthe considerable resources the State properly invested in\nthe criminal prosecution. See Mechanik, 475 U. S., at 72\n(“The reversal of a conviction entails substantial social\ncosts: it forces jurors, witnesses, courts, the prosecution,\nand the defendants to expend further time, energy, and\nother resources to repeat a trial that has already once\ntaken place; victims may be asked to relive their disturb­\ning experiences”).\n   The specific injury suffered by defendants who decline a\nplea offer as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel\nand then receive a greater sentence as a result of trial can\ncome in at least one of two forms. In some cases, the sole\nadvantage a defendant would have received under the plea\nis a lesser sentence. This is typically the case when the\ncharges that would have been admitted as part of the plea\nbargain are the same as the charges the defendant was\nconvicted of after trial. In this situation the court may\nconduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the\ndefendant has shown a reasonable probability that but for\ncounsel’s errors he would have accepted the plea. If the\nshowing is made, the court may exercise discretion in\ndetermining whether the defendant should receive the\nterm of imprisonment the government offered in the plea,\nthe sentence he received at trial, or something in between.\n   In some situations it may be that resentencing alone\nwill not be full redress for the constitutional injury. If, for\nexample, an offer was for a guilty plea to a count or counts\nless serious than the ones for which a defendant was\nconvicted after trial, or if a mandatory sentence confines a\njudge’s sentencing discretion after trial, a resentencing\nbased on the conviction at trial may not suffice. See, e.g.,\nWilliams, 571 F. 3d, at 1088; Riggs v. Fairman, 399 F. 3d\n1179, 1181 (CA9 2005). In these circumstances, the\nproper exercise of discretion to remedy the constitutional\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninjury may be to require the prosecution to reoffer the plea\nproposal. Once this has occurred, the judge can then\nexercise discretion in deciding whether to vacate the con­\nviction from trial and accept the plea or leave the convic­\ntion undisturbed.\n   In implementing a remedy in both of these situations,\nthe trial court must weigh various factors; and the bound­\naries of proper discretion need not be defined here. Prin­\nciples elaborated over time in decisions of state and feder­\nal courts, and in statutes and rules, will serve to give more\ncomplete guidance as to the factors that should bear upon\nthe exercise of the judge’s discretion. At this point, how­\never, it suffices to note two considerations that are of\nrelevance.\n   First, a court may take account of a defendant’s earlier\nexpressed willingness, or unwillingness, to accept respon­\nsibility for his or her actions. Second, it is not necessary\nhere to decide as a constitutional rule that a judge is re-\nquired to prescind (that is to say disregard) any infor­\nmation concerning the crime that was discovered after the\nplea offer was made. The time continuum makes it diffi­\ncult to restore the defendant and the prosecution to the\nprecise positions they occupied prior to the rejection of the\nplea offer, but that baseline can be consulted in finding a\nremedy that does not require the prosecution to incur the\nexpense of conducting a new trial.\n   Petitioner argues that implementing a remedy here will\nopen the floodgates to litigation by defendants seeking to\nunsettle their convictions. See Brief for Petitioner 20.\nPetitioner’s concern is misplaced. Courts have recognized\nclaims of this sort for over 30 years, see supra, at 5, and\nyet there is no indication that the system is overwhelmed\nby these types of suits or that defendants are receiving\nwindfalls as a result of strategically timed Strickland\nclaims. See also Padilla, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14)\n(“We confronted a similar ‘floodgates’ concern in Hill,” but\n14                   LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\na “flood did not follow in that decision’s wake”). In addi­\ntion, the “prosecution and the trial courts may adopt some\nmeasures to help ensure against late, frivolous, or fabri­\ncated claims after a later, less advantageous plea offer\nhas been accepted or after a trial leading to conviction.”\nFrye, ante, at 10. See also ibid. (listing procedures cur­\nrently used by various States). This, too, will help ensure\nagainst meritless claims.\n                             III\n  The standards for ineffective assistance of counsel when\na defendant rejects a plea offer and goes to trial must now\nbe applied to this case. Respondent brings a federal col­\nlateral challenge to a state-court conviction.         Under\nAEDPA, a federal court may not grant a petition for a writ\nof habeas corpus unless the state court’s adjudication on\nthe merits was “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable\napplication of, clearly established Federal law, as deter­\nmined by the Supreme Court of the United States.” 28\nU. S. C. §2254(d)(1). A decision is contrary to clearly\nestablished law if the state court “applies a rule that con-\ntradicts the governing law set forth in [Supreme Court]\ncases.” Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 405 (2000)\n(opinion for the Court by O’Connor, J.). The Court of\nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit could not determine whether\nthe Michigan Court of Appeals addressed respondent’s\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim or, if it did, “what\nthe court decided, or even whether the correct legal rule\nwas identified.” 376 Fed. Appx., at 568–569.\n  The state court’s decision may not be quite so opaque as\nthe Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit thought, yet the\nfederal court was correct to note that AEDPA does not\npresent a bar to granting respondent relief. That is be­\ncause the Michigan Court of Appeals identified respond­\nent’s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim but failed to\napply Strickland to assess it. Rather than applying\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)         15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStrickland, the state court simply found that respondent’s\nrejection of the plea was knowing and voluntary. Cooper,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2414898\"><a href=\"/opinion/2414898/united-states-v-cooper/\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">599740</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *1, App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a. An in­\nquiry into whether the rejection of a plea is knowing and\nvoluntary, however, is not the correct means by which to\naddress a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See\nHill, 474 U. S., at 370 (applying Strickland to assess a\nclaim of ineffective assistance of counsel arising out of\nthe plea negotiation process). After stating the incorrect\nstandard, moreover, the state court then made an irrele­\nvant observation about counsel’s performance at trial and\nmischaracterized respondent’s claim as a complaint that\nhis attorney did not obtain a more favorable plea bargain.\nBy failing to apply Strickland to assess the ineffective­\nassistance-of-counsel claim respondent raised, the state\ncourt’s adjudication was contrary to clearly established\nfederal law. And in that circumstance the federal courts\nin this habeas action can determine the principles neces­\nsary to grant relief. See Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U. S.\n930, 948 (2007).\n   Respondent has satisfied Strickland’s two-part test.\nRegarding performance, perhaps it could be accepted that\nit is unclear whether respondent’s counsel believed re­\nspondent could not be convicted for assault with intent to\nmurder as a matter of law because the shots hit Mundy\nbelow the waist, or whether he simply thought this would\nbe a persuasive argument to make to the jury to show lack\nof specific intent. And, as the Court of Appeals for the\nSixth Circuit suggested, an erroneous strategic prediction\nabout the outcome of a trial is not necessarily deficient\nperformance. Here, however, the fact of deficient perfor­\nmance has been conceded by all parties. The case comes to\nus on that assumption, so there is no need to address this\nquestion.\n   As to prejudice, respondent has shown that but for\ncounsel’s deficient performance there is a reasonable\n16                   LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprobability he and the trial court would have accepted the\nguilty plea. See 376 Fed. Appx., at 571–572. In addition,\nas a result of not accepting the plea and being convicted at\ntrial, respondent received a minimum sentence 3½ times\ngreater than he would have received under the plea. The\nstandard for ineffective assistance under Strickland has\nthus been satisfied.\n   As a remedy, the District Court ordered specific perfor­\nmance of the original plea agreement. The correct remedy\nin these circumstances, however, is to order the State to\nreoffer the plea agreement. Presuming respondent accepts\nthe offer, the state trial court can then exercise its discre­\ntion in determining whether to vacate the convictions and\nresentence respondent pursuant to the plea agreement, to\nvacate only some of the convictions and resentence re­\nspondent accordingly, or to leave the convictions and\nsentence from trial undisturbed. See Mich. Ct. Rule\n6.302(C)(3) (2011) (“If there is a plea agreement and its\nterms provide for the defendant’s plea to be made in ex­\nchange for a specific sentence disposition or a prosecuto-\nrial sentence recommendation, the court may . . . reject\nthe agreement”). Today’s decision leaves open to the trial\ncourt how best to exercise that discretion in all the cir­\ncumstances of the case.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth\nCircuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

If that right is denied, preju-\n    dice can be shown if loss of the plea opportunity led\n    to a trial resulting in a conviction on more serious\n    charges or the imposition of a more severe sentence.”\n    Ante, at 9.\n       “The inquiry then becomes how to define the duty\n    and responsibilities of defense counsel in the plea bar-\n    gain process. This is a difficult question. . . . Bargain-\n    ing is, by its nature, defined to a substantial degree by\n    personal style. . . . This case presents neither the ne-\n    cessity nor the occasion to define the duties of defense\n    counsel in those respects . . . .” Missouri v. Frye, ante,\n    at 8.\n  With those words from this and the companion case, the\nCourt today opens a whole new field of constitutionalized\ncriminal procedure: plea-bargaining law. The ordinary\ncriminal process has become too long, too expensive, and\nunpredictable, in no small part as a consequence of an\nintricate federal Code of Criminal Procedure imposed on\nthe States by this Court in pursuit of perfect justice. See\n2                    LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nFriendly, The Bill of Rights as a Code of Criminal Proce­\ndure, 53 Cal. L. Rev. 929 (1965). The Court now moves to\nbring perfection to the alternative in which prosecutors\nand defendants have sought relief. Today’s opinions deal\nwith only two aspects of counsel’s plea-bargaining in­\nadequacy, and leave other aspects (who knows what they\nmight be?) to be worked out in further constitutional\nlitigation that will burden the criminal process. And it\nwould be foolish to think that “constitutional” rules gov­\nerning counsel’s behavior will not be followed by rules\ngoverning the prosecution’s behavior in the plea­\nbargaining process that the Court today announces “ ‘is the\ncriminal justice system,’ ” Frye, ante, at 7 (quoting approv­\ningly from Scott & Stuntz, Plea Bargaining as Contract,\n101 Yale L. J. 1909, 1912 (1992) (hereinafter Scott)). Is it\nconstitutional, for example, for the prosecution to with­\ndraw a plea offer that has already been accepted? Or to\nwithdraw an offer before the defense has had adequate\ntime to consider and accept it? Or to make no plea offer at\nall, even though its case is weak—thereby excluding the\ndefendant from “the criminal justice system”?\n   Anthony Cooper received a full and fair trial, was found\nguilty of all charges by a unanimous jury, and was given\nthe sentence that the law prescribed. The Court nonethe­\nless concludes that Cooper is entitled to some sort of ha­\nbeas corpus relief (perhaps) because his attorney’s allegedly\nincompetent advice regarding a plea offer caused him to\nreceive a full and fair trial. That conclusion is foreclosed\nby our precedents. Even if it were not foreclosed, the\nconstitutional right to effective plea-bargainers that it\nestablishes is at least a new rule of law, which does not\nundermine the Michigan Court of Appeals’ decision and\ntherefore cannot serve as the basis for habeas relief. And\nthe remedy the Court announces—namely, whatever the\nstate trial court in its discretion prescribes, down to and\nincluding no remedy at all—is unheard-of and quite ab­\n                  Cite as: 566 U.

I respectfully\ndissent.\n                               I\n   This case and its companion, Missouri v. Frye, ante,\np. ___, raise relatively straightforward questions about the\nscope of the right to effective assistance of counsel. Our\ncase law originally derived that right from the Due Pro­\ncess Clause, and its guarantee of a fair trial, see United\nStates v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. 140, 147 (2006), but\nthe seminal case of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S.\n668 (1984), located the right within the Sixth Amendment.\nAs the Court notes, ante, at 6, the right to counsel does not\nbegin at trial. It extends to “any stage of the prosecution,\nformal or informal, in court or out, where counsel’s ab­\nsence might derogate from the accused’s right to a fair\ntrial.” United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 226 (1967).\nApplying that principle, we held that the “entry of a guilty\nplea, whether to a misdemeanor or a felony charge, ranks\nas a ‘critical stage’ at which the right to counsel adheres.”\nIowa v. Tovar, 541 U. S. 77, 81 (2004); see also Hill v.\nLockhart, 474 U. S. 52, 58 (1985). And it follows from this\nthat acceptance of a plea offer is a critical stage. That, and\nnothing more, is the point of the Court’s observation in\nPadilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at\n16), that “the negotiation of a plea bargain is a critical\nphase of litigation for purposes of the Sixth Amendment\nright to effective assistance of counsel.” The defendant in\nPadilla had accepted the plea bargain and pleaded guilty,\nabandoning his right to a fair trial; he was entitled to\nadvice of competent counsel before he did so. The Court\nhas never held that the rule articulated in Padilla, Tovar,\nand Hill extends to all aspects of plea negotiations, requir­\ning not just advice of competent counsel before the defend­\nant accepts a plea bargain and pleads guilty, but also the\nadvice of competent counsel before the defendant rejects a\n4                        LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nplea bargain and stands on his constitutional right to a\nfair trial. The latter is a vast departure from our past\ncases, protecting not just the constitutionally prescribed\nright to a fair adjudication of guilt and punishment, but a\njudicially invented right to effective plea bargaining.\n   It is also apparent from Strickland that bad plea bar­\ngaining has nothing to do with ineffective assistance of\ncounsel in the constitutional sense. Strickland explained\nthat “[i]n giving meaning to the requirement [of effective\nassistance], . . . we must take its purpose—to ensure a fair\ntrial—as the guide.” 466 U. S., at 686. Since “the right to\nthe effective assistance of counsel is recognized not for its\nown sake, but because of the effect it has on the ability of\nthe accused to receive a fair trial,” United States v. Cronic,\n466 U. S. 648, 658 (1984), the “benchmark” inquiry in\nevaluating any claim of ineffective assistance is whether\ncounsel’s performance “so undermined the proper func­\ntioning of the adversarial process” that it failed to produce\na reliably “just result.” Strickland, 466 U. S., at 686.\nThat is what Strickland’s requirement of “prejudice” con­\nsists of: Because the right to effective assistance has as its\npurpose the assurance of a fair trial, the right is not in­\nfringed unless counsel’s mistakes call into question the\nbasic justice of a defendant’s conviction or sentence. That\nhas been, until today, entirely clear. A defendant must\nshow “that counsel’s errors were so serious as to deprive\nthe defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is relia­\nble.” Id., at 687. See also Gonzalez-Lopez, supra, at 147.\nImpairment of fair trial is how we distinguish between\nunfortunate attorney error and error of constitutional\nsignificance.1\n——————\n   1 Rather than addressing the constitutional origins of the right to\n\neffective counsel, the Court responds to the broader claim (raised by no\none) that “the sole purpose of the Sixth Amendment is to protect the\nright to a fair trial.” Ante, at 6 (emphasis added). Cf. Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 10–12 (arguing that the “purpose of the Sixth\n                      Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                     5\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n  To be sure, Strickland stated a rule of thumb for meas­\nuring prejudice which, applied blindly and out of context,\ncould support the Court’s holding today: “The defendant\nmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but\nfor counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the pro­\nceeding would have been different.” 466 U. S., at 694.\nStrickland itself cautioned, however, that its test was not\nto be applied in a mechanical fashion, and that courts\nwere not to divert their “ultimate focus” from “the funda­\nmental fairness of the proceeding whose result is being\nchallenged.” Id., at 696. And until today we have followed\nthat course.\n  In Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U. S. 364 (1993), the defi­\ncient performance at issue was the failure of counsel for a\ndefendant who had been sentenced to death to make an\nobjection that would have produced a sentence of life\n——————\nAmendment right to counsel is to secure a fair trial” (emphasis added));\nBrief for Petitioner 12–21 (same). To destroy that straw man, the\nCourt cites cases in which violations of rights other than the right to\neffective counsel—and, perplexingly, even rights found outside the\nSixth Amendment and the Constitution entirely—were not cured by a\nsubsequent trial. Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254 (1986) (violation of\nequal protection in grand jury selection); Ballard v. United States, 329\nU. S. 187 (1946) (violation of statutory scheme providing that women\nserve on juries); Stirone v. United States, 361 U. S. 212 (1960) (violation\nof Fifth Amendment right to indictment by grand jury). Unlike the\nright to effective counsel, no showing of prejudice is required to make\nviolations of the rights at issue in Vasquez, Ballard, and Stirone com­\nplete. See Vasquez, supra, at 263–264 (“[D]iscrimination in the grand\njury undermines the structural integrity of the criminal tribunal itself,\nand is not amenable to harmless-error review”); Ballard, supra, at 195\n(“[R]eversible error does not depend on a showing of prejudice in an\nindividual case”); Stirone, supra, at 217 (“Deprivation of such a basic\nright is far too serious to be treated as nothing more than a variance\nand then dismissed as harmless error”). Those cases are thus irrele­\nvant to the question presented here, which is whether a defendant can\nestablish prejudice under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668\n(1984), while conceding the fairness of his conviction, sentence, and\nappeal.\n6                        LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nimprisonment instead. The objection was fully supported\nby then-extant Circuit law, so that the sentencing court\nwould have been compelled to sustain it, producing a life\nsentence that principles of double jeopardy would likely\nmake final. See id., at 383–385 (Stevens, J., dissenting);\nBullington v. Missouri, 451 U. S. 430 (1981). By the time\nFretwell’s claim came before us, however, the Circuit law\nhad been overruled in light of one of our cases. We deter­\nmined that a prejudice analysis “focusing solely on mere\noutcome determination, without attention to whether the\nresult of the proceeding was fundamentally unfair or\nunreliable,” would be defective. Fretwell, 506 U. S., at\n369. Because counsel’s error did not “deprive the defend­\nant of any substantive or procedural right to which the\nlaw entitles him,” the defendant’s sentencing proceeding\nwas fair and its result was reliable, even though counsel’s\nerror may have affected its outcome. Id., at 372. In Wil-\nliams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 391–393 (2000), we ex­\nplained that even though Fretwell did not mechanically\napply an outcome-based test for prejudice, its reasoning\nwas perfectly consistent with Strickland. “Fretwell’s\ncounsel had not deprived him of any substantive or pro­\ncedural right to which the law entitled him.” 529 U. S.\nat 392.2\n——————\n   2 Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U. S. 365 (1986), cited by the Court,\n\nante, at 10–11, does not contradict this principle. That case, which\npredated Fretwell and Williams, considered whether our holding that\nFourth Amendment claims fully litigated in state court cannot be\nraised in federal habeas “should be extended to Sixth Amendment\nclaims of ineffective assistance of counsel where the principal allegation\nand manifestation of inadequate representation is counsel’s failure to\nfile a timely motion to suppress evidence allegedly obtained in violation\nof the Fourth Amendment.” 477 U. S., at 368. Our negative answer to\nthat question had nothing to do with the issue here. The parties in\nKimmelman had not raised the question “whether the admission of\nillegally seized but reliable evidence can ever constitute ‘prejudice’\nunder Strickland”—a question similar to the one presented here—and\n                      Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      7\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n  Those precedents leave no doubt about the answer to\nthe question presented here. As the Court itself observes,\na criminal defendant has no right to a plea bargain. Ante,\nat 9. “[T]here is no constitutional right to plea bargain;\nthe prosecutor need not do so if he prefers to go to trial.”\nWeatherford v. Bursey, 429 U. S. 545, 561 (1977). Coun­\nsel’s mistakes in this case thus did not “deprive the de­\nfendant of a substantive or procedural right to which the\nlaw entitles him,” Williams, supra, at 393. Far from be-\ning “beside the point,” ante, at 9, that is critical to correct\napplication of our precedents. Like Fretwell, this case\n“concerns the unusual circumstance where the defendant\nattempts to demonstrate prejudice based on considerations\nthat, as a matter of law, ought not inform the inquiry,”\n506 U. S., at 373 (O’Connor, J., concurring); he claims\n“that he might have been denied ‘a right the law simply\ndoes not recognize,’ ” id., at 375 (same). Strickland,\nFretwell, and Williams all instruct that the pure outcome­\nbased test on which the Court relies is an erroneous\nmeasure of cognizable prejudice. In ignoring Strickland’s\n“ultimate focus . . . on the fundamental fairness of the\nproceeding whose result is being challenged,” 466 U. S., at\n696, the Court has lost the forest for the trees, leading it to\naccept what we have previously rejected, the “novel argu­\nment that constitutional rights are infringed by trying the\ndefendant rather than accepting his plea of guilty.”\nWeatherford, supra, at 561.\n——————\nthe Court therefore did not address it. Id., at 391 (Powell, J., concur­\nring in judgment); see also id., at 380. Kimmelman made clear, how­\never, how the answer to that question is to be determined: “The essence\nof an ineffective-assistance claim is that counsel’s unprofessional errors\nso upset the adversarial balance between defense and prosecution that\nthe trial was rendered unfair and the verdict rendered suspect,” id., at 374\n(emphasis added). “Only those habeas petitioners who can prove under\nStrickland that they have been denied a fair trial . . . will be granted the\nwrit,” id., at 382 (emphasis added). In short, Kimmelman’s only rele­\nvance is to prove the Court’s opinion wrong.\n8                   LAFLER v. COOPER \n\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting \n\n\n                             II\n\n   Novelty alone is the second, independent reason why the\nCourt’s decision is wrong. This case arises on federal\nhabeas, and hence is governed by the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). Since, as\nthe Court acknowledges, the Michigan Court of Appeals\nadjudicated Cooper’s ineffective-assistance claim on the\nmerits, AEDPA bars federal courts from granting habeas\nrelief unless that court’s decision was “contrary to, or\ninvolved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab­\nlished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\nof the United States.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). Yet the\nCourt concludes that §2254(d)(1) does not bar relief here,\nbecause “[b]y failing to apply Strickland to assess the\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim respondent raised,\nthe state court’s adjudication was contrary to clearly\nestablished federal law.” Ante, at 15. That is not so.\n   The relevant portion of the Michigan Court of Appeals\ndecision reads as follows:\n       “To establish ineffective assistance, the defendant\n    must demonstrate that his counsel’s performance fell\n    below an objective standard of reasonableness and\n    that counsel’s representation so prejudiced the de­\n    fendant that he was deprived of a fair trial. With\n    respect to the prejudice aspect of the test, the defend-\n    ant must demonstrate a reasonable probability that,\n    but for counsel’s errors, the result of the proceed-\n    ings would have been different, and that the at-\n    tendant proceedings were fundamentally unfair and\n    unreliable.\n       “Defendant challenges the trial court’s finding after\n    a Ginther hearing that defense counsel provided effec­\n    tive assistance to defendant during the plea bargain­\n    ing process. He contends that defense counsel failed\n    to convey the benefits of the plea offer to him and ig­\n    nored his desire to plead guilty, and that these fail­\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

However, the record shows that defendant\n    knowingly and intelligently rejected two plea offers\n    and chose to go to trial. The record fails to support de­\n    fendant’s contentions that defense counsel’s represen­\n    tation was ineffective because he rejected a defense\n    based on [a] claim of self-defense and because he did\n    not obtain a more favorable plea bargain for defend­\n    ant.” People v. Cooper, No. 250583 (Mar. 15, 2005),\n    App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2414898\"><a href=\"/opinion/2414898/united-states-v-cooper/\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">599740</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *1\n    (per curiam) (footnote and citations omitted).\n   The first paragraph above, far from ignoring Strickland,\nrecites its standard with a good deal more accuracy than\nthe Court’s opinion. The second paragraph, which is\npresumably an application of the standard recited in the\nfirst, says that “defendant knowingly and intelligently\nrejected two plea offers and chose to go to trial.” This can\nbe regarded as a denial that there was anything “funda­\nmentally unfair” about Cooper’s conviction and sentence,\nso that no Strickland prejudice had been shown. On the\nother hand, the entire second paragraph can be regarded\nas a contention that Cooper’s claims of inadequate repre­\nsentation were unsupported by the record. The state\ncourt’s analysis was admittedly not a model of clarity, but\nfederal habeas corpus is a “guard against extreme mal­\nfunctions in the state criminal justice systems,” not a\nlicense to penalize a state court for its opinion-writing\ntechnique. Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 13) (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nCourt’s readiness to find error in the Michigan court’s\nopinion is “inconsistent with the presumption that state\ncourts know and follow the law,” Woodford v. Visciotti, 537\nU. S. 19, 24 (2002) (per curiam), a presumption borne out\nhere by the state court’s recitation of the correct legal\nstandard.\n   Since it is ambiguous whether the state court’s holding\n10                    LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nwas based on a lack of prejudice or rather the court’s\nfactual determination that there had been no deficient\nperformance, to provide relief under AEDPA this Court\nmust conclude that both holdings would have been unrea­\nsonable applications of clearly established law. See Premo\nv. Moore, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 7). The first\nis impossible of doing, since this Court has never held that\na defendant in Cooper’s position can establish Strickland\nprejudice. The Sixth Circuit thus violated AEDPA in\ngranting habeas relief, and the Court now does the same.\n                              III\n   It is impossible to conclude discussion of today’s ex­\ntraordinary opinion without commenting upon the remedy\nit provides for the unconstitutional conviction. It is a\nremedy unheard-of in American jurisprudence—and, I\nwould be willing to bet, in the jurisprudence of any other\ncountry.\n   The Court requires Michigan to “reoffer the plea agree­\nment” that was rejected because of bad advice from coun­\nsel. Ante, at 16. That would indeed be a powerful remedy—\nbut for the fact that Cooper’s acceptance of that re-\noffered agreement is not conclusive. Astoundingly, “the\nstate trial court can then exercise its discretion in deter­\nmining whether to vacate the convictions and resentence\nrespondent pursuant to the plea agreement, to vacate only\nsome of the convictions and resentence respondent accord­\ningly, or to leave the convictions and sentence from trial\nundisturbed.” Ibid. (emphasis added).\n   Why, one might ask, require a “reoffer” of the plea\nagreement, and its acceptance by the defendant? If the\ndistrict court finds (as a necessary element, supposedly, of\nStrickland prejudice) that Cooper would have accepted the\noriginal offer, and would thereby have avoided trial and\nconviction, why not skip the reoffer-and-reacceptance\nminuet and simply leave it to the discretion of the state\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ntrial court what the remedy shall be? The answer, of\ncourse, is camouflage. Trial courts, after all, regularly\naccept or reject plea agreements, so there seems to be\nnothing extraordinary about their accepting or rejecting\nthe new one mandated by today’s decision. But the ac­\nceptance or rejection of a plea agreement that has no\nstatus whatever under the United States Constitution is\nworlds apart from what this is: “discretionary” specifi­\ncation of a remedy for an unconstitutional criminal\nconviction.\n   To be sure, the Court asserts that there are “factors”\nwhich bear upon (and presumably limit) exercise of this\ndiscretion—factors that it is not prepared to specify in full,\nmuch less assign some determinative weight. “Principles\nelaborated over time in decisions of state and federal\ncourts, and in statutes and rules” will (in the Court’s rosy\nview) sort all that out. Ante, at 13. I find it extraordinary\nthat “statutes and rules” can specify the remedy for a\ncriminal defendant’s unconstitutional conviction. Or that\nthe remedy for an unconstitutional conviction should ever\nbe subject at all to a trial judge’s discretion. Or, finally,\nthat the remedy could ever include no remedy at all.\n   I suspect that the Court’s squeamishness in fashioning a\nremedy, and the incoherence of what it comes up with, is\nattributable to its realization, deep down, that there is no\nreal constitutional violation here anyway. The defendant\nhas been fairly tried, lawfully convicted, and properly\nsentenced, and any “remedy” provided for this will do\nnothing but undo the just results of a fair adversarial\nprocess.\n                            IV\n  In many—perhaps most—countries of the world, American­\nstyle plea bargaining is forbidden in cases as serious\nas this one, even for the purpose of obtaining testimony\nthat enables conviction of a greater malefactor, much less\n12                    LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nfor the purpose of sparing the expense of trial. See, e.g.,\nWorld Plea Bargaining 344, 363–366 (S. Thaman ed.\n2010). In Europe, many countries adhere to what they\naptly call the “legality principle” by requiring prosecutors\nto charge all prosecutable offenses, which is typically\nincompatible with the practice of charge-bargaining. See,\ne.g., id., at xxii; Langbein, Land Without Plea Bargaining:\nHow the Germans Do It, 78 Mich. L. Rev. 204, 210–211\n(1979) (describing the “Legalitätsprinzip,” or rule of com­\npulsory prosecution, in Germany). Such a system reflects\nan admirable belief that the law is the law, and those who\nbreak it should pay the penalty provided.\n   In the United States, we have plea bargaining a-plenty,\nbut until today it has been regarded as a necessary evil. It\npresents grave risks of prosecutorial overcharging that\neffectively compels an innocent defendant to avoid massive\nrisk by pleading guilty to a lesser offense; and for guilty\ndefendants it often—perhaps usually—results in a sen­\ntence well below what the law prescribes for the actual\ncrime. But even so, we accept plea bargaining because\nmany believe that without it our long and expensive pro­\ncess of criminal trial could not sustain the burden imposed\non it, and our system of criminal justice would grind to a\nhalt. See, e.g., Alschuler, Plea Bargaining and its History,\n79 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 38 (1979).\n   Today, however, the Supreme Court of the United\nStates elevates plea bargaining from a necessary evil to\na constitutional entitlement. It is no longer a somewhat\nembarrassing adjunct to our criminal justice system;\nrather, as the Court announces in the companion case to\nthis one, “ ‘it is the criminal justice system.’ ” Frye, ante, at\n7 (quoting approvingly from Scott 1912). Thus, even\nthough there is no doubt that the respondent here is guilty\nof the offense with which he was charged; even though he\nhas received the exorbitant gold standard of American\njustice—a full-dress criminal trial with its innumerable\n                    Cite as: 566 U.

The Court today embraces the sporting­\nchance theory of criminal law, in which the State functions\nlike a conscientious casino-operator, giving each player a\nfair chance to beat the house, that is, to serve less time\nthan the law says he deserves. And when a player is\nexcluded from the tables, his constitutional rights have\nbeen violated. I do not subscribe to that theory. No one\nshould, least of all the Justices of the Supreme Court.\n                        *      *    *\n   Today’s decision upends decades of our cases, violates a\nfederal statute, and opens a whole new boutique of consti­\ntutional jurisprudence (“plea-bargaining law”) without\neven specifying the remedies the boutique offers. The\nresult in the present case is the undoing of an adjudicatory\nprocess that worked exactly as it is supposed to. Released\nfelon Anthony Cooper, who shot repeatedly and gravely\ninjured a woman named Kali Mundy, was tried and con­\nvicted for his crimes by a jury of his peers, and given a\npunishment that Michigan’s elected representatives have\ndeemed appropriate. Nothing about that result is unfair\nor unconstitutional. To the contrary, it is wonderfully\njust, and infinitely superior to the trial-by-bargain that\ntoday’s opinion affords constitutional status. I respectfully\ndissent.\n——————\n  3 See People v.

ANTHONY COOPER\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                       [March 21, 2012]\n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO, dissenting.\n   For the reasons set out in Parts I and II of JUSTICE\nSCALIA’s dissent, the Court’s holding in this case mis-\napplies our ineffective-assistance-of-counsel case law and\nviolates the requirements of the Antiterrorism and Effec-\ntive Death Penalty Act of 1996. Respondent received a\ntrial that was free of any identified constitutional error,\nand, as a result, there is no basis for concluding that\nrespondent suffered prejudice and certainly not for grant-\ning habeas relief.\n   The weakness in the Court’s analysis is highlighted by\nits opaque discussion of the remedy that is appropriate\nwhen a plea offer is rejected due to defective legal repre-\nsentation. If a defendant’s Sixth Amendment rights are\nviolated when deficient legal advice about a favorable plea\noffer causes the opportunity for that bargain to be lost, the\nonly logical remedy is to give the defendant the benefit of\nthe favorable deal. But such a remedy would cause seri-\nous injustice in many instances, as I believe the Court\ntacitly recognizes. The Court therefore eschews the only\nlogical remedy and relies on the lower courts to exercise\nsound discretion in determining what is to be done.\n   Time will tell how this works out. The Court, for its\npart, finds it unnecessary to define “the boundaries of\nproper discretion” in today’s opinion. Ante, at 13. In my\nview, requiring the prosecution to renew an old plea offer\n2                   LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                    ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwould represent an abuse of discretion in at least two\ncircumstances: first, when important new information\nabout a defendant’s culpability comes to light after the\noffer is rejected, and, second, when the rejection of the\nplea offer results in a substantial expenditure of scarce\nprosecutorial or judicial resources.\n   The lower court judges who must implement today’s\nholding may—and I hope, will—do so in a way that miti-\ngates its potential to produce unjust results.

COOPER\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 10–209.      Argued October 31, 2011—Decided March 21, 2012\nRespondent was charged under Michigan law with assault with intent\n  to murder and three other offenses. The prosecution offered to dis­\n  miss two of the charges and to recommend a 51-to-85-month sentence\n  on the other two, in exchange for a guilty plea. In a communication\n  with the court, respondent admitted his guilt and expressed a will­\n  ingness to accept the offer. But he rejected the offer, allegedly after\n  his attorney convinced him that the prosecution would be unable to\n  establish intent to murder because the victim had been shot below\n  the waist. At trial, respondent was convicted on all counts and re­\n  ceived a mandatory minimum 185-to-360-month sentence. In a sub­\n  sequent hearing, the state trial court rejected respondent’s claim that\n  his attorney’s advice to reject the plea constituted ineffective assis­\n  tance. The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting the ineffec­\n  tive-assistance claim on the ground that respondent knowingly and\n  intelligently turned down the plea offer and chose to go to trial. Re­\n  spondent renewed his claim in federal habeas. Finding that the state\n  appellate court had unreasonably applied the constitutional effective­\n  assistance standards laid out in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S.\n  668, and Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, the District Court granted a\n  conditional writ and ordered specific performance of the original plea\n  offer. The Sixth Circuit affirmed. Applying Strickland, it found that\n  counsel had provided deficient performance by advising respondent of\n  an incorrect legal rule, and that respondent suffered prejudice be­\n  cause he lost the opportunity to take the more favorable sentence of­\n  fered in the plea.\nHeld:\n    1. Where counsel’s ineffective advice led to an offer’s rejection, and\n where the prejudice alleged is having to stand trial, a defendant must\n2                           LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    show that but for the ineffective advice, there is a reasonable proba­\n    bility that the plea offer would have been presented to the court, that\n    the court would have accepted its terms, and that the conviction or\n    sentence, or both, under the offer’s terms would have been less severe\n    than under the actual judgment and sentence imposed. Pp. 3–11.\n         (a) Because the parties agree that counsel’s performance was de­\n    ficient, the only question is how to apply Strickland’s prejudice test\n    where ineffective assistance results in a rejection of the plea offer and\n    the defendant is convicted at the ensuing trial. Pp. 3–4.\n         (b) In that context, the Strickland prejudice test requires a de­\n    fendant to show a reasonable possibility that the outcome of the plea\n    process would have been different with competent advice. The Sixth\n    Circuit and other federal appellate courts have agreed with the\n    Strickland prejudice test for rejected pleas adopted here by this\n    Court. Petitioner and the Solicitor General propose a narrow view—\n    that Strickland prejudice cannot arise from plea bargaining if the de­\n    fendant is later convicted at a fair trial—but their reasoning is un­\n    persuasive. First, they claim that the Sixth Amendment’s sole pur­\n    pose is to protect the right to a fair trial, but the Amendment actually\n    requires effective assistance at critical stages of a criminal proceed­\n    ing, including pretrial stages. This is consistent with the right to ef­\n    fective assistance on appeal, see, e.g., Halbert v. Michigan, 545 U. S.\n    605, and the right to counsel during sentencing, see, e.g., Glover v.\n    United States, 531 U. S. 198, 203–204. This Court has not followed a\n    rigid rule that an otherwise fair trial remedies errors not occurring at\n    trial, but has instead inquired whether the trial cured the particular\n    error at issue. See, e.g., Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 263. Se­\n    cond, this Court has previously rejected petitioner’s argument that\n    Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U. S. 364, modified Strickland and does so\n    again here. Fretwell and Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U. S. 157, demon­\n    strate that “it would be unjust to characterize the likelihood of a dif­\n    ferent outcome as legitimate ‘prejudice,’ ” Williams v. Taylor, 529\n    U. S. 362, 391–392, where defendants would receive a windfall as a\n    result of the application of an incorrect legal principle or a defense\n    strategy outside the law. Here, however, respondent seeks relief\n    from counsel’s failure to meet a valid legal standard. Third, petition­\n    er seeks to preserve the conviction by arguing that the Sixth\n    Amendment’s purpose is to ensure a conviction’s reliability, but this\n    argument fails to comprehend the full scope of the Sixth Amendment\n    and is refuted by precedent. Here, the question is the fairness or re­\n    liability not of the trial but of the processes that preceded it, which\n    caused respondent to lose benefits he would have received but for\n    counsel’s ineffective assistance. Furthermore, a reliable trial may not\n    foreclose relief when counsel has failed to assert rights that may have\n                   Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\naltered the outcome. See Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U. S. 365,\n379. Petitioner’s position that a fair trial wipes clean ineffective as­\nsistance during plea bargaining also ignores the reality that criminal\njustice today is for the most part a system of pleas, not a system of\ntrials. See Missouri v. Frye, ante, at ___. Pp. 4–11.\n   2. Where a defendant shows ineffective assistance has caused the\nrejection of a plea leading to a more severe sentence at trial, the rem­\nedy must “neutralize the taint” of a constitutional violation, United\nStates v. Morrison, 449 U. S. 361, 365, but must not grant a windfall\nto the defendant or needlessly squander the resources the State\nproperly invested in the criminal prosecution, see United States v.\nMechanik, 475 U. S. 66, 72. If the sole advantage is that the defend­\nant would have received a lesser sentence under the plea, the court\nshould have an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the de­\nfendant would have accepted the plea. If so, the court may exercise\ndiscretion in determining whether the defendant should receive the\nterm offered in the plea, the sentence received at trial, or something\nin between. However, resentencing based on the conviction at trial\nmay not suffice, e.g., where the offered guilty plea was for less serious\ncounts than the ones for which a defendant was convicted after trial,\nor where a mandatory sentence confines a judge’s sentencing discre­\ntion. In these circumstances, the proper remedy may be to require\nthe prosecution to reoffer the plea. The judge can then exercise dis­\ncretion in deciding whether to vacate the conviction from trial and\naccept the plea, or leave the conviction undisturbed. In either situa­\ntion, a court must weigh various factors. Here, it suffices to give two\nrelevant considerations. First, a court may take account of a defend­\nant’s earlier expressed willingness, or unwillingness, to accept re­\nsponsibility for his or her actions. Second, it is not necessary here to\ndecide as a constitutional rule that a judge is required to disregard\nany information concerning the crime discovered after the plea offer\nwas made. Petitioner argues that implementing a remedy will open\nthe floodgates to litigation by defendants seeking to unsettle their\nconvictions, but in the 30 years that courts have recognized such\nclaims, there has been no indication that the system is overwhelmed\nor that defendants are receiving windfalls as a result of strategically\ntimed Strickland claims. In addition, the prosecution and trial courts\nmay adopt measures to help ensure against meritless claims. See\nFrye, ante, at ___. Pp. 11–14.\n   3. This case arises under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), but because the Michigan Court of Ap­\npeals’ analysis of respondent’s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim\nwas contrary to clearly established federal law, AEDPA presents no\nbar to relief. Respondent has satisfied Strickland’s two-part test.\n4                           LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    The parties concede the fact of deficient performance. And respond­\n    ent has shown that but for that performance there is a reasonable\n    probability he and the trial court would have accepted the guilty plea.\n    In addition, as a result of not accepting the plea and being convicted\n    at trial, he received a minimum sentence 3½ times greater than he\n    would have received under the plea. As a remedy, the District Court\n    ordered specific performance of the plea agreement, but the correct\n    remedy is to order the State to reoffer the plea. If respondent accepts\n    the offer, the state trial court can exercise its discretion in determin­\n    ing whether to vacate respondent’s convictions and resentence pur­\n    suant to the plea agreement, to vacate only some of the convictions\n    and resentence accordingly, or to leave the conviction and sentence\n    resulting from the trial undisturbed.

ANTHONY COOPER\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 21, 2012]\n\n\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  In this case, as in Missouri v. Frye, ante, p. ___, also\ndecided today, a criminal defendant seeks a remedy when\ninadequate assistance of counsel caused nonacceptance of\na plea offer and further proceedings led to a less favorable\noutcome. In Frye, defense counsel did not inform the\ndefendant of the plea offer; and after the offer lapsed the\ndefendant still pleaded guilty, but on more severe terms.\nHere, the favorable plea offer was reported to the client\nbut, on advice of counsel, was rejected. In Frye there was\na later guilty plea. Here, after the plea offer had been\nrejected, there was a full and fair trial before a jury. After\na guilty verdict, the defendant received a sentence harsher\nthan that offered in the rejected plea bargain. The instant\ncase comes to the Court with the concession that counsel’s\nadvice with respect to the plea offer fell below the stand­\nard of adequate assistance of counsel guaranteed by the\nSixth Amendment, applicable to the States through the\nFourteenth Amendment.\n                           I\n  On the evening of March 25, 2003, respondent pointed a\ngun toward Kali Mundy’s head and fired. From the rec­\n2                    LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nord, it is unclear why respondent did this, and at trial it\nwas suggested that he might have acted either in self­\ndefense or in defense of another person. In any event the\nshot missed and Mundy fled. Respondent followed in pur-\nsuit, firing repeatedly. Mundy was shot in her buttock,\nhip, and abdomen but survived the assault.\n   Respondent was charged under Michigan law with as-\nsault with intent to murder, possession of a firearm by a\nfelon, possession of a firearm in the commission of a fel-\nony, misdemeanor possession of marijuana, and for being a\nhabitual offender. On two occasions, the prosecution\noffered to dismiss two of the charges and to recommend a\nsentence of 51 to 85 months for the other two, in exchange\nfor a guilty plea. In a communication with the court re­\nspondent admitted guilt and expressed a willingness to\naccept the offer. Respondent, however, later rejected the\noffer on both occasions, allegedly after his attorney con­\nvinced him that the prosecution would be unable to estab­\nlish his intent to murder Mundy because she had been\nshot below the waist. On the first day of trial the prosecu­\ntion offered a significantly less favorable plea deal, which\nrespondent again rejected. After trial, respondent was\nconvicted on all counts and received a mandatory mini­\nmum sentence of 185 to 360 months’ imprisonment.\n   In a so-called Ginther hearing before the state trial\ncourt, see People v. Ginther, 390 Mich. 436, 212 N. W. 2d\n922 (1973), respondent argued his attorney’s advice to\nreject the plea constituted ineffective assistance. The trial\njudge rejected the claim, and the Michigan Court of Ap­\npeals affirmed. People v. Cooper, No. 250583, 2005 WL\n599740 (Mar. 15, 2005) (per curiam), App. to Pet. for Cert.\n44a. The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected the claim\nof ineffective assistance of counsel on the ground that re-\nspondent knowingly and intelligently rejected two plea\noffers and chose to go to trial. The Michigan Supreme\nCourt denied respondent’s application for leave to file an\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nappeal. People v. Cooper, 474 Mich. 905, 705 N. W. 2d 118\n(2005) (table).\n  Respondent then filed a petition for federal habeas relief\nunder 28 U. S. C. §2254, renewing his ineffective­\nassistance-of-counsel claim. After finding, as required by\nthe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA), that the Michigan Court of Appeals had un-\nreasonably applied the constitutional standards for effective\nassistance of counsel laid out in Strickland v. Washington,\n466 U. S. 668 (1984), and Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52\n(1985), the District Court granted a conditional writ.\nCooper v. Lafler, No. 06–11068, 2009 WL 817712, *10 (ED\nMich., Mar. 26, 2009), App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a–42a. To\nremedy the violation, the District Court ordered “specific\nperformance of [respondent’s] original plea agreement, for\na minimum sentence in the range of fifty-one to eighty-five\nmonths.” Id., at *9, App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a.\n  The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit\naffirmed, 376 Fed. Appx. 563 (2010), finding “[e]ven full\ndeference under AEDPA cannot salvage the state court’s\ndecision,” id., at 569. Applying Strickland, the Court of\nAppeals found that respondent’s attorney had provided\ndeficient performance by informing respondent of “an\nincorrect legal rule,” 376 Fed. Appx., at 570–571, and that\nrespondent suffered prejudice because he “lost out on an\nopportunity to plead guilty and receive the lower sentence\nthat was offered to him.” Id., at 573. This Court granted\ncertiorari. 562 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n  Defendants have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel,\na right that extends to the plea-bargaining process. Frye,\nante, at 8; see also Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___\n(2010) (slip op., at 16); Hill, supra, at 57. During plea\nnegotiations defendants are “entitled to the effective assis­\n4                     LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\ntance of competent counsel.” McMann v. Richardson, 397\nU. S. 759, 771 (1970). In Hill, the Court held “the two­\npart Strickland v. Washington test applies to challenges to\nguilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel.”\n474 U. S., at 58. The performance prong of Strickland\nrequires a defendant to show “ ‘that counsel’s representa­\ntion fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.’ ”\n474 U. S., at 57 (quoting Strickland, 466 U. S., at 688). In\nthis case all parties agree the performance of respondent’s\ncounsel was deficient when he advised respondent to reject\nthe plea offer on the grounds he could not be convicted at\ntrial. In light of this concession, it is unnecessary for this\nCourt to explore the issue.\n   The question for this Court is how to apply Strickland’s\nprejudice test where ineffective assistance results in a re-\njection of the plea offer and the defendant is convicted at\nthe ensuing trial.\n                               B\n   To establish Strickland prejudice a defendant must\n“show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for\ncounsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceed­\ning would have been different.” Id., at 694. In the context\nof pleas a defendant must show the outcome of the plea\nprocess would have been different with competent advice.\nSee Frye, ante, at 12 (noting that Strickland’s inquiry, as\napplied to advice with respect to plea bargains, turns on\n“whether ‘the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent’ ” (quoting Strickland, supra, at 694)); see also\nHill, 474 U. S., at 59 (“The . . . ‘prejudice,’ requirement . . .\nfocuses on whether counsel’s constitutionally ineffective\nperformance affected the outcome of the plea process”). In\nHill, when evaluating the petitioner’s claim that ineffec­\ntive assistance led to the improvident acceptance of a\nguilty plea, the Court required the petitioner to show “that\nthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nerrors, [the defendant] would not have pleaded guilty and\nwould have insisted on going to trial.” Ibid.\n   In contrast to Hill, here the ineffective advice led not to\nan offer’s acceptance but to its rejection. Having to stand\ntrial, not choosing to waive it, is the prejudice alleged. In\nthese circumstances a defendant must show that but for\nthe ineffective advice of counsel there is a reasonable prob-\nability that the plea offer would have been presented\nto the court (i.e., that the defendant would have accepted\nthe plea and the prosecution would not have withdrawn it\nin light of intervening circumstances), that the court\nwould have accepted its terms, and that the conviction or\nsentence, or both, under the offer’s terms would have been\nless severe than under the judgment and sentence that in\nfact were imposed. Here, the Court of Appeals for the\nSixth Circuit agreed with that test for Strickland preju­\ndice in the context of a rejected plea bargain. This is\nconsistent with the test adopted and applied by other\nappellate courts without demonstrated difficulties or\nsystemic disruptions. See 376 Fed. Appx., at 571–573; see\nalso, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez Rodriguez, 929 F. 2d\n747, 753, n. 1 (CA1 1991) (per curiam); United States v.\nGordon, 156 F. 3d 376, 380–381 (CA2 1998) (per curiam);\nUnited States v.

Gaviria, 116 F. 3d 1498,\n1512–1514 (CADC 1997) (per curiam).\n   Petitioner and the Solicitor General propose a different,\nfar more narrow, view of the Sixth Amendment. They\ncontend there can be no finding of Strickland prejudice\narising from plea bargaining if the defendant is later\nconvicted at a fair trial. The three reasons petitioner and\n6                     LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Solicitor General offer for their approach are unper­\nsuasive.\n   First, petitioner and the Solicitor General claim that\nthe sole purpose of the Sixth Amendment is to protect the\nright to a fair trial. Errors before trial, they argue, are not\ncognizable under the Sixth Amendment unless they affect\nthe fairness of the trial itself. See Brief for Petitioner 12–\n21; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 10–12. The\nSixth Amendment, however, is not so narrow in its reach.\nCf. Frye, ante, at 11 (holding that a defendant can show\nprejudice under Strickland even absent a showing that the\ndeficient performance precluded him from going to trial).\nThe Sixth Amendment requires effective assistance of\ncounsel at critical stages of a criminal proceeding. Its\nprotections are not designed simply to protect the trial,\neven though “counsel’s absence [in these stages] may\nderogate from the accused’s right to a fair trial.” United\nStates v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 226 (1967). The constitu­\ntional guarantee applies to pretrial critical stages that are\npart of the whole course of a criminal proceeding, a pro­\nceeding in which defendants cannot be presumed to make\ncritical decisions without counsel’s advice. This is con­\nsistent, too, with the rule that defendants have a right to\neffective assistance of counsel on appeal, even though that\ncannot in any way be characterized as part of the trial.\nSee, e.g., Halbert v. Michigan, 545 U. S. 605 (2005); Evitts\nv. Lucey, 469 U. S. 387 (1985). The precedents also estab­\nlish that there exists a right to counsel during sentencing\nin both noncapital, see Glover v. United States, 531 U. S.\n198, 203–204 (2001); Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U. S. 128\n(1967), and capital cases, see Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S.\n510, 538 (2003). Even though sentencing does not concern\nthe defendant’s guilt or innocence, ineffective assistance of\ncounsel during a sentencing hearing can result in Strick-\nland prejudice because “any amount of [additional] jail\ntime has Sixth Amendment significance.” Glover, supra,\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat 203.\n   The Court, moreover, has not followed a rigid rule that\nan otherwise fair trial remedies errors not occurring at the\ntrial itself. It has inquired instead whether the trial cured\nthe particular error at issue. Thus, in Vasquez v. Hillery,\n474 U. S. 254 (1986), the deliberate exclusion of all\nAfrican-Americans from a grand jury was prejudicial be-\ncause a defendant may have been tried on charges that\nwould not have been brought at all by a properly constituted\ngrand jury. Id., at 263; see Ballard v. United States, 329\nU. S. 187, 195 (1946) (dismissing an indictment returned\nby a grand jury from which women were excluded); see\nalso Stirone v. United States, 361 U. S. 212, 218–219\n(1960) (reversing a defendant’s conviction because the jury\nmay have based its verdict on acts not charged in the\nindictment). By contrast, in United States v. Mechanik,\n475 U. S. 66 (1986), the complained-of error was a viola­\ntion of a grand jury rule meant to ensure probable cause\nexisted to believe a defendant was guilty. A subsequent\ntrial, resulting in a verdict of guilt, cured this error. See\nid., at 72–73.\n   In the instant case respondent went to trial rather than\naccept a plea deal, and it is conceded this was the result of\nineffective assistance during the plea negotiation process.\nRespondent received a more severe sentence at trial, one\n3½ times more severe than he likely would have received\nby pleading guilty. Far from curing the error, the trial\ncaused the injury from the error. Even if the trial itself is\nfree from constitutional flaw, the defendant who goes to\ntrial instead of taking a more favorable plea may be preju­\ndiced from either a conviction on more serious counts or\nthe imposition of a more severe sentence.\n   Second, petitioner claims this Court refined Strickland’s\nprejudice analysis in Fretwell to add an additional re­\nquirement that the defendant show that ineffective assis­\ntance of counsel led to his being denied a substantive or\n8                    LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprocedural right. Brief for Petitioner 12–13. The Court\nhas rejected the argument that Fretwell modified Strick-\nland before and does so again now. See Williams v. Tay-\nlor, 529 U. S. 362, 391 (2000) (“The Virginia Supreme\nCourt erred in holding that our decision in Lockhart v.\nFretwell, 506 U. S. 364 (1993), modified or in some way\nsupplanted the rule set down in Strickland”); see also\nGlover, supra, at 203 (“The Court explained last Term [in\nWilliams] that our holding in Lockhart does not supplant\nthe Strickland analysis”).\n   Fretwell could not show Strickland prejudice resulting\nfrom his attorney’s failure to object to the use of a sentenc­\ning factor the Eighth Circuit had erroneously (and tempo­\nrarily) found to be impermissible. Fretwell, 506 U. S., at\n373. Because the objection upon which his ineffective­\nassistance-of-counsel claim was premised was meritless,\nFretwell could not demonstrate an error entitling him to\nrelief. The case presented the “unusual circumstance\nwhere the defendant attempts to demonstrate prejudice\nbased on considerations that, as a matter of law, ought not\ninform the inquiry.” Ibid. (O’Connor, J., concurring). See\nalso ibid. (recognizing “[t]he determinative question—\nwhether there is a reasonable probability that, but for\ncounsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceed­\ning would have been different—remains unchanged” (in­\nternal quotation marks and citation omitted)). It is for\nthis same reason a defendant cannot show prejudice based\non counsel’s refusal to present perjured testimony, even if\nsuch testimony might have affected the outcome of the\ncase. See Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U. S. 157, 175 (1986)\n(holding first that counsel’s refusal to present perjured\ntestimony breached no professional duty and second that\nit cannot establish prejudice under Strickland).\n   Both Fretwell and Nix are instructive in that they\ndemonstrate “there are also situations in which it would\nbe unjust to characterize the likelihood of a different\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\noutcome as legitimate ‘prejudice,’ ” Williams, supra, at\n391–392, because defendants would receive a windfall as a\nresult of the application of an incorrect legal principle or\na defense strategy outside the law. Here, however, the\ninjured client seeks relief from counsel’s failure to meet a\nvalid legal standard, not from counsel’s refusal to violate\nit. He maintains that, absent ineffective counsel, he would\nhave accepted a plea offer for a sentence the prosecution\nevidently deemed consistent with the sound administra­\ntion of criminal justice. The favorable sentence that elud­\ned the defendant in the criminal proceeding appears to be\nthe sentence he or others in his position would have re­\nceived in the ordinary course, absent the failings of coun­\nsel. See Bibas, Regulating the Plea-Bargaining Market:\nFrom Caveat Emptor to Consumer Protection, 99 Cal. L.\nRev. 1117, 1138 (2011) (“The expected post-trial sentence\nis imposed in only a few percent of cases. It is like the\nsticker price for cars: only an ignorant, ill-advised con­\nsumer would view full price as the norm and anything less\na bargain”); see also Frye, ante, at 7–8. If a plea bargain\nhas been offered, a defendant has the right to effective\nassistance of counsel in considering whether to accept it.\nIf that right is denied, prejudice can be shown if loss of the\nplea opportunity led to a trial resulting in a conviction on\nmore serious charges or the imposition of a more severe\nsentence.\n   It is, of course, true that defendants have “no right to be\noffered a plea . . . nor a federal right that the judge accept\nit.” Frye, ante, at 12. In the circumstances here, that is\nbeside the point. If no plea offer is made, or a plea deal\nis accepted by the defendant but rejected by the judge, the\nissue raised here simply does not arise. Much the same\nreasoning guides cases that find criminal defendants have\na right to effective assistance of counsel in direct appeals\neven though the Constitution does not require States to\nprovide a system of appellate review at all. See Evitts, 469\n10                   LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. 387; see also Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353\n(1963). As in those cases, “[w]hen a State opts to act in a\nfield where its action has significant discretionary ele­\nments, it must nonetheless act in accord with the dictates\nof the Constitution.” Evitts, supra, at 401.\n   Third, petitioner seeks to preserve the conviction ob­\ntained by the State by arguing that the purpose of the\nSixth Amendment is to ensure “the reliability of [a] convic­\ntion following trial.” Brief for Petitioner 13. This argu­\nment, too, fails to comprehend the full scope of the Sixth\nAmendment’s protections; and it is refuted by precedent.\nStrickland recognized “[t]he benchmark for judging any\nclaim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel’s conduct\nso undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial\nprocess that the trial cannot be relied on as having pro­\nduced a just result.” 466 U. S., at 686. The goal of a just\nresult is not divorced from the reliability of a conviction,\nsee United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 658 (1984); but\nhere the question is not the fairness or reliability of the\ntrial but the fairness and regularity of the processes that\npreceded it, which caused the defendant to lose benefits he\nwould have received in the ordinary course but for coun­\nsel’s ineffective assistance.\n   There are instances, furthermore, where a reliable trial\ndoes not foreclose relief when counsel has failed to assert\nrights that may have altered the outcome. In Kimmelman\nv. Morrison, 477 U. S. 365 (1986), the Court held that an\nattorney’s failure to timely move to suppress evidence\nduring trial could be grounds for federal habeas relief.\nThe Court rejected the suggestion that the “failure to\nmake a timely request for the exclusion of illegally seized\nevidence” could not be the basis for a Sixth Amendment\nviolation because the evidence “is ‘typically reliable and\noften the most probative information bearing on the guilt\nor innocence of the defendant.’ ” Id., at 379 (quoting Stone\nv. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 490 (1976)). “The constitutional\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrights of criminal defendants,” the Court observed, “are\ngranted to the innocent and the guilty alike. Consequent­\nly, we decline to hold either that the guarantee of effective\nassistance of counsel belongs solely to the innocent or that\nit attaches only to matters affecting the determination of\nactual guilt.” 477 U. S., at 380. The same logic applies\nhere. The fact that respondent is guilty does not mean\nhe was not entitled by the Sixth Amendment to effective\nassistance or that he suffered no prejudice from his attor­\nney’s deficient performance during plea bargaining.\n   In the end, petitioner’s three arguments amount to one\ngeneral contention: A fair trial wipes clean any deficient\nperformance by defense counsel during plea bargaining.\nThat position ignores the reality that criminal justice\ntoday is for the most part a system of pleas, not a system\nof trials. Ninety-seven percent of federal convictions and\nninety-four percent of state convictions are the result of\nguilty pleas. See Frye, ante, at 7. As explained in Frye,\nthe right to adequate assistance of counsel cannot be\ndefined or enforced without taking account of the central\nrole plea bargaining plays in securing convictions and\ndetermining sentences. Ibid. (“[I]t is insufficient simply\nto point to the guarantee of a fair trial as a backstop that\ninoculates any errors in the pretrial process”).\n                            C\n  Even if a defendant shows ineffective assistance of\ncounsel has caused the rejection of a plea leading to a trial\nand a more severe sentence, there is the question of what\nconstitutes an appropriate remedy. That question must\nnow be addressed.\n  Sixth Amendment remedies should be “tailored to the\ninjury suffered from the constitutional violation and\nshould not unnecessarily infringe on competing interests.”\nUnited States v. Morrison, 449 U. S. 361, 364 (1981).\nThus, a remedy must “neutralize the taint” of a constitu­\n12                    LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntional violation, id., at 365, while at the same time not\ngrant a windfall to the defendant or needlessly squander\nthe considerable resources the State properly invested in\nthe criminal prosecution. See Mechanik, 475 U. S., at 72\n(“The reversal of a conviction entails substantial social\ncosts: it forces jurors, witnesses, courts, the prosecution,\nand the defendants to expend further time, energy, and\nother resources to repeat a trial that has already once\ntaken place; victims may be asked to relive their disturb­\ning experiences”).\n   The specific injury suffered by defendants who decline a\nplea offer as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel\nand then receive a greater sentence as a result of trial can\ncome in at least one of two forms. In some cases, the sole\nadvantage a defendant would have received under the plea\nis a lesser sentence. This is typically the case when the\ncharges that would have been admitted as part of the plea\nbargain are the same as the charges the defendant was\nconvicted of after trial. In this situation the court may\nconduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the\ndefendant has shown a reasonable probability that but for\ncounsel’s errors he would have accepted the plea. If the\nshowing is made, the court may exercise discretion in\ndetermining whether the defendant should receive the\nterm of imprisonment the government offered in the plea,\nthe sentence he received at trial, or something in between.\n   In some situations it may be that resentencing alone\nwill not be full redress for the constitutional injury. If, for\nexample, an offer was for a guilty plea to a count or counts\nless serious than the ones for which a defendant was\nconvicted after trial, or if a mandatory sentence confines a\njudge’s sentencing discretion after trial, a resentencing\nbased on the conviction at trial may not suffice. See, e.g.,\nWilliams, 571 F. 3d, at 1088; Riggs v. Fairman, 399 F. 3d\n1179, 1181 (CA9 2005). In these circumstances, the\nproper exercise of discretion to remedy the constitutional\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninjury may be to require the prosecution to reoffer the plea\nproposal. Once this has occurred, the judge can then\nexercise discretion in deciding whether to vacate the con­\nviction from trial and accept the plea or leave the convic­\ntion undisturbed.\n   In implementing a remedy in both of these situations,\nthe trial court must weigh various factors; and the bound­\naries of proper discretion need not be defined here. Prin­\nciples elaborated over time in decisions of state and feder­\nal courts, and in statutes and rules, will serve to give more\ncomplete guidance as to the factors that should bear upon\nthe exercise of the judge’s discretion. At this point, how­\never, it suffices to note two considerations that are of\nrelevance.\n   First, a court may take account of a defendant’s earlier\nexpressed willingness, or unwillingness, to accept respon­\nsibility for his or her actions. Second, it is not necessary\nhere to decide as a constitutional rule that a judge is re-\nquired to prescind (that is to say disregard) any infor­\nmation concerning the crime that was discovered after the\nplea offer was made. The time continuum makes it diffi­\ncult to restore the defendant and the prosecution to the\nprecise positions they occupied prior to the rejection of the\nplea offer, but that baseline can be consulted in finding a\nremedy that does not require the prosecution to incur the\nexpense of conducting a new trial.\n   Petitioner argues that implementing a remedy here will\nopen the floodgates to litigation by defendants seeking to\nunsettle their convictions. See Brief for Petitioner 20.\nPetitioner’s concern is misplaced. Courts have recognized\nclaims of this sort for over 30 years, see supra, at 5, and\nyet there is no indication that the system is overwhelmed\nby these types of suits or that defendants are receiving\nwindfalls as a result of strategically timed Strickland\nclaims. See also Padilla, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14)\n(“We confronted a similar ‘floodgates’ concern in Hill,” but\n14                   LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\na “flood did not follow in that decision’s wake”). In addi­\ntion, the “prosecution and the trial courts may adopt some\nmeasures to help ensure against late, frivolous, or fabri­\ncated claims after a later, less advantageous plea offer\nhas been accepted or after a trial leading to conviction.”\nFrye, ante, at 10. See also ibid. (listing procedures cur­\nrently used by various States). This, too, will help ensure\nagainst meritless claims.\n                             III\n  The standards for ineffective assistance of counsel when\na defendant rejects a plea offer and goes to trial must now\nbe applied to this case. Respondent brings a federal col­\nlateral challenge to a state-court conviction.         Under\nAEDPA, a federal court may not grant a petition for a writ\nof habeas corpus unless the state court’s adjudication on\nthe merits was “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable\napplication of, clearly established Federal law, as deter­\nmined by the Supreme Court of the United States.” 28\nU. S. C. §2254(d)(1). A decision is contrary to clearly\nestablished law if the state court “applies a rule that con-\ntradicts the governing law set forth in [Supreme Court]\ncases.” Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 405 (2000)\n(opinion for the Court by O’Connor, J.). The Court of\nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit could not determine whether\nthe Michigan Court of Appeals addressed respondent’s\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim or, if it did, “what\nthe court decided, or even whether the correct legal rule\nwas identified.” 376 Fed. Appx., at 568–569.\n  The state court’s decision may not be quite so opaque as\nthe Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit thought, yet the\nfederal court was correct to note that AEDPA does not\npresent a bar to granting respondent relief. That is be­\ncause the Michigan Court of Appeals identified respond­\nent’s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim but failed to\napply Strickland to assess it. Rather than applying\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)         15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStrickland, the state court simply found that respondent’s\nrejection of the plea was knowing and voluntary. Cooper,\n2005 WL 599740, *1, App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a. An in­\nquiry into whether the rejection of a plea is knowing and\nvoluntary, however, is not the correct means by which to\naddress a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See\nHill, 474 U. S., at 370 (applying Strickland to assess a\nclaim of ineffective assistance of counsel arising out of\nthe plea negotiation process). After stating the incorrect\nstandard, moreover, the state court then made an irrele­\nvant observation about counsel’s performance at trial and\nmischaracterized respondent’s claim as a complaint that\nhis attorney did not obtain a more favorable plea bargain.\nBy failing to apply Strickland to assess the ineffective­\nassistance-of-counsel claim respondent raised, the state\ncourt’s adjudication was contrary to clearly established\nfederal law. And in that circumstance the federal courts\nin this habeas action can determine the principles neces­\nsary to grant relief. See Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U. S.\n930, 948 (2007).\n   Respondent has satisfied Strickland’s two-part test.\nRegarding performance, perhaps it could be accepted that\nit is unclear whether respondent’s counsel believed re­\nspondent could not be convicted for assault with intent to\nmurder as a matter of law because the shots hit Mundy\nbelow the waist, or whether he simply thought this would\nbe a persuasive argument to make to the jury to show lack\nof specific intent. And, as the Court of Appeals for the\nSixth Circuit suggested, an erroneous strategic prediction\nabout the outcome of a trial is not necessarily deficient\nperformance. Here, however, the fact of deficient perfor­\nmance has been conceded by all parties. The case comes to\nus on that assumption, so there is no need to address this\nquestion.\n   As to prejudice, respondent has shown that but for\ncounsel’s deficient performance there is a reasonable\n16                   LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprobability he and the trial court would have accepted the\nguilty plea. See 376 Fed. Appx., at 571–572. In addition,\nas a result of not accepting the plea and being convicted at\ntrial, respondent received a minimum sentence 3½ times\ngreater than he would have received under the plea. The\nstandard for ineffective assistance under Strickland has\nthus been satisfied.\n   As a remedy, the District Court ordered specific perfor­\nmance of the original plea agreement. The correct remedy\nin these circumstances, however, is to order the State to\nreoffer the plea agreement. Presuming respondent accepts\nthe offer, the state trial court can then exercise its discre­\ntion in determining whether to vacate the convictions and\nresentence respondent pursuant to the plea agreement, to\nvacate only some of the convictions and resentence re­\nspondent accordingly, or to leave the convictions and\nsentence from trial undisturbed. See Mich. Ct. Rule\n6.302(C)(3) (2011) (“If there is a plea agreement and its\nterms provide for the defendant’s plea to be made in ex­\nchange for a specific sentence disposition or a prosecuto-\nrial sentence recommendation, the court may . . . reject\nthe agreement”). Today’s decision leaves open to the trial\ncourt how best to exercise that discretion in all the cir­\ncumstances of the case.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth\nCircuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

This case presents neither the ne-\n    cessity nor the occasion to define the duties of defense\n    counsel in those respects . . . .” Missouri v. Frye, ante,\n    at 8.\n  With those words from this and the companion case, the\nCourt today opens a whole new field of constitutionalized\ncriminal procedure: plea-bargaining law. The ordinary\ncriminal process has become too long, too expensive, and\nunpredictable, in no small part as a consequence of an\nintricate federal Code of Criminal Procedure imposed on\nthe States by this Court in pursuit of perfect justice. See\n2                    LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nFriendly, The Bill of Rights as a Code of Criminal Proce­\ndure, 53 Cal. L. Rev. 929 (1965). The Court now moves to\nbring perfection to the alternative in which prosecutors\nand defendants have sought relief. Today’s opinions deal\nwith only two aspects of counsel’s plea-bargaining in­\nadequacy, and leave other aspects (who knows what they\nmight be?) to be worked out in further constitutional\nlitigation that will burden the criminal process. And it\nwould be foolish to think that “constitutional” rules gov­\nerning counsel’s behavior will not be followed by rules\ngoverning the prosecution’s behavior in the plea­\nbargaining process that the Court today announces “ ‘is the\ncriminal justice system,’ ” Frye, ante, at 7 (quoting approv­\ningly from Scott & Stuntz, Plea Bargaining as Contract,\n101 Yale L. J. 1909, 1912 (1992) (hereinafter Scott)). Is it\nconstitutional, for example, for the prosecution to with­\ndraw a plea offer that has already been accepted? Or to\nwithdraw an offer before the defense has had adequate\ntime to consider and accept it? Or to make no plea offer at\nall, even though its case is weak—thereby excluding the\ndefendant from “the criminal justice system”?\n   Anthony Cooper received a full and fair trial, was found\nguilty of all charges by a unanimous jury, and was given\nthe sentence that the law prescribed. The Court nonethe­\nless concludes that Cooper is entitled to some sort of ha­\nbeas corpus relief (perhaps) because his attorney’s allegedly\nincompetent advice regarding a plea offer caused him to\nreceive a full and fair trial. That conclusion is foreclosed\nby our precedents. Even if it were not foreclosed, the\nconstitutional right to effective plea-bargainers that it\nestablishes is at least a new rule of law, which does not\nundermine the Michigan Court of Appeals’ decision and\ntherefore cannot serve as the basis for habeas relief. And\nthe remedy the Court announces—namely, whatever the\nstate trial court in its discretion prescribes, down to and\nincluding no remedy at all—is unheard-of and quite ab­\n                  Cite as: 566 U.

I respectfully\ndissent.\n                               I\n   This case and its companion, Missouri v. Frye, ante,\np. ___, raise relatively straightforward questions about the\nscope of the right to effective assistance of counsel. Our\ncase law originally derived that right from the Due Pro­\ncess Clause, and its guarantee of a fair trial, see United\nStates v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. 140, 147 (2006), but\nthe seminal case of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S.\n668 (1984), located the right within the Sixth Amendment.\nAs the Court notes, ante, at 6, the right to counsel does not\nbegin at trial. It extends to “any stage of the prosecution,\nformal or informal, in court or out, where counsel’s ab­\nsence might derogate from the accused’s right to a fair\ntrial.” United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 226 (1967).\nApplying that principle, we held that the “entry of a guilty\nplea, whether to a misdemeanor or a felony charge, ranks\nas a ‘critical stage’ at which the right to counsel adheres.”\nIowa v. Tovar, 541 U. S. 77, 81 (2004); see also Hill v.\nLockhart, 474 U. S. 52, 58 (1985). And it follows from this\nthat acceptance of a plea offer is a critical stage. That, and\nnothing more, is the point of the Court’s observation in\nPadilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at\n16), that “the negotiation of a plea bargain is a critical\nphase of litigation for purposes of the Sixth Amendment\nright to effective assistance of counsel.” The defendant in\nPadilla had accepted the plea bargain and pleaded guilty,\nabandoning his right to a fair trial; he was entitled to\nadvice of competent counsel before he did so. The Court\nhas never held that the rule articulated in Padilla, Tovar,\nand Hill extends to all aspects of plea negotiations, requir­\ning not just advice of competent counsel before the defend­\nant accepts a plea bargain and pleads guilty, but also the\nadvice of competent counsel before the defendant rejects a\n4                        LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nplea bargain and stands on his constitutional right to a\nfair trial. The latter is a vast departure from our past\ncases, protecting not just the constitutionally prescribed\nright to a fair adjudication of guilt and punishment, but a\njudicially invented right to effective plea bargaining.\n   It is also apparent from Strickland that bad plea bar­\ngaining has nothing to do with ineffective assistance of\ncounsel in the constitutional sense. Strickland explained\nthat “[i]n giving meaning to the requirement [of effective\nassistance], . . . we must take its purpose—to ensure a fair\ntrial—as the guide.” 466 U. S., at 686. Since “the right to\nthe effective assistance of counsel is recognized not for its\nown sake, but because of the effect it has on the ability of\nthe accused to receive a fair trial,” United States v. Cronic,\n466 U. S. 648, 658 (1984), the “benchmark” inquiry in\nevaluating any claim of ineffective assistance is whether\ncounsel’s performance “so undermined the proper func­\ntioning of the adversarial process” that it failed to produce\na reliably “just result.” Strickland, 466 U. S., at 686.\nThat is what Strickland’s requirement of “prejudice” con­\nsists of: Because the right to effective assistance has as its\npurpose the assurance of a fair trial, the right is not in­\nfringed unless counsel’s mistakes call into question the\nbasic justice of a defendant’s conviction or sentence. That\nhas been, until today, entirely clear. A defendant must\nshow “that counsel’s errors were so serious as to deprive\nthe defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is relia­\nble.” Id., at 687.

S., at 694.\nStrickland itself cautioned, however, that its test was not\nto be applied in a mechanical fashion, and that courts\nwere not to divert their “ultimate focus” from “the funda­\nmental fairness of the proceeding whose result is being\nchallenged.” Id., at 696. And until today we have followed\nthat course.\n  In Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U. S. 364 (1993), the defi­\ncient performance at issue was the failure of counsel for a\ndefendant who had been sentenced to death to make an\nobjection that would have produced a sentence of life\n——————\nAmendment right to counsel is to secure a fair trial” (emphasis added));\nBrief for Petitioner 12–21 (same). To destroy that straw man, the\nCourt cites cases in which violations of rights other than the right to\neffective counsel—and, perplexingly, even rights found outside the\nSixth Amendment and the Constitution entirely—were not cured by a\nsubsequent trial. Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254 (1986) (violation of\nequal protection in grand jury selection); Ballard v. United States, 329\nU. S. 187 (1946) (violation of statutory scheme providing that women\nserve on juries); Stirone v. United States, 361 U. S. 212 (1960) (violation\nof Fifth Amendment right to indictment by grand jury). Unlike the\nright to effective counsel, no showing of prejudice is required to make\nviolations of the rights at issue in Vasquez, Ballard, and Stirone com­\nplete. See Vasquez, supra, at 263–264 (“[D]iscrimination in the grand\njury undermines the structural integrity of the criminal tribunal itself,\nand is not amenable to harmless-error review”); Ballard, supra, at 195\n(“[R]eversible error does not depend on a showing of prejudice in an\nindividual case”); Stirone, supra, at 217 (“Deprivation of such a basic\nright is far too serious to be treated as nothing more than a variance\nand then dismissed as harmless error”). Those cases are thus irrele­\nvant to the question presented here, which is whether a defendant can\nestablish prejudice under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668\n(1984), while conceding the fairness of his conviction, sentence, and\nappeal.\n6                        LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nimprisonment instead. The objection was fully supported\nby then-extant Circuit law, so that the sentencing court\nwould have been compelled to sustain it, producing a life\nsentence that principles of double jeopardy would likely\nmake final. See id., at 383–385 (Stevens, J., dissenting);\nBullington v. Missouri, 451 U. S. 430 (1981). By the time\nFretwell’s claim came before us, however, the Circuit law\nhad been overruled in light of one of our cases. We deter­\nmined that a prejudice analysis “focusing solely on mere\noutcome determination, without attention to whether the\nresult of the proceeding was fundamentally unfair or\nunreliable,” would be defective. Fretwell, 506 U. S., at\n369. Because counsel’s error did not “deprive the defend­\nant of any substantive or procedural right to which the\nlaw entitles him,” the defendant’s sentencing proceeding\nwas fair and its result was reliable, even though counsel’s\nerror may have affected its outcome. Id., at 372. In Wil-\nliams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 391–393 (2000), we ex­\nplained that even though Fretwell did not mechanically\napply an outcome-based test for prejudice, its reasoning\nwas perfectly consistent with Strickland. “Fretwell’s\ncounsel had not deprived him of any substantive or pro­\ncedural right to which the law entitled him.” 529 U. S.\nat 392.2\n——————\n   2 Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U. S. 365 (1986), cited by the Court,\n\nante, at 10–11, does not contradict this principle. That case, which\npredated Fretwell and Williams, considered whether our holding that\nFourth Amendment claims fully litigated in state court cannot be\nraised in federal habeas “should be extended to Sixth Amendment\nclaims of ineffective assistance of counsel where the principal allegation\nand manifestation of inadequate representation is counsel’s failure to\nfile a timely motion to suppress evidence allegedly obtained in violation\nof the Fourth Amendment.” 477 U. S., at 368. Our negative answer to\nthat question had nothing to do with the issue here. The parties in\nKimmelman had not raised the question “whether the admission of\nillegally seized but reliable evidence can ever constitute ‘prejudice’\nunder Strickland”—a question similar to the one presented here—and\n                      Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      7\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n  Those precedents leave no doubt about the answer to\nthe question presented here. As the Court itself observes,\na criminal defendant has no right to a plea bargain. Ante,\nat 9. “[T]here is no constitutional right to plea bargain;\nthe prosecutor need not do so if he prefers to go to trial.”\nWeatherford v. Bursey, 429 U. S. 545, 561 (1977). Coun­\nsel’s mistakes in this case thus did not “deprive the de­\nfendant of a substantive or procedural right to which the\nlaw entitles him,” Williams, supra, at 393. Far from be-\ning “beside the point,” ante, at 9, that is critical to correct\napplication of our precedents. Like Fretwell, this case\n“concerns the unusual circumstance where the defendant\nattempts to demonstrate prejudice based on considerations\nthat, as a matter of law, ought not inform the inquiry,”\n506 U. S., at 373 (O’Connor, J., concurring); he claims\n“that he might have been denied ‘a right the law simply\ndoes not recognize,’ ” id., at 375 (same). Strickland,\nFretwell, and Williams all instruct that the pure outcome­\nbased test on which the Court relies is an erroneous\nmeasure of cognizable prejudice. In ignoring Strickland’s\n“ultimate focus . . . on the fundamental fairness of the\nproceeding whose result is being challenged,” 466 U. S., at\n696, the Court has lost the forest for the trees, leading it to\naccept what we have previously rejected, the “novel argu­\nment that constitutional rights are infringed by trying the\ndefendant rather than accepting his plea of guilty.”\nWeatherford, supra, at 561.\n——————\nthe Court therefore did not address it. Id., at 391 (Powell, J., concur­\nring in judgment); see also id., at 380. Kimmelman made clear, how­\never, how the answer to that question is to be determined: “The essence\nof an ineffective-assistance claim is that counsel’s unprofessional errors\nso upset the adversarial balance between defense and prosecution that\nthe trial was rendered unfair and the verdict rendered suspect,” id., at 374\n(emphasis added). “Only those habeas petitioners who can prove under\nStrickland that they have been denied a fair trial . . . will be granted the\nwrit,” id., at 382 (emphasis added). In short, Kimmelman’s only rele­\nvance is to prove the Court’s opinion wrong.\n8                   LAFLER v. COOPER \n\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting \n\n\n                             II\n\n   Novelty alone is the second, independent reason why the\nCourt’s decision is wrong. This case arises on federal\nhabeas, and hence is governed by the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). Since, as\nthe Court acknowledges, the Michigan Court of Appeals\nadjudicated Cooper’s ineffective-assistance claim on the\nmerits, AEDPA bars federal courts from granting habeas\nrelief unless that court’s decision was “contrary to, or\ninvolved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab­\nlished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\nof the United States.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). Yet the\nCourt concludes that §2254(d)(1) does not bar relief here,\nbecause “[b]y failing to apply Strickland to assess the\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim respondent raised,\nthe state court’s adjudication was contrary to clearly\nestablished federal law.” Ante, at 15. That is not so.\n   The relevant portion of the Michigan Court of Appeals\ndecision reads as follows:\n       “To establish ineffective assistance, the defendant\n    must demonstrate that his counsel’s performance fell\n    below an objective standard of reasonableness and\n    that counsel’s representation so prejudiced the de­\n    fendant that he was deprived of a fair trial. With\n    respect to the prejudice aspect of the test, the defend-\n    ant must demonstrate a reasonable probability that,\n    but for counsel’s errors, the result of the proceed-\n    ings would have been different, and that the at-\n    tendant proceedings were fundamentally unfair and\n    unreliable.\n       “Defendant challenges the trial court’s finding after\n    a Ginther hearing that defense counsel provided effec­\n    tive assistance to defendant during the plea bargain­\n    ing process. He contends that defense counsel failed\n    to convey the benefits of the plea offer to him and ig­\n    nored his desire to plead guilty, and that these fail­\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n    ures led him to reject a plea offer that he now wishes\n    to accept. However, the record shows that defendant\n    knowingly and intelligently rejected two plea offers\n    and chose to go to trial. The record fails to support de­\n    fendant’s contentions that defense counsel’s represen­\n    tation was ineffective because he rejected a defense\n    based on [a] claim of self-defense and because he did\n    not obtain a more favorable plea bargain for defend­\n    ant.” People v. Cooper, No. 250583 (Mar. 15, 2005),\n    App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a, 2005 WL 599740, *1\n    (per curiam) (footnote and citations omitted).\n   The first paragraph above, far from ignoring Strickland,\nrecites its standard with a good deal more accuracy than\nthe Court’s opinion. The second paragraph, which is\npresumably an application of the standard recited in the\nfirst, says that “defendant knowingly and intelligently\nrejected two plea offers and chose to go to trial.” This can\nbe regarded as a denial that there was anything “funda­\nmentally unfair” about Cooper’s conviction and sentence,\nso that no Strickland prejudice had been shown. On the\nother hand, the entire second paragraph can be regarded\nas a contention that Cooper’s claims of inadequate repre­\nsentation were unsupported by the record. The state\ncourt’s analysis was admittedly not a model of clarity, but\nfederal habeas corpus is a “guard against extreme mal­\nfunctions in the state criminal justice systems,” not a\nlicense to penalize a state court for its opinion-writing\ntechnique. Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 13) (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nCourt’s readiness to find error in the Michigan court’s\nopinion is “inconsistent with the presumption that state\ncourts know and follow the law,” Woodford v. Visciotti, 537\nU. S. 19, 24 (2002) (per curiam), a presumption borne out\nhere by the state court’s recitation of the correct legal\nstandard.\n   Since it is ambiguous whether the state court’s holding\n10                    LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nwas based on a lack of prejudice or rather the court’s\nfactual determination that there had been no deficient\nperformance, to provide relief under AEDPA this Court\nmust conclude that both holdings would have been unrea­\nsonable applications of clearly established law. See Premo\nv. Moore, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 7). The first\nis impossible of doing, since this Court has never held that\na defendant in Cooper’s position can establish Strickland\nprejudice. The Sixth Circuit thus violated AEDPA in\ngranting habeas relief, and the Court now does the same.\n                              III\n   It is impossible to conclude discussion of today’s ex­\ntraordinary opinion without commenting upon the remedy\nit provides for the unconstitutional conviction. It is a\nremedy unheard-of in American jurisprudence—and, I\nwould be willing to bet, in the jurisprudence of any other\ncountry.\n   The Court requires Michigan to “reoffer the plea agree­\nment” that was rejected because of bad advice from coun­\nsel. Ante, at 16. That would indeed be a powerful remedy—\nbut for the fact that Cooper’s acceptance of that re-\noffered agreement is not conclusive. Astoundingly, “the\nstate trial court can then exercise its discretion in deter­\nmining whether to vacate the convictions and resentence\nrespondent pursuant to the plea agreement, to vacate only\nsome of the convictions and resentence respondent accord­\ningly, or to leave the convictions and sentence from trial\nundisturbed.” Ibid. (emphasis added).\n   Why, one might ask, require a “reoffer” of the plea\nagreement, and its acceptance by the defendant? If the\ndistrict court finds (as a necessary element, supposedly, of\nStrickland prejudice) that Cooper would have accepted the\noriginal offer, and would thereby have avoided trial and\nconviction, why not skip the reoffer-and-reacceptance\nminuet and simply leave it to the discretion of the state\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ntrial court what the remedy shall be? The answer, of\ncourse, is camouflage. Trial courts, after all, regularly\naccept or reject plea agreements, so there seems to be\nnothing extraordinary about their accepting or rejecting\nthe new one mandated by today’s decision. But the ac­\nceptance or rejection of a plea agreement that has no\nstatus whatever under the United States Constitution is\nworlds apart from what this is: “discretionary” specifi­\ncation of a remedy for an unconstitutional criminal\nconviction.\n   To be sure, the Court asserts that there are “factors”\nwhich bear upon (and presumably limit) exercise of this\ndiscretion—factors that it is not prepared to specify in full,\nmuch less assign some determinative weight. “Principles\nelaborated over time in decisions of state and federal\ncourts, and in statutes and rules” will (in the Court’s rosy\nview) sort all that out. Ante, at 13. I find it extraordinary\nthat “statutes and rules” can specify the remedy for a\ncriminal defendant’s unconstitutional conviction. Or that\nthe remedy for an unconstitutional conviction should ever\nbe subject at all to a trial judge’s discretion. Or, finally,\nthat the remedy could ever include no remedy at all.\n   I suspect that the Court’s squeamishness in fashioning a\nremedy, and the incoherence of what it comes up with, is\nattributable to its realization, deep down, that there is no\nreal constitutional violation here anyway. The defendant\nhas been fairly tried, lawfully convicted, and properly\nsentenced, and any “remedy” provided for this will do\nnothing but undo the just results of a fair adversarial\nprocess.\n                            IV\n  In many—perhaps most—countries of the world, American­\nstyle plea bargaining is forbidden in cases as serious\nas this one, even for the purpose of obtaining testimony\nthat enables conviction of a greater malefactor, much less\n12                    LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nfor the purpose of sparing the expense of trial. See, e.g.,\nWorld Plea Bargaining 344, 363–366 (S. Thaman ed.\n2010). In Europe, many countries adhere to what they\naptly call the “legality principle” by requiring prosecutors\nto charge all prosecutable offenses, which is typically\nincompatible with the practice of charge-bargaining. See,\ne.g., id., at xxii; Langbein, Land Without Plea Bargaining:\nHow the Germans Do It, 78 Mich. L. Rev. 204, 210–211\n(1979) (describing the “Legalitätsprinzip,” or rule of com­\npulsory prosecution, in Germany). Such a system reflects\nan admirable belief that the law is the law, and those who\nbreak it should pay the penalty provided.\n   In the United States, we have plea bargaining a-plenty,\nbut until today it has been regarded as a necessary evil. It\npresents grave risks of prosecutorial overcharging that\neffectively compels an innocent defendant to avoid massive\nrisk by pleading guilty to a lesser offense; and for guilty\ndefendants it often—perhaps usually—results in a sen­\ntence well below what the law prescribes for the actual\ncrime. But even so, we accept plea bargaining because\nmany believe that without it our long and expensive pro­\ncess of criminal trial could not sustain the burden imposed\non it, and our system of criminal justice would grind to a\nhalt. See, e.g., Alschuler, Plea Bargaining and its History,\n79 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 38 (1979).\n   Today, however, the Supreme Court of the United\nStates elevates plea bargaining from a necessary evil to\na constitutional entitlement. It is no longer a somewhat\nembarrassing adjunct to our criminal justice system;\nrather, as the Court announces in the companion case to\nthis one, “ ‘it is the criminal justice system.’ ” Frye, ante, at\n7 (quoting approvingly from Scott 1912). Thus, even\nthough there is no doubt that the respondent here is guilty\nof the offense with which he was charged; even though he\nhas received the exorbitant gold standard of American\njustice—a full-dress criminal trial with its innumerable\n                    Cite as: 566 U.

The Court today embraces the sporting­\nchance theory of criminal law, in which the State functions\nlike a conscientious casino-operator, giving each player a\nfair chance to beat the house, that is, to serve less time\nthan the law says he deserves. And when a player is\nexcluded from the tables, his constitutional rights have\nbeen violated. I do not subscribe to that theory. No one\nshould, least of all the Justices of the Supreme Court.\n                        *      *    *\n   Today’s decision upends decades of our cases, violates a\nfederal statute, and opens a whole new boutique of consti­\ntutional jurisprudence (“plea-bargaining law”) without\neven specifying the remedies the boutique offers. The\nresult in the present case is the undoing of an adjudicatory\nprocess that worked exactly as it is supposed to. Released\nfelon Anthony Cooper, who shot repeatedly and gravely\ninjured a woman named Kali Mundy, was tried and con­\nvicted for his crimes by a jury of his peers, and given a\npunishment that Michigan’s elected representatives have\ndeemed appropriate. Nothing about that result is unfair\nor unconstitutional. To the contrary, it is wonderfully\njust, and infinitely superior to the trial-by-bargain that\ntoday’s opinion affords constitutional status. I respectfully\ndissent.\n——————\n  3 See People v.

ANTHONY COOPER\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                       [March 21, 2012]\n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO, dissenting.\n   For the reasons set out in Parts I and II of JUSTICE\nSCALIA’s dissent, the Court’s holding in this case mis-\napplies our ineffective-assistance-of-counsel case law and\nviolates the requirements of the Antiterrorism and Effec-\ntive Death Penalty Act of 1996. Respondent received a\ntrial that was free of any identified constitutional error,\nand, as a result, there is no basis for concluding that\nrespondent suffered prejudice and certainly not for grant-\ning habeas relief.\n   The weakness in the Court’s analysis is highlighted by\nits opaque discussion of the remedy that is appropriate\nwhen a plea offer is rejected due to defective legal repre-\nsentation. If a defendant’s Sixth Amendment rights are\nviolated when deficient legal advice about a favorable plea\noffer causes the opportunity for that bargain to be lost, the\nonly logical remedy is to give the defendant the benefit of\nthe favorable deal. But such a remedy would cause seri-\nous injustice in many instances, as I believe the Court\ntacitly recognizes. The Court therefore eschews the only\nlogical remedy and relies on the lower courts to exercise\nsound discretion in determining what is to be done.\n   Time will tell how this works out. The Court, for its\npart, finds it unnecessary to define “the boundaries of\nproper discretion” in today’s opinion. Ante, at 13. In my\nview, requiring the prosecution to renew an old plea offer\n2                   LAFLER v. COOPER\n\n                    ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwould represent an abuse of discretion in at least two\ncircumstances: first, when important new information\nabout a defendant’s culpability comes to light after the\noffer is rejected, and, second, when the rejection of the\nplea offer results in a substantial expenditure of scarce\nprosecutorial or judicial resources.\n   The lower court judges who must implement today’s\nholding may—and I hope, will—do so in a way that miti-\ngates its potential to produce unjust results. But I would\nnot depend on these judges to come to the rescue. The\nCourt’s interpretation of the Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel is unsound, and I therefore respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/625833/", "sha1": "5eaab6ab09969e33cac7d5dd3f916c87337c98b5", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2012-03-21T07:12:48"}
