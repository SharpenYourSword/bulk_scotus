HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 10–1211. Argued January 18, 2012—Decided March 28, 2012\nBefore passage of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Re-\n  sponsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), United States immigration law\n  provided deportation hearings for excludable aliens who had already\n  entered the United States and exclusion hearings for excludable al-\n  iens seeking entry into the United States. Lawful permanent resi-\n  dents were not regarded as making an “entry,” upon their return\n  from “innocent, casual, and brief excursion[s] . . . outside this coun-\n  try’s borders.” Rosenberg v. Fleuti, 374 U. S. 449, 462. In IIRIRA,\n  Congress abolished the distinction between exclusion and deportation\n  procedures, creating a uniform “removal” proceeding. See 8 U. S. C.\n  §§1229, 1229a. Congress made “admission” the key word, and de-\n  fined “admission” to mean “the lawful entry of the alien into the\n  United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration\n  officer.” §1101(a)(13)(A). This alteration, the Board of Immigration\n  Appeals (BIA) determined, superseded Fleuti. Thus, lawful perma-\n  nent residents returning from a trip abroad are now regarded as\n  seeking admission if they have “committed an offense identified in\n  section 1182(a)(2),” §1101(a)(13)(C)(v), including, as relevant here, “a\n  crime involving moral turpitude . . . or conspiracy to commit such a\n  crime,” §1182(a)(2)(A)(i).\n     Petitioner Vartelas, a lawful permanent resident of the United\n  States since 1989, pleaded guilty to a felony (conspiring to make a\n  counterfeit security) in 1994, and served a 4-month prison sentence.\n  In the years after his conviction, and even after IIRIRA’s passage,\n  Vartelas regularly traveled to Greece to visit his aging parents. In\n  2003, when Vartelas returned from a week-long trip to Greece, an\n  immigration officer classified him as an alien seeking “admission”\n  based on his 1994 conviction. At Vartelas’ removal proceedings, his\n2                        VARTELAS v. HOLDER\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    attorneys conceded removability and requested discretionary relief\n    under former §212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The\n    Immigration Judge denied the request for relief, and ordered Var-\n    telas removed to Greece. The BIA affirmed. In 2008, Vartelas filed\n    with the BIA a timely motion to reopen the removal proceedings, al-\n    leging that his previous attorneys were ineffective for, among other\n    lapses, conceding his removability. He sought to withdraw the con-\n    cession of removability on the ground that IIRIRA’s new “admission”\n    provision did not reach back to deprive him of lawful resident status\n    based on his pre-IIRIRA conviction. The BIA denied the motion. The\n    Second Circuit affirmed. Rejecting Vartelas’ argument that IIRIRA\n    operated prospectively and therefore did not govern his case, the Se-\n    cond Circuit reasoned that he had not relied on the prior legal regime\n    at the time he committed the disqualifying crime.\nHeld: The impact of Vartelas’ brief travel abroad on his permanent res-\n ident status is determined not by IIRIRA, but by the legal regime in\n force at the time of his conviction. Pp. 7–17.\n    (a) Under the principle against retroactive legislation invoked by\n Vartelas, courts read laws as prospective in application unless Con-\n gress has unambiguously instructed retroactivity. See Landgraf v.\n USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 263. The presumption against ret-\n roactive legislation “embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than\n our Republic.” Id., at 265. Numerous decisions of this Court have\n invoked Justice Story’s formulation for determining when a law’s ret-\n rospective application would collide with the doctrine, namely, as rel-\n evant here, when such application would “attac[h] a new disability, in\n respect to transactions or considerations already past,” Society for\n Propagation of Gospel v. Wheeler, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Cas.</span> <span class=\"page\">756</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 767. See, e.g., INS\n v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 321; Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex\n rel. Schumer, 520 U. S. 939, 947; Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 283. Var-\n telas urges that applying IIRIRA to him would attach a “new disabil-\n ity,” effectively a ban on travel outside the United States, “in respect\n to” past events, specifically, his offense, guilty plea, conviction, and\n punishment, all occurring prior to IIRIRA’s passage.\n    Congress did not expressly prescribe §1101(a)(13)’s temporal reach.\n The Court, therefore, proceeds to the dispositive question whether\n application of IIRIRA’s travel restraint to Vartelas “would have ret-\n roactive effect” Congress did not authorize. See id., at 280. Vartelas\n presents a firm case for application of the antiretroactivity principle.\n Beyond genuine doubt §1101(a)(13)(C)(v)’s restraint on lawful per-\n manent residents like Vartelas ranks as a “new disability.” Once\n able to journey abroad to, e.g., fulfill religious obligations or respond\n to family emergencies, they now face potential banishment, a severe\n sanction. See, e.g., Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___. The Gov-\n                    Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nernment suggests that Vartelas could have avoided any adverse con-\nsequences if he simply stayed at home in the United States. But los-\ning the ability to travel abroad is itself a harsh penalty, made all the\nmore devastating if it means enduring separation from close family\nmembers.\n   This Court has rejected arguments for retroactivity in similar\ncases, see Chew Heong v. United States, 112 U. S. 536, 559; St. Cyr,\n533 U. S., at 321–323, and in cases in which the loss at stake was less\nmomentous, see Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 280–286; Hughes Aircraft,\n520 U. S., at 946–950. Pp. 7–11.\n   (b) The Court finds disingenuous the Government’s argument that\nno retroactive effect is involved in this case because the relevant\nevent is the alien’s post-IIRIRA return to the United States. Var-\ntelas’ return occasioned his treatment as a new entrant, but the rea-\nson for his “new disability” was his pre-IIRIRA conviction. That past\nmisconduct is the wrongful activity targeted by §1101(a)(13)(C)(v).\nPp. 11–13.\n   (c) In determining that the change IIRIRA wrought had no retroac-\ntive effect, the Second Circuit homed in on the words “committed an\noffense” in §1101(a)(13)(C)(v). It reasoned that reliance on the prior\nlaw is essential to application of the antiretroactivity principle, and\nthat Vartelas did not commit his crime in reliance on immigration\nlaws. This reasoning is doubly flawed. A party is not required to\nshow reliance on the prior law in structuring his conduct. See, e.g.,\nLandgraf, 511 U. S., at 282, n. 35. In any event, Vartelas likely re-\nlied on then-existing immigration law, and this likelihood strength-\nens the case for reading a newly enacted law prospectively. St. Cyr is\nillustrative. There, a lawful permanent resident pleaded guilty to a\ncriminal charge that made him deportable. Under the immigration\nlaw in effect when he was convicted, he would have been eligible to\napply for a waiver of deportation. But his removal proceeding was\ncommenced after IIRIRA withdrew that dispensation. Disallowance\nof discretionary waivers attached a new disability to past conduct,\n533 U. S., at 321. Aliens like St. Cyr “almost certainly relied upon\nth[e] likelihood [of receiving discretionary relief] in deciding [to plead\nguilty, thereby] forgo[ing] their right to a trial,” id., at 325. Because\napplying the IIRIRA withdrawal to St. Cyr would have an “obvious\nand severe retroactive effect,” ibid., and Congress made no such in-\ntention plain, ibid., n. 55, the prior law governed St. Cyr’s case. Var-\ntelas’ case is at least as clear as St. Cyr’s for declining to apply a new\nlaw retroactively. St. Cyr could seek only the Attorney General’s dis-\ncretionary dispensation, while Vartelas, under Fleuti, was free, with-\nout seeking an official’s permission, to make short trips to see and as-\nsist his parents in Greece.

He\npleaded guilty to a felony (conspiring to make a counterfeit\nsecurity) in 1994, and served a prison sentence of four\nmonths for that offense. Vartelas traveled to Greece in\n2003 to visit his parents. On his return to the United\nStates a week later, he was treated as an inadmissible\nalien and placed in removal proceedings. Under the law\ngoverning at the time of Vartelas’ plea, an alien in his\nsituation could travel abroad for brief periods without\njeopardizing his resident alien status. See 8 U. S. C.\n§1101(a)(13) (1988 ed.), as construed in Rosenberg v.\nFleuti, 374 U. S. 449 (1963).\n   In 1996, Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration\nReform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), 110\nStat. 3009–546. That Act effectively precluded foreign\ntravel by lawful permanent residents who had a conviction\nlike Vartelas’. Under IIRIRA, such aliens, on return from\na sojourn abroad, however brief, may be permanently\nremoved from the United States.            See 8 U. S. C.\n2                   VARTELAS v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n§1101(a)(13)(C)(v); §1182(a)(2).\n   This case presents a question of retroactivity not ad-\ndressed by Congress: As to a lawful permanent resident\nconvicted of a crime before the effective date of IIRIRA,\nwhich regime governs, the one in force at the time of\nthe conviction, or IIRIRA? If the former, Vartelas’ brief\ntrip abroad would not disturb his lawful permanent resi-\ndent status. If the latter, he may be denied reentry. We\nconclude that the relevant provision of IIRIRA,\n§1101(a)(13)(C)(v), attached a new disability (denial of\nreentry) in respect to past events (Vartelas’ pre-IIRIRA\noffense, plea, and conviction). Guided by the deeply rooted\npresumption against retroactive legislation, we hold that\n§1101(a)(13)(C)(v) does not apply to Vartelas’ conviction.\nThe impact of Vartelas’ brief travel abroad on his per-\nmanent resident status is therefore determined not by\nIIRIRA, but by the legal regime in force at the time of his\nconviction.\n                              I\n                                A\n  Before IIRIRA’s passage, United States immigration law\nestablished “two types of proceedings in which aliens can\nbe denied the hospitality of the United States: deportation\nhearings and exclusion hearings.” Landon v. Plasencia,\n459 U. S. 21, 25 (1982). Exclusion hearings were held for\ncertain aliens seeking entry to the United States, and\ndeportation hearings were held for certain aliens who had\nalready entered this country. See ibid.\n  Under this regime, “entry” into the United States was\ndefined as “any coming of an alien into the United States,\nfrom a foreign port or place.” 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(13) (1988\ned.). The statute, however, provided an exception for\nlawful permanent residents; aliens lawfully residing here\nwere not regarded as making an “entry” if their “departure\nto a foreign port or place . . . was not intended or reasona-\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbly to be expected by [them] or [their] presence in a foreign\nport or place . . . was not voluntary.” Ibid. Interpreting\nthis cryptic provision, we held in Fleuti, 374 U. S., at 461–\n462, that Congress did not intend to exclude aliens long\nresident in the United States upon their return from\n“innocent, casual, and brief excursion[s] . . . outside this\ncountry’s borders.” Instead, the Court determined, Con-\ngress meant to rank a once-permanent resident as a new\nentrant only when the foreign excursion “meaningfully\ninterrupt[ed] . . . the alien’s [U. S.] residence.” Id., at 462.\nAbsent such “disrupti[on]” of the alien’s residency, the\nalien would not be “subject . . . to the consequences of an\n‘entry’ into the country on his return.” Ibid.1\n   In IIRIRA, Congress abolished the distinction between\nexclusion and deportation procedures and created a uni-\nform proceeding known as “removal.” See 8 U. S. C.\n§§1229, 1229a; Judulang v. Holder, 565 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 1–2). Congress made “admission” the\nkey word, and defined admission to mean “the lawful\nentry of the alien into the United States after inspec-\ntion and authorization by an immigration officer.”\n§1101(a)(13)(A). This alteration, the Board of Immigration\nAppeals (BIA) determined, superseded Fleuti. See In re\nCollado-Munoz, 21 I. & N. Dec. 1061, 1065–1066 (1998)\n(en banc).2 Thus, lawful permanent residents returning\n——————\n  1 The dissent appears driven, in no small measure, by its dim view of\n\nthe Court’s opinion in Fleuti. See post, at 6 (“same instinct” operative\nin Fleuti and this case).\n  2 The BIA determined that the Fleuti doctrine no longer held sway\n\nbecause it was rooted in the “no longer existent definition of ‘entry’ in\n[the INA].” 21 I. & N. Dec., at 1065. The Board also noted that “Con-\ngress . . . amended the law to expressly preserve some, but not all, of\nthe Fleuti doctrine” when it provided that a lawful permanent resident\nabsent from the United States for less than 180 days would not be\nregarded as seeking an admission except in certain enumerated cir-\ncumstances, among them, prior commission of a crime of moral turpi-\ntude. See ibid. (citing 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(13)(C)(ii)).\n4                       VARTELAS v. HOLDER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npost-IIRIRA, like Vartelas, may be required to “ ‘see[k] an\nadmission’ into the United States, without regard to\nwhether the alien’s departure from the United States\nmight previously have been ranked as ‘brief, casual, and\ninnocent’ under the Fleuti doctrine.” Id., at 1066.\n   An alien seeking “admission” to the United States is\nsubject to various requirements, see, e.g., §1181(a), and\ncannot gain entry if she is deemed “inadmissible” on any of\nthe numerous grounds set out in the immigration stat-\nutes, see §1182. Under IIRIRA, lawful permanent residents\nare regarded as seeking admission into the United States\nif they fall into any of six enumerated categories.\n§1101(a)(13)(C). Relevant here, the fifth of these catego-\nries covers aliens who “ha[ve] committed an offense identi-\nfied in section 1182(a)(2) of this title.” §1101(a)(13)(C)(v).\nOffenses in this category include “a crime involving moral\nturpitude (other than a purely political offense) or an\nattempt or conspiracy to commit such a crime.”\n§1182(a)(2)(A)(i).\n   In sum, before IIRIRA, lawful permanent residents who\nhad committed a crime of moral turpitude could, under\nthe Fleuti doctrine, return from brief trips abroad with-\nout applying for admission to the United States. Under\nIIRIRA, such residents are subject to admission proce-\ndures, and, potentially, to removal from the United States\non grounds of inadmissibility.3\n——————\n  Vartelas does not challenge the ruling in Collado-Munoz. We there-\nfore assume, but do not decide, that IIRIRA’s amendments to\n§1101(a)(13)(A) abrogated Fleuti.\n  3 Although IIRIRA created a uniform removal procedure for both\n\nexcludable and deportable aliens, the list of criminal offenses that\nsubject aliens to exclusion remains separate from the list of offenses\nthat render an alien deportable. These lists are “sometimes overlap-\nping and sometimes divergent.” Judulang v. Holder, 565 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 2). Pertinent here, although a single crime involving\nmoral turpitude may render an alien inadmissible, it would not render\nher deportable. See 8 U. S. C. §1182(a)(2) (listing excludable crimes);\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

Originally admit-\nted on a student visa issued in 1979, Vartelas became a\nlawful permanent resident in 1989. He currently lives in\nthe New York area and works as a sales manager for a\nroofing company.\n   In 1992, Vartelas opened an auto body shop in Queens,\nNew York. One of his business partners used the shop’s\nphotocopier to make counterfeit travelers’ checks. Var-\ntelas helped his partner perforate the sheets into individ-\nual checks, but Vartelas did not sell the checks or receive\nany money from the venture. In 1994, he pleaded guilty to\nconspiracy to make or possess counterfeit securities, in\nviolation of 18 U. S. C. §371. He was sentenced to four\nmonths’ incarceration, followed by two years’ supervised\nrelease.\n   Vartelas regularly traveled to Greece to visit his aging\nparents in the years after his 1994 conviction; even after\nthe passage of IIRIRA in 1996, his return to the United\nStates from these visits remained uneventful. In January\n2003, however, when Vartelas returned from a week-long\ntrip to Greece, an immigration officer classified him as an\nalien seeking “admission.” The officer based this classi-\nfication on Vartelas’ 1994 conviction. See United States\nex rel. Volpe v. Smith, 289 U. S. 422, 423 (1933) (counter-\nfeiting ranks as a crime of moral turpitude).\n   At Vartelas’ removal proceedings, his initial attorney\nconceded removability, and requested discretionary relief\nfrom removal under the former §212(c) of the Immigration\nand Nationality Act (INA). See 8 U. S. C. §1182(c) (1994\ned.) (repealed 1996). This attorney twice failed to appear\nfor hearings and once failed to submit a requested brief.\nVartelas engaged a new attorney, who continued to con-\n——————\n§1227(a)(2) (listing deportable crimes).\n6                   VARTELAS v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncede removability and to request discretionary relief. The\nImmigration Judge denied the request for relief, and\nordered Vartelas removed to Greece. The BIA affirmed\nthe Immigration Judge’s decision.\n   In July 2008, Vartelas filed with the BIA a timely mo-\ntion to reopen the removal proceedings, alleging that his\nprevious attorneys were ineffective for, among other\nlapses, conceding his removability. He sought to withdraw\nthe concession of removability on the ground that IIRIRA’s\nnew “admission” provision, codified at §1101(a)(13), did\nnot reach back to deprive him of lawful resident status\nbased on his pre-IIRIRA conviction. The BIA denied the\nmotion, declaring that Vartelas had not been prejudiced by\nhis lawyers’ performance, for no legal authority prevented\nthe application of IIRIRA to Vartelas’ pre-IIRIRA conduct.\n   The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit af-\nfirmed the BIA’s decision, agreeing that Vartelas had\nfailed to show he was prejudiced by his attorneys’ alleged-\nly ineffective performance. Rejecting Vartelas’ argument\nthat IIRIRA operated prospectively and therefore did not\ngovern his case, the Second Circuit reasoned that he had\nnot relied on the prior legal regime at the time he commit-\nted the disqualifying crime. See 620 F. 3d 108, 118–120\n(2010).\n   In so ruling, the Second Circuit created a split with two\nother Circuits. The Fourth and Ninth Circuits have held\nthat the new §1101(a)(13) may not be applied to lawful\npermanent residents who committed crimes listed in\n§1182 (among them, crimes of moral turpitude) prior to\nIIRIRA’s enactment. See Olatunji v. Ashcroft, 387 F. 3d\n383 (CA4 2004); Camins v. Gonzales, 500 F. 3d 872 (CA9\n2007). We granted certiorari, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), to\nresolve the conflict among the Circuits.\n                              II\n    As earlier explained, see supra, at 2–4, pre-IIRIRA, a\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

Under\nIIRIRA, on return from foreign travel, such an alien is\ntreated as a new arrival to our shores, and may be re-\nmoved from the United States. Vartelas does not question\nCongress’ authority to restrict reentry in this manner.\nNor does he contend that Congress could not do so retroac-\ntively. Instead, he invokes the principle against retro-\nactive legislation, under which courts read laws as pro-\nspective in application unless Congress has unambiguously\ninstructed retroactivity.

Id., at 266. Numerous decisions of this Court\nrepeat the classic formulation Justice Story penned for\ndetermining when retrospective application of a law would\ncollide with the doctrine. It would do so, Story stated,\nwhen such application would “tak[e] away or impai[r]\nvested rights acquired under existing laws, or creat[e] a\nnew obligation, impos[e] a new duty, or attac[h] a new\ndisability, in respect to transactions or considerations\nalready past.”      Society for Propagation of Gospel v.\nWheeler, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

That is a bold\n8                      VARTELAS v. HOLDER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Vartelas urges that applying IIRIRA to him, rather than\nthe law that existed at the time of his conviction, would\nattach a “new disability,” effectively a ban on travel out-\nside the United States, “in respect to [events] . . . already\npast,” i.e., his offense, guilty plea, conviction, and punish-\nment, all occurring prior to the passage of IIRIRA. In\nevaluating Vartelas’ argument, we note first a matter not\ndisputed by the Government: Congress did not expressly\nprescribe the temporal reach of the IIRIRA provision in\nquestion, 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(13). See Landgraf, 511 U. S.,\nat 280 (Court asks first “whether Congress has expressly\nprescribed [new §1101(a)(13)’s] proper reach”); Brief for\nRespondent 11 (Court’s holding in INS v. St. Cyr, 533\nU. S., at 317–320, “compels the conclusion that Congress\nhas not ‘expressly prescribed the statute’s proper reach’ ”\n(quoting Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 280)).5 Several other\nprovisions of IIRIRA, in contrast to §1101(a)(13), expressly\ndirect retroactive application, e.g., 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)\n(IIRIRA’s amendment of the “aggravated felony” definition\napplies expressly to “conviction[s] . . . entered before, on,\nor after” the statute’s enactment date (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). See St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 319–320, and\nn. 43 (setting out further examples). Accordingly, we\nproceed to the dispositive question whether, as Vartelas\nmaintains, application of IIRIRA’s travel restraint to him\n“would have retroactive effect” Congress did not authorize.\nSee Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 280.\n   Vartelas presents a firm case for application of the\nantiretroactivity principle. Neither his sentence, nor the\n——————\nstatement in view of this Court’s many references to Justice Story’s\nformulation in cases involving the presumption that statutes operate\nonly prospectively in the absence of a clear congressional statement to\nthe contrary.\n   5 In St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 317–320, we rejected the Government’s\n\ncontention that Congress directed retroactive application of IIRIRA in\nits entirety.\n                      Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      9\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nimmigration law in effect when he was convicted and\nsentenced, blocked him from occasional visits to his par-\nents in Greece. Current §1101(a)(13)(C)(v), if applied to\nhim, would thus attach “a new disability” to conduct over\nand done well before the provision’s enactment.\n   Beyond genuine doubt, we note, the restraint\n§1101(a)(13)(C)(v) places on lawful permanent residents\nlike Vartelas ranks as a “new disability.” Once able to\njourney abroad to fulfill religious obligations, attend fu-\nnerals and weddings of family members, tend to vital\nfinancial interests, or respond to family emergencies,\npermanent residents situated as Vartelas is now face\npotential banishment. We have several times recognized\nthe severity of that sanction. See, e.g., Padilla v. Ken-\ntucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 8–9, 16).\n   It is no answer to say, as the Government suggests, that\nVartelas could have avoided any adverse consequences if\nhe simply stayed at home in the United States, his resi-\ndence for 24 years prior to his 2003 visit to his parents in\nGreece. See Brief in Opposition 13 (Vartelas “could have\navoided the application of the statute . . . [by] refrain[ing]\nfrom departing from the United States (or from returning\nto the United States).”); post, at 3. Loss of the ability to\ntravel abroad is itself a harsh penalty,6 made all the more\ndevastating if it means enduring separation from close\nfamily members living abroad.

We have rejected arguments for\nretroactivity in similar cases, and in cases in which the\n——————\n  6 See Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.

HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nloss at stake was less momentous.\n   In Chew Heong v. United States, 112 U. S. 536 (1884), a\npathmarking decision, the Court confronted the “Chinese\nRestriction Act,” which barred Chinese laborers from\nreentering the United States without a certificate issued\non their departure. The Court held the reentry bar inap-\nplicable to aliens who had left the country prior to the\nAct’s passage and tried to return afterward without a\ncertificate. The Act’s text, the Court observed, was not “so\nclear and positive as to leave no room to doubt [retroactive\napplication] was the intention of the legislature.” Id., at\n559.\n   In Landgraf, the question was whether an amendment\nto Title VII’s ban on employment discrimination authoriz-\ning compensatory and punitive damages applied to pre-\nenactment conduct. The Court held it did not. No doubt\nthe complaint against the employer charged discrimina-\ntion that violated the Act at the time it occurred. But\ncompensatory and punitive damages were not then avail-\nable remedies. The later provision for such damages, the\nCourt determined, operated prospectively only, and did\nnot apply to employers whose discriminatory conduct oc-\ncurred prior to the amendment. See 511 U. S., at 280–\n286. And in Hughes Aircraft, the Court held that a provi-\nsion removing an affirmative defense to qui tam suits did\nnot apply to pre-enactment fraud. As in Landgraf, the\nprovision attached “a new disability” to past wrongful\nconduct and therefore could not apply retrospectively\nunless Congress clearly manifested such an intention.\nHughes Aircraft, 520 U. S., at 946–950.\n   Most recently, in St. Cyr, the Court took up the case of\nan alien who had entered a plea to a deportable offense.\nAt the time of the plea, the alien was eligible for discre-\ntionary relief from deportation. IIRIRA, enacted after\nentry of the plea, removed that eligibility. The Court held\nthat the IIRIRA provision in point could not be applied to\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe alien, for it attached a “new disability” to the guilty\nplea and Congress had not instructed such a result. 533\nU. S., at 321–323.\n                               III\n   The Government, echoed in part by the dissent, argues\nthat no retroactive effect is involved in this case, for the\nLegislature has not attached any disability to past con-\nduct. Rather, it has made the relevant event the alien’s\npost-IIRIRA act of returning to the United States. See\nBrief for Respondent 19–20; post, at 3. We find this argu-\nment disingenuous. Vartelas’ return to the United States\noccasioned his treatment as a new entrant, but the reason\nfor the “new disability” imposed on him was not his lawful\nforeign travel. It was, indeed, his conviction, pre-IIRIRA,\nof an offense qualifying as one of moral turpitude. That\npast misconduct, in other words, not present travel, is the\nwrongful activity Congress targeted in §1101(a)(13)(C)(v).\n   The Government observes that lower courts have up-\nheld Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act\nprosecutions that encompassed pre-enactment conduct.\nSee Brief for Respondent 18 (citing United States v.\nBrown, 555 F. 2d 407, 416–417 (CA5 1977), and United\nStates v. Campanale, 518 F. 2d 352, 364–365 (CA9 1975)\n(per curiam)). But those prosecutions depended on crimi-\nnal activity, i.e., an act of racketeering occuring after the\nprovision’s effective date. Section 1101(a)(13)(C)(v), in\ncontrast, does not require any showing of criminal conduct\npostdating IIRIRA’s enactment.\n   Fernandez-Vargas v. Gonzales, 548 U. S. 30 (2006),\nfeatured by the Government and the dissent, Brief for\nRespondent 17, 36–37; post, at 3, is similarly inapposite.\nThat case involved 8 U. S. C. §1231(a)(5), an IIRIRA addi-\ntion, which provides that an alien who reenters the United\nStates after having been removed can be removed again\nunder the same removal order. We held that the provision\n12                    VARTELAS v. HOLDER\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ncould be applied to an alien who reentered illegally before\nIIRIRA’s enactment. Explaining the Court’s decision, we\nsaid: “[T]he conduct of remaining in the country . . . is the\npredicate action; the statute applies to stop an indefinitely\ncontinuing violation . . . . It is therefore the alien’s choice\nto continue his illegal presence . . . after the effective date\nof the new la[w] that subjects him to the new . . . legal\nregime, not a past act that he is helpless to undo.” 548\nU. S., at 44 (emphasis added). Vartelas, we have several\ntimes stressed, engaged in no criminal activity after\nIIRIRA’s passage. He simply took a brief trip to Greece,\nanticipating a return without incident as in past visits to\nhis parents. No “indefinitely continuing” crime occurred;\ninstead, Vartelas was apprehended because of a pre-\nIIRIRA crime he was “helpless to undo.” Ibid.\n   The Government further refers to lower court decisions\nin cases involving 18 U. S. C. §922(g), which prohibits the\npossession of firearms by convicted felons. Brief for Re-\nspondent 18–19 (citing United States v. Pfeifer, 371 F. 3d\n430, 436 (CA8 2004), and United States v. Hemmings, 258\nF. 3d 587, 594 (CA7 2001)). “[L]ongstanding prohibitions\non the possession of firearms by felons,” District of Colum-\nbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 626 (2008), however, target a\npresent danger, i.e., the danger posed by felons who bear\narms. See, e.g., Pfeifer, 371 F. 3d, at 436 (hazardous con-\nduct that statute targets “occurred after enactment of the\nstatute”); Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of\n1968, §1201, 82 Stat. 236 (noting hazards involved when\nfelons possess firearms).7\n——————\n  7 The dissent, see post, at 6, notes two statutes of the same genre:\n\nlaws prohibiting persons convicted of a sex crime against a victim\nunder 16 years of age from working in jobs involving frequent contact\nwith minors, and laws prohibiting a person “who has been adjudicated\nas a mental defective or who has been committed to a mental insti-\ntution” from possessing guns, 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(4). The dissent is\ncorrect that these statutes do not operate retroactively. Rather, they\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Nor do recidivism sentencing enhancements support the\nGovernment’s position. Enhanced punishment imposed\nfor the later offense “ ‘is not to be viewed as . . . [an] addi-\ntional penalty for the earlier crimes,’ but instead, as a\n‘stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is considered\nto be an aggravated offense because [it is] a repetitive\none.’ ” Witte v. United States, 515 U. S. 389, 400 (1995)\n(quoting Gryger v. Burke, 334 U. S. 728, 732 (1948)). In\nVartelas’ case, however, there is no “aggravated . . . repeti-\ntive” offense. There is, in contrast, no post-IIRIRA crimi-\nnal offense at all. Vartelas’ travel abroad and return are\n“innocent” acts, see Fleuti, 374 U. S., at 462, burdened\nonly because of his pre-IIRIRA offense.\n   In sum, Vartelas’ brief trip abroad post-IIRIRA involved\nno criminal infraction. IIRIRA disabled him from leaving\nthe United States and returning as a lawful permanent\nresident. That new disability rested not on any continuing\ncriminal activity, but on a single crime committed years\nbefore IIRIRA’s enactment. The antiretroactivity principle\ninstructs against application of the new proscription\nto render Vartelas a first-time arrival at the country’s\ngateway.\n——————\naddress dangers that arise postenactment: sex offenders with a history\nof child molestation working in close proximity to children, and men-\ntally unstable persons purchasing guns. The act of flying to Greece, in\ncontrast, does not render a lawful permanent resident like Vartelas\nhazardous. Nor is it plausible that Congress’ solution to the problem of\ndangerous lawful permanent residents would be to pass a law that\nwould deter such persons from ever leaving the United States.\n   As for student loans, it is unlikely that the provision noted by the\ndissent, 20 U. S. C. §1091(r), would raise retroactivity questions in the\nfirst place. The statute has a prospective thrust. It concerns\n“[s]uspension of eligibility” when a student receiving a college loan\ncommits a drug crime. The suspension runs “from the date of th[e]\nconviction” for specified periods, e.g., two years for a second offense of\npossession. Moreover, eligibility may be restored before the period of\nineligibility ends if the student establishes, under prescribed criteria,\nhis rehabilitation.\n14                     VARTELAS v. HOLDER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                               IV\n   The Second Circuit homed in on the words “committed\nan offense” in §1101(a)(13)(C)(v) in determining that the\nchange IIRIRA wrought had no retroactive effect. 620\nF. 3d, at 119–121. It matters not that Vartelas may have\nrelied on the prospect of continuing visits to Greece in\ndeciding to plead guilty, the court reasoned. “[I]t would\nborder on the absurd,” the court observed, “to suggest that\nVartelas committed his counterfeiting crime in reliance on\nthe immigration laws.” Id., at 120. This reasoning is\ndoubly flawed.\n   As the Government acknowledges, “th[is] Court has not\nrequired a party challenging the application of a statute to\nshow [he relied on prior law] in structuring his conduct.”\nBrief for Respondent 25–26. In Landgraf, for example,\nthe issue was the retroactivity of compensatory and puni-\ntive damages as remedies for employment discrimination.\n“[C]oncerns of . . . upsetting expectations are attenuated in\nthe case of intentional employment discrimination,” the\nCourt noted, for such discrimination “has been unlawful\nfor more than a generation.” 511 U. S., at 282, n. 35. But\n“[e]ven when the conduct in question is morally reprehen-\nsible or illegal,” the Court added, “a degree of unfairness is\ninherent whenever the law imposes additional burdens\nbased on conduct that occurred in the past.” Id., at 283,\nn. 35. And in Hughes Aircraft, the Court found that Con-\ngress’ 1986 removal of a defense to a qui tam action did\nnot apply to pre-1986 conduct in light of the presumption\nagainst retroactivity. 520 U. S., at 941–942.8 As in Land-\n——————\n   8 The deleted defense permitted qui tam defendants to escape liability\n\nif the information on which a private plaintiff (relator) relied was\nalready in the Government’s possession. Detrimental reliance was\nhardly apparent, for the Government, both before and after the statu-\ntory change, could bring suit with that information, and “the monetary\nliability faced by [a False Claims Act] defendant is the same whether\nthe action is brought by the Government or by a qui tam relator.” 520\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngraf, the relevant conduct (submitting a false claim) had\nbeen unlawful for decades. See 520 U. S., at 947.\n   The operative presumption, after all, is that Congress\nintends its laws to govern prospectively only. See supra,\nat 7. “It is a strange ‘presumption,’ ” the Third Circuit\ncommented, “that arises only on . . . a showing [of] actual\nreliance.” Ponnapula v. Ashcroft, 373 F. 3d 480, 491\n(2004). The essential inquiry, as stated in Landgraf, 511\nU. S., at 269–270, is “whether the new provision attaches\nnew legal consequences to events completed before its\nenactment.” That is just what occurred here.\n   In any event, Vartelas likely relied on then-existing\nimmigration law. While the presumption against retroac-\ntive application of statutes does not require a showing of\ndetrimental reliance, see Olatunji, 387 F. 3d, at 389–395,\nreasonable reliance has been noted among the “familiar\nconsiderations” animating the presumption, see Landgraf,\n511 U. S., at 270 (presumption reflects “familiar consid-\nerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled\nexpectations”). Although not a necessary predicate for in-\nvoking the antiretroactivity principle, the likelihood of\nreliance on prior law strengthens the case for reading a\nnewly enacted law prospectively. See Olatunji, 387 F. 3d,\nat 393 (discussing St. Cyr).\n   St. Cyr is illustrative. That case involved a lawful per-\nmanent resident who pleaded guilty to a criminal charge\nthat made him deportable. Under the immigration law in\neffect when he was convicted, he would have been eligible\nto apply for a waiver of deportation. But his removal\nproceeding was commenced after Congress, in IIRIRA,\nwithdrew that dispensation. Disallowance of discretionary\nwaivers, the Court recognized, “attache[d] a new disabil-\nity, in respect to transactions or considerations already\npast.” 533 U. S., at 321 (internal quotation marks omit-\n——————\nU. S., at 948.\n16                      VARTELAS v. HOLDER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nted). Aliens like St. Cyr, the Court observed, “almost\ncertainly relied upon th[e] likelihood [of receiving discre-\ntionary relief] in deciding [to plead guilty, thereby] for-\ngo[ing] their right to a trial.” Id., at 325.9 Hence, applying\nthe IIRIRA withdrawal to St. Cyr would have an “obvious\nand severe retroactive effect.” Ibid. Because Congress\nmade no such intention plain, ibid., n. 55, we held that the\nprior law, permitting relief from deportation, governed St.\nCyr’s case.\n   As to retroactivity, one might think Vartelas’ case even\neasier than St. Cyr’s. St. Cyr could seek the Attorney\nGeneral’s discretionary dispensation. Vartelas, under\nFleuti, was free, without seeking an official’s permission,\nto make trips of short duration to see and assist his par-\nents in Greece.10 The Second Circuit thought otherwise,\ncompounding its initial misperception (treating reliance as\nessential to application of the antiretroactivity principle).\nThe deportation provision involved in St. Cyr, 8 U. S. C.\n§1229b(a)(3), referred to the alien’s “convict[ion]” of a\ncrime, while the statutory words sub judice in Vartelas’\ncase were “committed an offense.” §1101(a)(13)(C)(v); see\nsupra, at 12–13.11 The practical difference, so far as retro-\n——————\n  9 “There can be little doubt,” the Court noted in St. Cyr, “that, as\n\na general matter, alien defendants considering whether to enter into a\nplea agreement are acutely aware of the immigration consequences of\ntheir convictions.” 533 U. S., at 322. Indeed, “[p]reserving [their] right\nto remain in the United States may be more important to [them] than\nany potential jail sentence.” Ibid.

The operative\nprovision of this text—the provision that specifies the act\nthat it prohibits or prescribes—says that lawful perma-\n2                   VARTELAS v. HOLDER\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nnent residents convicted of offenses similar to Vartelas’s\nmust seek formal “admission” before they return to the\nUnited States from abroad. Since Vartelas returned to the\nUnited States after the statute’s effective date, the appli-\ncation of that text to his reentry does not give the statute a\nretroactive effect.\n   In determining whether a statute applies retroactively,\nwe should concern ourselves with the statute’s actual\noperation on regulated parties, not with retroactivity as an\nabstract concept or as a substitute for fairness concerns.\nIt is impossible to decide whether a statute’s application\nis retrospective or prospective without first identifying a\nreference point—a moment in time to which the statute’s\neffective date is either subsequent or antecedent. (Other-\nwise, the obvious question—retroactive in reference to\nwhat?—remains unanswered.) In my view, the identity of\nthat reference point turns on the activity a statute is\nintended to regulate. For any given regulated party, the\nreference point (or “retroactivity event”) is the moment at\nwhich the party does what the statute forbids or fails to do\nwhat it requires. See Martin v. Hadix, 527 U. S. 343, 362–\n363 (1999) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment); Landgraf, supra, at 291 (SCALIA, J., concur-\nring in judgments). With an identified reference point, the\nretroactivity analysis is simple. If a person has engaged in\nthe primary regulated activity before the statute’s effective\ndate, then the statute’s application would be retroactive.\nBut if a person engages in the primary regulated activity\nafter the statute’s effective date, then the statute’s appli-\ncation is prospective only. In the latter case, the interpre-\ntive presumption against retroactivity does not bar the\nstatute’s application.\n   Under that commonsense approach, this is a relatively\neasy case. Although the class of aliens affected by\n§1101(a)(13)(C)(v) is defined with respect to past crimes,\nthe regulated activity is reentry into the United States. By\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nits terms, the statute is all about controlling admission at\nthe border. It specifies six criteria to identify lawful per-\nmanent residents who are subject to formal “admission”\nprocedures, most of which relate to the circumstances of\ndeparture, the trip itself, or reentry. The titles of the\nstatutory sections containing §1101(a)(13)(C)(v) confirm\nits focus on admission, rather than crime: The provision is\nlocated within Title III of IIRIRA (“Inspection, Apprehen-\nsion, Detention, Adjudication, and Removal of Inadmissi-\nble and Deportable Aliens”), under Subtitle A (“Revision of\nProcedures for Removal of Aliens”), and §301 (“Treating\nPersons Present in the United States Without Authori-\nzation as Not Admitted”). 110 Stat. 3009–575. And the\nspecific subsection of IIRIRA at issue (§301(a), entitled\n“ ‘Admission’ Defined”) is an amendment to the definition\nof “entry” in the general “Definitions” section of the Immi-\ngration and Nationality Act (INA). See ante, at 2–3. The\noriginal provision told border officials how to regulate\nadmission—not how to punish crime—and the amendment\ndoes as well.\n    Section 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) thus has no retroactive effect\non Vartelas because the reference point here—Vartelas’s\nreadmission to the United States after a trip abroad—\noccurred years after the statute’s effective date. Although\nVartelas cannot change the fact of his prior conviction,\nhe could have avoided entirely the consequences of\n§1101(a)(13)(C)(v) by simply remaining in the United\nStates or, having left, remaining in Greece.            That\n§1101(a)(13)(C)(v) had no effect on Vartelas until he per-\nformed a post-enactment activity is a clear indication\nthat the statute’s application is purely prospective. See\nFernandez-Vargas v. Gonzales, 548 U. S. 30, 45, n. 11,\n46 (2006) (no retroactive effect where the statute in\nquestion did “not operate on a completed preenactment\nact” and instead turned on “a failure to take timely action\nthat would have avoided application of the new law\n4                      VARTELAS v. HOLDER\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\naltogether”).\n                               II\n   The Court avoids this conclusion by insisting that\n“[p]ast misconduct, . . . not present travel, is the wrongful\nactivity Congress targeted” in §1101(a)(13)(C)(v). Ante,\nat 11. That assertion does not, however, have any basis\nin the statute’s text or structure, and the Court does not\npretend otherwise. Instead, the Court simply asserts that\nVartelas’s “lawful foreign travel” surely could not be the\n“reason for the ‘new disability’ imposed on him.” Ibid.\n(emphasis added). But the reason for a prohibition has\nnothing to do with whether the prohibition is being ap-\nplied to a past rather than a future act. It may be relevant\nto other legal inquiries—for example, to whether a legisla-\ntive act violates one of the Ex Post Facto Clauses in Article\nI, see, e.g., Smith v. Doe, 538 U. S. 84, 92 (2003), or one of\nthe Due Process Clauses in the Fifth and Fourteenth\nAmendments, see, e.g., Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla.,\nInc., 348 U. S. 483, 487 (1955), or the Takings Clause in\nthe Fifth Amendment, see, e.g., Kelo v. New London, 545\nU. S. 469, 477–483 (2005), or the Obligation of Contracts\nClause in Article I, see, e.g., United States Trust Co. of\nN. Y. v. New Jersey, 431 U. S. 1, 29 (1977). But it has no\ndirect bearing upon whether the statute is retroactive.*\n   The Court’s failure to differentiate between the statutory-\ninterpretation question (whether giving certain effect to a\nprovision would make it retroactive and hence presump-\n——————\n  * I say no direct bearing because if the prospective application of a\nstatute would raise constitutional doubts because of its effect on pre-\nenactment conduct, that would be a reason to presume a legislative\nintent not to apply it unless the conduct in question is post-\nenactment—that is, to consider it retroactive when the conduct in\nquestion is pre-enactment. See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 380–\n381 (2005). That is not an issue here. If the statute had expressly\nmade the new “admission” rule applicable to those aliens with prior\nconvictions, its constitutionality would not be in doubt.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ntively unintended) and the validity question (whether\ngiving certain effect to a provision is unlawful) is on full\ndisplay in its attempts to distinguish §1101(a)(13)(C)(v)\nfrom similar statutes. Take, for example, the Court’s dis-\ncussion of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organ-\nizations Act (RICO). That Act, which targets “patterns\nof racketeering,” expressly defines those “patterns” to\ninclude some pre-enactment conduct. See 18 U. S. C.\n§1961(5). Courts interpreting RICO therefore need not\nconsider the presumption against retroactivity; instead,\nthe cases cited by the majority consider whether RICO\nviolates the Ex Post Facto Clause. See United States v.\nBrown, 555 F. 2d 407, 416–417 (CA5 1977); United States\nv. Campanale, 518 F. 2d 352, 364–365 (CA9 1975)\n(per curiam). The Government recognized this distinction\nand cited RICO to make a point about the Ex Post Facto\nClause rather than the presumption against retroactivity,\nBrief for Respondent 17–18; the Court evidently does not.\n   The Court’s confident assertion that Congress surely\nwould not have meant this statute to apply to Vartelas,\nwhose foreign travel and subsequent return to the United\nStates were innocent events, ante, at 11, 14, simply begs\nthe question presented in this case. Ignorance, of course,\nis no excuse (ignorantia legis neminem excusat); and his\nreturn was entirely lawful only if the statute before us did\nnot render it unlawful. Since IIRIRA’s effective date in\n1996, lawful permanent residents who have committed\ncrimes of moral turpitude are forbidden to leave the\nUnited States and return without formally seeking “ad-\nmission.” See §1101(a)(13)(C)(v). As a result, Vartelas’s\nnumerous trips abroad and “uneventful” reentries into the\nUnited States after the passage of IIRIRA, see ante, at 5,\nwere lawful only if §1101(a)(13)(C)(v) does not apply to\nhim—which is, of course, precisely the matter in dispute\nhere.\n   The Court’s circular reasoning betrays its underlying\n6                   VARTELAS v. HOLDER\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nconcern: Because the Court believes that reentry after a\nbrief trip abroad should be lawful, it will decline to apply a\nstatute that clearly provides otherwise for certain criminal\naliens. (The same instinct likely produced the Court’s\nquestionable statutory interpretation in Rosenberg v.\nFleuti, 374 U. S. 449 (1963).) The Court’s test for retroac-\ntivity—asking whether the statute creates a “new disabil-\nity” in “respect to past events”—invites this focus on fair-\nness. Understandably so, since it is derived from a Justice\nStory opinion interpreting a provision of the New Hamp-\nshire Constitution that forbade retroactive laws—a provi-\nsion comparable to the Federal Constitution’s ex post facto\nprohibition and bearing no relation to the presumption\nagainst retroactivity. What is unfair or irrational (and\nhence should be forbidden) has nothing to do with whether\napplying a statute to a particular act is prospective (and\nthus presumptively intended) or retroactive (and thus\npresumptively unintended). On the latter question, the\n“new disability in respect to past events” test provides no\nmeaningful guidance.\n   I can imagine countless laws that, like §1101(a)(13)\n(C)(v), impose “new disabilities” related to “past events”\nand yet do not operate retroactively. For example, a stat-\nute making persons convicted of drug crimes ineligible for\nstudent loans. See, e.g., 20 U. S. C. §1091(r)(1). Or laws\nprohibiting those convicted of sex crimes from working in\ncertain jobs that involve repeated contact with minors.\nSee, e.g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. §290.95(c) (West Supp.\n2012). Or laws prohibiting those previously committed\nfor mental instability from purchasing guns. See, e.g., 18\nU. S. C. §922(g)(4). The Court concedes that it would not\nconsider the last two laws inapplicable to pre-enactment\nconvictions or commitments. Ante, at 12, n. 7. The Court\ndoes not deny that these statutes impose a “new disability\nin respect to past events,” but it distinguishes them based\non the reason for their enactment: These statutes “address\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ndangers that arise postenactment.” Ante, at 13, n. 7. So\nmuch for the new-disability-in-respect-to-past-events test;\nit has now become a new-disability-not-designed-to-guard-\nagainst-future-danger test. But why is guarding against\nfuture danger the only reason Congress may wish to regu-\nlate future action in light of past events? It obviously is\nnot. So the Court must invent yet another doctrine to\naddress my first example, the law making persons\nconvicted of drug crimes ineligible for student loans.\nAccording to the Court, that statute differs from\n§1101(a)(13)(C)(v) because it “has a prospective thrust.”\nAnte, at 13, n. 7. I cannot imagine what that means, other\nthan that the statute regulates post-enactment con-\nduct. But, of course, so does §1101(a)(13)(C)(v). Rather\nthan reconciling any of these distinctions with Justice\nStory’s formulation of retroactivity, the Court leaves to\nlower courts the unenviable task of identifying new-\ndisabilities-not-designed-to-guard-against-future-danger-\nand-also-lacking-a-prospective-thrust.\n   And anyway, is there any doubt that §1101(a)(13)(C)(v)\nis intended to guard against the “dangers that arise\npostenactment” from having aliens in our midst who have\nshown themselves to have proclivity for crime? Must that\nbe rejected as its purpose simply because Congress has not\nsought to achieve it by all possible means—by ferreting\nout such dangerous aliens and going through the expen-\nsive and lengthy process of deporting them? At least some\nof the post-enactment danger can readily be eliminated by\nforcing lawful permanent residents who have committed\ncertain crimes to undergo formal “admission” procedures\nat our borders. Indeed, by limiting criminal aliens’ oppor-\ntunities to travel and then return to the United States,\n§1101(a)(13)(C)(v) may encourage self-deportation. But all\nthis is irrelevant. The positing of legislative “purpose” is\nalways a slippery enterprise compared to the simple\ndetermination of whether a statute regulates a future\n8                   VARTELAS v. HOLDER\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nevent—and it is that, rather than the Court’s pronounce-\nment of some forward-looking reason, which governs\nwhether a statute has retroactive effect.\n   Finally, I cannot avoid observing that even if the Court’s\nconcern about the fairness or rationality of applying\n§1101(a)(13)(C)(v) to Vartelas were relevant to the statu-\ntory interpretation question, that concern is greatly exag-\ngerated. In disregard of a federal statute, convicted crimi-\nnal Vartelas repeatedly traveled to and from Greece\nwithout ever seeking formal admission at this country’s\nborders. When he was finally unlucky enough to be ap-\nprehended, and sought discretionary relief from removal\nunder former §212(c) of the INA, 8 U. S. C. §1182(c) (1994\ned.), the Immigration Judge denying his application found\nthat Vartelas had made frequent trips to Greece and had\nremained there for long periods of time, that he was “a\nserious tax evader,” that he had offered testimony that\nwas “close to incredible,” and that he had not shown hard-\nship to himself or his estranged wife and children should\nhe be removed. See 620 F. 3d 108, 111 (CA2 2010); Brief\nfor Respondent 5 (internal quotation marks omitted). In\ndecrying the “harsh penalty” imposed by this statute on\nVartelas, the Court ignores those inconvenient facts.\nAnte, at 9. But never mind. Under any sensible approach\nto the presumption against retroactivity, these factual\nsubtleties should be irrelevant to the temporal application\nof §1101(a)(13)(C)(v).\n                       *     *    *\n  This case raises a plain-vanilla question of statutory\ninterpretation, not broader questions about frustrated\nexpectations or fairness. Our approach to answering that\nquestion should be similarly straightforward: We should\ndetermine what relevant activity the statute regulates\n(here, reentry); absent a clear statement otherwise, only\nsuch relevant activity which occurs after the statute’s\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

If, as so construed, the statute is unfair or irra-\ntional enough to violate the Constitution, that is another\nmatter entirely, and one not presented here. Our inter-\npretive presumption against retroactivity, however, is just\nthat—a tool to ascertain what the statute means, not a\nlicense to rewrite the statute in a way the Court considers\nmore desirable.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 626207, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2012/03/28/Vartelas_v._Holder.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2011                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 10–1211. Argued January 18, 2012—Decided March 28, 2012\nBefore passage of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Re-\n  sponsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), United States immigration law\n  provided deportation hearings for excludable aliens who had already\n  entered the United States and exclusion hearings for excludable al-\n  iens seeking entry into the United States. Lawful permanent resi-\n  dents were not regarded as making an “entry,” upon their return\n  from “innocent, casual, and brief excursion[s] . . . outside this coun-\n  try’s borders.” Rosenberg v. Fleuti, 374 U. S. 449, 462. In IIRIRA,\n  Congress abolished the distinction between exclusion and deportation\n  procedures, creating a uniform “removal” proceeding. See 8 U. S. C.\n  §§1229, 1229a. Congress made “admission” the key word, and de-\n  fined “admission” to mean “the lawful entry of the alien into the\n  United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration\n  officer.” §1101(a)(13)(A). This alteration, the Board of Immigration\n  Appeals (BIA) determined, superseded Fleuti. Thus, lawful perma-\n  nent residents returning from a trip abroad are now regarded as\n  seeking admission if they have “committed an offense identified in\n  section 1182(a)(2),” §1101(a)(13)(C)(v), including, as relevant here, “a\n  crime involving moral turpitude . . . or conspiracy to commit such a\n  crime,” §1182(a)(2)(A)(i).\n     Petitioner Vartelas, a lawful permanent resident of the United\n  States since 1989, pleaded guilty to a felony (conspiring to make a\n  counterfeit security) in 1994, and served a 4-month prison sentence.\n  In the years after his conviction, and even after IIRIRA’s passage,\n  Vartelas regularly traveled to Greece to visit his aging parents. In\n  2003, when Vartelas returned from a week-long trip to Greece, an\n  immigration officer classified him as an alien seeking “admission”\n  based on his 1994 conviction. At Vartelas’ removal proceedings, his\n2                        VARTELAS v. HOLDER\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    attorneys conceded removability and requested discretionary relief\n    under former §212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The\n    Immigration Judge denied the request for relief, and ordered Var-\n    telas removed to Greece. The BIA affirmed. In 2008, Vartelas filed\n    with the BIA a timely motion to reopen the removal proceedings, al-\n    leging that his previous attorneys were ineffective for, among other\n    lapses, conceding his removability. He sought to withdraw the con-\n    cession of removability on the ground that IIRIRA’s new “admission”\n    provision did not reach back to deprive him of lawful resident status\n    based on his pre-IIRIRA conviction. The BIA denied the motion. The\n    Second Circuit affirmed. Rejecting Vartelas’ argument that IIRIRA\n    operated prospectively and therefore did not govern his case, the Se-\n    cond Circuit reasoned that he had not relied on the prior legal regime\n    at the time he committed the disqualifying crime.\nHeld: The impact of Vartelas’ brief travel abroad on his permanent res-\n ident status is determined not by IIRIRA, but by the legal regime in\n force at the time of his conviction. Pp. 7–17.\n    (a) Under the principle against retroactive legislation invoked by\n Vartelas, courts read laws as prospective in application unless Con-\n gress has unambiguously instructed retroactivity. See Landgraf v.\n USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 263. The presumption against ret-\n roactive legislation “embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than\n our Republic.” Id., at 265. Numerous decisions of this Court have\n invoked Justice Story’s formulation for determining when a law’s ret-\n rospective application would collide with the doctrine, namely, as rel-\n evant here, when such application would “attac[h] a new disability, in\n respect to transactions or considerations already past,” Society for\n Propagation of Gospel v. Wheeler, 22 F. Cas. 756, 767. See, e.g., INS\n v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 321; Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex\n rel. Schumer, 520 U. S. 939, 947; Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 283. Var-\n telas urges that applying IIRIRA to him would attach a “new disabil-\n ity,” effectively a ban on travel outside the United States, “in respect\n to” past events, specifically, his offense, guilty plea, conviction, and\n punishment, all occurring prior to IIRIRA’s passage.\n    Congress did not expressly prescribe §1101(a)(13)’s temporal reach.\n The Court, therefore, proceeds to the dispositive question whether\n application of IIRIRA’s travel restraint to Vartelas “would have ret-\n roactive effect” Congress did not authorize. See id., at 280. Vartelas\n presents a firm case for application of the antiretroactivity principle.\n Beyond genuine doubt §1101(a)(13)(C)(v)’s restraint on lawful per-\n manent residents like Vartelas ranks as a “new disability.” Once\n able to journey abroad to, e.g., fulfill religious obligations or respond\n to family emergencies, they now face potential banishment, a severe\n sanction. See, e.g., Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___. The Gov-\n                    Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nernment suggests that Vartelas could have avoided any adverse con-\nsequences if he simply stayed at home in the United States. But los-\ning the ability to travel abroad is itself a harsh penalty, made all the\nmore devastating if it means enduring separation from close family\nmembers.\n   This Court has rejected arguments for retroactivity in similar\ncases, see Chew Heong v. United States, 112 U. S. 536, 559; St. Cyr,\n533 U. S., at 321–323, and in cases in which the loss at stake was less\nmomentous, see Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 280–286; Hughes Aircraft,\n520 U. S., at 946–950. Pp. 7–11.\n   (b) The Court finds disingenuous the Government’s argument that\nno retroactive effect is involved in this case because the relevant\nevent is the alien’s post-IIRIRA return to the United States. Var-\ntelas’ return occasioned his treatment as a new entrant, but the rea-\nson for his “new disability” was his pre-IIRIRA conviction. That past\nmisconduct is the wrongful activity targeted by §1101(a)(13)(C)(v).\nPp. 11–13.\n   (c) In determining that the change IIRIRA wrought had no retroac-\ntive effect, the Second Circuit homed in on the words “committed an\noffense” in §1101(a)(13)(C)(v). It reasoned that reliance on the prior\nlaw is essential to application of the antiretroactivity principle, and\nthat Vartelas did not commit his crime in reliance on immigration\nlaws. This reasoning is doubly flawed. A party is not required to\nshow reliance on the prior law in structuring his conduct. See, e.g.,\nLandgraf, 511 U. S., at 282, n. 35. In any event, Vartelas likely re-\nlied on then-existing immigration law, and this likelihood strength-\nens the case for reading a newly enacted law prospectively. St. Cyr is\nillustrative. There, a lawful permanent resident pleaded guilty to a\ncriminal charge that made him deportable. Under the immigration\nlaw in effect when he was convicted, he would have been eligible to\napply for a waiver of deportation. But his removal proceeding was\ncommenced after IIRIRA withdrew that dispensation. Disallowance\nof discretionary waivers attached a new disability to past conduct,\n533 U. S., at 321. Aliens like St. Cyr “almost certainly relied upon\nth[e] likelihood [of receiving discretionary relief] in deciding [to plead\nguilty, thereby] forgo[ing] their right to a trial,” id., at 325. Because\napplying the IIRIRA withdrawal to St. Cyr would have an “obvious\nand severe retroactive effect,” ibid., and Congress made no such in-\ntention plain, ibid., n. 55, the prior law governed St. Cyr’s case. Var-\ntelas’ case is at least as clear as St. Cyr’s for declining to apply a new\nlaw retroactively. St. Cyr could seek only the Attorney General’s dis-\ncretionary dispensation, while Vartelas, under Fleuti, was free, with-\nout seeking an official’s permission, to make short trips to see and as-\nsist his parents in Greece.

ERIC H. \n\n       HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 28, 2012]\n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Panagis Vartelas, a native of Greece, became a lawful\npermanent resident of the United States in 1989. He\npleaded guilty to a felony (conspiring to make a counterfeit\nsecurity) in 1994, and served a prison sentence of four\nmonths for that offense. Vartelas traveled to Greece in\n2003 to visit his parents. On his return to the United\nStates a week later, he was treated as an inadmissible\nalien and placed in removal proceedings. Under the law\ngoverning at the time of Vartelas’ plea, an alien in his\nsituation could travel abroad for brief periods without\njeopardizing his resident alien status. See 8 U. S. C.\n§1101(a)(13) (1988 ed.), as construed in Rosenberg v.\nFleuti, 374 U. S. 449 (1963).\n   In 1996, Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration\nReform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), 110\nStat. 3009–546. That Act effectively precluded foreign\ntravel by lawful permanent residents who had a conviction\nlike Vartelas’. Under IIRIRA, such aliens, on return from\na sojourn abroad, however brief, may be permanently\nremoved from the United States.            See 8 U. S. C.\n2                   VARTELAS v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n§1101(a)(13)(C)(v); §1182(a)(2).\n   This case presents a question of retroactivity not ad-\ndressed by Congress: As to a lawful permanent resident\nconvicted of a crime before the effective date of IIRIRA,\nwhich regime governs, the one in force at the time of\nthe conviction, or IIRIRA? If the former, Vartelas’ brief\ntrip abroad would not disturb his lawful permanent resi-\ndent status. If the latter, he may be denied reentry. We\nconclude that the relevant provision of IIRIRA,\n§1101(a)(13)(C)(v), attached a new disability (denial of\nreentry) in respect to past events (Vartelas’ pre-IIRIRA\noffense, plea, and conviction). Guided by the deeply rooted\npresumption against retroactive legislation, we hold that\n§1101(a)(13)(C)(v) does not apply to Vartelas’ conviction.\nThe impact of Vartelas’ brief travel abroad on his per-\nmanent resident status is therefore determined not by\nIIRIRA, but by the legal regime in force at the time of his\nconviction.\n                              I\n                                A\n  Before IIRIRA’s passage, United States immigration law\nestablished “two types of proceedings in which aliens can\nbe denied the hospitality of the United States: deportation\nhearings and exclusion hearings.” Landon v. Plasencia,\n459 U. S. 21, 25 (1982). Exclusion hearings were held for\ncertain aliens seeking entry to the United States, and\ndeportation hearings were held for certain aliens who had\nalready entered this country. See ibid.\n  Under this regime, “entry” into the United States was\ndefined as “any coming of an alien into the United States,\nfrom a foreign port or place.” 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(13) (1988\ned.). The statute, however, provided an exception for\nlawful permanent residents; aliens lawfully residing here\nwere not regarded as making an “entry” if their “departure\nto a foreign port or place . . . was not intended or reasona-\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbly to be expected by [them] or [their] presence in a foreign\nport or place . . . was not voluntary.” Ibid. Interpreting\nthis cryptic provision, we held in Fleuti, 374 U. S., at 461–\n462, that Congress did not intend to exclude aliens long\nresident in the United States upon their return from\n“innocent, casual, and brief excursion[s] . . . outside this\ncountry’s borders.” Instead, the Court determined, Con-\ngress meant to rank a once-permanent resident as a new\nentrant only when the foreign excursion “meaningfully\ninterrupt[ed] . . . the alien’s [U. S.] residence.” Id., at 462.\nAbsent such “disrupti[on]” of the alien’s residency, the\nalien would not be “subject . . . to the consequences of an\n‘entry’ into the country on his return.” Ibid.1\n   In IIRIRA, Congress abolished the distinction between\nexclusion and deportation procedures and created a uni-\nform proceeding known as “removal.” See 8 U. S. C.\n§§1229, 1229a; Judulang v. Holder, 565 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 1–2). Congress made “admission” the\nkey word, and defined admission to mean “the lawful\nentry of the alien into the United States after inspec-\ntion and authorization by an immigration officer.”\n§1101(a)(13)(A). This alteration, the Board of Immigration\nAppeals (BIA) determined, superseded Fleuti. See In re\nCollado-Munoz, 21 I. & N. Dec. 1061, 1065–1066 (1998)\n(en banc).2 Thus, lawful permanent residents returning\n——————\n  1 The dissent appears driven, in no small measure, by its dim view of\n\nthe Court’s opinion in Fleuti. See post, at 6 (“same instinct” operative\nin Fleuti and this case).\n  2 The BIA determined that the Fleuti doctrine no longer held sway\n\nbecause it was rooted in the “no longer existent definition of ‘entry’ in\n[the INA].” 21 I. & N. Dec., at 1065. The Board also noted that “Con-\ngress . . . amended the law to expressly preserve some, but not all, of\nthe Fleuti doctrine” when it provided that a lawful permanent resident\nabsent from the United States for less than 180 days would not be\nregarded as seeking an admission except in certain enumerated cir-\ncumstances, among them, prior commission of a crime of moral turpi-\ntude. See ibid. (citing 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(13)(C)(ii)).\n4                       VARTELAS v. HOLDER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npost-IIRIRA, like Vartelas, may be required to “ ‘see[k] an\nadmission’ into the United States, without regard to\nwhether the alien’s departure from the United States\nmight previously have been ranked as ‘brief, casual, and\ninnocent’ under the Fleuti doctrine.” Id., at 1066.\n   An alien seeking “admission” to the United States is\nsubject to various requirements, see, e.g., §1181(a), and\ncannot gain entry if she is deemed “inadmissible” on any of\nthe numerous grounds set out in the immigration stat-\nutes, see §1182. Under IIRIRA, lawful permanent residents\nare regarded as seeking admission into the United States\nif they fall into any of six enumerated categories.\n§1101(a)(13)(C). Relevant here, the fifth of these catego-\nries covers aliens who “ha[ve] committed an offense identi-\nfied in section 1182(a)(2) of this title.” §1101(a)(13)(C)(v).\nOffenses in this category include “a crime involving moral\nturpitude (other than a purely political offense) or an\nattempt or conspiracy to commit such a crime.”\n§1182(a)(2)(A)(i).\n   In sum, before IIRIRA, lawful permanent residents who\nhad committed a crime of moral turpitude could, under\nthe Fleuti doctrine, return from brief trips abroad with-\nout applying for admission to the United States. Under\nIIRIRA, such residents are subject to admission proce-\ndures, and, potentially, to removal from the United States\non grounds of inadmissibility.3\n——————\n  Vartelas does not challenge the ruling in Collado-Munoz. We there-\nfore assume, but do not decide, that IIRIRA’s amendments to\n§1101(a)(13)(A) abrogated Fleuti.\n  3 Although IIRIRA created a uniform removal procedure for both\n\nexcludable and deportable aliens, the list of criminal offenses that\nsubject aliens to exclusion remains separate from the list of offenses\nthat render an alien deportable. These lists are “sometimes overlap-\nping and sometimes divergent.” Judulang v. Holder, 565 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 2). Pertinent here, although a single crime involving\nmoral turpitude may render an alien inadmissible, it would not render\nher deportable. See 8 U. S. C. §1182(a)(2) (listing excludable crimes);\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)       5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                             B\n   Panagis Vartelas, born and raised in Greece, has resided\nin the United States for over 30 years. Originally admit-\nted on a student visa issued in 1979, Vartelas became a\nlawful permanent resident in 1989. He currently lives in\nthe New York area and works as a sales manager for a\nroofing company.\n   In 1992, Vartelas opened an auto body shop in Queens,\nNew York. One of his business partners used the shop’s\nphotocopier to make counterfeit travelers’ checks. Var-\ntelas helped his partner perforate the sheets into individ-\nual checks, but Vartelas did not sell the checks or receive\nany money from the venture. In 1994, he pleaded guilty to\nconspiracy to make or possess counterfeit securities, in\nviolation of 18 U. S. C. §371. He was sentenced to four\nmonths’ incarceration, followed by two years’ supervised\nrelease.\n   Vartelas regularly traveled to Greece to visit his aging\nparents in the years after his 1994 conviction; even after\nthe passage of IIRIRA in 1996, his return to the United\nStates from these visits remained uneventful. In January\n2003, however, when Vartelas returned from a week-long\ntrip to Greece, an immigration officer classified him as an\nalien seeking “admission.” The officer based this classi-\nfication on Vartelas’ 1994 conviction. See United States\nex rel. Volpe v. Smith, 289 U. S. 422, 423 (1933) (counter-\nfeiting ranks as a crime of moral turpitude).\n   At Vartelas’ removal proceedings, his initial attorney\nconceded removability, and requested discretionary relief\nfrom removal under the former §212(c) of the Immigration\nand Nationality Act (INA). See 8 U. S. C. §1182(c) (1994\ned.) (repealed 1996). This attorney twice failed to appear\nfor hearings and once failed to submit a requested brief.\nVartelas engaged a new attorney, who continued to con-\n——————\n§1227(a)(2) (listing deportable crimes).\n6                   VARTELAS v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncede removability and to request discretionary relief. The\nImmigration Judge denied the request for relief, and\nordered Vartelas removed to Greece. The BIA affirmed\nthe Immigration Judge’s decision.\n   In July 2008, Vartelas filed with the BIA a timely mo-\ntion to reopen the removal proceedings, alleging that his\nprevious attorneys were ineffective for, among other\nlapses, conceding his removability. He sought to withdraw\nthe concession of removability on the ground that IIRIRA’s\nnew “admission” provision, codified at §1101(a)(13), did\nnot reach back to deprive him of lawful resident status\nbased on his pre-IIRIRA conviction. The BIA denied the\nmotion, declaring that Vartelas had not been prejudiced by\nhis lawyers’ performance, for no legal authority prevented\nthe application of IIRIRA to Vartelas’ pre-IIRIRA conduct.\n   The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit af-\nfirmed the BIA’s decision, agreeing that Vartelas had\nfailed to show he was prejudiced by his attorneys’ alleged-\nly ineffective performance. Rejecting Vartelas’ argument\nthat IIRIRA operated prospectively and therefore did not\ngovern his case, the Second Circuit reasoned that he had\nnot relied on the prior legal regime at the time he commit-\nted the disqualifying crime. See 620 F. 3d 108, 118–120\n(2010).\n   In so ruling, the Second Circuit created a split with two\nother Circuits. The Fourth and Ninth Circuits have held\nthat the new §1101(a)(13) may not be applied to lawful\npermanent residents who committed crimes listed in\n§1182 (among them, crimes of moral turpitude) prior to\nIIRIRA’s enactment. See Olatunji v. Ashcroft, 387 F. 3d\n383 (CA4 2004); Camins v. Gonzales, 500 F. 3d 872 (CA9\n2007). We granted certiorari, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), to\nresolve the conflict among the Circuits.\n                              II\n    As earlier explained, see supra, at 2–4, pre-IIRIRA, a\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

Under\nIIRIRA, on return from foreign travel, such an alien is\ntreated as a new arrival to our shores, and may be re-\nmoved from the United States. Vartelas does not question\nCongress’ authority to restrict reentry in this manner.\nNor does he contend that Congress could not do so retroac-\ntively. Instead, he invokes the principle against retro-\nactive legislation, under which courts read laws as pro-\nspective in application unless Congress has unambiguously\ninstructed retroactivity. See Landgraf v. USI Film Prod-\nucts, 511 U. S. 244, 263 (1994).\n   The presumption against retroactive legislation, the\nCourt recalled in Landgraf, “embodies a legal doctrine\ncenturies older than our Republic.” Id., at 265. Several\nprovisions of the Constitution, the Court noted, embrace\nthe doctrine, among them, the Ex Post Facto Clause, the\nContract Clause, and the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process\nClause. Id., at 266. Numerous decisions of this Court\nrepeat the classic formulation Justice Story penned for\ndetermining when retrospective application of a law would\ncollide with the doctrine. It would do so, Story stated,\nwhen such application would “tak[e] away or impai[r]\nvested rights acquired under existing laws, or creat[e] a\nnew obligation, impos[e] a new duty, or attac[h] a new\ndisability, in respect to transactions or considerations\nalready past.”      Society for Propagation of Gospel v.\nWheeler, 22 F. Cas. 756, 767 (No. 13,156) (CC NH 1814).\nSee, e.g., INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 321 (2001) (invok-\ning Story’s formulation); Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United\nStates ex rel. Schumer, 520 U. S. 939, 947 (1997); Land-\ngraf, 511 U. S., at 283.4\n——————\n  4 The dissent asserts that Justice Story’s opinion “bear[s] no relation\n\nto the presumption against retroactivity.” Post, at 6. That is a bold\n8                      VARTELAS v. HOLDER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Vartelas urges that applying IIRIRA to him, rather than\nthe law that existed at the time of his conviction, would\nattach a “new disability,” effectively a ban on travel out-\nside the United States, “in respect to [events] . . . already\npast,” i.e., his offense, guilty plea, conviction, and punish-\nment, all occurring prior to the passage of IIRIRA. In\nevaluating Vartelas’ argument, we note first a matter not\ndisputed by the Government: Congress did not expressly\nprescribe the temporal reach of the IIRIRA provision in\nquestion, 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(13). See Landgraf, 511 U. S.,\nat 280 (Court asks first “whether Congress has expressly\nprescribed [new §1101(a)(13)’s] proper reach”); Brief for\nRespondent 11 (Court’s holding in INS v. St. Cyr, 533\nU. S., at 317–320, “compels the conclusion that Congress\nhas not ‘expressly prescribed the statute’s proper reach’ ”\n(quoting Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 280)).5 Several other\nprovisions of IIRIRA, in contrast to §1101(a)(13), expressly\ndirect retroactive application, e.g., 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)\n(IIRIRA’s amendment of the “aggravated felony” definition\napplies expressly to “conviction[s] . . . entered before, on,\nor after” the statute’s enactment date (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). See St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 319–320, and\nn. 43 (setting out further examples). Accordingly, we\nproceed to the dispositive question whether, as Vartelas\nmaintains, application of IIRIRA’s travel restraint to him\n“would have retroactive effect” Congress did not authorize.\nSee Landgraf, 511 U. S., at 280.\n   Vartelas presents a firm case for application of the\nantiretroactivity principle. Neither his sentence, nor the\n——————\nstatement in view of this Court’s many references to Justice Story’s\nformulation in cases involving the presumption that statutes operate\nonly prospectively in the absence of a clear congressional statement to\nthe contrary.\n   5 In St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 317–320, we rejected the Government’s\n\ncontention that Congress directed retroactive application of IIRIRA in\nits entirety.\n                      Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      9\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nimmigration law in effect when he was convicted and\nsentenced, blocked him from occasional visits to his par-\nents in Greece. Current §1101(a)(13)(C)(v), if applied to\nhim, would thus attach “a new disability” to conduct over\nand done well before the provision’s enactment.\n   Beyond genuine doubt, we note, the restraint\n§1101(a)(13)(C)(v) places on lawful permanent residents\nlike Vartelas ranks as a “new disability.” Once able to\njourney abroad to fulfill religious obligations, attend fu-\nnerals and weddings of family members, tend to vital\nfinancial interests, or respond to family emergencies,\npermanent residents situated as Vartelas is now face\npotential banishment. We have several times recognized\nthe severity of that sanction. See, e.g., Padilla v. Ken-\ntucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 8–9, 16).\n   It is no answer to say, as the Government suggests, that\nVartelas could have avoided any adverse consequences if\nhe simply stayed at home in the United States, his resi-\ndence for 24 years prior to his 2003 visit to his parents in\nGreece. See Brief in Opposition 13 (Vartelas “could have\navoided the application of the statute . . . [by] refrain[ing]\nfrom departing from the United States (or from returning\nto the United States).”); post, at 3. Loss of the ability to\ntravel abroad is itself a harsh penalty,6 made all the more\ndevastating if it means enduring separation from close\nfamily members living abroad. See Brief for Asian Ameri-\ncan Justice Center et al. as Amici Curiae 16–23 (describ-\ning illustrative cases). We have rejected arguments for\nretroactivity in similar cases, and in cases in which the\n——————\n  6 See Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.

Secretary of\nState, 378 U. S. 500, 519–520 (1964) (Douglas, J., concurring) (right to\ntravel, “at home and abroad, is important for . . . business[,] . . . cul-\ntural, political, and social activities—for all the commingling which gre-\ngarious man enjoys”).\n10                 VARTELAS v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nloss at stake was less momentous.\n   In Chew Heong v. United States, 112 U. S. 536 (1884), a\npathmarking decision, the Court confronted the “Chinese\nRestriction Act,” which barred Chinese laborers from\nreentering the United States without a certificate issued\non their departure. The Court held the reentry bar inap-\nplicable to aliens who had left the country prior to the\nAct’s passage and tried to return afterward without a\ncertificate. The Act’s text, the Court observed, was not “so\nclear and positive as to leave no room to doubt [retroactive\napplication] was the intention of the legislature.” Id., at\n559.\n   In Landgraf, the question was whether an amendment\nto Title VII’s ban on employment discrimination authoriz-\ning compensatory and punitive damages applied to pre-\nenactment conduct. The Court held it did not. No doubt\nthe complaint against the employer charged discrimina-\ntion that violated the Act at the time it occurred. But\ncompensatory and punitive damages were not then avail-\nable remedies. The later provision for such damages, the\nCourt determined, operated prospectively only, and did\nnot apply to employers whose discriminatory conduct oc-\ncurred prior to the amendment. See 511 U. S., at 280–\n286. And in Hughes Aircraft, the Court held that a provi-\nsion removing an affirmative defense to qui tam suits did\nnot apply to pre-enactment fraud. As in Landgraf, the\nprovision attached “a new disability” to past wrongful\nconduct and therefore could not apply retrospectively\nunless Congress clearly manifested such an intention.\nHughes Aircraft, 520 U. S., at 946–950.\n   Most recently, in St. Cyr, the Court took up the case of\nan alien who had entered a plea to a deportable offense.\nAt the time of the plea, the alien was eligible for discre-\ntionary relief from deportation. IIRIRA, enacted after\nentry of the plea, removed that eligibility. The Court held\nthat the IIRIRA provision in point could not be applied to\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe alien, for it attached a “new disability” to the guilty\nplea and Congress had not instructed such a result. 533\nU. S., at 321–323.\n                               III\n   The Government, echoed in part by the dissent, argues\nthat no retroactive effect is involved in this case, for the\nLegislature has not attached any disability to past con-\nduct. Rather, it has made the relevant event the alien’s\npost-IIRIRA act of returning to the United States. See\nBrief for Respondent 19–20; post, at 3. We find this argu-\nment disingenuous. Vartelas’ return to the United States\noccasioned his treatment as a new entrant, but the reason\nfor the “new disability” imposed on him was not his lawful\nforeign travel. It was, indeed, his conviction, pre-IIRIRA,\nof an offense qualifying as one of moral turpitude. That\npast misconduct, in other words, not present travel, is the\nwrongful activity Congress targeted in §1101(a)(13)(C)(v).\n   The Government observes that lower courts have up-\nheld Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act\nprosecutions that encompassed pre-enactment conduct.\nSee Brief for Respondent 18 (citing United States v.\nBrown, 555 F. 2d 407, 416–417 (CA5 1977), and United\nStates v. Campanale, 518 F. 2d 352, 364–365 (CA9 1975)\n(per curiam)). But those prosecutions depended on crimi-\nnal activity, i.e., an act of racketeering occuring after the\nprovision’s effective date. Section 1101(a)(13)(C)(v), in\ncontrast, does not require any showing of criminal conduct\npostdating IIRIRA’s enactment.\n   Fernandez-Vargas v. Gonzales, 548 U. S. 30 (2006),\nfeatured by the Government and the dissent, Brief for\nRespondent 17, 36–37; post, at 3, is similarly inapposite.\nThat case involved 8 U. S. C. §1231(a)(5), an IIRIRA addi-\ntion, which provides that an alien who reenters the United\nStates after having been removed can be removed again\nunder the same removal order. We held that the provision\n12                    VARTELAS v. HOLDER\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ncould be applied to an alien who reentered illegally before\nIIRIRA’s enactment. Explaining the Court’s decision, we\nsaid: “[T]he conduct of remaining in the country . . . is the\npredicate action; the statute applies to stop an indefinitely\ncontinuing violation . . . . It is therefore the alien’s choice\nto continue his illegal presence . . . after the effective date\nof the new la[w] that subjects him to the new . . . legal\nregime, not a past act that he is helpless to undo.” 548\nU. S., at 44 (emphasis added). Vartelas, we have several\ntimes stressed, engaged in no criminal activity after\nIIRIRA’s passage. He simply took a brief trip to Greece,\nanticipating a return without incident as in past visits to\nhis parents. No “indefinitely continuing” crime occurred;\ninstead, Vartelas was apprehended because of a pre-\nIIRIRA crime he was “helpless to undo.” Ibid.\n   The Government further refers to lower court decisions\nin cases involving 18 U. S. C. §922(g), which prohibits the\npossession of firearms by convicted felons. Brief for Re-\nspondent 18–19 (citing United States v. Pfeifer, 371 F. 3d\n430, 436 (CA8 2004), and United States v.

S. 570, 626 (2008), however, target a\npresent danger, i.e., the danger posed by felons who bear\narms.

S. C. §922(g)(4). The dissent is\ncorrect that these statutes do not operate retroactively. Rather, they\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

Enhanced punishment imposed\nfor the later offense “ ‘is not to be viewed as . . . [an] addi-\ntional penalty for the earlier crimes,’ but instead, as a\n‘stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is considered\nto be an aggravated offense because [it is] a repetitive\none.’ ” Witte v. United States, 515 U. S. 389, 400 (1995)\n(quoting Gryger v. Burke, 334 U. S. 728, 732 (1948)). In\nVartelas’ case, however, there is no “aggravated . . . repeti-\ntive” offense. There is, in contrast, no post-IIRIRA crimi-\nnal offense at all. Vartelas’ travel abroad and return are\n“innocent” acts, see Fleuti, 374 U. S., at 462, burdened\nonly because of his pre-IIRIRA offense.\n   In sum, Vartelas’ brief trip abroad post-IIRIRA involved\nno criminal infraction. IIRIRA disabled him from leaving\nthe United States and returning as a lawful permanent\nresident. That new disability rested not on any continuing\ncriminal activity, but on a single crime committed years\nbefore IIRIRA’s enactment. The antiretroactivity principle\ninstructs against application of the new proscription\nto render Vartelas a first-time arrival at the country’s\ngateway.\n——————\naddress dangers that arise postenactment: sex offenders with a history\nof child molestation working in close proximity to children, and men-\ntally unstable persons purchasing guns. The act of flying to Greece, in\ncontrast, does not render a lawful permanent resident like Vartelas\nhazardous. Nor is it plausible that Congress’ solution to the problem of\ndangerous lawful permanent residents would be to pass a law that\nwould deter such persons from ever leaving the United States.\n   As for student loans, it is unlikely that the provision noted by the\ndissent, 20 U. S. C. §1091(r), would raise retroactivity questions in the\nfirst place. The statute has a prospective thrust. It concerns\n“[s]uspension of eligibility” when a student receiving a college loan\ncommits a drug crime. The suspension runs “from the date of th[e]\nconviction” for specified periods, e.g., two years for a second offense of\npossession. Moreover, eligibility may be restored before the period of\nineligibility ends if the student establishes, under prescribed criteria,\nhis rehabilitation.\n14                     VARTELAS v.

It matters not that Vartelas may have\nrelied on the prospect of continuing visits to Greece in\ndeciding to plead guilty, the court reasoned. “[I]t would\nborder on the absurd,” the court observed, “to suggest that\nVartelas committed his counterfeiting crime in reliance on\nthe immigration laws.” Id., at 120. This reasoning is\ndoubly flawed.\n   As the Government acknowledges, “th[is] Court has not\nrequired a party challenging the application of a statute to\nshow [he relied on prior law] in structuring his conduct.”\nBrief for Respondent 25–26.

S., at 947.\n   The operative presumption, after all, is that Congress\nintends its laws to govern prospectively only. See supra,\nat 7. “It is a strange ‘presumption,’ ” the Third Circuit\ncommented, “that arises only on . . . a showing [of] actual\nreliance.” Ponnapula v. Ashcroft, 373 F. 3d 480, 491\n(2004). The essential inquiry, as stated in Landgraf, 511\nU. S., at 269–270, is “whether the new provision attaches\nnew legal consequences to events completed before its\nenactment.” That is just what occurred here.\n   In any event, Vartelas likely relied on then-existing\nimmigration law. While the presumption against retroac-\ntive application of statutes does not require a showing of\ndetrimental reliance, see Olatunji, 387 F. 3d, at 389–395,\nreasonable reliance has been noted among the “familiar\nconsiderations” animating the presumption, see Landgraf,\n511 U. S., at 270 (presumption reflects “familiar consid-\nerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled\nexpectations”). Although not a necessary predicate for in-\nvoking the antiretroactivity principle, the likelihood of\nreliance on prior law strengthens the case for reading a\nnewly enacted law prospectively. See Olatunji, 387 F. 3d,\nat 393 (discussing St. Cyr).\n   St. Cyr is illustrative. That case involved a lawful per-\nmanent resident who pleaded guilty to a criminal charge\nthat made him deportable. Under the immigration law in\neffect when he was convicted, he would have been eligible\nto apply for a waiver of deportation. But his removal\nproceeding was commenced after Congress, in IIRIRA,\nwithdrew that dispensation. Disallowance of discretionary\nwaivers, the Court recognized, “attache[d] a new disabil-\nity, in respect to transactions or considerations already\npast.” 533 U.

Because Congress\nmade no such intention plain, ibid., n. 55, we held that the\nprior law, permitting relief from deportation, governed St.\nCyr’s case.\n   As to retroactivity, one might think Vartelas’ case even\neasier than St. Cyr’s. St. Cyr could seek the Attorney\nGeneral’s discretionary dispensation. Vartelas, under\nFleuti, was free, without seeking an official’s permission,\nto make trips of short duration to see and assist his par-\nents in Greece.10 The Second Circuit thought otherwise,\ncompounding its initial misperception (treating reliance as\nessential to application of the antiretroactivity principle).\nThe deportation provision involved in St. Cyr, 8 U.

This case presents a straightforward\nquestion of statutory interpretation: Does that statute\napply to lawful permanent residents who, like Vartelas,\ncommitted one of the specified offenses before 1996, but\ntraveled abroad after 1996? Under the proper approach to\ndetermining a statute’s temporal application, the answer\nis yes.\n                             I\n  The text of §1101(a)(13)(C)(v) does not contain a clear\nstatement answering the question presented here. So\nthe Court is correct that this case is governed by our\nlongstanding interpretive principle that, in the absence of\na contrary indication, a statute will not be construed to\nhave retroactive application. See, e.g., Landgraf v. USI\nFilm Products, 511 U. S. 244, 280 (1994). The operative\nprovision of this text—the provision that specifies the act\nthat it prohibits or prescribes—says that lawful perma-\n2                   VARTELAS v. HOLDER\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nnent residents convicted of offenses similar to Vartelas’s\nmust seek formal “admission” before they return to the\nUnited States from abroad. Since Vartelas returned to the\nUnited States after the statute’s effective date, the appli-\ncation of that text to his reentry does not give the statute a\nretroactive effect.\n   In determining whether a statute applies retroactively,\nwe should concern ourselves with the statute’s actual\noperation on regulated parties, not with retroactivity as an\nabstract concept or as a substitute for fairness concerns.\nIt is impossible to decide whether a statute’s application\nis retrospective or prospective without first identifying a\nreference point—a moment in time to which the statute’s\neffective date is either subsequent or antecedent. (Other-\nwise, the obvious question—retroactive in reference to\nwhat?—remains unanswered.) In my view, the identity of\nthat reference point turns on the activity a statute is\nintended to regulate. For any given regulated party, the\nreference point (or “retroactivity event”) is the moment at\nwhich the party does what the statute forbids or fails to do\nwhat it requires. See Martin v. Hadix, 527 U. S. 343, 362–\n363 (1999) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment); Landgraf, supra, at 291 (SCALIA, J., concur-\nring in judgments). With an identified reference point, the\nretroactivity analysis is simple. If a person has engaged in\nthe primary regulated activity before the statute’s effective\ndate, then the statute’s application would be retroactive.\nBut if a person engages in the primary regulated activity\nafter the statute’s effective date, then the statute’s appli-\ncation is prospective only. In the latter case, the interpre-\ntive presumption against retroactivity does not bar the\nstatute’s application.\n   Under that commonsense approach, this is a relatively\neasy case. Although the class of aliens affected by\n§1101(a)(13)(C)(v) is defined with respect to past crimes,\nthe regulated activity is reentry into the United States. By\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nits terms, the statute is all about controlling admission at\nthe border. It specifies six criteria to identify lawful per-\nmanent residents who are subject to formal “admission”\nprocedures, most of which relate to the circumstances of\ndeparture, the trip itself, or reentry. The titles of the\nstatutory sections containing §1101(a)(13)(C)(v) confirm\nits focus on admission, rather than crime: The provision is\nlocated within Title III of IIRIRA (“Inspection, Apprehen-\nsion, Detention, Adjudication, and Removal of Inadmissi-\nble and Deportable Aliens”), under Subtitle A (“Revision of\nProcedures for Removal of Aliens”), and §301 (“Treating\nPersons Present in the United States Without Authori-\nzation as Not Admitted”). 110 Stat. 3009–575. And the\nspecific subsection of IIRIRA at issue (§301(a), entitled\n“ ‘Admission’ Defined”) is an amendment to the definition\nof “entry” in the general “Definitions” section of the Immi-\ngration and Nationality Act (INA). See ante, at 2–3. The\noriginal provision told border officials how to regulate\nadmission—not how to punish crime—and the amendment\ndoes as well.\n    Section 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) thus has no retroactive effect\non Vartelas because the reference point here—Vartelas’s\nreadmission to the United States after a trip abroad—\noccurred years after the statute’s effective date. Although\nVartelas cannot change the fact of his prior conviction,\nhe could have avoided entirely the consequences of\n§1101(a)(13)(C)(v) by simply remaining in the United\nStates or, having left, remaining in Greece.            That\n§1101(a)(13)(C)(v) had no effect on Vartelas until he per-\nformed a post-enactment activity is a clear indication\nthat the statute’s application is purely prospective. See\nFernandez-Vargas v. Gonzales, 548 U. S. 30, 45, n. 11,\n46 (2006) (no retroactive effect where the statute in\nquestion did “not operate on a completed preenactment\nact” and instead turned on “a failure to take timely action\nthat would have avoided application of the new law\n4                      VARTELAS v.

Ante,\nat 11. That assertion does not, however, have any basis\nin the statute’s text or structure, and the Court does not\npretend otherwise. Instead, the Court simply asserts that\nVartelas’s “lawful foreign travel” surely could not be the\n“reason for the ‘new disability’ imposed on him.” Ibid.\n(emphasis added). But the reason for a prohibition has\nnothing to do with whether the prohibition is being ap-\nplied to a past rather than a future act. It may be relevant\nto other legal inquiries—for example, to whether a legisla-\ntive act violates one of the Ex Post Facto Clauses in Article\nI, see, e.g., Smith v. Doe, 538 U. S. 84, 92 (2003), or one of\nthe Due Process Clauses in the Fifth and Fourteenth\nAmendments, see, e.g., Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla.,\nInc., 348 U. S. 483, 487 (1955), or the Takings Clause in\nthe Fifth Amendment, see, e.g., Kelo v. New London, 545\nU.

But it has no\ndirect bearing upon whether the statute is retroactive.*\n   The Court’s failure to differentiate between the statutory-\ninterpretation question (whether giving certain effect to a\nprovision would make it retroactive and hence presump-\n——————\n  * I say no direct bearing because if the prospective application of a\nstatute would raise constitutional doubts because of its effect on pre-\nenactment conduct, that would be a reason to presume a legislative\nintent not to apply it unless the conduct in question is post-\nenactment—that is, to consider it retroactive when the conduct in\nquestion is pre-enactment. See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 380–\n381 (2005). That is not an issue here. If the statute had expressly\nmade the new “admission” rule applicable to those aliens with prior\nconvictions, its constitutionality would not be in doubt.\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

Take, for example, the Court’s dis-\ncussion of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organ-\nizations Act (RICO). That Act, which targets “patterns\nof racketeering,” expressly defines those “patterns” to\ninclude some pre-enactment conduct. See 18 U. S. C.\n§1961(5). Courts interpreting RICO therefore need not\nconsider the presumption against retroactivity; instead,\nthe cases cited by the majority consider whether RICO\nviolates the Ex Post Facto Clause. See United States v.\nBrown, 555 F. 2d 407, 416–417 (CA5 1977); United States\nv. Campanale, 518 F. 2d 352, 364–365 (CA9 1975)\n(per curiam). The Government recognized this distinction\nand cited RICO to make a point about the Ex Post Facto\nClause rather than the presumption against retroactivity,\nBrief for Respondent 17–18; the Court evidently does not.\n   The Court’s confident assertion that Congress surely\nwould not have meant this statute to apply to Vartelas,\nwhose foreign travel and subsequent return to the United\nStates were innocent events, ante, at 11, 14, simply begs\nthe question presented in this case. Ignorance, of course,\nis no excuse (ignorantia legis neminem excusat); and his\nreturn was entirely lawful only if the statute before us did\nnot render it unlawful. Since IIRIRA’s effective date in\n1996, lawful permanent residents who have committed\ncrimes of moral turpitude are forbidden to leave the\nUnited States and return without formally seeking “ad-\nmission.” See §1101(a)(13)(C)(v). As a result, Vartelas’s\nnumerous trips abroad and “uneventful” reentries into the\nUnited States after the passage of IIRIRA, see ante, at 5,\nwere lawful only if §1101(a)(13)(C)(v) does not apply to\nhim—which is, of course, precisely the matter in dispute\nhere.\n   The Court’s circular reasoning betrays its underlying\n6                   VARTELAS v. HOLDER\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nconcern: Because the Court believes that reentry after a\nbrief trip abroad should be lawful, it will decline to apply a\nstatute that clearly provides otherwise for certain criminal\naliens. (The same instinct likely produced the Court’s\nquestionable statutory interpretation in Rosenberg v.\nFleuti, 374 U. S. 449 (1963).) The Court’s test for retroac-\ntivity—asking whether the statute creates a “new disabil-\nity” in “respect to past events”—invites this focus on fair-\nness. Understandably so, since it is derived from a Justice\nStory opinion interpreting a provision of the New Hamp-\nshire Constitution that forbade retroactive laws—a provi-\nsion comparable to the Federal Constitution’s ex post facto\nprohibition and bearing no relation to the presumption\nagainst retroactivity. What is unfair or irrational (and\nhence should be forbidden) has nothing to do with whether\napplying a statute to a particular act is prospective (and\nthus presumptively intended) or retroactive (and thus\npresumptively unintended). On the latter question, the\n“new disability in respect to past events” test provides no\nmeaningful guidance.\n   I can imagine countless laws that, like §1101(a)(13)\n(C)(v), impose “new disabilities” related to “past events”\nand yet do not operate retroactively. For example, a stat-\nute making persons convicted of drug crimes ineligible for\nstudent loans. See, e.g., 20 U. S. C. §1091(r)(1). Or laws\nprohibiting those convicted of sex crimes from working in\ncertain jobs that involve repeated contact with minors.\nSee, e.g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. §290.95(c) (West Supp.\n2012). Or laws prohibiting those previously committed\nfor mental instability from purchasing guns. See, e.g., 18\nU. S. C. §922(g)(4). The Court concedes that it would not\nconsider the last two laws inapplicable to pre-enactment\nconvictions or commitments. Ante, at 12, n. 7. The Court\ndoes not deny that these statutes impose a “new disability\nin respect to past events,” but it distinguishes them based\non the reason for their enactment: These statutes “address\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

So\nmuch for the new-disability-in-respect-to-past-events test;\nit has now become a new-disability-not-designed-to-guard-\nagainst-future-danger test. But why is guarding against\nfuture danger the only reason Congress may wish to regu-\nlate future action in light of past events? It obviously is\nnot. So the Court must invent yet another doctrine to\naddress my first example, the law making persons\nconvicted of drug crimes ineligible for student loans.\nAccording to the Court, that statute differs from\n§1101(a)(13)(C)(v) because it “has a prospective thrust.”\nAnte, at 13, n. 7. I cannot imagine what that means, other\nthan that the statute regulates post-enactment con-\nduct. But, of course, so does §1101(a)(13)(C)(v). Rather\nthan reconciling any of these distinctions with Justice\nStory’s formulation of retroactivity, the Court leaves to\nlower courts the unenviable task of identifying new-\ndisabilities-not-designed-to-guard-against-future-danger-\nand-also-lacking-a-prospective-thrust.\n   And anyway, is there any doubt that §1101(a)(13)(C)(v)\nis intended to guard against the “dangers that arise\npostenactment” from having aliens in our midst who have\nshown themselves to have proclivity for crime? Must that\nbe rejected as its purpose simply because Congress has not\nsought to achieve it by all possible means—by ferreting\nout such dangerous aliens and going through the expen-\nsive and lengthy process of deporting them? At least some\nof the post-enactment danger can readily be eliminated by\nforcing lawful permanent residents who have committed\ncertain crimes to undergo formal “admission” procedures\nat our borders. Indeed, by limiting criminal aliens’ oppor-\ntunities to travel and then return to the United States,\n§1101(a)(13)(C)(v) may encourage self-deportation. But all\nthis is irrelevant. The positing of legislative “purpose” is\nalways a slippery enterprise compared to the simple\ndetermination of whether a statute regulates a future\n8                   VARTELAS v. HOLDER\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nevent—and it is that, rather than the Court’s pronounce-\nment of some forward-looking reason, which governs\nwhether a statute has retroactive effect.\n   Finally, I cannot avoid observing that even if the Court’s\nconcern about the fairness or rationality of applying\n§1101(a)(13)(C)(v) to Vartelas were relevant to the statu-\ntory interpretation question, that concern is greatly exag-\ngerated. In disregard of a federal statute, convicted crimi-\nnal Vartelas repeatedly traveled to and from Greece\nwithout ever seeking formal admission at this country’s\nborders. When he was finally unlucky enough to be ap-\nprehended, and sought discretionary relief from removal\nunder former §212(c) of the INA, 8 U. S. C. §1182(c) (1994\ned.), the Immigration Judge denying his application found\nthat Vartelas had made frequent trips to Greece and had\nremained there for long periods of time, that he was “a\nserious tax evader,” that he had offered testimony that\nwas “close to incredible,” and that he had not shown hard-\nship to himself or his estranged wife and children should\nhe be removed. See 620 F. 3d 108, 111 (CA2 2010); Brief\nfor Respondent 5 (internal quotation marks omitted). In\ndecrying the “harsh penalty” imposed by this statute on\nVartelas, the Court ignores those inconvenient facts.\nAnte, at 9. But never mind. Under any sensible approach\nto the presumption against retroactivity, these factual\nsubtleties should be irrelevant to the temporal application\nof §1101(a)(13)(C)(v).\n                       *     *    *\n  This case raises a plain-vanilla question of statutory\ninterpretation, not broader questions about frustrated\nexpectations or fairness. Our approach to answering that\nquestion should be similarly straightforward: We should\ndetermine what relevant activity the statute regulates\n(here, reentry); absent a clear statement otherwise, only\nsuch relevant activity which occurs after the statute’s\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

If, as so construed, the statute is unfair or irra-\ntional enough to violate the Constitution, that is another\nmatter entirely, and one not presented here. Our inter-\npretive presumption against retroactivity, however, is just\nthat—a tool to ascertain what the statute means, not a\nlicense to rewrite the statute in a way the Court considers\nmore desirable.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/626207/", "sha1": "85aa3638cd9aecef871a6e6d09e28e773d9128a1", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2012-03-28T07:21:19"}
