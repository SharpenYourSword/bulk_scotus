Argued November 30, 2011—Decided March 28, 2012\r\nRespondent Cooper, a licensed pilot, failed to disclose his human im-\r\n  munodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosis to the Federal Aviation Admin-\r\n  istration (FAA) at a time when the agency did not issue medical cer-\r\n  tificates, which are required to operate an aircraft, to persons with\r\n  HIV. Subsequently, respondent applied to the Social Security Ad-\r\n  ministration (SSA) and received long-term disability benefits on the\r\n  basis of his HIV status. Thereafter, he renewed his certificate with\r\n  the FAA on several occasions, each time intentionally withholding in-\r\n  formation about his condition. The Department of Transportation\r\n  (DOT), the FAA’s parent agency, launched a joint criminal investiga-\r\n  tion with the SSA to identify medically unfit individuals who had ob-\r\n  tained FAA certifications. The DOT provided the SSA with the\r\n  names of licensed pilots, and the SSA, in turn, provided the DOT\r\n  with a spreadsheet containing information on those pilots who had\r\n  also received disability benefits. Respondent’s name appeared on the\r\n  spreadsheet, and an investigation led to his admission that he had\r\n  intentionally withheld information about his HIV status from the\r\n  FAA. His pilot certificate was revoked, and he was indicted for mak-\r\n  ing false statements to a Government agency. He pleaded guilty and\r\n  was fined and sentenced to probation. He then filed suit, alleging\r\n  that the FAA, DOT, and SSA violated the Privacy Act of 1974, which\r\n  contains a detailed set of requirements for the management of rec-\r\n  ords held by Executive Branch agencies. The Act allows an aggrieved\r\n  individual to sue for “actual damages,” 5 U. S. C. §552a(g)(4)(A), if\r\n  the Government intentionally or willfully violates the Act’s require-\r\n  ments in such a way as to adversely affect the individual. Specifical-\r\n  ly, respondent claimed that the unlawful disclosure to the DOT of his\r\n2                           FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                                Syllabus\r\n\r\n    confidential medical information had caused him mental and emo-\r\n    tional distress. The District Court concluded that the Government\r\n    had violated the Act. But, finding the term “actual damages” ambig-\r\n    uous, the court relied on the sovereign immunity canon, which pro-\r\n    vides that sovereign immunity waivers must be strictly construed in\r\n    the Government’s favor, to hold that the Act does not authorize the\r\n    recovery of nonpecuniary damages. Reversing the District Court, the\r\n    Ninth Circuit concluded that “actual damages” in the Act is not am-\r\n    biguous and includes damages for mental and emotional distress.\r\nHeld: The Privacy Act does not unequivocally authorize damages for\r\n mental or emotional distress and therefore does not waive the Gov-\r\n ernment’s sovereign immunity from liability for such harms. Pp. 4–\r\n 19.\r\n    (a) A waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally ex-\r\n pressed in statutory text, see e.g., Lane v. Peña, 518 U. S. 187, 192,\r\n and any ambiguities are to be construed in favor of immunity, United\r\n States v. Williams, 514 U. S. 527, 531. Ambiguity exists if there is a\r\n plausible interpretation of the statute that would not allow money\r\n damages against the Government. United States v. Nordic Village,\r\n Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 37. Pp. 5–6.\r\n    (b) The term “actual damages” in the Privacy Act is a legal term of\r\n art, and Congress, when it employs a term of art, “ ‘presumably\r\n knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each bor-\r\n rowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken,’ ” Molzof\r\n v. United States, 502 U. S. 301, 307. Even as a legal term, the precise\r\n meaning of “actual damages” is far from clear. Although the term is\r\n sometimes understood to include nonpecuniary harm, it has also been\r\n used or construed more narrowly to cover damages for only pecuniary\r\n harm. Because of the term’s chameleon-like quality, it must be con-\r\n sidered in the particular context in which it appears. Pp. 6–9.\r\n    (c) The Privacy Act serves interests similar to those protected by\r\n defamation and privacy torts. Its remedial provision, under which\r\n plaintiffs can recover a minimum award of $1,000 if they first prove\r\n at least some “actual damages,” “parallels” the common-law torts of\r\n libel per quod and slander, under which plaintiffs can recover “gen-\r\n eral damages” if they first prove “special damages.” Doe v. Chao, 540\r\n U. S. 614, 625. “Special damages” are limited to actual pecuniary\r\n loss, which must be specially pleaded and proved. “General damag-\r\n es” cover nonpecuniary loss and need not be pleaded or proved. This\r\n parallel suggests the possibility that Congress intended the term “ac-\r\n tual damages” to mean “special damages,” thus barring Privacy Act\r\n victims from any recovery unless they can first show some actual pe-\r\n cuniary harm. That Congress would choose “actual damages” instead\r\n of “special damages” is not without precedent, as the terms have oc-\r\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\r\n\r\n                                Syllabus\r\n\r\n  casionally been used interchangeably. Furthermore, any doubt about\r\n  the plausibility of construing “actual damages” as special damages in\r\n  the Privacy Act is put to rest by Congress’ deliberate refusal to allow\r\n  recovery for “general damages.” In common-law defamation and pri-\r\n  vacy cases, special damages is the only category of compensatory\r\n  damages other than general damages. Because Congress declined to\r\n  authorize general damages, it is reasonable to infer that Congress in-\r\n  tended the term “actual damages” in the Act to mean special damag-\r\n  es for proven pecuniary loss. Pp. 9–14.\r\n     (d) Although the contrary reading of the Privacy Act accepted by\r\n  the Ninth Circuit and advanced by respondent is not inconceivable, it\r\n  is plausible to read the Act as authorizing only damages for economic\r\n  loss. Because Congress did not speak unequivocally, the Court\r\n  adopts an interpretation of “actual damages” limited to proven pecu-\r\n  niary harm. To do otherwise would expand the scope of Congress’\r\n  sovereign immunity waiver beyond what the statutory text clearly\r\n  requires. P. 14.\r\n     (e) Respondent raises several counterarguments: (1) common-law\r\n  cases often define “actual damages” to mean all compensatory dam-\r\n  ages; (2) the elimination of “general damages” from the Privacy Act\r\n  means that there can be no recovery for presumed damages, but\r\n  plaintiffs can still recover for proven mental and emotional distress;\r\n  (3) because some courts have construed “actual damages” in similar\r\n  statutes to include mental and emotional distress, Congress must\r\n  have intended “actual damages” in the Act to include mental and\r\n  emotional distress as well; and (4) precluding nonpecuniary damages\r\n  would lead to absurd results, thereby frustrating the Act’s remedial\r\n  purpose. None of these arguments overcomes the sovereign immuni-\r\n  ty canon.

S. C.\r\n§552a, contains a comprehensive and detailed set of re­\r\nquirements for the management of confidential records\r\nheld by Executive Branch agencies. If an agency fails to\r\ncomply with those requirements “in such a way as to have\r\nan adverse effect on an individual,” the Act authorizes the\r\nindividual to bring a civil action against the agency.\r\n§552a(g)(1)(D). For violations found to be “intentional or\r\nwillful,” the United States is liable for “actual damages.”\r\n§552a(g)(4)(A). In this case, we must decide whether the\r\nterm “actual damages,” as used in the Privacy Act, in­\r\ncludes damages for mental or emotional distress. We hold\r\nthat it does not.\r\n                                I\r\n   The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires\r\npilots to obtain a pilot certificate and medical certificate as\r\na precondition for operating an aircraft. 14 CFR §§61.3(a),\r\n(c) (2011). Pilots must periodically renew their medical\r\ncertificates to ensure compliance with FAA medical stand­\r\n2                     FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\nards. See §61.23(d). When applying for renewal, pilots\r\nmust disclose any illnesses, disabilities, or surgeries they\r\nhave had, and they must identify any medications they are\r\ntaking. See 14 CFR pt. 67.\r\n   Respondent Stanmore Cooper has been a private pilot\r\nsince 1964. In 1985, he was diagnosed with a human im-\r\nmunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and began taking\r\nantiretroviral medication. At that time, the FAA did not\r\nissue medical certificates to persons with respondent’s\r\ncondition. Knowing that he would not qualify for renewal\r\nof his medical certificate, respondent initially grounded\r\nhimself and chose not to apply. In 1994, however, he ap-\r\nplied for and received a medical certificate, but he did so\r\nwithout disclosing his HIV status or his medication. He\r\nrenewed his certificate in 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2004,\r\neach time intentionally withholding information about his\r\ncondition.\r\n   When respondent’s health deteriorated in 1995, he\r\napplied for long-term disability benefits under Title II of\r\nthe Social Security Act, 42 U. S. C. §401 et seq. To sub­\r\nstantiate his claim, he disclosed his HIV status to the\r\nSocial Security Administration (SSA), which awarded him\r\nbenefits for the year from August 1995 to August 1996.\r\n   In 2002, the Department of Transportation (DOT), the\r\nFAA’s parent agency, launched a joint criminal investiga­\r\ntion with the SSA, known as “Operation Safe Pilot,” to\r\nidentify medically unfit individuals who had obtained FAA\r\ncertifications to fly. The DOT gave the SSA a list of names\r\nand other identifying information of 45,000 licensed pilots\r\nin northern California. The SSA then compared the list\r\nwith its own records of benefit recipients and compiled a\r\nspreadsheet, which it gave to the DOT.\r\n   The spreadsheet revealed that respondent had a current\r\nmedical certificate but had also received disability bene­\r\nfits. After reviewing respondent’s FAA medical file and\r\nhis SSA disability file, FAA flight surgeons determined in\r\n                    Cite as: 566 U.

Because of\r\nthese fraudulent omissions, the FAA revoked respondent’s\r\npilot certificate, and he was indicted on three counts of\r\nmaking false statements to a Government agency, in\r\nviolation of 18 U. S. C. §1001. Respondent ultimately\r\npleaded guilty to one count of making and delivering a\r\nfalse official writing, in violation of §1018. He was sen­\r\ntenced to two years of probation and fined $1,000.1\r\n   Claiming that the FAA, DOT, and SSA (hereinafter\r\nGovernment) violated the Privacy Act by sharing his\r\nrecords with one another, respondent filed suit in the\r\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of\r\nCalifornia. He alleged that the unlawful disclosure to the\r\nDOT of his confidential medical information, including his\r\nHIV status, had caused him “humiliation, embarrassment,\r\nmental anguish, fear of social ostracism, and other severe\r\nemotional distress.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 120a. Notably,\r\nhe did not allege any pecuniary or economic loss.\r\n   The District Court granted summary judgment against\r\nrespondent. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2113364\"><a href=\"/opinion/2113364/cooper-v-faa/\"><span class=\"volume\">816</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The court\r\nconcluded that the Government had violated the Privacy\r\nAct and that there was a triable issue of fact as to whether\r\nthe violation was intentional or willful.2 But the court\r\n——————\r\n  1 Respondent eventually applied for recertification as a pilot. After\r\n\r\nreviewing respondent’s medical records, including information about\r\nhis HIV diagnosis and treatment, the FAA reissued his pilot certificate\r\nand medical certificate. Brief for Respondent 5, n. 1.\r\n  2 With certain exceptions, it is unlawful for an agency to disclose a\r\n\r\nrecord to another agency without the written consent of the person to\r\nwhom the record pertains. 5 U. S. C. §552a(b). One exception to this\r\n4                         FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                        Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\nheld that respondent could not recover damages because\r\nhe alleged only mental and emotional harm, not economic\r\nloss. Finding that the term “actual damages” is “facially\r\nambiguous,” id., at 791, and relying on the sovereign\r\nimmunity canon, which provides that waivers of sovereign\r\nimmunity must be strictly construed in favor of the Gov­\r\nernment, the court concluded that the Act does not author­\r\nize the recovery of damages from the Government for\r\nnonpecuniary mental or emotional harm.\r\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir­\r\ncuit reversed and remanded. 622 F. 3d 1016, 1024 (2010).\r\nThe court acknowledged that the term “actual damages”\r\nis a “ ‘chameleon’ ” in that “its meaning changes with the\r\nspecific statute in which it is found.” Id., at 1029. But the\r\ncourt nevertheless held that, as used in the Privacy Act,\r\nthe term includes damages for mental and emotional\r\ndistress. Looking to what it described as “[i]ntrinsic” and\r\n“[e]xtrinsic” sources, id., at 1028, 1031, the court concluded\r\nthat the meaning of “actual damages” in the Privacy\r\nAct is not ambiguous and that “a construction that limits\r\nrecovery to pecuniary loss” is not “plausible,” id., at 1034.\r\n   The Government petitioned for rehearing or rehearing\r\nen banc, but a divided court denied the petition. Id., at\r\n1019. The Government then petitioned for certiorari, and\r\nwe granted review. 564 U. S. ___ (2011).\r\n                          II\r\n  Because respondent seeks to recover monetary compen­\r\nsation from the Government for mental and emotional\r\nharm, we must decide whether the civil remedies provi­\r\n——————\r\nnondisclosure requirement applies when the head of an agency makes a\r\nwritten request for law enforcement purposes to the agency that\r\nmaintains the record. See §552a(b)(7). The agencies in this case could\r\neasily have shared respondent’s medical records pursuant to the\r\nprocedures prescribed by the Privacy Act, but the District Court con­\r\ncluded that they failed to do so.\r\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\nsion of the Privacy Act waives the Government’s sovereign\r\nimmunity with respect to such a recovery.\r\n                             A\r\n   We have said on many occasions that a waiver of sover­\r\neign immunity must be “unequivocally expressed” in\r\nstatutory text. See, e.g., Lane v. Peña, 518 U. S. 187, 192\r\n(1996); United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30,\r\n33 (1992); Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498\r\nU. S. 89, 95 (1990). Legislative history cannot supply a\r\nwaiver that is not clearly evident from the language of\r\nthe statute. Lane, supra, at 192. Any ambiguities in the\r\nstatutory language are to be construed in favor of immu-\r\nnity, United States v. Williams, 514 U. S. 527, 531 (1995),\r\nso that the Government’s consent to be sued is never en-\r\nlarged beyond what a fair reading of the text requires,\r\nRuckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U. S. 680, 685–686 (1983)\r\n(citing Eastern Transp. Co. v. United States, 272 U. S. 675,\r\n686 (1927)). Ambiguity exists if there is a plausible inter­\r\npretation of the statute that would not authorize money\r\ndamages against the Government. Nordic Village, supra,\r\nat 34, 37.\r\n   The question that confronts us here is not whether\r\nCongress has consented to be sued for damages under the\r\nPrivacy Act. That much is clear from the statute, which\r\nexpressly authorizes recovery from the Government for\r\n“actual damages.” Rather, the question at issue concerns\r\nthe scope of that waiver. For the same reason that we\r\nrefuse to enforce a waiver that is not unambiguously\r\nexpressed in the statute, we also construe any ambiguities\r\nin the scope of a waiver in favor of the sovereign. Lane,\r\nsupra, at 192.\r\n   Although this canon of interpretation requires an un­\r\nmistakable statutory expression of congressional intent to\r\nwaive the Government’s immunity, Congress need not\r\nstate its intent in any particular way. We have never\r\n6                      FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\nrequired that Congress use magic words. To the contrary,\r\nwe have observed that the sovereign immunity canon “is\r\na tool for interpreting the law” and that it does not “dis­\r\nplac[e] the other traditional tools of statutory construc­\r\ntion.” Richlin Security Service Co. v. Chertoff, 553 U. S.\r\n571, 589 (2008). What we thus require is that the scope of\r\nCongress’ waiver be clearly discernable from the statutory\r\ntext in light of traditional interpretive tools. If it is not,\r\nthen we take the interpretation most favorable to the\r\nGovernment.\r\n                               B\r\n   The civil remedies provision of the Privacy Act provides\r\nthat, for any “intentional or willful” refusal or failure to\r\ncomply with the Act, the United States shall be liable for\r\n“actual damages sustained by the individual as a result of\r\nthe refusal or failure, but in no case shall a person entitled\r\nto recovery receive less than the sum of $1,000.” 5 U. S. C.\r\n§552a(g)(4)(A). Because Congress did not define “actual\r\ndamages,” respondent urges us to rely on the ordinary\r\nmeaning of the word “actual” as it is defined in standard\r\ngeneral-purpose dictionaries. But as the Court of Appeals\r\nexplained, “actual damages” is a legal term of art, 622\r\nF. 3d, at 1028, and it is a “cardinal rule of statutory con­\r\nstruction” that, when Congress employs a term of art, “ ‘it\r\npresumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that\r\nwere attached to each borrowed word in the body of learn­\r\ning from which it was taken,’ ” Molzof v. United States, 502\r\nU. S. 301, 307 (1992) (quoting Morissette v. United States,\r\n342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952)).\r\n   Even as a legal term, however, the meaning of “actual\r\ndamages” is far from clear. The latest edition of Black’s\r\nLaw Dictionary available when Congress enacted the\r\nPrivacy Act defined “actual damages” as “[r]eal, substan­\r\ntial and just damages, or the amount awarded to a com­\r\nplainant in compensation for his actual and real loss or\r\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\ninjury, as opposed on the one hand to ‘nominal’ damages,\r\nand on the other to ‘exemplary’ or ‘punitive’ damages.”\r\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 467 (rev. 4th ed. 1968). But this\r\ngeneral (and notably circular) definition is of little value\r\nhere because, as the Court of Appeals accurately observed,\r\nthe precise meaning of the term “changes with the specific\r\nstatute in which it is found.” 622 F. 3d, at 1029.\r\n   The term is sometimes understood to include nonpecu­\r\nniary harm. Take, for instance, some courts’ interpreta­\r\ntions of the Fair Housing Act (FHA), 42 U. S. C. §3613(c),\r\nand the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U. S. C.\r\n§§1681n, 1681o. A number of courts have construed “ac­\r\ntual” damages in the remedial provisions of both statutes\r\nto include compensation for mental and emotional dis­\r\ntress. See, e.g., Seaton v. Sky Realty Co., 491 F. 2d 634,\r\n636–638 (CA7 1974) (authorizing compensatory damages\r\nunder the FHA, 42 U. S. C. §3612, the predecessor to\r\n§3613, for humiliation); Steele v. Title Realty Co., 478 F. 2d\r\n380, 384 (CA10 1973) (stating that damages under the\r\nFHA “are not limited to out-of-pocket losses but may\r\ninclude an award for emotional distress and humiliation”);\r\nThompson v. San Antonio Retail Merchants Assn., 682\r\nF. 2d 509, 513–514 (CA5 1982) (per curiam) (explaining\r\nthat, “[e]ven when there are no out-of-pocket expenses,\r\nhumiliation and mental distress do constitute recoverable\r\nelements of damage” under the FCRA); Millstone v.\r\nO’Hanlon Reports, Inc., 528 F. 2d 829, 834–835 (CA8 1976)\r\n(approving an award of damages under the FCRA for “loss\r\nof sleep, nervousness, frustration and mental anguish”).\r\n   In other contexts, however, the term has been used or\r\nconstrued more narrowly to authorize damages for only\r\npecuniary harm. In the wrongful-death provision of the\r\nFederal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), for example, Congress\r\nauthorized “actual or compensatory damages, measured\r\nby the pecuniary injuries resulting from such death.” 28\r\nU. S. C. §2674, ¶2. At least one court has defined “actual\r\n8                           FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\ndamages” in the Copyright Act of 1909, 17 U. S. C. §101(b)\r\n(1970 ed.), as “the extent to which the market value of\r\na copyrighted work has been injured or destroyed by an\r\ninfringement.” Frank Music Corp. v. Metro-Goldwyn-\r\nMayer, Inc., 772 F. 2d 505, 512 (CA9 1985); see also\r\nMackie v. Rieser, 296 F. 3d 909, 917 (CA9 2002) (holding\r\nthat “ ‘hurt feelings’ over the nature of the infringement”\r\nhave no place in the actual damages calculus). And some\r\ncourts have construed “actual damages” in the Securities\r\nExchange Act of 1934, 15 U. S. C. §78bb(a), to mean “some\r\nform of economic loss.” Ryan v. Foster & Marshall, Inc.,\r\n556 F. 2d 460, 464 (CA9 1977); see also Osofsky v. Zipf,\r\n645 F. 2d 107, 111 (CA2 1981) (stating that the purpose of\r\n§78bb(a) “is to compensate civil plaintiffs for economic loss\r\nsuffered as a result of wrongs committed in violation of the\r\n1934 Act”); Herpich v. Wallace, 430 F. 2d 792, 810 (CA5\r\n1970) (noting that the “gist” of an action for damages\r\nunder the Act is “economic injury”).3\r\n   Because the term “actual damages” has this chameleon­\r\nlike quality, we cannot rely on any all-purpose definition\r\nbut must consider the particular context in which the term\r\n——————\r\n   3 This narrow usage is reflected in contemporaneous state-court deci­\r\n\r\nsions as well.

The dissent says that the defini­\r\ntion—“ ‘[a]ctual damages’ compensate for actual injury”—is “plain\r\nenough.” Post, at 3 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). But defining “actual”\r\ndamages by reference to “actual” injury is hardly helpful when our task\r\nis to determine what Congress meant by “actual.” The dissent’s refer­\r\nence to the current version of Black’s Law Dictionary, which provides\r\nthat “actual damages” can mean “tangible damages,” only highlights\r\nthe term’s ambiguity. See Black’s Law Dictionary 445 (9th ed. 2009).\r\nIf “actual damages” can mean “tangible damages,” then it can be\r\nconstrued not to include intangible harm, like mental and emotional\r\ndistress. Similarly unhelpful is the dissent’s citation to a general­\r\npurpose dictionary that defines “actual” as “existing in fact or reality”\r\nand “damages” as “compensation or satisfaction imposed by law for a\r\nwrong or injury.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 22,\r\n571 (2002) (emphasis added). Combining these two lay definitions says\r\nnothing about whether compensation for mental and emotional distress\r\nis in fact imposed by law. The definitions merely beg the question we\r\nare trying to answer. It comes as little surprise, therefore, that “actual\r\ndamages” has taken on different meanings in different statutes, as our\r\nexamples amply illustrate.\r\n10                         FAA v.

Dobbs, Law of\r\nRemedies §7.2, pp. 511–513 (1973) (hereinafter Dobbs).5\r\n“Special damages” are limited to actual pecuniary loss,\r\nwhich must be specially pleaded and proved. 1 D. Hag­\r\ngard, Cooley on Torts §164, p. 580 (4th ed. 1932) (hereinaf­\r\nter Cooley).6 “General damages,” on the other hand, cover\r\n“loss of reputation, shame, mortification, injury to the\r\nfeelings and the like and need not be alleged in detail and\r\nrequire no proof.” Id., §164, at 579.7\r\n——————\r\n  5 Libel  per quod and slander (as opposed to libel and slander per se)\r\napply to a communication that is not defamatory on its face but that is\r\ndefamatory when coupled with some other extrinsic fact.

Special damages do not\r\ninclude mental or emotional distress. See 3 Restatement §575, Com­\r\nment c (“The emotional distress caused to the person slandered by his\r\nknowledge that he has been defamed is not special harm and this is so\r\nalthough the distress results in a serious illness”); Dobbs §7.2, at 520\r\n(“Even under the more modern approach, special damages in defama­\r\ntion cases must be economic in nature, and it is not enough that the\r\nplaintiff has suffered harm to reputation, mental anguish or other\r\ndignitary harm, unless he has also suffered the loss of something\r\nhaving economic value”).\r\n   7 See also id., §3.2, at 139 (explaining that noneconomic harms “are\r\n\r\ncalled general damages”); W.

The basic idea is that\r\nPrivacy Act victims, like victims of libel per quod or slan­\r\nder, are barred from any recovery unless they can first\r\nshow actual—that is, pecuniary or material—harm. Upon\r\nshowing some pecuniary harm, no matter how slight, they\r\ncan recover the statutory minimum of $1,000, presumably\r\nfor any unproven harm. That Congress would choose to\r\nuse the term “actual damages” instead of “special damages”\r\nwas not without precedent. The terms had occasionally\r\nbeen used interchangeably. See, e.g., Wetzel v. Gulf Oil\r\nCorp., 455 F. 2d 857, 862 (CA9 1972) (holding that plain­\r\ntiff could not establish libel per quod because he “did not\r\nintroduce any valid and sufficient evidence of actual dam­\r\nage”); Electric Furnace Corp. v.

S. C.\r\n§552a, p. 712. As we explained in Doe, “Congress left the\r\nquestion of general damages . . . for another day.” 540\r\nU. S., at 622. Although the Commission later recom-\r\nmended that general damages be allowed, ibid., n. 4,\r\nCongress never amended the Act to include them. For\r\nthat reason, we held that it was “beyond serious doubt”\r\nthat general damages are not available for violations of\r\nthe Privacy Act. Id., at 622.\r\n  By authorizing recovery for “actual” but not for “gen­\r\neral” damages, Congress made clear that it viewed those\r\nterms as mutually exclusive. In actions for defamation\r\nand related dignitary torts, two categories of compensa-\r\ntory damages are recoverable: general damages and special\r\ndamages. Cooley §164, at 579; see also 4 Restatement\r\n§867, Comment d (1939) (noting that damages for inter­\r\nference with privacy “can be awarded in the same way in\r\nwhich general damages are given for defamation”).9 Be­\r\n——————\r\n  8 The   dissent disregards these precedents as the product of careless\r\nimprecision. Post, at 8, n. 6. But just as we assume that Congress did\r\nnot act carelessly, we should not be so quick to assume that the courts\r\ndid. The better explanation for these precedents is not that the courts\r\nwere careless, but that the term “actual damages” has a varied mean­\r\ning that, depending on the context, can be limited to compensation for\r\nonly pecuniary harm.\r\n    9 See also Moriarty v.

The Commission understood “actual damages” in\r\nthe Act to be “a synonym for special damages as that term\r\nis used in defamation cases.” Personal Privacy in an\r\nInformation Society: The Report of the Privacy Protection\r\nStudy Commission 530 (July 1977); see also ibid.

Although we are not\r\nbound in any way by the Commission’s report, we think it\r\nconfirms the reasonableness of interpreting “actual dam­\r\nages” in the unique context of the Privacy Act as the\r\nequivalent of special damages.\r\n\r\n——————\r\n792, 794 (1920) (per curiam) (“Generally speaking, there are recognized\r\ntwo classes of damages in libel cases, general damages and special\r\ndamages”); Winans v.

But because the Privacy Act\r\nwaives the Federal Government’s sovereign immunity, the\r\nquestion we must answer is whether it is plausible to read\r\nthe statute, as the Government does, to authorize only\r\ndamages for economic loss. Nordic Village, 503 U. S., at\r\n34, 37. When waiving the Government’s sovereign im­\r\nmunity, Congress must speak unequivocally. Lane, 518\r\nU. S., at 192. Here, we conclude that it did not. As a\r\nconsequence, we adopt an interpretation of “actual dam­\r\nages” limited to proven pecuniary or economic harm. To\r\ndo otherwise would expand the scope of Congress’ sover­\r\neign immunity waiver beyond what the statutory text\r\nclearly requires.\r\n                          III\r\n  None of respondent’s contrary arguments suffices to\r\novercome the sovereign immunity canon.\r\n                             A\r\n   Respondent notes that the term “actual damages” has\r\noften been defined broadly in common-law cases, and in\r\nour own, to include all compensatory damages. See Brief\r\nfor Respondent 18–25. For example, in Birdsall v. Coo­\r\nlidge, 93 U. S. 64 (1876), a patent infringement case, we\r\nobserved that “[c]ompensatory damages and actual dam­\r\nages mean the same thing.” Ibid. And in Gertz v. Robert\r\nWelch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323 (1974), we wrote that actual\r\ninjury in the defamation context “is not limited to out-of­\r\npocket loss” and that it customarily includes “impairment\r\nof reputation and standing in the community, personal\r\nhumiliation, and mental anguish and suffering.” Id., at\r\n350.\r\n   These cases and others cited by respondent stand for the\r\n                      Cite as: 566 U.

But this generic meaning does\r\nnot establish with the requisite clarity that the Privacy\r\nAct, with its distinctive features, authorizes damages for\r\nmental and emotional distress. As we already explained,\r\nthe term “actual damages” takes on different meanings in\r\ndifferent contexts.\r\n                               B\r\n   Respondent’s stronger argument is that the exclusion of\r\n“general damages” from the statute simply means that\r\nthere can be no recovery for presumed damages. Privacy\r\nAct victims can still recover for mental and emotional\r\ndistress, says respondent, so long as it is proved. See Brief\r\nfor Respondent 54–56.10\r\n   This argument is flawed because it suggests that proven\r\nmental and emotional distress does not count as general\r\ndamages. The term “general damages” is not limited to\r\ncompensation for unproven injuries; it includes compensa­\r\ntion for proven injuries as well. See 3 Restatement §621,\r\nComment a (noting that general damages compensate for\r\n“harm which . . . is proved, or, in the absence of proof,\r\nis assumed to have caused to [the plaintiff’s] reputation”).\r\nTo be sure, specific proof of emotional harm is not required\r\nto recover general damages for dignitary torts. Dobbs\r\n§7.3, at 529. But it does not follow that general damages\r\ncannot be recovered for emotional harm that is actually\r\nproved.\r\n   Aside from the fact that general damages need not be\r\nproved, what distinguishes those damages, whether\r\nproved or not, from the only other category of compensa-\r\ntory damages available in the relevant common-law suits is\r\nthe type of harm. In defamation and privacy cases, “the\r\naffront to the plaintiff’s dignity and the emotional harm\r\n——————\r\n 10 The   dissent advances the same argument. See post, at 9–11.\r\n16                    FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\ndone” are “called general damages, to distinguish them\r\nfrom proof of actual economic harm,” which is called “spe­\r\ncial damages.” Id., §3.2, at 139; see also supra, at 10, 12–\r\n13, and nn. 6, 7, 9. Therefore, the converse of general\r\ndamages is special damages, not all proven damages, as\r\nrespondent would have it. Because Congress removed\r\n“general damages” from the Act’s remedial provision, it is\r\nreasonable to infer that Congress foreclosed recovery for\r\nnonpecuniary harm, even if such harm can be proved, and\r\ninstead waived the Government’s sovereign immunity only\r\nwith respect to harm compensable as special damages.\r\n                              C\r\n  Looking beyond the Privacy Act’s text, respondent\r\npoints to the use of the term “actual” damages in the\r\nremedial provisions of the FHA, 42 U. S. C. §3613(c), and\r\nthe FCRA, 15 U. S. C. §§1681n, 1681o. As previously\r\nmentioned, courts have held that “actual” damages within\r\nthe meaning of these statutes include compensation for\r\nmental and emotional distress. Supra, at 7. Citing the\r\nrule of construction that Congress intends the same lan­\r\nguage in similar statutes to have the same meaning, see\r\nNorthcross v. Board of Ed. of Memphis City Schools, 412\r\nU. S. 427, 428 (1973) (per curiam), respondent argues that\r\nthe Privacy Act should also be interpreted as authorizing\r\ndamages for mental and emotional distress. See Brief for\r\nRespondent 25–32.\r\n  Assuming for the sake of argument that these lower\r\ncourt decisions are correct, they provide only weak support\r\nfor respondent’s argument here. Since the term “actual\r\ndamages” can mean different things in different contexts,\r\nstatutes other than the Privacy Act provide only limited\r\ninterpretive aid, and that is especially true here. Neither\r\nthe FHA nor the FCRA contains text that precisely mir­\r\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

Supra, at\r\n12–13. And most importantly, none of the lower court\r\ncases interpreting the statutes, which respondent has\r\ncited, see Brief for Respondent 29–31, involves the sover­\r\neign immunity canon.\r\n   Respondent also points to the FTCA, but the FTCA’s\r\ngeneral liability provision does not even use the term\r\n“actual damages.” It instead provides that the “United\r\nStates shall be liable” for certain tort claims “in the same\r\nmanner and to the same extent as a private individual”\r\nunder relevant state law. 28 U. S. C. §2674, ¶1. For that\r\nreason alone, the FTCA’s general liability provision is not\r\na reliable source for interpreting the term “actual damages”\r\nin the Privacy Act. Nor does the FTCA’s wrongful­\r\ndeath provision—which authorizes “actual or compensa-\r\ntory damages, measured by the pecuniary injuries resulting\r\nfrom such death,” §2674, ¶2—prove that Congress under­\r\nstood the term “actual damages” in the Privacy Act to\r\ninclude nonpecuniary mental and emotional harm. To the\r\ncontrary, it proves that actual damages can be understood\r\nto entail only pecuniary harm depending on the context.\r\nBecause the FTCA, like the FHA and FCRA, does not\r\nshare the same text or design as the Privacy Act, it is not\r\na fitting analog for construing the Act.\r\n——————\r\n  11 Compare   42 U. S. C. §3613(c)(1) (stating that “the court may award\r\nto the plaintiff actual and punitive damages”); 15 U. S. C. §1681n(a)(1)\r\n(authorizing “(A) any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a\r\nresult of the failure or damages of not less than $100 and not more than\r\n$1,000; or (B) . . . actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result\r\nof the failure or $1,000, whichever is greater”); §1681o(a)(1) (authoriz­\r\ning “any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the\r\nfailure”) with 5 U. S. C. §552a(g)(4)(A) (authorizing “actual damages\r\nsustained by the individual as a result of the refusal or failure, but in\r\nno case shall a person entitled to recovery receive less than the sum of\r\n$1,000”).\r\n18                          FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\n                               D\r\n  Finally, respondent argues that excluding damages for\r\nmental and emotional harm would lead to absurd results.\r\nPersons suffering relatively minor pecuniary loss would\r\nbe entitled to recover $1,000, while others suffering only\r\nsevere and debilitating mental or emotional distress would\r\nget nothing. See Brief for Respondent 33–35.\r\n  Contrary to respondent’s suggestion, however, there is\r\nnothing absurd about a scheme that limits the Govern­\r\nment’s Privacy Act liability to harm that can be substanti­\r\nated by proof of tangible economic loss. Respondent in­\r\nsists that such a scheme would frustrate the Privacy Act’s\r\nremedial purpose, but that ignores the fact that, by delib­\r\nerately refusing to authorize general damages, Congress\r\nintended to cabin relief, not to maximize it.12\r\n——————\r\n   12 Despite its rhetoric, the dissent does not dispute most of the steps\r\n\r\nin our analysis. For example, although the dissent belittles the sover­\r\neign immunity canon, the dissent does not call for its abandonment.\r\nSee post, at 2–3. Nor does the dissent point out any error in our under­\r\nstanding of the canon’s meaning. See ibid. The dissent acknowledges\r\nthat statutes and judicial opinions sometimes use the term “actual\r\ndamages” to mean pecuniary harm, see post, at 5, and that determining\r\nits meaning in a particular statute requires consideration of context,\r\nsee ibid. In addition, the dissent concedes—as it must in light of our\r\nreasoning in Doe v. Chao, 540 U. S. 614 (2004)—that the common law\r\nof defamation has relevance in construing the term “actual damages” in\r\nthe Privacy Act. See post, at 7–9.\r\n   The dissent’s argument thus boils down to this: The text and purpose\r\nof the Privacy Act make it clear beyond any reasonable dispute that the\r\nterm “actual damages,” as used in the Act, means compensatory dam­\r\nages for all proven harm and not just damages for pecuniary harm.\r\nThe dissent reasons that, because the Act seeks to prevent pecuniary\r\nand nonpecuniary harm, Congress must have intended to authorize the\r\nrecovery of money damages from the Federal Government for both\r\ntypes of harm. This inference is plausible, but it surely is not unavoid­\r\nable. The Act deters violations of its substantive provisions in other\r\nways—for instance, by permitting recovery for economic injury; by\r\nimposing criminal sanctions for some violations, see 5 U. S. C. §552a(i);\r\nand possibly by allowing for injunctive relief under the Administrative\r\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

To that end, the Act provides a civil\r\nremedy entitling individuals adversely affected by certain\r\nagency misconduct to recover “actual damages” sustained\r\nas a result of the unlawful action.\r\n   Today the Court holds that “actual damages” is limited\r\nto pecuniary loss. Consequently, individuals can no longer\r\nrecover what our precedents and common sense under-\r\nstand to be the primary, and often only, damages sus-\r\ntained as a result of an invasion of privacy, namely mental\r\nor emotional distress. That result is at odds with the text,\r\nstructure, and drafting history of the Act. And it cripples\r\nthe Act’s core purpose of redressing and deterring viola-\r\ntions of privacy interests. I respectfully dissent.\r\n                              I\r\n  The majority concludes that “actual damages” in the\r\ncivil-remedies provision of the Privacy Act allows recovery\r\nfor pecuniary loss alone. But it concedes that its interpre-\r\ntation is not compelled by the plain text of the statute or\r\notherwise required by any other traditional tool of statu-\r\n2                      FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ntory interpretation. And it candidly acknowledges that a\r\ncontrary reading is not “inconceivable.” Ante, at 14. Yet be-\r\ncause it considers its reading of “actual damages” to be\r\n“plausible,” the majority contends that the canon of sover-\r\neign immunity requires adoption of an interpretation most\r\nfavorable to the Government. Ibid.\r\n   The canon simply cannot bear the weight the majority\r\nascribes it. “The sovereign immunity canon is just that—a\r\ncanon of construction. It is a tool for interpreting the law,\r\nand we have never held that it displaces the other tra-\r\nditional tools of statutory construction.” Richlin Security\r\nService Co. v. Chertoff, 553 U. S. 571, 589 (2008) (opinion\r\nof ALITO, J.). Here, traditional tools of statutory construc-\r\ntion—the statute’s text, structure, drafting history, and\r\npurpose—provide a clear answer: The term “actual dam-\r\nages” permits recovery for all injuries established by\r\ncompetent evidence in the record, whether pecuniary or\r\nnonpecuniary, and so encompasses damages for mental\r\nand emotional distress. There is no need to seek refuge in\r\na canon of construction, see id., at 589–590 (declining to\r\nrely on canon as there is “no ambiguity left for us to con-\r\nstrue” after application of “traditional tools of statutory\r\ninterpretation and considerations of stare decisis”), much\r\nless one that has been used so haphazardly in the Court’s\r\nhistory, see United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S.\r\n30, 42 (1992) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (canon is “nothing\r\nbut a judge-made rule that is sometimes favored and\r\nsometimes disfavored”) (collecting cases).\r\n   It bears emphasis that we have said repeatedly that,\r\nwhile “we should not take it upon ourselves to extend\r\nthe waiver [of sovereign immunity] beyond that which\r\nCongress intended,” “[n]either . . . should we assume the\r\nauthority to narrow the waiver that Congress intended.”\r\nUnited States v. Kubrick, 444 U. S. 111, 117–118 (1979)\r\n(emphasis added). See also, e.g., Block v. Neal, 460 U. S.\r\n289, 298 (1983) (“The exemption of the sovereign from suit\r\n                  Cite as: 566 U.

We are not to add to its rigor by refinement of con-\r\nstruction where consent has been announced” (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted)). In the Privacy Act, Congress\r\nexpressly authorized recovery of “actual damages” for\r\ncertain intentional or willful agency misconduct. The\r\nCourt should not “as a self-constituted guardian of the\r\nTreasury import immunity back into a statute designed to\r\nlimit it.” Indian Towing Co. v. United States, 350 U.

Nicklos Drill-\r\ning Co., 505 U. S. 469, 475 (1992). The language of the\r\ncivil-remedies provision of the Privacy Act is clear.\r\n   At the time Congress drafted the Act, Black’s Law Dic-\r\ntionary defined “actual damages” as “[r]eal, substantial\r\nand just damages, or the amount awarded to a complain-\r\nant in compensation for his actual and real loss or in-\r\njury” and as “[s]ynonymous with ‘compensatory damages.’ ”\r\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 467 (rev. 4th ed. 1968) (hereinafter\r\nBlack’s). The majority claims this is a “general” and “no-\r\ntably circular” definition, ante, at 7, but it is unclear why.\r\nThe definition is plain enough: “Actual damages” compen-\r\nsate for actual injury, and thus the term is synonymous\r\nwith compensatory damages. See Black’s 467 (defining\r\n“compensatory damages” as damages that “will compen-\r\nsate the injured party for the injury sustained, and noth-\r\ning more; such as will simply make good or replace the\r\n4                           FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nloss caused by the wrong or injury”).1 There is nothing\r\ncircular about that definition.2 It is the definition this\r\nCourt adopted more than a century ago when we recog-\r\nnized that “[c]ompensatory damages and actual damages\r\nmean the same thing; that is, that the damages shall be\r\nthe result of the injury alleged and proved, and that the\r\namount awarded shall be precisely commensurate with\r\nthe injury suffered.” Birdsall v. Coolidge, 93 U. S. 64\r\n(1876). It is the definition embraced in current legal\r\ndictionaries. See Black’s 445 (9th ed. 2009) (defining\r\n“actual damages” as “[a]n amount awarded to a complain-\r\nant to compensate for a proven injury or loss; damages\r\nthat repay actual losses.—Also termed compensatory\r\ndamages; tangible damages; real damages” (italics omit-\r\nted)). And it is the definition that accords with the plain\r\nand ordinary meaning of the term. See Webster’s Third\r\nNew International Dictionary 22, 571 (2002) (defining\r\n“actual” as “existing in fact or reality” and “damages” as\r\n“compensation or satisfaction imposed by law for a wrong\r\nor injury caused by a violation of a legal right”). Thus,\r\nboth as a term of art and in its plain meaning, “actual\r\ndamages” connotes compensation for proven injuries or\r\n——————\r\n  1 Black’s Law Dictionary also defined “actual damages” as synony-\r\n\r\nmous with “general damages.” Black’s 467. While “general damages”\r\nhas a specialized meaning of presumed damages in libel and slander\r\ncases, see n. 4, infra, it more generally can mean damages that “did in\r\nfact result from the wrong, directly and proximately.” Black’s 468.\r\n  2 The majority declares the definition circular because “defining ‘ac-\r\n\r\ntual’ damages by reference to ‘actual’ injury is hardly helpful when our\r\ntask is to determine what Congress meant by ‘actual.’ ” Ante, at 9, n. 4.\r\n“Actual injury,” however, is far from an unhelpful reference. This\r\nCourt already has recognized in the defamation context that “actual\r\ninjury is not limited to out-of-pocket loss.” Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,\r\n418 U. S. 323, 350 (1974). That accords with the definitions of the\r\nterms. See Black’s 53, 924 (defining “actual” as “[r]eal; substantial;\r\nexisting presently in act, having a valid objective existence as opposed\r\nto that which is merely theoretical or possible,” and “injury” as “[a]ny\r\nwrong or damage done to another”).\r\n                      Cite as: 566 U.

Nothing in the use of that phrase indicates proven\r\ninjuries need be pecuniary in nature.\r\n  The majority discards all this on the asserted ground\r\nthat “the precise meaning of the term ‘changes with the\r\nspecific statute in which it is found.’ ” Ante, at 7 (quoting\r\n622 F. 3d 1016, 1029 (CA9 2010)). Context, of course, is\r\nrelevant to statutory interpretation; it may provide clues\r\nthat Congress did not employ a word or phrase in its\r\nordinary meaning. That well-established interpretive rule\r\ncannot, however, render irrelevant—as the majority would\r\nhave it—the ordinary meaning of “actual damages.”\r\n  Moreover, the authority the majority cites for its claim\r\nthat “actual damages” has no fixed meaning undermines—\r\nrather than supports—its holding. Each cited authority\r\ninvolves either a statute in which Congress expressly\r\ndirected that compensation be measured in strictly eco-\r\nnomic terms, or else a statute (e.g., the Copyright Act of\r\n1909) in which economic loss is the natural and probable\r\nconsequence of a violation of the defined legal interest.3\r\nNeither factor is present here. Notably absent from the\r\nPrivacy Act is any provision so much as hinting that “ac-\r\ntual damages” should be limited to economic loss. And\r\nwhile “ ‘ “hurt feelings” over the nature of the [copyright]\r\ninfringement’ ” may “have no place in the actual damages\r\ncalculus” under the Copyright Act of 1909, ante, at 8 (quot-\r\ning in parenthetical Mackie v. Rieser, 296 F. 3d 909, 917\r\n(CA9 2002)), the majority provides no basis for concluding\r\nthat “hurt feelings” are equally invalid in an Act con-\r\ncerned with safeguarding individual privacy. Thus, while\r\ncontext is no doubt relevant, the majority’s cited authority\r\ndoes little to help its cause in the stated context of this\r\nstatute.\r\n——————\r\n  3 See 28 U. S. C. §2674; 17 U. S. C. §1009(d)(1); 18 U. S. C. §2318(e)(3)\r\n\r\n(2006 ed., Supp. IV); 17 U. S. C. §101(b) (1970 ed.); 15 U. S. C. §78bb(a)\r\n(2006 ed., Supp. IV).\r\n6                      FAA v.

The Act re-\r\nquires agencies to “establish appropriate administrative,\r\ntechnical, and physical safeguards” to ensure against\r\nsecurity breaches that could result in “substantial harm,\r\nembarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any indi-\r\nvidual.” 5 U. S. C. §552a(e)(10). It also requires agencies\r\nto “maintain all records” used in making a determination\r\nabout an individual in a manner that is “reasonably neces-\r\nsary to assure fairness to the individual in the determina-\r\ntion.” §552a(e)(5). Thus an agency violates the terms of\r\nthe Act if it fails, e.g., to maintain safeguards protecting\r\nagainst “embarrassment”; there is no additional require-\r\nment that the pocketbook be implicated. An agency’s\r\nintentional or willful violation of those duties triggers\r\nliability for “actual damages” under §552a(g)(4) in the\r\nevent of an adverse impact. §§552a(g)(1)(C)–(D), (g)(4).\r\n   Adopting a reading of “actual damages” that permits\r\nrecovery for pecuniary loss alone creates a disconnect\r\nbetween the Act’s substantive and remedial provisions. It\r\nallows a swath of Government violations to go unreme-\r\ndied: A federal agency could intentionally or willfully forgo\r\nestablishing safeguards to protect against embarrassment\r\nand no successful private action could be taken against it\r\nfor the harm Congress identified. Only an interpretation\r\nof “actual damages” that permits recovery for nonpecuni-\r\nary harms harmonizes the Act’s substantive and remedial\r\nprovisions. Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341\r\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

It (correctly) in-\r\nfers from them that the Act “serves interests similar to\r\nthose protected by defamation and privacy torts.” Ante,\r\nat 9. It then points to our observation in Doe v. Chao, 540\r\nU. S. 614, 625 (2004), that the Act’s civil-remedies provi-\r\nsion “parallels” the remedial scheme for the common-law\r\ntorts of defamation per quod, which permitted recovery\r\nof “general damages” (i.e., presumed damages) only if a\r\nplaintiff first establishes “special damages” (i.e., monetary\r\nloss).5 Ante, at 10. That “parallel,” the majority con-\r\ncludes, “suggests the possibility that Congress intended\r\nthe term ‘actual damages’ in the Act to mean special dam-\r\nages.” Ante, at 11.\r\n  The majority reads too much into Doe. At issue in that\r\n——————\r\n   4 It bears noting that the Privacy Act does not authorize injunctive\r\n\r\nrelief when a suit is maintained under 5 U. S. C. §§552a(g)(1)(C) and\r\n(D). Rather, injunctive relief is available under the Act only for a\r\nlimited category of suits: suits to amend a record and suits for access to\r\na record. See §§552a(g)(2), (g)(3). Thus an individual who, like peti-\r\ntioner, brings suit under subparagraph (g)(1)(C) or (D) for an inten-\r\ntional or willful violation of the Act will be without a remedy under\r\nthe majority’s reading of “actual damages.”\r\n   5 As the majority notes, “general damages” at common law refers to\r\n\r\ndamages “presumed” to accrue from the violation of the legally pro-\r\ntected right. No proof of actual injury was required. See D. Dobbs,\r\nLaw of Remedies §7.2, p. 513 (1973) (hereinafter Dobbs); Doe, 540 U. S.,\r\nat 621. “Special damages,” in contrast, “meant monetary loss.” Dobbs §7.2,\r\nat 512; Doe, 540 U. S., at 625. Common-law defamation actions falling\r\nwithin the rubric of defamation per se allowed successful plaintiffs to\r\nrecover “general damages.” See Dobbs §7.2, at 513; Doe, 540 U. S., at\r\n621. This stood in contrast to actions sounding in defamation per quod,\r\nwhich permitted recovery only if the plaintiff established “special\r\ndamages.” See Dobbs, §7.2 at 512; Doe, 540 U. S., at 625. Even in\r\ndefamation per quod cases, a plaintiff could recover nonpecuniary\r\ninjuries upon establishing some pecuniary loss. See Dobbs §7.2, at 521;\r\nDoe, 540 U. S., at 625. See also ante, at 10.\r\n8                           FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ncase was the question whether the Act’s civil-suit provi-\r\nsion authorized recovery of a guaranteed minimum award\r\nof $1,000 absent proof of some “actual damages.” The\r\nCourt answered in the negative, and in the course of doing\r\nso replied to petitioner’s argument that there was “some-\r\nthing peculiar in offering some guaranteed damages . . .\r\nonly to those plaintiffs who can demonstrate actual dam-\r\nages.” 540 U. S., at 625. Although the Court cited the\r\nAct’s parallels to defamation per quod actions in noting\r\nthat nothing was “peculiar” about the Act’s remedial\r\nscheme, Doe did not take the further step of deciding that\r\n“actual damages” means economic loss alone. Indeed, it\r\nexpressly reserved that question. Id., at 627, n. 12.\r\n  The majority, moreover, is wrong to conclude that the\r\nAct’s parallels with defamation per quod actions suggest\r\nCongress intended “actual damages” to mean “special\r\ndamages.” Quite the opposite. The fact that Congress\r\n“would probably have known about” defamation per quod\r\nactions, id., at 625, makes it all the more significant that\r\nCongress did not write “special damages” in the civil-\r\nremedies provision. This Court is typically not in the\r\nbusiness of substituting words we think Congress in-\r\ntended to use for words Congress in fact used. Yet that is\r\nprecisely what the majority does when it rewrites “actual\r\ndamages” to mean “special damages.”6 In sum, the statu-\r\ntory context, and in particular the Act’s substantive provi-\r\nsions, confirms the ordinary meaning of “actual damages.”\r\nAlthough the Act shares parallels with common-law defa-\r\nmation torts, such analogies do not warrant a reading of\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  6 The majority cites a collection of lower court opinions that have used\r\n\r\n“actual damages” in place of “special damages” to note that Congress\r\nwould not have been alone in using the former term to refer to the\r\nlatter. Ante, at 11–12. But that a handful of lower courts on occasion\r\nhave been imprecise in their terminology provides no basis to assume\r\nthe Legislature has been equally careless in the text of a statute.\r\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

S.,\r\nat 622.\r\n   As the Court explained in Doe, “[t]he deletion of ‘general\r\ndamages’ from the bill is fairly seen . . . as a deliberate\r\nelimination of any possibility of imputing harm and\r\nawarding presumed damages.” Id., at 623; see also id., at\r\n——————\r\n   7 There is yet another flaw in the majority’s reasoning. At common\r\n\r\nlaw a plaintiff who successfully established “special damages” in an\r\naction for defamation per quod could proceed to recover damages for\r\nemotional and mental distress. See ante, at 10; n. 5, supra. If “Con-\r\ngress intended the term ‘actual damages’ in the Act to mean special\r\ndamages,” ante, at 11, then an individual who successfully establishes\r\nsome pecuniary loss from a violation of the Act—presumably as trivial\r\nas the cost of a bottle of Tylenol—should be permitted to recover for\r\nemotional and mental distress. The majority, of course, does not accept\r\nthat result, and its piecemeal embrace of the common law undermines\r\nits assertion that Congress intended “special damages” in place of\r\n“actual damages.”\r\n   8 See S. 3418, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., §303(c)(1) (1974); H. R. 16373, 93d\r\n\r\nCong., 2d Sess., §3 (1974).\r\n10                      FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n622, n. 5 (“Congress explicitly rejected the proposal to\r\nmake presumed damages available for Privacy Act viola-\r\ntions”). The elimination of presumed damages from the\r\nbill can only reasonably imply that what Congress left\r\nbehind—“actual damages”—comprised damages that are\r\nnot presumed, i.e., damages proven by competent evidence\r\nin the record. See Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S.\r\n323, 349–350 (1974) (distinguishing in defamation context\r\nbetween presumed damages and damages for actual inju-\r\nries sustained by competent evidence in the record, which\r\ninclude “impairment of reputation and standing in the\r\ncommunity, personal humiliation, and mental anguish\r\nand suffering”); Carey v. Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 262–264\r\n(1978) (distinguishing between presumed damages and\r\nproven damages for mental and emotional distress).\r\n   Rather than view the deletion of general damages (pre-\r\nsumed damages) as leaving the converse (proven dam-\r\nages), the majority supposes that the deletion leaves only a\r\nsubset of proven damages—those of an economic nature,\r\ni.e., “special damages.” Once again, however, the major-\r\nity’s insistence that “Congress intended ‘actual damages’ in\r\nthe Privacy Act to mean special damages for proven pecu-\r\nniary loss,” ante, at 13, finds no basis in the statutory text,\r\nsee supra, at 8. And its response to the conclusion that\r\nCongress retained recovery for proven damages when it\r\neliminated presumed damages is singularly unsatisfying.\r\nThe majority declares such a conclusion “flawed” because\r\n“general damages” “includes compensation for proven\r\ninjuries as well,” so that “what distinguishes [general]\r\ndamages, whether proved or not, from the only other\r\ncategory of compensatory damages available in the rele-\r\nvant common-law suits is the type of harm” the term\r\nencompasses—which the majority takes to be emotional\r\nharm alone. Ante, at 15–16. That assertion is defective on\r\ntwo scores. First, a plaintiff ’s ability to present proof of\r\ninjury in a defamation per se action (and to recover for\r\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                   11\r\n\r\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nsuch proven injury) does not alter the definition of “gen-\r\neral damages,” which we already explained in Doe means\r\n“presumed damages.” 540 U. S., at 621; see also id., at\r\n623; n. 5, supra. Second, “general damages” is not limited\r\nto a “type” of harm. The majority’s contrary assertion that\r\nthe term permits recovery only for emotional “types” of\r\nharm overlooks the fact that “general damages are partly\r\nbased on the belief that the plaintiff will suffer unprovable\r\npecuniary losses.” Dobbs §7.2, at 514 (emphasis added). It\r\nthus was established at common law that in a defamation\r\nper se action, “the plaintiff is usually free to prove what-\r\never actual pecuniary loss he can,” and “the jury may be\r\npermitted to view the actual pecuniary loss proven as the\r\ntip of the iceberg, assume that there is still more un-\r\nproven, and award damage accordingly.” Ibid.\r\n   At its core, the majority opinion relies on the following\r\nsyllogism: The common law employed two terms of art in\r\ndefamation actions. Because Congress excluded recovery\r\nfor “general damages,” it must have meant to retain recov-\r\nery only for “special damages.” That syllogism, of course,\r\nignores that there is another category of damages. It is\r\nthe very category Congress used in the text of the Privacy\r\nAct: “Actual damages.” However much Congress may\r\nhave drawn “parallels,” ante, at 10, between the Act and\r\nthe common-law tort of defamation, the fact remains that\r\nCongress expressly choose not to use the words “special\r\ndamages.”9\r\n                            D\r\n  I turn finally to the statute’s purpose, for “[a]s in all\r\ncases of statutory interpretation, our task is to interpret\r\n——————\r\n  9 The majority cites the conclusions of the Privacy Protection Study\r\n\r\nCommission in support of its interpretation of “actual damages.” The\r\nmajority rightfully does not claim this piece of postenactment, extratex-\r\ntual material is due any deference; nor do I find its unelaborated\r\nconclusions persuasive.\r\n12                     FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nthe words of th[e] statut[e] in light of the purposes Con-\r\ngress sought to serve.” Chapman v. Houston Welfare\r\nRights Organization, 441 U. S. 600, 608 (1979); see also\r\nDolan v. Postal Service, 546 U. S. 481, 486 (2006) (“Inter-\r\npretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the\r\nwhole statutory text, considering the purpose and context\r\nof the statute, and consulting any precedents or authori-\r\nties that inform the analysis”). The purposes of the Priv-\r\nacy Act could not be more explicit, and they are consistent\r\nwith interpreting “actual damages” according to its ordi-\r\nnary meaning.\r\n   “The historical context of the Act is important to an\r\nunderstanding of its remedial purposes. In 1974, Con-\r\ngress was concerned with curbing the illegal surveillance\r\nand investigation of individuals by federal agencies that\r\nhad been exposed during the Watergate scandal.” Dept.\r\nof Justice, Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties, Overview of\r\nthe Privacy Act 4 (2010). In particular, Congress recog-\r\nnized that “the increasing use of computers and sophisti-\r\ncated information technology . . . has greatly magnified\r\nthe harm to individual privacy that can occur from any\r\ncollection, maintenance, use, or dissemination of personal\r\ninformation.” §2(a), 88 Stat. 1896. Identifying the right to\r\nprivacy as “a personal and fundamental right,” Congress\r\nfound it “necessary and proper” to enact the Privacy Act\r\n“in order to protect the privacy of individuals identified in\r\ninformation systems maintained by Federal agencies.”\r\nIbid.\r\n   Congress explained that the “purpose of this Act is to\r\nprovide certain safeguards for an individual against an\r\ninvasion of personal privacy by requiring Federal agen-\r\ncies, except as otherwise provided by law, to,” inter alia,\r\n“be subject to civil suit for any damages which occur as a\r\nresult of willful or intentional action which violates any\r\nindividual’s rights under this Act.” §2(b)(6), ibid. (empha-\r\nsis added). That statement is an explicit reference to suits\r\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\r\n\r\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nbrought under §552a(g)(4); no other provision speaks to a\r\ncivil suit based on “willful or intentional” agency miscon-\r\nduct. It signals unmistakably congressional recognition\r\nthat the civil-remedies provision is integral to realizing\r\nthe Act’s purposes.\r\n  Reading “actual damages” to permit recovery for any\r\ninjury established by competent evidence in the record—\r\npecuniary or not—best effectuates the statute’s basic\r\npurpose. Although some privacy invasions no doubt result\r\nin economic loss, we have recognized time and again that\r\nthe primary form of injuries is nonpecuniary, and includes\r\nmental distress and personal humiliation. See Time, Inc.\r\nv. Hill, 385 U. S. 374, 385, n. 9 (1967) (“In the ‘right of\r\nprivacy’ cases the primary damage is the mental dis-\r\ntress”); see also Gertz, 418 U. S., at 350 (“[A]ctual injury”\r\nin defamatory falsehood cases “is not limited to out-of-\r\npocket loss. Indeed, the more customary types of actual\r\nharm inflicted by defamatory falsehood include impair-\r\nment of reputation and standing in the community, per-\r\nsonal humiliation, and mental anguish and suffering”).\r\nAccord, 2 Dobbs §7.1.(1), at 259 (2d ed. 1993) (privacy is a\r\ndignitary interest, and “in a great many of the cases” in\r\nwhich the interest is invaded “the only harm is the affront\r\nto the plaintiff ’s dignity as a human being, the damage to\r\nhis self-image, and the resulting mental distress”). That\r\naccords with common sense.\r\n  In interpreting the civil-remedies provision, we must not\r\nforget Congress enacted the Privacy Act to protect pri-\r\nvacy. The majority’s reading of “actual damages” renders\r\nthe remedial provision impotent in the face of concededly\r\nunlawful agency action whenever the injury is solely\r\nnonpecuniary. That result is patently at odds with Con-\r\ngress’ stated purpose. The majority, however, does not\r\ngrapple with the ramifications of its opinion. It acknowl-\r\nedges the suggestion that its holding leads to absurd\r\nresults as it allows individuals suffering relatively minor\r\n14                     FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\npecuniary losses to recover $1,000 while others suffering\r\nsevere mental anguish to recover nothing. But it con-\r\ncludes that “there is nothing absurd about a scheme that\r\nlimits the Government’s Privacy Act liability to harm that\r\ncan be substantiated by proof of tangible economic loss.”\r\nAnte, at 18. Perhaps; it is certainly within Congress’\r\nprerogative to enact the statute the majority envisions,\r\nnamely one that seeks to safeguard against invasions of\r\nprivacy without remedying the primary harm that results\r\nfrom invasions of privacy. The problem for the majority is\r\nthat one looks in vain for any indication in the text of the\r\nstatute before us that Congress intended such a result.\r\nNowhere in the Privacy Act does Congress so much as hint\r\nthat it views a $5 hit to the pocketbook as more worthy of\r\nremedy than debilitating mental distress, and the major-\r\nity’s contrary assumption discounts the gravity of emo-\r\ntional harm caused by an invasion of the personal integ-\r\nrity that privacy protects.\r\n                        *    *     *\r\n  After today, no matter how debilitating and substantial\r\nthe resulting mental anguish, an individual harmed by\r\na federal agency’s intentional or willful violation of the\r\nPrivacy Act will be left without a remedy unless he or she\r\nis able to prove pecuniary harm. That is not the result\r\nCongress intended when it enacted an Act with the ex-\r\npress purpose of safeguarding individual privacy against\r\nGovernment invasion. And it is not a result remotely\r\nsuggested by anything in the text, structure, or history of\r\nthe Act. For those reasons, I respectfully dissent.\r\n</pre>", "id": 626208, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2012/03/28/Faa_v._Cooper.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2011                                       1\r\n\r\n                                       Syllabus\r\n\r\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\r\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\r\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\r\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\r\n       See United States v.

Argued November 30, 2011—Decided March 28, 2012\r\nRespondent Cooper, a licensed pilot, failed to disclose his human im-\r\n  munodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosis to the Federal Aviation Admin-\r\n  istration (FAA) at a time when the agency did not issue medical cer-\r\n  tificates, which are required to operate an aircraft, to persons with\r\n  HIV. Subsequently, respondent applied to the Social Security Ad-\r\n  ministration (SSA) and received long-term disability benefits on the\r\n  basis of his HIV status. Thereafter, he renewed his certificate with\r\n  the FAA on several occasions, each time intentionally withholding in-\r\n  formation about his condition. The Department of Transportation\r\n  (DOT), the FAA’s parent agency, launched a joint criminal investiga-\r\n  tion with the SSA to identify medically unfit individuals who had ob-\r\n  tained FAA certifications. The DOT provided the SSA with the\r\n  names of licensed pilots, and the SSA, in turn, provided the DOT\r\n  with a spreadsheet containing information on those pilots who had\r\n  also received disability benefits. Respondent’s name appeared on the\r\n  spreadsheet, and an investigation led to his admission that he had\r\n  intentionally withheld information about his HIV status from the\r\n  FAA. His pilot certificate was revoked, and he was indicted for mak-\r\n  ing false statements to a Government agency. He pleaded guilty and\r\n  was fined and sentenced to probation. He then filed suit, alleging\r\n  that the FAA, DOT, and SSA violated the Privacy Act of 1974, which\r\n  contains a detailed set of requirements for the management of rec-\r\n  ords held by Executive Branch agencies. The Act allows an aggrieved\r\n  individual to sue for “actual damages,” 5 U. S. C. §552a(g)(4)(A), if\r\n  the Government intentionally or willfully violates the Act’s require-\r\n  ments in such a way as to adversely affect the individual. Specifical-\r\n  ly, respondent claimed that the unlawful disclosure to the DOT of his\r\n2                           FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                                Syllabus\r\n\r\n    confidential medical information had caused him mental and emo-\r\n    tional distress. The District Court concluded that the Government\r\n    had violated the Act. But, finding the term “actual damages” ambig-\r\n    uous, the court relied on the sovereign immunity canon, which pro-\r\n    vides that sovereign immunity waivers must be strictly construed in\r\n    the Government’s favor, to hold that the Act does not authorize the\r\n    recovery of nonpecuniary damages. Reversing the District Court, the\r\n    Ninth Circuit concluded that “actual damages” in the Act is not am-\r\n    biguous and includes damages for mental and emotional distress.\r\nHeld: The Privacy Act does not unequivocally authorize damages for\r\n mental or emotional distress and therefore does not waive the Gov-\r\n ernment’s sovereign immunity from liability for such harms. Pp. 4–\r\n 19.\r\n    (a) A waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally ex-\r\n pressed in statutory text, see e.g., Lane v. Peña, 518 U. S. 187, 192,\r\n and any ambiguities are to be construed in favor of immunity, United\r\n States v. Williams, 514 U. S. 527, 531. Ambiguity exists if there is a\r\n plausible interpretation of the statute that would not allow money\r\n damages against the Government. United States v. Nordic Village,\r\n Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 37. Pp. 5–6.\r\n    (b) The term “actual damages” in the Privacy Act is a legal term of\r\n art, and Congress, when it employs a term of art, “ ‘presumably\r\n knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each bor-\r\n rowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken,’ ” Molzof\r\n v. United States, 502 U. S. 301, 307. Even as a legal term, the precise\r\n meaning of “actual damages” is far from clear. Although the term is\r\n sometimes understood to include nonpecuniary harm, it has also been\r\n used or construed more narrowly to cover damages for only pecuniary\r\n harm. Because of the term’s chameleon-like quality, it must be con-\r\n sidered in the particular context in which it appears. Pp. 6–9.\r\n    (c) The Privacy Act serves interests similar to those protected by\r\n defamation and privacy torts. Its remedial provision, under which\r\n plaintiffs can recover a minimum award of $1,000 if they first prove\r\n at least some “actual damages,” “parallels” the common-law torts of\r\n libel per quod and slander, under which plaintiffs can recover “gen-\r\n eral damages” if they first prove “special damages.” Doe v. Chao, 540\r\n U. S. 614, 625. “Special damages” are limited to actual pecuniary\r\n loss, which must be specially pleaded and proved. “General damag-\r\n es” cover nonpecuniary loss and need not be pleaded or proved. This\r\n parallel suggests the possibility that Congress intended the term “ac-\r\n tual damages” to mean “special damages,” thus barring Privacy Act\r\n victims from any recovery unless they can first show some actual pe-\r\n cuniary harm. That Congress would choose “actual damages” instead\r\n of “special damages” is not without precedent, as the terms have oc-\r\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\r\n\r\n                                Syllabus\r\n\r\n  casionally been used interchangeably. Furthermore, any doubt about\r\n  the plausibility of construing “actual damages” as special damages in\r\n  the Privacy Act is put to rest by Congress’ deliberate refusal to allow\r\n  recovery for “general damages.” In common-law defamation and pri-\r\n  vacy cases, special damages is the only category of compensatory\r\n  damages other than general damages. Because Congress declined to\r\n  authorize general damages, it is reasonable to infer that Congress in-\r\n  tended the term “actual damages” in the Act to mean special damag-\r\n  es for proven pecuniary loss. Pp. 9–14.\r\n     (d) Although the contrary reading of the Privacy Act accepted by\r\n  the Ninth Circuit and advanced by respondent is not inconceivable, it\r\n  is plausible to read the Act as authorizing only damages for economic\r\n  loss. Because Congress did not speak unequivocally, the Court\r\n  adopts an interpretation of “actual damages” limited to proven pecu-\r\n  niary harm. To do otherwise would expand the scope of Congress’\r\n  sovereign immunity waiver beyond what the statutory text clearly\r\n  requires. P. 14.\r\n     (e) Respondent raises several counterarguments: (1) common-law\r\n  cases often define “actual damages” to mean all compensatory dam-\r\n  ages; (2) the elimination of “general damages” from the Privacy Act\r\n  means that there can be no recovery for presumed damages, but\r\n  plaintiffs can still recover for proven mental and emotional distress;\r\n  (3) because some courts have construed “actual damages” in similar\r\n  statutes to include mental and emotional distress, Congress must\r\n  have intended “actual damages” in the Act to include mental and\r\n  emotional distress as well; and (4) precluding nonpecuniary damages\r\n  would lead to absurd results, thereby frustrating the Act’s remedial\r\n  purpose. None of these arguments overcomes the sovereign immuni-\r\n  ty canon.

S. C.\r\n§552a, contains a comprehensive and detailed set of re­\r\nquirements for the management of confidential records\r\nheld by Executive Branch agencies. If an agency fails to\r\ncomply with those requirements “in such a way as to have\r\nan adverse effect on an individual,” the Act authorizes the\r\nindividual to bring a civil action against the agency.\r\n§552a(g)(1)(D). For violations found to be “intentional or\r\nwillful,” the United States is liable for “actual damages.”\r\n§552a(g)(4)(A). In this case, we must decide whether the\r\nterm “actual damages,” as used in the Privacy Act, in­\r\ncludes damages for mental or emotional distress. We hold\r\nthat it does not.\r\n                                I\r\n   The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires\r\npilots to obtain a pilot certificate and medical certificate as\r\na precondition for operating an aircraft. 14 CFR §§61.3(a),\r\n(c) (2011). Pilots must periodically renew their medical\r\ncertificates to ensure compliance with FAA medical stand­\r\n2                     FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\nards. See §61.23(d). When applying for renewal, pilots\r\nmust disclose any illnesses, disabilities, or surgeries they\r\nhave had, and they must identify any medications they are\r\ntaking. See 14 CFR pt. 67.\r\n   Respondent Stanmore Cooper has been a private pilot\r\nsince 1964. In 1985, he was diagnosed with a human im-\r\nmunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and began taking\r\nantiretroviral medication. At that time, the FAA did not\r\nissue medical certificates to persons with respondent’s\r\ncondition. Knowing that he would not qualify for renewal\r\nof his medical certificate, respondent initially grounded\r\nhimself and chose not to apply. In 1994, however, he ap-\r\nplied for and received a medical certificate, but he did so\r\nwithout disclosing his HIV status or his medication. He\r\nrenewed his certificate in 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2004,\r\neach time intentionally withholding information about his\r\ncondition.\r\n   When respondent’s health deteriorated in 1995, he\r\napplied for long-term disability benefits under Title II of\r\nthe Social Security Act, 42 U. S. C. §401 et seq. To sub­\r\nstantiate his claim, he disclosed his HIV status to the\r\nSocial Security Administration (SSA), which awarded him\r\nbenefits for the year from August 1995 to August 1996.\r\n   In 2002, the Department of Transportation (DOT), the\r\nFAA’s parent agency, launched a joint criminal investiga­\r\ntion with the SSA, known as “Operation Safe Pilot,” to\r\nidentify medically unfit individuals who had obtained FAA\r\ncertifications to fly. The DOT gave the SSA a list of names\r\nand other identifying information of 45,000 licensed pilots\r\nin northern California. The SSA then compared the list\r\nwith its own records of benefit recipients and compiled a\r\nspreadsheet, which it gave to the DOT.\r\n   The spreadsheet revealed that respondent had a current\r\nmedical certificate but had also received disability bene­\r\nfits. After reviewing respondent’s FAA medical file and\r\nhis SSA disability file, FAA flight surgeons determined in\r\n                    Cite as: 566 U.

Because of\r\nthese fraudulent omissions, the FAA revoked respondent’s\r\npilot certificate, and he was indicted on three counts of\r\nmaking false statements to a Government agency, in\r\nviolation of 18 U. S. C. §1001. Respondent ultimately\r\npleaded guilty to one count of making and delivering a\r\nfalse official writing, in violation of §1018. He was sen­\r\ntenced to two years of probation and fined $1,000.1\r\n   Claiming that the FAA, DOT, and SSA (hereinafter\r\nGovernment) violated the Privacy Act by sharing his\r\nrecords with one another, respondent filed suit in the\r\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of\r\nCalifornia. He alleged that the unlawful disclosure to the\r\nDOT of his confidential medical information, including his\r\nHIV status, had caused him “humiliation, embarrassment,\r\nmental anguish, fear of social ostracism, and other severe\r\nemotional distress.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 120a. Notably,\r\nhe did not allege any pecuniary or economic loss.\r\n   The District Court granted summary judgment against\r\nrespondent. 816 F. Supp. 2d 778, 781 (2008). The court\r\nconcluded that the Government had violated the Privacy\r\nAct and that there was a triable issue of fact as to whether\r\nthe violation was intentional or willful.2 But the court\r\n——————\r\n  1 Respondent eventually applied for recertification as a pilot. After\r\n\r\nreviewing respondent’s medical records, including information about\r\nhis HIV diagnosis and treatment, the FAA reissued his pilot certificate\r\nand medical certificate. Brief for Respondent 5, n. 1.\r\n  2 With certain exceptions, it is unlawful for an agency to disclose a\r\n\r\nrecord to another agency without the written consent of the person to\r\nwhom the record pertains. 5 U. S. C. §552a(b). One exception to this\r\n4                         FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                        Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\nheld that respondent could not recover damages because\r\nhe alleged only mental and emotional harm, not economic\r\nloss. Finding that the term “actual damages” is “facially\r\nambiguous,” id., at 791, and relying on the sovereign\r\nimmunity canon, which provides that waivers of sovereign\r\nimmunity must be strictly construed in favor of the Gov­\r\nernment, the court concluded that the Act does not author­\r\nize the recovery of damages from the Government for\r\nnonpecuniary mental or emotional harm.\r\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir­\r\ncuit reversed and remanded. 622 F. 3d 1016, 1024 (2010).\r\nThe court acknowledged that the term “actual damages”\r\nis a “ ‘chameleon’ ” in that “its meaning changes with the\r\nspecific statute in which it is found.” Id., at 1029. But the\r\ncourt nevertheless held that, as used in the Privacy Act,\r\nthe term includes damages for mental and emotional\r\ndistress. Looking to what it described as “[i]ntrinsic” and\r\n“[e]xtrinsic” sources, id., at 1028, 1031, the court concluded\r\nthat the meaning of “actual damages” in the Privacy\r\nAct is not ambiguous and that “a construction that limits\r\nrecovery to pecuniary loss” is not “plausible,” id., at 1034.\r\n   The Government petitioned for rehearing or rehearing\r\nen banc, but a divided court denied the petition. Id., at\r\n1019. The Government then petitioned for certiorari, and\r\nwe granted review. 564 U. S. ___ (2011).\r\n                          II\r\n  Because respondent seeks to recover monetary compen­\r\nsation from the Government for mental and emotional\r\nharm, we must decide whether the civil remedies provi­\r\n——————\r\nnondisclosure requirement applies when the head of an agency makes a\r\nwritten request for law enforcement purposes to the agency that\r\nmaintains the record. See §552a(b)(7). The agencies in this case could\r\neasily have shared respondent’s medical records pursuant to the\r\nprocedures prescribed by the Privacy Act, but the District Court con­\r\ncluded that they failed to do so.\r\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

See, e.g., Lane v. Peña, 518 U. S. 187, 192\r\n(1996); United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30,\r\n33 (1992); Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498\r\nU. S. 89, 95 (1990). Legislative history cannot supply a\r\nwaiver that is not clearly evident from the language of\r\nthe statute. Lane, supra, at 192. Any ambiguities in the\r\nstatutory language are to be construed in favor of immu-\r\nnity, United States v. Williams, 514 U. S. 527, 531 (1995),\r\nso that the Government’s consent to be sued is never en-\r\nlarged beyond what a fair reading of the text requires,\r\nRuckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U. S. 680, 685–686 (1983)\r\n(citing Eastern Transp. Co. v. United States, 272 U. S. 675,\r\n686 (1927)). Ambiguity exists if there is a plausible inter­\r\npretation of the statute that would not authorize money\r\ndamages against the Government. Nordic Village, supra,\r\nat 34, 37.\r\n   The question that confronts us here is not whether\r\nCongress has consented to be sued for damages under the\r\nPrivacy Act. That much is clear from the statute, which\r\nexpressly authorizes recovery from the Government for\r\n“actual damages.” Rather, the question at issue concerns\r\nthe scope of that waiver. For the same reason that we\r\nrefuse to enforce a waiver that is not unambiguously\r\nexpressed in the statute, we also construe any ambiguities\r\nin the scope of a waiver in favor of the sovereign. Lane,\r\nsupra, at 192.\r\n   Although this canon of interpretation requires an un­\r\nmistakable statutory expression of congressional intent to\r\nwaive the Government’s immunity, Congress need not\r\nstate its intent in any particular way. We have never\r\n6                      FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\nrequired that Congress use magic words. To the contrary,\r\nwe have observed that the sovereign immunity canon “is\r\na tool for interpreting the law” and that it does not “dis­\r\nplac[e] the other traditional tools of statutory construc­\r\ntion.” Richlin Security Service Co. v. Chertoff, 553 U. S.\r\n571, 589 (2008). What we thus require is that the scope of\r\nCongress’ waiver be clearly discernable from the statutory\r\ntext in light of traditional interpretive tools. If it is not,\r\nthen we take the interpretation most favorable to the\r\nGovernment.\r\n                               B\r\n   The civil remedies provision of the Privacy Act provides\r\nthat, for any “intentional or willful” refusal or failure to\r\ncomply with the Act, the United States shall be liable for\r\n“actual damages sustained by the individual as a result of\r\nthe refusal or failure, but in no case shall a person entitled\r\nto recovery receive less than the sum of $1,000.” 5 U. S. C.\r\n§552a(g)(4)(A). Because Congress did not define “actual\r\ndamages,” respondent urges us to rely on the ordinary\r\nmeaning of the word “actual” as it is defined in standard\r\ngeneral-purpose dictionaries. But as the Court of Appeals\r\nexplained, “actual damages” is a legal term of art, 622\r\nF. 3d, at 1028, and it is a “cardinal rule of statutory con­\r\nstruction” that, when Congress employs a term of art, “ ‘it\r\npresumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that\r\nwere attached to each borrowed word in the body of learn­\r\ning from which it was taken,’ ” Molzof v. United States, 502\r\nU. S. 301, 307 (1992) (quoting Morissette v. United States,\r\n342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952)).\r\n   Even as a legal term, however, the meaning of “actual\r\ndamages” is far from clear. The latest edition of Black’s\r\nLaw Dictionary available when Congress enacted the\r\nPrivacy Act defined “actual damages” as “[r]eal, substan­\r\ntial and just damages, or the amount awarded to a com­\r\nplainant in compensation for his actual and real loss or\r\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\r\n\r\n                      Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\ninjury, as opposed on the one hand to ‘nominal’ damages,\r\nand on the other to ‘exemplary’ or ‘punitive’ damages.”\r\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 467 (rev. 4th ed. 1968). But this\r\ngeneral (and notably circular) definition is of little value\r\nhere because, as the Court of Appeals accurately observed,\r\nthe precise meaning of the term “changes with the specific\r\nstatute in which it is found.” 622 F. 3d, at 1029.\r\n   The term is sometimes understood to include nonpecu­\r\nniary harm. Take, for instance, some courts’ interpreta­\r\ntions of the Fair Housing Act (FHA), 42 U. S. C. §3613(c),\r\nand the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U. S. C.\r\n§§1681n, 1681o. A number of courts have construed “ac­\r\ntual” damages in the remedial provisions of both statutes\r\nto include compensation for mental and emotional dis­\r\ntress. See, e.g., Seaton v. Sky Realty Co., 491 F. 2d 634,\r\n636–638 (CA7 1974) (authorizing compensatory damages\r\nunder the FHA, 42 U. S. C. §3612, the predecessor to\r\n§3613, for humiliation); Steele v. Title Realty Co., 478 F. 2d\r\n380, 384 (CA10 1973) (stating that damages under the\r\nFHA “are not limited to out-of-pocket losses but may\r\ninclude an award for emotional distress and humiliation”);\r\nThompson v. San Antonio Retail Merchants Assn., 682\r\nF. 2d 509, 513–514 (CA5 1982) (per curiam) (explaining\r\nthat, “[e]ven when there are no out-of-pocket expenses,\r\nhumiliation and mental distress do constitute recoverable\r\nelements of damage” under the FCRA); Millstone v.\r\nO’Hanlon Reports, Inc., 528 F. 2d 829, 834–835 (CA8 1976)\r\n(approving an award of damages under the FCRA for “loss\r\nof sleep, nervousness, frustration and mental anguish”).\r\n   In other contexts, however, the term has been used or\r\nconstrued more narrowly to authorize damages for only\r\npecuniary harm. In the wrongful-death provision of the\r\nFederal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), for example, Congress\r\nauthorized “actual or compensatory damages, measured\r\nby the pecuniary injuries resulting from such death.” 28\r\nU. S. C. §2674, ¶2. At least one court has defined “actual\r\n8                           FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\ndamages” in the Copyright Act of 1909, 17 U. S. C. §101(b)\r\n(1970 ed.), as “the extent to which the market value of\r\na copyrighted work has been injured or destroyed by an\r\ninfringement.” Frank Music Corp. v. Metro-Goldwyn-\r\nMayer, Inc., 772 F. 2d 505, 512 (CA9 1985); see also\r\nMackie v. Rieser, 296 F. 3d 909, 917 (CA9 2002) (holding\r\nthat “ ‘hurt feelings’ over the nature of the infringement”\r\nhave no place in the actual damages calculus). And some\r\ncourts have construed “actual damages” in the Securities\r\nExchange Act of 1934, 15 U. S. C. §78bb(a), to mean “some\r\nform of economic loss.” Ryan v. Foster & Marshall, Inc.,\r\n556 F. 2d 460, 464 (CA9 1977); see also Osofsky v. Zipf,\r\n645 F. 2d 107, 111 (CA2 1981) (stating that the purpose of\r\n§78bb(a) “is to compensate civil plaintiffs for economic loss\r\nsuffered as a result of wrongs committed in violation of the\r\n1934 Act”); Herpich v. Wallace, 430 F. 2d 792, 810 (CA5\r\n1970) (noting that the “gist” of an action for damages\r\nunder the Act is “economic injury”).3\r\n   Because the term “actual damages” has this chameleon­\r\nlike quality, we cannot rely on any all-purpose definition\r\nbut must consider the particular context in which the term\r\n——————\r\n   3 This narrow usage is reflected in contemporaneous state-court deci­\r\n\r\nsions as well. See, e.g., Reist v. Manwiller, 231 Pa. Super. 444, 449,\r\nn. 4, 332 A. 2d 518, 520, n. 4 (1974) (explaining that recovery for\r\nintentional infliction of emotional distress is allowed “despite the total\r\nabsence of physical injury and actual damages”); Nalder v. Crest Corp.,\r\n93 Idaho 744, 749, 472 P. 2d 310, 315 (1970) (noting that damages for\r\n“mental anguish” due to the wrongful execution of a judgment “are\r\nallowable only as an element of punitive but not of actual damages”). It\r\nis also reflected in post-Privacy Act statutes and judicial decisions. See,\r\ne.g., 17 U. S. C. §1009(d)(1)(A)(ii) (defining “actual damages” in the\r\nAudio Home Recording Act of 1992 as “the royalty payments that\r\nshould have been paid”); 18 U. S. C. §2318(e)(3) (2006 ed., Supp. IV)\r\n(calculating “actual damages” for purposes of a counterfeit labeling\r\nstatute in terms of financial loss); Guzman v. Western State Bank of\r\nDevils Lake, 540 F. 2d 948, 953 (CA8 1976) (stating that compensatory\r\ndamages in a civil rights suit “can be awarded for emotional and mental\r\ndistress even though no actual damages are proven”).\r\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

S. C.\r\n§552a(e)(10); see also §2(b), 88 Stat. 1896 (stating that the\r\n“purpose of this Act is to provide certain safeguards for\r\nan individual against an invasion of personal privacy”).\r\nBecause the Act serves interests similar to those protected\r\nby defamation and privacy torts, there is good reason to\r\ninfer that Congress relied upon those torts in drafting the\r\nAct.\r\n   In Doe v. Chao, 540 U. S. 614 (2004), we held that the\r\nPrivacy Act’s remedial provision authorizes plaintiffs to\r\nrecover a guaranteed minimum award of $1,000 for viola­\r\n——————\r\n  4 The  dissent criticizes us for noting that the dictionary definition\r\ncontains an element of circularity. The dissent says that the defini­\r\ntion—“ ‘[a]ctual damages’ compensate for actual injury”—is “plain\r\nenough.” Post, at 3 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). But defining “actual”\r\ndamages by reference to “actual” injury is hardly helpful when our task\r\nis to determine what Congress meant by “actual.” The dissent’s refer­\r\nence to the current version of Black’s Law Dictionary, which provides\r\nthat “actual damages” can mean “tangible damages,” only highlights\r\nthe term’s ambiguity. See Black’s Law Dictionary 445 (9th ed. 2009).\r\nIf “actual damages” can mean “tangible damages,” then it can be\r\nconstrued not to include intangible harm, like mental and emotional\r\ndistress. Similarly unhelpful is the dissent’s citation to a general­\r\npurpose dictionary that defines “actual” as “existing in fact or reality”\r\nand “damages” as “compensation or satisfaction imposed by law for a\r\nwrong or injury.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 22,\r\n571 (2002) (emphasis added). Combining these two lay definitions says\r\nnothing about whether compensation for mental and emotional distress\r\nis in fact imposed by law. The definitions merely beg the question we\r\nare trying to answer. It comes as little surprise, therefore, that “actual\r\ndamages” has taken on different meanings in different statutes, as our\r\nexamples amply illustrate.\r\n10                         FAA v.

Dobbs, Law of\r\nRemedies §7.2, pp. 511–513 (1973) (hereinafter Dobbs).5\r\n“Special damages” are limited to actual pecuniary loss,\r\nwhich must be specially pleaded and proved. 1 D. Hag­\r\ngard, Cooley on Torts §164, p. 580 (4th ed. 1932) (hereinaf­\r\nter Cooley).6 “General damages,” on the other hand, cover\r\n“loss of reputation, shame, mortification, injury to the\r\nfeelings and the like and need not be alleged in detail and\r\nrequire no proof.” Id., §164, at 579.7\r\n——————\r\n  5 Libel  per quod and slander (as opposed to libel and slander per se)\r\napply to a communication that is not defamatory on its face but that is\r\ndefamatory when coupled with some other extrinsic fact.

Special damages do not\r\ninclude mental or emotional distress. See 3 Restatement §575, Com­\r\nment c (“The emotional distress caused to the person slandered by his\r\nknowledge that he has been defamed is not special harm and this is so\r\nalthough the distress results in a serious illness”); Dobbs §7.2, at 520\r\n(“Even under the more modern approach, special damages in defama­\r\ntion cases must be economic in nature, and it is not enough that the\r\nplaintiff has suffered harm to reputation, mental anguish or other\r\ndignitary harm, unless he has also suffered the loss of something\r\nhaving economic value”).\r\n   7 See also id., §3.2, at 139 (explaining that noneconomic harms “are\r\n\r\ncalled general damages”); W. Prosser, Law of Torts §112, p. 761 (4th ed.\r\n1971) (noting that “ ‘general’ damages may be recovered for the injury\r\nto the plaintiff’s reputation, his wounded feelings and humiliation, and\r\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

The basic idea is that\r\nPrivacy Act victims, like victims of libel per quod or slan­\r\nder, are barred from any recovery unless they can first\r\nshow actual—that is, pecuniary or material—harm. Upon\r\nshowing some pecuniary harm, no matter how slight, they\r\ncan recover the statutory minimum of $1,000, presumably\r\nfor any unproven harm. That Congress would choose to\r\nuse the term “actual damages” instead of “special damages”\r\nwas not without precedent. The terms had occasionally\r\nbeen used interchangeably. See, e.g., Wetzel v. Gulf Oil\r\nCorp., 455 F. 2d 857, 862 (CA9 1972) (holding that plain­\r\ntiff could not establish libel per quod because he “did not\r\nintroduce any valid and sufficient evidence of actual dam­\r\nage”); Electric Furnace Corp. v. Deering Milliken Research\r\nCorp., 325 F. 2d 761, 765 (CA6 1963) (stating that “libel\r\nper quod standing alone without proof of actual damages\r\n. . . will not support a verdict for the plaintiff ”); M & S\r\nFurniture Sales Co. v.

S. C.\r\n§552a, p. 712. As we explained in Doe, “Congress left the\r\nquestion of general damages . . . for another day.” 540\r\nU. S., at 622. Although the Commission later recom-\r\nmended that general damages be allowed, ibid., n. 4,\r\nCongress never amended the Act to include them. For\r\nthat reason, we held that it was “beyond serious doubt”\r\nthat general damages are not available for violations of\r\nthe Privacy Act. Id., at 622.\r\n  By authorizing recovery for “actual” but not for “gen­\r\neral” damages, Congress made clear that it viewed those\r\nterms as mutually exclusive. In actions for defamation\r\nand related dignitary torts, two categories of compensa-\r\ntory damages are recoverable: general damages and special\r\ndamages. Cooley §164, at 579; see also 4 Restatement\r\n§867, Comment d (1939) (noting that damages for inter­\r\nference with privacy “can be awarded in the same way in\r\nwhich general damages are given for defamation”).9 Be­\r\n——————\r\n  8 The   dissent disregards these precedents as the product of careless\r\nimprecision. Post, at 8, n. 6. But just as we assume that Congress did\r\nnot act carelessly, we should not be so quick to assume that the courts\r\ndid. The better explanation for these precedents is not that the courts\r\nwere careless, but that the term “actual damages” has a varied mean­\r\ning that, depending on the context, can be limited to compensation for\r\nonly pecuniary harm.\r\n    9 See also Moriarty v.

The Commission understood “actual damages” in\r\nthe Act to be “a synonym for special damages as that term\r\nis used in defamation cases.” Personal Privacy in an\r\nInformation Society: The Report of the Privacy Protection\r\nStudy Commission 530 (July 1977); see also ibid. (“The\r\nlegislative history and language of the Act suggest that\r\nCongress meant to restrict recovery to specific pecuniary\r\nlosses until the Commission could weigh the propriety of\r\nextending the standard of recovery”). Although we are not\r\nbound in any way by the Commission’s report, we think it\r\nconfirms the reasonableness of interpreting “actual dam­\r\nages” in the unique context of the Privacy Act as the\r\nequivalent of special damages.\r\n\r\n——————\r\n792, 794 (1920) (per curiam) (“Generally speaking, there are recognized\r\ntwo classes of damages in libel cases, general damages and special\r\ndamages”); Winans v.

But because the Privacy Act\r\nwaives the Federal Government’s sovereign immunity, the\r\nquestion we must answer is whether it is plausible to read\r\nthe statute, as the Government does, to authorize only\r\ndamages for economic loss. Nordic Village, 503 U. S., at\r\n34, 37. When waiving the Government’s sovereign im­\r\nmunity, Congress must speak unequivocally. Lane, 518\r\nU. S., at 192. Here, we conclude that it did not. As a\r\nconsequence, we adopt an interpretation of “actual dam­\r\nages” limited to proven pecuniary or economic harm. To\r\ndo otherwise would expand the scope of Congress’ sover­\r\neign immunity waiver beyond what the statutory text\r\nclearly requires.\r\n                          III\r\n  None of respondent’s contrary arguments suffices to\r\novercome the sovereign immunity canon.\r\n                             A\r\n   Respondent notes that the term “actual damages” has\r\noften been defined broadly in common-law cases, and in\r\nour own, to include all compensatory damages. See Brief\r\nfor Respondent 18–25. For example, in Birdsall v. Coo­\r\nlidge, 93 U. S. 64 (1876), a patent infringement case, we\r\nobserved that “[c]ompensatory damages and actual dam­\r\nages mean the same thing.” Ibid. And in Gertz v. Robert\r\nWelch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323 (1974), we wrote that actual\r\ninjury in the defamation context “is not limited to out-of­\r\npocket loss” and that it customarily includes “impairment\r\nof reputation and standing in the community, personal\r\nhumiliation, and mental anguish and suffering.” Id., at\r\n350.\r\n   These cases and others cited by respondent stand for the\r\n                      Cite as: 566 U.

But this generic meaning does\r\nnot establish with the requisite clarity that the Privacy\r\nAct, with its distinctive features, authorizes damages for\r\nmental and emotional distress. As we already explained,\r\nthe term “actual damages” takes on different meanings in\r\ndifferent contexts.\r\n                               B\r\n   Respondent’s stronger argument is that the exclusion of\r\n“general damages” from the statute simply means that\r\nthere can be no recovery for presumed damages. Privacy\r\nAct victims can still recover for mental and emotional\r\ndistress, says respondent, so long as it is proved. See Brief\r\nfor Respondent 54–56.10\r\n   This argument is flawed because it suggests that proven\r\nmental and emotional distress does not count as general\r\ndamages. The term “general damages” is not limited to\r\ncompensation for unproven injuries; it includes compensa­\r\ntion for proven injuries as well. See 3 Restatement §621,\r\nComment a (noting that general damages compensate for\r\n“harm which . . . is proved, or, in the absence of proof,\r\nis assumed to have caused to [the plaintiff’s] reputation”).\r\nTo be sure, specific proof of emotional harm is not required\r\nto recover general damages for dignitary torts. Dobbs\r\n§7.3, at 529. But it does not follow that general damages\r\ncannot be recovered for emotional harm that is actually\r\nproved.\r\n   Aside from the fact that general damages need not be\r\nproved, what distinguishes those damages, whether\r\nproved or not, from the only other category of compensa-\r\ntory damages available in the relevant common-law suits is\r\nthe type of harm. In defamation and privacy cases, “the\r\naffront to the plaintiff’s dignity and the emotional harm\r\n——————\r\n 10 The   dissent advances the same argument. See post, at 9–11.\r\n16                    FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                     Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\ndone” are “called general damages, to distinguish them\r\nfrom proof of actual economic harm,” which is called “spe­\r\ncial damages.” Id., §3.2, at 139; see also supra, at 10, 12–\r\n13, and nn. 6, 7, 9. Therefore, the converse of general\r\ndamages is special damages, not all proven damages, as\r\nrespondent would have it. Because Congress removed\r\n“general damages” from the Act’s remedial provision, it is\r\nreasonable to infer that Congress foreclosed recovery for\r\nnonpecuniary harm, even if such harm can be proved, and\r\ninstead waived the Government’s sovereign immunity only\r\nwith respect to harm compensable as special damages.\r\n                              C\r\n  Looking beyond the Privacy Act’s text, respondent\r\npoints to the use of the term “actual” damages in the\r\nremedial provisions of the FHA, 42 U. S. C. §3613(c), and\r\nthe FCRA, 15 U. S. C. §§1681n, 1681o. As previously\r\nmentioned, courts have held that “actual” damages within\r\nthe meaning of these statutes include compensation for\r\nmental and emotional distress. Supra, at 7. Citing the\r\nrule of construction that Congress intends the same lan­\r\nguage in similar statutes to have the same meaning, see\r\nNorthcross v. Board of Ed. of Memphis City Schools, 412\r\nU. S. 427, 428 (1973) (per curiam), respondent argues that\r\nthe Privacy Act should also be interpreted as authorizing\r\ndamages for mental and emotional distress. See Brief for\r\nRespondent 25–32.\r\n  Assuming for the sake of argument that these lower\r\ncourt decisions are correct, they provide only weak support\r\nfor respondent’s argument here. Since the term “actual\r\ndamages” can mean different things in different contexts,\r\nstatutes other than the Privacy Act provide only limited\r\ninterpretive aid, and that is especially true here. Neither\r\nthe FHA nor the FCRA contains text that precisely mir­\r\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                   17\r\n\r\n                          Opinion of the Court\r\n\r\n\r\nrors the Privacy Act.11 In neither of those statutes did\r\nCongress specifically decline to authorize recovery for\r\ngeneral damages as it did in the Privacy Act. Supra, at\r\n12–13. And most importantly, none of the lower court\r\ncases interpreting the statutes, which respondent has\r\ncited, see Brief for Respondent 29–31, involves the sover­\r\neign immunity canon.\r\n   Respondent also points to the FTCA, but the FTCA’s\r\ngeneral liability provision does not even use the term\r\n“actual damages.” It instead provides that the “United\r\nStates shall be liable” for certain tort claims “in the same\r\nmanner and to the same extent as a private individual”\r\nunder relevant state law. 28 U. S. C. §2674, ¶1. For that\r\nreason alone, the FTCA’s general liability provision is not\r\na reliable source for interpreting the term “actual damages”\r\nin the Privacy Act. Nor does the FTCA’s wrongful­\r\ndeath provision—which authorizes “actual or compensa-\r\ntory damages, measured by the pecuniary injuries resulting\r\nfrom such death,” §2674, ¶2—prove that Congress under­\r\nstood the term “actual damages” in the Privacy Act to\r\ninclude nonpecuniary mental and emotional harm. To the\r\ncontrary, it proves that actual damages can be understood\r\nto entail only pecuniary harm depending on the context.\r\nBecause the FTCA, like the FHA and FCRA, does not\r\nshare the same text or design as the Privacy Act, it is not\r\na fitting analog for construing the Act.\r\n——————\r\n  11 Compare   42 U. S. C. §3613(c)(1) (stating that “the court may award\r\nto the plaintiff actual and punitive damages”); 15 U. S. C. §1681n(a)(1)\r\n(authorizing “(A) any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a\r\nresult of the failure or damages of not less than $100 and not more than\r\n$1,000; or (B) . . . actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result\r\nof the failure or $1,000, whichever is greater”); §1681o(a)(1) (authoriz­\r\ning “any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the\r\nfailure”) with 5 U. S. C. §552a(g)(4)(A) (authorizing “actual damages\r\nsustained by the individual as a result of the refusal or failure, but in\r\nno case shall a person entitled to recovery receive less than the sum of\r\n$1,000”).\r\n18                          FAA v.

See Brief for Respondent 33–35.\r\n  Contrary to respondent’s suggestion, however, there is\r\nnothing absurd about a scheme that limits the Govern­\r\nment’s Privacy Act liability to harm that can be substanti­\r\nated by proof of tangible economic loss. Respondent in­\r\nsists that such a scheme would frustrate the Privacy Act’s\r\nremedial purpose, but that ignores the fact that, by delib­\r\nerately refusing to authorize general damages, Congress\r\nintended to cabin relief, not to maximize it.12\r\n——————\r\n   12 Despite its rhetoric, the dissent does not dispute most of the steps\r\n\r\nin our analysis. For example, although the dissent belittles the sover­\r\neign immunity canon, the dissent does not call for its abandonment.\r\nSee post, at 2–3. Nor does the dissent point out any error in our under­\r\nstanding of the canon’s meaning. See ibid. The dissent acknowledges\r\nthat statutes and judicial opinions sometimes use the term “actual\r\ndamages” to mean pecuniary harm, see post, at 5, and that determining\r\nits meaning in a particular statute requires consideration of context,\r\nsee ibid. In addition, the dissent concedes—as it must in light of our\r\nreasoning in Doe v. Chao, 540 U. S. 614 (2004)—that the common law\r\nof defamation has relevance in construing the term “actual damages” in\r\nthe Privacy Act. See post, at 7–9.\r\n   The dissent’s argument thus boils down to this: The text and purpose\r\nof the Privacy Act make it clear beyond any reasonable dispute that the\r\nterm “actual damages,” as used in the Act, means compensatory dam­\r\nages for all proven harm and not just damages for pecuniary harm.\r\nThe dissent reasons that, because the Act seeks to prevent pecuniary\r\nand nonpecuniary harm, Congress must have intended to authorize the\r\nrecovery of money damages from the Federal Government for both\r\ntypes of harm. This inference is plausible, but it surely is not unavoid­\r\nable. The Act deters violations of its substantive provisions in other\r\nways—for instance, by permitting recovery for economic injury; by\r\nimposing criminal sanctions for some violations, see 5 U. S. C. §552a(i);\r\nand possibly by allowing for injunctive relief under the Administrative\r\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

To that end, the Act provides a civil\r\nremedy entitling individuals adversely affected by certain\r\nagency misconduct to recover “actual damages” sustained\r\nas a result of the unlawful action.\r\n   Today the Court holds that “actual damages” is limited\r\nto pecuniary loss. Consequently, individuals can no longer\r\nrecover what our precedents and common sense under-\r\nstand to be the primary, and often only, damages sus-\r\ntained as a result of an invasion of privacy, namely mental\r\nor emotional distress. That result is at odds with the text,\r\nstructure, and drafting history of the Act. And it cripples\r\nthe Act’s core purpose of redressing and deterring viola-\r\ntions of privacy interests. I respectfully dissent.\r\n                              I\r\n  The majority concludes that “actual damages” in the\r\ncivil-remedies provision of the Privacy Act allows recovery\r\nfor pecuniary loss alone. But it concedes that its interpre-\r\ntation is not compelled by the plain text of the statute or\r\notherwise required by any other traditional tool of statu-\r\n2                      FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ntory interpretation. And it candidly acknowledges that a\r\ncontrary reading is not “inconceivable.” Ante, at 14. Yet be-\r\ncause it considers its reading of “actual damages” to be\r\n“plausible,” the majority contends that the canon of sover-\r\neign immunity requires adoption of an interpretation most\r\nfavorable to the Government. Ibid.\r\n   The canon simply cannot bear the weight the majority\r\nascribes it. “The sovereign immunity canon is just that—a\r\ncanon of construction. It is a tool for interpreting the law,\r\nand we have never held that it displaces the other tra-\r\nditional tools of statutory construction.” Richlin Security\r\nService Co. v. Chertoff, 553 U. S. 571, 589 (2008) (opinion\r\nof ALITO, J.). Here, traditional tools of statutory construc-\r\ntion—the statute’s text, structure, drafting history, and\r\npurpose—provide a clear answer: The term “actual dam-\r\nages” permits recovery for all injuries established by\r\ncompetent evidence in the record, whether pecuniary or\r\nnonpecuniary, and so encompasses damages for mental\r\nand emotional distress. There is no need to seek refuge in\r\na canon of construction, see id., at 589–590 (declining to\r\nrely on canon as there is “no ambiguity left for us to con-\r\nstrue” after application of “traditional tools of statutory\r\ninterpretation and considerations of stare decisis”), much\r\nless one that has been used so haphazardly in the Court’s\r\nhistory, see United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S.\r\n30, 42 (1992) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (canon is “nothing\r\nbut a judge-made rule that is sometimes favored and\r\nsometimes disfavored”) (collecting cases).\r\n   It bears emphasis that we have said repeatedly that,\r\nwhile “we should not take it upon ourselves to extend\r\nthe waiver [of sovereign immunity] beyond that which\r\nCongress intended,” “[n]either . . . should we assume the\r\nauthority to narrow the waiver that Congress intended.”\r\nUnited States v.

In the Privacy Act, Congress\r\nexpressly authorized recovery of “actual damages” for\r\ncertain intentional or willful agency misconduct. The\r\nCourt should not “as a self-constituted guardian of the\r\nTreasury import immunity back into a statute designed to\r\nlimit it.” Indian Towing Co. v. United States, 350 U.

Nicklos Drill-\r\ning Co., 505 U. S. 469, 475 (1992). The language of the\r\ncivil-remedies provision of the Privacy Act is clear.\r\n   At the time Congress drafted the Act, Black’s Law Dic-\r\ntionary defined “actual damages” as “[r]eal, substantial\r\nand just damages, or the amount awarded to a complain-\r\nant in compensation for his actual and real loss or in-\r\njury” and as “[s]ynonymous with ‘compensatory damages.’ ”\r\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 467 (rev. 4th ed. 1968) (hereinafter\r\nBlack’s). The majority claims this is a “general” and “no-\r\ntably circular” definition, ante, at 7, but it is unclear why.\r\nThe definition is plain enough: “Actual damages” compen-\r\nsate for actual injury, and thus the term is synonymous\r\nwith compensatory damages. See Black’s 467 (defining\r\n“compensatory damages” as damages that “will compen-\r\nsate the injured party for the injury sustained, and noth-\r\ning more; such as will simply make good or replace the\r\n4                           FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nloss caused by the wrong or injury”).1 There is nothing\r\ncircular about that definition.2 It is the definition this\r\nCourt adopted more than a century ago when we recog-\r\nnized that “[c]ompensatory damages and actual damages\r\nmean the same thing; that is, that the damages shall be\r\nthe result of the injury alleged and proved, and that the\r\namount awarded shall be precisely commensurate with\r\nthe injury suffered.” Birdsall v. Coolidge, 93 U. S. 64\r\n(1876). It is the definition embraced in current legal\r\ndictionaries. See Black’s 445 (9th ed. 2009) (defining\r\n“actual damages” as “[a]n amount awarded to a complain-\r\nant to compensate for a proven injury or loss; damages\r\nthat repay actual losses.—Also termed compensatory\r\ndamages; tangible damages; real damages” (italics omit-\r\nted)). And it is the definition that accords with the plain\r\nand ordinary meaning of the term. See Webster’s Third\r\nNew International Dictionary 22, 571 (2002) (defining\r\n“actual” as “existing in fact or reality” and “damages” as\r\n“compensation or satisfaction imposed by law for a wrong\r\nor injury caused by a violation of a legal right”). Thus,\r\nboth as a term of art and in its plain meaning, “actual\r\ndamages” connotes compensation for proven injuries or\r\n——————\r\n  1 Black’s Law Dictionary also defined “actual damages” as synony-\r\n\r\nmous with “general damages.” Black’s 467. While “general damages”\r\nhas a specialized meaning of presumed damages in libel and slander\r\ncases, see n. 4, infra, it more generally can mean damages that “did in\r\nfact result from the wrong, directly and proximately.” Black’s 468.\r\n  2 The majority declares the definition circular because “defining ‘ac-\r\n\r\ntual’ damages by reference to ‘actual’ injury is hardly helpful when our\r\ntask is to determine what Congress meant by ‘actual.’ ” Ante, at 9, n. 4.\r\n“Actual injury,” however, is far from an unhelpful reference. This\r\nCourt already has recognized in the defamation context that “actual\r\ninjury is not limited to out-of-pocket loss.” Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,\r\n418 U. S. 323, 350 (1974). That accords with the definitions of the\r\nterms. See Black’s 53, 924 (defining “actual” as “[r]eal; substantial;\r\nexisting presently in act, having a valid objective existence as opposed\r\nto that which is merely theoretical or possible,” and “injury” as “[a]ny\r\nwrong or damage done to another”).\r\n                      Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                     5\r\n\r\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nlosses. Nothing in the use of that phrase indicates proven\r\ninjuries need be pecuniary in nature.\r\n  The majority discards all this on the asserted ground\r\nthat “the precise meaning of the term ‘changes with the\r\nspecific statute in which it is found.’ ” Ante, at 7 (quoting\r\n622 F. 3d 1016, 1029 (CA9 2010)). Context, of course, is\r\nrelevant to statutory interpretation; it may provide clues\r\nthat Congress did not employ a word or phrase in its\r\nordinary meaning. That well-established interpretive rule\r\ncannot, however, render irrelevant—as the majority would\r\nhave it—the ordinary meaning of “actual damages.”\r\n  Moreover, the authority the majority cites for its claim\r\nthat “actual damages” has no fixed meaning undermines—\r\nrather than supports—its holding. Each cited authority\r\ninvolves either a statute in which Congress expressly\r\ndirected that compensation be measured in strictly eco-\r\nnomic terms, or else a statute (e.g., the Copyright Act of\r\n1909) in which economic loss is the natural and probable\r\nconsequence of a violation of the defined legal interest.3\r\nNeither factor is present here. Notably absent from the\r\nPrivacy Act is any provision so much as hinting that “ac-\r\ntual damages” should be limited to economic loss. And\r\nwhile “ ‘ “hurt feelings” over the nature of the [copyright]\r\ninfringement’ ” may “have no place in the actual damages\r\ncalculus” under the Copyright Act of 1909, ante, at 8 (quot-\r\ning in parenthetical Mackie v. Rieser, 296 F. 3d 909, 917\r\n(CA9 2002)), the majority provides no basis for concluding\r\nthat “hurt feelings” are equally invalid in an Act con-\r\ncerned with safeguarding individual privacy. Thus, while\r\ncontext is no doubt relevant, the majority’s cited authority\r\ndoes little to help its cause in the stated context of this\r\nstatute.\r\n——————\r\n  3 See 28 U. S. C. §2674; 17 U. S. C. §1009(d)(1); 18 U. S. C. §2318(e)(3)\r\n\r\n(2006 ed., Supp. IV); 17 U. S. C. §101(b) (1970 ed.); 15 U. S. C. §78bb(a)\r\n(2006 ed., Supp. IV).\r\n6                      FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n                               B\r\n   Indeed, the relevant statutory context—the substantive\r\nprovisions whose breach may trigger suit under the civil-\r\nremedies provision—only reinforces the ordinary meaning\r\nof “actual damages.”\r\n   Congress established substantive duties in the Act that\r\nare expressly designed to prevent agency conduct result-\r\ning in intangible harms to the individual. The Act re-\r\nquires agencies to “establish appropriate administrative,\r\ntechnical, and physical safeguards” to ensure against\r\nsecurity breaches that could result in “substantial harm,\r\nembarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any indi-\r\nvidual.” 5 U. S. C. §552a(e)(10). It also requires agencies\r\nto “maintain all records” used in making a determination\r\nabout an individual in a manner that is “reasonably neces-\r\nsary to assure fairness to the individual in the determina-\r\ntion.” §552a(e)(5). Thus an agency violates the terms of\r\nthe Act if it fails, e.g., to maintain safeguards protecting\r\nagainst “embarrassment”; there is no additional require-\r\nment that the pocketbook be implicated. An agency’s\r\nintentional or willful violation of those duties triggers\r\nliability for “actual damages” under §552a(g)(4) in the\r\nevent of an adverse impact. §§552a(g)(1)(C)–(D), (g)(4).\r\n   Adopting a reading of “actual damages” that permits\r\nrecovery for pecuniary loss alone creates a disconnect\r\nbetween the Act’s substantive and remedial provisions. It\r\nallows a swath of Government violations to go unreme-\r\ndied: A federal agency could intentionally or willfully forgo\r\nestablishing safeguards to protect against embarrassment\r\nand no successful private action could be taken against it\r\nfor the harm Congress identified. Only an interpretation\r\nof “actual damages” that permits recovery for nonpecuni-\r\nary harms harmonizes the Act’s substantive and remedial\r\nprovisions. Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341\r\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

It (correctly) in-\r\nfers from them that the Act “serves interests similar to\r\nthose protected by defamation and privacy torts.” Ante,\r\nat 9. It then points to our observation in Doe v. Chao, 540\r\nU. S. 614, 625 (2004), that the Act’s civil-remedies provi-\r\nsion “parallels” the remedial scheme for the common-law\r\ntorts of defamation per quod, which permitted recovery\r\nof “general damages” (i.e., presumed damages) only if a\r\nplaintiff first establishes “special damages” (i.e., monetary\r\nloss).5 Ante, at 10. That “parallel,” the majority con-\r\ncludes, “suggests the possibility that Congress intended\r\nthe term ‘actual damages’ in the Act to mean special dam-\r\nages.” Ante, at 11.\r\n  The majority reads too much into Doe. At issue in that\r\n——————\r\n   4 It bears noting that the Privacy Act does not authorize injunctive\r\n\r\nrelief when a suit is maintained under 5 U. S. C. §§552a(g)(1)(C) and\r\n(D). Rather, injunctive relief is available under the Act only for a\r\nlimited category of suits: suits to amend a record and suits for access to\r\na record. See §§552a(g)(2), (g)(3). Thus an individual who, like peti-\r\ntioner, brings suit under subparagraph (g)(1)(C) or (D) for an inten-\r\ntional or willful violation of the Act will be without a remedy under\r\nthe majority’s reading of “actual damages.”\r\n   5 As the majority notes, “general damages” at common law refers to\r\n\r\ndamages “presumed” to accrue from the violation of the legally pro-\r\ntected right. No proof of actual injury was required. See D. Dobbs,\r\nLaw of Remedies §7.2, p. 513 (1973) (hereinafter Dobbs); Doe, 540 U. S.,\r\nat 621. “Special damages,” in contrast, “meant monetary loss.” Dobbs §7.2,\r\nat 512; Doe, 540 U. S., at 625. Common-law defamation actions falling\r\nwithin the rubric of defamation per se allowed successful plaintiffs to\r\nrecover “general damages.” See Dobbs §7.2, at 513; Doe, 540 U. S., at\r\n621. This stood in contrast to actions sounding in defamation per quod,\r\nwhich permitted recovery only if the plaintiff established “special\r\ndamages.” See Dobbs, §7.2 at 512; Doe, 540 U. S., at 625. Even in\r\ndefamation per quod cases, a plaintiff could recover nonpecuniary\r\ninjuries upon establishing some pecuniary loss. See Dobbs §7.2, at 521;\r\nDoe, 540 U. S., at 625. See also ante, at 10.\r\n8                           FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\ncase was the question whether the Act’s civil-suit provi-\r\nsion authorized recovery of a guaranteed minimum award\r\nof $1,000 absent proof of some “actual damages.” The\r\nCourt answered in the negative, and in the course of doing\r\nso replied to petitioner’s argument that there was “some-\r\nthing peculiar in offering some guaranteed damages . . .\r\nonly to those plaintiffs who can demonstrate actual dam-\r\nages.” 540 U. S., at 625. Although the Court cited the\r\nAct’s parallels to defamation per quod actions in noting\r\nthat nothing was “peculiar” about the Act’s remedial\r\nscheme, Doe did not take the further step of deciding that\r\n“actual damages” means economic loss alone. Indeed, it\r\nexpressly reserved that question. Id., at 627, n. 12.\r\n  The majority, moreover, is wrong to conclude that the\r\nAct’s parallels with defamation per quod actions suggest\r\nCongress intended “actual damages” to mean “special\r\ndamages.” Quite the opposite. The fact that Congress\r\n“would probably have known about” defamation per quod\r\nactions, id., at 625, makes it all the more significant that\r\nCongress did not write “special damages” in the civil-\r\nremedies provision. This Court is typically not in the\r\nbusiness of substituting words we think Congress in-\r\ntended to use for words Congress in fact used. Yet that is\r\nprecisely what the majority does when it rewrites “actual\r\ndamages” to mean “special damages.”6 In sum, the statu-\r\ntory context, and in particular the Act’s substantive provi-\r\nsions, confirms the ordinary meaning of “actual damages.”\r\nAlthough the Act shares parallels with common-law defa-\r\nmation torts, such analogies do not warrant a reading of\r\n\r\n——————\r\n  6 The majority cites a collection of lower court opinions that have used\r\n\r\n“actual damages” in place of “special damages” to note that Congress\r\nwould not have been alone in using the former term to refer to the\r\nlatter. Ante, at 11–12. But that a handful of lower courts on occasion\r\nhave been imprecise in their terminology provides no basis to assume\r\nthe Legislature has been equally careless in the text of a statute.\r\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

S.,\r\nat 622.\r\n   As the Court explained in Doe, “[t]he deletion of ‘general\r\ndamages’ from the bill is fairly seen . . . as a deliberate\r\nelimination of any possibility of imputing harm and\r\nawarding presumed damages.” Id., at 623; see also id., at\r\n——————\r\n   7 There is yet another flaw in the majority’s reasoning. At common\r\n\r\nlaw a plaintiff who successfully established “special damages” in an\r\naction for defamation per quod could proceed to recover damages for\r\nemotional and mental distress. See ante, at 10; n. 5, supra. If “Con-\r\ngress intended the term ‘actual damages’ in the Act to mean special\r\ndamages,” ante, at 11, then an individual who successfully establishes\r\nsome pecuniary loss from a violation of the Act—presumably as trivial\r\nas the cost of a bottle of Tylenol—should be permitted to recover for\r\nemotional and mental distress. The majority, of course, does not accept\r\nthat result, and its piecemeal embrace of the common law undermines\r\nits assertion that Congress intended “special damages” in place of\r\n“actual damages.”\r\n   8 See S. 3418, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., §303(c)(1) (1974); H. R. 16373, 93d\r\n\r\nCong., 2d Sess., §3 (1974).\r\n10                      FAA v. COOPER\r\n\r\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\n622, n. 5 (“Congress explicitly rejected the proposal to\r\nmake presumed damages available for Privacy Act viola-\r\ntions”). The elimination of presumed damages from the\r\nbill can only reasonably imply that what Congress left\r\nbehind—“actual damages”—comprised damages that are\r\nnot presumed, i.e., damages proven by competent evidence\r\nin the record. See Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S.\r\n323, 349–350 (1974) (distinguishing in defamation context\r\nbetween presumed damages and damages for actual inju-\r\nries sustained by competent evidence in the record, which\r\ninclude “impairment of reputation and standing in the\r\ncommunity, personal humiliation, and mental anguish\r\nand suffering”); Carey v. Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 262–264\r\n(1978) (distinguishing between presumed damages and\r\nproven damages for mental and emotional distress).\r\n   Rather than view the deletion of general damages (pre-\r\nsumed damages) as leaving the converse (proven dam-\r\nages), the majority supposes that the deletion leaves only a\r\nsubset of proven damages—those of an economic nature,\r\ni.e., “special damages.” Once again, however, the major-\r\nity’s insistence that “Congress intended ‘actual damages’ in\r\nthe Privacy Act to mean special damages for proven pecu-\r\nniary loss,” ante, at 13, finds no basis in the statutory text,\r\nsee supra, at 8. And its response to the conclusion that\r\nCongress retained recovery for proven damages when it\r\neliminated presumed damages is singularly unsatisfying.\r\nThe majority declares such a conclusion “flawed” because\r\n“general damages” “includes compensation for proven\r\ninjuries as well,” so that “what distinguishes [general]\r\ndamages, whether proved or not, from the only other\r\ncategory of compensatory damages available in the rele-\r\nvant common-law suits is the type of harm” the term\r\nencompasses—which the majority takes to be emotional\r\nharm alone. Ante, at 15–16. That assertion is defective on\r\ntwo scores. First, a plaintiff ’s ability to present proof of\r\ninjury in a defamation per se action (and to recover for\r\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                   11\r\n\r\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\r\n\r\nsuch proven injury) does not alter the definition of “gen-\r\neral damages,” which we already explained in Doe means\r\n“presumed damages.” 540 U. S., at 621; see also id., at\r\n623; n. 5, supra. Second, “general damages” is not limited\r\nto a “type” of harm. The majority’s contrary assertion that\r\nthe term permits recovery only for emotional “types” of\r\nharm overlooks the fact that “general damages are partly\r\nbased on the belief that the plaintiff will suffer unprovable\r\npecuniary losses.” Dobbs §7.2, at 514 (emphasis added). It\r\nthus was established at common law that in a defamation\r\nper se action, “the plaintiff is usually free to prove what-\r\never actual pecuniary loss he can,” and “the jury may be\r\npermitted to view the actual pecuniary loss proven as the\r\ntip of the iceberg, assume that there is still more un-\r\nproven, and award damage accordingly.” Ibid.\r\n   At its core, the majority opinion relies on the following\r\nsyllogism: The common law employed two terms of art in\r\ndefamation actions. Because Congress excluded recovery\r\nfor “general damages,” it must have meant to retain recov-\r\nery only for “special damages.” That syllogism, of course,\r\nignores that there is another category of damages. It is\r\nthe very category Congress used in the text of the Privacy\r\nAct: “Actual damages.” However much Congress may\r\nhave drawn “parallels,” ante, at 10, between the Act and\r\nthe common-law tort of defamation, the fact remains that\r\nCongress expressly choose not to use the words “special\r\ndamages.”9\r\n                            D\r\n  I turn finally to the statute’s purpose, for “[a]s in all\r\ncases of statutory interpretation, our task is to interpret\r\n——————\r\n  9 The majority cites the conclusions of the Privacy Protection Study\r\n\r\nCommission in support of its interpretation of “actual damages.” The\r\nmajority rightfully does not claim this piece of postenactment, extratex-\r\ntual material is due any deference; nor do I find its unelaborated\r\nconclusions persuasive.\r\n12                     FAA v.

Houston Welfare\r\nRights Organization, 441 U. S. 600, 608 (1979); see also\r\nDolan v. Postal Service, 546 U. S. 481, 486 (2006) (“Inter-\r\npretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the\r\nwhole statutory text, considering the purpose and context\r\nof the statute, and consulting any precedents or authori-\r\nties that inform the analysis”). The purposes of the Priv-\r\nacy Act could not be more explicit, and they are consistent\r\nwith interpreting “actual damages” according to its ordi-\r\nnary meaning.\r\n   “The historical context of the Act is important to an\r\nunderstanding of its remedial purposes. In 1974, Con-\r\ngress was concerned with curbing the illegal surveillance\r\nand investigation of individuals by federal agencies that\r\nhad been exposed during the Watergate scandal.” Dept.\r\nof Justice, Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties, Overview of\r\nthe Privacy Act 4 (2010). In particular, Congress recog-\r\nnized that “the increasing use of computers and sophisti-\r\ncated information technology . . . has greatly magnified\r\nthe harm to individual privacy that can occur from any\r\ncollection, maintenance, use, or dissemination of personal\r\ninformation.” §2(a), 88 Stat. 1896. Identifying the right to\r\nprivacy as “a personal and fundamental right,” Congress\r\nfound it “necessary and proper” to enact the Privacy Act\r\n“in order to protect the privacy of individuals identified in\r\ninformation systems maintained by Federal agencies.”\r\nIbid.\r\n   Congress explained that the “purpose of this Act is to\r\nprovide certain safeguards for an individual against an\r\ninvasion of personal privacy by requiring Federal agen-\r\ncies, except as otherwise provided by law, to,” inter alia,\r\n“be subject to civil suit for any damages which occur as a\r\nresult of willful or intentional action which violates any\r\nindividual’s rights under this Act.” §2(b)(6), ibid. (empha-\r\nsis added). That statement is an explicit reference to suits\r\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

It signals unmistakably congressional recognition\r\nthat the civil-remedies provision is integral to realizing\r\nthe Act’s purposes.\r\n  Reading “actual damages” to permit recovery for any\r\ninjury established by competent evidence in the record—\r\npecuniary or not—best effectuates the statute’s basic\r\npurpose. Although some privacy invasions no doubt result\r\nin economic loss, we have recognized time and again that\r\nthe primary form of injuries is nonpecuniary, and includes\r\nmental distress and personal humiliation. See Time, Inc.\r\nv. Hill, 385 U. S. 374, 385, n. 9 (1967) (“In the ‘right of\r\nprivacy’ cases the primary damage is the mental dis-\r\ntress”); see also Gertz, 418 U. S., at 350 (“[A]ctual injury”\r\nin defamatory falsehood cases “is not limited to out-of-\r\npocket loss. Indeed, the more customary types of actual\r\nharm inflicted by defamatory falsehood include impair-\r\nment of reputation and standing in the community, per-\r\nsonal humiliation, and mental anguish and suffering”).\r\nAccord, 2 Dobbs §7.1.(1), at 259 (2d ed. 1993) (privacy is a\r\ndignitary interest, and “in a great many of the cases” in\r\nwhich the interest is invaded “the only harm is the affront\r\nto the plaintiff ’s dignity as a human being, the damage to\r\nhis self-image, and the resulting mental distress”). That\r\naccords with common sense.\r\n  In interpreting the civil-remedies provision, we must not\r\nforget Congress enacted the Privacy Act to protect pri-\r\nvacy. The majority’s reading of “actual damages” renders\r\nthe remedial provision impotent in the face of concededly\r\nunlawful agency action whenever the injury is solely\r\nnonpecuniary. That result is patently at odds with Con-\r\ngress’ stated purpose. The majority, however, does not\r\ngrapple with the ramifications of its opinion. It acknowl-\r\nedges the suggestion that its holding leads to absurd\r\nresults as it allows individuals suffering relatively minor\r\n14                     FAA v.

But it con-\r\ncludes that “there is nothing absurd about a scheme that\r\nlimits the Government’s Privacy Act liability to harm that\r\ncan be substantiated by proof of tangible economic loss.”\r\nAnte, at 18. Perhaps; it is certainly within Congress’\r\nprerogative to enact the statute the majority envisions,\r\nnamely one that seeks to safeguard against invasions of\r\nprivacy without remedying the primary harm that results\r\nfrom invasions of privacy. The problem for the majority is\r\nthat one looks in vain for any indication in the text of the\r\nstatute before us that Congress intended such a result.\r\nNowhere in the Privacy Act does Congress so much as hint\r\nthat it views a $5 hit to the pocketbook as more worthy of\r\nremedy than debilitating mental distress, and the major-\r\nity’s contrary assumption discounts the gravity of emo-\r\ntional harm caused by an invasion of the personal integ-\r\nrity that privacy protects.\r\n                        *    *     *\r\n  After today, no matter how debilitating and substantial\r\nthe resulting mental anguish, an individual harmed by\r\na federal agency’s intentional or willful violation of the\r\nPrivacy Act will be left without a remedy unless he or she\r\nis able to prove pecuniary harm. That is not the result\r\nCongress intended when it enacted an Act with the ex-\r\npress purpose of safeguarding individual privacy against\r\nGovernment invasion. And it is not a result remotely\r\nsuggested by anything in the text, structure, or history of\r\nthe Act. For those reasons, I respectfully dissent.\r\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/626208/", "sha1": "736eeb18131de4daa697cfe73c841523044a1026", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2012-03-28T07:21:19"}
