Argued November 7, 2011—Decided March 26, 2012\nPetitioner Menachem Binyamin Zivotofsky was born in Jerusalem. His\n  mother requested that Zivotofsky’s place of birth be listed as “Israel”\n  on a consular report of birth abroad and on his passport, pursuant to\n  §214(d) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003.\n  That provision states: “For purposes of the registration of birth, certi-\n  fication of nationality, or issuance of a passport of a United States cit-\n  izen born in the city of Jerusalem, the Secretary shall, upon the re-\n  quest of the citizen or the citizen’s legal guardian, record the place of\n  birth as Israel.” U. S. officials refused the request, citing a State De-\n  partment policy that prohibits recording “Israel” as the place of birth\n  for those born in Jerusalem. Zivotofsky’s parents filed a suit on his\n  behalf against the Secretary of State. The District Court dismissed\n  the case, holding that it presented a nonjusticiable political question\n  regarding Jerusalem’s political status. The D. C. Circuit affirmed,\n  reasoning that the Constitution gives the Executive the exclusive\n  power to recognize foreign sovereigns, and that the exercise of that\n  power cannot be reviewed by the courts.\nHeld: The political question doctrine does not bar judicial review of Zi-\n votofsky’s claim. Pp. 5−12.\n    (a) This Court has said that a controversy “involves a political\n question . . . where there is ‘a textually demonstrable constitutional\n commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a\n lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolv-\n ing it.’ ” Nixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224, 228. The lower courts\n ruled that this case presents such a political question because they\n2                        ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    misunderstood the issue, assuming resolution of Zivotofsky’s claim\n    would require the Judiciary to define U. S. policy regarding the sta-\n    tus of Jerusalem. In fact, this case asks the courts to determine only\n    whether Zivotofsky can vindicate his statutory right under §214(d) to\n    choose to have Israel recorded as his place of birth on his passport.\n    Making such determinations is a familiar judicial exercise. Moreo-\n    ver, because the parties do not dispute the interpretation of §214(d),\n    the only real question for the courts is whether the statute is consti-\n    tutional. There is no “textually demonstrable constitutional com-\n    mitment” of that question to another branch: At least since Marbury\n    v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, this Court has recognized that it is “em-\n    phatically the province and duty” of the Judiciary to determine the\n    constitutionality of a statute. Nor is there “a lack of judicially discov-\n    erable and manageable standards for resolving” the question: Both\n    parties offer detailed legal arguments concerning whether the textu-\n    al, structural, and historical evidence supports a determination that\n    §214(d) is constitutional. Pp. 5–12.\n      (b) Because the lower courts erroneously concluded that the case\n    presents a political question, they did not reach the merits of Zivo-\n    tofsky’s claim. This Court is “a court of final review and not first\n    view,” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U. S. 103, 110, and\n    ordinarily “do[es] not decide in the first instance issues not decided\n    below,” National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Smith, 525 U. S. 459,\n    470.

The State Department\ndeclined to follow that law, citing its longstanding policy of\nnot taking a position on the political status of Jerusalem.\nWhen sued by an American who invoked the statute, the\nSecretary of State argued that the courts lacked authority\nto decide the case because it presented a political question.\nThe Court of Appeals so held.\n  We disagree. The courts are fully capable of determin-\ning whether this statute may be given effect, or instead\nmust be struck down in light of authority conferred on the\nExecutive by the Constitution.\n                          I\n                          A\n  In 2002, Congress enacted the Foreign Relations Au-\n2                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003, 116 Stat. 1350. Section\n214 of the Act is entitled “United States Policy with Re-\nspect to Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel.” Id., at 1365.\nThe first two subsections express Congress’s “commit-\nment” to relocating the United States Embassy in Israel to\nJerusalem. Id., at 1365–1366. The third bars funding for\nthe publication of official Government documents that do\nnot list Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Id., at 1366.\nThe fourth and final provision, §214(d), is the only one at\nstake in this case. Entitled “Record of Place of Birth as\nIsrael for Passport Purposes,” it provides that “[f]or pur-\nposes of the registration of birth, certification of national-\nity, or issuance of a passport of a United States citizen born\nin the city of Jerusalem, the Secretary shall, upon the re-\nquest of the citizen or the citizen’s legal guardian, record\nthe place of birth as Israel.” Ibid.\n   The State Department’s Foreign Affairs Manual states\nthat “[w]here the birthplace of the applicant is located\nin territory disputed by another country, the city or area\nof birth may be written in the passport.” 7 Foreign Affairs\nManual §1383.5–2, App. 108. The manual specifically\ndirects that passport officials should enter “JERUSALEM”\nand should “not write Israel or Jordan” when recording\nthe birthplace of a person born in Jerusalem on a pass-\nport. Id., §1383, Exh. 1383.1, App. 127; see also id.,\n§§1383.1, 1383.5–4, .5–5, .5–6, App. 106, 108–110.\n   Section 214(d) sought to override this instruction by\nallowing citizens born in Jerusalem to have “Israel” rec-\norded on their passports if they wish. In signing the For-\neign Relations Authorization Act into law, President\nGeorge W. Bush stated his belief that §214 “impermissibly\ninterferes with the President’s constitutional authority to\nconduct the Nation’s foreign affairs and to supervise the\nunitary executive branch.” Statement on Signing the\nForeign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003,\nPublic Papers of the Presidents, George W. Bush, Vol. 2,\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSept. 30, 2002, p. 1698 (2005). He added that if the sec-\ntion is “construed as mandatory,” then it would “interfere\nwith the President’s constitutional authority to formulate\nthe position of the United States, speak for the Nation in\ninternational affairs, and determine the terms on which\nrecognition is given to foreign states.” Ibid. He concluded\nby emphasizing that “U. S. policy regarding Jerusalem has\nnot changed.” Ibid. The President made no specific refer-\nence to the passport mandate in §214(d).\n                              B\n   Petitioner Menachem Binyamin Zivotofsky was born in\nJerusalem on October 17, 2002, shortly after §214(d) was\nenacted. Zivotofsky’s parents were American citizens and\nhe accordingly was as well, by virtue of congressional\nenactment. 8 U. S. C. §1401(c); see Rogers v. Bellei, 401\nU. S. 815, 835 (1971) (foreign-born children of American\ncitizens acquire citizenship at birth through “congres-\nsional generosity”). Zivotofsky’s mother filed an application\nfor a consular report of birth abroad and a United States\npassport. She requested that his place of birth be listed as\n“Jerusalem, Israel” on both documents. U. S. officials\ninformed Zivotofsky’s mother that State Department\npolicy prohibits recording “Israel” as Zivotofsky’s place of\nbirth. Pursuant to that policy, Zivotofsky was issued a\npassport and consular report of birth abroad listing only\n“Jerusalem.” App. 19–20.\n   Zivotofsky’s parents filed a complaint on his behalf\nagainst the Secretary of State. Zivotofsky sought a de-\nclaratory judgment and a permanent injunction ordering\nthe Secretary to identify his place of birth as “Jerusalem,\nIsrael” in the official documents. Id., at 17–18. The Dis-\ntrict Court granted the Secretary’s motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint on the grounds that Zivotofsky lacked standing\nand that his complaint presented a nonjusticiable political\nquestion.\n4                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit reversed,\nconcluding that Zivotofsky did have standing. It then\nobserved that while Zivotofsky had originally asked that\n“Jerusalem, Israel” be recorded on his passport, “[b]oth\nsides agree that the question now is whether §214(d)\nentitles [him] to have just ‘Israel’ listed as his place of\nbirth.” 444 F. 3d 614, 619 (2006). The D. C. Circuit de-\ntermined that additional factual development might be\nhelpful in deciding whether this question was justiciable,\nas the parties disagreed about the foreign policy implica-\ntions of listing “Israel” alone as a birthplace on the pass-\nport. Id., at 619–620. It therefore remanded the case to\nthe District Court.\n   The District Court again found that the case was not\njusticiable. It explained that “[r]esolving [Zivotofsky’s]\nclaim on the merits would necessarily require the Court to\ndecide the political status of Jerusalem.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2441474\"><a href=\"/opinion/2441474/zivotofsky-v-secretary-of-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 103 (2007). Concluding that the claim therefore pre-\nsented a political question, the District Court dismissed\nthe case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   The D. C. Circuit affirmed. It reasoned that the Consti-\ntution gives the Executive the exclusive power to recognize\nforeign sovereigns, and that the exercise of this power\ncannot be reviewed by the courts. Therefore, “deciding\nwhether the Secretary of State must mark a passport . . .\nas Zivotofsky requests would necessarily draw [the court]\ninto an area of decisionmaking the Constitution leaves to\nthe Executive alone.” 571 F. 3d 1227, 1232–1233 (2009).\nThe D. C. Circuit held that the political question doctrine\nprohibits such an intrusion by the courts, and rejected any\nsuggestion that Congress’s decision to take “a position on\nthe status of Jerusalem” could change the analysis. Id., at\n1233.\n   Judge Edwards concurred in the judgment, but wrote\nseparately to express his view that the political question\ndoctrine has no application to this case. He explained that\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe issue before the court was whether §214(d) “impermis-\nsibly intrude[s] on the President’s exclusive power to\nrecognize foreign sovereigns.” Id., at 1234. That question,\nhe observed, involves “commonplace issues of statutory\nand constitutional interpretation” plainly within the con-\nstitutional authority of the Judiciary to decide. Id., at\n1235. Reaching the merits, Judge Edwards determined\nthat designating Israel as a place of birth on a passport is\na policy “in furtherance of the recognition power.” Id., at\n1243. Because in his view the Constitution gives that\npower exclusively to the President, Judge Edwards found\n§214(d) unconstitutional. For this reason, he concluded\nthat Zivotofsky had no viable cause of action, and con-\ncurred in affirming the dismissal of the complaint.\n  Zivotofsky petitioned for certiorari, and we granted\nreview. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                              II\n  The lower courts concluded that Zivotofsky’s claim\npresents a political question and therefore cannot be ad-\njudicated. We disagree.\n  In general, the Judiciary has a responsibility to decide\ncases properly before it, even those it “would gladly avoid.”\nCohens v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85330\"><a href=\"/opinion/85330/cohens-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 404 (1821). Our prece-\ndents have identified a narrow exception to that rule,\nknown as the “political question” doctrine. See, e.g., Ja-\npan Whaling Assn. v. American Cetacean Soc., 478 U. S.\n221, 230 (1986). We have explained that a controversy\n“involves a political question . . . where there is ‘a textu-\nally demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue\nto a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially\ndiscoverable and manageable standards for resolving it.’ ”\nNixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224, 228 (1993) (quoting\nBaker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 217 (1962)). In such a case,\nwe have held that a court lacks the authority to decide the\ndispute before it.\n6                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    The lower courts ruled that this case involves a political\nquestion because deciding Zivotofsky’s claim would force\nthe Judicial Branch to interfere with the President’s exer-\ncise of constitutional power committed to him alone. The\nDistrict Court understood Zivotofsky to ask the courts to\n“decide the political status of Jerusalem.” 511 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 103. This misunderstands the issue presented. Zivo-\ntofsky does not ask the courts to determine whether Jeru-\nsalem is the capital of Israel. He instead seeks to deter-\nmine whether he may vindicate his statutory right, under\n§214(d), to choose to have Israel recorded on his passport\nas his place of birth.\n    For its part, the D. C. Circuit treated the two questions\nas one and the same. That court concluded that “[o]nly\nthe Executive—not Congress and not the courts—has the\npower to define U. S. policy regarding Israel’s sovereignty\nover Jerusalem,” and also to “decide how best to imple-\nment that policy.” 571 F. 3d, at 1232. Because the De-\npartment’s passport rule was adopted to implement the\nPresident’s “exclusive and unreviewable constitutional\npower to keep the United States out of the debate over the\nstatus of Jerusalem,” the validity of that rule was itself a\n“nonjusticiable political question” that “the Constitution\nleaves to the Executive alone.” Id., at 1231–1233. Indeed,\nthe D. C. Circuit’s opinion does not even mention §214(d)\nuntil the fifth of its six paragraphs of analysis, and then\nonly to dismiss it as irrelevant: “That Congress took a\nposition on the status of Jerusalem and gave Zivotofsky a\nstatutory cause of action . . . is of no moment to whether\nthe judiciary has [the] authority to resolve this dispute\n. . . .” Id., at 1233.\n    The existence of a statutory right, however, is certainly\nrelevant to the Judiciary’s power to decide Zivotofsky’s\nclaim. The federal courts are not being asked to supplant\na foreign policy decision of the political branches with the\ncourts’ own unmoored determination of what United\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)              7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nStates policy toward Jerusalem should be. Instead, Zivo-\ntofsky requests that the courts enforce a specific statutory\nright. To resolve his claim, the Judiciary must decide if\nZivotofsky’s interpretation of the statute is correct, and\nwhether the statute is constitutional. This is a familiar\njudicial exercise.\n   Moreover, because the parties do not dispute the inter-\npretation of §214(d), the only real question for the courts is\nwhether the statute is constitutional. At least since Mar-\nbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), we have recognized\nthat when an Act of Congress is alleged to conflict with the\nConstitution, “[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of\nthe judicial department to say what the law is.” Id., at\n177. That duty will sometimes involve the “[r]esolution of\nlitigation challenging the constitutional authority of one of\nthe three branches,” but courts cannot avoid their respon-\nsibility merely “because the issues have political implica-\ntions.” INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 943 (1983).\n   In this case, determining the constitutionality of §214(d)\ninvolves deciding whether the statute impermissibly\nintrudes upon Presidential powers under the Constitution.\nIf so, the law must be invalidated and Zivotofsky’s case\nshould be dismissed for failure to state a claim. If, on the\nother hand, the statute does not trench on the President’s\npowers, then the Secretary must be ordered to issue Zivo-\ntofsky a passport that complies with §214(d). Either way,\nthe political question doctrine is not implicated. “No\npolicy underlying the political question doctrine suggests\nthat Congress or the Executive . . . can decide the constitu-\ntionality of a statute; that is a decision for the courts.” Id.,\nat 941–942.\n   The Secretary contends that “there is ‘a textually de-\nmonstrable constitutional commitment’ ” to the President\nof the sole power to recognize foreign sovereigns and, as\na corollary, to determine whether an American born in\nJerusalem may choose to have Israel listed as his place of\n8                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbirth on his passport. Nixon, 506 U. S., at 228 (quoting\nBaker, 369 U. S., at 217); see Brief for Respondent 49–50.\nPerhaps. But there is, of course, no exclusive commitment\nto the Executive of the power to determine the constitu-\ntionality of a statute. The Judicial Branch appropriately\nexercises that authority, including in a case such as this,\nwhere the question is whether Congress or the Executive\nis “aggrandizing its power at the expense of another\nbranch.” Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 878\n(1991); see, e.g., Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52, 176\n(1926) (finding a statute unconstitutional because it en-\ncroached upon the President’s removal power); Bowsher v.\nSynar, 478 U. S. 714, 734 (1986) (finding a statute un-\nconstitutional because it “intruded into the executive\nfunction”); Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654, 685 (1988)\n(upholding a statute’s constitutionality against a charge\nthat it “impermissibly interfere[d] with the President’s\nexercise of his constitutionally appointed functions”).\n   Our precedents have also found the political question\ndoctrine implicated when there is “ ‘a lack of judicially\ndiscoverable and manageable standards for resolving’ ” the\nquestion before the court. Nixon, supra, at 228 (quoting\nBaker, supra, at 217). Framing the issue as the lower\ncourts did, in terms of whether the Judiciary may decide\nthe political status of Jerusalem, certainly raises those\nconcerns. They dissipate, however, when the issue is\nrecognized to be the more focused one of the constitution-\nality of §214(d). Indeed, both sides offer detailed legal\narguments regarding whether §214(d) is constitutional in\nlight of powers committed to the Executive, and whether\nCongress’s own powers with respect to passports must be\nweighed in analyzing this question.\n   For example, the Secretary reprises on the merits her\nargument on the political question issue, claiming that the\nConstitution gives the Executive the exclusive power to\nformulate recognition policy.

II, §3. According to the Secretary, “[c]enturies-long\nExecutive Branch practice, congressional acquiescence,\nand decisions by this Court” confirm that the “receive\nAmbassadors” clause confers upon the Executive the\nexclusive power of recognition. Brief for Respondent 18.\n    The Secretary observes that “President Washington and\nhis cabinet unanimously decided that the President could\nreceive the ambassador from the new government of\nFrance without first consulting Congress.” Id., at 19\n(citing Letter from George Washington to the Cabinet\n(Apr. 18, 1793), reprinted in 25 Papers of Thomas Jeffer-\nson 568–569 (J.

She notes, too, that early attempts by the Leg-\nislature to affect recognition policy were regularly “re-\njected in Congress as inappropriate incursions into the\nExecutive Branch’s constitutional authority.” Brief for\nRespondent 21.

S. 398, 410 (1964); see Brief for Respondent\n24–27 (citing, e.g., United States v. Pink, 315 U. S. 203\n(1942)).\n    The Secretary further contends that §214(d) constitutes\nan impermissible exercise of the recognition power be-\ncause “the decision as to how to describe the place of birth\n. . . operates as an official statement of whether the United\nStates recognizes a state’s sovereignty over a territorial\narea.” Brief for Respondent 38. The Secretary will not\n“list[] as a place of birth a country whose sovereignty over\nthe relevant territory the United States does not recog-\nnize.” Id., at 39. Therefore, she claims, “listing ‘Israel’ as\nthe place of birth would constitute an official decision by\n10                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe United States to begin to treat Jerusalem as a city\nlocated within Israel. ” Id., at 38–39 (some internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n   For his part, Zivotofsky argues that, far from being an\nexercise of the recognition power, §214(d) is instead a\n“legitimate and permissible” exercise of Congress’s “au-\nthority to legislate on the form and content of a passport.”\nBrief for Petitioner 53. He points the Court to Professor\nLouis Henkin’s observation that “ ‘in the competition for\npower in foreign relations,’ Congress has ‘an impressive\narray of powers expressly enumerated in the Constitu-\ntion.’ ” Id., at 45 (quoting L. Henkin, Foreign Affairs and\nthe United States Constitution 63 (2d ed. 1996)). Zivo-\ntofsky suggests that Congress’s authority to enact §214(d)\nderives specifically from its powers over naturalization,\nU. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 4, and foreign commerce, id., §8,\ncl. 3. According to Zivotofsky, Congress has used these\npowers to pass laws regulating the content and issuance of\npassports since 1856. See Brief for Petitioner 52 (citing\nAct of Aug. 18, 1856, §23, 11 Stat. 60).\n   Zivotofsky contends that §214(d) fits squarely within\nthis tradition. He notes that the State Department’s\ndesignated representative stated in her deposition for this\nlitigation that the “place of birth” entry is included only\nas “an element of identification.” App. 76 (Deposition of\nCatherine Barry, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for\nOverseas Citizens Services); see Brief for Petitioner 10.\nMoreover, Zivotofsky argues, the “place of birth” entry\ncannot be taken as a means for recognizing foreign sover-\neigns, because the State Department authorizes recording\nunrecognized territories—such as the Gaza Strip and the\nWest Bank—as places of birth. Brief for Petitioner 43\n(citing 7 Foreign Affairs Manual §1383.5–5, App. 109–\n110).\n   Further, Zivotofsky claims that even if §214(d) does\nimplicate the recognition power, that is not a power the\n                   Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)             11\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nConstitution commits exclusively to the Executive. Zivo-\ntofsky argues that the Secretary is overreading the authority\ngranted to the President in the “receive Ambassadors”\nclause. He observes that in the Federalist Papers, Alexander\nHamilton described the power conferred by this clause as\n“more a matter of dignity than of authority,” and called it “a\ncircumstance, which will be without consequence in the\nadministration of the government.” The Federalist No. 69,\np. 468 (J. Cooke ed. 1961); see Brief for Petitioner 37. Zivo-\ntofsky also points to other clauses in the Constitution, such\nas Congress’s power to declare war, that suggest some con-\ngressional role in recognition. Reply Brief for Petitioner 23\n(citing U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 11). He cites, for example,\nan 1836 message from President Jackson to Congress, ac-\nknowledging that it is unclear who holds the authority to\nrecognize because it is a power “no where expressly dele-\ngated” in the Constitution, and one that is “necessarily\ninvolved in some of the great powers given to Congress.”\nMessage from the President of the United States Upon the\nSubject of the Political, Military, and Civil Condition of\nTexas, H. R. Doc. No. 35, 24th Cong., 2d Sess., 2; see Reply\nBrief for Petitioner 11–12.\n   Zivotofsky argues that language from this Court’s prece-\ndents suggesting the recognition power belongs exclusively\nto the President is inapplicable to his claim, because that\nlanguage appeared in cases where the Court was asked to\nalter recognition policy developed by the Executive in the\nabsence of congressional opposition. See Brief for Petitioner\n44–46; Reply Brief for Petitioner 18–19. Finally, Zivotofsky\ncontends that even if the “receive Ambassadors” clause\nconfers some exclusive recognition power on the President,\nsimply allowing a choice as to the “place of birth” entry on a\npassport does not significantly intrude on that power.\n   Recitation of these arguments—which sound in familiar\nprinciples of constitutional interpretation—is enough to\nestablish that this case does not “turn on standards that defy\n12                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\njudicial application.” Baker, 369 U. S., at 211. Resolution of\nZivotofksy’s claim demands careful examination of the tex-\ntual, structural, and historical evidence put forward by the\nparties regarding the nature of the statute and of the pass-\nport and recognition powers. This is what courts do. The\npolitical question doctrine poses no bar to judicial review of\nthis case.\n                              III\n  To say that Zivotofsky’s claim presents issues the Judi-\nciary is competent to resolve is not to say that reaching a\ndecision in this case is simple. Because the District Court\nand the D. C. Circuit believed that review was barred by\nthe political question doctrine, we are without the benefit\nof thorough lower court opinions to guide our analysis of\nthe merits. Ours is “a court of final review and not first\nview.” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U. S.\n103, 110 (2001) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Ordinarily, “we do not decide in the first in-\nstance issues not decided below.” National Collegiate\nAthletic Assn. v. Smith, 525 U. S. 459, 470 (1999). In\nparticular, when we reverse on a threshold question, we\ntypically remand for resolution of any claims the lower\ncourts’ error prevented them from addressing. See, e.g.,\nBond v. United States, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op.,\nat 1–2) (reversing the Court of Appeals’ determination on\nstanding and remanding because the “merits of petition-\ner’s challenge to the statute’s validity are to be considered,\nin the first instance, by the Court of Appeals”). We see no\nreason to depart from this approach in this case. Having\ndetermined that this case is justiciable, we leave it to the\nlower courts to consider the merits in the first instance.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the D. C.\nCircuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                               It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

I concur in the Court’s conclusion that this\ncase does not present a political question. I write sepa-\nrately, however, because I understand the inquiry re-\nquired by the political question doctrine to be more de-\nmanding than that suggested by the Court.\n                              I\n   The political question doctrine speaks to an amalgam of\ncircumstances in which courts properly examine whether\na particular suit is justiciable—that is, whether the dis-\npute is appropriate for resolution by courts. The doctrine\nis “essentially a function of the separation of powers,”\nBaker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 217 (1962), which recognizes\nthe limits that Article III imposes upon courts and accords\nappropriate respect to the other branches’ exercise of their\nown constitutional powers.\n   In Baker, this Court identified six circumstances in\n2                  ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nwhich an issue might present a political question: (1) “a\ntextually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the\nissue to a coordinate political department”; (2) “a lack of\njudicially discoverable and manageable standards for\nresolving it”; (3) “the impossibility of deciding without an\ninitial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudi-\ncial discretion”; (4) “the impossibility of a court’s undertak-\ning independent resolution without expressing lack of the\nrespect due coordinate branches of government”; (5) “an\nunusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political\ndecision already made”; or (6) “the potentiality of embar-\nrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various\ndepartments on one question.” Id., at 217. Baker estab-\nlished that “[u]nless one of these formulations is inextri-\ncable from the case at bar, there should be no dismissal for\nnonjusticiability.” Ibid. But Baker left unanswered when\nthe presence of one or more factors warrants dismissal,\nas well as the interrelationship of the six factors and the\nrelative importance of each in determining whether a case\nis suitable for adjudication.\n   In my view, the Baker factors reflect three distinct\njustifications for withholding judgment on the merits of a\ndispute. When a case would require a court to decide an\nissue whose resolution is textually committed to a coordi-\nnate political department, as envisioned by Baker’s first\nfactor, abstention is warranted because the court lacks\nauthority to resolve that issue. See, e.g., Nixon v. United\nStates, 506 U. S. 224, 229 (1993) (holding nonjusticiable\nthe Senate’s impeachment procedures in light of Article I’s\ncommitment to the Senate of the “ ‘sole Power to try all\nImpeachments’ ”); see also Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch\n137, 165–166 (1803) (“By the constitution of the United\nStates, the president is invested with certain important\npolitical powers, in the exercise of which he is to use\nhis own discretion, and is accountable only to his country\nin his political character, and to his own conscience”). In\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nsuch cases, the Constitution itself requires that another\nbranch resolve the question presented.\n  The second and third Baker factors reflect circum-\nstances in which a dispute calls for decisionmaking beyond\ncourts’ competence. “ ‘The judicial Power’ created by Arti-\ncle III, §1, of the Constitution is not whatever judges\nchoose to do,” but rather the power “to act in the manner\ntraditional for English and American courts.” Vieth v.\nJubelirer, 541 U. S. 267, 278 (2004) (plurality opinion).\nThat traditional role involves the application of some\nmanageable and cognizable standard within the compe-\ntence of the Judiciary to ascertain and employ to the facts\nof a concrete case. When a court is given no standard by\nwhich to adjudicate a dispute, or cannot resolve a dispute\nin the absence of a yet-unmade policy determination\ncharged to a political branch, resolution of the suit is be-\nyond the judicial role envisioned by Article III. See, e.g.,\nGilligan v. Morgan, 413 U. S. 1, 10 (1973) (“[I]t is difficult\nto conceive of an area of governmental activity in which\nthe courts have less competence” than “[t]he complex,\nsubtle, and professional decisions as to the composition,\ntraining, equipping, and control of a military force”); Vieth,\n541 U. S., at 278 (“One of the most obvious limitations\nimposed by [Article III] is that judicial action must be\ngoverned by standard . . . ”). This is not to say, of course,\nthat courts are incapable of interpreting or applying\nsomewhat ambiguous standards using familiar tools of\nstatutory or constitutional interpretation. But where an\nissue leaves courts truly rudderless, there can be “no\ndoubt of [the] validity” of a court’s decision to abstain from\njudgment. Ibid.\n  The final three Baker factors address circumstances in\nwhich prudence may counsel against a court’s resolution of\nan issue presented. Courts should be particularly cautious\nbefore forgoing adjudication of a dispute on the basis that\njudicial intervention risks “embarrassment from multifar-\n4                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nious pronouncements by various departments on one\nquestion,” would express a “lack of the respect due coordi-\nnate branches of government,” or because there exists an\n“unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political\ndecision already made.” 369 U. S., at 217. We have re-\npeatedly rejected the view that these thresholds are met\nwhenever a court is called upon to resolve the constitu-\ntionality or propriety of the act of another branch of Gov-\nernment. See, e.g., United States v. Munoz-Flores, 495\nU. S. 385, 390–391 (1990); Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S.\n486, 548, 549 (1969). A court may not refuse to adjudicate\na dispute merely because a decision “may have significant\npolitical overtones” or affect “the conduct of this Nation’s\nforeign relations,” Japan Whaling Assn. v. American\nCetacean Soc., 478 U. S. 221, 230 (1986). Nor may courts\ndecline to resolve a controversy within their traditional\ncompetence and proper jurisdiction simply because the\nquestion is difficult, the consequences weighty, or the\npotential real for conflict with the policy preferences of\nthe political branches. The exercise of such authority is\namong the “gravest and most delicate dut[ies] that this\nCourt is called on to perform,” Blodgett v. Holden, 275\nU. S. 142, 148 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurring), but it is\nthe role assigned to courts by the Constitution. “Questions\nmay occur which we would gladly avoid; but we cannot\navoid them. All we can do is, to exercise our best judg-\nment, and conscientiously to perform our duty.” Cohens v.\nVirginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85330\"><a href=\"/opinion/85330/cohens-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 404 (1821).\n   Rare occasions implicating Baker’s final factors, how-\never, may present an “ ‘unusual case’ ” unfit for judicial\ndisposition. 369 U.

See, e.g., Field v.\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                    5\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nClark, 143 U. S. 649, 672–673 (1892) (deeming “forbidden\nby the respect due to a coordinate branch of the govern-\nment” “[j]udicial action” requiring a belief in a “deliberate\nconspiracy” by the Senate and House of Representatives\n“to defeat an expression of the popular will”); see also\nMunoz-Flores, 495 U. S., at 409–410 (SCALIA, J., concur-\nring in judgment) (“Mutual regard between the coordinate\nbranches, and the interest of certainty, both demand that\nofficial representations regarding . . . matters of internal\nprocess be accepted at face value”). Likewise, we have\nlong acknowledged that courts are particularly ill suited\nto intervening in exigent disputes necessitating unusual\nneed for “attributing finality to the action of the political\ndepartments,” Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433, 454\n(1939), or creating acute “risk [of] embarrassment of our\ngovernment abroad, or grave disturbance at home,” Baker,\n369 U. S., at 226. See, e.g., Luther, 7 How., at 43 (“After\nthe President has acted and called out the militia, is a\nCircuit Court of the United States authorized to inquire\nwhether his decision was right? . . . If the judicial power\nextends so far, the guarantee contained in the Constitu-\ntion of the United States is a guarantee of anarchy, and\nnot of order”).1 Finally, it may be appropriate for courts to\nstay their hand in cases implicating delicate questions\nconcerning the distribution of political authority between\ncoordinate branches until a dispute is ripe, intractable,\nand incapable of resolution by the political process.

Abstention merely reflects that\njudicial intervention in such cases is “legitimate only in\nthe last resort,” Chicago & Grand Trunk R. Co. v. Well-\nman, 143 U. S. 339, 345 (1892), and is disfavored relative\nto the prospect of accommodation between the political\nbranches.\n   When such unusual cases arise, abstention accommo-\ndates considerations inherent in the separation of powers\nand the limitations envisioned by Article III, which con-\nferred authority to federal courts against a common-law\nbackdrop that recognized the propriety of abstention in\nexceptional cases.

In two respects, however, my understanding of the\npolitical question doctrine might require a court to engage\nin further analysis beyond that relied upon by the Court.\n  First, the Court appropriately recognizes that petition-\ner’s claim to a statutory right is “relevant” to the justicia-\nbility inquiry required in this case. Ante, at 6. In order to\nevaluate whether a case presents a political question, a\ncourt must first identify with precision the issue it is being\n——————\n    2 Often when such factors are implicated in a case presenting a politi-\n\ncal question, other factors identified in Baker will likewise be apparent.\nSee, e.g., Nixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224, 236 (1993) (“[i]n addi-\ntion to the textual commitment argument,” finding persuasive that\n“opening the door of judicial review” of impeachment procedures would\n“ ‘expose the political life of the country to months, or perhaps years, of\nchaos’ ”); Baker, 369 U.

CLINTON\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nasked to decide. Here, petitioner’s suit claims that a\nfederal statute provides him with a right to have “Israel”\nlisted as his place of birth on his passport and other re-\nlated documents. App. 15–18. To decide that question, a\ncourt must determine whether the statute is constitu-\ntional, and therefore mandates the Secretary of State to\nissue petitioner’s desired passport, or unconstitutional, in\nwhich case his suit is at an end. Resolution of that issue is\nnot one “textually committed” to another branch; to the\ncontrary, it is committed to this one. In no fashion does the\nquestion require a court to review the wisdom of the Pres-\nident’s policy toward Jerusalem or any other decision\ncommitted to the discretion of a coordinate department.\nFor that reason, I agree that the decision below should be\nreversed.\n   That is not to say, however, that no statute could give\nrise to a political question. It is not impossible to imagine\na case involving the application or even the constitutional-\nity of an enactment that would present a nonjusticiable\nissue. Indeed, this Court refused to determine whether an\nOhio state constitutional provision offended the Repub-\nlican Guarantee Clause, Art. IV, §4, holding that “the\nquestion of whether that guarantee of the Constitution\nhas been disregarded presents no justiciable controversy.”\nOhio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, 241 U. S. 565, 569 (1916).\nA similar result would follow if Congress passed a statute,\nfor instance, purporting to award financial relief to those\nimproperly “tried” of impeachment offenses. To adjudicate\nclaims under such a statute would require a court to re-\nsolve the very same issue we found nonjusticiable in\nNixon. Such examples are atypical, but they suffice to show\nthat the foreclosure altogether of political question analy-\nsis in statutory cases is unwarranted.\n   Second, the Court suggests that this case does not im-\nplicate the political question doctrine’s concern with issues\nexhibiting “ ‘a lack of judicially discoverable and managea-\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

But that was equally\ntrue in Nixon, a case in which we found that “the use of\nthe word ‘try’ in the first sentence of the Impeachment\nTrial Clause lacks sufficient precision to afford any judi-\ncially manageable standard of review of the Senate’s\nactions.” 506 U. S., at 230. We reached that conclusion\neven though the parties’ briefs focused upon the text of the\nImpeachment Trial Clause, “the Constitution’s drafting\nhistory,” “contemporaneous commentary,” “the unbroken\npractice of the Senate for 150 years,” contemporary dic-\ntionary meanings, “Hamilton’s Federalist essays,” and the\npractice in the House of Lords prior to ratification. Such\nevidence was no more or less unfamiliar to courts than\nthat on which the parties rely here.\n   In my view, it is not whether the evidence upon which\nlitigants rely is common to judicial consideration that\ndetermines whether a case lacks judicially discoverable\nand manageable standards. Rather, it is whether that\nevidence in fact provides a court a basis to adjudicate\nmeaningfully the issue with which it is presented. The\nanswer will almost always be yes, but if the parties’ tex-\ntual, structural, and historical evidence is inapposite or\nwholly unilluminating, rendering judicial decision no more\nthan guesswork, a case relying on the ordinary kinds of\narguments offered to courts might well still present justi-\nciability concerns.\n   In this case, however, the Court of Appeals majority\nfound a political question solely on the basis that this case\nrequired resolution of an issue “textually committed” to\nthe Executive Branch. Because there was no such textual\ncommitment, I respectfully concur in the Court’s decision\nto reverse the Court of Appeals.\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

This case\ndoes not require the Judiciary to decide whether the power\nto recognize foreign governments and the extent of their\nterritory is conferred exclusively on the President or is\nshared with Congress. Petitioner does not claim that the\nstatutory provision in question represents an attempt by\nCongress to dictate United States policy regarding the\nstatus of Jerusalem. Instead, petitioner contends in effect\nthat Congress has the power to mandate that an American\ncitizen born abroad be given the option of including in his\npassport and Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA)\nwhat amounts to a statement of personal belief on the\nstatus of Jerusalem.\n   Powers conferred on Congress by the Constitution cer-\ntainly give Congress a measure of authority to prescribe\nthe contents of passports and CRBAs. The Constitution\ngives Congress the power to regulate foreign commerce,\nArt. I, §8, cl. 3, and this power includes the power to regu-\nlate the entry of persons into this country, see Henderson\n2                  ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nv. Mayor of New York, 92 U. S. 259, 270–271 (1876). The\nConstitution also gives Congress the power to make a\n“uniform Rule of Naturalization,” Art. I, §8, cl. 4, and\npursuant to this power, Congress has enacted laws con-\ncerning the citizenship of children born abroad to parents\nwho are citizens of this country, see United States v. Wong\nKim Ark, 169 U. S. 649, 688 (1898). These powers allow\nCongress to mandate that identifying information be in-\ncluded in passports and CRBAs.\n   The President also has a measure of authority concern-\ning the contents of passports and CRBAs. The President\nhas broad authority in the field of foreign affairs, see, e.g.,\nAmerican Ins. Assn. v. Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 414\n(2003), and, historically, that authority has included the\npower to issue passports, even in the absence of any for-\nmal congressional conferral of authority to do so. See\nHaig v. Agee, 453 U. S. 280, 293 (1981) (explaining that\n“[p]rior to 1856, when there was no statute on the subject,\nthe common perception was that the issuance of a pass-\nport was committed to the sole discretion of the Executive\nand that the Executive would exercise this power in the\ninterests of the national security and foreign policy of the\nUnited States”). We have described a passport as “a letter\nof introduction in which the issuing sovereign vouches for\nthe bearer and requests other sovereigns to aid the bear-\ner.” Id., at 292. This is apparent from the first page of\npetitioner’s passport, which reads as follows:\n    “The Secretary of State of the United States of Amer-\n    ica hereby requests all whom it may concern to permit\n    the citizen / national of the United States named here-\n    in to pass without delay or hindrance and in case of\n    need to give all lawful aid and protection.” App. 19.\nSimilarly, a CRBA is a certification made by a consular of-\nficial that the bearer acquired United States citizenship\nat birth.

As she\npoints out, Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186 (1962), set forth\nseveral categories of legal questions that the Court had\npreviously held to be “political questions” inappropriate for\njudicial determination. Those categories include (1) in-\nstances in which the Constitution clearly commits deci-\nsionmaking power to another branch of Government, and\n(2) issues lacking judicially manageable standards for\nresolution. Id., at 217. They also include (3) issues that\ncourts cannot decide without making “an initial policy\ndetermination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion,”\n(4) issues that a court cannot independently decide “with-\nout expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches\nof government,” (5) cases in which there is “an unusual\nneed for unquestioning adherence to a political decision\nalready made,” and (6) cases in which there is a potential\nfor “embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by\nvarious departments on one question.” Ibid.\n  As JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR also points out, these categories\n(and in my view particularly the last four) embody “cir-\ncumstances in which prudence may counsel against a\n2                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncourt’s resolution of an issue presented.” Ante, at 3 (opin-\nion concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see\nNixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224, 253 (1993) (Souter,\nJ., concurring in judgment) (the political-question doctrine\n“deriv[es] in large part from prudential concerns about the\nrespect we owe the political departments”); Goldwater v.\nCarter, 444 U. S. 996, 1000 (1979) (Powell, J., concurring\nin judgment) (“[T]he political-question doctrine rests in\npart on prudential concerns calling for mutual respect\namong the three branches of Government”); see also Jaffe,\nStanding to Secure Judicial Review: Public Actions, 74\nHarv. L. Rev. 1265, 1304 (1961) (prudence counsels hesita-\ntion where a legal issue is “felt to be so closely related to\na complex of decisions not within the court’s jurisdiction\nthat its resolution by the court would either be poor in\nitself or would jeopardize sound decisions in the larger\ncomplex”).\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR adds that the circumstances in\nwhich these prudential considerations lead the Court not\nto decide a case otherwise properly before it are rare.\nAnte, at 7. I agree. But in my view we nonetheless have\nbefore us such a case. Four sets of prudential considera-\ntions, taken together, lead me to that conclusion.\n   First, the issue before us arises in the field of foreign\naffairs. (Indeed, the statutory provision before us is a\nsubsection of a section that concerns the relation between\nJerusalem and the State of Israel. See §214 of the Foreign\nRelations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003, 116 Stat.\n1365 (“United States Policy with Respect to Jerusalem as\nthe Capital of Israel”).) The Constitution primarily dele-\ngates the foreign affairs powers “to the political depart-\nments of the government, Executive and Legislative,” not\nto the Judiciary. Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v.\nWaterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 111 (1948); see also\nMarbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 166 (1803) (noting\ndiscretionary foreign affairs functions of Secretary of State\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nas beyond the power of the Judiciary to review). And that\nfact is not surprising. Decisionmaking in this area typical-\nly is highly political. It is “delicate” and “complex.” Chi-\ncago & Southern Air Lines, 333 U. S., at 111. It often\nrests upon information readily available to the Executive\nBranch and to the intelligence committees of Congress,\nbut not readily available to the courts. Ibid. It frequently\nis highly dependent upon what Justice Jackson called\n“prophecy.” Ibid. And the creation of wise foreign policy\ntypically lies well beyond the experience or professional\ncapacity of a judge. Ibid. At the same time, where foreign\naffairs is at issue, the practical need for the United States\nto speak “with one voice and ac[t] as one,” is particularly\nimportant. See United States v. Pink, 315 U. S. 203, 242\n(1942) (Frankfurter, J., concurring); see also R. Fallon,\nJ. Manning, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and\nWechsler’s The Federal Courts and the Federal System\n240 (6th ed. 2009).\n   The result is a judicial hesitancy to make decisions that\nhave significant foreign policy implications, as reflected in\nthe fact that many of the cases in which the Court has in-\nvoked the political-question doctrine have arisen in this\narea, e.g., cases in which the validity of a treaty depended\nupon the partner state’s constitutional authority, Doe v.\nBraden, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86894\"><a href=\"/opinion/86894/doe-v-braden/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 657 (1854), or upon its continuing\nexistence, Terlinden v.

See Baker, supra, at 186, 211–213\n(citing these cases as the Court’s principal foreign-\nrelations political-question cases); see also Fallon, supra,\n4                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nat 243–247.\n   Second, if the courts must answer the constitutional\nquestion before us, they may well have to evaluate the\nforeign policy implications of foreign policy decisions. The\nconstitutional question focuses upon a statutory provision,\n§214(d), that says: The Secretary of State, upon the re-\nquest of a U. S. citizen born in Jerusalem (or upon the\nrequest of the citizen’s legal guardian), shall “record” in\nthe citizen’s passport or consular birth report “the place\nof birth as Israel.” 116 Stat. 1366. And the question is\nwhether this statute unconstitutionally seeks to limit the\nPresident’s inherent constitutional authority to make cer-\ntain kinds of foreign policy decisions. See American Ins.\nAssn. v. Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 414–415 (2003)\n(citing cases); Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U. S. 417,\n445 (1998) (“[T]his Court has recognized that in the for-\neign affairs arena, the President has ‘a degree of discretion\nand freedom from statutory restriction which would not be\nadmissible were domestic affairs alone involved’ ” (quoting\nUnited States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S.\n304, 320 (1936))); cf. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co.\nv. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 637–638 (1952) (Jackson, J.,\nconcurring).\n   The Secretary of State argues that the President’s con-\nstitutional authority to determine foreign policy includes\nthe power to recognize foreign governments, that this\nCourt has long recognized that the latter power belongs\nto the President exclusively, that the power includes the\npower to determine claims over disputed territory as well\nas the policy governing recognition decisions, and that the\nstatute unconstitutionally limits the President’s exclusive\nauthority to exercise these powers. See U. S. Const., Art.\nII, §2, cl. 2; Art. II, §3; e.g., Kennett v. Chambers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86769\"><a href=\"/opinion/86769/kennett-v-chambers/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 50–51 (1852) (recognition); Williams, supra, at 420\n(disputed territory); Pink, supra, at 229 (recognition poli-\ncy); see also Haig v. Agee, 453 U. S. 280, 293 (1981) (execu-\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntive passport authority).\n   Zivotofsky, supported by several Members of Congress,\npoints out that the Constitution also grants Congress\npowers related to foreign affairs, such as the powers to\ndeclare war, to regulate foreign commerce, and to regulate\nnaturalization. See Art. I, §8, cls. 3, 4, 11; see also Ameri-\ncan Ins. Assn., supra, at 414. They add that Congress may\nshare some of the recognition power and its attendant\npower of determining claims over disputed territory. E.g.,\nPalmer, supra, at 634 (recognition); Jones v. United States,\n137 U. S. 202, 212 (1890) (disputed territory). And they\nadd that Congress may enact laws concerning travel into\nthis country and concerning the citizenship of children\nborn abroad to U. S. citizens. See Henderson v. Mayor of\nNew York, 92 U. S. 259, 270–271 (1876) (travel); Fong Yue\nTing v. United States, 149 U. S. 698, 714 (1893) (immigra-\ntion); United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U. S. 649, 688\n(1898) (citizenship). They argue that these powers include\nthe power to specify the content of a passport (or consular\nbirth report). And when such a specification takes the\nform of statutory law, they say, the Constitution requires\nthe President (through the Secretary of State) to execute\nthat statute. See Art. II, §3.\n   Were the statutory provision undisputedly concerned\nonly with purely administrative matters (or were its en-\nforcement undisputedly to involve only major foreign\npolicy matters), judicial efforts to answer the constitu-\ntional question might not involve judges in trying to an-\nswer questions of foreign policy. But in the Middle East,\nadministrative matters can have implications that extend\nfar beyond the purely administrative. Political reactions\nin that region can prove uncertain. And in that context it\nmay well turn out that resolution of the constitutional\nargument will require a court to decide how far the stat-\nute, in practice, reaches beyond the purely administrative,\ndetermining not only whether but also the extent to\n6                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwhich enforcement will interfere with the President’s\nability to make significant recognition-related foreign\npolicy decisions.\n   Certainly the parties argue as if that were so. Zivo-\ntofsky, for example, argues that replacing “Jerusalem” on\nhis passport with “Israel” will have no serious foreign\npolicy significance. See Brief for Petitioner 43, 46–52;\nReply Brief for Petitioner 25–26. And in support he points\nto (1) a State Department official’s statement that birth-\nplace designation serves primarily as “an element of iden-\ntification,” while omitting mention of recognition; (2) the\nfact that the State Department has recorded births in\nunrecognized territories in the region, such as the Gaza\nStrip and the West Bank, apparently without adverse\neffect; and (3) the fact that sometimes Jerusalem does\n(because of what the Government calls “clerical errors”)\ncarry with it the name of “Israel” on certain official docu-\nments, again apparently without seriously adverse effect.\nSee Brief for Petitioner 7–10, 15, 43, 50; App. 50, 58–60,\n75–76. Moreover, Zivotofsky says, it is unfair to allow the\n100,000 or so Americans born in cities that the United\nStates recognizes as under Israeli sovereignty, such as Tel\nAviv or Haifa, the right to a record that mentions Israel,\nwhile denying that privilege to the 50,000 or so Americans\nborn in Jerusalem. See Brief for Petitioner 18–20, 48–49;\nApp. 48.\n   At the same time, the Secretary argues that listing\nIsrael on the passports (and consular birth reports) of\nAmericans born in Jerusalem will have significantly ad-\nverse foreign policy effects. See Brief for Respondent 8,\n37–41. She says that doing so would represent “ ‘an offi-\ncial decision by the United States to begin to treat Jerusa-\nlem as a city located within Israel,’ ” id., at 38–39, that it\n“would be interpreted as an official act of recognizing\nJerusalem as being under Israeli sovereignty,” App. 56,\nand that our “national security interests” consequently\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)             7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n“would be significantly harmed,” id., at 49. Such an ac-\ntion, she says, “ ‘would signal, symbolically or concretely,\nthat’ ” the United States “ ‘recognizes that Jerusalem is a\ncity that is located within the sovereign territory of Is-\nrael,’” and doing so, “‘would critically compromise the ability\nof the United States to work with Israelis, Palestinians\nand others in the region to further the peace process.’ ”\nBrief for Respondent 2; App. 52–53. She adds that the\nvery enactment of this statutory provision in 2002 pro-\nduced headlines in the Middle East stating the “the U. S.\nnow recognizes Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.” Id., at 231;\nBrief for Respondent 10; see also App. 53–55, 227–231.\n   A judge’s ability to evaluate opposing claims of this kind\nis minimal. At the same time, a judicial effort to do so\nrisks inadvertently jeopardizing sound foreign policy\ndecisionmaking by the other branches of Government.\nHow, for example, is this Court to determine whether, or\nthe extent to which, the continuation of the adjudication\nthat it now orders will itself have a foreign policy effect?\n   Third, the countervailing interests in obtaining judicial\nresolution of the constitutional determination are not\nparticularly strong ones. Zivotofsky does not assert the\nkind of interest, e.g., an interest in property or bodily\nintegrity, which courts have traditionally sought to pro-\ntect. See, e.g., Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651, 673–\n674 (1977) (enduring commitment to legal protection of\nbodily integrity). Nor, importantly, does he assert an\ninterest in vindicating a basic right of the kind that the\nConstitution grants to individuals and that courts tradi-\ntionally have protected from invasion by the other branches\nof Government. And I emphasize this fact because the\nneed for judicial action in such cases can trump the foreign\npolicy concerns that I have mentioned. As Professor Jaffe\npointed out many years ago, “Our courts would not refuse\nto entertain habeas corpus to test the constitutionality of\nthe imprisonment of an alleged Chinese agent even if it\n8                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwere clear that his imprisonment was closely bound up\nwith our relations to the Chinese government.” 74 Harv.\nL. Rev., at 1304; see also T. Franck, Political Questions/\nJudicial Answers 63–64 (1992); cf. Boumediene v. Bush,\n553 U. S. 723, 755 (2008).\n  The interest that Zivotofsky asserts, however, is akin to\nan ideological interest. See Brief for Petitioner 54 (citizen\nborn in Jerusalem, unlike citizen born in Tel Aviv or\nHaifa, does not have the “option” to “specify or suppress the\nname of a country that accords with his or her ideology”);\nsee also id., at 19 (State Department policy bars citizens\nborn in Jerusalem “from identifying their birthplace in a\nmanner that conforms with their convictions”). And inso-\nfar as an individual suffers an injury that is purely ideo-\nlogical, courts have often refused to consider the matter,\nleaving the injured party to look to the political branches\nfor protection. E.g., Diamond v. Charles, 476 U. S. 54, 66–\n67 (1986); Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727, 739–740\n(1972). This is not to say that Zivotofsky’s claim is unim-\nportant or that the injury is not serious or even that it is\npurely ideological. It is to point out that those suffering\nsomewhat similar harms have sometimes had to look to\nthe political branches for resolution of relevant legal is-\nsues. Cf. United States v. Richardson, 418 U. S. 166, 179\n(1974); Laird v. Tatum, 408 U. S. 1, 15 (1972).\n  Fourth, insofar as the controversy reflects different\nforeign policy views among the political branches of Gov-\nernment, those branches have nonjudicial methods of\nworking out their differences. Cf. Goldwater, 444 U. S., at\n1002, 1004 (Rehnquist, J., joined by Burger, C.

Indeed, both the Legislative\nBranch and the Executive Branch typically understand\nthe need to work each with the other in order to create\neffective foreign policy. In that understanding, those\nrelated contacts, and the continuous foreign policy-related\nrelationship lies the possibility of working out the kind of\ndisagreement we see before us. Moreover, if application of\nthe political-question “doctrine ultimately turns, as\nLearned Hand put it, on ‘how importunately the occasion\ndemands an answer,’ ” Nixon, 506 U. S., at 253 (Souter, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (quoting L. Hand, The Bill of\nRights 15 (1958)), the ability of the political branches to\nwork out their differences minimizes the need for judicial\nintervention here.\n   The upshot is that this case is unusual both in its mini-\nmal need for judicial intervention and in its more serious\nrisk that intervention will bring about “embarrassment,”\nshow lack of “respect” for the other branches, and poten-\ntially disrupt sound foreign policy decisionmaking. For\nthese prudential reasons, I would hold that the political-\nquestion doctrine bars further judicial consideration of\nthis case. And I would affirm the Court of Appeals’ simi-\nlar conclusion.\n   With respect, I dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 626209, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2012/03/26/Zivotofsky_v._Clinton.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2011                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued November 7, 2011—Decided March 26, 2012\nPetitioner Menachem Binyamin Zivotofsky was born in Jerusalem. His\n  mother requested that Zivotofsky’s place of birth be listed as “Israel”\n  on a consular report of birth abroad and on his passport, pursuant to\n  §214(d) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003.\n  That provision states: “For purposes of the registration of birth, certi-\n  fication of nationality, or issuance of a passport of a United States cit-\n  izen born in the city of Jerusalem, the Secretary shall, upon the re-\n  quest of the citizen or the citizen’s legal guardian, record the place of\n  birth as Israel.” U. S. officials refused the request, citing a State De-\n  partment policy that prohibits recording “Israel” as the place of birth\n  for those born in Jerusalem. Zivotofsky’s parents filed a suit on his\n  behalf against the Secretary of State. The District Court dismissed\n  the case, holding that it presented a nonjusticiable political question\n  regarding Jerusalem’s political status. The D. C. Circuit affirmed,\n  reasoning that the Constitution gives the Executive the exclusive\n  power to recognize foreign sovereigns, and that the exercise of that\n  power cannot be reviewed by the courts.\nHeld: The political question doctrine does not bar judicial review of Zi-\n votofsky’s claim. Pp. 5−12.\n    (a) This Court has said that a controversy “involves a political\n question . . . where there is ‘a textually demonstrable constitutional\n commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a\n lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolv-\n ing it.’ ” Nixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224, 228. The lower courts\n ruled that this case presents such a political question because they\n2                        ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    misunderstood the issue, assuming resolution of Zivotofsky’s claim\n    would require the Judiciary to define U. S. policy regarding the sta-\n    tus of Jerusalem. In fact, this case asks the courts to determine only\n    whether Zivotofsky can vindicate his statutory right under §214(d) to\n    choose to have Israel recorded as his place of birth on his passport.\n    Making such determinations is a familiar judicial exercise. Moreo-\n    ver, because the parties do not dispute the interpretation of §214(d),\n    the only real question for the courts is whether the statute is consti-\n    tutional. There is no “textually demonstrable constitutional com-\n    mitment” of that question to another branch: At least since Marbury\n    v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, this Court has recognized that it is “em-\n    phatically the province and duty” of the Judiciary to determine the\n    constitutionality of a statute. Nor is there “a lack of judicially discov-\n    erable and manageable standards for resolving” the question: Both\n    parties offer detailed legal arguments concerning whether the textu-\n    al, structural, and historical evidence supports a determination that\n    §214(d) is constitutional. Pp. 5–12.\n      (b) Because the lower courts erroneously concluded that the case\n    presents a political question, they did not reach the merits of Zivo-\n    tofsky’s claim. This Court is “a court of final review and not first\n    view,” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U.

The State Department\ndeclined to follow that law, citing its longstanding policy of\nnot taking a position on the political status of Jerusalem.\nWhen sued by an American who invoked the statute, the\nSecretary of State argued that the courts lacked authority\nto decide the case because it presented a political question.\nThe Court of Appeals so held.\n  We disagree. The courts are fully capable of determin-\ning whether this statute may be given effect, or instead\nmust be struck down in light of authority conferred on the\nExecutive by the Constitution.\n                          I\n                          A\n  In 2002, Congress enacted the Foreign Relations Au-\n2                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003, 116 Stat. 1350. Section\n214 of the Act is entitled “United States Policy with Re-\nspect to Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel.” Id., at 1365.\nThe first two subsections express Congress’s “commit-\nment” to relocating the United States Embassy in Israel to\nJerusalem. Id., at 1365–1366. The third bars funding for\nthe publication of official Government documents that do\nnot list Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Id., at 1366.\nThe fourth and final provision, §214(d), is the only one at\nstake in this case. Entitled “Record of Place of Birth as\nIsrael for Passport Purposes,” it provides that “[f]or pur-\nposes of the registration of birth, certification of national-\nity, or issuance of a passport of a United States citizen born\nin the city of Jerusalem, the Secretary shall, upon the re-\nquest of the citizen or the citizen’s legal guardian, record\nthe place of birth as Israel.” Ibid.\n   The State Department’s Foreign Affairs Manual states\nthat “[w]here the birthplace of the applicant is located\nin territory disputed by another country, the city or area\nof birth may be written in the passport.” 7 Foreign Affairs\nManual §1383.5–2, App. 108. The manual specifically\ndirects that passport officials should enter “JERUSALEM”\nand should “not write Israel or Jordan” when recording\nthe birthplace of a person born in Jerusalem on a pass-\nport. Id., §1383, Exh. 1383.1, App. 127; see also id.,\n§§1383.1, 1383.5–4, .5–5, .5–6, App. 106, 108–110.\n   Section 214(d) sought to override this instruction by\nallowing citizens born in Jerusalem to have “Israel” rec-\norded on their passports if they wish. In signing the For-\neign Relations Authorization Act into law, President\nGeorge W. Bush stated his belief that §214 “impermissibly\ninterferes with the President’s constitutional authority to\nconduct the Nation’s foreign affairs and to supervise the\nunitary executive branch.” Statement on Signing the\nForeign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003,\nPublic Papers of the Presidents, George W.

He added that if the sec-\ntion is “construed as mandatory,” then it would “interfere\nwith the President’s constitutional authority to formulate\nthe position of the United States, speak for the Nation in\ninternational affairs, and determine the terms on which\nrecognition is given to foreign states.” Ibid. He concluded\nby emphasizing that “U. S. policy regarding Jerusalem has\nnot changed.” Ibid. The President made no specific refer-\nence to the passport mandate in §214(d).\n                              B\n   Petitioner Menachem Binyamin Zivotofsky was born in\nJerusalem on October 17, 2002, shortly after §214(d) was\nenacted. Zivotofsky’s parents were American citizens and\nhe accordingly was as well, by virtue of congressional\nenactment. 8 U. S. C. §1401(c); see Rogers v. Bellei, 401\nU. S. 815, 835 (1971) (foreign-born children of American\ncitizens acquire citizenship at birth through “congres-\nsional generosity”). Zivotofsky’s mother filed an application\nfor a consular report of birth abroad and a United States\npassport. She requested that his place of birth be listed as\n“Jerusalem, Israel” on both documents. U. S. officials\ninformed Zivotofsky’s mother that State Department\npolicy prohibits recording “Israel” as Zivotofsky’s place of\nbirth. Pursuant to that policy, Zivotofsky was issued a\npassport and consular report of birth abroad listing only\n“Jerusalem.” App. 19–20.\n   Zivotofsky’s parents filed a complaint on his behalf\nagainst the Secretary of State. Zivotofsky sought a de-\nclaratory judgment and a permanent injunction ordering\nthe Secretary to identify his place of birth as “Jerusalem,\nIsrael” in the official documents. Id., at 17–18. The Dis-\ntrict Court granted the Secretary’s motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint on the grounds that Zivotofsky lacked standing\nand that his complaint presented a nonjusticiable political\nquestion.\n4                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit reversed,\nconcluding that Zivotofsky did have standing. It then\nobserved that while Zivotofsky had originally asked that\n“Jerusalem, Israel” be recorded on his passport, “[b]oth\nsides agree that the question now is whether §214(d)\nentitles [him] to have just ‘Israel’ listed as his place of\nbirth.” 444 F. 3d 614, 619 (2006). The D. C. Circuit de-\ntermined that additional factual development might be\nhelpful in deciding whether this question was justiciable,\nas the parties disagreed about the foreign policy implica-\ntions of listing “Israel” alone as a birthplace on the pass-\nport. Id., at 619–620. It therefore remanded the case to\nthe District Court.\n   The District Court again found that the case was not\njusticiable. It explained that “[r]esolving [Zivotofsky’s]\nclaim on the merits would necessarily require the Court to\ndecide the political status of Jerusalem.” 511 F. Supp. 2d\n97, 103 (2007). Concluding that the claim therefore pre-\nsented a political question, the District Court dismissed\nthe case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   The D. C. Circuit affirmed. It reasoned that the Consti-\ntution gives the Executive the exclusive power to recognize\nforeign sovereigns, and that the exercise of this power\ncannot be reviewed by the courts. Therefore, “deciding\nwhether the Secretary of State must mark a passport . . .\nas Zivotofsky requests would necessarily draw [the court]\ninto an area of decisionmaking the Constitution leaves to\nthe Executive alone.” 571 F. 3d 1227, 1232–1233 (2009).\nThe D. C. Circuit held that the political question doctrine\nprohibits such an intrusion by the courts, and rejected any\nsuggestion that Congress’s decision to take “a position on\nthe status of Jerusalem” could change the analysis. Id., at\n1233.\n   Judge Edwards concurred in the judgment, but wrote\nseparately to express his view that the political question\ndoctrine has no application to this case. He explained that\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe issue before the court was whether §214(d) “impermis-\nsibly intrude[s] on the President’s exclusive power to\nrecognize foreign sovereigns.” Id., at 1234. That question,\nhe observed, involves “commonplace issues of statutory\nand constitutional interpretation” plainly within the con-\nstitutional authority of the Judiciary to decide. Id., at\n1235. Reaching the merits, Judge Edwards determined\nthat designating Israel as a place of birth on a passport is\na policy “in furtherance of the recognition power.” Id., at\n1243. Because in his view the Constitution gives that\npower exclusively to the President, Judge Edwards found\n§214(d) unconstitutional. For this reason, he concluded\nthat Zivotofsky had no viable cause of action, and con-\ncurred in affirming the dismissal of the complaint.\n  Zivotofsky petitioned for certiorari, and we granted\nreview. 563 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                              II\n  The lower courts concluded that Zivotofsky’s claim\npresents a political question and therefore cannot be ad-\njudicated. We disagree.\n  In general, the Judiciary has a responsibility to decide\ncases properly before it, even those it “would gladly avoid.”\nCohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404 (1821). Our prece-\ndents have identified a narrow exception to that rule,\nknown as the “political question” doctrine. See, e.g., Ja-\npan Whaling Assn. v. American Cetacean Soc., 478 U. S.\n221, 230 (1986). We have explained that a controversy\n“involves a political question . . . where there is ‘a textu-\nally demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue\nto a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially\ndiscoverable and manageable standards for resolving it.’ ”\nNixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224, 228 (1993) (quoting\nBaker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 217 (1962)). In such a case,\nwe have held that a court lacks the authority to decide the\ndispute before it.\n6                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    The lower courts ruled that this case involves a political\nquestion because deciding Zivotofsky’s claim would force\nthe Judicial Branch to interfere with the President’s exer-\ncise of constitutional power committed to him alone. The\nDistrict Court understood Zivotofsky to ask the courts to\n“decide the political status of Jerusalem.” 511 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 103. This misunderstands the issue presented. Zivo-\ntofsky does not ask the courts to determine whether Jeru-\nsalem is the capital of Israel. He instead seeks to deter-\nmine whether he may vindicate his statutory right, under\n§214(d), to choose to have Israel recorded on his passport\nas his place of birth.\n    For its part, the D. C. Circuit treated the two questions\nas one and the same. That court concluded that “[o]nly\nthe Executive—not Congress and not the courts—has the\npower to define U. S. policy regarding Israel’s sovereignty\nover Jerusalem,” and also to “decide how best to imple-\nment that policy.” 571 F. 3d, at 1232. Because the De-\npartment’s passport rule was adopted to implement the\nPresident’s “exclusive and unreviewable constitutional\npower to keep the United States out of the debate over the\nstatus of Jerusalem,” the validity of that rule was itself a\n“nonjusticiable political question” that “the Constitution\nleaves to the Executive alone.” Id., at 1231–1233. Indeed,\nthe D. C. Circuit’s opinion does not even mention §214(d)\nuntil the fifth of its six paragraphs of analysis, and then\nonly to dismiss it as irrelevant: “That Congress took a\nposition on the status of Jerusalem and gave Zivotofsky a\nstatutory cause of action . . . is of no moment to whether\nthe judiciary has [the] authority to resolve this dispute\n. . . .” Id., at 1233.\n    The existence of a statutory right, however, is certainly\nrelevant to the Judiciary’s power to decide Zivotofsky’s\nclaim. The federal courts are not being asked to supplant\na foreign policy decision of the political branches with the\ncourts’ own unmoored determination of what United\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)              7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nStates policy toward Jerusalem should be. Instead, Zivo-\ntofsky requests that the courts enforce a specific statutory\nright. To resolve his claim, the Judiciary must decide if\nZivotofsky’s interpretation of the statute is correct, and\nwhether the statute is constitutional. This is a familiar\njudicial exercise.\n   Moreover, because the parties do not dispute the inter-\npretation of §214(d), the only real question for the courts is\nwhether the statute is constitutional. At least since Mar-\nbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), we have recognized\nthat when an Act of Congress is alleged to conflict with the\nConstitution, “[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of\nthe judicial department to say what the law is.” Id., at\n177. That duty will sometimes involve the “[r]esolution of\nlitigation challenging the constitutional authority of one of\nthe three branches,” but courts cannot avoid their respon-\nsibility merely “because the issues have political implica-\ntions.” INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 943 (1983).\n   In this case, determining the constitutionality of §214(d)\ninvolves deciding whether the statute impermissibly\nintrudes upon Presidential powers under the Constitution.\nIf so, the law must be invalidated and Zivotofsky’s case\nshould be dismissed for failure to state a claim. If, on the\nother hand, the statute does not trench on the President’s\npowers, then the Secretary must be ordered to issue Zivo-\ntofsky a passport that complies with §214(d). Either way,\nthe political question doctrine is not implicated. “No\npolicy underlying the political question doctrine suggests\nthat Congress or the Executive . . . can decide the constitu-\ntionality of a statute; that is a decision for the courts.” Id.,\nat 941–942.\n   The Secretary contends that “there is ‘a textually de-\nmonstrable constitutional commitment’ ” to the President\nof the sole power to recognize foreign sovereigns and, as\na corollary, to determine whether an American born in\nJerusalem may choose to have Israel listed as his place of\n8                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbirth on his passport. Nixon, 506 U. S., at 228 (quoting\nBaker, 369 U. S., at 217); see Brief for Respondent 49–50.\nPerhaps. But there is, of course, no exclusive commitment\nto the Executive of the power to determine the constitu-\ntionality of a statute. The Judicial Branch appropriately\nexercises that authority, including in a case such as this,\nwhere the question is whether Congress or the Executive\nis “aggrandizing its power at the expense of another\nbranch.” Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 878\n(1991); see, e.g., Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52, 176\n(1926) (finding a statute unconstitutional because it en-\ncroached upon the President’s removal power); Bowsher v.\nSynar, 478 U. S. 714, 734 (1986) (finding a statute un-\nconstitutional because it “intruded into the executive\nfunction”); Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654, 685 (1988)\n(upholding a statute’s constitutionality against a charge\nthat it “impermissibly interfere[d] with the President’s\nexercise of his constitutionally appointed functions”).\n   Our precedents have also found the political question\ndoctrine implicated when there is “ ‘a lack of judicially\ndiscoverable and manageable standards for resolving’ ” the\nquestion before the court. Nixon, supra, at 228 (quoting\nBaker, supra, at 217). Framing the issue as the lower\ncourts did, in terms of whether the Judiciary may decide\nthe political status of Jerusalem, certainly raises those\nconcerns. They dissipate, however, when the issue is\nrecognized to be the more focused one of the constitution-\nality of §214(d). Indeed, both sides offer detailed legal\narguments regarding whether §214(d) is constitutional in\nlight of powers committed to the Executive, and whether\nCongress’s own powers with respect to passports must be\nweighed in analyzing this question.\n   For example, the Secretary reprises on the merits her\nargument on the political question issue, claiming that the\nConstitution gives the Executive the exclusive power to\nformulate recognition policy.

According to the Secretary, “[c]enturies-long\nExecutive Branch practice, congressional acquiescence,\nand decisions by this Court” confirm that the “receive\nAmbassadors” clause confers upon the Executive the\nexclusive power of recognition.

And she cites precedents from this Court\nstating that “[p]olitical recognition is exclusively a func-\ntion of the Executive.” Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sab-\nbatino, 376 U. S. 398, 410 (1964); see Brief for Respondent\n24–27 (citing, e.g., United States v. Pink, 315 U. S. 203\n(1942)).\n    The Secretary further contends that §214(d) constitutes\nan impermissible exercise of the recognition power be-\ncause “the decision as to how to describe the place of birth\n. . . operates as an official statement of whether the United\nStates recognizes a state’s sovereignty over a territorial\narea.” Brief for Respondent 38. The Secretary will not\n“list[] as a place of birth a country whose sovereignty over\nthe relevant territory the United States does not recog-\nnize.” Id., at 39. Therefore, she claims, “listing ‘Israel’ as\nthe place of birth would constitute an official decision by\n10                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe United States to begin to treat Jerusalem as a city\nlocated within Israel. ” Id., at 38–39 (some internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n   For his part, Zivotofsky argues that, far from being an\nexercise of the recognition power, §214(d) is instead a\n“legitimate and permissible” exercise of Congress’s “au-\nthority to legislate on the form and content of a passport.”\nBrief for Petitioner 53. He points the Court to Professor\nLouis Henkin’s observation that “ ‘in the competition for\npower in foreign relations,’ Congress has ‘an impressive\narray of powers expressly enumerated in the Constitu-\ntion.’ ” Id., at 45 (quoting L. Henkin, Foreign Affairs and\nthe United States Constitution 63 (2d ed. 1996)). Zivo-\ntofsky suggests that Congress’s authority to enact §214(d)\nderives specifically from its powers over naturalization,\nU. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 4, and foreign commerce, id., §8,\ncl. 3. According to Zivotofsky, Congress has used these\npowers to pass laws regulating the content and issuance of\npassports since 1856. See Brief for Petitioner 52 (citing\nAct of Aug. 18, 1856, §23, 11 Stat. 60).\n   Zivotofsky contends that §214(d) fits squarely within\nthis tradition. He notes that the State Department’s\ndesignated representative stated in her deposition for this\nlitigation that the “place of birth” entry is included only\nas “an element of identification.” App. 76 (Deposition of\nCatherine Barry, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for\nOverseas Citizens Services); see Brief for Petitioner 10.\nMoreover, Zivotofsky argues, the “place of birth” entry\ncannot be taken as a means for recognizing foreign sover-\neigns, because the State Department authorizes recording\nunrecognized territories—such as the Gaza Strip and the\nWest Bank—as places of birth. Brief for Petitioner 43\n(citing 7 Foreign Affairs Manual §1383.5–5, App. 109–\n110).\n   Further, Zivotofsky claims that even if §214(d) does\nimplicate the recognition power, that is not a power the\n                   Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)             11\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nConstitution commits exclusively to the Executive. Zivo-\ntofsky argues that the Secretary is overreading the authority\ngranted to the President in the “receive Ambassadors”\nclause. He observes that in the Federalist Papers, Alexander\nHamilton described the power conferred by this clause as\n“more a matter of dignity than of authority,” and called it “a\ncircumstance, which will be without consequence in the\nadministration of the government.” The Federalist No. 69,\np. 468 (J. Cooke ed. 1961); see Brief for Petitioner 37. Zivo-\ntofsky also points to other clauses in the Constitution, such\nas Congress’s power to declare war, that suggest some con-\ngressional role in recognition. Reply Brief for Petitioner 23\n(citing U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 11). He cites, for example,\nan 1836 message from President Jackson to Congress, ac-\nknowledging that it is unclear who holds the authority to\nrecognize because it is a power “no where expressly dele-\ngated” in the Constitution, and one that is “necessarily\ninvolved in some of the great powers given to Congress.”\nMessage from the President of the United States Upon the\nSubject of the Political, Military, and Civil Condition of\nTexas, H. R. Doc. No. 35, 24th Cong., 2d Sess., 2; see Reply\nBrief for Petitioner 11–12.\n   Zivotofsky argues that language from this Court’s prece-\ndents suggesting the recognition power belongs exclusively\nto the President is inapplicable to his claim, because that\nlanguage appeared in cases where the Court was asked to\nalter recognition policy developed by the Executive in the\nabsence of congressional opposition. See Brief for Petitioner\n44–46; Reply Brief for Petitioner 18–19. Finally, Zivotofsky\ncontends that even if the “receive Ambassadors” clause\nconfers some exclusive recognition power on the President,\nsimply allowing a choice as to the “place of birth” entry on a\npassport does not significantly intrude on that power.\n   Recitation of these arguments—which sound in familiar\nprinciples of constitutional interpretation—is enough to\nestablish that this case does not “turn on standards that defy\n12                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\njudicial application.” Baker, 369 U. S., at 211. Resolution of\nZivotofksy’s claim demands careful examination of the tex-\ntual, structural, and historical evidence put forward by the\nparties regarding the nature of the statute and of the pass-\nport and recognition powers. This is what courts do. The\npolitical question doctrine poses no bar to judicial review of\nthis case.\n                              III\n  To say that Zivotofsky’s claim presents issues the Judi-\nciary is competent to resolve is not to say that reaching a\ndecision in this case is simple. Because the District Court\nand the D. C. Circuit believed that review was barred by\nthe political question doctrine, we are without the benefit\nof thorough lower court opinions to guide our analysis of\nthe merits. Ours is “a court of final review and not first\nview.” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U. S.\n103, 110 (2001) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Ordinarily, “we do not decide in the first in-\nstance issues not decided below.” National Collegiate\nAthletic Assn. v. Smith, 525 U. S. 459, 470 (1999). In\nparticular, when we reverse on a threshold question, we\ntypically remand for resolution of any claims the lower\ncourts’ error prevented them from addressing. See, e.g.,\nBond v. United States, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op.,\nat 1–2) (reversing the Court of Appeals’ determination on\nstanding and remanding because the “merits of petition-\ner’s challenge to the statute’s validity are to be considered,\nin the first instance, by the Court of Appeals”). We see no\nreason to depart from this approach in this case. Having\ndetermined that this case is justiciable, we leave it to the\nlower courts to consider the merits in the first instance.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the D. C.\nCircuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                               It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

I concur in the Court’s conclusion that this\ncase does not present a political question. I write sepa-\nrately, however, because I understand the inquiry re-\nquired by the political question doctrine to be more de-\nmanding than that suggested by the Court.\n                              I\n   The political question doctrine speaks to an amalgam of\ncircumstances in which courts properly examine whether\na particular suit is justiciable—that is, whether the dis-\npute is appropriate for resolution by courts. The doctrine\nis “essentially a function of the separation of powers,”\nBaker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 217 (1962), which recognizes\nthe limits that Article III imposes upon courts and accords\nappropriate respect to the other branches’ exercise of their\nown constitutional powers.\n   In Baker, this Court identified six circumstances in\n2                  ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nwhich an issue might present a political question: (1) “a\ntextually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the\nissue to a coordinate political department”; (2) “a lack of\njudicially discoverable and manageable standards for\nresolving it”; (3) “the impossibility of deciding without an\ninitial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudi-\ncial discretion”; (4) “the impossibility of a court’s undertak-\ning independent resolution without expressing lack of the\nrespect due coordinate branches of government”; (5) “an\nunusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political\ndecision already made”; or (6) “the potentiality of embar-\nrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various\ndepartments on one question.” Id., at 217. Baker estab-\nlished that “[u]nless one of these formulations is inextri-\ncable from the case at bar, there should be no dismissal for\nnonjusticiability.” Ibid. But Baker left unanswered when\nthe presence of one or more factors warrants dismissal,\nas well as the interrelationship of the six factors and the\nrelative importance of each in determining whether a case\nis suitable for adjudication.\n   In my view, the Baker factors reflect three distinct\njustifications for withholding judgment on the merits of a\ndispute. When a case would require a court to decide an\nissue whose resolution is textually committed to a coordi-\nnate political department, as envisioned by Baker’s first\nfactor, abstention is warranted because the court lacks\nauthority to resolve that issue. See, e.g., Nixon v. United\nStates, 506 U. S. 224, 229 (1993) (holding nonjusticiable\nthe Senate’s impeachment procedures in light of Article I’s\ncommitment to the Senate of the “ ‘sole Power to try all\nImpeachments’ ”); see also Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch\n137, 165–166 (1803) (“By the constitution of the United\nStates, the president is invested with certain important\npolitical powers, in the exercise of which he is to use\nhis own discretion, and is accountable only to his country\nin his political character, and to his own conscience”). In\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                    Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nsuch cases, the Constitution itself requires that another\nbranch resolve the question presented.\n  The second and third Baker factors reflect circum-\nstances in which a dispute calls for decisionmaking beyond\ncourts’ competence. “ ‘The judicial Power’ created by Arti-\ncle III, §1, of the Constitution is not whatever judges\nchoose to do,” but rather the power “to act in the manner\ntraditional for English and American courts.” Vieth v.\nJubelirer, 541 U. S. 267, 278 (2004) (plurality opinion).\nThat traditional role involves the application of some\nmanageable and cognizable standard within the compe-\ntence of the Judiciary to ascertain and employ to the facts\nof a concrete case. When a court is given no standard by\nwhich to adjudicate a dispute, or cannot resolve a dispute\nin the absence of a yet-unmade policy determination\ncharged to a political branch, resolution of the suit is be-\nyond the judicial role envisioned by Article III. See, e.g.,\nGilligan v. Morgan, 413 U. S. 1, 10 (1973) (“[I]t is difficult\nto conceive of an area of governmental activity in which\nthe courts have less competence” than “[t]he complex,\nsubtle, and professional decisions as to the composition,\ntraining, equipping, and control of a military force”); Vieth,\n541 U. S., at 278 (“One of the most obvious limitations\nimposed by [Article III] is that judicial action must be\ngoverned by standard . . . ”). This is not to say, of course,\nthat courts are incapable of interpreting or applying\nsomewhat ambiguous standards using familiar tools of\nstatutory or constitutional interpretation. But where an\nissue leaves courts truly rudderless, there can be “no\ndoubt of [the] validity” of a court’s decision to abstain from\njudgment. Ibid.\n  The final three Baker factors address circumstances in\nwhich prudence may counsel against a court’s resolution of\nan issue presented. Courts should be particularly cautious\nbefore forgoing adjudication of a dispute on the basis that\njudicial intervention risks “embarrassment from multifar-\n4                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nious pronouncements by various departments on one\nquestion,” would express a “lack of the respect due coordi-\nnate branches of government,” or because there exists an\n“unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political\ndecision already made.” 369 U. S., at 217. We have re-\npeatedly rejected the view that these thresholds are met\nwhenever a court is called upon to resolve the constitu-\ntionality or propriety of the act of another branch of Gov-\nernment. See, e.g., United States v. Munoz-Flores, 495\nU. S. 385, 390–391 (1990); Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S.\n486, 548, 549 (1969). A court may not refuse to adjudicate\na dispute merely because a decision “may have significant\npolitical overtones” or affect “the conduct of this Nation’s\nforeign relations,” Japan Whaling Assn. v. American\nCetacean Soc., 478 U. S. 221, 230 (1986). Nor may courts\ndecline to resolve a controversy within their traditional\ncompetence and proper jurisdiction simply because the\nquestion is difficult, the consequences weighty, or the\npotential real for conflict with the policy preferences of\nthe political branches. The exercise of such authority is\namong the “gravest and most delicate dut[ies] that this\nCourt is called on to perform,” Blodgett v. Holden, 275\nU. S. 142, 148 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurring), but it is\nthe role assigned to courts by the Constitution. “Questions\nmay occur which we would gladly avoid; but we cannot\navoid them. All we can do is, to exercise our best judg-\nment, and conscientiously to perform our duty.” Cohens v.\nVirginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404 (1821).\n   Rare occasions implicating Baker’s final factors, how-\never, may present an “ ‘unusual case’ ” unfit for judicial\ndisposition. 369 U. S., at 218 (quoting the argument of\nDaniel Webster in Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, 29 (1849)).\nBecause of the respect due to a coequal and independent\ndepartment, for instance, courts properly resist calls to\nquestion the good faith with which another branch attests\nto the authenticity of its internal acts. See, e.g., Field v.\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                    5\n\n                       Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nClark, 143 U. S. 649, 672–673 (1892) (deeming “forbidden\nby the respect due to a coordinate branch of the govern-\nment” “[j]udicial action” requiring a belief in a “deliberate\nconspiracy” by the Senate and House of Representatives\n“to defeat an expression of the popular will”); see also\nMunoz-Flores, 495 U. S., at 409–410 (SCALIA, J., concur-\nring in judgment) (“Mutual regard between the coordinate\nbranches, and the interest of certainty, both demand that\nofficial representations regarding . . . matters of internal\nprocess be accepted at face value”). Likewise, we have\nlong acknowledged that courts are particularly ill suited\nto intervening in exigent disputes necessitating unusual\nneed for “attributing finality to the action of the political\ndepartments,” Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433, 454\n(1939), or creating acute “risk [of] embarrassment of our\ngovernment abroad, or grave disturbance at home,” Baker,\n369 U. S., at 226. See, e.g., Luther, 7 How., at 43 (“After\nthe President has acted and called out the militia, is a\nCircuit Court of the United States authorized to inquire\nwhether his decision was right? . . . If the judicial power\nextends so far, the guarantee contained in the Constitu-\ntion of the United States is a guarantee of anarchy, and\nnot of order”).1 Finally, it may be appropriate for courts to\nstay their hand in cases implicating delicate questions\nconcerning the distribution of political authority between\ncoordinate branches until a dispute is ripe, intractable,\nand incapable of resolution by the political process. See\n\n——————\n   1 See also Martin v. Mott, 12 Wheat. 19, 29–30 (1827) (Story, J.) (de-\n\nclining to review the President’s determination that an “exigency has\narisen,” necessitating the “call [of] the militia into actual service,”\nrecognizing need for “[a] prompt and unhesitating obedience to orders is\nindispensable”); Ware v. Hylton, 3 Dall. 199, 260 (1796) (Iredell, J.,\nconcurring) (to declare treaty with Great Britain void would turn on\n“considerations of policy, considerations of extreme magnitude, [which\nare] certainly entirely incompetent to the examination and decision of a\nCourt of Justice”).\n6                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nGoldwater v. Carter, 444 U. S. 996, 997 (1979) (Powell, J.,\nconcurring in judgment). Abstention merely reflects that\njudicial intervention in such cases is “legitimate only in\nthe last resort,” Chicago & Grand Trunk R. Co. v. Well-\nman, 143 U. S. 339, 345 (1892), and is disfavored relative\nto the prospect of accommodation between the political\nbranches.\n   When such unusual cases arise, abstention accommo-\ndates considerations inherent in the separation of powers\nand the limitations envisioned by Article III, which con-\nferred authority to federal courts against a common-law\nbackdrop that recognized the propriety of abstention in\nexceptional cases. New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v.\nCouncil of City of New Orleans, 491 U. S. 350, 359 (1989);\nsee generally Shapiro, Jurisdiction and Discretion, 60\nN. Y. U. L. Rev. 543 (1985) (hereinafter Shapiro). The\npolitical questions envisioned by Baker’s final categories\nfind common ground, therefore, with many longstanding\ndoctrines under which considerations of justiciability or\ncomity lead courts to abstain from deciding questions\nwhose initial resolution is better suited to another time,\nsee, e.g., National Park Hospitality Assn. v. Department of\nInterior, 538 U. S. 803, 808 (2003) (ripeness); United\nStates Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U. S. 388, 397\n(1980) (mootness); or another forum, see, e.g., Gulf Oil\nCorp. v. Gilbert, 330 U. S. 501, 507 (1947) (forum non\nconveniens); Railroad Comm’n of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312\nU. S. 496, 498–500 (1941); Louisiana Power & Light Co. v.\nCity of Thibodaux, 360 U.

In two respects, however, my understanding of the\npolitical question doctrine might require a court to engage\nin further analysis beyond that relied upon by the Court.\n  First, the Court appropriately recognizes that petition-\ner’s claim to a statutory right is “relevant” to the justicia-\nbility inquiry required in this case. Ante, at 6. In order to\nevaluate whether a case presents a political question, a\ncourt must first identify with precision the issue it is being\n——————\n    2 Often when such factors are implicated in a case presenting a politi-\n\ncal question, other factors identified in Baker will likewise be apparent.\nSee, e.g., Nixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224, 236 (1993) (“[i]n addi-\ntion to the textual commitment argument,” finding persuasive that\n“opening the door of judicial review” of impeachment procedures would\n“ ‘expose the political life of the country to months, or perhaps years, of\nchaos’ ”); Baker, 369 U. S., at 222 (explaining that the Court in Luther\nv. Borden, 7 How. 1 (1849), found present features associated with each\nof the three rationales underlying Baker’s factors).\n8                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nasked to decide. Here, petitioner’s suit claims that a\nfederal statute provides him with a right to have “Israel”\nlisted as his place of birth on his passport and other re-\nlated documents. App. 15–18. To decide that question, a\ncourt must determine whether the statute is constitu-\ntional, and therefore mandates the Secretary of State to\nissue petitioner’s desired passport, or unconstitutional, in\nwhich case his suit is at an end. Resolution of that issue is\nnot one “textually committed” to another branch; to the\ncontrary, it is committed to this one. In no fashion does the\nquestion require a court to review the wisdom of the Pres-\nident’s policy toward Jerusalem or any other decision\ncommitted to the discretion of a coordinate department.\nFor that reason, I agree that the decision below should be\nreversed.\n   That is not to say, however, that no statute could give\nrise to a political question. It is not impossible to imagine\na case involving the application or even the constitutional-\nity of an enactment that would present a nonjusticiable\nissue. Indeed, this Court refused to determine whether an\nOhio state constitutional provision offended the Repub-\nlican Guarantee Clause, Art. IV, §4, holding that “the\nquestion of whether that guarantee of the Constitution\nhas been disregarded presents no justiciable controversy.”\nOhio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, 241 U. S. 565, 569 (1916).\nA similar result would follow if Congress passed a statute,\nfor instance, purporting to award financial relief to those\nimproperly “tried” of impeachment offenses. To adjudicate\nclaims under such a statute would require a court to re-\nsolve the very same issue we found nonjusticiable in\nNixon. Such examples are atypical, but they suffice to show\nthat the foreclosure altogether of political question analy-\nsis in statutory cases is unwarranted.\n   Second, the Court suggests that this case does not im-\nplicate the political question doctrine’s concern with issues\nexhibiting “ ‘a lack of judicially discoverable and managea-\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

But that was equally\ntrue in Nixon, a case in which we found that “the use of\nthe word ‘try’ in the first sentence of the Impeachment\nTrial Clause lacks sufficient precision to afford any judi-\ncially manageable standard of review of the Senate’s\nactions.” 506 U. S., at 230. We reached that conclusion\neven though the parties’ briefs focused upon the text of the\nImpeachment Trial Clause, “the Constitution’s drafting\nhistory,” “contemporaneous commentary,” “the unbroken\npractice of the Senate for 150 years,” contemporary dic-\ntionary meanings, “Hamilton’s Federalist essays,” and the\npractice in the House of Lords prior to ratification. Such\nevidence was no more or less unfamiliar to courts than\nthat on which the parties rely here.\n   In my view, it is not whether the evidence upon which\nlitigants rely is common to judicial consideration that\ndetermines whether a case lacks judicially discoverable\nand manageable standards. Rather, it is whether that\nevidence in fact provides a court a basis to adjudicate\nmeaningfully the issue with which it is presented. The\nanswer will almost always be yes, but if the parties’ tex-\ntual, structural, and historical evidence is inapposite or\nwholly unilluminating, rendering judicial decision no more\nthan guesswork, a case relying on the ordinary kinds of\narguments offered to courts might well still present justi-\nciability concerns.\n   In this case, however, the Court of Appeals majority\nfound a political question solely on the basis that this case\nrequired resolution of an issue “textually committed” to\nthe Executive Branch. Because there was no such textual\ncommitment, I respectfully concur in the Court’s decision\nto reverse the Court of Appeals.\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

This case\ndoes not require the Judiciary to decide whether the power\nto recognize foreign governments and the extent of their\nterritory is conferred exclusively on the President or is\nshared with Congress. Petitioner does not claim that the\nstatutory provision in question represents an attempt by\nCongress to dictate United States policy regarding the\nstatus of Jerusalem. Instead, petitioner contends in effect\nthat Congress has the power to mandate that an American\ncitizen born abroad be given the option of including in his\npassport and Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA)\nwhat amounts to a statement of personal belief on the\nstatus of Jerusalem.\n   Powers conferred on Congress by the Constitution cer-\ntainly give Congress a measure of authority to prescribe\nthe contents of passports and CRBAs. The Constitution\ngives Congress the power to regulate foreign commerce,\nArt. I, §8, cl. 3, and this power includes the power to regu-\nlate the entry of persons into this country, see Henderson\n2                  ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nv. Mayor of New York, 92 U. S. 259, 270–271 (1876). The\nConstitution also gives Congress the power to make a\n“uniform Rule of Naturalization,” Art. I, §8, cl. 4, and\npursuant to this power, Congress has enacted laws con-\ncerning the citizenship of children born abroad to parents\nwho are citizens of this country, see United States v. Wong\nKim Ark, 169 U. S. 649, 688 (1898). These powers allow\nCongress to mandate that identifying information be in-\ncluded in passports and CRBAs.\n   The President also has a measure of authority concern-\ning the contents of passports and CRBAs. The President\nhas broad authority in the field of foreign affairs, see, e.g.,\nAmerican Ins. Assn. v. Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 414\n(2003), and, historically, that authority has included the\npower to issue passports, even in the absence of any for-\nmal congressional conferral of authority to do so. See\nHaig v. Agee, 453 U. S. 280, 293 (1981) (explaining that\n“[p]rior to 1856, when there was no statute on the subject,\nthe common perception was that the issuance of a pass-\nport was committed to the sole discretion of the Executive\nand that the Executive would exercise this power in the\ninterests of the national security and foreign policy of the\nUnited States”). We have described a passport as “a letter\nof introduction in which the issuing sovereign vouches for\nthe bearer and requests other sovereigns to aid the bear-\ner.” Id., at 292. This is apparent from the first page of\npetitioner’s passport, which reads as follows:\n    “The Secretary of State of the United States of Amer-\n    ica hereby requests all whom it may concern to permit\n    the citizen / national of the United States named here-\n    in to pass without delay or hindrance and in case of\n    need to give all lawful aid and protection.” App. 19.\nSimilarly, a CRBA is a certification made by a consular of-\nficial that the bearer acquired United States citizenship\nat birth.

As she\npoints out, Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186 (1962), set forth\nseveral categories of legal questions that the Court had\npreviously held to be “political questions” inappropriate for\njudicial determination. Those categories include (1) in-\nstances in which the Constitution clearly commits deci-\nsionmaking power to another branch of Government, and\n(2) issues lacking judicially manageable standards for\nresolution. Id., at 217. They also include (3) issues that\ncourts cannot decide without making “an initial policy\ndetermination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion,”\n(4) issues that a court cannot independently decide “with-\nout expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches\nof government,” (5) cases in which there is “an unusual\nneed for unquestioning adherence to a political decision\nalready made,” and (6) cases in which there is a potential\nfor “embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by\nvarious departments on one question.” Ibid.\n  As JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR also points out, these categories\n(and in my view particularly the last four) embody “cir-\ncumstances in which prudence may counsel against a\n2                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncourt’s resolution of an issue presented.” Ante, at 3 (opin-\nion concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see\nNixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224, 253 (1993) (Souter,\nJ., concurring in judgment) (the political-question doctrine\n“deriv[es] in large part from prudential concerns about the\nrespect we owe the political departments”); Goldwater v.\nCarter, 444 U. S. 996, 1000 (1979) (Powell, J., concurring\nin judgment) (“[T]he political-question doctrine rests in\npart on prudential concerns calling for mutual respect\namong the three branches of Government”); see also Jaffe,\nStanding to Secure Judicial Review: Public Actions, 74\nHarv. L. Rev. 1265, 1304 (1961) (prudence counsels hesita-\ntion where a legal issue is “felt to be so closely related to\na complex of decisions not within the court’s jurisdiction\nthat its resolution by the court would either be poor in\nitself or would jeopardize sound decisions in the larger\ncomplex”).\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR adds that the circumstances in\nwhich these prudential considerations lead the Court not\nto decide a case otherwise properly before it are rare.\nAnte, at 7. I agree. But in my view we nonetheless have\nbefore us such a case. Four sets of prudential considera-\ntions, taken together, lead me to that conclusion.\n   First, the issue before us arises in the field of foreign\naffairs. (Indeed, the statutory provision before us is a\nsubsection of a section that concerns the relation between\nJerusalem and the State of Israel. See §214 of the Foreign\nRelations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003, 116 Stat.\n1365 (“United States Policy with Respect to Jerusalem as\nthe Capital of Israel”).) The Constitution primarily dele-\ngates the foreign affairs powers “to the political depart-\nments of the government, Executive and Legislative,” not\nto the Judiciary. Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v.\nWaterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 111 (1948); see also\nMarbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 166 (1803) (noting\ndiscretionary foreign affairs functions of Secretary of State\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nas beyond the power of the Judiciary to review). And that\nfact is not surprising. Decisionmaking in this area typical-\nly is highly political. It is “delicate” and “complex.” Chi-\ncago & Southern Air Lines, 333 U. S., at 111. It often\nrests upon information readily available to the Executive\nBranch and to the intelligence committees of Congress,\nbut not readily available to the courts. Ibid. It frequently\nis highly dependent upon what Justice Jackson called\n“prophecy.” Ibid. And the creation of wise foreign policy\ntypically lies well beyond the experience or professional\ncapacity of a judge. Ibid. At the same time, where foreign\naffairs is at issue, the practical need for the United States\nto speak “with one voice and ac[t] as one,” is particularly\nimportant. See United States v. Pink, 315 U. S. 203, 242\n(1942) (Frankfurter, J., concurring); see also R. Fallon,\nJ. Manning, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and\nWechsler’s The Federal Courts and the Federal System\n240 (6th ed. 2009).\n   The result is a judicial hesitancy to make decisions that\nhave significant foreign policy implications, as reflected in\nthe fact that many of the cases in which the Court has in-\nvoked the political-question doctrine have arisen in this\narea, e.g., cases in which the validity of a treaty depended\nupon the partner state’s constitutional authority, Doe v.\nBraden, 16 How. 635, 657 (1854), or upon its continuing\nexistence, Terlinden v. Ames, 184 U. S. 270, 285 (1902);\ncases concerning the existence of foreign states, govern-\nments, belligerents, and insurgents, Oetjen v. Central\nLeather Co., 246 U. S. 297, 302 (1918); United States v.\nKlintock, 5 Wheat. 144, 149 (1820); United States v. Pal-\nmer, 3 Wheat. 610, 634–635 (1818); and cases concerning\nthe territorial boundaries of foreign states, Williams v.\nSuffolk Ins. Co., 13 Pet. 415, 420 (1839); Foster v. Neilson,\n2 Pet. 253, 307 (1829). See Baker, supra, at 186, 211–213\n(citing these cases as the Court’s principal foreign-\nrelations political-question cases); see also Fallon, supra,\n4                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nat 243–247.\n   Second, if the courts must answer the constitutional\nquestion before us, they may well have to evaluate the\nforeign policy implications of foreign policy decisions. The\nconstitutional question focuses upon a statutory provision,\n§214(d), that says: The Secretary of State, upon the re-\nquest of a U. S. citizen born in Jerusalem (or upon the\nrequest of the citizen’s legal guardian), shall “record” in\nthe citizen’s passport or consular birth report “the place\nof birth as Israel.” 116 Stat. 1366. And the question is\nwhether this statute unconstitutionally seeks to limit the\nPresident’s inherent constitutional authority to make cer-\ntain kinds of foreign policy decisions. See American Ins.\nAssn. v. Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 414–415 (2003)\n(citing cases); Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U. S. 417,\n445 (1998) (“[T]his Court has recognized that in the for-\neign affairs arena, the President has ‘a degree of discretion\nand freedom from statutory restriction which would not be\nadmissible were domestic affairs alone involved’ ” (quoting\nUnited States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S.\n304, 320 (1936))); cf. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co.\nv. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 637–638 (1952) (Jackson, J.,\nconcurring).\n   The Secretary of State argues that the President’s con-\nstitutional authority to determine foreign policy includes\nthe power to recognize foreign governments, that this\nCourt has long recognized that the latter power belongs\nto the President exclusively, that the power includes the\npower to determine claims over disputed territory as well\nas the policy governing recognition decisions, and that the\nstatute unconstitutionally limits the President’s exclusive\nauthority to exercise these powers. See U. S. Const., Art.\nII, §2, cl. 2; Art. II, §3; e.g., Kennett v. Chambers, 14 How.\n38, 50–51 (1852) (recognition); Williams, supra, at 420\n(disputed territory); Pink, supra, at 229 (recognition poli-\ncy); see also Haig v. Agee, 453 U. S. 280, 293 (1981) (execu-\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntive passport authority).\n   Zivotofsky, supported by several Members of Congress,\npoints out that the Constitution also grants Congress\npowers related to foreign affairs, such as the powers to\ndeclare war, to regulate foreign commerce, and to regulate\nnaturalization. See Art. I, §8, cls. 3, 4, 11; see also Ameri-\ncan Ins. Assn., supra, at 414. They add that Congress may\nshare some of the recognition power and its attendant\npower of determining claims over disputed territory. E.g.,\nPalmer, supra, at 634 (recognition); Jones v. United States,\n137 U. S. 202, 212 (1890) (disputed territory). And they\nadd that Congress may enact laws concerning travel into\nthis country and concerning the citizenship of children\nborn abroad to U. S. citizens. See Henderson v. Mayor of\nNew York, 92 U. S. 259, 270–271 (1876) (travel); Fong Yue\nTing v. United States, 149 U. S. 698, 714 (1893) (immigra-\ntion); United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U. S. 649, 688\n(1898) (citizenship). They argue that these powers include\nthe power to specify the content of a passport (or consular\nbirth report). And when such a specification takes the\nform of statutory law, they say, the Constitution requires\nthe President (through the Secretary of State) to execute\nthat statute. See Art. II, §3.\n   Were the statutory provision undisputedly concerned\nonly with purely administrative matters (or were its en-\nforcement undisputedly to involve only major foreign\npolicy matters), judicial efforts to answer the constitu-\ntional question might not involve judges in trying to an-\nswer questions of foreign policy. But in the Middle East,\nadministrative matters can have implications that extend\nfar beyond the purely administrative. Political reactions\nin that region can prove uncertain. And in that context it\nmay well turn out that resolution of the constitutional\nargument will require a court to decide how far the stat-\nute, in practice, reaches beyond the purely administrative,\ndetermining not only whether but also the extent to\n6                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwhich enforcement will interfere with the President’s\nability to make significant recognition-related foreign\npolicy decisions.\n   Certainly the parties argue as if that were so. Zivo-\ntofsky, for example, argues that replacing “Jerusalem” on\nhis passport with “Israel” will have no serious foreign\npolicy significance. See Brief for Petitioner 43, 46–52;\nReply Brief for Petitioner 25–26. And in support he points\nto (1) a State Department official’s statement that birth-\nplace designation serves primarily as “an element of iden-\ntification,” while omitting mention of recognition; (2) the\nfact that the State Department has recorded births in\nunrecognized territories in the region, such as the Gaza\nStrip and the West Bank, apparently without adverse\neffect; and (3) the fact that sometimes Jerusalem does\n(because of what the Government calls “clerical errors”)\ncarry with it the name of “Israel” on certain official docu-\nments, again apparently without seriously adverse effect.\nSee Brief for Petitioner 7–10, 15, 43, 50; App. 50, 58–60,\n75–76. Moreover, Zivotofsky says, it is unfair to allow the\n100,000 or so Americans born in cities that the United\nStates recognizes as under Israeli sovereignty, such as Tel\nAviv or Haifa, the right to a record that mentions Israel,\nwhile denying that privilege to the 50,000 or so Americans\nborn in Jerusalem. See Brief for Petitioner 18–20, 48–49;\nApp. 48.\n   At the same time, the Secretary argues that listing\nIsrael on the passports (and consular birth reports) of\nAmericans born in Jerusalem will have significantly ad-\nverse foreign policy effects. See Brief for Respondent 8,\n37–41. She says that doing so would represent “ ‘an offi-\ncial decision by the United States to begin to treat Jerusa-\nlem as a city located within Israel,’ ” id., at 38–39, that it\n“would be interpreted as an official act of recognizing\nJerusalem as being under Israeli sovereignty,” App. 56,\nand that our “national security interests” consequently\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)             7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n“would be significantly harmed,” id., at 49. Such an ac-\ntion, she says, “ ‘would signal, symbolically or concretely,\nthat’ ” the United States “ ‘recognizes that Jerusalem is a\ncity that is located within the sovereign territory of Is-\nrael,’” and doing so, “‘would critically compromise the ability\nof the United States to work with Israelis, Palestinians\nand others in the region to further the peace process.’ ”\nBrief for Respondent 2; App. 52–53. She adds that the\nvery enactment of this statutory provision in 2002 pro-\nduced headlines in the Middle East stating the “the U. S.\nnow recognizes Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.” Id., at 231;\nBrief for Respondent 10; see also App. 53–55, 227–231.\n   A judge’s ability to evaluate opposing claims of this kind\nis minimal. At the same time, a judicial effort to do so\nrisks inadvertently jeopardizing sound foreign policy\ndecisionmaking by the other branches of Government.\nHow, for example, is this Court to determine whether, or\nthe extent to which, the continuation of the adjudication\nthat it now orders will itself have a foreign policy effect?\n   Third, the countervailing interests in obtaining judicial\nresolution of the constitutional determination are not\nparticularly strong ones. Zivotofsky does not assert the\nkind of interest, e.g., an interest in property or bodily\nintegrity, which courts have traditionally sought to pro-\ntect. See, e.g., Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651, 673–\n674 (1977) (enduring commitment to legal protection of\nbodily integrity). Nor, importantly, does he assert an\ninterest in vindicating a basic right of the kind that the\nConstitution grants to individuals and that courts tradi-\ntionally have protected from invasion by the other branches\nof Government. And I emphasize this fact because the\nneed for judicial action in such cases can trump the foreign\npolicy concerns that I have mentioned. As Professor Jaffe\npointed out many years ago, “Our courts would not refuse\nto entertain habeas corpus to test the constitutionality of\nthe imprisonment of an alleged Chinese agent even if it\n8                 ZIVOTOFSKY v. CLINTON\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwere clear that his imprisonment was closely bound up\nwith our relations to the Chinese government.” 74 Harv.\nL. Rev., at 1304; see also T. Franck, Political Questions/\nJudicial Answers 63–64 (1992); cf. Boumediene v. Bush,\n553 U. S. 723, 755 (2008).\n  The interest that Zivotofsky asserts, however, is akin to\nan ideological interest. See Brief for Petitioner 54 (citizen\nborn in Jerusalem, unlike citizen born in Tel Aviv or\nHaifa, does not have the “option” to “specify or suppress the\nname of a country that accords with his or her ideology”);\nsee also id., at 19 (State Department policy bars citizens\nborn in Jerusalem “from identifying their birthplace in a\nmanner that conforms with their convictions”). And inso-\nfar as an individual suffers an injury that is purely ideo-\nlogical, courts have often refused to consider the matter,\nleaving the injured party to look to the political branches\nfor protection. E.g., Diamond v. Charles, 476 U. S. 54, 66–\n67 (1986); Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727, 739–740\n(1972). This is not to say that Zivotofsky’s claim is unim-\nportant or that the injury is not serious or even that it is\npurely ideological. It is to point out that those suffering\nsomewhat similar harms have sometimes had to look to\nthe political branches for resolution of relevant legal is-\nsues. Cf. United States v. Richardson, 418 U. S. 166, 179\n(1974); Laird v. Tatum, 408 U. S. 1, 15 (1972).\n  Fourth, insofar as the controversy reflects different\nforeign policy views among the political branches of Gov-\nernment, those branches have nonjudicial methods of\nworking out their differences. Cf. Goldwater, 444 U. S., at\n1002, 1004 (Rehnquist, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and\nStewart and Stevens, JJ., concurring in judgment) (finding\nin similar fact strong reason for Judiciary not to decide\ntreaty power question). The Executive and Legislative\nBranches frequently work out disagreements through\nongoing contacts and relationships, involving, for example,\nbudget authorizations, confirmation of personnel, commit-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntee hearings, and a host of more informal contacts, which,\ntaken together, ensure that, in practice, Members of Con-\ngress as well as the President play an important role in\nthe shaping of foreign policy. Indeed, both the Legislative\nBranch and the Executive Branch typically understand\nthe need to work each with the other in order to create\neffective foreign policy. In that understanding, those\nrelated contacts, and the continuous foreign policy-related\nrelationship lies the possibility of working out the kind of\ndisagreement we see before us. Moreover, if application of\nthe political-question “doctrine ultimately turns, as\nLearned Hand put it, on ‘how importunately the occasion\ndemands an answer,’ ” Nixon, 506 U. S., at 253 (Souter, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (quoting L. Hand, The Bill of\nRights 15 (1958)), the ability of the political branches to\nwork out their differences minimizes the need for judicial\nintervention here.\n   The upshot is that this case is unusual both in its mini-\nmal need for judicial intervention and in its more serious\nrisk that intervention will bring about “embarrassment,”\nshow lack of “respect” for the other branches, and poten-\ntially disrupt sound foreign policy decisionmaking. For\nthese prudential reasons, I would hold that the political-\nquestion doctrine bars further judicial consideration of\nthis case. And I would affirm the Court of Appeals’ simi-\nlar conclusion.\n   With respect, I dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/626209/", "sha1": "60c885dc6af8b37f33bbc26a0954f859512476cc", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2012-03-28T07:21:19"}
