PAULK\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 10–788.      Argued November 1, 2011—Decided April 2, 2012\nRespondent, the chief investigator for a district attorney’s office, testi-\n  fied at grand jury proceedings that resulted in petitioner’s indict-\n  ment. After the indictments were dismissed, petitioner brought an\n  action under 42 U. S. C. §1983, alleging that respondent had con-\n  spired to present and did present false testimony to the grand jury.\n  The Federal District Court denied respondent’s motion to dismiss on\n  immunity grounds, but the Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding that\n  respondent had absolute immunity from a §1983 claim based on his\n  grand jury testimony.\nHeld: A witness in a grand jury proceeding is entitled to the same abso-\n lute immunity from suit under §1983 as a witness who testifies at\n trial. Pp. 3–18.\n    (a) Section 1983, which derives from §1 of the Civil Rights Act of\n 1871, was not meant to effect a radical departure from ordinary tort\n law and the common-law immunities applicable in tort suits. See,\n e.g., Burns v. Reed, 500 U. S. 478, 484. This interpretation of §1983\n has been reaffirmed by the Court time and again. Thus, the Court\n looks to the common law for guidance in determining the scope of the\n immunities available in actions brought under §1983. See Kalina v.\n Fletcher, 522 U. S. 118, 123. Taking a “functional approach,” see,\n e.g., Forrester v. White, 484 U. S. 219, 224, the Court identifies those\n governmental functions that were historically viewed as so important\n and vulnerable to interference by means of litigation that some form\n of absolute immunity from civil liability was needed to ensure that\n they are “ ‘performed with independence and without fear of conse-\n quences,’ ” Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547, 554.\n    The Court’s functional approach is tied to the common law’s identi-\n fication of functions meriting the protection of absolute immunity,\n2                           REHBERG v. PAULK\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    but the Court’s precedents have not mechanically duplicated the pre-\n    cise scope of the absolute immunity the common law provided to pro-\n    tect those functions. For example, it was common in 1871 for cases to\n    be prosecuted by private parties, who did not enjoy absolute immuni-\n    ty from suit. But as the prosecutorial function was increasingly as-\n    sumed by public officials, common-law courts held that public prose-\n    cutors, unlike their private predecessors, were absolutely immune\n    from the types of tort claims that an aggrieved or vengeful criminal\n    defendant was most likely to assert. This adaptation of prosecutorial\n    immunity accommodated the special needs of public, as opposed to\n    private, prosecutors. Thus, when the issue of prosecutorial immunity\n    under §1983 reached this Court in Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S.\n    409, the Court did not simply apply the scope of immunity recognized\n    by common-law courts as of 1871 but instead relied substantially on\n    post-1871 cases extending broad immunity to public prosecutors sued\n    for common-law torts. Neither has the Court suggested that §1983 is\n    simply a federalized amalgamation of pre-existing common-law\n    claims. The new federal claim created by §1983 differs in important\n    ways from pre-existing common-law torts. Accordingly, both the\n    scope of the new tort and the scope of the absolute immunity availa-\n    ble in §1983 actions differ in some respects from the common law.\n    Pp. 3―9.\n       (b) A trial witness sued under §1983 enjoys absolute immunity\n    from any claim based on his testimony. Briscoe v. LaHue, 460 U. S.\n    352. Without absolute immunity, the truth-seeking process would be\n    impaired as witnesses might be reluctant to testify, and even a wit-\n    ness who took the stand “might be inclined to shade his testimony in\n    favor of the potential plaintiff ” for “fear of subsequent liability.” Id.,\n    at 333. These factors apply with equal force to grand jury witnesses.\n    In both contexts, a witness’ fear of retaliatory litigation may deprive\n    the tribunal of critical evidence. And in neither context is the deter-\n    rent of potential civil liability needed to prevent false testimony be-\n    cause other sanctions, chiefly prosecution for perjury, provide a suffi-\n    cient deterrent.\n       For the reasons identified in Briscoe, supra, at 342–344, there is no\n    reason to distinguish law enforcement witnesses from lay witnesses\n    in §1983 actions. And the rule that a grand jury witness has absolute\n    immunity from any §1983 claim based on the witness’ testimony may\n    not be circumvented by claiming that a grand jury witness conspired\n    to present false testimony, or by using evidence of the witness’ testi-\n    mony to support any other §1983 claim concerning the initiation or\n    maintenance of a prosecution. Were it otherwise, a criminal defend-\n    ant turned civil plaintiff could reframe a claim to attack the prepara-\n    tory activity—such as a preliminary discussion in which the witness\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  relates the substance of his intended testimony—rather than the ab-\n  solutely immune actions themselves. Pp. 9−12.\n     (c) Petitioner’s main argument is that under Malley v. Briggs, 475\n  U. S. 335, 340−341, and Kalina v. Fletcher, 522 U. S. 118, 131, grand\n  jury witnesses who are “complaining witnesses” are not entitled to\n  absolute immunity. But at the time §1983’s predecessor was enacted,\n  a “complaining witness” was a party who procured an arrest and ini-\n  tiated a criminal prosecution. A “complaining witness” might testify,\n  either before a grand jury or at trial, but testifying was not a neces-\n  sary characteristic of a “complaining witness.” Thus, testifying,\n  whether before a grand jury or at trial, was not the distinctive func-\n  tion performed by a “complaining witness.” A “complaining witness”\n  cannot be held liable for perjurious trial testimony, see Briscoe, 460\n  U. S., at 326, and there is no more reason why a “complaining wit-\n  ness” should be subject to liability for testimony before a grand jury.\n     Once the distinctive function performed by a “complaining witness”\n  is understood, it is apparent that a law enforcement officer who testi-\n  fies before a grand jury is not comparable to a “complaining witness”\n  because it is not the officer who makes the critical decision to press\n  criminal charges, but the prosecutor. It would be anomalous to per-\n  mit a police officer testifying before a grand jury to be sued for mali-\n  ciously procuring an unjust prosecution when it is the prosecutor,\n  who is shielded by absolute immunity, who is actually responsible for\n  the decision to initiate a prosecution. Petitioner also contends that\n  the deterrent effect of civil liability is more needed in grand jury pro-\n  ceedings because trial witnesses face cross-examination. But the\n  force of that argument is more than offset by the problem that allow-\n  ing such civil actions would create—subversion of grand jury secrecy,\n  which is essential to the proper functioning of the grand jury system.\n  See United States v. Sells Engineering, Inc., 463 U. S. 418, 424. And\n  finally, contrary to petitioner’s suggestion, recognizing absolute im-\n  munity for grand jury witnesses does not create an insupportable dis-\n  tinction between States that use grand juries and States that permit\n  felony prosecutions to be brought by complaint or information. Most\n  States that do not require an indictment for felonies provide a prelim-\n  inary hearing at which witnesses testify, and the lower courts have\n  held that preliminary hearing witnesses are protected by the same\n  immunity accorded grand jury witnesses.

REHBERG, PETITIONER v. JAMES\n                  P. PAULK\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [April 2, 2012]\n\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case requires us to decide whether a “complaining\nwitness” in a grand jury proceeding is entitled to the\nsame immunity in an action under 42 U. S. C. §1983 as a\nwitness who testifies at trial. We see no sound reason\nto draw a distinction for this purpose between grand jury\nand trial witnesses.\n                              I\n   Petitioner Charles Rehberg, a certified public account-\nant, sent anonymous faxes to several recipients, including\nthe management of a hospital in Albany, Georgia, criticiz-\ning the hospital’s management and activities. In response,\nthe local district attorney’s office, with the assistance of\nits chief investigator, respondent James Paulk, launched a\ncriminal investigation of petitioner, allegedly as a favor to\nthe hospital’s leadership.\n   Respondent testified before a grand jury, and petitioner\nwas then indicted for aggravated assault, burglary, and\nsix counts of making harassing telephone calls. The in-\ndictment charged that petitioner had assaulted a hospital\nphysician, Dr. James Hotz, after unlawfully entering the\n2                   REHBERG v. PAULK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndoctor’s home. Petitioner challenged the sufficiency of the\nindictment, and it was dismissed.\n   A few months later, respondent returned to the grand\njury, and petitioner was indicted again, this time for as-\nsaulting Dr. Hotz on August 22, 2004, and for making\nharassing phone calls. On this occasion, both the doctor\nand respondent testified. Petitioner challenged the suf-\nficiency of this second indictment, claiming that he was\n“nowhere near Dr. Hotz” on the date in question and that\n“[t]here was no evidence whatsoever that [he] committed\nan assault on anybody.” 611 F. 3d 828, 836 (CA11 2010).\nAgain, the indictment was dismissed.\n   While the second indictment was still pending, respond-\nent appeared before a grand jury for a third time, and yet\nanother indictment was returned. Petitioner was charged\nwith assault and making harassing phone calls. This final\nindictment was ultimately dismissed as well.\n   Petitioner then brought this action against respondent\nunder Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983. Petitioner\nalleged that respondent conspired to present and did\npresent false testimony to the grand jury. Respondent\nmoved to dismiss, arguing, among other things, that he\nwas entitled to absolute immunity for his grand jury\ntestimony. The United States District Court for the Mid-\ndle District of Georgia denied respondent’s motion to\ndismiss, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding, in\naccordance with Circuit precedent, that respondent was\nabsolutely immune from a §1983 claim based on his grand\njury testimony.\n   The Court of Appeals noted petitioner’s allegation that\nrespondent was the sole “complaining witness” before the\ngrand jury, but the Court of Appeals declined to recognize\na “complaining witness” exception to its precedent on\ngrand jury witness immunity. See 611 F. 3d, at 839–840.\n“[A]llowing civil suits for false grand jury testimony,” the\ncourt reasoned, “would . . . emasculate the confidential\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnature of grand jury testimony, and eviscerate the tradi-\ntional absolute immunity for witness testimony in judi-\ncial proceedings.” Id., at 840. The court went on to hold\nthat respondent was entitled to absolute immunity, not only\nwith respect to claims based directly on his grand jury\ntestimony, but also with respect to the claim that he con-\nspired to present such testimony. Id., at 841. To allow\nliability to be predicated on the alleged conspiracy, the\ncourt concluded, “ ‘would be to permit through the back\ndoor what is prohibited through the front.’ ” Ibid. (quoting\nJones v. Cannon, 174 F. 3d 1271, 1289 (CA11 1999)).\n   We granted certiorari to resolve a Circuit conflict re-\ngarding the immunity of a “complaining witness” in a\ngrand jury proceeding, 562 U. S. ___ (2011), and we now\naffirm.\n                              II\n  Section 1983, which derives from §1 of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1871, 17 Stat. 13, creates a private right of action\nto vindicate violations of “rights, privileges, or immunities\nsecured by the Constitution and laws” of the United\nStates. Under the terms of the statute, “ ‘[e]very person’\nwho acts under color of state law to deprive another of a\nconstitutional right [is] answerable to that person in a suit\nfor damages.” Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 417\n(1976) (citing 42 U. S. C. §1983).\n                            A\n  Despite the broad terms of §1983, this Court has long\nrecognized that the statute was not meant to effect a\nradical departure from ordinary tort law and the common-\nlaw immunities applicable in tort suits. See, e.g., Burns v.\nReed, 500 U. S. 478, 484 (1991). More than 60 years ago,\nin Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U. S. 367 (1951), the Court\nheld that §1983 did not abrogate the long-established\nabsolute immunity enjoyed by legislators for actions taken\n4                    REHBERG v. PAULK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwithin the legitimate sphere of legislative authority.\nImmunities “well grounded in history and reason,” the\nCourt wrote, were not somehow eliminated “by covert\ninclusion in the general language” of §1983. Id., at 376.\n   This interpretation has been reaffirmed by the Court\ntime and again and is now an entrenched feature of our\n§1983 jurisprudence. See, e.g., Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S.\n547, 554–555 (1967) (“The legislative record gives no clear\nindication that Congress meant to abolish wholesale all\ncommon-law immunities. Accordingly, this Court held . . .\nthat the immunity of legislators for acts within the legisla-\ntive role was not abolished. The immunity of judges for\nacts within the judicial role is equally well established,\nand we presume that Congress would have specifically so\nprovided had it wished to abolish the doctrine”); Imbler,\nsupra, at 418 (statute must “be read in harmony with\ngeneral principles of tort immunities and defenses rather\nthan in derogation of them”); Procunier v. Navarette, 434\nU. S. 555, 561 (1978) (“Although the Court has recognized\nthat in enacting §1983 Congress must have intended to\nexpose state officials to damages liability in some circum-\nstances, the section has been consistently construed as not\nintending wholesale revocation of the common-law im-\nmunity afforded government officials”); Briscoe v. LaHue,\n460 U. S. 325, 330 (1983) (“ ‘It is by now well settled that\nthe tort liability created by §1983 cannot be understood in\na historical vacuum. . . . One important assumption under-\nlying the Court’s decisions in this area is that members of\nthe 42d Congress were familiar with common-law princi-\nples, including defenses previously recognized in ordinary\ntort litigation, and that they likely intended these com-\nmon-law principles to obtain, absent specific provisions to\nthe contrary’ ” (quoting Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453\nU. S. 247, 258 (1981)); Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U. S. 522, 529\n(1984) (“The starting point in our own analysis is the\ncommon law.

S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion that common-law principles of . . . immunity were\nincorporated into our judicial system and that they should\nnot be abrogated absent clear legislative intent to do so”).\n                             B\n   Recognizing that “Congress intended [§1983] to be\nconstrued in the light of common-law principles,” the\nCourt has looked to the common law for guidance in de-\ntermining the scope of the immunities available in a §1983\naction. Kalina v. Fletcher, 522 U. S. 118, 123 (1997). We\ndo not simply make our own judgment about the need for\nimmunity. We have made it clear that it is not our role “to\nmake a freewheeling policy choice,” Malley v. Briggs, 475\nU. S. 335, 342 (1986), and that we do not have a license to\ncreate immunities based solely on our view of sound pol-\nicy, see Tower v. Glover, 467 U. S. 914, 922–923 (1984).\nInstead, we conduct “a considered inquiry into the immun-\nity historically accorded the relevant official at common\nlaw and the interests behind it.” Imbler, supra, at 421.\n   We take what has been termed a “functional approach.”\nSee Forrester v. White, 484 U. S. 219, 224 (1988); Burns,\nsupra, at 486. We consult the common law to identify\nthose governmental functions that were historically\nviewed as so important and vulnerable to interference by\nmeans of litigation that some form of absolute immunity\nfrom civil liability was needed to ensure that they are\nperformed “ ‘with independence and without fear of conse-\nquences.’ ” Pierson, supra, at 554 (quoting Bradley v.\nFisher, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88468\"><a href=\"/opinion/88468/bradley-v-fisher/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 350, n. ‡ (1872)). Taking this ap-\nproach, we have identified the following functions that are\nabsolutely immune from liability for damages under\n§1983: actions taken by legislators within the legitimate\nscope of legislative authority, see Tenney, supra; actions\ntaken by judges within the legitimate scope of judicial\nauthority, see Pierson, supra; actions taken by prosecutors\nin their role as advocates, see Imbler, 424 U. S., at 430–\n6                     REHBERG v. PAULK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n431; and the giving of testimony by witnesses at trial, see\nBriscoe, supra. By contrast, the Court has found no abso-\nlute immunity for the acts of the chief executive officer of\na State, the senior and subordinate officers of a State’s\nNational Guard, the president of a state university, see\nScheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, 247–248 (1974); school\nboard members, see Wood v. Strickland, 420 U. S. 308,\n318 (1975); the superintendent of a state hospital, see\nO’Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U. S. 563, 577 (1975); police\nofficers, see Pierson, supra, at 555; prison officials and\nofficers, Procunier, supra, at 561; and private co-\nconspirators of a judge, see Dennis v. Sparks, 449 U. S. 24,\n27 (1980).\n                              C\n    While the Court’s functional approach is tied to the\ncommon law’s identification of the functions that merit the\nprotection of absolute immunity, the Court’s precedents\nhave not mechanically duplicated the precise scope of the\nabsolute immunity that the common law provided to pro-\ntect those functions. See, e.g., Burns, 500 U. S., at 493\n(“ ‘[T]he precise contours of official immunity’ need not\nmirror the immunity at common law” (quoting Anderson v.\nCreighton, 483 U. S. 635, 645 (1987))).\n    This approach is illustrated by the Court’s analysis of\nthe absolute immunity enjoyed today by public prosecu-\ntors. When §1983’s predecessor was enacted in 1871, it\nwas common for criminal cases to be prosecuted by private\nparties. See, e.g., Stewart v. Sonneborn, 98 U. S. 187, 198\n(1879) (Bradley, J., dissenting) (“[E]very man in the com-\nmunity, if he has probable cause for prosecuting another,\nhas a perfect right, by law, to institute such prosecution,\nsubject only, in the case of private prosecutions, to the\npenalty of paying the costs if he fails in his suit”). And\nprivate prosecutors, like private plaintiffs in civil suits, did\nnot enjoy absolute immunity from suit. See Malley, 475\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S., at 340–341, and n. 3 (citing cases). Instead, “the\ngenerally accepted rule” was that a private complainant\nwho procured an arrest or prosecution could be held liable\nin an action for malicious prosecution if the complainant\nacted with malice and without probable cause. See id., at\n340–341; see also Briscoe, 460 U.

See Imbler, supra, at 441–442\n(White, J., concurring in judgment); Kalina, supra, at 124,\nn. 11 (noting that cases “decided after 1871 . . . granted a\nbroader immunity to public prosecutors than had been\navailable in malicious prosecution actions against private\npersons who brought prosecutions at early common law”);\nsee also Burns, supra, at 505 (SCALIA, J., concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part) (noting that the\n8                    REHBERG v. PAULK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“common-law tradition of prosecutorial immunity . . .\ndeveloped much later than 1871”).\n   This adaptation of prosecutorial immunity accommo-\ndated the special needs of public, as opposed to private,\nprosecutors. Because the daily function of a public prosecu-\ntor is to bring criminal charges, tort claims against public\nprosecutors “could be expected with some frequency, for a\ndefendant often will transform his resentment at being\nprosecuted into the ascription of improper and malicious\nactions to the State’s advocate.” Imbler, 424 U. S., at 425.\nSuch “harassment by unfounded litigation would cause a\ndeflection of the prosecutor’s energies from his public\nduties,” and would result in a severe interference with the\nadministration of an important public office. Id., at 423.\nConstant vulnerability to vexatious litigation would give\nrise to the “possibility that [the prosecutor] would shade\nhis decisions instead of exercising the independence of\njudgment required by his public trust.” Ibid.\n   Thus, when the issue of prosecutorial immunity un-\nder §1983 reached this Court in Imbler, the Court did\nnot simply apply the scope of immunity recognized by\ncommon-law courts as of 1871 but instead placed substan-\ntial reliance on post-1871 cases extending broad immunity\nto public prosecutors sued for common-law torts.\n   While the Court has looked to the common law in de-\ntermining the scope of the absolute immunity available\nunder §1983, the Court has not suggested that §1983\nis simply a federalized amalgamation of pre-existing\ncommon-law claims, an all-in-one federal claim encompass-\ning the torts of assault, trespass, false arrest, defamation,\nmalicious prosecution, and more. The new federal claim\ncreated by §1983 differs in important ways from those pre-\nexisting torts. It is broader in that it reaches constitu-\ntional and statutory violations that do not correspond to\nany previously known tort. See Kalina, 522 U. S., at 123.\nBut it is narrower in that it applies only to tortfeasors who\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nact under color of state law. See Briscoe, supra, at 329.\nSection 1983 “ha[s] no precise counterpart in state law. . . .\n[I]t is the purest coincidence when state statutes or the\ncommon law provide for equivalent remedies; any analo-\ngies to those causes of action are bound to be imperfect.”\nWilson v. Garcia, 471 U. S. 261, 272 (1985) (internal quo-\ntation marks and citation omitted). Thus, both the scope\nof the new tort and the scope of the absolute immunity\navailable in §1983 actions differ in some respects from the\ncommon law.\n                              III\n\n                               A\n\n    At common law, trial witnesses enjoyed a limited form\nof absolute immunity for statements made in the course\nof a judicial proceeding: They had complete immunity\nagainst slander and libel claims, even if it was alleged that\nthe statements in question were maliciously false. Kalina,\nsupra, at 133 (SCALIA, J., concurring) (citing F. Hilliard,\nLaw of Torts 319 (1866)); see Briscoe, supra, at 351 (Mar-\nshall, J., dissenting); Burns, 500 U. S., at 501 (opinion of\nSCALIA, J.).\n    In Briscoe, however, this Court held that the immunity\nof a trial witness sued under §1983 is broader: In such a\ncase, a trial witness has absolute immunity with respect to\nany claim based on the witness’ testimony. When a wit-\nness is sued because of his testimony, the Court wrote,\n“ ‘the claims of the individual must yield to the dictates of\npublic policy.’ ” 460 U. S., at 332–333 (quoting Calkins v.\nSumner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wis.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 197 (1860)). Without absolute im-\nmunity for witnesses, the Court concluded, the truth-\nseeking process at trial would be impaired. Witnesses\n“might be reluctant to come forward to testify,” and even if\na witness took the stand, the witness “might be inclined to\nshade his testimony in favor of the potential plaintiff ” for\n“fear of subsequent liability.” 460 U. S., at 333.\n10                   REHBERG v. PAULK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  The factors that justify absolute immunity for trial\nwitnesses apply with equal force to grand jury witnesses.\nIn both contexts, a witness’ fear of retaliatory litigation\nmay deprive the tribunal of critical evidence. And in\nneither context is the deterrent of potential civil liability\nneeded to prevent perjurious testimony. In Briscoe, the\nCourt concluded that the possibility of civil liability was\nnot needed to deter false testimony at trial because other\nsanctions—chiefly prosecution for perjury—provided a\nsufficient deterrent. Id., at 342. Since perjury before a\ngrand jury, like perjury at trial, is a serious criminal\noffense, see, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §1623(a), there is no reason to\nthink that this deterrent is any less effective in preventing\nfalse grand jury testimony.\n                             B\n  Neither is there any reason to distinguish law enforce-\nment witnesses from lay witnesses. In Briscoe, it was\nargued that absolute immunity was not needed for police-\nofficer witnesses, but the Court refused to draw that dis-\ntinction. The Court wrote:\n     “When a police officer appears as a witness, he may\n     reasonably be viewed as acting like any other witness\n     sworn to tell the truth—in which event he can make a\n     strong claim to witness immunity; alternatively, he\n     may be regarded as an official performing a critical\n     role in the judicial process, in which event he may\n     seek the benefit afforded to other governmental par-\n     ticipants in the same proceeding. Nothing in the lan-\n     guage of the statute suggests that such a witness be-\n     longs in a narrow, special category lacking protection\n     against damages suits.” 460 U. S., at 335–336 (foot-\n     note omitted).\nSee also id., at 342 (“A police officer on the witness stand\nperforms the same functions as any other witness”).\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  The Briscoe Court rebuffed two arguments for distin-\nguishing between law enforcement witnesses and lay\nwitnesses for immunity purposes: first, that absolute im-\nmunity is not needed for law enforcement witnesses be-\ncause they are less likely to be intimidated by the threat\nof suit and, second, that such witnesses should not be\nshielded by absolute immunity because false testimony by\na police officer is likely to be more damaging than false\ntestimony by a lay witness. See ibid. The Court observed\nthat there are other factors not applicable to lay witnesses\nthat weigh in favor of extending absolute immunity to\npolice officer witnesses.\n  First, police officers testify with some frequency. Id., at\n343. “Police officers testify in scores of cases every year,”\nthe Court noted, “and defendants often will transform\nresentment at being convicted into allegations of perjury\nby the State’s official witnesses.” Ibid. If police officer\nwitnesses were routinely forced to defend against claims\nbased on their testimony, their “ ‘energy and attention\nwould be diverted from the pressing duty of enforcing the\ncriminal law.’ ” Id., at 343–344 (quoting Imbler, 424 U. S.,\nat 425).\n  Second, a police officer witness’ potential liability, if\nconditioned on the exoneration of the accused, could influ-\nence decisions on appeal and collateral relief. 460 U. S., at\n344. Needless to say, such decisions should not be influ-\nenced by the likelihood of a subsequent civil rights action.\nBut the possibility that a decision favorable to the accused\nmight subject a police officer witness to liability would\ncreate the “ ‘risk of injecting extraneous concerns’ ” into\nappellate review and postconviction proceedings. Ibid.\n(quoting Imbler, supra, at 428, n. 27). In addition, law\nenforcement witnesses face the possibility of sanctions not\napplicable to lay witnesses, namely, loss of their jobs and\nother employment-related sanctions.\n  For these reasons, we conclude that grand jury wit-\n12                      REHBERG v. PAULK\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nnesses should enjoy the same immunity as witnesses at\ntrial. This means that a grand jury witness has absolute\nimmunity from any §1983 claim based on the witness’\ntestimony. In addition, as the Court of Appeals held, this\nrule may not be circumvented by claiming that a grand jury\nwitness conspired to present false testimony or by using\nevidence of the witness’ testimony to support any other\n§1983 claim concerning the initiation or maintenance of\na prosecution. Were it otherwise, “a criminal defendant\nturned civil plaintiff could simply reframe a claim to at-\ntack the preparation instead of the absolutely immune\nactions themselves.” Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U. S.\n259, 283 (1993) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part); see also Dykes v. Hosemann, 776 F. 2d\n942, 946 (CA11 1985) (per curiam) (“[J]udges, on mere\nallegations of conspiracy or prior agreement, could be\nhauled into court and made to defend their judicial acts,\nthe precise result judicial immunity was designed to\navoid”). In the vast majority of cases involving a claim\nagainst a grand jury witness, the witness and the prose-\ncutor conducting the investigation engage in preparatory\nactivity, such as a preliminary discussion in which the\nwitness relates the substance of his intended testimony.\nWe decline to endorse a rule of absolute immunity that is\nso easily frustrated.1\n                            IV\n                             A\n     Petitioner’s main argument is that our cases, chiefly\n\n——————\n   1 Of course, we do not suggest that absolute immunity extends to all\n\nactivity that a witness conducts outside of the grand jury room. For\nexample, we have accorded only qualified immunity to law enforcement\nofficials who falsify affidavits, see Kalina v. Fletcher, 522 U. S. 118,\n129–131 (1997); Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 340–345 (1986), and\nfabricate evidence concerning an unsolved crime, see Buckley, 509\nU. S., at 272–276.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMalley and Kalina, already establish that a “complaining\nwitness” is not shielded by absolute immunity. See Brief\nfor Petitioner 17–22. In those cases, law enforcement\nofficials who submitted affidavits in support of applica-\ntions for arrest warrants were denied absolute immunity\nbecause they “performed the function of a complaining\nwitness.” Kalina, 522 U. S., at 131; see Malley, 475 U. S.,\nat 340–341. Relying on these cases, petitioner contends\nthat certain grand jury witnesses—namely, those who\nqualify as “complaining witnesses”—are not entitled to\nabsolute immunity. Petitioner’s argument is based on a\nfundamental misunderstanding of the distinctive function\nplayed by a “complaining witness” during the period when\n§1983’s predecessor was enacted.\n   At that time, the term “complaining witness” was used\nto refer to a party who procured an arrest and initiated a\ncriminal prosecution, see Kalina, 522 U. S., at 135\n(SCALIA, J., concurring). A “complaining witness” might\nnot actually ever testify, and thus the term “ ‘witness’ in\n‘complaining witness’ is misleading.” Ibid. See also Mal-\nley, supra, at 340 (complaining witness “procure[s] the\nissuance of an arrest warrant by submitting a complaint”);\nWyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S. 158, 164–165 (1992) (complaining\nwitness “set[s] the wheels of government in motion by\ninstigating a legal action”).\n   It is true that a mid-19th century complaining witness\nmight testify, either before a grand jury or at trial. But\ntestifying was not a necessary characteristic of a “com-\nplaining witness.” See M. Newell, Malicious Prosecution\n368 (1892). Nor have we been presented with evidence\nthat witnesses who did no more than testify before a grand\njury were regarded as complaining witnesses and were\nsuccessfully sued for malicious prosecution. See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 14–15, 24–25.\n   In sum, testifying, whether before a grand jury or at\ntrial, was not the distinctive function performed by a\n14                      REHBERG v. PAULK\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncomplaining witness. It is clear—and petitioner does not\ncontend otherwise—that a complaining witness cannot\nbe held liable for perjurious trial testimony. Briscoe, 460\nU. S., at 326. And there is no more reason why a com-\nplaining witness should be subject to liability for testi-\nmony before a grand jury.\n   Once the distinctive function performed by a “complain-\ning witness” is understood, it is apparent that a law en-\nforcement officer who testifies before a grand jury is not at\nall comparable to a “complaining witness.” By testifying\nbefore a grand jury, a law enforcement officer does not\nperform the function of applying for an arrest warrant; nor\ndoes such an officer make the critical decision to initiate a\nprosecution. It is of course true that a detective or case\nagent who has performed or supervised most of the inves-\ntigative work in a case may serve as an important witness\nin the grand jury proceeding and may very much want the\ngrand jury to return an indictment. But such a witness,\nunlike a complaining witness at common law, does not\nmake the decision to press criminal charges.\n   Instead, it is almost always a prosecutor who is respon-\nsible for the decision to present a case to a grand jury, and\nin many jurisdictions, even if an indictment is handed up,\na prosecution cannot proceed unless the prosecutor signs\nthe indictment.2 It would thus be anomalous to permit a\npolice officer who testifies before a grand jury to be sued\n——————\n  2 The  federal courts have concluded uniformly that Rule 7(c) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure, providing that an indictment\n“must be signed by an attorney for the government,” precludes federal\ngrand juries from issuing an indictment without the prosecutor’s\nsignature, signifying his or her approval. See 4 W. LaFave, J. Israel,\nN. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure §15.1(d) (3d ed. 2007) (herein-\nafter LaFave). However, in some jurisdictions, the grand jury may\nreturn an indictment and initiate a prosecution without the prosecu-\ntor’s signature, but such cases are rare. See 1 S. Beale, W. Bryson, J.\nFelman, & M. Elston, Grand Jury Law and Practice, p. 4–76, and n. 2\n(2d ed. 2001).\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                   15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfor maliciously procuring an unjust prosecution when it is\nthe prosecutor, who is shielded by absolute immunity, who\nis actually responsible for the decision to prosecute. See\nAlbright v. Oliver, 510 U. S. 266, 279, n. 5 (1994)\n(GINSBURG, J., concurring) (the prosecutor is the “principal\nplayer in carrying out a prosecution”); see ibid. (“[T]he\nstar player is exonerated, but the supporting actor is\nnot”).3\n   Precisely because no grand jury witness has the power\nto initiate a prosecution, petitioner is unable to provide a\nworkable standard for determining whether a particular\ngrand jury witness is a “complaining witness.” Here,\nrespondent was the only witness to testify in two of the\nthree grand jury sessions that resulted in indictments.\nBut where multiple witnesses testify before a grand jury,\nidentifying the “complaining witness” would often be\ndifficult. Petitioner suggests that a “complaining witness”\n\n——————\n  3 Petitioner says there is no reason to distinguish between a person\nwho goes to the police to swear out a criminal complaint and a person\nwho testifies to facts before a grand jury for the same purpose and with\nthe same effect. Brief for Petitioner 2, 23. But this is like saying that\na bicycle and an F-16 are the same thing. Even if the functions are\nsimilar as a general matter, the entities are quite different. Grand\njuries, by tradition, statute, and sometimes constitutional mandate,\nhave a status and entitlement to information that absolute immunity\nfurthers. See, e.g., Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 423, n. 20 (1976)\n(“It is the functional comparability of their judgments to those of\nthe judge that has resulted in both grand jurors and prosecutors be-\ning referred to as ‘quasi-judicial’ officers, and their immunities being\ntermed ‘quasi-judicial’ as well”); see also United States v. Sells Engi-\nneering, Inc., 463 U. S. 418, 423 (1983) (“The grand jury has always\noccupied a high place as an instrument of justice in our system of\ncriminal law—so much so that it is enshrined in the Constitution”).\nOur holding today supports the functioning of the grand jury system.\nThe importance of the grand jury cannot be underestimated: In the\nfederal system and many States, see LaFave §15.1(d), a felony cannot\nbe charged without the consent of community representatives, a vital\nprotection from unwarranted prosecutions.\n16                  REHBERG v. PAULK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nis “someone who sets the prosecution in motion.” Tr. of\nOral Arg. 8; see Reply Brief for Petitioner 15. And peti-\ntioner maintains that the same distinction made at com-\nmon law between complaining witnesses and other wit-\nnesses applies in §1983 actions. See id., at 14–16. But,\nas we have explained, a complaining witness played a dis-\ntinctive role, and therefore even when a “complaining\nwitness” testified, there was a clear basis for distinguish-\ning between the “complaining witness” and other wit-\nnesses. Because no modern grand jury witness plays a\ncomparable role, petitioner’s proposed test would be of\nlittle use. Consider a case in which the case agent or lead\ndetective testifies before the grand jury and provides a\nwealth of background information and then a cooperating\nwitness appears and furnishes critical incriminating\ntestimony. Or suppose that two witnesses each provide\nessential testimony regarding different counts of an in-\ndictment or different elements of an offense. In these\ncases, which witnesses would be “complaining witnesses”\nand thus vulnerable to suit based on their testimony?\n                              B\n   Petitioner contends that the deterrent effect of civil\nliability is more needed in the grand jury context because\ntrial witnesses are exposed to cross-examination, which is\ndesigned to expose perjury. See Brief for Petitioner 21,\n25–26. This argument overlooks the fact that a critical\ngrand jury witness is likely to testify again at trial and\nmay be cross-examined at that time. But in any event, the\nforce of petitioner’s argument is more than offset by a\nspecial problem that would be created by allowing civil\nactions against grand jury witnesses—subversion of grand\njury secrecy.\n   “ ‘We consistently have recognized that the proper func-\ntioning of our grand jury system depends upon the secrecy\nof grand jury proceedings.’ ” United States v. Sells Engi-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nneering, Inc., 463 U. S. 418, 424 (1983) (quoting Douglas\nOil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 441 U. S. 211, 218–219\n(1979)). “ ‘[I]f preindictment proceedings were made public,\nmany prospective witnesses would be hesitant to come\nforward voluntarily, knowing that those against whom\nthey testify would be aware of that testimony. Moreover,\nwitnesses who appeared before the grand jury would be\nless likely to testify fully and frankly, as they would be\nopen to retribution.’ ” 463 U. S., at 424.\n  Allowing §1983 actions against grand jury witnesses\nwould compromise this vital secrecy. If the testimony of\nwitnesses before a grand jury could provide the basis for,\nor could be used as evidence supporting, a §1983 claim,\nthe identities of grand jury witnesses could be discovered\nby filing a §1983 action and moving for the disclosure of\nthe transcript of grand jury proceedings. Especially in\ncases involving violent criminal organizations or other\nsubjects who might retaliate against adverse grand jury\nwitnesses, the threat of such disclosure might seriously\nundermine the grand jury process.\n                              C\n  Finally, contrary to petitioner’s suggestion, recognizing\nabsolute immunity for grand jury witnesses does not\ncreate an insupportable distinction between States that\nuse grand juries and those that do not. Petitioner argues\nthat it would make no sense to distinguish for purposes\nof §1983 immunity between prosecutions initiated by the\nreturn of a grand jury indictment and those initiated by\nthe filing of a complaint or information, and he notes that\n26 States permit felony prosecutions to be brought by\ninformation. Brief for Petitioner 23–24. But petitioner\ndraws the wrong analogy. In States that permit felony\nprosecutions to be initiated by information, the closest\nanalog to a grand jury witness is a witness at a prelimi-\nnary hearing.

Thus, the Court\n looks to the common law for guidance in determining the scope of the\n immunities available in actions brought under §1983. See Kalina v.\n Fletcher, 522 U. S. 118, 123. Taking a “functional approach,” see,\n e.g., Forrester v. White, 484 U. S. 219, 224, the Court identifies those\n governmental functions that were historically viewed as so important\n and vulnerable to interference by means of litigation that some form\n of absolute immunity from civil liability was needed to ensure that\n they are “ ‘performed with independence and without fear of conse-\n quences,’ ” Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547, 554.\n    The Court’s functional approach is tied to the common law’s identi-\n fication of functions meriting the protection of absolute immunity,\n2                           REHBERG v. PAULK\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    but the Court’s precedents have not mechanically duplicated the pre-\n    cise scope of the absolute immunity the common law provided to pro-\n    tect those functions. For example, it was common in 1871 for cases to\n    be prosecuted by private parties, who did not enjoy absolute immuni-\n    ty from suit. But as the prosecutorial function was increasingly as-\n    sumed by public officials, common-law courts held that public prose-\n    cutors, unlike their private predecessors, were absolutely immune\n    from the types of tort claims that an aggrieved or vengeful criminal\n    defendant was most likely to assert. This adaptation of prosecutorial\n    immunity accommodated the special needs of public, as opposed to\n    private, prosecutors. Thus, when the issue of prosecutorial immunity\n    under §1983 reached this Court in Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S.\n    409, the Court did not simply apply the scope of immunity recognized\n    by common-law courts as of 1871 but instead relied substantially on\n    post-1871 cases extending broad immunity to public prosecutors sued\n    for common-law torts. Neither has the Court suggested that §1983 is\n    simply a federalized amalgamation of pre-existing common-law\n    claims. The new federal claim created by §1983 differs in important\n    ways from pre-existing common-law torts. Accordingly, both the\n    scope of the new tort and the scope of the absolute immunity availa-\n    ble in §1983 actions differ in some respects from the common law.\n    Pp. 3―9.\n       (b) A trial witness sued under §1983 enjoys absolute immunity\n    from any claim based on his testimony. Briscoe v. LaHue, 460 U. S.\n    352. Without absolute immunity, the truth-seeking process would be\n    impaired as witnesses might be reluctant to testify, and even a wit-\n    ness who took the stand “might be inclined to shade his testimony in\n    favor of the potential plaintiff ” for “fear of subsequent liability.” Id.,\n    at 333. These factors apply with equal force to grand jury witnesses.\n    In both contexts, a witness’ fear of retaliatory litigation may deprive\n    the tribunal of critical evidence. And in neither context is the deter-\n    rent of potential civil liability needed to prevent false testimony be-\n    cause other sanctions, chiefly prosecution for perjury, provide a suffi-\n    cient deterrent.\n       For the reasons identified in Briscoe, supra, at 342–344, there is no\n    reason to distinguish law enforcement witnesses from lay witnesses\n    in §1983 actions. And the rule that a grand jury witness has absolute\n    immunity from any §1983 claim based on the witness’ testimony may\n    not be circumvented by claiming that a grand jury witness conspired\n    to present false testimony, or by using evidence of the witness’ testi-\n    mony to support any other §1983 claim concerning the initiation or\n    maintenance of a prosecution. Were it otherwise, a criminal defend-\n    ant turned civil plaintiff could reframe a claim to attack the prepara-\n    tory activity—such as a preliminary discussion in which the witness\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  relates the substance of his intended testimony—rather than the ab-\n  solutely immune actions themselves. Pp. 9−12.\n     (c) Petitioner’s main argument is that under Malley v. Briggs, 475\n  U. S. 335, 340−341, and Kalina v. Fletcher, 522 U. S. 118, 131, grand\n  jury witnesses who are “complaining witnesses” are not entitled to\n  absolute immunity. But at the time §1983’s predecessor was enacted,\n  a “complaining witness” was a party who procured an arrest and ini-\n  tiated a criminal prosecution. A “complaining witness” might testify,\n  either before a grand jury or at trial, but testifying was not a neces-\n  sary characteristic of a “complaining witness.” Thus, testifying,\n  whether before a grand jury or at trial, was not the distinctive func-\n  tion performed by a “complaining witness.” A “complaining witness”\n  cannot be held liable for perjurious trial testimony, see Briscoe, 460\n  U. S., at 326, and there is no more reason why a “complaining wit-\n  ness” should be subject to liability for testimony before a grand jury.\n     Once the distinctive function performed by a “complaining witness”\n  is understood, it is apparent that a law enforcement officer who testi-\n  fies before a grand jury is not comparable to a “complaining witness”\n  because it is not the officer who makes the critical decision to press\n  criminal charges, but the prosecutor. It would be anomalous to per-\n  mit a police officer testifying before a grand jury to be sued for mali-\n  ciously procuring an unjust prosecution when it is the prosecutor,\n  who is shielded by absolute immunity, who is actually responsible for\n  the decision to initiate a prosecution. Petitioner also contends that\n  the deterrent effect of civil liability is more needed in grand jury pro-\n  ceedings because trial witnesses face cross-examination. But the\n  force of that argument is more than offset by the problem that allow-\n  ing such civil actions would create—subversion of grand jury secrecy,\n  which is essential to the proper functioning of the grand jury system.\n  See United States v. Sells Engineering, Inc., 463 U. S. 418, 424. And\n  finally, contrary to petitioner’s suggestion, recognizing absolute im-\n  munity for grand jury witnesses does not create an insupportable dis-\n  tinction between States that use grand juries and States that permit\n  felony prosecutions to be brought by complaint or information. Most\n  States that do not require an indictment for felonies provide a prelim-\n  inary hearing at which witnesses testify, and the lower courts have\n  held that preliminary hearing witnesses are protected by the same\n  immunity accorded grand jury witnesses.

REHBERG, PETITIONER v. JAMES\n                  P. PAULK\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [April 2, 2012]\n\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case requires us to decide whether a “complaining\nwitness” in a grand jury proceeding is entitled to the\nsame immunity in an action under 42 U. S. C. §1983 as a\nwitness who testifies at trial. We see no sound reason\nto draw a distinction for this purpose between grand jury\nand trial witnesses.\n                              I\n   Petitioner Charles Rehberg, a certified public account-\nant, sent anonymous faxes to several recipients, including\nthe management of a hospital in Albany, Georgia, criticiz-\ning the hospital’s management and activities. In response,\nthe local district attorney’s office, with the assistance of\nits chief investigator, respondent James Paulk, launched a\ncriminal investigation of petitioner, allegedly as a favor to\nthe hospital’s leadership.\n   Respondent testified before a grand jury, and petitioner\nwas then indicted for aggravated assault, burglary, and\nsix counts of making harassing telephone calls. The in-\ndictment charged that petitioner had assaulted a hospital\nphysician, Dr. James Hotz, after unlawfully entering the\n2                   REHBERG v. PAULK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndoctor’s home. Petitioner challenged the sufficiency of the\nindictment, and it was dismissed.\n   A few months later, respondent returned to the grand\njury, and petitioner was indicted again, this time for as-\nsaulting Dr. Hotz on August 22, 2004, and for making\nharassing phone calls. On this occasion, both the doctor\nand respondent testified. Petitioner challenged the suf-\nficiency of this second indictment, claiming that he was\n“nowhere near Dr. Hotz” on the date in question and that\n“[t]here was no evidence whatsoever that [he] committed\nan assault on anybody.” 611 F. 3d 828, 836 (CA11 2010).\nAgain, the indictment was dismissed.\n   While the second indictment was still pending, respond-\nent appeared before a grand jury for a third time, and yet\nanother indictment was returned. Petitioner was charged\nwith assault and making harassing phone calls. This final\nindictment was ultimately dismissed as well.\n   Petitioner then brought this action against respondent\nunder Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983. Petitioner\nalleged that respondent conspired to present and did\npresent false testimony to the grand jury. Respondent\nmoved to dismiss, arguing, among other things, that he\nwas entitled to absolute immunity for his grand jury\ntestimony. The United States District Court for the Mid-\ndle District of Georgia denied respondent’s motion to\ndismiss, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding, in\naccordance with Circuit precedent, that respondent was\nabsolutely immune from a §1983 claim based on his grand\njury testimony.\n   The Court of Appeals noted petitioner’s allegation that\nrespondent was the sole “complaining witness” before the\ngrand jury, but the Court of Appeals declined to recognize\na “complaining witness” exception to its precedent on\ngrand jury witness immunity. See 611 F. 3d, at 839–840.\n“[A]llowing civil suits for false grand jury testimony,” the\ncourt reasoned, “would . . . emasculate the confidential\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnature of grand jury testimony, and eviscerate the tradi-\ntional absolute immunity for witness testimony in judi-\ncial proceedings.” Id., at 840. The court went on to hold\nthat respondent was entitled to absolute immunity, not only\nwith respect to claims based directly on his grand jury\ntestimony, but also with respect to the claim that he con-\nspired to present such testimony. Id., at 841. To allow\nliability to be predicated on the alleged conspiracy, the\ncourt concluded, “ ‘would be to permit through the back\ndoor what is prohibited through the front.’ ” Ibid. (quoting\nJones v. Cannon, 174 F. 3d 1271, 1289 (CA11 1999)).\n   We granted certiorari to resolve a Circuit conflict re-\ngarding the immunity of a “complaining witness” in a\ngrand jury proceeding, 562 U. S. ___ (2011), and we now\naffirm.\n                              II\n  Section 1983, which derives from §1 of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1871, 17 Stat. 13, creates a private right of action\nto vindicate violations of “rights, privileges, or immunities\nsecured by the Constitution and laws” of the United\nStates. Under the terms of the statute, “ ‘[e]very person’\nwho acts under color of state law to deprive another of a\nconstitutional right [is] answerable to that person in a suit\nfor damages.” Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 417\n(1976) (citing 42 U. S. C. §1983).\n                            A\n  Despite the broad terms of §1983, this Court has long\nrecognized that the statute was not meant to effect a\nradical departure from ordinary tort law and the common-\nlaw immunities applicable in tort suits. See, e.g., Burns v.\nReed, 500 U. S. 478, 484 (1991). More than 60 years ago,\nin Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U. S. 367 (1951), the Court\nheld that §1983 did not abrogate the long-established\nabsolute immunity enjoyed by legislators for actions taken\n4                    REHBERG v. PAULK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwithin the legitimate sphere of legislative authority.\nImmunities “well grounded in history and reason,” the\nCourt wrote, were not somehow eliminated “by covert\ninclusion in the general language” of §1983. Id., at 376.\n   This interpretation has been reaffirmed by the Court\ntime and again and is now an entrenched feature of our\n§1983 jurisprudence. See, e.g., Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S.\n547, 554–555 (1967) (“The legislative record gives no clear\nindication that Congress meant to abolish wholesale all\ncommon-law immunities. Accordingly, this Court held . . .\nthat the immunity of legislators for acts within the legisla-\ntive role was not abolished. The immunity of judges for\nacts within the judicial role is equally well established,\nand we presume that Congress would have specifically so\nprovided had it wished to abolish the doctrine”); Imbler,\nsupra, at 418 (statute must “be read in harmony with\ngeneral principles of tort immunities and defenses rather\nthan in derogation of them”); Procunier v. Navarette, 434\nU. S. 555, 561 (1978) (“Although the Court has recognized\nthat in enacting §1983 Congress must have intended to\nexpose state officials to damages liability in some circum-\nstances, the section has been consistently construed as not\nintending wholesale revocation of the common-law im-\nmunity afforded government officials”); Briscoe v. LaHue,\n460 U. S. 325, 330 (1983) (“ ‘It is by now well settled that\nthe tort liability created by §1983 cannot be understood in\na historical vacuum. . . . One important assumption under-\nlying the Court’s decisions in this area is that members of\nthe 42d Congress were familiar with common-law princi-\nples, including defenses previously recognized in ordinary\ntort litigation, and that they likely intended these com-\nmon-law principles to obtain, absent specific provisions to\nthe contrary’ ” (quoting Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453\nU. S. 247, 258 (1981)); Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U. S. 522, 529\n(1984) (“The starting point in our own analysis is the\ncommon law.

Kalina v. Fletcher, 522 U. S. 118, 123 (1997). We\ndo not simply make our own judgment about the need for\nimmunity. We have made it clear that it is not our role “to\nmake a freewheeling policy choice,” Malley v. Briggs, 475\nU. S. 335, 342 (1986), and that we do not have a license to\ncreate immunities based solely on our view of sound pol-\nicy, see Tower v. Glover, 467 U. S. 914, 922–923 (1984).\nInstead, we conduct “a considered inquiry into the immun-\nity historically accorded the relevant official at common\nlaw and the interests behind it.” Imbler, supra, at 421.\n   We take what has been termed a “functional approach.”\nSee Forrester v. White, 484 U. S. 219, 224 (1988); Burns,\nsupra, at 486. We consult the common law to identify\nthose governmental functions that were historically\nviewed as so important and vulnerable to interference by\nmeans of litigation that some form of absolute immunity\nfrom civil liability was needed to ensure that they are\nperformed “ ‘with independence and without fear of conse-\nquences.’ ” Pierson, supra, at 554 (quoting Bradley v.\nFisher, 13 Wall. 335, 350, n. ‡ (1872)). Taking this ap-\nproach, we have identified the following functions that are\nabsolutely immune from liability for damages under\n§1983: actions taken by legislators within the legitimate\nscope of legislative authority, see Tenney, supra; actions\ntaken by judges within the legitimate scope of judicial\nauthority, see Pierson, supra; actions taken by prosecutors\nin their role as advocates, see Imbler, 424 U. S., at 430–\n6                     REHBERG v. PAULK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n431; and the giving of testimony by witnesses at trial, see\nBriscoe, supra. By contrast, the Court has found no abso-\nlute immunity for the acts of the chief executive officer of\na State, the senior and subordinate officers of a State’s\nNational Guard, the president of a state university, see\nScheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, 247–248 (1974); school\nboard members, see Wood v. Strickland, 420 U. S. 308,\n318 (1975); the superintendent of a state hospital, see\nO’Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U. S. 563, 577 (1975); police\nofficers, see Pierson, supra, at 555; prison officials and\nofficers, Procunier, supra, at 561; and private co-\nconspirators of a judge, see Dennis v. Sparks, 449 U. S. 24,\n27 (1980).\n                              C\n    While the Court’s functional approach is tied to the\ncommon law’s identification of the functions that merit the\nprotection of absolute immunity, the Court’s precedents\nhave not mechanically duplicated the precise scope of the\nabsolute immunity that the common law provided to pro-\ntect those functions. See, e.g., Burns, 500 U. S., at 493\n(“ ‘[T]he precise contours of official immunity’ need not\nmirror the immunity at common law” (quoting Anderson v.\nCreighton, 483 U. S. 635, 645 (1987))).\n    This approach is illustrated by the Court’s analysis of\nthe absolute immunity enjoyed today by public prosecu-\ntors. When §1983’s predecessor was enacted in 1871, it\nwas common for criminal cases to be prosecuted by private\nparties. See, e.g., Stewart v. Sonneborn, 98 U. S. 187, 198\n(1879) (Bradley, J., dissenting) (“[E]very man in the com-\nmunity, if he has probable cause for prosecuting another,\nhas a perfect right, by law, to institute such prosecution,\nsubject only, in the case of private prosecutions, to the\npenalty of paying the costs if he fails in his suit”). And\nprivate prosecutors, like private plaintiffs in civil suits, did\nnot enjoy absolute immunity from suit. See Malley, 475\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S., at 340–341, and n. 3 (citing cases). Instead, “the\ngenerally accepted rule” was that a private complainant\nwho procured an arrest or prosecution could be held liable\nin an action for malicious prosecution if the complainant\nacted with malice and without probable cause. See id., at\n340–341; see also Briscoe, 460 U. S., at 351 (Marshall, J.,\ndissenting) (“Both English and American courts routinely\npermitted plaintiffs to bring actions alleging that the de-\nfendant had made a false and malicious accusation of a\nfelony to a magistrate or other judicial officer”); Wheeler v.\nNesbitt, 24 How. 544, 550 (1861) (“Undoubtedly, every\nperson who puts the criminal law in force maliciously,\nand without any reasonable or probable cause, commits a\nwrongful act; and if the accused is thereby prejudiced,\neither in his person or property, the injury and loss so\nsustained constitute the proper foundation of an action to\nrecover compensation”); Dinsman v. Wilkes, 12 How. 390,\n402 (1852) (no immunity “where a party had maliciously,\nand without probable cause, procured the plaintiff to be\nindicted or arrested for an offence of which he was not\nguilty”).\n   In the decades after the adoption of the 1871 Civil\nRights Act, however, the prosecutorial function was in-\ncreasingly assumed by public officials, and common-law\ncourts held that public prosecutors, unlike their private\npredecessors, were absolutely immune from the types of\ntort claims that an aggrieved or vengeful criminal defend-\nant was most likely to assert, namely, claims for malicious\nprosecution or defamation. See Imbler, supra, at 441–442\n(White, J., concurring in judgment); Kalina, supra, at 124,\nn. 11 (noting that cases “decided after 1871 . . . granted a\nbroader immunity to public prosecutors than had been\navailable in malicious prosecution actions against private\npersons who brought prosecutions at early common law”);\nsee also Burns, supra, at 505 (SCALIA, J., concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part) (noting that the\n8                    REHBERG v. PAULK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“common-law tradition of prosecutorial immunity . . .\ndeveloped much later than 1871”).\n   This adaptation of prosecutorial immunity accommo-\ndated the special needs of public, as opposed to private,\nprosecutors. Because the daily function of a public prosecu-\ntor is to bring criminal charges, tort claims against public\nprosecutors “could be expected with some frequency, for a\ndefendant often will transform his resentment at being\nprosecuted into the ascription of improper and malicious\nactions to the State’s advocate.” Imbler, 424 U. S., at 425.\nSuch “harassment by unfounded litigation would cause a\ndeflection of the prosecutor’s energies from his public\nduties,” and would result in a severe interference with the\nadministration of an important public office. Id., at 423.\nConstant vulnerability to vexatious litigation would give\nrise to the “possibility that [the prosecutor] would shade\nhis decisions instead of exercising the independence of\njudgment required by his public trust.” Ibid.\n   Thus, when the issue of prosecutorial immunity un-\nder §1983 reached this Court in Imbler, the Court did\nnot simply apply the scope of immunity recognized by\ncommon-law courts as of 1871 but instead placed substan-\ntial reliance on post-1871 cases extending broad immunity\nto public prosecutors sued for common-law torts.\n   While the Court has looked to the common law in de-\ntermining the scope of the absolute immunity available\nunder §1983, the Court has not suggested that §1983\nis simply a federalized amalgamation of pre-existing\ncommon-law claims, an all-in-one federal claim encompass-\ning the torts of assault, trespass, false arrest, defamation,\nmalicious prosecution, and more. The new federal claim\ncreated by §1983 differs in important ways from those pre-\nexisting torts. It is broader in that it reaches constitu-\ntional and statutory violations that do not correspond to\nany previously known tort. See Kalina, 522 U. S., at 123.\nBut it is narrower in that it applies only to tortfeasors who\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nact under color of state law. See Briscoe, supra, at 329.\nSection 1983 “ha[s] no precise counterpart in state law. . . .\n[I]t is the purest coincidence when state statutes or the\ncommon law provide for equivalent remedies; any analo-\ngies to those causes of action are bound to be imperfect.”\nWilson v. Garcia, 471 U. S. 261, 272 (1985) (internal quo-\ntation marks and citation omitted). Thus, both the scope\nof the new tort and the scope of the absolute immunity\navailable in §1983 actions differ in some respects from the\ncommon law.\n                              III\n\n                               A\n\n    At common law, trial witnesses enjoyed a limited form\nof absolute immunity for statements made in the course\nof a judicial proceeding: They had complete immunity\nagainst slander and libel claims, even if it was alleged that\nthe statements in question were maliciously false. Kalina,\nsupra, at 133 (SCALIA, J., concurring) (citing F. Hilliard,\nLaw of Torts 319 (1866)); see Briscoe, supra, at 351 (Mar-\nshall, J., dissenting); Burns, 500 U. S., at 501 (opinion of\nSCALIA, J.).\n    In Briscoe, however, this Court held that the immunity\nof a trial witness sued under §1983 is broader: In such a\ncase, a trial witness has absolute immunity with respect to\nany claim based on the witness’ testimony. When a wit-\nness is sued because of his testimony, the Court wrote,\n“ ‘the claims of the individual must yield to the dictates of\npublic policy.’ ” 460 U. S., at 332–333 (quoting Calkins v.\nSumner, 13 Wis. 193, 197 (1860)). Without absolute im-\nmunity for witnesses, the Court concluded, the truth-\nseeking process at trial would be impaired. Witnesses\n“might be reluctant to come forward to testify,” and even if\na witness took the stand, the witness “might be inclined to\nshade his testimony in favor of the potential plaintiff ” for\n“fear of subsequent liability.” 460 U. S., at 333.\n10                   REHBERG v. PAULK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  The factors that justify absolute immunity for trial\nwitnesses apply with equal force to grand jury witnesses.\nIn both contexts, a witness’ fear of retaliatory litigation\nmay deprive the tribunal of critical evidence. And in\nneither context is the deterrent of potential civil liability\nneeded to prevent perjurious testimony. In Briscoe, the\nCourt concluded that the possibility of civil liability was\nnot needed to deter false testimony at trial because other\nsanctions—chiefly prosecution for perjury—provided a\nsufficient deterrent. Id., at 342. Since perjury before a\ngrand jury, like perjury at trial, is a serious criminal\noffense, see, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §1623(a), there is no reason to\nthink that this deterrent is any less effective in preventing\nfalse grand jury testimony.\n                             B\n  Neither is there any reason to distinguish law enforce-\nment witnesses from lay witnesses. In Briscoe, it was\nargued that absolute immunity was not needed for police-\nofficer witnesses, but the Court refused to draw that dis-\ntinction. The Court wrote:\n     “When a police officer appears as a witness, he may\n     reasonably be viewed as acting like any other witness\n     sworn to tell the truth—in which event he can make a\n     strong claim to witness immunity; alternatively, he\n     may be regarded as an official performing a critical\n     role in the judicial process, in which event he may\n     seek the benefit afforded to other governmental par-\n     ticipants in the same proceeding. Nothing in the lan-\n     guage of the statute suggests that such a witness be-\n     longs in a narrow, special category lacking protection\n     against damages suits.” 460 U. S., at 335–336 (foot-\n     note omitted).\nSee also id., at 342 (“A police officer on the witness stand\nperforms the same functions as any other witness”).\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  The Briscoe Court rebuffed two arguments for distin-\nguishing between law enforcement witnesses and lay\nwitnesses for immunity purposes: first, that absolute im-\nmunity is not needed for law enforcement witnesses be-\ncause they are less likely to be intimidated by the threat\nof suit and, second, that such witnesses should not be\nshielded by absolute immunity because false testimony by\na police officer is likely to be more damaging than false\ntestimony by a lay witness. See ibid. The Court observed\nthat there are other factors not applicable to lay witnesses\nthat weigh in favor of extending absolute immunity to\npolice officer witnesses.\n  First, police officers testify with some frequency. Id., at\n343. “Police officers testify in scores of cases every year,”\nthe Court noted, “and defendants often will transform\nresentment at being convicted into allegations of perjury\nby the State’s official witnesses.” Ibid. If police officer\nwitnesses were routinely forced to defend against claims\nbased on their testimony, their “ ‘energy and attention\nwould be diverted from the pressing duty of enforcing the\ncriminal law.’ ” Id., at 343–344 (quoting Imbler, 424 U. S.,\nat 425).\n  Second, a police officer witness’ potential liability, if\nconditioned on the exoneration of the accused, could influ-\nence decisions on appeal and collateral relief. 460 U. S., at\n344. Needless to say, such decisions should not be influ-\nenced by the likelihood of a subsequent civil rights action.\nBut the possibility that a decision favorable to the accused\nmight subject a police officer witness to liability would\ncreate the “ ‘risk of injecting extraneous concerns’ ” into\nappellate review and postconviction proceedings. Ibid.\n(quoting Imbler, supra, at 428, n. 27). In addition, law\nenforcement witnesses face the possibility of sanctions not\napplicable to lay witnesses, namely, loss of their jobs and\nother employment-related sanctions.\n  For these reasons, we conclude that grand jury wit-\n12                      REHBERG v. PAULK\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nnesses should enjoy the same immunity as witnesses at\ntrial. This means that a grand jury witness has absolute\nimmunity from any §1983 claim based on the witness’\ntestimony. In addition, as the Court of Appeals held, this\nrule may not be circumvented by claiming that a grand jury\nwitness conspired to present false testimony or by using\nevidence of the witness’ testimony to support any other\n§1983 claim concerning the initiation or maintenance of\na prosecution. Were it otherwise, “a criminal defendant\nturned civil plaintiff could simply reframe a claim to at-\ntack the preparation instead of the absolutely immune\nactions themselves.” Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U. S.\n259, 283 (1993) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part); see also Dykes v. Hosemann, 776 F. 2d\n942, 946 (CA11 1985) (per curiam) (“[J]udges, on mere\nallegations of conspiracy or prior agreement, could be\nhauled into court and made to defend their judicial acts,\nthe precise result judicial immunity was designed to\navoid”). In the vast majority of cases involving a claim\nagainst a grand jury witness, the witness and the prose-\ncutor conducting the investigation engage in preparatory\nactivity, such as a preliminary discussion in which the\nwitness relates the substance of his intended testimony.\nWe decline to endorse a rule of absolute immunity that is\nso easily frustrated.1\n                            IV\n                             A\n     Petitioner’s main argument is that our cases, chiefly\n\n——————\n   1 Of course, we do not suggest that absolute immunity extends to all\n\nactivity that a witness conducts outside of the grand jury room. For\nexample, we have accorded only qualified immunity to law enforcement\nofficials who falsify affidavits, see Kalina v. Fletcher, 522 U. S. 118,\n129–131 (1997); Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 340–345 (1986), and\nfabricate evidence concerning an unsolved crime, see Buckley, 509\nU. S., at 272–276.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMalley and Kalina, already establish that a “complaining\nwitness” is not shielded by absolute immunity. See Brief\nfor Petitioner 17–22. In those cases, law enforcement\nofficials who submitted affidavits in support of applica-\ntions for arrest warrants were denied absolute immunity\nbecause they “performed the function of a complaining\nwitness.” Kalina, 522 U. S., at 131; see Malley, 475 U. S.,\nat 340–341. Relying on these cases, petitioner contends\nthat certain grand jury witnesses—namely, those who\nqualify as “complaining witnesses”—are not entitled to\nabsolute immunity. Petitioner’s argument is based on a\nfundamental misunderstanding of the distinctive function\nplayed by a “complaining witness” during the period when\n§1983’s predecessor was enacted.\n   At that time, the term “complaining witness” was used\nto refer to a party who procured an arrest and initiated a\ncriminal prosecution, see Kalina, 522 U. S., at 135\n(SCALIA, J., concurring). A “complaining witness” might\nnot actually ever testify, and thus the term “ ‘witness’ in\n‘complaining witness’ is misleading.” Ibid. See also Mal-\nley, supra, at 340 (complaining witness “procure[s] the\nissuance of an arrest warrant by submitting a complaint”);\nWyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S. 158, 164–165 (1992) (complaining\nwitness “set[s] the wheels of government in motion by\ninstigating a legal action”).\n   It is true that a mid-19th century complaining witness\nmight testify, either before a grand jury or at trial. But\ntestifying was not a necessary characteristic of a “com-\nplaining witness.” See M. Newell, Malicious Prosecution\n368 (1892). Nor have we been presented with evidence\nthat witnesses who did no more than testify before a grand\njury were regarded as complaining witnesses and were\nsuccessfully sued for malicious prosecution. See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 14–15, 24–25.\n   In sum, testifying, whether before a grand jury or at\ntrial, was not the distinctive function performed by a\n14                      REHBERG v. PAULK\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncomplaining witness. It is clear—and petitioner does not\ncontend otherwise—that a complaining witness cannot\nbe held liable for perjurious trial testimony. Briscoe, 460\nU. S., at 326. And there is no more reason why a com-\nplaining witness should be subject to liability for testi-\nmony before a grand jury.\n   Once the distinctive function performed by a “complain-\ning witness” is understood, it is apparent that a law en-\nforcement officer who testifies before a grand jury is not at\nall comparable to a “complaining witness.” By testifying\nbefore a grand jury, a law enforcement officer does not\nperform the function of applying for an arrest warrant; nor\ndoes such an officer make the critical decision to initiate a\nprosecution. It is of course true that a detective or case\nagent who has performed or supervised most of the inves-\ntigative work in a case may serve as an important witness\nin the grand jury proceeding and may very much want the\ngrand jury to return an indictment. But such a witness,\nunlike a complaining witness at common law, does not\nmake the decision to press criminal charges.\n   Instead, it is almost always a prosecutor who is respon-\nsible for the decision to present a case to a grand jury, and\nin many jurisdictions, even if an indictment is handed up,\na prosecution cannot proceed unless the prosecutor signs\nthe indictment.2 It would thus be anomalous to permit a\npolice officer who testifies before a grand jury to be sued\n——————\n  2 The  federal courts have concluded uniformly that Rule 7(c) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure, providing that an indictment\n“must be signed by an attorney for the government,” precludes federal\ngrand juries from issuing an indictment without the prosecutor’s\nsignature, signifying his or her approval. See 4 W. LaFave, J. Israel,\nN. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure §15.1(d) (3d ed. 2007) (herein-\nafter LaFave). However, in some jurisdictions, the grand jury may\nreturn an indictment and initiate a prosecution without the prosecu-\ntor’s signature, but such cases are rare. See 1 S. Beale, W. Bryson, J.\nFelman, & M. Elston, Grand Jury Law and Practice, p. 4–76, and n. 2\n(2d ed. 2001).\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                   15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfor maliciously procuring an unjust prosecution when it is\nthe prosecutor, who is shielded by absolute immunity, who\nis actually responsible for the decision to prosecute. See\nAlbright v. Oliver, 510 U. S. 266, 279, n. 5 (1994)\n(GINSBURG, J., concurring) (the prosecutor is the “principal\nplayer in carrying out a prosecution”); see ibid. (“[T]he\nstar player is exonerated, but the supporting actor is\nnot”).3\n   Precisely because no grand jury witness has the power\nto initiate a prosecution, petitioner is unable to provide a\nworkable standard for determining whether a particular\ngrand jury witness is a “complaining witness.” Here,\nrespondent was the only witness to testify in two of the\nthree grand jury sessions that resulted in indictments.\nBut where multiple witnesses testify before a grand jury,\nidentifying the “complaining witness” would often be\ndifficult. Petitioner suggests that a “complaining witness”\n\n——————\n  3 Petitioner says there is no reason to distinguish between a person\nwho goes to the police to swear out a criminal complaint and a person\nwho testifies to facts before a grand jury for the same purpose and with\nthe same effect. Brief for Petitioner 2, 23. But this is like saying that\na bicycle and an F-16 are the same thing. Even if the functions are\nsimilar as a general matter, the entities are quite different. Grand\njuries, by tradition, statute, and sometimes constitutional mandate,\nhave a status and entitlement to information that absolute immunity\nfurthers. See, e.g., Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 423, n. 20 (1976)\n(“It is the functional comparability of their judgments to those of\nthe judge that has resulted in both grand jurors and prosecutors be-\ning referred to as ‘quasi-judicial’ officers, and their immunities being\ntermed ‘quasi-judicial’ as well”); see also United States v. Sells Engi-\nneering, Inc., 463 U. S. 418, 423 (1983) (“The grand jury has always\noccupied a high place as an instrument of justice in our system of\ncriminal law—so much so that it is enshrined in the Constitution”).\nOur holding today supports the functioning of the grand jury system.\nThe importance of the grand jury cannot be underestimated: In the\nfederal system and many States, see LaFave §15.1(d), a felony cannot\nbe charged without the consent of community representatives, a vital\nprotection from unwarranted prosecutions.\n16                  REHBERG v. PAULK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nis “someone who sets the prosecution in motion.” Tr. of\nOral Arg. 8; see Reply Brief for Petitioner 15. And peti-\ntioner maintains that the same distinction made at com-\nmon law between complaining witnesses and other wit-\nnesses applies in §1983 actions. See id., at 14–16. But,\nas we have explained, a complaining witness played a dis-\ntinctive role, and therefore even when a “complaining\nwitness” testified, there was a clear basis for distinguish-\ning between the “complaining witness” and other wit-\nnesses. Because no modern grand jury witness plays a\ncomparable role, petitioner’s proposed test would be of\nlittle use. Consider a case in which the case agent or lead\ndetective testifies before the grand jury and provides a\nwealth of background information and then a cooperating\nwitness appears and furnishes critical incriminating\ntestimony. Or suppose that two witnesses each provide\nessential testimony regarding different counts of an in-\ndictment or different elements of an offense. In these\ncases, which witnesses would be “complaining witnesses”\nand thus vulnerable to suit based on their testimony?\n                              B\n   Petitioner contends that the deterrent effect of civil\nliability is more needed in the grand jury context because\ntrial witnesses are exposed to cross-examination, which is\ndesigned to expose perjury. See Brief for Petitioner 21,\n25–26. This argument overlooks the fact that a critical\ngrand jury witness is likely to testify again at trial and\nmay be cross-examined at that time. But in any event, the\nforce of petitioner’s argument is more than offset by a\nspecial problem that would be created by allowing civil\nactions against grand jury witnesses—subversion of grand\njury secrecy.\n   “ ‘We consistently have recognized that the proper func-\ntioning of our grand jury system depends upon the secrecy\nof grand jury proceedings.’ ” United States v. Sells Engi-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nneering, Inc., 463 U. S. 418, 424 (1983) (quoting Douglas\nOil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 441 U. S. 211, 218–219\n(1979)). “ ‘[I]f preindictment proceedings were made public,\nmany prospective witnesses would be hesitant to come\nforward voluntarily, knowing that those against whom\nthey testify would be aware of that testimony. Moreover,\nwitnesses who appeared before the grand jury would be\nless likely to testify fully and frankly, as they would be\nopen to retribution.’ ” 463 U. S., at 424.\n  Allowing §1983 actions against grand jury witnesses\nwould compromise this vital secrecy. If the testimony of\nwitnesses before a grand jury could provide the basis for,\nor could be used as evidence supporting, a §1983 claim,\nthe identities of grand jury witnesses could be discovered\nby filing a §1983 action and moving for the disclosure of\nthe transcript of grand jury proceedings. Especially in\ncases involving violent criminal organizations or other\nsubjects who might retaliate against adverse grand jury\nwitnesses, the threat of such disclosure might seriously\nundermine the grand jury process.\n                              C\n  Finally, contrary to petitioner’s suggestion, recognizing\nabsolute immunity for grand jury witnesses does not\ncreate an insupportable distinction between States that\nuse grand juries and those that do not. Petitioner argues\nthat it would make no sense to distinguish for purposes\nof §1983 immunity between prosecutions initiated by the\nreturn of a grand jury indictment and those initiated by\nthe filing of a complaint or information, and he notes that\n26 States permit felony prosecutions to be brought by\ninformation. Brief for Petitioner 23–24. But petitioner\ndraws the wrong analogy. In States that permit felony\nprosecutions to be initiated by information, the closest\nanalog to a grand jury witness is a witness at a prelimi-\nnary hearing. Most of the States that do not require an\n18                  REHBERG v.

The lower courts have held that\nwitnesses at a preliminary hearing are protected by the\nsame immunity accorded grand jury witnesses, see, e.g.,\nBrice v. Nkaru, 220 F. 3d 233, 239, n. 6 (CA4 2000); Curtis\nv.
