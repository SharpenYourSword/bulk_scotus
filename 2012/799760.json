UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 10–875.      Argued November 29, 2011—Decided May 14, 2012\nChapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code allows farmer debtors with regular\n annual income to adjust their debts subject to a reorganization plan.\n The plan must provide for full payment of priority claims. 11 U. S. C.\n §1222(a)(2). Under §1222(a)(2)(A), however, certain governmental\n claims arising from the disposition of farm assets are stripped of pri-\n ority status and downgraded to general, unsecured claims that are\n dischargeable after less than full payment. That exception applies\n only to claims “entitled to priority under [11 U. S. C. §507]” in the\n first place. As relevant here, §507(a)(2) covers “administrative ex-\n penses allowed under §503(b),” which includes “any tax . . . incurred\n by the estate.” §503(b)(B)(i).\n    Petitioners filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy and then sold their\n farm. They proposed a plan under which they would pay off out-\n standing liabilities with proceeds from the sale. The Internal Reve-\n nue Service (IRS) objected, asserting a tax on the capital gains from\n the sale. Petitioners then proposed treating the tax as an unsecured\n claim to be paid to the extent funds were available, with the unpaid\n balance being discharged. The Bankruptcy Court sustained an IRS\n objection, the District Court reversed, and the Ninth Circuit reversed\n the District Court. The Ninth Circuit held that because a Chapter 12\n estate is not a separate taxable entity under the Internal Revenue\n Code (IRC), 26 U. S. C. §§1398, 1399, it does not “incur” postpetition\n federal income taxes. The Ninth Circuit concluded that because the\n tax was not “incurred by the estate” under §503(b), it was not a prior-\n ity claim eligible for the §1222(a)(2)(A) exception.\nHeld: The federal income tax liability resulting from petitioners’ post-\n petition farm sale is not “incurred by the estate” under §503(b) of the\n Bankruptcy Code and thus is neither collectible nor dischargeable in\n2                       HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    the Chapter 12 plan. Pp. 4−17.\n       (a) The phrase “incurred by the estate” bears a plain and natural\n    reading. A tax “incurred by the estate” is a tax for which the estate\n    itself is liable. Only certain estates are liable for federal income tax-\n    es. IRC §§1398 and 1399 define the division of responsibilities for the\n    payment of taxes between the estate and the debtor on a chapter-by-\n    chapter basis. Under those provisions, a Chapter 12 estate is not a\n    separately taxable entity. The debtor—not the trustee—is generally\n    liable for taxes and files the only tax return. The postpetition income\n    taxes are thus not “incurred by the estate.” Pp. 4−5.\n       (b) Section 346 of the Bankruptcy Code and its longstanding inter-\n    play with IRC §§1398 and 1399 reinforce that whether an estate “in-\n    curs” taxes turns on Congress’ chapter-specific guidance on which es-\n    tates are separately taxable. The original §346 established that state\n    or local income taxes could be imposed only on the estate in an indi-\n    vidual-debtor Chapter 7 or 11 bankruptcy, and only on the debtor in\n    a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Congress applied the framework of §346 to\n    federal taxes two years later: IRC §1398 and 1399 established that\n    the estate is separately taxable in individual-debtor Chapter 7 or 11\n    cases, and not separately taxable in Chapter 13 (and now Chapter\n    12) cases. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protec-\n    tion Act of 2005 subsequently amended §346, expressly aligning its\n    assignment of state or local taxes with the IRC separate taxable enti-\n    ty rules for federal taxes. This Court assumes that Congress is\n    aware of existing law when it passes legislation, and the existing law\n    at the enactment of §1222(a)(2)(A) indicated that an estate’s liability\n    for taxes turned on separate taxable entity rules. Pp. 6−9.\n       (c) Chapter 13, on which Chapter 12 was modeled, further bolsters\n    this Court’s holding. Established understandings hold that postpeti-\n    tion income taxes are not “incurred by the [Chapter 13] estate” under\n    §503(b) because they are the liability of the Chapter 13 debtor alone.\n    The Government has also long hewed to this position. Section\n    1305(a)(1), which gives holders of postpetition claims the option of\n    collecting postpetition taxes within the bankruptcy case, would be\n    superfluous if postpetition tax liabilities were automatically collecti-\n    ble inside the bankruptcy. It is thus clear that postpetition income\n    taxes are not automatically collectible in a Chapter 13 plan and are\n    not administrative expenses under §503(b). To hold otherwise in\n    Chapter 12 would disrupt settled practices in Chapter 13 cases.\n    Pp. 9−12.\n       (d) None of the contrary arguments by petitioners and the dissent\n    overcomes the statute’s plain language, context, and structure.\n    There is no textual basis for giving “incurred by the estate” a tem-\n    poral meaning, such that it refers to all taxes “incurred postpetition.”\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                  3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  Nor does the text support deeming a tax “incurred by the estate”\n  whenever it is paid by the debtor out of property of the estate. Sec-\n  tion 503’s legislative history is not inconsistent with this Court’s\n  holding, and the Court has cautioned against allowing ambiguous\n  legislative history to muddy clear statutory language. See Milner v.\n  Department of Navy, 562 U. S. ___, ___. Meanwhile, any cases sug-\n  gesting that postpetition taxes were treated as administrative ex-\n  penses are inapposite because they involve corporate debtors, which\n  Congress has singled out for responsibilities paralleling those borne\n  by a separate taxable entity’s trustee. Finally, petitioners contend\n  that the purpose of §1222(a)(2)(A) was to provide debtors with robust\n  relief from tax debts. There may be compelling policy reasons for\n  treating postpetition income tax liabilities as dischargeable. But if\n  Congress intended petitioners’ result, it did not so provide in the\n  statute.

S. C. §1222(a)\n(2)(A). One such claim is for “any tax . . . incurred by the\nestate.” §503(b)(B)(i). The question presented is whether\na federal income tax liability resulting from individual\ndebtors’ sale of a farm during the pendency of a Chapter\n12 bankruptcy is “incurred by the estate” and thus dis­\nchargeable. We hold that it is not.\n                            I\n\n                            A\n\n  In 1986, Congress enacted Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy\nCode, §1201 et seq., to allow farmer debtors with regu­\nlar annual income to adjust their debts. Chapter 12 was\nmodeled on Chapter 13, §1301 et seq., which permits\nindividual debtors with regular annual income to preserve\nexisting assets subject to a “court-approved plan under\nwhich they pay creditors out of their future income.”\nHamilton v. Lanning, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 1).\n2                 HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nChapter 12 debtors similarly file a plan of reorganization.\n§1221. To be confirmed, the plan must provide for the full\npayment of priority claims. §1222(a)(2).\n  In the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer\nProtection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), §1003, 119 Stat. 186,\nCongress created an exception to that requirement:\n    “Contents of plan\n    “(a) The plan shall—\n         .           .           .          .          .\n       “(2) provide for the full payment, in deferred cash\n    payments, of all claims entitled to priority under sec­\n    tion 507, unless—\n       “(A) the claim is a claim owed to a governmental\n    unit that arises as a result of the sale, transfer, ex­\n    change, or other disposition of any farm asset used\n    in the debtor’s farming operation, in which case the\n    claim shall be treated as an unsecured claim that is\n    not entitled to priority under section 507, but the debt\n    shall be treated in such manner only if the debtor re­\n    ceives a discharge.” 11 U. S. C. §1222.\nUnder §1222(a)(2)(A), certain governmental claims result­\ning from the disposition of farm assets are downgraded to\ngeneral, unsecured claims that are dischargeable after less\nthan full payment. See §1228(a). The claims are stripped\nof their priority status.\n   That exception, however, applies only to claims in the\nplan that are “entitled to priority under section 507” in the\nfirst place. Section 507 lists 10 categories of such claims.\nTwo pertain to taxes: One category, §507(a)(8), covers\nprepetition taxes, and is inapplicable in this case. The\nother, §507(a)(2), covers “administrative expenses allowed\nunder section 503(b),” which in turn includes “any tax . . .\nincurred by the estate.” §503(b)(B)(i). Thus, for postpeti­\ntion taxes to be entitled to priority under §507 and eligible\nfor the §1222(a)(2)(A) exception, the taxes must be “in­\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncurred by the estate.”\n                              B\n   Petitioners Lynwood and Brenda Hall petitioned for\nbankruptcy under Chapter 12 and sold their farm shortly\nthereafter. Petitioners initially proposed a plan of reor­\nganization under which they would pay off outstanding\nliabilities with proceeds from the sale. The Internal Reve­\nnue Service (IRS) objected, asserting a federal income tax\nof $29,000 on the capital gains from the farm sale.\n   Petitioners amended their proposal to treat the income\ntax as a general, unsecured claim to be paid to the extent\nfunds were available, with the unpaid balance discharged.\nAgain the IRS objected. Taxes on income from a postpeti­\ntion farm sale, the IRS argued, remain the debtors’ inde­\npendent responsibility because they are neither collectible\nnor dischargeable in bankruptcy.\n   The Bankruptcy Court sustained the objection. The\ncourt reasoned that because a Chapter 12 estate is not a\nseparate taxable entity under the Internal Revenue Code\n(IRC), see 26 U. S. C. §§1398, 1399, it cannot “incur” taxes\nfor purposes of 11 U. S. C. §503(b).\n   The District Court reversed, expressing doubt that IRC\nprovisions are relevant to interpreting §503(b). Based on\nits reading of legislative history, the District Court deter­\nmined that Congress intended §1222(a)(2)(A) to extend to\npetitioners’ postpetition taxes.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.\n617 F. 3d 1161 (2010). The Court of Appeals held that the\nChapter 12 estate does not “incur” the postpetition federal\nincome taxes for purposes of §503(b) because it is not a\nseparate taxable entity under the IRC, and noted that\nCongress repeatedly has indicated the relevance of the\nIRC’s taxable entity provisions to the Bankruptcy Code.\nAlthough “sympathetic” to the view that the postpetition\ntax liabilities should be dischargeable, the Court of Ap­\n4                    HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\npeals held that “the operative language simply failed to\nmake its way into the statute.” Id., at 1167. The Court of\nAppeals concluded that because the taxes do not qualify\nunder §503(b), they are not priority claims in the plan\neligible for the §1222(a)(2)(A) exception.\n   Judge Paez dissented, siding with a sister Circuit\nthat had concluded that Congress intended §1222(a)(2)(A)\nto extend to such postpetition federal income taxes. We\ngranted certiorari to resolve the split of authority.1 564\nU. S. ___ (2011).\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n   Our resolution of this case turns on the meaning of a\nphrase in §503(b) of the Bankruptcy Code: “incurred by\nthe estate.” The parties agree that §1222(a)(2)(A) applies\nonly to priority claims collectible in the bankruptcy plan\nand that postpetition federal income taxes so qualify only\nif they constitute a “tax . . . incurred by the estate.”\n§503(b)(B)(i).\n   The phrase “incurred by the estate” bears a plain and\nnatural reading. See FCC v. AT&T Inc., 562 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 5) (“When a statute does not define a\nterm, we typically ‘give the phrase its ordinary meaning’ ”).\nTo “incur,” one must “suffer or bring on oneself (a liability\nor expense).” Black’s Law Dictionary 836 (9th ed. 2009);\nsee also Webster’s Third New International Dictionary\n1146 (1976) (“to . . . become liable or subject to: bring down\nupon oneself ”); Random House Dictionary 722 (1966) (“to\nbecome liable or subject to through one’s own action; bring\nupon oneself ”). A tax “incurred by the estate” is a tax for\nwhich the estate itself is liable.\n——————\n    1 CompareIn re Dawes, 652 F. 3d 1236 (CA10 2011), and 617 F. 3d\n1161 (CA9 2010) (case below), with Knudsen v. IRS, 581 F. 3d 696 (CA8\n2009) (postpetition federal taxes are eligible for the §1222(a)(2)(A)\nexception and thus dischargeable).\n                    Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   As the IRC makes clear, only certain estates are liable\nfor federal income taxes. Title 26 U. S. C. §§1398 and\n1399 address taxation in bankruptcy and define the divi­\nsion of responsibilities for the payment of taxes between\nthe estate and the debtor on a chapter-by-chapter basis.\nSection 1398 provides that when an individual debtor files\nfor Chapter 7 or 11 bankruptcy, the estate shall be liable\nfor taxes. In such cases, the trustee files a separate re­\nturn on the estate’s behalf and “[t]he tax” on “the taxable\nincome of the estate . . . shall be paid by the trustee.”\n§1398(c)(1); see also §6012(b)(4) (“Returns of . . . an estate\nof an individual under chapter 7 or 11 . . . shall be made\nby the fiduciary thereof ”). Section 1399 provides that\n“[e]xcept in any case to which section 1398 applies, no\nseparate taxable entity shall result from the commence­\nment of a [bankruptcy] case.” In Chapter 12 and 13 cases,\nthen, there is no separately taxable estate. The debtor—\nnot the trustee—is generally liable for taxes and files the\nonly tax return. See In re Lindsey, 142 B. R. 447, 448\n(Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Okla. 1992) (“It is clear that, pursuant\nto 26 U. S. C. §1398 and 1399, the standing Chapter 12\ntrustee neither files a return nor pays federal income\ntax”); cf. infra, at 15 (discussing special trustee duties in\ncorporate-debtor cases).\n   These provisions suffice to resolve this case: Chapter 12\nestates are not taxable entities. Petitioners, not the estate\nitself, are required to file the tax return and are liable for\nthe taxes resulting from their postpetition farm sale. The\npostpetition federal income tax liability is not “incurred by\nthe estate” and thus is neither collectible nor discharge­\nable in the Chapter 12 plan.2\n——————\n  2 Because we hold that the postpetition federal income taxes at issue\n\nare not collectible in the plan because they are not “incurred by the\nestate,” we need not address the Government’s broader alternative\nargument that Chapter 12 plans are exclusively limited to prepetition\nclaims.\n6                  HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                                B\n\n  Our reading of “incurred by the estate” as informed by\nthe IRC’s separate taxable entity rules draws support\nfrom a related provision of the Bankruptcy Code, 11\nU. S. C. §346, and its longstanding interplay with 26\nU. S. C. §§1398 and 1399. That relationship illustrates\nthat from the inception of the current Bankruptcy Code,\nCongress has specified on a chapter-by-chapter basis\nwhich estates are separately taxable and therefore liable\nfor taxes. That relationship also refutes the dissent’s\nsuggestion that applying such rules is an incongruous\nimportation of “tax law” unconnected to “bankruptcy\nprinciples (as Congress understood them).” Post, at 8–9\n(opinion of BREYER, J.). And it reinforces the reason-\nableness of our view that whether an estate “incurs”\ntaxes under §503(b) turns on such chapter-by-chapter\ndistinctions.\n  In the original Bankruptcy Code, Congress included a\nprovision, §346, that set out a chapter-specific division of\ntax liabilities between the estate and the debtor. Bank­\nruptcy Reform Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 2565. Section\n346(b)(1) provided that in an individual-debtor Chapter 7\nor 11 bankruptcy, “any income of the estate may be taxed\nunder a State or local law imposing a tax . . . only to the\nestate, and may not be taxed to such individual.” 92 Stat.\n2565 (emphasis added); see also 11 Collier on Bankruptcy\n¶TX12.03[5][b][i], p. TX12–21 (16th ed. 2011) (hereinafter\nCollier) (§346(b) “provided that in a case under chapter 7\n[or] 11 . . . the estate of an individual is a taxable entity”).\nSection 346(d) provided, meanwhile, that in a Chapter 13\nbankruptcy, “any income of the estate or the debtor may\nbe taxed under a State or local law imposing a tax . . . only\nto the debtor, and may not be taxed to the estate.” 92 Stat.\n2566 (emphasis added). Congress thus established that\nthe estate in an individual-debtor Chapter 7 or 11 bank­\nruptcy is a separate taxable entity; the estate in a Chapter\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

In\nthe Bankruptcy Tax Act of 1980, 94 Stat. 3397, Congress\nenacted 26 U. S. C. §§1398 and 1399. Section 1398 of the\nIRC, much like §346(b) in the Bankruptcy Code, estab­\nlished that the estate is separately taxable in individual­\ndebtor Chapter 7 or 11 cases. Section 1399 of the IRC,\nmuch like §346(d) in the Bankruptcy Code, clarified that\n——————\n   3 For those of us for whom it is relevant, the legislative history\n\nconfirms that Congress viewed §346 as defining which estates were\nseparate taxable entities. See H. R. Rep. No. 95–595, p. 275 (1977) (here­\ninafter H. R. Rep.) (“A threshold issue to be considered when a debtor\nfiles a petition under title 11 is whether the estate created . . . should\nbe treated as a separate taxable entity”); id., at 334 (“Subsection (d)\nindicates that the estate in a chapter 13 case is not a separate taxable\nentity”); accord, S. Rep. No. 95–989, p. 45 (1978) (hereinafter S. Rep.);\nH. R. Rep., at 335 (noting “the creation of the estate of an individual\nunder chapters 7 or 11 of title 11 as a separate taxable entity”); accord,\nS. Rep., at 46.\n   The Reports also tie separate taxable entity status to the responsibil­\nity to file returns and pay taxes. See H. R. Rep., at 277 (“If the estate\nis a separate taxable entity, then the representative of the estate is\nresponsible for filing any income tax returns and paying any taxes due\nby the estate”); id., at 278 (“When the estate is not a separate taxable\nentity, then taxation of the debtor should be conducted on the same\nbasis as if no petition were filed”).\n   4 A dispute over Committee jurisdiction led to the insertion of “State\n\nor local” before each mention of “law imposing a tax.” Compare H. R.\n8200, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., §346 (1977), with §346, 92 Stat. 2565.\nNonetheless, the House Report underscored that the policy behind §346\napplied equally to federal taxes:\n“[T]here is a strong bankruptcy policy that these provisions apply\nequally to Federal, State, and local taxes. However, in order to avoid\nany possible jurisdictional conflict with the Ways and Means Commit­\ntee over the applicability of these provisions to Federal taxes, H. R.\n8200 has been amended to make the sections inapplicable to Federal\ntaxes. The amendment . . . will obviate the need for a sequential\nreferral of the bill to Ways and Means, which will be considering these\nprovisions and other bankruptcy-related tax law later in this Con­\ngress.” H. R. Rep., at 275.\n8                 HALL v.

Section 346 now expressly aligns its assignment\nof state or local taxes with the rules for federal taxes,\nproviding in relevant part:\n        “(a) Whenever the Internal Revenue Code of 1986\n    provides that a separate taxable estate or entity is\n    created in a case concerning a debtor under this title,\n    and the income . . . of such estate shall be taxed to or\n    claimed by the estate, a separate taxable estate is also\n    created for purposes of any State and local law impos­\n    ing a tax on or measured by income and such income\n    . . . shall be taxed to or claimed by the estate and may\n    not be taxed to or claimed by the debtor.\n        “(b) Whenever the Internal Revenue Code of 1986\n    provides that no separate taxable estate shall be cre­\n    ated in a case concerning a debtor under this title,\n    and the income . . . of an estate shall be taxed to or\n    claimed by the debtor, such income . . . shall be taxed\n    to or claimed by the debtor under a State or local law\n    imposing a tax on or measured by income and may not\n    be taxed to or claimed by the estate.” (Emphasis added.)\nThus, whenever the estate is separately taxable under\nfederal income tax law, that “is also” the case under state\nor local income tax law, §346(a), and vice versa, §346(b).\nAnd given that the Bankruptcy Code instructs that the as­\nsignment of state or local tax liabilities shall turn on the\nIRC’s separate taxable entity rules, there is parity in\nturning to such rules in assigning federal tax liabilities.\n  In the same Act, Congress added §1222(a)(2)(A). Section\n1222(a)(2)(A) carves out an exception to the ordinary\npriority classification scheme. But §1222(a)(2)(A) did not\npurport to redefine which claims are otherwise entitled to\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npriority, much less alter the underlying division of tax\nliability between the estate and the debtor in Chapter 12\ncases. “We assume that Congress is aware of existing law\nwhen it passes legislation,” Miles v. Apex Marine Corp.,\n498 U. S. 19, 32 (1990), and the existing law at the enact­\nment of §1222(a)(2)(A) indicated that an estate’s liability\nfor taxes turned on chapter-by-chapter separate taxable\nentity rules.\n                              C\n   The statutory structure further reinforces our holding\nthat petitioners’ postpetition income taxes are not “in­\ncurred by the estate.” As a leading bankruptcy treatise\nand lower courts recognize, “[b]ecause chapter 12 was\nmodeled on chapter 13, and because so many of the provi­\nsions are identical, chapter 13 cases construing provisions\ncorresponding to chapter 12 provisions may be relied on as\nauthority in chapter 12 cases.” 8 Collier ¶1200.01[5], at\n1200–10; In re Lopez, 372 B. R. 40, 45, n. 13 (Bkrtcy. App.\nPanel CA9 2007); Justice v. Valley Nat. Bank, 849 F. 2d\n1078, 1083 (CA8 1988). We agree. Section 1322(a)(2), like\n§1222(a)(2), requires full payment of “all claims entitled to\npriority under section 507” under the plan. Both provi­\nsions cross-reference the same section of the Code, §507,\nand in turn, the same subsection, §503(b). Both are treat­\ned alike by IRC §§1398 and 1399. Whether postpetition\ntaxes qualify under §503(b) in Chapter 13 thus sheds light\non whether they so qualify in petitioners’ Chapter 12 case.\n   Bankruptcy courts and commentators have reasoned\nthat postpetition income taxes are not “incurred by the\nestate” under §503(b) because “a tax on postpetition in­\ncome of the debtor or of the chapter 13 estate is not a\nliability of the chapter 13 estate; it is a liability of the\ndebtor alone.” 8 Collier ¶1305.02[1], at 1305–5 and 1305–\n10                   HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n6.5 For over a decade, the Government has likewise hewed\nto the position that “since post-petition tax liabilities are,\nin Chapter 13 cases, incurred by the debtor, rather than\nthe bankruptcy estate, characterizing such liabilities as\nadministrative expenses is inconsistent with section 503.”\nIRS Chief Counsel Advice No. 200113027, p. 6 (Mar. 30,\n2001), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">307746</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *4; see also Internal Revenue\nManual §5.9.10.9.2(3) (2006) (hereinafter IRM); IRS Liti­\ngation Guideline Memorandum GL–26, p. 9 (Dec. 16,\n1996), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">33107107</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *6. We see no reason to depart\nfrom those established understandings. To “ ‘hold the\nChapter 13 estate liable for [a] tax when it does not exist\nas a taxable entity defies common sense as well as Con­\ngress’ intent.’ ” In re Whall, 391 B. R. 1, 4 (Bkrtcy. Ct.\nMass. 2008). The same holds true for a Chapter 12 estate.\n   A provision in Chapter 13 confirms that postpetition\nincome taxes fall outside §503(b). Section 1305(a)(1) pro­\nvides that “[a] proof of claim may be filed by any entity\nthat holds a claim against the debtor . . . for taxes that\nbecome payable to a governmental unit while the case is\npending.” (Emphasis added.) That provision gives holders\nof postpetition claims the option of collecting postpetition\ntaxes within the bankruptcy case—an option that the\nGovernment would never need to invoke if postpetition tax\nliabilities were already collectible inside the bankruptcy.\nAccordingly, lest we render §1305 “ ‘inoperative or super­\nfluous,’ ” Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88, 101 (2004), it is clear\nthat postpetition income taxes are not automatically col­\nlectible in a Chapter 13 plan and, a fortiori, are not admin­\nistrative expenses under §503(b).\n   It follows that postpetition income taxes are not auto­\n——————\n  5 See, e.g., In re Maxfield, No. 04–60355, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2105953</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *5–*6\n\n(Bkrtcy.

See Cohen v. de la\nCruz, 523 U. S. 213, 221 (1998) (the Court “ ‘will not read\nthe Bankruptcy Code to erode past bankruptcy practice\nabsent a clear indication that Congress intended such a\ndeparture’ ”). Chapter 13 filings outnumber Chapter 12\nfilings six-hundred-fold. See U. S. Bankruptcy Courts—\nCases Commenced During the 12-Month Period Ending\nSeptember 30, 2011 (Table F–2), http://www.uscourts.gov/\nStatistics/BankruptcyStatistics.aspx (estimating 676 and\n——————\n   6 The dissent suggests that Chapter 12 can be distinguished from\n\nChapter 13 because Chapter 12 bankruptcies tend to be longer, such\nthat the treatment of taxes is more “important.” Post, at 13. As\na practical matter, it is not clear that Chapter 12 bankruptcies are\nsubstantially longer. Compare Brief for Neil E. Harl. et al. as Amici\nCuriae 33 (median Chapter 12 case duration is under 8 months) with\nTr. of Oral Arg. 49 (“on average we’re talking about 4 months in a\nchapter 13 case”). In any event, there is no indication that Congress\nintended any difference in duration—if it anticipated a difference at\nall—to flip the characterization of postpetition income taxes from one\nchapter to the other. Nor does the absence of a §1305 equivalent in\nChapter 12 justify shoehorning postpetition taxes into §503(b), as the\ndissent argues. That Chapter 12 lacks a provision allowing such taxes\nto be brought inside the plan only clarifies that such taxes fall outside\nof the plan.\n   The dissent alternatively suggests that it “do[es] not see the serious\nharm in treating the relevant taxes as ‘administrative expenses’ in both\nChapter 12 and Chapter 13 cases.” Post, at 13–14. The “harm” is to\nsettled understandings in Chapter 13 to the contrary. The “harm” is\nalso to §1305; to avoid rendering §1305 a nullity, the dissent recasts the\nprovision as applicable not to all “taxes that become payable . . . while\nthe case is pending,” but only those payable “after the Chapter 13 Plan\nis confirmed.” Post, at 14. The dissent does not claim, however, that\nthis was Congress’ intent for §1305, as Congress’ choice of words would\nbe exceedingly overbroad if it were. And the dissent’s novel reading\ncontravenes ample Chapter 13 authority recognizing no such limitation\non §1305’s scope. E.g., 8 Collier ¶1305.02 (citing cases).\n12                     HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n417,503 annual Chapter 12 and 13 filings, respectively)\n(as visited May 14, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court’s\ncase file). Yet adopting petitioners’ reading of §503(b)\nwould mean that, in every Chapter 13 case, the Govern­\nment could ignore §1305 and expect priority payment of\npostpetition income taxes in every plan.\n  At bottom, “identical words and phrases within the\nsame statute should normally be given the same mean­\ning.” Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Services, Inc., 551\nU. S. 224, 232 (2007). Absent any indication that Con­\ngress intended a conflict between two closely related chap­\nters, we decline to create one.7\n                             III\n   Petitioners and the dissent advance several arguments\nfor why the postpetition income taxes at issue should be\nconsidered “incurred by the estate,” notwithstanding the\nIRC’s separate taxable entity rules. But none provides\nsufficient reason to overcome the statute’s plain language,\ncontext, and structure.\n   Petitioners primarily argue that “incurred by the estate”\nhas a temporal meaning. Petitioners emphasize that the\nestate only comes into existence after a bankruptcy peti­\ntion is filed. Thus, they reason, taxes “incurred by the\nestate” refers to all taxes “incurred postpetition,” regard­\nless of whether the estate is liable for the tax and regard­\nless of the chapter under which a case is filed. Although\nall taxes “incurred by the estate” are necessarily incurred\n\n——————\n  7 IRS  manuals dating back to 1998 indicate that the Government did\nnot view postpetition federal income taxes as collectible in an individ-\nual debtor’s Chapter 12 plan, even when that view was adverse to its\ninterests. See IRM §25.17.12.9.3 (2004); id., §25.17.12.9.3(1) (2002);\nid., §5.9, ch. 10.8(4) (1999); id., §5.9, ch. 10.8(4) (1998). Until the en­\nactment of 11 U. S. C. §1222(a)(2)(A), treating such taxes as priority\nclaims in the plan would have assured the Government of full payment\nbefore or at the time of the plan.\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npostpetition, not all taxes incurred postpetition are “in­\ncurred by the estate.” That an estate cannot incur liability\nuntil it exists does not mean that every liability that\narises after that point automatically becomes the estate’s\nliability. And there is no textual basis to focus on when\nthe liability is incurred, as opposed to whether the liability\nis incurred “by the estate.”\n   Alternately, petitioners contend that a tax should be\nconsidered “incurred by the estate” so long as it is payable\nout of estate assets. Income from postpetition sales of\nfarm assets is considered property of the estate. See\n§1207(a). Petitioners argue that even if the debtor—and\nnot the estate—is liable for a tax, the tax is still “incurred\nby the estate” because the funds the debtor uses to pay the\ntax are property of the estate. But that too strains the\ntext beyond what it can bear. To concede that someone\nother than the estate is liable for filing the return and\npaying the tax, and yet maintain that the estate is the one\nthat has “incurred” the tax, defies the ordinary meaning of\n“incur” as bringing a liability upon oneself.\n   The dissent, echoing both of these points, urges that\nwe “simply . . . consider the debtor and estate as merged.”\nPost, at 11. “The English language,” the dissent reasons,\n“permits this reading” and “do[es] not require” our read­\ning. Post, at 8–9. But any reading of “tax . . . incurred by\nthe estate” that is contingent on merging the debtor and\nestate—despite Congress’ longstanding efforts to distin-\nguish between when tax liabilities are borne by the debtor\nor borne by the estate—is not a natural construction of the\nstatute as written.\n   Moreover, these alternative readings create a conflict\nbetween §503(b) and §346(b). Petitioners consider postpe­\ntition state or local income taxes, like federal income\ntaxes, to be “incurred by the estate” under §503(b). See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 4–5. But §346(b) requires that such taxes\nbe borne by the Chapter 12 debtor, not the estate. It is\n14                    HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nimplausible to maintain that taxes are “incurred by the\nestate” when §346(b) specifically prohibits such taxes from\nbeing “taxed to or claimed by the estate.”\n   To buttress their counterintuitive readings of the text,\npetitioners and the dissent suggest that there is a long\nhistory of treating postpetition taxes as administrative\nexpenses entitled to priority. Both point to two legislative\nReports accompanying the 1978 enactment of §503. But\nneither snippet from which they quote is inconsistent with\ntoday’s holding,8 and we have cautioned against “allowing\nambiguous legislative history to muddy clear statutory\nlanguage.” Milner v. Department of Navy, 562 U. S. ___,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 9).\n   Petitioners also point to cases suggesting that postpeti­\ntion taxes were treated as administrative expenses. E.g.,\nUnited States v. Noland, 517 U. S. 535, 543 (1996) (cor­\nporate Chapter 11 debtor); Nicholas v. United States,\n384 U. S. 678, 687–688 (1966) (corporate Chapter XI case\nunder predecessor Bankruptcy Act). But those cases\ninvolve corporate debtors and are therefore inapposite.\nAmong estates that are not separately taxable, those\ninvolving corporate debtors have long been singled out by\n\n\n——————\n   8 The House Report stated—after noting that, in addition to prepeti­\n\ntion taxes, “certain other taxes are entitled to priority”—that “[t]axes\narising from the operation of the estate after bankruptcy are entitled to\npriority as administrative expenses.” H. R. Rep., at 193. That is still\ntrue. Many taxes arising after bankruptcy, as in individual-debtor\nChapter 7 or 11 cases, remain entitled to priority as administrative\nexpenses. The Senate Report, meanwhile, stated: “In general, adminis­\ntrative expenses include taxes which the trustee incurs in administer­\ning the debtor’s estate, including taxes on capital gains from sales of\nproperty by the trustee and taxes on income earned by the estate during\nthe case.” S. Rep., at 66 (emphasis added). That likewise remains true.\nAdministrative expenses still include income taxes that “the trustee,”\nas opposed to the debtor, has incurred—again, as in individual-debtor\nChapter 7 or 11 cases.\n                      Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                       15\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nCongress for special responsibilities.9 See H. R. Rep., at\n277 (even “[i]f the estate is not a separate taxable entity,”\nadministrative responsibility can “var[y] according to the\nnature of the debtor”). Although estates of corporate\ndebtors are not separate taxable entities under 26 U. S. C.\n§§1398 and 1399, the IRC requires a trustee that “has\npossession of or holds title to all or substantially all the\nproperty or business of a corporation” to “make the return\nof income for such corporation.” §6012(b)(3). In effect,\nCongress provided that the trustee in a corporate-debtor\ncase may shoulder responsibility that parallels that borne\nby the trustee of a separate taxable entity. In any event,\npetitioners do not deny that neither the separate taxable\nentity provisions nor the special provisions for corporate\ndebtors apply to them.\n  Finally, petitioners and the dissent contend that the\npurpose of 11 U. S. C. §1222(a)(2)(A) was to provide debt­\nors with robust relief from tax debts, relying on state­\nments by a single Senator on unenacted bills introduced in\nyears preceding the enactment. See Brief for Petitioners\n23–36. They argue that deeming §1222(a)(2)(A) inapplica­\nble to their postpetition income taxes would undermine\nthat purpose and confine the exception to prepetition\ntaxes. But we need not resolve here what other claims, if\nany, are covered by §1222(a)(2)(A).10 Whatever the 2005\n——————\n    9 The original §346 established that the estate of a corporate debtor\n\nis not a separate taxable entity, but nonetheless provided that “the\ntrustee shall make any [State or local] tax return otherwise required\n. . . to be filed by or on behalf of such . . . corporation.” §§346(c)(1)–(2),\n92 Stat. 2565, 2566. The current §346 similarly states, in the same\nprovision deeming the debtor taxable when there is no separate taxable\nestate, that “[t]he trustee shall make such tax returns of income of\ncorporations . . . . The estate shall be liable for any [State or local] tax\nimposed on such corporation.” §346(b).\n    10 The dissent opines that employment taxes must be administrative\n\nexpenses “incurred by the estate” because, in its view, they “do not\nfit easily” within the category of administrative expenses under\n16                   HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nCongress’ intent with respect to §1222(a)(2)(A), that provi­\nsion merely carved out an exception to the pre-existing\npriority classification scheme. The exception could only\napply to claims “entitled to priority under section 507” in\nthe first place. That pre-existing scheme was in turn\npremised on antecedent, decades-old understandings\nabout the scope of §503(b) and the division of tax liabilities\nbetween estates and debtors. See Dewsnup v. Timm, 502\nU. S. 410, 419 (1992) (“When Congress amends the bank­\nruptcy laws, it does not write ‘on a clean slate’ ”). If Con­\ngress wished to alter these background norms, it needed to\nenact a provision to enable postpetition income taxes to be\ncollected in the Chapter 12 plan in the first place.\n  The dissent concludes otherwise by an inverted analysis.\nRather than demonstrate that such claims were treated as\n§507 priority claims in the first place, the dissent begins\nwith the single Senator’s stated purpose for the exception\nto that priority scheme. Post, at 7. It then reasons back­\nwards from there, and in the process upsets background\nnorms in both Chapters 12 and 13.\n  Certainly, there may be compelling policy reasons for\ntreating postpetition income tax liabilities as discharge-\nable. But if Congress intended that result, it did not so\nprovide in the statute. Given the statute’s plain language,\ncontext, and structure, it is not for us to rewrite the stat­\nute, particularly in this complex terrain of interconnected\nprovisions and exceptions enacted over nearly three dec­\nades. Petitioners’ position threatens ripple effects beyond\nthis individual case for debtors in Chapter 13 and the\nbroader bankruptcy scheme that we need not invite.

Consistent with the chapter’s pur-\nposes, Congress amended §1222(a) of the Code to enable the\ndebtor to treat certain capital gains tax claims as ordinary\nunsecured claims. 11 U. S. C. §1222(a)(2)(A). The Court’s\nholding prevents the Amendment from carrying out this\nbasic objective. I would read the statute differently, inter-\npreting it in a way that, in my view, both is consistent\nwith its language and allows the Amendment better to\nachieve its purposes.\n                            I\n\n                            A\n\n  Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code helps indebted\nfamily farmers (and fishermen) keep their farms by mak-\ning commitments to pay those debts (in part) out of future\nincome. An eligible farmer whose debts exceed his assets\nmay enter Chapter 12 bankruptcy, at which point he must\ndevelop a detailed Plan setting forth how he will pay his\ndebts. That Plan must satisfy certain statutory criteria.\n§§1221, 1222, 1225.\n  A brief overview of these requirements helps to illumi-\n2                 HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nnate what is at stake in this case. Roughly speaking, the\nchapter requires that a holder of a secured claim receive\nthe full amount of that claim up to the value of the collat-\neral securing the loan. The claim may be paid over an\nextended period. If the claim exceeds the value of the\ncollateral, the creditor is given an unsecured claim in the\nremainder. §§506(a), 1225(a)(5).\n   The holder of a §507 priority claim (a category that\nincludes, among other things, domestic support obliga-\ntions, debts for taxes incurred before filing the bankruptcy\npetition, and administrative expenses) must receive the\nfull amount of the priority claim in deferred cash pay-\nments paid over the life of the Plan. §1222(a)(2).\n   The holder of an ordinary unsecured claim—i.e., an\nunsecured claim of a kind not listed in §507—may receive\nat least a partial payment from the amount left over after\nthe payment of the secured and §507 priority claims. This\namount may well be more than zero, for the Plan must\nprovide that the farmer will devote all “disposable income”\n(as defined by §1225(b)(2)) or property of equivalent value\nto the repayment of his debts over the next three years\n(sometimes extended to five years). §§1222(c), 1225(b)(1).\nAnd that amount must prove sufficient to provide the un-\nsecured creditor with no less than that creditor would re-\nceive in a Chapter 7 liquidation. §1225(a)(4).\n   Once the farmer completes his Plan payments, he will\nreceive a discharge even if his payments did not fully\nsatisfy all unsecured claims. The Code does not, however,\npermit all debts to be discharged. There are categories\nof nondischargeable debts (including, for example, secured\nclaims), which creditors can pursue after bankruptcy.\n§1228(a).\n   For present purposes, it is important to understand that\nif the debtor owes too much money to his §507 priority\ncreditors, he may not have sufficient assets or future\nincome to pay all his secured creditors and his §507 prior-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nity creditors while leaving enough funds over to guarantee\nunsecured creditors the minimum amounts that Chapter\n12 requires. If so, the farmer may not be able to proceed\nunder Chapter 12. See §§1225(a)(1), (6) (bankruptcy court\nwill not confirm Plan unless it satisfies statutory criteria\nand debtor will be able to make good on his commitments\nunder the Plan).\n   It is also important to understand that the same kind of\ninsufficient-assets-and-income problem might occur where\nthe debtor owes the Government a large post-petition tax\ndebt. In general, postpetition claims are not part of the\nbankruptcy proceedings. See 7 Norton Bankruptcy Law\nand Practice §135:14 (3d ed. 2011) (hereinafter Norton).\nUnless the Government’s debt falls within an exception to\nthis general rule, bankruptcy law would leave the Gov-\nernment to collect its postpetition claim outside of bank-\nruptcy as best it could. Again, the result will be to leave\nthe farmer with fewer assets and income to devote to his\nChapter 12 Plan—perhaps to the point where he cannot\nproceed under Chapter 12 at all.\n                           B\n  With this general summary in mind, it is easier to un-\nderstand the significance of the question this case pre-\nsents. The question arises out of an amendment to a\nChapter 12 provision. The provision as amended says:\n    “Contents of plan\n       “(a) The plan shall—\n         .           .           .         .          .\n       “(2) provide for the full payment, in deferred cash\n    payments, of all claims entitled to priority under sec-\n    tion 507, unless—\n       “(A) the claim is a claim owed to a governmental\n    unit that arises as a result of the sale, transfer, ex-\n    change, or other disposition of any farm asset used in\n    the debtor’s farming operation, in which case the\n4                  HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n    claim shall be treated as an unsecured claim that is\n    not entitled to priority under section 507, but the debt\n    shall be treated in such manner only if the debtor re-\n    ceives a discharge; or\n      “(B) the holder of a particular claim agrees to a dif-\n    ferent treatment of that claim.” §1222(a) (emphasis\n    added).\nThe Amendment consists of subparagraph (A).\n  At first blush, the Amendment seems to relegate the\ncapital gains tax collector to the status of an ordinary\nunsecured creditor. See ibid. (exception applies to claims\n“owed to a governmental unit that arises as a result of the\nsale . . . of any farm asset”). If, as petitioners claim, that\nis so, then it is unlikely that such a debt could stop a\nfarmer from proceeding under Chapter 12, since its treat-\nment as an ordinary unsecured claim means that the\nfarmer will not necessarily have to pay the debt in full.\n  But if the Government and the majority are right, then\nthe capital gains tax falls outside the category of §507\npriority claims—and therefore falls outside the scope of\nthe Amendment; in fact, it falls outside the bankruptcy\nproceeding altogether. And the Government then might\nwell be able to collect the debt in full outside the bank-\nruptcy proceeding—even if doing so would reduce the\nfarmer’s assets and future income to the point where the\nfarmer would not be able to proceed under Chapter 12.\nThe question before us is whether we must interpret the\nAmendment in a way that could bring about this result.\n                              C\n                              1\n   Congress did not intend this result. In a significant\nnumber of instances a Chapter 12 farmer, in order to\nhave enough money to pay his creditors, might have to sell\nfarmland or other farm assets at a price that would give\nrise to considerable capital gains taxes (particularly if the\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfamily has held the land or assets for many years). If the\nresulting tax debt were treated as a §507 priority claim,\nthen it might well absorb much of the money raised to the\npoint where (depending upon the size of his other debts)\nthe farmer might be unable to proceed under Chapter 12.\nThe Amendment accordingly seeks to place the tax author-\nities farther back in the creditor queue, requiring them,\nlike ordinary unsecured creditors, to seek payment from\nthe funds that remain after the §507 priority creditors\n(and secured claim holders) have been paid.\n   The Amendment’s chief legislative sponsor, Senator\nCharles Grassley, explained this well when he told the\nSenate:\n    “Under current law, farmers often face a crushing tax\n    liability if they need to sell livestock or land in order\n    to reorganize their business affairs. . . . [H]igh taxes\n    have caused farmers to lose their farms. Under the\n    bankruptcy code, the I. R. S. must be paid in full for\n    any tax liabilities generated during a bankruptcy re-\n    organization. If the farmer can’t pay the I. R. S. in\n    full, then he can’t keep his farm. This isn’t sound pol-\n    icy. Why should the I. R. S. be allowed to veto a\n    farmer’s reorganization plan?         [The Amendment]\n    takes this power away from the I. R. S. by reducing\n    the priority of taxes during proceedings. This will free\n    up capital for investment in the farm, and help farm-\n    ers stay in the business of farming.” 145 Cong. Rec.\n    1113 (1999).\nSee also 14A J. Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation\n§54:61, p. 11 (Oct. 2011 Supp.) (“This provision attempts\nto mitigate the tax expense often incurred by farmers who\nhave significant taxable capital gains or depreciation re-\ncapture when their low basis farm assets are foreclosed,\nsold, or otherwise disposed of by their creditors”).\n6                 HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n                               2\n    The majority, following the Government’s suggestion,\ninterprets the relevant language in a way that denies the\nAmendment its intended effect. It holds that the only\nincome tax claims to which §507 accords priority are\nclaims for taxes due for years prior to the taxable year in\nwhich the farmer filed for bankruptcy. (We shall call\nthese “prepetition tax claims.”) In the majority’s view,\n§507 does not cover income tax liabilities that arise during\nthe year of filing or during the Chapter 12 proceedings.\n(We shall call these “postpetition tax claims.”) Ante, at 4–\n5; see Brief for United States 8 (the Amendment “provides\nfarmers relief from [only] those tax claims that are other-\nwise entitled to priority under 11 U. S. C. 507(a)(8), namely\npre-petition claims arising from the sale of farm as-\nsets”); Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Pro-\ntection Act of 2005, §705(1)(A), 119 Stat. 126 (amending\n§507(a)(8) to clarify that it only covers income tax claims\nfor taxable years that end on or before the date of the\nfiling of the bankruptcy petition).\n    The majority then observes that the Amendment creates\nan exception only in respect to §507 priority claims.\n§1222(a) (“The plan shall . . . provide for the full payment\n. . . of all claims entitled to priority under section 507,\nunless . . . .” (Emphasis added.)). Ante, at 2. Thus, if\n(without the Amendment) §507 would not cover postpeti-\ntion capital gains taxes in the first place, the Amendment\n(creating only a §507 exception) cannot affect postpeti-\ntion tax claims. An exception from nothing amounts to\nnothing.\n    Consequently, the majority concludes that postpetition\ntax claims fall outside the bankruptcy proceeding entirely;\nthe tax authorities can collect them as if they were ordi-\nnary tax debts; and the Government’s efforts to collect\nthem can lead to the very results (blocking the use of\nChapter 12) that the Amendment sought to avoid.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   Therein lies the problem. These results are the very\nopposite of what Congress intended. Congress did not\nwant to relegate to ordinary-unsecured-claim status only\nprepetition tax claims, i.e., tax claims that accrued well\nbefore the Chapter 12 proceedings began. Rather, Con-\ngress was concerned about the effect on the farmer of\ncollecting capital gains tax debts that arose during (and\nwere connected with) the Chapter 12 proceedings them-\nselves. See 145 Cong. Rec. 1113 (the Amendment will\nhave the effect of “reducing the priority of taxes during\nproceedings” (emphasis added) (statement of Sen. Grassley\nduring a failed attempt to enact the Amendment)); Hear-\ning on the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001 before the\nSenate Committee on the Judiciary, 107th Cong., 1st\nSess., 121 (statement of Sen. Grassley) (“[The Amend-\nment] also reduces the priority of capital gains tax liabili-\nties for farm assets sold as a part of a reorganization plan”\n(emphasis added)). The majority does not deny the im-\nportance of Congress’ objective. Rather, it feels compelled\nto hold that Congress put the Amendment in the wrong\nplace.\n                              II\n   Unlike the majority, I believe the relevant Bankruptcy\nCode language can be and is better interpreted in a way\nthat would give full effect to the Amendment. In particu-\nlar, the relevant language is better interpreted so that in\nthe absence of the Amendment §507 would cover these\npostpetition tax claims. Hence the Amendment creates an\nexception from what otherwise would amount to a §507\npriority claim. And it can take effect as written.\n   It is common ground that subsection (a)(2) of §507 cov-\ners, and gives §507 priority to, “administrative expenses\nallowed under section 503(b).” §507(a)(2) (2006 ed., Supp.\nIV). It is also common ground that the relevant defini-\ntional section, namely §503(b), defines allowed “adminis-\n8                  HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntrative expenses” as “including . . . any tax . . . incurred by\nthe estate.” §503(b)(1)(B)(i) (2006 ed.). But after this\npoint, we part company.\n   The majority believes that the words any tax “incur-\nred by the estate” cannot include postpetition taxes. It\nemphasizes that tax law does not treat a Chapter 12\nbankruptcy estate as a “separate taxable entity,” i.e., as\nseparate from the farmer-debtor for federal income tax\npurposes. 26 U. S. C. §§1398, 1399. This means that\nthere is just one entity—the debtor—for these purposes.\nAnd §346 of the Bankruptcy Code makes clear that any\nstate and local income tax liabilities incurred by a Chapter\n12 estate must also be taxed to the debtor. The majority\nsays that these provisions mean that only the debtor, and\nnot the estate, can “ ‘incu[r]’ ” taxes within the meaning of\n11 U. S. C. §503(b)(1)(B)(i). Ante, at 4–5.\n   In my view, however, these tax law circumstances do\nnot require the majority’s narrow reading of this Bank-\nruptcy Code provision. That is to say, the phrase tax\n“incurred by the [bankruptcy] estate” can include a tax\nincurred by the farmer while managing his estate in the\nmidst of his bankruptcy proceedings, i.e., between the time\nthe farmer files for Chapter 12 bankruptcy and the time\nthe bankruptcy court confirms the farmer’s Chapter 12\nPlan.\n   The bankruptcy estate is in existence during this time.\nCf. §1227(b) (property of the estate vests in the debtor\nat confirmation unless the Plan provides otherwise). The\nbankruptcy court has jurisdiction over the farmer’s assets\nduring this time. See §§541, 1207; 4 Norton §61:1, at 61–2\n(§541’s “broad definition of estate property . . . centralizes\nall of the estate’s assets under the jurisdiction of the bank-\nruptcy court”). And, as a matter of both the English lan-\nguage and bankruptcy principles, one can consider a tax\nliability that the farmer incurs during this period (such as\na capital gains tax arising from a sale of a portion of his\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfarm assets to raise funds for creditors) as a liability that,\nin a bankruptcy sense, the estate incurs.\n   The English language permits this reading of the phrase\ntax “incurred by the estate.” When the farmer, in the\nmidst of Chapter 12 proceedings, sells a portion of his\nfarm to raise money to help pay his creditors, one can\nsay, as a matter of English, that the bankruptcy estate has\n“incurred” the associated tax, even if it is ultimately taxed\nto the farmer, just as one can say that an employee who\nmakes purchases using a company credit card “incurs\ncosts” for which his employer is liable.\n   As a matter of general bankruptcy principles (as Con-\ngress understood them), the history of the 1978 Bank-\nruptcy Code revision is replete with statements to the effect\nthat “[t]axes arising from the operation of the estate after\nbankruptcy are entitled to priority as administrative\nexpenses.” H. R. Rep. No. 95–595, p. 193 (1977) (emphasis\nadded). See S. Rep. No. 95–1106, p. 13 (1978) (adminis-\ntrative expenses include “[t]axes incurred during the\nadministration of the estate” (emphasis added)); S. Rep.\nNo. 95–989, p. 66 (1978) (“In general, administrative\nexpenses include taxes which the trustee incurs in admin-\nistering the debtor’s estate, including taxes on capital gains\nfrom sales of property by the trustee and taxes on income\nearned by the estate during the case” (emphasis added));\n124 Cong. Rec. 32415 (1978) (“The amendment generally\nfollows the Senate amendment in providing expressly\nthat taxes incurred during the administration of the estate\nshare the first priority given to administrative expenses\ngenerally” (emphasis added)); id., at 34014 (Senate version\nof the joint floor statement saying exactly the same).\n   And importantly, as the majority concedes, ante, at 14–\n15, bankruptcy law treats taxes incurred by corporate\ndebtors while they are in bankruptcy proceedings as\n“tax[es] incurred by the estate,” even though the Tax Code\ndoes not treat the bankruptcy estate of a corporate debtor\n10                HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nas a “separate taxable entity.” See, e.g., United States v.\nNoland, 517 U. S. 535, 543 (1996) (treating Chapter 11\ncorporate debtor’s postpetition taxes as administrative\nexpenses); In re Pacific-Atlantic Trading Co., 64 F. 3d\n1292, 1298 (CA9 1995) (same); In re L. J. O’Neil Shoe Co.,\n64 F. 3d 1146, 1151–1152 (CA8 1995) (same); In re Hills-\nborough Holdings Corp., 156 B. R. 318, 320 (Bkrtcy. Ct.\nMD Fla. 1993) (“[A]dministrative expenses should include\ntaxes which the trustee, and, in Chapter 11 cases, the\nDebtor-in-Possession, incurs in administering the estate,\nincluding taxes based on capital gains from sales of prop-\nerty and taxes on income earned by the estate during the\ncase post-petition”).\n   Even though, as the majority says, corporate bankrupt-\ncies have some special features (in particular, a trustee in\na corporate bankruptcy is required to file the estate’s\nincome tax return), it is unclear why these features should\nhave any bearing on the definition of administrative\nexpenses.      See ante, at 15 (discussing 26 U. S. C.\n§6012(b)(3)). Indeed, in many corporate Chapter 11 bank-\nruptcies, there is no trustee, in which case the debtor-in-\npossession, just like an individual Chapter 12 debtor, must\nfile the tax return. See 11 U. S. C. §§1104, 1107 (2006 ed.\nand Supp. IV); 5 Norton §§91:3, 93:1 (typically, no trustee\nis appointed in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and the debtor-\nin-possession assumes most of the duties and powers of a\ntrustee, continuing in possession and managing the busi-\nness until the court determines, upon request of a party in\ninterest, that grounds exist for the appointment of a trus-\ntee); Holywell Corp. v. Smith, 503 U. S. 47, 54 (1992) (“As\nthe assignee of ‘all’ or ‘substantially all’ of the property\nof the corporate debtors, the trustee must file the re-\nturns that the corporate debtors would have filed had the\nplan not assigned their property to the trustee” (emphasis\nadded)).\n   Consequently, I can find no strong bankruptcy law\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nreason for treating taxes incurred by a corporate debtor\ndifferently from those incurred by an individual Chapter\n12 debtor. To the contrary, since corporations can file\nfor bankruptcy under Chapter 12, the majority’s argument\nimplies that the treatment of postpetition taxes in Chapter\n12 proceedings turns on whether the debtor happens to be\na corporation. See §101(18)(B) (2006 ed.) (defining “family\nfarmer” to include certain corporations); §109(f) (“Only\na family farmer or family fisherman with regular annual\nincome may be a debtor under chapter 12”); Brief for\nUnited States 26, n. 9 (“[T]he estate of a corporate (as\nopposed to individual) Chapter 12 debtor . . . could be\nviewed as incurring post-petition income taxes . . . collecti-\nble as administrative expenses . . . rather than outside the\nbankruptcy case as required for an individual Chapter 12\ndebtor”).\n   The majority does not point to any adverse consequences\nthat might arise were bankruptcy law to treat taxes in-\ncurred in administering the bankruptcy estate (i.e., taxes\nincurred after filing and before Plan confirmation) as\nadministrative expenses. The effect of doing so would\nsimply be to consider the debtor and estate as merged for\npurposes of determining which taxes fall within the Bank-\nruptcy’s Code’s definition of “administrative expenses,”\ni.e., determining for that purpose that the estate may\n“incur” tax liabilities on behalf of the whole (with the ul-\ntimate liability assigned to the debtor), much like a\nmarried couple filing jointly, 26 U. S. C. §6013(a), or an\naffiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated tax\nreturn, §1501. Cf. In re Lumara Foods of America, Inc., 50\nB. R. 809, 815 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ohio 1985) (describing the\nhistory of §503(b)(1)(B)(i) and concluding that “the eleva-\ntion [of a tax] to an administrative priority is dependent\nupon when the tax accrued”). In fact, the very tax provi-\nsions that separate the estate from the individual debtor\nin Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 proceedings, §§1398 and\n12                HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n1399, say that the Chapter 12 estate is not separate from\nthe debtor for tax purposes—a concept consistent, not at\nodds, with merging the two for this bankruptcy purpose.\n   Nor is the majority’s reading free of conceptual prob-\nlems. If we read the phrase tax “incurred by the estate”\nas excluding tax liabilities incurred while the farmer is in\nChapter 12 bankruptcy, we must read it as excluding not\nonly capital gains taxes but also other kinds of taxes, such\nas an employer’s share of Social Security taxes, Medicare\ntaxes, or other employee taxes. But no one claims that all\nof these taxes fall outside the scope of the term “adminis-\ntrative expenses.” See In re Ryan, 228 B. R. 746 (Bkrtcy.\nCt. Ore. 1999) (treating postpetition employment taxes\nas administrative expenses in a Chapter 12 proceeding);\nIRS Chief Counsel Advice No. 200518002 (May 6, 2005),\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1060956</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (assuming that some postpetition fed-\neral taxes can be treated as administrative expenses in a\nChapter 12 bankruptcy).\n   In fact, the Government, realizing it cannot go this far,\nconcedes that many of these other (e.g., employer) taxes\nare “administrative expenses,” but only, it suggests, be-\ncause they fall within a different part of the “administra-\ntive expenses” definition, namely 11 U. S. C. §503(b)(1)(A),\nwhich says that “administrative expenses” include “the\nactual, necessary costs and expenses of preserving the\nestate including . . . wages, salaries, and commissions for\nservices rendered after the commencement of the case.”\n(Emphasis added.) See Brief for United States 27–28,\nn. 11. Employment taxes, however, do not fit easily within\nthe rubric “wages, salaries, and commissions.” They may\nwell be “necessary costs and expenses of preserving the\nestate.” But then so are the capital gains taxes at issue\nhere.\n   Finally, the majority makes what I believe to be its\nstrongest argument. Ante, at 9–12. Chapter 13, it points\nout, allows individuals (typically those who are not farm-\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

And there is authority\nholding that taxes on income earned between the time the\nChapter 13 debtor files for bankruptcy and the time the\nbankruptcy Plan is confirmed are not “tax[es] incurred\nby the estate.” See In re Whall, 391 B. R. 1, 5–6 (Bkrtcy.\nCt. Mass. 2008); In re Brown, No. 05–41071, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">3370867</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *3 (Bkrtcy.

Why,\nasks the majority, should the law treat Chapter 12 taxes\ndifferently?\n   For one thing, the issue is less important in a Chapter\n13 case, for the relevant time period—between filing and\nPlan confirmation—is typically very short. Compare H. R.\nRep. No. 95–595, at 276 (“most chapter 13 estates will only\nremain open for 1 or 2 months until confirmation of the\nplan”), with Brief for Neil E. Harl et al. as Amici Curiae\n32–33 (survey of Chapter 12 bankruptcies found the aver-\nage time from filing to confirmation in a district ranged\nfrom nearly five months to over three years). See also 7\nNorton §122:14, at 122–27 (“In Chapter 13, the plan must\nbe filed within 15 days after the filing of the petition,\nunless the time is extended for cause. A Chapter 12 Plan\nmust be filed no later than 90 days after the order for\nrelief, unless the court finds that an extension is substan-\ntially justified” (footnote omitted)).\n   For another, the issue arises differently in a Chapter 13\ncase. That chapter, unlike Chapter 12, contains a special\nprovision that permits the Government to seek §507 prior-\nity treatment of all taxes incurred while the bankruptcy\ncase is pending. §1305 (Government can file proof of claim\nto have postpetition taxes treated as if they had arisen\nbefore the petition was filed).\n   Finally, if uniformity of interpretation between these\ntwo chapters is critical, I do not see the serious harm in\n14                HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntreating the relevant taxes as “administrative expenses”\nin both Chapter 12 and Chapter 13 cases rather than in\nneither. The majority apparently believes that this would\nrender §1305 (the provision permitting the Government to\nseek §507 priority treatment) superfluous. Ante, at 10–12.\nBut that is not so. This interpretation would simply limit\nthe scope of operation of §1305 to the period of time after\nthe Chapter 13 Plan is confirmed but while the Chapter 13\ncase is still pending. And that is likely to be a significant\nperiod of time relative to the preconfirmation period. See\nH. R. Rep. No. 95–595, at 276 (“[M]ost chapter 13 estates\nwill only remain open for 1 or 2 months until confirmation\nof the plan”); §§1325(b)(1), (4) (debtor must commit all his\nprojected disposable income over a 3-year period (some-\ntimes extended to five) to the Plan, unless all unsecured\nclaims can be paid off over a shorter period). The greatest\nChapter 13 harm this interpretation could cause is to re-\nquire the Government to pursue those tax liabilities as\n§507 priority administrative expense claims (rather than\nallow it to choose between §507 priority treatment and\npursuing those claims outside bankruptcy) during the\nrelatively brief period of time between the filing of a peti-\ntion and the Plan’s confirmation.\n   In sum, I would treat a postpetition/preconfirmation tax\nliability as a tax “incurred by the estate,” hence as an\n“administrative expense,” hence as a “clai[m] entitled to\npriority under section 507, unless . . . ,” hence as a claim\nfalling within the scope of the Amendment.

Rather, that section and its\nAmendment provide only for the payment of “claims.”\n§1222(a)(2) (“The plan shall . . . provide for the full pay-\nment . . . of all claims entitled to priority under section\n507, unless . . .” (emphasis added)). And administrative\nexpenses, the Government says, like all debts that are\nincurred postpetition, are not “claims.”\n   The Government finds support for its view in the fact\nthat that §1222 deals with the contents of a “plan,” while a\nlater section, §1227(a), says that the provisions of a “con-\nfirmed plan bind the debtor, each creditor, [and certain\nothers of no relevance here].” (Emphasis added.) This\nis because the Code defines “creditor” to include only hold-\ners of pre-petition claims, thus excluding holders of\npost-petition claims, such as administrative expenses.\n§101(10).\n   The Government points out that a different Code sec-\ntion, namely §1226(b)(1), provides for the payment of\nadministrative expenses. That section says that “[b]efore\nor at the time of each payment to creditors under the plan,\nthere shall be paid . . . any unpaid claim of the kind\nspecified in section 507(a)(2),” namely “administrative ex-\npenses.” And Congress did not amend §1226(b)(1); it\namended the earlier section, §1222(a).\n   In short, the Government says, the Plan only covers\nthose §507 priority “expenses and claims” that are de-\nscribed as “claims” and can be held by “creditors.” Section\n1226(b)(1), not §1222, deals with administrative expenses.\nThe bottom line of the Government’s chain of logic is, once\nagain, that Congress put the Amendment in the wrong\nplace.\n   I concede that there is some text and legislative history\nthat supports the Government’s view that the word\n“claim” in §1222(a) does not include “administrative ex-\npenses.” See, e.g., §507(a) (referring to “expenses and\n16                HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nclaims” as if they are separate categories); S. Rep. No. 95–\n1106, at 20 (“The committee amendments contain several\nchanges designed to clarify the distinction between a\n‘claim’ (which generally relates to a debt incurred before\nthe bankruptcy petition is filed) and an administrative\nexpense (which is an expense incurred by the trustee after\nthe filing of the petition)”).\n   But the language does not demand the Government’s\nreading. For the Code also uses the word “claim” to cover\nboth prepetition and postpetition claims (such as adminis-\ntrative expenses). E.g., §101(5)(A) (defining a claim as a\n“right to payment”); §726(b) (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (refer-\nring to “claims” that include administrative expenses). In-\ndeed, the very section that the Government says permits\nseparate collection of administrative expenses, namely\n§1226(b)(1), refers to “any unpaid claim” for administra-\ntive expenses. (Emphasis added.) And one can easily read\nthat section as setting forth when, not whether, adminis-\ntrative expenses will be paid under the Plan (i.e., as speci-\nfying that the Plan must provide for the payment of ad-\nministrative expenses before payments to other creditors\nare made).         Thus, reading §1222(a)(2)’s reference to\n“claims” as including administrative expenses need not\nrender §1226(b)(1) surplusage.\n   What about §1227(a), which refers only to “creditor[s]”?\nOne must read it in conjunction with §1228(a), which\nprovides that once the debtor has completed all payments\nunder the Plan, “the court shall grant the debtor a dis-\ncharge of [1] all debts provided for by the plan[,] [2] al-\nlowed under section 503 of this title [which describes ‘ad-\nministrative expenses’] or [3] disallowed under section 502\nof this title . . . .” (Emphasis added.) (The first few words\nof §1227(a)—“[e]xcept as provided in section 1228(a)”—\nexplain why I say “must”; the comma comes from 7 Norton\n§137:2, at 137–3, n. 1, which says that its omission was a\ntypographical error). Thus, by here referring to “adminis-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)          17\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntrative expenses” (through its reference to §503), Chapter\n12 makes clear that at least some postpetition claims are\nto be discharged once the debtor has completed his pay-\nments under the Plan. That fact, in turn, suggests that\nthe Plan may provide for their payment and that the\nholders of such claims may be bound by the terms of a\nconfirmed Plan.\n  The upshot is that the Government’s second argument\npresents a plausible, but not the only plausible, interpre-\ntation of the Code’s language. And the Government’s\nsecond argument, like the majority’s argument, has a\nproblem, namely that it reduces Congress’ Amendment to\nrubble. For that reason I believe it does not offer the\nbetter interpretation of the relevant language.\n                             IV\n   In sum the phrase tax “incurred by the estate” in\n§503(b) (the “administrative expense” section) and the\nword “claim” in §1222(a) are open to different interpreta-\ntions. Each of the narrower interpretations advanced by\nthe Government or adopted by the Court would either\nexclude postpetition taxes from the phrase taxes “incurred\nby the estate” or exclude all postpetition debts, including\nadministrative expenses, from the word “claim.” In these\nways, these interpretations would, as I have said, prevent\nthe Amendment from accomplishing its basic purpose.\n   A broader interpretation of the word “claim” may allow\nthe Plan to include certain postpetition debts. This, taken\ntogether with a broader interpretation of the phrase tax\n“incurred by the estate,” prevents the Government from\ncollecting postpetition/preconfirmation tax debts outside of\nChapter 12, requiring it to assume a place in the creditor\nqueue. Together these broader interpretations permit the\nAmendment to take effect as intended.\n   I find this last-mentioned consideration determinative.\nIt seems to me unlikely that Congress, having worked on\n18                HALL v.

Argued November 29, 2011—Decided May 14, 2012\nChapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code allows farmer debtors with regular\n annual income to adjust their debts subject to a reorganization plan.\n The plan must provide for full payment of priority claims. 11 U. S. C.\n §1222(a)(2). Under §1222(a)(2)(A), however, certain governmental\n claims arising from the disposition of farm assets are stripped of pri-\n ority status and downgraded to general, unsecured claims that are\n dischargeable after less than full payment. That exception applies\n only to claims “entitled to priority under [11 U. S. C. §507]” in the\n first place. As relevant here, §507(a)(2) covers “administrative ex-\n penses allowed under §503(b),” which includes “any tax . . . incurred\n by the estate.” §503(b)(B)(i).\n    Petitioners filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy and then sold their\n farm. They proposed a plan under which they would pay off out-\n standing liabilities with proceeds from the sale. The Internal Reve-\n nue Service (IRS) objected, asserting a tax on the capital gains from\n the sale. Petitioners then proposed treating the tax as an unsecured\n claim to be paid to the extent funds were available, with the unpaid\n balance being discharged. The Bankruptcy Court sustained an IRS\n objection, the District Court reversed, and the Ninth Circuit reversed\n the District Court. The Ninth Circuit held that because a Chapter 12\n estate is not a separate taxable entity under the Internal Revenue\n Code (IRC), 26 U. S. C. §§1398, 1399, it does not “incur” postpetition\n federal income taxes. The Ninth Circuit concluded that because the\n tax was not “incurred by the estate” under §503(b), it was not a prior-\n ity claim eligible for the §1222(a)(2)(A) exception.\nHeld: The federal income tax liability resulting from petitioners’ post-\n petition farm sale is not “incurred by the estate” under §503(b) of the\n Bankruptcy Code and thus is neither collectible nor dischargeable in\n2                       HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    the Chapter 12 plan. Pp. 4−17.\n       (a) The phrase “incurred by the estate” bears a plain and natural\n    reading. A tax “incurred by the estate” is a tax for which the estate\n    itself is liable. Only certain estates are liable for federal income tax-\n    es. IRC §§1398 and 1399 define the division of responsibilities for the\n    payment of taxes between the estate and the debtor on a chapter-by-\n    chapter basis. Under those provisions, a Chapter 12 estate is not a\n    separately taxable entity. The debtor—not the trustee—is generally\n    liable for taxes and files the only tax return. The postpetition income\n    taxes are thus not “incurred by the estate.” Pp. 4−5.\n       (b) Section 346 of the Bankruptcy Code and its longstanding inter-\n    play with IRC §§1398 and 1399 reinforce that whether an estate “in-\n    curs” taxes turns on Congress’ chapter-specific guidance on which es-\n    tates are separately taxable. The original §346 established that state\n    or local income taxes could be imposed only on the estate in an indi-\n    vidual-debtor Chapter 7 or 11 bankruptcy, and only on the debtor in\n    a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Congress applied the framework of §346 to\n    federal taxes two years later: IRC §1398 and 1399 established that\n    the estate is separately taxable in individual-debtor Chapter 7 or 11\n    cases, and not separately taxable in Chapter 13 (and now Chapter\n    12) cases. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protec-\n    tion Act of 2005 subsequently amended §346, expressly aligning its\n    assignment of state or local taxes with the IRC separate taxable enti-\n    ty rules for federal taxes. This Court assumes that Congress is\n    aware of existing law when it passes legislation, and the existing law\n    at the enactment of §1222(a)(2)(A) indicated that an estate’s liability\n    for taxes turned on separate taxable entity rules. Pp. 6−9.\n       (c) Chapter 13, on which Chapter 12 was modeled, further bolsters\n    this Court’s holding. Established understandings hold that postpeti-\n    tion income taxes are not “incurred by the [Chapter 13] estate” under\n    §503(b) because they are the liability of the Chapter 13 debtor alone.\n    The Government has also long hewed to this position. Section\n    1305(a)(1), which gives holders of postpetition claims the option of\n    collecting postpetition taxes within the bankruptcy case, would be\n    superfluous if postpetition tax liabilities were automatically collecti-\n    ble inside the bankruptcy. It is thus clear that postpetition income\n    taxes are not automatically collectible in a Chapter 13 plan and are\n    not administrative expenses under §503(b). To hold otherwise in\n    Chapter 12 would disrupt settled practices in Chapter 13 cases.\n    Pp. 9−12.\n       (d) None of the contrary arguments by petitioners and the dissent\n    overcomes the statute’s plain language, context, and structure.\n    There is no textual basis for giving “incurred by the estate” a tem-\n    poral meaning, such that it refers to all taxes “incurred postpetition.”\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

Sec-\n  tion 503’s legislative history is not inconsistent with this Court’s\n  holding, and the Court has cautioned against allowing ambiguous\n  legislative history to muddy clear statutory language. See Milner v.\n  Department of Navy, 562 U. S. ___, ___. Meanwhile, any cases sug-\n  gesting that postpetition taxes were treated as administrative ex-\n  penses are inapposite because they involve corporate debtors, which\n  Congress has singled out for responsibilities paralleling those borne\n  by a separate taxable entity’s trustee. Finally, petitioners contend\n  that the purpose of §1222(a)(2)(A) was to provide debtors with robust\n  relief from tax debts. There may be compelling policy reasons for\n  treating postpetition income tax liabilities as dischargeable. But if\n  Congress intended petitioners’ result, it did not so provide in the\n  statute.

S. C. §1222(a)\n(2)(A). One such claim is for “any tax . . . incurred by the\nestate.” §503(b)(B)(i). The question presented is whether\na federal income tax liability resulting from individual\ndebtors’ sale of a farm during the pendency of a Chapter\n12 bankruptcy is “incurred by the estate” and thus dis­\nchargeable. We hold that it is not.\n                            I\n\n                            A\n\n  In 1986, Congress enacted Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy\nCode, §1201 et seq., to allow farmer debtors with regu­\nlar annual income to adjust their debts. Chapter 12 was\nmodeled on Chapter 13, §1301 et seq., which permits\nindividual debtors with regular annual income to preserve\nexisting assets subject to a “court-approved plan under\nwhich they pay creditors out of their future income.”\nHamilton v. Lanning, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 1).\n2                 HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nChapter 12 debtors similarly file a plan of reorganization.\n§1221. To be confirmed, the plan must provide for the full\npayment of priority claims. §1222(a)(2).\n  In the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer\nProtection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), §1003, 119 Stat. 186,\nCongress created an exception to that requirement:\n    “Contents of plan\n    “(a) The plan shall—\n         .           .           .          .          .\n       “(2) provide for the full payment, in deferred cash\n    payments, of all claims entitled to priority under sec­\n    tion 507, unless—\n       “(A) the claim is a claim owed to a governmental\n    unit that arises as a result of the sale, transfer, ex­\n    change, or other disposition of any farm asset used\n    in the debtor’s farming operation, in which case the\n    claim shall be treated as an unsecured claim that is\n    not entitled to priority under section 507, but the debt\n    shall be treated in such manner only if the debtor re­\n    ceives a discharge.” 11 U. S. C. §1222.\nUnder §1222(a)(2)(A), certain governmental claims result­\ning from the disposition of farm assets are downgraded to\ngeneral, unsecured claims that are dischargeable after less\nthan full payment. See §1228(a). The claims are stripped\nof their priority status.\n   That exception, however, applies only to claims in the\nplan that are “entitled to priority under section 507” in the\nfirst place. Section 507 lists 10 categories of such claims.\nTwo pertain to taxes: One category, §507(a)(8), covers\nprepetition taxes, and is inapplicable in this case. The\nother, §507(a)(2), covers “administrative expenses allowed\nunder section 503(b),” which in turn includes “any tax . . .\nincurred by the estate.” §503(b)(B)(i). Thus, for postpeti­\ntion taxes to be entitled to priority under §507 and eligible\nfor the §1222(a)(2)(A) exception, the taxes must be “in­\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

Petitioners initially proposed a plan of reor­\nganization under which they would pay off outstanding\nliabilities with proceeds from the sale. The Internal Reve­\nnue Service (IRS) objected, asserting a federal income tax\nof $29,000 on the capital gains from the farm sale.\n   Petitioners amended their proposal to treat the income\ntax as a general, unsecured claim to be paid to the extent\nfunds were available, with the unpaid balance discharged.\nAgain the IRS objected. Taxes on income from a postpeti­\ntion farm sale, the IRS argued, remain the debtors’ inde­\npendent responsibility because they are neither collectible\nnor dischargeable in bankruptcy.\n   The Bankruptcy Court sustained the objection. The\ncourt reasoned that because a Chapter 12 estate is not a\nseparate taxable entity under the Internal Revenue Code\n(IRC), see 26 U. S. C. §§1398, 1399, it cannot “incur” taxes\nfor purposes of 11 U. S. C. §503(b).\n   The District Court reversed, expressing doubt that IRC\nprovisions are relevant to interpreting §503(b). Based on\nits reading of legislative history, the District Court deter­\nmined that Congress intended §1222(a)(2)(A) to extend to\npetitioners’ postpetition taxes.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.\n617 F. 3d 1161 (2010). The Court of Appeals held that the\nChapter 12 estate does not “incur” the postpetition federal\nincome taxes for purposes of §503(b) because it is not a\nseparate taxable entity under the IRC, and noted that\nCongress repeatedly has indicated the relevance of the\nIRC’s taxable entity provisions to the Bankruptcy Code.\nAlthough “sympathetic” to the view that the postpetition\ntax liabilities should be dischargeable, the Court of Ap­\n4                    HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\npeals held that “the operative language simply failed to\nmake its way into the statute.” Id., at 1167. The Court of\nAppeals concluded that because the taxes do not qualify\nunder §503(b), they are not priority claims in the plan\neligible for the §1222(a)(2)(A) exception.\n   Judge Paez dissented, siding with a sister Circuit\nthat had concluded that Congress intended §1222(a)(2)(A)\nto extend to such postpetition federal income taxes. We\ngranted certiorari to resolve the split of authority.1 564\nU.

See FCC v. AT&T Inc., 562 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 5) (“When a statute does not define a\nterm, we typically ‘give the phrase its ordinary meaning’ ”).\nTo “incur,” one must “suffer or bring on oneself (a liability\nor expense).” Black’s Law Dictionary 836 (9th ed. 2009);\nsee also Webster’s Third New International Dictionary\n1146 (1976) (“to . . . become liable or subject to: bring down\nupon oneself ”); Random House Dictionary 722 (1966) (“to\nbecome liable or subject to through one’s own action; bring\nupon oneself ”). A tax “incurred by the estate” is a tax for\nwhich the estate itself is liable.\n——————\n    1 CompareIn re Dawes, 652 F. 3d 1236 (CA10 2011), and 617 F. 3d\n1161 (CA9 2010) (case below), with Knudsen v.

S. ____ (2012)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   As the IRC makes clear, only certain estates are liable\nfor federal income taxes. Title 26 U. S. C. §§1398 and\n1399 address taxation in bankruptcy and define the divi­\nsion of responsibilities for the payment of taxes between\nthe estate and the debtor on a chapter-by-chapter basis.\nSection 1398 provides that when an individual debtor files\nfor Chapter 7 or 11 bankruptcy, the estate shall be liable\nfor taxes. In such cases, the trustee files a separate re­\nturn on the estate’s behalf and “[t]he tax” on “the taxable\nincome of the estate . . . shall be paid by the trustee.”\n§1398(c)(1); see also §6012(b)(4) (“Returns of . . . an estate\nof an individual under chapter 7 or 11 . . . shall be made\nby the fiduciary thereof ”). Section 1399 provides that\n“[e]xcept in any case to which section 1398 applies, no\nseparate taxable entity shall result from the commence­\nment of a [bankruptcy] case.” In Chapter 12 and 13 cases,\nthen, there is no separately taxable estate. The debtor—\nnot the trustee—is generally liable for taxes and files the\nonly tax return. See In re Lindsey, 142 B. R. 447, 448\n(Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Okla. 1992) (“It is clear that, pursuant\nto 26 U. S. C. §1398 and 1399, the standing Chapter 12\ntrustee neither files a return nor pays federal income\ntax”); cf. infra, at 15 (discussing special trustee duties in\ncorporate-debtor cases).\n   These provisions suffice to resolve this case: Chapter 12\nestates are not taxable entities. Petitioners, not the estate\nitself, are required to file the tax return and are liable for\nthe taxes resulting from their postpetition farm sale. The\npostpetition federal income tax liability is not “incurred by\nthe estate” and thus is neither collectible nor discharge­\nable in the Chapter 12 plan.2\n——————\n  2 Because we hold that the postpetition federal income taxes at issue\n\nare not collectible in the plan because they are not “incurred by the\nestate,” we need not address the Government’s broader alternative\nargument that Chapter 12 plans are exclusively limited to prepetition\nclaims.\n6                  HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                                B\n\n  Our reading of “incurred by the estate” as informed by\nthe IRC’s separate taxable entity rules draws support\nfrom a related provision of the Bankruptcy Code, 11\nU. S. C. §346, and its longstanding interplay with 26\nU. S. C. §§1398 and 1399. That relationship illustrates\nthat from the inception of the current Bankruptcy Code,\nCongress has specified on a chapter-by-chapter basis\nwhich estates are separately taxable and therefore liable\nfor taxes. That relationship also refutes the dissent’s\nsuggestion that applying such rules is an incongruous\nimportation of “tax law” unconnected to “bankruptcy\nprinciples (as Congress understood them).” Post, at 8–9\n(opinion of BREYER, J.). And it reinforces the reason-\nableness of our view that whether an estate “incurs”\ntaxes under §503(b) turns on such chapter-by-chapter\ndistinctions.\n  In the original Bankruptcy Code, Congress included a\nprovision, §346, that set out a chapter-specific division of\ntax liabilities between the estate and the debtor. Bank­\nruptcy Reform Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 2565. Section\n346(b)(1) provided that in an individual-debtor Chapter 7\nor 11 bankruptcy, “any income of the estate may be taxed\nunder a State or local law imposing a tax . . . only to the\nestate, and may not be taxed to such individual.” 92 Stat.\n2565 (emphasis added); see also 11 Collier on Bankruptcy\n¶TX12.03[5][b][i], p. TX12–21 (16th ed. 2011) (hereinafter\nCollier) (§346(b) “provided that in a case under chapter 7\n[or] 11 . . . the estate of an individual is a taxable entity”).\nSection 346(d) provided, meanwhile, that in a Chapter 13\nbankruptcy, “any income of the estate or the debtor may\nbe taxed under a State or local law imposing a tax . . . only\nto the debtor, and may not be taxed to the estate.” 92 Stat.\n2566 (emphasis added). Congress thus established that\nthe estate in an individual-debtor Chapter 7 or 11 bank­\nruptcy is a separate taxable entity; the estate in a Chapter\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

In\nthe Bankruptcy Tax Act of 1980, 94 Stat. 3397, Congress\nenacted 26 U. S. C. §§1398 and 1399. Section 1398 of the\nIRC, much like §346(b) in the Bankruptcy Code, estab­\nlished that the estate is separately taxable in individual­\ndebtor Chapter 7 or 11 cases. Section 1399 of the IRC,\nmuch like §346(d) in the Bankruptcy Code, clarified that\n——————\n   3 For those of us for whom it is relevant, the legislative history\n\nconfirms that Congress viewed §346 as defining which estates were\nseparate taxable entities. See H. R. Rep. No. 95–595, p. 275 (1977) (here­\ninafter H. R. Rep.) (“A threshold issue to be considered when a debtor\nfiles a petition under title 11 is whether the estate created . . . should\nbe treated as a separate taxable entity”); id., at 334 (“Subsection (d)\nindicates that the estate in a chapter 13 case is not a separate taxable\nentity”); accord, S. Rep. No. 95–989, p. 45 (1978) (hereinafter S. Rep.);\nH. R. Rep., at 335 (noting “the creation of the estate of an individual\nunder chapters 7 or 11 of title 11 as a separate taxable entity”); accord,\nS. Rep., at 46.\n   The Reports also tie separate taxable entity status to the responsibil­\nity to file returns and pay taxes. See H. R. Rep., at 277 (“If the estate\nis a separate taxable entity, then the representative of the estate is\nresponsible for filing any income tax returns and paying any taxes due\nby the estate”); id., at 278 (“When the estate is not a separate taxable\nentity, then taxation of the debtor should be conducted on the same\nbasis as if no petition were filed”).\n   4 A dispute over Committee jurisdiction led to the insertion of “State\n\nor local” before each mention of “law imposing a tax.” Compare H. R.\n8200, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., §346 (1977), with §346, 92 Stat. 2565.\nNonetheless, the House Report underscored that the policy behind §346\napplied equally to federal taxes:\n“[T]here is a strong bankruptcy policy that these provisions apply\nequally to Federal, State, and local taxes. However, in order to avoid\nany possible jurisdictional conflict with the Ways and Means Commit­\ntee over the applicability of these provisions to Federal taxes, H. R.\n8200 has been amended to make the sections inapplicable to Federal\ntaxes. The amendment . . . will obviate the need for a sequential\nreferral of the bill to Ways and Means, which will be considering these\nprovisions and other bankruptcy-related tax law later in this Con­\ngress.” H. R. Rep., at 275.\n8                 HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe estate is not separately taxable in Chapter 13 (and\nnow Chapter 12) cases.\n  In 2005, Congress in BAPCPA amended §346 and crys­\ntallized the connection between the Bankruptcy Code and\nthe IRC. Section 346 now expressly aligns its assignment\nof state or local taxes with the rules for federal taxes,\nproviding in relevant part:\n        “(a) Whenever the Internal Revenue Code of 1986\n    provides that a separate taxable estate or entity is\n    created in a case concerning a debtor under this title,\n    and the income . . . of such estate shall be taxed to or\n    claimed by the estate, a separate taxable estate is also\n    created for purposes of any State and local law impos­\n    ing a tax on or measured by income and such income\n    . . . shall be taxed to or claimed by the estate and may\n    not be taxed to or claimed by the debtor.\n        “(b) Whenever the Internal Revenue Code of 1986\n    provides that no separate taxable estate shall be cre­\n    ated in a case concerning a debtor under this title,\n    and the income . . . of an estate shall be taxed to or\n    claimed by the debtor, such income . . . shall be taxed\n    to or claimed by the debtor under a State or local law\n    imposing a tax on or measured by income and may not\n    be taxed to or claimed by the estate.” (Emphasis added.)\nThus, whenever the estate is separately taxable under\nfederal income tax law, that “is also” the case under state\nor local income tax law, §346(a), and vice versa, §346(b).\nAnd given that the Bankruptcy Code instructs that the as­\nsignment of state or local tax liabilities shall turn on the\nIRC’s separate taxable entity rules, there is parity in\nturning to such rules in assigning federal tax liabilities.\n  In the same Act, Congress added §1222(a)(2)(A). Section\n1222(a)(2)(A) carves out an exception to the ordinary\npriority classification scheme. But §1222(a)(2)(A) did not\npurport to redefine which claims are otherwise entitled to\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npriority, much less alter the underlying division of tax\nliability between the estate and the debtor in Chapter 12\ncases. “We assume that Congress is aware of existing law\nwhen it passes legislation,” Miles v. Apex Marine Corp.,\n498 U. S. 19, 32 (1990), and the existing law at the enact­\nment of §1222(a)(2)(A) indicated that an estate’s liability\nfor taxes turned on chapter-by-chapter separate taxable\nentity rules.\n                              C\n   The statutory structure further reinforces our holding\nthat petitioners’ postpetition income taxes are not “in­\ncurred by the estate.” As a leading bankruptcy treatise\nand lower courts recognize, “[b]ecause chapter 12 was\nmodeled on chapter 13, and because so many of the provi­\nsions are identical, chapter 13 cases construing provisions\ncorresponding to chapter 12 provisions may be relied on as\nauthority in chapter 12 cases.” 8 Collier ¶1200.01[5], at\n1200–10; In re Lopez, 372 B. R. 40, 45, n. 13 (Bkrtcy. App.\nPanel CA9 2007); Justice v. Valley Nat. Bank, 849 F. 2d\n1078, 1083 (CA8 1988). We agree. Section 1322(a)(2), like\n§1222(a)(2), requires full payment of “all claims entitled to\npriority under section 507” under the plan. Both provi­\nsions cross-reference the same section of the Code, §507,\nand in turn, the same subsection, §503(b). Both are treat­\ned alike by IRC §§1398 and 1399. Whether postpetition\ntaxes qualify under §503(b) in Chapter 13 thus sheds light\non whether they so qualify in petitioners’ Chapter 12 case.\n   Bankruptcy courts and commentators have reasoned\nthat postpetition income taxes are not “incurred by the\nestate” under §503(b) because “a tax on postpetition in­\ncome of the debtor or of the chapter 13 estate is not a\nliability of the chapter 13 estate; it is a liability of the\ndebtor alone.” 8 Collier ¶1305.02[1], at 1305–5 and 1305–\n10                   HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n6.5 For over a decade, the Government has likewise hewed\nto the position that “since post-petition tax liabilities are,\nin Chapter 13 cases, incurred by the debtor, rather than\nthe bankruptcy estate, characterizing such liabilities as\nadministrative expenses is inconsistent with section 503.”\nIRS Chief Counsel Advice No. 200113027, p. 6 (Mar. 30,\n2001), 2001 WL 307746, *4; see also Internal Revenue\nManual §5.9.10.9.2(3) (2006) (hereinafter IRM); IRS Liti­\ngation Guideline Memorandum GL–26, p. 9 (Dec. 16,\n1996), 1996 WL 33107107, *6. We see no reason to depart\nfrom those established understandings. To “ ‘hold the\nChapter 13 estate liable for [a] tax when it does not exist\nas a taxable entity defies common sense as well as Con­\ngress’ intent.’ ” In re Whall, 391 B. R. 1, 4 (Bkrtcy. Ct.\nMass. 2008). The same holds true for a Chapter 12 estate.\n   A provision in Chapter 13 confirms that postpetition\nincome taxes fall outside §503(b). Section 1305(a)(1) pro­\nvides that “[a] proof of claim may be filed by any entity\nthat holds a claim against the debtor . . . for taxes that\nbecome payable to a governmental unit while the case is\npending.” (Emphasis added.) That provision gives holders\nof postpetition claims the option of collecting postpetition\ntaxes within the bankruptcy case—an option that the\nGovernment would never need to invoke if postpetition tax\nliabilities were already collectible inside the bankruptcy.\nAccordingly, lest we render §1305 “ ‘inoperative or super­\nfluous,’ ” Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88, 101 (2004), it is clear\nthat postpetition income taxes are not automatically col­\nlectible in a Chapter 13 plan and, a fortiori, are not admin­\nistrative expenses under §503(b).\n   It follows that postpetition income taxes are not auto­\n——————\n  5 See, e.g., In re Maxfield, No. 04–60355, 2009 WL 2105953, *5–*6\n\n(Bkrtcy.

See Cohen v. de la\nCruz, 523 U. S. 213, 221 (1998) (the Court “ ‘will not read\nthe Bankruptcy Code to erode past bankruptcy practice\nabsent a clear indication that Congress intended such a\ndeparture’ ”). Chapter 13 filings outnumber Chapter 12\nfilings six-hundred-fold. See U. S.

As\na practical matter, it is not clear that Chapter 12 bankruptcies are\nsubstantially longer. Compare Brief for Neil E. Harl. et al. as Amici\nCuriae 33 (median Chapter 12 case duration is under 8 months) with\nTr. of Oral Arg. 49 (“on average we’re talking about 4 months in a\nchapter 13 case”). In any event, there is no indication that Congress\nintended any difference in duration—if it anticipated a difference at\nall—to flip the characterization of postpetition income taxes from one\nchapter to the other. Nor does the absence of a §1305 equivalent in\nChapter 12 justify shoehorning postpetition taxes into §503(b), as the\ndissent argues. That Chapter 12 lacks a provision allowing such taxes\nto be brought inside the plan only clarifies that such taxes fall outside\nof the plan.\n   The dissent alternatively suggests that it “do[es] not see the serious\nharm in treating the relevant taxes as ‘administrative expenses’ in both\nChapter 12 and Chapter 13 cases.” Post, at 13–14. The “harm” is to\nsettled understandings in Chapter 13 to the contrary. The “harm” is\nalso to §1305; to avoid rendering §1305 a nullity, the dissent recasts the\nprovision as applicable not to all “taxes that become payable . . . while\nthe case is pending,” but only those payable “after the Chapter 13 Plan\nis confirmed.” Post, at 14. The dissent does not claim, however, that\nthis was Congress’ intent for §1305, as Congress’ choice of words would\nbe exceedingly overbroad if it were. And the dissent’s novel reading\ncontravenes ample Chapter 13 authority recognizing no such limitation\non §1305’s scope. E.g., 8 Collier ¶1305.02 (citing cases).\n12                     HALL v.

Yet adopting petitioners’ reading of §503(b)\nwould mean that, in every Chapter 13 case, the Govern­\nment could ignore §1305 and expect priority payment of\npostpetition income taxes in every plan.\n  At bottom, “identical words and phrases within the\nsame statute should normally be given the same mean­\ning.” Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Services, Inc., 551\nU. S. 224, 232 (2007). Absent any indication that Con­\ngress intended a conflict between two closely related chap­\nters, we decline to create one.7\n                             III\n   Petitioners and the dissent advance several arguments\nfor why the postpetition income taxes at issue should be\nconsidered “incurred by the estate,” notwithstanding the\nIRC’s separate taxable entity rules. But none provides\nsufficient reason to overcome the statute’s plain language,\ncontext, and structure.\n   Petitioners primarily argue that “incurred by the estate”\nhas a temporal meaning. Petitioners emphasize that the\nestate only comes into existence after a bankruptcy peti­\ntion is filed. Thus, they reason, taxes “incurred by the\nestate” refers to all taxes “incurred postpetition,” regard­\nless of whether the estate is liable for the tax and regard­\nless of the chapter under which a case is filed. Although\nall taxes “incurred by the estate” are necessarily incurred\n\n——————\n  7 IRS  manuals dating back to 1998 indicate that the Government did\nnot view postpetition federal income taxes as collectible in an individ-\nual debtor’s Chapter 12 plan, even when that view was adverse to its\ninterests. See IRM §25.17.12.9.3 (2004); id., §25.17.12.9.3(1) (2002);\nid., §5.9, ch. 10.8(4) (1999); id., §5.9, ch. 10.8(4) (1998). Until the en­\nactment of 11 U. S. C. §1222(a)(2)(A), treating such taxes as priority\nclaims in the plan would have assured the Government of full payment\nbefore or at the time of the plan.\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npostpetition, not all taxes incurred postpetition are “in­\ncurred by the estate.” That an estate cannot incur liability\nuntil it exists does not mean that every liability that\narises after that point automatically becomes the estate’s\nliability. And there is no textual basis to focus on when\nthe liability is incurred, as opposed to whether the liability\nis incurred “by the estate.”\n   Alternately, petitioners contend that a tax should be\nconsidered “incurred by the estate” so long as it is payable\nout of estate assets. Income from postpetition sales of\nfarm assets is considered property of the estate. See\n§1207(a). Petitioners argue that even if the debtor—and\nnot the estate—is liable for a tax, the tax is still “incurred\nby the estate” because the funds the debtor uses to pay the\ntax are property of the estate. But that too strains the\ntext beyond what it can bear. To concede that someone\nother than the estate is liable for filing the return and\npaying the tax, and yet maintain that the estate is the one\nthat has “incurred” the tax, defies the ordinary meaning of\n“incur” as bringing a liability upon oneself.\n   The dissent, echoing both of these points, urges that\nwe “simply . . . consider the debtor and estate as merged.”\nPost, at 11. “The English language,” the dissent reasons,\n“permits this reading” and “do[es] not require” our read­\ning. Post, at 8–9. But any reading of “tax . . . incurred by\nthe estate” that is contingent on merging the debtor and\nestate—despite Congress’ longstanding efforts to distin-\nguish between when tax liabilities are borne by the debtor\nor borne by the estate—is not a natural construction of the\nstatute as written.\n   Moreover, these alternative readings create a conflict\nbetween §503(b) and §346(b). Petitioners consider postpe­\ntition state or local income taxes, like federal income\ntaxes, to be “incurred by the estate” under §503(b). See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 4–5. But §346(b) requires that such taxes\nbe borne by the Chapter 12 debtor, not the estate. It is\n14                    HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nimplausible to maintain that taxes are “incurred by the\nestate” when §346(b) specifically prohibits such taxes from\nbeing “taxed to or claimed by the estate.”\n   To buttress their counterintuitive readings of the text,\npetitioners and the dissent suggest that there is a long\nhistory of treating postpetition taxes as administrative\nexpenses entitled to priority. Both point to two legislative\nReports accompanying the 1978 enactment of §503. But\nneither snippet from which they quote is inconsistent with\ntoday’s holding,8 and we have cautioned against “allowing\nambiguous legislative history to muddy clear statutory\nlanguage.” Milner v. Department of Navy, 562 U. S. ___,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 9).\n   Petitioners also point to cases suggesting that postpeti­\ntion taxes were treated as administrative expenses. E.g.,\nUnited States v. Noland, 517 U. S. 535, 543 (1996) (cor­\nporate Chapter 11 debtor); Nicholas v. United States,\n384 U. S. 678, 687–688 (1966) (corporate Chapter XI case\nunder predecessor Bankruptcy Act). But those cases\ninvolve corporate debtors and are therefore inapposite.\nAmong estates that are not separately taxable, those\ninvolving corporate debtors have long been singled out by\n\n\n——————\n   8 The House Report stated—after noting that, in addition to prepeti­\n\ntion taxes, “certain other taxes are entitled to priority”—that “[t]axes\narising from the operation of the estate after bankruptcy are entitled to\npriority as administrative expenses.” H. R. Rep., at 193. That is still\ntrue. Many taxes arising after bankruptcy, as in individual-debtor\nChapter 7 or 11 cases, remain entitled to priority as administrative\nexpenses. The Senate Report, meanwhile, stated: “In general, adminis­\ntrative expenses include taxes which the trustee incurs in administer­\ning the debtor’s estate, including taxes on capital gains from sales of\nproperty by the trustee and taxes on income earned by the estate during\nthe case.” S. Rep., at 66 (emphasis added). That likewise remains true.\nAdministrative expenses still include income taxes that “the trustee,”\nas opposed to the debtor, has incurred—again, as in individual-debtor\nChapter 7 or 11 cases.\n                      Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                       15\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nCongress for special responsibilities.9 See H. R. Rep., at\n277 (even “[i]f the estate is not a separate taxable entity,”\nadministrative responsibility can “var[y] according to the\nnature of the debtor”). Although estates of corporate\ndebtors are not separate taxable entities under 26 U. S. C.\n§§1398 and 1399, the IRC requires a trustee that “has\npossession of or holds title to all or substantially all the\nproperty or business of a corporation” to “make the return\nof income for such corporation.” §6012(b)(3). In effect,\nCongress provided that the trustee in a corporate-debtor\ncase may shoulder responsibility that parallels that borne\nby the trustee of a separate taxable entity. In any event,\npetitioners do not deny that neither the separate taxable\nentity provisions nor the special provisions for corporate\ndebtors apply to them.\n  Finally, petitioners and the dissent contend that the\npurpose of 11 U. S. C. §1222(a)(2)(A) was to provide debt­\nors with robust relief from tax debts, relying on state­\nments by a single Senator on unenacted bills introduced in\nyears preceding the enactment. See Brief for Petitioners\n23–36. They argue that deeming §1222(a)(2)(A) inapplica­\nble to their postpetition income taxes would undermine\nthat purpose and confine the exception to prepetition\ntaxes. But we need not resolve here what other claims, if\nany, are covered by §1222(a)(2)(A).10 Whatever the 2005\n——————\n    9 The original §346 established that the estate of a corporate debtor\n\nis not a separate taxable entity, but nonetheless provided that “the\ntrustee shall make any [State or local] tax return otherwise required\n. . . to be filed by or on behalf of such . . . corporation.” §§346(c)(1)–(2),\n92 Stat. 2565, 2566. The current §346 similarly states, in the same\nprovision deeming the debtor taxable when there is no separate taxable\nestate, that “[t]he trustee shall make such tax returns of income of\ncorporations . . . . The estate shall be liable for any [State or local] tax\nimposed on such corporation.” §346(b).\n    10 The dissent opines that employment taxes must be administrative\n\nexpenses “incurred by the estate” because, in its view, they “do not\nfit easily” within the category of administrative expenses under\n16                   HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nCongress’ intent with respect to §1222(a)(2)(A), that provi­\nsion merely carved out an exception to the pre-existing\npriority classification scheme. The exception could only\napply to claims “entitled to priority under section 507” in\nthe first place. That pre-existing scheme was in turn\npremised on antecedent, decades-old understandings\nabout the scope of §503(b) and the division of tax liabilities\nbetween estates and debtors. See Dewsnup v. Timm, 502\nU. S. 410, 419 (1992) (“When Congress amends the bank­\nruptcy laws, it does not write ‘on a clean slate’ ”). If Con­\ngress wished to alter these background norms, it needed to\nenact a provision to enable postpetition income taxes to be\ncollected in the Chapter 12 plan in the first place.\n  The dissent concludes otherwise by an inverted analysis.\nRather than demonstrate that such claims were treated as\n§507 priority claims in the first place, the dissent begins\nwith the single Senator’s stated purpose for the exception\nto that priority scheme. Post, at 7. It then reasons back­\nwards from there, and in the process upsets background\nnorms in both Chapters 12 and 13.\n  Certainly, there may be compelling policy reasons for\ntreating postpetition income tax liabilities as discharge-\nable.

Consistent with the chapter’s pur-\nposes, Congress amended §1222(a) of the Code to enable the\ndebtor to treat certain capital gains tax claims as ordinary\nunsecured claims. 11 U. S. C. §1222(a)(2)(A). The Court’s\nholding prevents the Amendment from carrying out this\nbasic objective. I would read the statute differently, inter-\npreting it in a way that, in my view, both is consistent\nwith its language and allows the Amendment better to\nachieve its purposes.\n                            I\n\n                            A\n\n  Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code helps indebted\nfamily farmers (and fishermen) keep their farms by mak-\ning commitments to pay those debts (in part) out of future\nincome. An eligible farmer whose debts exceed his assets\nmay enter Chapter 12 bankruptcy, at which point he must\ndevelop a detailed Plan setting forth how he will pay his\ndebts. That Plan must satisfy certain statutory criteria.\n§§1221, 1222, 1225.\n  A brief overview of these requirements helps to illumi-\n2                 HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nnate what is at stake in this case. Roughly speaking, the\nchapter requires that a holder of a secured claim receive\nthe full amount of that claim up to the value of the collat-\neral securing the loan. The claim may be paid over an\nextended period. If the claim exceeds the value of the\ncollateral, the creditor is given an unsecured claim in the\nremainder. §§506(a), 1225(a)(5).\n   The holder of a §507 priority claim (a category that\nincludes, among other things, domestic support obliga-\ntions, debts for taxes incurred before filing the bankruptcy\npetition, and administrative expenses) must receive the\nfull amount of the priority claim in deferred cash pay-\nments paid over the life of the Plan. §1222(a)(2).\n   The holder of an ordinary unsecured claim—i.e., an\nunsecured claim of a kind not listed in §507—may receive\nat least a partial payment from the amount left over after\nthe payment of the secured and §507 priority claims. This\namount may well be more than zero, for the Plan must\nprovide that the farmer will devote all “disposable income”\n(as defined by §1225(b)(2)) or property of equivalent value\nto the repayment of his debts over the next three years\n(sometimes extended to five years). §§1222(c), 1225(b)(1).\nAnd that amount must prove sufficient to provide the un-\nsecured creditor with no less than that creditor would re-\nceive in a Chapter 7 liquidation. §1225(a)(4).\n   Once the farmer completes his Plan payments, he will\nreceive a discharge even if his payments did not fully\nsatisfy all unsecured claims. The Code does not, however,\npermit all debts to be discharged. There are categories\nof nondischargeable debts (including, for example, secured\nclaims), which creditors can pursue after bankruptcy.\n§1228(a).\n   For present purposes, it is important to understand that\nif the debtor owes too much money to his §507 priority\ncreditors, he may not have sufficient assets or future\nincome to pay all his secured creditors and his §507 prior-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nity creditors while leaving enough funds over to guarantee\nunsecured creditors the minimum amounts that Chapter\n12 requires. If so, the farmer may not be able to proceed\nunder Chapter 12. See §§1225(a)(1), (6) (bankruptcy court\nwill not confirm Plan unless it satisfies statutory criteria\nand debtor will be able to make good on his commitments\nunder the Plan).\n   It is also important to understand that the same kind of\ninsufficient-assets-and-income problem might occur where\nthe debtor owes the Government a large post-petition tax\ndebt. In general, postpetition claims are not part of the\nbankruptcy proceedings. See 7 Norton Bankruptcy Law\nand Practice §135:14 (3d ed. 2011) (hereinafter Norton).\nUnless the Government’s debt falls within an exception to\nthis general rule, bankruptcy law would leave the Gov-\nernment to collect its postpetition claim outside of bank-\nruptcy as best it could. Again, the result will be to leave\nthe farmer with fewer assets and income to devote to his\nChapter 12 Plan—perhaps to the point where he cannot\nproceed under Chapter 12 at all.\n                           B\n  With this general summary in mind, it is easier to un-\nderstand the significance of the question this case pre-\nsents. The question arises out of an amendment to a\nChapter 12 provision. The provision as amended says:\n    “Contents of plan\n       “(a) The plan shall—\n         .           .           .         .          .\n       “(2) provide for the full payment, in deferred cash\n    payments, of all claims entitled to priority under sec-\n    tion 507, unless—\n       “(A) the claim is a claim owed to a governmental\n    unit that arises as a result of the sale, transfer, ex-\n    change, or other disposition of any farm asset used in\n    the debtor’s farming operation, in which case the\n4                  HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n    claim shall be treated as an unsecured claim that is\n    not entitled to priority under section 507, but the debt\n    shall be treated in such manner only if the debtor re-\n    ceives a discharge; or\n      “(B) the holder of a particular claim agrees to a dif-\n    ferent treatment of that claim.” §1222(a) (emphasis\n    added).\nThe Amendment consists of subparagraph (A).\n  At first blush, the Amendment seems to relegate the\ncapital gains tax collector to the status of an ordinary\nunsecured creditor. See ibid. (exception applies to claims\n“owed to a governmental unit that arises as a result of the\nsale . . . of any farm asset”). If, as petitioners claim, that\nis so, then it is unlikely that such a debt could stop a\nfarmer from proceeding under Chapter 12, since its treat-\nment as an ordinary unsecured claim means that the\nfarmer will not necessarily have to pay the debt in full.\n  But if the Government and the majority are right, then\nthe capital gains tax falls outside the category of §507\npriority claims—and therefore falls outside the scope of\nthe Amendment; in fact, it falls outside the bankruptcy\nproceeding altogether. And the Government then might\nwell be able to collect the debt in full outside the bank-\nruptcy proceeding—even if doing so would reduce the\nfarmer’s assets and future income to the point where the\nfarmer would not be able to proceed under Chapter 12.\nThe question before us is whether we must interpret the\nAmendment in a way that could bring about this result.\n                              C\n                              1\n   Congress did not intend this result. In a significant\nnumber of instances a Chapter 12 farmer, in order to\nhave enough money to pay his creditors, might have to sell\nfarmland or other farm assets at a price that would give\nrise to considerable capital gains taxes (particularly if the\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfamily has held the land or assets for many years). If the\nresulting tax debt were treated as a §507 priority claim,\nthen it might well absorb much of the money raised to the\npoint where (depending upon the size of his other debts)\nthe farmer might be unable to proceed under Chapter 12.\nThe Amendment accordingly seeks to place the tax author-\nities farther back in the creditor queue, requiring them,\nlike ordinary unsecured creditors, to seek payment from\nthe funds that remain after the §507 priority creditors\n(and secured claim holders) have been paid.\n   The Amendment’s chief legislative sponsor, Senator\nCharles Grassley, explained this well when he told the\nSenate:\n    “Under current law, farmers often face a crushing tax\n    liability if they need to sell livestock or land in order\n    to reorganize their business affairs. . . . [H]igh taxes\n    have caused farmers to lose their farms. Under the\n    bankruptcy code, the I. R. S. must be paid in full for\n    any tax liabilities generated during a bankruptcy re-\n    organization. If the farmer can’t pay the I. R. S. in\n    full, then he can’t keep his farm. This isn’t sound pol-\n    icy. Why should the I. R. S. be allowed to veto a\n    farmer’s reorganization plan?         [The Amendment]\n    takes this power away from the I. R. S. by reducing\n    the priority of taxes during proceedings. This will free\n    up capital for investment in the farm, and help farm-\n    ers stay in the business of farming.” 145 Cong. Rec.\n    1113 (1999).\nSee also 14A J. Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation\n§54:61, p. 11 (Oct. 2011 Supp.) (“This provision attempts\nto mitigate the tax expense often incurred by farmers who\nhave significant taxable capital gains or depreciation re-\ncapture when their low basis farm assets are foreclosed,\nsold, or otherwise disposed of by their creditors”).\n6                 HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n                               2\n    The majority, following the Government’s suggestion,\ninterprets the relevant language in a way that denies the\nAmendment its intended effect. It holds that the only\nincome tax claims to which §507 accords priority are\nclaims for taxes due for years prior to the taxable year in\nwhich the farmer filed for bankruptcy. (We shall call\nthese “prepetition tax claims.”) In the majority’s view,\n§507 does not cover income tax liabilities that arise during\nthe year of filing or during the Chapter 12 proceedings.\n(We shall call these “postpetition tax claims.”) Ante, at 4–\n5; see Brief for United States 8 (the Amendment “provides\nfarmers relief from [only] those tax claims that are other-\nwise entitled to priority under 11 U. S. C. 507(a)(8), namely\npre-petition claims arising from the sale of farm as-\nsets”); Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Pro-\ntection Act of 2005, §705(1)(A), 119 Stat. 126 (amending\n§507(a)(8) to clarify that it only covers income tax claims\nfor taxable years that end on or before the date of the\nfiling of the bankruptcy petition).\n    The majority then observes that the Amendment creates\nan exception only in respect to §507 priority claims.\n§1222(a) (“The plan shall . . . provide for the full payment\n. . . of all claims entitled to priority under section 507,\nunless . . . .” (Emphasis added.)). Ante, at 2. Thus, if\n(without the Amendment) §507 would not cover postpeti-\ntion capital gains taxes in the first place, the Amendment\n(creating only a §507 exception) cannot affect postpeti-\ntion tax claims. An exception from nothing amounts to\nnothing.\n    Consequently, the majority concludes that postpetition\ntax claims fall outside the bankruptcy proceeding entirely;\nthe tax authorities can collect them as if they were ordi-\nnary tax debts; and the Government’s efforts to collect\nthem can lead to the very results (blocking the use of\nChapter 12) that the Amendment sought to avoid.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   Therein lies the problem. These results are the very\nopposite of what Congress intended. Congress did not\nwant to relegate to ordinary-unsecured-claim status only\nprepetition tax claims, i.e., tax claims that accrued well\nbefore the Chapter 12 proceedings began. Rather, Con-\ngress was concerned about the effect on the farmer of\ncollecting capital gains tax debts that arose during (and\nwere connected with) the Chapter 12 proceedings them-\nselves. See 145 Cong. Rec. 1113 (the Amendment will\nhave the effect of “reducing the priority of taxes during\nproceedings” (emphasis added) (statement of Sen. Grassley\nduring a failed attempt to enact the Amendment)); Hear-\ning on the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001 before the\nSenate Committee on the Judiciary, 107th Cong., 1st\nSess., 121 (statement of Sen. Grassley) (“[The Amend-\nment] also reduces the priority of capital gains tax liabili-\nties for farm assets sold as a part of a reorganization plan”\n(emphasis added)). The majority does not deny the im-\nportance of Congress’ objective. Rather, it feels compelled\nto hold that Congress put the Amendment in the wrong\nplace.\n                              II\n   Unlike the majority, I believe the relevant Bankruptcy\nCode language can be and is better interpreted in a way\nthat would give full effect to the Amendment. In particu-\nlar, the relevant language is better interpreted so that in\nthe absence of the Amendment §507 would cover these\npostpetition tax claims. Hence the Amendment creates an\nexception from what otherwise would amount to a §507\npriority claim. And it can take effect as written.\n   It is common ground that subsection (a)(2) of §507 cov-\ners, and gives §507 priority to, “administrative expenses\nallowed under section 503(b).” §507(a)(2) (2006 ed., Supp.\nIV). It is also common ground that the relevant defini-\ntional section, namely §503(b), defines allowed “adminis-\n8                  HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntrative expenses” as “including . . . any tax . . . incurred by\nthe estate.” §503(b)(1)(B)(i) (2006 ed.). But after this\npoint, we part company.\n   The majority believes that the words any tax “incur-\nred by the estate” cannot include postpetition taxes. It\nemphasizes that tax law does not treat a Chapter 12\nbankruptcy estate as a “separate taxable entity,” i.e., as\nseparate from the farmer-debtor for federal income tax\npurposes. 26 U. S. C. §§1398, 1399. This means that\nthere is just one entity—the debtor—for these purposes.\nAnd §346 of the Bankruptcy Code makes clear that any\nstate and local income tax liabilities incurred by a Chapter\n12 estate must also be taxed to the debtor. The majority\nsays that these provisions mean that only the debtor, and\nnot the estate, can “ ‘incu[r]’ ” taxes within the meaning of\n11 U. S. C. §503(b)(1)(B)(i). Ante, at 4–5.\n   In my view, however, these tax law circumstances do\nnot require the majority’s narrow reading of this Bank-\nruptcy Code provision. That is to say, the phrase tax\n“incurred by the [bankruptcy] estate” can include a tax\nincurred by the farmer while managing his estate in the\nmidst of his bankruptcy proceedings, i.e., between the time\nthe farmer files for Chapter 12 bankruptcy and the time\nthe bankruptcy court confirms the farmer’s Chapter 12\nPlan.\n   The bankruptcy estate is in existence during this time.\nCf. §1227(b) (property of the estate vests in the debtor\nat confirmation unless the Plan provides otherwise). The\nbankruptcy court has jurisdiction over the farmer’s assets\nduring this time. See §§541, 1207; 4 Norton §61:1, at 61–2\n(§541’s “broad definition of estate property . . . centralizes\nall of the estate’s assets under the jurisdiction of the bank-\nruptcy court”). And, as a matter of both the English lan-\nguage and bankruptcy principles, one can consider a tax\nliability that the farmer incurs during this period (such as\na capital gains tax arising from a sale of a portion of his\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfarm assets to raise funds for creditors) as a liability that,\nin a bankruptcy sense, the estate incurs.\n   The English language permits this reading of the phrase\ntax “incurred by the estate.” When the farmer, in the\nmidst of Chapter 12 proceedings, sells a portion of his\nfarm to raise money to help pay his creditors, one can\nsay, as a matter of English, that the bankruptcy estate has\n“incurred” the associated tax, even if it is ultimately taxed\nto the farmer, just as one can say that an employee who\nmakes purchases using a company credit card “incurs\ncosts” for which his employer is liable.\n   As a matter of general bankruptcy principles (as Con-\ngress understood them), the history of the 1978 Bank-\nruptcy Code revision is replete with statements to the effect\nthat “[t]axes arising from the operation of the estate after\nbankruptcy are entitled to priority as administrative\nexpenses.” H. R. Rep. No. 95–595, p. 193 (1977) (emphasis\nadded). See S. Rep. No. 95–1106, p. 13 (1978) (adminis-\ntrative expenses include “[t]axes incurred during the\nadministration of the estate” (emphasis added)); S. Rep.\nNo. 95–989, p. 66 (1978) (“In general, administrative\nexpenses include taxes which the trustee incurs in admin-\nistering the debtor’s estate, including taxes on capital gains\nfrom sales of property by the trustee and taxes on income\nearned by the estate during the case” (emphasis added));\n124 Cong. Rec. 32415 (1978) (“The amendment generally\nfollows the Senate amendment in providing expressly\nthat taxes incurred during the administration of the estate\nshare the first priority given to administrative expenses\ngenerally” (emphasis added)); id., at 34014 (Senate version\nof the joint floor statement saying exactly the same).\n   And importantly, as the majority concedes, ante, at 14–\n15, bankruptcy law treats taxes incurred by corporate\ndebtors while they are in bankruptcy proceedings as\n“tax[es] incurred by the estate,” even though the Tax Code\ndoes not treat the bankruptcy estate of a corporate debtor\n10                HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nas a “separate taxable entity.” See, e.g., United States v.\nNoland, 517 U. S. 535, 543 (1996) (treating Chapter 11\ncorporate debtor’s postpetition taxes as administrative\nexpenses); In re Pacific-Atlantic Trading Co., 64 F. 3d\n1292, 1298 (CA9 1995) (same); In re L. J. O’Neil Shoe Co.,\n64 F. 3d 1146, 1151–1152 (CA8 1995) (same); In re Hills-\nborough Holdings Corp., 156 B. R. 318, 320 (Bkrtcy. Ct.\nMD Fla. 1993) (“[A]dministrative expenses should include\ntaxes which the trustee, and, in Chapter 11 cases, the\nDebtor-in-Possession, incurs in administering the estate,\nincluding taxes based on capital gains from sales of prop-\nerty and taxes on income earned by the estate during the\ncase post-petition”).\n   Even though, as the majority says, corporate bankrupt-\ncies have some special features (in particular, a trustee in\na corporate bankruptcy is required to file the estate’s\nincome tax return), it is unclear why these features should\nhave any bearing on the definition of administrative\nexpenses.      See ante, at 15 (discussing 26 U. S. C.\n§6012(b)(3)). Indeed, in many corporate Chapter 11 bank-\nruptcies, there is no trustee, in which case the debtor-in-\npossession, just like an individual Chapter 12 debtor, must\nfile the tax return. See 11 U. S. C. §§1104, 1107 (2006 ed.\nand Supp. IV); 5 Norton §§91:3, 93:1 (typically, no trustee\nis appointed in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and the debtor-\nin-possession assumes most of the duties and powers of a\ntrustee, continuing in possession and managing the busi-\nness until the court determines, upon request of a party in\ninterest, that grounds exist for the appointment of a trus-\ntee); Holywell Corp. v. Smith, 503 U. S. 47, 54 (1992) (“As\nthe assignee of ‘all’ or ‘substantially all’ of the property\nof the corporate debtors, the trustee must file the re-\nturns that the corporate debtors would have filed had the\nplan not assigned their property to the trustee” (emphasis\nadded)).\n   Consequently, I can find no strong bankruptcy law\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nreason for treating taxes incurred by a corporate debtor\ndifferently from those incurred by an individual Chapter\n12 debtor. To the contrary, since corporations can file\nfor bankruptcy under Chapter 12, the majority’s argument\nimplies that the treatment of postpetition taxes in Chapter\n12 proceedings turns on whether the debtor happens to be\na corporation. See §101(18)(B) (2006 ed.) (defining “family\nfarmer” to include certain corporations); §109(f) (“Only\na family farmer or family fisherman with regular annual\nincome may be a debtor under chapter 12”); Brief for\nUnited States 26, n. 9 (“[T]he estate of a corporate (as\nopposed to individual) Chapter 12 debtor . . . could be\nviewed as incurring post-petition income taxes . . . collecti-\nble as administrative expenses . . . rather than outside the\nbankruptcy case as required for an individual Chapter 12\ndebtor”).\n   The majority does not point to any adverse consequences\nthat might arise were bankruptcy law to treat taxes in-\ncurred in administering the bankruptcy estate (i.e., taxes\nincurred after filing and before Plan confirmation) as\nadministrative expenses. The effect of doing so would\nsimply be to consider the debtor and estate as merged for\npurposes of determining which taxes fall within the Bank-\nruptcy’s Code’s definition of “administrative expenses,”\ni.e., determining for that purpose that the estate may\n“incur” tax liabilities on behalf of the whole (with the ul-\ntimate liability assigned to the debtor), much like a\nmarried couple filing jointly, 26 U. S. C. §6013(a), or an\naffiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated tax\nreturn, §1501. Cf. In re Lumara Foods of America, Inc., 50\nB. R. 809, 815 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ohio 1985) (describing the\nhistory of §503(b)(1)(B)(i) and concluding that “the eleva-\ntion [of a tax] to an administrative priority is dependent\nupon when the tax accrued”). In fact, the very tax provi-\nsions that separate the estate from the individual debtor\nin Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 proceedings, §§1398 and\n12                HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n1399, say that the Chapter 12 estate is not separate from\nthe debtor for tax purposes—a concept consistent, not at\nodds, with merging the two for this bankruptcy purpose.\n   Nor is the majority’s reading free of conceptual prob-\nlems. If we read the phrase tax “incurred by the estate”\nas excluding tax liabilities incurred while the farmer is in\nChapter 12 bankruptcy, we must read it as excluding not\nonly capital gains taxes but also other kinds of taxes, such\nas an employer’s share of Social Security taxes, Medicare\ntaxes, or other employee taxes. But no one claims that all\nof these taxes fall outside the scope of the term “adminis-\ntrative expenses.” See In re Ryan, 228 B. R. 746 (Bkrtcy.\nCt. Ore. 1999) (treating postpetition employment taxes\nas administrative expenses in a Chapter 12 proceeding);\nIRS Chief Counsel Advice No. 200518002 (May 6, 2005),\n2005 WL 1060956 (assuming that some postpetition fed-\neral taxes can be treated as administrative expenses in a\nChapter 12 bankruptcy).\n   In fact, the Government, realizing it cannot go this far,\nconcedes that many of these other (e.g., employer) taxes\nare “administrative expenses,” but only, it suggests, be-\ncause they fall within a different part of the “administra-\ntive expenses” definition, namely 11 U. S. C. §503(b)(1)(A),\nwhich says that “administrative expenses” include “the\nactual, necessary costs and expenses of preserving the\nestate including . . . wages, salaries, and commissions for\nservices rendered after the commencement of the case.”\n(Emphasis added.) See Brief for United States 27–28,\nn. 11. Employment taxes, however, do not fit easily within\nthe rubric “wages, salaries, and commissions.” They may\nwell be “necessary costs and expenses of preserving the\nestate.” But then so are the capital gains taxes at issue\nhere.\n   Finally, the majority makes what I believe to be its\nstrongest argument.

And there is authority\nholding that taxes on income earned between the time the\nChapter 13 debtor files for bankruptcy and the time the\nbankruptcy Plan is confirmed are not “tax[es] incurred\nby the estate.” See In re Whall, 391 B. R. 1, 5–6 (Bkrtcy.\nCt. Mass. 2008); In re Brown, No. 05–41071, 2006 WL\n3370867, *3 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Mass. 2006); In re Jagours, 236\nB. R. 616, 620, n. 4 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Tex. 1999); In re\nGyulafia, 65 B. R. 913, 916 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Kan. 1986). Why,\nasks the majority, should the law treat Chapter 12 taxes\ndifferently?\n   For one thing, the issue is less important in a Chapter\n13 case, for the relevant time period—between filing and\nPlan confirmation—is typically very short. Compare H. R.\nRep. No. 95–595, at 276 (“most chapter 13 estates will only\nremain open for 1 or 2 months until confirmation of the\nplan”), with Brief for Neil E. Harl et al. as Amici Curiae\n32–33 (survey of Chapter 12 bankruptcies found the aver-\nage time from filing to confirmation in a district ranged\nfrom nearly five months to over three years). See also 7\nNorton §122:14, at 122–27 (“In Chapter 13, the plan must\nbe filed within 15 days after the filing of the petition,\nunless the time is extended for cause. A Chapter 12 Plan\nmust be filed no later than 90 days after the order for\nrelief, unless the court finds that an extension is substan-\ntially justified” (footnote omitted)).\n   For another, the issue arises differently in a Chapter 13\ncase. That chapter, unlike Chapter 12, contains a special\nprovision that permits the Government to seek §507 prior-\nity treatment of all taxes incurred while the bankruptcy\ncase is pending. §1305 (Government can file proof of claim\nto have postpetition taxes treated as if they had arisen\nbefore the petition was filed).\n   Finally, if uniformity of interpretation between these\ntwo chapters is critical, I do not see the serious harm in\n14                HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntreating the relevant taxes as “administrative expenses”\nin both Chapter 12 and Chapter 13 cases rather than in\nneither. The majority apparently believes that this would\nrender §1305 (the provision permitting the Government to\nseek §507 priority treatment) superfluous. Ante, at 10–12.\nBut that is not so. This interpretation would simply limit\nthe scope of operation of §1305 to the period of time after\nthe Chapter 13 Plan is confirmed but while the Chapter 13\ncase is still pending. And that is likely to be a significant\nperiod of time relative to the preconfirmation period. See\nH. R. Rep. No. 95–595, at 276 (“[M]ost chapter 13 estates\nwill only remain open for 1 or 2 months until confirmation\nof the plan”); §§1325(b)(1), (4) (debtor must commit all his\nprojected disposable income over a 3-year period (some-\ntimes extended to five) to the Plan, unless all unsecured\nclaims can be paid off over a shorter period). The greatest\nChapter 13 harm this interpretation could cause is to re-\nquire the Government to pursue those tax liabilities as\n§507 priority administrative expense claims (rather than\nallow it to choose between §507 priority treatment and\npursuing those claims outside bankruptcy) during the\nrelatively brief period of time between the filing of a peti-\ntion and the Plan’s confirmation.\n   In sum, I would treat a postpetition/preconfirmation tax\nliability as a tax “incurred by the estate,” hence as an\n“administrative expense,” hence as a “clai[m] entitled to\npriority under section 507, unless . . . ,” hence as a claim\nfalling within the scope of the Amendment. Doing so\nwould allow the Amendment to take effect as Congress\nintended.\n                             III\n  The Government argues that, even if tax liabilities\narising during the bankruptcy proceedings are “adminis-\ntrative expenses,” they still do not fall within the Amend-\nment’s scope. It says that neither the Amendment nor\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)          15\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nanything else in §1222(a) provides for the payment of\nadministrative expenses. Rather, that section and its\nAmendment provide only for the payment of “claims.”\n§1222(a)(2) (“The plan shall . . . provide for the full pay-\nment . . . of all claims entitled to priority under section\n507, unless . . .” (emphasis added)). And administrative\nexpenses, the Government says, like all debts that are\nincurred postpetition, are not “claims.”\n   The Government finds support for its view in the fact\nthat that §1222 deals with the contents of a “plan,” while a\nlater section, §1227(a), says that the provisions of a “con-\nfirmed plan bind the debtor, each creditor, [and certain\nothers of no relevance here].” (Emphasis added.) This\nis because the Code defines “creditor” to include only hold-\ners of pre-petition claims, thus excluding holders of\npost-petition claims, such as administrative expenses.\n§101(10).\n   The Government points out that a different Code sec-\ntion, namely §1226(b)(1), provides for the payment of\nadministrative expenses. That section says that “[b]efore\nor at the time of each payment to creditors under the plan,\nthere shall be paid . . . any unpaid claim of the kind\nspecified in section 507(a)(2),” namely “administrative ex-\npenses.” And Congress did not amend §1226(b)(1); it\namended the earlier section, §1222(a).\n   In short, the Government says, the Plan only covers\nthose §507 priority “expenses and claims” that are de-\nscribed as “claims” and can be held by “creditors.” Section\n1226(b)(1), not §1222, deals with administrative expenses.\nThe bottom line of the Government’s chain of logic is, once\nagain, that Congress put the Amendment in the wrong\nplace.\n   I concede that there is some text and legislative history\nthat supports the Government’s view that the word\n“claim” in §1222(a) does not include “administrative ex-\npenses.” See, e.g., §507(a) (referring to “expenses and\n16                HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nclaims” as if they are separate categories); S. Rep. No. 95–\n1106, at 20 (“The committee amendments contain several\nchanges designed to clarify the distinction between a\n‘claim’ (which generally relates to a debt incurred before\nthe bankruptcy petition is filed) and an administrative\nexpense (which is an expense incurred by the trustee after\nthe filing of the petition)”).\n   But the language does not demand the Government’s\nreading. For the Code also uses the word “claim” to cover\nboth prepetition and postpetition claims (such as adminis-\ntrative expenses). E.g., §101(5)(A) (defining a claim as a\n“right to payment”); §726(b) (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (refer-\nring to “claims” that include administrative expenses). In-\ndeed, the very section that the Government says permits\nseparate collection of administrative expenses, namely\n§1226(b)(1), refers to “any unpaid claim” for administra-\ntive expenses. (Emphasis added.) And one can easily read\nthat section as setting forth when, not whether, adminis-\ntrative expenses will be paid under the Plan (i.e., as speci-\nfying that the Plan must provide for the payment of ad-\nministrative expenses before payments to other creditors\nare made).         Thus, reading §1222(a)(2)’s reference to\n“claims” as including administrative expenses need not\nrender §1226(b)(1) surplusage.\n   What about §1227(a), which refers only to “creditor[s]”?\nOne must read it in conjunction with §1228(a), which\nprovides that once the debtor has completed all payments\nunder the Plan, “the court shall grant the debtor a dis-\ncharge of [1] all debts provided for by the plan[,] [2] al-\nlowed under section 503 of this title [which describes ‘ad-\nministrative expenses’] or [3] disallowed under section 502\nof this title . . . .” (Emphasis added.) (The first few words\nof §1227(a)—“[e]xcept as provided in section 1228(a)”—\nexplain why I say “must”; the comma comes from 7 Norton\n§137:2, at 137–3, n. 1, which says that its omission was a\ntypographical error). Thus, by here referring to “adminis-\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)          17\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntrative expenses” (through its reference to §503), Chapter\n12 makes clear that at least some postpetition claims are\nto be discharged once the debtor has completed his pay-\nments under the Plan. That fact, in turn, suggests that\nthe Plan may provide for their payment and that the\nholders of such claims may be bound by the terms of a\nconfirmed Plan.\n  The upshot is that the Government’s second argument\npresents a plausible, but not the only plausible, interpre-\ntation of the Code’s language. And the Government’s\nsecond argument, like the majority’s argument, has a\nproblem, namely that it reduces Congress’ Amendment to\nrubble. For that reason I believe it does not offer the\nbetter interpretation of the relevant language.\n                             IV\n   In sum the phrase tax “incurred by the estate” in\n§503(b) (the “administrative expense” section) and the\nword “claim” in §1222(a) are open to different interpreta-\ntions. Each of the narrower interpretations advanced by\nthe Government or adopted by the Court would either\nexclude postpetition taxes from the phrase taxes “incurred\nby the estate” or exclude all postpetition debts, including\nadministrative expenses, from the word “claim.” In these\nways, these interpretations would, as I have said, prevent\nthe Amendment from accomplishing its basic purpose.\n   A broader interpretation of the word “claim” may allow\nthe Plan to include certain postpetition debts. This, taken\ntogether with a broader interpretation of the phrase tax\n“incurred by the estate,” prevents the Government from\ncollecting postpetition/preconfirmation tax debts outside of\nChapter 12, requiring it to assume a place in the creditor\nqueue. Together these broader interpretations permit the\nAmendment to take effect as intended.\n   I find this last-mentioned consideration determinative.\nIt seems to me unlikely that Congress, having worked on\n18                HALL v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrevisions of the Code for many years with the help of\nBankruptcy experts, and having considered the Amend-\nment several times over a period of years, would have\nmade the drafting mistake that the Government and the\nmajority necessarily imply that it made. Moreover, I be-\nlieve it important that courts interpreting statutes make\nsignificant efforts to allow the provisions of congressional\nstatutes to function in the ways that that the elected\nbranch of Government likely intended and for which it\ncan be held democratically accountable.\n   For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/799760/", "sha1": "891843ff463011f8e4318c7864fc7d715b14a83e", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2012-05-14T07:03:36"}
