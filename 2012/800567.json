ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 11–159.      Argued March 19, 2012—Decided May 21, 2012\nEighteen months after her husband, Robert Capato, died of cancer, re-\n  spondent Karen Capato gave birth to twins conceived through in\n  vitro fertilization using her husband’s frozen sperm. Karen applied\n  for Social Security survivors benefits for the twins. The Social Secu-\n  rity Administration (SSA) denied her application, and the District\n  Court affirmed. In accord with the SSA’s construction of the Social\n  Security Act (Act), the court determined that the twins would qualify\n  for benefits only if, as 42 U. S. C. §416(h)(2)(A) specifies, they could\n  inherit from the deceased wage earner under state intestacy law.\n  The court then found that Robert was domiciled in Florida at his\n  death, and that under Florida law, posthumously conceived children\n  do not qualify for inheritance through intestate succession. The\n  Third Circuit reversed. It concluded that, under §416(e), which de-\n  fines child to mean, inter alia, “the child or legally adopted child of an\n  [insured] individual,” the undisputed biological children of an insured\n  and his widow qualify for survivors benefits without regard to state\n  intestacy law.\nHeld: The SSA’s reading is better attuned to the statute’s text and its\n design to benefit primarily those supported by the deceased wage\n earner in his or her lifetime. Moreover, even if the SSA’s longstand-\n ing interpretation is not the only reasonable one, it is at least a per-\n missible construction entitled to deference under Chevron U. S. A.\n Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837. Pp. 4–\n 16.\n    (a) Congress amended the Act in 1939 to provide that, as relevant\n here, “[e]very child (as defined in section 416(e) of this title)” of a de-\n2                           ASTRUE v. CAPATO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ceased insured individual “shall be entitled to a child’s insurance\n    benefit.” §402(d). Section 416(e), in turn, defines “child” to mean:\n    “(1) the child or legally adopted child of an individual, (2) a stepchild\n    [under certain circumstances], and (3) . . . the grandchild or\n    stepgrandchild of an individual or his spouse [under certain condi-\n    tions].” Unlike §§416(e)(2) and (3), §416(e)(1) lacks any elaboration of\n    the conditions under which a child qualifies for benefits. Section\n    416(h)(2)(A), however, further addresses the term “child,” providing:\n    “In determining whether an applicant is the child or parent of [an]\n    insured individual for purposes of this subchapter, the Commissioner\n    of Social Security shall apply [the intestacy law of the insured indi-\n    vidual’s domiciliary State].” An applicant who does not meet\n    §416(h)(2)(A)’s intestacy-law criterion may nonetheless qualify for\n    benefits under other criteria set forth in §§416(h)(2)(B) and (h)(3), but\n    respondent does not claim eligibility under those other criteria. Reg-\n    ulations promulgated by the SSA closely track §§416(h)(2) and (3) in\n    defining “[w]ho is the insured’s natural child,” 20 CFR §404.355. As\n    the SSA reads the statute, 42 U. S. C. §416(h) governs the meaning of\n    “child” in §416(e)(1) and serves as a gateway through which all appli-\n    cants for insurance benefits as a “child” must pass. Pp. 4–7.\n       (b) While the SSA regards §416(h) as completing §416(e)’s sparse\n    definition of “child,” the Third Circuit held, and respondent contends,\n    that §416(e) alone governs whenever the claimant is a married cou-\n    ple’s biological child. There are conspicuous flaws in the Third Cir-\n    cuit’s and respondent’s reading; the SSA offers the more persuasive\n    interpretation. Pp. 7–15.\n         (1) Nothing in §416(e)’s tautological definition suggests that\n    Congress understood the word “child” to refer only to the children of\n    married parents. The dictionary definitions offered by respondent\n    are not so confined. Moreover, elsewhere in the Act, Congress ex-\n    pressly limited the category of children covered to offspring of a mari-\n    tal union, see §402(d)(3)(A), and contemporaneous statutes similarly\n    distinguish child of a marriage from the unmodified term “child.”\n    Nor does §416(e) indicate that Congress intended “biological” parent-\n    age to be prerequisite to “child” status. A biological parent is not al-\n    ways a child’s parent under law. Furthermore, marriage does not\n    necessarily make a child’s parentage certain, nor does the absence of\n    marriage necessarily make a child’s parentage uncertain. Finally, it\n    is far from obvious that respondent’s proposed definition would cover\n    her posthumously conceived twins, for under Florida law a marriage\n    ends upon the death of a spouse. Pp. 8–10.\n         (2) The SSA finds a key textual cue in §416(h)(2)(A)’s opening in-\n    struction: “In determining whether an applicant is the child . . . of\n    [an] insured individual for purposes of this subchapter,” the Commis-\n                   Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nsioner shall apply state intestacy law. Respondent notes the absence\nof any cross-reference in §416(e) to §416(h), but she overlooks that\n§416(h) provides the crucial link: It requires reference to state intes-\ntacy law to determine child status not just for §416(h) purposes, but\n“for purposes of this subchapter,” which includes both §§402(d) and\n416(e). Having explicitly complemented §416(e) by the definitional\nprovisions contained in §416(h), Congress had no need to place a re-\ndundant cross-reference in §416(e).\n   The Act commonly refers to state law on matters of family status,\nincluding an applicant’s status as a wife, widow, husband, or widow-\ner. See, e.g., §§416(b), (h)(1)(A). The Act also sets duration-of-\nrelationship limitations, see Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749, 777–\n782, and time limits qualify the statutes of several States that accord\ninheritance rights to posthumously conceived children. In contrast,\nno time constraint attends the Third Circuit’s ruling in this case, un-\nder which the biological child of married parents is eligible for survi-\nvors benefits, no matter the length of time between the father’s death\nand the child’s conception and birth.\n   Because a child who may take from a father’s estate is more likely\nto “be dependent during the parent’s life and at his death,” Mathews\nv. Lucas, 427 U. S. 495, 514, reliance on state intestacy law to deter-\nmine who is a “child” serves the Act’s driving objective, which is to\n“provide . . . dependent members of [a wage earner’s] family with pro-\ntection against the hardship occasioned by [the] loss of [the insured’s]\nearnings,” Califano v. Jobst, 434 U. S. 47, 52. Although the Act and\nregulations set different eligibility requirements for adopted children,\nstepchildren, grandchildren, and stepgrandchildren, it hardly follows,\nas respondent argues, that applicants in those categories are treated\nmore advantageously than are children who must meet a §416(h) cri-\nterion. Respondent charges that the SSA’s construction of the Act\nraises serious constitutional concerns under the equal protection\ncomponent of the Due Process Clause. But under rational-basis re-\nview, the appropriate standard here, the regime passed by Congress\neasily passes inspection. Pp. 10–15.\n   (c) Because the SSA’s interpretation of the relevant provisions, is\nat least reasonable, the agency’s reading is entitled to this Court’s\ndeference under Chevron, 467 U. S. 837. Chevron deference is appro-\npriate “when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the\nagency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the\nagency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the ex-\nercise of that authority.” United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218,\n226–227. Here, the SSA’s longstanding interpretation, set forth in\nregulations published after notice-and-comment rulemaking, is nei-\nther “arbitrary or capricious in substance, [n]or manifestly contrary\n4                         ASTRUE v.

ASTRUE, COMMISSIONER OF SOCIAL\n\n  SECURITY, PETITIONER v. KAREN K. CAPATO, \n\n          ON BEHALF OF B. N. C., ET AL. \n\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [May 21, 2012]\n\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Karen and Robert Capato married in 1999. Robert died\nof cancer less than three years later. With the help of in\nvitro fertilization, Karen gave birth to twins 18 months\nafter her husband’s death. Karen’s application for Social\nSecurity survivors benefits for the twins, which the Social\nSecurity Administration (SSA) denied, prompted this lit-\nigation. The technology that made the twins’ conception\nand birth possible, it is safe to say, was not contemplated\nby Congress when the relevant provisions of the Social\nSecurity Act (Act) originated (1939) or were amended to\nread as they now do (1965).\n  Karen Capato, respondent here, relies on the Act’s\ninitial definition of “child” in 42 U. S. C. §416(e): “ ‘[C]hild’\nmeans . . . the child or legally adopted child of an [insured]\nindividual.” Robert was an insured individual, and the\ntwins, it is uncontested, are the biological children of\nKaren and Robert. That satisfies the Act’s terms, and no\nfurther inquiry is in order, Karen maintains. The SSA,\nhowever, identifies subsequent provisions, §§416(h)(2) and\n2                    ASTRUE v. CAPATO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(h)(3)(C), as critical, and reads them to entitle biological\nchildren to benefits only if they qualify for inheritance\nfrom the decedent under state intestacy law, or satisfy one\nof the statutory alternatives to that requirement.\n   We conclude that the SSA’s reading is better attuned to\nthe statute’s text and its design to benefit primarily those\nsupported by the deceased wage earner in his or her life-\ntime. And even if the SSA’s longstanding interpretation is\nnot the only reasonable one, it is at least a permissible\nconstruction that garners the Court’s respect under Chev-\nron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,\nInc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984).\n                              I\n   Karen Capato married Robert Capato in May 1999.\nShortly thereafter, Robert was diagnosed with esophageal\ncancer and was told that the chemotherapy he required\nmight render him sterile. Because the couple wanted\nchildren, Robert, before undergoing chemotherapy, depos-\nited his semen in a sperm bank, where it was frozen and\nstored. Despite Robert’s aggressive treatment regime,\nKaren conceived naturally and gave birth to a son in\nAugust 2001. The Capatos, however, wanted their son to\nhave a sibling.\n   Robert’s health deteriorated in late 2001, and he died in\nFlorida, where he and Karen then resided, in March 2002.\nHis will, executed in Florida, named as beneficiaries the\nson born of his marriage to Karen and two children from\na previous marriage. The will made no provision for chil-\ndren conceived after Robert’s death, although the Capatos\nhad told their lawyer they wanted future offspring to be\nplaced on a par with existing children. Shortly after Rob-\nert’s death, Karen began in vitro fertilization using her\nhusband’s frozen sperm. She conceived in January 2003\nand gave birth to twins in September 2003, 18 months\nafter Robert’s death.\n                      Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n  Karen Capato claimed survivors insurance benefits on\nbehalf of the twins. The SSA denied her application, and\nthe U. S. District Court for the District of New Jersey\naffirmed the agency’s decision. See App. to Pet. for Cert.\n33a (decision of the Administrative Law Judge); id., at\n15a (District Court opinion). In accord with the SSA’s\nconstruction of the statute, the District Court determined\nthat the twins would qualify for benefits only if, as\n§416(h)(2)(A) specifies, they could inherit from the de-\nceased wage earner under state intestacy law. Robert\nCapato died domiciled in Florida, the court found. Under\nthat State’s law, the court noted, a child born posthu-\nmously may inherit through intestate succession only if\nconceived during the decedent’s lifetime. Id., at 27a–28a.1\n  The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed.\nUnder §416(e), the appellate court concluded, “the undis-\nputed biological children of a deceased wage earner and\nhis widow” qualify for survivors benefits without regard to\nstate intestacy law. 631 F. 3d 626, 631 (2011).2 Courts of\nAppeals have divided on the statutory interpretation\nquestion this case presents. Compare ibid. and Gillett-\nNetting v. Barnhart, 371 F. 3d 593, 596–597 (CA9 2004)\n(biological but posthumously conceived child of insured\nwage earner and his widow qualifies for benefits), with\nBeeler v. Astrue, 651 F. 3d 954, 960–964 (CA8 2011), and\n——————\n  1 The District Court observed that Fla. Stat. Ann. §732.106 (West\n\n2010) defines “ ‘afterborn heirs’ ” as “ ‘heirs of the decedent conceived\nbefore his or her death, but born thereafter.’ ” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n27a (emphasis added by District Court). The court also referred to\n§742.17(4), which provides that a posthumously conceived child “ ‘shall\nnot be eligible for a claim against the decedent’s estate unless the child\nhas been provided for by the decedent’s will.’ ” Id., at 28a.\n  2 Because the Third Circuit held that posthumously conceived chil-\n\ndren qualify for survivors benefits as a matter of federal law, it did not\ndefinitively determine “where [Robert] Capato was domiciled at his\ndeath or . . . delve into the law of intestacy of that state.” 631 F. 3d, at\n632, n. 6. These issues, if preserved, may be considered on remand.\n4                        ASTRUE v. CAPATO\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nSchafer v. Astrue, 641 F. 3d 49, 54–63 (CA4 2011) (post-\nhumously conceived child’s qualification for benefits de-\npends on intestacy law of State in which wage earner was\ndomiciled). To resolve the conflict, we granted the Com-\nmissioner’s petition for a writ of certiorari. 565 U. S. ___\n(2011).\n                               II\n   Congress amended the Social Security Act in 1939 to\nprovide a monthly benefit for designated surviving fam-\nily members of a deceased insured wage earner. “Child’s\ninsurance benefits” are among the Act’s family-protective\nmeasures. 53 Stat. 1364, as amended, 42 U. S. C. §402(d).\nAn applicant qualifies for such benefits if she meets the\nAct’s definition of “child,” is unmarried, is below specified\nage limits (18 or 19) or is under a disability which began\nprior to age 22, and was dependent on the insured at the\ntime of the insured’s death. §402(d)(1).3\n   To resolve this case, we must decide whether the Capato\ntwins rank as “child[ren]” under the Act’s definitional\nprovisions. Section 402(d) provides that “[e]very child (as\ndefined in section 416(e) of this title)” of a deceased in-\nsured individual “shall be entitled to a child’s insurance\nbenefit.” Section 416(e), in turn, states: “The term ‘child’\nmeans (1) the child or legally adopted child of an individ-\n——————\n  3 Applicants not in fact dependent on the insured individual may be\n\n“deemed dependent” when the Act so provides. For example, a “legiti-\nmate” child, even if she is not living with or receiving support from\nher parent, is ordinarily “deemed dependent” on that parent. 42 U. S. C.\n§402(d)(3). Further, applicants “deemed” the child of an insured\nindividual under §416(h)(2)(B) or (h)(3) are also “deemed legitimate,”\nhence dependent, even if not living with or receiving support from\nthe parent. §402(d)(3). See also Mathews v. Lucas, 427 U. S. 495, 499,\nn. 2 (1976) (deeming dependent any child who qualifies under\n§416(h)(2)(A)); Tr. of Oral Arg. 13–14 (counsel for the SSA stated, in\nresponse to the Court’s question, that statutory presumptions of de-\npendency are irrebuttable).\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

Unlike\n§§416(e)(2) and (3), which specify the circumstances under\nwhich stepchildren and grandchildren qualify for benefits,\n§416(e)(1) lacks any elaboration. Compare §416(e)(1)\n(referring simply to “the child . . . of an individual”) with,\ne.g., §416(e)(2) (applicant must have been a stepchild for at\nleast nine months before the insured individual’s death).\n    A subsequent definitional provision further addresses\nthe term “child.” Under the heading “Determination of\nfamily status,” §416(h)(2)(A) provides: “In determining\nwhether an applicant is the child or parent of [an] insured\nindividual for purposes of this subchapter, the Commis-\nsioner of Social Security shall apply [the intestacy law of\nthe insured individual’s domiciliary State].”4\n    An applicant for child benefits who does not meet\n§416(h)(2)(A)’s intestacy-law criterion may nonetheless\nqualify for benefits under one of several other criteria the\nAct prescribes. First, an applicant who “is a son or daugh-\nter” of an insured individual, but is not determined to be a\n“child” under the intestacy-law provision, nevertheless\n\n——————\n  4 Section 416(h)(2)(A) also states that persons who, under the law of\n\nthe insured’s domicile, “would have the same status relative to taking\nintestate personal property as a child or parent shall be deemed such.”\nAsked about this prescription, counsel for the SSA responded that it\nwould apply to equitably adopted children. Tr. of Oral Arg. 8–9, 54; see\n20 CFR §404.359 (2011) (an equitably adopted child may be eligible for\nbenefits if the agreement to adopt the child would be recognized under\nstate law as enabling the child to inherit upon the intestate death of\nthe adopting parent).\n6                        ASTRUE v. CAPATO\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nranks as a “child” if the insured and the other parent went\nthrough a marriage ceremony that would have been valid\nbut for certain legal impediments. §416(h)(2)(B). Further,\nan applicant is deemed a “child” if, before death, the in-\nsured acknowledged in writing that the applicant is his or\nher son or daughter, or if the insured had been decreed by\na court to be the father or mother of the applicant, or had\nbeen ordered to pay child support. §416(h)(3)(C)(i). In\naddition, an applicant may gain “child” status upon\nproof that the insured individual was the applicant’s pa-\nrent and “was living with or contributing to the support\nof the applicant” when the insured individual died.\n§416(h)(3)(C)(ii).5\n  The SSA has interpreted these provisions in regulations\nadopted through notice-and-comment rulemaking. The\nregulations state that an applicant may be entitled to\nbenefits “as a natural child, legally adopted child, step-\nchild, grandchild, stepgrandchild, or equitably adopted\nchild.” 20 CFR §404.354. Defining “[w]ho is the insured’s\nnatural child,” §404.355, the regulations closely track\n42 U. S. C. §§416(h)(2) and (h)(3). They state that an\napplicant may qualify for insurance benefits as a “natural\nchild” by meeting any of four conditions: (1) the applicant\n“could inherit the insured’s personal property as his or her\nnatural child under State inheritance laws”; (2) the appli-\ncant is “the insured’s natural child and [his or her parents]\nwent through a ceremony which would have resulted in\na valid marriage between them except for a legal impedi-\nment”; (3) before death, the insured acknowledged in\nwriting his or her parentage of the applicant, was decreed\nby a court to be the applicant’s parent, or was ordered by a\ncourt to contribute to the applicant’s support; or (4) other\nevidence shows that the insured is the applicant’s “natural\n——————\n  5 Respondent does not invoke any of the alternative criteria as a basis\n\nfor the twins’ “child” status.\n                      Cite as: 566 U.

See Beeler, 651\nF. 3d, at 960 (“The regulations make clear that the SSA\ninterprets the Act to mean that the provisions of §416(h)\nare the exclusive means by which an applicant can estab-\nlish ‘child’ status under §416(e) as a natural child.”).6\n                               III\n  Karen Capato argues, and the Third Circuit held, that\n§416(h), far from supplying the governing law, is irrele-\nvant in this case. Instead, the Court of Appeals deter-\nmined, §416(e) alone is dispositive of the controversy. 631\nF. 3d, at 630–631. Under §416(e), “child” means “child of\nan [insured] individual,” and the Capato twins, the Third\nCircuit observed, clearly fit that definition: They are un-\ndeniably the children of Robert Capato, the insured wage\nearner, and his widow, Karen Capato. Section 416(h)\ncomes into play, the court reasoned, only when “a claim-\nant’s status as a deceased wage-earner’s child is in doubt.”\nId., at 631. That limitation, the court suggested, is evi-\ndent from §416(h)’s caption: “Determination of family\nstatus.” Here, “there is no family status to determine,” the\ncourt said, id., at 630, so §416(h) has no role to play.\n  In short, while the SSA regards §416(h) as completing\n§416(e)’s sparse definition of “child,” the Third Circuit\nconsidered each subsection to control different situations:\n§416(h) governs when a child’s family status needs to be\ndetermined; §416(e), when it does not.

The answer\nthat the Third Circuit found plain: whenever the claimant\nis “the biological child of a married couple.” Id., at 630.7\n   We point out, first, some conspicuous flaws in the Third\nCircuit’s and respondent Karen Capato’s reading of the\nAct’s provisions, and then explain why we find the SSA’s\ninterpretation persuasive.\n                               A\n  Nothing in §416(e)’s tautological definition (“ ‘child’\nmeans . . . the child . . . of an individual”) suggests that\nCongress understood the word “child” to refer only to the\nchildren of married parents. The dictionary definitions\noffered by respondent are not so confined. See Webster’s\nNew International Dictionary 465 (2d ed. 1934) (defining\n“child” as, inter alia, “[i]n Law, legitimate offspring; also,\nsometimes, esp. in wills, an adopted child, or an illegiti-\nmate offspring, or any direct descendant, as a grandchild,\nas the intention may appear”); Merriam-Webster’s Colle-\ngiate Dictionary 214 (11th ed. 2003) (“child” means “son or\ndaughter,” or “descendant”). See also Restatement (Third)\nof Property §2.5(1) (1998) (“[a]n individual is the child of\nhis or her genetic parents,” and that may be so “whether\nor not [the parents] are married to each other”). More-\nover, elsewhere in the Act, Congress expressly limited\nthe category of children covered to offspring of a marital\nunion. See §402(d)(3)(A) (referring to the “legitimate . . .\nchild” of an individual). Other contemporaneous statutes\nsimilarly differentiate child of a marriage (“legitimate\nchild”) from the unmodified term “child.” See, e.g., Ser-\nvicemen’s Dependents Allowance Act of 1942, ch. 443,\n——————\n  7 Because the Court of Appeals found the statutory language unam-\n\nbiguous, it had no occasion to “determine whether the [SSA’s] interpre-\ntation is a permissible construction of the statute.” 631 F. 3d, at 631,\nn. 5 (citing Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,\nInc., 467 U. S. 837, 842–843 (1984)).\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

As the SSA points out, “[i]n 1939,\nthere was no such thing as a scientifically proven biologi-\ncal relationship between a child and a father, which is . . .\npart of the reason that the word ‘biological’ appears no-\nwhere in the Act.” Reply Brief 6. Notably, a biological\nparent is not necessarily a child’s parent under law.\nOrdinarily, “a parent-child relationship does not exist\nbetween an adoptee and the adoptee’s genetic parents.”\nUniform Probate Code §2–119(a), 8 U. L. A. 55 (Supp.\n2011) (amended 2008). Moreover, laws directly addressing\nuse of today’s assisted reproduction technology do not\nmake biological parentage a universally determinative\ncriterion. See, e.g., Cal. Fam. Code Ann. §7613(b) (West\nSupp. 2012) (“The donor of semen . . . for use in artificial\ninsemination or in vitro fertilization of a woman other\nthan the donor’s wife is treated in law as if he were not the\nnatural father of a child thereby conceived, unless other-\nwise agreed to in a writing signed by the donor and the\nwoman prior to the conception of the child.”); Mass. Gen.\nLaws, ch. 46, §4B (West 2010) (“Any child born to a mar-\nried woman as a result of artificial insemination with the\nconsent of her husband, shall be considered the legitimate\nchild of the mother and such husband.”).\n   We note, in addition, that marriage does not ever and\nalways make the parentage of a child certain, nor does the\nabsence of marriage necessarily mean that a child’s par-\nentage is uncertain. An unmarried couple can agree that\na child is theirs, while the parentage of a child born during\na marriage may be uncertain. See Reply Brief 11 (“Re-\nspondent errs in treating ‘marital’ and ‘undisputed’ as\n10                      ASTRUE v.

Under Florida law, a marriage\nends upon the death of a spouse. See Price v. Price, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Fla.</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 235, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So.</span> <span class=\"page\">904</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 905 (1934). If that law applies,\nrather than a court-declared preemptive federal law, the\nCapato twins, conceived after the death of their father,\nwould not qualify as “marital” children.8\n                            B\n   Resisting the importation of words not found in\n§416(e)—“child” means “the biological child of married\nparents,” Brief for Respondent 9—the SSA finds a key\ntextual cue in §416(h)(2)(A)’s opening instruction: “In\ndetermining whether an applicant is the child . . . of [an]\ninsured individual for purposes of this subchapter,” the\nCommissioner shall apply state intestacy law. (Emphasis\nadded.) Respondent notes the absence of any cross-\nreference in §416(e) to §416(h). Brief for Respondent 18.\nShe overlooks, however, that §416(h) provides the crucial\nlink. The “subchapter” to which §416(h) refers is Sub-\nchapter II of the Act, which spans §§401 through 434.\nSection 416(h)’s reference to “this subchapter” thus in-\ncludes both §§402(d) and 416(e). Having explicitly com-\nplemented §416(e) by the definitional provisions contained\nin §416(h), Congress had no need to place a redundant\ncross-reference in §416(e). See Schafer, 641 F. 3d, at 54\n——————\n  8 Respondent urges that it would be bizarre to deny benefits to the\n\nCapato twins when, under §416(h)(2)(B), they would have gained\nbenefits had their parents gone through a marriage ceremony that\nwould have been valid save for a legal impediment. Brief for Respond-\nent 26, n. 10; see supra, at 5–6. Whether the Capatos’ marriage cere-\nmony was flawed or flawless, the SSA counters, no marital union was\nextant when the twins were conceived.

It provided that, “[i]n determining whether an\napplicant is the . . . child . . . of [an] insured individual for\npurposes of sections 401–409 of this title, the Board shall\napply [state intestacy law].” 42 U. S. C. §409(m) (1940 ed.)\n(emphasis added). Sections 401–409 embraced §§402(c)\nand 409(k), the statutory predecessors of 42 U. S. C.\n§§402(d) and 416(e) (2006 ed.), respectively.\n   Reference to state law to determine an applicant’s sta-\ntus as a “child” is anything but anomalous. Quite the\nopposite. The Act commonly refers to state law on matters\nof family status. For example, the Act initially defines\n“wife” as “the wife of an [insured] individual,” if certain\nconditions are satisfied. §416(b). Like §416(e), §416(b)\nis, at least in part, tautological (“ ‘wife’ means the [in-\nsured’s] wife”). One must read on, although there is no ex-\npress cross-reference, to §416(h) (rules on “[d]etermination\nof family status”) to complete the definition. Section\n§416(h)(1)(A) directs that, “for purposes of this subchap-\nter,” the law of the insured’s domicile determines whether\n“[the] applicant and [the] insured individual were validly\nmarried,” and if they were not, whether the applicant\nwould nevertheless have “the same status” as a wife under\nthe State’s intestacy law. (Emphasis added.) The Act\nsimilarly defines the terms “widow,” “husband,” and “wid-\nower.” See §§416(c), (f), (g), (h)(1)(A).\n   Indeed, as originally enacted, a single provision man-\ndated the use of state intestacy law for “determining\nwhether an applicant is the wife, widow, child, or parent of\n[an] insured individual.” 42 U. S. C. §409(m) (1940 ed.).\nAll wife, widow, child, and parent applicants thus had to\nsatisfy the same criterion. To be sure, children born dur-\n12                   ASTRUE v. CAPATO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning their parents’ marriage would have readily qualified\nunder the 1939 formulation because of their eligibility\nto inherit under state law. But requiring all “child” ap-\nplicants to qualify under state intestacy law installed a\nsimple test, one that ensured benefits for persons plainly\nwithin the legislators’ contemplation, while avoiding con-\ngressional entanglement in the traditional state-law\nrealm of family relations.\n   Just as the Act generally refers to state law to deter-\nmine whether an applicant qualifies as a wife, widow,\nhusband, widower, 42 U. S. C. §416(h)(1) (2006 ed.), child\nor parent, §416(h)(2)(A), so in several sections (§§416(b),\n(c), (e)(2), (f), (g)), the Act sets duration-of-relationship\nlimitations. See Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749, 777–\n782 (1975) (discussing §416(e)(2)’s requirement that, as\na check against deathbed marriages, a parent-stepchild\nrelationship must exist “not less than nine months imme-\ndiately preceding [insured’s death]”). Time limits also\nqualify the statutes of several States that accord inher-\nitance rights to posthumously conceived children. See Cal.\nProb. Code Ann. §249.5(c) (West Supp. 2012) (allowing\ninheritance if child is in utero within two years of parent’s\ndeath); Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. §15–11–120(11) (2011) (child\nin utero within three years or born within 45 months);\nIowa Code Ann. §633.220A(1) (West Supp. 2012) (child\nborn within two years); La. Rev. Stat.

See also\nUniform Probate Code §2–120(k), 8 U. L. A. 58 (Supp.\n2011) (treating a posthumously conceived child as “in\ngestation at the individual’s death,” but only if specified\ntime limits are met). No time constraints attend the Third\nCircuit’s ruling in this case, under which the biological\nchild of married parents is eligible for survivors benefits,\nno matter the length of time between the father’s death\n                      Cite as: 566 U.

See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n36–37 (counsel for Karen Capato acknowledged that,\nunder the preemptive federal rule he advocated, and the\nThird Circuit adopted, a child born four years after her\nfather’s death would be eligible for benefits).\n   The paths to receipt of benefits laid out in the Act and\nregulations, we must not forget, proceed from Congress’\nperception of the core purpose of the legislation. The aim\nwas not to create a program “generally benefiting needy\npersons”; it was, more particularly, to “provide . . . de-\npendent members of [a wage earner’s] family with protec-\ntion against the hardship occasioned by [the] loss of [the\ninsured’s] earnings.” Califano v. Jobst, 434 U. S. 47, 52\n(1977). We have recognized that “where state intestacy\nlaw provides that a child may take personal property from\na father’s estate, it may reasonably be thought that the\nchild will more likely be dependent during the parent’s life\nand at his death.” Mathews v. Lucas, 427 U. S. 495, 514\n(1976). Reliance on state intestacy law to determine who\nis a “child” thus serves the Act’s driving objective. True,\nthe intestacy criterion yields benefits to some children\noutside the Act’s central concern. Intestacy laws in a\nnumber of States, as just noted, do provide for inheritance\nby posthumously conceived children, see supra, at 12,9 and\nunder federal law, a child conceived shortly before her\nfather’s death may be eligible for benefits even though she\nnever actually received her father’s support. It was none-\ntheless Congress’ prerogative to legislate for the generality\nof cases. It did so here by employing eligibility to inherit\n——————\n   9 But see N. Y.

CAPATO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunder state intestacy law as a workable substitute for bur-\ndensome case-by-case determinations whether the child\nwas, in fact, dependent on her father’s earnings.\n   Respondent argues that on the SSA’s reading, natural\nchildren alone must pass through a §416(h) gateway.\nAdopted children, stepchildren, grandchildren, and step-\ngrandchildren, it is true, are defined in §416(e), and are\nnot further defined in §416(h). Respondent overlooks,\nhowever, that although not touched by §416(h), beneficiar-\nies described in §§416(e)(2) and (e)(3) must meet other\nstatutorily prescribed criteria. In short, the Act and regu-\nlations set different eligibility requirements for adopted\nchildren, stepchildren, grandchildren, and stepgrandchil-\ndren, see 20 CFR §§404.356–404.358, but it hardly follows\nthat applicants in those categories are treated more ad-\nvantageously than are children who must meet a §416(h)\ncriterion.\n   The SSA’s construction of the Act, respondent charges,\nraises serious constitutional concerns under the equal pro-\ntection component of the Due Process Clause. Brief for\nRespondent 42; see Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S.\n636, 638, n. 2 (1975). She alleges: “Under the govern-\nment’s interpretation . . . , posthumously conceived chil-\ndren are treated as an inferior subset of natural children\nwho are ineligible for government benefits simply because\nof their date of birth and method of conception.” Brief for\nRespondent 42–43.\n   Even the Courts of Appeals that have accepted the\nreading of the Act respondent advances have rejected this\nargument. See 631 F. 3d, at 628, n. 1 (citing Vernoff\nv. Astrue, 568 F. 3d 1102, 1112 (CA9 2009)). We have\napplied an intermediate level of scrutiny to laws “bur-\nden[ing] illegitimate children for the sake of punishing the\nillicit relations of their parents, because ‘visiting this\ncondemnation on the head of an infant is illogical and\nunjust.’ ” Clark v.

We therefore need not decide whether\nheightened scrutiny would be appropriate were that the\ncase.10 Under rational-basis review, the regime Congress\nadopted easily passes inspection. As the Ninth Circuit\nheld, that regime is “reasonably related to the govern-\nment’s twin interests in [reserving] benefits [for] those\nchildren who have lost a parent’s support, and in using\nreasonable presumptions to minimize the administrative\nburden of proving dependency on a case-by-case basis.”\nVernoff, 568 F. 3d, at 1112 (citing Mathews, 427 U. S., at\n509).\n                              IV\n  As we have explained, §416(e)(1)’s statement, “[t]he\nterm ‘child’ means . . . the child . . . of an individual,” is a\ndefinition of scant utility without aid from neighboring\nprovisions. See Schafer, 641 F. 3d, at 54. That aid is\nsupplied by §416(h)(2)(A), which completes the definition\nof “child” “for purposes of th[e] subchapter” that includes\n§416(e)(1). Under the completed definition, which the SSA\nemploys, §416(h)(2)(A) refers to state law to determine the\nstatus of a posthumously conceived child. The SSA’s\ninterpretation of the relevant provisions, adhered to with-\nout deviation for many decades, is at least reasonable; the\nagency’s reading is therefore entitled to this Court’s defer-\n——————\n  10 Ironically, while drawing an analogy to the “illogical and unjust”\n\ndiscrimination children born out of wedlock encounter, see Weber v.\nAetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406 U.

Argued March 19, 2012—Decided May 21, 2012\nEighteen months after her husband, Robert Capato, died of cancer, re-\n  spondent Karen Capato gave birth to twins conceived through in\n  vitro fertilization using her husband’s frozen sperm. Karen applied\n  for Social Security survivors benefits for the twins. The Social Secu-\n  rity Administration (SSA) denied her application, and the District\n  Court affirmed. In accord with the SSA’s construction of the Social\n  Security Act (Act), the court determined that the twins would qualify\n  for benefits only if, as 42 U. S. C. §416(h)(2)(A) specifies, they could\n  inherit from the deceased wage earner under state intestacy law.\n  The court then found that Robert was domiciled in Florida at his\n  death, and that under Florida law, posthumously conceived children\n  do not qualify for inheritance through intestate succession. The\n  Third Circuit reversed. It concluded that, under §416(e), which de-\n  fines child to mean, inter alia, “the child or legally adopted child of an\n  [insured] individual,” the undisputed biological children of an insured\n  and his widow qualify for survivors benefits without regard to state\n  intestacy law.\nHeld: The SSA’s reading is better attuned to the statute’s text and its\n design to benefit primarily those supported by the deceased wage\n earner in his or her lifetime.

Pp. 4–\n 16.\n    (a) Congress amended the Act in 1939 to provide that, as relevant\n here, “[e]very child (as defined in section 416(e) of this title)” of a de-\n2                           ASTRUE v. CAPATO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ceased insured individual “shall be entitled to a child’s insurance\n    benefit.” §402(d). Section 416(e), in turn, defines “child” to mean:\n    “(1) the child or legally adopted child of an individual, (2) a stepchild\n    [under certain circumstances], and (3) . . . the grandchild or\n    stepgrandchild of an individual or his spouse [under certain condi-\n    tions].” Unlike §§416(e)(2) and (3), §416(e)(1) lacks any elaboration of\n    the conditions under which a child qualifies for benefits. Section\n    416(h)(2)(A), however, further addresses the term “child,” providing:\n    “In determining whether an applicant is the child or parent of [an]\n    insured individual for purposes of this subchapter, the Commissioner\n    of Social Security shall apply [the intestacy law of the insured indi-\n    vidual’s domiciliary State].” An applicant who does not meet\n    §416(h)(2)(A)’s intestacy-law criterion may nonetheless qualify for\n    benefits under other criteria set forth in §§416(h)(2)(B) and (h)(3), but\n    respondent does not claim eligibility under those other criteria. Reg-\n    ulations promulgated by the SSA closely track §§416(h)(2) and (3) in\n    defining “[w]ho is the insured’s natural child,” 20 CFR §404.355. As\n    the SSA reads the statute, 42 U. S. C. §416(h) governs the meaning of\n    “child” in §416(e)(1) and serves as a gateway through which all appli-\n    cants for insurance benefits as a “child” must pass. Pp. 4–7.\n       (b) While the SSA regards §416(h) as completing §416(e)’s sparse\n    definition of “child,” the Third Circuit held, and respondent contends,\n    that §416(e) alone governs whenever the claimant is a married cou-\n    ple’s biological child. There are conspicuous flaws in the Third Cir-\n    cuit’s and respondent’s reading; the SSA offers the more persuasive\n    interpretation. Pp. 7–15.\n         (1) Nothing in §416(e)’s tautological definition suggests that\n    Congress understood the word “child” to refer only to the children of\n    married parents. The dictionary definitions offered by respondent\n    are not so confined. Moreover, elsewhere in the Act, Congress ex-\n    pressly limited the category of children covered to offspring of a mari-\n    tal union, see §402(d)(3)(A), and contemporaneous statutes similarly\n    distinguish child of a marriage from the unmodified term “child.”\n    Nor does §416(e) indicate that Congress intended “biological” parent-\n    age to be prerequisite to “child” status. A biological parent is not al-\n    ways a child’s parent under law. Furthermore, marriage does not\n    necessarily make a child’s parentage certain, nor does the absence of\n    marriage necessarily make a child’s parentage uncertain. Finally, it\n    is far from obvious that respondent’s proposed definition would cover\n    her posthumously conceived twins, for under Florida law a marriage\n    ends upon the death of a spouse. Pp. 8–10.\n         (2) The SSA finds a key textual cue in §416(h)(2)(A)’s opening in-\n    struction: “In determining whether an applicant is the child . . . of\n    [an] insured individual for purposes of this subchapter,” the Commis-\n                   Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nsioner shall apply state intestacy law. Respondent notes the absence\nof any cross-reference in §416(e) to §416(h), but she overlooks that\n§416(h) provides the crucial link: It requires reference to state intes-\ntacy law to determine child status not just for §416(h) purposes, but\n“for purposes of this subchapter,” which includes both §§402(d) and\n416(e). Having explicitly complemented §416(e) by the definitional\nprovisions contained in §416(h), Congress had no need to place a re-\ndundant cross-reference in §416(e).\n   The Act commonly refers to state law on matters of family status,\nincluding an applicant’s status as a wife, widow, husband, or widow-\ner. See, e.g., §§416(b), (h)(1)(A). The Act also sets duration-of-\nrelationship limitations, see Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749, 777–\n782, and time limits qualify the statutes of several States that accord\ninheritance rights to posthumously conceived children. In contrast,\nno time constraint attends the Third Circuit’s ruling in this case, un-\nder which the biological child of married parents is eligible for survi-\nvors benefits, no matter the length of time between the father’s death\nand the child’s conception and birth.\n   Because a child who may take from a father’s estate is more likely\nto “be dependent during the parent’s life and at his death,” Mathews\nv. Lucas, 427 U. S. 495, 514, reliance on state intestacy law to deter-\nmine who is a “child” serves the Act’s driving objective, which is to\n“provide . . . dependent members of [a wage earner’s] family with pro-\ntection against the hardship occasioned by [the] loss of [the insured’s]\nearnings,” Califano v. Jobst, 434 U. S. 47, 52. Although the Act and\nregulations set different eligibility requirements for adopted children,\nstepchildren, grandchildren, and stepgrandchildren, it hardly follows,\nas respondent argues, that applicants in those categories are treated\nmore advantageously than are children who must meet a §416(h) cri-\nterion. Respondent charges that the SSA’s construction of the Act\nraises serious constitutional concerns under the equal protection\ncomponent of the Due Process Clause. But under rational-basis re-\nview, the appropriate standard here, the regime passed by Congress\neasily passes inspection. Pp. 10–15.\n   (c) Because the SSA’s interpretation of the relevant provisions, is\nat least reasonable, the agency’s reading is entitled to this Court’s\ndeference under Chevron, 467 U. S. 837. Chevron deference is appro-\npriate “when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the\nagency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the\nagency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the ex-\nercise of that authority.” United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218,\n226–227.

Robert died\nof cancer less than three years later. With the help of in\nvitro fertilization, Karen gave birth to twins 18 months\nafter her husband’s death. Karen’s application for Social\nSecurity survivors benefits for the twins, which the Social\nSecurity Administration (SSA) denied, prompted this lit-\nigation. The technology that made the twins’ conception\nand birth possible, it is safe to say, was not contemplated\nby Congress when the relevant provisions of the Social\nSecurity Act (Act) originated (1939) or were amended to\nread as they now do (1965).\n  Karen Capato, respondent here, relies on the Act’s\ninitial definition of “child” in 42 U. S. C. §416(e): “ ‘[C]hild’\nmeans . . . the child or legally adopted child of an [insured]\nindividual.” Robert was an insured individual, and the\ntwins, it is uncontested, are the biological children of\nKaren and Robert. That satisfies the Act’s terms, and no\nfurther inquiry is in order, Karen maintains. The SSA,\nhowever, identifies subsequent provisions, §§416(h)(2) and\n2                    ASTRUE v. CAPATO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(h)(3)(C), as critical, and reads them to entitle biological\nchildren to benefits only if they qualify for inheritance\nfrom the decedent under state intestacy law, or satisfy one\nof the statutory alternatives to that requirement.\n   We conclude that the SSA’s reading is better attuned to\nthe statute’s text and its design to benefit primarily those\nsupported by the deceased wage earner in his or her life-\ntime. And even if the SSA’s longstanding interpretation is\nnot the only reasonable one, it is at least a permissible\nconstruction that garners the Court’s respect under Chev-\nron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,\nInc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984).\n                              I\n   Karen Capato married Robert Capato in May 1999.\nShortly thereafter, Robert was diagnosed with esophageal\ncancer and was told that the chemotherapy he required\nmight render him sterile. Because the couple wanted\nchildren, Robert, before undergoing chemotherapy, depos-\nited his semen in a sperm bank, where it was frozen and\nstored. Despite Robert’s aggressive treatment regime,\nKaren conceived naturally and gave birth to a son in\nAugust 2001. The Capatos, however, wanted their son to\nhave a sibling.\n   Robert’s health deteriorated in late 2001, and he died in\nFlorida, where he and Karen then resided, in March 2002.\nHis will, executed in Florida, named as beneficiaries the\nson born of his marriage to Karen and two children from\na previous marriage. The will made no provision for chil-\ndren conceived after Robert’s death, although the Capatos\nhad told their lawyer they wanted future offspring to be\nplaced on a par with existing children. Shortly after Rob-\nert’s death, Karen began in vitro fertilization using her\nhusband’s frozen sperm. She conceived in January 2003\nand gave birth to twins in September 2003, 18 months\nafter Robert’s death.\n                      Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n  Karen Capato claimed survivors insurance benefits on\nbehalf of the twins. The SSA denied her application, and\nthe U. S. District Court for the District of New Jersey\naffirmed the agency’s decision. See App. to Pet. for Cert.\n33a (decision of the Administrative Law Judge); id., at\n15a (District Court opinion). In accord with the SSA’s\nconstruction of the statute, the District Court determined\nthat the twins would qualify for benefits only if, as\n§416(h)(2)(A) specifies, they could inherit from the de-\nceased wage earner under state intestacy law. Robert\nCapato died domiciled in Florida, the court found. Under\nthat State’s law, the court noted, a child born posthu-\nmously may inherit through intestate succession only if\nconceived during the decedent’s lifetime. Id., at 27a–28a.1\n  The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed.\nUnder §416(e), the appellate court concluded, “the undis-\nputed biological children of a deceased wage earner and\nhis widow” qualify for survivors benefits without regard to\nstate intestacy law. 631 F. 3d 626, 631 (2011).2 Courts of\nAppeals have divided on the statutory interpretation\nquestion this case presents. Compare ibid. and Gillett-\nNetting v. Barnhart, 371 F. 3d 593, 596–597 (CA9 2004)\n(biological but posthumously conceived child of insured\nwage earner and his widow qualifies for benefits), with\nBeeler v. Astrue, 651 F. 3d 954, 960–964 (CA8 2011), and\n——————\n  1 The District Court observed that Fla. Stat. Ann. §732.106 (West\n\n2010) defines “ ‘afterborn heirs’ ” as “ ‘heirs of the decedent conceived\nbefore his or her death, but born thereafter.’ ” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n27a (emphasis added by District Court). The court also referred to\n§742.17(4), which provides that a posthumously conceived child “ ‘shall\nnot be eligible for a claim against the decedent’s estate unless the child\nhas been provided for by the decedent’s will.’ ” Id., at 28a.\n  2 Because the Third Circuit held that posthumously conceived chil-\n\ndren qualify for survivors benefits as a matter of federal law, it did not\ndefinitively determine “where [Robert] Capato was domiciled at his\ndeath or . . . delve into the law of intestacy of that state.” 631 F. 3d, at\n632, n. 6. These issues, if preserved, may be considered on remand.\n4                        ASTRUE v. CAPATO\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nSchafer v. Astrue, 641 F. 3d 49, 54–63 (CA4 2011) (post-\nhumously conceived child’s qualification for benefits de-\npends on intestacy law of State in which wage earner was\ndomiciled). To resolve the conflict, we granted the Com-\nmissioner’s petition for a writ of certiorari. 565 U. S. ___\n(2011).\n                               II\n   Congress amended the Social Security Act in 1939 to\nprovide a monthly benefit for designated surviving fam-\nily members of a deceased insured wage earner. “Child’s\ninsurance benefits” are among the Act’s family-protective\nmeasures. 53 Stat. 1364, as amended, 42 U. S. C. §402(d).\nAn applicant qualifies for such benefits if she meets the\nAct’s definition of “child,” is unmarried, is below specified\nage limits (18 or 19) or is under a disability which began\nprior to age 22, and was dependent on the insured at the\ntime of the insured’s death. §402(d)(1).3\n   To resolve this case, we must decide whether the Capato\ntwins rank as “child[ren]” under the Act’s definitional\nprovisions. Section 402(d) provides that “[e]very child (as\ndefined in section 416(e) of this title)” of a deceased in-\nsured individual “shall be entitled to a child’s insurance\nbenefit.” Section 416(e), in turn, states: “The term ‘child’\nmeans (1) the child or legally adopted child of an individ-\n——————\n  3 Applicants not in fact dependent on the insured individual may be\n\n“deemed dependent” when the Act so provides. For example, a “legiti-\nmate” child, even if she is not living with or receiving support from\nher parent, is ordinarily “deemed dependent” on that parent. 42 U. S. C.\n§402(d)(3). Further, applicants “deemed” the child of an insured\nindividual under §416(h)(2)(B) or (h)(3) are also “deemed legitimate,”\nhence dependent, even if not living with or receiving support from\nthe parent. §402(d)(3).

S. 495, 499,\nn. 2 (1976) (deeming dependent any child who qualifies under\n§416(h)(2)(A)); Tr. of Oral Arg. 13–14 (counsel for the SSA stated, in\nresponse to the Court’s question, that statutory presumptions of de-\npendency are irrebuttable).\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

Unlike\n§§416(e)(2) and (3), which specify the circumstances under\nwhich stepchildren and grandchildren qualify for benefits,\n§416(e)(1) lacks any elaboration. Compare §416(e)(1)\n(referring simply to “the child . . . of an individual”) with,\ne.g., §416(e)(2) (applicant must have been a stepchild for at\nleast nine months before the insured individual’s death).\n    A subsequent definitional provision further addresses\nthe term “child.” Under the heading “Determination of\nfamily status,” §416(h)(2)(A) provides: “In determining\nwhether an applicant is the child or parent of [an] insured\nindividual for purposes of this subchapter, the Commis-\nsioner of Social Security shall apply [the intestacy law of\nthe insured individual’s domiciliary State].”4\n    An applicant for child benefits who does not meet\n§416(h)(2)(A)’s intestacy-law criterion may nonetheless\nqualify for benefits under one of several other criteria the\nAct prescribes. First, an applicant who “is a son or daugh-\nter” of an insured individual, but is not determined to be a\n“child” under the intestacy-law provision, nevertheless\n\n——————\n  4 Section 416(h)(2)(A) also states that persons who, under the law of\n\nthe insured’s domicile, “would have the same status relative to taking\nintestate personal property as a child or parent shall be deemed such.”\nAsked about this prescription, counsel for the SSA responded that it\nwould apply to equitably adopted children. Tr. of Oral Arg. 8–9, 54; see\n20 CFR §404.359 (2011) (an equitably adopted child may be eligible for\nbenefits if the agreement to adopt the child would be recognized under\nstate law as enabling the child to inherit upon the intestate death of\nthe adopting parent).\n6                        ASTRUE v. CAPATO\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nranks as a “child” if the insured and the other parent went\nthrough a marriage ceremony that would have been valid\nbut for certain legal impediments. §416(h)(2)(B). Further,\nan applicant is deemed a “child” if, before death, the in-\nsured acknowledged in writing that the applicant is his or\nher son or daughter, or if the insured had been decreed by\na court to be the father or mother of the applicant, or had\nbeen ordered to pay child support. §416(h)(3)(C)(i). In\naddition, an applicant may gain “child” status upon\nproof that the insured individual was the applicant’s pa-\nrent and “was living with or contributing to the support\nof the applicant” when the insured individual died.\n§416(h)(3)(C)(ii).5\n  The SSA has interpreted these provisions in regulations\nadopted through notice-and-comment rulemaking. The\nregulations state that an applicant may be entitled to\nbenefits “as a natural child, legally adopted child, step-\nchild, grandchild, stepgrandchild, or equitably adopted\nchild.” 20 CFR §404.354. Defining “[w]ho is the insured’s\nnatural child,” §404.355, the regulations closely track\n42 U. S. C. §§416(h)(2) and (h)(3). They state that an\napplicant may qualify for insurance benefits as a “natural\nchild” by meeting any of four conditions: (1) the applicant\n“could inherit the insured’s personal property as his or her\nnatural child under State inheritance laws”; (2) the appli-\ncant is “the insured’s natural child and [his or her parents]\nwent through a ceremony which would have resulted in\na valid marriage between them except for a legal impedi-\nment”; (3) before death, the insured acknowledged in\nwriting his or her parentage of the applicant, was decreed\nby a court to be the applicant’s parent, or was ordered by a\ncourt to contribute to the applicant’s support; or (4) other\nevidence shows that the insured is the applicant’s “natural\n——————\n  5 Respondent does not invoke any of the alternative criteria as a basis\n\nfor the twins’ “child” status.\n                      Cite as: 566 U.

S. C. §416(h) gov-\nerns the meaning of “child” in §416(e)(1). In other words,\n§416(h) is a gateway through which all applicants for in-\nsurance benefits as a “child” must pass. See Beeler, 651\nF. 3d, at 960 (“The regulations make clear that the SSA\ninterprets the Act to mean that the provisions of §416(h)\nare the exclusive means by which an applicant can estab-\nlish ‘child’ status under §416(e) as a natural child.”).6\n                               III\n  Karen Capato argues, and the Third Circuit held, that\n§416(h), far from supplying the governing law, is irrele-\nvant in this case. Instead, the Court of Appeals deter-\nmined, §416(e) alone is dispositive of the controversy. 631\nF. 3d, at 630–631. Under §416(e), “child” means “child of\nan [insured] individual,” and the Capato twins, the Third\nCircuit observed, clearly fit that definition: They are un-\ndeniably the children of Robert Capato, the insured wage\nearner, and his widow, Karen Capato. Section 416(h)\ncomes into play, the court reasoned, only when “a claim-\nant’s status as a deceased wage-earner’s child is in doubt.”\nId., at 631. That limitation, the court suggested, is evi-\ndent from §416(h)’s caption: “Determination of family\nstatus.” Here, “there is no family status to determine,” the\ncourt said, id., at 630, so §416(h) has no role to play.\n  In short, while the SSA regards §416(h) as completing\n§416(e)’s sparse definition of “child,” the Third Circuit\nconsidered each subsection to control different situations:\n§416(h) governs when a child’s family status needs to be\ndetermined; §416(e), when it does not.

The dictionary definitions\noffered by respondent are not so confined. See Webster’s\nNew International Dictionary 465 (2d ed. 1934) (defining\n“child” as, inter alia, “[i]n Law, legitimate offspring; also,\nsometimes, esp. in wills, an adopted child, or an illegiti-\nmate offspring, or any direct descendant, as a grandchild,\nas the intention may appear”); Merriam-Webster’s Colle-\ngiate Dictionary 214 (11th ed. 2003) (“child” means “son or\ndaughter,” or “descendant”). See also Restatement (Third)\nof Property §2.5(1) (1998) (“[a]n individual is the child of\nhis or her genetic parents,” and that may be so “whether\nor not [the parents] are married to each other”). More-\nover, elsewhere in the Act, Congress expressly limited\nthe category of children covered to offspring of a marital\nunion. See §402(d)(3)(A) (referring to the “legitimate . . .\nchild” of an individual). Other contemporaneous statutes\nsimilarly differentiate child of a marriage (“legitimate\nchild”) from the unmodified term “child.” See, e.g., Ser-\nvicemen’s Dependents Allowance Act of 1942, ch. 443,\n——————\n  7 Because the Court of Appeals found the statutory language unam-\n\nbiguous, it had no occasion to “determine whether the [SSA’s] interpre-\ntation is a permissible construction of the statute.” 631 F. 3d, at 631,\nn. 5 (citing Chevron U.

As the SSA points out, “[i]n 1939,\nthere was no such thing as a scientifically proven biologi-\ncal relationship between a child and a father, which is . . .\npart of the reason that the word ‘biological’ appears no-\nwhere in the Act.” Reply Brief 6. Notably, a biological\nparent is not necessarily a child’s parent under law.\nOrdinarily, “a parent-child relationship does not exist\nbetween an adoptee and the adoptee’s genetic parents.”\nUniform Probate Code §2–119(a), 8 U. L. A. 55 (Supp.\n2011) (amended 2008). Moreover, laws directly addressing\nuse of today’s assisted reproduction technology do not\nmake biological parentage a universally determinative\ncriterion. See, e.g., Cal. Fam. Code Ann. §7613(b) (West\nSupp. 2012) (“The donor of semen . . . for use in artificial\ninsemination or in vitro fertilization of a woman other\nthan the donor’s wife is treated in law as if he were not the\nnatural father of a child thereby conceived, unless other-\nwise agreed to in a writing signed by the donor and the\nwoman prior to the conception of the child.”); Mass. Gen.\nLaws, ch. 46, §4B (West 2010) (“Any child born to a mar-\nried woman as a result of artificial insemination with the\nconsent of her husband, shall be considered the legitimate\nchild of the mother and such husband.”).\n   We note, in addition, that marriage does not ever and\nalways make the parentage of a child certain, nor does the\nabsence of marriage necessarily mean that a child’s par-\nentage is uncertain. An unmarried couple can agree that\na child is theirs, while the parentage of a child born during\na marriage may be uncertain. See Reply Brief 11 (“Re-\nspondent errs in treating ‘marital’ and ‘undisputed’ as\n10                      ASTRUE v. CAPATO\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nhaving the same meaning.”).\n  Finally, it is far from obvious that Karen Capato’s pro-\nposed definition—“biological child of married parents,” see\nBrief for Respondent 9—would cover the posthumously\nconceived Capato twins. Under Florida law, a marriage\nends upon the death of a spouse. See Price v. Price, 114\nFla. 233, 235, 153 So. 904, 905 (1934). If that law applies,\nrather than a court-declared preemptive federal law, the\nCapato twins, conceived after the death of their father,\nwould not qualify as “marital” children.8\n                            B\n   Resisting the importation of words not found in\n§416(e)—“child” means “the biological child of married\nparents,” Brief for Respondent 9—the SSA finds a key\ntextual cue in §416(h)(2)(A)’s opening instruction: “In\ndetermining whether an applicant is the child . . . of [an]\ninsured individual for purposes of this subchapter,” the\nCommissioner shall apply state intestacy law. (Emphasis\nadded.) Respondent notes the absence of any cross-\nreference in §416(e) to §416(h). Brief for Respondent 18.\nShe overlooks, however, that §416(h) provides the crucial\nlink. The “subchapter” to which §416(h) refers is Sub-\nchapter II of the Act, which spans §§401 through 434.\nSection 416(h)’s reference to “this subchapter” thus in-\ncludes both §§402(d) and 416(e). Having explicitly com-\nplemented §416(e) by the definitional provisions contained\nin §416(h), Congress had no need to place a redundant\ncross-reference in §416(e). See Schafer, 641 F. 3d, at 54\n——————\n  8 Respondent urges that it would be bizarre to deny benefits to the\n\nCapato twins when, under §416(h)(2)(B), they would have gained\nbenefits had their parents gone through a marriage ceremony that\nwould have been valid save for a legal impediment. Brief for Respond-\nent 26, n. 10; see supra, at 5–6. Whether the Capatos’ marriage cere-\nmony was flawed or flawless, the SSA counters, no marital union was\nextant when the twins were conceived.

S. ____ (2012)             11\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n(Congress, in §416(h)(2)(A), provided “plain and explicit\ninstruction on how the determination of child status\nshould be made”; on this point, the statute’s text “could\nhardly be more clear.”).\n   The original version of today’s §416(h) was similarly\ndrafted. It provided that, “[i]n determining whether an\napplicant is the . . . child . . . of [an] insured individual for\npurposes of sections 401–409 of this title, the Board shall\napply [state intestacy law].” 42 U. S. C. §409(m) (1940 ed.)\n(emphasis added). Sections 401–409 embraced §§402(c)\nand 409(k), the statutory predecessors of 42 U. S. C.\n§§402(d) and 416(e) (2006 ed.), respectively.\n   Reference to state law to determine an applicant’s sta-\ntus as a “child” is anything but anomalous. Quite the\nopposite. The Act commonly refers to state law on matters\nof family status. For example, the Act initially defines\n“wife” as “the wife of an [insured] individual,” if certain\nconditions are satisfied. §416(b). Like §416(e), §416(b)\nis, at least in part, tautological (“ ‘wife’ means the [in-\nsured’s] wife”). One must read on, although there is no ex-\npress cross-reference, to §416(h) (rules on “[d]etermination\nof family status”) to complete the definition. Section\n§416(h)(1)(A) directs that, “for purposes of this subchap-\nter,” the law of the insured’s domicile determines whether\n“[the] applicant and [the] insured individual were validly\nmarried,” and if they were not, whether the applicant\nwould nevertheless have “the same status” as a wife under\nthe State’s intestacy law. (Emphasis added.) The Act\nsimilarly defines the terms “widow,” “husband,” and “wid-\nower.” See §§416(c), (f), (g), (h)(1)(A).\n   Indeed, as originally enacted, a single provision man-\ndated the use of state intestacy law for “determining\nwhether an applicant is the wife, widow, child, or parent of\n[an] insured individual.” 42 U. S. C. §409(m) (1940 ed.).\nAll wife, widow, child, and parent applicants thus had to\nsatisfy the same criterion. To be sure, children born dur-\n12                   ASTRUE v. CAPATO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning their parents’ marriage would have readily qualified\nunder the 1939 formulation because of their eligibility\nto inherit under state law. But requiring all “child” ap-\nplicants to qualify under state intestacy law installed a\nsimple test, one that ensured benefits for persons plainly\nwithin the legislators’ contemplation, while avoiding con-\ngressional entanglement in the traditional state-law\nrealm of family relations.\n   Just as the Act generally refers to state law to deter-\nmine whether an applicant qualifies as a wife, widow,\nhusband, widower, 42 U. S. C. §416(h)(1) (2006 ed.), child\nor parent, §416(h)(2)(A), so in several sections (§§416(b),\n(c), (e)(2), (f), (g)), the Act sets duration-of-relationship\nlimitations. See Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749, 777–\n782 (1975) (discussing §416(e)(2)’s requirement that, as\na check against deathbed marriages, a parent-stepchild\nrelationship must exist “not less than nine months imme-\ndiately preceding [insured’s death]”). Time limits also\nqualify the statutes of several States that accord inher-\nitance rights to posthumously conceived children. See Cal.\nProb. Code Ann. §249.5(c) (West Supp. 2012) (allowing\ninheritance if child is in utero within two years of parent’s\ndeath); Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. §15–11–120(11) (2011) (child\nin utero within three years or born within 45 months);\nIowa Code Ann. §633.220A(1) (West Supp. 2012) (child\nborn within two years); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §9:391.1(A)\n(West 2008) (child born within three years); N. D. Cent.\nCode Ann. §30.1–04–19(11) (Lexis 2001) (child in utero\nwithin three years or born within 45 months). See also\nUniform Probate Code §2–120(k), 8 U. L. A. 58 (Supp.\n2011) (treating a posthumously conceived child as “in\ngestation at the individual’s death,” but only if specified\ntime limits are met). No time constraints attend the Third\nCircuit’s ruling in this case, under which the biological\nchild of married parents is eligible for survivors benefits,\nno matter the length of time between the father’s death\n                      Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nand the child’s conception and birth. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n36–37 (counsel for Karen Capato acknowledged that,\nunder the preemptive federal rule he advocated, and the\nThird Circuit adopted, a child born four years after her\nfather’s death would be eligible for benefits).\n   The paths to receipt of benefits laid out in the Act and\nregulations, we must not forget, proceed from Congress’\nperception of the core purpose of the legislation. The aim\nwas not to create a program “generally benefiting needy\npersons”; it was, more particularly, to “provide . . . de-\npendent members of [a wage earner’s] family with protec-\ntion against the hardship occasioned by [the] loss of [the\ninsured’s] earnings.” Califano v. Jobst, 434 U. S. 47, 52\n(1977). We have recognized that “where state intestacy\nlaw provides that a child may take personal property from\na father’s estate, it may reasonably be thought that the\nchild will more likely be dependent during the parent’s life\nand at his death.” Mathews v. Lucas, 427 U. S. 495, 514\n(1976). Reliance on state intestacy law to determine who\nis a “child” thus serves the Act’s driving objective. True,\nthe intestacy criterion yields benefits to some children\noutside the Act’s central concern. Intestacy laws in a\nnumber of States, as just noted, do provide for inheritance\nby posthumously conceived children, see supra, at 12,9 and\nunder federal law, a child conceived shortly before her\nfather’s death may be eligible for benefits even though she\nnever actually received her father’s support. It was none-\ntheless Congress’ prerogative to legislate for the generality\nof cases. It did so here by employing eligibility to inherit\n——————\n   9 But see N. Y.

CAPATO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunder state intestacy law as a workable substitute for bur-\ndensome case-by-case determinations whether the child\nwas, in fact, dependent on her father’s earnings.\n   Respondent argues that on the SSA’s reading, natural\nchildren alone must pass through a §416(h) gateway.\nAdopted children, stepchildren, grandchildren, and step-\ngrandchildren, it is true, are defined in §416(e), and are\nnot further defined in §416(h). Respondent overlooks,\nhowever, that although not touched by §416(h), beneficiar-\nies described in §§416(e)(2) and (e)(3) must meet other\nstatutorily prescribed criteria. In short, the Act and regu-\nlations set different eligibility requirements for adopted\nchildren, stepchildren, grandchildren, and stepgrandchil-\ndren, see 20 CFR §§404.356–404.358, but it hardly follows\nthat applicants in those categories are treated more ad-\nvantageously than are children who must meet a §416(h)\ncriterion.\n   The SSA’s construction of the Act, respondent charges,\nraises serious constitutional concerns under the equal pro-\ntection component of the Due Process Clause. Brief for\nRespondent 42; see Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S.\n636, 638, n. 2 (1975). She alleges: “Under the govern-\nment’s interpretation . . . , posthumously conceived chil-\ndren are treated as an inferior subset of natural children\nwho are ineligible for government benefits simply because\nof their date of birth and method of conception.” Brief for\nRespondent 42–43.\n   Even the Courts of Appeals that have accepted the\nreading of the Act respondent advances have rejected this\nargument. See 631 F. 3d, at 628, n. 1 (citing Vernoff\nv. Astrue, 568 F. 3d 1102, 1112 (CA9 2009)). We have\napplied an intermediate level of scrutiny to laws “bur-\nden[ing] illegitimate children for the sake of punishing the\nillicit relations of their parents, because ‘visiting this\ncondemnation on the head of an infant is illogical and\nunjust.’ ” Clark v. Jeter, 486 U. S. 456, 461 (1988) (quoting\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                  15\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nWeber v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406 U. S. 164, 175\n(1972)). No showing has been made that posthumously\nconceived children share the characteristics that prompted\nour skepticism of classifications disadvantaging children\nof unwed parents. We therefore need not decide whether\nheightened scrutiny would be appropriate were that the\ncase.10 Under rational-basis review, the regime Congress\nadopted easily passes inspection. As the Ninth Circuit\nheld, that regime is “reasonably related to the govern-\nment’s twin interests in [reserving] benefits [for] those\nchildren who have lost a parent’s support, and in using\nreasonable presumptions to minimize the administrative\nburden of proving dependency on a case-by-case basis.”\nVernoff, 568 F. 3d, at 1112 (citing Mathews, 427 U. S., at\n509).\n                              IV\n  As we have explained, §416(e)(1)’s statement, “[t]he\nterm ‘child’ means . . . the child . . . of an individual,” is a\ndefinition of scant utility without aid from neighboring\nprovisions. See Schafer, 641 F. 3d, at 54. That aid is\nsupplied by §416(h)(2)(A), which completes the definition\nof “child” “for purposes of th[e] subchapter” that includes\n§416(e)(1). Under the completed definition, which the SSA\nemploys, §416(h)(2)(A) refers to state law to determine the\nstatus of a posthumously conceived child. The SSA’s\ninterpretation of the relevant provisions, adhered to with-\nout deviation for many decades, is at least reasonable; the\nagency’s reading is therefore entitled to this Court’s defer-\n——————\n  10 Ironically, while drawing an analogy to the “illogical and unjust”\n\ndiscrimination children born out of wedlock encounter, see Weber v.\nAetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406 U. S. 164, 175–176 (1972), respond-\nent asks us to differentiate between children whose parents were\nmarried and children whose parents’ liaisons were not blessed by clergy\nor the State.

S. 837.\n   Chevron deference is appropriate “when it appears that\nCongress delegated authority to the agency generally to\nmake rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency\ninterpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the\nexercise of that authority.” United States v. Mead Corp.,\n533 U. S. 218, 226–227 (2001). Here, as already noted, the\nSSA’s longstanding interpretation is set forth in regu-\nlations published after notice-and-comment rulemaking.\nSee supra, at 6–7. Congress gave the Commissioner au-\nthority to promulgate rules “necessary or appropriate to\ncarry out” the Commissioner’s functions and the relevant\nstatutory provisions. See 42 U. S.
