Argued January 18, 2012—Decided May 21, 2012*\nTitle 8 U. S. C. §1229b(a) authorizes the Attorney General to cancel the\n  removal of an alien from the United States who, among other things,\n  has held the status of a lawful permanent resident (LPR) for at least\n  five years, §1229b(a)(1), and has lived in the United States for at\n  least seven continuous years after a lawful admission, §1229b(a)(2).\n  These cases concern whether the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA\n  or Board) should impute a parent’s years of continuous residence or\n  LPR status to his or her child. That issue arises because a child may\n  enter the country lawfully, or may gain LPR status, after one of his\n  parents does—meaning that a parent may satisfy §1229b(a)(1) or\n  §1229b(a)(2), while his child, considered independently, does not. In\n  In re Escobar, 24 I. & N. Dec. 231, the BIA concluded that an alien\n  must meet §1229b(a)’s requirements on his own. But the Ninth Cir-\n  cuit found the Board’s position unreasonable, holding that\n  §1229b(a)(1) and §1229b(a)(2) require imputation. See Mercado-\n  Zazueta v. Holder, 580 F. 3d 1102; Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, 430\n  F. 3d 1013.\n     Respondent Martinez Gutierrez illegally entered the country with\n  his family in 1989, when he was 5 years old. Martinez Gutierrez’s fa-\n  ther was lawfully admitted to the country two years later as an LPR.\n  But Martinez Gutierrez was neither lawfully admitted nor given LPR\n  status until 2003. Two years after that, he was apprehended for\n  smuggling undocumented aliens across the border. Admitting the of-\n  fense, he sought cancellation of removal. The Immigration Judge\n——————\n  * Together with No. 10–1543, Holder, Attorney General v. Sawyers,\nalso on certiorari to the same court.\n2                 HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    concluded that Martinez Gutierrez qualified for relief because of his\n    father’s immigration history, even though Martinez Gutierrez could\n    not satisfy §1229b(a)(1) or §1229b(a)(2) on his own. Relying on Esco-\n    bar, the BIA reversed. The Ninth Circuit then granted Martinez\n    Gutierrez’s petition for review and remanded the case to the Board\n    for reconsideration in light of its contrary decisions.\n       Respondent Sawyers was lawfully admitted as an LPR in October\n    1995, when he was 15 years old. At that time, his mother had al-\n    ready resided in the country for six consecutive years following a law-\n    ful entry. After Sawyers was convicted of a drug offense in August\n    2002, the Government began removal proceedings. The Immigration\n    Judge found Sawyers ineligible for cancellation of removal because he\n    could not satisfy §1229b(a)(2). The BIA affirmed, and Sawyers peti-\n    tioned the Ninth Circuit for review. There, he argued that the Board\n    should have counted his mother’s years of residency while he was a\n    minor toward §1229b(a)(2)’s 7-year continuous-residency require-\n    ment. The Court of Appeals granted the petition and remanded the\n    case to the BIA.\nHeld: The BIA’s rejection of imputation is based on a permissible con-\n struction of §1229b(a). Pp. 6–13.\n    (a) The Board has required each alien seeking cancellation of re-\n moval to satisfy §1229b(a)’s requirements on his own, without relying\n on a parent’s years of continuous residence or immigration status.\n That position prevails if it is a reasonable construction of the statute,\n whether or not it is the only possible interpretation or even the one a\n court might think best. See e.g., Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Re-\n sources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843–844, and n. 11. The\n BIA’s approach satisfies this standard.\n    The Board’s position is consistent with the statute’s text. Section\n 1229b(a) does not mention—much less require—imputation. Instead,\n it simply calls for “the alien” to meet the prerequisites for cancella-\n tion of removal. See §§1101(a)(13)(A) and (a)(33). Respondents con-\n tend that this language does not foreclose imputation, but even if so,\n that is not enough to require the Board to adopt that policy. Pp. 6–7.\n    (b) Neither does the statute’s history and context mandate imputa-\n tion. Section 1229b(a) replaced former §212(c) of the Immigration\n and Nationality Act (INA), which allowed the Attorney General to\n prevent the removal of an alien with LPR status who had maintained\n a “lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years” in this\n country. Like §1229b(a), §212(c) was silent on imputation. But every\n Court of Appeals that confronted the question concluded that, in de-\n termining eligibility for §212(c) relief, the Board should impute a\n parent’s years of domicile to his or her child. Based on this history,\n Sawyers contends that Congress would have understood §1229b(a)’s\n                    Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                    3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n language to provide for imputation. But in enacting §1229b(a), Con-\n gress eliminated the very term—“domicile”—on which the appeals\n courts had founded their imputation decisions. And the doctrine of\n congressional ratification applies only when Congress reenacts a\n statute without relevant change. See Jama v. Immigration and Cus-\n toms Enforcement, 543 U. S. 335, 349.\n   Nor do the INA’s purposes demand imputation. As respondents\n correctly observe, many provisions of immigration law advance the\n goals of promoting family unity and providing relief to aliens with\n strong ties to this country. But these are not the INA’s only goals,\n and Congress did not pursue them at all costs. For example, aliens\n convicted of aggravated felonies are ineligible for cancellation of\n removal, regardless of the strength of their family ties, see\n §1229b(a)(3). In addition, as these cases show, not every alien with\n LPR status can immediately get the same for a spouse or minor child.\n A silent statute cannot be read as requiring imputation just because\n that rule would be family-friendly. Pp. 7–10.\n   (c) Respondents advance two additional arguments for why the\n Board’s position is not entitled to Chevron deference. First, they\n claim that the Board’s approach to §1229b(a) is arbitrary because it is\n inconsistent with the Board’s acceptance of imputation under other,\n similar provisions that are silent on the matter. See §1182(k) and\n §1181(b). But the Board’s decision in Escobar provided a reasoned\n explanation for these divergent results: The Board imputes matters\n involving an alien’s state of mind, while declining to impute objective\n conditions or characteristics. See 24 I. & N. Dec., at 233–234, and\n n. 4. Section 1229b(a) hinges on the objective facts of immigration\n status and place of residence. See id., at 233. So the Board’s\n approach to §1229b(a) largely follows from one straightforward\n distinction.\n   Second, respondents claim that the BIA adopted its no-imputation\n rule only because it thought Congress had left it no other choice. But\n Escobar belies this contention.       The Board did explain how\n §1229b(a)’s text supports its no-imputation policy. But the Board al-\n so brought its experience and expertise to bear on the matter: It not-\n ed that there was no precedent in its decisions for imputing status or\n residence, and it argued that allowing imputation under §1229b(a)\n would create anomalies in the statutory scheme. Escobar thus ex-\n pressed the BIA’s view that statutory text, administrative practice,\n and regulatory policy all pointed toward disallowing imputation. In\n making that case, the opinion reads like a multitude of agency inter-\n pretations to which this and other courts have routinely deferred.\n Pp. 10–13.\nNo. 10–1542, 411 Fed.

S. C. §1229b(a), authorizes\nthe Attorney General to cancel the removal of an alien\nfrom the United States so long as the alien satisfies cer-\ntain criteria. One of those criteria relates to the length of\ntime an alien has lawfully resided in the United States,\nand another to the length of time he has held permanent\nresident status here. We consider whether the Board of\nImmigration Appeals (BIA or Board) could reasonably\nconclude that an alien living in this country as a child\nmust meet those requirements on his own, without count-\ning a parent’s years of residence or immigration status.\nWe hold that the BIA’s approach is based on a permissible\nconstruction of the statute.\n2             HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  The immigration laws have long given the Attorney\nGeneral discretion to permit certain otherwise-removable\naliens to remain in the United States. See Judulang v.\nHolder, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 2–4). The\nAttorney General formerly exercised this authority by\nvirtue of §212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act\n(INA), 66 Stat. 187, 8 U. S. C. §1182(c) (1994 ed.), a provi-\nsion with some lingering relevance here, see infra, at 7–9.\nBut in 1996, Congress replaced §212(c) with §1229b(a)\n(2006 ed.). That new section, applicable to the cases be-\nfore us, provides as follows:\n    “(a) Cancellation of removal for certain perma-\n    nent residents\n    “The Attorney General may cancel removal in the case\n    of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the\n    United States if the alien—\n       “(1) has been an alien lawfully admitted for perma-\n       nent residence for not less than 5 years,\n       “(2) has resided in the United States continuously\n       for 7 years after having been admitted in any sta-\n       tus, and\n       “(3) has not been convicted of any aggravated fel-\n       ony.” Ibid.\nSection 1229b(a) thus specifies the criteria that make an\nalien eligible to obtain relief from the Attorney General.\nThe first paragraph requires that the alien have held the\nstatus of a lawful permanent resident (LPR) for at least\nfive years. And the second adds that the alien must have\nlived in the United States for at least seven continuous\nyears after a lawful admission, whether as an LPR or in\n                      Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nsome other immigration status.1 (The third paragraph is\nnot at issue in these cases.)\n   The question we consider here is whether, in applying\nthis statutory provision, the BIA should impute a parent’s\nyears of continuous residence or LPR status to his or her\nchild. That question arises because a child may enter the\ncountry lawfully, or may gain LPR status, after one of\nhis parents does. A parent may therefore satisfy the re-\nquirements of §§1229b(a)(1) and (2), while his or her\nchild, considered independently, does not. In these circum-\nstances, is the child eligible for cancellation of removal?\n   The Ninth Circuit, the first court of appeals to confront\nthis issue, held that such an alien could obtain relief. See\nCuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, 430 F. 3d 1013 (2005). En-\nrique Cuevas-Gaspar and his parents came to the United\nStates illegally in 1985, when he was one year old. Cuevas-\nGaspar’s mother was lawfully admitted to the country\nin 1990, as an LPR. But Cuevas-Gaspar was lawfully\nadmitted only in 1997, when he too received LPR status.\nThat meant that when Cuevas-Gaspar committed a re-\nmovable offense in 2002, he could not independently sat-\nisfy §1229b(a)(2)’s requirement of seven consecutive years of\nresidence after a lawful entry.2 (The parties agreed that\nhe just met §1229b(a)(1)’s 5-year status requirement.) The\nBoard deemed Cuevas-Gaspar ineligible for relief on that\naccount, but the Ninth Circuit found that position unrea-\n——————\n  1 The  INA defines “admitted” as referring to “the lawful entry of\nthe alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by\nan immigration officer.” 8 U. S. C. §1101 (a)(13)(A). The 7-year clock of\n§1229b(a)(2) thus begins with an alien’s lawful entry.\n  2 The 7-year clock stopped running on the date of Cuevas-Gaspar’s\n\noffense under a statutory provision known as the “stop-time” rule. See\n§1229b(d)(1) (“For purposes of this section, any period of continuous\nresidence . . . in the United States shall be deemed to end . . . when the\nalien is served a notice to appear . . . or . . . when the alien has commit-\nted an offense . . . that renders the alien . . . removable from the United\nStates . . . , whichever is earliest”).\n4            HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsonable. According to the Court of Appeals, the Board\nshould have “imputed” to Cuevas-Gaspar his mother’s\nyears of continuous residence during the time he lived\nwith her as an “unemancipated minor.” Id., at 1029. That\napproach, the Ninth Circuit reasoned, followed from both\nthe INA’s “priorit[ization]” of familial relations and the\nBoard’s “consistent willingness” to make imputations from\na parent to a child in many areas of immigration law. Id.,\nat 1026.\n   The Board responded by reiterating its opposition to\nimputation under both relevant paragraphs of §1229b(a).\nIn In re Escobar, 24 I. & N. Dec. 231 (2007), the Board\nconsidered whether a child could rely on a parent’s period\nof LPR status to satisfy §1229b(a)(1)’s 5-year clock. The\nBoard expressly “disagree[d] with the reasoning” of Cuevas-\nGaspar, rejecting the Ninth Circuit’s understanding of\nboth the statute and the Board’s prior policies. 24 I. & N.\nDec., at 233–234, and n. 4. Accordingly, the Board an-\nnounced that it would “decline to extend” Cuevas-Gaspar\nto any case involving §1229b(a)(1), and that it would\nignore the decision even as to §1229b(a)(2) outside the\nNinth Circuit. 24 I. & N. Dec., at 235. A year later, in\nMatter of Ramirez-Vargas, 24 I. & N. Dec. 599 (2008), the\nBIA took the final step: It rejected imputation under\n§1229b(a)(2) in a case arising in the Ninth Circuit, main-\ntaining that the court should abandon Cuevas-Gaspar and\ndefer to the Board’s intervening reasoned decision in\nEscobar. See Ramirez-Vargas, 24 I. & N. Dec., at 600–601\n(citing National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v.\nBrand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967 (2005)).\n   The BIA’s position on imputation touched off a split in\nthe courts of appeals. The Third and Fifth Circuits both\ndeferred to the BIA’s approach as a reasonable construc-\ntion of §1229b(a). See Augustin v. Attorney Gen., 520 F. 3d\n264 (CA3 2008); Deus v. Holder, 591 F. 3d 807 (CA5 2009).\nBut in Mercado-Zazueta v. Holder, 580 F. 3d 1102 (2009),\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Ninth Circuit doubled down on its contrary view,\ndeclaring the BIA’s position unreasonable and requiring\nimputation under both §§1229b(a)(1) and (a)(2). See id.,\nat 1103 (“[T]he rationale and holding of Cuevas-Gaspar\napply equally to the five-year permanent residence and\nthe seven-year continuance residence requirements” of\n§1229b(a)).\n                             B\n  Two cases are before us. In 1989, at the age of five,\nrespondent Carlos Martinez Gutierrez illegally entered\nthe United States with his family. Martinez Gutierrez’s\nfather was lawfully admitted to the country two years\nlater as an LPR. But Martinez Gutierrez himself was\nneither lawfully admitted nor given LPR status until\n2003. Two years after that, Martinez Gutierrez was ap-\nprehended for smuggling undocumented aliens across the\nborder. He admitted the offense, and sought cancellation\nof removal. The Immigration Judge concluded that Mar-\ntinez Gutierrez qualified for relief because of his father’s\nimmigration history, even though Martinez Gutierrez\ncould not satisfy either §1229b(a)(1) or §1229b(a)(2) on his\nown. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10–1542, pp. 20a–\n22a (citing Cuevas-Gaspar, 430 F. 3d 1013). The BIA\nreversed, and after entry of a removal order on remand,\nreaffirmed its disposition in an order relying on Escobar,\nsee App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10–1542, at 5a–6a. The\nNinth Circuit then granted Martinez Gutierrez’s petition\nfor review and remanded the case to the Board for recon-\nsideration in light of the court’s contrary decisions. See\n411 Fed. Appx. 121 (2011).\n  Respondent Damien Sawyers was lawfully admitted as\nan LPR in October 1995, when he was 15 years old. At\nthat time, his mother had already resided in the country\nfor six consecutive years following a lawful entry. After\nSawyers’s conviction of a drug offense in August 2002, the\n6            HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nGovernment initiated removal proceedings. The Immigra-\ntion Judge found Sawyers ineligible for cancellation of\nremoval because he was a few months shy of the seven\nyears of continuous residence required under §1229b(a)(2).\nSee App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10–1543, p. 13a. (No one\ndoubted that Sawyers had by that time held LPR status\nfor five years, as required under §1229b(a)(1).) The Board\naffirmed, relying on its reasoning in Escobar. See In\nre Sawyers, No. A44 852 478, </pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/scb/bnZk/in-re-sawyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4711443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Dec.\n26, 2007). Sawyers petitioned the Ninth Circuit for\nreview, arguing that the Board should have counted his\nmother’s years of residency while he was a minor toward\n§1229b(a)(2)’s 7-year requirement. As in Gutierrez, the\nCourt of Appeals granted the petition and remanded the\ncase to the BIA. See 399 Fed. Appx. 313 (2010).\n   We granted the Government’s petitions for certiorari,\n564 U. S. ___ (2011), consolidated the cases, and now\nreverse the Ninth Circuit’s judgments.\n                              II\n  The Board has required each alien seeking cancellation\nof removal to satisfy §1229b(a)’s requirements on his own,\nwithout counting a parent’s years of continuous residence\nor LPR status. That position prevails if it is a reasonable\nconstruction of the statute, whether or not it is the only\npossible interpretation or even the one a court might think\nbest. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843–844, and n. 11\n(1984); see also INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U. S. 415,\n424–425 (1999) (according Chevron deference to the\nBoard’s interpretations of the INA). We think the BIA’s\nview on imputation meets that standard, and so need not\ndecide if the statute permits any other construction.\n  The Board’s approach is consistent with the statute’s\ntext, as even respondents tacitly concede.          Section\n1229b(a) does not mention imputation, much less require\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nit. The provision calls for “the alien”—not, say, “the alien\nor one of his parents”—to meet the three prerequisites for\ncancellation of removal. Similarly, several of §1229b(a)’s\nother terms have statutory definitions referring to only a\nsingle individual. See, e.g., §1101(a)(13)(A) (“The terms\n‘admission’ and ‘admitted’ mean, with respect to an alien,\nthe lawful entry of the alien into the United States” (em-\nphasis added)); §1101(a)(33) (“The term ‘residence’ means\nthe place of general abode; the place of general abode of\na person means his principal, actual dwelling” (emphasis\nadded)). Respondents contend that none of this language\n“forecloses” imputation: They argue that if the Board\nallowed imputation, “[t]he alien” seeking cancellation\nwould “still have to satisfy the provision’s durational\nrequirements”—just pursuant to a different computational\nrule. Brief for Respondent Martinez Gutierrez in No. 10–\n1542, p. 16 (hereinafter Martinez Gutierrez Brief); see\nBrief for Respondent Sawyers in No. 10–1543, pp. 11, 15\n(hereinafter Sawyers Brief). And they claim that the\nBoard’s history of permitting imputation under similarly\n“silent” statutes supports this construction.

But even if so—even if the Board could adopt an\nimputation rule consistent with the statute’s text—that\nwould not avail respondents. Taken alone, the language of\n§1229b(a) at least permits the Board to go the other way—\nto say that “the alien” must meet the statutory conditions\nindependently, without relying on a parent’s history.\n   For this reason, respondents focus on §1229b(a)’s history\nand context—particularly, the provision’s relationship to\nthe INA’s former §212(c) and its associated imputation\nrule. Section 212(c)—§1229b(a)’s predecessor—generally\nallowed the Attorney General to prevent the removal of an\nalien with LPR status who had maintained a “lawful\nunrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years” in this\ncountry. 8 U. S. C. §1182(c) (1994 ed.). Like §1229b(a),\n8            HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n§212(c) was silent on imputation. Yet the Second, Third,\nand Ninth Circuits (the only appellate courts to consider\nthe question) concluded that, in determining eligibility for\nrelief under §212(c), the Board should impute a parent’s\nyears of domicile to his or her child. See Rosario v. INS,\n962 F. 2d 220 (CA2 1992); Lepe-Guitron v. INS, 16 F. 3d\n1021, 1024–1026 (CA9 1994); Morel v. INS, 90 F. 3d 833,\n840–842 (CA3 1996). Those courts reasoned that at com-\nmon law, a minor’s domicile was “the same as that of its\nparents, since most children are presumed not legally\ncapable of forming the requisite intent to establish their\nown domicile.” Rosario, 962 F. 2d, at 224; see Mississippi\nBand of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 490 U. S. 30, 48\n(1989) (defining “domicile” as “physical presence in a place\nin connection with a certain state of mind concerning one’s\nintent to remain there”). So by the time Congress replaced\n§212(c) with §1229b(a), the BIA often imputed a parent’s\nyears of domicile to a child in determining eligibility for\ncancellation of removal. Sawyers argues that against this\nbackdrop, Congress “would have understood the language\nit chose [in §1229b(a)] to provide for imputation.” Sawyers\nBrief 10.\n   But we cannot conclude that Congress ratified an impu-\ntation requirement when it passed §1229b(a). As all parties\nagree, Congress enacted §§1229b(a)(1) and (a)(2) to resolve\nan unrelated question about §212(c)’s meaning. See id.,\nat 17; Martinez Gutierrez Brief 28; Brief for Petitioner\n25. Courts had differed on whether an alien’s “seven\nconsecutive years” of domicile under §212(c) all had to\npost-date the alien’s obtaining LPR status. See Cuevas-\nGaspar, 430 F. 3d, at 1027–1028 (canvassing split). Con-\ngress addressed that split by creating two distinct dura-\ntional conditions: the 5-year status requirement of subsec-\ntion (a)(1), which runs from the time an alien becomes an\nLPR, and the 7-year continuous-residency requirement of\nsubsection (a)(2), which can include years preceding the\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nacquisition of LPR status. In doing so, Congress elimi-\nnated the very term—“domicile”—on which the appeals courts\nhad founded their imputation decisions. See supra, at 8.\nThat alteration dooms respondents’ position, because the\ndoctrine of congressional ratification applies only when\nCongress reenacts a statute without relevant change. See\nJama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 543 U. S.\n335, 349 (2005).3 So the statutory history here provides no\nbasis for holding that the BIA flouted a congressional\ncommand in adopting its no-imputation policy.\n   Nor do the INA’s purposes demand imputation here, as\nboth respondents claim. According to Martinez Gutierrez,\nthe BIA’s approach contradicts that statute’s objectives of\n“providing relief to aliens with strong ties to the United\nStates” and “promoting family unity.” Martinez Gutierrez\nBrief 40, 44; see Sawyers Brief 37. We agree—indeed, we\nhave stated—that the goals respondents identify underlie\nor inform many provisions of immigration law. See Fiallo\nv. Bell, 430 U. S. 787, 795, n. 6 (1977); INS v. Errico, 385\nU. S. 214, 220 (1966). But they are not the INA’s only\ngoals, and Congress did not pursue them to the nth de-\ngree. To take one example, §1229b(a)’s third paragraph\nmakes aliens convicted of aggravated felonies ineligible for\n——————\n  3 Sawyers contends that §1229b(a)(2)’s replacement term—“resided\n\ncontinuously”—is a “term of art” in the immigration context which\nincorporates “an intent component” and so means the same thing as\n“domiciled.” Sawyers Brief 25–26 (emphasis deleted). Thus, Sawyers\nargues, we should read §1229b(a) as reenacting §212(c) without mean-\ningful change. See id., at 25. But even assuming that Congress could\nratify judicial decisions based on the term “domicile” through a new\nstatute using a synonym for that term, we do not think “resided contin-\nuously” qualifies. The INA defines “residence” as a person’s “princi-\npal, actual dwelling place in fact, without regard to intent,” 8 U. S. C.\n§1101(a)(33) (emphasis added), and we find nothing to suggest that\nCongress added an intent element, inconsistent with that definition, by\nrequiring that the residence have been maintained “continuously for 7\nyears.”\n10            HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncancellation of removal, regardless of the strength of their\nfamily ties. See §1229b(a)(3). And more generally—as\nthese very cases show—not every alien who obtains LPR\nstatus can immediately get the same for her spouse or\nminor children. See Brief for Petitioner 31–32, and n. 9\n(providing program-specific examples). We cannot read a\nsilent statute as requiring (not merely allowing) imputa-\ntion just because that rule would be family-friendly.\n   Respondents’ stronger arguments take a different\ntack—that we should refuse to defer to the Board’s deci-\nsion even assuming Congress placed the question of impu-\ntation in its hands. Respondents offer two main reasons.\nFirst, they contend that the Board’s approach to §1229b(a)\ncannot be squared with its acceptance of imputation under\nother, similar statutory provisions. This “wil[d]” and “ ‘[u]n-\nexplained inconsistency,’ ” Sawyers asserts, is the very\n“paradigm of arbitrary agency action.” Sawyers Brief\n13, 41 (emphasis deleted); see Martinez Gutierrez Brief\n52–54. Second, they argue that the Board did not appreci-\nate its own discretion over whether to allow imputation.\nThe Board, they say, thought Congress had forbidden\nimputation, and so did not bring its “ ‘experience and\nexpertise to bear’ ” on the issue. Id., at 31 (quoting PDK\nLabs. Inc. v. DEA, 362 F. 3d 786, 797 (CADC 2004)); see\nSawyers Brief 38–39. These arguments are not insubstan-\ntial, but in the end neither persuades us to deny the Board\nthe usual deference we accord to agency interpretations.\n   Start with the claim of inconsistency. The BIA has\nindeed imputed parental attributes to children under\nother INA provisions that do not mention the matter.\nSection 1182(k), for example, enables the Attorney Gen-\neral to let certain inadmissible aliens into the country if he\nfinds “that inadmissibility was not known to, and could\nnot have been ascertained by the exercise of reasonable\ndiligence by, the immigrant before the time of departure.”\nLike §1229b(a), that provision refers to a single person\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(“the immigrant”) and says nothing about imputation. But\nthe BIA has consistently imputed a parent’s knowledge\nof inadmissibility (or lack thereof ) to a child. See, e.g.,\nSenica v. INS, 16 F. 3d 1013, 1015 (CA9 1994) (“Therefore,\nthe BIA reasoned, the children were not entitled to relief\nunder [§1182(k)] because [their mother’s] knowledge was\nimputed to them”); In re Mushtaq, No. A43 968 082, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4707539</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (BIA, Dec. 10, 2007) (per curiam); In re Ah-\nmed, No. A41 982 631, </pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/gactapp/6Wij/in-re-ah/\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">448156</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (BIA, Jan. 17,\n2006) (per curiam).\n   Similarly, the Board imputes a parent’s abandonment\n(or non-abandonment) of LPR status to her child when\ndetermining whether that child can reenter the country as\na “returning resident immigran[t]” under §1181(b). See\nMatter of Zamora, 17 I. & N. Dec. 395, 396 (1980) (hold-\ning that a “voluntary and intended abandonment by the\nmother is imputed” to an unemancipated minor child for\npurposes of applying §1181(b)); Matter of Huang, 19 I.\n& N. Dec. 749, 755–756 (1988) (concluding that a mother\nand her children abandoned their LPR status based\nsolely on the mother’s intent); In re Ali, No. A44 143 723,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/calctapp/cPma/in-re-ali-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3088820</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (BIA, Sept. 11, 2006) (holding that a\nchild could not have abandoned his LPR status if his\nmother had not abandoned hers). And once again, that is\nso even though neither §1181(b) nor any other statutory\nprovision says that the BIA should look to the parent in\nassessing the child’s eligibility for reentry.\n   But Escobar provided a reasoned explanation for these\ndivergent results: The Board imputes matters involving an\nalien’s state of mind, while declining to impute objective\nconditions or characteristics. See 24 I. & N. Dec., at 233–\n234, and n. 4. On one side of the line, knowledge of inad-\nmissibility is all and only about a mental state. See, e.g.,\nSenica, 16 F. 3d, at 1015; In re Ahmed, </pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/gactapp/6Wij/in-re-ah/\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">448156</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\nLikewise, abandonment of status turns on an alien’s “in-\ntention of . . . returning to the United States” to live as a\n12               HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npermanent resident, Zamora, 17 I. & N. Dec., at 396; the\nBoard thus explained that imputing abandonment is\n“consistent with the . . . longstanding policy that a child\ncannot form the intent necessary to establish his or her\nown domicile,” Escobar, 24 I. & N. Dec., at 234, n. 4. And\nas that analogy recalls, the 7-year domicile requirement of\nthe former §212(c) also involved intent and so lent itself to\nimputation. See Rosario, 962 F. 2d, at 224; supra, at 8.\nBut the 5- and 7-year clocks of §1229b(a) fall on the other\nside of the line, because they hinge not on any state of\nmind but on the objective facts of immigration status and\nplace of residence. See Escobar, 24 I. & N. Dec., at 233\n(“[W]e find that residence is different from domicile be-\ncause it ‘contains no element of subjective intent’ ” (quot-\ning Cuevas-Gaspar, 430 F. 3d, at 1031 (Fernandez, J.,\ndissenting))). The BIA’s varied rulings on imputation thus\nlargely follow from one straightforward distinction.4\n   Similarly, Escobar belies respondents’ claim that the\nBIA adopted its no-imputation rule only because it\nthought Congress had left it no other choice. The Board,\nto be sure, did not highlight the statute’s gaps or ambiguity;\nrather, it read §1229b(a)’s text to support its conclusion\nthat each alien must personally meet that section’s dura-\n——————\n  4 Respondents aver that the BIA deviates from this principle in im-\n\nputing to a child his parent’s “ ‘firm resettlement’ ” in another country,\nwhich renders an alien ineligible for asylum without regard to intent.\nSee Sawyers Brief 39; Martinez Gutierrez Brief 52. But the Govern-\nment denies that it has a “settled imputation rule” in that context.\nReply Brief for Petitioner 13. And the sources on which respondents\nrely are slender reeds: a 40-year old ruling by a regional commissioner\n(not the Board itself) that considered the conduct of both the parents\nand the child, see Matter of Ng, 12 I. & N. Dec. 411 (1967), and a Ninth\nCircuit decision imputing a parent’s resettlement even though the\nBoard had focused only on the child’s actions, see Vang v. INS, 146\nF. 3d 1114, 1117 (1998). Based on these scant decisions, we cannot\nconclude that the Board has any policy on imputing resettlement, let\nalone one inconsistent with Escobar.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                 13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntional requirements. See 24 I. & N. Dec., at 235. But the\nBoard also explained that “there [was] no precedent” in its\ndecisions for imputing status or residence, and distin-\nguished those statutory terms, on the ground just ex-\nplained, from domicile or abandonment of LPR status. Id.,\nat 234; see id., at 233–234, and n. 4. And the Board ar-\ngued that allowing imputation under §1229b(a) would\ncreate anomalies in administration of the statutory\nscheme by permitting even those who had not obtained\nLPR status—or could not do so because of a criminal\nhistory—to become eligible for cancellation of removal.\nSee id., at 234–235, and n. 5. The Board therefore saw\nneither a “logical” nor a “legal” basis for adopting a policy\nof imputation. Id., at 233. We see nothing in this decision\nto suggest that the Board thought its hands tied, or that it\nmight have reached a different result if assured it could do\nso. To the contrary, the decision expressed the BIA’s view,\nbased on its experience implementing the INA, that statu-\ntory text, administrative practice, and regulatory policy all\npointed in one direction: toward disallowing imputation.\nIn making that case, the decision reads like a multitude\nof agency interpretations—not the best example, but far\nfrom the worst—to which we and other courts have rou-\ntinely deferred. We see no reason not to do so here.\n   Because the Board’s rejection of imputation under\n§1229b(a) is “based on a permissible construction of the\nstatute,” Chevron, 467 U.

Argued January 18, 2012—Decided May 21, 2012*\nTitle 8 U. S. C. §1229b(a) authorizes the Attorney General to cancel the\n  removal of an alien from the United States who, among other things,\n  has held the status of a lawful permanent resident (LPR) for at least\n  five years, §1229b(a)(1), and has lived in the United States for at\n  least seven continuous years after a lawful admission, §1229b(a)(2).\n  These cases concern whether the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA\n  or Board) should impute a parent’s years of continuous residence or\n  LPR status to his or her child. That issue arises because a child may\n  enter the country lawfully, or may gain LPR status, after one of his\n  parents does—meaning that a parent may satisfy §1229b(a)(1) or\n  §1229b(a)(2), while his child, considered independently, does not. In\n  In re Escobar, 24 I. & N. Dec. 231, the BIA concluded that an alien\n  must meet §1229b(a)’s requirements on his own. But the Ninth Cir-\n  cuit found the Board’s position unreasonable, holding that\n  §1229b(a)(1) and §1229b(a)(2) require imputation. See Mercado-\n  Zazueta v. Holder, 580 F. 3d 1102; Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, 430\n  F. 3d 1013.\n     Respondent Martinez Gutierrez illegally entered the country with\n  his family in 1989, when he was 5 years old. Martinez Gutierrez’s fa-\n  ther was lawfully admitted to the country two years later as an LPR.\n  But Martinez Gutierrez was neither lawfully admitted nor given LPR\n  status until 2003. Two years after that, he was apprehended for\n  smuggling undocumented aliens across the border. Admitting the of-\n  fense, he sought cancellation of removal. The Immigration Judge\n——————\n  * Together with No. 10–1543, Holder, Attorney General v. Sawyers,\nalso on certiorari to the same court.\n2                 HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    concluded that Martinez Gutierrez qualified for relief because of his\n    father’s immigration history, even though Martinez Gutierrez could\n    not satisfy §1229b(a)(1) or §1229b(a)(2) on his own. Relying on Esco-\n    bar, the BIA reversed. The Ninth Circuit then granted Martinez\n    Gutierrez’s petition for review and remanded the case to the Board\n    for reconsideration in light of its contrary decisions.\n       Respondent Sawyers was lawfully admitted as an LPR in October\n    1995, when he was 15 years old. At that time, his mother had al-\n    ready resided in the country for six consecutive years following a law-\n    ful entry. After Sawyers was convicted of a drug offense in August\n    2002, the Government began removal proceedings. The Immigration\n    Judge found Sawyers ineligible for cancellation of removal because he\n    could not satisfy §1229b(a)(2). The BIA affirmed, and Sawyers peti-\n    tioned the Ninth Circuit for review. There, he argued that the Board\n    should have counted his mother’s years of residency while he was a\n    minor toward §1229b(a)(2)’s 7-year continuous-residency require-\n    ment. The Court of Appeals granted the petition and remanded the\n    case to the BIA.\nHeld: The BIA’s rejection of imputation is based on a permissible con-\n struction of §1229b(a). Pp. 6–13.\n    (a) The Board has required each alien seeking cancellation of re-\n moval to satisfy §1229b(a)’s requirements on his own, without relying\n on a parent’s years of continuous residence or immigration status.\n That position prevails if it is a reasonable construction of the statute,\n whether or not it is the only possible interpretation or even the one a\n court might think best. See e.g., Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Re-\n sources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843–844, and n. 11. The\n BIA’s approach satisfies this standard.\n    The Board’s position is consistent with the statute’s text. Section\n 1229b(a) does not mention—much less require—imputation. Instead,\n it simply calls for “the alien” to meet the prerequisites for cancella-\n tion of removal. See §§1101(a)(13)(A) and (a)(33). Respondents con-\n tend that this language does not foreclose imputation, but even if so,\n that is not enough to require the Board to adopt that policy. Pp. 6–7.\n    (b) Neither does the statute’s history and context mandate imputa-\n tion. Section 1229b(a) replaced former §212(c) of the Immigration\n and Nationality Act (INA), which allowed the Attorney General to\n prevent the removal of an alien with LPR status who had maintained\n a “lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years” in this\n country. Like §1229b(a), §212(c) was silent on imputation. But every\n Court of Appeals that confronted the question concluded that, in de-\n termining eligibility for §212(c) relief, the Board should impute a\n parent’s years of domicile to his or her child. Based on this history,\n Sawyers contends that Congress would have understood §1229b(a)’s\n                    Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                    3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n language to provide for imputation. But in enacting §1229b(a), Con-\n gress eliminated the very term—“domicile”—on which the appeals\n courts had founded their imputation decisions. And the doctrine of\n congressional ratification applies only when Congress reenacts a\n statute without relevant change. See Jama v. Immigration and Cus-\n toms Enforcement, 543 U. S. 335, 349.\n   Nor do the INA’s purposes demand imputation. As respondents\n correctly observe, many provisions of immigration law advance the\n goals of promoting family unity and providing relief to aliens with\n strong ties to this country. But these are not the INA’s only goals,\n and Congress did not pursue them at all costs. For example, aliens\n convicted of aggravated felonies are ineligible for cancellation of\n removal, regardless of the strength of their family ties, see\n §1229b(a)(3). In addition, as these cases show, not every alien with\n LPR status can immediately get the same for a spouse or minor child.\n A silent statute cannot be read as requiring imputation just because\n that rule would be family-friendly. Pp. 7–10.\n   (c) Respondents advance two additional arguments for why the\n Board’s position is not entitled to Chevron deference. First, they\n claim that the Board’s approach to §1229b(a) is arbitrary because it is\n inconsistent with the Board’s acceptance of imputation under other,\n similar provisions that are silent on the matter. See §1182(k) and\n §1181(b). But the Board’s decision in Escobar provided a reasoned\n explanation for these divergent results: The Board imputes matters\n involving an alien’s state of mind, while declining to impute objective\n conditions or characteristics. See 24 I. & N. Dec., at 233–234, and\n n. 4. Section 1229b(a) hinges on the objective facts of immigration\n status and place of residence. See id., at 233. So the Board’s\n approach to §1229b(a) largely follows from one straightforward\n distinction.\n   Second, respondents claim that the BIA adopted its no-imputation\n rule only because it thought Congress had left it no other choice. But\n Escobar belies this contention.       The Board did explain how\n §1229b(a)’s text supports its no-imputation policy. But the Board al-\n so brought its experience and expertise to bear on the matter: It not-\n ed that there was no precedent in its decisions for imputing status or\n residence, and it argued that allowing imputation under §1229b(a)\n would create anomalies in the statutory scheme. Escobar thus ex-\n pressed the BIA’s view that statutory text, administrative practice,\n and regulatory policy all pointed toward disallowing imputation. In\n making that case, the opinion reads like a multitude of agency inter-\n pretations to which this and other courts have routinely deferred.\n Pp. 10–13.\nNo. 10–1542, 411 Fed.

S. C. §1229b(a), authorizes\nthe Attorney General to cancel the removal of an alien\nfrom the United States so long as the alien satisfies cer-\ntain criteria. One of those criteria relates to the length of\ntime an alien has lawfully resided in the United States,\nand another to the length of time he has held permanent\nresident status here. We consider whether the Board of\nImmigration Appeals (BIA or Board) could reasonably\nconclude that an alien living in this country as a child\nmust meet those requirements on his own, without count-\ning a parent’s years of residence or immigration status.\nWe hold that the BIA’s approach is based on a permissible\nconstruction of the statute.\n2             HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  The immigration laws have long given the Attorney\nGeneral discretion to permit certain otherwise-removable\naliens to remain in the United States. See Judulang v.\nHolder, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 2–4). The\nAttorney General formerly exercised this authority by\nvirtue of §212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act\n(INA), 66 Stat. 187, 8 U. S. C. §1182(c) (1994 ed.), a provi-\nsion with some lingering relevance here, see infra, at 7–9.\nBut in 1996, Congress replaced §212(c) with §1229b(a)\n(2006 ed.). That new section, applicable to the cases be-\nfore us, provides as follows:\n    “(a) Cancellation of removal for certain perma-\n    nent residents\n    “The Attorney General may cancel removal in the case\n    of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the\n    United States if the alien—\n       “(1) has been an alien lawfully admitted for perma-\n       nent residence for not less than 5 years,\n       “(2) has resided in the United States continuously\n       for 7 years after having been admitted in any sta-\n       tus, and\n       “(3) has not been convicted of any aggravated fel-\n       ony.” Ibid.\nSection 1229b(a) thus specifies the criteria that make an\nalien eligible to obtain relief from the Attorney General.\nThe first paragraph requires that the alien have held the\nstatus of a lawful permanent resident (LPR) for at least\nfive years. And the second adds that the alien must have\nlived in the United States for at least seven continuous\nyears after a lawful admission, whether as an LPR or in\n                      Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nsome other immigration status.1 (The third paragraph is\nnot at issue in these cases.)\n   The question we consider here is whether, in applying\nthis statutory provision, the BIA should impute a parent’s\nyears of continuous residence or LPR status to his or her\nchild. That question arises because a child may enter the\ncountry lawfully, or may gain LPR status, after one of\nhis parents does. A parent may therefore satisfy the re-\nquirements of §§1229b(a)(1) and (2), while his or her\nchild, considered independently, does not. In these circum-\nstances, is the child eligible for cancellation of removal?\n   The Ninth Circuit, the first court of appeals to confront\nthis issue, held that such an alien could obtain relief. See\nCuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, 430 F. 3d 1013 (2005). En-\nrique Cuevas-Gaspar and his parents came to the United\nStates illegally in 1985, when he was one year old. Cuevas-\nGaspar’s mother was lawfully admitted to the country\nin 1990, as an LPR. But Cuevas-Gaspar was lawfully\nadmitted only in 1997, when he too received LPR status.\nThat meant that when Cuevas-Gaspar committed a re-\nmovable offense in 2002, he could not independently sat-\nisfy §1229b(a)(2)’s requirement of seven consecutive years of\nresidence after a lawful entry.2 (The parties agreed that\nhe just met §1229b(a)(1)’s 5-year status requirement.) The\nBoard deemed Cuevas-Gaspar ineligible for relief on that\naccount, but the Ninth Circuit found that position unrea-\n——————\n  1 The  INA defines “admitted” as referring to “the lawful entry of\nthe alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by\nan immigration officer.” 8 U. S. C. §1101 (a)(13)(A). The 7-year clock of\n§1229b(a)(2) thus begins with an alien’s lawful entry.\n  2 The 7-year clock stopped running on the date of Cuevas-Gaspar’s\n\noffense under a statutory provision known as the “stop-time” rule. See\n§1229b(d)(1) (“For purposes of this section, any period of continuous\nresidence . . . in the United States shall be deemed to end . . . when the\nalien is served a notice to appear . . . or . . . when the alien has commit-\nted an offense . . . that renders the alien . . . removable from the United\nStates . . . , whichever is earliest”).\n4            HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsonable. According to the Court of Appeals, the Board\nshould have “imputed” to Cuevas-Gaspar his mother’s\nyears of continuous residence during the time he lived\nwith her as an “unemancipated minor.” Id., at 1029. That\napproach, the Ninth Circuit reasoned, followed from both\nthe INA’s “priorit[ization]” of familial relations and the\nBoard’s “consistent willingness” to make imputations from\na parent to a child in many areas of immigration law. Id.,\nat 1026.\n   The Board responded by reiterating its opposition to\nimputation under both relevant paragraphs of §1229b(a).\nIn In re Escobar, 24 I. & N. Dec. 231 (2007), the Board\nconsidered whether a child could rely on a parent’s period\nof LPR status to satisfy §1229b(a)(1)’s 5-year clock. The\nBoard expressly “disagree[d] with the reasoning” of Cuevas-\nGaspar, rejecting the Ninth Circuit’s understanding of\nboth the statute and the Board’s prior policies. 24 I. & N.\nDec., at 233–234, and n. 4. Accordingly, the Board an-\nnounced that it would “decline to extend” Cuevas-Gaspar\nto any case involving §1229b(a)(1), and that it would\nignore the decision even as to §1229b(a)(2) outside the\nNinth Circuit. 24 I. & N. Dec., at 235. A year later, in\nMatter of Ramirez-Vargas, 24 I. & N. Dec. 599 (2008), the\nBIA took the final step: It rejected imputation under\n§1229b(a)(2) in a case arising in the Ninth Circuit, main-\ntaining that the court should abandon Cuevas-Gaspar and\ndefer to the Board’s intervening reasoned decision in\nEscobar. See Ramirez-Vargas, 24 I. & N. Dec., at 600–601\n(citing National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v.\nBrand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967 (2005)).\n   The BIA’s position on imputation touched off a split in\nthe courts of appeals. The Third and Fifth Circuits both\ndeferred to the BIA’s approach as a reasonable construc-\ntion of §1229b(a). See Augustin v. Attorney Gen., 520 F. 3d\n264 (CA3 2008); Deus v. Holder, 591 F. 3d 807 (CA5 2009).\nBut in Mercado-Zazueta v. Holder, 580 F. 3d 1102 (2009),\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Ninth Circuit doubled down on its contrary view,\ndeclaring the BIA’s position unreasonable and requiring\nimputation under both §§1229b(a)(1) and (a)(2). See id.,\nat 1103 (“[T]he rationale and holding of Cuevas-Gaspar\napply equally to the five-year permanent residence and\nthe seven-year continuance residence requirements” of\n§1229b(a)).\n                             B\n  Two cases are before us. In 1989, at the age of five,\nrespondent Carlos Martinez Gutierrez illegally entered\nthe United States with his family. Martinez Gutierrez’s\nfather was lawfully admitted to the country two years\nlater as an LPR. But Martinez Gutierrez himself was\nneither lawfully admitted nor given LPR status until\n2003. Two years after that, Martinez Gutierrez was ap-\nprehended for smuggling undocumented aliens across the\nborder. He admitted the offense, and sought cancellation\nof removal. The Immigration Judge concluded that Mar-\ntinez Gutierrez qualified for relief because of his father’s\nimmigration history, even though Martinez Gutierrez\ncould not satisfy either §1229b(a)(1) or §1229b(a)(2) on his\nown. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10–1542, pp. 20a–\n22a (citing Cuevas-Gaspar, 430 F. 3d 1013). The BIA\nreversed, and after entry of a removal order on remand,\nreaffirmed its disposition in an order relying on Escobar,\nsee App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10–1542, at 5a–6a. The\nNinth Circuit then granted Martinez Gutierrez’s petition\nfor review and remanded the case to the Board for recon-\nsideration in light of the court’s contrary decisions. See\n411 Fed. Appx. 121 (2011).\n  Respondent Damien Sawyers was lawfully admitted as\nan LPR in October 1995, when he was 15 years old. At\nthat time, his mother had already resided in the country\nfor six consecutive years following a lawful entry. After\nSawyers’s conviction of a drug offense in August 2002, the\n6            HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nGovernment initiated removal proceedings. The Immigra-\ntion Judge found Sawyers ineligible for cancellation of\nremoval because he was a few months shy of the seven\nyears of continuous residence required under §1229b(a)(2).\nSee App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 10–1543, p. 13a. (No one\ndoubted that Sawyers had by that time held LPR status\nfor five years, as required under §1229b(a)(1).) The Board\naffirmed, relying on its reasoning in Escobar. See In\nre Sawyers, No. A44 852 478, 2007 WL 4711443 (Dec.\n26, 2007). Sawyers petitioned the Ninth Circuit for\nreview, arguing that the Board should have counted his\nmother’s years of residency while he was a minor toward\n§1229b(a)(2)’s 7-year requirement. As in Gutierrez, the\nCourt of Appeals granted the petition and remanded the\ncase to the BIA. See 399 Fed. Appx. 313 (2010).\n   We granted the Government’s petitions for certiorari,\n564 U. S. ___ (2011), consolidated the cases, and now\nreverse the Ninth Circuit’s judgments.\n                              II\n  The Board has required each alien seeking cancellation\nof removal to satisfy §1229b(a)’s requirements on his own,\nwithout counting a parent’s years of continuous residence\nor LPR status. That position prevails if it is a reasonable\nconstruction of the statute, whether or not it is the only\npossible interpretation or even the one a court might think\nbest. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843–844, and n. 11\n(1984); see also INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U. S. 415,\n424–425 (1999) (according Chevron deference to the\nBoard’s interpretations of the INA). We think the BIA’s\nview on imputation meets that standard, and so need not\ndecide if the statute permits any other construction.\n  The Board’s approach is consistent with the statute’s\ntext, as even respondents tacitly concede.          Section\n1229b(a) does not mention imputation, much less require\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nit. The provision calls for “the alien”—not, say, “the alien\nor one of his parents”—to meet the three prerequisites for\ncancellation of removal. Similarly, several of §1229b(a)’s\nother terms have statutory definitions referring to only a\nsingle individual. See, e.g., §1101(a)(13)(A) (“The terms\n‘admission’ and ‘admitted’ mean, with respect to an alien,\nthe lawful entry of the alien into the United States” (em-\nphasis added)); §1101(a)(33) (“The term ‘residence’ means\nthe place of general abode; the place of general abode of\na person means his principal, actual dwelling” (emphasis\nadded)). Respondents contend that none of this language\n“forecloses” imputation: They argue that if the Board\nallowed imputation, “[t]he alien” seeking cancellation\nwould “still have to satisfy the provision’s durational\nrequirements”—just pursuant to a different computational\nrule. Brief for Respondent Martinez Gutierrez in No. 10–\n1542, p. 16 (hereinafter Martinez Gutierrez Brief); see\nBrief for Respondent Sawyers in No. 10–1543, pp. 11, 15\n(hereinafter Sawyers Brief). And they claim that the\nBoard’s history of permitting imputation under similarly\n“silent” statutes supports this construction. Martinez\nGutierrez Brief 16; see Sawyers Brief 15–16; infra, at 10–\n11. But even if so—even if the Board could adopt an\nimputation rule consistent with the statute’s text—that\nwould not avail respondents. Taken alone, the language of\n§1229b(a) at least permits the Board to go the other way—\nto say that “the alien” must meet the statutory conditions\nindependently, without relying on a parent’s history.\n   For this reason, respondents focus on §1229b(a)’s history\nand context—particularly, the provision’s relationship to\nthe INA’s former §212(c) and its associated imputation\nrule. Section 212(c)—§1229b(a)’s predecessor—generally\nallowed the Attorney General to prevent the removal of an\nalien with LPR status who had maintained a “lawful\nunrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years” in this\ncountry. 8 U. S. C. §1182(c) (1994 ed.). Like §1229b(a),\n8            HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n§212(c) was silent on imputation. Yet the Second, Third,\nand Ninth Circuits (the only appellate courts to consider\nthe question) concluded that, in determining eligibility for\nrelief under §212(c), the Board should impute a parent’s\nyears of domicile to his or her child. See Rosario v. INS,\n962 F. 2d 220 (CA2 1992); Lepe-Guitron v. INS, 16 F. 3d\n1021, 1024–1026 (CA9 1994); Morel v. INS, 90 F. 3d 833,\n840–842 (CA3 1996). Those courts reasoned that at com-\nmon law, a minor’s domicile was “the same as that of its\nparents, since most children are presumed not legally\ncapable of forming the requisite intent to establish their\nown domicile.” Rosario, 962 F. 2d, at 224; see Mississippi\nBand of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 490 U. S. 30, 48\n(1989) (defining “domicile” as “physical presence in a place\nin connection with a certain state of mind concerning one’s\nintent to remain there”). So by the time Congress replaced\n§212(c) with §1229b(a), the BIA often imputed a parent’s\nyears of domicile to a child in determining eligibility for\ncancellation of removal. Sawyers argues that against this\nbackdrop, Congress “would have understood the language\nit chose [in §1229b(a)] to provide for imputation.” Sawyers\nBrief 10.\n   But we cannot conclude that Congress ratified an impu-\ntation requirement when it passed §1229b(a). As all parties\nagree, Congress enacted §§1229b(a)(1) and (a)(2) to resolve\nan unrelated question about §212(c)’s meaning. See id.,\nat 17; Martinez Gutierrez Brief 28; Brief for Petitioner\n25. Courts had differed on whether an alien’s “seven\nconsecutive years” of domicile under §212(c) all had to\npost-date the alien’s obtaining LPR status. See Cuevas-\nGaspar, 430 F. 3d, at 1027–1028 (canvassing split). Con-\ngress addressed that split by creating two distinct dura-\ntional conditions: the 5-year status requirement of subsec-\ntion (a)(1), which runs from the time an alien becomes an\nLPR, and the 7-year continuous-residency requirement of\nsubsection (a)(2), which can include years preceding the\n                     Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nacquisition of LPR status. In doing so, Congress elimi-\nnated the very term—“domicile”—on which the appeals courts\nhad founded their imputation decisions. See supra, at 8.\nThat alteration dooms respondents’ position, because the\ndoctrine of congressional ratification applies only when\nCongress reenacts a statute without relevant change. See\nJama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 543 U. S.\n335, 349 (2005).3 So the statutory history here provides no\nbasis for holding that the BIA flouted a congressional\ncommand in adopting its no-imputation policy.\n   Nor do the INA’s purposes demand imputation here, as\nboth respondents claim. According to Martinez Gutierrez,\nthe BIA’s approach contradicts that statute’s objectives of\n“providing relief to aliens with strong ties to the United\nStates” and “promoting family unity.” Martinez Gutierrez\nBrief 40, 44; see Sawyers Brief 37. We agree—indeed, we\nhave stated—that the goals respondents identify underlie\nor inform many provisions of immigration law. See Fiallo\nv. Bell, 430 U. S. 787, 795, n. 6 (1977); INS v. Errico, 385\nU. S. 214, 220 (1966). But they are not the INA’s only\ngoals, and Congress did not pursue them to the nth de-\ngree. To take one example, §1229b(a)’s third paragraph\nmakes aliens convicted of aggravated felonies ineligible for\n——————\n  3 Sawyers contends that §1229b(a)(2)’s replacement term—“resided\n\ncontinuously”—is a “term of art” in the immigration context which\nincorporates “an intent component” and so means the same thing as\n“domiciled.” Sawyers Brief 25–26 (emphasis deleted). Thus, Sawyers\nargues, we should read §1229b(a) as reenacting §212(c) without mean-\ningful change. See id., at 25. But even assuming that Congress could\nratify judicial decisions based on the term “domicile” through a new\nstatute using a synonym for that term, we do not think “resided contin-\nuously” qualifies. The INA defines “residence” as a person’s “princi-\npal, actual dwelling place in fact, without regard to intent,” 8 U. S. C.\n§1101(a)(33) (emphasis added), and we find nothing to suggest that\nCongress added an intent element, inconsistent with that definition, by\nrequiring that the residence have been maintained “continuously for 7\nyears.”\n10            HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncancellation of removal, regardless of the strength of their\nfamily ties. See §1229b(a)(3). And more generally—as\nthese very cases show—not every alien who obtains LPR\nstatus can immediately get the same for her spouse or\nminor children. See Brief for Petitioner 31–32, and n. 9\n(providing program-specific examples). We cannot read a\nsilent statute as requiring (not merely allowing) imputa-\ntion just because that rule would be family-friendly.\n   Respondents’ stronger arguments take a different\ntack—that we should refuse to defer to the Board’s deci-\nsion even assuming Congress placed the question of impu-\ntation in its hands. Respondents offer two main reasons.\nFirst, they contend that the Board’s approach to §1229b(a)\ncannot be squared with its acceptance of imputation under\nother, similar statutory provisions. This “wil[d]” and “ ‘[u]n-\nexplained inconsistency,’ ” Sawyers asserts, is the very\n“paradigm of arbitrary agency action.” Sawyers Brief\n13, 41 (emphasis deleted); see Martinez Gutierrez Brief\n52–54. Second, they argue that the Board did not appreci-\nate its own discretion over whether to allow imputation.\nThe Board, they say, thought Congress had forbidden\nimputation, and so did not bring its “ ‘experience and\nexpertise to bear’ ” on the issue. Id., at 31 (quoting PDK\nLabs. Inc. v. DEA, 362 F. 3d 786, 797 (CADC 2004)); see\nSawyers Brief 38–39. These arguments are not insubstan-\ntial, but in the end neither persuades us to deny the Board\nthe usual deference we accord to agency interpretations.\n   Start with the claim of inconsistency. The BIA has\nindeed imputed parental attributes to children under\nother INA provisions that do not mention the matter.\nSection 1182(k), for example, enables the Attorney Gen-\neral to let certain inadmissible aliens into the country if he\nfinds “that inadmissibility was not known to, and could\nnot have been ascertained by the exercise of reasonable\ndiligence by, the immigrant before the time of departure.”\nLike §1229b(a), that provision refers to a single person\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(“the immigrant”) and says nothing about imputation. But\nthe BIA has consistently imputed a parent’s knowledge\nof inadmissibility (or lack thereof ) to a child. See, e.g.,\nSenica v. INS, 16 F. 3d 1013, 1015 (CA9 1994) (“Therefore,\nthe BIA reasoned, the children were not entitled to relief\nunder [§1182(k)] because [their mother’s] knowledge was\nimputed to them”); In re Mushtaq, No. A43 968 082, 2007\nWL 4707539 (BIA, Dec. 10, 2007) (per curiam); In re Ah-\nmed, No. A41 982 631, 2006 WL 448156 (BIA, Jan. 17,\n2006) (per curiam).\n   Similarly, the Board imputes a parent’s abandonment\n(or non-abandonment) of LPR status to her child when\ndetermining whether that child can reenter the country as\na “returning resident immigran[t]” under §1181(b). See\nMatter of Zamora, 17 I. & N. Dec. 395, 396 (1980) (hold-\ning that a “voluntary and intended abandonment by the\nmother is imputed” to an unemancipated minor child for\npurposes of applying §1181(b)); Matter of Huang, 19 I.\n& N. Dec. 749, 755–756 (1988) (concluding that a mother\nand her children abandoned their LPR status based\nsolely on the mother’s intent); In re Ali, No. A44 143 723,\n2006 WL 3088820 (BIA, Sept. 11, 2006) (holding that a\nchild could not have abandoned his LPR status if his\nmother had not abandoned hers). And once again, that is\nso even though neither §1181(b) nor any other statutory\nprovision says that the BIA should look to the parent in\nassessing the child’s eligibility for reentry.\n   But Escobar provided a reasoned explanation for these\ndivergent results: The Board imputes matters involving an\nalien’s state of mind, while declining to impute objective\nconditions or characteristics. See 24 I. & N. Dec., at 233–\n234, and n. 4. On one side of the line, knowledge of inad-\nmissibility is all and only about a mental state. See, e.g.,\nSenica, 16 F. 3d, at 1015; In re Ahmed, 2006 WL 448156.\nLikewise, abandonment of status turns on an alien’s “in-\ntention of . . . returning to the United States” to live as a\n12               HOLDER v. MARTINEZ GUTIERREZ\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npermanent resident, Zamora, 17 I. & N. Dec., at 396; the\nBoard thus explained that imputing abandonment is\n“consistent with the . . . longstanding policy that a child\ncannot form the intent necessary to establish his or her\nown domicile,” Escobar, 24 I. & N. Dec., at 234, n. 4. And\nas that analogy recalls, the 7-year domicile requirement of\nthe former §212(c) also involved intent and so lent itself to\nimputation. See Rosario, 962 F. 2d, at 224; supra, at 8.\nBut the 5- and 7-year clocks of §1229b(a) fall on the other\nside of the line, because they hinge not on any state of\nmind but on the objective facts of immigration status and\nplace of residence. See Escobar, 24 I. & N. Dec., at 233\n(“[W]e find that residence is different from domicile be-\ncause it ‘contains no element of subjective intent’ ” (quot-\ning Cuevas-Gaspar, 430 F. 3d, at 1031 (Fernandez, J.,\ndissenting))). The BIA’s varied rulings on imputation thus\nlargely follow from one straightforward distinction.4\n   Similarly, Escobar belies respondents’ claim that the\nBIA adopted its no-imputation rule only because it\nthought Congress had left it no other choice. The Board,\nto be sure, did not highlight the statute’s gaps or ambiguity;\nrather, it read §1229b(a)’s text to support its conclusion\nthat each alien must personally meet that section’s dura-\n——————\n  4 Respondents aver that the BIA deviates from this principle in im-\n\nputing to a child his parent’s “ ‘firm resettlement’ ” in another country,\nwhich renders an alien ineligible for asylum without regard to intent.\nSee Sawyers Brief 39; Martinez Gutierrez Brief 52. But the Govern-\nment denies that it has a “settled imputation rule” in that context.\nReply Brief for Petitioner 13. And the sources on which respondents\nrely are slender reeds: a 40-year old ruling by a regional commissioner\n(not the Board itself) that considered the conduct of both the parents\nand the child, see Matter of Ng, 12 I. & N. Dec. 411 (1967), and a Ninth\nCircuit decision imputing a parent’s resettlement even though the\nBoard had focused only on the child’s actions, see Vang v. INS, 146\nF. 3d 1114, 1117 (1998). Based on these scant decisions, we cannot\nconclude that the Board has any policy on imputing resettlement, let\nalone one inconsistent with Escobar.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                 13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntional requirements. See 24 I. & N. Dec., at 235. But the\nBoard also explained that “there [was] no precedent” in its\ndecisions for imputing status or residence, and distin-\nguished those statutory terms, on the ground just ex-\nplained, from domicile or abandonment of LPR status. Id.,\nat 234; see id., at 233–234, and n. 4. And the Board ar-\ngued that allowing imputation under §1229b(a) would\ncreate anomalies in administration of the statutory\nscheme by permitting even those who had not obtained\nLPR status—or could not do so because of a criminal\nhistory—to become eligible for cancellation of removal.\nSee id., at 234–235, and n. 5. The Board therefore saw\nneither a “logical” nor a “legal” basis for adopting a policy\nof imputation. Id., at 233. We see nothing in this decision\nto suggest that the Board thought its hands tied, or that it\nmight have reached a different result if assured it could do\nso. To the contrary, the decision expressed the BIA’s view,\nbased on its experience implementing the INA, that statu-\ntory text, administrative practice, and regulatory policy all\npointed in one direction: toward disallowing imputation.\nIn making that case, the decision reads like a multitude\nof agency interpretations—not the best example, but far\nfrom the worst—to which we and other courts have rou-\ntinely deferred. We see no reason not to do so here.\n   Because the Board’s rejection of imputation under\n§1229b(a) is “based on a permissible construction of the\nstatute,” Chevron, 467 U. S., at 843, we reverse the Ninth\nCircuit’s judgments and remand the cases for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/800568/", "sha1": "cbe516b89933cd4d10776ebe11ab1f4374687b5f", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2012-05-21T07:28:35"}
