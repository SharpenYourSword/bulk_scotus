Argued February 21, 2012—Decided May 21, 2012\nTitle 28 U. S. C. §1920, as amended by the Court Interpreters Act, in-\n  cludes “compensation of interpreters” among the costs that may be\n  awarded to prevailing parties in federal-court lawsuits. §1920(6). In\n  this case, the District Court awarded costs to respondent as the pre-\n  vailing party in a civil action instituted by petitioner. The award in-\n  cluded the cost of translating from Japanese to English certain doc-\n  uments that respondent used in preparing its defense. The Ninth\n  Circuit affirmed, concluding that §1920(6) covers the cost of translat-\n  ing documents as well as the cost of translating live speech.\nHeld: Because the ordinary meaning of “interpreter” is someone who\n translates orally from one language to another, the category “com-\n pensation of interpreters” in §1920(6) does not include the cost of\n document translation. Pp. 3−15.\n    (a) Section 1920 reflects the substance of an 1853 Act that specified\n for the first time what costs are allowable in federal court. That pro-\n vision defines the term “costs” as used in Federal Rule of Civil Proce-\n dure 54(d), which gives courts the discretion to award costs to pre-\n vailing parties. Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S.\n 437, 441. As originally configured, §1920 contained five categories of\n taxable costs, but in 1978, Congress enacted the Court Interpreters\n Act, which added a sixth category that includes “compensation of in-\n terpreters.” §1920(6). Pp. 3−5.\n    (b) Because the term “interpreter” is not defined in the Court In-\n terpreters Act or in any other relevant statutory provision, it must be\n given its ordinary meaning. Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S.\n 179, 187. When Congress passed that Act in 1978, many dictionaries\n defined “interpreter” as one who translates spoken, as opposed to\n2             TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    written, language. Pre-1978 legal dictionaries also generally defined\n    “interpreter” and “interpret” in terms of oral translation. Respondent\n    relies almost exclusively on a version of Webster’s Third New Inter-\n    national Dictionary that defined “interpreter” as “one that translates;\n    esp: a person who translates orally for parties conversing in different\n    tongues.” Although the sense divider esp (for especially) indicates\n    that the most common meaning of the term is one “who translates\n    orally,” that meaning is subsumed within the more general definition\n    “one that translates.” That a definition is broad enough to encompass\n    one sense of a word does not establish, however, that the word is or-\n    dinarily understood in that sense. See Mallard v. United States Dist.\n    Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa, 490 U. S. 296, 301. Although all\n    relevant dictionaries defined “interpreter” at the time of the statute’s\n    enactment as including persons who translate orally, only a handful\n    defined the word broadly enough to encompass translators of written\n    materials. Notably, the Oxford English Dictionary, one of the most\n    authoritative, recognized that “interpreter” can mean one who trans-\n    lates writings, but it expressly designated that meaning as obsolete.\n    Any definition of a word that is absent from many dictionaries and is\n    deemed obsolete in others is hardly a common or ordinary meaning.\n    Given this survey of relevant dictionaries, the ordinary meaning of\n    “interpreter” does not include those who translate writings. Nothing\n    in the Court Interpreters Act or in §1920 hints that Congress intend-\n    ed to go beyond this ordinary meaning. If anything, the statutory\n    context suggests that “interpreter” includes only those who translate\n    orally. See 28 U. S. C. §1827. Moreover, Congress’ use of technical\n    terminology reflects the distinction in relevant professional literature\n    between interpreters, who are used for oral conversations, and trans-\n    lators, who are used for written communications. Pp. 5−11.\n      (c) No other tool of construction compels a departure from the ordi-\n    nary meaning of “interpreter.” This Court has never held that Rule\n    54(d) creates a presumption in favor of the broadest possible reading\n    of the costs enumerated in §1920. To the contrary, the Court has\n    made clear that the “discretion granted by Rule 54(d) is not a power\n    to evade” the specific categories of costs set forth by Congress, Craw-\n    ford Fitting, supra, at 442, but “is solely a power to decline to tax, as\n    costs, the items enumerated in §1920,” ibid. This Court’s conclusion\n    is in keeping with the narrow bounds of taxable costs, which are\n    limited by statute and modest in scope. Respondent’s extratextual\n    arguments―that documentary evidence is no less important than tes-\n    timonial evidence and that some translation tasks are not entirely\n    oral or entirely written―are more properly directed at Congress. In\n    any event, neither argument is so compelling that Congress must\n    have intended to dispense with the ordinary meaning of “interpreter”\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

KAN PACIFIC\n SAIPAN, LTD., DBA MARIANAS RESORT AND SPA\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n                                [May 21, 2012]\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The costs that may be awarded to prevailing parties in\nlawsuits brought in federal court are set forth in 28\nU. S. C. §1920. The Court Interpreters Act amended\nthat statute to include “compensation of interpreters.”\n§1920(6); see also §7, 92 Stat. 2044. The question pre-\nsented in this case is whether “compensation of interpret-\ners” covers the cost of translating documents. Because the\nordinary meaning of the word “interpreter” is a person\nwho translates orally from one language to another, we\nhold that “compensation of interpreters” is limited to the\ncost of oral translation and does not include the cost of\ndocument translation.\n                              I\n  This case arises from a personal injury action brought\nby petitioner Kouichi Taniguchi, a professional baseball\nplayer in Japan, against respondent Kan Pacific Saipan,\nLtd., the owner of a resort in the Northern Mariana Is-\nlands. Petitioner was injured when his leg broke through\na wooden deck during a tour of respondent’s resort prop-\nerty. Initially, petitioner said that he needed no medical\n2         TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nattention, but two weeks later, he informed respondent\nthat he had suffered cuts, bruises, and torn ligaments\nfrom the accident. Due to these alleged injuries, he\nclaimed damages for medical expenses and for lost income\nfrom contracts he was unable to honor. After discovery\nconcluded, both parties moved for summary judgment.\nThe United States District Court for the Northern Ma-\nriana Islands granted respondent’s motion on the ground\nthat petitioner offered no evidence that respondent knew\nof the defective deck or otherwise failed to exercise rea-\nsonable care.\n   In preparing its defense, respondent paid to have vari-\nous documents translated from Japanese to English. After\nthe District Court granted summary judgment in respond-\nent’s favor, respondent submitted a bill for those costs.\nOver petitioner’s objection, the District Court awarded\nthe costs to respondent as “compensation of interpreters”\nunder §1920(6). Explaining that interpreter services “can-\nnot be separated into ‘translation’ and ‘interpretation,’ ”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 25a, the court held that costs\nfor document translation “fal[l] within the meaning of\n‘compensation of an interpreter,’ ” ibid. Finding that it\nwas necessary for respondent to have the documents\ntranslated in order to depose petitioner, the court con-\ncluded that the translation services were properly taxed\nas costs.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-\ncuit affirmed both the District Court’s grant of summary\njudgment and its award of costs. The court rejected peti-\ntioner’s argument that the cost of document translation\nservices is not recoverable as “compensation of interpret-\ners.” The court explained that “the word ‘interpreter’ can\nreasonably encompass a ‘translator,’ both according to the\ndictionary definition and common usage of these terms,\nwhich does not always draw precise distinctions between\nforeign language interpretations involving live speech\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

The court thus concluded that “the prevailing party\nshould be awarded costs for services required to interpret\neither live speech or written documents into a familiar\nlanguage, so long as interpretation of the items is neces-\nsary to the litigation.” Id., at 1221–1222.\n  Because there is a split among the Courts of Appeals on\nthis issue,1 we granted certiorari. 564 U.

J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437, 439 (1987). Yet\neven in the absence of express legislative authorization,\nthe practice of referring to state rules for the taxation of\ncosts persisted. See Alyeska Pipeline, 421 U. S., at 250.\n   Not until 1853 did Congress enact legislation specifying\nthe costs allowable in federal court. Id., at 251. The\nimpetus for a uniform federal rule was largely the conse-\nquence of two developments. First, a “great diversity in\npractice among the courts” had emerged. Ibid. Second,\n“losing litigants were being unfairly saddled with exorbi-\ntant fees for the victor’s attorney.” Ibid. Against this\nbackdrop, Congress passed the 1853 Fee Act, which we\nhave described as a “far-reaching Act specifying in detail\nthe nature and amount of the taxable items of cost in the\nfederal courts.” Id., at 251–252. The substance of this Act\nwas transmitted through the Revised Statutes of 1874\nand the Judicial Code of 1911 to the Revised Code of\n1948, where it was codified, “without any apparent intent to\nchange the controlling rules,” as 28 U. S. C. §1920. 421\nU. S., at 255.\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d) gives courts the\ndiscretion to award costs to prevailing parties. That Rule\nprovides in relevant part: “Unless a federal statute, these\nrules, or a court order provides otherwise, costs—other\nthan attorney’s fees—should be allowed to the prevailing\nparty.” Rule 54(d)(1). We have held that “§1920 defines\nthe term ‘costs’ as used in Rule 54(d).” Crawford Fitting,\n482 U. S., at 441. In so doing, we rejected the view that\n“the discretion granted by Rule 54(d) is a separate source\nof power to tax as costs expenses not enumerated in\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)              5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n§1920.” Ibid.\n   As originally configured, §1920 contained five categories\nof taxable costs: (1) “[f]ees of the clerk and marshal”; (2)\n“[f ]ees of the court reporter for all or any part of the steno-\ngraphic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the\ncase”; (3) “[f]ees and disbursements for printing and wit-\nnesses”; (4) “[f]ees for exemplification and copies of papers\nnecessarily obtained for use in the case”; and (5) “[d]ocket\nfees under section 1923 of this title.” 62 Stat. 955. In\n1978, Congress enacted the Court Interpreters Act, which\namended §1920 to add a sixth category: “Compensation of\ncourt appointed experts, compensation of interpreters, and\nsalaries, fees, expenses, and costs of special interpretation\nservices under section 1828 of this title.” 28 U. S. C.\n§1920(6); see also §7, 92 Stat. 2044. We are concerned\nhere with this sixth category, specifically the item of tax-\nable costs identified as “compensation of interpreters.”\n                             B\n  To determine whether the item “compensation of inter-\npreters” includes costs for document translation, we must\nlook to the meaning of “interpreter.” That term is not\ndefined in the Court Interpreters Act or in any other\nrelevant statutory provision. When a term goes undefined\nin a statute, we give the term its ordinary meaning. As­\ngrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187 (1995).\nThe question here is: What is the ordinary meaning of\n“interpreter”?\n  Many dictionaries in use when Congress enacted the\nCourt Interpreters Act in 1978 defined “interpreter” as one\nwho translates spoken, as opposed to written, language.\nThe American Heritage Dictionary, for instance, defined\nthe term as “[o]ne who translates orally from one language\ninto another.” American Heritage Dictionary 685 (1978).\nThe Scribner-Bantam English Dictionary defined the\nrelated word “interpret” as “to translate orally.” Scribner-\n6          TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBantam English Dictionary 476 (1977). Similarly, the\nRandom House Dictionary defined the intransitive form of\n“interpret” as “to translate what is said in a foreign lan-\nguage.” Random House Dictionary of the English Lan-\nguage 744 (1973) (emphasis added). And, notably, the\nOxford English Dictionary defined “interpreter” as “[o]ne\nwho translates languages,” but then divided that defini-\ntion into two senses: “a. [a] translator of books or writ-\nings,” which it designated as obsolete, and “b. [o]ne who\ntranslates the communications of persons speaking differ-\nent languages; spec. one whose office it is to do so orally in\nthe presence of the persons; a dragoman.” 5 Oxford Eng-\nlish Dictionary 416 (1933); see also Concise Oxford Dic-\ntionary of Current English 566 (6th ed. 1976) (“One who\ninterprets; one whose office it is to translate the words of\npersons speaking different languages, esp. orally in their\npresence”); Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary 686\n(1973) (“one who translates orally for the benefit of two or\nmore parties speaking different languages: . . . a transla-\ntor (obs.)”).\n   Pre-1978 legal dictionaries also generally defined the\nwords “interpreter” and “interpret” in terms of oral trans-\nlation. The then-current edition of Black’s Law Diction-\nary, for example, defined “interpreter” as “[a] person\nsworn at a trial to interpret the evidence of a foreigner . . .\nto the court,” and it defined “interpret” in relevant part as\n“to translate orally from one tongue to another.” Black’s\nLaw Dictionary 954, 953 (rev. 4th ed. 1968); see also\nW. Anderson, A Dictionary of Law 565 (1888) (“One who\ntranslates the testimony of witnesses speaking a foreign\ntongue, for the benefit of the court and jury”); 1 B. Abbott,\nDictionary of Terms and Phrases Used in American or\nEnglish Jurisprudence 639 (1878) (“one who restates the\ntestimony of a witness testifying in a foreign tongue, to the\ncourt and jury, in their language”). But see Ballentine’s\nLaw Dictionary 655, 654 (3d ed. 1969) (defining “inter-\n                    Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                  7\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\npreter” as “[o]ne who interprets, particularly one who\ninterprets words written or spoken in a foreign language,”\nand “interpret” as “to translate from a foreign language”).\n   Against these authorities, respondent relies almost\nexclusively on Webster’s Third New International Diction-\nary (hereinafter Webster’s Third). The version of that\ndictionary in print when Congress enacted the Court\nInterpreters Act defined “interpreter” as “one that trans-\nlates; esp: a person who translates orally for parties con-\nversing in different tongues.”       Webster’s Third 1182\n(1976).2 The sense divider esp (for especially) indicates\nthat the most common meaning of the term is one “who\ntranslates orally,” but that meaning is subsumed within\nthe more general definition “one that translates.” See\n12,000 Words: A Supplement to Webster’s Third 15a\n(1986) (explaining that esp “is used to introduce the most\ncommon meaning included in the more general preceding\ndefinition”). For respondent, the general definition suf-\nfices to establish that the term “interpreter” ordinarily\nincludes persons who translate the written word. Explain-\ning that “the word ‘interpreter’ can reasonably encompass\na ‘translator,’ ” the Court of Appeals reached the same\nconclusion. 633 F. 3d, at 1221. We disagree.\n   That a definition is broad enough to encompass one\nsense of a word does not establish that the word is ordi­\nnarily understood in that sense. See Mallard v. United\nStates Dist. Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa, 490 U. S.\n\n——————\n  2 A handful of other contemporaneous dictionaries used a similar\n\nformulation. See Funk & Wagnalls New Comprehensive International\nDictionary of the English Language 665 (1977) (“One who interprets or\ntranslates; specifically, one who serves as oral translator between\npeople speaking different languages”); 1 World Book Dictionary 1103\n(C. Barnhart & R. Barnhart eds. 1977) (“a person whose business is\ntranslating, especially orally, from a foreign language”); Cassell’s\nEnglish Dictionary 617 (4th ed. 1969) (“One who interprets, esp. one\nemployed to translate orally to persons speaking a foreign language”).\n8         TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n296, 301 (1989) (relying on the “most common meaning”\nand the “ordinary and natural signification” of the word\n“request,” even though it may sometimes “double for ‘de-\nmand’ or ‘command’ ”). The fact that the definition of\n“interpreter” in Webster’s Third has a sense divider denot-\ning the most common usage suggests that other usages,\nalthough acceptable, might not be common or ordinary. It\nis telling that all the dictionaries cited above defined\n“interpreter” at the time of the statute’s enactment as\nincluding persons who translate orally, but only a handful\ndefined the word broadly enough to encompass translators\nof written material. See supra, at 5–7. Although the\nOxford English Dictionary, one of the most authoritative\non the English language, recognized that “interpreter” can\nmean one who translates writings, it expressly designated\nthat meaning as obsolete. See supra, at 6. Were the\nmeaning of “interpreter” that respondent advocates truly\ncommon or ordinary, we would expect to see more support\nfor that meaning. We certainly would not expect to see it\ndesignated as obsolete in the Oxford English Dictionary.\nAny definition of a word that is absent from many diction-\naries and is deemed obsolete in others is hardly a common\nor ordinary meaning.\n  Based on our survey of the relevant dictionaries, we\nconclude that the ordinary or common meaning of “inter-\npreter” does not include those who translate writings.\nInstead, we find that an interpreter is normally under-\nstood as one who translates orally from one language to\nanother. This sense of the word is far more natural. As\nthe Seventh Circuit put it: “Robert Fagles made famous\ntranslations into English of the Iliad, the Odyssey, and the\nAeneid, but no one would refer to him as an English-\nlanguage ‘interpreter’ of these works.” Extra Equipamen­\ntos E Exportação Ltda. v. Case Corp., 541 F. 3d 719, 727\n(2008).\n  To be sure, the word “interpreter” can encompass per-\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

Nothing in the Court Interpreters Act or in §1920,\nhowever, even hints that Congress intended to go beyond\nthe ordinary meaning of “interpreter” and to embrace the\nbroadest possible meaning that the definition of the word\ncan bear.\n   If anything, the statutory context suggests the opposite:\nthat the word “interpreter” applies only to those who\ntranslate orally. As previously mentioned, Congress en-\nacted §1920(6) as part of the Court Interpreters Act.\nThe main provision of that Act is §2(a), codified in 28\nU. S. C. §§1827 and 1828. See 92 Stat. 2040–2042. Par-\nticularly relevant here is §1827. As it now reads, that\nstatute provides for the establishment of “a program to\nfacilitate the use of certified and otherwise qualified inter-\npreters in judicial proceedings instituted by the United\nStates.” §1827(a). Subsection (d) directs courts to use an\ninterpreter in any criminal or civil action instituted by the\nUnited States if a party or witness “speaks only or primar-\nily a language other than the English language” or “suffers\nfrom a hearing impairment” “so as to inhibit such party’s\ncomprehension of the proceedings or communication with\ncounsel or the presiding judicial officer, or so as to inhibit\nsuch witness’ comprehension of questions and the presen-\ntation of such testimony.” §1827(d)(1).3 As originally\nenacted, subsection (k) mandated that the “interpretation\nprovided by certified interpreters . . . shall be in the con-\nsecutive mode except that the presiding judicial officer . . .\nmay authorize a simultaneous or summary interpreta-\ntion.” §1827(k) (1976 ed., Supp. II); see also 92 Stat. 2042.\n——————\n   3 This provision remains substantially the same as it appeared when\n\nfirst enacted. See 28 U. S. C. §1827(d)(1) (1976 ed., Supp. II); see also\n92 Stat. 2040.\n10           TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nIn its current form, subsection (k) provides that interpre-\ntation “shall be in the simultaneous mode for any party . . .\nand in the consecutive mode for witnesses,” unless the\ncourt directs otherwise. The simultaneous, consecutive,\nand summary modes are all methods of oral interpretation\nand have nothing to do with the translation of writings.4\nTaken together, these provisions are a strong contextual\nclue that Congress was dealing only with oral translation\nin the Court Interpreters Act and that it intended to use\nthe term “interpreter” throughout the Act in its ordinary\nsense as someone who translates the spoken word. As we\nhave said before, it is a “ ‘normal rule of statutory con-\nstruction’ that ‘identical words used in different parts of\nthe same act are intended to have the same meaning.’ ”\nGustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 570 (1995) (quoting\nDepartment of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc., 510\nU. S. 332, 342 (1994)).5\n  The references to technical terminology in the Court\nInterpreters Act further suggest that Congress used “in-\n——————\n   4 The simultaneous mode requires the interpreter “to interpret and to\n\nspeak contemporaneously with the individual whose communication is\nbeing translated.” H. R. Rep. No. 95–1687, p. 8 (1978). The consecutive\nmode requires the speaker whose communication is being translated to\npause so that the interpreter can “convey the testimony given.” Ibid.\nAnd the summary mode “allow[s] the interpreter to condense and distill\nthe speech of the speaker.” Ibid.; see generally Zazueta, Attorneys\nGuide to the Use of Court Interpreters, 8 U. C. D. L. Rev. 471, 477–478\n(1975).\n   5 The dissent agrees that context should help guide our analysis, but\n\ninstead of looking to the Court Interpreters Act, it looks to “the practice\nof federal courts both before and after §1920(6)’s enactment.” Post, at 4\n(opinion of GINSBURG, J.). The practice of federal courts after the Act’s\nenactment tells us nothing about what Congress intended at the time of\nenactment. And federal court practice before the Act under other\nprovisions of §1920 tells us little, if anything, about what Congress\nintended when it added subsection (6). We think the statutory context\nin which the word “interpreter” appears is a more reliable guide to its\nmeaning.\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

Brislin ed. 1976) (explaining that when\nboth terms are used together, translation “refers to the\nprocessing [of] written input, and interpretation to the\nprocessing of oral input” (emphasis deleted)); J. Herbert,\nInterpreter’s Handbook 1 (2d ed. 1952) (“In the present-\nday jargon of international organisations, the words trans-\nlate, translations, translator are used when the immediate\nresult of the work is a written text; and the words inter-\npret, interpreter, interpretation when it is a speech deliv-\nered orally”). That Congress specified “interpreters” but\nnot “translators” is yet another signal that it intended to\nlimit §1920(6) to the costs of oral, instead of written,\ntranslation.6\n   In sum, both the ordinary and technical meanings of\n“interpreter,” as well as the statutory context in which the\nword is found, lead to the conclusion that §1920(6) does\nnot apply to translators of written materials.7\n——————\n  6 Some   provisions within the United States Code use both “inter-\npreter” and “translator” together, thus implying that Congress under-\nstands the terms to have the distinct meanings described above. See,\ne.g., 8 U. S. C. §1555(b) (providing that appropriations for the Immigra-\ntion and Naturalization Service “shall be available for payment of . . .\ninterpreters and translators who are not citizens of the United States”);\n28 U. S. C. §530C(b)(1)(I) (providing that Department of Justice funds\nmay be used for “[p]ayment of interpreters and translators who are not\ncitizens of the United States”).\n   7 Our conclusion is buttressed by respondent’s concession at oral ar-\n\ngument that there is no provision in the United States Code where it is\n12          TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n                             C\n   No other rule of construction compels us to depart from\nthe ordinary meaning of “interpreter.” The Court of Ap-\npeals reasoned that a broader meaning is “more compat-\nible with Rule 54 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\nwhich includes a decided preference for the award of costs\nto the prevailing party.” 633 F. 3d, at 1221. But we have\nnever held that Rule 54(d) creates a presumption of statu-\ntory construction in favor of the broadest possible reading\nof the costs enumerated in §1920. To the contrary, we\nhave made clear that the “discretion granted by Rule 54(d)\nis not a power to evade” the specific categories of costs set\nforth by Congress. Crawford Fitting, 482 U. S., at 442.\n“Rather,” we have said, “it is solely a power to decline to\ntax, as costs, the items enumerated in §1920.” Ibid. Rule\n54(d) thus provides no sound basis for casting aside the\nordinary meaning of the various items enumerated in\nthe costs statute, including the ordinary meaning of\n“interpreter.”\n   Our decision is in keeping with the narrow scope of\ntaxable costs. “Although ‘costs’ has an everyday meaning\nsynonymous with ‘expenses,’ the concept of taxable costs\nunder Rule 54(d) is more limited and represents those\nexpenses, including, for example, court fees, that a court\nwill assess against a litigant.” 10 C. Wright, A. Miller, &\nM. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure §2666, pp. 202–\n203 (3d ed. 1998) (hereinafter Wright & Miller). Taxable\ncosts are limited to relatively minor, incidental expenses\nas is evident from §1920, which lists such items as clerk\n——————\nclear that the word extends to those who translate documents. Tr. of\nOral Arg. 39; see also Brief for Petitioner 32 (“And the Code is wholly\ndevoid of any corresponding definition of ‘interpreter’ extending to the\ntranslation of written documents”). As respondent acknowledged,\neither the word is used in a context that strongly suggests it applies\nonly to oral translation or its meaning is unclear.

In-\ndeed, “the assessment of costs most often is merely a\nclerical matter that can be done by the court clerk.” Hair­\nline Creations, Inc. v. Kefalas, 664 F. 2d 652, 656 (CA7\n1981). Taxable costs are a fraction of the nontaxable\nexpenses borne by litigants for attorneys, experts, consult-\nants, and investigators. It comes as little surprise, there-\nfore, that “costs almost always amount to less than the\nsuccessful litigant’s total expenses in connection with a\nlawsuit.” 10 Wright & Miller §2666, at 203. Because\ntaxable costs are limited by statute and are modest in\nscope, we see no compelling reason to stretch the ordinary\nmeaning of the cost items Congress authorized in §1920.\n   As for respondent’s extratextual arguments, they are\nmore properly directed at Congress. Respondent contends\nthat documentary evidence is no less important than\ntestimonial evidence and that it would be anomalous to\nrequire the losing party to cover translation costs for\nspoken words but not for written words. Brief for Re-\nspondent 20. Respondent also observes that some transla-\ntion tasks are not entirely oral or entirely written. Id., at\n20–24. One task, called “ ‘sight translation,’ ” involves the\noral translation of a document. Id., at 21. Another task\ninvolves the written translation of speech. Ibid. And a\nthird task, called “ ‘document comparison,’ ” involves com-\nparing documents in the source and target language to\nverify that the two are identical. Id., at 21–22. Respond-\nent argues that a narrow definition cannot account for\nthese variations and that a bright-line definition of “inter-\npreter” as someone who translates spoken and written\nwords would avoid complication and provide a simple,\nadministrable rule for district courts.\n   Neither of these arguments convinces us that Congress\nmust have intended to dispense with the ordinary mean-\n14          TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ning of “interpreter” in §1920(6). First, Congress might\nhave distinguished between oral and written translation\nout of a concern that requiring losing parties to bear\nthe potentially sizable costs of translating discovery docu-\nments, as opposed to the more limited costs of oral tes-\ntimony, could be too burdensome and possibly unfair,\nespecially for litigants with limited means. Cf. Fleischmann\nDistilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., 386 U. S. 714, 718\n(1967) (noting the argument “that since litigation is at\nbest uncertain one should not be penalized for merely\ndefending or prosecuting a lawsuit, and that the poor\nmight be unjustly discouraged from instituting actions to\nvindicate their rights if the penalty for losing included the\nfees of their opponents’ counsel”). Congress might also\nhave concluded that a document translator is more akin to\nan expert or consultant retained by a party to decipher\ndocumentary evidence—like, for instance, a forensic ac-\ncountant—than to an interpreter whose real-time oral\ntranslation services are necessary for communication\nbetween litigants, witnesses, and the court.8\n  Second, respondent has not shown that any of the hy-\nbrid translation/interpretation tasks to which it points\nactually arise with overwhelming frequency or that the\nproblem of drawing the line between taxable and nontax-\nable costs in such cases will vex the trial courts. It cer-\ntainly has not shown that any such problems will be more\ntroublesome than the task of sifting through translated\n——————\n  8 The dissent contends that document translation, no less than oral\n\ntranslation, is essential “to equip the parties to present their case\nclearly and the court to decide the merits intelligently.” Post, at 5. But\na document translator is no more important than an expert or consult-\nant in making sense of otherwise incomprehensible documentary\nevidence, yet expenses for experts and consultants are generally not\ntaxable as costs. To be sure, forgoing document translation can impair\na litigant’s case, but document translation is not indispensable, in the\nway oral translation is, to the parties’ ability to communicate with each\nother, with witnesses, and with the court.\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

Congress therefore provided, in 28\nU. S. C. §1920(6), that the prevailing party may recoup\ncompensation paid to “interpreters.” The word “interpret­\ners,” the Court emphasizes, commonly refers to translators\nof oral speech. Ante, at 5–6. But as the Court acknowl­\nedges, ante, at 7, and n. 2, “interpreters” is more than\noccasionally used to encompass those who translate writ­\nten speech as well. See Webster’s Third New International\nDictionary of the English Language 1182 (1976) (here-\ninafter Webster’s) (defining “interpreter” as “one that\ntranslates; esp: a person who translates orally for parties\nconversing in different tongues”); Black’s Law Dictionary\n895 (9th ed. 2009) (defining “interpreter” as a “person who\ntranslates, esp. orally, from one language to another”);\nBallentine’s Law Dictionary 655 (3d ed. 1969) (defining\n“interpreter” as “[o]ne who interprets, particularly one\nwho interprets words written or spoken in a foreign\nlanguage”).\n  In short, employing the word “interpreters” to include\ntranslators of written as well as oral speech, if not “the\nmost common usage,” ante, at 8, is at least an “acceptable”\n2         TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nusage, ibid. Moreover, the word “interpret” is generally\nunderstood to mean “to explain or tell the meaning of:\ntranslate into intelligible or familiar language or terms,”\nwhile “translate” commonly means “to turn into one’s own\nor another language.” Webster’s 1182, 2429. See also\nRandom House Dictionary of the English Language 744,\n1505 (1973) (defining the transitive verb “interpret” as,\ninter alia, “to translate,” and “translate” as “to turn (some­\nthing written or spoken) from one language into another”).\n   Notably, several federal district court decisions refer to\ntranslators of written documents as “interpreters.” E.g.,\nUnited States v.

Before the Court Inter­\npreters Act added §1920(6) to the taxation of costs statute\nin 1978, district courts awarded costs for document trans­\nlation under §1920(4), which allowed taxation of “[f ]ees for\nexemplification and copies of papers,” 28 U.

But if the interpreter\nthen reads the prepared written translation aloud in\ncourt, that task, in Taniguchi’s view, can be charged as\n“interpretation,” id., at 11, even though the reading in­\nvolves no translation of foreign-language expression—\nwritten or oral—at all.\n   Similarly hard to categorize is the common court­\ninterpreter task of listening to a recording in a foreign\nlanguage, transcribing it, then translating it into Eng-\nlish. See González 439. Although this task involves oral\nforeign-language communication, it does not, Taniguchi\ncontends, qualify as “interpretation,” because it involves\n“the luxury of multiple playbacks of the tape and the\nleisure to consult extrinsic linguistic sources.” Reply Brief\nfor Petitioner 9 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Argued February 21, 2012—Decided May 21, 2012\nTitle 28 U. S. C. §1920, as amended by the Court Interpreters Act, in-\n  cludes “compensation of interpreters” among the costs that may be\n  awarded to prevailing parties in federal-court lawsuits. §1920(6). In\n  this case, the District Court awarded costs to respondent as the pre-\n  vailing party in a civil action instituted by petitioner. The award in-\n  cluded the cost of translating from Japanese to English certain doc-\n  uments that respondent used in preparing its defense. The Ninth\n  Circuit affirmed, concluding that §1920(6) covers the cost of translat-\n  ing documents as well as the cost of translating live speech.\nHeld: Because the ordinary meaning of “interpreter” is someone who\n translates orally from one language to another, the category “com-\n pensation of interpreters” in §1920(6) does not include the cost of\n document translation. Pp. 3−15.\n    (a) Section 1920 reflects the substance of an 1853 Act that specified\n for the first time what costs are allowable in federal court. That pro-\n vision defines the term “costs” as used in Federal Rule of Civil Proce-\n dure 54(d), which gives courts the discretion to award costs to pre-\n vailing parties. Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S.\n 437, 441. As originally configured, §1920 contained five categories of\n taxable costs, but in 1978, Congress enacted the Court Interpreters\n Act, which added a sixth category that includes “compensation of in-\n terpreters.” §1920(6). Pp. 3−5.\n    (b) Because the term “interpreter” is not defined in the Court In-\n terpreters Act or in any other relevant statutory provision, it must be\n given its ordinary meaning. Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S.\n 179, 187. When Congress passed that Act in 1978, many dictionaries\n defined “interpreter” as one who translates spoken, as opposed to\n2             TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    written, language. Pre-1978 legal dictionaries also generally defined\n    “interpreter” and “interpret” in terms of oral translation. Respondent\n    relies almost exclusively on a version of Webster’s Third New Inter-\n    national Dictionary that defined “interpreter” as “one that translates;\n    esp: a person who translates orally for parties conversing in different\n    tongues.” Although the sense divider esp (for especially) indicates\n    that the most common meaning of the term is one “who translates\n    orally,” that meaning is subsumed within the more general definition\n    “one that translates.” That a definition is broad enough to encompass\n    one sense of a word does not establish, however, that the word is or-\n    dinarily understood in that sense. See Mallard v. United States Dist.\n    Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa, 490 U. S. 296, 301. Although all\n    relevant dictionaries defined “interpreter” at the time of the statute’s\n    enactment as including persons who translate orally, only a handful\n    defined the word broadly enough to encompass translators of written\n    materials. Notably, the Oxford English Dictionary, one of the most\n    authoritative, recognized that “interpreter” can mean one who trans-\n    lates writings, but it expressly designated that meaning as obsolete.\n    Any definition of a word that is absent from many dictionaries and is\n    deemed obsolete in others is hardly a common or ordinary meaning.\n    Given this survey of relevant dictionaries, the ordinary meaning of\n    “interpreter” does not include those who translate writings. Nothing\n    in the Court Interpreters Act or in §1920 hints that Congress intend-\n    ed to go beyond this ordinary meaning. If anything, the statutory\n    context suggests that “interpreter” includes only those who translate\n    orally. See 28 U. S. C. §1827. Moreover, Congress’ use of technical\n    terminology reflects the distinction in relevant professional literature\n    between interpreters, who are used for oral conversations, and trans-\n    lators, who are used for written communications. Pp. 5−11.\n      (c) No other tool of construction compels a departure from the ordi-\n    nary meaning of “interpreter.” This Court has never held that Rule\n    54(d) creates a presumption in favor of the broadest possible reading\n    of the costs enumerated in §1920. To the contrary, the Court has\n    made clear that the “discretion granted by Rule 54(d) is not a power\n    to evade” the specific categories of costs set forth by Congress, Craw-\n    ford Fitting, supra, at 442, but “is solely a power to decline to tax, as\n    costs, the items enumerated in §1920,” ibid. This Court’s conclusion\n    is in keeping with the narrow bounds of taxable costs, which are\n    limited by statute and modest in scope. Respondent’s extratextual\n    arguments―that documentary evidence is no less important than tes-\n    timonial evidence and that some translation tasks are not entirely\n    oral or entirely written―are more properly directed at Congress. In\n    any event, neither argument is so compelling that Congress must\n    have intended to dispense with the ordinary meaning of “interpreter”\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

S. C. §1920. The Court Interpreters Act amended\nthat statute to include “compensation of interpreters.”\n§1920(6); see also §7, 92 Stat. 2044. The question pre-\nsented in this case is whether “compensation of interpret-\ners” covers the cost of translating documents. Because the\nordinary meaning of the word “interpreter” is a person\nwho translates orally from one language to another, we\nhold that “compensation of interpreters” is limited to the\ncost of oral translation and does not include the cost of\ndocument translation.\n                              I\n  This case arises from a personal injury action brought\nby petitioner Kouichi Taniguchi, a professional baseball\nplayer in Japan, against respondent Kan Pacific Saipan,\nLtd., the owner of a resort in the Northern Mariana Is-\nlands. Petitioner was injured when his leg broke through\na wooden deck during a tour of respondent’s resort prop-\nerty. Initially, petitioner said that he needed no medical\n2         TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nattention, but two weeks later, he informed respondent\nthat he had suffered cuts, bruises, and torn ligaments\nfrom the accident. Due to these alleged injuries, he\nclaimed damages for medical expenses and for lost income\nfrom contracts he was unable to honor. After discovery\nconcluded, both parties moved for summary judgment.\nThe United States District Court for the Northern Ma-\nriana Islands granted respondent’s motion on the ground\nthat petitioner offered no evidence that respondent knew\nof the defective deck or otherwise failed to exercise rea-\nsonable care.\n   In preparing its defense, respondent paid to have vari-\nous documents translated from Japanese to English. After\nthe District Court granted summary judgment in respond-\nent’s favor, respondent submitted a bill for those costs.\nOver petitioner’s objection, the District Court awarded\nthe costs to respondent as “compensation of interpreters”\nunder §1920(6). Explaining that interpreter services “can-\nnot be separated into ‘translation’ and ‘interpretation,’ ”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 25a, the court held that costs\nfor document translation “fal[l] within the meaning of\n‘compensation of an interpreter,’ ” ibid. Finding that it\nwas necessary for respondent to have the documents\ntranslated in order to depose petitioner, the court con-\ncluded that the translation services were properly taxed\nas costs.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-\ncuit affirmed both the District Court’s grant of summary\njudgment and its award of costs. The court rejected peti-\ntioner’s argument that the cost of document translation\nservices is not recoverable as “compensation of interpret-\ners.” The court explained that “the word ‘interpreter’ can\nreasonably encompass a ‘translator,’ both according to the\ndictionary definition and common usage of these terms,\nwhich does not always draw precise distinctions between\nforeign language interpretations involving live speech\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

The court thus concluded that “the prevailing party\nshould be awarded costs for services required to interpret\neither live speech or written documents into a familiar\nlanguage, so long as interpretation of the items is neces-\nsary to the litigation.” Id., at 1221–1222.\n  Because there is a split among the Courts of Appeals on\nthis issue,1 we granted certiorari. 564 U.

J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437, 439 (1987). Yet\neven in the absence of express legislative authorization,\nthe practice of referring to state rules for the taxation of\ncosts persisted. See Alyeska Pipeline, 421 U. S., at 250.\n   Not until 1853 did Congress enact legislation specifying\nthe costs allowable in federal court. Id., at 251. The\nimpetus for a uniform federal rule was largely the conse-\nquence of two developments. First, a “great diversity in\npractice among the courts” had emerged. Ibid. Second,\n“losing litigants were being unfairly saddled with exorbi-\ntant fees for the victor’s attorney.” Ibid. Against this\nbackdrop, Congress passed the 1853 Fee Act, which we\nhave described as a “far-reaching Act specifying in detail\nthe nature and amount of the taxable items of cost in the\nfederal courts.” Id., at 251–252. The substance of this Act\nwas transmitted through the Revised Statutes of 1874\nand the Judicial Code of 1911 to the Revised Code of\n1948, where it was codified, “without any apparent intent to\nchange the controlling rules,” as 28 U. S. C. §1920. 421\nU. S., at 255.\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d) gives courts the\ndiscretion to award costs to prevailing parties. That Rule\nprovides in relevant part: “Unless a federal statute, these\nrules, or a court order provides otherwise, costs—other\nthan attorney’s fees—should be allowed to the prevailing\nparty.” Rule 54(d)(1). We have held that “§1920 defines\nthe term ‘costs’ as used in Rule 54(d).” Crawford Fitting,\n482 U. S., at 441. In so doing, we rejected the view that\n“the discretion granted by Rule 54(d) is a separate source\nof power to tax as costs expenses not enumerated in\n                  Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)              5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n§1920.” Ibid.\n   As originally configured, §1920 contained five categories\nof taxable costs: (1) “[f]ees of the clerk and marshal”; (2)\n“[f ]ees of the court reporter for all or any part of the steno-\ngraphic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the\ncase”; (3) “[f]ees and disbursements for printing and wit-\nnesses”; (4) “[f]ees for exemplification and copies of papers\nnecessarily obtained for use in the case”; and (5) “[d]ocket\nfees under section 1923 of this title.” 62 Stat. 955. In\n1978, Congress enacted the Court Interpreters Act, which\namended §1920 to add a sixth category: “Compensation of\ncourt appointed experts, compensation of interpreters, and\nsalaries, fees, expenses, and costs of special interpretation\nservices under section 1828 of this title.” 28 U. S. C.\n§1920(6); see also §7, 92 Stat. 2044. We are concerned\nhere with this sixth category, specifically the item of tax-\nable costs identified as “compensation of interpreters.”\n                             B\n  To determine whether the item “compensation of inter-\npreters” includes costs for document translation, we must\nlook to the meaning of “interpreter.” That term is not\ndefined in the Court Interpreters Act or in any other\nrelevant statutory provision. When a term goes undefined\nin a statute, we give the term its ordinary meaning. As­\ngrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187 (1995).\nThe question here is: What is the ordinary meaning of\n“interpreter”?\n  Many dictionaries in use when Congress enacted the\nCourt Interpreters Act in 1978 defined “interpreter” as one\nwho translates spoken, as opposed to written, language.\nThe American Heritage Dictionary, for instance, defined\nthe term as “[o]ne who translates orally from one language\ninto another.” American Heritage Dictionary 685 (1978).\nThe Scribner-Bantam English Dictionary defined the\nrelated word “interpret” as “to translate orally.” Scribner-\n6          TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBantam English Dictionary 476 (1977). Similarly, the\nRandom House Dictionary defined the intransitive form of\n“interpret” as “to translate what is said in a foreign lan-\nguage.” Random House Dictionary of the English Lan-\nguage 744 (1973) (emphasis added). And, notably, the\nOxford English Dictionary defined “interpreter” as “[o]ne\nwho translates languages,” but then divided that defini-\ntion into two senses: “a. [a] translator of books or writ-\nings,” which it designated as obsolete, and “b. [o]ne who\ntranslates the communications of persons speaking differ-\nent languages; spec. one whose office it is to do so orally in\nthe presence of the persons; a dragoman.” 5 Oxford Eng-\nlish Dictionary 416 (1933); see also Concise Oxford Dic-\ntionary of Current English 566 (6th ed. 1976) (“One who\ninterprets; one whose office it is to translate the words of\npersons speaking different languages, esp. orally in their\npresence”); Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary 686\n(1973) (“one who translates orally for the benefit of two or\nmore parties speaking different languages: . . . a transla-\ntor (obs.)”).\n   Pre-1978 legal dictionaries also generally defined the\nwords “interpreter” and “interpret” in terms of oral trans-\nlation. The then-current edition of Black’s Law Diction-\nary, for example, defined “interpreter” as “[a] person\nsworn at a trial to interpret the evidence of a foreigner . . .\nto the court,” and it defined “interpret” in relevant part as\n“to translate orally from one tongue to another.” Black’s\nLaw Dictionary 954, 953 (rev. 4th ed. 1968); see also\nW. Anderson, A Dictionary of Law 565 (1888) (“One who\ntranslates the testimony of witnesses speaking a foreign\ntongue, for the benefit of the court and jury”); 1 B.

The version of that\ndictionary in print when Congress enacted the Court\nInterpreters Act defined “interpreter” as “one that trans-\nlates; esp: a person who translates orally for parties con-\nversing in different tongues.”       Webster’s Third 1182\n(1976).2 The sense divider esp (for especially) indicates\nthat the most common meaning of the term is one “who\ntranslates orally,” but that meaning is subsumed within\nthe more general definition “one that translates.” See\n12,000 Words: A Supplement to Webster’s Third 15a\n(1986) (explaining that esp “is used to introduce the most\ncommon meaning included in the more general preceding\ndefinition”). For respondent, the general definition suf-\nfices to establish that the term “interpreter” ordinarily\nincludes persons who translate the written word. Explain-\ning that “the word ‘interpreter’ can reasonably encompass\na ‘translator,’ ” the Court of Appeals reached the same\nconclusion. 633 F. 3d, at 1221. We disagree.\n   That a definition is broad enough to encompass one\nsense of a word does not establish that the word is ordi­\nnarily understood in that sense. See Mallard v. United\nStates Dist. Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa, 490 U. S.\n\n——————\n  2 A handful of other contemporaneous dictionaries used a similar\n\nformulation. See Funk & Wagnalls New Comprehensive International\nDictionary of the English Language 665 (1977) (“One who interprets or\ntranslates; specifically, one who serves as oral translator between\npeople speaking different languages”); 1 World Book Dictionary 1103\n(C. Barnhart & R. Barnhart eds. 1977) (“a person whose business is\ntranslating, especially orally, from a foreign language”); Cassell’s\nEnglish Dictionary 617 (4th ed. 1969) (“One who interprets, esp. one\nemployed to translate orally to persons speaking a foreign language”).\n8         TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n296, 301 (1989) (relying on the “most common meaning”\nand the “ordinary and natural signification” of the word\n“request,” even though it may sometimes “double for ‘de-\nmand’ or ‘command’ ”). The fact that the definition of\n“interpreter” in Webster’s Third has a sense divider denot-\ning the most common usage suggests that other usages,\nalthough acceptable, might not be common or ordinary. It\nis telling that all the dictionaries cited above defined\n“interpreter” at the time of the statute’s enactment as\nincluding persons who translate orally, but only a handful\ndefined the word broadly enough to encompass translators\nof written material. See supra, at 5–7. Although the\nOxford English Dictionary, one of the most authoritative\non the English language, recognized that “interpreter” can\nmean one who translates writings, it expressly designated\nthat meaning as obsolete. See supra, at 6. Were the\nmeaning of “interpreter” that respondent advocates truly\ncommon or ordinary, we would expect to see more support\nfor that meaning. We certainly would not expect to see it\ndesignated as obsolete in the Oxford English Dictionary.\nAny definition of a word that is absent from many diction-\naries and is deemed obsolete in others is hardly a common\nor ordinary meaning.\n  Based on our survey of the relevant dictionaries, we\nconclude that the ordinary or common meaning of “inter-\npreter” does not include those who translate writings.\nInstead, we find that an interpreter is normally under-\nstood as one who translates orally from one language to\nanother. This sense of the word is far more natural. As\nthe Seventh Circuit put it: “Robert Fagles made famous\ntranslations into English of the Iliad, the Odyssey, and the\nAeneid, but no one would refer to him as an English-\nlanguage ‘interpreter’ of these works.” Extra Equipamen­\ntos E Exportação Ltda. v.

Nothing in the Court Interpreters Act or in §1920,\nhowever, even hints that Congress intended to go beyond\nthe ordinary meaning of “interpreter” and to embrace the\nbroadest possible meaning that the definition of the word\ncan bear.\n   If anything, the statutory context suggests the opposite:\nthat the word “interpreter” applies only to those who\ntranslate orally. As previously mentioned, Congress en-\nacted §1920(6) as part of the Court Interpreters Act.\nThe main provision of that Act is §2(a), codified in 28\nU. S. C. §§1827 and 1828. See 92 Stat. 2040–2042. Par-\nticularly relevant here is §1827. As it now reads, that\nstatute provides for the establishment of “a program to\nfacilitate the use of certified and otherwise qualified inter-\npreters in judicial proceedings instituted by the United\nStates.” §1827(a). Subsection (d) directs courts to use an\ninterpreter in any criminal or civil action instituted by the\nUnited States if a party or witness “speaks only or primar-\nily a language other than the English language” or “suffers\nfrom a hearing impairment” “so as to inhibit such party’s\ncomprehension of the proceedings or communication with\ncounsel or the presiding judicial officer, or so as to inhibit\nsuch witness’ comprehension of questions and the presen-\ntation of such testimony.” §1827(d)(1).3 As originally\nenacted, subsection (k) mandated that the “interpretation\nprovided by certified interpreters . . . shall be in the con-\nsecutive mode except that the presiding judicial officer . . .\nmay authorize a simultaneous or summary interpreta-\ntion.” §1827(k) (1976 ed., Supp. II); see also 92 Stat. 2042.\n——————\n   3 This provision remains substantially the same as it appeared when\n\nfirst enacted. See 28 U. S. C. §1827(d)(1) (1976 ed., Supp. II); see also\n92 Stat. 2040.\n10           TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nIn its current form, subsection (k) provides that interpre-\ntation “shall be in the simultaneous mode for any party . . .\nand in the consecutive mode for witnesses,” unless the\ncourt directs otherwise. The simultaneous, consecutive,\nand summary modes are all methods of oral interpretation\nand have nothing to do with the translation of writings.4\nTaken together, these provisions are a strong contextual\nclue that Congress was dealing only with oral translation\nin the Court Interpreters Act and that it intended to use\nthe term “interpreter” throughout the Act in its ordinary\nsense as someone who translates the spoken word. As we\nhave said before, it is a “ ‘normal rule of statutory con-\nstruction’ that ‘identical words used in different parts of\nthe same act are intended to have the same meaning.’ ”\nGustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 570 (1995) (quoting\nDepartment of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc., 510\nU. S. 332, 342 (1994)).5\n  The references to technical terminology in the Court\nInterpreters Act further suggest that Congress used “in-\n——————\n   4 The simultaneous mode requires the interpreter “to interpret and to\n\nspeak contemporaneously with the individual whose communication is\nbeing translated.” H. R. Rep. No. 95–1687, p. 8 (1978). The consecutive\nmode requires the speaker whose communication is being translated to\npause so that the interpreter can “convey the testimony given.” Ibid.\nAnd the summary mode “allow[s] the interpreter to condense and distill\nthe speech of the speaker.” Ibid.; see generally Zazueta, Attorneys\nGuide to the Use of Court Interpreters, 8 U. C. D. L. Rev. 471, 477–478\n(1975).\n   5 The dissent agrees that context should help guide our analysis, but\n\ninstead of looking to the Court Interpreters Act, it looks to “the practice\nof federal courts both before and after §1920(6)’s enactment.” Post, at 4\n(opinion of GINSBURG, J.). The practice of federal courts after the Act’s\nenactment tells us nothing about what Congress intended at the time of\nenactment. And federal court practice before the Act under other\nprovisions of §1920 tells us little, if anything, about what Congress\nintended when it added subsection (6). We think the statutory context\nin which the word “interpreter” appears is a more reliable guide to its\nmeaning.\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

Brislin ed. 1976) (explaining that when\nboth terms are used together, translation “refers to the\nprocessing [of] written input, and interpretation to the\nprocessing of oral input” (emphasis deleted)); J. Herbert,\nInterpreter’s Handbook 1 (2d ed. 1952) (“In the present-\nday jargon of international organisations, the words trans-\nlate, translations, translator are used when the immediate\nresult of the work is a written text; and the words inter-\npret, interpreter, interpretation when it is a speech deliv-\nered orally”). That Congress specified “interpreters” but\nnot “translators” is yet another signal that it intended to\nlimit §1920(6) to the costs of oral, instead of written,\ntranslation.6\n   In sum, both the ordinary and technical meanings of\n“interpreter,” as well as the statutory context in which the\nword is found, lead to the conclusion that §1920(6) does\nnot apply to translators of written materials.7\n——————\n  6 Some   provisions within the United States Code use both “inter-\npreter” and “translator” together, thus implying that Congress under-\nstands the terms to have the distinct meanings described above. See,\ne.g., 8 U. S. C. §1555(b) (providing that appropriations for the Immigra-\ntion and Naturalization Service “shall be available for payment of . . .\ninterpreters and translators who are not citizens of the United States”);\n28 U. S. C. §530C(b)(1)(I) (providing that Department of Justice funds\nmay be used for “[p]ayment of interpreters and translators who are not\ncitizens of the United States”).\n   7 Our conclusion is buttressed by respondent’s concession at oral ar-\n\ngument that there is no provision in the United States Code where it is\n12          TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n                             C\n   No other rule of construction compels us to depart from\nthe ordinary meaning of “interpreter.” The Court of Ap-\npeals reasoned that a broader meaning is “more compat-\nible with Rule 54 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\nwhich includes a decided preference for the award of costs\nto the prevailing party.” 633 F. 3d, at 1221. But we have\nnever held that Rule 54(d) creates a presumption of statu-\ntory construction in favor of the broadest possible reading\nof the costs enumerated in §1920. To the contrary, we\nhave made clear that the “discretion granted by Rule 54(d)\nis not a power to evade” the specific categories of costs set\nforth by Congress. Crawford Fitting, 482 U. S., at 442.\n“Rather,” we have said, “it is solely a power to decline to\ntax, as costs, the items enumerated in §1920.” Ibid. Rule\n54(d) thus provides no sound basis for casting aside the\nordinary meaning of the various items enumerated in\nthe costs statute, including the ordinary meaning of\n“interpreter.”\n   Our decision is in keeping with the narrow scope of\ntaxable costs. “Although ‘costs’ has an everyday meaning\nsynonymous with ‘expenses,’ the concept of taxable costs\nunder Rule 54(d) is more limited and represents those\nexpenses, including, for example, court fees, that a court\nwill assess against a litigant.” 10 C. Wright, A. Miller, &\nM. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure §2666, pp. 202–\n203 (3d ed. 1998) (hereinafter Wright & Miller). Taxable\ncosts are limited to relatively minor, incidental expenses\nas is evident from §1920, which lists such items as clerk\n——————\nclear that the word extends to those who translate documents. Tr. of\nOral Arg. 39; see also Brief for Petitioner 32 (“And the Code is wholly\ndevoid of any corresponding definition of ‘interpreter’ extending to the\ntranslation of written documents”). As respondent acknowledged,\neither the word is used in a context that strongly suggests it applies\nonly to oral translation or its meaning is unclear. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 38.\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

In-\ndeed, “the assessment of costs most often is merely a\nclerical matter that can be done by the court clerk.” Hair­\nline Creations, Inc. v. Kefalas, 664 F. 2d 652, 656 (CA7\n1981). Taxable costs are a fraction of the nontaxable\nexpenses borne by litigants for attorneys, experts, consult-\nants, and investigators. It comes as little surprise, there-\nfore, that “costs almost always amount to less than the\nsuccessful litigant’s total expenses in connection with a\nlawsuit.” 10 Wright & Miller §2666, at 203. Because\ntaxable costs are limited by statute and are modest in\nscope, we see no compelling reason to stretch the ordinary\nmeaning of the cost items Congress authorized in §1920.\n   As for respondent’s extratextual arguments, they are\nmore properly directed at Congress. Respondent contends\nthat documentary evidence is no less important than\ntestimonial evidence and that it would be anomalous to\nrequire the losing party to cover translation costs for\nspoken words but not for written words. Brief for Re-\nspondent 20. Respondent also observes that some transla-\ntion tasks are not entirely oral or entirely written. Id., at\n20–24. One task, called “ ‘sight translation,’ ” involves the\noral translation of a document. Id., at 21. Another task\ninvolves the written translation of speech. Ibid. And a\nthird task, called “ ‘document comparison,’ ” involves com-\nparing documents in the source and target language to\nverify that the two are identical. Id., at 21–22. Respond-\nent argues that a narrow definition cannot account for\nthese variations and that a bright-line definition of “inter-\npreter” as someone who translates spoken and written\nwords would avoid complication and provide a simple,\nadministrable rule for district courts.\n   Neither of these arguments convinces us that Congress\nmust have intended to dispense with the ordinary mean-\n14          TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ning of “interpreter” in §1920(6). First, Congress might\nhave distinguished between oral and written translation\nout of a concern that requiring losing parties to bear\nthe potentially sizable costs of translating discovery docu-\nments, as opposed to the more limited costs of oral tes-\ntimony, could be too burdensome and possibly unfair,\nespecially for litigants with limited means. Cf. Fleischmann\nDistilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., 386 U. S. 714, 718\n(1967) (noting the argument “that since litigation is at\nbest uncertain one should not be penalized for merely\ndefending or prosecuting a lawsuit, and that the poor\nmight be unjustly discouraged from instituting actions to\nvindicate their rights if the penalty for losing included the\nfees of their opponents’ counsel”). Congress might also\nhave concluded that a document translator is more akin to\nan expert or consultant retained by a party to decipher\ndocumentary evidence—like, for instance, a forensic ac-\ncountant—than to an interpreter whose real-time oral\ntranslation services are necessary for communication\nbetween litigants, witnesses, and the court.8\n  Second, respondent has not shown that any of the hy-\nbrid translation/interpretation tasks to which it points\nactually arise with overwhelming frequency or that the\nproblem of drawing the line between taxable and nontax-\nable costs in such cases will vex the trial courts. It cer-\ntainly has not shown that any such problems will be more\ntroublesome than the task of sifting through translated\n——————\n  8 The dissent contends that document translation, no less than oral\n\ntranslation, is essential “to equip the parties to present their case\nclearly and the court to decide the merits intelligently.” Post, at 5. But\na document translator is no more important than an expert or consult-\nant in making sense of otherwise incomprehensible documentary\nevidence, yet expenses for experts and consultants are generally not\ntaxable as costs. To be sure, forgoing document translation can impair\na litigant’s case, but document translation is not indispensable, in the\nway oral translation is, to the parties’ ability to communicate with each\nother, with witnesses, and with the court.\n                 Cite as: 566 U.

Congress therefore provided, in 28\nU. S. C. §1920(6), that the prevailing party may recoup\ncompensation paid to “interpreters.” The word “interpret­\ners,” the Court emphasizes, commonly refers to translators\nof oral speech. Ante, at 5–6. But as the Court acknowl­\nedges, ante, at 7, and n. 2, “interpreters” is more than\noccasionally used to encompass those who translate writ­\nten speech as well. See Webster’s Third New International\nDictionary of the English Language 1182 (1976) (here-\ninafter Webster’s) (defining “interpreter” as “one that\ntranslates; esp: a person who translates orally for parties\nconversing in different tongues”); Black’s Law Dictionary\n895 (9th ed. 2009) (defining “interpreter” as a “person who\ntranslates, esp. orally, from one language to another”);\nBallentine’s Law Dictionary 655 (3d ed. 1969) (defining\n“interpreter” as “[o]ne who interprets, particularly one\nwho interprets words written or spoken in a foreign\nlanguage”).\n  In short, employing the word “interpreters” to include\ntranslators of written as well as oral speech, if not “the\nmost common usage,” ante, at 8, is at least an “acceptable”\n2         TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nusage, ibid. Moreover, the word “interpret” is generally\nunderstood to mean “to explain or tell the meaning of:\ntranslate into intelligible or familiar language or terms,”\nwhile “translate” commonly means “to turn into one’s own\nor another language.” Webster’s 1182, 2429. See also\nRandom House Dictionary of the English Language 744,\n1505 (1973) (defining the transitive verb “interpret” as,\ninter alia, “to translate,” and “translate” as “to turn (some­\nthing written or spoken) from one language into another”).\n   Notably, several federal district court decisions refer to\ntranslators of written documents as “interpreters.” E.g.,\nUnited States v.

Before the Court Inter­\npreters Act added §1920(6) to the taxation of costs statute\nin 1978, district courts awarded costs for document trans­\nlation under §1920(4), which allowed taxation of “[f ]ees for\nexemplification and copies of papers,” 28 U.

Post-1978, rulings awarding document transla­\ntion costs under §1920(6) indicate the courts’ understand­\ning both that the term “interpreter” can readily encompass\noral and written translation, and that Congress did not\notherwise instruct.2 I agree that context should guide the\ndetermination whether §1920(b) is most sensibly read to\nencompass persons who translate documents. See ante, at\n8–9.

Documen­\ntary evidence in a foreign language, no less than oral\nstatements, must be translated to equip the parties to\npresent their case clearly and the court to decide the\nmerits intelligently. See, e.g., United States v. Mosquera,\n816 F. Supp. 168, 175 (EDNY 1993) (“For a non-English\nspeaking [party] to stand equal with others before the\ncourt requires translation [of relevant documents].”);\nLockett v. Hellenic Sea Transports, Ltd., 60 F. R. D. 469,\n473 (ED Pa. 1973) (“To be understood by counsel for plain­\ntiffs and defendant, as well as for use at trial, the [ship’s]\ndeck log had to be translated [from Greek] into the Eng­\nlish language.”).3 And it is not extraordinary that what\ndocuments say, more than what witnesses testify, may\nmake or break a case.\n   Distinguishing written from oral translation for cost­\naward purposes, moreover, is an endeavor all the more\ndubious, for, as the Court acknowledges, ante, at 13, some\ntranslation tasks do not fall neatly into one category or\nthe other. An interpreter, for example, may be called upon\nto “sight translate” a written document, i.e., to convey a\nwritten foreign-language document’s content orally in\nEnglish. R. González, V. Vásquez, & H. Mikkelson, Fun­\ndamentals of Court Interpretation: Theory, Policy and\nPractice 401 (1991) (hereinafter González).

Nothing indicates that Congress intended paragraph (6),\nunlike paragraphs (2)–(4), to apply exclusively to oral communications.\n6            TANIGUCHI v.

But if the interpreter\nthen reads the prepared written translation aloud in\ncourt, that task, in Taniguchi’s view, can be charged as\n“interpretation,” id., at 11, even though the reading in­\nvolves no translation of foreign-language expression—\nwritten or oral—at all.\n   Similarly hard to categorize is the common court­\ninterpreter task of listening to a recording in a foreign\nlanguage, transcribing it, then translating it into Eng-\nlish. See González 439. Although this task involves oral\nforeign-language communication, it does not, Taniguchi\ncontends, qualify as “interpretation,” because it involves\n“the luxury of multiple playbacks of the tape and the\nleisure to consult extrinsic linguistic sources.” Reply Brief\nfor Petitioner 9 (internal quotation marks omitted). But\nsight translation—which Taniguchi concedes may be\ncharged as “interpretation”—may sometimes involve sim­\nilarly careful linguistic analysis of a written document\nin advance of a court proceeding.

The tab for unquestionably\nallowable costs, however, may run high.

See Eastman Kodak Co.,\n713 F. 2d, at 133 (district court should not award docu­\nment translation costs “carte blanche,” but must deter­\nmine whether such costs were necessarily incurred). See\nalso, e.g., Conn v.

Courts of appeals, in turn, are capable of\nreviewing such judgments for abuse of discretion.\n   In short, §1920(6)’s prescription on “interpreters” is not\nso clear as to leave no room for interpretation. Given the\npurpose served by translation and the practice prevailing\nin district courts, supra, at 3, there is no good reason to\nexclude from taxable costs payments for placing written\nwords within the grasp of parties, jurors, and judges. I\nwould therefore affirm the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.\n\n\n\n\n—————— \n\nspondent 26–27, n. 12 (listing, inter alia, 21 translation cost awards of\n\nless than $13,000, of which at least fourteen were less than $3,000).\n\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/800569/", "sha1": "6010fd2226c27c69b63d6731936bc26e975f0281", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2012-05-21T07:28:36"}
