Argued April 23, 2012—Decided May 29, 2012\nTo finance the purchase of a commercial property and associated reno-\n  vation and construction costs, petitioners (debtors) obtained a se-\n  cured loan from an investment fund, for which respondent (Bank)\n  serves as trustee. The debtors ultimately became insolvent, and\n  sought relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Pursuant\n  to 11 U. S. C. §1129(b)(2)(A), the debtors sought to confirm a\n  “cramdown” bankruptcy plan over the Bank’s objection. That plan\n  proposed selling substantially all of the debtors’ property at an auc-\n  tion, and using the sale proceeds to repay the Bank. Under the debt-\n  ors’ proposed auction procedures, the Bank would not be permitted to\n  bid for the property using the debt it is owed to offset the purchase\n  price, a practice known as “credit-bidding.” The Bankruptcy Court\n  denied the debtors’ request, concluding that the auction procedures\n  did not comply with §1129(b)(2)(A)’s requirements for cramdown\n  plans. The Seventh Circuit affirmed, holding that §1129(b)(2)(A)\n  does not permit debtors to sell an encumbered asset free and clear of\n  a lien without permitting the lienholder to credit-bid.\nHeld: The debtors may not obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11\n cramdown plan that provides for the sale of collateral free and clear\n of the Bank’s lien, but does not permit the Bank to credit-bid at the\n sale. Pp. 3–10.\n    (a) A Chapter 11 plan proposed over the objection of a “class of se-\n cured claims” must meet one of three requirements in order to be\n deemed “fair and equitable,” and therefore confirmable. The secured\n creditor may retain its lien on the property and receive deferred cash\n payments, §1129(b)(2)(A)(i); the debtors may sell the property free\n and clear of the lien, “subject to section 363(k)”—which permits the\n2    RADLAX GATEWAY HOTEL, LLC v.

Because the debtors’ auction procedures do\n    not permit the Bank to credit-bid, however, the proposed sale cannot\n    satisfy the requirements of clause (ii). The debtors claim their plan\n    can instead satisfy clause (iii) by providing the Bank with the “indu-\n    bitable equivalent” of its secured claim, in the form of cash generated\n    by the auction.\n       The debtors’ reading of §1129(b)(2)(A), under which clause (iii)\n    permits precisely what clause (ii) proscribes, is hyperliteral and con-\n    trary to common sense. “[I]t is a commonplace of statutory construc-\n    tion that the specific governs the general.” Morales v. Trans World\n    Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 384. Here, where general and specific\n    authorizations exist side-by-side, the general/specific canon avoids\n    rendering superfluous a specific provision that is swallowed by the\n    general one. See D. Ginsberg & Sons, Inc. v. Popkin, 285 U. S. 204,\n    208. As applied to §1129(b)(2)(A), the canon provides that the “gen-\n    eral language” of clause (iii), “although broad enough to include it,\n    will not be held to apply to a matter specifically dealt with” in clause\n    (ii). 285 U. S., at 208. Although the canon can be overcome by other\n    textual indications of statutory meaning, the debtors point to none\n    here.

S. C. §1129(b)(2)(A) if the plan provides\nfor the sale of collateral free and clear of the creditor’s lien,\nbut does not permit the creditor to “credit-bid” at the sale.\n                              I\n  In 2007, petitioners RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC, and\nRadLAX Gateway Deck, LLC (hereinafter debtors), pur-\nchased the Radisson Hotel at Los Angeles International\nAirport, together with an adjacent lot on which the debtors\nplanned to build a parking structure. To finance the\npurchase, the renovation of the hotel, and construction of\nthe parking structure, the debtors obtained a $142 million\nloan from Longview Ultra Construction Loan Investment\nFund, for which respondent Amalgamated Bank (hereinaf-\nter creditor or Bank) serves as trustee. The lenders ob-\ntained a blanket lien on all of the debtors’ assets to secure\nthe loan.\n  Completing the parking structure proved more expen-\nsive than anticipated, and within two years the debtors\n2   RADLAX GATEWAY HOTEL, LLC v. AMALGAMATED BANK \n\n\n                          Opinion of the Court \n\n\nhad run out of funds and were forced to halt construction.\nBy August 2009, they owed more than $120 million on the\nloan, with over $1 million in interest accruing every month\nand no prospect for obtaining additional funds to complete\nthe project. Both debtors filed voluntary petitions for\nrelief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   A Chapter 11 bankruptcy is implemented according to\na “plan,” typically proposed by the debtor, which divides\nclaims against the debtor into separate “classes” and\nspecifies the treatment each class will receive. See 11\nU. S. C. §1123. Generally, a bankruptcy court may con-\nfirm a Chapter 11 plan only if each class of creditors af-\nfected by the plan consents. See §1129(a)(8). Section\n1129(b) creates an exception to that general rule, per-\nmitting confirmation of nonconsensual plans—commonly\nknown as “cramdown” plans—if “the plan does not dis-\ncriminate unfairly, and is fair and equitable, with respect\nto each class of claims or interests that is impaired under,\nand has not accepted, the plan.” Section 1129(b)(2)(A),\nwhich we review in further depth below, establishes crite-\nria for determining whether a cramdown plan is “fair and\nequitable” with respect to secured claims like the Bank’s.\n   In 2010, the RadLAX debtors submitted a Chapter 11\nplan to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the\nNorthern District of Illinois. The plan proposed to dissolve\nthe debtors and to sell substantially all of their assets\npursuant to procedures set out in a contemporaneously\nfiled “Sale and Bid Procedures Motion.” Specifically, the\ndebtors sought to auction their assets to the highest bid-\nder, with the initial bid submitted by a “stalking horse”—a\npotential purchaser who was willing to make an advance\nbid of $47.5 million.1 The sale proceeds would be used to\nfund the plan, primarily by repaying the Bank. Of course\n——————\n  1 In a later proposal, the stalking-horse bid increased to $55 million.\n\nThe precise amount of the bid is not relevant here.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Bank itself might wish to obtain the property if\nthe alternative would be receiving auction proceeds that\nfall short of the property’s full value. Under the debtors’\nproposed auction procedures, however, the Bank would\nnot be permitted to bid for the property using the debt it is\nowed to offset the purchase price, a practice known as\n“credit-bidding.” Instead, the Bank would be forced to bid\ncash. Correctly anticipating that the Bank would object to\nthis arrangement, the debtors sought to confirm their plan\nunder the cramdown provisions of §1129(b)(2)(A).\n  The Bankruptcy Court denied the debtors’ Sale and Bid\nProcedures Motion, concluding that the proposed auction\nprocedures did not comply with §1129(b)(2)(A)’s require-\nments for cramdown plans. In re River Road Hotel Part-\nners, LLC, Case No. 09 B 30029 (ND Ill., Oct. 5, 2010),\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 40a. The Bankruptcy Court certified\nan appeal directly to the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Seventh Circuit. That court accepted the certifi-\ncation and affirmed, holding that §1129(b)(2)(A) does not\npermit debtors to sell an encumbered asset free and clear\nof a lien without permitting the lienholder to credit-bid.\nRiver Road Hotel Partners, LLC, et al. v. Amalgamated\nBank, 651 F. 3d 642 (2011). We granted certiorari. 565\nU.

The plan\nmust provide:\n       “(i)(I) that the holders of such claims retain the\n    liens securing such claims, whether the property sub-\n    ject to such liens is retained by the debtor or trans-\n    ferred to another entity, to the extent of the allowed\n4    RADLAX GATEWAY HOTEL, LLC v. AMALGAMATED BANK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n       amount of such claims; and (II) that each holder of a\n       claim of such class receive on account of such claim\n       deferred cash payments totaling at least the allowed\n       amount of such claim, of a value, as of the effective\n       date of the plan, of at least the value of such holder’s\n       interest in the estate’s interest in such property;\n          “(ii) for the sale, subject to section 363(k) of this ti-\n       tle, of any property that is subject to the liens secur-\n       ing such claims, free and clear of such liens, with such\n       liens to attach to the proceeds of such sale, and the\n       treatment of such liens on proceeds under clause (i) or\n       (iii) of this subparagraph; or\n          “(iii) for the realization by such holders of the\n       indubitable equivalent of such claims.” 11 U. S. C.\n       §1129(b)(2)(A).\nUnder clause (i), the secured creditor retains its lien on\nthe property and receives deferred cash payments. Under\nclause (ii), the property is sold free and clear of the lien,\n“subject to section 363(k),” and the creditor receives a lien\non the proceeds of the sale. Section 363(k), in turn, pro-\nvides that “unless the court for cause orders otherwise\nthe holder of such claim may bid at such sale, and, if the\nholder of such claim purchases such property, such holder\nmay offset such claim against the purchase price of such\nproperty”—i.e., the creditor may credit-bid at the sale, up\nto the amount of its claim.2 Finally, under clause (iii), the\nplan provides the secured creditor with the “indubitable\nequivalent” of its claim.\n——————\n    2 The\n        ability to credit-bid helps to protect a creditor against the risk\nthat its collateral will be sold at a depressed price. It enables the\ncreditor to purchase the collateral for what it considers the fair market\nprice (up to the amount of its security interest) without committing\nadditional cash to protect the loan. That right is particularly important\nfor the Federal Government, which is frequently a secured creditor in\nbankruptcy and which often lacks appropriations authority to throw\ngood money after bad in a cash-only bankruptcy auction.\n                    Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                  5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n  The debtors in this case have proposed to sell their\nproperty free and clear of the Bank’s liens, and to repay\nthe Bank using the sale proceeds—precisely, it would\nseem, the disposition contemplated by clause (ii). Yet\nsince the debtors’ proposed auction procedures do not\npermit the Bank to credit-bid, the proposed sale cannot\nsatisfy the requirements of clause (ii).3 Recognizing this\nproblem, the debtors instead seek plan confirmation pur-\nsuant to clause (iii), which—unlike clause (ii)—does not\nexpressly foreclose the possibility of a sale without credit-\nbidding. According to the debtors, their plan can satisfy\nclause (iii) by ultimately providing the Bank with the\n“indubitable equivalent” of its secured claim, in the form of\ncash generated by the auction.\n  We find the debtors’ reading of §1129(b)(2)(A)—under\nwhich clause (iii) permits precisely what clause (ii) pro-\nscribes—to be hyperliteral and contrary to common sense.\nA well established canon of statutory interpretation suc-\ncinctly captures the problem: “[I]t is a commonplace of\nstatutory construction that the specific governs the gen-\neral.” Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S.\n374, 384 (1992). That is particularly true where, as in\n§1129(b)(2)(A), “Congress has enacted a comprehensive\nscheme and has deliberately targeted specific problems\nwith specific solutions.” Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U. S.\n489, 519 (1996) (THOMAS, J., dissenting); see also HCSC-\nLaundry v. United States, 450 U. S. 1, 6 (1981) (per\ncuriam) (the specific governs the general “particularly\nwhen the two are interrelated and closely positioned,\nboth in fact being parts of [the same statutory scheme]”).\n  The general/specific canon is perhaps most frequently\n——————\n  3 Title 11 U. S. C. §363(k)—and by extension clause (ii)—provides an\n\nexception to the credit-bidding requirement if “the court for cause\norders otherwise.” The Bankruptcy Court found that there was no\n“cause” to deny credit-bidding in this case, and the debtors have not\nappealed that disposition.\n6   RADLAX GATEWAY HOTEL, LLC v. AMALGAMATED BANK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\napplied to statutes in which a general permission or pro-\nhibition is contradicted by a specific prohibition or permis-\nsion. To eliminate the contradiction, the specific provision\nis construed as an exception to the general one. See, e.g.,\nMorton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535, 550–551 (1974). But\nthe canon has full application as well to statutes such as\nthe one here, in which a general authorization and a more\nlimited, specific authorization exist side-by-side. There\nthe canon avoids not contradiction but the superfluity of\na specific provision that is swallowed by the general one,\n“violat[ing] the cardinal rule that, if possible, effect shall\nbe given to every clause and part of a statute.” D. Gins-\nberg & Sons, Inc. v. Popkin, 285 U. S. 204, 208 (1932).\nThe terms of the specific authorization must be complied\nwith. For example, in the last cited case a provision of the\nBankruptcy Act prescribed in great detail the procedures\ngoverning the arrest and detention of bankrupts about\nto leave the district in order to avoid examination. The\nCourt held that those prescriptions could not be avoided\nby relying upon a general provision of the Act authoriz-\ning bankruptcy courts to “ ‘make such orders, issue such\nprocess, and enter such judgments in addition to those spe-\ncifically provided for as may be necessary for the enforce-\nment of the provisions of [the] Act.’ ” Id., at 206 (quoting\nBankruptcy Act of 1898, §2(15), 30 Stat. 546). The Court\nsaid that “[g]eneral language of a statutory provision,\nalthough broad enough to include it, will not be held to\napply to a matter specifically dealt with in another part\nof the same enactment.” 285 U. S., at 208. We recently\nquoted that language approvingly in Bloate v. United\nStates, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 10). Or as we\nsaid in a much earlier case:\n    “It is an old and familiar rule that, where there is, in\n    the same statute, a particular enactment, and also a\n    general one, which, in its most comprehensive sense,\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    would include what is embraced in the former, the\n    particular enactment must be operative, and the gen-\n    eral enactment must be taken to affect only such cases\n    within its general language as are not within the pro-\n    visions of the particular enactment. This rule applies\n    wherever an act contains general provisions and also\n    special ones upon a subject, which, standing alone, the\n    general provisions would include.” United States v.\n    Chase, 135 U. S. 255, 260 (1890) (citations and inter-\n    nal quotation marks omitted).\nHere, clause (ii) is a detailed provision that spells out\nthe requirements for selling collateral free of liens, while\nclause (iii) is a broadly worded provision that says nothing\nabout such a sale. The general/specific canon explains\nthat the “general language” of clause (iii), “although broad\nenough to include it, will not be held to apply to a matter\nspecifically dealt with” in clause (ii). D. Ginsberg & Sons,\nInc., supra, at 208.\n  Of course the general/specific canon is not an absolute\nrule, but is merely a strong indication of statutory mean-\ning that can be overcome by textual indications that point\nin the other direction. The debtors point to no such indi-\ncation here. One can conceive of a statutory scheme in\nwhich the specific provision embraced within a general\none is not superfluous, because it creates a so-called safe\nharbor. The debtors effectively contend that that is the\ncase here—clause (iii) (“indubitable equivalent”) being the\ngeneral rule, and clauses (i) and (ii) setting forth proce-\ndures that will always, ipso facto, establish an “indubita-\nble equivalent,” with no need for judicial evaluation. But\nthe structure here would be a surpassingly strange man-\nner of accomplishing that result—which would normally\nbe achieved by setting forth the “indubitable equivalent”\nrule first (rather than last), and establishing the two safe\nharbors as provisos to that rule. The structure here sug-\n8   RADLAX GATEWAY HOTEL, LLC v. AMALGAMATED BANK \n\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\ngests, to the contrary, that (i) is the rule for plans under\nwhich the creditor’s lien remains on the property, (ii) is\nthe rule for plans under which the property is sold free\nand clear of the creditor’s lien, and (iii) is a residual provi-\nsion covering dispositions under all other plans—for ex-\nample, one under which the creditor receives the property\nitself, the “indubitable equivalent” of its secured claim.\nThus, debtors may not sell their property free of liens\nunder §1129(b)(2)(A) without allowing lienholders to\ncredit-bid, as required by clause (ii).\n                              B\n   None of the debtors’ objections to this approach is valid.\n   The debtors’ principal textual argument is that\n§1129(b)(2)(A) “unambiguously provides three distinct\noptions for confirming a Chapter 11 plan over the objec-\ntion of a secured creditor.” Brief for Petitioners 15 (capi-\ntalization and bold typeface removed). With that much we\nagree; the three clauses of §1129(b)(2)(A) are connected by\nthe disjunctive “or.” The debtors contend that our inter-\npretation of §1129(b)(2)(A) “transforms ‘or’ into ‘and.’ ”\nReply Brief for Petitioners 3. But that is not so. The\nquestion here is not whether debtors must comply with\nmore than one clause, but rather which one of the three\nthey must satisfy. Debtors seeking to sell their property\nfree of liens under §1129(b)(2)(A) must satisfy the re-\nquirements of clause (ii), not the requirements of both\nclauses (ii) and (iii).\n   The debtors make several arguments against applying\nthe general/specific canon. They contend that clause (ii)\nis no more specific than clause (iii), because the former\nprovides a procedural protection to secured creditors\n(credit-bidding) while the latter provides a substantive\nprotection (indubitable equivalence). As a result, they say,\nclause (ii) is not “a limiting subset” of clause (iii), which\n(according to their view) application of the general/specific\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

To begin with, we know of no authori-\nty for the proposition that the canon is confined to situa-\ntions in which the entirety of the specific provision is a\n“subset” of the general one. When the conduct at issue\nfalls within the scope of both provisions, the specific pre-\nsumptively governs, whether or not the specific provision\nalso applies to some conduct that falls outside the general.\nIn any case, we think clause (ii) is entirely a subset.\nClause (iii) applies to all cramdown plans, which include\nall of the plans within the more narrow category described\nin clause (ii).4 That its requirements are “substantive”\nwhereas clause (ii)’s are “procedural” is quite beside the\npoint. What counts for application of the general/specific\ncanon is not the nature of the provisions’ prescriptions but\ntheir scope.\n   Finally, the debtors contend that the Court of Appeals\nconflated approval of bid procedures with plan confirma-\ntion. Brief for Petitioners 39. They claim the right to\npursue their auction now, leaving it for the Bankruptcy\nJudge to determine, at the confirmation stage, whether\nthe resulting plan (funded by auction proceeds) provides\nthe Bank with the “indubitable equivalent” of its secured\nclaim. Under our interpretation of §1129(b)(2)(A), how-\never, that approach is simply a nonstarter. As a matter of\nlaw, no bid procedures like the ones proposed here could\nsatisfy the requirements of §1129(b)(2)(A), and the distinc-\ntion between approval of bid procedures and plan confir-\nmation is therefore irrelevant.\n\n\n——————\n  4 We are speaking here about whether clause (ii) is a subset for pur-\n\nposes of determining whether the canon applies. As we have described\nearlier, after applying the canon—ex post, so to speak—it ceases to be a\nsubset, governing a situation to which clause (iii) will no longer be\ndeemed applicable.\n10 RADLAX GATEWAY HOTEL, LLC v.

But\nnothing in the generalized statutory purpose of protecting\nsecured creditors can overcome the specific manner of that\nprotection which the text of §1129(b)(2)(A) contains. As\nfor pre-Code practices, they can be relevant to the inter-\npretation of an ambiguous text, but we find no textual\nambiguity here. And the pros and cons of credit-bidding\nare for the consideration of Congress, not the courts.\n  The Bankruptcy Code standardizes an expansive (and\nsometimes unruly) area of law, and it is our obligation to\ninterpret the Code clearly and predictably using well\nestablished principles of statutory construction.          See\nUnited States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235,\n240–241 (1989). Under that approach, this is an easy case.\nBecause the RadLAX debtors may not obtain confirmation\nof a Chapter 11 cramdown plan that provides for the sale\nof collateral free and clear of the Bank’s lien, but does not\npermit the Bank to credit-bid at the sale, we affirm the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY took no part in the decision of this\ncase.\n</pre>", "id": 801109, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2012/05/29/radlax_gateway_hotel_llc_v._amalgamated_bank.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2011                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued April 23, 2012—Decided May 29, 2012\nTo finance the purchase of a commercial property and associated reno-\n  vation and construction costs, petitioners (debtors) obtained a se-\n  cured loan from an investment fund, for which respondent (Bank)\n  serves as trustee. The debtors ultimately became insolvent, and\n  sought relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Pursuant\n  to 11 U. S. C. §1129(b)(2)(A), the debtors sought to confirm a\n  “cramdown” bankruptcy plan over the Bank’s objection. That plan\n  proposed selling substantially all of the debtors’ property at an auc-\n  tion, and using the sale proceeds to repay the Bank. Under the debt-\n  ors’ proposed auction procedures, the Bank would not be permitted to\n  bid for the property using the debt it is owed to offset the purchase\n  price, a practice known as “credit-bidding.” The Bankruptcy Court\n  denied the debtors’ request, concluding that the auction procedures\n  did not comply with §1129(b)(2)(A)’s requirements for cramdown\n  plans. The Seventh Circuit affirmed, holding that §1129(b)(2)(A)\n  does not permit debtors to sell an encumbered asset free and clear of\n  a lien without permitting the lienholder to credit-bid.\nHeld: The debtors may not obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11\n cramdown plan that provides for the sale of collateral free and clear\n of the Bank’s lien, but does not permit the Bank to credit-bid at the\n sale. Pp. 3–10.\n    (a) A Chapter 11 plan proposed over the objection of a “class of se-\n cured claims” must meet one of three requirements in order to be\n deemed “fair and equitable,” and therefore confirmable. The secured\n creditor may retain its lien on the property and receive deferred cash\n payments, §1129(b)(2)(A)(i); the debtors may sell the property free\n and clear of the lien, “subject to section 363(k)”—which permits the\n2    RADLAX GATEWAY HOTEL, LLC v.

Because the debtors’ auction procedures do\n    not permit the Bank to credit-bid, however, the proposed sale cannot\n    satisfy the requirements of clause (ii). The debtors claim their plan\n    can instead satisfy clause (iii) by providing the Bank with the “indu-\n    bitable equivalent” of its secured claim, in the form of cash generated\n    by the auction.\n       The debtors’ reading of §1129(b)(2)(A), under which clause (iii)\n    permits precisely what clause (ii) proscribes, is hyperliteral and con-\n    trary to common sense. “[I]t is a commonplace of statutory construc-\n    tion that the specific governs the general.” Morales v. Trans World\n    Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 384. Here, where general and specific\n    authorizations exist side-by-side, the general/specific canon avoids\n    rendering superfluous a specific provision that is swallowed by the\n    general one. See D. Ginsberg & Sons, Inc. v. Popkin, 285 U. S. 204,\n    208. As applied to §1129(b)(2)(A), the canon provides that the “gen-\n    eral language” of clause (iii), “although broad enough to include it,\n    will not be held to apply to a matter specifically dealt with” in clause\n    (ii). 285 U.

S. C. §1129(b)(2)(A) if the plan provides\nfor the sale of collateral free and clear of the creditor’s lien,\nbut does not permit the creditor to “credit-bid” at the sale.\n                              I\n  In 2007, petitioners RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC, and\nRadLAX Gateway Deck, LLC (hereinafter debtors), pur-\nchased the Radisson Hotel at Los Angeles International\nAirport, together with an adjacent lot on which the debtors\nplanned to build a parking structure. To finance the\npurchase, the renovation of the hotel, and construction of\nthe parking structure, the debtors obtained a $142 million\nloan from Longview Ultra Construction Loan Investment\nFund, for which respondent Amalgamated Bank (hereinaf-\nter creditor or Bank) serves as trustee. The lenders ob-\ntained a blanket lien on all of the debtors’ assets to secure\nthe loan.\n  Completing the parking structure proved more expen-\nsive than anticipated, and within two years the debtors\n2   RADLAX GATEWAY HOTEL, LLC v. AMALGAMATED BANK \n\n\n                          Opinion of the Court \n\n\nhad run out of funds and were forced to halt construction.\nBy August 2009, they owed more than $120 million on the\nloan, with over $1 million in interest accruing every month\nand no prospect for obtaining additional funds to complete\nthe project. Both debtors filed voluntary petitions for\nrelief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   A Chapter 11 bankruptcy is implemented according to\na “plan,” typically proposed by the debtor, which divides\nclaims against the debtor into separate “classes” and\nspecifies the treatment each class will receive. See 11\nU. S. C. §1123. Generally, a bankruptcy court may con-\nfirm a Chapter 11 plan only if each class of creditors af-\nfected by the plan consents. See §1129(a)(8). Section\n1129(b) creates an exception to that general rule, per-\nmitting confirmation of nonconsensual plans—commonly\nknown as “cramdown” plans—if “the plan does not dis-\ncriminate unfairly, and is fair and equitable, with respect\nto each class of claims or interests that is impaired under,\nand has not accepted, the plan.” Section 1129(b)(2)(A),\nwhich we review in further depth below, establishes crite-\nria for determining whether a cramdown plan is “fair and\nequitable” with respect to secured claims like the Bank’s.\n   In 2010, the RadLAX debtors submitted a Chapter 11\nplan to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the\nNorthern District of Illinois. The plan proposed to dissolve\nthe debtors and to sell substantially all of their assets\npursuant to procedures set out in a contemporaneously\nfiled “Sale and Bid Procedures Motion.” Specifically, the\ndebtors sought to auction their assets to the highest bid-\nder, with the initial bid submitted by a “stalking horse”—a\npotential purchaser who was willing to make an advance\nbid of $47.5 million.1 The sale proceeds would be used to\nfund the plan, primarily by repaying the Bank. Of course\n——————\n  1 In a later proposal, the stalking-horse bid increased to $55 million.\n\nThe precise amount of the bid is not relevant here.\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Bank itself might wish to obtain the property if\nthe alternative would be receiving auction proceeds that\nfall short of the property’s full value. Under the debtors’\nproposed auction procedures, however, the Bank would\nnot be permitted to bid for the property using the debt it is\nowed to offset the purchase price, a practice known as\n“credit-bidding.” Instead, the Bank would be forced to bid\ncash. Correctly anticipating that the Bank would object to\nthis arrangement, the debtors sought to confirm their plan\nunder the cramdown provisions of §1129(b)(2)(A).\n  The Bankruptcy Court denied the debtors’ Sale and Bid\nProcedures Motion, concluding that the proposed auction\nprocedures did not comply with §1129(b)(2)(A)’s require-\nments for cramdown plans.

The Bankruptcy Court certified\nan appeal directly to the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Seventh Circuit.

The plan\nmust provide:\n       “(i)(I) that the holders of such claims retain the\n    liens securing such claims, whether the property sub-\n    ject to such liens is retained by the debtor or trans-\n    ferred to another entity, to the extent of the allowed\n4    RADLAX GATEWAY HOTEL, LLC v. AMALGAMATED BANK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n       amount of such claims; and (II) that each holder of a\n       claim of such class receive on account of such claim\n       deferred cash payments totaling at least the allowed\n       amount of such claim, of a value, as of the effective\n       date of the plan, of at least the value of such holder’s\n       interest in the estate’s interest in such property;\n          “(ii) for the sale, subject to section 363(k) of this ti-\n       tle, of any property that is subject to the liens secur-\n       ing such claims, free and clear of such liens, with such\n       liens to attach to the proceeds of such sale, and the\n       treatment of such liens on proceeds under clause (i) or\n       (iii) of this subparagraph; or\n          “(iii) for the realization by such holders of the\n       indubitable equivalent of such claims.” 11 U. S. C.\n       §1129(b)(2)(A).\nUnder clause (i), the secured creditor retains its lien on\nthe property and receives deferred cash payments. Under\nclause (ii), the property is sold free and clear of the lien,\n“subject to section 363(k),” and the creditor receives a lien\non the proceeds of the sale. Section 363(k), in turn, pro-\nvides that “unless the court for cause orders otherwise\nthe holder of such claim may bid at such sale, and, if the\nholder of such claim purchases such property, such holder\nmay offset such claim against the purchase price of such\nproperty”—i.e., the creditor may credit-bid at the sale, up\nto the amount of its claim.2 Finally, under clause (iii), the\nplan provides the secured creditor with the “indubitable\nequivalent” of its claim.\n——————\n    2 The\n        ability to credit-bid helps to protect a creditor against the risk\nthat its collateral will be sold at a depressed price. It enables the\ncreditor to purchase the collateral for what it considers the fair market\nprice (up to the amount of its security interest) without committing\nadditional cash to protect the loan. That right is particularly important\nfor the Federal Government, which is frequently a secured creditor in\nbankruptcy and which often lacks appropriations authority to throw\ngood money after bad in a cash-only bankruptcy auction.\n                    Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)                  5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n  The debtors in this case have proposed to sell their\nproperty free and clear of the Bank’s liens, and to repay\nthe Bank using the sale proceeds—precisely, it would\nseem, the disposition contemplated by clause (ii). Yet\nsince the debtors’ proposed auction procedures do not\npermit the Bank to credit-bid, the proposed sale cannot\nsatisfy the requirements of clause (ii).3 Recognizing this\nproblem, the debtors instead seek plan confirmation pur-\nsuant to clause (iii), which—unlike clause (ii)—does not\nexpressly foreclose the possibility of a sale without credit-\nbidding. According to the debtors, their plan can satisfy\nclause (iii) by ultimately providing the Bank with the\n“indubitable equivalent” of its secured claim, in the form of\ncash generated by the auction.\n  We find the debtors’ reading of §1129(b)(2)(A)—under\nwhich clause (iii) permits precisely what clause (ii) pro-\nscribes—to be hyperliteral and contrary to common sense.\nA well established canon of statutory interpretation suc-\ncinctly captures the problem: “[I]t is a commonplace of\nstatutory construction that the specific governs the gen-\neral.” Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S.\n374, 384 (1992). That is particularly true where, as in\n§1129(b)(2)(A), “Congress has enacted a comprehensive\nscheme and has deliberately targeted specific problems\nwith specific solutions.” Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U. S.\n489, 519 (1996) (THOMAS, J., dissenting); see also HCSC-\nLaundry v. United States, 450 U. S. 1, 6 (1981) (per\ncuriam) (the specific governs the general “particularly\nwhen the two are interrelated and closely positioned,\nboth in fact being parts of [the same statutory scheme]”).\n  The general/specific canon is perhaps most frequently\n——————\n  3 Title 11 U. S. C. §363(k)—and by extension clause (ii)—provides an\n\nexception to the credit-bidding requirement if “the court for cause\norders otherwise.” The Bankruptcy Court found that there was no\n“cause” to deny credit-bidding in this case, and the debtors have not\nappealed that disposition.\n6   RADLAX GATEWAY HOTEL, LLC v. AMALGAMATED BANK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\napplied to statutes in which a general permission or pro-\nhibition is contradicted by a specific prohibition or permis-\nsion. To eliminate the contradiction, the specific provision\nis construed as an exception to the general one. See, e.g.,\nMorton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535, 550–551 (1974). But\nthe canon has full application as well to statutes such as\nthe one here, in which a general authorization and a more\nlimited, specific authorization exist side-by-side. There\nthe canon avoids not contradiction but the superfluity of\na specific provision that is swallowed by the general one,\n“violat[ing] the cardinal rule that, if possible, effect shall\nbe given to every clause and part of a statute.” D. Gins-\nberg & Sons, Inc. v. Popkin, 285 U. S. 204, 208 (1932).\nThe terms of the specific authorization must be complied\nwith. For example, in the last cited case a provision of the\nBankruptcy Act prescribed in great detail the procedures\ngoverning the arrest and detention of bankrupts about\nto leave the district in order to avoid examination. The\nCourt held that those prescriptions could not be avoided\nby relying upon a general provision of the Act authoriz-\ning bankruptcy courts to “ ‘make such orders, issue such\nprocess, and enter such judgments in addition to those spe-\ncifically provided for as may be necessary for the enforce-\nment of the provisions of [the] Act.’ ” Id., at 206 (quoting\nBankruptcy Act of 1898, §2(15), 30 Stat. 546). The Court\nsaid that “[g]eneral language of a statutory provision,\nalthough broad enough to include it, will not be held to\napply to a matter specifically dealt with in another part\nof the same enactment.” 285 U. S., at 208. We recently\nquoted that language approvingly in Bloate v. United\nStates, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 10). Or as we\nsaid in a much earlier case:\n    “It is an old and familiar rule that, where there is, in\n    the same statute, a particular enactment, and also a\n    general one, which, in its most comprehensive sense,\n                 Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    would include what is embraced in the former, the\n    particular enactment must be operative, and the gen-\n    eral enactment must be taken to affect only such cases\n    within its general language as are not within the pro-\n    visions of the particular enactment. This rule applies\n    wherever an act contains general provisions and also\n    special ones upon a subject, which, standing alone, the\n    general provisions would include.” United States v.\n    Chase, 135 U. S. 255, 260 (1890) (citations and inter-\n    nal quotation marks omitted).\nHere, clause (ii) is a detailed provision that spells out\nthe requirements for selling collateral free of liens, while\nclause (iii) is a broadly worded provision that says nothing\nabout such a sale. The general/specific canon explains\nthat the “general language” of clause (iii), “although broad\nenough to include it, will not be held to apply to a matter\nspecifically dealt with” in clause (ii). D. Ginsberg & Sons,\nInc., supra, at 208.\n  Of course the general/specific canon is not an absolute\nrule, but is merely a strong indication of statutory mean-\ning that can be overcome by textual indications that point\nin the other direction. The debtors point to no such indi-\ncation here. One can conceive of a statutory scheme in\nwhich the specific provision embraced within a general\none is not superfluous, because it creates a so-called safe\nharbor. The debtors effectively contend that that is the\ncase here—clause (iii) (“indubitable equivalent”) being the\ngeneral rule, and clauses (i) and (ii) setting forth proce-\ndures that will always, ipso facto, establish an “indubita-\nble equivalent,” with no need for judicial evaluation. But\nthe structure here would be a surpassingly strange man-\nner of accomplishing that result—which would normally\nbe achieved by setting forth the “indubitable equivalent”\nrule first (rather than last), and establishing the two safe\nharbors as provisos to that rule. The structure here sug-\n8   RADLAX GATEWAY HOTEL, LLC v. AMALGAMATED BANK \n\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\ngests, to the contrary, that (i) is the rule for plans under\nwhich the creditor’s lien remains on the property, (ii) is\nthe rule for plans under which the property is sold free\nand clear of the creditor’s lien, and (iii) is a residual provi-\nsion covering dispositions under all other plans—for ex-\nample, one under which the creditor receives the property\nitself, the “indubitable equivalent” of its secured claim.\nThus, debtors may not sell their property free of liens\nunder §1129(b)(2)(A) without allowing lienholders to\ncredit-bid, as required by clause (ii).\n                              B\n   None of the debtors’ objections to this approach is valid.\n   The debtors’ principal textual argument is that\n§1129(b)(2)(A) “unambiguously provides three distinct\noptions for confirming a Chapter 11 plan over the objec-\ntion of a secured creditor.” Brief for Petitioners 15 (capi-\ntalization and bold typeface removed). With that much we\nagree; the three clauses of §1129(b)(2)(A) are connected by\nthe disjunctive “or.” The debtors contend that our inter-\npretation of §1129(b)(2)(A) “transforms ‘or’ into ‘and.’ ”\nReply Brief for Petitioners 3. But that is not so. The\nquestion here is not whether debtors must comply with\nmore than one clause, but rather which one of the three\nthey must satisfy. Debtors seeking to sell their property\nfree of liens under §1129(b)(2)(A) must satisfy the re-\nquirements of clause (ii), not the requirements of both\nclauses (ii) and (iii).\n   The debtors make several arguments against applying\nthe general/specific canon. They contend that clause (ii)\nis no more specific than clause (iii), because the former\nprovides a procedural protection to secured creditors\n(credit-bidding) while the latter provides a substantive\nprotection (indubitable equivalence). As a result, they say,\nclause (ii) is not “a limiting subset” of clause (iii), which\n(according to their view) application of the general/specific\n                     Cite as: 566 U.

To begin with, we know of no authori-\nty for the proposition that the canon is confined to situa-\ntions in which the entirety of the specific provision is a\n“subset” of the general one. When the conduct at issue\nfalls within the scope of both provisions, the specific pre-\nsumptively governs, whether or not the specific provision\nalso applies to some conduct that falls outside the general.\nIn any case, we think clause (ii) is entirely a subset.\nClause (iii) applies to all cramdown plans, which include\nall of the plans within the more narrow category described\nin clause (ii).4 That its requirements are “substantive”\nwhereas clause (ii)’s are “procedural” is quite beside the\npoint. What counts for application of the general/specific\ncanon is not the nature of the provisions’ prescriptions but\ntheir scope.\n   Finally, the debtors contend that the Court of Appeals\nconflated approval of bid procedures with plan confirma-\ntion. Brief for Petitioners 39. They claim the right to\npursue their auction now, leaving it for the Bankruptcy\nJudge to determine, at the confirmation stage, whether\nthe resulting plan (funded by auction proceeds) provides\nthe Bank with the “indubitable equivalent” of its secured\nclaim. Under our interpretation of §1129(b)(2)(A), how-\never, that approach is simply a nonstarter. As a matter of\nlaw, no bid procedures like the ones proposed here could\nsatisfy the requirements of §1129(b)(2)(A), and the distinc-\ntion between approval of bid procedures and plan confir-\nmation is therefore irrelevant.\n\n\n——————\n  4 We are speaking here about whether clause (ii) is a subset for pur-\n\nposes of determining whether the canon applies. As we have described\nearlier, after applying the canon—ex post, so to speak—it ceases to be a\nsubset, governing a situation to which clause (iii) will no longer be\ndeemed applicable.\n10 RADLAX GATEWAY HOTEL, LLC v.

To varying extents, some of those debates\nalso occupied the attention of the Courts of Appeals that\nconsidered the question presented here. See, e.g., In re\nPhiladelphia Newspapers, LLC, 599 F. 3d 298, 314–317\n(CA3 2010); id., at 331–337 (Ambro, J., dissenting). But\nnothing in the generalized statutory purpose of protecting\nsecured creditors can overcome the specific manner of that\nprotection which the text of §1129(b)(2)(A) contains. As\nfor pre-Code practices, they can be relevant to the inter-\npretation of an ambiguous text, but we find no textual\nambiguity here. And the pros and cons of credit-bidding\nare for the consideration of Congress, not the courts.\n  The Bankruptcy Code standardizes an expansive (and\nsometimes unruly) area of law, and it is our obligation to\ninterpret the Code clearly and predictably using well\nestablished principles of statutory construction.          See\nUnited States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235,\n240–241 (1989). Under that approach, this is an easy case.\nBecause the RadLAX debtors may not obtain confirmation\nof a Chapter 11 cramdown plan that provides for the sale\nof collateral free and clear of the Bank’s lien, but does not\npermit the Bank to credit-bid at the sale, we affirm the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY took no part in the decision of this\ncase.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/801109/", "sha1": "06e5775a33efbe5cacea94ec7c47af0c6d91c243", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2012-05-29T07:33:38"}
